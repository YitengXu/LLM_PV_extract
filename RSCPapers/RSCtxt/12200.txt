    , Accepted 2nd December 2019First published on 2nd December 2019AbstractA fluorine plasma-treated carbon electrode is used in HTM-free perovskite solar cells for high efficiency and moisture resistance. The fluorine-treated device with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.86% is achieved with a highly enhanced FF (FF = 0.69), showing superior long-term stability and excellent moisture penetration suppression.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most notable developments in the field of solar energy conversion technology.1,2 In comparison with traditional silicon solar cells, PSCs are not only manufactured at low cost based on the solution process, but also show high efficiency based on excellent light absorption ability. The most recently announced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a PSC has reached 25.2%, which breaks the existing efficiency of various PSCs, and is close to the record efficiency (26.1%) of a single-crystal silicon-based photovoltaic (PV) cell.3 Along with efficiency studies, many studies are underway to improve the long-term stability, which must be addressed for commercialization of PSC devices.
The long-term exposure degradation of the conventional PSCs occurs mainly at the hole transport material (HTM) and metal electrode interface. Various HTMs (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, and P3HT) used for conventional PSCs contribute to device performance by hole extraction in contact with the perovskite layer. Among these, spiro-OMeTAD is the most widely used for high efficiency PSCs due to its low recombination rate and efficient charge transport.4 However, the spiro-OMeTAD is expensive to manufacture, susceptible to heat and easily oxidized with atmospheric oxygen.5,6 Moreover, Li-TFSi, which is commonly used to improve the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD, is hygroscopic and accelerates the rapid deterioration of PSK, leading to the lack of long-term stability of PSCs.7,8 To solve this problem, there is a way to replace the inorganic HTM (CuI and CuSCN)9 or completely remove the hole transfer layer,10 but the efficiency is low. In addition to the HTM issues mentioned above, noble metals (Au and Ag) generally used for PSC electrodes are expensive materials and require a complicated deposition process. Besides, metal electrodes can be considered as potential impurities that interfere with the stability of the PSCs by promoting the decomposition of the perovskite due to diffusion by heat and light.11,12 Accordingly, studies on alternative methods for commercialization of PSCs are required.
A carbon electrode is regarded as a suitable substitute for a high cost, low stability HTM and a metal electrode simultaneously. Carbonaceous materials have the advantages of abundance, low-cost, chemical stability and high electrical conductivity.13,14 Carbon electrodes were first introduced into a PSC device by a fully printable process by Han et al., showing the possibility of being replaced by hole extraction electrodes.15,16 Furthermore, research studies to control the order of introduction of the carbon electrodes in the device have been conducted to improve the efficiency of the carbon electrode-based PSC.17 First reported in 2014, carbon electrode-based PSCs had carbon electrodes painted by screen printing directly onto crystalline perovskite films without conventional hole conducting materials.18 In contrast to the previously published fully printable mesoscopic carbon based PSC studies, paintable carbon electrode based PSCs have a relatively simple structure and are manufactured at low temperatures, thus providing high process efficiency. To date, HTM-free carbon electrode-based PSCs with more than 15% PCE have been developed through electron transport layer (ETL) shape control, composition engineering and interfacial engineering.19–21 Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of carbon effectively prevents the penetration of moisture and greatly improves the long-term stability of the PSC.22,23 Recently, Wu et al. showed that carbon electrode-based PSCs maintain 75% of their initial efficiency under high humidity conditions (85 ± 10% RH) for 100 hours.24 However, due to poor contact between the carbon and the perovskite layer, not only is hole transport inefficient at the interface, but also electron recombination is serious, resulting in lower performance than conventional PSCs.25 In addition, even though the carbon electrode is excellent in terms of water resistance, there are still meso-sized pores in the electrode formed by the printing or painting method. Therefore, a strategy for improving moisture resistance and increasing interfacial charge transfer efficiency is required.
Herein, we first applied F plasma to the hydrophobic carbon to form a superhydrophobic carbon electrode through a synergistic effect to improve the long-term stability and moisture resistance. In addition, these fluorine (F)-treatments increased the PCE by improving the hole extraction at the perovskite and carbon electrode interface. Fig. 1a represents a schematic diagram of the process used for the fabrication of a carbon electrode and F doping on the carbon electrode. Briefly, typical TiO2, mesoporous TiO2, and perovskite layers were prepared using a general two-step method, and then the carbon layer was applied by a screen printing method without the hole transporting materials. An F doped carbon electrode-based PSC (FPCE) was prepared by C4F8 vacuum plasma treatment on the fabricated carbon electrode-based PSC (CE) (detailed experimental methods are described in the ESI†).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy analysis were used to confirm the change in the elemental composition and structural characteristics of an FPCE. For an FPCE, the intensity of the C1s (286 eV) and O1s (534 eV) peaks decreased, while the intensity of the F1s (689 eV) peak increased significantly compared to the CE (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fluorine atoms were introduced to form various C–Fx groups (x = 1–3, 288–294 eV) through covalent bonds with the carbon atoms that comprise the carbon electrode (Fig. S1b and S2, ESI†). In particular in the formation of C–Fx groups, F atoms are introduced to a large number of oxygen defects present in the carbon electrode composed of carbon and oxygen atoms (Table S1, ESI†).26 In addition, the change of functional groups on the carbon electrode was confirmed through FT-IR analysis. The strong O–H stretch peak (3200–3600 cm−1), CO stretch peak, C–O stretch peak and carboxylic O–H bend peak (1350–1700 cm−1) intensities of the existing carbon electrodes decreased after the F plasma treatment, and the broad C–F stretch peak (1000–1300 cm−1) and the C–F stretch peak intensity of 1263 cm−1 were clearly observed (Fig. S3, ESI†). Also in the Raman spectrum, the D/G peak intensity ratio increased in F-treated cells (ID/IG = 0.90) compared to untreated cells (ID/IG = 0.87) and showed peak shifts and decreases of the 2D peak. The doping of F atoms in the graphite carbon multilayer showed an increase in surface defects and bond disorder (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†).27 As shown in Fig. 1b, the F atoms were introduced at the surface of the carbon electrode as well as penetrated through meso-sized interstices present in stacked carbon layers and existed in a gradient distribution up to the interface with the perovskite. These results indicated that F atoms were well doped both on the surface and inside of the carbon electrode.
We evaluated the photovoltaic performance of carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cells before and after F plasma treatment. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the FPCE and CE were measured for an active layer measuring 0.132 cm2 under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 as presented in Fig. 2a; the hysteresis behaviour of the PSC along the scan direction in the J–V curve was also evaluated and the results are summarized in Fig. S5 and Table S3 (ESI†). In the case of a carbon electrode PSC, it is difficult to manufacture a PSC having a high FF due to a poor contact at the interface between the perovskite and the carbon electrode. However, F plasma treatment led to better contact between the perovskite and the carbon electrode. Therefore, after F plasma treatment, the PCE increased by about 20% (from 11.76% up to 14.70%), and the fill factor (FF) was noticeably improved from 0.58 to 0.69. The relevant analyses are described in detail later.

The PCE distribution histograms were confirmed from 40 CEs and FPCEs as given in Fig. 2b. The average PCE of the CE and FPCE devices was 11.89% and 14.07%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 2c, the stabilized open-circuit voltage (VOC) for the CE and FPCE devices was 0.96 V and 1.01 V, and the stabilized PCE of the device was 12.86% and 14.02%, respectively. We confirmed that the FPCE had a relatively high VOC and the PCE and operated stably under light irradiation conditions. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibited in Fig. 2d represent a slight enhancement of JSC by F plasma treatment. The spectrum of the FPCE showed a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) close to 90% in the range of 450–750 nm, in which the integrated JSC of the CE and FPCE was 20.23 and 20.85 mA cm−2, respectively. The rise of these factors (FF, VOC, and JSC) was attributed to the energy level alignment at the interface of the carbon electrode to the perovskite layer and improved hole extraction properties. The J–V characteristics of the highest performing device with F plasma treatment are shown in Fig. S6 and Table S4 (ESI†); this device exhibited a PCE of 14.86% with a JSC of 22.20 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.03 V and a FF of 0.65. Moreover, we measured the device performance of larger active areas (1 cm2). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the device has a PCE of 9.63% with a JSC of 22.83 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.98 V and a FF of 0.43.

We analysed the factors that contributed to the improvement of the photovoltaic characteristics. First, the work function (WF) value of the carbon electrode with or without F plasma treatment was confirmed by UPS analysis (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b shows that the WF of the carbon electrode increased from 4.86 eV to 5.78 eV after F plasma treatment as a secondary electron cut-off edge change. The work function of the FPCE on the surface of the carbon electrode is significantly different from that of the perovskite band edge (5.3–5.4 eV). However, as described above, the gradient of the F doping concentration induced the slope of the energy level on the carbon electrode. Thus, the WF of the F-treated carbon electrode is well aligned with the perovskite valence band edge at the perovskite/carbon interface, thereby improving the hole extraction ability. A schematic energy diagram for this is illustrated in Fig. S8 (ESI†).
To verify our hypothesis, we measured a time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay rate change. The PL decay curve was fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The fitted parameters are listed in Table S5 (ESI†). The decay curves of samples with and without F plasma treatment are shown in Fig. 3c. The τavg decreased from 77.62 ns to 34.51 ns by F plasma treatment, and this drastically quenched PL lifetime is due to more efficient hole-injection into the carbon electrode via the favourable alignment of the energy bands. In addition, electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to further characterize the interface charge transport properties of the devices. Fig. 3d presents Nyquist plots in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz under 1 sun illumination. High frequency arcs generally correspond to the charge transport process at the HTM or HTM/electrode interface. But in our device, this corresponds to the hole transport process of the perovskite/carbon interface.28,29 The reduced charge transport resistance (RCT) of the F plasma-treated device indicates a less resistive energy loss (97.45 to 86.27 Ω cm2) during charge transport through the perovskite/carbon interface and in the carbon electrode. Also, the improved interface contact induced fewer series resistance (Rs) loss. This characteristic change led to a higher FF in the F-treated device, which was consistent with the measured J–V characteristics.30 The results were fitted using an equivalent circuit model (inset in Fig. 3d) and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). In this case, the resistance of the fluorine-doped carbon electrode was slightly reduced, but the performance improvement of the device was more affected by the interface contact enhancement (Fig. S9, ESI†).
To confirm that device stability by fluorination is further improved, we compared our FPCE device with a conventional carbon-based PSC device. Fig. 4a shows the long-term stability of the CE and FPCE stored under ambient conditions (temperature: 25 °C, and relative humidity: 40 ± 5%). The initial PCE of the CE was 12.85% at the start of the measurement, but gradually decreased to 10.95% after 1000 hours, maintaining about 85% of the initial performance. In carbon-based PSCs, there is no deterioration factor at the interface due to the HTM, which ensures relatively long-term stability.22 Surprisingly, the efficiency of the F plasma-treated device was maintained at 95% of its initial performance (from 14.67% to 14.01%), demonstrating excellent ambient stability. In addition, the fluorinated carbon electrode showed a decrease in efficiency even under relatively high humidity conditions (RH = 60 and 80 ± 5%), but showed higher moisture stability than conventional carbon electrodes (Fig. S10, ESI†). Since hydrophobic fluorine atoms are introduced into the existing hydrophobic carbon layer, a synergistic effect forms a superhydrophobic layer, which provides additional protection against water penetration.31 The contact angle was measured to confirm the increase in hydrophobicity. For the conventional carbon electrode, the contact angle was 97.8°, but the contact angle of the F-treated carbon electrode highly increased to 135.5° due to the improvement of hydrophobicity (Fig. S11, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a) Long-term stability of the CE and FPCE devices under controlled ambient conditions (temperature: 25 °C; relative humidity: 40 ± 5%). (b) Efficiency change of w/o and with F plasma-treated devices after 10 min of immersion test (left) and digital and OM images of the device. 
We confirmed the change in efficiency after immersion in water to confirm the increased water stability of our device with enhanced hydrophobicity (Fig. 4b, left). The moisture stability test was conducted under severe conditions of dipping the CE and FPCE devices for 10 minutes in a water bath. The CE sample showed 32% of the initial efficiency after immersion in the water bath, while the FPCE sample maintained 82% of the initial PCE after immersion. These results mean that the hydrophobic carbon itself partially inhibited moisture penetration onto the perovskite active layer, but the carbon layer containing hydrophobic fluorine blocked the penetrable moisture more effectively into the pores present in the carbon layer. To verify the inhibiting moisture penetration of the FPCE, which had been immersed in water, it was immersed in chlorobenzene to peel off the carbon layer, and the perovskite film was observed. Optical microscopic and digital photographic images in Fig. 4b (right) show the difference in the damage of the perovskite active layer under the carbon electrode following F plasma treatment on the carbon electrode. It was confirmed that the perovskite layer under the F-treated carbon electrode was hardly damaged and the water permeability was well suppressed.
In summary, we first presented that an effective and rapid method used F plasma treatment for the production of a highly efficient carbon electrode-based perovskite solar cell with durable moisture resistance. Through the F plasma treatment, F atoms were introduced into the carbon and perovskite interface in a concentration gradient, and it was confirmed that they were adjusted to an energy level suitable for charge extraction at the interface. It was confirmed that the photoelectric conversion efficiency was increased by about 20% (PCE = 11.76 to 14.70%) after the F plasma treatment, with a noticeable improvement in the fill factor (FF) due to the improved contact at the interface (FF = 0.58 to 0.69). Along with the improvement in efficiency, the long-term and water stability of the device was clearly improved. This is because hydrophobic fluorine was introduced into the hydrophobic carbon layer to form a superhydrophobic carbon electrode layer, which strongly prevents the external penetration of moisture. We believe that the strategy illustrated in this study can be extended to the commercial potential of PSCs by ensuring effective efficiency improvements and moisture resistance in the carbon electrode-based PSC studies.
