1. Introduction
In the 21st century, the rapid growth in human demand for electric vehicles and portable electric devices has stimulated a new energy economy, resulting from a cheap, sustainable, and secure energy supply which has become an important scientific and technical challenge in the development of new energy sources. As one of the state-of-the-art electrochemical energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have offered a promising opportunity to meet this challenge, by efficiently storing sustainable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and working as electrochemical power sources.1 In order to meet the increasing demands on energy density, size, weight, cost and cycle life, it is crucial to discover and innovate new electrode materials for improving LIB performance. As the overall performance of the LIBs depends intimately on the properties of the materials used, materials science and technology has become the key to developing new generation high-performance LIBs.
Since carbon materials were regarded as the most commercially valued anode material in LIBs, diverse nanostructured carbons and their composites, particularly three-dimensional (3D) network structured nanocarbons and their composite materials,2 have been developed by various synthesis strategies. With unique structural characteristics, most of the as-developed nanostructured carbon-based anode materials have demonstrated much improved Li storage and cycling performance in comparison with commercial graphite that offers a low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1 and very limited rate performance.3 Acting as a renewable energy source, biomass has been widely applied to biomass-derived carbonaceous materials for LIB anodes due to its low cost, accessibility, speedy regeneration, and environmental friendliness.4 These biomass-derived carbonaceous materials have been evidenced to be generated from a wide range of sources including bacterial cellulose, lignin, cornstalk, corn starch, sweet potato, peanut shells, pinecone hull, banana skins, cherry stones, bamboo chopsticks, sea shells, and ox horns.4,5 In recent years, the expansion of large-scale LIBs emerging in the power market and power grid areas has led to new demands on high-power LIBs with high-performance anode materials.1 Thanks to the active exploration and development of various biomass materials, the biomass-derived carbons and their composites have delivered high capacity, improved rate performance and cycling stability, driving considerable research interest in cost-effective and high-performance anode materials for LIBs.
Different from those published reviews related to biomass-derived carbons in energy conversion and storage, this tutorial review emphasizes recent advances of biomass-derived carbons and their composites only for advanced LIB anodes, in which some features have been specifically examined and assessed such as the diversity of biomass materials and the synthesis, nanostructure, morphology, and electrochemical properties of biomass-derived carbons and their composites, as well as their LIB performances in the most recent developments and research studies. Particularly, biomass-derived carbon composites are discussed with respect to the improvement in LIB performance. This review provides a critical analysis and comparison of these biomass-derived advanced LIB anode materials, along with important insights into the challenges and future directions in this field. Also, this review not only reflects the fast development and rapidly increasing need for information on LIB technologies with biomass-derived carbon materials, but also serves as a professional guide on renewable materials-based anode materials in LIBs, by building a research bridge between LIB anodes and biomass materials.
2. Chemical compositions and physical properties of biomass sources for LIBs
With various morphology, structure and elements, biomass is used not only to form biomass-derived carbon materials but also to realize heteroatom doping into the carbon network, particularly N-doping, so that the performance of expected electrochemical devices can be enhanced.3 As a cheap and plentiful source of carbon, biomass has been applied as a potential and successful raw material to prepare carbon- and its composite-based anode materials (see Fig. 1) in achieving desirable performance LIBs. Besides taking biomass from both plants and animals, biomass may be derived from forest crops and residues, agricultural crops and residues, industrial wastes, marine wastes, and domestic wastes, according to the literature.5
 Fig. 1  Biomass-derived carbons and their composites as anodes in an illustrated LIB. 
2.1 Forest crops and residues
Since forest harvesting became a major source of biomass for energy, forest crops and residues have been witnessed as important sources in the preparation of carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Often, harvesting may occur for high-value crops (e.g., plants, fungi, and other biological materials found in the forests) while the residues refer to non-merchantable woody biomass, such as tree species, and wood waste (e.g., sawdust, shavings, or bark) during logging practices and industrial operations.6
For the application of LIB anodes, the used forest crops and residues often have some unique physicochemical properties. For instance, ginkgo leaves7 can serve as a naturally sustainable biomass to produce porous carbon anode materials, because they carry plenty of organic components (e.g., cellulose, protein, carbohydrate, etc.) and a small amount of inorganic minerals. The organic components are the sources of carbon and nitrogen, resulting in N-doping in the carbon network in order to enhance electronic conductivity and reactivity. On the other hand, the inorganic minerals after their removal in experiments can essentially act as porogens to create nanopores, including micropores and mesopores, favoring rapid mass diffusion and transport of electrons and Li ions. Interestingly, detailed elemental information from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Yu's group8 showed that elemental compositions of ginkgo leaves included C, O, N, S, P, Ca, K and Mg. Similar to ginkgo leaves, willow leaves have been used to prepare a hard carbon material for LIB anodes.9 It was reported that a raw willow leaf was composed of 44.76 wt% C, 6.11 wt% H, 28.94 wt% O, 2.65 wt% N, 0.47 wt% S, 4.51 wt% K, 10.42 wt% Ca, and 2.14 wt% Mg. After acid washing, the surface area of as-prepared carbon materials increased from 53.6 m2 g−1 to 94.8 m2 g−1 while the rate of mesopore formation increased as well. These features suggested a promising strategy in developing biomass-derived carbon materials as anodes for high-performance LIBs.
2.2 Agricultural crops and residues
Generally, agricultural crops refer to plants or plant products that can be grown and harvested by human beings for certain purposes while the residues of agricultural products can encompass all types of agricultural wastes such as straw, stems, stalks, leaves, husks, shells, peels, pulp, stubble, and by-products, generated from processed agricultural products such as cotton, groundnut, cassava, jute, legumes (e.g., tomato, bean, and soy), coffee, abaca, cacao, tea, fruits (e.g., banana, pineapple, mango, cocoa, and cashew), palm oil and cereals (e.g., rice, wheat, maize or corn, sorghum, barley, and millet).10
Wheat stalk, which consists of natural cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and some trace elements, is always burned in the fields,11 causing air pollution and environmental issues. However, because its natural plant fiber structure favors the direct formation of porous carbon materials after a high-temperature heat treatment, wheat stalk can be used as a useful resource for carbon-based LIB anodes due to its combination of graphite and hard carbon, as well as the graphite-like interlayer spacing and moderate mesopores.3 As a typical agricultural crop, cotton is a sustainable cellulosic resource in abundance. It contains 90–95% cellulose, which undoubtedly makes it a strong source for fabricating porous carbon materials with high specific surface area (∼115 m2 g−1).12 In particular, when cotton as an effective sorbent was absorbed with Mg(NO3)2 solution, the formed MgO-template was introduced into the cotton-derived carbon and could act as a pore creator, resulting in improved surface area (up to 1260 m2 g−1) and interconnected macro/mesopores which not only facilitated fast charge transfer and electrochemical activity but also enhanced the storage and transport of Li ions.12 Also, rice husks, with some main components, such as cellulose (38%), hemi-celluloses (18%), lignin (22%), and SiO2, were pyrolyzed to obtain carbon fibers for LIB anodes due to the formation of a fibrous porous network.13
2.3 Industrial wastes
With the increased use of biomass as the source of carbon in energy storage and conversion, industrial wastes have become more and more significant in the biomass family owing to mass production in factories, industries, mills, and mining operations. A common list of industrial wastes are unwanted or residual materials, such as chemical solvents, radioactive wastes, metals, paints, sandpaper, pulp and paper products.14,15
With an annual production of up to 10 billion tons per year, chitosan has been extensively synthesized for the food industry, medical applications, and environmental protection because of its production by an inexpensive chemical treatment of renewable and inexpensive chitin (e.g., the exoskeleton of shrimp, crabs, and lobsters). As a cellulose-like and nitrogen-containing biopolymer, chitosan has served as an indispensable carbonaceous source to produce porous N-doped carbon anodes16 using a simple carbonization, coupled with a ZnCl2-assisted activation process. The addition of ZnCl2 resulted in a hierarchical macro/microporous carbon structure with a high specific area (∼1785 m2 g−1). Both porous structure and N-doping successfully enhanced the specific capacity and cycle stability in LIBs. In parallel, olive and cherry stones17 were used to develop two different disordered microporous carbon anodes in LIBs. After chemical activation with an aqueous solution of ZnCl2, the porous carbon material produced from the cherry stones demonstrated a more disordered structure in its layered carbon sheets than the olive-derived carbon prepared after physical activation under steam. However, the two biomass-derived carbons exhibited similar textural properties such as elements (e.g., C, H, N, and O), BET surface areas, micropore surface areas and volumes.17
2.4 Marine wastes
Though neglected for a long period of time, marine wastes have started to garner research attention as biomass materials in the development of next-generation electrochemical energy devices. Consisting of many organic compounds such as proteins and lipids, marine waste includes seaweeds (e.g., microalgae and enteromorpha), seashells, exoskeletons of crustaceans, and the bony parts of fish (e.g., head, fins, and bones), which have potential as sources of carbon materials.18
Among biomass algae, Enteromorpha is a green macroalga, which contains plenty of polysaccharides and proteins, a low content of fat and cellulose, and some mineral elements (e.g., Na, K, and Mg). In the preparation of biomass-derived carbon materials for LIB anodes, Enteromorpha can not only contribute to the construction of a sponge-like hierarchical porous architecture in the carbon network but also provide abundant heteroatoms (especially oxygen) for doping in the carbon matrix. It was reported19 that with a high surface area (>1500 m2 g−1), hierarchical porosity and abundant functional groups, the enteromorpha-derived carbon had an interconnected sponge-like structure, favoring the transport and diffusion of ions and improving the charge storage capacity of LIBs. Also, as a typical marine biomass, alginic acid works as a polysaccharide which is widely distributed in the cell walls of brown algae. Because alginic acid is a linear copolymer containing abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, the fibers of alginic acid have been used to fabricate a 3D network of nanosized carbon particles and a hierarchical porous architecture composed of both large mesopores (diameter: ca. 19 nm) and abundant micropores (<2 nm).20
2.5 Domestic wastes
The problem of domestic waste is drawing increasing attention due to its threat to the environment and public health in our daily life. Domestic wastes have been studied as useable materials in energy storage and conversion to produce energy needed for household and commercial use. Usually, lots of domestic wastes, which may consist of combustible materials such as paper, cardboard, yard clippings, wood, or similar materials located on property and in dwellings,21 are created in the course of ordinary day-to-day activities, such as cleaning and cooking.
For example, considering the thousands of eggs that are disposed of every day after their expiry date, the use of egg yolk as a useful biomass to prepare carbon materials has become an effective and environmentally friendly approach for waste utilization. Normally, egg yolk includes water (∼87%), proteins (∼11%, main elements such as C, H, O, N, S), carbohydrate (∼1%), sugar (∼1%), and a small amount of minerals (e.g., Ca, Fe, Mg, P, K, Na, and Zn). In the fabrication of egg yolk-derived carbon materials, N and P co-doped carbon capsules (PNCCs) were synthesized for the first time, where the doping of dual heteroatoms resulted in defects and disorder in the formed graphite shell of the carbon capsule.22 It was revealed that the combination of the doping of two heteroatoms (i.e. N and P) and the structure of edges in the carbon capsule can create more active sites, benefiting the diffusion of Li ions. At the same time, a protein-rich renewable biomass, egg white,23 was used with the assistance of mesoporous cellular foam (MCF) silica as a template to produce N-rich high-surface-area carbon anodes, demonstrating more exquisite properties in LIBs due to the unique combination of a high surface area, partial graphitization, and rich bulky nitrogen.
3. Preparation methods of biomass-derived carbons for LIB anodes
It is well-known that materials processing often depends on technical development and innovation. The selection of technical methods often determines the physical and/or chemical properties of the resulting material. In the exploration and development of novel biomass-derived carbon materials for LIB anodes, several important techniques and approaches have been explored and reported in the creation of porous nanostructures and heteroatom-doping in carbon matrices.
3.1 Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis is considered as the thermochemical decomposition of an organic material at elevated temperatures under a flowing gas in the absence of oxygen, involving the concurrent transformation of its chemical composition and physical phase and is irreversible. In a pyrolysis process, temperature, time, heating, and gas (N2 or Ar) flow rate are the main operation parameters. Inside of biomass materials, both major components (i.e., cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) and minor components (e.g., extractives and inorganic materials) would go through a series of complex, concurrent and consecutive reactions before the as-prepared carbon materials are formed at a fixed high temperature. Often, some porogenes such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, NaOH, KOH, H3PO4, AlCl3, MgCl2, LiCl and ZnCl2 can produce a porous structure and high specific surface area in the obtained carbon matrices.16,17,24 Using a heating procedure at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2, Nahm's group24 carried out a pyrolysis of banana fibers treated with pore-forming substances such as ZnCl2 and KOH. They found that after the pyrolysis at 800 °C for 1 h, the use of ZnCl2 (or KOH) significantly resulted in an improved surface area from 36 m2 g−1 to 1285 m2 g−1 (or 751 m2 g−1) and an increased pore diameter from 19 Å to 57 Å (or 24 Å).
3.2 Hydrothermal reaction
A hydrothermal reaction, also termed hydrothermal carbonization, is a thermochemical pretreatment related to closed-system thermo-chemical conversion in aqueous solutions and under an inert atmosphere at a temperature above 100 °C and a pressure above 1 atm. Normally, it is for the preparation of a valuable carbon product. Furthermore, the use of additives such as acids, bases, organosolvents, or other agents (e.g., some alkaline earth salts: NaxA, A = SO42−, Cl−, or NO3−) can affect the formed carbon products.13,25 Nowadays, hydrothermal techniques and sciences play a very key role in the preparation of graphitic porous carbon materials for LIB anodes. After removing the lignin and hemicellulose fractions of rice husk by a formic acid method, Wang et al.13 used the residual cellulose component as a precursor in a hydrothermal reaction, followed by further carbonization and SiO2 removal to create a porous carbon network, as seen in Fig. 2. In their synthesis, the SiO2 component acted as an “in situ” hard template to generate porosity in the as-prepared carbon materials. Their hydrothermal procedure induced an important morphological transformation of the cellulose fraction via partial hydrolysis of glucose/hydroxymethylfurfural and conversion into the as-prepared carbon network. Moreover, the overall yield was improved from 43% upon direct calcination to 60% upon the hydrothermal reaction. Importantly, the removal of SiO2 with NH4HF2 resulted in a fibrous mesoporous morphology in the carbon matrices.

3.3 Air-expansion method
To reduce the preparation cost, simplify the synthetic procedures, and solve the shrinkage problem, an air-expansion method has been conducted to produce porous carbonaceous aerogels as LIB anodes. This method can significantly create a hierarchically porous structure out of non-porous biomass materials and make a larger selection of biomass available for the preparation of carbonaceous aerogels. Away from traditional methods (e.g., sol–gel method, hydrothermal method, freeze-drying method, and one-step carbonization), a typical air-expansion method with rice as a raw material26 is to follow a puffing process in which the rice was sealed and exposed to a suitable moisture level and pressurized to around 200 pounds per square inch (PSI). Once the pressure was instantly released, the pressure stored inside the kernel caused it to puff out. In this way, a porous spongy texture is formed from the reaction between starch and moisture. The subsequent high-temperature carbonization procedure leads to the formation of carbonaceous aerogels. Reportedly, the air-expansion method developed by Zhu and co-workers26 has induced hierarchically porous carbonaceous aerogels and demonstrated extraordinary porous architectures, including macroporous, mesoporous and microporous structures, as well as the N-doping, ushering in a new strategy to fabricate carbonaceous aerogel anode materials from grains.
3.4 Emulsion method
An emulsion system is generally composed of two immiscible liquids, in which liquid droplets (a disperse phase) are dispersed in a liquid medium (the continuous phase). Generally, the selection of the emulsifier is crucial in the formation of the emulsion which can be mainly classified into three classes: oil-in-water (O/W), water-in-oil (W/O), and oil-in-oil (O/O). Considering that soybean oil is a vegetable oil extracted from soybean seeds, Kong et al.27 developed an emulsion of ethanol and soybean oil and then mixed the emulsion with Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) under stirring. After a series of treatments such as filtering, drying and calcination, composites of soybean oil-derived carbon and LTO (SOC/LTO) were obtained. Their structural characterization confirmed the successful carbonization of soybean oil. Moreover, the addition of soybean oil-derived carbon not only increased the electronic conductivity but also provided a porous structure, benefiting the improvement of battery performance such as cycling performance and rate capability.
3.5 Thermomechanical processing
Thermomechanical processing is a microstructure-developed process, with a combination of deformation and annealing treatments, which is often used to prepare metallic materials with optimum high density and distribution of the structural imperfections. Interestingly, Chatterjee et al.28 performed a thermomechanical processing to convert modified lignin precursors into carbon fiber-based anode materials. In the meantime, two modified lignin precursors were made from Kraft softwood lignin and Alcell hardwood lignin through chemical reactions. This full conversion process involves three steps: (1) melt spinning of the lignin precursor, (2) oxidative stabilization, and (3) a low temperature carbonization step in an atmosphere of 96% N2 and 4% H2. Furthermore, the chemical modification in the pre-treatment of Kraft softwood lignin produced functionalities and rheological properties which were similar to Alcell hardwood lignin, enabling the melt processing of Kraft softwood lignin in oxidative atmospheres. The thermomechanical processing has provided a strategy to combine innovative melt-processing techniques for preparing fused carbon fiber mats with a unique carbon mesostructure and graphite-like electrical properties, suggesting that the lignin-based carbon fiber is a viable alternative to conventional anode materials in LIBs.
4. Biomass-derived carbons as anodes in LIBs
4.1 Non-doped carbons
Though graphite is considered to be the most popular anode component in most commercially available LIBs, its limited theoretical capacity (∼372 mA h g−1) still triggers more exploration in low cost and well-sourced carbon materials to satisfy the growing demand of high performance LIBs. In particular, carbon materials derived from low cost natural resources – biomass materials, have become one of the most important research topics in new applications such as electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Using wheat stalk as a low-cost raw material, Yang's group3 fabricated graphene-like interconnected high graphitic carbon nanosheets (HGCNS) without heteroatom-doping via a hydrothermal reaction followed by graphitization treatments. The unique interconnected two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure of the as-prepared HGCNS which has a height of 1.0–2.0 nm corresponding to 2–6 single graphene layers from the results of an atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (see Fig. 3), can not only supply multiple sites for Li storage but also facilitate rapid mass transport of electrons and Li ions. On the other hand, the high degree of graphitization (∼90.2%) of the HGCNS brought about a flat and low charge–discharge voltage plateau, better than that of another wheat straw-derived carbon material.29 This greatly reduced the voltage hysteresis, and provided a commercialization prospect for LIBs. As an anode, the tested as-prepared HGCNS in LIBs delivered not only a reversible capacity of 502 mA h g−1, which was 1.35 times higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite, but also excellent rate capability (e.g., 461.4, 429.3, 305.2, and 161.4 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, 5, and 10C, respectively) and superior cycling performance (e.g., 215 mA h g−1 at 5C after 2000 cycles and 139.6 mA h g−1 at 10C after 3000 cycles).

Parallel to the research of the HGCNS, Feng and co-workers30 designed and studied natural ramie fibers and corncobs as raw materials to prepare 3D rod-like carbon micro-structures and 2D carbon nanosheets for LIB anodes via a facile heat treatment, respectively. Both ramie fiber-derived carbon (RFC, ∼718.81 m2 g−1) and corncob-derived carbon (CC, ∼343.81 m2 g−1) exhibited a larger surface area than 100 m2 g−1, while the CC presented a higher average pore diameter (i.e., 2.59 nm) as well as a higher pore volume (i.e., 0.4645 cm3 g−1) than the RFC (2.56 nm and 0.22 cm3 g−1, respectively). When tested as anodes in an assembled LIB, the CC nanosheets and RFC microrods exhibited high capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cylability. In particular, when cycled at room temperature in a potential range of 0.01–3.0 V with a current density of 100 mA g−1, the CC and RFC after 180 cycles displayed specific capacities of 606 and 489 mA h g−1, respectively, both of which are much better than the performance of graphite (∼375 mA h g−1).
4.2 Doped carbons
It is well known that doping of heteroatom(s) can induce defects, increase available active sites, and effectively modulate the electronic and chemical characteristics, resulting in the enhancement of electrochemical reactivity in LIBs. The use of biomass has been a simple and cost-effective approach to fabricate advanced carbon anodes with appropriate heteroatom(s)-doping and satisfactory electrochemical performance in LIB applications.

4.2.1 Single atom-doped carbons. 
So far, N-doping has been the most popular single heteroatom-doping in the development of biomass-derived carbon materials for LIB anodes because it can produce defects, create additional actives sites, and enhance the reactivity and conductivity. All the features create stronger Li-ion storage.
Using ginkgo leaves as raw materials, Ou et al.7 have successfully fabricated nitrogen doped porous carbon (NDPC) materials via a non-complicated heat treatment followed by a simple washing with HCl solution. After mineral residues were removed from the acidic washing, the combination of SEM, TEM, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), pore size distributions (PSDs), and XPS revealed a clear nitrogen doped porous structure, featuring micropores (1–2 nm) and mesopores (10–20 nm) (see Fig. 4), as well as an enhanced surface area of 504 m2 g−1 and a N content of 1.5%. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the NDPC delivered a high reversible capability of 505 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, 1.36 times higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. Furthermore, the NDPC demonstrated a high-rate capability of 190 mA h g−1 at 10C (1C = 372 mA g−1). Their results are significantly superior to those of hard carbon materials made from willow leaves in the application of LIB anodes.9

To study the effect of rich N-doping on LIB performance, Cao's group31 selected biomass-derived natural silk to obtain hierarchical porous 4.7% N-doped carbon (HPNC) nanosheets (NS) via simultaneous activation and graphitization. In their synthesis, the addition of metal salts such as FeCl3 and ZnCl2, serving as highly efficient activation–graphitization agents, speeded up the dissolution of natural silk and then benefited the formation of a hierarchically structural carbon material with a high microporous and mesoporous volume (∼2.28 cm3 g−1) and a high surface area (∼2494 m2 g−1). As observed in the SEM and TEM images (see Fig. 5), the thickness of nanosheets in the HPNC-NS (15–30 nm) effectively inhibited the stacking of nanosheets, while 4–5 layers of graphene exhibited a thickness of around 2 nm, along with a layer-to-layer distance of 0.40 nm. It was demonstrated that the nanosheet architecture not only offered minimum diffusive resistance to mass transport on a large electrode/electrolyte interface for the charge-transfer reaction, but also shortened the diffusion pathway of ion transfer. Their electrochemical measurements showed that as an anode material, the HPNC-NS exhibited a significant specific capacity of 1865 mA h g−1, five times higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. Similarly, the egg white-derived N-doped carbon anode,23 with mesopores centered at ∼4 nm and 20–30 nm, had a partially graphitized carbon, a specific surface area of 805.7 m2 g−1, and a bulk N content of 10.5 wt%, and demonstrated a high reversible lithium storage capacity of 1780 mA h g−1. Coupled with high surface area, suitable porous structure, and good structural defects, the N-rich biomass-derived carbons should prove to be a promising strategy to develop high-performance LIBs anodes. It is true that until now no other heteroatom-doped carbon anodes derived from biomass materials have exhibited higher performance in LIBs.

4.2.2 Dual atom-doped carbons. 
Compared with a single heteroatom, two different heteroatoms can produce larger asymmetrical spin and charge density, resulting in enhanced defects and electronic conduction, and further promoting electrochemical reaction active sites. It has been recently found that using biomass as a raw material to prepare an advanced carbon anode, it is easy to introduce heteroatoms as a doping phase in the carbon network, as biomass often contains some typical heteroatoms such as N, P, O, and/or S.
In searching for a green approach to obtain synergistic features such as hierarchical porous architectures, abundant defects and functional groups for enhancing electrochemical performance, Yu et al.19 selected heteroatom-containing Enteromorpha as the precursor to create hierarchical porous carbon products, by a direct carbonization and activation procedure. Enteromorpha has channel-like walls with a thickness of ∼10 μm, favoring the formation of sponge-like hierarchical porous architectures. With a high surface area (∼2073 m2 g−1) and hierarchical macro/meso/micropores, the Enteromorpha-derived carbons (EDC) were interconnected to form a sponge-like structure favorable not only to ionic transport and diffusion but also to the improvement of lithium storage capacity. XPS measurements revealed N and O contents in the ranges of 0.64–0.85 at% and 11.36–12.24 at%, respectively. An analysis of high-resolution N 1s and O 2s spectra evidenced that the N 1s spectra were composed of pyrrolic/pyridine (N-5) and quaternary (N-Q) nitrogen and the oxygen functionalities were split into CO, C–OH, and/or C–O–C, and carboxylic groups. The presence of N and O atoms made more defects and active sites in the carbon network for charge storage. When investigated in a half-cell configuration with a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte, the EDC anode presented a high specific capacity of 1347–1709 mA h g−1, an initial coulombic efficiency of 61–64%, and a cyclability up to 500 cycles.
Besides the N and O co-doped carbon, the egg yolk-derived P and N co-doped carbon capsules (PNCCs) were obtained by Ciucci's group22 through a facile pyrolysis in which egg yolk was used as the biomass source of carbon. After the combination of TEM, XRD, and Raman spectra revealed a hollow capsule structure with multiple graphitized carbon layers and many edges, the XPS measurements (see Fig. 6) showed the co-existence of C (∼82.6%), N (∼7.6%), O (∼4.8%), and P (∼2.7%), as well as small amounts of impurities such as Na (∼1.4%) and Sn (∼0.9%), and suggested the co-doping of N and P atoms into the PNCCs. In an evaluation of the PNCCs as the anode material for half-cell LIBs with a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte, it was found that the reversible capacity of the PNCCs was ∼770 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The cycling performance showed that after 100 continuous cycles, the PNCCs still had a reversible specific capacity as high as 660 mA h g−1, suggesting the high reversibility and stability of the PNCCs. They believed that the high capacity of the PNCCs was attributed to additional lithium intercalation sites arising from the edges and graphite layers of the capsule structure as well as the defects and disorder in the graphite shell during the N and P co-doping. Also, a biomass-derived N, S co-doped carbon material was prepared by Zhang's group32 who used broad bean shells as the raw materials. Although high surface area (∼655.4 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (0.38 cm3 g−1) were achieved, their N, S co-doped carbon, measured as an anode material at a discharge rate of 1C, only delivered a capacity of 261.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.

Based on the data reported it is very clear that the synthesis methods as well as the selection of biomass materials are very important in the strategy to develop biomass-derived carbon with heteroatom(s)-doping for high-performance LIB anodes.

5. Composites of biomass-derived carbons as anodes in LIBs
5.1 Composites of carbon and silicon
Although silicon has become the most attractive candidate for LIB anodes due to its high theoretical capacity (3580–4200 mA h g−1, 10-fold higher than that of commercial graphitic anodes (350–365 mA h g−1)), two challenges remain in the areas of large volume change and serious interfacial side reactions, limiting the high capacity of Si-based anodes in LIBs. However, the incorporation of conductive carbon can not only alleviate fracture during volume changes of nano-sized Si but also increase electrical contact and conductivity, which enhances the capacity and cycling stability. The recent emergence of biomass has encouraged a new green synthesis to produce composites of carbon and silicon for the development of high performance LIBs.
Using a green route related to a conventional solution-coating and carbonization process, Kim et al.33 designed and fabricated carbon-coated Si (C-Si) and N-doped carbon coated Si (NC-Si) materials by using glucose and glucosamine as the sources of carbon and N-doped carbon, respectively. Compared with the C-Si without N-doping, the NC-Si exhibited a significant N 1s spectrum in the XPS measurement, consisting of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogens which can improve conductivity and active sites. According to TGA results (see Fig. 7), the total amount of carbon and nitrogen in the NC-Si was 24.1 wt%, close to the amount of carbon in the C-Si (∼23.9 wt%). When electrochemical measurements were performed in an assembled LIB using a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte, it was found that the capacity retentions for the C-Si and NC-Si anodes after 200 cycles were 98.9% and 99.5%, higher than that of a bare Si anode (∼98%). Particularly, at 2000 mA g−1, the NC-Si anode demonstrated a reversible capacity of 1735 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, which was 29% higher than that of the C-Si anode. The capacity demonstrated by the NC-Si is the highest among all the data reported for NC-coated Si anodes.

Considering that the addition of carbon can boost the cycling stability and capacity of Si-based anodes, Lu's group34 adopted a cost-effective method and fabricated a novel core–shell structured graphite/silicon@pyrolyzed-carbon (G/Si@C) composite where the natural flake graphite and glucose acted as the sources of graphite and pyrolyzed carbon. The active silicon particles (∼126 nm) were uniformly distributed on the surface of the graphite matrix. On the one hand, the graphite provided sufficient electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. On the other hand, the internal pyrolyzed-carbon facilitated a physical and electrical connection between graphite and silicon particles, buffering the volume change of Si and producing a stable solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) film. As a tested anode material in a voltage window of 0.005–2 V at 0.1C, the G/Si@C composite with 15.7 wt% silicon gave a high reversible capacity of ∼637.7 mA h g−1 with an initial efficiency of 77.9%. In a cycling test, the capacity of the G/Si@C retained ∼570.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, indicating a capacity retention of 89.5%. Their research results demonstrated excellent structural stability and electrochemical performance, paving a way for commercial utilization of Si-based anode materials.
Interestingly, using rice husk as silicon source, Zhang et al.35 synthesized rice husk-derived hierarchical silicon/nitrogen-doped carbon/carbon nanotube (SNCC) spheres as a composite anode for LIBs. After the rice husk-derived Si nanoparticles were homogeneously encapsulated in the highly conductive, porous carbon mixture of N-doped carbon and carbon nanotubes, the SNCC anode delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 1380 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and maintained 1031 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, showing good potential in developing high-performance LIB anodes. Also, when glucose served as the source of carbon, Hu et al.36 introduced an oxide (i.e., SiOx) into the composite of Si–C to obtain a ternary Si@SiOx/C composite via a hydrothermal reaction. Interestingly, their Si@SiOx/C composite anode exhibited a much higher reversible lithium storage capacity (∼1100 mA h g−1) at 150 mA g−1, without a decay of capacity even after 60 cycles.
5.2 Composites of carbon and oxide
To improve the performance of LIB anodes, the incorporation of high-capacity materials into carbon-based materials has become an efficient approach to form high performance composite anodes. Owing to high reversible capacities above 1000 mA h g−1,37,38 transitional metal oxides have been combined with biomass-derived carbon-based materials as one promising strategy for developing next-generation high-performance LIB anodes.

5.2.1 Non-doped carbon and oxide. 
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) has been known as one of the prominent transitional metal oxides with its high theoretical capacity (∼1007 mA h g−1). To overcome drastic volume variation (∼200%) and particle agglomeration during continuous lithiation/delithiation reactions at the utilization of α-Fe2O3 during the anode study, Wu et al.37 combined carbon with α-Fe2O3 to construct a graphitic carbon-encapsulated α-Fe2O3 (α-Fe2O3@GC) nanocomposite via an “absorption-catalytic graphitization-oxidation” process (see Fig. 8(a)). In their synthesis, a catalytic transition metal salt was introduced into degreasing cotton in order to decrease the graphitization temperature (down to 650 °C) and obtain graphitic carbon. Here, the degreasing cotton served as a cost-effective carbon-sourced biomass material as well as a biotemplate surrounding Fe. In this way, the onion-like carbon shell structured graphite carbon-encapsulated α-Fe2O3 was formed, uniformly distributed in a fibrous carbon matrix. As soon as the carbon content reached 32.5 wt%, electrochemical measurements were performed for an assembled LIB with the α-Fe2O3@GC and α-Fe2O3 anodes, respectively. It was found in a tested voltage range of 0.005 to 3 V and at a discharge rate of 0.2C the α-Fe2O3@GC revealed a Coulombic efficiency of ∼99% along with a reversible capacity of 1070 mA h g−1 after 430 cycles. It was higher than that of α-Fe2O3 (∼650 mA h g−1), suggesting that the α-Fe2O3@GC with 32.5 wt% carbon had much better capacity and cycling performance in comparison with α-Fe2O3. Furthermore, at 1C and 2C, the α-Fe2O3@GC delivered reversible capacities of 950 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and 850 mA h g−1 even up to 200 cycles. Based on the TEM images (see Fig. 8(b) and (c)), the microstructure of the α-Fe2O3@GC composite after 100 cycles revealed that with the protection of graphite carbon, the Fe2O3 nanocrystals still maintained their original quasi-spherical morphology and were well embedded in the carbon matrix, even after continuous lithiation/delithiation, resisting structural damage, agglomeration and pulverization phenomenon. Similar to the α-Fe2O3@GC anode research, an amorphous Fe2O3 coated carbon (A-Fe2O3@C) was also designed and fabricated for LIB anodes by Sun's group,38 in which the amorphous Fe2O3 as a shell was tightly coated onto the 3D bacterial cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers in a highly interconnected nanofibrous structure. At 400 mA g−1 in a voltage range of 0.2–3.0 V, the A-Fe2O3@C anode retained a high capacity of ∼1135 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% over 200 cycles. When a cycling test was carried out at 1000 mA g−1 up to 400 cycles, the final capacity of the A-Fe2O3@C was 890 mA h g−1, more than 75% of the initial reversible capacity. Both of Fe2O3 and carbon composite anodes provided a prospect and strategy to develop high-performance anode materials for future LIBs.

Besides the composites of Fe2O3 and carbon, two composites of Co3O4–C39 and CuO–C40 exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance after the addition of biomass-derived carbons. The former included murdannia simplex-derived hierarchically porous carbon, providing not only a high electrical conductivity matrix to relax the volume expansion of oxides but also sufficient anchor sites for the uniform distribution of oxide nanoparticles and high-capacity Co3O4 nanoparticles (∼890 mA h g−1), while the latter was constructed by a CuO core and a carbon shell, using humic acid as the biomass carbon source. Due to the high surface area (∼163 m2 g−1) and hierarchical porous structure of carbon with an effective loading of small Co3O4 nanoparticles (∼10 nm), the reversible capacity of the Co3O4–C composite anode after 100 cycles was ∼1215 mA h g−1 at a tested current density of 100 mA g−1 over the potential range of 0.01–3.00 V, which was superior to the theoretical capacity of ∼890 mA h g−1 for Co3O4, demonstrating that the Co3O4–C composite had good cycling performance and stability. Specifically, at 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1, the Co3O4–C composite had reversible capacities of 880, 702, and 375 mA h g−1, respectively. For the core–shell structured CuO–C composite tested as an anode in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V, the reversible charge capacity of the CuO–C composite was ∼607.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 50 cycles, with a Coulombic efficiency approaching approximately 100%, demonstrating a tremendous reversibility, while CuO only had a reversible charge capacity of ∼168.3 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 50 cycles due to poor ion permeability and electron conductivity. At current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4C, the capacities of the CuO–C were 587.3, 579.7, 550.6, 489.2, 380.2, and 360.7 mA h g−1, respectively.
Also, other oxides such as MoO2,41 SiOx,42,43 and TiO244 were combined with carbon to form novel C-oxide composites for LIB anodes. Subjected to different kinds of biomass under optimal experimental conditions (e.g., synthesis approach, temperature, solvent, pH, and/or template, etc.), the as-prepared C-oxide composites exhibited improved battery performance due to their high surface area, suitable porous structure, and good electronic conductivity, as seen in Table 1.

5.2.2 Doped carbon and oxide. 
Recently, one of the research efforts has been focused on combining metal oxides with biomass-derived heteroatom(s)-doped carbons rather than with biomass-derived carbons because the heteroatom-doping can not only improve the electronic conductivity but also increase active sites in biomass-derived carbon materials, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. Using a synthesis route without water and other assisted chemicals, Gao et al.45 designed TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in biomass-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (TiO2/BDNDC) with chicken egg white and Ti(SO4)2 as the precursors of N-doped carbon and TiO2. With a selected heat treatment, a conductive rutile phase was obtained for TiO2 at 880 °C while the carbon content of the TiO2/BDNDC composite was 17.1 wt% in terms of TGA results. After XPS confirmed the presence of N-doping, the TiO2/BDNDC composite was tested in an assembled lithium half-cell with a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte. It was found in a voltage range of 1.0–3.0 V that at current densities of 0.2, 1, 5, 10, and 20C, the reversible capacities of the TiO2/BDNDC anode were 189, 154, 122, 91, and 74 mA h g−1, respectively, which were better than those of pure TiO2 (160, 97, 32, 16, and 9 mA h g−1). When the cyclability was measured at 5C, the capacity of the TiO2/BDNDC after 100 cycles was ∼118 mA h g−1, which was much higher than that of pure TiO2 (∼57 mA h g−1). These results suggested that the addition of N-doped carbon clearly enhanced the capacity of TiO2.
Considering that bamboo leaves are a sustainable and biodegradable natural resource with fascinating biological microstructures favorable to the fabrication of hierarchical porous carbon, Xu et al.46 studied a SiO2/N-doped C (SiO2/N-C) nanocomposite material for LIB anodes via a carbonization process. After bamboo leaves were treated in hydrochloric acid at 60 °C for 6 h to remove unwanted materials and impurity ions, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurement (see Fig. 9) confirmed the presence of O (∼32.38 wt%), Si (∼10.57 wt%), N (∼5.21 wt%), C (∼50.01 wt%), Al (∼0.23 wt%), and Au(∼1.6 wt%). Au was attributed to gold sputtering for the test while the content of Al was too small. Due to the N content, N-doping should be present in the final SiO2/N-C nanocomposite. When electrochemical measurements were run in an assembled LIB, it was found that the SiO2/N-C anode delivered a high lithium-storage capacity of ∼586.2 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, with good cycle stability (294.7 mA h g−1 after 190 cycles) and an ultra-high coulombic efficiency close to 100%. In particular, at a very high current density of 1000 mA g−1 after 20 cycles, the high capacity of the SiO2/N-C anode was 106.7 mA h g−1, which was two times that of a commercial graphite anode at 200 mA g−1 (∼49.6 mA h g−1). It was demonstrated that the green and sustainable strategy with biomass offers a new avenue to high performance nanostructured LIB anodes.

5.3 Composites of carbon and sulfide
Metal sulfides (M = Mo, W, V, Sn, or Zr) have gained much research attention as anode materials in high-energy LIBs owing to their layered structure, redox variabilities and high cycling stabilities. Although MoS2 as a typical metal sulfide delivers the highest theoretical lithium capacity of 670 mA h g−1,47 some practical challenges such as low electrical conductivity, easy stacking and restacking, and large volume expansion during lithium insertion/extraction resulted in poor cyclability and rate capability. Biomass-derived carbon materials have been one robust research direction to construct MoS2/carbon nanostructured composites for LIB anodes with enhanced electronic conductivity and hence rapid electron transfer.
Employing auricularia as a strong water-absorbing biomass material that favors the construction of a hierarchical porous biomass carbon framework which can curb aggregation and stacking of MoS2 nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion of MoS2 nanoparticles, Wang et al.47 incorporated MoS2 nanosheets with a few layers into biomass-derived carbon (MoS2/C) via a carbonization process. Compared to the 54 wt% MoS2/C composite, the 79 wt% MoS2/C composite in the obtained XRD spectra exhibited a sharp and strong (002) peak, suggesting a serious stacking of the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets. To obtain good electrochemical performance, the 54 wt% MoS2/C composite was used in the electrochemical measurements using an assembled LIB. It was found at 200 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V that the 54 wt% MoS2/C anode exhibited an improved specific capacity (∼707.4 mA h g−1) compared with the commercial MoS2 (∼580.2 mA h g−1) and the corresponding hierarchical porous carbon (215.5 mA h g−1). At different rates of 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 to 6400 mA g−1, the 54 wt% MoS2/C also showed higher rate-capability. Interestingly in the cycling test with a high current density of 1600 mA g−1, the capacity of the 54 wt% MoS2/C anode remained at 400 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency above 99%, displaying an impressive cycling stability.
In contrast to the research of 54 wt% MoS2/C, Lu and Fong48 used a different method to synthesize MoS2/alginate-derived carbon (MoS2/ADC) and CoMoS3.13/alginate-derived carbon (CoMoS3.13/ADC) with alginate as a template as well as a source of 3D porous carbon. Based on their synthesis, the crystallized MoS2 and CoMoS3.13 were distributed within the porous carbon matrix, respectively. The MoS2/ADC was prepared from ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and sodium alginate and L-cysteine, as seen in Fig. 10, while the CoMoS3.13/ADC was fabricated from a mixture of divalent cation solution (i.e., Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 1 M) and the precursors alginate and MoS2. Upon structural characterization using the combination of SEM, TEM and XRD, on the one hand, it was found for the MoS2/ADC that the MoS2 crystals only presented in areas surrounding graphitized carbon nanoshells where no MoS2 crystals were embedded within the walls of the carbon nanoshells. On the other hand, it was revealed for the CoMoS3.13/ADC that due to the presence of Co2+, the highly crystalline CoMoS3.13 was embedded in the porous carbon network without any carbon shell. When electrochemical performance was evaluated in a LIB, it was found at 100 mA g−1 in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V that the initial discharge/charge capacities of the CoMoS3.13/ADC were 1436/1121 mA h g−1, respectively, higher than those of the MoS2/ADC (1100/874 mA h g−1). After 50 cycles, the CoMoS3.13/ADC showed a higher capacity (∼1125 mA h g−1) than the MoS2/ADC (∼870 mA h g−1). Especially, at 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, the reversible capacities of the CoMoS3.13/ADC were 1077, 965, 877, 801, and 755 mA h g−1, respectively, better than those of the MoS2/ADC. Compared to the MoS2/ADC, the CoMoS3.13/ADC presented enhanced electrochemical properties, not only due to its higher theoretical specific capacity (∼752 mA h g−1), but also due to the better dispersion of CoMoS3.13 within the alginate matrix, resulting from the crosslinking effect of Co2+ ions.

5.4 Other biomass-derived carbon-based composites
In order to develop low-cost, environmentally friendly and high-performance anodes for next-generation LIBs in the rapid development of electric vehicles and portable electronics, biomass-derived carbon materials have been composited with other components to create novel composite anodes with high capacities above 372 mA h g−1.
To find high-rate anode materials for LIBs, Song and co-workers49 synthesized mesoporous biocarbon fibers adhered with Fe3O4/Fe nanoparticles (Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs) via a calcination treatment. They claimed that due to the presence of amorphous carbon, the Fe3O4/carbon composites had limited rate capabilities at high current densities while the addition of Fe could create a chemical bonding with Fe3O4, resulting in an active synergy between Fe and Fe3O4. Furthermore, the biocarbon fibers were obtained from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) hydrolyzed from cotton, by taking into account two advantages of CNCs, the absorbance of metal ions and the presence of morphological features favorable to the fabrication of hierarchical porous carbon. After electrochemical measurements were performed in an assembled LIB between 0 V and 3.0 V, a proposed mechanism for the Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs in LIBs indicated that the graphitized biocarbon fibers in the Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs can enhance electronic transport and balance charges during the fast insertion/extraction of Li ions, favoring the improvement of rate capability and the release of strain caused by the volumetric change of Fe3O4 during cycling. It was demonstrated that due to the synergistic effect of the mesoporous hybrid structure with the graphitized biocarbon fibers and the chemical bonding between Fe3O4 and Fe, the Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs anode demonstrated high rate capabilities and cycling stability at various current densities, and excellent cycling performance at higher current and fast charging features. At 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1 A g−1 for 10 cycles, the reversible capacities of the Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs were 732.5, 666.7, 611.452, 621.4, 614.5, 589.3, and 492.7 mA h g−1, respectively, which were higher than those of pure Fe3O4 (see Fig. 11(a)). In particular, at 1 A g−1, the Fe3O4/Fe/MBCFs anode showed a high reversible capacity of 472 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles and could be rapidly charged to 100% in 28.3 min (see Fig. 11(b)). Furthermore, after 160 cycles at varied current densities from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1, the discharge capacity remained at 524.6 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency close to 100%. This study should be instructive for the design and fabrication of high-rate nanostructured anode materials derived from biomass renewable resources.

Also, Yang's group50 synthesized another ternary composite of Ni doped NiO fibers with carbon fibers (NiO/Ni/C-F) by using sustainable alginate fibers as a template and carbon source. The electrochemical measurements in a potential window of 0.01–3.0 V showed that the NiO/Ni/C-F anode after 200 cycles reached 793 mA h g−1 at 0.072 A g−1, higher than the theoretical capacity of NiO (718 mA h g−1). Even at 1.44 A g−1, the NiO/Ni/C-F after 200 cycles attained a capacity of 526 mA h g−1, indicating that the synthesized ternary biomass-derived composite of oxide/metal/carbon highlighted a cost-effective, green and eco-friendly strategy for obtaining high-performance anode materials for next-generation LIBs.
6. Conclusions and future prospects
A bridge between renewable biomass materials and LIB anodes has been built in this tutorial review, with the examination, analysis and comparison of recent developments and advances in biomass-derived carbons and their composites as anode materials for next-generation LIBs. This review examines the best performing carbon-based systems that demonstrate high Li storage capacity, improved rate performance and cycling stability, and thus are suitable alternatives to replace state-of-the-art anode components in LIBs. The use of various biomass materials, coupled with the facile and suitable conversion of biomass into carbon, demonstrated that compared to conventional carbon materials, the biomass-derived carbons and their composites have served as more important sustainable components for high-performance anodes in LIBs due to their unique nanostructure and morphology. In particular, heteroatom(s)-doping and carbonaceous porous structures, as well as the synergistic effect of carbons and combined materials, play a crucial role in the improvement of LIB performance, especially Li capacity and stability. The structure–reactivity optimization of doped-carbons should result not only in a short Li diffusion path length and a fast electron transport within the material and to the current collector, but also in minimizing a volumetric change and in generating a stable solid–electrolyte interface.
The biomass-derived carbons and their composites are being considered as exciting anode components in LIBs for two important reasons. Firstly, they can be synthesized via cost-effective and green chemistry approaches. Secondly, their specific capacity is greatly improved as compared to graphite materials. Even with that, there are still some important issues that need to be addressed, such as (i) the use and selection of biomass materials, (ii) the conversion efficiency of biomass into carbon, (iii) the choice and fabrication of composites with the biomass-derived carbon. Moreover, the transition of biomass into carbon exists in a balance in their utilization for LIB anodes, not only because the impurity components of biomass are hard to remove, resulting in a negative effect on the process of fabrication and the cost-effectiveness of the material, but also because the expected carbon structure cannot always have a positive effect on battery performance. Also, as compared to normal carbons, the biomass-derived carbons have no strong flexibility and ability to be composited with other diverse functional materials for further improvement of LIB performance. Therefore, several important strategies can be proposed as given below:
(1) Making proper selection and pre-treatment(s) of biomass materials in local areas. An appropriate choice of biomass will result in the production of low-cost and high-quality carbon materials with a required porous structure, while the effective pre-treatment leads to the removal of impurities. This will further improve the morphology, resulting in a high quality product with desired electrochemical performance.
(2) Improving the conversion efficiency of biomass into carbon materials should rely on cost-effective and easy to scale-up methods that deliver porous, preferentially nanostructured carbon.
(3) Choosing components that demonstrate a high theoretical Li capacity, good physicochemical stability, and/or suitable compatibility with carbon for developing biomass-derived carbons and their composites.
(4) Selecting scalable fabrication strategies of biomass-derived carbon composites that fully utilize the high surface area of carbon that host the combined material(s), while maintaining the porosity and structure of both components. This will allow a synergistic benefit for improvement of electrode capacity, etc.
(5) Developing theoretical models addressing the design of biomass-derived carbons and their composites with an emphasis on the Li+ insertion–removal process, molecular interactions, and chemistries, which will guide researchers to enhance the specific capacity, minimize the negative effects related to the volume expansion, and figure out the dynamics and chemistry of the SEI layer.
The exploration of biomass-derived carbon materials is very critical as LIBs are an emerging technology not only in the area of powering electronics, but also for electrical mobility with targets already set for 2019–2020 elsewhere. Robust, safe, long-lasting and cost-effective anode components will immediately be required for manufacturing next-generation high-performance LIBs.
