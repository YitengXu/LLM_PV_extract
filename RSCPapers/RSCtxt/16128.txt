    , Accepted 17th May 2019First published on 18th May 2019AbstractCost effective imidazole-based star-shaped oligo(arylamines) were easily prepared in good yields via the reaction of one precursor containing two or more aldehydes with a dione compound having two arylamines. High performance perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cells with a conventional cell configuration were fabricated using these compounds as dopant-free hole transport materials. The best solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency reached ∼17.5%, which surpassed that based on LiTFSI/t-BP doped spiro-OMeTAD. The cell also exhibited much better temporal stability than the standard cell of LiTFSI/t-BP doped spiro-OMeTAD, as no hydrophilic dopants are needed.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interest1–3 since the seminal report of Miyasaka,4 and the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been boosted to >23% over the past few years.5 Cell configurations of n–i–p (or p–i–n) planar thin film and porous p–n heterojunction types are popularly used,6,7 and therefore, both hole- and electron-transport materials attract research interest. In addition to inorganic hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as CuI, Cu2O, CuSCN and NiO,8 organic HTMs have continued to experience a research boom in recent years.9–12 Up to now, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)13,14 is still the most popularly used HTM and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >20% can be achieved. It is normally required to add hydrophilic p-type dopants such as cobalt(III) metal complexes, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) and copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc), to increase the hole mobility of spiro-OMeTAD and enhance the overall cell efficiency. However, the hydrophilic nature of these materials could trigger device degradation. Some recent examples illustrated that the stability issue of PSCs based on doped spiro-OMeTAD could be ingeniously overcome: (1) using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite;15,16 (2) using Lewis base and acid combination to suppress moisture incursion.17 Nevertheless, the high cost of spiro-OMeTAD due to complicated synthesis and purification will hamper its commercialization.18 Therefore, development of low cost and dopant-free HTMs as a substitute for spiro-OMeTAD is very attractive to researchers.19
There are two logical approaches for improving the hole mobility of HTMs. The first one is planarization of conjugated molecules for reducing re-organization energy and increasing intermolecular electronic coupling,20–25 which is also the strategy frequently used for organic field-effect transistors.26 The hole mobility can be as high as >10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to good intermolecular π–π overlap.27 The second one is using small molecule arylamines due to their high-lying HOMO and good hole transport ability in the film state.9–12 They have been popularly used in organic light-emitting diodes and solid state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).10 Among these, multi-branched or star-shaped oligo(arylamines) attract our attention. Star-shaped oligo(arylamines) have a high tendency to adopt an amorphous morphology and can provide more hole hopping pathways.28–30 Up to now, PCEs above 16% are still rare for PSCs using additive- or dopant-free star-shaped arylamines as the HTMs.31–39 Based on our earlier successful synthesis of the 1,4-di(1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzene derivative from the reaction of terephthalaldehyde with 1,2-bis(4-alkyloxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-dione,22 we envisage that star-shaped HTMs with four arylamines can be readily prepared by a similar method if the alkoxy substituents in 1,2-bis(4-alkyloxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-dione are replaced by arylamino substituents. HTMs with a higher number of arylamines should also be possible from the starting materials with three or more aldehyde entities. In view of the easy preparation as well as tunability of the shape and electronic properties of the compounds via the choice of the starting materials bearing formyl groups, we set up to synthesize the desired compounds. To our knowledge, no such compounds as HTMs for PSCs have been reported so far. Herein, we report the syntheses and physical properties of new HTMs, and their application for highly efficient PSCs.
Experimental details
Analytical methods
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 1H and 13C) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300, 400 or 500 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Mass spectra were recorded on 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF and FAB analysers. Elemental analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 CHN analyser. Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Dynamica DB-20 probe and JASCO V-550 UV-vis spectrophotometer, and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out with a CHI-621A electrochemical analyser at room temperature with a conventional three electrode configuration, comprising a platinum working electrode, auxiliary electrode and non-aqueous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The photoelectron–chemical properties of the solar cells were measured at room temperature using an XES-402-CE solar simulator. The thermal properties of the compounds were investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (PerkinElmer Pyris 6 DSC).
Quantum chemistry computation
The computation was performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.40 The B3LYP functional level and 6-311G* basis set were used for the optimization of molecular geometry. Among a number of possible conformations examined for each molecule, the one with the lowest energy was used. The excited states were calculated using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) with the same functional level.
Synthesis of compounds

1,2-Bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)ethane-1,2-dione (OMeTPAdione). 
A two-neck round-bottom flask (flask 1) under a nitrogen atmosphere containing 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzenamine (15.5 g, 40.2 mmol) in THF (70.0 mL) was prechilled to −78 °C. Another two-neck-flask (flask 2) containing 1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,3-dione (2.6 g, 18.3 mmol) in THF (70.0 mL) was also prechilled to −78 °C. n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 24.0 mL, 38.4 mmol) was slowly added into flask 1 and stirred at −78 °C for 3 h. The mixture in flask 1 was then quickly transferred into flask 2 via a cannula, and the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 15 h. The reaction was quenched by slow addition of 10% HCl (150.0 mL) and stirred for another 30 min. The THF was removed using a rotary evaporator, and the aqueous layer was extracted with EA. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 anhydride, filtered, and the solvent of the filtrate was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using DCM as the eluent to give OMeTPAdione as a light-yellow solid (11.3 g, 93%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.72 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 4H), 7.11 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 8H), 6.87 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 8H), 6.78 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 4H), 3.80 (s, 12H) ppm. 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 193.4, 157.3, 154.0, 138.7, 131.7, 128.0, 124.1, 116.6, 115.0, 55.5 ppm.

Fabrication and measurement of PSCs
The fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO, 15 Ω □−1) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried under nitrogen flow. The FTO substrate was then deposited with a layer of c-TiO2, made from three successive spin-coating processes: Ti(iOPr)4 (159 μL)/anhydrous EtOH (2.00 mL), Ti(iOPr)4 (538.00 μL)/anhydrous EtOH (3 mL) and Ti(iOPr)4 (538 μL)/anhydrous EtOH (3 mL). The spin-coating process for each layer was carried out at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds, followed by annealing at 125 °C for 10 minutes. The film was further annealed at 540 °C to form c-TiO2. A mesoporous TiO2 layer (mesoporous TiO2 paste from Sigma mixed with anhydrous EtOH in a mass ratio of 1:7) was then deposited via a spin-coating process at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds, and annealed. The thicknesses of c-TiO2 and m-TiO2 of the ETL layer were measured to be 55 nm and 125 nm, respectively. Next, the active layer, CH3NH3PbI3, was deposited on the top of TiO2via a one-step anti-solvent method: the mixture of PbI2 (576 mg):MAI (207 mg) in DMF (480 mL)/DMSO (160 mL) was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 50 seconds, and after this process, anti-solvent (chlorobenzene) was added while it's spinning. The formed film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The solutions of HTMs (non-doped new HTM based devices: 15 mg dissolved in 1.0 mL of chlorobenzene; spiro-OMeTAD based devices: 30 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 244.12 μL of chlorobenzene with 2.88 μL of t-BP and 12.33 μL of LiTFSI (90 mg dissolved in 530 μL acetonitrile) as additives) were spin-coated on the top of the perovskite layer. The film thickness of c-TiO2, m-TiO2, and the perovskite layer is approximately 30 ± 5 nm, 120 ± 5 nm, and 300 ± 5 nm, respectively, as recorded using the field-emission scanning electron microscope. And the thickness of different HTM layers is approximately 85 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-2A), 50 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-4A, Th-TPA-4A, and Ph-TPA-6A), 35 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-8A), and 250 ± 10 nm (for spiro-OMeTAD). Finally, the electrode composed of MoO3/Ag was vacuum-deposited (pressure <0.03 mTorr) inside the depositing chamber (Kao-Dun vacuum evaporation system) to complete the solar cell construction. The thickness of the electrode was measured to be 8/80 nm. The size of the mask for the evaporation of silver is 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured using a Newport 91192A source-measurement unit under the AM 1.5G light spectrum at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was generated using an approximately 820 W solar simulator (Newport 91192A). The device performance was measured using an Agilent 4156C analyzer. The measurement was performed with a voltage step of 10 mV and scan rate of 1 V s−1. The 100 mW cm−2 light intensity was calibrated using a mono-silicon reference cell (PV Measurements, Inc.), which was pre-calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of imidazole-based arylamines
One-pot reaction of aldehydes with the dione derivative and ammonium acetate in refluxing acetic acid is a convenient synthesis approach for 2,4,5-trisubstituted imidazoles with the two substituents at the dione incorporated at C-4 and C-5 of the imidazole.42 Compounds with at least four arylamines are anticipated to be available via the reaction of the starting material with two or more aldehydes and dione compounds with two arylamines. Indeed, we were able to obtain the desired star-shaped oligo(arylamines) in good yields (85–96%) except for TPE-TPA-8A (28%), as shown in Fig. 1. Methoxy substituents are incorporated at the para-position of arylamine as they can improve the affinity of arylamines with the underlying perovskite layer.9 Compound Ph-TPA-2A without star-shaped conformation was also prepared for comparison. The synthetic routes to the compounds are depicted in Scheme 1. The required arylamine-substituted dione was prepared from 1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,3-dione and 4-bromo-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzenamine according to the method reported for 1,2-bis(4-tert-butyl)-phenylethane-1,2-dione.43

Thermal, photophysical and electrochemical properties
All the compounds are thermally stable with decomposition temperature (Table 1, estimated from TGA at 5% weight loss) above 380 °C, higher than the decomposition temperature (∼300 °C) of the perovskite crystalline material44 and spiro-OMeTAD.45,46 DSC measurements (data collected in Table 1) indicate amorphous nature of the compounds except for Ph-TPA-4A. A melting endotherm was detected for Ph-TPA-4A during the first heating cycle of DSC measurements (Fig. S1†), and only glass transition endotherms were detected for the subsequent cycles. The crystalline nature of pristine Ph-TPA-4A was also confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (Fig. S2†). No melting endotherms were detected for the other compounds, and glass transition endotherms were detected for Ph-TPA-2A and Th-TPA-4A in all heating cycles. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the new compounds are displayed in Fig. 2 and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. Compound Ph-TPA-2A has two intense π–π* bands in the range of 300–360 nm.

Compared with 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine which has only one absorption band (λabs = 297 nm, Fig. S3†), the band at ∼300 nm can be attributed to the localized transition of arylamine, and the one at a longer wavelength is attributed to the delocalized transition involving two arylamines. Ph-TPA-6A has similar characteristic as the three 4,4′-(1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxy-phenyl)-benzenamine) entities reside at mutual meta positions of the central phenyl ring and have negligible interaction among them. In comparison, Ph-TPA-4A and TPE-TPA-8A have broadened spectra in the longer wavelength region, and Th-TPA-4A has a prominent third band at ∼400 nm. This can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The LUMO of the HTMs is mainly contributed by the central core between peripheral arylamines (see Theoretical approach). Accordingly, the central skeleton with better planarity (Th-TPA-4A) or better conjugation (TPE-TPA-8A) will result in a lower-lying LUMO and the ICT from the peripheral arylamine, 4,4′-(1H-imidazole-4,5-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)benzene-amine), to the core will have a longer absorption wavelength. The intensity of the absorption bands at 300–360 nm increases as the number of arylamine/imidazole moieties increases.
The emission wavelength of the compounds (Fig. S4†) decreases in the order of TPE-TPA-8A > Th-TPA-4A > Ph-TPA-4A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-2A, consistent with the trend of the absorption except for TPE-TPA-8A. Possibly the 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene segment adopts more planar geometry at the excited state. The cyclic voltammograms of the compounds are shown in Fig. S5.†Table 1 also lists the electrochemical data obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements. The compounds have at least two quasi-reversible oxidations. Based on Ph-TPA-2A, the first and second waves can be attributed to the removal of the first and second electrons from the two arylamines at the same imidazole moiety, respectively. The most cathodic shift of the first oxidation in Th-TPA-4A may be attributed to the better conjugation of arylamines through the skeleton due to the presence of the more planar and electron excessive thiophene entity (vide infra). This first oxidation potential was used to deduce the HOMO energy level of the compounds. The HOMO levels were also determined from photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S6†) and the values are listed in Table 1. The HOMO levels obtained from the two methods indicate that they are more positive for the perovskite active layer (−5.45 eV),47 which should favour hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer.
Theoretical approach
Density functional theory (DFT) as well as time-dependent DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G* level using the Gaussian 09 program package were carried on the HTMs in order to correlate their molecular structures with the performance of PSCs. The results from the time-dependent approach are summarized in Table S1.† Important ground state dihedral angles for the adjacent entities of the skeleton in the compounds are shown in Fig. S7.† The central phenyl ring (or thienyl ring) and the two neighboring imidazolyl rings in Ph-TPA-4A (or Th-TPA-4A) are close to coplanar with twist angles smaller than 11°. There is a larger twist angle (20.3° to 60.4°) between the imidazolyl rings and the neighboring phenyl rings of the arylamines. Selected frontier orbitals of the HTMs are shown in Fig. 3 and S8.† The HOMO is composed of arylamine extending to the central thienyl ring (or phenyl ring). The thienyl ring in Th-TPA-4A has a more significant contribution than the phenyl ring in Ph-TPA-4A, which is consistent with the slightly higher HOMO of Ph-TPA-4A obtained from electrochemical measurement (vide supra). In contrast, the LUMO is composed of the central phenyl (or thienyl) ring and the two neighboring imidazolyl rings. The S0 → S1 transition was nearly 100% of the HOMO to LUMO transition, indicating that the absorption band of the lowest energy has a significant charge transfer character. The calculated excitation energies for the HTMs are collected in Table S1a to e,† and the corresponding frontier orbital energies are shown in Table S1f.†

Morphology
The morphology of the film with different HTMs was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The top-view SEM images of the thin film of HTMs deposited on the glass substrate are shown in the inset of Fig. 4. Th-TPA-4A had severe aggregation and formed a lot of dots on the thin film surface. Ph-TPA-2A and TPE-TPA-8A also formed some dots on the surfaces. This suggests that these three HTMs may have unfavorable charge transfer/transport properties (vide infra). The images of the device with a structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTM are shown in Fig. 4. All the HTM layers had good coverage on the top of the perovskite film except for Th-TPA-4A. Cross-sectional SEM images of all PSCs capped with different HTMs (Fig. S9†) indicate a good layer-by-layer structure, consistent with top-view SEM images.

The AFM images with the device structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTM are shown in Fig. S10.† The surface roughness of the HTM layer decreases in the order of Th-TPA-4A (6.80 nm) > Ph-TPA-6A (4.52 nm) = TPE-TPA-8A (4.52 nm) > Ph-TPA-2A (3.94 nm) > Ph-TPA-4A (3.29 nm). The higher surface roughness of the HTM layer suggests the possible poorer contacts at the cell interfaces, including the perovskite/HTM and HTM/top electrode interfaces. Ph-TPA-4A has the most uniform and smoothest morphology among all. In comparison, Th-TPA-4A has the roughest surface, which is consistent with its lowest hole mobility (vide infra). Moreover, the hydrophobic properties of the HTM thin films deposited on the glass substrate are observed using a contact angle microscope (Fig. S11†). The contact angles of the HTM thin films decreased as Ph-TPA-4A (88.0°) > Th-TPA-4A (79.8°) ≈ TPE-TPA-8A (79.6°) ≈ Ph-TPA-6A (79.5°) ≈ Ph-TPA-2A (79.1°) > doped spiro-OMeTAD (68.3°), implying that our synthesized HTMs exhibited better waterproof ability than the doped spiro-OMeTAD.
Hole transport and hole transfer properties
As both hole transport inside the HTM and hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM play important roles in the cell efficiency, the hole transport and hole transfer efficiencies were checked by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method30,48 and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching behavior of the perovskite without and with HTMs (vide infra).
The SCLC measurement was based on a device structure of indium doped tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS (∼500 nm)/HTM/MoO3/Ag, where the different HTMs have different film thicknesses around 90 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-2A), 80 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-4A, Th-TPA-4A, and Ph-TPA-6A), 50 ± 10 nm (for Ph-TPA-8A), and 250 ± 10 nm (for spiro-OMeTAD). The SCLC data were collected using an Agilent 4156C analyzer under dark conditions in a N2 glove box. The hole mobility within a HTM layer was calculated from the logJ–logV plots (Fig. 5a) using a classic SCLC model, which exhibits an ohmic region (a first-order J–V correlation) at a low bias and a SCLC region (a second-order J–V correlation) at a high bias. For all HTMs, the ohmic region lies in 0.01–0.25 V, and the SCLC region lies in 0.30–3.00 V, which is reasonably considered as the trap-filled region.27,32,49 The hole mobility (Table 2) obtained according to the Mott–Gurney equation50 decreases in the order of spiro-OMeTAD (5.71 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) > TPE-TPA-8A (3.56 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > Ph-TPA-6A (3.51 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > Ph-TPA-4A (3.46 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > Ph-TPA-2A (3.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > Th-TPA-4A (7.59 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1). The hole mobilities of the new compounds are one order of magnitude lower than that of doped spiro-OMeTAD, and slightly lower than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (0.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).22 It appears that the hole mobility increases as the number of arylamine entities increases, i.e., TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-4A. Obviously a larger number of arylamine units increase hole hopping probability among molecules. Hole hopping rates in amorphous materials are affected by the hopping site energy (energetic disorder) and the intermolecular wavelength overlap (positional disorder).29 Both spiro-OMeTAD and TPE-TPA-8A have a more spherical shape, and likely have a lower degree of positional disorder. The reason for Th-TPA-4A having mobility inferior to that of Ph-TPA-2A can be attributed to its poorer film quality (vide infra).

The steady-state photoluminescence spectra (λex = 488 nm) based on the films with a structure of FTO/perovskite or FTO/perovskite/HTM are shown in Fig. 5b. There is very efficient PL quenching for all HTMs, and the quenching efficiency (i.e., opposite to PL intensity) decreases in the order of Ph-TPA-4A > doped spiro-OMeTAD ≈ TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A. It is understandable that hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM depends on the interfacial arylamine density instead of the total number of arylamine units in the same molecule, and the molecules with a higher number of peripheral amines (Ph-TPA-6A and TPE-TPA-8A) do not necessarily have higher interfacial arylamine density. Less efficient hole transfer for Ph-TPA-2A and Th-TPA-4A may be attributed to the poorer morphology of the film (see SEM images, vide supra).
Electrochemical impedance spectra
Charge recombination behavior within the PSCs (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTMs/MoO3/Ag) was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS, Fig. 5c) analysis using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module. The EIS plots were obtained under an applied bias of −0.9 V in the dark, and the frequency range was set between 1 MHz and 10 mHz with an AC amplitude of ±10 mV. In accordance with the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5c,51,52 the diameter of the first semicircle in the high frequency range referred to the charge recombination resistance at the HTM/top electrode interface (RHTM/electrode), and the diameter of the second semicircle in the medium/low frequency range pointed out the charge recombination resistance at the perovskite/HTM interface (RHTM/perovskite).51,52 The charge resistances for TiO2/perovskite layers and interfaces were merged in the Warburg diffusion region, which were often barely observed. Except for the doped spiro-OMeTAD (85 ohm), all RHTM/electrode values (Table 2) lay in a range of 280 ± 40 ohm, indicating the comparable good contact between HTMs and the top electrode. Some variation in RHTM/electrode may be due to the differences in film thickness and morphology. The RHTM/perovskite values decrease in the order of Ph-TPA-4A > doped spiro-OMeTAD ≈ TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A. A smaller RHTM/perovskite value will cause easier charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface. Film defects (SEM images) and the rough surface (AFM images) may serve as the charge recombination sites. Accordingly, smaller RHTM/perovskite values for Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A may be attributed to their more film defects (SEM images) and rougher surface (AFM images). In comparison, the largest RHTM/perovskite values for Ph-TPA-4A can be attributed to its good crystalline nature, smooth morphology, and the least roughness. Good current density and fill factor for its PSC can be expected (vide infra).
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics
PSCs with a conventional thin film configuration (n–i–p), FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mesoporous-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag, were fabricated by using TiO2, arylamines and MoO3/Ag as the electron extraction material, HTMs and electrode, respectively. The cell using spiro-OMeTAD was also fabricated for comparison. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (EQE) of the cells are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively; the relevant cell performance data are listed in Table 3. The theoretical JSC values, calculated from the product of the EQE value at each wavelength and the photon flux density data obtained from the AM 1.5G solar spectrum (Fig. 6b), are within 15%. The PCE value of the cell decreases in the order of Ph-TPA-4A > doped spiro-OMeTAD > TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A. Except for Th-TPA-4A, the cells based on the star-shaped hole transport materials without dopants have good power conversion efficiencies (13.4–17.40%), which are better than that based on Ph-TPA-2A (12.58%). This points to the potential of star-shaped arylamines as HTMs for perovskite solar cells. Because of the good cell performance of Ph-TPA-4A, up to 40 devices were fabricated to check the reliability of the measurements, and the PCE distribution of the cells is shown in Fig. 6c. Over 50% of the cells have PCEs surpassing the average PCE (17.40 ± 0.43%), and the best PCE reaches 18.00%. These values are significantly better than the PCE (16.11%) of the cell based on LiTFSI/t-BP doped spiro-OMeTAD. Nevertheless, the cells fabricated exhibited different degrees of hysteresis behaviour, as shown in the forward and reverse scans of J–V plots (Fig. S12†). The hysteresis index, HI (PCEreverse/PCEforward),53,54 lay in a range from 1.24 to 1.68 (Table 3). Such behavior may stem from four possible factors: (1) slow transient capacitive current; (2) dynamic trapping and de-trapping processes of charge carriers; (3) band bending due to ion migration, and (d) band bending due to ferroelectric polarization.55 More studies are needed in order to elucidate important factor(s) causing J–V hysteresis.

The cell performance of the PSCs coupled with various HTMs was influenced by several factors: (1) the hole mobility of HTMs, (2) the quenching performance, and (3) the charge recombination at the perovskite/HTM interface. Based on the results of SCLC (hole mobility: doped spiro-OMeTAD > TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-4A > Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A) and PL quenching measurements (quenching efficiency: Ph-TPA-4A > doped spiro-OMeTAD ≈ TPE-TPA-8A > Ph-TPA-6A > Ph-TPA-2A > Th-TPA-4A), it is obvious that a delicate balance between hole transfer and hole mobility is required for good cell performance. Even though Ph-TPA-4A had a moderate mobility, the best PSC of Ph-TPA-4A still provided the highest short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) due to its excellent quenching efficiency, good crystallinity, appropriate interfacial arylamine density, and the smooth morphology of the Ph-TPA-4A film. On the other hand, the highest charge recombination resistance of Ph-TPA-4A resulted in a least dark current and the best cell performance. Moreover, the synthesis costs of our newly designed HTMs were generally lower than 40 $ per g (Fig. S13†), except for TPE-TPA-8A (265.99 $ per g). Ph-TPA-4A having the best PSC performance only costs 10.96 $ per g, which is almost twenty-times lower than the cost of spiro-OMeTAD (∼200 $ per g).56,57 There is no doubt that Ph-TPA-4A is a highly efficient and low-cost HTM. When the common additives of LiTFSI (30 μL) and t-BP (10 μL) were optimally added into the Ph-TPA-4A HTM, the cell performance decreased to 11% (Fig. S14†). Possibly, the packing of Ph-TPA-4A was destroyed upon addition of additives, leading to increased positional disorder.
Because of the high cell performance and low cost of these dopant-free HTMs, a comparison between the new HTMs and representative HTMs with conversion efficiency greater than 14% reported in recent years24,25,31–39,49,58–86 was also made (Table S2†). The reason for setting 14% is because this efficiency could be readily achieved for PSCs based on doped spiro-OMeTAD in many research groups. It is important to note that the cells may use different perovskite materials, different cell structures (conventional or inverted), and be with or without post treatment of the HTM film, and caution should be taken in some cases. The first type of HTMs (type I) possess a planar and rigid skeleton facilitating intermolecular π-stacking for vertical hole conduction and intramolecular hole transport even without the presence of the pyramidal arylamine entity, a common hole transporter. Compounds PdMe2Pc (Pd phthalocyanine),733F-br-4C (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dipyrrole core),75PCA-1 (diacenaphtho[1,2 b:1′,2′-d]thiophenen core),24 and CuPc-OBu (copper(II) phthalocyanine core)25 belong to this category. Strong intermolecular π-stacking interaction can also be achieved in D–A type compounds (A = electron acceptor; D = electron donor) due to their planar skeleton and dipolar character. Examples include one-dimensional compounds, M7-TFSi (A–D–A: D = benzodithiophene; A = benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole),67DFBT(DTS-FBTTh2)2 (D′–A–D–A–D–A–D′; D = silolodithiophene; D′ = bithiophene; A = benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole),68ACE-QA-ACE (A–D–A: D = 1,2-dihydroacenaphthylene; A = dihydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridine-7,14-dione)69 and DERDTS-TBDT (A–D–A: D = benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene; A = 3-alkyl rodanine),70 and two-dimensional compounds, KR321 (D–(π–A)3: D = dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole; A = malononitrile)39 and FA-CN (D–(π–A)3: D = quinolizino acridine; A = malononitrile).59 The structure of type I HTMs bears close resemblance to that used for organic field-effect transistors.26 They normally have a relatively higher hole mobility of >10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the vacuum-deposited PdMe2Pc73 has an impressive mobility of 3.42 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The second type of HTMs (type II) have a one-dimensional skeleton of D–π–D where D is an arylamine donor. Normally a rigid π segment such as fused aromatics has better cell performance as this segment helps with intermolecular π-stacking for the hole transport pathway in addition to hole hopping via arylamine. Examples include mDPA-DBTP (π = di(1-benzothieno)[3,2 b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole),60BTF4 (π = 2,3-dicyano-fluoranthene),61TPA-ANT-TPA (π = anthanthrone),62YN2 (π = cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene),63Z34 (π = N-phenyl-4-vinyl-N-(4-vinylphenyl)benzenamine),71IDTT-TPA (π = methoxytriphenylamine-substituted indacenodithienothiophene),79X44 (π = fluorine with dangling ammonium),80CMO (π = carbazole),82IDTC6-TPA (π = indacenodithiophene)84 and M104 (π = 5,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine),85 and the hole mobility is in the range of 10−5 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The third type of HTMs (type III) are star-shaped molecules with oligo(arylamines). Congeners of spiro-OMeTAD such as X62 (π = spiro-[dibenzo[c,h]xanthene-7,9′-fluorene])76 and Spiro-S (π = spiro-fluorene)77 belong to this category. They have better hole mobility than pristine spiro-OMeTAD. Other star-shaped molecules include Trux-OMeTAD (π–(D)3: π = truxene),31TTE-2 (π–(D)4: π = semi-locked tetrathienylethene),38HTB-OMe (π–(D)6: π = hexathienylbenzene),34TPP-SMeTAD (π–(D)4: π = 1,4-dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetraphenylbenzene),842,7-BCz-OMeTAD (π–(D)4: π = N,N′-bicarbazole),37m-MTDATA (4,4′,4′′-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine),35,36TPD-4MeOTPA (π–(D)4: π = para-biphenyl),81TCP-OH (π–(D)3: π = 2,4,6 tri-substituted phenol)33 and LD-29 (3,6,9 tri-substituted carbazole).86 They have hole mobilities ranging from 10−5 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and compounds with a more planar π core (Trux-OMeTAD and TTE-2) have higher mobility. It is interesting to note that incorporation of ionic moieties into the HTM molecules using TFSI (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) as the anion significantly increases the hole mobility of M7-TFSI67 and X4480 compared to their congeners with different ions due to the good conductivity of TFSI. It is also worth noting that V1036 capable of forming a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)64 allows formation of dopant-free hole-selective contacts in p–i–n PSCs, leading to an impressive PCE of 17.8%. The hole mobility (10−6 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of HTMs in this study is slightly higher than that (10−7 to 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) of star-shaped HTMs,33 which also have high PCE (>15%). However, they have significantly lower hole mobility than star-shaped HTMs cored with benzene or thiophene (10−4 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)45 and tetraphenylethene (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)87 for doped lead-based PSCs and dopant-free tin-based PSCs, respectively. Possibly efficient interfacial hole transfer (Ph-TPA-4A) plays an important role in the high performance of our HTMs. The PCE reported here is also among the best for perovskite solar cells using non doped HTMs.24,25,31,34–39,58–69
Stability tests
The at-rest stability tests of the cells based on Ph-TPA-4A and spiro-OMeTAD with dopants were measured in a N2 glove box with 3–10 day intervals by using an Agilent 4156C analyser. Before every measurement, the solar irradiation was calibrated to 1 sun using a mono-silicon reference cell. The cells were subjected to a continuous J–V curve scan back and forth under 1 sun until the cells reached a steady-state; this process took about 1 min. After that, the best J–V curves for the cells on that day were collected and calculated to obtain the photovoltaic parameters as summarized in Fig. 7a. Between the tests, the cells were kept under dark in a N2 glove box, which had a water content lower than 1 ppm and oxygen content lower than 20 ppm. In Fig. 7a, the cell of spiro-OMeTAD decayed rapidly and the PCE dropped to ∼2% of the original value after 25 days. Both JSC and FF values also dropped dramatically, while VOC retained ∼93% of the original value (Fig. S15(a–c)†). In comparison, the cell PCE of Ph-TPA-4A retained ∼90% of the original value after 25 days (Fig. 7a). The three parameters, VOC, JSC and FF values, all retained >90% after 25 days. The better stability of the cell based on Ph-TPA-4A can be attributed to waiving of the hydrophilic dopants, as evidenced by the larger contact angles of new HTMs on glass (vide supra).
 Fig. 7  (a) At-rest stability tests for PSCs in a N2 glove box; (b) continuous light-soaking stability tests for Ph-TPA-4A PSCs in a N2 glove box and in air. 
Other stability tests were carried out under continuous light soaking (1 sun) for 600 s in a N2 glove box (Fig. 7b) or in air (Fig. 7b). When measuring in N2, the cell based on Ph-TPA-4A appeared to have unfailing stability over the 600 s, and the VOC, JSC, and FF plots are shown in Fig. S15(d–f).† When measuring in air, the cell based on Ph-TPA-4A dropped ∼45% of its initial cell efficiency in 600 s, and VOC, JSC, and FF all decreased, as shown in Fig. S15(d–f).†
Conclusions
New star-shaped imidazolyl entity-based oligo(arylamines) have been synthesized via a simple synthetic protocol in good yields. These compounds can be used as non-doped hole transport materials for efficient perovskite solar cells with a conventional configuration. The best PCE reached ∼17.5%, which surpassed that based on LiTFSI/t-BP doped spiro-OMeTAD. The cell also exhibited much better temporal stability compared with the standard cell of LiTFSI/t-BP doped spiro-OMeTAD. The molecular design strategy used here should be applicable to more rigid and flat π-segments such as pyrene. Replacement of the OMeTPA unit in OMeTPAdione with other potential hole transport units, or conversion of N–H to N–alkyl for new sets of HTMs should also be possible. The work aiming at alleviating hysteresis will also be carried out in future.
