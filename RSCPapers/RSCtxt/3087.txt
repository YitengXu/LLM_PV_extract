The doped Cs2CO3 as a cathode interfacial layer is successfully used in poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)/indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) heterojunction based solar cells with improved open-circuit voltage and unaffected short-circuit current density. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evaluation was conducted to verify the formation of the new composites of W–O–Cs and Mo–O–Cs after doping of MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 into Cs2CO3. The change of the work function of MoO3- and/or Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 was further confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted more and more attention because of their light weight, low cost, easy manufacturing process and flexibility.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells based on blends of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives has reached 9.0%.2 Recently, a world record PCE of 12% for small molecule solar cells on a standard size of 1.1 cm2 has been reported by Heliatek GmbH.3 In order to improve the cell efficiency, different methods such as the synthesis of low-band gap polymers to better match the solar spectrum,4 the application of light trapping geometries in the active layer,5 the optimization of film morphology,6 and the electrode interfacial engineering,7–10 have been proposed. Among them, the electrode interface engineering, which can effectively improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc) by modifying the interface between the active layer and the electrode, has received more and more attention.11,12Voc is one of the key parameters for the cell performance in bulk heterojunction OSCs. Various aspects such as different donor and acceptor systems,13,14 interfacial morphology,15,16 the work function of electrodes17–20 and optical intensities21,22 have been investigated to clarify the main factors of the Voc. From current understanding, Voc in the bulk heterojunction OSCs depends on two conditions. For ohmically contacted (between the electrode and the active layer) devices, Voc is mainly dependent on the energy level offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor (EDHOMO − EALUMO).23–25 If the contact is non-ohmic, the Voc is determined by the difference in the work functions of two electrodes. Nevertheless, the factors that determine the Voc are not yet completely understood.26,27
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) has been extensively used as an interfacial material in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and/or OSCs owing to its good electron injection ability.28–30 Cs2CO3 can also be solution-processed as an effective electron injection layer in inverted OSCs because of its good solubility in polar solvents such as water and alcohol. Additionally, Cs2CO3 is commonly used as a doping material for the electron injection layer in organic electronic devices.31 Recently, it was reported that the work function of Cs2CO3 can be effectively adjusted owing to the formation of Cs-included composites through doping.32,33
In addition, suitable electrical doping in inorganic and organic materials is very efficient for resolving the issues of conductivity, carrier mobility and carrier barriers in semiconductor electronics.34,35 In this work, we have further investigated the effects of Cs-included composites on the work function of Cs2CO3 by doping molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and/or sodium tungstate (Na2WO4). The aqueous solution-processed and doped Cs2CO3 were successfully used in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) based bulk heterojunction OSCs. Compared with non-doped devices, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved from 3.27% to 5.25% with increased Voc and unchanged short-circuit current (Jsc). The modified interface by MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 doped Cs2CO3 and the Cs-included composites were investigated by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) respectively, to deeply understand the origin of the improved Voc.
Experimental
The P3HT and IC60BA were both obtained from Luminescence Technology Corp. (Taiwan); PC61BM, Cs2CO3, MoO3, and Na2WO4 were produced by Nichem Fine Technology Co. Ltd. (Taiwan), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (product of J&K Chemical, China) was used to dissolve the polymers and the derivatives of fullerenes. The inverted OSCs were fabricated with the structures of ITO/Cs2CO3 (with and without doped MoO3 or Na2WO4)/P3HT:IC60BA (150 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Al (100 nm). Cs2CO3 was solution-processed with deionized water using different concentrations. The P3HT:IC60BA photoactive layer was spin-casted from o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution composed of 15 mg ml−1 P3HT and 15 mg ml−1 IC60BA and annealed on a hot plate at 130 °C for 10 min. MoO3 and Al films were thermally evaporated at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a programmable Keithley 2612 source-meter under AM 1.5G (AM = air mass) irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The film morphology of Cs2CO3 based cathode interfacial layers was evaluated using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Multimode V). The work function of doped Cs2CO3 and the Cs-included composites was evaluated by UPS (with an unfiltered He I (21.2 eV) gas discharge lamp and a hemispherical analyzer) and XPS (with a monochromatic aluminum Kα source (1486.6 eV)) under a Kratos AXIS UltraDLD ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system.
Results and discussion
Surface topography

Fig. 1 shows AFM images of surface morphologies of doped and undoped Cs2CO3 films with varied concentrations. With the increase of Cs2CO3 concentration from 0.1 mg ml−1 to 5.0 mg ml−1, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreased from 3.78 nm to 3.43 nm. The high RMS of the interfacial layer on ITO may associate with the large roughness of bare ITO. In addition, the thickness of 0.1 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 is about 5 nm, which is larger than the RMS of the ITO substrates. Therefore, the ITO substrates can be fully covered with the interfacial layer. After coating with the interfacial layer, the RMS can be lowered from 4.5 nm (bare ITO) to 3.13 nm (coated with a Na2WO4 doped Cs2CO3 interfacial layer). The RMS of Cs2CO3 does not strongly depend on the Cs2CO concentration (from 3.78 nm for 0.1 mg ml−1 to 3.43 nm for 5 mg ml−1). After doping 10% MoO3 aqueous solution (with a concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1) into 5.0 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 solution, the RMS dropped to 3.34 nm. Noticeably, a further decrease in RMS occurred when doping 10% Na2WO4 aqueous solution (with a concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1) into 5.0 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 solution. This means that the interface between Cs2CO3-modified ITO and the active layer could be effectively smoothed by Na2WO4 doping. The relatively smooth surface morphology makes it possible for the formation of a good interface contact between ITO and the active layer.36

The detailed cell parameters are summarized in Table 1 and ESI S1.† The reference device without any buffer layer showed a PCE of 3.14%. By inserting the Cs2CO3 interfacial layer, PCE was improved from 3.27% (0.1 mg ml−1) to 4.43% (5.0 mg ml−1). Noticeably, Voc was increased from 0.59 V to 0.71 V with nearly unchangeable Jsc.

The increased Voc is assumed to be the modification effect of Cs2CO3 on ITO owing to the formation of more Cs atoms at a high Cs2CO3 concentration, which could be confirmed by the changes of the energy level. These details will be discussed later. 10% MoO3 and Na2WO4 aqueous solutions with a concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1 were doped into the 5.0 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 solution respectively, to tune the cathode interface. The MoO3-doped device showed a PCE of 4.89%, with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 12.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 52%. From Table 1, we can see that the low FF is associated with the series resistance (Rs) since all the devices presented large values of Rs (>10 Ω). It suggests that the electrode interface contact was not very good. By AFM confirmation, the roughness of ITO we used is large with a value of about 4.5 nm (ESI†). The value of parallel resistance (Rp) also had some influence on FF but no influence on Voc. For example, 0.1 mg ml−1 and 1.0 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 based devices presented similar Voc but different parallel resistances, 5.0 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 devices with or without doping have similar parallel resistance but different Voc. It means that the value of parallel resistance had nothing to do with the change of Voc. We assumed that the changes of Voc are mainly attributed to the variation of the work function of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and/or sodium tungstate (Na2WO4) doped Cs2CO3.
The increased Voc is attributed to the formation of the composite of Mo–O–Cs owing to the doping of MoO3 into Cs2CO3. The MoO3-doped interfacial layer with the Mo–O–Cs complex has an even lower work function than decomposed Cs2CO3. It has been reported that the formation of element-O–Cs structures, such as C–O–Cs, W–O–Cs, Si–O–Cs, and Ga–O–Cs, is essential for obtaining a low-work-function (or negative-work-function) surface.32,37–40 Therefore, we assumed that the MoO3-doped interfacial layer with the Mo–O–Cs complex has an even lower work function than pure Cs2CO3. Noticeably, in the case of Na2WO4 doping, PCE is enhanced to 5.25% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 12.49 mA cm−2 and a FF of 52%. In order to check the device reproducibility, more than 10 Na2WO4-doped devices were examined under the same conditions. The maximum and average PCEs were 5.40% and 5.25%, respectively, which suggest that the doping of Na2WO4 into Cs2CO3 can effectively improve the cell performance. Similarly, the large increase in Voc is also attributed to the formation of the W–O–Cs composite in the Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 interlayer.
Interface evaluations
To clearly understand the increase of Voc in MoO3 and/or Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 based OSCs, UPS measurements were performed to investigate the changes of work function of the doped and undoped Cs2CO3 interfacial layers. Here, we use an effective work function31,38 to describe the surface properties of solution-processed Cs2CO3 films with or without doping since we could not find the Fermi level edge clearly. The UPS spectra of solution-processed Cs2CO3 and composite films are shown in Fig. 3. The relationship between the effective work function and Voc with varied Cs2CO3 concentrations is shown in Fig. 4. We can see that the effective work function of pure Cs2CO3 decreased from 3.41 eV to 2.82 eV with the increase in Cs2CO3 concentration, which results in an increase Voc in three film based devices from 0.59 V to 0.71 V. We attribute these changes to the effective modification of ITO by generation of more Cs when an increased concentration of Cs2CO3 solution is spin-coated on the ITO surface. In the cases of low Cs2CO3 concentration (0.1 mg ml−1), Voc in the MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 doped devices almost had the same values as that of the pure Cs2CO3 based device. Noticeably, an increase of effective work function of these doped Cs2CO3 films was observed. Since so little Cs can act with Mo and/or W in a low Cs2CO3 concentration, the Mo–O–Cs and/or W–O–Cs composites could not be formed effectively. In addition, the doping of 10% MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 solution (0.1 mg ml−1) into 0.1 mg ml−1 Cs2CO3 solution acts to dilute the Cs2CO3 solution to some extent, which results in an increased effective work function in those doped Cs2CO3 films.

 Fig. 4  The effective work function and Voc of different concentrations of Cs2CO3 with and without doping MoO3 or Na2WO4. 
Upon increasing the Cs2CO3 concentration, such as to 1.0 mg ml−1, the effective work function was lowered by doping Na2WO4 into Cs2CO3, which leads to a remarkable increase of Voc from 0.61 V to 0.71 V. Conversely, there exists no large change for the MoO3-doped case. This suggests a stronger chemical reaction ability of W–Cs than that of Mo–Cs. Also, the dilution effect of 10% MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 solution (0.1 mg ml−1) on Cs can be neglected for 1.0 mg ml−1 or larger Cs2CO3 concentrations. With a further increase of the Cs2CO3 concentration to 5.0 mg ml−1, there is enough Cs reacting with W and/or Mo despite the weak chemical reaction ability of Mo with Cs. The high concentration of Cs2CO3 leads to the effective formation of W–O–Cs and Mo–O–Cs composites in MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 doped Cs2CO3. From the OSC performance, Voc is increased owing to the lowering of effective work function in doped Cs2CO3 films (5.0 mg ml−1). In particular, the Na2WO4-doping based device demonstrated a Voc of 0.81 V, resulting in a higher PCE of 5.25% compared to the undoped device (0.71 V, 4.43%).
In order to confirm the formation of W–O–Cs and Mo–O–Cs composites, XPS spectra of O 1s (as shown in Fig. 5(a) for the MoO3-doped case and (b) for the Na2WO4-doped case) in the pure doping films, the pure Cs2CO3 film, and the doped Cs2CO3 films (5.0 mg ml−1) were recorded. The C 1s core level (locates in 284.5 eV) was used to calibrate all peaks. From Fig. 5(a), we can see that the O 1s peak of the MoO3-doped Cs2CO3 film is located between the O 1s peaks of the pristine MoO3 film and the Cs2CO3 film. Similarly, the O 1s peak of the Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 film is also located between the O 1s peaks of the pristine Na2WO4 film and the Cs2CO3 film as shown in Fig. 5(b). In addition, shoulder peaks were clearly observed in both MoO3- and Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 films, which generally indicated that the new composite will be produced. As a result, the formation of composites of Mo–O–Cs and W–O–Cs can be confirmed from the O 1s XPS evaluations.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a work-function tuneable, aqueous solution-processed Cs2CO3 film by MoO3 and/or Na2WO4 doping. A high PCE of 5.25% has been realized in P3HT:IC60BA based heterojunction OSCs by using Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 as the cathode interfacial layer. The improved PCE is mainly attributed to the large increase of Voc owing to the lowering of the effective work function of MoO3- and/or Na2WO4-doped Cs2CO3 interfacial layers. This is reflected by the UPS measurements. From the XPS evaluations, the decrease in the effective work function originates from the generation of Mo–O–Cs and/or W–O–Cs composites by doping. The doping process can be easily controlled since an aqueous solution processing is used. This new approach provides a route to obtain high-performance OSCs on the basis of simplified fabrication processing and will allow for the economizing of large scale applications.
