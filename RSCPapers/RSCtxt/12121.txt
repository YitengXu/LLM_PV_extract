    , Accepted 11th August 2022First published on 15th August 2022AbstractThe use of perovskites in photovoltaic and related industries has achieved tremendous success over the last decade. However, there are still obstacles to overcome in terms of boosting their performance and resolving stability issues for future commercialization. The introduction of a new 2D material of halide perovskites is now the key advancement in boosting the solar energy conversion efficiency. The implication of a new 2D material (MXene) in perovskite solar cells has been initiated since its first report in 2018, showing excellent transparency, electrical conductivity, carrier mobility, superior mechanical strength, and tunable work function. Based on distinctive features at the hetero-interface, halide perovskite and MXene heterostructures (HPs/Mx) have recently exhibited exceptional improvements in both the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the wide families of HPs and MXene materials allow playing with the composition and functionalities of HP/Mx interfaces by applying rational designing and alterations. In this review a comprehensive study of implementing MXenes in perovskite solar cells is presented. First, the implementation of MXenes in perovskites as an additive, and then in charge extraction layers (HTL/ETL), is described in detail. It is worth noting that still only Ti3C2Tx, Nb2CTx,V2CTx MXene is being incorporated into perovskite photovoltaics. Finally, the present obstacles in the use of MXenes in PSCS are discussed, along with the future research potential. This review is expected to provide a complete and in-depth description of the current state of research and to open up new opportunities for the study of other MXenes in PSCs.
1. Introduction
With a fast-growing population and expanding global energy consumption, it is becoming increasingly important to assure a continuous energy supply. The existing way of life which involves generating energy by burning fossil fuels has resulted in major problems such as increased air pollution and global warming.1–5 Thus, the development of environmentally acceptable green energy as a fossil fuel alternative is highly desirable. Solar energy is referred to as a prime component of green energy production.6 Due to its premium efficiency, low cost, abundant supply, and long-term sustainability, solar energy has been presented as a viable solution to the energy problem and environmental concerns.7–12
Perovskite solar cells are one of the most extensively studied topics of third-generation photovoltaics because of the rapid rise in power conversion from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.8% in 2021.13–18 In typical PSCs, the photoactive perovskite material is sandwiched between two charge transport layers, which are then positioned adjacent to their respective electrodes in typical cells as shown in Fig. 1a and b, which represent a simple cubic perovskite crystal structure. However, with power conversion efficiency (PCE) value close to that of single junction silicon and thin film solar cells has already been achieved, research is now focused on solving the issues relating their commercial deployment, e.g., factors limiting their long-term stability and efficiency. These critical issues in PSCs are mainly due to the presence of many defects, pin holes and improper band alignments in/at the perovskite layer and at the interfaces of various charge extraction layers. Furthermore, the main characteristics of a long carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, and broad absorption coefficient in perovskite solar cells are also highly dependent on the quality of beneficial interfacial interactions with the photoactive perovskite as well as in the charge transfer layers.19–22 To deal with these issues currently there are many processing approaches in which 2D materials are now employed in the perovskite absorbing layer as well as in the charge extraction layers in PSCs, to improve the compatibility at the interfaces, which has striking impacts on the morphology and photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells.22–29 Nanomaterials with a thickness of at least one atomic layer are known as two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. Many different types of 2D material30,31 have been used as charge transport materials in PSCs or as additives in perovskite layers to boost the power conversion efficiency and stability.32,33 This review paper summarizes the history, synthesis, and various properties of MXenes, as well as all previously published studies on integrating MXenes into perovskite solar cells to improve solar energy generation and stability, beginning in 2018.

1.1. MXene and its compatible properties for various PSC layers
A new member of 2D materials, MXene, was first discovered by Gogotsi's group,34 and these have been widely explored in various fields including electromagnetic applications,35–38 light-emitting diodes,39–41 biomedical fields,42,43 water purification,44–49 energy storage,50–56 catalysis,57–60 and sensors61–65 and have shown auspicious application in photovoltaics very recently.66–73 The discovered 2D material MXenes are suitable candidates for interfacial layers or as an additive in the active layers of PSCs, relying on superior optoelectronic characteristics, great conductivity (2.0 × 104 S cm−1), high carrier density (3.8 × 1022 cm−3), and high carrier mobility (1 cm2 V−1 s−1).74 These 2D material have unique features as ionic materials that graphene and other 2D materials lack.75 They could be the successors to the widely used silicon wafers in electronic devices, such as solar panels, due to the indirect band gap nature of silicon, which requires a greater percentage of the material to be use for a higher absorption of light. They produce efficient photoluminescence, and the amount of light emitted may be regulated by altering the sheet thickness and creating heteroatom vertical structures with the right compositions. MXenes have the generic formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1, 2, 3), where M denotes an early transition metal, X denotes C and/or N, and Tx denotes the surface attachment (e.g. OH, O, and F). The presence of C/N or both C and N atoms led to the classification of MXenes into 3 major families referred to as carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides respectively (Fig. 1c).76 Although nitrides and carbonitrides MXene are also under investigation a lot of research work is done on carbides, specifically on Ti3C2 because of its attractive electrical and optical properties, making it a suitable candidate for optoelectronic devices.
MXene surfaces are spontaneously functionalized during synthesis, changing the electrostatic potential at the surfaces and affecting the electronic structures, resulting in a dramatic shift in the WF. Surface termination has a large impact on the density of states and the WF of MXene,77 ranging from 1.6 eV to 6.25 eV for –OH and –O terminations, respectively, as anticipated by density functional theory. This wide range of available classes and work function tuning opens new and a variety of MXene applications in various layers of perovskite solar cells.51,78
1.2. MAX phase and extraction of MXene from the parent MAX phase (exfoliation followed by delamination)
Two-dimensional MXene sheets are basically derived from the MAX phases. The layered MAX phases are a class of polycrystalline nanolaminate tertiary transition metal nitrides or carbides that are stacked together. MAX phases are highly anisotropic hexagonal crystal structures composed of exclusive and uncommon mixes of ceramics and metals.79 Mn+1AXn is the common general formula used to denote polycrystalline nanolaminate MAX phases. The starting metal elements of transition metal series (M) and nitrogen/carbon (X) result in octahedral edge-shared units (MX) that interlock with (A)-type element layers and can form a variety of stacking arrangements recognized as subcategories in MAX phases. These subgroups are denoted by the symbols M2AX, M3AX2, M4AX3, and M5AX4.80 After years of research, Barsoum and El-Raghy produced a titanium silicon carbide phase (Ti3SiC2) for the first time in the mid-1990s using a facile heat-sintering procedure and labeled it as the (312) phase.
There are over 70 possible MAX phase combinations, with Ti3AlC2 being one of the most advantageous and potentially researched. MXene sheets can be synthesized by removing the (A)-type atom from the precursor phases; the synthesized material is usually denoted by the formula Mn+1XnTx; here M is representing an starting element of the transition series, X can be nitrogen or carbon, n can be a number from 1–4, and the surface functional moieties are represented by Tx that shows after the (A) atoms are removed. Hence, a subsequent reduction of the (A)-type atom layer from the MAX phases gives a range of MXenes classified as the M2X1, M3X2, M4X3, and M5X4 phases, as shown in the MXene periodic table (Fig. 1c).
Due to the robust connection between the A and M atoms, it is not viable to mechanically exfoliate MAX phases into MX layers.81 However, because metallic M–A interactions are more reactive than covalent and/or ionic M–X connections in the Mn+1AXn phase, careful etching of the (A) layer using electrochemical chemicals or by other means is relatively plausible.80 Numerous etching techniques, including fluorine (F)-comprising acids, such as HCl-LiF or HF,34,82 hydrothermal alkaline treatment,83,84 molten salt,83 electrochemical etching with HCl or TMAOH/NH4Cl,84,85 and chemical etching in the presence of Lewis acids, e.g. ZnCl2, can be used in this regard.86–88 Wet chemical etching with HF or HCl–LiF is the most widely used and proficient method for improving MAX phase exfoliation. The HF interaction with the MAX phase, for instance the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, is a thermodynamically favourable reaction in wet etching, and HF can react with the Al layer, creating AlF3, and creating Ti3C2 (Fig. 1e). Additionally, the etching process is the order of processes that results in two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx multilayer nanosheets. Following the HF etching procedure, a variety of moieties, including Ti3C2(OH)2 and Ti3C2F2, were generated as a result of the creation of surface functional groups (e.g., OH, F, and O).87,89 The SEM annotations revealed an accordion-like shape in multilayer nanosheets, indicating successful etching of the Al layers from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, which was validated by scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS (Fig. 1d).90 But, due to their limited selectivity and etch-ability, the inability to produce stable two-dimensional structures, the poor-quality flakes of two-dimensional MXenes, and the demand for extraordinary temperatures during the etching process, the rest of the exfoliation approaches other than wet etching are not deemed advantageous. For instance, a molten salt (fluoride treatment) at 550 °C is necessary to exfoliate Ti4AlN3 and produce Ti4N3 MXene.88,90 The MXene formed via HF processing forms accordion-like multilayer MXenes that can be next delaminated mechanically;91,92 nevertheless, the intercalation of a chemical can hasten the delamination process, therefore separating the nanolayers. A compatible solvent can be employed, for example tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, n-butylamine, dimethyl sulfoxide, hydrazine or urea.92–94 MXenes may be produced in large quantities via liquid delamination in organic solvents, but that has disadvantages.95
1.3. Chemical and electronic properties, and oxidation-degradation of MXenes
MXenes exhibit an array of remarkable structural, electrical, and chemical features. Their superior features, which include mobility, high electrical conductivity, surface terminal groups, and customizable chemistry, have attracted considerable interest in photovoltaic cell applications.98 Modeling MXene building units is critical for comprehending the structural changes that occur when the physical conditions change.99 The surface terminal moieties might be positioned above the hollow terminals residing within three neighbouring carbon atoms, according to studies. Nonetheless, subsequent research has revealed that the orientation and position of these functional moieties are more complicated than previously thought.100 The specific configuration of MXene species is determined by their constituent materials. Typically, MXenes are modelled using homogenous-ending species that are not typical. Exfoliation of MXene sheets from the MAX phase by HF results in the formation of F, O, and OH surface-ended species in the actual state; and when the MXene is rinsed and/or stored in H2O, OH replaces F, which is the reason that O- and OH-surface-terminated groups are generally referred as the utmost stable surface groups. Additionally, Xie et al. discovered that hydroxyl (OH) groups were changed to O terminal atoms after high-temperature and/or metal adsorption treatment of MXene.101
Chemically, MXene flakes degrade rapidly in an oxygen-rich atmosphere or when open to the sun-light, which accelerates the oxidation process of the colloidal mixture and results in the creation of nanocrystals of MO (metal oxide) on the edges of the MXene sheets. For instance, in titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene, the anatase phase of the TiO2 nanocrystals may develop as a result of oxidation in pressured water, CO2, or the atmosphere,102 although dry air or degassed water may be adequate for storing single MXene flakes for an extended period of time.103 Different types of TiO2 can be synthesized under various oxidation conditions of Ti3C2. Zhengyang et al. investigated the MXene oxidation process utilising in situ TEM analysis.104 O2 combines with Ti3C2Tx in the air to generate TiO2, which can be either rutile or anatase. With a peculiar hybrid structure of TiO2C, the homogenous dispersal of newborn TiO2 nano-crystals on the surface of two-dimensional Ti3C2T layers was discovered. Additionally, heat treatment can result in the formation of anatase TiO2 at the increased temperature, which can then transition into rutile.
1.4. Work function tuning (alterations in semiconductive, conductive and superconductive behaviours of MXenes)
Numerous MXene members exhibit outstanding conductivity; for example, Ti3C2Tx MXene has a conductivity of up to 2.0 × 104 S cm−1, a mobility of 1 cm−2 V−1 s−1, and a charge carrier density of 3.8 × 1022 cm3.105 Further various experimental and theoretical research has established that virgin MXene, e.g. Tin+1Xn, shows metallic characteristics, which weaken in strength as additional TiX bonds are created, such that the metallic nature of titanium nitride (Tin+1NnTx) is stronger than that of Tin+1CnTx, due to the nitrogen atom possessing one extra electron over the carbon atom.105 Additionally, the metallic characteristics of MXenes can be modified by modifying the terminating functional groups and substituting other metals for M in the chemical structure.93 The majority of MXene sheets are highly conductive, if not superconductive; e.g., Nb2CTx (Tx = NH, Se, or S) and Mo2C are superconductive.106,107 Talapin et al. worked on the structural and electrical characteristics of Ti2CTx and Ti3C2Tx MXene adorned with telluride (Te2) ligands. With Te2 ligand termination (ending groups), an in-plane lattice expansion of greater than eighteen percent was reported, which was significantly more than the lattice expansion of bare Ti3C2. Additionally, they compared Nb2CTx MXene surfaces terminated with S, Se, and NH, as well as MXenes functionalized with O, OH, and F terminal groups, and discovered that the temperature resistance and conductivity are strongly related to the structure and composition of the MXene sheets.107 Furthermore, the MXene's surface engineering is projected to have a significant impact on practically all characteristics of 2D MXenes comprising electronic mobility. Ren et al.108 worked on the chemical vapour deposition fabrication of layers of –Mo2C crystals with a dimension of 100 m and a thickness of a few nanometers (CVD). These –Mo2C crystals demonstrated layer-dependent superconducting changeovers, compatible with Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless behaviour, as well as significant anisotropy with magnetic field orientation. Additionally, superconductivity is significantly correlated with crystal thickness. Along with their conductivity, a number of MXenes with appropriate surface ending groups are anticipated to show semiconductor-like behaviors. For instance, Kawazoe et al. expected that Sc2C, Ti2C, Zr2C, and Hf2C MXenes would exhibit semiconducting characteristics.93 Subsequent study established that Mo2CTx behaves similarly to a semiconductor.109 More recently, it was revealed that o-MXene exhibits semiconductor-like behaviour; for example, Mo2TiC2Txo-MXene is formed by substituting Mo for the outer Ti layers of Ti3C2Tx, converting the metallic behaviour of Ti3C2Tx to semiconductor-like behavior. The substitution of M has also been observed to have an effect on the magnetic characteristics of MXenes. For example, Ti3C2Tx exhibits antiferromagnetic properties, but when the outer and intermediate Ti layers in Ti3C2Tx are replaced with Cr and Mn, respectively, the Cr2TiC2Tx and TiMn2C2Txo-MXenes exhibit ferromagnetic properties.91,108 MXenes’ semiconductive, conductive, and superconductive properties are completely determined by their surface functional groups. Without surface terminations, all MXenes should act like metallic conductors, with transition metals serving as charge carriers.111 In contrast to normal metals, DOS and Fermi levels in MXenes are projected to alter as a result of the surface functional moieties; hence, variations in the work functions, the bandgap opening, and variations in the exterior of the semiconductor features are also predicted to occur in some MXenes other than Ti3C2Tx.92 As previously stated, the superconducting transition of Nb2CTx MXene occurs due to the surface termination of the compound with NH, S, and Se terminal groups. Nb2CTx adorned with an O-terminus, on the other hand, did not display superconductive properties. Additionally, the intercalation of organic or inorganic cations into 2D multilayer MXenes during the layer separation process has an effect on the electronic characteristics of the MXene. For instance, the existence of TBA+ in the MXene interlayers may impair interlayer electron bouncing, lowering the conductivity of the MXene films. Intercalation tends to retain a higher conductivity and a smaller interlayer spacing in the case of inorganic alkali metal ions.110
2. Role of MXene in perovskite solar cells
By utilising all of an MXene's extraordinary and tunable features, it raises the likelihood of resolving all of the problems associated with perovskite solar cells, such as pin holes, defect concentrations, and inappropriate band alignment between the layers. Perovskite solar cells usually comprise an absorber layer sandwiched between two charge-carrying layers; all the layers and layer interfaces within a perovskite solar cell must be compatible with each other, in order to achieve good power conversion. Carrier mobility, energy barriers, bandgap alignment, and interfacial vacancies are all factors that influence compatibility and, as a result, cell performance and stability. Consequently, designing well-suited cell interfaces is critical for cell success and long-term stability, which is a key factor for prospective commercialization. Due to the robust coupling interactions between halide perovskites (HPs) and MXene properties, HP/M material heterostructures can be produced both by directly blending the MXene in the perovskite layer and at the interface of the perovskite active layer with the charge transfer layer. This part discusses the functions of MXenes as additives in perovskite active layers, as well as the MXene materials utilized for interfacial layers HTL/ETL in PSCs. Fig. 2 shows the overall role of MXenes in various layers of PSCs.

2.1. MXenes as additives in the absorber layers of PSCs
The perovskite film influences a variety of photophysical aspects of the device, such as light-harvesting, carrier transport, and charge carrier recombination, and thus the excellence of perovskite films is critical to the proper production of energy from PSC devices. Many attempts have been made to enhance the quality of the perovskite active layer, such as precursor solution solvent engineering, sequence deposition, anti-solvent engineering,113 additive engineering, and so on. Among all of the most popular and effective ways among them is additive engineering. Two-dimensional materials have been frequently employed as additives to slow down the crystallization phenomenon and even influence the orientation of perovskite crystals due to their benefits of low cost, solution-processability, and high carrier mobility. Similarly Ti3C2Tx and the recently discovered Nb2CTx and Nb2CTx MXenes have been introduced into the perovskite absorber layer, resulting in improved perovskite morphology and increased PCE.98,114
First of all Guo et al. originally reported the addition of Ti3C2Tx to an MAPbI3-based perovskite absorber in 2018,98 kicking off research on MXene use in perovskite solar cells. According to their findings, adding Ti3C2Tx to MAPbI3 can slow down the nucleation process, resulting in larger crystal size routes for nucleating and growing perovskite films with and without Ti3C2Tx, as shown in Fig. 3a. Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx addition is particularly useful in accelerating electron transport via the grain boundary, like a “carrier bridge” as decreased charge transfer resistance for the MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-added device revealed by the impedance spectra and PCE was increased from 15.6% to 17.41% with the addition of 0.03% Ti3C2.

Agresti and his coworkers in 2019 reported the work function (WF) adjustment of the MAPbI3 films by introducing the Ti3C2Tx MXene and thus optimized the energy-level alignment for increasing the efficiency of the related perovskite solar cell. The WF of perovskite films was found to be efficiently regulated from 4.72 to 4.37 eV without influencing other inherent electronic features such as bandgap, film morphology, or suitable position of the VB in relation to the Fermi level.115
Zhang et al. recently reported the in situ solution development of perovskite/MXene heterostructures from MAPbBr3 nanocrystals decorated with few-layer titanium carbide MXene nanosheets; the results showed that better energy alignment improves electron injection from the perovskite nanocrystals to the Ti3C2Tx MXene, favorable for the performance of perovskite solar cells.116 The MAPbBr3 and Ti3C2Tx nanosheet band alignment diagram and quenching of photoluminescence intensity showing improved charged transfer behavior are shown in Fig. 3b and c.
Jin and his collaborators added the Ti3C2 nano-dopant to Ruddlesden–Popper (BA)2(MA)4Pb5I6 films and achieved an improved PCE, from 13.69% to 15.71%. The enhanced crystallinity, better morphology, and vertically oriented growth because of the Ti3C2 nano-dopants eventually aided the charge transfer in the device. A diagrammatic representation of devices and obtained J–V curves is represented in Fig. 3d. Furthermore, due to the superior crystallinity and passivation effect of perovskite films, the Ti3C2Tx nanosheet-doped devices have higher moisture stability than the control devices117
Zhao and his co-workers added a 0.03% Ti3C2 nanosheet of PbI2 solution. This method is advantageous for the successive reaction of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) to entirely change into MAPbI3, thereby lowering the quantity of residual lead iodide (PbI2) precursor in the perovskite film and widening the perovskite film grain size and grain boundaries. The band alignment diagram of different layers is represented in Fig. 3e. Their findings also showed that the surface group terminations on the titanium carbide nanosheet enabled defect states to be passivated by interacting with the un-coordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite, which had a significant impact on hysteresis mitigation and nonradiative recombination suppression and eventually achieved a record efficiency of 19.27%, showing an increase of 18% compared with the reference device.114 Zhou et al.118 suggested a strategy to simultaneously reduce the defects sites in a perovskite and release the lattice strain by using Cl-terminated Ti3C2 in the bulk and surface of CsPbBr3 (Fig. 3f). The interaction between the Cl of the Ti3C2Clx and uncoordinated Pb2+ ions in the CsPbBr3 leads to the compression of the perovskite lattice and thus acts as a lattice “tape”, where the Pb–Cl bonds act as a “glue” and the Ti3C2 immobilizes the lattice. Thus, this interaction leads to the defect passivation of perovskite material, with improved stability. Finally, the champion device achieves a Voc of 1.702 V and a PCE of 11.08% and the unencapsulated device retains its performance for 100 days under 80% humidity and 30 days at 85 °C.
Bati et al. demonstrated that MXene nanosheets can act as a host to smaller cations such as Cs+ in the perovskite material. So they doped the MXene nanosheet with Cs and added it to a lead iodide precursor solution for PSCs. Both experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Cs–Ti3C2Tx retards the crystallization process and thus leads to larger grains, with fewer grain boundaries and less nonradiative recombination, as shown in Fig. 4a.119 As a result, the PSCs with a cesium-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene delivered an efficiency of up to 21.57%.

Bykkam et al.120 explicated the role of additive 2D-MXene in the MAPbI3 structure to enhance the efficiency of monolithic PSCs. The addition of 5 vol% 2D-MXene improved the crystallinity of MAPbI3 with fewer defects. With the 2D-MXene additive the fabricated PSC showed an improvement in performance from 11.35% to 13.62%.
Zhang et al. used NH2-functionalized Nb2CTx 2D MXene (T-Nb2CTx) nanosheets as an additive in a perovskite precursor. The NH2 group of MXene nanosheets formed hydrogen bonds with iodide ions, thus hampering the crystallization process and leading to the formation of high-quality perovskite films. Owing to the excellent optoelectronic properties of T-Nb2CTx the fabricated PSCs with T-Nb2CTx ETLs and T-Nb2CTx additive in the perovskite showed the highest PCE of 21.79%. Consequently, the unencapsulated devices showed excellent stability due to the suppression of I− migration by the NH2 groups, and maintained 93% of the original PCEs after 1500 h of storage.121 The schematic of Nb2CTx with varying functional groups, energy levels of Nb2CTx-treated hydrazine and the perovskite interface with p-Nb2CTx and T-Nb2CTx is shown in Fig. 4b.
Liu et al.122 reported a PSC with an efficiency of 21.31% by incorporating chlorine-terminated Ti3C2 (Ti3C2Clx) QDs into the perovskite layer. The interaction between the Pb2+ of the perovskite and the Cl− of the Ti3C2Clx additives retarded the crystallization rate during the crystallization process, thus producing a high-quality film with fewer defects, improved crystallinity, and smaller remaining tensile strain. This inclusion also led to better band alignment between the SnO2 (ETL) and perovskite layer. Moreover, the Cl-terminated Ti3C2Clx QDs compared with OH terminations improved the stability by avoiding the deprotonation of the perovskite. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device demonstrated excellent stability against humidity by sustaining over 84% of its preliminary power conversion efficiency after being aged for 1k hours (with ∼40% RH).
Pescetelli et al. used multi-2D (two-dimensional) materials as inter- and intra-layers in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. They improved the efficiency by adding graphene to the TiO2 layer and Ti3C2Tx MXene to the perovskite layer to tune the work function and MoS2 between the perovskite and HTL. The smaller area device with an active area 0.09 cm2 showed a PCE exceeding 20%, while the large-area module with a substrate of 121 cm2 (active area 82.62 cm2) and 210 cm2 (active area 137.16 cm2) showed 17.2% and 14.7%, respectively. The reason behind the improvement in efficiency is the reduction of non-radiative recombinations and improved charge removal at perovskite and carrier transport layer interfaces owing to the proper band gap alignment between the perovskite and CTLs by the practical applicability of the 2D material in solar devices.123
Recently Li et al.124 exploited two different kinds of MXene, Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx, as an additive in CH3NH3PbI3 active layers, thus resulting in perovskite film with improved morphology, enlarged grain size and increased hydrophobicity. This led to an improvement in photovoltaic performance of the PSC. The device with the optimized proportion of V2CTx (0.0013 wt%) additive showed a higher performance (with 17% improvement compared with the control device) and stability compared with the Ti3C2Tx additive and control device owing to its higher quality of the perovskite film and crystallinity. Moreover, devices with V2CTx additive retained 68.29% of the initial PCE after storing for 15 days compared with Ti3C2Tx additive (by 47.16%) and without additives (by 9.69%). This work paves the way to use V2CTx in photovoltaics. From 2018 to now the overall function of Ti3C2 Nb2C and V2C in absorbing-layer perovskite solar cells is shown in Table 1.

Jin and his co-workers recently described the surface tuning of the lead-containing CsPbI3 perovskite layer via orthogonal spray coatings with oxidised MXene nanoplates. This surface tuning not only provided a protection against moisture for the perovskite layer, but also improved the charge separation at the perovskite/ETL interface due to a strong electric field, achieving an efficiency of 19.69 percent for 0.096 cm2 minimodules.125
Recently, in June 2022, Dongfang and his colleagues126 reported the use of fluorine-functionalized MXene QDs as a surface passivator to increase the efficiency of a CsPbI3 perovskite. They concluded that fluorine-doped MXene sheets provide a barrier against moisture sensitivity, improve charge transfer, and further reduce nano-radiative recombination, resulting in a 20.44 percent enhancement in efficiency.
Lin et al.,127 in their recent synthesis of dye-sensitized double PSCs, employed indoline dye to sensitize the TiO2 layer, and MXene nanosheets (Ti3C2Tx) were included in the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite in order to improve the crystallisation. Both the D149 indoline dye and MXene contributed to the increased efficiency of the device (4.47%).
Din MF and his colleagues recently investigated the synergistic role of MXene doping of perovskite with ion beam sputtered NiO in an inverted type of device. Research attributed the increased short-circuit current (14.3% enhancement in PCE) of the device with work function tuning of the MAPI after MXene doping; however, increased defect states somewhat reduced the beneficial effect of improved grain boundaries during perovskite crystallization (Fig. 4c).128
2.2. MXenes as additives in electron transport layers of PSCs
The interfacial layers (ETLs and HTLs) are important for enhancing the device's efficiency and stability. Ideal interfacial layers for PSCs have been identified as materials that are chemically or thermally stable, cheap in price, and solution-processable, and show high-conductivity; furthermore, for selective charge extraction, they must have appropriate band alignments with the light-absorbing active layer. To prevent charge recombination,129 the electron transfer layer for PSCs should specifically harvest and transport electrons into the electrodes while also preventing the holes from moving through the ETL/perovskite interfaces. Transition metal oxide ETLs, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2),131 zinc oxide (ZnO),132 and tin dioxide (SnO2),133 have received a lot of attention so far. Even though these ETLs extract electrons quickly from the halide perovskite layer, still they have several failings which retard the device performance. As a common ETL, TiO2 produces suboptimal device stability and a large density of trap states at the TiO2/perovskite interface134 Furthermore, obtaining the conductive anatase phase of TiO2 requires a high-temperature sintering process (400–500 °C), which limits its use in flexible devices. However, MXenes are reasonably straightforward to process and scale up due to their simplicity of synthesis and stability as colloidal suspensions in water and different organic solvents.
A SnO2/Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposite as electron–hole-conducting in low temperature producing planar PSCs was proposed by Yang and collaborators in 2019. The scientists revealed that Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets play a role in the work function shifting of ETLs by offering superior charge transfer routes, allowing MXene-based PSCs to have a higher PCE than reference cells.135
In 2019 Yang et al. assigned Ti3C2 as the electron transport layer and with the optimized UV–ozone treatment of 30 minutes achieved a PCE of 17.17%. Ti3C2 colloidal solution was prepared by shaking Ti3C2 nanosheets in water and a spin coating technique was employed. They attributed the increased PCE to the Ti–O bonds achieved through UV–ozone treatment and which improved the interfacial charge transfer at the TI3C2/perovskite interface136
Recently Yang et al. worked on the oxidation of Ti3C2 hydrocolloids for tuning their better properties as ETLs in a solution-processed perovskite and achieved a PCE of 18.29%, compared with 16.50% for the pristine device. After significant oxidation, a change from metal to semiconductor occurred, resulting in a better match of energy levels between the electron transfer layers and the perovskite, making oxidized Ti3C2Tx more suited as an ETL in PSCs. The increased PCE was further explained by facilitated electron transfer and less recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface due to reduced film surface defects and increased electron mobility.137 The structure and cross-sectional SEM of the device are shown in Fig. 5(a and b).

Saranin et al. showed how MXene (Ti3C2Tx) doping benefits both the perovskite absorber and the electron transportation layer in NiO-based (n-i-p) inverted PSCs. The results demonstrated that MXenes enabled the facile tuning of energy level alignment at the ETL/perovskite interfaces on the one hand, and passivated trap states inside the cell structure on the other, improving charge removal and collection at the electrodes. In comparison with the reference devices, the MXene-based tailored cells demonstrated greater performance, with a PCE above 19% and enhanced stabilized power output.138
Wang and his collaborators also modified SnO2 by incorporating Ti3C2 and achieved a 20.65% enhancement in PCE from a controlled device. The results illustrated the creation of favorable conduction band alignment allowing efficient charge transfer (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, the FTO/MXene/SnO2 surface had more smooth morphology and hydrophobicity, which was advantageous for the formation of a low trap density perovskite film. Their work showed, when comparing the MXene-modified SnO2 ETL with the reference, a considerable suppression of both localized and global non-radiative recombination, as well as a substantial improvement in homogeneity and less carrier transport loss.139
In 2021 Yang et al. achieved a 23.3% PCE employing an MXene quantum dot (Ti3C2Tx) modified nanocrystalline SnO2 ETL. The MQD-modified SnO2 ETL was shown to be capable of rapidly initiating the perovskite crystallization rate in the precursors solution upon anti-solvent treatment (forming an intermediate phase), which significantly increases the crystal quality and phase stability of the perovskite film as-fabricated.140
HPs and MXenes can be constructed as heterostructures with distinct configurations in a variety of ways depending upon the available diverse fabrication techniques. Huang et al. created a multi-channel conductive heterojunction structure made of TiO2, SnO2, and Ti3C2Tx MXene and employed it as an ETL in efficient and stable PSCs, as shown in Fig. 5d. They prepared the heterostructure by taking TiO2 quantum dots with Ti3C2-bearing SnO2 solution with controlled annealing at 150 °C. The MXene acted as a connecting bridge between the TiO2/SnO2 heterostructure, creating a multidimensional network efficient for ETL, and achieved a champion PCE of 19.04%.141
Ge and his coworkers incorporated Ti3C2 quantum dots in the MAPbI3 layer, and Ti3C2 nanosheets in the TiO2 layer. The findings showed that titanium carbide QDs can efficiently lower the defect concentration of photoactive films, while titanium carbide nanosheets can expand the ETL's electron mobility; hence the combined effect of both led to an increase of the photoconversion efficiency from 12% to 17% with diminished hysteresis.125 Device configuration and band alignment of heterojunctions for PSCs using a TiO2/SnO2 conductive network with Ti3C2 is shown in Fig. 5e in deionized (DI) water (30 mL). Chen et al. and collaborators for the first time used ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene quantum dots. They employed TQDs in a perovskite/TiO2 ETL interface and perovskite absorber, as well as also inserting copper sulfide nanocrystals to produce the ideal Spiro-OMeTAD layer (Fig. 5f). With a substantial modification of the JSC, Voc, and FF, a considerable hysteresis-free PCE enhancement from 18.31% to 21.64% of PSCs was accomplished.126
Wang et al. demonstrated the potential use of Ti3C2Tx as an ETL for PSC by a process method at room temperature. Oxygen plasma treatment was done to modify the surface of the Ti3C2Tx. This led to the breaking of Ti–C bonds and the formation of Ti–O bonds arbitrarily distributed on the surface, thus resulting in reduced trap states and a tunable work function with better electron transport. Plasma treatment also increased the wettability of the MXene, with a higher surface free energy. Moreover, the interaction between the perovskite and the MXene through Pb–O also led to an improvement in the stability of the devices.142The schematic effect of oxidation on Ti3C2 and the influence on the charge transfer properties is shown in Fig. 6(a–c).

Bati et al. reported that although MXene incorporation into the ETL improves the performance of the PSC, its ambient fabrication leads to a decline in the electrical properties due to oxidation of the MXene. So they used metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (m-SWCNTs) with MXene to prepare a composite on the SnO2 layer to improve the performance of the PSC. PL and EIS measurements revealed that the MXene/m-SWCNT interfacial layer leads to improved charge extraction and reduced trap density at the SnO2/perovskite interface due to the higher conductivity associated with the nanotubes (Fig. 6d). The champion PSC with MXene/m-SWCNTs (2:1 w/w) showed a PCE of over 21%, with an FF close to 0.80.143
Zheng et al. synthesized Ti3C2Tx nanoflakes and combined them into SnO2 to use as an ETL in planar PSCs. They claim that by changing the ratio of Ti3C2Tx/SnO2 from 0 wt% to 2.2 wt% the properties of the perovskite layer on the top of the ETL can be controlled, including the crystal size, surface roughness, defect density, crystallinity, compactness, and optical absorption. The optimized ratio of 1.4 wt% reduced the defect density but also led to a decrease in electrical conductivity of the hybrid ETL as compared with the pristine substance. This resulted in an increase in PCE from 16.28 to 20.35% along with higher environmental stability.144
Yang et al. prepared a nanoscale heterostructure of 2D MXene Ti3C2Tx with SnO2 by modifying its terminal groups and regulated oxidation, and used it as an ETL in PSCs. During oxidation the Ti3C2Tx changed its character from metallic to semiconductor. As a result, the modified MXene had a better band alignment with the perovskite. Hence the heterojunction offers less recombination and more electron extraction between the ETL/perovskite interfaces, thus leading to an increase in PCE from 17.68% to 20.09% with improved ambient stability.145
Chava et al. used a titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to tailor the properties of the ETL and PC61BM/perovskite interface. Three different methodologies were adapted to investigate the role of the MXene as an ETL, as a dopant in PC61BM or as an interfacial layer between the perovskite and the ETL. PSC with MXene-doped PC61BM (M-PC61BM) showed a 2.8% enhancement in PCE owing to improved conductivity, favorable band alignment and improved conductivity of the M-PC61BM/perovskite interface. Although the use of an MXene as an ETL passivated the defects in the perovskite, the device performance declined due to an unfavorable energy level alignment. Thus, the work function should be modified to improve efficient charge transport. Relatively less improvement in PCE was observed in devices with a Ti3C2Tx interfacial layer compared with M-PC61BM PSCs, recommending that, in addition to passivating the perovskite defects, the ETL properties should also be improved to achieve a superior PCE (Fig. 6h).146 Until now Ti3C2Tx MXene has been used to modify the properties of the ETL in PSCs as described in detail in the above section. Moreover, it is demonstrated that another member of the MXene family, niobium carbide (Nb2CTx), can be a potential candidate for PSCs owing to its easy solution processing, higher conductivity and higher surface area compared with Ti3C2Tx MXene.147 Furthermore, the theoretical calculations revealed that the properties of Nb2CTx MXene are closely related to its surface functional groups. Thus, by altering the content and type of these groups its properties can be tuned.
Niu et al. used for the first time the 2D Nb2C MXene in SnO2 ETL to dramatically increase the performance of PSCs. The incorporation of Nb2C MXene increased the lattice spacing facets of the SnO2, resulting in an improved surface energy, roughness, and defects of the SnO2–Nb2C-based ETL compared with the reference SnO2 film (Fig. 6g). Thus, subsequent perovskite deposition on the ETL formed higher quality film with enhanced crystallinity and efficient charge carrier extraction. The champion device achieved a PCE of 22.86% and maintained 98% of its initial PCE at 25 °C after 40 days under 40–60% humidity, thus showing improved stability. This excellent efficiency and stability of the PSC can be ascribed to the introduction of the Nb2C MXene, revealing that the Nb2C will be an effective additive for PSCs and other optoelectronic devices.147
In 2021 for the first time, Li and coworkers adopted Ti2C3 in (A2BBX6) double-halide PSCs by incorporation in the TiO2 layer (Fig. 6i). The obtained single-layered MXene nanosheets/flakes modified the surface wettability (less surface tension) of the ETL and promoted the fast crystallization of the Cs2AgBiBr6 in the device; furthermore, Ti3C2 nanosheets also improved the electrical mobility and extraction rate of TiO2, and achieved 40% better PCE than the pristine substance (2.8%).148
Yin, Li, et al.149 used an MXene as a dopant for the electron transport layer. They doped the SnO2 ETL with MXene modified by dodecyltrimethoxysilane, denoted as SnO2-MH, and fluoroalkylsilane, denoted as SnO2-MF. Both theoretical calculations from DFT studies and experimental results from UPS spectra showed that the SnO2-MH ETL has a better band alignment with the perovskite. In the meantime, functional MXenes have higher conductivity and form zero Schottky barriers with SnO2, thus enhancing the transfer of carriers rapidly. The perovskite film on MXene-functionalized SnO2 has a larger grain size. As a result, the PSC showed an improvement in PCE from 20.98% to 23.66% with better operational and moisture stability.
Zhang, Jiankai, et al. replaced the surface F-groups of a Nb2CTx MXene with NH2 groups and used it as an ETL in a PSC. The resulting NH2-functionalized Nb2CTx exhibited high transmittance, excellent optoelectrical properties and suitable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer, thus leading an improved performance of the perovskite devices.121 From 2018 to now, the overall function of Ti3C2 and Nb2C in ETL perovskite solar cells is shown in Table 2.

2.3. MXenes as additives in the hole transport layer of PSCs
The expensive price of hole-conducting materials and precious metal electrodes as contacts prevents perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from being widely used. For HTMs and noble-metal-free PSCs, carbon materials have been widely used. For the first time, Cao et al. used (Ti3C2) as a back contact in HTM and noble-metal-free PSCs just employing hot pressing (Fig. 7a) with a perovskite layer giving a champion efficiency of 13.83%.150

In 2019 Abdulaziz et al. used Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets as an interlayer in all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs to achieve good-quality interfacial energy level alignment (Fig. 7b), which reduces energy level gaps, speeds up hole extraction and decreases the recombination at the CsPbBr3/C electrode interface. Furthermore, functional groups on the surface of the Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets, such as CO, lead to strong interactions between Ti3C2 and under-coordinated Pb atoms, significantly reducing the surface and deep defects in the perovskite films.79
Jiankai et al.151 used for the first time oxygen-plasma-treated Nb2CTx MXene nanosheets as HTLs in inverted PSCs. The oxygen plasma treatment modified the surface of the Nb2CTx by increasing the surface oxygen-containing functional groups, which increases the WF due to a transfer of electrons from the Nb2C- to O-containing functional groups, and improved the surface dipoles. This is beneficial for lesser recombination and improved charge extraction at the Nb2CTx/MAPbI3 interface. The PSC with a modified Nb2CTx HTL exhibited the highest PCE of 20.74%, with enhanced stability. Furthermore, the PSCs with a large area (0.99 cm2) and flexible substrate achieved a PCE of 17.94% and 17.26%, highlighting the use of Nb2CTx as an ETL in flexible devices and for commercial applications (Fig. 7c).
Du et al.152 used Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with the silane coupling agent vinyl tris(2-methoxyethoxyl)silane (SCA) by a spray technique as an HTL in planar PSCs (Fig. 7d). The use of a coupling agent with a content of 0.3 v/v% leads to a variation of interface distribution with uniform and pin hole-free Ti3C2Tx films, consequently leading to an increase in performance of the PSCs from 11.12% to 13.65%. The increase in PCE was ascribed to the efficient hole extraction and reduced charge transfer resistance at the HTL/perovskite interface, thus offering more opportunities for potential research on Ti3C2Tx MXene as an HTL. The overall function of Ti3C2 and Nb2C in HTL perovskite solar cells is shown in Table 3.

Recently an MXene/WO3 hybrid structure was designed by Sajjad and his co-workers by decorating WO3 on conductive 2D MXene sheets, using a simple solution process.153 The designed hetero-structure was utilised with PEDOT:PSS for the first time to modify the hole transport layer (HTL) of a highly efficient hybrid perovskite solar cell. Their results indicated that the constructed perovskite solar cell with the MXene/WO3/PEDOT:PSS HTL exhibited a high PCE of 12.26 + 0.12%. The MXene/WO3 heterostructure tuned the HTL/perovskite interface via the dynamic interface for charge mobility/collection and appropriately tuned energy level alignment, allowing facile charge extraction.
Although MXene sheets and QDs have been found to play a variety of roles for the different layers (absorbing layer, HTL and ETL) of perovskite solar cells, from our current research we suggest that their universal role is found to be the work function tuning of the different layers.
The main role of MXenes in PSCs is due to charge redistribution at the interface, depending on the structure of the MXene surface terminations, resulting in the formation of an electrostatic dipole, which changes the interface WF value. When the proportion of OH, O, and F terminal groups is varied, the WF interface exhibits a very nonlinear behavior. This work function tunability of MXene due to surface termination is responsible for improving the grain boundaries, reducing surface/deep defects, reducing charge defects, and improving energy alignment at the perovskite/MXene or (HTL/ETL)/MXene interface. All the parameters improved by incorporating MXenes in PSCs and are summarized below in Fig. 8, which led to significance improvement in photovoltaic parameters. The utilization of 2D MXene stacked candidates as an additive in the perovskite layers is still in its early stages of development. There is still a lot of ground to cover in order to enhance PSC efficiency. Using several other types of MXene material in the perovskite light absorber could lead to a big breakthrough in this cutting-edge scientific sector in the near future.

3. Summary and outlook
Since the fourth quarter of 2018, the unique application of MXenes in perovskite solar cell technology has garnered considerable attention from the research community. Numerous pieces of experimental research on photovoltaic systems have been published to date, including both the electrochemical and physical properties of MXenes in photovoltaics. This review covered the most common method used for synthesizing MXenes and included a detailed explanation of the material's physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Until recently, wet chemical treatment was a well-known and widely utilised method for synthesizing MXenes. In these methods, fluoride compounds were used as etchants to remove Ti3C2Tx nanosheets from their parent phase (Ti3AlC2). Furthermore, in this review we have highlighted recent breakthroughs and innovations in current state-of the-art PSCs based on the diverse applicability of Ti3C2, Nb2C and the recently emerging V2C as additives in the perovskite or charge transport layer, or as an interface. The benefits of using these new MXene materials for perovskite solar cells have been examined based on their unique transport properties, intrinsic stability, and low manufacturing cost. Certainly, the introduction of these novel materials held a lot of promise for the development of reliable and efficient PSCs with exceptional long-term operational stability and efficiency. Furthermore, the considerable tunability of their structure and characteristics allows them to be used in a variety of PSC functional layers. MXene layered materials helped in aiding film homogeneity, interface engineering, and device optimization, all while cutting manufacturing costs.
The use of MXenes in PSCs has a lot of potential for improving device efficiency. Surprisingly, substantial progress has been made in this study area in a relatively short period of time, leading to the use of nanostructured MXene materials in PSCs. But, despite substantial research on carbide/nitride MXenes, we still do not have a complete grasp of these fascinating materials in perovskite solar cells. The main necessity is to ponder upon the following concerns to boost the utilization of the MXene in perovskite solar cells. Although the preparation MXene sheet has been demonstrated successfully using a variety of techniques, including liquid and mechanical exfoliation, their high cost, low yield, lengthy processing time, and lack of reproducibility are significant barriers to their use in PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. Thus MXene preparation techniques must be optimized further. Most known MXene preparations are still laboratory-based and involve a lot of HF (or in-situ-generated HF, e.g., by mixing LiF with HCl). Similarly, the product yield efficiency of etching the MAX phases to make MXenes is also low, as only the supernatant is retained after successive centrifugations, while the sediment and lower turbid liquid (which constitute the great majority) are washed away. This significantly hinders the production of MXenes, as it is not only inefficient, but also toxic and expensive. Methods of preparation that are more secure, such as electrochemical etching, need additional research work. Scalability is another critical aspect of MXene synthetic development, and in the future, research on scaling up the synthesis of MXenes must be undertaken securely and affordably. Additionally, because the majority of these nanomaterials exhibit layer-dependent optical and electronic properties, it is critical to develop simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly protocols for synthesizing high-quality MXene materials with a high production yield and a controlled layer number. Furthermore, solvent compatibility with both the exfoliation of MXene and PSC production processes must be considered.72 Spin coating is the most common approach for introducing 2D materials into PSCs. Despite the fact that this approach is simple, convenient, and widely available, the resulting films do not completely cover up the bottom layers, resulting in a high density of defects or pinholes leading to limited device efficiency.28 This issue generally can be solved by growing the amount of layers, which enhances better film coverage and conductivity at the cost of decreased film transparency and smoothness, which raises the devices’ series resistance (Rs). As a result, it is critical to create new and efficient ways for uniformly and successfully incorporating MXene into PSCs. Similarly, given the critical role of conductivity in improving the performance of photovoltaics, it is necessary to develop exfoliation/delamination methods for MXene sheets that do not require the use of organic intercalants and contribute to the enhancement of the conductivities and other properties of perovskite solar cells.154
Many of the key qualities of MXenes are still unknown, for example how they terminate on the surface in MXene-PSC methods is still in its early stages, and its impact on WF tuning could inspire new and more efficient designs of PSCs and other perovskite-based devices including LEDs and detectors. Plausible vast-range work function tuning is a particularly intriguing aspect demonstrated by these materials, which can be used to modify band alignments across different material layers, depending on their compositions and surface terminations. The effect of mixed terminations of F, OH, and/or O on the work function of Ti3C2 MXenes and on other MXenes should be examined in detail, using density functional theory calculations to identify all possible combination of MXenes with varying surafce terminations for the perovskite solar cells. As a result, future investigations on work function tuning for MXene material-based PSCs are likely to successfully address important stability challenges and examine the mechanisms that produce the higher stability. For example, creating well-functionalized MXenes and using them as CTLs would be extremely beneficial as the high cost of charge transport prevents a wide-use commercialization of PSCs.
There have been more than 99% reports on the utilization of just Ti3C2 MXene-based nanostructures in successfully improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells; however, it is critical to develop and use other MXene-based energy harvesting from novel MAX-phase sources. Current studies indicate the promise of recently employed Nb2C and V2C MXenes in the use of various types of perovskite and charge extraction layer. Finally, controlling the self-assembly on a wide scale in MXene-based perovskites needs a selection from hundreds of acceptable MXene categories and subcategories; hence, intelligent approaches such as machine learning, density functional theory and neural networks could be used to turn this dream into a commercial reality. Using this concept and the experimental results, future MXenes could be fine-tuned by surface modification to improve the properties without compromising or dramatically affecting other material properties.
Furthermore, current research suggests that single MXene flakes can oxidise into titanium oxide during delamination and storage in ambient air, which could compromise the chemical stability of MXenes for long-term usage, particularly in photothermal applications that run at high temperatures. Before considering commercialization or manufacturing, the resilience, recyclability, and repeatability of 2D MXenes should be carefully examined to address such oxidizing behavior, supported by proper Fermi level and band profile alignment as again calculated by DFT, which can be helpful in deciding a proper and excellent agreement of MXene/perovskite interfacial interactions. Additionally, heterostructures based on the combination of MXene materials may offer significant promise in the fabrication of HTM- and metal-free PSCs, although proper energy level alignment is critical.
Nonetheless, given that MXene materials have previously demonstrated remarkable potential in PSCs, there are still plenty of possibilities to increase PSC performance. We anticipate a bright future for MXene-based perovskite solar cells due to their various characteristics and functionalities. This systematic review is expected to both illuminate the various nature of MXene and their composites and point the way toward new avenues for developing solutions for next-generation perovskite solar cell applications.
