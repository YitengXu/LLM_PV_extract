    , Accepted 11th February 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractDue to high energy density and low cost, lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been regarded as the next generation of energy storage systems. As indispensable parts of LSBs, separators and solid electrolytes play an important role in inhibiting dendrite growth and eliminating short-circuit risks. Their development can fundamentally improve the performance of LSBs. In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as porous crystalline inorganic–organic materials with high porosity, uniform pore size distribution, customizable structure, and easy functionalization, are used as molecular sieves to uniformly deposit lithium ions and combine high-soluble solid solution polysulfides (PSs), which have become an emerging research direction. In this review, we are devoted to summarizing the design strategy of MOF-based separators and electrolytes based on MOFs and MOF-derived materials for LSBs. By discussing the pioneer works, both opportunities and challenges in each category are presented. Additionally, some design principles for MOF-based separators and MOF-based electrolytes, as well as the future directions for further development are provided.Zihao ChuZihao Chu is a graduate student of Professor Guoxiu Wang and Chengyin Wang of Yangzhou University of Chemical Technology.

1. Introduction
For decades, energy crisis and environmental pollution have been regarded as the major issues that hinder the continuing prosperity of the global economy. This has motivated scientists to explore new clean energy technologies, particularly natural resource-based energies such as solar energy, wind energy, and tide energy.1,2 However, these intermittent natural resources are incapable of providing the power grid with sustainable and stable energy, which significantly limits their large-scale commercial promotion.3,4 Recently, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which employs layered/spinel/polyanion oxides as cathode materials and graphite as an anode material,5,6 have gained extensive research interest since its first breakthrough made by Sony Corporation in 1991.7 However, the traditional LIB technology, whether they are lithium iron phosphate batteries or ternary lithium-ion batteries, or lithium-ion batteries with the liquid electrolyte, can achieve a theoretical maximum energy density of 350 W h kg−1. Even if we add various battery management systems to it, 300 W h kg−1 can be achieved, which is basically the limit. This energy density can meet the endurance needs of the full popularity of electric vehicles. At the same time, the low lifespan of existing lithium-ion batteries and the fast replacement frequency hinder the promotion of electric vehicles. Therefore, the development of batteries with high specific capacity and long life has become the most important topic in the field of energy storage.
Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies, were first investigated in 1968 by Elton Cairns et al.8,9 They are operated under the reversible electrochemical reaction between S and Li2S with a theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mA h g−1 and an energy density of 2600 W h kg−1, which is almost four times compared to that of traditional LIBs.10–12 In addition, the cathodic sulfur is rich in abundance with low cost and non-toxicity, further making the LSB a good candidate for future commercialization. In 2009, Nazar and co-workers made a pioneering work that employed a highly ordered, mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) as a sulfur host and assessed its LSB performance. Due to the physical confinement of mesopores in CMK-3, the CMK-3@S electrode demonstrates a high initial discharge capacity of 1320 mA h g−1. However, the span life of this Li–S cell is very limited with only 20 cycles falling to 1100 mA h g−1. Thus far, despite the significant progress that has been made, LSBs are still suffering from low discharge capacity, severe fast capacity deterioration, large volume expansion, and safety concerns due to the Li metal and flammable electrolyte.13,14 For cathode materials, there are three main challenges: (1) neither the elemental sulfur nor the reaction product has ideal electronic and ionic conductivity. The sulfur material has extremely low electrical conductivity at ambient temperature (5.0 × 10−30 S cm−1). The final products of the reaction, Li2S2 and Li2S, are also electronic insulators, which are harmful to batteries, especially at high-rate performances.15,16 (2) “Shuttling effect” is caused by the dissolution of intermediate discharge products. Different from the final reaction product Li2S, which is insoluble, Li2Sn (2 < n < 8) can escape from the holder matrix and roam in ether-electrolytes.17,18 This problem causes many dissolved lithium polysulfides (LPSs) penetrate the separator, which can finally be reduced by the metallic Li anode, resulting in the irreversible loss of active cathode materials, and the destruction of the whole battery system.15,19 This “overstep” could inhibit the formation of the solid–electrolyte-interphase (SEI) on the anode electrode.20,21 (3) Because of the huge difference in densities of sulfur (2.07 g cm−3) and lithium sulfide (1.66 g cm−3), the volumetric expansion ratio of cathode materials can reach 79% during the discharge/charge process.22–24 In general, the massive volumetric change results from the collapse of the electrode integrity and leads to their reversible deterioration of the discharge capacity of the LSBs.25,26 Alternatively, the anode materials of LSBs should be concerned. Metallic Li has been considered as the most suitable anode material for LSBs due to the low redox potential (−3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) and higher theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g−1).27,28 For metallic Li, there are three main challenges: (1) during the stripping/plating process, the grown Li dendrite can penetrate the separator and cause a short circle, which is fatal for high-energy density batteries. (2) The broken/recombination of the SEI layer could result in electrolyte consumption. (3) The tremendous volumetric transformation of the Li metal during cycling greatly affects the integrity of anode electrodes.29,30 These problems can be addressed by optimization on each composition of LSBs, including a cathode, separator, anode, as well as an electrolyte. Polysulfide can be encapsulated by designing the advanced morphology of the cathode host.31–33 Metal oxides, sulfides, and nitrides have a strong affinity for LPSs as hosts, reducing their dissolution in the electrolyte and inhibiting the shuttle effect.34–36 The unique elasticity and flexibility of conductive polymers can relieve the volume expansion of sulfur, and at the same time, its inherent conductive properties can promote the conduction of electrons and further promote redox reactions. The modification of the separator can improve the selectivity of the physical barrier layer and adsorb polysulfides to inhibit the shuttle of LPSs. The protection of the anode is mainly achieved by optimizing the electrolyte and artificial SEI layer to achieve no dendrites, high coulombic efficiency, and long cycle life. The optimization of the electrolyte mainly focuses on the modification of the organic electrolyte and the development of the solid electrolyte. The organic electrolyte mainly forms a passivation film by selecting appropriate additives to resist dissolved PSs and inhibit the shuttle effect. The solid electrolyte can fundamentally solve the flammability problem of the organic electrolyte, and at the same time, the good mechanical properties alleviate the volume expansion and solve the safety problem.
The metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) coordinated by metallic nodes and organic linkers have gained considerable interest since its discovery in 1995 by Yaghi et al.37–40 In 2009, Li et al. first proposed Zn4O(1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate)2 (named MOF-177) as the cathode material for Li-ion batteries.41,42 In 2013, Wang et al. first proposed ZIF-8 (ZIF: zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) as the cathode material for LSBs. MOF-based materials, including pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and MOF-derived materials, have gained considerable interest in energy storage and conversion,39,40 owing to their unique and advantageous characteristics such as high surface area (3000 m2 g−1 to 10400 m2 g−1), regular and tunable pore structures, diversity in the chemical composition of the organic links and metal nodes, facile synthesis, and the controllable chemistry and functionality. The ultra-porous MOFs are also used as an ion sieves to regulate the transport of anions and cations in traditional electrolytes to achieve homogeneous lithium deposition and to inhibit lithium dendrite growth effectively.

Fig. 1 illustrates the rapidly growing number of publications and citations on this subject, especially in the past five years. In particular, significantly increased citations in the past two years demonstrate its promising potential in LSBs. Although there is extensive research reviewing the applications of MOF-based materials in cathode hosts for LSBs, separators and electrolytes are seldom focused.43–45 The existence of separators allows lithium ions to shuttle freely during the charge–discharge process while preventing the direct contact between the positive and negative electrodes, thereby avoiding the occurrence of short circuits. An ideal separator for LSBs should also be capable of providing excellent mechanical strength, preventing the “shuttle effect” of polysulfides during cycling, and even inhibiting the generation of dendrites on anodes. The MOF-based separator has good mechanical strength, and its unique pores can inhibit polysulfides and act as a molecular sieve to increase the lithium ion transference number, thereby alleviating the growth of lithium dendrites. The electrolyte is an important medium of lithium ions in the working process of batteries. A qualified electrolyte for Li–S batteries should be stable and “deactive” to minimize the self-decomposition and side reactions with the lithium anode and polysulfide. Traditional ester electrolytes are easy to decompose, and they produce a large amount of combustible gas, which dissolves LiPS quite strongly, which is not conducive to the maintenance of LSB capacity. The MOF-based electrolyte has a significant effect on uniformly depositing lithium ions and inhibiting the shuttle effect.46–48 This review will fill this gap and discusses mostly the recent research and progress about the application of MOF-based materials and MOF-derived materials as separators and electrolytes for LSBs. The working mechanism of MOFs is mentioned in detail and compared systematically. The prospects and challenges of MOF-based materials in LSB separators and electrolytes are also proposed to light a new way for the research of MOFs for the domain of energy storage technology. Fig. 2 elucidates the research history of the MOFs applied in LSBs in the last decades.49–51 It points out the direction for the application of MOF-based materials in LSBs.52

2. Prerequisites for the preparation strategy of MOFs specifically for LSBs

Fig. 3 demonstrates the applications of MOFs and MOF-derived materials in LSBs. One of the unique advantages is the porous structure with high pore volume and high specific surface area. This structure makes it have a unique adsorption effect on polysulfides. Besides, the three-dimensional (3D) pore structure enables the MOFs to deposit lithium ions uniformly, assuring safety of LSBs. In this review, the latest development of various MOF-based electrolytes and membranes is summarized. First of all, we introduce the design ideas of MOFs in some mainstream LSBs.
 Fig. 3  Development timeline of MOFs in LSBs. 
2.1. Lewis acid–base interaction
By definition, Lewis bases are any species with filled orbitals that contain electron pairs that do not participate in the bonding but can covalently bind with Lewis acids to form Lewis acid–base pairs.53–56 Lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx2−) are soft Lewis bases. Therefore, strong bonding sites that can strongly interact with PSs can be formed via doping various electron-rich metal nodes with Lewis acid properties into the host material.57–59 In some cases, this Lewis acid–base interaction is called metal sulfur bonding.60,61 The vacant metal center of the transition metal interacts with electron-filled Lewis base sulfur via Lewis acid–base interactions. Li et al. designed a light and flexible dual-function separator (B/2D-MOF-Co) assembled layer by layer from bacterial cellulose and 2D ultra-thin MOF-Co to achieve safe, long-life LSBs.62–64 In the designed separator, the periodically arranged cobalt atoms and oxygen atoms (Co–O4 part) exposed on the surface of the ultra-thin MOF nanosheets are coordinated. “Single-atom array simulation” can be achieved at the interface between the anode and the separator. The adsorption of O atoms with strong lithium-ion greatly homogenizes the flux of lithium-ions, resulting in stable lithium stripping/plating. Simultaneously, on the cathode side, the Co atom acts as an acid site under the Lewis acid–base interaction to inhibit the shuttle of the polysulfide (Fig. 4a). After introducing a dual-function B/2D MOF-Co separator in LSBs, a reversible specific capacity of 1112 mA h g−1 at 0.1C long-term cycle stability with ultra-low capacity attenuation of 0.07% can be obtained. In particular, even if the sulfur content is as high as 7.8 mg cm−2, a high reversible area capacity of 5.0 mA h cm−2 can be maintained after 200 cycles. In the current reports, the theory of Lewis acid–base has been widely used to explain the effective anchoring of PSs by MOF-based materials.

2.2. Metal nodes and organic linkers
MOFs are composed of metal ions/metal clusters coordinated by organic ligands.67,68 Eddaoudi et al. also have widely designed metal ions and organic connectors as secondary building units (SBUs).69 They described the geometry of 131 SBUs and characterized their metal composition and relative electronic connectivity.70 Each SBU has an unpredictable effect on the stability and physical properties of the MOFs.71,72 Simultaneously, in LSBs, most of the metal nodes can be used as Lewis acid sites, which has an important influence on sulfur anchoring.73–75 Existing studies have proved that the Lewis acid–base interaction between MOFs and polysulfides greatly improves the stability of lithium–sulfur batteries. Zheng et al. formed a new type of Ni–MOF with the Ni metal node and matrix of M6(BTB)4(BP)3 (M = metal, BTB = benzene-1,3,5-triphenyl ester, BP = 4,4′- bipyridine).64 To demonstrate their ability to immobilize PSs, they also used a Co-MOF as a control group material. According to the density functional theory calculations, the Ni metal node normally has a higher binding energy to all PSs than the Co metal node (Fig. 4b). The Ni metal acts as a Lewis acid center to trap the polysulfide in the pores of the MOF via strong interaction with the polysulfide soft Lewis base. As a result, the Ni-MOF-based electrode delivers enhanced cycling stability compared to Co-MOFs in LSBs (Fig. 4c). At a current density of 0.1C, the capacity retention rate is as high as 89% after one hundred cycles. The same metal node is connected by different organic ligands to form different types of MOFs.65 The twist angle of the organic ligand of the same metal node will also determine the different properties and topology of the MOFs. Furukawa et al. used copper acetate as the metal node, which is connected by 4,40-biphenyl dibasic acid, close to the coplanar dicarboxylate and copper acetate can form a two-dimensional MOF-11824 nanosheet.76 In contrast, the vertical dicarboxylate and the square paddle wheel can form a 3D network MOF-60124 (Fig. 4d). The same metal node can be connected by dicarboxylic acid organic connectors of different lengths, producing various materials with the same network topology (Fig. 4e). Functional groups of organic linkers also have a complex effect on the MOFs. Zhou et al. compared the maximum capacity of the MIL-53(Al) host and NH2-MIL-53(Al) host at 0.1C.77 They believed that the Lewis basic amino group in the organic linker was not conducive to the formation and stability of PSs. They speculated that the group would cause worse charge transfer and inhibition diffusion. At the same time, they proposed that the small pores related to the function of affinity with polysulfide anions in the open framework help to achieve a stable cycle of LSBs. The previous part explains the breadth and complexity of metal nodes and organic ligands in LSBs, which can allow more researchers to rationally design new MOF structures for LSBs. In addition, the adjustability of the MOFs structure provides an effective platform for us to explore it in energy storage.78–80
2.3. Pore aperture
To date, extensive research on the pores of MOFs explores how to efficiently inhibit the shuttle of PSs to reduce the decline of cycling capacities of LSBs.81–83 Zhou et al. found that reducing the particle size of the MOF host can obtain a higher capacity.84 They believed that the small pores with an affinity for polysulfide in the open structure benefit the improvement of the stability of the cycle. Comparing with ZIF-7 (Ms-2.9), ZIF-8 (Ms-3.4), and CuBTC (Ms-9.0), Chang et al. found that the MOFs can capture more PSs, which led to the initial sulfur loss and lower CE at relatively large pore sizes.85 Reducing the average pore size of MOFs is an effective way to alleviate this phenomenon. However, it will cause a mechanical lag of lithium-ion transport and produce more serious polarization. Jiang et al. synthesized MOFs with different pore geometries as PCN-224 (cross-linked pores and tunnels), MIL-101 (3D layered nanocage), and MIL-53 (one-dimensional channel) (Fig. 4f).66 Although these three types of MOFs are endowed with similar electrical conductivities, they exhibited quite different electrochemical performances in LSBs (Fig. 4g). According to their intensive investigation, the authors believed that these differences were caused by their different pore geometries. An unobstructed pore system with a larger pore size could facilitate the transportation of lithium ions, providing a more and smooth ion diffusion path, especially at higher rates. Besides, a larger pore diameter normally reduces the resistance of ions so as to alleviate the polarization of the whole battery.
2.4. Ion conductivity MOFs
MOFs have been extensively studied in various energy fields because of the unique functional adjustability and unique structure.86,87 Yet, the electrical insulation of most MOFs greatly hinders their application in energy storage materials. In most previous research, combining MOFs with many hybrids with conductive stuff (such as graphene oxides {GOs} or conductive polymers) is a good choice to compensate for electrical conductivity. However, unlike electrode materials, both separators and electrolytes require good ionic conductivity and a certain degree of electrical insulation to avoid self-discharge. Good ionic conductivity is beneficial to reduce the internal resistance of the battery and improve the rate performance of the battery. Ashok Kumara et al. applied ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole ammonia bromide (wt%) as a filler to fill copper 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid (CuBTC).88 At a temperature of 380 K, the optimal ionic conductivity of nanocomposites containing 50 wt% IL is 5 × 10−3 S cm−1. Fortunately, the introduction of conductive MOFs greatly solves the problem of self-insulation of MOFs and promotes their application in batteries. In 2019, Sun et al. first proposed the idea of improving the conductivity of MOFs via the interaction of conjugated organic ligands, metal ions containing loosely bound electrons, and relative covalent bonds between metal ions and organic ligands.89 This concrete manifestation is the expansion of the covalent bond of the coordination polymer via π-interaction. Through the comparison between 2D MOFs, Day et al. found that metal ions and organic ligands formed extended π-d conjugated sheets that could result in the highest conductivity, which corresponded to the theory applied by Sun et al.90Table 1 exhibits the comparison between conductivities and lithium ion transference number of MOF-related electrolyte materials.

3. MOFs as separators
As we know, the separator plays an irreplaceable role in the LSBs, as it is designed to prevent the diffusion of long-chain PSs from cathode to anode but allow solvated lithium ions to pass through. In this vein, the separator should establish an excellent ion selectivity and strong trapping ability to LPSs via either physical absorption or chemical absorption. However, current widely used Celgard separator is confronted with the following disadvantages, which restrain the commercialization of LSBs: (1) polypropylene {PP} material has low polarity and cannot trap PSs. (2) the separator has large pores, which are much larger than PSs and difficult to confine PSs. (3) The separator has poor mechanical strength and is easily pierced by lithium dendrites. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, the new separator must also have high polarity, small pores, and improved mechanical strength. The MOF-based separator can be used as an ion sieve, restricting PSs through the pore size, and selectively screening lithium ions to increase the diffusion rate of lithium ions. MOF-based coating, in situ coating or the physical coating can enhance mechanical properties and prevent dendrites from piercing the separator. The metal elements on the coating surface can provide Lewis-acid/base interaction to enhance the polarity to trap PSs. At the same time, the micropores in the coating confine the diffusion of PSs. Table 2 exhibits the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries with some typical MOF-based separators.

3.1. Pristine MOFs for separators
The MOFs have excellent molecular screening ability and high binding energy to PSs.115,116 Many researchers have designed a variety of MOFs and applied them directly as separators in LSBs due to their excellent molecular screening ability and high binding energy to PSs.117 Tian et al. proposed a simple wet-chemical method for the synthesis of few-molecular-layer MOF nanosheets without surfactants and employed them as separators.100,101 These ultra-thin Cu2(CuTCPP) MOF nanosheets were assembled via a one-pot solution reaction of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and H2TCPP in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (TCPP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) (Fig. 5a).118 They found that the thickness of Cu2(CuTCPP) nanosheets can be adjusted by controlling the concentration of DMF from 3 nm to several hundred nanometres. In detail, when the ligand concentration is less than 0.6 mM and the metal salt concentration is less than 2.0 mM, Cu2(CuTCPP) nanosheets with a diameter of several microns and a thickness of about 3.0 nm were obtained. The high mechanical and flexible Cu2(CuTCPP) nanosheets are ideal materials for inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle in LSBs. As a result, the Cu2(CuTCPP)-modified separator endows the carbon black/sulfur (CB@S) cathode with a capacity retention rate as high as 71.1% with a sulfur content of 70 wt% and 10 mg cm−2 at 1C after 900 cycles. The CB@S electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 9.22 mA h cm−2 at 0.2C after 100 cycles. Zang et al. successfully grafted Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaniline triphenyl) onto the polypropylene separator (PP, Fig. 5b) by an interface-induced growth method.102 The obtained Ni3(HITP)2 has a specific surface area of 638.8 m2 g−1, very narrow pore size distribution, and a center pore size of 1.5 nm. The Ni3(HITP)2/PP separator not only has a uniform porous structure to physically confine PSs but also shows strong polarity to chemically trap PSs, suppressing the PS diffusion to the anode. Compared with the traditional PP separator, including ZIF-8/PP and carbon-modified PP separator-based cathode, the Ni3(HITP)2/PP separator-based cathode displays improved cycling and rate performances with a capacity of ∼1200 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 100 cycles (Fig. 5c and d). Based on the UV-Vis absorption spectra, the saturated adsorption capacities of Ni3(HITP)2, CNT, GO, and ZIF-8 for Li2S6 were obtained as 0.183, 0.086, 0.076, and 0.032 mmol g−1, respectively. It can be found that the adsorption capacity of Ni3(HITP)2 for PSs is significantly higher than those of other materials, demonstrating its superior electrochemical performance for LSBs. The low adsorption capacity of ZIF-8 for PSs is mainly because of its pore size (only 0.34 nm), which results in a limited polysulfide binding interface. Notably, even at an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm−2, the Ni3(HITP)2/PP can maintain a stable area capacity of 7.24 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles at 0.5C. Chen et al. also presented a fast and scalable filtration strategy to coat Ni3(HITP)2 onto the surface of the PP separator and obtained similarly improved LSBs performance (Fig. 5e).103 In this regard, the LSBs with the membrane modified by 2D conductive MOFs had a higher specific capacity of 1220.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and a rate performance of 800.2 mA h g−1 at 2C. Fan et al. poured UiO-66 onto the surface of the PP separator.104 As shown in Fig. 5f, the visible polysulfide diffusion experiment shows that the UIO-PP separator has an excellent ability to inhibit the polysulfide diffusion with no obvious color change after 36 h. As a result, the LSBs with the UIO-PP separator-modified cathode exhibit a stable capacity of 720 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5C.

3.2. MOF composites for separators
Although significant performance has been achieved on MOFs with ion sieves,122,123 most MOF membranes are weak in mechanical brittleness, failing to meet the requirement of their practical applications.124,125 In order to solve these problems, Bai et al. used Cu3(BTC)2 (HKUST-1) and GO to Although significant has been achieved on MOFs with ion sieve,122,123 most of the MOFs membranes are weak in mechanical brittleness, failing to meet the requirement of their practical applications.124,125 In order to solve these problems, Bai et al. used Cu3(BTC)2 (HKUST-1) and GO to design a robust separator with good mechanical flexibility for LSBs (Fig. 6a).119 The as-prepared MOF@GO separator exhibits a 3D porous structure with abundant ordered micropores centred around ∼0.9 nm, which is much smaller than those of LPSs (Li2Sn, 4 < n ≤ 8).126 Thus, it can effectively block the entry of PSs and inhibit their shuttle effect during the discharge/charge process.127,128 As a result, the MOF@GO separator-based battery shows almost no capacity degradation in the first 100 cycles and an average attenuation of 0.019% during the 1500 cycles. Hong et al. mixed the Ce(IV) clusters containing MOFs and CNT to get a Ce-MOF/CNT slurry for the isolation coating layer of PP in LSBs.112 The modified Ce-MOF-2 (also called Ce-MOF-808) shows both a large specific surface area of 1038.4 m2 g−1 and the terminal S of Li2S6 is closer to the Ce(IV) sites with a distance of about 0.23 nm, which can rapidly adsorb and block the PSs inside these micropores. In addition, the unsaturated coordinated Ce(IV) cluster shows its unique role in the adsorption of PSs (Fig. 6b). Coupling with the highly conductive CNT, the Ce-MOF-2/CNT separator-based battery displays a high initial capacity of 1021.8 mA h g−1 at 1C with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 (Fig. 6c). After 800 cycles, the specific capacity slowly decreases to 838.8 mA h g−1 at a decay rate of only 0.022%, and the coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. Even at a much higher sulfur loading of 6 mg cm−2, the LSBs with the Ce-MOF-2/CNT separator still have good cyclic performance at 0.1C with its specific capacity decreasing from 993.5 mA h g−1 to 886.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. Guo et al. proposed a continuous growth of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-threaded well-intergrown HKUST-1 (Cu3(BTC)2) layer on the surface of a commercial Celgard separator (PSS@HKUST-1/Celgard, abbreviated as PHC).120 With the assistance of PSS, the window diameter of HKUST-1 (0.9 nm) is wider than that of lithium-ions (0.12 nm) and smaller than that of polysulfides (0.51–0.68 nm), respectively.129 Therefore, this PHC separator can not only enable lithium-ion transport between the electrodes but also inhibit polysulfide shuttling. Moreover, the negatively charged –SO3- group on the PHC surface can repel polysulfides via electrostatic repulsion and promote the migration of lithium ions, significantly boosting the redox kinetics of LSBs. The comparison of polysulfide permeation experiment proves that the PHC separator is more favorable in inhibiting the PSs than the traditional Celgard separator (Fig. 6d). After this modified PHC was assembled into LSBs, the excellent electrochemical performance was maintained, and the shuttle effect is suppressed in the conventional sulfur/superphosphate carbon cathode. The discharge capacity of the sulfur cathode at 0.5C decreases from 1278 mA h g−1 to 775 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles, corresponding to the capacity attenuation of only 0.05% for each cycle. Wu et al. threaded ZIF-8 into strings via the interaction between –COOH from multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Zn2+ from ZIF-8.121 Therefore, the interweaved framework endows ZIF-8 with even distribution inside the void and the conductivity of the ZIF-8 composite is also enhanced (Fig. 6e). The strong Lewis acid–base interaction between ZIF-8 and polysulfides can accelerate the chemisorption of PSs. In addition, this functional layer can also act as a physical barrier to block the migration of PSs. Therefore, an initial discharge capacity of 1588.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2C is achieved using this CNT/ZIF-8 separator (Fig. 6f). The capacity retention rate after 100 cycles is 36.2%, which is higher than that of the battery without a functional layer.

3.3. MOF derivatives for separators
MOF is composed of metal sites and organic linkers. In high-temperature calcination, the MOF is both a precursor and a self-sacrificing template, and organic linkers can be used as a carbon source to prepare porous carbon. Therefore, MOF-derived materials with both metal and carbon properties have attracted extensive attention from researchers, especially in the field of energy storage.134–136 Song et al. prepared the dispersed cobalt nanoparticles and in situ self-catalyzed carbon nanotubes (CNT) from bio-MOF-100.130 Due to the CNT and newly formed carbon nanosheets (CNs) from bio-MOF-100,137 a 3D cobalt nanoparticle/nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet/CNT framework (Co/NCNS/CNT) was obtained (Fig. 7a). The resulting 3D conductive network provides a fast conductive transport path for electrons. Meanwhile, the doping of Co and N, along with the nanoflake structures, renders the Co/NCNS/CNT with rapid and effective physicochemical absorption of LPSs. More importantly, the long-chain PSs are converted into short-chain PSs under the catalysis of partially homogeneous Co nanoparticles and Co–N interaction, which effectively facilitates the LSB reaction kinetics.138–140 As shown in Fig. 7b, LSBs with a Co/NCNS/CNT-coated separator have the best rate performance and the highest specific capacity. Its initial capacity is 972.4 mA h g−1 at 2C, and the capacity attenuation is only 0.05% during the 1000 long-term cycles. Even at a high sulfur load of 5 mg cm−2, the specific capacity can remain at 522.1 mA h g−1 (2.61 mA h cm−2) after 500 cycles at 1C. Zhang et al. treated MIL-125-Ti in chloroform to produce a new material containing amorphous titanium dioxide embedded in crystalline terephthalic acid (BDC), which is short for a-TiO2–BDC (Fig. 7c).131 Their research shows that a-TiO2–BDC contributes to the formation of a uniform solid electrolyte interphase layer, which contains mechanically flexible organic compounds and ionic conductive N-containing species. In addition, a-TiO2–BDC exhibits strong adsorption toward LPSs due to the interaction between Ti4+, –COOH groups, and LPSs, namely the Ti–S and –COOLi binding. The Li‖Cu cells with the a-TiO2–BDC-coated separator can stably charge and discharge 380 cycles with an average CE of 98.1% without depositing dendritic lithium at 1.0 mA h cm−2. Remarkably, the Li‖Li cells with the a-TiO2–BDC-coated separator also shows a stable cyclic performance at 4 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 4 mA h cm−2.

Guang et al. modified the polypropylene separator (PPS) by coating the double-shelled hollow N-doped porous carbon polyhedron (DSxHNC).132 They synthesized ZIF-8@ZIF-67 core–shell polyhedrons through the epitaxial growth of ZIF-67 nanocrystals with ZIF-8 serving as the core seed at room temperature. Then, DSxHNC was obtained by carbonizing the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 core–shell polyhedron at a high temperature under Ar/H2 flow. Finally, a certain amount of ketjen black (KB) and DSxHNC were mixed with negative pressure infiltration on the surface of PPS to prepare DSxHNC/KB/PPS separators (Fig. 7d). DSxHNC has a special hollow structure, which makes it light in the process of dense packaging. Thus, an economic and effective conductivity enhancer and filler, KB nanoparticles, is used to make the coating layer more compact. A large number of N-doped centers and micropores are distributed on the double shell of DSxHNC, which has a physical/chemical adsorption effect to LPSs, effectively alleviating its shuttle phenomenon. Moreover, with the thickness of DSxHNC/KB set at 8.43 μm, the best polysulfide suppressing effect can be obtained. The capacity degradation of LSBs with the DSxHNC/KB-coated separator per cycle (500 cycles) is 0.067% at 1C when the sulfur load is 1.0 mg cm−2. Li et al. developed an O-containing MOF-derived N-doped microporous carbon (OMNC) interlayer to further improve the LSB performance.113 The OMNC nanoparticles were fabricated by carbonizing the ZIF-8 precursor in a N2 atmosphere at 1300 °C, followed by a concentrated acid washing process to remove the residual Zn2+ and induce the O-containing group (Fig. 7e). The OMNC intermediate layer with abundant N dopants, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups not only has a high selectivity for lithium-ions but also can effectively inhibit the transport and shuttling of polysulfides (Fig. 7f). Consequently, the CNT/S composite cathode with the OMNC separator has a reversible capacity of 740.8 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 300 cycles. More importantly, the cathode has a high capacity of 741.2 mA h g−1 at 1C and only decreases to 580.5 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles when the sulfur loading is 3.0 mg cm−2. Employing the MOF-Al as a template, Deng and co-workers prepared the amorphous Al2O3/N-doped porous carbon (NPC) hybrid material after a high-temperature carbonization process.133 This amorphous nano-hybrid material shows a ultra-specific surface area of 329.6 m2 g−1 and a high pore volume of 0.5 nm. Importantly, the Al2O3@NPC-coated separator exhibits many advantages that are beneficial to the enhancement of LSB performance: (1) the synergistic effect between amorphous Al2O3 and N-doped porous carbon suppresses the polysulfide shutting effects and growth of lithium dendrites; (2) the optimized porous structure with diffusion channels in amorphous Al2O3 leads to good penetration and diffusion of electrolytes; (3) the higher conductivity after carbonization at high temperatures can improve the electron transport inside LSBs. As a result, the LSBs with the Al2O3@NPC-coated separator can provide a stable discharge capacity of 612.7 mA h g−1 at 2C after 900 cycles with a Coulomb efficiency of ∼98.5% (Fig. 7g and h).
4. MOFs as electrolytes
Although the modification of organic electrolyte can alleviate the growth of dendrites and inhibit the shuttle effect, they cannot fundamentally solve these two problems. Moreover, the flammability and toxicity of organic electrolytes have great potential safety hazards, which severely impede the large-scale application of LSBs.141,142 Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have been widely considered as the ultimate solution to terminate these defects.143,144 Recently, the MOF-based materials have been employed as additives of SSEs and achieved a significant progress in ceramic and polymer solid-state electrolytes. This can be due to the following reasons: (1) the adjustable pores in MOF-based SSEs provide a uniform lithium-ion flux and assist in the uniform deposition of Li; (2) nano-sized MOF particles increase the contact between the electrolyte and the electrode interface, thereby promoting the mechanics of ion transport; (3) via covalent bond modification, some functional groups with high ionic conductivity and interface stability can be introduced into the MOF structures to improve the corresponding electrochemical performance; and (4) the open metal sites in the MOF structures combine with anions to limit the movement of anions. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that MOF-based SSEs are expected to realize dendrite-free batteries, inhibit the shuttle effect, relieve the volume expansion, and realize long cycle and safety of LSBs.
4.1. MOFs as electrolytes for lithium metal anodes
The utilization of MOFs as a solid filler in composite polymer electrolytes is an emerging research field. The physical and chemical properties of MOF fillers have a significant impact on the performance of composite polymer electrolytes. Zhu et al. fixed anionic groups on MOFs.99 They covalently coordinated the trifluoromethyl sulfonyl group to the amino group of UiO-66-NH2 and prepared a novel single-ion conducting SSE. This type of solid electrolyte material has high ionic conductivity (2.07 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C), low activation energy (0.31 eV), a wide electrochemical window of up to 4.52 V, and a high lithium ion transfer number (0.84). According to the scanning electron microscope (SEM) on the surface of the lithium foil after 160 h of electrolyte plating/stripping experiment with UiO-LiTFSI (Fig. 8a) and that of lithium foil surface after 160 h of electrolyte plating/stripping experiment with UIO (Fig. 8b). We can clearly find that the electrode surface is still flat and dense after 160 h cycling with the UiOLiTFSI electrolyte, but many rod-shaped dendrites have been grown with the UiOLi electrolyte. This indicates that the UiOLiTFSI electrolyte has high interfacial stability. In solid-state batteries with lithium iron phosphate as the cathode, the battery equipped with this new SSE can exhibit excellent rate performance and cycle stability. Huo et al. prepared a novel cationic MOF (CMOF) through the nucleophilic substitution reaction of grafted pyridine N (Fig. 8c).94 The specific surface area of CMOF is as high as 1082 m2 g−1, which fixes anions via electrostatic interaction of the carrier. This method of fixing anions is more stable and efficient than the metal oxide's Lewis acid–base interaction and polymer covalent bonding. The anion-immobilized CMOF is dispersed in PEO, and the P@CMOF composite electrolyte is prepared by hot pressing. The CMOF–NH2 group protects ether oxygen of the PEO chain by hydrogen bonding and removes impurities at the interface, so that the electrochemical window is extended to 4.97 V. The synergy between CMOF and polymer results in anion-capturing capacity and non-dendritic Li anode during Li deposition. This anion-immobilized electrolyte used in lithium metal batteries with LiFePO4 and LiFe0.15Mn0.85PO4 cathodes has an excellent rate and cyclic performance.

4.2. MOF as electrolytes for LSBs
MOFs and polymers with excellent conductivity have been studied as solid electrolytes in LSBs. Chiochan et al. grafted lithium sulfonate onto the UIO ligand (termed UIOSLi).47 After integrating a Li-based ionic liquid (Li-IL), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the resulting Li-IL/UIOSLi solid electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. LSBs with the Li-IL/UIOSLi solid electrolyte that preserves 84% of the initial capacity after 250 cycles with a capacity-fade rate of 0.06% per cycle. Han et al. used Mg-MOF-74 to modify the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based gel polymer electrolyte (MOF-PVDF-GPE).145 Benefiting from the abundant pores in the MOF skeleton, the prepared GPE not only fixed the large-size polysulfide anions but also trapped the electrolyte anions in the pores, thus promoting the uniform flow of lithium-ion and even deposition of Li (Fig. 9a). The Mg-MOF-74-modified GPE shows excellent LSB electrochemical performance, as shown in Fig. 9b. Compared with the liquid electrolyte and PVDF electrolyte, the MOF-PVDF GPE delivers the highest initial capacity of 1383.1 mA h g−1 with the lowest capacity decay of 0.14% each cycle.

5. Conclusion and outlook
In the past decade, due to the rapid development of MOF-based materials, an increasing number of MOF-based materials are used in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries. Although lithium-sulfur batteries have the natural industrial advantages of high energy density and low production cost, the use of suitable materials to solve the problems of polysulfide shuttle and lithium dendrite growth is still the key to promoting its commercialization. Fortunately, MOF-based materials have made breakthroughs as separators and solid electrolytes. As a separator, MOF-based materials can fundamentally solve the problems of poor mechanical properties, low polarity, and large-diaphragm pores in traditional Celgard separators. MOF-based separators can be combined with GO, CNT, etc., to increase the mechanical properties and eliminate the safety risk of dendrites piercing the separator. The open metal site can be used as a Lewis base to combine with LPSs to improve the ability to trap polysulfides. Adjustable pores can limit polysulfides, and since then further optimization can be achieved to inhibit the shuttle of polysulfide. As an electrolyte, MOF-based materials can increase the mobility of lithium ions, block PSs, and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites through the uniform deposition. Through further efforts in these two areas, we are expected to realize the commercialization of lithium–sulfur batteries and improve our lives.
Existing research shows that not all MOF-based composites are suitable as separators and electrolyte materials. However, there are still many challenges to be solved in their development.
(1) The influence of the open metal sites of MOF-based materials on the kinetics of sulfur oxidation and the degree of reduction has not been definitively concluded. At the same time, further research should explore the optimal metal site and optimize its coordination and valence. In addition, in the process of battery charging and discharging, the real-time changes between MOF-based materials and PSs should also be the focus of research.
(2) Most of the MOF-based materials have poor stability in the electrolyte, and hence, it is necessary to explore more MOF-based materials that can stably exist in the electrolyte. At the same time, when MOF-based materials are used as separators, it is necessary to further explore the compatibility of the material itself with the lithium anode.
(3) MOF-based materials are used in LSBs, but the mechanism of action between the electrolyte solvent and the lithium salt is not yet clear. Thus, further studies are required to explore the relationship between organic ligands and metal sites and anions, lithium salts, and solvents in the electrolyte through density functional theory calculations or molecular dynamics simulations.
(4) Based on the above article, the pore size and morphology of MOF-based materials have a certain influence on ion conductivity. Thus, further studies are required to explore the corresponding relationship, which may pave the way for explaining the conduction mechanism.
(5) The high cost and cumbersome manufacturing process of many MOFs and MOF-derived materials limit their large-scale applications in practical battery systems. New synthetic methods such as microwave and spray drying may be the scalable synthesis of MOFs and their derivatives at a relatively low cost, but lower cost synthesis methods still need further research.
(6) In different battery experiments, it is worth studying more types of MOFs as battery separators to explore whether they can provide more opportunities for the development of LSBs.
Although the development and research of MOFs, MOF-based composites, and MOF derivatives are still in a preliminary stage, their application in LSBs, especially separators and electrolytes, is definitely an important field of research. As people pay increasing attention to this field, there are fewer and fewer unresolved problems, there will inevitably be more breakthroughs, and the potential of MOFs and LSBs will be expanded.
