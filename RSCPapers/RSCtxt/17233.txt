Introduction
Over the past few years, organic semiconductors have been investigated intensively for their potential application in low cost, light-weight, flexible and large-area organic solar cells (OSCs)1–3 and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).4–6 Currently, to achieve high performance in organic electronics, π-conjugated and planar molecular backbones are highly preferred because of their easy packing via the intensive π–π interactions.7–12 For example, dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo [1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) with flat and rigid backbones reported by Sun et al. afforded the impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9.7% in OSCs.13 Also highly fused thiophene rings in PTDPPTFT4 facilitated the molecular ordering and alignments in its polymeric thin films, leading to the high charge carrier mobility of 2.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs.14 On the other hand, to obtain good solubility for solution-processed roll-to-roll manufacturing in printed organic electronics and also avoid the hindering of molecular packing, side-chain engineering is also important.15–19 By combining these two approaches, liquid crystalline (LC) organic semiconductors with planar molecular backbones and surrounding alkyl chains are usually developed for their advantages of large-area manufacturability for uniform films and capability of high carrier mobility.20–23 For instance, nematic liquid crystalline benzodithiophene-terthiophene-rhodanine (BTR) gave a maximum PCE value of 9.3% with a fill factor up to 77% in solar cells.24 Also a highly ordered LC phase of smectic E was observed for 2-decyl-7-phenyl-[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (Ph-BTBT-10) and owing to its self-organized LC nature, high charge carrier mobility over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs was finally achieved.25
However, although significant progress has been achieved for liquid crystalline organic semiconductors, the investigation of the relationship between molecular structures, self-organized molecular packing and also their charge transport is still urgently needed to further understand the liquid crystalline nature and then satisfy the requirements for commercial applications. Also it should be mentioned that the emissive liquid crystals with a highly fused thiophene backbone are seldom developed due to their complicated synthesis. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned considerations, isomeric TF1 and TF2 containing highly fused thiophene cores with liquid crystalline features were designed and synthesized here, in which a highly planar molecular structure was obtained for TF1 with the face-to-face sulfur atoms in the lateral region and a relatively twisted molecular backbone was observed for TF2 with the back-to-back sulfur atoms. It is worth noting that totally different intermolecular interactions were observed for TF1 and TF2 caused by their isomeric thiophene core, in which strong π–π stacking was achieved for TF1, whereas sulfur-involved nonbonding intermolecular interactions dominated in TF2, leading to the different fluorescence behaviors and also altered LC phases for these developed isomers. Finally, typical P-type charge transport behaviors were achieved in both TF1- and TF2-based OFETs. Also owing to the much ordered molecular packing in TF1, a higher charge carrier mobility of 3.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for TF1-based OFETs compared to TF2-based OFETs (7.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Aldrich, Acros, TCI) and used without further purification unless stated otherwise. Tributyl-(5-octyl-thiophen-2-yl)-stannane was purchased from SunaTech Inc. Compounds M1 and M2 were synthesized according to the corresponding literature.26
Characterization and measurements
All 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 MHz using CDCl3 as the solvent. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric measurements were performed on Bruker Bifiex III MALDI TOF. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2250 spectrophotometer. The UV-Vis spectra of thin film states for TF1 and TF2 were prepared by spin-coating using their corresponding o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were taken on an Edinburgh Instrument FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The transient decay spectra were measured on Fluoro-Cube of HORIBA. The absolute quantum yields (Φ) in both solution and thin films were obtained on an Edinburgh Instrument FLS980 Integrating sphere. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) samples were prepared by drying the corresponding TF1 or TF2 based dispersion in air overnight and then monitored via HR-TEM (JEOL-2100). Thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a TA Q200 Instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere. Polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and fluorescence micrograph analysis were undertaken using an Olympus BX51 microscope and a Mettler FP82HT hot stage to control the temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer from New D8 Advance of Bruker.
Theoretical calculation
All computations for molecular packing were fulfilled with the Gaussian 09 program package.27 Two monomers (TF1, TF2) and four formed dimers (D1-TF1, D2-TF1, D1-TF2 and D2-TF2) were fully optimized using M06-2X density functional theory (DFT). The standard 6-31G(d) basis set was used in the optimization.28 To refine energies, single-point energy calculations using the triple-zeta 6-311G(d,p) basis set, namely M06-2X/6-311G(d,p)//M06-2X/6-31G(d), were also carried out. Counterpoise corrections were computed by the method of Boys for the description of the basis set superposition error (BSSE).29 For a complex (e.g. AB), the BSSE and the interaction energy Ein can be obtained according to the following equations:E(BSSE) = (EA(A) − EAB(A)) + (EB(B) − EAB(B));Ein = (EAB(AB) + E(BSSE)) − (EA(A) + EB(B)) = EAB(AB) − (EAB(A) + EAB(B));where EAB(A) (or EAB(B)) is the energy of A (or B) using the basis set of AB, EA(A) (or EB(B)) is the energy of A (or B) using the basis set of A (or B), and EAB(AB) is the total energy of the complex. Note that the structure of A or B in the complex is used for EAB(A) and EA(A) (or EAB(B) and EB(B)). The deformation energy Ed and the total complex energy can be obtained according to the following equations:Ed = (EA(A) − EA(A′)) + (EB(B) − EB(B′));Etotal = Ein + Ed;where EA(A′) (or EB(B′)) is the energy of the separated A (or B). The calculations of UV-Vis spectra for TF1 and TF2 were performed by Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p).
Fabrication and characterization of organic field-effect transistors
The top-contact, bottom-gate organic field-effect transistors were fabricated by conventional techniques using doped Si as the gated electrode, SiO2 as the insulator layer, and Ag as both source and drain electrodes. Then thin films of TF1 and TF2 molecules were formed by spin-coating their o-DCB solutions (5 mg mL−1) and annealed at different temperatures for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, Ag source and drain contacts (50 nm in thickness) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the organic layer through a shadow mask. Electrical measurements of devices were carried in a clean and shielded box under air at room temperature (RT). The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime by using the equation Ids = (μWCi/2L)(Vg − Vt)2, where Ids is the drain–source current, μ is the field-effect mobility, W is the channel width (500 μm), L is the channel length (70 μm), Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, Vg is the gate voltage, and Vt is the threshold voltage.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The molecular structures of TF1 and TF2 are displayed in Scheme 1 and their synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). As shown, the Stille cross-coupling reaction was used between the isomeric fused-thiophene cores (compound M1 and compound M2) and tributyl-(5-octyl-thiophen-2-yl)-stannane using tetrakis-(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as catalyst to obtain the targets TF1 and TF2, respectively. The chemical structures of the molecules developed here were well confirmed by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF spectra. It should be mentioned that although similar highly fused thiophene rings were employed in TF1 and TF2, totally different solubility was observed. TF1 with the face-to-face sulfur atoms in the lateral region is easily soluble in common solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chlorobenzene (CB). Interestingly, TF2 with the back-to-back sulfur atoms is only soluble in the hot CB or o-DCB, and the poor solubility here for TF2 in contrast to TF1 is probably caused by its different molecular packing due to the larger intermolecular orbital overlaps through sulfur involved in nonbonding interactions.26,30

Optical properties

Fig. 1 displays the normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of TF1 and TF2 in o-DCB solution (a) and thin film states (b). Their corresponding absorption properties are also summarized (Table S1, ESI†). Owing to their similar chemical structures, similar absorption spectra in the range from 300 nm to 500 nm were achieved for TF1 and TF2 in o-DCB solution with the featured absorption peaks at 430 nm and 455 nm. Then, UV-Vis spectra for TF1 and TF1 in gas phase were also calculated by TD-DFT. A weak band at about 3.8 eV with the absorption located at 325 nm for both TF1 and TF2 was displayed (Fig. S1, ESI†). Then a much strong and broad absorption feature from 385 nm to 500 nm corresponding to S0 → S1 transition was also observed. According to the results by TD-DFT, the obvious absorption peaks located at about 430 nm and 455 nm for TF1 and TF2 were probably caused by their corresponding vibrational and vibronic transitions. After that, UV-Vis spectra for TF1 and TF2 in o-DCB solution at room temperature (25°) and high temperature (50°) were also measured (Fig. S2, ESI†). As observed, similar absorption spectra were obtained for both TF1 and TF2 under these different conditions, implying that these peaks were not caused by their aggregation behaviors. On the other hand, a significant red-shift was observed in the absorption profiles from solution to thin films for both molecules. To further investigate their optical properties in detail, UV-Vis spectra for TF1 and TF2 in thin films with and without annealing treatment were also investigated here (Fig. S3a, ESI†). As implied, the annealing treatment has no obvious effect on the absorption peaks at 430 nm and 455 nm for both TF1 and TF2, but it is worth noting that after annealing at 140° for 1 min, a new weak but broad peak at 520 nm finally appeared for TF1 due to the much ordered molecular aggregation and arrangement, implying that a much planar molecular structure with strong π–π stacking may dominate in TF1.31–33 However, similar absorption spectra were still recorded here for TF2 after annealing (Fig. S3b, ESI†), probably indicating the much disordered sulfur-involved nonbonding interactions in TF2.

As the molecular packing probably also affected their luminescence properties, the PL spectra of TF1 and TF2 in both solution and thin film states were also monitored here (Fig. 2a). As observed, similar PL spectra were displayed for the isomeric structures. Then their quantum yields (Φ) in solution were measured and summarized in Table 1. As displayed, emissive features with Φ of 73.29% and 62.53% were achieved for TF1 and TF2, respectively. On the other hand, although inferior fluorescence performances were observed for both TF1 and TF2 in solid state compared to that in solution, interestingly, higher quantum yield and longer lifetime were observed for TF2 (0.98%/1.2 ns) compared to that of TF1 (0.6%/0.8 ns) in films due to its smaller non-radiative decay rate (knr, Fig. 2b).34,35 The observed faint TF1 is proposed to be caused by its much planar molecular structures and also strong π–π stacking, which could quench the emission intensity seriously.36–38 Then the fluorescence measurements were also employed here to gain insight into their different nonbonding interactions by nano-precipitating their corresponding o-DCB solution into ethanol (c = 2 × 10−4 M, Vo-DCB:VEthanol = 1:9). As displayed, in contrast to the highly emissive solution of TF1, faint features were observed for TF2 due to the appearance of nano-precipitates caused by the strong sulfur-involved nonbonding interactions (Fig. 2c), which was also well-demonstrated by their corresponding TEM images with mono-dispersed nanospheres for TF1 and well-defined nano-fibers for TF2 (Fig. 2d). The results finally implied that strong π–π stacking may occur in TF1 and although TF2 exhibited a relatively twisted molecular backbone in contrast to TF1, strong sulfur-involved nonbonding intermolecular interactions could be achieved in its solid state.39,40

Theoretical calculation and proposed molecular packing
To further understand the different molecular interactions of TF1 and TF2, their optimized geometries and established packing models were also calculated by DFT (Fig. 3). As displayed in Fig. 3a, TF1 with the face-to-face sulfur atoms exhibited really good co-planarity, whereas an obvious twisting angle was observed for TF2 with the back-to-back sulfur atoms in the lateral regions. Also, to investigate the intermolecular interactions for TF1 and TF2, two different molecular packing models in TF1- and TF2-based dimers were established (Fig. 3b and c) and their corresponding energies were calculated (Table 2). For the first packing model with good molecular order, similar interaction energies (Ein) were achieved for TF1 and TF2, whereas D1-TF2 exhibited higher deformation energy (Ed) than D1-TF1, leading to the smaller complexation energy (Etotal) for TF1, which indicated that TF1 preferred to pack as the first model with good molecular order. However, totally different complexation energies were calculated for D2-TF1 and D2-TF2, implying that TF2 probably oriented as the second packing model. Interestingly, similar results with high reliability were obtained by both M06-2X/6-31G and M06-2X/6-311G methods in DFT here, indicating that TF1 with planar molecular structures could easily pack with each other orderly via the π–π interactions, then probably leading to the columnar arrangements. On the other hand, TF2 with twisted structures preferred the disordered packing model. It should be mentioned that the TF2 based packing model also exhibited much more outside-located sulfur atoms to facilitate the possibility of sulfur-involved intermolecular interactions, which further confirmed our above-mentioned results in the optical part.

Liquid crystalline properties
TGA was also conducted here to investigate the thermal properties of TF1 and TF2. As displayed, good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) at 456 °C and 438 °C was obtained for TF1 and TF2 (Fig. 4a), respectively. Then, owing to the highly fused thiophene cores and the surrounding alkyl chains in TF1 and TF2, discotic LC properties could be probably achieved for both molecules,41 which can also give some clues to understand their different molecular packing. Therefore, the phase transition behavior of TF1 and TF2 was then evaluated by DSC (Fig. 4b) and POM, respectively. As observed, an obvious birefringent fluid is outlined for TF1 on heating at 129 °C and this becomes much clear at 162 °C. A similar phenomenon is found for TF2 with the melting point at 87 °C, with the fluid becoming clear at 146 °C. The textures recorded on cooling at 140 °C and 120 °C were also outlined for TF1 and TF2 (Fig. 4c and d). As displayed, columnar arrangements could be easily formed for TF1 to obtain the columnar phase (Fig. 4c), indicating its much ordered π–π stacking. On the other hand, some disordered arrangements probably occurred in TF2 (Fig. 4d), demonstrating its twisted structure and also strong sulfur-involved nonbonding intermolecular interactions. To further demonstrate the different molecular packing for TF1 and TF2, the X-ray diffractions in thin films were fully measured. As displayed, TF1 exhibited a strong peak at 2θ = 4.25°, corresponding to the 100 diffraction with a d spacing of 21.2 Å (Fig. S4, ESI†). Then, weak but visible peaks at 5.46° and 8.28° for TF1 can also be achieved, indicating the featured lamellar molecular packing, which is one important characteristic for the columnar arrangement in liquid crystalline materials.42,43 On the other hand, in contrast to TF1, weak and inferior peaks at 4.47° and 6.57° were observed in TF2, further indicating that the molecular packing here is much more disordered than TF1. Additionally, peaks at around 21.52° were assigned to the packing of alkyl chains for TF1 and TF2.

It is interesting that both TF1 and TF2 exhibited liquid crystalline properties with the featured textures and also visible fluorescent emissions in solid state; therefore, the optical micrographs during the LC phase were recorded in situ under altered channels, including the fluorescent channel (PL channel), POM channel and also PL + POM channel (Fig. 5). Absolutely, the textures for our newly developed liquid crystals (TF1 and TF1) can be recorded by POM clearly. However, it is interesting that the fluorescent signals can also be monitored for TF1 and TF2 when heating or cooling around the melting or clearing point, indicating that the textures for TF1 and TF2 at the LC phase can also be achieved under three different channels, which actually provided another facile way to investigate the liquid crystalline properties of the newly developed molecules.

Charge transfer properties
As demonstrated, totally different molecular packing dominated in TF1 and TF2, which probably could also affect their charge transport properties seriously. Therefore, the top-contact and bottom-gate (TC-BG) organic field-effect transistors were also fabricated here. Firstly, TF1- and TF2-based OFETs were fabricated without any treatment and their corresponding transfer or output characteristics were recorded (Fig. S5, ESI†). As observed, both TF1 and TF2 exhibited typical P-type charge transport behavior with comparable hole mobility (μFET) of 1.7 × 10−4 and 3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as the current on/off ratios (Ion/Ioff) in the order of 104–105, respectively. Then, because both TF1 and TF2 exhibited liquid crystalline properties, thermal annealing treatments at the LC phase were thought to be beneficial to form their featured molecular packing, finally leading to the probably different charge transfer in OFETs. Fig. 6 displays the transfer (a: TF1, c: TF2) and output (b: TF1, d: TF2) characteristics of TF1- and TF2-based OFET devices after thermal treatment. As displayed, although enhanced hole mobility was obtained for both TF1- and TF2-based OFETs, tiny improvement was observed for TF2, whereas significant enhancement was achieved in TF1-based OFETs with the maximum charge carrier mobility up to 3.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that much ordered molecular packing in TF1 and disordered molecular packing in TF2 actually affected their charge transfer performance seriously in OFET devices. The corresponding data are also listed in Table 3.

Conclusions
In conclusion, isomeric semiconductors of TF1 and TF2 with fused-thiophene cores were synthesized. TF1 with face-to-face sulfur atoms in the lateral region exhibited much planar molecular structures, leading to the intensive π–π intermolecular interactions and also columnar arrangements during the LC phase. For TF2 with back-to-back sulfur atoms, twisted molecular structures with strong sulfur-involved nonbonding intermolecular interactions were observed, resulting in the disordered LC phase. Finally, the observed totally different molecular packing affected their charge transfer properties in OFETs seriously, in which a much higher charge carrier mobility of 3.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for TF1-based OFETs.
