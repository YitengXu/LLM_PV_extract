1. Introduction
The vast majority of commercially available polymers feature traditional “organic” elements such as C, N and O as integral structural components. However many are now realizing the added benefits that can be gained when inorganic elements are incorporated within a polymeric framework. Initial progress in this area was slow, however, as a result of key recent advances in synthetic inorganic chemistry, new inorganic polymer architectures are continually being discovered that display advantageous properties such as extensive flame resistance, high flexibility, redox activity, chemical sensing, photovoltaic and electrochromic behaviour (to name a few). This report serves to highlight the rapid growth of inorganic and organometallic polymer chemistry by showcasing important activities in this field selected from the 2011 scientific literature.
This review article adopts a similar organisational structure to the previous Annual Report in this series.1 After this Introduction, an overview of the recent books and review articles in the domain of inorganic and organometallic polymers will be given. The proceeding three sections will be focused on research advances within the well-established inorganic polymer classes: polysiloxanes (silicones), polysilanes and their heavier element congeners, and polyphosphazenes. The next section will be devoted to the synthesis and applications of new polymers bearing Main Group (p-block) elements. Ferrocene and related metallocene-containing polymers will then be highlighted, with a final section on transition metal-based macromolecules to close this report.
Throughout this article, primary attention will be given to discussing the synthesis and novel properties of new, covalently linked, linear macromolecules wherein inorganic elements represent an integral component of their core structure.
2. Books and reviews of inorganic polymer science
In 2011, an issue of Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics was devoted to “New frontiers in functional polymers”,2 while Chemistry of Materials published a special issue on “π-Functional materials.”3 Prof. Fred Wudl was honoured with a thematic issue on bulk heterojunction solar cells in the Journal of Materials Chemistry.4 A book detailing the photochemical and photophysical properties of polymers with [Re(CO)3L]+ side groups (L = ligand) was published.5 In addition, a comprehensive volume on “Advanced functional materials” appeared wherein the role of inorganic polymers in advancing modern materials science was described.6
Cheng and Jäkle recently reviewed boron-containing polymers and their use as precursors for the construction of well-defined nanomaterials.7 Boronic acid functionalized polymers have found their way into various biomedical applications and, consequently, a timely review in this area appeared in 2011.8
Progress towards the development of new white organic light emitting devices (WOLEDs) including those based upon inorganic polymers, was recently summarised.9
The field of polymer solar cells is growing at a tremendous rate, with new photovoltaic materials containing inorganic-organic conjugated heterocycles, such as thiophenes, adopting a central role. Specifically, low optical band gap polymers based upon thienopyrazines, thiophene and fused thiophene subunits were surveyed.10–13 Leclerc and coworkers reviewed recent advances in the preparation of processable low band gap polymers for use in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells;14 in a related article, the field of polymer-based solar cells featuring the ubiquitous donor/acceptor combination poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT/1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl[6,6]C61 (PCBM) was published.15 Brédas and coworkers described the use of theoretical methods to instigate further improvements in the design and performance of photovoltaic polymers.16 The nascent field of polytellurophenes was reviewed by Jahnke and Seferos with particular focus on discussing future challenges associated with the widespread use of these materials for opticoelectronic applications.17 A survey outlining various controlled polymerisation methods to access polymers with semiconducting properties was published recently,18 while a detailed summary of the highly useful Stille coupling reaction and its use to construct functional materials containing inorganic elements as active components was also published in 2011.19
The preparation of metallopolymers and their recent use in constructing novel structures via self-assembly has been summarised.20
3. Polysiloxanes and related polymers
Poly(silaarylenesiloxanes) containing conjugated dimethylcyclopentadithiophene units were recently described (1).21 These materials exhibited considerable thermal stability (up to ca. 450 °C) with high fluorescence quantum yields obtained when phenyl groups were present at silicon.21 The same group also reported the synthesis of siloxanes with fluorenyl and silole spacer units (2) via the condensation reaction of silane diol precursors in the presence of catalytic amounts of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidinium 2-ethylhexanoate.22 Notably, higher fluorescence quantum yields involving the polymeric siloles were obtained relative to the monomeric precursors.22  
Polydimethylsiloxane-ethynylenephenylene copolymers were prepared and shown to be suitable precursors for the generation of SiOC ceramics upon pyrolysis.23 A series of novel tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl [(Me3OSi)3Si] grafted polymers 4 and 5 were synthesized via the ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) or addition polymerisation of the silane-functionalized norbornene-derivative 3; both of these polymers showed selective permeability characteristics for C1 to C4 hydrocarbons and are thus promising candidates for use as separation media.24 Poly(diphenylacetylene)s have been cross-linked with siloxane residues to yield polymer membranes with exceptionally high degrees of gas permeability.25 A series of pentablock copolymers were prepared featuring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and fluorinated polymethacrylate blocks exhibited significant surface wetting resistance to both water and hexadecane.26  
Impressive advances in the field of nanotechnology were made possible with the use of the polymeric workhorse, polydimethylsiloxane [Me2SiO]n (PDMS). For example, the direct patterning of substrates with elastomeric PDMS was achievable via dip-pen nanolithography (DPN). Using this method, structures with dimensions as small as 2.7 μm could be patterned in under 1s; this method is promising within the context of fabricating biological micromechanical systems.27 A rapid and inexpensive route to prepare antireflective coatings was developed using a PDMS stamp to emboss nanospike morphologies into an organic-inorganic hybrid polymer (Ormocer) layer supported by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Upon transferring the nanospike pattern onto the film, a drastic reduction in optical reflectance from a value of ca. 5% for pristine films to 0.03% was noted.28 In another report, Ross and coworkers disclosed the synthesis of various nanostructures with spatial resolution below 10 nm via the use of PDMS-polystyrene block copolymers as templating agents.29 The fabrication of high quality PDMS stamps by the gamma ray-induced cross-linking of exposed PDMS chains has been reported.30 Lastly, PDMS microshell arrays, when employed as coatings for solar cell devices, mitigate solar cell degradation by suppressing the accumulation of airborne dust particles.31
Incorporation of Tb3+ complexes within PDMS hosts was reported to give light-emitting hybrid materials with green light emission and quantum yields of 68%.32 Polysiloxanes with pendant cationic cyclopentadienyl(aryl)iron, [CpFe(aryl); Cp = η5–C5H5] moieties were recently prepared and their solid state morphologies were examined by SEM.33 In a related study, polysiloxanes featuring redox-active ferrocenyl and (aryl)Cr(CO)3 side groups were shown to give electroactive films with discrete redox events for each metal environment present; moreover these materials are promising precursors for the generation of metal-rich ceramics via pyrolysis.34
Cylindrical micelles with conjugated polythiophene cores were formed from the assembly of well-defined P3HT-b-PDMS block copolymers (P3HT = 3-hexylthiophene), and laser confocal fluorescence microscopy identified the presence of emissive P3HT segments.35
4. Polysilanes, polygermanes, polystannanes, polycarbosilanes and related polymers
A series of low band gap polymers containing dithienylsilole units were prepared (6).36 It was shown that optimal device performances were obtained within bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells when thiophene capping groups were present. The morphology of the polymer/PCBM blends did not change appreciably with the nature of the capping agent, however the optical properties varied markedly, implying that end groups can negatively impact device performance by either creating charge carrier traps states or by participating in undesired chemical transformations during device operation.36 Recently, polysiloles such as 7 were shown to yield high power conversion efficiencies of ca. 5% when incorporated into BHJ solar cells.37,38 Field-effect transistors were prepared from polydithenylsiloles and a dramatic improvement in device performance was noted when compact spiroorgano groups were bound to silicon in place of spacially extended linear alkyl chains.39  
High molecular weight polysilafluorenes 8 were synthesized via Yamamoto coupling of dibromosilafluorene monomers in the presence of Ni(COD)2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene).40 These polymers were incorporated into polymer light emitting devices (PLED) and yielded bright blue electroluminescence with high thermal stabilities.40 An in depth study involving copolymers with silafluorene subunits in tandem with various heterocyclic nitrogen-containing heterocycles (such as carbazoles, oxadiazoles and triazoles) was described along with their use in PLEDs.41 A polysilavinylenefluorene copolymer 9 with polyether side chains has been shown to be a viable sensor for alkali metal cations (Li+, Na+ and K+).42 A promising hole-transport/electron blocking polymer 10 was described in 2011, and its incorporation into bulk heterojunction solar cells led to improvements in both open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC) of the devices.43  
The incorporation of luminescent silole heterocycles into polymeric arrays was achieved by RhI-catalysed alkyne hydrosilylation chemistry; these polymers also acted as efficient optical sensors for nitroaromatic compounds such as picric acid.44 The synthesis of conjugated organosilanes from the “Click” reaction of diethynylsilanes with 1,4-diazidobenzene was also reported.45
Polymethylphenylsilanes, [Me(Ph)Si]n, modified with dansyl fluorophores were prepared and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements indicate that non-radiative energy transfer from the polysilane backbone to the dansyl group transpires to yield PL with emission maxima near 590 nm.46 Fluorescent polymer-silver metal nanocomposites were synthesized from the in situ reduction of poly(silylene-co-silyne)s 11 with silver acetate, and concomitant oxidative cleavage of the side chain Si–Si linkages to yield Si–O–Si bonding environments was noted.47 The novel use of various poly(hydrosilane)s 12 as radical initiators was reported; this work provides another potential synthetic tool for the controlled radical polymerisation of olefins.48 Helical polydiarylsilanes featuring one chiral side-group at each silicon centre have been shown to aggregate into ordered structures that undergo emission of circularly polarised light when excited with a high energy unpolarised light source.49 The controlled electropolymerisation of diorganodichlorosilanes R2SiCl2 enabled the synthesis of well-defined polysilane block copolymers such as [PhSiMe]m-b-[BuSiMe]n to be prepared.50 A series of network polygermasilanes with tunable Si/Ge ratios in 0.25 increments were synthesised via Wurtz coupling of BuECl3 co-monomers (E = Ge and Si) in the presence of alkali metal reductants; upon increasing incorporation of Ge into the 1–2 nm sized network domains, the observed PL became red-shifted and particles with pure Ge cores exhibited intense red-coloured photoluminescence at 690 nm at 77 K.51
Highly promising photovoltaic dithienylgermole polymers such as 1352 have been reported by a number of groups in 2011 with solar cell power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 4%.52–55 An inverted BHJ solar cell featuring dithienylgermoles yielded an impressive PCE of 7.3%.56  
A detailed in situ119Sn NMR study of the polymerisation of diorganodichlorostannanes R2SnCl2 (R = alkyl and Ph groups) in the presence of sodium metal in liquid ammonia was reported; this study conclusively identified the formation of polystannanes [R2Sn]n along with cyclic oligomers and various anionic tin species such as [R2SnH]− and [R4Sn2]2−.57
5. Polyphosphazenes and related polymers
Polyphosphazenes bearing vitamin residues (vitamin E, B6 and L1) were prepared by Allcock and coworkers, and their hydrolytic sensitivity and stability to varying pH conditions was investigated; the primary mechanism of polymer degradation in these systems involved hydrolytic cleavage of the backbone P–N linkages.58 Glycosylated polyphosphazenes such as 14 were generated via the reaction of alkyne-functionalised polyphosphazenes (e.g. [(HCCCH2NH)2PN]n) with azido-terminated sugars under “Click” coupling conditions.59
A novel proton-conducting polyphosphazene 15 for use in PEM fuel cells was recently discovered with conductivities as high as 0.04 S cm−1 noted at 130 °C under anhydrous conditions.60 Polyphosphazenes with para-substituted phenoxy groups [(4-RC6H4O)2PN]n (R = Me, iPr and tBu) were prepared and their permeability to O2, N2, CO2 and CH4 were tested; when smaller alkyl groups were present, high gas permeabilities were observed, however selectivity (and gas separation abilities) improved with the most hindered tert-butylated polyphosphazene [(4-tBu-C6H4O)2PN]n.61  
6. Other main-group element-containing polymers
The dehydrocoupling of methylamine-borane, MeNH2·BH3 in the presence of the photocatalyst [CpFe(CO)2]2 gave polymethylaminoborane [MeNH–BH2]n16 in 90% yield [PDI = 1.8; Mw = 1.7 × 105 g mol−1], while prolonged irradiation of 16 instigated further loss of H2 and the generation of N-methylborazine 17.62 In related work by Manners, Weller and coworkers, MeNH2·BH3 was polymerised to give high molecular weight 16 in a rapid manner in the presence of the well-defined Rh catalysts, [Rh(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2)(C6H5F)][BArF4] (ArF = 3,5-(F3C)2C6H3; n = 3–5) with extremely low catalyst loadings of ca. 0.2 mol%.63 In a separate publication, the metal-catalysed dehydrogenation polymerisation of the linear diborazane MeNH2–BH2–NHMe–BH3 was shown to yield 16.64 This report also included examples of a novel metal-free hydrogenation reaction involving H2 transfer from amine-borane adducts, R2NH·BH3 to in situ generated BN bonds (e.g. R2NBH2); this work adds important mechanistic insight into the nature of amino-borane dehydropolymerisation.64  
The group of Jäkle reported an elegant synthetic pathway for the controlled preparation of luminescent conjugated organoborane oligomers 18. Using a combination of optical (UV–Vis) and electrochemical (cyclic and square wave voltammetry) methods, an extended conjugation length of n = 5 was determined.65 The same group also prepared novel polythiophenes featuring electron deficient dimesitylboryl (Mes2B-; Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2) groups appended to a polythiophene backbone (cf.19); these materials are of interest as components for polymeric solar cells and as optical sensing materials.66 Dimesitylboryl groups were also incorporated into polymeric arrays containing π-conjugated carbazole units and efficient electro- and photo-luminescence was noted.67,68  
Copolymers consisting of fluorene residues linked by BODIPY units (e.g.20) were shown to undergo efficient energy transfer from the fluorene groups to BODIPY upon excitation with UV-light, resulting in strong emission in the visible region; this property was later used to image rat liver cells via confocal fluorescence microscopy.69 Conjugated alternate donor-acceptor copolymers featuring electron-rich BODIPY groups joined to electron deficient aromatic heterocycles via alkyne linkers were prepared and used as semiconducting components within organic thin-film transistors (OTFT).70 Polymethacrylate block copolymers bearing photoactive BODIPY side groups in one block exhibited novel thermal dependence on the observed luminescence; moreover hydrogels were constructed which displayed drastic solvent-dependant light emission due to varying degrees of swelling.71 Near IR absorption, and concomitantly narrow optical band gaps of 1.3 eV, were obtained with the alkynylarylene-BODIPY polymer (21).72  
Poly(methylmethacrylate)s which were end-capped with pyridyl groups, reacted cleanly with (F5C6)2BCl to form cationic boronium complexes of the general form [(F5C6)2B·py-PMMA-py·B(C6F5)2]2+ (py = pyridyl).73 These boronium-terminated polymers catalysed the polymerisation of fluoromethacrylates with activities that approached that of monomeric boronium-pyridine adducts.73 A novel solid state polymer was synthesised, [Rb(GaH2)]n, which contained extended gallate chains {[GaH2]n}n− consisting of discrete Ga–Ga bonds (as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction); this material is of potential interest as a solid state hydrogen storage material.74
A structurally authenticated stannylphosphonium coordination polymer {[Me3Sn(Me2PCH2CH2PMe2)]+[AlCl4]−}n with intrachain P-Sn-P linkages was synthesised by Burford et al.75 A highly fluorinated polystyrene polymer with pendant phosphonic acid groups (23) was prepared via a Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction involving polypentafluorostyrene 22, followed by subsequent hydrolysis of the silylether, –OSiMe3 residues; the resulting hydrolysed polymer 23 displayed proton conductivities (0.1 S cm−1) which greatly exceeded that found in Nafion 117 (0.075 S cm−1; 108 °C; 105 Pa water vapor pressure)].76  
Polystyrenes functionalised with phosphonium (R4P+) groups were recently prepared and useful ionic exchange properties were noted.77 By attaching redox-active viologen groups onto a poly(vinylphosphonate) backbone, novel electrochromic polymers were obtained which could be further incorporated into cross-linked silica matrices with potential applications in colour displays envisioned.78 A versatile method of obtaining polyvinylphosphonates was disclosed wherein lanthanide complexes (e.g. LnCp3; Cp = η5-C5H5) initiate the group transfer polymerisation of vinylphosphonates, (RO)2P(O)–CHCH2, to give polyvinylphosphonates of very high molecular weight (>2.5 × 105 g mol−1).79 Highly efficient blue phosphorescence was observed in the novel phosphine-oxide containing polymer 24.80 The superior performance of this polymer in devices was attributed to the high electron transport mobility in the main chain in conjunction with efficient hole transport via the carbazole side chains.80 Chujo and coworkers prepared a stable polymeric array containing diarsine repeat units (25).81
A novel class of oligomers containing fluorene residues linked by –NSN– units have been reported (26); these materials show significantly red-shifted absorptions relative to oligofluorenes and charge transfer between these polymers and the electron acceptor, PCBM, was uncovered via fluorescence quenching studies; thus these materials could be useful candidates for use in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.82  
By far the most active field of inorganic polymer science at the moment is the use of polythiophenes as photovoltaic materials for bulk heterojunction solar cells. Due to the enormous growth of this field in 2011, only selected highlights from this exciting area will be listed in this review. Welsh and Bazan showed that coordination of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 to adjacent pyridyldiazole heterocycles in 27 gave a polymer 28 that had a drastically lower band gap in relation to the starting copolymer [27: λmax = 805 nm; 28: λmax = 998 nm].83 Notably the B(C6F5)3 unit can be decomplexed from 28 (to regenerate 27) in the presence of pyridine.83  
A series of high performance solar cells were reported in 2011 that each feature conjugated sulfur-based heterocycles as integral components, with solar power conversion efficiencies as high as 7%.84–86 A novel air-stable BHJ device was constructed using polymer 29 and PCEs as high as 6.2% were reported.87 Incorporation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a polymer blend with photoactive polymers within BHJ solar cells gave devices with superior thermal and structural stability without significant loss in performance.88 With the goal of replacing the molecular acceptor unit PCBM in solar cells with polymer-based electron acceptor materials, Tashima, Hashimoto and coworkers, reported an elegant study in which they investigated various all-polymer devices wherein both the donor and acceptor materials were polymers; in one instance, a very impressive PCE of 2.3% was obtained which stands as a current record for polymer-polymer blend devices.89 Ingenious routes to polythiophenes were uncovered that take advantage of thiophene C–H bond activation chemistry.90,91 Kumada coupling remains an important method to prepare polythiophenes and, not surprisingly, detailed mechanistic studies involving this transformation were described in 2011.92,93
Polyselenophenes are beginning to emerge as an important class of materials for opticoelectronic applications. A highly regioregular (ca. 90%) poly(3-alkyl-2,5-selenylenevinylene) 30 was recently prepared and its use in field effect transistors (FETs) was demonstrated.94 Highly tunable electrochromism from the visible to near-IR region was observed in films of poly(3,4-propylenedioxyselenophene) 31.95,96 Photovoltaic devices with moderate PCEs were fabricated using polymer selenophenes such as 32.97 Poly(3-hexyl)selenophenes (P3HSs) with controlled molecular weights in the range Mn = 5900 to 19900 g mol−1 were prepared and their optical and morphological properties were analyzed; this study conclusively identified two important phase types for these polymers with varying degrees of interchain π–π stacking observed.98  
7. Ferrocene-containing and related metallocene polymers
A novel heterobimetallic block copolymer (33) with ferrocene and cobaltocenium subunits was prepared via the sequential photo-initiated ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of strained metallocenophanes.99 Moreover the same report details the construction of cylindrical micelles with iron-rich cores and cobalt-containing corona; cyclic voltammetry indicated that each of the oxidation/reduction waves attributable to the metals in the constituent blocks were well separated by 1.5 V.99
An elegant synthetic pathway to polymethacrylates containing redox active Co complexes as side groups (34) was reported by the group of Ragogna.100 In a related study, polymethacrylates with ferrocene side chains were also disclosed in 2011.101 The widely used “Click” cycloaddition reaction between azido groups and alkynes was used to prepare polyferrocenes (35) linked via triazole heterocycles; although the PDIs obtained varied considerably (1.5 to 6), polymers with molecular weights as high as 5.27 × 104 g mol−1 were obtained.102  
Polythiophenes containing pendant –B(Ar)Fc groups [Ar = Mes or Trip; Trip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2; Fc = (C5H4)Fe(C5H5)] were synthesised by Jäkle and coworkers, and cyclic voltammetry indicated that the reversible oxidation of the Fc units transpires first, followed by two sequential oxidation events involving the polythiophene backbones.103
In a collaborative effort from the groups of Manners and Winnik, a series of papers featuring organometallic polyferrocenylsilane (PFS) block copolymers were published. For example, the reversible cross-linking within a polyisoprene (PI) corona of a PFS-PI micelle was reported. Addition of a Pt(0) catalyst instigates cross-linking and gel formation, however the subsequent addition of the chelating diphosphine, dppe (Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2) leads to degellation.104 The reversible redox-driven assembly of polystyrene (PS)-PFS block copolymers was studied in depth; amorphous PS-b-PFS was shown to yield spherical micelles upon oxidation with [(4-BrC6H4)3N]SbX6 salts (X = Cl or F), while re-reduction of the Fe centres with  [Cp* = (η5-Me5C5)] caused complete disassembly and reformation of individual PS-b-PFS polymer strands.105 A thorough study of the crystallisation-driven self-assembly of PI-b-PFS block copolymers into cylindrical micelles of controllable size was reported.106 A facile route to periodic arrays of Fe2O3 was achieved via the co-assembly of PS-b-PVP (PVP = poly(vinylpyridine)) block copolymers with ferroceneacetic acid, followed by treatment of the resulting metallopolymer with oxygen plasma and/or pyrolysis at 450 °C.107
8. Other metal-containing polymers
A water-soluble metallopolymer 36 derived from the binding of ditopic N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with palladium exhibited an impressive ability to catalyze the Suzuki coupling of aryl chlorides with arylborinic acids in water.108 The group of Bergens reported a very active (and reusable) polymer supported RhI catalyst 37 for the asymmetric cycloisomerization of 1,6-enynes.109 A metallopolymer with a Pt-organoacetylene backbone and pendant oligoamide side groups was shown to be a colourimetric sensor for a wide range of ions (Ag+, Li+, Cs+, Fe3+ and M2+; M = Hg, Pb, Mg, Cg, Ca, Ni, Cu, Zn, Co); moreover fluorescence quenching in the presence of Ag+ was also noted.110
MacLachlan and coworkers have developed organometallic micelles featuring Prussian Blue chromophores [–Fe(CN)5] that undergo dramatic colour change from blue to purple upon binding of Zn2+.111 Composite materials constructed from PS-b-PVP block copolymers have been shown to assemble into metal-rich spherical and worm-like micelles when the pyridine groups of the PVP blocks are bound to phosphotungstic (H3PW12O40) and silicotungstic acid (H4SiW12O40) clusters, respectively; this study represents a promising route towards assembling magnetically and optically active polyoxometalates into well defined arrays.112 Paramagnetic polymers with ionic liquid properties such as 38 were recently described; films of 38 interacted strongly with applied magnetic fields and the use of this polymer as a reusable catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylations was demonstrated.113  
The use of metallopolymers in solar cell devices remains an active field of study. Promising low band gap materials based upon platinum-alkyne polymers were reported,114,115 and the zinc porphorhydrin-copolymer 39 was recently introduced by Tan and coworkers, with modest PCEs reported.116 In reminiscent work, polymers containing zinc porphyrin architectures separated by aniline residues demonstrated low band gaps and novel light emitting properties.117 Highly efficient red-light emitting electrophosphorescent polymers containing fluorene and carbazole conjugated units with Ir quinolate complexes as side chains were reported.118 Lastly, orthometallated Ir(III) complexes were attached to polystyrene scaffolds to yield red light emitting metallopolymers with high stabilities.119
