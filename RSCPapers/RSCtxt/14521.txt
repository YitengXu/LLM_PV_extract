    , Accepted 23rd April 2018First published on 3rd May 2018AbstractPrevious investigations [H. L. Zhuang and R. G. Hennig, J. Phys. Chem. C, 2013, 117, 20440–20445; J. Kang, S. Tongay, J. Zhou, J. Li and J. Wu, Appl. Phys. Lett., 2013, 102, 012111] demonstrated that molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting. However, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in MoS2 remain in the same spatial regions, resulting in a high rate of recombination. Using first-principles calculations, we designed a MoS2-based heterostructure by stacking MoS2 on two-dimensional zinc oxide (ZnO) and investigated its structural, electronic, and optical properties. The interaction at the MoS2/ZnO interface was found to be dominated by van der Waals (vdW) forces. The energy levels of both water oxidation and reduction lie within the bandgap of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure, which guarantee their occurrence for water splitting. Moreover, a type-II band alignment and a large built-in electric field are formed at the MoS2/ZnO interface, which ensure the enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In addition, strong optical absorption in the visible region was also found in the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure, indicating that it has potential for application in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.
1 Introduction
Graphene has been widely investigated because of its superb properties and application in many important fields.1–10 The rise of graphene has also encouraged researchers to find other two-dimensional (2D) materials.11,12 Among these materials, MoS2 has attracted much attention because of its interesting electronic,13,14 thermal,15 and optical16,17 properties. It exhibits a robust direct-gap semiconducting nature, and the bandgap decreases from about 1.5 eV for a MoS2 monolayer to about 0.3 eV for bulk MoS2.13 The use of MoS2 in nanoelectronics,18 spintronics,19–21 valleytronics,22–24 and even bioapplications25 has been explored, and there is no doubt that MoS2 is a very promising 2D material.
Meanwhile, photocatalytic water splitting has been considered as an ideal approach to provide clean energy without polluting the environment. Many investigations26–30 focused on finding an efficient photocatalyst for this reaction. In particular, previous investigations31,32 found that MoS2 is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting. However, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in MoS2 remain in the same spatial regions, resulting in a high rate of recombination. Hence, some strategies must be adopted to resolve this issue.
A very popular method of tuning the properties of 2D materials is forming 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures because the resulting electronic, magnetic, and optical properties surpass those of the individual layers.33–44 Among the various types of vdW heterostructures, type-II (staggered)45 heterostructures are promising for attaining efficient charge-carrier separation because the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction-band minimum (CBM) exist in different layers. Therefore, when the photogenerated electron–hole pairs split at the interface, the electrons are transferred to one layer and the holes to another. This feature makes type-II heterostructures very suitable for application in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. For example, Bernardi et al.46 investigated photovoltaic devices based on the MoS2/WS2 bilayer. They found that the MoS2 and WS2 monolayers form a type-II heterostructure, which exhibits a power-conversion efficiency of up to ∼1% and much higher power density than those of existing ultrathin solar cells. Very recently, Niu et al.47 designed many arsenene-based type-II heterostructures that can be used not only as photocatalysts for water splitting, but also in solar cells with high power-conversion efficiency of ∼20%. Suffice it to say that designing new MoS2-based type-II heterostructures is a highly demanding task.
In recent years, ZnO has also attracted much interest among researchers.48 Unlike graphene, which is a semimetal, ZnO is a direct-bandgap semiconductor.49 This bandgap is sensitive to the layer thickness and surface functionalization.50 ZnO nanoribbons with zigzag edges exhibit magnetic behaviour independent of their width,49,51 and this magnetic behaviour can be modulated by utilizing the stacking effect51 and a transverse electric field.52 More importantly, many research groups have successfully synthesized ZnO layers.53–55 All these investigations suggest that ZnO is an important 2D semiconducting material. Therefore, in this study, we carried out ab initio calculations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of the MoS2/ZnO bilayer. Our results suggest that the bilayer system is stable. The MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure forms a typical type-II band alignment and a large built-in electric field, which lead to effective separation of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure also exhibits good optical-absorption ability in the visible region, which suggests that it can potentially be used in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.
2 Computational details
First-principles calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),56 which is based on the density functional theory (DFT) in a plane-wave basis set with the projector-augmented wave method.57 The exchange correlation functional was approximated by the generalized-gradient approximation developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof58 for optimizing the structures, and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional59 was used to calculate the electronic and optical properties of all the systems. The DFT-D3 method of Grimme60 was used to describe the weak dispersion forces. The energy cutoff for plane-wave expansion was set to 550 eV. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) sampling was carried out by using 21 × 21 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack61k-point grids, and a large vacuum space spanning 20 Å was added in the z direction. All the structures were fully relaxed using the conjugated-gradient method until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was less than 0.01 V Å.
The stability of the heterostructure is characterized by the binding energy between the two monolayers, which is defined asEb = EMoS2 + EZnO − EMoS2/ZnO,where Eb is the binding energy; and EMoS2, EZnO, and EMoS2/ZnO are the total energy of the MoS2 monolayer, ZnO monolayer, and MoS2/ZnO heterostructure, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
We first investigated the geometric and electronic properties of pristine MoS2 and ZnO monolayers. For the MoS2 monolayer (Fig. 1(a)), the lattice parameters and the Mo–S bond length are 3.16 and 2.41 Å, respectively. According to the Bader charge-population analysis,62–64 a Mo atom possesses a charge of +1.06|e|, while an S atom has a charge of −0.53|e|. Fig. 1(b) shows the band structure of MoS2, which is a direct-gap semiconductor with both CBM and VBM located at K point in the BZ. The bandgap is 2.24 eV, which is consistent with the value (2.36 eV; obtained by using the many-body G0W0 approach) previously reported by Zhuang et al.31 For the ZnO monolayer (Fig. 1(c)), the lattice parameters and the Zn–O bond length are 3.29 and 1.82 Å, respectively. Because of the large difference between the electronegativity of Zn and O, the Zn and O atoms have charges of +1.20|e| and −1.20|e|, respectively. Moreover, ZnO is also a direct-gap semiconductor with both the CBM and VBM located at Γ point in the BZ (Fig. 1(d)). The bandgap of ZnO is 3.29 eV, which is also in good agreement with the value (3.57 eV, obtained by using the many-body G0W0 approach) reported by Topsakal et al.,49 confirming the reliability of our calculations.

Band structures of (b) pristine MoS2 and (d) pristine ZnO; the Fermi level is set to zero, and it is indicated by the black dashed line. 
The MoS2/ZnO heterostructure can be constructed by stacking the two layers together. Since the electronic properties of MoS2 are sensitive to strain,65 we fixed the lattice constant of MoS2 and constructed the heterostructure by using a MoS2 primitive cell and a ZnO primitive cell. A low biaxial strain of −3.95% was applied to the ZnO layer. The strain tunes the bandgap of ZnO from 1.65 to 1.63 eV, but its direct-gap semiconducting nature remains unchanged. Thus, the model used in this study should be sufficient to mimic the actual properties of the heterostructure even if the values of the lattice parameters are only approximate.
We checked various configurations of the MoS2/ZnO heterostructure to determine the one with the highest stability. In the most energetically favourable configuration (Fig. 2(a)) with a binding energy of 31.11 meV Å−2, the Zn atom in the ZnO layer slightly protrudes from the ZnO plane and tends to move toward the three S atoms in the MoS2 layer, mainly owing to the strong electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged S atoms and positively charged Zn atoms. This strong interaction also results in a small interlayer distance of 2.91 Å, which is even smaller than those in other vdW crystals such as graphite66 and hexagonal boron nitride.67

The projected band structure of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure is shown in Fig. 2(b). This heterostructure is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.60 eV, which is smaller than those of separate MoS2 (2.24 eV) and ZnO (3.29 eV) monolayers. More importantly, it is evident that the MoS2 and ZnO layers are the primary contributors to the CBM and VBM, respectively, indicating the formation of a typical type-II heterostructure. The conduction-band offset (CBO) and valence-band offset (VBO) between the MoS2 and ZnO layers are approximately 2.49 and 0.58 eV, respectively. As we will show, this difference in chemical energy levels is essential to the achievement of a high-efficiency photocatalyst.
There are two prerequisites for a material to be a photocatalyst for the water splitting reaction: its CBM must be higher than the reduction potential (EH+/H2) of water, and the oxidation potential (EO2/H2O) of water must be higher than the VBM of the material. The band edges with respect to the vacuum level of MoS2, ZnO, and the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure are plotted in Fig. 2(c). Since the values of EH+/H2 and EO2/H2O are −4.44 and −5.67 eV, respectively,68 they lie inside the bandgaps of the MoS2 monolayer, ZnO monolayer, and MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure, which means that these materials are energetically ideal for the water splitting reaction. In particular, for the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure, which is a type-II heterostructure, the two redox reactions take place in different layers: the water oxidation occurs in the ZnO layer because it contributes to the VBM, while the water reduction occurs in the MoS2 layer because it contributes to the CBM.
As mentioned in Section 1, the eligibility of MoS2 as a good photocatalyst is compromised by the short lifetimes of the photogenerated electrons that readily recombine with holes. However, this problem is resolved through the formation of a type-II heterostructure with ZnO. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the photogenerated electrons in ZnO tend to move to the CB of the MoS2 layer owing to the large CBO (2.49 eV), while the photogenerated holes in MoS2 tend to migrate to the VB of the ZnO layer, which is driven by the VBO (0.58 eV). Therefore, the band offsets facilitate efficient separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure, as confirmed by the distribution of the partial charge density. As shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f), the VBM and CBM states of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure are localized at the ZnO and MoS2 monolayers, respectively, indicating the complete separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. In fact, the similar physical picture has also been observed in the heterostructure which constructed by hybrid layered ZnO and the MoS2 nanosheets.29

Fig. 3(a) presents the isosurface of charge difference of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure. It is evident that the MoS2 layer acts as an acceptor upon contact with ZnO. According to the Bader charge-population analysis,62–64 we found that the transferred charge is 0.0158|e|, which is considerable and enough to induce a large potential drop across the interface of the heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the potential drop across the MoS2/ZnO interface is 7.38 eV, which induces a significant built-in electric field from the MoS2 layer to the ZnO layer. This built-in electric field can promote carrier shifts, thus further reducing the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.

In order to produce high-efficiency photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices, the active materials must be capable of optical absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions because most of the light arriving at the surface of the earth has wavelengths in these regions.69 Therefore, we explored the optical-absorption ability of the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure by calculating the imaginary part of the dielectric function. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure exhibits light absorption over a wide range in the visible region that considerably overlaps the wavelength range of the incident AM 1.5G solar flux. Moreover, a high absorption peak can be found at approximately 490 nm in the visible region. These results suggest that the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure can potentially be used in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices. It should also be noted that the overlap between the imaginary part of the dielectric function of MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure and the solar radiation spectrum can increase even further by considering the excitonic effects.

4 Conclusions
Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the MoS2/ZnO heterostructure. The interaction at the MoS2/ZnO interface was characterized as a vdW interaction. The MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure exhibits a typical type-II band alignment with an indirect bandgap of 1.60 eV, and its band edge positions satisfy the energy levels required for the water splitting reaction. The formation of a type-II heterostructure promotes the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, a large built-in electric field is formed at the MoS2/ZnO interface, which will further extend the lifetime of photogenerated charges. In addition, we discovered that the wavelength range of optical absorption by the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure considerably overlaps the solar spectrum. All in all, the typical type-II heterostructure, large built-in electric field, and superb optical absorption suggest that the MoS2/ZnO vdW heterostructure has great potential for application in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.
