    , Accepted 31st July 2015First published on 31st July 2015AbstractHybrid CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx have recently been found to be excellent photovoltaic materials showing high power conversion efficiency, small hysteresis and low voltage loss in solar devices. In the synthesis, the reaction between lead bromide (iodide) and methylamine iodide (bromide) usually leads to a CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx film with a rough surface and low coverage, which is thus unable to generate high efficiency in planar heterojunction solar devices. The high efficiency is exclusively achieved in devices with mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network supported hybrid CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx. To improve the efficiency in planar heterojunction device architectures, herein we attempt to fabricate a uniform thin film composed of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx by using NH4Cl as a low-cost additive. The results show that the incorporation of NH4Cl in the reaction system can always improve the film formability regardless of the molar ratio between I and Br in the final compound. We also identified that the device based on CH3NH3PbI2.4Br0.6 can lead to an efficiency of 12.1%, which is the highest value for the planar heterojunction solar cell based on CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx ever reported with a normal device configuration. This work provides a facile method for the fabrication of high quality CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx films for highly efficient solar energy conversion.
Introduction
Methylamine organolead perovskites CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have drawn exceptional attention in solar energy conversion due to their high absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy and long carrier diffusion length.1–3 The intense investigation during the past several years has promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from initially 3.8% to 20.1%.4–7 In addition to the energy conversion efficiency, a significant characteristic of the perovskite is that the management of the halide element in the X position is able to conveniently engineer the band gap, allowing strong light absorption in specific wavelengths.8,9 This feature makes the light absorbing material even more attractive in terms of colourful and semi-transparent devices.
Typically, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite light absorbing materials are utilized in two types of device configurations. One is in a sensitized manner,1,10–12 the perovskite is used just as dye molecules in dye-sensitized solar cells,13–15 where a mesoporous oxide network is applied as a scaffold for supporting the perovskite sensitizer. In this case, the perovskite is usually loaded by the so-called two-step sequential deposition method.1,10,11,16 The other type of device is based on a planar heterojunction, where a hole transporting material (HTM) and an electron transporting material (ETM) are placed on the two sides of the perovskite film, forming a p–i–n type heterostructure.17–19 In this case, the intense light absorption capability and long carrier diffusion length of excitons enable efficient energy conversion. Both types of device structures have their own advantages. However, when it comes to device fabrication, the latter one is substantially simpler and more convenient. In the fabrication of planar heterojunction solar cells, a critical requirement is the formation of a highly uniform and well-crystallized absorber film, in order to increase the lifetime of excitons and fill factor of the devices.
To fabricate the planar perovskite film by solution processing, two classes of reactions have been developed. One is based on the chloride precursor, such as the reaction between PbCl2 and CH3NH3I.20 Due to the slow reaction kinetics, there is enough relaxation time for the formation of a uniform film. With that, the reaction towards CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films for planar heterojunction device architectures has been successfully demonstrated in many investigations.3,20 The other class of reactions is conducted by the reaction between PbX2 and CH3NH3X, where X = Br or I. These reactions are featured as fast reaction kinetics; the solution processing usually leads to poor film quality with low surface coverage. To increase the film quality, Zhao et al. utilized CH3NH3Cl as an additive to tune the kinetics of the reaction between PbI2 and CH3NH3I and the crystallization process, finally generating uniform CH3NH3PbI3 films for planar heterojunction solar cells.21 A similar approach is also applicable to the reaction between PbBr2 and CH3NH3I for the fabrication of planar heterojunction solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI2Br.22 In this case, a PCE of 10% has been achieved. In addition, NH4Cl is also found to improve the film quality of CH3NH3PbI3.23 Inspired by the fabrication of uniform films of polymer absorbing materials, the Jen group utilized an organic additive 1,8-diiodooctane to control the crystallization and engineer the interfacial energy to generate high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films for planar heterojunction device structures and a final efficiency of 10% has been obtained.24
Most recently, it was found that CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx displays excellent photovoltaic properties with improved long-term stability and very small hysteresis between the forward and reverse applied bias.25,26 Equally important, the incorporation of Br into the iodide-based perovskite can tune the band gap for displaying a variety of colours, which is especially attractive in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). However, the reaction towards CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx is difficult to form a uniform film over a large area; thus a mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network has to be adopted as a scaffold for supporting the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx.25,26 Herein, for the first time we demonstrate that NH4Cl can significantly improve the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx film quality, which is formed by the reaction between CH3NH3I, PbI2, CH3NH3Br, and PbBr2. We identify that when x = 0.60 (i.e. CH3NH3PbI2.4Br0.6), the device reaches 12.10% PCE.
Results and discussion
We choose CH3NH3I, PbI2, CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 as reaction precursors for the synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.45, 0.51, 0.60, and 1). The ratio between I and Br in the final perovskite can be easily controlled by tuning the concentration of CH3NH3I + PbI2 and CH3NH3Br + PbBr2, the stoichiometric reaction can avoid excess reactants remaining in the final product. Our investigation starts from the synthesis of perovskite in the absence of any additive. In brief, precursor materials CH3NH3I, PbI2, CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 are first dissolved in DMF solution. After that, the solution mixture was deposited onto the TiO2 compact layer, which was placed on the FTO-coated glass, by spin coating. The film was then heated from room temperature to 100 °C and maintained at this temperature for 15 min. Fig. 1a, c, e, g and i show typical SEM images of the as-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx with x = 0, 0.45, 0.51, 0.60 and 1, respectively. It can be seen that all of them show similar branched structures with a rough surface and low coverage.

All the scale bars represent 5 μm. 
To find out the optimum concentration of NH4Cl for the formation of a uniform perovskite film, different amounts of NH4Cl are introduced into the reaction. The detailed optimization is provided in the ESI† and the final result shows that the NH4Cl concentration at 20 mg ml−1 can deliver a uniform perovskite film (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1b, d, f, h and j show the SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx synthesized in the presence of optimum concentration of NH4Cl, where x = 0, 0.45, 0.51, 0.60 and 1, respectively. Apparently, the uniformity is remarkably improved when compared with the film synthesis in the absence of NH4Cl. In addition, we did not observe any Cl signal in the film according to the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S2†), which indicates that NH4Cl gradually escaped from the film by decomposition or evaporation.
In order to examine the phase purity of the as-synthesized perovskite, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization for each of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. 2 and S3†). When x = 0, the peak centered at 14.19°, 28.48°, 43.08°, 43.22° can be indexed to the (110), (220) (314) and (330) crystal planes of the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. S3†). In CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45, the three peaks of the (110), (220), and (330) crystal planes shift to 14.20°, 28.61° and 43.50° (Fig. 2b–d), respectively. The peak shifting towards larger diffraction angles suggests a decrease of the lattice constant, confirming the formation of an I and Br hybrid perovskite. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks shift to even larger diffraction angles in CH3NH3PbI2.49Br0.51, CH3NH3PbI2.40Br0.60, CH3NH3PbI2Br (Fig. 2b–d). No diffraction peaks arising from NH4Cl were observed in all of the diffraction patterns, in accordance with the EDS result showing no NH4Cl left upon complete reaction. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the films prepared in the presence of NH4Cl additive are much stronger than those of films fabricated without the additive (Fig. S3†), suggesting that NH4Cl favours crystallization and film formation of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx.

(b–d) The diffraction of (100), (202) and (200) evolution with the increase of Br in the perovskite from CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45, CH3NH3PbI2.49Br0.51, CH3NH3PbI2.40Br0.60, CH3NH3PbI2Br. 
To explore the role played by NH4Cl during the formation of the perovskite crystal, we conducted in situ XRD characterization. Upon initial mixing and heating at 45 °C for drying, the diffraction pattern could not be assigned to any pure perovskite material (Fig. 3a). Some of the peaks can be tentatively assigned to PbI2 (13.16°), PbBr2 (14.84°), and NH4Cl (39.10°). The peak centered at 28.5° (Fig. 3b) arises probably from ammonium chloride ammonia ((NH4Cl)(NH3)3) (PDF card NO. 73-1565), which disappeared upon further annealing. Other peaks are presumably attributed to the diffraction of the Pb-based complex such as (CH3NH3)a+bPb(I,Br)2+aClb.27,28 After heating at 60 °C, the peaks at 14.28°, 29.00°, 32.45° and 41.39° appeared and could be indexed to the (110), (202), (220), and (224) crystal planes of the cubic perovskite structure. Further heating to 100 °C, the peak of lead precursors (PbI2 and PbBr2) gradually disappeared and the diffraction of perovskite increased considerably. At this stage, the peak that belongs to NH4Cl also disappears. It is most likely decomposed and then gone away from the reaction system in forms of NH3 and HCl.

Remarkably, the peak at 29.00° gradually shifts to 28.84° during the annealing from 45 °C to 100 °C (Fig. 3b). This is most likely due to the incorporation of Cl into the perovskite forming CH3NH3Pb(I,Br,Cl)3 at the initial stage, while progressive heating leads to Cl loss to form CH3NH3Pb(I,Br)3. At the initial stage, the concentration of Cl is high, it kinetically favours the formation of CH3NH3Pb(I,Br,Cl)3. However, the release of Cl to form CH3NH3Pb(I,Br)3 is a thermodynamically favoured process.29 This phenomenon is similar to the synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx by using PbCl2 and CH3NH3I as reaction precursors where the Cl is gradually released in forms of CH3NH2Cl or HCl upon long time annealing.29
After heating for 14 min at 100 °C, the XRD pattern is quite close to the final product (15–20 min). Our control experiment shows that once we anneal the precursor in a closed system, the reaction towards perovskite becomes much slower. In this case, we suspect that there are gaseous products generated from the reaction system. They are most likely NH3 and HCl as a result of NH4Cl decomposition. In the closed reaction system, the gaseous species are not able to efficiently escape from the reaction system, thereafter impeding the forward reaction according to the Le Chatelier's principle. We also observed that crystallization and film formation in the presence of NH4Cl is considerably slower than that in its absence, indicating that there is more relaxation time for the formation of a more uniform and compact CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx film. On the other hand, the existence of NH4Cl in the reaction system is able to suppress the formation of a large crystal which is believed to bring forth a large volume change.30 This regulation on the crystal growth can also contribute to the formation of uniform perovskite films.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was also conducted to study the effect of NH4Cl addition on the perovskite film preparation. The perovskite synthesized in the absence of NH4Cl displays very weak absorption (Fig. 4a). Obviously, the low surface coverage of the perovskite films as shown in Fig. 1a, c, e, g and i is responsible for the weak light absorption. In this case, the light transmission through the substrate should be significant. The films fabricated in the presence of NH4Cl additive show remarkably increased absorption features (Fig. 4a and S4†). It is also observed that the onset absorption band of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx decreases from around 800 nm to a shorter wavelength as the Br ratio increased (x = 0, 0.45, 0.51, 0.60, 1, 2, 3). This means that the colours of the films are tunable from black to yellow (Fig. 4b). In addition, the films prepared using the NH4Cl additive looked more uniform and darker than those synthesized in the absence of the additive. The band gaps of films with each x value were calculated from the spectrum, denoted as Eg(x) (Fig. S5†). With that, we obtain that Eg(0) = 1.50 eV, Eg(0.45) = 1.67 eV, Eg(0.51) = 1.68 eV, Eg(0.60) = 1.70 eV, and Eg(1) = 1.75 eV. The band gap values show a slight difference when compared with the literature reports, presumably due to the different fabrication method.25,31

The photovoltaic performance of the as-synthesized perovskite is examined by using the device configuration illustrated in Fig. 5a, where TiO2, Spiro-OMeTAD and Ag film are used as the ETM, HTM and metal contact. Optimization shows that the perovskite with a thickness of 400 nm (Fig. 5a and S10†) delivers the best performance. Fig. 5b shows current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the devices based on perovskites with x = 0, 0.6 and 1, others with x = 0.45 and 0.51 are provided in Fig. S6.† The photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), of the devices based on CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45, CH3NH3PbI2.49Br0.51, CH3NH3PbI2.40Br0.60, CH3NH3PbI2Br are summarized in Table 1 and a comparison is provided in Fig. 5c. Devices based on the film prepared with NH4Cl addition show higher efficiency, regardless of the ratio between I and Br in the perovskites (Fig. 5c). In particular, when x is 0, the efficiency increased from 7.72% to 9.85%. When x increased to 0.45, the PCE increased by 46% from 5.59% to 8.16%. Furthermore, when x equals 0.51, the PCE increased from 6.50% to 11.79%, showing a relative improvement of 81%. When x increased to 0.60 and 1, the efficiencies are increased by 89% and 54%, respectively. The most significant improvement is observed when x equals 0.51 and 0.60; this is in accordance with the SEM result, where CH3NH3PbI2.49Br0.51 and CH3NH3PbI2.40Br0.60 films synthesized with NH4Cl addition have a more uniform morphology than others. Remarkably, when x = 0.60, a PCE as high as 12.10% was achieved, this is so far the highest value in planar heterojunction solar cells using CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx as light absorbing materials with a normal device structure.22,32 This is comparable with the inverted device structure, showing 13.1% PCE.33 It should be noted that the addition of NH4Cl increases the hysteresis a little as shown in Fig. S7.† This should be associated with the grain size changes in the different perovskite films. In the XRD patterns (Fig. S3†), the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx synthesized using NH4Cl is larger than the FWHM of those synthesized without NH4Cl. The larger FWHM shows that the crystals size was smaller and grain boundary increased. The increased grain boundary usually leads to increased hysteresis as a result of carrier accumulation at the boundaries.34

A parallel comparison shows that device performance improvement upon film fabrication in the presence of the additive is mainly due to the improved Jsc and FF. Obviously, the increased Jsc is owing to the enhanced surface coverage of the light absorbing films, leading to improved light harvesting efficiency. The uniform film with fewer defects would enhance the carrier transport and thus improve the FF. Among improved devices with different x values, Voc increased with increasing x due to the change of the band position of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx. With more Br substituting I, the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx increases, while its valance band decreases.8,31
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of each device is shown in Fig. 6. First, we analyse the IPCE spectra of the device based on the film fabricated with NH4Cl addition (Fig. 6a). In the CH3NH3PbI3 based device, the IPCE spectrum displays an onset at ∼800 nm, which corresponds to the CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells.1,17 The onset wavelength of the IPCE spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45 based device shows a blue shift due to the enlarged band gap, consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI2.55Br0.45 film. As expected, the onset IPCE progressively shifts to shorter wavelengths with the increase of x. The IPCE action spectra of the device with perovskite films fabricated in the absence of NH4Cl share the same trend, i.e. with the increase of x, the onset wavelength shifts to a shorter wavelength. From Fig. 4a, it is obtained that the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite film in the absence of the NH4Cl addition is considerably weaker than those of films fabricated in the presence of NH4Cl. However, the IPCE difference is not that large. This is due to the fact that the IPCE measurement is based on the completed device; the Ag film would reflect light back for perovskite absorption and thus for photocurrent generation. On the other hand, the measurement of UV-vis absorption is based on the perovskite film, without an additional reflection layer; light transmittance becomes more pronounced owing to the low surface coverage of the as-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx nanostructures.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time we have demonstrated that NH4Cl can improve the quality of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx films for highly efficient planar heterojunction solar cells. NH4Cl is found to be able to slow down the crystallization and film formation processes, providing more relaxation time for generating high quality films. We also discovered that, for the planar heterojunction solar cells, the ratio between I and Br equals to 4 in the hybrid perovskite, i.e. CH3NH3PbI2.4Br0.6, can deliver the highest efficiency up to 12.10%. This ratio is slightly different from the mesoporous TiO2 supported CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx where x in the range of 0.3 to 0.45 generates the highest efficiency.26 The current investigation provides a convenient approach for the fabrication of high-efficiency planar heterojunction solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals were used as received without further purification, including HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich), CH3NH2 (33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), PbI2 (Sigma), PbBr2 (Sigma), dimethylformamide (DMF), titanium isopropylate (Sigma), IPA, hydrochloric acid (HCl), Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma), chlorobenzene, spiro-OMeTAD (Sigma), 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ethanol, acetone and silver (Ag). FTO glass is purchased from Dyesol Company.
Precursor preparation
The TiO2 compact layer precursor was composed of 5 ml IPA, 5 μl HCl and 350 μl titanium isopropylate.
Methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized according to the literature. CH3NH3I powder and PbI2 were dissolved in DMF at a 1:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 40 wt%, which we called CH3NH3PbI3 solution. CH3NH3Br powder and PbBr2 were dissolved in DMF at a 1:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 28.5 wt%, which we called CH3NH3PbBr3 solution. Then, the precursors were stirred and heated at 60 °C for 12 h. The desired CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx solutions were made by stoichiometric mixing of CH3NH3PbI3 and MAPbBr3 solutions at 60 °C for 1 h. After cooling down, NH4Cl was added to each solution with the concentration of 20 mg ml−1 and stirred for 15 h at room temperature.
The hole transport layer (HTL) solution was composed of 80 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml chlorobenzene, with the addition of 48.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 29.8 μl lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI)solutions (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile).
Solar cell fabrication and measurement
FTO glass was cleaned sequentially in an ultrasonic solvent bath with acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water for 20 minutes. After drying with compressed air, FTO glass was treated with O2 plasma (JEM25GY 001, Plasmatic Systems, Inc.) for 1.5 minutes. Then, a thin layer of the TiO2 compact layer was spin-coated on FTO at 5000 rpm speed for 60 s and baked in air. The baking temperature increased from 150 °C to 500 °C gradually with 50 °C min−1, and was kept at 500 °C for 50 minutes. After cooling down, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glovebox. The specific CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx solution was coated on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Subsequently, the substrate was heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, HTL solution was spin-coated on the substrate FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx. The fabricated FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx/HTL was then transferred into a dry box with 20% humidity to be oxidized for 16 h. Finally, silver was deposited on the HTL by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask under a pressure of 10−4 Pa. The active area was 0.12 cm2 for each cell.
Characterization
The morphology of different counter electrodes was characterized on a scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 400 FEG microscope). The UV-vis spectrum was collected on a UV-VIS Spectrometer (Hitachi U-3501). Crystallization of perovskite was characterized by using a X-ray Diffractometer (Rigaku Smartlab). The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured by using a semiconductor characterization system at room temperature in a nitrogen filled glovebox under the spectral output from a solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5 G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. The IPCE was tested with a Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) in air.
