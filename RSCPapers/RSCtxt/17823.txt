Introduction
The overgrowth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is considered to be a major contributor to climate change, namely, global warming.1 There are several approaches for CO2 conversion, including thermochemical reduction, photocatalytic reduction of CO2, electrochemical reduction etc.2 The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (ERC) to produce carbon neutral fuels or industrial chemicals, which are conventionally derived from petroleum, is one of the efficient pathways for CO2 emissions reduction. ERC can also cause energy from intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and wind power, to be stored in the chemicals, by using the electricity generated from these green energy devices.3 Therefore, the ERC technology appears to be promising for CO2 reduction and the replacement of fossil fuels, enabling a pathway for sustainable chemicals.4 However, ERC technology is generally limited by the poor activity of the catalysts due to a large overpotential and low selectivity as a variety of products (such as CO, HCOOH, hydrocarbons, methanol etc.) together with hydrogen will be produced simultaneously.5
One of the useful products from ERC is formic acid/formate. Formic acid can serve as a precursor for producing chemicals, a hydrogen storage material, a reducing agent for materials synthesis, and a reactant in formic acid fuel cells.6 The ideal catalysts for ERC need to show a high energy conversion efficiency (i.e., high faradaic efficiency at a low overpotential), high stability as well as high activity (i.e., high rate or turnover number).7 So far, a number of catalysts (Pb, Hg, In, Cd, Pd catalysts etc.) have been reported to be state-of the art catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to formate (HCOO−).8–12 However, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals and the toxicity of the heavy metals are hindrances towards their large-scale practical application. Therefore, a series of environmentally friendly, low-cost, non-noble metal-based materials, such as Sn,13–15 Cu,16 and metal oxides,10,17 have been investigated as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to HCOO−. Nevertheless, the reported HCOO− faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for these low-cost materials vary over a wide range, from 40% to 93%, and their partial current densities for HCOO− production (jHCOO−) are usually lower than 10 mA cm−2 in aqueous electrolytes.9,18 Furthermore, their low stability still remains a challenging issue for final application in ERC. For example, rapid performance degradations were observed with Sn-based electrodes after 30 min or several hours.12,18,19 Thus, considering the cost and environmental ramifications, the development of electrocatalysts with high selectivity, high activity and high stability is significantly required.
Bismuth, a non-toxic and low-cost byproduct of Pb, Cu, and Sn refining, has been regarded as a promising catalyst for ERC. A bismuth–carbon monoxide evolving catalyst (Bi–CMEC) has been proven to be active for CO2 reduction to CO in a CO2-saturated solution of MeCN containing 1,3-dialkyl-substituted imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs).20,21 Liu et al.22 fabricated a Bi/BiOCl nanocomposite with dominant (001) facets using a UV light-induced chemical reduction route and the material showed high catalytic activity as a photocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants under mild conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, few efforts have been devoted to developing Bi catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction to HCOO− with high selectivity, high activity as well as high stability in aqueous solution.
It has been proven that nanostructured materials usually provide much more surface active sites than bulk materials because of their enhanced surface area.16,23,24 The catalytic activity of nanostructured catalysts is usually proportional to the number of edge/low-coordinated sites.23,25 Theoretical and experimental modelling studies suggested that the edge sites on Au nanoparticle (NP) surfaces favor the ERC and the corner sites facilitate a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).24,25 It has also been proven that metals with a low-dimensional structure had higher edge site ratios, which facilitate the ERC.16,24,26 Thus, the development of nanostructured Bi catalysts is speculated to achieve a high catalytic activity of the Bi catalysts.
Herein, nanostructured bismuth dendrites were designed and directly grown on treated carbon paper (TCP) using a simple electrochemical deposition method, as shown in Scheme 1. The preparation and analytical procedures are described in the Experimental section. The synthesis process is very simple and there was no need for any templates such as PVP, CTAB and so on. Specifically, no additional processes were needed to remove templates. The designed catalyst combines highly active sites and abundant edge sites with a stable nanostructure. In this design, improved activity is assured by the high surface area due to the nanodendrite branches. High selectivity is assured by the dendrite nanostructures having abundant edge sites. The carbon paper can support the catalyst, improve the CO2 concentration and enlarge the three-phase interface, achieving a high activity of the catalyst. The low-dimensional nanostructure of the catalyst can also improve the stability of the catalyst.23 To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a low-cost Bi dendrite catalyst combining high activity, selectivity as well as excellent stability was developed for the selective reduction of CO2 to formate. The Bi dendrites exhibit the best performance with highest maximum faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.4% at a high current density of 15.2 mA cm−2 for formate among all the low-cost non-heavy metal based catalysts ever reported.10,12,27 More importantly, the obtained bismuth nanodendrite catalyst shows no obvious deterioration over 10 h, indicating its high stability. Thus, the prepared nanostructured Bi catalyst in this paper is expected to provide more options for ERC catalyst development.

Experimental section
Materials
Potassium bromide (KBr) (>99.9999%) was from Sigma Aldrich. Carbon dioxide (99.9995%) was purchased from the Dalian DATE gas company. Carbon paper (Toray 060) was purchased from Toray Company, Japan. The electrolyte solutions were prepared with ultra-pure water (18.2 MΩ). Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) were purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification.
Bi catalyst synthesis
The Bi-based catalysts were synthesized through electrochemical deposition (as shown in Scheme 1). The carbon paper was treated in a tube oven at 550 °C for about 6 h under a flowing air atmosphere at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 to improve the hydrophilic properties and remove organic impurities. The treated carbon paper was rinsed with ultrapure water and acetone. The carbon paper (T060, Toray) was applied as the working electrode. The counter electrode and the reference electrode were a Pt sheet and an Hg2Cl2/Hg/saturated KCl electrode (0.242 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), respectively. The electrolyte was prepared according to a reference, containing 0.02 mol L−1 bismuth(III) nitrate, 1.2 mol L−1 hydrochloric acid and 0.25 mol L−1 KBr.20 The deposition was carried out via a chronoamperometry technique by applying a constant potential (−0.35 V versus SCE) for different amounts of time. The Bi–TCP was sequentially rinsed with ultra-pure water and ethanol prior to being dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
Physical characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis: Dandong Haoyuan Instrument Co., LTD apparatus was applied to carry out the XRD characterization of the catalysts. The measurements were conducted at 40 kV and 30 mA using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The 2θ values of the X-ray diffractograms were from 5° to 100°.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the catalysts were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (FEI, QUANTA200 FEG).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using a JEOL JEM-2000EX (120 kV) microscope. Before the measurements, the samples were uniformly dispersed in ethanol and then cast onto a Cu grid.
A thermo VG ESCALAB250 spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV, 300 W) was adopted to collect the XPS spectra.
To investigate the capping effect of Br−, UV-vis absorption spectra were collected with a UV-vis spectrometer (JASCO, FT-IR 4100, Japan).
Electrochemical measurements
To evaluate the performance of the electrode, electrochemical measurements of the catalysts were conducted with a 2273 potentiostat (EG&G Instrument) through a three-electrode system. The counter electrode was a Pt sheet and the reference electrode was a Hg2Cl2/Hg/saturated KCl electrode (0.242 V vs. SHE), respectively. The working electrode was the as-prepared Bi/TCP electrode.
The electrochemical measurements were conducted in a gas-tight two-compartment electrochemical cell with a piece of proton exchange membrane Nafion 115 (Dupont, USA) as a separator. 180 mL of 0.5 M NaHCO3 saturated with CO2 was adopted as the electrolyte. The anode electrolyte was 100 mL of a 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. During the CO2 reduction experiments, the stir rate for the cathodic electrolyte was 500 rpm.
Product detection
During the electrochemical measurements, CO2 gas was purged into the 0.5 M NaHCO3 at the cathode. The flow rate of the CO2 was 60 mL min−1. The off-gas of the cathode was vented directly into a gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU Instruments). The GC analysis was set up to split the gas sample into two aliquots, whereof one aliquot was put through a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for quantification of the H2 and CO concentration. Argon (Corp Brother, 99.9999%) was employed as a carrier. The second aliquot was routed through a flame ionization detector (FID) for analysis of all the major C1 to C3 hydrocarbons. A GC run was initiated every 18 minutes.
The liquid products were collected and identified using an ion chromatography (IC) system from Thermo Scientific.
Stability tests
The stability was evaluated at −1.8 V for 10 h and 50 h, respectively. During the test, current–time curves were recorded. Before and after the test, the HCOO− concentrations were measured respectively.
Results and discussion
The crystalline structures of the as-prepared Bi electrocatalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the Bi catalysts prepared with KBr (Bi-B) and without KBr (Bi-A). The peaks at ca. 22.5°, 27.2°, 38.0°, 39.6°, 48.7°, 62.2° and 64.5° can be indexed to the (003), (012), (104), (110), (024), (116) and (112) planes of rhombohedral Bi [PDF#97-024-6663]. The peaks at 26.5° correspond to the (111) planes of Bi2O3 [PDF#41-1449]. Although the two catalysts show similar crystalline structures, they are found to possess substantially different dimensions. The intensity of the diffraction peaks of Bi-A is much stronger, indicating a large particle size.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to elucidate the surface chemical compositions of the catalysts. Fig. S1† shows XPS survey spectra for the Bi catalysts over a wide range of binding energies from 0 eV to 1100 eV. Four predominant peaks at about 159.0, 284.6, 450, and 530 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f, C 1s, Bi 4d, and O 1s, can be observed, respectively. Fig. 1b presents the high resolution XPS spectra of Bi 4f for the different catalysts. The Bi 4f7/2 signals at 157.1 eV and 159.5 eV are ascribed to Bi0 and Bi3+, respectively (Fig. 1b). The results are consistent with the XRD. This indicates that the as-prepared catalysts contain both Bi3+ and Bi0, consistent with the literature references.21 The Bi0/Bi3+ ratio of Bi-B is obviously larger than that of Bi-A.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of the catalysts. Fig. 2 shows SEM images at different magnifications of the as-prepared Bi-B and Bi-A catalysts. The morphologies of the two catalysts are significantly different to that of the treated carbon paper (TCP) substrate (shown in Fig. S2a†), indicating successful deposition of the Bi-based catalysts on the surface of the TCP. The SEM image of Bi-A reveals a flower-like structure, while Bi-B presents a nanodendritic structure (shown in Fig. 2a and b). From the magnified SEM image of Bi-B in Fig. 2d, it can be observed that the Bi-B nanodendrites consist of nanobranches. Typical diameters of the dendrite branches are in the range of 700–900 nm. Comparatively, as shown in the SEM images of Bi-A (Fig. 2c), the Bi-A catalyst with a flower-like structure is composed of irregular pellets and the particles are obviously larger than in Bi-B.

In order to gain additional insight into the microstructure of the Bi dendrites, TEM images were collected. As shown in Fig. S2b,† the TEM image further proves that the catalyst has nanodendrite structures. After intense ultrasonication, the nanodendrites are separated into nanowires with 20–70 nm diameters with some particles on the surface, indicating that the nanodendrites are mainly composed of nanowires (Fig. 3a). Small nanoparticles of about 10–40 nm can also be observed in the nanowires. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained for the Bi-B catalysts (Fig. 3b). Besides bright spots corresponding to the crystal planes of rhombohedral Bi, the SAED pattern of Bi-B shows rings, which can be also assigned to the reflections of Bi2O3. These observations agree with the XPS and XRD results presented above.

The shape-evolution process of the Bi dendrites can be explained by a diffusion-controlled and oriented attachment process.28 Apparently, KBr plays a key role in controlling the structures of the dendritic Bi catalysts. The Br− acts as a capping agent and can form a complex with the Bi3+ (forming BiBrx), which can consequently increase the absorption speed and absorption amount of metal ions on the carbon paper.29,30 It also accelerates the reduction speed of the metal ions or promotes the flow of electrons. Thus, Bi with a smaller particle size can be formed with a higher deposition speed.31 To prove the capping effect of Br−, UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained. As shown in Fig. 4, compared with the Bi3+ containing solutions and the Br− containing solution, it can be observed that new peaks at about 365 nm and 375 nm appear for deposition solutions containing both Bi3+ and different concentrations of Br−. This indicates the formation of a new species, which should be the Bi3+ and Br− complex.

To further clarify the Bi-B nanodendrite formation process, SEM images of Bi-B catalysts synthesized with different amounts of KBr and different growth durations were obtained. As shown in Fig. S3a and b,† with the addition of a small amount of KBr during the electrochemical deposition process, Bi nanoparticles with a spherical morphology can be obtained, which is significantly different to the structure of Bi-A composed of irregular pellets. With increase of the KBr amount, Bi branches appear on the surface of the nanoparticles (as shown in Fig. S4b–d†). As shown in Fig. S4e and f,† when the KBr amount was increased to 0.2 M, dendrites with several short branches were formed. This demonstrates that the Br− can act as a capping agent, which can facilitate the formation of small sized spherical nanoparticles.29 Due to selective adsorption of the excess Br−, an orientated growth of Bi occurs, which leads to the formation of larger sized branches and nanodendrites with further increase of the KBr concentration.
To further investigate the growth mechanism of Bi-B, the morphologies of Bi-B samples synthesized using different deposition times were investigated (shown in Fig. S4†). At the initial stage of the deposition, Bi with a nanorod structure can be formed (Fig. S4a and b†). As shown in Fig. S4c and d,† with increase of the deposition time, the formation of simple dendrite structures with several branches can be observed (as the basic unit). Subsequently, many branches on the Bi dendrites appear. As the deposition continues, the Bi evolves into dendrites with many small sub-branches (as shown in Fig. S4e–k†). This process is similar to the Pt dendrite growth reported in the literature references.32
Thus, the formation of the nanodendrites is speculated to occur as follows: at the initial reaction stage, the Bi3+ ion concentration is high and nanoparticles are preferably formed with the selective adsorption of a small amount of Br−. With increase of the KBr concentration, the excess Br− ions selectively adsorb on the surface of the Bi nanoparticles. With increase of the reaction time and decrease of the Bi3+ ion concentration, an oriented aggregation of the diffusing and migrating Bi nanoparticles to form Bi nanowires and nanodendrites is generated subsequently.11,30 From our results, it can be speculated the Br− acts as a capping agent and structure inducing agent in our synthesis pathway.
To correlate the catalytic properties with the surface structures, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) at different scanning rates were collected for the Bi nanodendrites in 0.5 M NaHCO3 (as shown in Fig. 5a and b). The electrochemical surface areas (ESAs) of the Bi catalysts were determined by measuring the double layer capacitance.16Fig. 5 shows the double layer capacitance of the (c) Bi-A and (d) Bi-B catalysts. The capacitance is 1.93 mF cm−2 for Bi-B, which is 10 times larger than that of Bi-A (0.184 mF cm−2). This suggests that the surface roughness of Bi-B is apparently larger than of Bi-A, which should result in a higher ESA.
 Fig. 5  CV curves of the Bi-A (a) and Bi-B (b) catalysts, obtained within a potential range where double-layer charging and discharging are relevant using N2 saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3. The double layer capacitance of the (c) Bi-A and (d) Bi-B catalysts was determined using measurements for the potential region where double-layer charging and discharging are relevant. This analysis shows that Bi-B has the higher capacitance value, about 10 times that of Bi-A. This indicates that Bi-B has a higher roughness factor than Bi-A. 
Current–potential characteristics of the Bi-A and Bi-B catalyst based electrodes in CO2 or N2 saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 were explored using linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in order to evaluate their electrocatalytic activities for the ERC. Fig. 6 displays the LSV curves of the Bi-A and Bi-B catalysts. The overpotential for the ERC on Bi-B is 0.64 V at 1 mA cm−2. Comparatively, under the same conditions, the overpotential for Bi-A is 0.72 V. The total current densities (jtot) of Bi-A and Bi-B at −1.8 V are 15.5 mA cm−2 and 18.5 mA cm−2 in CO2 saturated electrolyte, which are obviously larger than those with the N2 atmosphere saturated electrolytes. The higher current density of Bi-B should be attributed to its higher ESA. Moreover, the difference for Bi-B between the LSV curves using N2- and CO2-saturated electrolytes is obviously larger than that for Bi-A. This indicates a lower overpotential and quicker reduction rates for ERC on the surface of the Bi-B catalyst.

To evaluate the catalytic activities of the Bi catalysts, a chronopotentiometry technique was applied to conduct the CO2 reduction at various potentials. Formate (HCOO−) and hydrogen (H2) were detected as the main products using ion chromatography (IC) and gas chromatography (GC). No CH4 or C2H4 can be observed in our ERC products. Very low-concentration CO can also be detected in this article. Fig. 7a displays the total current density (jtot) at different potentials using CO2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3. The jtot for Bi-A is lower than that of Bi-B for the same potential range and electrochemical conditions. According to the results of XRD, SEM and ESA, the larger geometric current density of Bi-B compared to Bi-A during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 should arise from its smaller particle size and the resultant higher surface area.17 These results suggest quicker reduction reaction rates using Bi-B, including for ERC and H2 evolution, which is further proven by the impedance analysis of the different catalysts.

(b) FEs for the HCOO− production using Bi-A and Bi-B at various potentials in 0.5 M NaHCO3, pH 7.2. (c) jHCOO−vs. potential for Bi-A (d) jHCOO−vs. potential for Bi-B. 
Fig. S5† shows the Nyquist plots of the two catalyst based electrodes at −1.8 V vs. SCE. It was found from the spectra that the semicircle is mainly made of one capacitive loop, which is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The intersection of the Nyquist plots with the real axis is referred to as R1, which represents the internal resistance of the electrode including the uncompensated contact resistance and the ohmic resistance of the electrode.33 Obviously, the R1 of Bi-B/TCP is similar to that of Bi-A/TCP, suggesting a similar internal resistance. The Rct of the Bi-B/TCP electrode is lower than that of the Bi-A/TCP electrode. Because the hydrogen evolution reaction can be neglected at −1.8 V, the smaller Rct suggests a lower charge (electron and protons) transfer resistance, indicating higher CO2 reduction rates for Bi-B.
The variation in the partial current density associated with HCOO− generation for the Bi-based electrodes was investigated as a function of the applied potential. Fig. S6† illustrates the dependence of the partial current density for HCOO− production (jHCOO−) on the applied electrolysis potential. The jHCOO− increases as the potential becomes more negative. Moreover, the jHCOO− of Bi-B is 15.2 mA cm−2 at −1.8 V, which is significantly larger than that of Bi-A.
The effects of the applied potential on the faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for Bi-A and Bi-B are displayed in Fig. 7b. With increase of the potential, the FEs of the two electrodes increase. A maximum FE for HCOO− production of 96.4% can be achieved for Bi-B at a potential of −1.8 V, suggesting that almost all of the energy (electrons) of the system is used for ERC. Comparatively, the faradaic efficiency of Bi-A is about 84.7%, similar to the values for the Bi based electrodes reported in previous publications.34 The dramatic difference in the FE between the two catalysts suggests that the Bi-B surfaces enable formation of the CO2˙− intermediate while suppressing H2 evolution. From Fig. S7,† the TCP itself shows very low FEs < 4%, further demonstrating that the high FE of Bi-B/TCP arises from the Bi nanodendrites. As shown in Table S1,† compared to recently reported non-heavy metal based catalysts, the Bi-B catalyst in this article displays the highest faradaic efficiency. Moreover, the jHCOO− is higher than for most of the reported low-cost non-heavy metal catalysts in aqueous solution. This proves the possibility of its potential application in CO2 reduction reactions.
According to the SEM and TEM results, the Bi-B catalyst presents a structure of dendrite nanostructures composed of nanowires. The nanowire branches can achieve a high surface area and high number of active sites, which can contribute to the higher current density of Bi-B.24 It has been proven that low-dimensional nanostructure catalysts usually contain a large portion of edge/low-coordinated sites, which can facilitate the ERC.10,23 Moreover, it has been also proven that compared to tetrahedral nanocrystals, branched nanostructures including nanodendrites, which contain more edges as well as high-index facets on the arms, can lower the activation energy of the reaction and achieve a good performance in many reactions.34–37 Thus, in this paper, the high selectivity of Bi-B is speculated to originate from its unique structure. The nanodendrite structures and nanowires of the Bi nanodendrite branches are speculated to present more edge sites/low coordinate sites, which can facilitate the ERC. Moreover, the unique structure of the Bi-B catalyst leads to an appropriate adsorption strength of the intermediates or CO2 on the Bi catalyst surface during the CO2 reduction, which can contribute to its lower potential and high FEs.15,37,38 Thus the low-coordinated sites on the Bi-B catalysts are believed to promote the production of HCOO−, whereas hydrogen evolution is suppressed. The origin of hydrogen evolution suppression with the nanostructured Bi dendrites can probably also be attributed to the higher density of edge sites compared to bulk Bi flowers. According to the XPS and TEM results, the catalysts also contain Bi2O3. However, the content of Bi2O3 in Bi-A is slightly higher than that in Bi-B, which results in a lower activity and selectivity. This suggests that Bi2O3 has no significant impact on the catalytic activity for the Bi based catalysts in this paper, which should be completely reduced during the ERC.
To obtain insight into the mechanistic pathway(s) for the CO2 reduction with the Bi-electrode, Tafel plots derived from Fig. S6† are shown in Fig. 7c and d. The Tafel plots are linear at a low current density and the slope values of Bi-A and Bi-B are 188.1 mV per decade for Bi-A and 166.5 mV per decade for Bi-B, consistent with ref. 38 and 39. These values suggest that an initial electron transfer to form an adsorbed CO2˙− intermediate is the rate-determining step for the CO2 reduction.15,18 The similar slope values mean that the ERC reactions on the two catalysts follow similar mechanisms. The upward Tafel slope curvature at high current densities likely reflects mass transport limitations in this regime caused by a low CO2 concentration in the aqueous solutions.38 Furthermore, the overpotential required for the ERC is typically smaller with Bi-B electrodes, suggesting their improved catalytic activity.
The stability of the catalyst is also a major concern for ERC. In order to evaluate the stability of Bi-B, a stability test of the Bi-B based electrode was conducted using chronoamperometry (CA) at −1.8 V for 10 h and 50 h, respectively. The products were collected and analyzed before and after the stability test, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8a, a rapid decline of the electrolysis current was observed in the initial electrolysis stage at −1.8 V, which is attributed to the suppression of hydrogen evolution during the oxide reduction process.39 After this rapid decrease, the current density is almost unchanged. As shown in Fig. 8, the FE for HCOO− production showed negligible change during 10 h of continuous electrolysis, demonstrating an excellent stability in aqueous solutions. It has been reported that the formation of intermetallic compounds and loss of powdered catalysts, which occurred during CO2 reduction, are the prime causes for performance deactivation.40,41 It has also been proven that Cu nanofibers show a higher stability than nanoparticles during the ERC.16 As shown in Fig. S10a,† it can be observed that the morphology of Bi-B slightly changed, but that the nanodendrite structure still remained. Thus, the high stability of the Bi-B electrode should be ascribed to the high stability of the dendrite structure, preventing changes in the low-coordinated surface sites and the formation of intermetallic compounds.

For 50 h of electrolysis, the total current density for Bi-B at −1.8 V was also almost unchanged after the initial current decline (Fig. S8†). However, as shown in Fig. S9,† the FE of the Bi-B catalyst declined and remained over 70%. As shown in Table S1,† this value is still higher than for many of the reported catalysts, further proving the great advantages of the Bi-based catalysts.14,16,39 From Fig. S10b,† it can be observed that the morphology of Bi-B obviously changed. The dendrite structure was broken and particles with a ball-like structure were formed. The degradation of the catalytic activity of Bi-B for the ERC should be attributed to the structural changes and the increase of the FE for the HER. It has been proven that low-dimensional structure catalysts show higher edge site ratios than nanoparticles.24,25,38 The high ratio of Bi-B nanoparticles after 50 h of continuous electrolysis caused the decrease in the selectivity toward HCOO− production. This further proves that a higher amount of edge sites can promote the ERC reaction and a higher amount of corner sites can boost the H2 revolution reaction.
Conclusion
In summary, bismuth catalysts with a dendrite structure were designed and successfully grown on carbon paper for application in the ERC using an electrochemical deposition method. The as-prepared Bi-B catalyst presents a dendritic nanostructure with a higher electrochemical surface area than that of Bi-A. The addition of KBr into the electrolyte during the electrochemical deposition process alters the morphology, particle size and chemical state of the Bi catalysts, thus leading to great improvement of the ERC performance, including the catalytic activity and selectivity for HCOO−. A maximum faradaic efficiency of 96.4% and a partial current density of 15.2 mA cm−2 were achieved at −1.8 V for the Bi-B catalyst, which are almost the highest values for CO2 efficiently reduced to HCOO− obtained using non-heavy metal catalysts. Moreover, Bi-B displays an overpotential that is 80 mV lower than that of Bi-A at a total current density of 1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the catalyst is stable during 10 h of continuous electrolysis. These results suggest that the bismuth nanodendrite catalyst grown on carbon paper holds great promise as a high performance catalyst for ERC applications. In addition, this synthetic method may be useful for synthesizing electrocatalysts in other fields.
