    , Accepted 27th May 2023First published on 29th May 2023AbstractThe integration of halide perovskites with other functional materials provides a new platform for applications beyond photovoltaics, which has been realized in experiments. Here, through first-principles methods, we explore the possibility of constructing halide perovskite/antiperovskite oxide van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) for the first time with monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 as representative compounds. Our calculation results reveal that the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWHs have negative binding energies and their most stable stacking possesses a rare type-III band alignment with a broken gap, which is highly promising for tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) applications. Moreover, their electronic features can be further tuned by applying strain or an external electric field. Specifically, compressive strain can enlarge the tunneling window, while tensile strain can realize a type-III to type-II band alignment transformation. Therefore, our work provides fundamental insights into the electronic properties of Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWHs and paves the way for the design and fabrication of future halide perovskite/antiperovskite-based TFETs.
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, halide perovskites with the formula ABX3 (A = monovalent cation; B = divalent metal cation; X = halogen anion) have achieved great success in the fields of solar cells,1–3 light-emitting diodes,4 and X-ray/radiation detectors,5 due to their simple solution-processing, high structural and compositional tunability, and superior optoelectronic properties. For example, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells exceeds 25%.2 Despite the remarkable progress made in halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices, challenges remain in further improving their performance and addressing stability issues for future commercialization.6–8
Many strategies have been reported in the literature to improve the stability of halide perovskites, but often at the expense of some of their optoelectronic properties.9–12 For instance, moisture-stable Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase halide perovskites can be formed by introducing hydrophobic organic molecules at the A-site, but the reduced dimensionality gives rise to large band gaps and increased exciton binding energies.12 A particularly useful way of achieving higher performance and better stability of perovskite semiconductors is to integrate them with other functional materials,3,9,13–15 which benefits from their inherently soft lattice allowing greater tolerance to lattice mismatch. In experiments, Li et al. constructed a stable PbS/halide perovskite heterojunction through surface sulfidation, resulting in a PCE of over 24% for inverted perovskite solar cells.3 Additionally, the construction of halide perovskite/perovskite (i.e., 3D/3D, 3D/2D, and 3D/1D)13,14,16–18 and halide perovskite/2D material heterostructures is also a widely adopted strategy in experimental studies to achieve unprecedented improvements in both performance and stability. Despite the significant advances, it is very challenging to obtain high quality and large yields of halide perovskite heterostructures, due to the high anion diffusivity or the relatively poor contact and uncontrollable orientation at the heterointerface.9,15 In order to improve interfacial contact and avoid high anion diffusivity, a possible strategy could be the integration of halide perovskites with other materials having the same perovskite-type structure but a completely different composition.18
Antiperovskite X3BA (X is a cation, A and B are different-sized anions) has the same perovskite-type crystal structure as the conventional perovskite ABX3, but with the positions of the anions and cations interchanged at the lattice sites.19–21 For example, the B-site anions are located in the center of sixfold coordinated octahedra [BX6] and the A-site anions are 12-fold coordinated with the X cations. Recently, we have predicted a promising antiperovskite alloy Mg3NAs0.5Bi0.5 and five novel quaternary antiperovskites (Ca6N2AsSb, Ca6N2PSb, Sr6N2AsSb, Sr6N2PSb, and Ca6NPSb2) with excellent electronic and optical properties, which show great potential in the field of photovoltaics.22,23 In addition to antiperovskite nitrides, antiperovskite oxides (i.e., anti-Ruddlesden–Popper phases X4OA2 (X2+ = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Eu2+; A3− = P3−, As3−, Sb3−, Bi3−) have also been reported to exhibit attractive ferroelectric/antiferroelectric, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic properties.24–28 Although both antiperovskite semiconductors and halide perovskites have shown attractive optoelectronic properties, there are no relevant reports exploring the possibility of integrating antiperovskites and halide perovskites together to form promising heterojunctions.
To explore the possibility of constructing vertical heterojunctions between halide perovskites and antiperovskite semiconductors, we choose RP phase layered halide perovskites A2BX4 (A+ = Cs+, Rb+; B2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+) and anti-RP phase antiperovskite oxides X4OA2 (X2+ = Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+; A3− = P3−, As3−, Sb3−, Bi3−) as the basic building blocks. This is because their natural layering structure facilitates the construction of heterojunction models. Here, we have taken the RP phase layered halide perovskite Rb2CdCl4 and the anti-RP phase antiperovskite oxide Ba4OSb2 as an example to construct a 2D van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) based on their band edge position and lattice mismatch. We first investigated the ground-state configuration of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH by first-principles calculations. The electronic structure calculations reveal that the most energy-favorable stacking of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH possesses the type-III band alignment with a broken gap. Moreover, its electronic features can be further modulated by applying strain or an external electric field. For example, compressive strain can enlarge the tunneling window, while tensile strain can realize multiple-band-alignment (type-III and type-II) transformations. Our results provide important insights and guidance for the design and fabrication of future halide perovskite/antiperovskite-based TFETs.
2. Calculation method
Our calculations are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method29 implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.30 The standard PAW pseudo potentials29 are adopted. We used the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange correlation functional31 for crystal structure relaxation, and the hybrid density functional (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof, HSE06)32 for the electronic properties of perovskites. van der Waals corrections (vdW-DFT)33,34 have been included for the heterostructures. The cut-off energy was set to 500 eV after convergence tests. We employed 3 × 3 × 1 and 6 × 6 × 1 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids35,36 for the relaxation and self-consistent calculations, respectively. In our calculations, the total energy converged to less than 10−5 eV. The maximum force is less than 0.02 eV Å−1 during the optimization, at which both the lattice constants and atomic positions are fully relaxed. A vacuum space along the z-axis is larger than 20 Å to avoid spurious interactions. Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects have been included for the electronic band structures of all studied structures. We take Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br237 as an example to analyze the effects of different calculation methods on band edge positions (see the ESI†), and find that the band edges calculated by the HSE06 + SOC method match well with the experimental results. Therefore, we used the HSE06 + SOC method for the electronic properties of monolayer perovskites and heterostructures, and the PBE + SOC method for the electronic property modifications to save computational resources.
The phonon dispersion calculations were based on the PHONOPY code.38 A 3 × 3 × 1 supercell with a 9 × 9 × 1 k mesh was adopted to ensure convergence, and the non-spherical contributions were included. The room-temperature phonon spectrum was obtained by considering anharmonic phonon–phonon interactions with the temperature dependent effective potential (TDEP) code.39,40 The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to evaluate the thermal stability of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH.41 The AIMD simulations were performed using a 3 × 3 (126 atoms in total) superlattice in the canonical (NVT) ensemble. The superlattices were annealed for 5 ps with a time step of 1 fs in the simulations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Heterostructure design strategies, dynamic stability, and electronic properties of monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2
As shown in Fig. 1a, the layered halide perovskites A2BX4 (A+ = Cs+, Rb+; B2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+) crystallize in the tetragonal K2NiF4-type structure with the space group I4/mmm (no. 139). They can be viewed as an alternating arrangement of a perovskite [ABX3] layer and a rock salt [AX] layer along the stacking c-direction. The crystal structure of antiperovskite oxides X4OA2 (X2+ = Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+; A3− = P3−, As3−, Sb3−, Bi3−) can be described as analogous to that of a RP K2NiF4 phase, a naturally layered structure of alternating rock salt (XA) and antiperovskite (X3OA) layers. Actually, many layered halide perovskites and antiperovskite oxides have been synthesized experimentally (see the ESI†), and most of them have the I4/mmm ground state structure, which is consistent with the theoretically predicted structures. However, for a very few compounds, the experimentally determined space group and the theoretically predicted ground state phase are contradictory. For example, the space group of Ba4OP2 is Abnm obtained in experiments,42 but the anti-ferroelectric Cmce group is preferable in theory.28 Here, we only consider the I4/mmm structure to discuss the related physical properties in the rest of the paper.

The optimized structure parameters of monolayer halide perovskite A2BX4 and antiperovskite X4OA2 are summarized in the ESI,† and the monolayer perovskites and antiperovskites can be realized by high-temperature vapor phase epitaxy (VPE).43 It is found that the lattice constants for a monolayer system are close to those of the corresponding bulk phase. For instance, the in-plane lattice constants (a = b) for monolayer Rb2CdCl4 (Ba4OSb2) are 5.279 (5.255) Å, close to the experimental results of 5.207 (5.120) Å of the bulk phase. It is worth noting that the in-plane lattice constants of the monolayer layered halide perovskite A2BX4 are larger than those of the oxide antiperovskite X4OA2, bringing challenges to designing lattice-matched halide perovskite/oxide antiperovskite heterostructures based on small lattice cells. Meanwhile, we note that among the monolayer oxide antiperovskites, Ba4OSb2 has the largest lattice constant of 5.255 Å, and Rb2CdCl4 exhibits the smallest lattice constant of 5.279 Å among halide perovskites. And the lattice mismatch between monolayers Ba4OSb2 and Rb2CdCl4 is 0.2%.
In the next step, we consider the band-edge positions of these layered perovskites and antiperovskites, which serve as important guidance for designing heterojunction devices with different band alignments. The calculated absolute band-edge energies of monolayer halide perovskites A2BX4 (A+ = Cs+, Rb+; B2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+) and antiperovskite oxides X4OA2 (X2+ = Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+; A3− = P3−, As3−, Sb3−, Bi3−) are presented in Fig. 1b. The absolute band-edge energies are shifted to align with the vacuum level, which is set to zero. Remarkably, the valence band maximum (VBM) of monolayer antiperovskite oxides X4OA is much higher than the VBM of halide/sulfide perovskites, sometimes even higher than the conduction band minimum (CBM) of halide/sulfide perovskites. As a result, for the heterostructure construction of halide/sulfide perovskites and antiperovskite oxides, it is beneficial for designing type-III heterostructures but difficult to form type-II heterostructures (see the ESI† for a more detailed discussion). Since most 2D heterojunctions exhibit type-I or type-II band alignment, type-III band alignment is currently very rare, which can facilitate the engineering of the conduction- to valence-band transition energy. Moreover, heterojunctions with such band alignment hold unique promise for tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) and wavelength photodetector applications.44,45
Based on the matched lattice constants and band edge positions, we consider the halide perovskite Rb2CdCl4 and antiperovskite oxide Ba4OSb2 as representative compounds to study the vertical perovskite/antiperovskite heterostructures. Before investigating the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, we first discuss the dynamic stability and electronic properties of free-standing monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show the calculated phonon spectra of monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2. The curves show no imaginary frequencies, indicating that monolayers Rb2CdCl4and Ba4OSb2 are dynamically stable. Fig. 2c and d exhibit the electron localization function (ELF). We can clearly see that Cl and Cd atoms have, respectively, the highest and lowest ELF values, which indicates that Cd donates its electrons to the system while Cl gains electrons,46 demonstrating an ionic bonding characteristic. Finally, the ELF of Ba4OSb2 is different from that of Rb2CdCl4, which is identified as a typical mixed covalent–ionic bonding system. From Fig. 2e, it can be seen that similar to the indirect band gap of bulk RbCdCl3, for monolayer Rb2CdCl4, the VBM is at the M point, while the CBM is at the Γ point, indicating an indirect band gap of 4.552 eV. The strong electron dispersion at the CBM and weak hole dispersion at the VBM lead to a light (heavy) electron (hole) effective mass for solid-state lighting.47 In experiments, Rb2CdCl2I2 is the first single-component white-light emitting material with an all-inorganic layered perovskite structure and is thermally highly stable up to 575 K.48 The calculated squares of the dipole transition matrix elements, P2, indicate that the indirect Rb2CdCl4 exhibits allowed transitions between band edges. The large band gap together with the less dispersive VBM demonstrates that the monolayer Rb2CdCl4 is unfavorable for optoelectronic applications. Unlike the large indirect band gap of monolayer Rb2CdCl4, monolayer Ba4OSb2 exhibits a 1.067 eV direct band gap, with both the VBM and CBM located at the Γ point. This small band gap is very close to the direct gap (1.10 eV by GW0 + SOC) of the bulk phase,25 suggesting that the layer effect does not modify the band gap in ferroelectric antiperovskite Ba4OSb2 as a result of the counteracting quantum effect and distortion effect. Moreover, Ba4OSb2 shows allowed and strong transitions between the band edges.

3.2. Structural and electronic properties of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH
To combine the advantages of two materials into a single system to achieve new physics, we use 1 × 1 Rb2CdCl4 and 1 × 1 Ba4OSb2 primitive cells to construct the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, in which the strain effect caused by the lattice constant mismatch (0.2%) can be ignored (see the ESI†). There are three possible stacking configurations (AA, AB, and AC) with high symmetry in this work, as shown in Fig. 3. For the stacking mode AA, Sb atoms in the Ba4OSb2 layer are aligned with the Cd atom in the Rb2CdCl4 layer. The AB and AC stacking modes can be viewed as shifting half of the cell along the diagonal and a directions, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Side views of three high-symmetry configurations of Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 heterostructures are (a) AA, (b) AB, and (c) AC. (d) Binding energy Eb of these three considered stacking modes as a function of the interlayer distance d along the z direction. The d varies around the equilibrium distance of each configuration and all atoms are relaxed with this constraint. 
In order to determine the stability of the heterostructure, we calculate the binding energy Eb by using the equation Eb = (Ehete − ERb2CdCl4 − EBa4OSb2)/N, where Ehete, ERb2CdCl4, and EBa4OSb2 are the total energies of the heterostructure, monolayer Rb2CdCl4, and Ba4OSb2, respectively, and N is the total atomic number in the heterostructure, which is equal to 14 in our studied system. Therefore, a negative binding energy suggests that the system can be experimentally prepared, and a more negative Eb represents a more energetically stable structure. We thus study the evolution of the binding energy as a function of the interlayer distance for each system in Fig. 3d to ensure that those stacks obtained from the free relaxations reach the minimum energy of the system rather than a local minimum. The lowest binding energies of the three patterns are obtained at their equilibrium states. First, the lowest binding energies are negative for three configurations, suggesting that the three Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWHs are all energetically stable. Secondly, the equilibrium interlayer distance increases from 2.541 Å in mode AC, to 3.006 Å in mode AB, to 3.990 Å in mode AA. The large variation of equilibrium interlayer distance (1.449 Å) is very different from the transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers (<1 Å).49,50 Thirdly, after optimizing the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 heterostructure, it is surprisingly found that spontaneous out-of-plane polarization appears in the Ba4OSb2 layer, with the O atom moving out within the octahedral cages of Ba cations in the z direction, although the polarization does not exist in the free-standing monolayer Ba4OSb2 with the I4/mmm symmetry. It is noteworthy that a substrate-induced ferroelectric phase transition was also observed in SrTiO3.51 The downward shift of the O atom in mode AA is 0.320 Å, and the upward shifts of the O atom in modes AB and AC are 0.400 Å and 0.040 Å, respectively. This indicates that the spontaneous out-of-plane polarization in the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 heterostructure depends on the stacking mode. Finally, the lowest binding energy of the considered structures increases from −1.20 eV in mode AB to −0.15 eV in mode AA. This large binding energy change results from the large variation in the equilibrium interlayer distance, which also appears in other perovskite heterobilayers.52 Therefore, mode AB was found to be the most energetically preferred configuration, and the following calculations are based on the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 heterostructure with mode AB.
To further examine the dynamic stability of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, we calculated the room-temperature phonon dispersions of the vdWH, as shown in Fig. 4. The phonon spectra show no imaginary frequencies, indicating the dynamic stability of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. We next adopted AIMD simulations to confirm the thermal stability of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH in Fig. 4b. It was found that the geometry of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH is well preserved at room temperature. The phonon spectra and AIMD results indicate that the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH is stable at room temperature.

Based on the most energy-favorable stacking, Fig. 5a shows the projected band structures of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. It can be seen that the band structure of the heterostructure seems to be a simple superposition of isolated Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 monolayers. And the conduction band edge of Rb2CdCl4 lies lower than the valence band edge of Ba4OSb2, demonstrating no overlap between the energy band gaps of monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2. This suggests a typical type-III band alignment in the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. Thus, a tunneling window is formed when the CBM of Rb2CdCl4 falls below the VBM of Ba4OSb2. Moreover, we note that the Ba2HfS4/Sr4OAs2 vdWHs also form the type-III band alignment as shown in the ESI.†

The blue and red rectangles represent the energy levels of Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2, respectively. (c) Plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. The inset is a three-dimensional charge density difference, and the isosurface value is 0.0007 e Å−3. The yellow and blue areas represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
To intuitively show the type-III characteristics of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, we compare the energy levels of monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 in the precontact and contact states in Fig. 5b. The energy levels are aligned with the vacuum level (Evac), and Evac is set to zero. In the precontact state, the values of the CBM and VBM in monolayer Ba4OSb2 are higher than those of the Rb2CdCl4 monolayer with a conduction-band offset (ECBO) and valence-band offset (EVBO) of 0.110 and 3.595 eV, respectively. When they contact each other, the electrons spontaneously move from Ba4OSb2 to the Rb2CdCl4 monolayer, and the holes flow in the opposite direction, resulting in charge accumulation in the Rb2CdCl4 layer and depletion in the Ba4OSb2 layer. The accumulated electrons in the conduction band of the Rb2CdCl4 layer induce a 1.056 eV downshift of the conduction band edge, which is lower than the Fermi level. Meanwhile, the depleted electrons in the valence band of the Ba4OSb2 layer shift the valence band edge over the Fermi level. As a result, the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH exhibits a typical type-III band alignment, which confirms the previous projected band structure analysis in Fig. 5a. The electrons tend to tunnel directly from the VBM of Ba4OSb2 to the CBM of Rb2CdCl4, with a tunneling window of 0.712 eV. This behavior is called band-to-band transport (BTBT), which can be used to explore the tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs).53 In terms of dynamics, the electron flow is driven by the work function, defined as the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi level. The calculated work functions of monolayers Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 are 4.488 and 2.636 eV, respectively. In the contact state, the Fermi level of Rb2CdCl4 will be pushed up and the Fermi level of Ba4Osb2 will be pulled down until the Fermi levels are at the same energy of 2.798 eV.
To analyze the charge transfer in the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4Osb2 vdWH, we calculate the plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) along the vertical direction (z axis) in Fig. 5c. Here, Δρ(z) is calculated by the charge density difference between the heterostructure and the two noninteracting monolayers. A positive Δρ(z) indicates the accumulation of the charge density, while a negative value means depletion. It is shown that most charges distribute at the interface of the heterojunctions, and the charges accumulate around the Rb2CdCl4 layer, while charge depletion appears in the Ba4OSb2 layer. This is more evident in the 3D charge density difference plotted in the inset, which clearly presents the electrons accumulating in the Rb2CdCl4 region. The charge-transfer path agrees with the band edge analysis of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. Meanwhile, the amount of charge transfer (10−3) in the type-III Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH is one order of magnitude larger than that in type-II vdWHs, such as GeSe/SnS54 and Mg(OH)2/VS2.55 This suggests significant charge transfer in the type-III Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, and a strong built-in electric field can be expected in the vdWH.
3.3. Effects of strain on the band alignments of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH
Applying vertical strain is an effective way to tailor the electronic properties of layered materials. It can be realized by hydrostatic pressure,56 an atomic force microscopy tip,57 vacuum thermal annealing, nanomechanical pressures, or inserting hexagonal BN dielectric layers.58 In our calculations, the vertical strain is implemented by the variation of the interlayer distance Δd, characterized by d–d0, where d and d0 are the vertical distances for strained and unstrained bilayers, respectively. Fig. 6 presents the band structures of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH with three representative Δd from −0.4 Å to 2.0 Å. The binding energies of all studied strained configurations are negative (see Fig. 3), indicating the stability of the strained Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH. Generally, a structural transition may happen when the system is under high strain.59 However, mode AB is still found to be the most stable one among the three considered structures for the considered strains −0.4 Å–2.0 Å (see Fig. 3). Thus, there is no structural transition during the strain process. Furthermore, the upward shift of the O atom is always around 0.40 Å and remains almost unchanged under the effect of vertical strain. This suggests that the spontaneous out-of-plane polarization in the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH is robust to the vertical strain.
 Fig. 6  (a–c) Projected band structures and (d) the variation of band gap Eg of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH under various vertical strains at the PBE level with SOC. Δd refers to the variation of the interlayer distance, and positive(negative) values of Δd mean tensile (compressive) strain. 
When the compressive strain (Δd < 0) is applied, the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH still maintains the type-III band alignment, and the tunneling window is enhanced by the compressive strain. Here, considering many electronic structures and efficient computational resource use in this section, we thus adopt the PBE + SOC method to calculate the electronic structure and find that the band alignment and tunneling window variation are similar to those in the HSE + SOC method. The tunneling window increases from 0.712 eV for Δd = 0 to 0.878 eV for Δd = −0.2 to 0.902 eV for Δd = −0.4. If we apply the tensile strain (Δd > 0), the band alignment of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH turns from type-III to type-II. As shown for the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH with Δd = 2.0 in Fig. 6c, it is a direct-gap semiconductor, with a band gap (105 meV) located at the Γ point. The direct-gap feature is totally different from the indirect gap of the pristine monolayer Rb2CdCl4 in Fig. 2. The very dispersed VBM gives rise to a light hole effective mass m0, which is much smaller than the heavy hole effective mass in the free-standing monolayer Rb2CdCl4. Accordingly, the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH can preserve the excellent electronic properties of the Rb2CdCl4 and Ba4OSb2 monolayers. On the other hand, we can see that the VBM and CBM of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH are contributed by Ba4OSb2 and Rb2CdCl4, respectively, demonstrating the type-II band alignment characteristics. In this sense, the Ba4OSb2 layer can act as an electron donor, and the Rb2CdCl4 layer is the electron acceptor, creating a low electron–hole recombination efficiency that is beneficial for the separation of carriers, denoting an appealing characteristic for light harvesting in highly efficient photovoltaic devices. Finally, with increasing tensile strain, the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH retains type-II band alignment, and both the VBM and CBM deviate from the Fermi level continuously, enlarging the energy band gap in Fig. 6d. Therefore, the application of strain can control the band alignment of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH, which is very useful for certain electronic designs. In addition to strain, the electric field is also found to change the tunneling window of the Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWH (see the ESI†).
4. Conclusion
In summary, we systematically studied the band alignment of monolayer RP phase halide perovskites A2BX4 (A+ = Cs+, Rb+; B2+ = Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+) and anti-RP phase antiperovskite oxides X4OA2 (X2+ = Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+; A3− = P3−, As3−, Sb3−, Bi3−) by first-principles calculations. It is found that the VBM of monolayer antiperovskite oxides X4OA2 is much higher than the VBM of halide/sulfide perovskites, sometimes even higher than the CBM of halide/sulfide perovskites. Based on the obtained band alignments, we take monolayer halide perovskite Rb2CdCl4 and antiperovskite oxide Ba4OSb2 as the representative compounds to study the vertical perovskite/antiperovskite heterostructures. In the heterostructure, the spontaneous out-of-plane polarization appears in the Ba4OSb2 layer and depends on the stacking mode, while the polarization does not exist in the free-standing Ba4OSb2 layer. The most stable Rb2CdCl4/Ba4OSb2 vdWHs possess type-III band alignment with a broken gap, which is favorable for tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs). Moreover, the band alignment can be further modulated by applying strain or an external electric field. For example, compressive strain can enlarge the tunneling window, while tensile strain can realize multiple-band-alignment (type-III and type-II) transformations. We hope that our theoretical results will inspire further research on halide perovskite/antiperovskite heterostructures and related experimental enthusiasm.
