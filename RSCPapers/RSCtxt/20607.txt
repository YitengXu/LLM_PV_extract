1. Introduction
MXenes (transition metal carbides and nitrides) are new members of the rapidly expanding family of 2D materials, and the first known MXene was Ti3C2, which was produced by selective etching of Al from Ti3AlC2. MXenes have the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M is the early transition metal, X is carbon/nitrogen, and Tx represents surface terminations (O, OH, Cl, and F; x is the number of surface terminations). More than 30 MXene compounds are currently being synthesized, and many more are theoretically anticipated.1–4 Professor Yury Gogotsi and his Drexel University colleagues reported the very first work on extraordinary 2D MXenes, the first Ti3C2X,1 and subsequently the etching of Ti3AlC2 with hydrofluoric acid (HF), which introduced O, OH, and F functionalities on the surface. The relative stability of various surface terminations was demonstrated in this sequence: Ti3C2O2 > Ti3C2F2 > Ti3C2(OH)2.1,5 The general chemical formula of MXenes is given as Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M can be Ti, V, Nb, Mo, etc. X can be C or N, with surface groups such as OH, O, and F yielding potential 2D structures of different compositions, namely M2X, M3X2, M4X3 and M5X4 (ref. 2) (Fig. 1). Functional groups are often included in MXenes to provide hydrophilicity.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the MXene structures. 2D MXenes have a general formula of Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal, X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and Tx represents surface terminations of the outer metal layers. The n value in the formula can vary from 1 to 4, depending on the number of transition metal layers (and carbon and/or nitrogen layers) present in the structure of MXenes, for example, Ti2CTx (n = 1), Ti3C2Tx (n = 2), Nb4C3Tx (n = 3), and (Mo, V)5C4Tx (n = 4).

MXenes represent a new 2D-structure-based material family that has developed significantly over the past decade, in particular, they find applications in batteries, photonics, sensors, and CO2 reduction, and as electrocatalysts, etc.6–8 MXenes offer superior support because of their extremely large area, broad surface performance, and distinctive geometrical and electronic structures.8–11 The combination of conductivity (ions/electrons) and electrochemical reaction (oxidation/reduction) is important in battery technology, while electrocatalysis is influenced by thermodynamic, charge transfer, ohmic and concentration overpotentials. Conductivity affects transparent conducting films and thermoelectric devices, respectively, while photoconductivity has an effect on optoelectronic devices.5
Generally, MXenes are prepared by selective etching of MAX phases, and are considered as a family of ternary compounds consisting of a transition metal (M), an A-group element, and a carbon or nitrogen (X). Multifaceted flakes of MXenes are often generated by selective etching of the middle element A from a MAX phase (MAX becomes MX), such as the etching of Al from Ti3AlC2 as discussed above, using intercalation agents, e.g., LiF, etc. (Fig. 2).7 MAX-layered precursors provide the raw ingredients for MXenes, including Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, and S (Fig. 3).5,12 MAX phases are a class of ternary nitrides and carbides that exist as nanolaminates. Mn+1AXn (n = 1–3) is the general formula for MAX phases, where M is a transition metal, A is a group A element, and X is either carbon or nitrogen. The n number may be 1, 2, or 3, and the phases are designated as MAX phases 211, 312, and 413. Layers of transition metal carbides or nitrides (Mn+1Xn) are interleaved with layers of A-element atoms to create them.10,11 Unlike certain others, the solid architecture and characteristics of MXenes, which are significantly proportional to the derived surface removal, are found to be M or X elements.10,11,13,14 The composition and structure of transition metal components and their electronic properties can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of transition metal elements to surface functional groups, resulting in a variable bandgap, extremely high electrical activity and charging density, and increased mechanical performance resistance.10,11,13,14 For example, most surface terminations of MXenes have a considerable amount of negative charge as a result of the electron transportation between the outer metal element and surface termination, allowing metal cations to bind to the surface of the material in question. In addition, targeted etching may remove the adjacent external metal atoms, resulting in the production of vulnerable metal void defects with a high capacity for reducing the number of metal ions binding and reducing them in solution.5,12,14,15 Extensive simulation and practical research demonstrated how the content and arrangement of surface terminations significantly impact the physiochemical properties of MXenes. The anions in the etchant produce the surface termination Tx of Mn+1CnTx MXenes when using the exposed A-site atoms of the MAX phase. Surface chemistry investigation of MXenes has accelerated and will probably increase further in the future.5,12

Electrocatalysis is essential in sustainable energy transformation since it can convert atmospheric gases (including water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen) into value-added products using energy sources.16–18 Attempts have been made to investigate the fundamental electrocatalytic processes associated with the ORR, OER, HER, NRR, and CRR by various electrocatalysts such as heterostructured electrocatalysts,19 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures,20,21 metal–metalloids,22 non-van der Waals 2D electrocatalysts,23 transition metal nitrides (TMN),24 metallenes25 and non-noble electrocatalysts.26,27 For example, defect-rich and ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets fabricated by self-foaming pyrolysis were used as multifunctional electrocatalysts for the ORR, OER, and HER.28 In another work, a MoS2-based HER catalyst was developed wherein the baseline plane was stimulated and tuned by the synthesis of strained sulfur vacancies, and this catalyst showed high intrinsic HER activity.29 Recently, MXenes have been studied for electrocatalysts in clean energy conversion, namely the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).17,30 This demonstrates that MXenes may be potential electrocatalysts in the aforementioned processes, replacing costly platinum-based and RuO2 catalysts.5,16 Among the major issues, adsorption, membrane separation, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis systems are regarded to be practical and economically feasible remediation techniques that may be addressed by using MXenes on a massive scale.17,31 Mo2CTx MXene was the first electrocatalyst reported for the HER and thus opened the door for MXene-based electrocatalyst development for a wide variety of clean energy challenges.32 MXenes have a lot more advantages compared to other 2D layered structures. The first one is their bulk production in water and their non-toxic nature. Secondly, the high surface area and high electrical conductivity of these 2D materials promise applicability in electrocatalytic activities, including the ORR, OER, and HER.
It is undeniably true that the investigation on MXenes is still in its early stages despite more than a decade after their discovery. Their properties are still at the exploration stage and have a plethora of untapped potential yet to be realized. Because of the significant applications of these rapidly developing 2D materials, it is essential to conduct timely reviews of the most recent advances in order to expedite the research outcome. Even though several outstanding evaluations on diverse MXene-based fields have sprouted,33–38 a comprehensive description and assessment of the latest accomplishments in electrocatalysis continues to be a void in the knowledge base. This review will therefore focus on MXenes from the perspective of electrocatalysts. The present review begins with a general discussion of synthetic methodologies followed by highlighting the most recent advances in electrocatalysis technologies (ORR, OER, HER, NRR, and CRR). Throughout this review, we focused on emerging trends in MXene-based energy conversion technologies and their potential for growth in the years to come. International research communities from a wide range of fields, including material science, chemistry, and engineering, are expected to find this review very informative.
2. Synthesis strategies
Synthesis of MXenes has seen a resurgence of activity since 2011,1,4,39 where efforts have been made towards developing cost-effective and energy-efficient synthetic protocols for MXenes. Typically, MXenes are synthesized via fluoride etching, alkali treatment, electrochemical etching, and water-free etching, as reviewed in this section (Fig. 4).38 Usually the MAX phase is the starting precursor for MXene preparation; however, certain MXenes, such as Mo2CTx and Zr3C2Tx, were produced by etching the A-elements from the non-MAX phases Mo2Ga2C and Zr3Al3C5.40,41 The use of molten salts, which allow the A-element to be removed at high temperatures, is an alternate way of etching. After etching, the MXenes obtained were usually of high purity. Synthesis of Ti4N3 was accomplished by etching Ti4AlN3 with molten fluoride salt (Fig. 5).42 Aside from wet etching, chemical vapor deposition is another technique for MXene production. One advantage of this technique is that the 2D MXenes are left unterminated.43 To date, over 30 MXenes have been created using etching techniques on MAX phase precursors by removing the A-element.44 The structure of the MAX phase precursor and the etching technique govern the building block of MXene, Mn+1Xn concluded by specific functional groups.1,40,44 When alloying novel metals to the MAX phases, the synthesized MXenes are no longer restricted to MXenes such as Mo2C.1,40 Consequently, the expanded MXenes (MXenes created by alloying new metals) such as double-metal MXene (Mo2Ti) C2, (Cr2Ti) C2, etc. are essentially limitless.45,46 Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the thermodynamic stability of the MAX phase with various compositions, and the results revealed the existence of stable M2AX phases, including solid solutions. The Pourbaix diagram and thermodynamic stability of MXenes under electrochemical circumstances were studied, and it was discovered that novel MXene materials might be synthesized by etching.47,48

Recently, Gogotsi et al. suggested the synthesis of Mo4VAlC4 and found a new family of phases to investigate, possibly synthesizing many more M5X4 MXenes.49 The Mo4VAlC4 MAX phase with no additional impurities enabled the production of phase pure Mo4VC4 MXene. Mo4VAlC4 has a structure similar to that of other MAX phases, however many of the peaks in the XRD spectrum do not coincide precisely with those of a normal P63/mmc MAX structure. The (002) peak is located at 6.26°, suggesting a c lattice parameter (c-LP) of 28.216 Å (Fig. 6a). Gogotsi et al. tried to etch the Al layers selectively using hydrofluoric acid. After the first centrifuge wash cycle, the supernatant exhibited a little green tinge following the HF selective etching (Fig. 6b). This is most likely due to the dissolving of V from the MAX/MXene, since any V-containing impurities left over after the HCl treatment, such as V-based carbides, would not be dissolved by HF.49

Lately, Neale et al. presented the synthesis of Ti4N3Tx as well as the first optical, electrochemical, and electrical characterization of this 2D-layered hybrid MXene, demonstrating that it displayed both metallic and semiconducting characteristics.50 By extracting the A-site Al3+ cation separating Ti4N3 layers in the MAX phase via a temperature-programmed reaction with molten fluoride salts, they synthesized Ti4N3Tx MXene from the Ti4AlN3 MAX phase, which was prepared via a high-temperature pressure solid-state reaction between TiH2, AlN, and TiN (Fig. 7).50 To begin, the A-site Al3+ cation in the MAX phase is etched by eutectic molten salt treatment in a temperature-programmed process. Second, acid treatment removes fluoride ions, resulting in multilayered Ti4N3Tx MXene. Thirdly, exfoliation is achieved by sonication in an aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH).

Exfoliation of multilayered Ti4N3Tx is accomplished via sonication in tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) solution to produce single-and/or few-layered Ti4N3Tx MXene as a pale, pinkish-peach aqueous colloid.

Mo2CTx (where Tx refers to the surface terminations of O, OH, and F) MXene was created by selectively etching Ga atoms from a Mo2Ga2C crystal in HF solution to create a 2D organ-like molybdenum carbide. The hydrothermal technique was used to make MoS2 nanoflowers to decorate Mo2CTx MXene. This technique enhances the electrocatalyst's electronic conductivity and controls its electronic structure to boost intrinsic HER activity in basic solution.51 In another study, Co-based MOF (ZIF-67) crystals were formed on the 3D MXene hydrogel to create a 3D ZIF-67@MXene composite hydrogel. The electrostatic repulsive interactions between the nanosheets are destroyed by cross-linking Co2+ ions with the OH groups of MXene, resulting in a stable 3D MXene hydrogel.52
As a general technique for producing additional MXenes, the E-etching process was developed.53–55 Because V2CTx and Cr2CTx are difficult to synthesize under moderate circumstances and have the same M period as Ti, they were chosen as representatives.55 The efficient etching method was investigated for Ti2N (MXene), synthesized by selective etching of Al from a Ti2AlN precursor using a potassium fluoride and hydrochloric acid combination.56,57 In another study, ammonization at 600 °C transforms Mo2CTx and V2CTx carbide MXenes into 2D metal nitrides. Mo2N maintains the MXene structure while V2N changes into a mixed layer structure, including trigonal V2N and cubic VN.58,59 Beyond the MAX phases, the transition metals Zr and Hf are more likely to produce a distinct family of layered ternary and quaternary transition metal carbides with the formulas (MC)nAl3C2 and (MC)n[Al(Si)]4C3 (where M = Zr or Hf, n = 13). The Zr-containing MXene was recently produced by selective etching of AlC units from layered Zr3Al3C5.41,60,61
Traditional methods for synthesizing MXene quantum dots (MQDs), such as the widely used solvothermal and hydrothermal methods, are time-consuming and require high temperatures and hazardous chemicals. Recently Yeo et al. suggested a additive-free, room-temperature technique for delaminating multilayer MXene into monolayer MQDs, which takes advantage of the enormous mechanical force that occurs when the sample is nebulized by high-frequency acoustic waves.62 MXenes must still be built into structures with high ionic and electronic transport characteristics before being utilized as electrocatalysts.63 In this review, recently proposed synthesis strategies were classified based on the elemental group of M in MAX phases, such as IVB MXene, VB MXene, and VIB MXene synthesis strategies.

Table 1 summarizes the various techniques for MXene synthesis. The etching of MXenes with fluoride-containing techniques, molten salt, and electrochemical etching methods has been discussed with various precursors.

3. ORR electrocatalysts
Research and development of innovative clean energy conversions based on renewable sources are in great demand. Electrocatalysis, particularly the ORR in alkaline media, is a crucial building block for renewable energy systems. The slow kinetics of the ORR on the cathode restricts the fuel cell performance. Advanced transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXene) are a new class of 2D materials with excellent conductivity, strength, and corrosion resistance in an alkaline medium. MXenes have surface functional groups that can enhance the adsorption of metal particles by anchoring active sites.
3.1 MXene-based ORR electrocatalysts
Recently, Wang et al. reported a series of MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, V2CTx, and Nb2CTx and investigated their electrochemical performance for H2O2 generation.65 All the three MXenes showed high selectivity and great potential for H2O2 electrogeneration. Interestingly, Nb2CTx MXene displayed high ORR activity and a high H2O2 production rate of 1.95 mol gcat−1 h−1 at 0.1 V (vs. RHE). However, the stability of Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx materials is poor due to the intrinsic dissolution property of Ti and V in alkaline media. Chenxi Xu et al. showed that loading Pd nanoparticles on a hybrid catalytic substrate consisting MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and carbon nanotubes improves the performance of the electrocatalyst. Compared to the Pd/C catalyst, this hybrid catalyst had increased durability and enhanced ORR activity. For the ORR, the mass-specific activity and specific activity of the Pd/Ti3C2Tx–CNT catalyst were 4.4 and 3.3 times higher, respectively, than those of Pd/C. The higher cell voltage based on the Pd/Ti3C2Tx–CNT (1:2) catalyst is consistent with its lower activation over-potential loss and greater ORR catalytic activity than Pd/C.66 This improved catalyst performance may be ascribed to stronger metal–support contact and/or faster interfacial oxygen kinetics. Pd/C, Pd/CNT, and Pd/Ti3C2Tx–CNT (1:2) catalysts employed in fuel cells had peak power densities of 26.2 mW cm−2, 42 mW cm−2, and 48 mW cm−2 at 60 °C, respectively. These findings support Pd/Ti3C2Tx–CNT (1:2) as a superior catalytic performer (Fig. 8a).

A new FeNC/MXene hybrid nanosheet was synthesized for the first time by pyrolyzing a simple Fe inorganic salt, N precursor, and MXene nanosheets. The tough FeNC covering is tightly connected to the surface of MXene, which offers adequate ORR active sites, making it suitable for electrocatalysis. With a half-wave potential of 0.814 V against RHE, the FeNC/MXene hybrid nanosheet demonstrated outstanding ORR activity.65 The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of FeNC/MXene-1 at various rotating electrode rates were examined to explore the ORR kinetic properties, showing that the limiting current densities increased with the rise in rotation rates (Fig. 8b). The linear relationships and first order reaction kinetics were shown by the matching Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (inset in Fig. 8b) with data derived from the LSV curves. The K–L plots suggested transfer electron numbers of 3.9–4.0 from a potential range of 0.2–0.4 V, indicating a straight four electron reduction route for FeNC/MXene-1. The Tafel plot in Fig. 8c shows the FeNC/MXene hybrid nanosheets as excellent electron transport channels. The Tafel slope of FeNC/MXene-1 is 30 mV dec−1, which is significantly lower than that of Pt/C (45 mV dec−1), indicating that FeNC/MXene-1 has a different electron transfer pathway compared to that of Pt/C.65 The pyridinic nitrogen and Fe–Nx species are widely thought to be responsible for the high ORR activity. In contrast, oxidized nitrogen is not significantly linked to ORR performance and is unstable during ORR operation. Fig. 8d shows that the most common nitrogen configurations in the FeNC/MXene-x series of catalysts were pyridinic nitrogen and graphitic nitrogen.65
By doping Nb2CT2 MXene with isolated Pt/Pd atoms, Wei and his coworkers theoretically developed a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst.67 The Nb2CF2–VF–Pt catalyst outperformed the industry-standard Pt (111) and IrO2 catalysts (110). The findings show that restricting a single atom by replacing surface atoms is viable for fabricating MXene-supported isolated atoms for high-efficiency electrocatalytic energy conversion. Various electronic characteristics were computed to show the high reactivity of the chosen catalysts and the rules followed in reactions. First, the density of states (DOS) of all surface-decorated catalysts revealed significant concentrations of Nb-4d electrons at the Fermi level (EF) for Nb2C, Nb2C–Pd, and Nb2C–Pt (Fig. 9a–d). These high 4d states provide the intermediates with more than enough electrons, resulting in very strong contacts and problems with product release. The density of states for terminated MXene (Nb2CO2, Nb2CF2, and Nb2C (OH)2), on the other hand, was very low at the EF, suggesting that the catalysts were unable to supply enough electrons to catalyze the reaction. The work function and charge transfer mechanism of Nb2CF2–VF–Pt (Fig. 9e and f) further showed the core of their outstanding bifunctional catalytic activities.67

3.2 Surface mechanisms for the ORR by DFT
Zhou et al. have used high-throughput DFT technology to study a series of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition-metal single atoms confined on 2D Ti2CT and Ti3C2T surfaces for the ORR.68 The MXene family's typical representatives were Ti2C, Ti3C2, and Ti3CN, with the O termination situated in the hollow site between three adjacent Ti atoms (Fig. 10a). The O termination was then used to immobilize 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atoms as a coordination site. Because of the filled d-orbital valence electron and relatively high electronegativity of the Cu atom, the Ti2CO2-MXene-supported Cu isolated atom was chosen and calculations were performed to understand the increase in Cu atoms immobilized at FCC sites with higher negative binding energy. This suggested that FCC sites, such as the hollow site between three neighboring O atoms and the top sites of the C atom, were the most stable coordination centers (Fig. 10b). The O 2p orbitals in molecular O2 may hybridize with Cu 3d orbitals in the valance band range of 3 to 1 eV, suggesting charge carrier transfer between the O2 molecule and Cu single atom, according to the projected density of states (PDOS) results (Fig. 10c). The research showed that a single transition-metal atom injected on the MXene support may enhance electron transfer and lengthen OO bonds, resulting in improved ORR performance.68

The O2 → OOH* → O* → OH* → H2O (O* mechanism) is now the most generally recognized associative ORR mechanism. There is another route: O2 → OOH* → 2OH* → OH* → H2O (2OH* mechanism), where 2OH* replaces the intermediary O* in the O* mechanism. Because two OH* may bind to distinct active sites, the free energy of 2OH* is roughly equal to that of O*. According to the well-known scaling equation ΔG(O*) = 2ΔG(OH*), these two pathways are thermodynamically comparable for catalysts with near-continuous active sites.
For conventional catalysts, most studies addressed only the O* pathway, which is logical and comparable to the 2OH* approach. In recent years, a new potential area in heterogeneous catalysis has emerged: single-atom catalysts with isolated active sites. Because of its unique atomically scattered active sites, the reaction process on the single-atom catalyst may vary. The ORR has three surface intermediates, two of which (OOH* and OH*) are the same in O* and 2OH* processes69,70 (Fig. 11a and b).
 Fig. 11  2OH* and O* ORR mechanisms on (a) near-continuous and (b) single-site catalysts. These two ORR mechanisms are thermodynamically equivalent on catalysts with near-continuous active sites, while they are different on single-atom catalysts.

Hermansson et al. suggested first-principles simulations to look at the ORR catalytic behavior of Ptn/v–Ti2CO2 (n = 1–4) Pt3Au/v–Ti2CO2, to see how the platinum quantity and doped metal influence the ORR activity.69 ORR intermediates such as O*, OH*, and OOH* must be adsorbed on Ptn/v–Ti2CO2 (n = 1–4) and Pt3Au/v–Ti2CO2 for the ORR to occur. As a result, by comparing their total energy, the optimum geometries of the three ORR intermediate species on the different Pt-based sub nanoclusters are demonstrated in this order: Pt3Au/vTi2CO2 > Pt3/v–Ti2CO2 > Pt4/v–Ti2CO2 > Pt/v–Ti2CO2, indicating that moderate adsorption strength to oxygenated intermediates results in the highest ORR activity. Their findings have implications for the rational design of transition metal sub nanocluster/MXene hybrid catalysts with excellent ORR performance.69
The study of MXenes and MXene-derived ORR catalysts has been summarized in Table 2. The electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of MXene and traditional composite ORR catalysts for various typical processes are presented.

4. OER electrocatalysts
The oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is a fundamental process in renewable energy systems like rechargeable metal–air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolysis.78,79 However, overcoming the high overpotential (theoretically, a potential equivalent to 1.23 V under standard conditions should suffice) and sluggish kinetics of this four-electron oxidation reaction is crucial for efficient, practical use of green electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies.
The scientific community has been continuously investigating the development of robust, low-cost, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.80–82 The electrocatalyst could be developed as the electrode itself or immobilized on the working electrode surface (sometimes in porous hosts or with binders) for superior reactant adsorption and easier intermediate transformations (OH*, OOH*, and O* intermediates).78,83
4.1 MXene-based OER electrocatalysts
Mo2C and V2C coupled with N-doped graphene and Ti3C2Tx hybridized with metal–organic framework nanosheets have shown OER activity. Wei et al. suggested Nb2CT2 as a typical MXene for developing bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The theoretical voltages vs. RHE for Nb2CO2–Pd, Nb2CO2–Pt, Nb2CF2–Pd, and Nb2CF2–Pt were 1.79, 2.34, 1.68, and 2.20 V, respectively (Fig. 12). Nb2CO2–VO–Pt and Nb2CF2–VF–Pt had the lowest ηOER, 0.39 and 0.37 V, respectively, resulting in high OER activity.67 This was ascribed to the surfaces' suitably strong adsorption of intermediates and mild d-orbital states. The aforementioned study established that the electrical surface structures of Nb2CO2 and Nb2CF2 were appropriately optimized by substituting single Pt atoms for the O and F-terminating groups in Nb2CO2–VO–Pt and Nb2CF2–VF–Pt (Fig. 12). Efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity was obtained.

Zhang et al. suggested density functional theory calculations to develop Cr2CO2 MXene-supported single metal atoms as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. The possible single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the HER and OER are ten single-transition metal (TM) atoms (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, Ir, and Au) anchored on Cr2CO2 (TM/Cr2CO2). Ni/Cr2CO2 had the best OER activity, with overpotentials of 0.46 and 0.16 V for the HER, respectively.84Fig. 13a and b exhibit the results of an investigation into the OER performance of TM/Cr2CO2. One of the major characteristics of the OER is overpotential, which is primarily influenced by the binding strength between reaction intermediates and the catalyst surface. The OER is calculated by identifying which four basic stages have the highest positive reaction free energy (ΔGmax) as the potential limiting step (PLS). Fig. 13a and b show that the initial stage in the PLS of Ir/Cr2CO2, Mo/Cr2CO2, and Pd/Cr2CO2 (H2O dissociation into an adsorbed *OH (ΔG1)) corresponded to ΔGmax values of 3.18, 3.85, and 1.96 eV, respectively.84

Fan et al. used the MXenes M2NO2 (M = Ti, V, Cr) to support a succession of transition metal atoms X (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) as single atom catalysts for the OER. Cu anchored on Ti2NO2 shows promise as an OER electrocatalyst among these single atom site systems. Small molecule adsorption effects (for CO, NO, NO2, SO2, H2O, O2) were estimated as a result.85 The ΔG of the four OER reaction stages at the optimal catalyst, SACs of Cu–Ti2NO2, CuV2NO2, and Cu–Cr2NO2, which have lower overpotentials than the other X–M2NO2, is shown in Fig. 14. The ΔG in each phase is 1.23 eV at 0 V electrode potential (U = 0 V) and 0 eV at 1.23 V electrode potential (U = 1.23 V) for optimal OER electrocatalysts shown in Fig. 14a. As a result, with a perfect catalyst, the overpotential is 0 V (ignoring transport and other polarization losses). At U = 0 V, the four OER stages at Cu–M2NO2 are all uphill, as shown in Fig. 14b–d. Except for the production of OH*, all of the reaction steps at CuCr2NO2 are uphill. More significantly, for U = 1.23 V, the four steps at Cu–Ti2NO2 are nearly as flat as those at the optimum catalyst. Also, the four steps at Cu–Ti2NO2, Cu–V2NO2, and Cu–Cr2NO2 are all downhill, as shown in Fig. 14b–d. As a result, with a perfect catalyst, the overpotential is 0 V (apparently). Furthermore, the fourth step is the rate-determining steps at Cu–Ti2NO2 and Cu–Cr2NO2, which convert OOH* to O2. At Cu–V2NO2, on the other hand, the rate-determining step in the transformation of O* to OOH* is the third step. At Cu–Ti2NO2, Cu–V2NO2, and Cu–Cr2NO2, the corresponding ΔGmax is 1.47, 1.72, and 1.51 eV, respectively, while the overpotentials are 0.24, 0.49, and 0.28 V. At Cu–Ti2NO2, when U is increased to 1.23 V, the production of O* and the emission of O2 go uphill. In contrast, the formation of OH* and OOH* goes downhill. The production of O* and OOH* is uphill at Cu–V2NO2, while the formation of OH* and the emission of O2 is downhill. Furthermore, the four steps at Cu–Ti2NO2 at U = 1.23 V are almost as flat as those at the optimum catalyst.85

V2C is the lightest member of the MXene family and has garnered widespread interest because of its strong electrical conductivity, outstanding mechanical characteristics, and high reactivity. Furthermore, the V2C MXene is extremely practical due to its synthesizability and OER electrocatalysis application. Unlike Ti3C2 MXene, the vanadium layers on the surface of V2C might allow pseudocapacitive behavior, allowing easy charge movement between the adsorbate and the V2C. The process consists of exfoliation of few-layer V2C and FeNi-LDH nanosheets coupled by in situ assembling via a simple hydrothermal method, in which hypophosphite groups (H2PO2) are introduced as intercalated anions in the LDH laminates to alter the surface electronic structure and thus further enhance the OER activity. The high interfacial connection and electrical coupling between LDHs and V2C nanosheets accelerate the fast charge transfer kinetics and improve the OER.85,180
NiFeCo acts as a model catalyst to study the phosphorisation and MXene coupling effects and improve the catalysts' intrinsic activity and conductivity.86 These effects form high valence metallic elements and promote the production of the NiOOH active phase at low voltage. MXenes can effectively modulate the electronic structure and optimize the d-band center, leading to enhanced OER performance. Thus, the NiFeCoP/MXene hybrid nanostructure exhibits outstanding performance and stability for the OER in alkaline solutions without activity decay. Ga-Doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on Ti3C2/Ni foam exhibit excellent catalytic activity and electrochemical durability toward the OER with an overpotential of 340 mV at 100 mA cm−2.87 DFT calculations also demonstrate that Ga-doping optimizes the electronic structure of Ni3S2, leading to stronger binding strength of the oxygen intermediate (*OOH) at Ni active sites near Ga. In addition, the 3D Ti3C2/NF structure enhances the charge transfer kinetics and provides more active sites for Ga–Ni3S2 during the OER process, resulting in fast charge and mass transport due to its highly conductive, electronegative and hydrophilic properties. Under favorable oxidative conditions, MXenes could be oxidized to metal oxides. In the case of Ti3C2Tx MXene, TiO2 undergoes an oxidation process, affecting the materials' stability. Benchakar et al. used a Co-LDH composite to provide oxidative-sensitive MXene with long-term stability at a high potential value during the OER. The presence of strong electrostatic contacts between Co-LDH and Ti3C2Tx provides improved stability. The inclusion of functional groups on the surface of Mo2CTx increased the chemical bonding between Co–MoS2 and Mo2CTx, as well as the stability of the repeated cycles.87,182
4.2 Surface mechanisms for the OER by DFT
Cu–Ti2NO2, the most active SAC for the OER, has been investigated further. Electronic states of Ti2NO2 over the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 15a, demonstrate the metallic character of the supporting substrate.86,87Fig. 15b depicts the bonding states between the Cu-3d and O-2p orbitals, as well as the many new electronic states around the Fermi level, implying a substantial increase in charge carrier density after Cu anchoring and making Cu–Ti2NO2 more active as an OER catalyst.86 The charge transfer to the Cu atom from the three O atoms (O1, O2, O3) demonstrates the Cu–O bonding state (Fig. 15c and d). The charge density difference (Δρ) of Cu–Ti2NO2 is determined byΔρ = ρCu–Ti2NO2 − ρTi2NO2 − ρCuAs seen in Fig. 15c and d, there is a clear charge transfer to the Cu atom from the three O atoms (O1, O2, O3) linked to it, demonstrating the Cu–O bonding state.

Recently, Wang et al. proved that Ni1@Ti3C2O2 and Pd1@Ti3C2O2 are highly promising OER electrocatalysts.87 They next computed the OER activity of Ti3C2O2 supported tiny Pd clusters using the Pd4 cluster (the smallest stereo cluster of Pd, as shown in Fig. 16a and b). Fig. 16c illustrates the free energy diagram. The over potential for the OER rises by just 0.06 V as compared to Pd1@Ti3C2O2. As a result, they demonstrated that even when isolated Pd atoms combine into tiny clusters, the outstanding OER activity of Pd1@Ti3C2O2 may be maintained.88

Based on DFT simulations and Sabatier analysis, Van Voorhis et al. recently predicted the O–O bond formation as the rate-limiting phase for iron oxide (Fe2O3). Both the acid–base and direct coupling of metal-oxo species seem to be equally feasible in their calculations. It has been observed that direct coupling of metal-oxo species results in 18O KIE (kinetic isotope effects) values of more than 1.03027. KIE for acid–base processes, on the other hand, vary from 1.017 to 1.03127. The rate-limiting step in the OER catalyzed by Fe2O3 is the production of O–O bonds through an acid–base mechanism rather than a direct coupling mechanism, based on the range of potential 18O KIEo–o.89,90

5. HER electrocatalysts
Renewable energy sources are required to avoid fossil fuels and global warming effects in recent years. However, the low energy delivery efficiency of some renewable energy sources limits their applications. The conversion of these energy sources into value-added chemical fuels is a prospective solution to store and transport energy with safety. Hydrogen (H2) is considered one of the most promising solar fuels owing to its high gravimetric energy density (as liquid), relatively high abundance, and low pollution emission during consumption.88,99 Water splitting is an alternative technique to produce green hydrogen with high reaction selectivity by using electricity from sunlight.88,99 The HER is one of the half-reactions in water electrolysis, including hydrogen atom adsorption, proton reduction, and H2 desorption processes.100,101
The HER in the acidic and basic electrolytes has been found to follow four pathways:H2O + e− → Hads Volmer reaction in acid solutionH+ + e− → Hads + OH− Volmer reaction in basic solutionHads + Hads → H2 Tafel reactionH+ + Hads + e− → H2 Heyrovsky reactionThe HER kinetics is influenced by either a Volmer–Tafel or Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism depending on the catalytic surface and applied potential. There is a consensus that the HER always consists of two primary steps in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.99,102
The HER reaction is a multi-step process that involves adsorption, reduction, and desorption in both acidic and alkaline media. The term “Volmer step” refers to the process of hydrogen adsorption from a hydronium ion (under acidic circumstances) or a dissociated water molecule (under alkaline conditions). The Heyrovsky or Tafel process combines the adsorbed hydrogen (H*) to create molecular hydrogen. Under actual electrocatalytic circumstances, these routes rely on the electrode surface's inherent chemical and electrical characteristics. The Tafel reaction can reveal the rate-determining step of the reaction, and it may provide some valuable discernment of possible reaction pathways.103,104 Due to their exceptional properties, MXenes and MXene-based materials have been extensively used as electrocatalysts for the HER.
5.1 MXene-based HER electrocatalysts
Since hydrogen is released during the synthetic processes of MXenes and related materials, MXenes are thought to be efficient catalytic materials for the HER.105 In particular, Mo2CTx, a promising catalytic candidate for the HER, exhibits good stability in acidic medium during galvanostatic measurements.32 Computational studies suggest that the basal planes of Mo2CTx are catalytically more active, unlike in the case of MoS2, in which the edge sites of the 2H phase are active. The carbon nanoplating strategy was reported for efficiently stabilizing the MXenes against structural degradation caused by the spontaneous oxidation reaction.106,107 This strategy provides the platform for synthesizing MXene-based materials with fascinating structures and properties. 2D hierarchical MoS2/Ti3C2-MXene@C nanohybrids are fabricated with excellent electrical properties, structural stability, and reaction kinetics for electrochemical reactions by assembling carbon coated few-layered MoS2 nanoplates on the carbon-stabilized Ti3C2 MXene backbone. As a result, they exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance for Li storage with high capacities and an ultra-long cycle life of 3000 cycles at a high rate of 20 A g−1. Meanwhile, MoS2/Ti3C2-MXene@C nanohybrids are also highly active non-precious metal electrocatalyst for the HER with positive onset potential, low overpotential and stable a low pH. A three-dimensional interconnected ternary nanoarchitecture was constructed from Ti3C2Tx MXene, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets and graphene using a convenient co-assembly process.108 The resulting nanoarchitecture creates numerous pore sites for fast transportation of electrolytes. Also, it exhibits an exceptional HER catalytic activity with a low onset potential of 38 mV and a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec−1 because of its large specific surface area, ultrathin nanolayers, optimized electronic structure, and high electric conductivity.
Due to the quantum confinement effect and metal–support interactions, single atom catalysts (SACs) can be ideal for electrochemical applications.108,109 To achieve desired catalytic activity and selectivity, SACs depend on the nature of the single metal atom and the solid supporting materials used to disperse the metal via possible interactions between them. Liu et al. reported a catalyst consisting of single-atom ruthenium (RuSA) sites supported on nitrogen (N) heteroatom-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene (N–Ti3C2Tx) through a coordinative interaction between RuSA and Ti3C2Tx.110 RuSA sites are stabilized via the formation of Ru–N bonds with N heteroatom dopants on the Ti3C2Tx MXene support, which remarkably enhances the electrocatalytic activity for the HER at various pH values. The reported RuSA–N–Ti3C2Tx catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance and stability with low overpotentials of 23, 27, and 81 mV to realize a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M PBS electrolytic solutions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong covalent interactions of RuSA and N sites on the Ti3C2Tx MXene support achieve a zero Gibbs hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*), which further facilitates the HER kinetics. 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene is employed as a solid support to host a nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) heteroatom dopant species coordinated isolated Ru single atom catalyst.111 As shown in Fig. 17a, the freshly prepared few-layered Ti3C2Tx was mixed with RuCl3·xH2O and thiourea, freeze-dried, and annealed at 500 °C under an inert atmosphere to produce the final product, RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx, which remarkably enhances the electrocatalytic activity for the HER in an acidic electrolyte solution with the lowest overpotential of 76 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. 17b. As shown in Fig. 17b, the current densities of RuSA–Ti3C2Tx and RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx catalysts in the HER polarization curves are not in the baseline at zero overpotential, which might be due to the underpotential hydrogen adsorption effects of precious Ru metal and the capacitance effect of nanocarbon from the Ti3C2Tx MXene support.112 The HER performance of RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx was compared with those of Ti3C2Tx MXene catalysts anchoring different metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), prepared under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 17c). Among them, RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx exhibited superior HER electrocatalytic activity, with the lowest overpotential value compared to Fe–N–S–Ti3C2Tx Co–N–S–Ti3C2Tx, Ni–N–S–Ti3C2Tx, and Pt–N–S–Ti3C2Tx catalysts in the acidic electrolyte solution.111

The high specific surface area, high conductivity, and surface terminal functional groups of MXenes bring the strong interactions between the MXene and metals, effectively tailoring the materials' catalytic activity. Thus, MXene would be an ideal material to support precious metals like Pt. The spray-drying method is proposed to fabricate 3D crumpled paper-like Ti3C2Tx MXene with the decoration of sub-nanometer Pt clusters. The 3D crumpled structure minimizes the re-stacking of 2D MXene sheets and maximises the exposure of Pt catalytically active sites.113 The as-proposed catalyst exhibits an excellent HER performance, including a low overpotential of 34 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a superior mass activity (1847 mA mgPt−1), a small Tafel slope (29.7 mV dec−1), and a high turnover frequency (10.66 H2 per s) compared to commercial Pt/C due to the charge transfer from Pt clusters to MXene. It leads to weakening of hydrogen adsorption.
As illustrated in Fig. 19c, a straightforward lyophilization–annealing treatment technique was investigated to generate the laminated nanoroll MoS2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid. The catalysts demonstrated high HER activity, with a minor start overpotential of 30 mV and at least a 25-fold increase in exchange current density over MoS2. The high HER performance is due to the strong contact between MoS2 and Ti3C2Tx, which enhances electron and charge transfer processes. More specifically, the conductive Ti3C2Tx acted as a promoter to boost charge transfer in MoS2. As illustrated in Fig. 19d, a simple technique was used in which Co atoms were doped into MoS2 formed on the surface of Mo2CTx to increase HER activity by efficiently modifying the electronic structure MoS2.181,182
The study on MXenes and MXene-derived HER catalysts is summarized in Table 4. For a range of typical processes, Table 4 highlights the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of MXenes and contrasts them to traditional composite HER catalysts.

5.2 Surface mechanisms for the HER by DFT
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that RuSA coordinated with N and S heteroatoms on the Ti3C2Tx MXene support is the active catalytic site for the HER. As shown in Fig. 17d, impressively, RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx shows a satisfactory ΔGH* value of 0.08 eV, which is much closer to zero, highlighting the beneficial H adsorption–desorption and subsequent H2 production characteristics of RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx. In addition, the total density of states analysis of RuSA–N–S–Ti3C2Tx confirms that the system possesses metallic characteristics with good electronic conductivity, which is favorable for the electrocatalytic HER.111
Kuznetsov et al. reported a new route for the synthesis and structural characterization of a solid solution phase of Mo2CTx:Co MXene with substitution of the Co atom on the molybdenum sites.116 The incorporation of a Co atom into a Mo2CTx matrix not only introduces an additional reaction site but also alters the binding energies of electrocatalytic reaction intermediates,122 thereby influencing the kinetics of the reaction. The favorable effect of cobalt substitution on the electronic structure and the redox properties of Mo2CTx:Co improves the HER catalytic activity compared to the unsubstituted Mo2CTx material. DFT calculations explain that even a small amount of Mo substituted by Co imparts a significant perturbation in the electronic structure of Mo2CTx:Co, in particular, affecting the hydrogen adsorption energies on the neighboring oxygen atoms of an oxygen-terminated Mo2CO2:Co surface, making these metallic sites more favorable for HER catalysis.
Zhang et al. prepared Mo2TiC2Tx MXene nanosheets by electrochemical exfoliation of Mo2TiC2Tx–VMo with abundant surface Mo vacancies, in which as-formed Mo vacancies can act as the anchoring sites for single Pt atoms (Fig. 18a).123 At the electrochemical exfoliation process, single Pt atoms are immobilized on the Mo vacancies and stabilized by forming covalent bonds with surrounding carbon atoms on the MXene. The resulting Mo2TiC2Tx–PtSA catalyst showed enhanced HER catalytic activity (30 and 77 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2) with excellent stability (10000 HER cycles) and increased 39.5-fold mass activity compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 18b and c). As shown in Fig. 18d, the ΔGH* of Mo2TiC2O2 is concluded to be −0.19 eV, resulting in strong hydrogen adsorption on Mo–O active sites. In contrast, the free energy (ΔGH*) for hydrogen adsorption reveals that the single Pt atom site on Mo2TiC2O2–PtSA is a hydrogen generation active site with a low adsorption energy of −0.08 eV, which is even lower than that for commercial Pt (−0.10 eV).124 Niu et al. developed a novel one-pot synthesis approach to incorporate Pt single atoms into the Mo2C nanocrystals confined in a MOF-derived 3D porous carbon material.125 The as-formed Pt–Mo2C–C catalyst with 0.7 wt% Pt content exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity for the HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution, with an overpotential of 155 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 7-fold higher mass activity than the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The electronic interaction between Pt single atoms and the Mo2C surface promotes the catalytic activity for the HER and strengthens hydrogen adsorption on the Mo2C surface. A Pt nanoparticle-deposited 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene catalyst is prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with a low Pt content (1.70 wt%).126 When the ALD cycle reached 40, the as-prepared catalyst showed the optimal HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 67.8 mV, approaching that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (64.2 mV), and the excellent HER catalytic activity is attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and the good electron conductivity of the MXene support. The HER performance and DFT study of Ti3C2O2 MXene quantum dots/graphene (QDs/G) heterostructure were investigated recently.

6. Nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR)
The generation of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N2) is a critical reaction, especially in light of the widespread usage of NH3 as a fertilizer, refrigerant, and feedstock.128 The classic Haber–Bosch process takes place at high temperatures (400–500 °C) and high pressures (10–30 MPa), consuming approximately 1–2% of global energy and causing approximately 1% of global energy-related CO2 emissions due to natural gas reforming.129 The electrochemical N2 reduction process, in which N2 combines with protons in an aqueous electrolyte, has garnered much attention during the last few years. It is believed that the electrochemical NRR, which makes use of renewable energy sources, is the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective method of producing “green ammonia”. In the NRR, a major challenge is the activation of the stable N2 triple bond, having a high bond energy of 941 kJ mol−1.130 Also, the strong interaction between the active intermediate N species and the catalyst may prevent the production of NH3. Hence the appropriate catalyst for the NRR should be designed to demonstrate the optimum interaction between N species and the catalyst. One more obstacle for the NRR is the competing HER, which can occur in acidic and alkaline environments.129,131,132 As a result, limiting the amount of hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst is also critical for improving catalytic performance.
6.1 MXene based nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) electrocatalysts
Various MXenes (e.g., Mo2C, W2C,133 and Mo2TiC2 (ref. 134)) have been investigated for their potential as electrochemical NRRs, as shown in Table 5. The terminations in MXenes play a very important role in determining the stability of the catalyst under various operating conditions and the selectivity for the NRR over the HER. In particular, as compared to O-terminated and N-terminated M2CTx MXenes, H-terminated M2CTx MXenes exhibit greater stability at higher potentials than the other two.135 Also, F-terminated Mo2CTx MXene exhibits higher NRR activity and structural stability than O-terminated Mo2CTx MXene.136,137 In addition to the basal sites of MXenes, it has been established that the edge sites of MXenes catalyze the NRR. In order to manufacture MXenes with more edge sites, vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are hosted on a FeOOH nanosheet electrode.138 It has been found that the Ti atoms on the edge of Ti3C2Tx preferentially bind and activate N2, with a low activation energy barrier in the first hydrogenation phase. Compared to horizontally or randomly ordered MXene sheets, the HER activity of the Ti3C2Tx sheet catalyst is low, resulting in a higher NRR faradic efficiency than the horizontally or randomly ordered MXene sheets. Also, bulk metal nitrides, such as VN, have shown potential in the NRR;139,140 however, due to the poorly defined nitride structure of nitride catalysts, it is challenging to control the reaction rate and catalyst deactivation. Nitrides with well-defined MXene structures have the potential to be more stable catalysts and to provide uniform active sites that correlate more closely with the structural models derived from DFT calculations of NRR mechanisms. Nitride reaction rates are lower than those of carbides, and surface heteroatoms such as oxygen atoms play an important role in limiting catalyst deactivation compared to carbides.139 It is possible to alter the amount and diversity of surface terminations or vacancies on MXenes by modifying the synthesis or reaction conditions,141 which should open the door to designing and developing effective NRR catalysts. It is also possible to modify the catalytic activity and selectivity of MXenes by substituting or adsorbing single metal atoms on their surfaces. DFT calculations have been used to screen for the balance between hydrogenation of *N2 to *N2H and hydrogenation of *NH2 to *NH3 for several MXene-supported single metal atom catalysts.142–144 Among 3d–5d TM-based MXene catalysts, the Ru-substituted Mo2CO2 catalyst has the lowest limiting potential of −0.46 V, making it the most efficient.145 Using Ru-doped Mo2CTx MXene, Tan and colleagues discovered that it exhibits excellent faradic efficiency and high ammonia production.146

7. MXene based CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) electrocatalysts
The release of CO2 into the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion has prompted global climate change.153 Attempts are underway to develop potential methods for CO2 mitigation and conversion CO2 into fuel and value-added chemicals through the electrochemical CRR using renewable electricity.154–156 In principle, through a series of proton/electron transfer steps, CO2 could be transformed into carbon-based products such as carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), and ethylene (C2H4). The overall general equation is as follows: mCO2 + n(H+ + e−) → products + xH2O.157 MXenes as CRR electrocatalysts are still in their infancy and under investigation using DFT.158–160 The computational investigation of the CRR to generate CH4 on 19 types of M2XO2 MXenes by Handoko and coworkers159 suggested that a favorable *HCOOH pathway primarily facilitated the CRR. As a result of the O(OH) groups preferring bonding with C in CO2, the formate (HCOO) intermediate forms preferentially on bare MXenes, whereas the carboxylate (HOCO) species forms on O/OH-terminated MXenes in the first hydrogenation step. According to She et al., CO2 reduction involves H-coordinated *HCOOH species on O-terminated MXene, as illustrated in Fig. 20. The C- and H-coordination of the intermediates alternates throughout the reaction pathway, avoiding adsorption of intermediates during the reaction.159 Off late, using HCOOH as the primary carbon-based product, a peak faradaic efficiency of more than 56% on Ti2CTx and a partial current density of up to −2.5 mA cm2 on Mo2CTx have been achieved.161 Furthermore, both experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that increasing the number of F terminations on the MXenes can result in improved CRR performance.161 However, recent investigations of supporting platinum group metal (PGM) over bulk carbides162 and nitrides163 have demonstrated synergistic effects for the CRR. CRR experiments over MXenes have only demonstrated the two-electron mechanism for the generation of HCOOH, which is a limitation. The optimization of MXene surface terminations and the inclusion of supporting metals are required for improved intermediate stability to achieve larger CO2 reduction. Besides, numerous active sites could be required for the synthesis of C2+ products; as a result, the use of MXenes in conjunction with other CRR-active materials, such as Cu, should be investigated. It is also necessary to investigate the catalytic pathways of CO2 reduction on MXenes, particularly when utilizing in situ experimental approaches. Computational calculation, combined with experimental work in photocatalytic CO2 conversion,164,165 could allow the fabrication of efficient CRR electrocatalysts based on MXene faster.

8. Summary
The electrocatalytic comparison of MXenes and composite material catalysts suggests that MXenes are catalytically superior materials with/without single-atom catalyst sites. MXene-based materials provide superior capacity to establish strong contacts with various other components. MXene's efficiency could be improved upon incorporating metals as they have better charge carrier transport characteristics that inhibit the aggregation of active materials.166–170
The importance of active site density in understanding the catalytic activity for the ORR, OER, HER, NRR, and CRR has been overlooked for a long time. The neighborhood effects between nearby active sites have to be investigated in theoretical and experimental studies. The basis of theoretical research on heterogeneous catalysis is developing an appropriate catalyst model. DFT simulations, which are increasingly widely used, are useful for investigating active sites and their electronic structures and predicting reaction pathways. DFT calculations may provide somewhat likely trends, but quantitative predictions might suffer from substantial departures from experimental observations. Techniques at higher theoretical levels, such as wave function theory embedded in density functional theory (WFT-in-DFT), periodic MP2, periodic coupled cluster methods, and more realistic hydration models, are required to address the shortcomings.
Understanding the fundamental mechanism of the HOR is critical for designing high-performance HOR/HER catalysts. The HOR follows the Tafel–Volmer or Heyrovsky Volmer process in an acidic environment. H2 is absorbed on the catalysts' surface, resulting in H2 (Had). Had is then desorbed as a proton after the release of an electron. As a result, the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) characterizes the HOR activity.171,172 The various OH functions result in various catalyst design approaches. When OH is not adsorbed, the HOR activity is exclusively influenced by HBE, as it is in acid. On the other hand, a bifunctional catalyst with both H and OH adsorption sites is required to initiate the surface reaction. Recently, various metal catalysts were investigated and it was discovered that the metal with the highest OH adsorption is better for HOR activity.173 Recently, a series of transition metal (TM) SAs of 3d, 4d, and 5d TM, supported on 2D V2C with O termination (V2CO2), were investigated to expand the application of 2DMXene material related SAs into bi-functional materials, in particular for catalyzing the HOR/ORR on an alkaline polymer electrolyte fuel cell. Higher levels of HOR activity were observed in Sc–, Ti– and V–, Cr– and Mn–V2CO2. In addition, Mn– and Sc–V2CO2 may be attractive options for high catalytic activity, stability and low cost towards bifunctional HOR/ORR catalysis.174
Limited reports are available on the use of transition metal-based electrocatalysts towards the HOR, and utilization of MXenes is still in the developing phase.175–178 Since MXenes offer many potential advantages due to their synthetic tailoring according to specific applications, significant studies have been carried out pertaining to electrochemistry such as for the ORR, HER, OER, NRR, and CRR, although little emphasis is given to HOR. HOR applications using MXenes could offer a lot of scope in material design and structural modifications.
9. Conclusion and outlook
MXene catalysts are often more effective for electrochemical reactions with multiple transmission steps of protons/electrons such as the HER, ORR, OER, NRR, and CRR. We highlight and underline new developments in MXene catalysis-based energy conversion throughout this review, including the HER, the ORR, and its kinetics and prospects for new classes of catalysts.
This review also highlighted the most significant increase in product selectivity by stabilizing intermediates via cooperation with other active catalytic species. Additionally, most recent investigations into the connection between surface termination and catalytic performance, particularly in the case of electrocatalytic processes, have been evaluated. Additionally, for different electrocatalytic processes, the latest studies on DFT simulations have been mentioned to understand better the synergistic effects of MXenes and support metals or active components.
The recent research on the design of MXene and MXene-based nanocomposites for varied applications in electrocatalysis, such as the HER, ORR, OER, NRR, and CRR, is presented in this review. MXenes are a large family of 2D nanomaterials with remarkable properties and characteristics such as high metal conductivity, adjustable morphology, band gap, carrier anisotropic mobility, hydrophilicity, and large specific surface area with high mechanical and thermal stability, key aspects to inspire researchers for the rational design of MXene-based electrocatalysts. Advances have been made to modify the improved electrocatalytic properties of MXenes via boundary state, functional group and defect state control, single-atom loading, and heterojunction building. Additionally, enchanting is a key process for surface functional group modifications that can alter the intrinsic properties of MXenes and catalytic efficacy. So, more research is required in this area to get a better outcome from MXene as a catalyst without altering its inherent properties.
To address practical challenges, the following future research focuses are recommended in MXene-based materials to achieve high efficiency in electrocatalytic applications: a) covering the MXene surface with an oxidation-resistant layer to improve their stability, b) large-scale manufacturing with high reproducibility, c) investigating the boundary state, functional group and defect state, d) efficient single-atom loading and, e) impact and investigation of the 2D material confinement effect.
To investigate the electronic and structural characteristics of the supported catalysts under real electrocatalytic reaction circumstances, in situ methods should be used. The mechanisms of HER, ORR, and OER activity in 2D MXenes are elucidated using in situ XAS. The XANES study demonstrates that the electronic structures and changes in the oxidation states of the transition metals as a function of applied potentials affect the electrochemical characteristics and catalytic activity of the nitride MXenes.179
Numerous techniques need to be investigated for the structural changes and mechanism of action of designed MXenes, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and synchrotron radiation (SR)-based techniques.180
Other measurement methods can be developed to study the structure of materials in a variety of fields and the mechanisms underlying energy storage and conversion, including X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD), and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) (SXPS).181 Due to its short-range ordered sensitivity and element-specificity, XAFS excels in detecting the interaction between atoms and their surroundings in solid, liquid, and gas phases. Meanwhile, different testing techniques are appropriate for diverse objectives and material circumstances, including transmission XAFS for bulk materials, magnetic XAFS for spin research, and in situ XAFS for the dynamic mechanism study. As a result, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations are required to facilitate the rational design of MXene-based catalysts. Detailed experimental mechanistic studies are required to better understand the working principle of MXene as a catalyst. This could be accomplished via a high-throughput screening strategy for a given application.
