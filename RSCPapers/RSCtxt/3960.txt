    , Accepted 17th February 2018First published on 23rd February 2018AbstractOwing to its excellent electrocatalytic performance, zinc selenide (ZnSe) is regarded as a promising counter electrode (CE) material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this study, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-7) derived ZnSe nanocomposite is introduced as the electrocatalyst for the CE in a DSSC. First, ZIF-7 powder was subjected to carbonization and then transformed into ZIF-7/N-doped carbon (ZIF-NC). To further increase the electrocatalytic ability of the materials, ZIF-7-NC was selenized and transformed into a ZIF-7 derived ZnSe/N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC). After optimizing the weight percentage of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC film, the DSSCs with a CE of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% rendered a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of 8.69 ± 0.13%, which is higher than that of the cell with a Pt CE (8.26 ± 0.02%). This study concludes that the CE based on the ZIF-ZnSe-NC is a prospective substitute for Pt and could provide new opportunities for advancing high-efficiency DSSCs under in-house conditions with dim light illumination.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is considered to be a promising green energy source to replace traditional petroleum fuels since it is the most abundant energy resource on the Earth.1 Until now, innumerable scientists and engineers have been exploring various kinds of solar cells, such as silicon solar cells,2 organic solar cells,3 quantum dot solar cells,4,5 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1,6,7 perovskite solar cells,8 and so on, that can convert solar energy into electricity. Among these photovoltaic cells, DSSCs with the possible advantages of low manufacturing cost and a simple fabrication process have been attracting extensive attention since the pioneered work reported by the M. Grätzel group.6 The same group has recently reported a DSSC that achieves a very high photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 28.9% under ambient light conditions.9 Typical DSSCs are composed of three independent components, namely, a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film as the photoanode, an electrocatalytic material as the counter electrode (CE), and an electrolyte consisting of a redox couple. Among them, the function of the CE is to regenerate the I− ion so as to maintain the function of DSSCs. In other words, the development of an efficient CE with high electrocatalytic activities plays a crucial role in DSSCs.10,11 Pt, with its outstanding electrocatalytic ability and high conductivity, has been widely used as a CE in DSSCs for realizing a high photovoltaic conversion efficiency.12,13 So far, several alternatives, including carbonaceous materials,14–16 conducting polymers,17,18 and transition metal-containing materials,19,20 have been proposed to replace Pt since the high-cost issue of Pt still limits the development of DSSCs in industries.
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which consist of metallic clusters as the nodes and organic ligands as the linkers, have received rather widespread attention as a novel class of materials possessing a ultrahigh specific surface area, unique structural topology, and tunable functionalities that are useful for gas absorption,21–23 gas separation,24,25 catalysis,26,27 CO2 reduction,28 sensors,29 supercapacitors,30,31 and so on. Moreover, the highly ordered framework structure and high elemental composition of MOFs can be used as unique precursors or sacrificial templates for synthesizing various nanomaterials with novel characteristics. For example, Dai's group reported the utilization of MOFs as a template for synthesizing N, P, and S ternary-doped metal-free porous carbon materials, which were used as electrocatalysts for the ORR.32 Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), which are composed of tetrahedrally coordinated transition metal ions (Co, Cu, Zn, etc.) connected by imidazolate linkers, represent a class of MOFs that are topologically isomorphic with zeolites since the angle (∼145°) of the metal connected by imidazolate linkers is similar to that of zeolites. The electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic ability of ZIF-derived materials can be improved by a calcination process.33–35 The rich nitrogen-containing imidazolate ligands of ZIFs provide both carbon and nitrogen sources, thus making ZIFs an excellent candidate for synthesizing N-doped porous carbons through direct carbonization. In addition, compared to other N-doped carbons,36–38 carbonaceous materials derived from ZIFs can retain the advantages of porous structures of ZIFs. Moreover, a tunnel structure is crucial to the diffusion of electrolyte and its high specific surface area is beneficial to the catalytic reactions. ZIF derived materials have received tremendous attention in many aspects, such as gas absorption,39 oxygen reduction,40 and supercapacitors.41–44 Taking supercapacitors as an example, Salunkhe et al. used nanoporous carbon derived from ZIF-8 as the core for growing polyaniline nanorods, and the composites achieved high capacitance performance for supercapacitors.41 Kim et al. prepared a hybrid ZIF carbon from two ZIFs, having two different metal ions. The hybrid product possesses the advantages of both ZIF-8 (Zn2+) and ZIF-67 (Co2+), thus offering attractive properties for its application in supercapacitors.43
Nevertheless, only a few literature reports have mentioned about their application in the field of DSSCs.45–47 Sun et al. synthesized ZIF-8 derived carbon materials as a counter electrode (CE) of DSSCs owing to their large specific surface area and high electrocatalytic abilities towards the reduction of I3− ions; the DSSC with the ZIF-8 derived carbon material as the CE exhibits a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of 7.32%, which is comparable to that of the Pt CE (7.53%).45 Moreover, metallic compound decorated ZIF-derived materials can be synthesized spontaneously by a calcination process since the metallic nodes in the frameworks also serve as the metallic precursor. For instance, Jing et al. used ZIF-67 as a self-template in a facile pyrolysis synthesis of metal nanoparticles embodied in an N-doped porous graphitic carbon with surface-oxidized CoO. The performance of the DSSC with a ZIF-67-850 (pyrolyzed at 850 °C) CE shows an η of 7.92%, which is close to that of the Pt CE (8.18%).46 Cui et al. also used ZIF-67 derived CoS2 embedded carbon nanocages as a CE of DSSCs; the DSSC consisting of CoS2 embedded carbon nanocages achieves an η of 8.20%, which exceeds that of the Pt-based DSSC (7.88%).47
Recently, transition metal compounds, such as carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, selenides, and tellurides, have received a lot of attention due to their attractive advantages, e.g., low cost, excellent electrochemical activity, good conductivity, and good stability.19,48,49 According to our previous results, we found that among many transition metal compounds, transition metal selenides exhibit the best electrocatalytic ability as counter electrodes and thus provide the highest performance to the DSSCs.50 Lee et al. also reported that the DSSC with a MoSe2 CE shows an η of 9.00%, which is higher than that of the cell with a MoS2 CE (8.69%).51 Zhu et al. proposed a ZnSe–graphene (ZnSe–rGO) nanocomposite as the CE by using a facile hydrothermal method;52 the DSSC with the ZnSe–rGO CE shows an η of 6.61%, which is comparable to that of the Pt CE (6.23%). Inspired by our previous experience, a ZIF-7 derived ZnSe/N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC) hybrid electrocatalyst is proposed for the first time in this work as the CE in DSSCs. As shown in Scheme 1, the home-made ZIF-7 powder is first fabricated by an eco-friendly method using ethanol as the solvent. Then, carbonization and selenization at different temperatures for synthesizing a ZIF-7 derived N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-NC) and ZIF-7 derived ZnSe/N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC) were carried out step by step. In the ZIF-ZnSe-NC hybrid electrocatalyst, the N-doped carbon cube is beneficial to the electrocatalytic performance and the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, embedded ZnSe in the carbon matrix also serves as the additional active site for facilitating I3− reduction. After optimizing the weight percentage of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC film (∼11 wt%), the DSSCs with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% CE exhibits the best η of 8.69 ± 0.13%, which is higher than that of the cell with a Pt CE (8.26 ± 0.02%), showing high potential to replace the expensive Pt. The results of cyclic voltammetry, Koutecký–Levich plots, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel polarization plots provide substantial evidence to explain the higher η value of the cell with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC CE, which is attributed to its outstanding electrocatalytic ability for reducing I3−, thus minimizing the charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface. Table S1† summarizes the performance of the reported DSSCs using various ZIF-derived CEs and ZnSe CEs, as compared to that obtained in this work.

2. Experimental section

Benzimidazole (bIM, 99%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetical grade), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW ∼ 20000), and iodine (I2, synthetical grade) were received from Merck. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) aqueous solution (PEDOT:PSS, PH 500) was supplied by UniRegion Bio-Tech Co., Hsinchu, Taiwan. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (tBP, 96%) and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were procured from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was bought from Fluka. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), Surlyn® 13 (SX1170-25, 25 μm), transparent TiO2 paste (TL paste, Ti-nanoxide T/SP, with an average particle size of 20 nm), and cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye) were received from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28.0%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and nitric acid (HNO3, ca. 65% solution in water) were supplied by J. T. Baker. Commercial light scattering TiO2 particles, ST-41 (average particle size = 200 nm), were acquired from Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glasses (7 Ω sq−1, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm) were obtained from NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA.
2.2 Synthesis of ZIF-7-derived catalysts
The as-prepared ZIF-7 was annealed in a furnace with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1, maintained at a given temperature (600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C) for 1 h under a flow of N2, and afterwards cooled down to room temperature with a cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 to get a ZIF-7 derived N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-NC). Then, the carbonized sample was further selenized with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, maintained at a given temperature (300, 400, 450, 500, and 600 °C), holding for 30 min in N2, and then cooled down to room temperature with a cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 to get the ZIF-7 derived ZnSe/N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC).
2.3 Fabrication of the counter electrodes
In this work, the substrate of the photoanodes and CEs was fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). The FTO was sequentially cleaned with a neutral cleaner, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. In order to compare the performances of various electrocatalytic films, four types of films were prepared as follows: (1) a Pt film (30 nm-thick) was obtained on an FTO substrate by sputtering; (2) films of ZIF-NC with different carbonization temperatures (600–1000 °C) were prepared on a 1 cm2 controlled FTO substrate using a drop-coating technique with 50 μL of a PEDOT:PSS/EtOH solution mixture containing 5 wt% of the synthesized powders; (3) films of ZIF-ZnSe-NC with different selenization temperatures (300–600 °C) were prepared on the FTO using the same drop-coating technique and recipe as mentioned above; (4) films of ZIF-ZnSe-NC with different weight percentage concentrations of ZIF-ZnSe-NC (5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 wt%) were prepared on a 1 cm2 controlled FTO substrate using a drop-coating technique with 50 μL of the PEDOT:PSS/EtOH solution mixture containing various weight percentages of ZIF-ZnSe-NC.
2.4 Cell assembly
The TiO2 film in the photoanode consisted of a 100 nm compact layer, a 10 μm transparent layer, and a 4 μm scattering layer. The compact layer was coated on a cleaned FTO conducting surface via a spin-coating process using a mixture of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio = 1/3). A doctor-blade technique was used to obtain the transparent and scattering layers on the compact layer. The transparent layer was coated on the compact layer using the above-mentioned commercial transparent paste (Ti-nanoxide T/SP), while the scattering layer was further coated on the transparent layer using a home-made scattering paste. Each TiO2 layer was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in an air atmosphere, and then the sintered TiO2 film with an active area of 0.20 cm2 was immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M N719 dye solution for 24 h at room temperature using a mixed solvent of tBA and ACN (volume ratio = 1/1). Thus, a dye-adsorbed TiO2 film was prepared as the photoanode of a DSSC. Finally, a photoanode and a CE were assembled using a 25 μm-thick Surlyn® as the spacer. The electrolyte, which contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPII, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio = 1/1), was injected into the cell gap between these two electrodes.
The above-mentioned scattering paste was made in-house by a four-step process, as follows: (1) a TiO2 colloid was prepared by adding 0.5 M titanium tetraisopropoxide aqueous solution to 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution with stirring at 88 °C for 8 h. (2) The solution was cooled down to room temperature, transferred to an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA), slowly heated to 240 °C and maintained at this temperature for 12 h; the TiO2 nanoparticles reach an average diameter of 20 nm at this stage. (3) The autoclaved TiO2 colloid was concentrated to contain 8 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles. (4) The scattering layer paste (SL paste) was acquired by the addition of 25 wt% PEG and 100 wt% of commercial scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41) (both with respect to the weight of TiO2) to the concentrated TiO2 colloid. Here, PEG was used for preventing the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles and for controlling the pore size among the TiO2 nanoparticles. The scattering layer is required for light scattering to increase the utilization of light by the dye.
2.5 Analyses
The surface morphology of different CEs was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA), equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS, model 7021-H, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). The surface chemical analysis of a CE was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Theta Probe, East Grinstead, UK). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZIF-7, ZIF-NC and ZIF-ZnSe-NC powders were obtained by using an X-ray diffractometer (X-Pert, the Netherlands). The photovoltaic parameters and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with different CEs were recorded by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands). The cell conversion efficiency of a DSSC was obtained under a light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated with a standard Si cell, PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), using a class A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The IPCE curves of the DSSCs were obtained in the wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm using another class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The incident radiation flux (φ) was recorded using an optical detector (model 818-SL, Newport, California, USA) and a power meter (model 1916-R, Newport, California, USA). The sheet resistance (Rsh, related to the electrical conductivity) was measured using a four-point probe (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., Beaverton, Oregon, USA). The decomposition temperature was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (Pyris 1, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The Raman spectra were analyzed using a Dimension Raman System (Lambaba Solution, Inc.; P2 type, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). N2 adsorption–desorption was measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics, Norcross, Georgia, USA).
The electrocatalytic properties of the films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) analyses. In the case of CV analysis, the data were obtained from the same potentiostat/galvanostat mentioned above using a three-electrode electrochemical system, consisting of an electrocatalytic film (1 cm2), a Pt foil, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode that were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte for the CV analysis contained 1.0 mM I2, 10.0 mM LiI, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN, performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. In the case of RDE analysis, the data were recorded using a potentiostat (model 900B, CHI Instruments) equipped with a modulated speed rotator (MSR, PINE Instrument Company, Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) in an ACN solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 1.0 mM TBAI3. An electrocatalytic film was coated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE, Part #AFE7R9GCGC, PINE Instrument Company) as the working electrode; another electrode with Pt as the disk material (Pt-RDE, working area: 0.196 cm2, Part #AFE2M050PT, PINE Instrument Company) was also used as the working electrode for estimating the parameters related to the Pt electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the CE and reference electrode (RE), respectively. The rotating speeds were controlled at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 rpm, using a scan rate of 2 mV s−1.
The electrochemical properties of the electrocatalytic films were also studied using Tafel polarization plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For both measurements, the data were recorded using the same potentiostat/galvanostat mentioned above, with a FRA2 module, by using a symmetric cell consisting of the same films on both the anode and cathode; the electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1/1). A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used for Tafel analysis. The EIS analysis was performed under open-circuit conditions, between 10 mHz and 65 kHz, with an AC amplitude of ±10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the as-synthesized ZIF-7
ZIF-7 is composed of a zinc cluster connected by a benzimidazolate (bIM) ligand in a sodalite (SOD) topology, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the as-synthesized ZIF-7, which consists of uniform micrometer-sized spherical crystals composed of smaller irregular particles. The as-synthesized ZIF-7 particles do not possess well-defined crystal faces compared with those prepared in DMF,53 which is presumably due to rapid deprotonation of organic ligands in ethanol/ammonium hydroxide solution, and resulted in anisotropic crystal growth.54Fig. 1c shows the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized ZIF-7; the peaks are highly consistent with the reported XRD pattern of simulated ZIF-7.55 The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of ZIF-7 is shown in Fig. 1d. As expected, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of ZIF-7 is only 5.14 m2 g−1. This phenomenon has been observed previously,54,56 suggesting that the pore sizes of ZIF-7 are so small that N2 could not enter the window of ZIF-7 and it is only adsorbed on the external surface.

3.2 Characterization of carbonized ZIF-7 at various calcination temperatures
To understand the carbonization effect of ZIF-7, ZIF-7 with various calcination temperatures was studied at the beginning.

Fig. 2a shows the TGA curve of the ZIF-7 sample. The mass loss in the temperature range of 200–400 °C is attributed to the evaporation of solvents remaining in the pores of ZIF-7. Then, there is a weight-loss step corresponding to the decomposition of the framework at ∼650 °C. The colors of the powder at different calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C) are shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The color of the ZIF-NC powder carbonized at 600 °C is khaki, which is different from the colors of other temperatures, suggesting that it is not sufficiently being carbonized. Raman spectroscopy was performed to investigate the degree of graphitization of the ZIF-NC further. As shown in Fig. 2b, two peaks detected at 1346 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 were related to D and G bands of the carbon, respectively. The D band is due to out of plane vibrations attributed to the presence of structural defects, while the G band is a result of the in-plane vibrations of sp2 bonded carbon atoms. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) is related to the number of structurally ordered graphite crystallites in the carbonaceous materials. No noticeable peak of ZIF-NC-600 °C can be obtained, once again confirming that it had not been adequately carbonized yet. The ID/IG ratio of the ZIF-NC gradually decreased from 1.099 to 1.024 with the calcination temperatures increasing from 700 to 1000 °C, which indicates that some carbonaceous disorders were converted into ordered graphite crystallites while increasing the temperature. Higher temperatures will enhance the degree of graphitization but reduce oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the as-prepared carbonaceous materials, thus accordingly influencing the electrocatalytic performance.45,57

The sheet resistances (Rsh), related to the electrical conductivities, of different ZIF-NC films (with an average thickness of 20 μm) were measured by a four-point probe method, as shown in Fig. 2c. The data are listed in Table 1. The Rsh values decrease with increasing the temperature, showing that a higher calcination temperature would enhance the electrical conductivity of the ZIF-NC. On the other hand, to confirm the characteristics of N-doped carbon in the ZIF-NC, the XPS spectra of C 1s orbitals and N 1s orbitals of ZIF-NC-900 °C are shown in Fig. 2d. The C 1s spectrum can be divided into two peaks. The peak at 284.75 eV is assigned to C–C, while the peak at 285.5 eV is attributed to CN. The N 1s spectrum can also be divided into three peaks. The peak at 398.8 eV is related to pyridinic nitrogen, referring to an sp2-nitrogen bonded to two carbon atoms. The peak at 400.9 eV is assigned to graphitic nitrogen. There is a lower peak at 400.5 eV, which is attributed to pyrrolic nitrogen. From these results, it can be deduced that the ZIF-NC-900 °C was comprised of pyridinic nitrogen (45.0%) and graphitic nitrogen (49.6%). These two types of nitrogen would form active sites for promoting the triiodide reduction reaction and could reduce the redox potential.58 Moreover, the BET surface area of ZIF-NC-900 °C is 65.89 m2 g−1 (Fig. S1a†), which is higher than that of ZIF-7 since the pore sizes of carbonized ZIF-7 are larger for N2 penetrating into the structure.30 The XRD pattern of ZIF-NC-900 °C (Fig. S1b†) also displays two broad peaks at around 22 and 43°, suggesting the amorphous structure of the carbon.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with the ZIF-NC CEs treated at various carbonization temperatures (600–1000 °C). The pertinent photovoltaic parameters with standard deviations are listed in Table 1. After optimizing the carbonization temperature of the ZIF-NC, the cell with the ZIF-NC-900 °C composite film exhibits the best photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of 6.02 ± 0.03% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.74 ± 0.00 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.27 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.66 ± 0.01 (Table 1). Although ZIF-NC-1000 °C with higher graphitization shows the lowest values of ID/IG and Rsh, the performance of the DSSC using ZIF-NC-1000 °C is affected by the collapse of the ZIF-NC polyhedron. As clearly shown in Fig. 3b, the morphology of the as-prepared carbonaceous material is consistent with the original structure of ZIF-7 when the calcination temperature is lower than 1000 °C. However, the morphology structure of the ZIF-NC is crumbled and the original morphology could not be preserved once the temperature is raised to 1000 °C, thus significantly influencing the DSSC performance. With the higher calcination temperature, the electrical conductivity of the materials would increase (Table 2) as the morphology of the ZIF-7-NC may collapse (Fig. 3b). According to the above results, a carbonization temperature of 900 °C was selected as the best condition for carbonizing the ZIF-7.

3.3 Characterization of the selenized ZIF-NC at various calcination temperatures
To further improve the electrocatalytic activities of the ZIF-NC by increasing the additional active sites, the carbonized ZIF-7 with optimized calcination temperature, namely ZIF-NC-900 °C, was further selenized at different temperatures (300–600 °C). In the XPS survey scan of the ZIF-NC before and after selenization at 450 °C (Fig. 4a), it is apparent that the peak of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC at 178.7 eV can be assigned to the Auger electron of selenium, and the peak of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC at around 54 eV can be attributed to the Se–Zn chemical bonds of crystalline ZnSe. As shown in the Se 3d spectrum of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC (Fig. 4a), there are two split peaks at 54.1 and 54.7 eV for Se 3d3/2 and Se 3d5/2 respectively, confirming the existence of a Se–Zn bond attributed to the ZnSe formation. Fig. 4a presents the XRD patterns of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC selenized at different temperatures, and there are three peaks at 27.3°, 45.3°, and 53.6°, belonging to the cubic phase of ZnSe (JCPDS, card no. 1-690). The XRD pattern demonstrates that the ZIF-ZnSe-NC was successfully synthesized from the ZIF-7-NC at various selenization temperatures. For further identifying the percentage of ZnSe under various conditions of the as-prepared samples, the EDS analysis of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC at different selenization temperatures was performed, as presented in Fig. 4c. The EDS result shows that the weight percentage of selenium could reach the highest value at 450 °C, implying that ZIF-ZnSe-NC-450 °C has much more electrocatalytic active sites of ZnSe to facilitate the reduction of I3−. However, the weight percentage of selenium decreases as the selenization temperature is increased from 450 to 600 °C, suggesting that the selenium pellets may sublimate too fast to form crystalline ZnSe in the structure of the ZIF-derived material. Fig. 4d shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC CEs prepared at different selenization temperatures. The pertinent photovoltaic parameters with standard deviations are also listed in Table 2. After optimizing the selenization temperatures of the ZIF-NC, the cell with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-450 °C composite film exhibits the best η of 7.11 ± 0.04% with a VOC of 0.76 ± 0.00 V, a JSC of 13.60 ± 0.19 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.69 ± 0.01, corresponding to the presence of the highest amount of ZnSe (22.55 wt%). With the increase of the selenization temperature from 450 °C up to 600 °C, the DSSC performance decreased due to the less weight percentage of ZnSe in the ZIF-ZnSe-NC for forming the electrocatalytically active sites. Overall, a selenization temperature of 450 °C was selected as the best condition for selenizing the ZIF-NC.

3.4 Electrochemical analyses of ZIF-7 and ZIF-derived materials
For making the main purpose of each process clear, Scheme 1 shows the schematic process of the synthesis of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC. First of all, the precursor of ZIF-7 was subjected to carbonization to form a ZIF-7 derived N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-NC); carbonization could enhance the electrical conductivity while the graphitic N and pyridinic N would form electroactive sites for promoting the I3− reduction reaction. Secondly, the ZIF-NC was subjected to selenization to form a ZIF-7 derived ZnSe modified N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC); selenization could improve the electrocatalytic ability of the materials as both N-doped carbon materials and ZnSe could facilitate the reduction of I3−. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CEs of ZIF-7, the ZIF-NC, and the ZIF-ZnSe-NC. The pertinent photovoltaic parameters with standard deviations are listed in Table S2,† in which the cell with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC composite film exhibits the best performance among the CEs due to its enhanced electrocatalytic ability. To better understand the intrinsic parameters of each electrocatalyst sample, rotating disk electrode (RDE) analysis was applied to determine the two important indexes, namely, the intrinsic heterogeneous rate constant (k0) and the effective electrocatalytic surface area (Ae).
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CEs of ZIF-7, the ZIF-NC, and the ZIF-ZnSe-NC; (b) K–L plots for ZIF-7, ZIF-NC, and ZIF-ZnSe-NC composite electrodes. 
These properties largely influence the overall electrocatalytic activity of an electrode. At the formal potential (E0′) of the I−/I3−, various values of reciprocal current (i−1) can be obtained from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for a specific electrode at various rotating speeds (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 rpm). Thus, plots of reciprocal current (i−1) vs. reciprocal of the square root of the rotating speed (ω−0.5) were obtained for ZIF-7, ZIF-NC, and ZIF-ZnSe-NC composite electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5b. The intercept and slope of a fitting line in Fig. 5c are respectively used to find the k0 and Ae values, using the following simplified Koutecký–Levich (K–L) eqn (1),59 (1)where i is the disk current obtained at the formal potential (E0′) of I−/I3−, n is the number of electrons transferred for I3− reduction, F is the Faraday constant, C is the bulk concentration of I3− (1.0 mM), D is the diffusion coefficient of I3− (3.62 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of ACN, and ω is the angular velocity converted from the rotating speed. Compared to the pristine ZIF-7 (k0 = 9.4 × 10−4 cm s−1), the value of k0 increases gradually while ZIF-7 was carbonized (k0 = 1.30 × 10−3 cm s−1) and further selenized (k0 = 3.42 × 10−3 cm s−1), indicating that both carbonization and selenization processes can enhance the electrocatalytic ability of ZIF-7 derived materials. On the other hand, the value of Ae for ZIF-7 (Ae = 0.405 cm2) slightly decreases under carbonization (Ae = 0.358 cm2) but increases dramatically upon further selenization (Ae = 0.805 cm2), suggesting that the polyhedral structure of ZIF-7 may shrink after annealing due to the decomposition of organic linkers at high carbonization temperature, while an additional electroactive site of ZnSe was created via selenization, thus increasing the Ae for catalyzing the I3− reduction. As summarized in Table 3, the ZIF-ZnSe-NC film shows a high k0 value of 3.42 × 10−3 cm s−1 and a high Ae value of 0.805 cm2; this reveals that the ZIF-ZnSe-NC film possesses excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and highly sufficient surface area for facilitating the reduction of I3−.

3.5 Optimization of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC weight percentage for a highly efficient counter electrode
To optimize the weight percentage of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC for preparing the highly efficient CE in DSSCs, ZIF-ZnSe-NC films with various weight percentages in the PEDOT:PSS matrix were studied in the following. In this work, PEDOT:PSS not only served as the linker to enhance the connection of each ZIF-ZnSe-NC, but also acted as the binder to enhance the adhesion between the corresponding film and the conductive substrate60 and among the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles. The FE-SEM images of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC films with different weight percentages of ZIF-ZnSe-NC (5–13 wt%) reveal that PEDOT:PSS uniformly covered the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles, suggesting that it is beneficial for the charge transfer. In all of the composite films, it was found that the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles were well connected with each other by the PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer. The SEM images of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC films (5–9 wt%) show that a lower weight percentage of ZIF-ZnSe-NC films having abundant PEDOT:PSS covered the surface of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles; this suggests that the active site on the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles may be blocked. In the case of high loading of ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles (13 wt%), PEDOT:PSS may not provide sufficient connection among ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles. In addition, it may suffer from poor adhesion between the composite film and the substrate.
To compare the performance of ZIF-ZnSe-NC films with various weight percentages, Fig. 6b shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the corresponding CE films. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters with standard deviation data are summarized in Table S3.† After optimizing the weight percentage concentration of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC, the cell with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% composite film exhibits an attractive photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 8.69 ± 0.13%, as shown in Fig. 6c. Although the DSSC with a CE of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-13 wt% composite film has a relatively higher number of electrocatalytically active sites and shows a higher JSC value of 16.78 ± 0.09 mA cm−2, lower VOC (0.75 ± 0.00 V) and lower FF (0.63 ± 0.01), its cell efficiency (7.91 ± 0.05%) is limited by the insufficient coverage of PEDOT:PSS.61 It is concluded that a CE film of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% gives the best performance and simultaneously provides both a proper charge transfer route and good electrocatalytic ability. The EDS spectrum indicates the existence of C, N, Zn, Se, and S in the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% film (Fig. S2a†). Besides, the EDS elemental mapping images of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% film (Fig. S2b†) show a homogeneous distribution of C, N, Zn, and Se in the ZIF-ZnSe-NC particles. The element S, which is derived from PEDOT:PSS, is well dispersed in the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% film.

3.6 Comparison of DSSCs with CEs of commercial Pt and the optimized ZIF-ZnSe-NC

Fig. 7a shows the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt; the inset spectra show the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), which is defined as the ratio of the electrons produced by the external circuit to the incident photons at the wavelength of 400–800 nm under short-circuit conditions. The cell with the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% composite CE film exhibits the best η of 8.69 ± 0.13%, which is higher than that of the cell with a Pt CE (8.26 ± 0.02%). The theoretical short-circuit current density (JSC-IPCE) values of the cell calculated based on the IPCE with ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% (13.34 mA cm−2) is higher than that of the cell with a Pt CE (12.40 mA cm−2). This is because the pristine ZIF-ZnSe-NC particle provides a larger electrocatalytic surface area for its composite film for I3− reduction, and thereby, enables a higher electrocatalytic activity for its CE.
 Fig. 7  (a) J–V curves of the DSSCs with the CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt (inset: IPCE curves of the corresponding devices); (b) CV curves, (c) K–L plots, and (d) EIS spectra (inset: Tafel polarization plots) of the electrodes with ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to explore the redox kinetics of I−/I3− at the surfaces of different electrocatalytic films, and the electrocatalytic film of a CE facilitates the reduction of I3− at its surface with the electrolyte, as shown using eqn (2)20 I3− + 2e− → 3I−(2)
The CV curves of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt CEs are shown in Fig. 7b. The net peak current density from the cathodic peak current to the background curve is defined as the cathodic peak current density (Jpc). The Jpc value of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% (Jpc = 0.91 mA cm−2) is higher than that of Pt (Jpc = 0.85 mA cm−2), once again confirming its overall electrocatalytic ability for I3− reduction. As shown in the K–L plot (Fig. 7c), the Pt film shows a higher k0 value (5.57 × 10−3 cm s−1) and a lower Ae value (0.105 cm2) (Table 3); this reveals that the flat Pt film possesses an excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity with a limited active surface area.
The ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% film offers a much larger value of Ae (0.805 cm2) despite its slightly lower value of k0 (3.42 × 10−3 cm s−1); overall, the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% CE film still possesses good intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and a high surface area for facilitating the reduction of I3−.
To investigate the charge transfer properties at the CE/electrolyte interface, Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted in the same electrolyte using symmetric cells composed of the same film on both the anode and cathode, individually consisting of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt films. Fig. 7d represents the EIS spectra of such symmetric cells with ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt. Based on the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 7d, the series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) were obtained; these were evaluated from the onset point and the radius of the first semicircle, respectively. A lower Rs reflects a better ohmic contact between the substrate and the electrocatalytic film; a smaller Rct value refers to a more substantial number of electrons transferring through the CE/electrolyte interface, thereby indicating a faster electron transfer capability of the film. As summarized in Table 3, the Rs values and the Rct values show a trend of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% < Pt. The Tafel polarization curves of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt are shown in the inset of Fig. 7d. The value of the exchange current density (J0) of a film is obtained from the intercept (at V = 0) of the extrapolating lines of both anodic and cathodic curves in the Tafel zone (120 mV < |V| < 400 mV).62 A higher value of J0 represents a better electrocatalytic ability of a film; the values of J0 show a trend of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% > Pt, which is in good agreement with the trend of Jpc. The electrocatalytic ability of an electrode is validated not only by CV and RDE analyses, but also by Tafel and EIS analyses. After the above analyses, we conclude that ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% exhibits the best electrocatalytic ability for I3− reduction, thus showing high potential for replacing the expensive Pt in a DSSC.
Furthermore, it was also worth mentioning that the DSSC still exhibited good conversion efficiency under dim light conditions.9 The J–V curves of the DSSCs based on the CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% and Pt were obtained at various light intensities in the range of 10–100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 8. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters with standard deviation data are summarized in Table S4.† The DSSCs with CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% were illuminated under the dim light condition of 50 mW cm−2, and the efficiency (η = 8.02 ± 0.01%) did not decay too much and almost maintained 92% of the efficiency under 1 sun condition of 100 mW cm−2 (η = 8.69 ± 0.13%). Even in the case of 10 mW cm−2 illumination, a reasonable efficiency of 7.99 ± 0.01% was still obtained for the DSSCs with CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt%. In contrast, the η of the DSSCs with CEs of Pt went from 8.26 ± 0.02 and 7.87 ± 0.05 to 7.41 ± 0.02% under illuminations at 100, 50, and 10 mW cm−2, respectively.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a zinc selenide decorated N-doped carbonaceous hybrid material (ZIF-ZnSe-NC) derived from a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-7) was successfully synthesized and firstly introduced as the electrocatalyst for the CE in DSSCs. ZIF-7 powder was subjected to carbonization to form a ZIF-7 derived N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-NC), followed by further selenization to transform it into a ZIF-7 derived ZnSe/N-doped carbon cube (ZIF-ZnSe-NC). Raman spectra, four-point probe analysis, and SEM images showed that with the higher carbonization temperature, the electrical conductivity of the materials would increase, while the morphology of the ZIF-NC may collapse. XRD and XPS analyses revealed that the annealed ZIF-ZnSe-NC composite material is composed of crystalline ZnSe and N-doped amorphous carbon. The better electrocatalytic ability of the ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% film, as compared to that of Pt, is validated by CV, RDE, Tafel and EIS analyses. The DSSCs with ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% CEs exhibited a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) of 8.69 ± 0.13%, which is higher than that of the cells with Pt CEs (8.26 ± 0.02%). A reasonable cell efficiency of 7.99 ± 0.01% was still attained for the DSSCs with CEs of ZIF-ZnSe-NC-11 wt% at a dim light intensity of 10 mW cm−2. Thus, it could be concluded that the ZIF-ZnSe-NC is a promising material to replace the expensive Pt in DSSCs, especially for the indoor application. In fact, the key concept of this work is to propose a new strategy for the application of ZIFs as precursors in the field of photovoltaic devices. Based on the results obtained from this work, more attractive materials can be synthesized through different chemical modifications (including nitridation, sulfuration, etc.) using a variety of MOF-derived precursors. Therefore, more eco-friendly materials for the use in DSSCs with high photovoltaic performance can be expected in the future.
