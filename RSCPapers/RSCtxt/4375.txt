    , Accepted 9th January 2023First published on 9th January 2023AbstractIn the current work, TiO2 nanoarchitectures with high surface area and charge density have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and further modified via co-doping with a transition metal (nickel) and rare-earth metals (europium, cerium, and holmium). Different characterization tools (i.e., XRD, BET surface area, FTIR, Raman, PL, SEM, TEM, XAS, XPS, and DRS) have been used to check the effect of co-doping on the electrical, morphological, and structural properties of the TiO2 nanoarchitectures. The FTIR, Raman, and XRD results confirmed the successful co-doping of the TiO2 nanoarchitectures. The high surface area of the co-doped nanoarchitectures as compared to undoped and singly doped TiO2 was confirmed from BET measurements. The presence of dopants in various oxidation states was further elucidated via XPS and XAS studies. FE-SEM and TEM revealed the formation of interconnected, mesoporous-type nanoarchitectures, with particle sizes less than 100 nm. The supercapacitive behavior of synthesized nanoarchitectures was evaluated by performing cyclic voltammetry, linear scan voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance measurements. The specific capacitance values (Csp) indicate that the co-doping of rare-earth metals into the TiO2 structure results in enhanced capacitance of the target materials. The highest capacitive behavior was observed in the Ni-Ho-3 sample (740 F g−1), followed by Ni-Eu-3 (630 F g−1), Ni-Ce-3 (552 F g−1), and Ni-5 (545 F g−1), as compared to that of pure TiO2 (240 F g−1). Furthermore, the Ni-Ho-3 electrode also showed better cyclic stability with 97% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1. The water oxidation studies also showed that all the doped TiO2 nano-catalysts show enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The OER overpotential values at 10 mA cm−2 for Ni-Eu-3, Ni-5, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3 are 520, 550, 600, and 620 mV, respectively. The Tafel slopes of undoped TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3 are measured to be 151, 143, 134, 141, and 137 mV dec−1, respectively. The smallest Tafel slope of Ni-Eu-3 indicated its highest OER efficiency among all the selected samples. As compared with the other samples, Ni-Ho-3 sample also showed a lower value for the Tafel slope. The superior performance of co-doped nanoarchitectures was credited to the development of mesoporous structures with more electroactive sites, high charge density, and better charge transfer (EIS results).
1. Introduction
One of the major and serious issues that the world is facing today is energy.1–4 Electrochemical water splitting and supercapacitors (SCs)1,2 are more viable, inexpensive, and stable approaches to generate energy.5,6 Supercapacitors are a way to get the energy in short pulses as compared to the secondary batteries and can be applied as a power source in multiple devices.3,4 In supercapacitors, two different charge storage mechanisms have been utilized: one is a carbon-based electric material in which electric charge is stored at an electrode–electrolyte interface (EDLCs), and other is transition metal oxides and a conducting polymer, in which capacitance arises due to the reversible faradaic reaction at the electrode–electrolyte interface (ECs).4,5 Recently, researchers have focused on developing low-cost and highly stable electrode materials for charge storage in supercapacitors. Moreover, the highest efficiency in the water oxidation process is obtained with noble metal catalysts. However, they are highly expensive, which hampers the effectiveness of the water oxidation process. Thus, the design of a nanomaterial with unique optoelectronic properties to solve the energy problem is required.
TiO2 nanoparticles have unique optoelectronic properties.6–8 Due to these properties, they have been extensively applied in different areas, such as photovoltaics, batteries, hydrogen production and storage, and supercapacitors. Currently, the active research on TiO2 is related to its use as electrode material in supercapacitors.9–12 TiO2 is a stable, non-toxic, high-charge-density, and low-cost material, making it a favorable candidate for electrocatalytic and supercapacitor applications.13–17
Nanocrystalline TiO2 exists in different polymorphic crystalline forms: rutile, anatase, and brookite, which have different lattice structures.18,19 The most thermodynamically stable form among these is the rutile phase. However, the other two forms are also converted into the rutile phase via heating at 400 °C to 1200 °C. The stability of the TiO2 phase is also dependent on the crystallite size, as reported in the literature.20 It has been reported that if the anatase phase has a crystallite size of less than 35 nm, it will be more thermodynamically stable.20 Depending on the crystal structure, the band gap of TiO2 varies from 3.0 eV to 3.3 eV.21 Due to its wide band gap, TiO2 nanomaterials show low electric conductivity.22–26 Pure TiO2 nanomaterials have also shown low charge density even though they possess n-type conductivity.17
The conductivity and charge density of TiO2 nanomaterials has been improved by several reported methods. The widely used methods are surface modification,27 doping with metals and non-metals,24,28–30 creation of oxygen vacancies,31 and development with other semiconductors.32,33 Different metals that have been used to modify the optoelectronic properties of TiO2 include nickel (Ni),29,30 copper,34,35 zinc,34,35 iron (Fe),36,37 silver (Ag),34,38 and rare earth metals.29,30,39–47 Due to its non-toxicity, abundance, and cost-effectiveness, Ni is the most-used dopant for TiO2.48–58
Other metal ions that have been successfully incorporated into the TiO2 lattice include trivalent rare earth (RE) metal ions.8,59–62 RE metal ions possess unique spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Doping with these metal ions results in modification of the optoelectronic properties of TiO2.8,29,30,46,47,59–62 RE-metal-ion-doped TiO2 has been applied in several optoelectronic and electrochemical applications.8,59–64 Among the RE metal ions, Eu3+,65 Ce3+,66,67 and Ho3+68 are excellent candidates for TiO2 doping due to their superb optoelectronic properties.
Nowadays, TiO2 nanostructures containing two or more codoped metals or nonmetals have been reported in many electrochemical applications.58,59,69 Because of the synergistic effect of the co-doped elements, the TiO2 nanostructures showed better optoelectronic and electrochemical properties compared with singly doped or pure TiO2.70–72
In this context, a series of nanoparticles co-doped with Ni and RE metal ions (Ce, Ho, and Eu) have been synthesized by facile and environmentally friendly methods. The impact of doping with the Ni and RE metal ions has been explored using different characterization techniques. The electrochemical behavior of the prepared nanoparticles were described and analyzed under various conditions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The chemicals used in the current study were purchased from different suppliers, i.e., TiO2 (P25 >95%) from Sigma Aldrich, Ni(II) nitrate hexahydrate, 99.999% from Sigma Aldrich, Eu(III) nitrate hydrate 99.99% from Merck, Ce(III) nitrate hexahydrate, 99.99% from Merck, Ho(III) nitrate hexahydrate, 99.99% from Sigma Aldrich, Sodium hydroxide >98% from Sigma Aldrich, and hydrochloric acid, 36.6–38% from Alfa-Assar.
2.2. Synthesis of Ni/RE (Ce, Ho, Eu) co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
The TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared using a hydrothermal method.36,73,74 Briefly, 1 gram of TiO2 P25 was stirred in 25 mL of 9 M NaOH solution for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the solution was heated in a Teflon autoclave in an oven at 120 °C for 24 hours, followed by centrifugation to remove excess solvent. The washing of nanoparticles was carried out with DI water and 0.1 M HCl solution until the pH of the filtrate became neutral. Furthermore, the obtained nanoparticles were calcined at 400 °C. A schematic representation of the synthesized nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the synthesis of doped and un-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. 
The Ni/RE metal co-doped nanoarchitecture was prepared using the same procedure with the addition of pre-measured quantities of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Ho(NO3)3·6H2O (0–5%) along with NaOH and TiO2 P25 during the first step. The classification of the prepared samples is shown in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†).
An X-Ray diffractometer (Panalytical X-Ray Powder Diffractometer, Model 3040/60-X-Pert Pro) was used to determine the crystal structure of nanoparticles. The particle sizes were calculated using the Scherrer equation as follows: (1)
The Langmuir and BET measurements were carried out using a KELVIN 1042 (COSTECH instrument, international Italy). The microstructure analysis was carried out using FE-SEM (TESCAN, Czech Republic) and TEM (JEOL TEM 2010 and 2100F) analysis. The FTIR analysis was carried out by mixing 0.1% of the sample with 200 mg of KBr powder. The spectra were recorded using a Varian 640-IR FT-IR spectrometer (Germany). The band gaps of the materials were measured using a PerkinElmer Scan Lambda 35 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Switzerland). The Raman analysis was conducted using a Horiba iHR320 Raman Spectrometer (Japan) using a CCD detector at 632 nm excitation wavelength. The photoluminescence properties of samples were measured using an FT-300 spectrometer (PicoQuant, Germany). The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were measured using the XAFS/XRF beamline, Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME).
2.3. Electrochemical studies of the OER and HER
The HER and OER testing of all samples was carried out using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. First, 0.5 g of the synthesized sample was mixed with an appropriate quantity of absolute ethanol (C2H5OH) and Nafion (C7HF13O5S·C2F4) to form an ink. The working electrode was prepared by coating the ink onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with an active area of 0.5 cm2, followed by heating at 400 °C for 1 hour. In the current study, the reference electrode used was Ag/AgCl, while a platinum wire was used as a counter electrode.
The calculations were performed using the Nernst equation given below: (2)Here,  = standard electrode potential of Ag/AgCl, ERHE = converted potential vs. Ag/AgCl, and EAg/AgCl = experimentally measured potential.
2.4. Electrochemical testing for supercapacitor application
The electrochemical characterization of the fabricated pure, Ni-doped, and co-doped TiO2 nanostructures was conducted in a typical three-electrode configuration in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a Gamry 1010 electrochemical workstation. The working electrode was constructed by pasting the slurry through drop-casting on pre-activated nickel foam (NiF); Ag/AgCl and Pt foil were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The slurry for the working electrode was prepared by mixing the active material, acetylene black and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogenous dispersion and finally drop-cast on NiF (1 × 1 cm2). The resultant electrode was dried in a vacuum for 6 h at 60 °C. The electrochemical performance of these fabricated electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) within the potential range of −0.2 to +0.6 V and scan rates from 10–100 mV s−1. The specific capacitance (Csp) was studied using galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) in the potential range of 0–0.4 V at different current density ranges from 2–10 A g−1, and the cyclic stability was studied at a higher current density of 5 A g−1 for 1000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles. The Csp value and capacity retention were computed from the GCD profile using eqn (3).75 (3)here, I = response current in amperes, m = mass of material used to make the electrode, Δt = discharge time in seconds, Csp = specific capacitance in F g−1, and ΔV = potential window in volts.76 EIS measurements were made within the frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of nanoparticles
The crystal structure of the prepared nanocatalysts was analyzed using the XRD technique, as presented in Fig. 2(a)–(c). The diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 25.5, 37.6, 47.8, and 55 correspond to the (101), (004), (200), and (105) diffractions. The appearance of a peak at 25.3° indicated the presence of the dominant anatase phase of TiO2. Furthermore, it is seen that the peak position remains the same after the addition of dopants. This means that the TiO2 phase is not affected by the presence of dopants.77 XRD results indicated the exchange of Ti4+ ions for Ni2+ ions due to their similar ionic radii. The rare earth metal ions (Ho3+, Ce3+, and Eu3+) are likely to be present as oxides at interstitial sites due to their large ionic radii.77 However, the absence of peaks corresponding to rare earth metal oxides in the XRD pattern is due to their low doping concentration.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of pure and doped TiO2. (a) TiO2 with Ni and Ce (Ni-5 = 5% Ni, Ni-Ce-1 = 5% Ni and 1% Ce, Ni-Ce-3 = 5% Ni and 3% Ce, Ni-Ce-5 = 5% Ni and 5% Ce, Ce-5 = 5% Ce). (b) TiO2 with Ni and Ho (Ni-5 = 5% Ni, Ni-Ho-1 = 5% Ni and 1% Ho, Ni-Ho-3 = 5% Ni and 3% Ho, Ni-Ho-5 = 5% Ni and 5% Ho, Ho-5 = 5% Ho). (c) TiO2 with Ni and Eu (Ni-5 = 5% Ni, Ni-Eu-1 = 5% Ni and 1% Eu, Ni-Eu-3 = 5% Ni and 3% Eu, Ni-Eu-5 = 5% Ni and 5% Eu, Eu-5 = 5% Eu). 
Tables S1–S3 (ESI†) present the calculated crystallite sizes of all samples. For undoped TiO2, the calculated crystallite size is in the range of 18.0–20.0 nm. Upon the addition of Ni, the crystallite sizes increase to 37.0 nm, which might be due to the development of NiTiO3 in the samples.78
In the co-doped samples, the crystallite sizes vary depending on the nature of the dopants. For cerium co-doped TiO2, the particle sizes are 19.8, 10.2, and 32.3 nm for 1, 3, and 5% Ce concentrations. For europium co-doped TiO2, the calculated sizes are 16.6, 10.5, and 46.1 for 1, 3, and 5% Eu concentrations. Furthermore, sizes of 22.4, 16.6, and 26.3 were calculated for 1, 3, and 5% Ho doping. The calculated data for the co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles showed reductions in size. Samples containing 5% Ni and 3% Ce, Ho, and Eu showed the maximum reductions in size. During the development of the TiO2 nanoarchitecture, RE metal ions are segregated at grain boundaries and prevent grain growth, as previously reported in the literature.79
The percentages of the dopants in all the synthesized samples were found with the help of AAS studies. The results are presented in Tables S1–S3 (ESI†).
The results indicated that the concentrations of the dopants closely matched the proposed values.
The BET surface area, Langmuir data, and pore volume of the synthesized nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The BET areas are 6.12–7.58 m2 g−1, 8.12–12.54 m2 g−1, and 8.62–11.25 m2 g−1 for the Ce, Eu, and Ho co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The trend showed that the BET surface area first increased, with maximum values for 5% Ni and 3% RE (Ce, Ho, and Eu). The increase in surface area is due to the reduction in particle size upon doping,48,50–52 or the development of linkages between Ni and RE through oxygen.48,50–52 However, further increasing the RE metal concentration to 5% results in decreased surface area. The pore volume of synthesized nanoparticles is also shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The results showed the opposite trend compared to that of the BET surface area. The maximum pore volume is seen in the case of mono-doped nanoparticles, i.e., 5% Ni-doped and 5% RE-metal-doped nanoparticles. Upon the addition of the second dopant, the pore volume decreased. However, all the synthesized nanoparticles still exhibit microporosity.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of selected samples (i.e., the samples with the lowest crystallite size and highest surface area) are presented in Fig. 3(a). Pure TiO2 exhibits a sharp absorption edge below 400 nm, which is the characteristic peak for anatase TiO2.52,78 All the other mono-doped and co-doped TiO2 samples also exhibit a peak at the same position, as they are composed of the anatase phase of TiO2. The peak corresponds to the charge transfer from the valence to the conduction band of TiO2.52,78 TiO2 exhibits two weak-intensity peaks in the visible region, (i.e., at 723 nm and 846 nm) owing to the d–d transition in Ni2+. The overlapping of the d–d transition band of Ni2+ with the absorption band of TiO2 gives rise to the signal in the visible region. The appearance of a peak at 600–800 nm has also been reported in the literature.48,50,52–56,80–82 The main reason is the development of defects and oxygen vacancies or new energy states in the TiO2 lattice.83 The DRS data was further fitted using a Kubelka–Munk plot to determine the change in the band gap of TiO2 upon doping, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The calculated band gap values are 3.31, 3.24, 3.20, 3.16, and 3.06 eV for TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Ho-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Eu-3, respectively. A slight red-shift, i.e., decrease in the band gap, is observed for TiO2 upon co-doping. The observed shift in the band gap energy might be due to the quantum confinement effect or change in particle size of TiO2 upon doping, as previously reported in the literature.80,84–86

The FTIR spectra of selected samples are shown in Fig. 4(a). Three main peaks are clearly seen in the FTIR spectra of all samples. The peak that appears below 1000 cm−1 is associated with the presence of the TiO6 group in the samples. The peak observed between 1600–1700 cm−1 is mainly due to the M–O–Ti bond vibrations. The intensity of this peak varies depending on the doping concentration and nature of the dopants. The third broad peak at 3400–3600 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibrations of adsorbed H2O.80,83,87,88 The intensity of these peaks varies depending on the adsorption capacity of the synthesized nanoparticles.

Fig. 4(b) presents the Raman spectra of selected samples. Four major Raman bands associated with the TiO2 anatase phase are identified in all samples. These bands appeared at the frequencies of 129.49, 392.22, 512.50, and 636.89 cm−1.89 The peak that appears at 636.89 cm−1 is associated with the Eg mode of vibration, while that at 392.22 cm−1 is due to the B1g mode.90 The band at 512.50 is assigned to the A1g mode, which signifies that the anatase phase is predominant in all the synthesized nanoparticles. The maximum intensity at 129.49 cm−1 corresponds to the O–Ti–O asymmetric vibrations.90 The intensities of the band vary from sample to sample depending upon the particle size, dopant nature, dopant concentration, defects, or oxygen vacancies in the sample.91
XAS measurements were carried out to examine the exact oxidation state of Ni in selected samples (Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ce-3, Ni-Ho-3). The XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) using the Ni k-edge (8350 eV) of representative samples are shown in Fig. 4(c). NiO was used as the standard material. In NiO, a majority of the Ni is in the +2 oxidation state. The peaks appeared at 8349 eV, 8352 eV, and 8351 eV for Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3, respectively. Compared with that of the NiO standard (8350 eV), the peak positions are not shifted very much. These results showed that the majority of the Ni in all samples was in the +2 oxidation state. The oxidation state of Ni is not affected by the addition of a second dopant, and showed an octahedral arrangement in TiO2 lattice.92,93
Photoluminescence (PL) studies were conducted at an excitation wavelength of 306 nm. The results are presented in Fig. 4(d). One major emission peak is observed for all samples with a slight shift in peak position and peak intensity. The emission peaks are observed at 528.12, 530.15, 533.26, 535.15, and 515.66 nm for TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Ce-3, Ni-Ho-3, and Ni-Eu-3 respectively. As reported in the literature, the peaks between 400–600 nm are related to the oxygen vacancies with trapped electrons, surface defects, and oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 lattice.94,95 The slight shift in the peak position is due to the development of a new energy level in the band gap of TiO2. The intensity of the emission peak depends strongly on the nature of the dopants and the concentration of the dopants. As the concentration of dopants is the same in all the samples, the PL quenching mainly comes from the change in the dopants. By changing the dopant, new energy levels are created in the conduction band of TiO2, which causes the change in the interaction between electrons and oxygen trap states. Because of this interaction, carrier recombination is delayed, causing a decrease in carrier recombination efficiency and PL peak intensity.96,97
The synthesized nanoparticles were further analyzed using SEM. FE-SEM images of selected samples (TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Ce-3, Ni-Ho-3, and Ni-Eu-3) at different magnifications are demonstrated in Fig. 5(a)–(j). The results showed that all the nanoparticles exhibit a spherical morphology with slight agglomeration.98,99 The particle sizes in all samples are less than 100 nm. Comparing the SEM micrographs of all the samples, the morphology and size of all the samples are almost the same and unaffected by the nature of the dopant.

EDS studies were also conducted coupled with SEM. The EDS spectrum results are presented in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). Peaks for Ti, O, Ni, Eu, Ce, and Ho are seen in the EDS spectrum, which confirms the presence of all dopants in the samples. Furthermore, the EDS mapping results (Fig. S4, ESI†) confirm the uniform distribution of metals in all synthesized samples.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) present TEM images of a selected sample (Ni-Eu-3). From the TEM images, it is clearly visible that the particles are round in shape with a diameter of less than 100 nm. Slight agglomeration is also visible in the images, in agreement with the SEM micrographs. Fig. 6(c) shows an HR-TEM image of Ni-Eu-3 with a clear view of the (101) lattice plane, which confirms the occurrence of the dominant anatase phase in the sample.

The surface state and oxidation states of various dopants are confirmed using XPS analysis. The results are presented in Fig. 7(a)–(d) and 8(a)–(d), and Fig. S3(a)–(d) (ESI†) for Ni-Ho-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Eu-3, respectively. The binding energy values for Ti, O, Ni, Ce, Ho, and Eu in the selected samples are presented in Tables S4–S6 (ESI†). The peaks for Ti 2p1/2 in all samples appeared at around 463.27–464.66 eV, while the peak for Ti 2p3/2 appeared at 457.64–459.07 eV.100 The separation between two peaks is ∼5.6 eV indicating the presence of Ti in the +4 oxidation state in all samples.100

 Fig. 8  XPS analysis of Ni-Ce-3: (a) Ti 2p, (b) O 1s, (c) Ni 2p, and (d) Ce 4d. 
The XPS spectrum of O 1s in all samples showed two major peaks. The one at ∼530 eV is due to the lattice oxygen, mainly coming from the Ti–O bond. The second peak at ∼532 eV is attributed to the oxygen present in physically adsorbed H2O. The peaks for Ni 2p3/2 appeared at ∼855.92, 856, 857.32, and 862.37 eV, associated with the Ni–O–Ti bond.101
The XPS spectra of Ho 4d (Fig. 7(d)) showed three major peaks at 160.90, 163.61, and 168.60 eV. For Ce 4d (Fig. 8(d)) four major peaks are seen at 882.48, 866.30, 902.12, and 905.50 eV. The XPS spectra of Eu 4d showed two peaks at 136.43 and 143.21 eV (Fig. S5, ESI†). For all RE metals other than spin–orbit split doublets, the peaks at lower binding energy correspond to the M–O bond, while those at higher binding energy are attributed to the M–O–Ti bond.
4. Applications of synthesized nanoparticles
The best samples from the series were selected based on the characterization data and applied for water oxidation and supercapacitor applications. The selected samples were TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3.
4.1. Electrochemical evaluation for supercapacitor applications
The electrochemical behavior of the fabricated samples was determined using a conventional three-electrode configuration in a 6 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Fig. 9(a)–(e) presents the cyclic voltammogram curves of all the active material electrodes at different scan rate ranges from 10 to 100 mV s−1 with broad redox peaks. Moreover, the cyclic voltammograms show inconspicuous change with increasing scan rates, indicating the excellent reversibility and superb electron and ion transport capabilities,102 which further clarifies their typical faradaic battery type behavior.103 Moreover, these results are supported by voltage plateaus as clearly observed in the non-linear GCD profiles (Fig. 10) of the pristine and doped TiO2. The CV curve of the pristine TiO2 electrode exhibits a pair of symmetric redox peaks around 0.16 V and 0.45 V (Fig. 9(a)) corresponding to a reversible Ti4+/Ti3+ redox reaction in aqueous KOH electrolyte;104 upon doping and co-doping, the oxidation peak shifts to lower voltage and the reduction peak shifts to higher voltage, imparting high reversibility to the electrode during the charge–discharge process and hence enhancing cyclic stability.

To investigate the capacitive behavior of TiO2, nickel-doped TiO2 and the rare-earth-metal-co-doped TiO2 nanocomposites, GCD was performed, as shown in Fig. 10(a)–(f). The specific capacitance values (Csp) were computed from GCD curves using eqn (3) and are demonstrated in Fig. 10(f); the results indicate that co-doping of rare earth metals into the TiO2 structure results in enhanced capacitance of the target materials. The Csp values of the doped and co-doped TiO2 are 545.0, 412.5, 362.5, 210.0, and 137.5 F g−1 for Ni-5, 552.0, 490.6, 390.6, 306.2, and 260.4 F g−1 for Ni-Ce-3, 630, 510, 406.25, 332.50, and 285 F g−1 for Ni-Eu-3, and 740.0, 660.1, 512.5, 367.5, and 312.5 F g−1 for Ni-Ho-3, which are much higher than those of the pristine TiO2 electrode, i.e., 240, 180, 137.5, 113.75 and 91.25 F g−1, at the same current densities. From these Csp values, it is observed that the capacitance retention of the doped and co-doped electrodes is excellent at high current densities, while the capacitance of TiO2 rapidly drops at higher current densities.
The capacity retention and cyclic stability of all electrodes were studied at the higher current density of 5 A g−1 for 1000 cycles, and the results are displayed in Fig. 11(a). The capacity of TiO2 drops abruptly to 44%, while doping and co-doping enhance its capacity retention. The highest observed capacitance retention was for Ni-Ho-3, which is above 97%, while the Ni-5, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Eu-3 electrodes showed capacity retention of 55%, 69%, and 84% respectively. These results demonstrate that rare-earth-metal co-doping enhances the cyclic performance and makes these electrodes ideal for practical applications in supercapacitors. The initial and final few GCD cycles show no prominent disturbance in the charge–discharge curves, indicating high cyclic stability, as displayed in Fig. 11(b).

To evaluate the relationship of the charge transfer dynamics between the electrode and electrolyte, EIS was performed for all working electrodes as shown in Fig. 11(c). The Nyquist plot consists of a compressed semi-circle in the high-frequency region and a linear part in the low-frequency region. The charge transfer resistance, Rct, refers to the redox reaction that occurs at the electrode–electrolyte interface and is calculated from the diameter of the semi-circle. The smallest semi-circle is observed for Ni-Ce-3, and the largest is observed for the Ni-5 electrode. The series resistance (RΩ), which is considered to be the sum of electrolyte resistance, the internal resistance of the electrode, and contact resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface is calculated from the intercept value on the x-axis in the high-frequency region; it is the smallest for Ni-Eu-3 and largest for Ni-Ho-3. The low Warburg resistance gives rise to a steep line with a high slope in the low-frequency region, indicating excellent ion diffusion and fast charge transport for the pristine TiO2 electrodes.
4.2. Electrochemical evaluation for the OER and HER
The electrocatalytic performance of bare and doped titania (Ni-5, Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ho-3, and Ni-Ce-3) was analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in an alkaline medium. The LSV of all electrodes was measured in N2-saturated 0.1 M NaOH at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Fig. 12(a) shows that all the doped TiO2 nanocatalysts show enhanced OER activity, while the undoped TiO2 electrode is less electro-catalytically active under the same conditions. The OER overpotential values at 10 mA cm−2 for Ni-Eu-3, Ni-5, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3 are 520, 550, 600, and 620 mV, respectively. To understand the OER kinetics further, Tafel plots of the nano-catalysts were plotted and are shown in Fig. 12(b). The Tafel slopes of undoped TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Eu-3, Ni-Ce-3, and Ni-Ho-3 were measured to be 151, 143, 134, 141, and 137 mV dec−1, respectively. The smallest Tafel slope of Ni-Eu-3 indicated its highest efficiency for the OER among all the selected samples. As compared with the other samples, the Ni-Ho-3 sample also showed a lower value for the Tafel slope.
 Fig. 12  (a) LSV of selected synthesized nanocatalysts for the OER, (b) their Tafel plots for the OER, and (c) their LSV for the HER. 
A systematic study was also conducted for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for selected nano-catalysts. The results obtained from the HER are presented in Fig. 12(c). A clear reduction peak is seen in all the doped samples (peak A). This metal reduction peak is more pronounced for Ni-Eu-3. As a result of the electrochemical reaction, there is a possibility of a change in the electronic structure of TiO2 due to the formation of additional energy levels within the band gap.105 It is believed that these charge carriers are trapped by the energy level corresponding to the Ti3+ state, which is one of the identified surface states of the titania.106 These energy levels influence the electrical conductivity and optical properties of titania.105 In contrast, the undoped TiO2 exhibits very weak electrocatalytic HER activity. The better textural and optical properties or defects in the doped samples, especially Ni-Eu-3 and Ni-Ho-3, are the reason for the enhancement of their electrocatalytic activity (for both the OER and HER). Due to an increase in defects and oxygen vacancies, the number of active sites for electrocatalysis increases, thus increasing the overall activity.
The electrochemical nature of the best electrocatalyst (Ni-Eu-3) was further investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV measurements were conducted at different scan rates, as demonstrated in Fig. 13(a) and (b). The electrocatalyst displayed capacitive current in the anodic region (i.e., 0–0.5 V). The reduction peak observed after 0.5 V is associated with the reduction of metals. At this cathodic potential, the HER started, as has been previously reported in the literature. The reduction process started with the injection of electrons coming from a change in the oxidation state of TiO2 (i.e., Ti4+ to Ti3+ to Ti2+). Finally, at the most negative potential, the reduction of the solvent takes place via the insertion of hydrogen in the nanocatalyst. Reoxidation of all reduced forms takes place upon moving toward the positive side at a higher anodic current. On arriving at the most positive potential, the OER started, along with the reoxidation of solvent.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique that gives insight into charge transport mechanisms.107 The EIS measurement gives information regarding the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec). Fig. 13(c) shows the impedance response. Two semicircles are obtained for all nanocatalysts. The higher-frequency semicircle is associated with the solution resistance (Rs), while the low-frequency semicircle is assigned to the Rct at the electrode interface. The radius of the arc of the Nyquist plots is directly related to the Rs and Rct.108 The smaller arcs of Ni-Eu-3, Ni-5, Ni-Ho-3, and Ni-Ce-3 in comparison with that of undoped TiO2 indicate lower Rct and Rs for the modified working electrodes. Thus, the charge transfer kinetics and catalytic ability of TiO2 have been improved by doping.
5. Conclusions
TiO2 nanomaterials incorporating Ni and RE metals have been synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method and were successfully utilized as electrode materials in supercapacitors and as electrocatalysts for water oxidation applications. The effect of the incorporation of the different doping metals in the TiO2 lattice was interpreted using various characterization techniques. The electrochemical properties of the TiO2 nanoarchitectures can be improved by the incorporation of metal ions, as explained by the synergistic effect. The results show that the utilization of the Ni-Ho-3 doped TiO2 nanostructure achieved the highest capacitance value of 740 F g−1 compared with that of undoped TiO2. Furthermore, all the co-doped electrodes showed better cyclic stability with 80–97% capacitive retention. In addition, Ni-Eu-3 and Ni-Ho-3 showed the highest overpotential values at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. The smallest Tafel slope of Ni-Ho-3 (137 mV dec−1) indicates its highest efficiency for the OER as compared to those of undoped TiO2, Ni-5, Ni-Eu-3, and Ni-Ce-3 (calculated Tafel slope values are 151, 143, 134, and 141 mV dec−1, respectively). The superior performance of the co-doped nanoarchitectures was credited to the formation of a mesoporous structure with more electroactive sites, high charge density, and fast charge transfer. Due to their superior performance, these co-doped nanomaterials will be potential candidates as electron transport materials in solar cells.
