    , Accepted 28th July 2021First published on 2nd August 2021AbstractS-scheme heterojunction is a new photocatalytic hydrogen production system, which can effectively eliminate useless electron–hole pairs and improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this work, Ni-MOF-P(Ni2P)/In2O3 composite photocatalyst was prepared with Ni-MOF-74 and In2O3 by a one-step calcination-phosphating method. The prepared composite catalyst maintained a specific parallelogram-layered structure of Ni-MOF-74 and constructed S-scheme heterojunction. Various characterization techniques such as XRD, SEM, and XPS were used for the characterization of the photocatalyst, which proved that the Ni-MOF-P/In2O3 composite photocatalyst was successfully synthesized for the photocatalytic performance. SEM study showed that In2O3 was excellently compounded on Ni2P, and the cycling experiments and XRD of the sample after the cycling experiment proved their outstanding stability. The amount of hydrogen evolution with a mass ratio of Ni2P and In2O3 of 1:0.3 was 494.17 μmol (within 5 h), which is 3 times the hydrogen evolution of Ni-MOF-P. In this work, a novel and simple method for preparing non-noble metal phosphides was proposed for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using a photocatalyst.
1. Introduction
Fossil energy plays a vital role in our lives, such as petrol, the source of power for automobiles, and coal, which is burned in thermal power plants. However, the use of fossil energy generates a large number of greenhouse gases such as CO2, which causes global warming and ocean heat waves,1 and other hazards. In addition, coal often contains sulfur and will generate SO2 gas after combustion, and a large amount of SO2 gas will lead to the formation of acid rain.2 At the same time, fossil energy sources are becoming increasingly difficult to extract and consume more and more energy. Finally, the rate of formation of fossil energy compared with renewable energy will be lower and lower.3 Therefore, looking for renewable clean energy to replace fossil energy is a direction worthy of research and discussion.
Among many clean energy sources, hydrogen is considered by many as a clean energy source that can be used to replace fossil energy. Hydrogen has many advantages, such as high energy density, only water as a combustion product, and zero emissions. The use of hydrogen as a primary energy source would solve the aforementioned global warming problems and would not lead to acid rain disasters. In 1972, A. Fujishima and, K. Honda two scientists discovered that the photochemistry of TiO2 under light conditions could separate water into hydrogen and oxygen.4 After that, researchers have carried out more research and found that more materials can decompose water into hydrogen under light conditions. Among them, a more prominent type of photocatalyst is a compound containing a phosphorus-doped transition metal, such as Ni2P,5,6 CoP,7 FeP,8,9 MoP,10,11 WP,12,13 and Fe2P.14,15 This type of material has a low production cost and a simple preparation process to replace the photocatalyst prepared using precious metals. In addition to the above photocatalysts, there are Ni-based, EY-based and MOFS-based photocatalysts.16–18
Water can be split to generate hydrogen because when light irradiates the catalyst, it will provide photons to the catalyst.19 Then, when the absorbed photon energy reaches the band gap value, many electrons and holes will be generated, and electrons and holes will migrate to the surface of the catalyst.20 The electrons on the surface will participate in the reduction reaction to reduce H+ ions to generate hydrogen.21 In photocatalytic water splitting, the main reason that hinders hydrogen production is that electrons and holes rapidly recombine after they are generated. Therefore, to further increase hydrogen production, sacrificial reagents are customarily added to remove holes to reduce the combination of electrons and holes. The recombination rate of the holes increases hydrogen production. The most commonly used sacrificial reagents are lactic acid,22,23 triethanolamine,24etc. In addition to the sacrificial reagent, sensitizer eosin Y will be added to sensitize the catalyst to increase hydrogen production. Eosin Y increases the range of absorption of sunlight by the catalyst, resulting in more efficient photon absorption. The sacrificial reagent triethanolamine will also participate in eosin Y. The photochemical process generates a triplet excited state EY3*, which provides additional electrons and injects more hydrogen production power for the catalytic system.25,26
In2O3 has a good conduction band and valence band structure and is a wide band gap n-type semiconductor. Still, because In2O3 will self-aggregate,27 resulting in a significant reduction in available active sites, it shows poor performance in hydrogen production. Therefore, In2O3 can be used as a co-catalyst to enhance the hydrogen production of the composite catalyst.28,29 Ni-MOF-74 has a layered parallelogram morphology.30 Therefore, Ni2P is obtained by phosphating Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor. Ni2P obtained using this method will have the precursor Ni-MOF-74. In terms of morphological structure, Ni2P with morphological structure can provide a wider surface, and In2O3 composite can effectively solve self-aggregation. In addition, the composition of Ni2P and In2O3 constructs the S-scheme heterojunction, which promotes the recombination of useless electrons and holes, and preserves the electrons and holes of high reduction and oxidation capabilities, respectively. S-scheme not only enhances the separation of electrons and holes but also does not lose valuable electrons and holes.31–35 Therefore, the S-scheme heterojunction provides a promising method for improving the photocatalyst activity.36–40
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of In2O3
Indium oxide was prepared by improving the method described in the literature.41 The first step was to add 3 g of In(NO3)3·6H2O to 100 mL of deionized water by magnetic stirring until it was completely dissolved. The second step was to add NH3·H2O to the above solution by dropping, which produces white precipitation. Then, the addition of NH3·H2O was stopped when the precipitation was no longer being formed. The third step was to age the suspension in a water bath at 80 °C for 1 h. The fourth step was to separate the white precipitate from the liquid by centrifugation after the aging suspension. Then, the precipitate was washed twice with deionized water and once with alcohol, and after that, it was placed in an oven at 60 °C for drying for 12 h. The fifth step was to calcine the dried white precipitate in a 350 °C muffle furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h. Finally, the yellow powder indium oxide was collected.
2.3. Synthesis of Ni-MOF-74
Ni-MOF-74 was prepared30 by improving a method from the literature. The first step was to add 20 mL of deionized water, ethanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) into the same beaker and stirred evenly with magnetic stirring for 5 min. The second step was to add 3.2 g Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.48 g p-phthalic acid (PTA), and 2.4 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-K30) to the above evenly-stirred solution, one after the other, and then stirring magnetically for 30 min. The third step was to transfer the prepared solution into a polytetrafluoroethylene liner and placing it in a high-pressure reactor, which was hydrothermally treated at 150 °C and 10 h to synthesize Ni-MOF-74. In the fourth step, the prepared Ni-MOF-74 was separated from the liquid by centrifugation and then washed twice with deionized water and once with alcohol and placed in the oven for drying at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, a green powder of Ni-MOF-74 was obtained.
2.4. Synthesis Ni-MOF-P
The first step involved taking 0.1 g of the prepared Ni-MOF-74 prepared and 0.5 g of NaH2PO2, and grinding in a mortar and pestle for 5 min. The second step was to transfer the thoroughly mixed powder into a porcelain boat covered with tin foil and calcining for 2 h in a 300 °C in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The third step was to take the lumped Ni2P (Ni-MOF-P) from the porcelain boat and grinding it with a mortar and pestle, followed by washing it twice with deionized water. The fourth step was to dry the washed Ni2P in the oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, a black powder of Ni-MOF-P was collected.
2.5. Synthesis Ni-MOF-P/In2O3
The first step was to weigh 0.1 g of Ni-MOF-74, x g of indium oxide (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05), and 0.5 g NaH2PO2 and then thoroughly grinding them for 5 min in a mortar and pestle. The second step was to transfer the fully ground powder into a porcelain boat covered with tin foil and heating at 300 °C in a tube furnace for 2 h at a heating rate is 5 °C min−1. The third step was to transfer the composite catalyst Ni2P/In2O3, which was sintered into blocks in the porcelain boat and grind it thoroughly with a mortar with a pestle into a powder. The fourth step was to wash the powder twice with deionized water and then dry it for 12 h in an oven at 60 °C. Finally, a black powder named y-NIO (y = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) was obtained.
2.6. Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) (HORIBA Scientific, France) instrument operating in the range 5° to 80° under 40 kV and 30 mA at a scan speed is 10° min−1 was used to study the samples. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM1200EX, JEOL, 100 kV) were used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of the photocatalyst. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi) was performed on the catalyst for obtaining the valence chemical composition analysis. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) specific surface area was obtained using N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal analysis using ASAP 2460 instrument working at 77 K. Photoluminescence (PL), and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was performed using a FLUOROMAX-4 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on all catalyst samples using the UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer.
2.7. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments
Photocatalytic experiments were carried out at room temperature. 10 mg of photocatalyst and 20 mg of Eosin-Y (EY) to 30 mL of sacrificial reagent (TEOA solution (15 vol%)) were added to a reactor bottle. Nitrogen gas was bubbled into the hydrogen production bottle for 20 min before light exposure and replacing the system gas with nitrogen gas. A magnetic stirrer was suspended in the reaction bottle together with the photocatalyst and the sacrificial reagent. 5 W white light of wavelength range >420 nm with the integrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the light source in the multi-channel reaction system. A gas chromatograph (Tianmei GC7900, TCD, 13Xcolumn, N2 as carrier) was used to analyze the hydrogen produced.
2.8. Electrochemical measurements
The photocatalyst was studied using an electrochemical analyzer (VersaStat4-400, Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc.) using a standard three-electrode cell. 5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in the prepared solution (perfluorosulfonic acid:alcohol = 1:9), and it was smeared on a conductive glass (1 × 1.5 cm2), dried and used as a working electrode. The reference electrode and counter electrodes are calomel electrode and metallic platinum, respectively. The electrolyte was Na2SO4 (0.2 M, pH = 8)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD analysis
XRD characterization analysis is extremely helpful in the phase analysis of the photocatalyst and to judge whether the target product was prepared according to the designed scheme. In Fig. 1(a), five strong peaks of In2O3 identified from the standard card (PDF #6-416) are 2θ = 21.50°, 30.58°, 35.46°, 51.04°, 60.68°, corresponding to crystal planes (211), (222), (400), (440), (622) were observed. Low strength peaks were also observed; XRD patterns of the measured In2O3 perfectly matched those from the standard card. Meanwhile, no other unrelated peaks could be found, which proved that the prepared In2O3 had high crystallinity and no impurities. The peak width of In2O3 indicates that the size of the prepared sample was small, and the small size of In2O3 is conducive to the composite of Ni-MOF-P.42 In SEM characterization, In2O3 was seen to be well compounded on the surface of Ni-MOF-P. Compared to the standard card (PDF#89-4864), the six peaks of Ni2P marked in Fig. 1(b) are 2θ = 40.71°, 44.61°, 47.36°, 54.20°, 55.00°, 74.78°, which are corresponding to e crystal planes (111), (201), (210), (300), (211), (400), respectively. XRD patterns of Ni-MOF-74 are also marked in Fig. 1(b) with four peaks of 2θ = 8.88°, 14.07°, 15.80°, and 17.87°. By comparing XRD patterns of Ni-MOF-P, it was found that most of the peaks of Ni-MOF-74 disappeared, while the peaks with high peak intensity decreased significantly. In their place, peaks consistent with Ni2P appear, indicating the successful preparation of Ni2P using Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor system. The peak intensity of Ni2P is lower than that of peaks in the standard card due to the fact that Ni-MOF-P has the framework structure of the precursor Ni-MOF-74.43 The XRD characterization was also performed on the complex y-NIO (y = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). In Fig. 1(c), the In2O3 content in the 5-NIO sample is low (≤5 wt%), and the corresponding peaks could not be observed, while the other samples have high-intensity In2O3 and Ni2P peaks. With the increase of In2O3 content, the peak intensity of In2O3 increases, proving that In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P successfully recombined under this method. The XRD patterns of 30-NIO before and after hydrogen production are shown in Fig. 1(d). The strength of peaks after hydrogen production did not change significantly from that before the hydrogen production, indicating that the calcination method could make In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P form a stable composite structure, and the composite structure will not break during the hydrogen production process that could cause reduction in the hydrogen production efficiency.

3.2. SEM, TEM, and EDX analysis
SEM and TEM characterization helps to visualize features such as the morphology of the sample. Fig. 2(a) is the SEM image of Ni-MOF-74, where a parallelogram-like lamellar structure can be observed. The SEM image of In2O3 is shown in Fig. 2(b), which is an irregular granular material with a rough surface, and the rough surface is advantageous for the composite with Ni-MOF-P. After the calcination-phosphating treatment, the original Ni-MOF-74 skeleton structure was destroyed, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Images of Ni-MOF-P and 30-NIO show that the middle part and laminated structure of Ni-MOF-74 are retained, with some degree of damage to its surrounding edges and corners. The surface becomes rough, which is also conducive to recombination with In2O3. At the same time, it can be seen in Fig. 2(d) that In2O3 is well compounded on the surface of Ni-MOF-P. The tight binding of Ni-MOF-P with In2O3 facilitates the longevity of the photocatalyst in photocatalytic reactions and allows for even easier electron transfer between the two materials.44 The 30-NIO sample was further characterized by TEM. The successful complexation of In2O3 on Ni-MOF-P and the pore structure of Ni-MOF-P can be observed more clearly in the low magnification TEM image shown in Fig. 2(e). In the TEM image shown in Fig. 2(e) at low magnification, it can be more clearly observed that In2O3 was successfully composited with Ni-MOF-P and the pore structure of Ni-MOF-P. In Fig. 2(g), lattice fringes of 0.243 nm, 0.113 nm, 0.183 nm, and 0.143 nm were observed, corresponding to (411), (840), (521), and (543) crystal faces of In2O3, respectively. Polycrystalline surface observations show that In2O3 was unaffected by the phosphating agent during the phosphating process and remains irregularly granular. EDX analysis of the sample showed that the samples contained Ni, O, In, C, and P elements, which to some extent indicated that Ni-MOF-P was successfully prepared by calcining and phosphating Ni-MOF-74 and that In2O3 was successfully combined with Ni-MOF-P. Further analysis of successful complexes was carried out using XPS characterization.

3.3. XPS results
XPS was used to understand the prepared samples further, and surface chemical states and bonding were studied. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the presence of Ni, O, In, C and P elements in the measured sample are consistent with the EDX results from SEM. The existence of element C is because Ni-MOF-P is prepared by phosphating Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor, as such, it contains a significant amount of element C. The presence of two peaks at 284.7 eV and 288.5 eV in Fig. 3(b) demonstrates the presence of O–CO, C–O and CC in the sample, indicating that the prepared sample retains the framework structure of Ni-MOF-74.45 In Fig. 3(c), In 3d, there are two peaks at 444.4 eV and 451.9 eV, corresponding to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively,29 indicating that the predominant valence state of the In element in the sample 30-NIO is In(III), namely In2O3. The XPS pattern of Ni 2p shown in Fig. 3(d), the peak located at 853.7 eV belongs to Ni 2p3/2, indicating that the element Ni in Ni-MOF-P exists as Ni(II).46 856.8 eV and 874.7 eV are the main peaks of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.47 The two satellite peaks at 862.1 eV and 880.35 eV are due to the oxidation of Ni-MOF-P in the air to produce nickel oxide, so these two satellite peaks are attributed to Ni(II) in nickel oxide.48 871.2 eV is a satellite peak that occurs due to the interaction between Ni and phosphate ions.49 In Fig. 3(e), there are two peaks 531.55 eV and 533.3 eV, caused by the adsorption of water and –OH on the sample surface.50Fig. 3(f) shows two peaks of 130.05 eV and 133.6 eV, respectively. 130.05 eV is associated with P(II) in Ni-MOF-P, and the presence of 133.6 eV is due to the oxidation (PO43− or P2O5) caused by exposure to air. In Fig. 3(c), there is a certain increase in the XPS binding energy of 30-NIO, which is due to the electron transfer of In2O3 and the decrease in electron density. As shown in Fig. 3(e)–(f), the binding energy decreases to a certain extent as a result Ni-MOF-P gets electrons and the electron density increases. Combined with XPS, SEM, TEM, and EDX characterization analysis, it is demonstrated that the structures of the precursor Ni-MOF-74 and the composite of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P were successfully prepared according to the expected design scheme.

3.4. BET characterization
The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was used to analyze surface areas of In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, 30-NIO and Ni-MOF-74. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore sizes of In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, 30-NIO, and Ni-MOF-74 are shown in Fig. 4. Table 1 lists the specific surface area (SBET), the average pore volume, and average pore size of the photocatalyst. The isotherms of In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, 30-NIO, and Ni-MOF-74 show a type III curve with an H3 hysteresis loop.51 In2O3 has a larger SBET, which means more contact area with Ni-MOF-P, helping In2O3 to firmly anchor during calcination for the preparation of Ni-MOF-P.44 The SBET of the composite 30-NIO photocatalyst is somewhat improved compared to Ni-MOF-P. The larger specific surface area helps to increase the area of the photocatalyst irradiated by light and provides more active sites during the process of hydrogen evolution, thus absorbing more photons and significantly increasing the efficiency of hydrogen production. The increase in the average pore volume suggests that Ni-MOF-P pores were filled and recombined with In2O3 during calcination,52 which is consistent with findings from TEM. Larger pore volume plays a good role in promoting the adsorption of reactants and diffusion-reaction products. The change in the BET characterization data for Ni-MOF-P compared to Ni-MOF-74 is due to the effect of phosphorylation. The phosphatisation results in a larger pore volume and specific surface area. In Fig. 4, the pore size of 30-NIO is distributed between 2–50 nm, indicating that it is a mesoporous material that reduces the distance required for carrier transportation and enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution amount.53

3.5. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
In a 62 mL heat-resistant quartz flask, 10 mg of the photocatalyst and 20 mg of sensitizer EY were added, followed by 30 mL of the sacrificial reagent TEOA. The hydrogen production activity of the photocatalyst was explained intuitively by the hydrogen production experiment. In Fig. 5(a), the 5 h hydrogen production of Ni-MOF-74 was 2.92 μmol, proving that Ni-MOF-74 cannot act as a hydrogen-producing photocatalyst by itself, as in the previous work30. The photocatalyst Ni-MOF-P was prepared by phosphating Ni-MOF-74, and its 5 h hydrogen production reached 156.46 μmol. However, hydrogen production does not increase linearly since the higher recombination rate of electron–hole pairs inhibits hydrogen evolution production. The hydrogen production of In2O3 is 4.16 μmol in 5 h. The low hydrogen production was caused by the agglomeration effect of In2O3 itself, which hindered the photocatalytic reaction. The hydrogen production of 30-NIO composite catalysts in 5 h is 494.17 μmol, which is 3 and 118 times higher than that of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3, respectively. The hydrogen production of 30-NIO increases linearly with time, showing good hydrogen production activity. These results indicate that the combination of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P can effectively reduce the recombination of electrons and holes, increase the number of electrons involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction and that the sacrifice reagent (TEOA) can better consume holes to promote the continued generation of electron–hole pairs and form a good cycle.

The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment was conducted for y-NIO (y = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b). The hydrogen production of y-NIO increases as the mass ratio of In2O3 increases, and the highest hydrogen production is when the mass ratio of In2O3 reaches 30 wt%. The decrease in hydrogen production after increasing the mass ratio of In2O3 indicates that the excess In2O3 covers the active site, preventing it from coming into contact with the sacrificial reagent (TEOA) and water molecules and inhibiting the photocatalytic reaction. The EY-sensitizer system has specific requirements on the pH value of the reaction system. Photocatalytic hydrogen production experiments were conducted on 30-NIO at pH = 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 5(c). Hydrogen production increases with increasing pH, with the highest hydrogen production at pH = 10. This is because, when the pH value of the reaction system is too low, there is too much H+ in the whole system, which causes the protonation of TEOA and cannot effectively provide electron consumption holes for 30-NIO. On the contrary, too high a pH and too low an H+ content do not allow the photocatalyst to receive large amounts of H+, thus inhibiting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process. The photocatalyst stability is essential in practical applications, so, for 30-NIO under the same hydrogen production conditions above, 20 mg EY was added before each cycle using the sacrificial reagent at the optimum pH (pH = 10). The stability of the photocatalyst was demonstrated by four hydrogen production cycles (5 h per cycle). As shown in Fig. 5(d), the total hydrogen production in the fourth cycle is still 76% of the hydrogen production tested in the first cycle. Part of the decrease in hydrogen production may be caused by the consumption of sacrifice reagent (TEOA). The cyclic hydrogen production experiment shows that 30-NIO prepared using the calcination method, In2O3 on the Ni-MOF-P is firmly fixed and will not easily fall off during the photocatalytic reaction, and has good stability.
3.6. UV-vis DRS analysis
The absorbance of the photocatalyst is an important indicator of the performance of a photocatalyst. Fig. 6(a) shows UV-vis DRS patterns of the photocatalysts 30-NIO, In2O3, and Ni-MOF-P. In2O3 is light yellow in colour and in the visible light range has a good light absorption performance. The absorption edges of In2O3 are around 295 nm and 500 nm, due to its inherent properties.54 Because the color of 30-NIO and Ni-MOF-P is black, their UV-vis DRS curves are approximately a straight line.55,56 30-NIO and Ni-MOF-P have excellent light absorption performance between 250–800 nm. Through the comparison, the absorbance of 30-NIO is found to be increased by the combination of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3. This is because the photocatalysts absorb photons when exposed to light, and when the energy of the absorbed photons is higher than their bandgap value, electron–hole pairs are formed. Thus, stronger light absorption means more photons will be absorbed, resulting in more electron–hole pairs and improving the hydrogen production performance of the photocatalyst. The results obtained by the formula [eqn (1)] are shown in Fig. 6(b), in which Eg of In2O3 is 2.64 eV. According to previous studies, the Eg value of Ni-MOF-P is 1.00 eV.57 (1)α represents absorption coefficient, h represents Planck's constant, ν represents light frequency, Eg represents bandgap value, and A represents a constant, respectively.

3.7. Photoluminescence analysis
Photoluminescence spectroscopy can intuitively describe the separation of electron–hole pairs. EY was prepared by adding EY to the TEOA solution (15 vol%) (C = 1 × 10−6 mol L−1). Then, 5 mg In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, and 30-NIO were added to 25 mL of the above EY solution, and the excitation wavelength was tested at 480 nm. After the excitation light irradiates the photocatalyst, the electron–hole pair will be generated. Then, the electrons and holes will separate, with some of them being transferred and the parts that are not transferred recombining. The energy will be released in the form of fluorescence after the electron has compounded with the hole.58Fig. 7(a) shows the photoluminescence spectra of EY, In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, and 30-NIO. As different photocatalysts have different recombination rates of electrons and holes, different peaks of emission peaks will appear. In the range of 500–650 nm, EY, In2O3, and Ni-MOF-P have the highest peak at 537 nm, and 30-NIO has the highest peak at 536 nm. The peaks from high to low are of EY, In2O3, Ni- MOF-P, and 30-NIO. A high peak value means a high fluorescence intensity, indicating that more electrons and holes are recombined in the photocatalyst. Hence, a lower peak value means a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes.59 The experimental results intuitively prove that the combination of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P can effectively reduce the recombination of electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. The result shows that the composite catalyst 30-NIO has good photocatalytic activity and is consistent with the kinetics of hydrogen production. A first-exponential attenuation model is used to fit the corresponding time-resolved spectrum, and the formula is as follows[eqn (2) and (3)]:60 (2)I is the standard emission intensity; t is the time after pulsed laser excitation; τ1 is the respective attenuation life; B1 is the corresponding weighting factor. (3)〈τ〉 is the average life; τ1 is the respective decay time; B1 is the corresponding weighting factor.

Time-resolved photoluminescence can be used to obtain the average lifetime of the electrons in the measured sample. The short average lifetime of electrons indicates that the sample has a faster electron transfer rate and a lower rate of electron–hole complexation. Fig. 7(b) shows the time-resolved photoluminescence spectrum, and Table 2 shows the relevant data for the measured sample. As can be seen from Table 2, the average lifetime of EY, In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, and 30-NIO are 0.124 ns, 0.102 ns, 0.071 ns, and 0.058 ns, respectively. Compared with EY, In2O3, and Ni-MOF-P, the average lifetime of 30-NIO is significantly shorter, and it is the shortest among the four. The short average lifetime indicates that the photogenerated carriers can be rapidly transferred between the In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P of the 30-NIO composite and spatially separated from the holes, avoiding complexation with the holes and reducing the rate of electron–hole complexation. These excellent results are attributed to the formation of S-scheme heterojunction,61 which improves the electron utilization rate and accelerates the electron transfer, facilitating the photocatalytic hydrogen production.

3.8. Photoelectric performance test
Electrochemical experiments were carried out on the samples to gain a better understanding of the separation of photogenerated carriers. The photocurrent response curve can directly reflect the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pair. A lower photocurrent response indicates poor separation efficiency of the electron–hole pair. Conversely, a higher photocurrent response indicates that more electron–hole pairs are effectively separated.62Fig. 8(a) shows the photocurrent response curves of In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, and 30-NIO. In contrast, the photocurrent response is 30-NIO, Ni-MOF-P and In2O3 in descending order. The results show that the photocatalyst 30-NIO prepared by the combination of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3 can promote the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs and improve the reaction degree in the positive direction of photocatalytic reaction.63 The radius of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curve reflects the resistance of the sample under test to the migration of photogenerated carriers. The smaller the potential barrier for electron migration, the smaller the impedance, which is proportional to the radius of the curve. Fig. 8(b) shows the fitted EIS curves for In2O3, Ni-MOF-P, and 30-NIO data, with the inset showing the simulated circuit. Among 30-NIO, In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P, 30-NIO has the smallest curve radius so that the photogenerated carriers migrate more easily in the 30-NIO complex than the other two catalysts. In addition, electrons and holes are apart by electron migration, hindering the recombination of electron–hole pairs and improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. The Mott–Schottky curves for In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), respectively (tested at 100 Hz). The flat-band potential (Efb) of the semiconductor material can be obtained using the Mott–Schottky curve and the formula [eqn (4)],64 and it can be known that both of them are n-type semiconductors. The conduction band (ECB) of a semiconductor can be calculated by Efb, which is usually minus 0.1 eV or 0.2 eV above the calculated value. The ECB of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P is calculated using the formula [eqn (5)]. The ECB values of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P are −0.56 eV and −0.81 eV, respectively. In UV-vis DRS characterization, Eg of In2O3 and Ni-MOF-P were obtained, and then the value band (EVB) was calculated by the formula [eqn (6)], and the relevant calculated data are summarized in Table 3. 1/C2 = 2(NDeεε0)−1·(E − Efb − kT/e)(4)C is the capacitance of the space charge region; ND is the charge carrier concentration; e is the electron charge; ε is the dielectric constant; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity; E is the electrode applied potential; Efb is flat band potentials; K is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature. ENHE = ESCE + 0.24 eV − 0.1 eV (or 0.2 eV)(5) ECB = EVB − Eg(6)

3.9. Possible mechanism
The Ni-MOF-P/In2O3 composite photocatalyst is discussed and analyzed based on the above characterization. As shown in Fig. 9, synthesizing the energy band structure of the catalyst proposed a possible photocatalytic mechanism and carrier transfer mode, namely S-scheme heterojunction.65 After the two photocatalysts were calcined, the e− in Ni-MOF-P will be transferred to the composite interface due to the Coulomb force. Then, e− will be transferred across the interface to In2O3 until the Fermi energy levels of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3 tend to balance. Simultaneously, because the transfer of e− leads to different charged properties of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3, with the positive charge of Ni-MOF-P and negative charge of In2O3, which will form an internal electric field at the composite interface. At the same time, the conduction band and valence band of Ni-MOF-P will bend upward due to the loss of electrons, while the conduction band and valence band of In2O3 will bend downward due to the gain of a large number of electrons. Under the irradiation of visible light, the photocatalyst absorbs photon energy, and when the absorbed energy is higher than the band gap value, the electron–hole pair will be excited. Due to the presence of the built-in electric field, the conduction band of In2O3 will bend downward, and the valence band of Ni-MOF-P will bend upwards, so the electrons in the conduction band of In2O3 can easily transition to the composite interface. Meanwhile, holes in the valence band of Ni-MOF-P are also easily transferred to the composite interface for recombination with electrons to consume useless electrons and holes. In the conduction band of Ni-MOF-P, the electrons undergo a reduction reaction to produce hydrogen. The upward-bending conduction band of Ni-MOF-P can effectively inhibit the electron transition to the conduction band of In2O3 and prevent the reduction of hydrogen production efficiency. The holes located in the valence band of In2O3 will be consumed by sacrificial reagents, which will promote the generation and separation of electron–hole pairs to some extent. The added EY dye molecules will be adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst, excited by visible light to form a singlet excited state (EY1*), and through an intersystem transition (ISC) to form a triplet excited state (EY3*). Then, TEOA will provide electrons to EY3* to quench EY3* and obtain EY−* with strong reducing ability. Finally, the electrons of EY−* will be transferred to the outside of Ni-MOF-P and In2O3 to participate in the reduction reaction to produce hydrogen. After transferring electrons, the EY dye molecules will return to the ground state.

4. Conclusion
Ni-MOF-P was prepared by phosphorylation using Ni-MOF-74 as the precursor and compounded with In2O3 to successfully synthesize a new composite photocatalyst Ni-MOF-P/In2O3 The composite structure of the photocatalyst Ni-MOF-P/In2O3 constructs an S-scheme heterojunction that can transfer useless electrons and holes to the composite interface for consumption, helping promote the generation of electron–hole pairs, which is also beneficial to improve the hydrogen production function of the photocatalyst. In this system, the Ni-MOF-P/In2O3 composite photocatalyst has lower electrochemical impedance, higher photocurrent response, better absorbance and better hydrogen production capacity than Ni-MOF-P by a factor of three compared to Ni-MOF-P. Thus, this work provides a feasible and effective method for the photodegradation of aquatic hydrogen by an EY dye-sensitized metal phosphide photocatalyst.
