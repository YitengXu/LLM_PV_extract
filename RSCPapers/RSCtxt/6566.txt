    , Accepted 26th June 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractRecently, great advances in polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs) have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) over the 17% milestone. However, significant research efforts have been mainly dedicated to designing narrow bandgap PSMAs by altering the building block and alkyl side chain. In this work, we report the design of novel PSMAs with wide bandgaps by incorporating a novel terminal unit without isomerization, 5-bromo-4,7-difluoro-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (FFOBr). The resulting PSMAs exhibit high molar absorption coefficient over 105 M−1 cm−1, relatively wide bandgaps about 1.65 eV as well as high-lying lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of above −3.70 eV. When matching with the polymer donor JD40, both polymer acceptors can enable efficient all-PSCs with over 1.10 V open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to their high-lying LUMO energy level. Moreover, with a screened copolymerization spacer, the PFFO-Th-based blend film exhibits favorable morphology, more ordered crystallization, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses, which together contribute to the higher short-circuit current density and fill factor and thereby a high PCE of 10.8%. This value is one of the best with regard to PSMA-based all-polymer solar cells with VOC over 1.10 V in the reported literature. Our work shows that the terminal unit and linkage manipulation are effective strategies to develop high-performance PSMAs with controllable bandgaps.
Introduction
In the past few decades, significant progress has been achieved in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs), which exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to ∼19% for single junction cells owing to the emergence of novel active-layer materials,1–7 the exploration of sophisticated device architectures,8–10 and the optimization of blend morphology.11–14 Among the several types of PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), that utilize polymers as both the electron donor and electron acceptor, have attracted much attention recently due to their pronounced advantages of mechanical flexibility and device stability.15–19 However, the advance of all-PSCs still lag behind their competitor, small molecule acceptor (SMA)-based PSCs.20–23 Recently, Li et al. proposed a polymerized small molecule acceptor (PSMA) strategy that incorporates a high-efficiency small molecule acceptor (SMA) as a building block to construct polymer acceptors.24,25 Such a design strategy could significantly improve the light absorption coefficient of the resulting PMSA of PZ1 (>105 M−1 cm−1) and thus the PZ1-based all-PSCs achieved a considerable PCE of 9.19%. Thereafter, tremendous attention was focused on designing various narrow bandgap PSMAs with Y5-series non-fullerene acceptors as the building blocks, showing improved light-harvesting ability with the absorption onset exceeding 850 nm and thereby enabling high short-circuit current (JSC) and PCEs.26–32 Recently, benefiting from the continuous efforts on the structural optimization of Y-derivative-based PSMAs, the PCEs of all-PSCs have been rapidly boosted up to over 17%.33–40
However, to date, the majority of reported PSMAs are narrow bandgap ones while PSMAs with wide bandgaps have not yet been explored, which are apparently pivotal for versatile applications in indoor photovoltaics,41–43 and tandem as well as ternary solar cells.44–47 Besides, the molecular structure engineering of PSMAs mainly focused on the manipulation of both the centered aromatic fused-ring moiety and side chain substituents of SMAs, and little attention was paid to the rational regulation of the terminal moiety of SMAs.48,49 Apparently, it was supposed that modifying the terminal group of SMAs would have a more significant effect on regulating the optoelectronic properties of PSMAs than the approach of side-chain engineering; in addition, terminal group engineering was more facile than the modification of the centered aromatic fused-ring unit due to the obviously increased synthetic complexity of the latter strategy.50–52 For instance, the selection of the terminal unit plays a dominant role in determining the intramolecular push–pull electron effect of the SMA unit and thus greatly affects the absorption profile and frontier molecular orbital energy levels.53 Moreover, even though the same centered aromatic fused-ring moiety of SMAs was adopted, the varied electron-withdrawing ability of terminal groups could lead to distinct alteration in the bandgap of PSMAs, making it possible to attain wide-bandgap PSMAs by solely regulating the terminal groups.54,55 Additionally, there have already been reports showing that the isomerization of the terminal unit of SMAs in PSMAs would greatly affect the resulting morphology and charge transport properties of the corresponding all-PSCs, and PSMAs without isomerization on the terminal unit would enable higher photovoltaic performance.56,57 All these considerations inspired us to develop PSMAs with wide bandgaps by a facile approach via the introduction of a novel isomerization-free terminal group.
Herein, a novel terminal unit without isomerization, 5-bromo-4,7-difluoro-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione, was incorporated into the SMA building block to construct two new wide-bandgap PSMAs, namely PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh. The fluoro substitution on the terminal group of PSMAs was expected to enhance the molecular packing and therefore enable high carrier mobility. Moreover, the copolymerized spacer units varying from mono-thiophene (PFFO-Th) to bithiophene (PFFO-DTh) were employed in order to fine-tune the molecular packing of PSMAs for optimizing the performance of all-PSCs. It was observed that the newly developed PSMAs possessed relatively wide optical bandgaps of ∼1.65 eV along with high-lying lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. When blending with the polymer donor JD40, the PFFO-DTh-based device showed a PCE of 9.2% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.13 V, JSC of 13.7 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 59.5%. In contrast, the PFFO-Th-derived all-PSC device exhibited a slightly lower VOC of 1.11 V, but remarkably improved JSC of 15.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.1%, eventually affording a higher PCE of 10.8%. This was one of the highest PCEs for PSMA-based all-PSC devices with an outstanding VOC over 1.10 V. Systematic investigations were conducted which revealed that the higher efficiency of the PFFO-Th-based device could be ascribed to the synergic effect of better miscibility, stronger crystallinity and favorable molecular orientation, enabling superior charge dissociation, transport as well as extraction. This work demonstrates an effective approach to develop PSMAs with wide bandgaps via regulating the terminal group and confirms the significance of copolymerized spacers in improving the photovoltaic performance, eventually achieving a state-of-the-art VOC of 1.13 V for all-PSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh are illustrated in Scheme 1. Compound 1 underwent a one-step dehydration reaction to form the anhydride compound 2. The terminal unit FFOBr was synthesized by treating compound 2 with tert-butyl-3-oxopentanoate (Fig. S1 and S2†). Then a Knoevenagel condensation between TPT-DT-CHO and FFOBr afforded the monomer M-FFOBr (Fig. S3–S5†). PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh were synthesized by polymerizing M-FFOBr with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (DSn-Th) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (DSn-DTh), respectively. The structures of PFFO-Th, PFFO-DTh and polymer donor JD40 are depicted in Fig. 1a. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) were estimated to be 29.8 kDa and 1.94 for PFFO-Th, and 30.0 kDa and 2.38 for PFFO-DTh, respectively, which were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (Fig. S6 and S7†). Both PSMAs exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CF), and chlorobenzene (CB). Thermal properties of these two PSMAs were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both of them demonstrated good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 370 °C (Fig. S8a†). Besides, no visible phase transition appeared in DSC curves up to 310 °C (Fig. S8b†), which was critical to ensure their application in semiconductor devices.

The absorption properties of PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh were investigated in CF solutions and as thin films (Fig. 1b and c), the relevant results are summarized in Table 1. In solution, both PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh displayed an absorption band in the range of 500–750 nm with absorption coefficients >105 M−1 cm−1. In thin films, the absorption spectra of both polymers were red-shifted compared to those in solutions, suggesting the increased intermolecular interaction in the solid state.58 It was noted that PFFO-DTh exhibited slightly hypochromatically shifted absorption spectra in both solutions and as films compared to PFFO-Th, which is presumably because the stronger electron-donating capacity of bithiophene will weaken the electron-withdrawing capacity of the conjoint terminal unit and thereby slightly reduce the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. Moreover, the absorption onsets of 645, 761 and 753 nm in thin films were observed for JD40, PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh, respectively, corresponding to the optical bandgaps (Egopt) of 1.92 eV, 1.63 eV, and 1.65 eV. This is the first report on the development of a PSMA with a wide bandgap of ∼1.65 eV, demonstrating that terminal manipulation is a successful strategy for altering the electronic properties of PSMAs.

To evaluate the energy levels of the obtained polymers, cyclic voltammetry measurement was conducted. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were then calculated. As shown in Fig. 1d and S9,† the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were evaluated to be −5.60/−3.68 eV for PFFO-Th and −5.61/−3.65 eV for PFFO-DTh, respectively (Table 1). To further investigate the electronic structure and molecular geometry of both PSMAs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of molecular models were performed. As shown in Fig. S10,† both PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh showed planar molecular geometry for efficient π–π interactions, which might be advantageous for charge transfer and transport. Moreover, the simulated EHOMO/ELUMO was −5.58/−3.42 eV for PFFO-Th and −5.54/−3.39 eV for PFFO-DTh, showing that one more thiophene bridge can slightly upshift the LUMO levels, which is consistent with the CV measurement result. It is noteworthy that the indanone terminal in the absence of the cyano group can also guarantee both sufficient HOMO and LUMO offsets (ΔHOMOs/ΔLUMOs) over 0.3 eV between the selected polymer donor JD40 and polymer acceptors.59,60 Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer can be still achieved at the donor/acceptor interface, as revealed by the photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements (Fig. 1e). Note that the LUMO energy levels of the resulting acceptors are higher than that of the well-known N2200 by ≈0.25 eV, indicating that an increased VOC could be expected in all-PSC devices.61,62
Photovoltaic properties of all-PSCs based on PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh were investigated by fabricating devices with a conventional configuration: indium tin oxide(ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/JD40:PSMAs/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide]dibromide (PNDIT-F3N-Br)/Ag. The optimization details are shown in Tables S1–S3†. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a with the corresponding performance parameters summarized in Table 2. The PFFO-DTh-based device showed a high VOC of 1.13 V, JSC of 13.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.595, affording a PCE of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the PFFO-Th-based device delivered a VOC of 1.11 V, but a greatly improved JSC of 15.4 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.631, giving a higher PCE of 10.8%. Obviously, benefiting from the high-lying LUMO energy levels of the two PSMAs, outstanding VOC values over 1.10 V could be achieved for the fabricated all-PSCs. It is worth mentioning that it is one of the highest efficiencies for PSMA-based all-PSCs with VOC over 1.10 V, suggesting that regulation of the terminal unit may be a promising strategy to obtain high VOC for all-PSCs. Moreover, the superior efficiency of the PFFO-Th-based device further manifested the necessity of optimizing the linkage spacer in promoting the photovoltaic performance. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted to verify the JSC obtained for the related all-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the two all-PSC devices could achieve photo-current response in the range from 300 to 750 nm in the visible region, demonstrating that both polymer donors and acceptors in blend films could efficiently contribute to light harvesting and thus generating photocurrent. The EQE curve for the PFFO-Th-based device displayed slightly higher photon-response intensities, demonstrating its more efficient photoelectron conversion process. The integrated JSC values of PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh-derived devices were 14.7 mA cm−2 and 13.6 mA cm−2, respectively, matching well with the JSC values from the J–V tests with a deviation within 5% (Table 2).

To further investigate the detailed energy losses (ΔEloss) in the real solar cells, Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS-EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra measurements were characterized. It is well recognized that the ΔEloss is determined from three parts by applying detailed balance theory, as follows:ΔEloss = Eg − qVOC = (Eg − qVOCSQ) + (qVOCSQ − qVOCrad) + (qVOCrad − qVOC) = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3Here, ΔE1 stands for the radiative recombination loss above the bandgap, which inevitably exists in all types of solar cells. ΔE2 is from the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap. ΔE3 is non-radiative energy loss and correlates directly with the external radiative efficiency (EQEEL) of electroluminescence of the solar cells, following ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL). As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S4†, mainly due to the similar Eg values and similar absorptions below the bandgap, the two devices displayed the identical ΔE1 of 0.28 eV and ΔE2 of 0.06 eV. One can observe that due to the relatively lower EQEEL value, the all-PSC based on PFFO-Th exhibited slightly higher non-radiative energy loss (0.25 eV) than the PFFO-DTh-based one (0.23 eV). The increased non-radiative energy losses may be associated with the low-lying LUMO energy level of PFFO-Th in comparison with PFFO-DTh. Clearly, the incorporation of more electron-rich spacers can partly reduce ΔE3 and contribute to the lower ΔEloss and higher VOC of the all-PSCs.
To understand charge generation properties in the related devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are plotted. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent current densities measured under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Vbi − Vappl, where Vbi is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Vappl is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Jphs reached the saturated values before the Veff region at 2.0 V, indicating that the internal electric field is large enough to efficiently sweep out all charge carriers. The saturated photocurrent densities (Jsats) at Veff of ∼3.15 V are found to be 16.24 and 15.33 mA cm−2 for JD40:PFFO-Th and JD40:PFFO-DTh, respectively. Besides, saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) could be mainly determined by the generated charge carriers in the devices and the maximum charge generation rate (Gmax) can be calculated from the equation Gmax = Jsat/qL, where L is the thickness of thin films. The PFFO-Th-based device had a larger Gmax value of 1.01 × 1026 m−3 s−1 than the PFFO-DTh-based one (9.57 × 1025 m−3 s−1), manifesting the better exciton generation and dissociation process in the PFFO-Th-based device. Moreover, the charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T)s can be determined by calculating the specific values of Jph/Jsat. PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh-based devices yielded P(E,T) values of 94.8% and 89.4%, respectively, further notarizing the improved dissociation efficiencies of the PFFO-Th-based device, which agreed well with the JSC tendency in their devices. Additionally, the charge recombination behaviors of the all-PSCs were investigated by plotting JSC and VOCversus light intensity (Plight). The relationship between JSC and Plight can be fitted to a simple relationship JSC ∝ PlightS, where the fitted slope (S value) indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination. In the absence of any bimolecular recombination in the blend active layer, S should be 1; otherwise, it should be smaller than 1. As shown in Fig. 3b, the S values were 0.98 and 0.95 for PFFO-Th- and PFFO-DTh-based devices, respectively, thereby indicating the substantially suppressed bimolecular recombination in PFFO-Th-based devices, which was consistent with its higher JSC and FF. Besides, the geminate recombination loss can be determined from the dependence of VOC against Plight. The slope of the semi-log plot of VOCversus Plight can be calculated on the basis of the formula kT/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in K, and q represents the elementary charge. When the slope of VOCversus ln(Plight) is equal to 1 kT/q, the dominant recombination mechanism is bimolecular recombination; otherwise, more monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination exists. As shown in Fig. 3c, the slopes for JD40:PFFO-Th and JD40:PFFO-DTh were 1.23 kT/q and 1.47 kT/q, respectively. This result indicates that the JD40:PFFO-Th device shows smaller geminate recombination loss. The slope of 1.47 kT/q for PFFO-DTh therefore confirms the existence of monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination in the relevant devices, which may be one of the reasons for its limited FF below 60%. Furthermore, the charge carrier mobilities were also evaluated by using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S12 and Table S5†, the neat film of PFFO-Th displayed a higher electron mobility (μe) of 4.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with the 1.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of PFFO-DTh. When these two acceptors were blended with the polymer donor JD40, the PFFO-Th-based blend possessed a hole mobility (μh) of 2.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility (μe) of 3.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, both of which were higher than those of the PFFO-DTh-based blend. Moreover, the PFFO-Th-based blend shows a significantly smaller μh/μe ratio of 7.42 in comparison with the PFFO-DTh-based one (23.46). The higher and more balanced charge transport ability should be beneficial for reducing the space charge accumulation and recombination, and thus contributing to the higher JSC and FF values in the PFFO-Th-based device.

The PCE difference of PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh-based devices is mainly attributed to the variation in JSC and FF values, which are closely related to the polymer donor: polymer acceptor miscibility and film morphology. Therefore, the surface and bulk morphology features of the blend films were investigated by atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in Fig. 4a and b, root mean square (RMS) values of 1.45 nm and 1.75 nm were observed for JD40:PFFO-Th and JD40:PFFO-DTh blend films, respectively, suggesting a slightly superior miscibility between JD40 and PFFO-Th. Meanwhile, the TEM images also clearly revealed the phase separation of the blend films. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the crystalline phase of the PFFO-Th-based blend was composed of a smaller ordered needle-like microcrystal framework than the PFFO-DTh-based one. In “all-polymer” systems, such a morphology usually allowed a better D/A contact interface and charge transport tunnels, thus simultaneously improving charge generation and transport ability in devices, which were consistent with the observed results in SCLC tests.

The film crystallinity and polymer packing of the neat and blend films were investigated using 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS). The corresponding 2D GIWAXS images, and the correlated in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) line-cut curves of neat PSMA films and blend films are shown in Fig. 5a–f. In neat films, both the PSMAs exhibited strong 010 diffraction peaks at ≈1.67 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting predominant face-on orientations. However, PFFO-Th exhibited both higher intensities of (100) lamellar and (010) π–π stacking diffraction along the OOP direction (Fig. 5a and b). The calculative π–π stacking d-spacing of PFFO-Th (3.74 Å) was also smaller than that of PFFO-DTh (3.77 Å), indicating slightly tighter backbone packing for PFFO-Th. Moreover, for neat PSMA films, the crystal coherence length (CCL) of 010 diffraction in the OOP direction was estimated by the Scherrer equation to investigate the crystalline properties. As shown in Fig. S13,† a slightly higher CCL value of 16.92 Å was observed for PFFO-Th than that of PFFO-DTh (15.92 Å), thereby suggesting the better crystalline nature of PFFO-Th than PFFO-DTh. By mixing with the polymer JD40, both blend films showed enhanced face-on orientation as evidenced by the intensified π–π stacking (010) peak in the OOP direction (Fig. 5c and d). The π–π stacking intensity and d-spacing follow the trend observed in neat films. It was found that the highly intensive 100 diffraction peaks at 0.303 Å−1 and 0.299 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction emerged in PFFO-Th and PFFO-DTh-based blend films, which was attributed to the diffraction signals of the polymer donor JD40 with strong crystallization behavior by comparing with the diffraction pattern of the JD40 neat film (Fig. S14†). In addition, the obvious face-on orientation inherited from the neat films also confirmed the ordered phase crystallization from both the donor and acceptor. Despite these, a higher crystal coherence length (CCL) was also calculated for JD40:PFFO-Th (23.2 Å) compared to the JD40:PFFO-DTh film (21.3 Å) from the full width at half maximum of the OOP (010) peak, which thus led to better and balanced charge carrier transport properties in the related devices.63 Thus, these results confirmed that the screening of the copolymerization spacer is an effective method for fine-tuning the film microstructure and crystal packing.

Conclusion
In summary, two wide-bandgap PSMAs were designed by introducing a novel terminal unit without isomerization. The study reveals that the resulting polymers display high absorption coefficients and a relatively wide bandgap of ∼1.65 eV. Moreover, the newly incorporated terminal endows the PSMAs with high-lying LUMO energy levels above −3.70 eV. By blending with polymer donor JD40, both PSMAs could enable efficient all-PSC devices with high VOC over 1.10 V. Besides, with the screened copolymerized spacer, the PFFO-Th-based device exhibited a higher PCE of 10.8%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, a JSC of 15.4 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.631, benefiting by the favorable morphology, more ordered crystallization, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses in devices. To the best of our knowledge, to date, this is one of the highest PCE values for PSMA-based all-PSCs with VOC over 1.10 V. Our work provides an alternative strategy to construct efficient polymer acceptors with wide bandgaps by focusing on the exploration of the terminal unit.
