    , Accepted 13th July 2021First published on 13th July 2021AbstractThe potential of using non-planar triphenylimidazole-donor-based dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells was explored via synthesizing two novel dyes, LG-P1 and LG-P3, with D–D–π–A and D–A–π–A architectures, respectively. Anthracene and benzothiadiazole were used as the auxiliary donor and auxiliary acceptor units, respectively, in these newly designed sensitizers. The dyes were custom-designed to have a more positive ground state potential to make them compatible with a new-generation alternative copper electrolyte, [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+. We investigated various factors contributing to the variations in the photovoltaic performance upon the use of triphenylimidazole dyes with different auxiliary donor and acceptor units with [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte. Based on our observations, the triphenylimidazole dye having D–A–π–A architecture with benzothiadiazole as the auxiliary acceptor unit delivered better photovoltaic performance than the dye with anthracene as an auxiliary donor with D–D–π–A architecture. Electrical and optical perturbation methods were used to systematically probe the charge transfer and transport behaviours at the interfaces when employing these sensitizers.

Design, System, Application
Recombination is one of the prime rate-determining and performance-limiting processes in DSSCs, particularly when employing alternative redox mediators like copper under indoor illumination. As a general design principle, introducing dyes with non-planar donor units can help prevent this back electron-transfer via blocking the approach of oxidized species toward TiO2. Taking this into consideration, we designed two new organic sensitizers with wider bandgaps, suitable for use with copper electrolytes, using triphenylimidazole as the donor unit in D–D–π–A and D–A–π–A architectures, using anthracene and benzothiadiazole (BTD) as auxiliary donor and acceptor units. The variations in photovoltaic performance between the sensitizers were more pronounced under indoor light illumination. These details are useful for the custom modification of organic dyes for indoor photovoltaic applications, particularly when using alternative metal complex redox electrolytes like next-generation copper redox shuttles. Thus, the backbone engineering of organic dyes to minimize this back electron-transfer process is inevitably required to realize higher power conversion efficiencies under indoor/artificial illumination. This paper will serve as a guide for researchers working on new dye designs for dye-sensitized solar cells, particularly those involving next-generation alternative electrolytes and indoor photovoltaics.

1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a more promising solution than fossil fuels in the search for clean and renewable energy sources to address the rising demand for energy and environmental concerns.1–5 DSSCs have many advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, the potential for flexible molecular design, enormous material resources, accessible fabrication techniques, and the existence of transparent multifaceted options, they are a competent photovoltaic technology for harnessing solar energy.6–9 For the past three decades, the scientific community has reported a considerable number of DSSCs obtained via different strategies, viz., altering device components such as dyes, co-adsorbents, redox couples, electrode materials, and semiconducting metal oxides. With these strategies, DSSCs have shown a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5% using an organic dye with a Cu(II/I) redox couple and a test-cell PCE of 14.64% using metal-free organic dyes and a cobalt-based redox mediator.10–13 Among the various device components, the sensitizer and redox couple play significant roles in attaining higher device efficiency and durability. Widely used Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have disadvantages, such as a lack of absorption in the near-IR region, expensive and tedious synthetic protocols, and non-compatibility with metal complex redox mediators.14–16 For this reason, metal-free organic dyes are found to be the best alternatives as they offer large diversity in terms of molecular structures and they are easily synthesized via well-established design protocols in various configurations, such as donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A), donor–donor–π–acceptor (D–D–π–A), and donor–acceptor–π–acceptor (D–A–π–A) architectures.17–22 Many organic dyes based on triphenylamine,23–25 carbazole,26–28 and triphenylimidazole29 scaffolds have been used as dyes for DSSC applications based on these strategies.
In DSSCs, the selection of the electrolyte plays a vital role in enhancing the device characteristics, and several improvements have been made so far in this research area. The common electrolytes used in DSSCs are I3−/I− and Co(III/II) redox couples, but these electrolytes have disadvantages that limit the scaling-up of DSSCs.30–32 In the case of tri-iodide electrolytes, leakage and corrosion lead to destruction of device functionality over longer periods of time. Cobalt electrolytes have a larger size, which contributes to limitations relating to mass transport, recombination, and associated health hazards. These limitations were successfully circumvented upon the introduction of earth-abundant alternative copper-based redox electrolytes. Their low reorganization energies facilitate efficient dye regeneration, leading to high open-circuit voltage (Voc) values.30 Very recently, Cao et al. reported a PCE of 13% for a metal-free co-sensitized organic dye (Y123 co-sensitized with XY1b) using a [Cu(tmby)2]2+/+ (tmby = 4,4′,6,6′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) redox mediator under air mass 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 solar illumination.33 In addition, diffused ambient natural/artificial light is universally available everywhere (unlike direct sunlight), and it remains otherwise unused. DSSCs are particularly attractive for utilizing this. For instance, the aforementioned Y123-based DSSC (co-sensitized with XY1b) exhibited a remarkable PCE of 32% under white fluorescent tube light illumination (CFL, 1000 lux) with the same Cu(II/I) redox electrolyte. Therefore, DSSCs serve as an excellent commercial choice for specific indoor-light-harvesting markets, allowing wireless self-powered systems, smart grids, and energy-saving systems supporting self-powered IoT (internet of things) applications to meet the demands of a low-carbon economy.34,35
In the field of DSSCs, sensitizers and redox couples cover nearly 33.6% of the total research conducted. In this context, our aim in the present study is to evaluate the indoor and outdoor performances of dye-sensitized devices made using newly synthesized triphenylimidazole-donor-based dyes and a Cu(II/I) redox electrolyte. Here we have designed two new metal-free organic dyes, namely LG-P1 and LG-P3. Non-planar triphenylimidazole is used as the donor unit in these dyes, anthracene and benzothiadiazole (BTD) were used as auxiliary donor and acceptor units, a phenyl moiety acted as the π-spacer, and cyanoacrylic acid was an anchoring unit and acceptor (as shown in Chart 1). Both the anthracene and BTD moieties are highly planar conjugated units, improving the light-harvesting abilities due to π–π* and n–π* transitions, respectively.36,37 Additionally, these auxiliary donor and acceptor units are linked to the triphenylimidazole donor through a triple-bond linkage to maintain planarity, improve conjugation, and achieve better donor–acceptor interactions. Solar cells were fabricated using the LG-P1 and LG-P3 sensitizers, and photovoltaic performance was measured under both full-sun AM 1.5G irradiation and under indoor/ambient light illumination from a daylight light-emitting diode (LED) source, utilizing the [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ (dmp = bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)) redox couple. A detailed examination of the interfacial charge transfer process was carried out using transient decay spectroscopy, impedance measurements, charge extraction, and open-circuit voltage decay measurements to explain the origin of the variations in PCEs, their relationship with the molecular structures of the LG-P1 and LG-P3 sensitizers, and the compatibility with the copper electrolyte.

Methods

1H-NMR spectra were obtained at 400 MHz using a Bruker 400 Avance NMR spectrometer running X-WIN NMR software. Spectra were recorded either in chloroform-d (CDCl3) or in DMSO-d6, and the chemical shifts were taken relative to TMS (tetramethylsilane, Me4Si). Elemental analyses were performed using an Elementar Vario MICRO CUBE analyzer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed using Shimadzu Biotech Axima Performance apparatus (2.9.3.20110624; mode: Reflectron-HiRes; power: 85). Major fragmentations are given as percentages relative to the base peak intensity. Differential pulse voltammetric measurements were performed using a system-controlled CH Instruments electrochemical analyzer (model: CHI 620C). The experiments were performed using 1 mM sample solution in DCM solvent at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode is glassy carbon, a standard calomel electrode (SCE) is used as the reference electrode, and platinum wire is the counter electrode. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument was used for thermogravimetric measurements at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample.
Absorption studies were carried out using a Shimadzu (model: UV-3600) spectrophotometer at a concentration of 1 mM. Spex model Fluorolog-3 apparatus was used to record steady-state fluorescence spectra for solutions with an optical density at the excitation wavelength (λex) of ∼0.20. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer. Details of DFT calculations are given in the ESI.†
Device fabrication and characterization
Device fabrication was done as described elsewhere.40 A systematic protocol involving ultrasonic cleaning in detergent solution, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol was followed for cleaning the FTO substrates (TEC, 15 Ω cm−2, GreatCell Solar). The cleaned FTO substrates were annealed at 500 °C using pre-programed ramp heating (325 °C for 15 min; 375 °C for 15 min; 450 °C for 15 min; and 500 °C for 30 min). The annealed FTO substrates were treated with UV-ozone before being immersed in 53 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min for the deposition of the TiO2 pre-blocking layers. The deposited films were again subjected to the same programmed annealing up to 500 °C. The transparent TiO2 layer (18-NRT, GreatCell Solar) was deposited on FTO glass using a screen-printing technique followed by annealing at 100 °C. Further, the scattering layer (18 NR-AO, GreatCell Solar) was also deposited via screen printing, thereby producing an effective TiO2 layer thickness of ∼6 μm (measured using a profilometer (Bruker Dektak XT)). The electrodes were again annealed using the same program mentioned earlier. For the deposition of the post-blocking layer, the annealed electrodes were immersed in 53 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 70 °C and further heat-treated at 500 °C. The electrodes were then immersed in LG-P1 and LG-P3 dye solutions (0.3 mM in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol), respectively, and kept at room temperature for 16 h for effective dye loading. Pre-drilled counter electrodes (TEC, 7 Ω cm−2, GreatCell Solar) were cleaned using the same protocol for the photoanodes. The catalytic properties of the counter electrode were enhanced via the electrochemical deposition of PEDOT. The electrodes were then assembled using UV-curable epoxy. The space between the electrodes was filled with liquid [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte with the standard composition of 0.2 M bis-(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 0.04 M bis-(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(II)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide chloride, 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile. The holes were then sealed to avoid electrolyte leakage using cover glass.
Photocurrent density voltage (J–V) characterization of the fabricated solar cells was done under AM 1.5G simulated light with intensities of 10 to 100 mW cm−2 (0.1–1 sun conditions) using a class AAA solar simulator (Oriel 3A, Model PVIV-94043A, Newport) coupled with Keithley 2440 source meter. A 250 W xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator (Newport) was deployed for incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements of the devices. J–V measurements under indoor-light conditions were carried out using a custom-made setup with a daylight light-emitting diode (OsramDLLED, 1000 lux) as the light source. Advanced device characterizations like charge extraction (CE), open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained using an Autolab-PGSTAT 302 N (Metrohm) electrochemical workstation. For EIS studies, a frequency response analyzer (FRA32M) was coupled with the workstation. The EIS plots for various devices were recorded in the dark using bias potentials ranging from 0.35 to 0.75 V, perturbation with an amplitude of 10 mV, and frequencies ranging from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. OCVD measurements were performed using a white LED as the illumination source. Transient photovoltage and photocurrent decay measurements were performed using toolbox apparatus (Dyenamo), with light from a white LED as the bias source and modulation of less than 10% from the steady-state value.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis of dyes
Both D–D–π–A- and D–A–π–A-configuration-based sensitizers were synthesized as per the synthetic protocols illustrated in Scheme 1. The starting materials 1, 2, and 3 were synthesized as per methods reported in the literature.29,38,39 We have adopted Sonogashira coupling for the synthesis of the vital formyl intermediates 4 and 5 using a Pd catalyst. Finally, the respective LG-P1 and LG-P3 dyes were obtained via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction with cyanoacrylic acid, using piperidine as the catalyst. Preliminary characterization of both sensitizers was carried out using elemental, MALDI TOF-MS, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and IR analysis. The elemental analysis results are presented in the Experimental section and are found to be satisfactory. The presence of the molecular ion peak in the MALDI-MS spectra of both sensitizers confirms the presence of the relevant dyes (Fig. S9 and S12†). Further, the molecular integrities of both dyes are confirmed via1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and IR spectral analysis (Fig. S1–S12†).

Optical and redox properties
Evaluating the optical properties of both sensitizers is essential for better understanding the absorption of light when using the newly designed dyes. Fig. 1a and b displays the absorption spectra of both dyes in DCM solvent, and the corresponding spectroscopic data are presented in Table 1. As can be observed in Fig. 1a, the donor triphenylimidazole part of LG-P1 exhibits a prominent absorption peak in the UV region, at about 250 nm, and the peaks in the region of 400 to 500 nm belong to the absorption of the anthracene donor, which is attributed to π–π* transitions. In contrast, for the LG-P3 dye, we observe absorption bands from n–π* transitions at longer wavelengths with low molar extinction coefficients. These may involve intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions from donor triphenylimidazole to acceptor benzothiadiazole moieties. Further, we measured the absorption properties of both sensitizers in various solvents with different polarities to understand the effects of solvatochromism (Fig. S13†). As Fig. S13† suggests, the LG-P3 sensitizer does not exhibit any solvatochromism; as the polarity of the solvent increases, the absorption of the charge-transfer band shifted bathochromically.27 DCM solution emission measurements were carried out at room temperature upon excitation at 410 nm. LG-P1 and LG-P3 dyes showed emission maxima at 628 nm and 492 nm, respectively (Fig. 1c). The emission intensities of both dyes were quenched when adsorbed on TiO2 film. The singlet-state lifetimes of both the LG-P1 and LG-P3 dyes in DCM were estimated from the fluorescence decay curves (λex = 410 nm) and found to be 4.53 ns and 3.24 ns, respectively (Fig. 1d), and the excited-state lifetimes were quenched when adsorbed on TiO2 film. The quenching of steady-state and excited-state lifetimes on TiO2 might be due to photoinduced electron transfer from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The singlet-state energies (E0–0), calculated from the emission and excitation spectra, were found to be 2.65 and 2.53 eV for LG-P1 and LG-P3, respectively.

In order to evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility of the electron transfer processes in these sensitizers and to assess the energy levels, we measured the redox potentials of both sensitizers via conducting differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments. Fig. 2a illustrates the DPV results for both sensitizers and the respective redox potential data are presented in Table 1. Both sensitizers exhibit a quasi-reversible oxidation peak at ∼1.30 V vs. SCE and are more positive compared to the Cu(II/I) redox mediator. The expression  = EOX − E0–0 is used to assess the excited-state oxidation potential () levels of both the dyes, and they were found to be −1.36 and −1.30 V for LG-P1 and LG-P3, respectively. These measurements further suggest that  is more negative than the TiO2 conduction band (−0.57 V vs. NHE)41 and the EOX energy level is more positive than the redox potential of the Cu(II/I) redox system.31

Theoretical studies
The structural, electronic, and optical properties of both the D–D–π–A and D–A–π–A dyes were explained using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using the Gaussian 09 program package with the B3LYP/6-31 G(d,p) level functional basis set. Fig. 3a illustrates the ground-state optimized structures of both dyes, in which the three phenyl rings of the donor triphenylimidazole give non-planarity to both the metal-free organic dyes. This leads to the minimization of aggregation of both dyes in solution. Fig. 3b and Table S1† suggest that the HOMO of LG-P1 is distributed on the donor triphenylimidazole and anthracene moieties. However, in the case of LG-P3, the HOMO is located mainly on the donor triphenylimidazole. The LUMO is delocalized over the π-spacer (phenyl) and cyanoacrylic acid anchor in the case of the LG-P1 dye. In contrast, in the case of LG-P3, it is delocalized over the acceptor (benzothiadiazole moiety), π-spacer (phenyl), and cyanoacrylic acid anchor, which is very important for efficient electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer to the conduction band of TiO2. The HOMO–LUMO gap of the LG-P1 dye is found to be 2.65 eV and for the LG-P3 dye this is 2.53 eV. In addition, we subjected the dyes to single-point TD-DFT studies (the first 10 vertical singlet-singlet transitions were used to obtain the UV-vis spectra of these dyes, see Fig. 1a and b) with THF as the solvent with the CPCM framework using the CAM-B3LYP function. The obtained values are in agreement with the experimental values. The calculated vertical excitation energies for the singlet excited states together with the calculated oscillator strengths are listed in Table S1.†Fig. 3 also demonstrates electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of both sensitizers, in which the positive electrostatic potential was at the donor triphenylimidazole, while the negative potential was concentrated at the anchoring cyanoacrylic acid group. Further, the theoretical values of the dipole moments of LG-P1 and LG-P3 dyes were estimated to be 4.16 D and 7.88 D, respectively. The greater dipole moment along the path for LG-P3 could result in more negative charge near the TiO2 surface than for LG-P1, resulting in a larger TiO2 conduction band (CB) upshift in the case of the LG-P3-based DSSC, which is advantageous for an increase in Voc. Moreover, the dihedral angle between the anthracene (auxiliary donor) and phenyl groups in the LG-P1 dye was estimated to be 108.04° while that between BTD (auxiliary acceptor) and the phenyl moiety in LG-P3 dye was only 32.61°, indicating a more twisted structure in the case of the LG-P1 dye with a D–D–π–A structure. This twisted conformation prevents efficient donor–acceptor interactions in the D–D–π–A LG-P1 dye, resulting in inferior absorption compared to the D–A–π–A LG-P3 dye.

Photovoltaic measurements and analysis
The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs employing both newly synthesized dyes were measured in detail along with the Cu(II/I) redox couple [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ under similar test-cell conditions. Details relating to device fabrication and characterization are provided in the Experimental section. Fig. 4a illustrates the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of triphenylimidazole dye (LG-P1 and LG-P3) based DSSCs under one sun illumination, and their respective PV parameters are presented in Table 2. The D–A–π–A sensitizer LG-P3 with benzothiadiazole as an auxiliary acceptor showed better photovoltaic performance than the LG-P1 sensitizer with anthracene as the auxiliary donor with D–D–π–A architecture. The device based on LG-P3 showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 ± 0.05 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.81 ± 0.12 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.5 ± 2.16%, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.96 ± 0.06%. In contrast, the LG-P1-based device displayed a Voc of 0.47 ± 0.05 V, Jsc of 1.52 ± 0.12 mA cm−2 and FF of 41.1 ± 2.16%, contributing to a PCE of 0.29 ± 0.06%. It is clear from the J–V data that the D–A–π–A dye (LG-P3) based device exhibited better Voc and Jsc values, according to the corresponding absorption spectra (see Fig. S13†). The IPCE response of the LG-P3 dye is more than 50% higher than the LG-P1 dye over the entire wavelength region (Fig. 4b). With a more planar backbone, the LG-P3 dye contributed to better donor–acceptor interactions between the triphenylimidazole donor and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, resulting in a more suitable and broader IPCE spectrum being shown by the LG-P3 dye, which contributed to its better Jsc value.

In addition to this, we measured the J–V characteristics of the fabricated solar cells under lower light intensities of 0.5 and 0.1 sun (50 mW cm−2 and 10 mW cm−2), and the obtained device parameters are presented in Table S2.† The photovoltaic performances of the devices were also measured under indoor illumination, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 3. Under 1000 lux daylight LED illumination, the D–A–π–A sensitizer LG-P3 exhibited better performance, with a PCE of 9.14%, owing to its higher Voc (0.52 V), Jsc (99 μA cm−2), and FF (56.9%) values compared to the D–D–π–A LG-P1 sensitizer, which only delivered a PCE of 0.13% with a Voc of 0.03 V, Jsc of 59 μA cm−2, and FF of 26%. This shows that the D–A–π–A sensitizer LG-P3 with a BTD auxiliary acceptor proved to be a better candidate for outdoor as well as indoor photovoltaic applications.

The reasons for the reduced open-circuit potential (Voc) in the LG-P1 dye-based device were studied in detail using dark current and intensity-dependent measurements. The Voc value of a DSSC is determined based on the difference between the Fermi level of the semiconductor (EF) and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox). EF mainly depends on the conduction band edge and the charge density accumulated on the semiconductor. The dark I–V plots (Fig. 5a) show that the LG-P1-dye-based device showed a larger dark current, indicating higher recombination in the LG-P1 device than the LG-P3 device. This resulted in a lower Voc for LG-P1-based solar cells compared to those based on LG-P3. The light intensity (Iin) dependence of Voc was measured (Fig. 5b) to probe the contributions of trap states to the recombination process. The slope of the Vocvs. logIin plot is given by (dVOC)/(dlogIin) = (2.303 KbT)/βq, where Kb is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the electronic charge, and β is the inverse of the diode ideality factor. An ideal β value of 1 indicates that recombination occurs primarily based on the conduction band of TiO2. The slope of a Vocvs. logIin plot ought to be 59 mV per decade in such systems.42,43 Any deviation of the β value from unity indicates the contribution of trap states to recombination. The β values calculated for LG-P1- and LG-P3-based devices are 0.22 and 0.81, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5b. The more significant deviation of LG-P1-based devices from ideal behavior indicates the existence of higher trap-state-mediated recombination in LG-P1 dye devices.

Further, to identify the role that conduction band shifts may play in the variations of photovoltaic parameters, charge extraction (CE) measurements were carried out on devices fabricated using both sensitizers. From the CE plots, as shown Fig. 6a, a positive shift in the TiO2 conduction band (CB) was observed for the D–D–π–A-structured LG-P1-based device with respect to the D–A–π–A LG-P3-based device. This shift in the CB may be attributed to differences in the dipole moments of the D–D–π–A dye (LG-P1) and D–A–π–A dye (LG-P3). A positive shift in the CB edge of TiO2 leads to an increase in the number of trap states overlapping with the energy states of the oxidized electrolyte species, resulting in increased recombination in LG-P1-based devices.44,45 This complements the β values calculated for the LG-P1- and LG-P3-based devices (Fig. 5(b)), suggesting that higher levels of surface-trap-state-mediated recombination take place in LG-P1-sensitized solar cells. The increase in recombination in the case of LG-P1 was also evident from the lifetime (τn) plots obtained from OCVD measurements (Fig. 6(b)). The smaller lifetime for LG-P1 relative to the LG-P3-based device is a consequence of enhanced recombination in the former. This enhanced recombination also contributed towards the decreased FF of the LG-P1-based device. The lifetime results obtained from EIS measurements (Fig. 7(a)) and transient photovoltage measurements (Fig. 7(b)) also exhibit the same trend as the OCVD measurements. Representative Nyquist and Bode plots for LG-P1- and LG-P3-based devices obtained from EIS measurements under dark conditions are given in Fig. S14.† Lifetimes were calculated from the Bode plots based on the formula τn = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the frequency corresponding to the peak phase. The larger semicircle in the Nyquist plot, in the mid-frequency range, corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. This semicircle is smaller for the LG-P1-based device compared to the LG-P3-based one, indicating that even the twisted structure of the D–D–π–A dye is ineffective at hindering the recombination of electrons from conduction band and sub-bandgap states with oxidized species in the electrolyte. The D–A–π–A LG-P3 dye with more planar architecture provides effective π-conjugation, as evident from the DFT studies, leading to better electron injection from the dye excited state to the TiO2 conduction band compared to the D–D–π–A LG-P1 dye. This better injection from LG-P3 might also contribute to the higher IPCE value exhibited by LG-P3.46 Thus, compared to the LG-P1 dye, the LG-P3 dye with a more negatively placed CB, better electron lifetime, and higher electron concentration in the TiO2 layer contributes towards a better voltage. In addition to the better lifetime, LG-P3-based devices are endowed with faster electron diffusion, which is evident from the diffusion coefficient (Dn) plots (Fig. 7(c)) measured using transient photocurrent decay measurements. The corresponding transport time (τd) values are depicted in Fig. S15,† from which Dn is calculated using the relationship Dn = d2/τd, where d is the thickness of the TiO2 layer (∼6 μm). Faster diffusion and, hence, a lower τd value in the LG-P3-based device may be attributed to the more significant gradient of electronic charge created across the TiO2 layer, owing to the better injection capabilities of the LG-P3 dye, as mentioned before. The better lifetime and lower transport time contributed to the better charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of the LG-P3-dye-based device in comparison to LG-P1 (Fig. 7(d)).

Hence, the better IPCE and PCE values for the LG-P3-based solar cells compared to those using LG-P1 can be attributed not only to the better absorption profile and ηinj value owing to the planar geometry of the D–A–π–A dye but also to the enhanced ηcc value, allowing a higher Jsc value for the D–A–π–A LG-P3 dye. The variations in the photovoltaic performances of both sensitizers were more clear under indoor light illumination. This shows the need for the custom modification of organic dyes for indoor photovoltaic applications, particularly when using alternative metal complex redox electrolytes like new-generation copper redox shuttles. Dyes that are more capable of arresting recombination (bulk and surface), including trap-assisted recombination, play a critical role in determining the performances of dye-sensitized solar cells under low intensity indoor/artificial light conditions. Thus, the backbone engineering of organic dyes to minimize these back electron-transfer processes is inevitably required in order to realize higher power conversion efficiencies under indoor/artificial illumination.
4. Conclusions
Recombination is one of the prime rate-determining and performance-limiting processes in DSSCs, particularly when employing alternative redox mediators like copper-based examples. As a general design principle, introducing dyes with non-planar donor units can help prevent this back electron-transfer via blocking the approach of oxidized species toward TiO2. Taking this into consideration, we designed two new organic sensitizers with wider bandgaps suitable for use with a copper electrolyte using triphenylimidazole as the donor unit with D–D–π–A (LG-P1) and D–A–π–A (LG-P3) architectures. The D–A–π–A dye LG-P3, using BTD as an auxiliary acceptor, proved to be a better candidate for DSSCs employing the [Cu(dmp)2]1+/2+ electrolyte (PCE of 1.96% under full sun and 9.14% under 1000 lux DL-LED illumination) compared to the LG-P1 dye with D–D–π–A architecture (PCE of 0.29% under full sun and 0.13% under 1000 lux DL-LED illumination). A DSSC based on the LG-P3 dye with a D–A–π–A structure exhibited a better PCE owing to its enhanced Voc, Jsc, and FF values compared to the LG-P1 dye with a D–D–π–A structure. The enhanced Voc value was mainly attributed to the negatively shifted CB and lower levels of recombination, which provided better lifetimes for devices employing the LG-P3 dye with more coplanar geometry than LG-P1. Recombination from trap states was also prominent in the case of the LG-P1 dye, as seen from the deviation of the recombination parameter (β) from unity. Again, the more planar geometry and better conjugation of the D–A–π–A LG-P3 dye contributed to its better photon absorption, injection, and charge collection efficiencies, resulting in an improved IPCE profile and Jsc value. Triphenylimidazole proved to be a potential donor unit for use in organic dyes, and it has been proven to be compatible with alternative copper electrolytes; however, further modifications in relation to molecular design need to be carried out to improve the light-harvesting capabilities of these dyes. Simultaneously, with a better absorption profile in the near-UV-visible region and superior capabilities to prevent electron recombination, the LG-P3 dye offers the possibility for use as an efficient co-sensitizer in dye cocktail solutions, leading to better light harvesting in the visible region, specifically for indoor photovoltaic applications, and this will be explored in the future.

Design, System, Application
Recombination is one of the prime rate-determining and performance-limiting processes in DSSCs, particularly when employing alternative redox mediators like copper under indoor illumination. As a general design principle, introducing dyes with non-planar donor units can help prevent this back electron-transfer via blocking the approach of oxidized species toward TiO2. Taking this into consideration, we designed two new organic sensitizers with wider bandgaps, suitable for use with copper electrolytes, using triphenylimidazole as the donor unit in D–D–π–A and D–A–π–A architectures, using anthracene and benzothiadiazole (BTD) as auxiliary donor and acceptor units. The variations in photovoltaic performance between the sensitizers were more pronounced under indoor light illumination. These details are useful for the custom modification of organic dyes for indoor photovoltaic applications, particularly when using alternative metal complex redox electrolytes like next-generation copper redox shuttles. Thus, the backbone engineering of organic dyes to minimize this back electron-transfer process is inevitably required to realize higher power conversion efficiencies under indoor/artificial illumination. This paper will serve as a guide for researchers working on new dye designs for dye-sensitized solar cells, particularly those involving next-generation alternative electrolytes and indoor photovoltaics.
