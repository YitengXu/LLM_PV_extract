    , Accepted 1st October 2012First published on 9th October 2012AbstractA dual mode rare-earth based oxide phosphor (Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4), demonstrating both down conversion (DC) and upconversion (UC) emission, has been developed using a facile solid state reaction method which can be easily scaled-up for large quantities. In the DC studies, the material exhibits a strong blue emission with a long decay time (4.36 μs), corresponding to the charge transfer band of [NbO4]3− under UV excitation (262 nm), and a green emission of the Er3+ ions under blue (379 nm) excitation. Furthermore, it has been noticed that under infrared (976 nm) excitation, this phosphor shows strong green and red emission along with relatively weak emission bands in the UV-blue and IR regions, which confirm the compatibility of this phosphor for UC too. In the UC emission, the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion portray a temperature dependent behaviour and have been used for temperature sensing (optical thermometry) using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) method. The maximum sensitivity is found to be 0.0073 K−1 at 473 K, which is better in comparison with other host matrixs reported so far. The results suggest that this dual mode phosphor could be an exceptional choice for next generation luminescence-based temperature sensing devices as well as in advanced display devices.
1. Introduction
Recently, enormous attention has been paid to lanthanide doped (down/up conversion) phosphors in the field of physics, chemistry, material science and life science because of their broad potential applications in our daily life e.g. colour displays, optoelectronics, sensor technology, laser cooling, luminescent solar collectors (LSC), bio-imaging and security applications.1–7 Optical transitions in these lanthanide doped phosphors involve the 4f orbitals, which are well shielded from their local environment by the completely filled 5s and 5p outer orbitals and thus give unique optical features e.g. long lifetime (ms and μs order) and narrow line width (FWHM ∼ 10 nm) emissions, etc.1–7 However, due to the low absorption cross section of lanthanide ions, a direct excitation into the 4f level results in poor luminescence efficiency. The efficiency could be enhanced through sensitization processes, most popularly either through charge transfer band (CTB) excitation or through energy transfer (ET) processes.7 Both processes are very sensitive to the host lattice, which inspires researchers to develop suitable host materials for next generation smart temperature sensing devices and many other optical device applications.
Among the variety of available host matrices, the compounds belonging to the ABO4 (A = La, Y, Gd; B = V, P, Nb) family are of great importance as the host itself sensitizes the doped lanthanide ions through CTB excitation and ET processes. The properties of lanthanide doped YVO4, YPO4 and LaPO4 have been extensively investigated.8–12 However, YNbO4, another compound of this family, is not well explored. In the YNbO4 host lattice, the niobium atom can be considered to be tetrahedrally coordinated to the oxygen atoms in a highly distorted site. The niobate groups, [NbO4]3−, in the matrix act as fluorescence centers and produce a blue emission when activated by ultra-violet (UV) radiation.13–18 The substitution of the Y3+ ions by other lanthanide ions (e.g. Eu3+, Sm3+, Dy3+etc.) in YNbO4 produces a blue and red emitting phosphor through normal fluorescence process, also called downconversion (DC).15,16 It is well known that a YNbO4 host has a lower phonon frequency (∼660 cm−1) compared to other members in the family.18 This low phonon frequency of the host introduces the possibility for upconversion (UC) processes (UC describes a nonlinear optical process in which low energy photons are used to generate high-energy photons, usually infrared radiation is used to generate visible and UV light), which makes this material promising for many other novel applications, such as UC lasers, infrared imaging, fluorescence labeling and in the enhancement of the efficiency of solar cells, etc.19–23 But, to the best of our knowledge, hardly any reports on UC studies for a YNbO4 host are available. Furthermore, the decay characteristics of the charge transfer band emission of YNbO4 is not explored to date to the best of our knowledge.
Here, we explore the efficacy of the YNbO4 host matrix for UC emission and develop a dual mode phosphor which possesses both UC and DC emission. We have chosen Yb3+/Er3+ lanthanide ions for this as they are a well known couple which give strong UC emission in other hosts and give green emission through DC processes as well. The phosphor samples have been synthesized using a conventional solid state reaction method. The Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 results in strong visible emission through UC (green and red emission under IR excitation) as well as by DC (blue emission under 262 nm excitation and green emission under 379 nm excitation) processes. The DC emission is also observed through an energy transfer (ET from the YNbO4 host to Er3+) process. The 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion in the UC emission show a temperature dependent behaviour and have been used for optical thermometry using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) method. The temperature sensing behaviour has been measured from 300 to 573 K and the maximum sensitivity is found to be 0.0073 K−1 at 473 K. The sensitivity of the temperature sensor developed in the present investigation has been compared with previous work on other materials and it is found that the sensitivity of our sensor is slightly better than those reported in the literature.24–31 Furthermore, since the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor has strong blue emission with a long decay time during DC and strong green UC emission (showing temperature dependence), which is very stable up to to the measured temperature i.e. 573 K this phosphor has significant potential for use in display devices and especially for the development of high sensitivity temperature sensors in a wide temperature range.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Analytical reagent (AR) grade yttrium oxide (Y2O3, 99.99%, Himedia), niobium pentaoxide (Nb2O5, 99.95%, Himedia), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3, 99.9%, Aldrich) and erbium oxide (Er2O3, 99.9%, Aldrich) were used for the synthesis of the pure and lanthanide (Yb3+/Er3+) doped yttrium niobate phosphors.
2.2 Synthesis of the YNbO4 and Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphors
Phosphor samples (YNbO4 and Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4) were prepared by a solid state reaction method. Stoichiometric mixing of various constituents was carried out using a ball mill (Retsch, Germany) with zirconia jars and zirconia balls. AR grade acetone was used as the mixing media. After homogeneous mixing, the samples were dried at 343 K overnight. The dried samples were calcined at an optimized temperature of 1623 K for 2 h in an alumina crucible using a globar furnace. Finally, the samples were transformed into fine powders and kept in sealed packets for further characterizations.
2.3 Characterization
Phase identification was carried out using an 18 kW Cu rotating anode-based high resolution Rigaku X-ray powder (XRD) diffractometer fitted with a curved crystal monochromator in the diffracted beam. Data were obtained from 2θ = 5° to 100° at a scanning speed of 2° min−1. The surface morphology was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a ZEISS (SEM-Supra40 model) SEM operated at 20 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) attached to the SEM was used for elemental studies. Before the experiment, the sample was sputter coated with gold to avoid charging.
A Flouromax-4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrophotometer was used for the excitation and DC emission measurements. UC emission spectra were recorded by exciting the sample with a 976 nm diode laser (CW, 2 W, power tunable) using an iHR320 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrometer equipped with an R928P photon counting photo multiplier tube (PMT). For luminescence measurements at different temperatures, the sample was prepared in the form of a pellet (12 mm in diameter, 0.5 mm thick) and the laser was focused near one edge of the pellet (instead of its centre) and a thermocouple was placed close (within ∼4 mm) to the focal spot. The lifetime measurements were carried out using an Edinburgh luminescence spectrometer (model F900) equipped with a microsecond xenon flash lamp as the source of excitation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural studies
The X-ray diffraction pattern reveals that the yttrium niobate prepared at 1473 K (shown in Fig. S1a of the ESI†) has two phases. The primary phase is YNbO4 whereas the secondary phase is Y3NbO7. In the XRD pattern, peaks corresponding to YNbO4 (International centre for diffraction data (ICDD): 01-083-1319) and Y3NbO7 (ICDD: 00-036-1353) have been marked with a circle and asterisk, respectively. As the calcination temperature is increased from 1473 K to 1623 K, the XRD peaks corresponding to the Y3NbO7 phase disappear and a single phase YNbO4 phosphor is formed (shown in Fig. S1b, ESI†).
In order to obtain the crystallographic information (lattice parameters, atomic positions and atomic distances) we carried out Rietveld refinement of the YNbO4 and Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphors (shown in Fig. 1a and 1b) using the crystal structure refinement program ‘FULLPROF’.32 The refined atomic position and the occupancy data along with the lattice parameters are presented in Table 1. Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 crystallizes in monoclinic structure (inset in Fig. 1a) with space group of C2/c (15) and lattice constants of a = 7.6176(1) Å, b = 10.9454(2) Å, c = 5.2967(1) Å and β = 138.4308(8). All the observed peaks satisfy the reflection condition. The cell volume of Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 is a little higher than that of YNbO4 because the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions have higher ionic radii than Y3+.

The SEM image, shown in Fig. 1c, reveals that the average particle size of the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor is in the order of microns. The EDX spectrum of the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor, shown in Fig. 1d, has lines corresponding to Yb, Er besides Y, Nb and O signals, at the molar ratio, which is consistent with the formula composition (for more details please see Table S1 in the ESI†). This confirms the stoichiometric compound formation.
3.2 Spectroscopic studies of the downconversion (DC) phosphor

3.2.1 Excitation, emission and decay dynamics of the blue emission in YNbO4. 
YNbO4 is a self-activated phosphor. The valence band states of YNbO4 mostly consist of oxygen 2p-like states whereas the conduction band states mostly consist of Nb 4d-like states.14 Therefore, the lowest optical transition of YNbO4 can be considered as ligand (oxygen) to metal (Nb) charge transfer transitions.17 The ground state of Nb5+ is 1A1, and the excited states are 3T2, 3T1, 1T1, and 1T2. The order of these levels is 1T2 > 1T1 > 3T2 ≥ 3T1.17 The excitation spectrum, measured by monitoring the emission at 417 nm, reveals two excitation bands with maxima at 262 nm and 305 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. These bands may attributed to the 1A1 → 1T2 and 1A1 → 1T1 transitions in YNbO4 (shown in Fig. 3), as Lee et al.17 reported that 1A1 → 1T2 is an allowed electric dipole transition whereas the other transitions (1T1 → 1A1, 3T2 → 1A1 and 3T1 → 1A1) also have some non-vanishing transition probability. The excitation band at 262 nm is well known in the host14–16 whereas the band at 305 nm has only been observed by Shin et al.14 using a pulse excitation source. After excitation at 262 nm and 305 nm, transitions from the 3T2 and 3T1 excited level to the ground state 1A1 occur and give broad blue emission bands with maxima at 417 nm and 450 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a and 3. The insets (I and II) to Fig. 3 show the digital photographs of the phosphor before and after UV light exposure, respectively. The intense blue colour under the UV light exposure indicates an efficient phosphor. The CIE (international commission on illumination) coordinate for the YNbO4 emission (shown in the inset of Fig. 2b) is found to be (0.16, 0.06) and (0.17, 0.19) on excitation at 262 and 305 nm, respectively.

The decay behaviour of the YNbO4 emission was studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. The decay characteristics of the [NbO4]3− emission at 417 nm was recorded by exciting YNbO4 at 262 nm using a time-correlated single-photon counting technique (shown in Fig. 2b). The decay curve of this transition was fitted into a single-exponential function as:I(t) = Aexp(−t/τ),where, τ is the decay lifetime of the luminescence and A is the weighting parameter. The observed lifetime is found to be 4.36 μs, which is quite large. The large decay time of this transition helps in an efficient ET from this level to the resonance level of the doped lanthanide (Er3+) ion.


3.2.2 Excited state energy transfer from [NbO4]3− to Er3+ in Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4. 

Fig. 4a shows the excitation spectrum of the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor observed by monitoring the emission for the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ions (at 553 nm). The excitation spectrum shows peaks corresponding to characteristic transitions of the Er3+ ions as well as a CT band of [NbO4]3−. This suggests that the Er3+ ions can be directly excited by excitation into its 4f excited levels or by exciting the CT band of the host lattice. Direct excitation of the Er3+ ions using 379 nm radiation gives a characteristic emission of Er3+ ions, resulting in a green colour. However, when it is excited with 262 nm radiation, it is the CT band ([NbO4]3−) which is excited. The CT band absorbs the excitation energy through the O2− → Nb5+ charge transfer transition and gives a broad band emission (charge transfer luminescence of the niobate group) along with characteristic line emission of the Er3+ ions (shown in Fig. 4b). From Fig. 4a and b, it is clear that the emission spectrum of YNbO4 substantially overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the Er3+ ions. This suggests that when the CT band of YNbO4 is excited, some part of the energy transfers to Er3+. The ET is also supported through lifetime analysis. The lifetime analysis shows that in the presence of Er3+ ions in YNbO4 (i.e. in Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4), the emission corresponding to its CT band decay shortens (from 4.36 to 3.61 μs) i.e. the lifetime decreases. The energy transfer process in the same host but synthesized through a combustion route seems slightly more efficient compared to the present work.15 It is difficult to explore the exact reason behind this. The crystallographic information suggests that the phosphor explored by Zhou et al.15 has two phases (monoclinic + tetragonal). It is expected that in the case of the tetragonal structure, the distance between Nb–Y/Er is shorter compared to the monoclinic structure and this may be responsible for the better energy transfer efficiency. Obviously, several other parameters may be responsible for the energy transfer and needs to be investigated through more detailed time-domain spectroscopy.

3.3 Spectroscopic studies of the upconversion (UC) phosphor

3.3.1 Upconversion emission of Er3+ in Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4. 
The UC emission spectrum of the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor (λex = 976 nm) measured at room temperature is shown in Fig. 5a. The UC emission intensity is very strong in the green region followed by red emission. In addition, UC emission is also observed in the UV-blue (300–500 nm) and infrared regions (800–900 nm) but their intensity is rather weak, as shown in insets I–III of Fig. 5a. Because of the crystalline nature of the matrix (YNbO4), crystal field splitting also plays a role and all the emission bands show large Stark splitting. The UC emission bands are observed at 322 nm, 357 nm, 382 nm, 409 nm, 484 nm, 497 nm, 526 nm, 557 nm, 668 nm and 800 nm, corresponding to 4G9/2 → 4I13/2, 4G7/2 → 4I15/2, 4G11/2 → 4I15/2, 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 4F3/2 → 4I15/2, 4F5/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion, respectively. In the Yb3+/Er3+ substituted phosphor, the Yb3+ ions acts as a sensitizer for the Er3+ emission on 976 nm excitation.

(b) The ln I (intensity of the UC emission) versus ln P (applied laser input power) plot. The slope of these curves (n) gives the number of photons involved in a particular UC process of different bands. (c) CIE chromaticity diagram at different laser input powers. (d) Schematic energy level diagram showing the mechanism involved in the UC emissions. 
In the UC emission, the ln I–ln P plot, between the input (excitation) power and emission intensities of the different bands, tells us about the number of incident photons involved in a particular UC transition. This also helps in determining the excitation mechanisms involved in the UC process. For the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor (see Fig. 5b), the slope for the bands at 526 nm, 557 nm and 668 nm was observed to be 2.07, 1.89 and 1.79, respectively, which confirms the involvement of 2 photons for the red and green emissions. The emission intensity of the bands shows saturation-like behaviour and the slope decreases from ∼2 to ∼1 at higher input laser powers. It has already been reported that increasing the pump power does not increase the UC emission at the same rate and the slope of the ln I–ln P plot changes.22 We call this a saturation of the slope. This saturation of the slope affects the perception of colour in the overall emission. The intensity of the green emission dominates over the intensity of the other bands, which gives a pure green colour in UC. Fig. 5c shows the CIE chromaticity diagram, which is used to study the perception of colour in terms of mathematically defined colour spaces. It is observed that initially, a low laser power (250 mW) emission gives a yellowish green colour perception with coordinates of (0.3, 0.6). However, as the laser input power is increased, the green colour dominates. For powers above 0.5 W, a pure green emission with coordinates of (0.28, 0.7) is observed. A further increase in the power does not affect the colour coordinates substantially. A power dependence study for the transitions in the blue and UV regions was not possible due to comparatively weak intensities. However, the involvement of three and four photons can be satisfactorily understood on the basis of the schematic energy level diagram shown in Fig. 5d.


3.3.2 Energy level diagram and mechanism for the UC emission. 
The complete UC process involved in the different UC emissions is shown schematically in the partial energy level diagram in Fig. 5d. Radiation at 976 nm excites the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions resonantly to their excited states through a ground state absorption (GSA) process. Since Er3+ has a low absorption cross section, the GSA process is very weak for Er3+. In order to sensitize the emission of Er3+, Yb3+ ions are co-doped into the system. The absorption cross section of the Yb3+ ion (11.7 × 10−21 cm2) is nearly 7 times higher compared to the Er3+ ion (1.7 × 10−21 cm2). Moreover, the concentration of the Yb3+ ions is also high (∼7 times in the present case). Thus, most of the incident energy is absorbed by the Yb3+ ions which is later transferred to Er3+via different energy transfer (ET) processes. Details of the different types of ET processes from Yb3+ to Er3+ have already been reported in many reviews.23 Furthermore, the absorption of incident photon energy in the excited state (ESA) promotes Er3+ to different, higher levels (viz. to 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 on the absorption of a second photon, to 4G7/2 levels on the absorption of a third photon and to 4G9/2 on the absorption of fourth photons). Then, the different lower lying emitting levels are populated by nonradiative relaxations and transitions from them are observed, as shown in Fig. 5d.

3.4 Effect of temperature on the UC emission and temperature sensor behaviour
A fluorescence-based temperature sensing technique uses the temperature-dependent fluorescence properties of luminescence materials. It can overcome the strong electromagnetic noise, hazardous sparks as well as a corrosive environment, which are inaccessible by traditional temperature-measurement methods like thermocouple detectors, etc.33–35 It is basically comprised of two types, one based on the temperature-dependent fluorescence lifetime and the other on the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR). We have used an FIR technique to study the temperature sensing. Here, the fluorescence from two closely spaced levels (thermally coupled levels) to a common final (ground) state is monitored and the ratio of the two emission intensities is calculated as a function of temperature. In the case of the Er3+ ions, the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels are close to each other (∼500–600 cm−1) and are thermally coupled. Therefore, the FIR of the fluorescence arising from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the ground state of Er3+ has been used to study the temperature sensor behaviour in the temperature range of 300–573 K.

Fig. 6a shows the green UC emission spectra of the Er3+/Yb3+ ion substituted YNbO4 phosphor in the wavelength range of 500–600 nm at the measured temperatures of 300 and 573 K. On increasing the temperature, we did not observe any change in the positions of these two green UC emissions bands. However, the FIR of the two emissions bands varies with temperature appreciably. At a lower temperature, the intensity of the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 band is smaller than 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 but inverts at higher temperatures. The relative populations of the two thermally coupled levels, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2, follows a Boltzmann type population distribution, which leads to the variation in the intensities of the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions at an elevated temperature. The FIR of the green UC emission at 526 and 557 nm can be written as:33–35 (1) (2)where N and g are the number of ions and the degeneracy of the levels, ω and A are the transition frequencies and absorption rates of the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels to the 4I15/2 level, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature (in K) and ΔE is the energy separation between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels.
 Fig. 6  Upconversion-based temperature sensing behaviour of the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor: (a) green UC emission spectra measured at 300 and 573 K, (b) monolog plot of the FIR (using 526 and 557 nm emission) as a function of the inverse absolute temperature, (c) the FIR relative to the temperature, (d) sensor sensitivity as a function of the temperature. 

Fig. 6b shows the variation of the FIR for the emission bands centered at 526 and 557 nm as a function of the inverse absolute temperature on a monolog scale. The linear behaviour of the curve shows the suitability of the material for temperature sensing applications. The data can be fitted by using the equation of a straight line with a slope of about 1016.1 ± 42.3. The value of coefficient B (in eqn (2)) which gives the best curve fit on the experimental data is found to be 9.99 (see Fig. 6c). Furthemore, the sensor sensitivity can be defined as: (3)
Here the symbols have their usual meanings. The sensor sensitivity was calculated by this equation and plotted in Fig. 6d. At a temperature of 473 K, the sensitivity of this phosphor reached the maximum value i.e. 0.0073 K−1.
It is worth comparing the sensitivity of the investigated sensor with similar studies on other materials. The maximum thermal sensitivity and temperature range for the different materials are: 0.0048 K−1, 295–973 K in Er–Mo:Yb2Ti2O7,24 0.0051 K−1, 294–973 K in Er–Yb–Mo:Al2O3,25 0.0062 K−1, ∼280–573 K in Er:ZnO,26 0.0054 K−1, 291–450 K in 85TeO2–10PbF2–4AlF3–ErF3,27 0.0052 K−1, 295–773 K in Er:Al2O3,28 0.0023 K−1, 296–676 K in 9.41Er2O3–66.35SiO2–10.75B2O3–3.07BaO–10.42Na2CO3,29 0.0039 K−1, 300–900 K in Er–Yb:Gd2O3,30 0.0052 K−1, 322–466 K in Er:BaTiO3.31 Thus, the temperature sensor developed in the present work has better thermal sensitivity than those prepared using other host matrixes. Furthermore, the UC emission intensities are very stable up to the measured temperature i.e. 573 K, which suggests its applicability at higher temperatures as well. We could not study it beyond this temperature range because of instrumental limitations. Therefore, our studies reveal that the YNbO4 matrix is a good host for UC studies and the UC-based phosphor developed using this host matrix has the potential to be used in display devices and especially for the development of high sensitivity temperature sensors in a wide temperature range.
4. Conclusions
X-ray diffraction studies reveal that YNbO4 and Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 crystallize into a single phase phosphor at 1623 K. The structure of YNbO4 and Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 was confirmed to be monoclinic with C2/c space group. Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 produces strong visible emission through upconversion (UC) as well as by down conversion (DC) processes and thus behaves as a dual mode phosphor. The DC emission is also observed through energy transfer (ET) from charge transfer (CT) bands of YNbO4 to the Er3+ ions, which has been verified by a decrease in the decay time of the CT emission in the presence of Yb3+/Er3+ ions in the phosphor. The temperature sensor behaviour measured by the FIR technique (in the temperature range of 300–573 K) using the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ions shows a sensitivity of 0.0073 K−1 at 473 K, which is better compared to previously reported work. The results of the optical studies further indicate that the Y0.977Yb0.02Er0.003NbO4 phosphor has enough potential to be used in display devices.
