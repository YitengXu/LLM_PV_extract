    , Accepted 8th July 2014First published on 8th July 2014AbstractA series of self n-doped fullerene ammonium derivatives have been synthesized and confirmed with electron paramagnetic resonance and conductivity measurements. The existence of stable C60O2˙− anion radical in these materials resulted in intrinsically high conductivities between 1.05 × 10−2 and 1.98 × 10−2 S cm−1. Among fullerenes with different numbers of ammonium and counter anions, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)-(dimethyl)ammonium)-ethyl ester diiodides (PCBDANI) showed the best solvent resistance, which was confirmed by the measurement of film thickness and corresponding UV-vis absorption before and after rinsing with dichlorobenzene. Most importantly, the inverted polymer solar cells with the structure of ITO/PCBDANI/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag retained reasonably high power conversion efficiency even at a thickness of 82 nm of the PCBDANI film as the cathode interlayer. Thus large-area devices via printing this interlayer or printing on this interlayer could become feasible.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted broad interest both in academic and industry as renewable energy sources because of their unique advantages of light weight, flexible and low cost fabrication.1–7 So far, tandem solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.6%,8 while single junction cells showed the highest PCE of 9.35%9 based on an inverted polymer solar cell (I-PSC) with a cathode interfacial layer processed with an alcohol. Cathode interfacial materials are one of the key components for efficient polymer solar cells.8–50 In recent years, water-soluble or alcohol-soluble polar polymers have been successfully employed as cathode interlayers in conventional and inverted PSCs, including poly(ethylene oxide),14–17 conjugated polyfluorene derivatives with side chains containing amino- end groups,18–28 phosphoryl end groups,29–31 metal ion-intercalated crown ether,32 amino-containing insulating polyethylenimine derivatives,33–35 hyperbranched conjugated polymer,36 and conjugated polymeric zwitterions.37 Moreover, fullerene derivatives and cross-linked fullerenes have been extensively studied because of their electron transport properties.38–52 Interfacial dipole formation between an amine and a metal electrode and the n-doping of conducting fullerenes are the main reasons for the improvement of device performance.
Usually, semiconducting cathode interlayers were thin with thickness of around 5–10 nm to achieve optimized device performance because a thick interlayer will result in a high series resistance, while a very thin layer could not provide an ohmic contact for electron extraction and transport. However, to print this thin layer or to print on this thin layer is challenging for large area device fabrication.21,32,53,54 Thus, thickness tolerant interlayers, which possess excellent electron transport property and solvent resistance would have significant advantages.
Recently, Huang et al. reported a mercury-containing alcohol soluble conjugated metallopolymer PFEN-Hg as a cathode interlayer in PSCs with enhanced electron transport property by improving main chain interaction.55 Thus, PFEN-Hg based device performance exhibited less stringent dependency on the thickness of the interlayer.55 However, PFEN-Hg is not an environmentally friendly material and will limit its use for large-area device fabrication. More recently, Li et al.56 demonstrated that perylene diimide derivatives could be used as a thickness-insensitive cathode interlayer for high performance conventional PSCs with a wide thickness range of 6 to 25 nm.
Electrically doped organic transport layers with high conductivity can facilitate charge carrier transport both in organic light-emitting diodes and organic solar cells.57 However, an efficient n-type molecular doping is intrinsically more difficult than p-type doping because the HOMO level of the dopant must be higher than the LUMO level of the matrix material, which makes such materials vulnerable to oxidation in ambient environment. In addition, it is difficult to find suitable dopants with increasing HOMO level. The current n-doping approaches such as the thermal evaporation of small molecules and the in situ creation of volatile dopants from precursors require inert environment and have been hindered by the aggregation of small dopants in solid-state.57,58 Therefore, the development of solution processable and stable n-doped cathode interfacial materials for PSCs device fabrication is a significant challenge.
More recently, Jen et al. demonstrated a self n-doped fullerene with an ammonium salt (FPI)59 and further effective doping of fullerenes via simple solution-processed blend of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and tetrabutylammonium salts60 to achieve high conductivity in thin films. Lonergan61 also confirmed n-doping but proposed a mechanism involving chemical reaction before the electron transfer induced n-doping. However, the feasibility of using FPI as a cathode interlayer for I-PSCs is limited because FPI possesses poor orthogonal solvent processability because it can be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, in which the top layer was formed from its solution.62 Most interlayers such as poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) or fullerene derivatives can be dissolved in common solvents and cross-linking has been employed for improving solvent resistance in organic light emitting diodes53,63,64 and PSCs.14,28,42,43,55 Similarly, FPI has to be embedded into a thermally cross-linked semiconducting fullerene matrix.62 Although doped and solvent resistant interlayer was obtained, it became less conductive after this blending, and thus the performance of solar cells is sensitive to its thickness.62
Previously, we successfully reported an alcohol soluble fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)(dimethyl)ammonium)-ethyl ester diiodides (PCBDANI), as a cathode interlayer in conventional PSCs.45 In this paper, we report that a few intrinsically conductive fullerene derivatives with different number of ammonium salts and various counter ions are self n-doped, which is confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) and conductivity measurements. PCBDANI is shown to have the best solvent resistance and thickness tolerance as the cathode interfacial layer in a proof-of-concept I-PSCs with device architecture ITO/interlayer/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag, where P3HT represents poly(3-hexylthiophene), a typical donor for PSCs. Note that the devices could retain high efficiency even at a thickness of 82 nm of the PCBDANI film.
Experimental
Materials
All the solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, P3HT from Merck Chemicals Ltd and PCBM from Nano-C. Inc.
Synthesis and characterization of PCBANI and PCBDANBr
Similar to PCBDANI,45 [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid trimethylaminoethyl ester iodide (PCBANI) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylethanammonium)ethyl)(methyl) amino)ethyl ester bromide (PCBDANBr), shown in Scheme 1, were synthesized using PCBM as the starting material. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid chloride (PCBA-Cl) were prepared as reported previously.45 Esterification of PCBA-Cl with 3-(dimethylamino)propan-1-ol and 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)-amino)ethanol afforded [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid dimethylaminoethyl ester (PCBAN)42 and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl)(methyl)amino)ethyl ester (PCBDAN)45 separately, which were allowed to react with iodomethane and bromoethane to obtain PCBANI and PCBDANBr, respectively, according to the method for the preparation of PCBDANI.45 The structures of PCBANI and PCBDANBr were characterized by Av400X NMR (Bruker Co.) and Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive FTMS. Both PCBANI and PCBDANI are soluble in methanol and are readily soluble in DMF and DMSO. PCBDANBr can be dissolved in DMSO and mixed solvents of methanol with other solvents such as chloroform or chlorobenzene.

PCBANI
A solution of PCBAN (0.10 g, 0.10 mmol) and methyl iodide (0.5 mL) in chloroform (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. PCBANI precipitated and the suspension was transferred into a centrifuge bottle, which was centrifuged, decanted and then re-suspended in methanol, centrifuged, decanted and treated twice with methanol in the same manner. The residue was dried in vacuo at room temperature for 48 h to give a brown solid, PCBANI (0.10 g, yield 90%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 1.95–2.07 (m, 2H), 2.54–2.58 (m, 2H), 2.83–2.91 (m, 2H), 3.09–3.21 (m, 15H), 3.67–3.74 (m, 2H), 3.86–3.97 (m, 2H), 4.41–4.48 (m, 2H) 7.43–7.47 (m, 1H), 7.51–7.55 (m, 2H), 7.98 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz). 13C NMR (100 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 22.4, 22.8, 33.8, 52.74, 52.95, 61.5, 63.2, 80.6, 129.0, 132.6, 136.8, 137.3, 138.3, 140.7, 140.9, 142.3, 142.4, 142.5, 143.1, 143.9, 144.0, 144.4, 144.6, 144.72, 144.9, 145.2, 145.3, 145.8, 146.4, 148.4, 149.6, 172.9.

PCBDANBr
A solution of PCBDAN (0.20 g, 0.18 mmol) and ethyl bromide (0.5 mL) in chloroform (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 48 h. The product was successively purified by neutral aluminium oxide column chromatography using chloroform and methanol as eluents to give a brown solid, PCBDANBr (0.16 g, yield 78%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 1.19 (d, 3H, J = 8.0 Hz), 1.97–2.01 (m, 2H), 2.20 (s, 3H), 2.46–2.47 (m, 6H), 2.58–2.60 (m, 2H), 2.70–2.72(m, 2H), 2.85–2.89 (m, 2H), 2.87–2.98 (m, 6H), 4.06–4.09 (m, 2H), 7.46–7.48 (m, 1H), 7.53–7.57 (m, 2H), 8.01 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz). 13C NMR (100 MHz, d6-DMSO, δ): 8.4, 22.4, 33.4, 33.6, 42.4, 50.3, 51.2, 52.7, 55.7, 59.6, 62.1, 80.5, 128.8, 128.9, 132.5, 136.7, 137.1, 140.5, 140.6, 140.7, 142.0, 142.1, 142.3, 142.87, 142.91, 143.71, 143.74, 144.2, 144.6, 145.1, 145.6, 146.3, 148.4, 149.7, 172.8.

ESR measurements
Sample solutions were added to ESR test tubes and then bubbled with nitrogen to form films on the tube walls at room temperature or at 100 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. ESR measurements were performed using an ESRA-300 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker Co.) at room temperature under nitrogen.
Device fabrication and characterization

SCLC device. 
Electron-only device structures were used: ITO/fullerene (80 nm)/Al (100 nm). ITO-coated glass substrates were first cleaned via a four-step solvent cleaning procedure under sonication, which started from detergent and followed by deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, each for 10 min. Then, the substrates were dried before subjecting to 10 min ultraviolet-ozone treatment. After that, the substrates were transferred to a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. PCBANI and PCBDANI were dissolved in DMF, while PCBDANBr dissolved in a mixture of methanol and chlorobenzene. Then, the solutions were spin-coated (1000 rpm, 60 s) onto the pre-cleaned substrates. An aluminium layer with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on the fullerene layers.


I-PSCs. 
ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with a neutral detergent solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. Then they were treated with UV/ozone at 30 °C for 10 min. After that the devices were transferred to a glove-box where the fullerene ammonium layers were spin-coated at 700 rpm for 90 s onto ITO. P3HT and PCBM were dissolved in dichlorobenzene together in 90 °C for 1 h. Concentration of both P3HT and PCBM was 15 mg mL−1. The solution was filtered before spin coating (1300 rpm, 60 s) on the interlayer coated substrates. The films were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. Then, a layer of 10 nm MoO3 was thermally evaporated onto the active layer at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1, followed by a layer of 100 nm silver at 3 Å s−1 at a pressure below 2 × 10−6 Torr. A mask defined the active area of the solar cell device to be 10 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2410 Source Meter Unit. Solar cell performance was measured using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) Oriel solar simulator fitted with a 1000 W Xe lamp, which filtered to give an output of 1000 W m−2 in a glove-box. The incident photon to current efficiency (EQE or IPCE) was measured under ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. Light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal silicon photovoltaic cell. Absorption was measured by Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. A Dektak 6M stylus profiler (Veeco, Inc.) or an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer was used to measure the thickness of films. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted in ultra-high vacuum (3.0 × 10−8 Torr) with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic He ultraviolet source He I (hν = 21.2 eV). To separate the sample and the secondary edge of the analyzer, a sample bias of −9 V was applied.

Results and discussion
ESR measurements
To confirm the self n-doping of these fullerene derivatives, electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) was measured. ESR spectra of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid trimethylaminoethyl ester iodide (PCBANI), PCBDANI and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-((2-(dimethylethanammonium)ethyl)(methyl) amino)ethyl ester bromide (PCBDANBr) films were recorded at room temperature under nitrogen. In Fig. 1a, paramagnetic signals were observed with g values of 2.0027, 2.0027, and 2.0026 for PCBANI, PCBDANI, and PCBDANBr, respectively. In comparison, PCBDAN showed no significant ESR signal, confirming its semiconducting nature. It was reported that the g value of PCBM˙− anion radical is 1.998.58 The same g value for C60˙− was reported by Hwang et al.65 They also observed that upon exposure to molecular oxygen the broad C60˙− band slowly converted to band b with g = 2.0008, and then further transformed to a more stable band c with g = 2.0026. At high temperatures (T > 355 K) and in a polar solvent, the band c can be partially reversibly converted back to the band b. Both bands b (g value of 2.0008) and c (g value of 2.0026) were designated to the two isomers of the C60O2˙− anion radical.65 Similarly, both bands b and c for PCBDANBr film were observed when the sample was prepared at 100 °C under nitrogen (Fig. 1b). The existence of band c or band b suggested that fullerene radical anions exist in these materials through the self n-doping of the fullerenes.58–60 We note that FPI also has a similar g-factor of 2.0010,59 which may indicate that FPI is also in the form of C60O2˙−. We believe that insufficient deoxygenation leads to the formation of C60O2˙− anion radical which was readily observed. Fortunately, these materials are stable under ambient conditions for processing and still work well in devices, as will be discussed later.

Conductivity measurements
The conductivities of these fullerene ammoniums were tested using space-charge limited current (SCLC) method based on the electron-only device ITO/fullerene (80 nm)/Al (100 nm). We fitted the experimental J–V data on logarithmical scales, and a slope of 1 instead of 2 was obtained, which indicated there is no SCLC but Ohm's law was followed (Fig. 2). Thus, these fullerenes are not semiconductors but conducting materials, which is in agreement with the ESR measurements. The conductivities for PCBANI, PCBDANI, and PCBDANBr, were 1.50 × 10−2, 1.98 × 10−2, and 1.05 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively, which are comparable to those for the other conducting materials such as FPI (2.0 × 10−2 S cm−1),59 PEDOT-PSS (<∼10−3 S cm−1 for Baytron P VPAI 4083 (ref. 66) and 0.4 S cm−1 for Baytron P V4071 (ref. 67)) and an anionic narrow band gap conjugated polyelectrolyte (1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1).68 The intrinsically high conductivity should be attributed to the effective n-doping of fullerene films.

Solvent resistance test
Solvent resistance of these materials was investigated by the measurement of film thickness and corresponding UV-vis absorption before and after rinsing with dichlorobenzene. Spin coating from 40 mg mL−1 solutions in DMF, PCBDANI and PCBANI films had a thickness of 84 and 85.5 nm, respectively. After rinsing with dichlorobenzene, the thickness became 82 and 54.6 nm, respectively. For PCBDANBr film, a thickness of 105 nm was fabricated by multi-layer casting from its methanol solution and it became 63 nm after rinsing with dichlorobenzene. The measured variation in thickness was in agreement with UV-vis absorption (Fig. 3). Thus, PCBDANI has the best solvent resistance, and the actual thickness (82 nm) was extraordinarily high for the film prepared at 40 mg mL−1. The tuning of the solvent resistance property has been achieved with different numbers of ammonium and various counter ions, and the further optimization of solvent resistance could be possible by structural modification.

Work function of ITO coated with interlayers
The band energies of bare ITO and ITO coated with various interlayer films were measured by UPS (Fig. 4). Thus, the work function of pristine ITO decreased from 4.67 to 4.27, 4.23 and 4.19 eV for the ITO coated with PCBANI, PCBDANI and PCBDANBr, respectively. These results indicate that all of these materials could be used as a cathode interlayer in I-PSC.

Photovoltaic devices study
High conductivities of the self n-doped fullerenes suggested that they would be potentially thickness tolerant as cathode interlayers. To prove this concept, the effect of the thickness of three fullerene interlayers on the I-PSC performance was examined. The device structure for evaluating the material was ITO/interlayer/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag, where ITO was used as the cathode, MoO3/Ag as the anode, P3HT and PCBM used as the donor and acceptor, respectively. A series of PCBDANI and PCBANI films with various thicknesses were spin-coated atop ITO substrates from their DMF solutions, while PCBDANBr films were spin cast from the solution in a mixture solvent of methanol and chlorobenzene. For comparison, a control device without any interlayers was also fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for I-PSCs measured under AM 1.5 G irradiation (1000 W m−2) and dark are presented in Fig. 5, and the corresponding device characteristics including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values are summarized in Table 1. The relationship of PCE versus interlayer concentration was plotted in Fig. 6. I-PSC with a bare ITO electrode performed poorly with a PCE of 0.32%, a Jsc of 6.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.14 V, and an FF of 31.7%. With a thin interlayer, the devices worked reasonably well for all the three interlayers. The optimized devices appeared for all the interlayers casted from low concentrations: Voc reached 0.58 V, Jsc reached 10.1–10.2 mA cm−2, FF reached 64.0–66.4% and PCE reached 3.62–3.83%. For interlayers with iodide counter ions, the PCEs remained as high as over 90% of the maximum PCEs when the interlayers were spin cast from 40 mg mL−1 concentration, which is the highest concentration in this work. These performances are comparable to that obtained from inverted solar cells with other cathode interlayers.47,69–71 PCBDANBr showed worse performance at high concentrations because of the solubility issue after the material was stored for a period of time. Note that for PCBDANI film prepared at 40 mg mL−1, the thickness reaches 82 nm. At this extraordinarily high thickness, the device retains a PCE of as high as 90% of the maximum (3.43% versus 3.82%) with even higher FF (66.4%), along with the reduced Rs and increased Rsh. However, its Jsc (9.05 mA cm−2) was reduced by 10% relative to the maximum value. To understand why Jsc reduced, we measured the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 7) and external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 8.) of the devices with PCBDANI interlayer spin cast from 1, 6 and 40 mg mL−1 concentration and the control device without PCBDANI interlayer. The average thicknesses of these interlayers are around 5, 23, and 82 nm, respectively. Indeed, the interlayer contributed to absorption at a short wavelength peaking at ∼330 nm, and extending to a long wavelength, as seen in Fig. 7 and 3a. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the integrated current is 6.9, 9.8, 10.0, and 8.9 mA cm−2 for the device at interlayer thicknesses of 0, 5, 23 and 82 nm, respectively. These are very close to the measured Jsc (Table 1). For thick PCBDANI film of 82 nm, the IPCE is weaker at short wavelength, indicating that the n-doped interlayer absorbed in this region but did not contribute to photon current, reducing EQE in this region. In real application, however, this extra-large thickness would not be necessary. High FF along with reduced Rs and increased Rsh indicated that the interface between the interlayer and the active layer remained optimized in the case of the thick interlayer. In the case of PCBANI as an interlayer, Jsc decreased only by 2% relative to the value at its maximal PCE, while FF decreased along with slightly increased Rs. The actual PCBDAN thickness (∼55 nm) smaller than PCBDANI of 82 nm could be part of the reason for various Jsc. In addition, while the conductivities of PCBDANI and PCBANI are similar, PCBDANI has an extra ammonium salt, which is not involved in self n-doping. This additional ammonium iodide may negatively dope the PCBM in the active layer through inter-diffusion,72 make the n-doped region wider than PCBDANI layer itself, and reduce the absorption of the active layer, resulting in lower Jsc but good FF. However, more studies are required to clarify this point.

Conclusion
Self n-doped fullerene ammonium derivatives, PCBANI, PCBDANI, and PCBDANBr, have been confirmed by ESR and conductivity measurements. Fullerene anions were in the form of the as-prepared C60O2˙− anion radical. They are stable under ambient conditions for processing and possess high conductivities due to its self n-doped nature. Among interlayers with different numbers of ammonium salts and different counter ions, PCBDANI showed the best solvent resistance to dichlorobenzene and the device PCE remained as high as 3.43% (versus 3.83% maximum value) at an interlayer thickness of 82 nm. Further optimization of the structure and processing conditions for these interfacial materials would enable good device performance with a wider range of film thicknesses and large-area device processing. In addition, the self n-doped materials with high conductivity could also be applied in other devices such as perovskite solar cells.73,74
