    , Accepted 26th February 2021First published on 17th March 2021AbstractHarvesting energy from sunlight is an essential component of thermal load in an outdoor environment. Controlling the solar heating effects is therefore important. Inspired by the tunable coupling of the pigment cells and iridocytes in squid skin, we simulated a design for the tunable coupling of a grating and hyperbolic material. This composite metamaterial possessed thermoregulatory properties. The tiny mechanical action (∼250 nm) can tune the solar absorptive quality from 0.9 to 0.03 while keeping the radiative quality small. Our findings could have applications in dynamic and simply controlled thermoregulatory systems for outdoor structures and other technologies that regulate solar infrared absorption.
1. Introduction
Effective solar thermal management is important for daytime radiative cooling,1–4 aircraft and spacecraft components,5 clinical warming devices,6 power generation platforms,7 shipping and packaging containers,8 specialty textiles and garments,9,10 building environment control,11etc. Heating and cooling devices make the largest expense for energy use in buildings and human health. Photonic thermal effects are attributed to solar heating and radiative cooling. Solar energy is recognized as the main component for the thermal effects of an outdoor structure, such as a building or an automobile.12,13 Therefore, the ability to control solar heating effects is very important for energy consumption and human health.
Thermal management can be achieved by ‘passive’ and ‘active’ methods. The ‘passive’ methods, such as passive heating14 and passive cooling,13,15–19 are successful as they are low cost, energy-efficient, and simple to implement. Despite their success, ‘passive’ methods are static, may no longer be desirable and may even increase the energy consumption if conditions change. On the other hand, ‘active’ methods, such as electrothermal devices14 and self-adaptive radiative cooling, can offer flexible thermoregulation according to the conditions.14,20,21 Although these active methods can achieve dynamic thermoregulation, they are relatively energy inefficient, expensive, and complex to control. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop an ‘ideal’ method platform that can achieve dynamic, highly efficient and simply controlled thermoregulation.
Hyperbolic metamaterials are excellent solar absorbers owing to their selective and near-perfect absorption. Moreover, the absorption of the hyperbolic metamaterials can be controlled by external perturbations, such as electric field and temperature. Tunable hyperbolic metamaterials are manufactured using graphene/dielectric multilayers,22–24 semiconductors,25 conductive oxides,26 liquid crystals,27 phase-change materials28 and gyromagnetics.29 In addition, hyperbolic metamaterials have strong optical anisotropy; for instance, a periodic stack of metallic and dielectric layers30,31 appears to be metal in one plane and a dielectric in the perpendicular axis.32 Light can be coupled into a hyperbolic metamaterial by grating structure. By controlling the coupling, a tunable absorption can be achieved.
In nature, numerous photonic micro/nanostructures have evolved for optimized performance in response to environmental changes and stimulations33–35 (such as butterfly scales, moth-eye, and peacock feathers). Among these, squid skin is a sophisticated micro/nanostructure famous for its tunable iridescence that allows adaptive camouflage. The tunable optical system is enabled by the sophisticated micro/nanostructure. This special structure consists of chromatophore pigment cells and iridocytes, as shown in Fig. 1(a).36,37 The pigment cells are mainly responsible for the color and iridocytes are responsible for saturation. Tunable iridescence can be achieved by the mechanical action of the radial muscle cells. The tiny mechanical changes in geometry with the pigment cells and iridocytes will widen the hue range and change the saturation and lightness. The operation of these two cell types could achieve the coupling of the pigment and a Bragg reflector, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Thus, natural squid skin exhibits the capability required for optical tuning, making it a promising model for photonic thermoregulation. Hyperbolic metamaterials exhibit the potential to act as a super absorber. Several different strong resonators together can be combined with the absorber to get perfect absorption with a special function.38–40

Herein, inspired by the tunable coupling of pigment cells and iridocytes, a tunable thermoregulatory material is designed by tunable coupling of the grating multilayer structure. A tunable solar thermoregulatory simulation design was obtained by mechanically tuning the coupling of grating and hyperbolic metamaterials, as shown in Fig. 1. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was used to investigate the proposed design. The photonic thermal power density was 362 W m−2 under the on state, in which the grating was coupled to the hyperbolic structure with a gap Δz of 0 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Moreover, the photonic thermal power density is −1 W m−2 when the grating is decoupled with the hyperbolic structure under the off state (Δz = 250 nm).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Multilayer grating structure
To achieve a switchable infrared solar absorber, a higher absorption under the on state and a lower absorption under the off state should be obtained. From the simulation, which will be discussed in the later section, tunable absorption was achieved by model M0, which was constructed by a multilayer film and metal grating structure, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The multilayer structure is periodic in the Z-direction and infinite in the X/Y-direction. Moreover, the grating structure is periodic in the x/y-direction. The M0 model is constructed by alternately Au, SiO2 and Ti layers (the top 7 layers of Ti removed), as shown in Fig. 2. An Au material was chosen here to confirm the high strong metallicity under the off state to enhance the reflection, while a Ti material was chosen to enhance the high absorption under the on state. A simple Au–SiO2 multilayer (M1) and a Ti–SiO2 multilayer (M2) were also investigated for comparison with model M0, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. The geometric parameters of the models are shown in Fig. 2.

(c) M1: simple Au–SiO2 multilayer; (d) M2: simple Ti–SiO2 multilayer. 
The infrared absorption of M1 is shown in Fig. 3(a). M1 can turn on and off its absorption function with the gap between the grating and hyperbolic metamaterial Δz set to 0 and 250 nm, respectively. Under the on state, the selective absorption has a cut-off wavelength of 2 μm, thereby achieving highly efficient solar heating. The selective absorption can induce highly efficient thermal effects discussed in next section. The real and imaginary parts in the X-direction and the z-direction of the optical conductivity of M1 are analyzed, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (e), respectively. The results show that Re(εx) < 0 and Re(εz) > 0, indicating that the Au–SO2 films behave as hyperbolic metamaterials. The volume plasmon polaritons can be excited in the multilayered metamaterials using the grating coupling structure.41 The volume plasmon polaritons represent the high-k propagating waves inside the multilayered structure under the on state.42

The real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity of only multilayer film: (c) along x-direction in M1; (d) along the x-direction in M2; (e) along the z-direction in M1; (f) along the z-direction in M2. Hyperbolic dispersion is observed at wavelength >0.76 μm with model M1 and is observed at wavelength >3 μm with model M2. 
Moreover, the obvious ripple absorption can be found and these ripples decrease the absorption. The mechanism can be attributed to the coupling effects of surface plasmon resonance and magnetic resonance. While light cannot be coupled into the hyperbolic material without the grating structure under the off state, absorption can be achieved under the on state by coupling light through the grating structure. The absorption selectively focuses on the shorter wavelength (<2 μm) by optimizing the geometry parameters of the grating. Although the material loss increases with an increase in the wavelength, the absorption at longer wavelengths is lower than that at shorter wavelengths because light cannot be coupled into a multilayer structure at longer wavelengths. Under the off state, the high reflection can be achieved by pulling away the grating structure to decouple the light. The infrared absorption of M2 is shown in Fig. 3(a). M2 can achieve high absorption at Δz = 0 nm and Δz = 250 nm. The mechanism can be attributed to the intrinsic absorption of Ti. The real and imaginary parts in the x-direction and z-direction of the optical conductivity of M2 are analyzed, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and (f), respectively. The results shows that the structure has Re(εx) > 0 and Re(εz) > 0 in the wavelength range of 0.76–3 μm. Low Re values indicate a low reflection, while large Im values correspond to high absorption. The multipeak absorption by plasmon resonance can be obtained for the Au absorber (M1) with low IM, while broadband high absorption by intrinsic absorption properties can be obtained for Ti absorbers (M2) with high IM. Thus, M1 achieved a tunable absorption, while M2 achieved a high absorption.
2.2 Thermoregulatory properties
Since M1 and M2 can achieve tunable and high absorptions, respectively, composite structure M0, which combined M1 and M2, is expected to achieve a tunable high absorption, as shown in Fig. 4(a). A high absorption is obtained at Δz = 0 nm and rapidly decreases with the increase in Δz. On the other hand, the absorption is extremely low at Δz = 250 nm, which is almost equivalent to Δz = ∞. A high tunable absorption of solar energy denotes a thermoregulatory property. To achieve highly efficient solar thermoregulation, the ideal selective solar absorption should have an absorptance of unity in the solar spectrum to convert most solar radiation into heat, and low emission in the mid-infrared regime to minimize energy loss by spontaneous thermal radiation. Selective solar absorption is very important for solar thermal absorbers to achieve high solar-to-heat conversion efficiency. Under the on state, selective absorption can maximize the solar absorption and minimize the infrared thermal radiation to achieve maximum thermal load. The wavelength of radiation from the sun lies at a lower range than that one of a black body at the typical working temperatures of a solar thermal receiver.43,44 Both curves have an intercept point at a certain cut-off wavelength, as shown in Fig. 4(b), where the net energy is harvested for the wavelengths below this intercept point. Thus, a higher thermal power intake requires higher absorption below this intercept point and lower absorption above this intercept point. This is because that the lower absorption means lower emittance according to the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation. The absorption function α(λ) is described by eqn (1): (1)where αs is the absorption for wavelengths shorter than λcut-off, and αl is the absorption for wavelengths longer than λcut-off. An ideal absorption behavior should minimize the thermoradiative losses (αl = 0) while maintaining a high solar absorption (αs = 1).

The cut-off wavelength is given at that point where the thermal loss radiation becomes dominant. (c) The absorption spectra under on and off states. The solar absorptive quality (Qabs) and the radiative quality (Qrad) are characterized by the mean absorptions of ‘shorter wavelength’ and ‘longer wavelength’ with respect to the cut-off wavelength, respectively. (d) The sketch of thermal effects from on to the off state: the Qabs varies from 0.9 to 0.03, while the Qrad keeps very small ∼0.04. 
The selective absorption of M0 is shown in Fig. 4(c). The solar absorptive quality (Qabs) and the radiative quality (Qrad) are characterized by the mean absorptions of the shorter and longer wavelengths, respectively, with respect to the cut-off wavelength, respectively. The results show good selective absorption under the on state, while show real low absorption under the off state. Qabs varies from 0.9 to 0.03, while Qrad is extremely low at ∼0.04 from on to off state.
According to the absorption under the on and off states, the thermoregulatory properties are calculated with the temperature T assumed to be 25 °C, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Under the on state, the solar heating thermal power density Pinfraredsun is +376 W m−2, and the radiative cooling thermal power density Prad is −14 W m−2. Thus, under the on state the net thermal power density Ponnet is +362 W m−2. Moreover, under the off state, Pinfraredsun is +13 W m−2, and Prad is −14 W m−2, resulting in a Poffnet of −1 W m−2.
The absorption and thermal properties of the on and off states are shown in Fig. 5. Absorption rapidly decreases with the increase in Δz due to the decoupling of the plasmonic resonance, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding photonic thermal quality Qabs and Qrad are shown in Fig. 5(b). The result shows that Qabs sharply decreases, while Qrad maintains its small value with the increase in Δz. This denotes its ability to switch the solar heating function and the weak radiative cooling functions. Thus, the metamaterial can achieve highly efficient thermoregulation.

The thermoregulatory properties are investigated under different object temperatures since thermal radiation is temperature-dependent. The thermal power density under the on and off states versus the object temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. M0 achieved high thermoregulatory properties. The M1 model achieved a tunable thermal effect with a smaller range than that of the M0 model due to its lower solar absorption. The M2 model achieves a large thermal effect with a small range of thermal tuning, which decreases with the increase in the object temperature. As shown in Fig. 3, M1 achieved a tunable absorption, while M2 achieved a high absorption. The tunable selective absorption of M1 contributes to the tunable thermal effects, while the high light absorption of M2 contributes to the increase in the thermal effects. Thus, M0, composed of M1 and M2, achieves a large tunable thermal effect.

2.3 Analysis
As shown in Fig. 3, the solar absorption can be achieved using a hyperbolic material because of the high loss in the x-direction. In addition, the grating structure couples the light into a hyperbolic material. The field distribution in the x–z plane under the coupling and decoupling states with a wavelength of 1500 nm is shown in Fig. 7. The plasmon resonance of the grating allows the coupling of light into the hyperbolic material, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The energy mainly distributes in the metamaterial, which confirms the coupling mechanism, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The separation between the grating and the hyperbolic material decreases the coupling effects, as shown in Fig. 7(c). Although the plasmon is still excited in the grating structure, it is insufficient to prompt coupling to the hyperbolic material. The energy is mainly reflected, as shown in Fig. 7(d).

(b) E2 in the x–z plane distribution under the on state. (c) Ez distribution in the x–z plane under the off state. (d) E2 distribution in the x–z plane under the off state. The schematics of the structure are shown in the left and the key positions in the z-direction are shown as black dotted line. 
The line plot of the field distributions of M0 along the z-direction is shown in Fig. 8. Energy could penetrate the metamaterial due to the light coupling by surface plasmon polaritons, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The amplitudes of these surface waves decay exponentially away from the metal surface. In the metal-dielectric multilayer, the fields of the coupled modes can be explained by the catenary theory.45,46Ex is maintained in both the dielectric and metal layers, while Ez is enhanced in the dielectric layer and very weak in the metal layer. Therefore, high-loss Ti layers are added to the dielectric layers to achieve a high absorption. The top seven dielectric layers should not be added to the Ti material since the energy can reach this position even under the off state, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The results show that the light is mainly reflected under the off state.

(a) |Ex| and |Ez| distribution in the z-direction under the on state. (b) |Ex| and |Ez| distribution in the z-direction under the off state. The schematics of the structure are shown at the bottom and the black dotted lines indicate the key positions in the z-direction. 
The absorption distribution in M0 under the on state along the z-direction with different wavelengths is shown in Fig. 9. The results show that the light with wavelengths of 760 nm, 1340 nm and 1920 nm are absorbed and that with a wavelength of 2500 nm is not absorbed. The shorter wavelength of 760 nm is mainly absorbed by the Ti layers, while the longer wavelength 1340 nm is absorbed mainly by the Au and Ti layers. The wavelength 1920 nm is absorbed mainly by the Au layers. The wavelength of 2500 nm cannot be coupled into the metamaterial. Thus, the broad light absorption range of 760–2000 nm of this metamaterial originates from hyperbolic absorption and Ti absorption.

The ‘3D-model’ shown in Fig. 2(a) shows that M0 could absorb various polarized light, thereby making it a better design since sunlight is unpolarized. The results discussed in the preceding sections were obtained using the 2D models shown in Fig. 2(b)–(d), which considers the simulation time and computer memory requirement. The absorption simulation results of 2D and 3D models are shown in Fig. 10(a). The absorption obtained using the 3D model has slightly smaller values than those using the 2D model under the on state. Moreover, under the off state, the absorption obtained using both models are equal.

Angular absorption is also an essential parameter for both solar absorption and radiation cooling.47 In particular, an angular independent property is highly desirable for efficient solar absorbers, considering the random nature of solar radiation. The angular absorption of the proposed metamaterial is shown in Fig. 10(b). The results show that the light absorption range slightly narrows with the increase in the incident angle. Nonetheless, the metamaterial still maintains an efficient absorption at an incident angle of 0–30° due to the angular-dependent excitation of virtual power plants in the metamaterials. Light with a wavelength greater than 3 μm is reflected with various incident angles, confirming the low thermal emission of the metamaterial, as shown in the Methods section.
3. Conclusion
Tunable iridescence can be achieved by the mechanical action of the radial muscle cells of squids, where tiny mechanical changes in its geometry with the pigment cells and iridocytes could enlarge the hue range and subsequently change the saturation and lightness. Using this as the inspiration, this study investigated a conceptual solar thermal management system based on the tunable optical coupling of metal grating and a hyperbolic metamaterial. The hyperbolic metamaterial absorbed the solar energy, while the grating structure achieved light coupling into the hyperbolic metamaterial. Thus, controlling the coupling can tune the solar absorption. The gap (Δz) between the grating and the hyperbolic metamaterial (Δz) determines the coupling ability. The tiny mechanical changes in Δz can turn on and off the solar heating function. The described materials and structure could provide new possibilities for the numerous modern technologies that rely on thermoregulation by regulating solar infrared absorption.
4. Methods
4.1 Optical modeling
The numerical studies were conducted out in this study based on the FDTD method, except for the optical conductivity of the hyperbolic material, as shown in Fig. 5. Using the FDTD simulation, the detail of the structure and the geometry size was obtained, as shown in Fig. 2. In the model, the permittivity of metal was given as Au48 and Ti.49 The refractive index of SiO2 was set as 1.45. The boundary condition was set as follows: in the horizontal directions is absorbing (perfectly matched layer, PML) and in vertical directions is periodic (periodic boundary condition, PBC). A plane wave source illuminates the structure. The wavelength was defined from 0.76 μm and 4 μm. The proper mesh size was determined to obtain a good trade-off between the computer memory requirement and the simulation time. A convergence test was carefully performed.
4.2 Thermal performance
The absorbed power density Pinfraredsun given in Fig. 4 was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where IAM1.5(λ) is the AM1.5 spectrum, and ε(λ) is the spectral absorptivity of the real object. Here, only the infrared wavelength range was considered because this portion of the solar spectrum contributes significantly to solar power without affecting the color property of an outdoor object. The radiation power density Prad given in Fig. 4 was calculated using eqn (3): (3)where  is the angular integral over the hemisphere. IBB (T,λ) = (2hc2/λ5)/(ehc/λkT − 1) is the spectral radiance of a blackbody at temperature T, h is the Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The low emission property is confirmed under various incident angles, as shown in Fig. 10(b).
4.3 Fabrication design
This paper is a simulation work. In this study, the metamaterial is a metal/dielectric multilayer structure and can be fabricated by various coating technology (e.g., magnetron sputtering). The metal grating structure can be fabricated by the standard EBL (electron beam lithography) approach and metal deposition approaches. The tiny mechanical changing (<250 nm) can be achieved by modern technology such as MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System)50 technology or phase-change material.

 	Fig. 1  Bioinspired design of the switchable solar absorption with tunable optical coupling. (a) and (b) Schematics of iridescent color change from the tunable coupling of the pigment cells and the iridocytes in squid. (c) and (d) Schematics of the composite structure, which consists of a grating and a hyperbolic structure. The gap between the grating and the hyperbolic structure Δz controls the state of coupling and decoupling. The photonic thermal power density under on and off states vary from 362 W m−2 to −1 W m−2. Left: 3D model of the tunable grating multilayer structure, middle: E2 distribution; right: absorption spectra.	 

 	Fig. 2  Models for the tunable metamaterial design, constructed by an upper grating structure and lower multilayer film structure. (a) 3D and (b) 2D sketch of M0: the metamaterial constructed by alternately Au, SiO2 and Ti layers (the top 7 layers of Ti removed). (c) M1: simple Au–SiO2 multilayer; (d) M2: simple Ti–SiO2 multilayer.	 

 	Fig. 3  Infrared absorption and effective permittivity of the periodic Au–SiO2 (M1) films and Ti–SiO2 (M2). Tunable infrared absorption of M1(a) and M2(b). The real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity of only multilayer film: (c) along x-direction in M1; (d) along the x-direction in M2; (e) along the z-direction in M1; (f) along the z-direction in M2. Hyperbolic dispersion is observed at wavelength >0.76 μm with model M1 and is observed at wavelength >3 μm with model M2.

 	Fig. 4  Selective absorption and thermal power density of the bioinspired composite structure (M0) under on and off states. (a) Selective absorption of M0 with Δz = 0 nm, 25 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 250 nm, ∞. (b) Near-infrared radiation of the sun at the earth surface (AM1.5 G) and typical black body radiation. The cut-off wavelength is given at that point where the thermal loss radiation becomes dominant. (c) The absorption spectra under on and off states. The solar absorptive quality (Qabs) and the radiative quality (Qrad) are characterized by the mean absorptions of ‘shorter wavelength’ and ‘longer wavelength’ with respect to the cut-off wavelength, respectively. (d) The sketch of thermal effects from on to the off state: the Qabs varies from 0.9 to 0.03, while the Qrad keeps very small ∼0.04.
