    , Accepted 29th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractAqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently triggered increasing research interest because of their low cost, safety and environment friendliness, while suitable cathode materials with high energy density and long cycle life are still rare. Herein, we demonstrate the patronite form of vanadium sulfide anchored on reduced graphene oxide (VS4@rGO) prepared via a facile hydrothermal method as a high performance cathode for ZIBs. Benefiting from the peculiar crystallographic structure of VS4 and the superior conductivity of rGO, the VS4@rGO electrode delivers a high capacity of 180 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 93.3% after 165 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. Meanwhile, a high capacity retention of 83.7% can be reached when the current density is increased from 0.2 A g−1 to 2 A g−1, showing excellent rate performance. A synergetic reaction mechanism consisting of intercalation and conversion is proposed for the electrochemical cycle. The assembled Zn//VS4@rGO batteries have promising potential for practical applications.
1. Introduction
The development of energy storage devices has been greatly promoted by the growing demand for integrating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind in the past decades.1,2 Despite possessing numerous outstanding merits including high operation voltage, high energy density and light weight, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) reveal a number of shortcomings for large-scale energy storage applications, such as high cost and safety issues.3,4 Recently, aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have received considerable attention due to their many attractive characteristics including high power density, eco-friendliness and low cost.5–7 Moreover, the formation of dendritic zinc can be eliminated by employing neutral or weak acidic electrolytes, which enhances the level of security.8 Cost and safety are high priorities for large-scale energy storage systems, which makes aqueous ZIBs more attractive relative to LIBs. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by a lack of suitable cathode materials which can deliver high energy density and long cycle life. Polymorphs MnO2 with a tunneled or layered structure are first explored for cathode materials with high discharge capacity, while they suffer from rapid capacity fading.9,10 Nevertheless, MnO2 based materials bear striking advantages for fabricating flexible and wearable solid-state (quasi-solid-state) ZIBs according to the latest literature.11,12 Zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) exhibits high discharge voltage during the insertion of zinc ions, while it delivers limited specific capacity.13 More recently, vanadium based oxides with a layered structure (Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O,6 V2O5·nH2O,14 VO2,15 and Na2V6O16·1.63H2O16) were found to be outstanding intercalation hosts, which show exceptional electrochemical performances of both high capacity and excellent cycle stability. The success of vanadium based compounds brings a new direction for developing high-performance cathodes for ZIBs. Besides, some new trends have emerged in recent studies. Organic cathodes, for instance, were exploited for high-performance aqueous ZIBs.17,18 Moreover, the electrochemical performance of batteries can be greatly improved by adding a second metal ion into the electrolyte.19,20
Transition metal sulfides, with varied crystal structures as well as distinctive chemical and physical properties, have triggered intense interest in fundamental studies and practical applications in many fields, including electronics,21 sensing,22 catalysis23 and energy storage.24 Recently, layered VS2 nanosheets were used as promising cathode materials for ZIBs, which exhibited long-life cycling stability and great rate performance owing to the large interlayer spacing and high electronic conductivity.25 As an analogue of VS2, the patronite form of vanadium sulfide (VS4), having a unique chain like structure and a component of the (S–S)2− group, has been studied for energy storage materials in recent years.26–33 When applied as the anode of LIBs, VS4 is subjected to a series of complicated redox reactions. During the first discharge process, an intercalation reaction (VS4 → LixVS4) and then a conversion of LixVS4 to Li2S and metallic V occur sequentially.26–29 In the subsequent charge process, however, there is a controversy on whether the Li2S is converted to VS4 according to the earlier studies.26,27,29 Very recently, the partial transformation of Li2S to amorphous VS4 during the first charge process was confirmed by multiple X-ray spectroscopy techniques.28 VS4 was also reported as a feasible Na+ storage material, where a multistep reaction including a transformation between Na2S and S (Na2S → S + 2Na+ + 2e−) was proposed during the first charge–discharge cycle.31 In addition, VS4 was applied as a reversible cathode material for aluminum ion batteries,33 which indicates that it may be also suitable for storage of other multivalent metal ions. It is worth noting that these VS4 based batteries all involve an anionic redox mechanism, because the transformation of a pristine S22− dimer to S2− species was detected after cycling. The anionic redox mechanism, which was discovered in sulfide based electrodes and revived interest recently, is expected to be an effective strategy for designing high energy density cathodes.34 Thus, the conversion reaction including two contributions from V4+ and S22− species and the intercalation reaction enable high capacity in VS4 systems. However, the current research efforts in cathode materials of ZIBs mostly focus on the materials based on the intercalation mechanism; there were few reports on zinc storage materials based on the conversion reaction except for some manganese oxides.10,35
In this work, a safe and high performance aqueous ZIB based on the VS4@rGO composite cathode, metallic zinc anode and 1 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte is presented (Fig. 1a). The unique chain-like architecture of VS4 and the high conductivity of rGO enable a fast and reversible zinc storage behavior during the electrochemical redox process, giving rise to a high capacity of 180 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 93.3% after 165 cycles and excellent rate performance. During the galvanostatic charge–discharge process, the zinc storage mechanism was elucidated by ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of VS4@rGO
The graphene oxide (GO) solution was prepared via a modified Hummers method.36 The VS4@rGO composite was synthesized through a hydrothermal process, as reported in previous literature.30 Briefly, 12 mL of GO solution (5 mg mL−1) was diluted with deionized water to a volume of 60 mL. Then 0.825 g of sodium orthovanadate and 1.685 g of thioacetamide were added to the above GO solution with vigorous stirring for 1 h. The mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL sealed Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 160 °C for 24 h. After cooling down, the product was filtered, rinsed with deionized water several times, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Pristine VS4 was also prepared by a previously reported solvothermal method to compare the electrochemical performances.37
2.2. Materials characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using an X'Pert3 Powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The Raman spectra were collected using a Renishaw InVia micro-Raman spectroscopy system. The morphology and composition were studied using a Helios NanoLab G3 UC scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEOL JEM-2010F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element analysis system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a K-Alpha+ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with mono Al Kα radiation.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performances of the prepared samples were measured on CR2025 type cells using Zn foil as the anode, 1 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 as the electrolyte and a glass fiber as the separator. The VS4@rGO electrode was prepared by mixing VS4@rGO, conductive nanocarbon Super P and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a weight ratio of 6:3:1, and then the slurry was ground, tableted and cut into Φ 10 mm coins. Finally the coins were pressed onto titanium meshes with a mass loading of 1.9–2.5 mg cm−2. The electrodes were then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h before further study. Galvanostatic cycling tests were carried out on a Neware battery testing system (CT-4008-5V10mA-164). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out over a frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV.
3. Results and discussion
VS4@rGO was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal process. It is worth noting that the GO plays a critical role in converting the reactants to VS4 instead of VS2, which was studied in detail in previous research.30 The crystallographic structures of the prepared samples were studied by XRD measurements. As shown in Fig. 1b and S4a,† all the diffraction peaks can be indexed well to monoclinic VS4 (JCPDS no. 72-1294). The two strongest diffraction peaks with a narrow and sharp shape at 15.82° and 17.01°, corresponding to the (110) and (020) crystal planes, reveal that highly crystalline patronite was formed. The VS4 is built up of V–S chains stacking along the c axis direction. Each one-dimensional V–S chain is composed of central V atoms and two S22− moieties combined together by covalent bonds alternatively, in which the vanadium atoms adopt an eight-coordinated configuration (Fig. 1c). The alternation of a short and a long distance (2.8 Å and 3.2 Å) between two adjacent vanadium atoms along the c direction can be explained by a Peierls distortion.26 It is worth noting that the distance between two neighboring V–S chains (6.2 Å) is far greater than the radii of Zn2+ ions (0.74 Å), which is beneficial to a fast diffusion process of Zn2+ ions in the VS4 bulk. Moreover, the relatively loose crystal structure provides potential sites for the intercalation of guest Zn2+ ions, thus resulting in a high energy density. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Raman spectrum of the prepared sample is well assigned to the standard spectrum of patronite in the RRUFF Raman database (ID R070737, 532 nm laser). The peaks appearing at 190 and 279 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching and bending modes of V–S bonds, respectively.38 The inset of Fig. 1d shows the Raman spectra of the prepared sample and pristine GO at wavenumber values from 1100 to 1700 cm−1. Typically, the two peaks at around 1347 and 1597 cm−1 are related to the D and G bands of GO, which are associated with structural defects originating from the attachment of hydroxyl and epoxide groups on GO sheets and the first-order scattering of the E2g mode, respectively.39 The intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band (ID/IG) indicates the defect level in graphene oxide. After hydrothermal treatment, the ID/IG value of GO in the composite is calculated to be 0.85, which is higher than that of pristine GO (0.74). This indicates that the GO was partially reduced during the hydrothermal treatment.31,40 Moreover, the increased ID/IG value is also associated with the generation of more defects, which stems from a chemical reduction of GO during the hydrothermal process.31,40,41
In order to study the morphology of the composite, SEM and TEM were performed. The SEM photograph of the as-prepared composite is displayed in Fig. 2a and shows substantial VS4 particles and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) forming a coarse cluster structure. Rice kernel like VS4 particles with a length of ca. 70 nm and a width of ca. 30 nm anchored on the rGO matrix are observed in the TEM photograph (Fig. 2b). A d-spacing of 0.56 nm in the high solution TEM image (Fig. 2c) matches well with the (011) plane of VS4. Besides, the EDX result shows that the atomic ratio of S to V is close to 4 (Fig. 2d), further confirming the formation of VS4. The rough surface of the VS4@rGO sample facilitates contact between the electrode and the electrolyte, which is favorable for an excellent rate performance.42 Moreover, the rGO nanosheets provide effective electron transfer channels, thus reducing electrochemical polarization during electrochemical cycles. As shown in the elemental mapping of the TEM image (Fig. 2e), the S and V elements gather in the same particles, while the C and O elements distribute evenly in the VS4@rGO composite.

The surface chemical compositions and oxidation states of the prepared composite were analyzed delicately using XPS measurements. Fig. 3a displays the survey-scan XPS spectrum of the VS4@rGO composite. The main peaks corresponding to sulfur, vanadium, carbon, and oxygen are observed, in accord with the TEM elemental mapping result. As shown in Fig. 3b, S 2p core level analysis reveals two peaks at 162.9 eV and 164.1 eV, correlating well to sulfur 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of the S22− dimer in VS4.30 Three oxidation states of vanadium species are seen after peak separation of the V 2p core level spectrum, as depicted in Fig. 3c. The two peaks centered at 517.3 eV and 524.3 eV can be attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 components of V4+. Meanwhile, the vanadium 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks located at 515.9 eV and 522.9 eV with relatively low intensity are ascribed to V3+ species, resulting from the partial reduction of the vanadium source to V3+ in hydrothermal reaction.32 Noticeably, the two strong peaks at 513.9 eV and 521.5 eV are corresponding to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 components of the V–C bond, which is similar to an earlier study.32 Surprisingly, the intensity of the V–C component is even higher than that of V4+, which can be ascribed to the strong bonding between VS4 and the rGO matrix as well as the limited detection depth of XPS measurements. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the C 1s core level spectrum can be deconvoluted into three components at 284.8 eV, 287.1 eV and 289.0 eV, corresponding to the C–C, C–O and O–CO groups, respectively.43,44 The low intensities of the C–O and O–CO components demonstrate that the oxygen-containing groups of GO were partially removed after hydrothermal reaction.45

To study the electrochemical properties of the VS4@rGO electrode, CV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1, using zinc foil as both the reference electrode and counter electrode. The scanning voltage range was controlled between 0.35 V and 1.8 V (vs. Zn2+/Zn), as shown in Fig. 4a. In the first cycle, only an oxidation peak was detected at 1.53 V, which can be attributed to the electrochemical activation of the VS4@rGO electrode. However, two pairs of redox peaks with good symmetry appear at 0.54/0.67 V and 0.89/1.01 V in the subsequent cycles, and the oxidation peak located at 1.53 V moves gradually to around 1.62 V after three cycles. The former two pairs of peaks can be attributed to the transformation of multiphase vanadium redox couples,46 while the latter oxidation peak belongs to a conversion reaction (see below). The peak currents of CV curves increase during continuous cycles, indicating a gradual activation process in the first several cycles.46,47 The electrochemical properties in a narrow scan range of 0.4 V to 1.2 V were also investigated, while it led to poor electrochemical activity and low capacity (Fig. S1†). Thus, this indicates that the conversion reaction at 1.62 V acts as an activation process in each cycle. In addition, the CV curves maintain their original shape with the increase of scan rate (Fig. 4d), manifesting superior cycle stability during cycling. Moreover, the oxidation currents of peak A1 and peak A2 increase faster than that of peak A3. According to the principle that the area enclosed by the CV pattern is proportional to the capacity of the electrode at a certain scan rate,48 it can be qualitatively illustrated that the capacity contribution of the conversion reaction (peak A3) is reduced at high scan rate.

The galvanostatic discharge–charge (DC) curves of the first three cycles (Fig. 4b) accord well with the CV curves. After activation in the first cycle, the DC curves become stable. Meanwhile, the DC curves of the VS4@rGO electrode at a series of current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 2 A g−1 were recorded, as shown in Fig. 4e. Remarkably, the curves in the potential range between 0.35 V and 1.2 V under the current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1 and 2 A g−1 almost overlap completely, indicating excellent rate performance, which is owing to the favorable crystal structure with weak interactions between one-dimensional V–S chains, giving an easy and fast access/removal kinetics for Zn2+ ions. Moreover, the charge plateau at around 1.71 V was narrowed down and even eliminated with increasing current density. This indicates that the reaction at 1.71 V was suppressed at high current density. As displayed in Fig. 4c, the prepared VS4@rGO composite delivers a specific discharge capacity as high as 180 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 165 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.3% (relative to the average specific discharge capacity). The increasing coulombic efficiency may arise from a slow activation process with the increase of cycle number, which is in accordance with the CV curves at 0.5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4a). The rate performance of VS4@rGO is presented in Fig. 4f. A high capacity retention of up to 83.7% was observed even though the current density was increased tenfold from 0.2 A g−1 to 2 A g−1. It was found that the coulombic efficiency is highly relevant with the capacity contribution between 1.4 and 1.8 V to the total charge capacity. The coulombic efficiency increases as this contribution decreases (Table S1†). Additionally, the average discharge voltage of the battery was calculated to be 0.73 V, which is higher than that of VS2 (the calculation process is shown in Fig. S2†).
The electrochemical properties of rGO and VS4 were studied to assess their contribution in the VS4@rGO electrode, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† The CV curves of rGO (Fig. S3a†) show a pair of redox peaks at around 1 V. And the rGO electrode delivers a discharge capacity of 27 mA h g−1 after 110 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, which is much lower than that of the VS4@rGO composite under the same conditions (Fig. S3c†). On the other hand, VS4 reveals an extremely similar electrochemical behavior to the VS4@rGO composite (Fig. S4b and S4c†). Besides, the initial discharge capacity of VS4 can reach 135.8 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is comparable with that of the VS4@rGO composite (Fig. S4d†). However, the VS4 electrode displays inferior cycle stability (only 67.4% of the initial capacity can be retained after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1) and poor rate performance (a lower capacity retention of 56.9% is obtained when the current density increases from 0.2 to 2 A g−1, as shown in Fig. S4f†) compared with the VS4@rGO composite. Above all, the capacity of the VS4@rGO composite mainly comes from the low content of the VS4 (2.8 wt% of carbon in VS4@rGO, measured by elemental analysis) and the low capacity of rGO. In addition, the existence of rGO can effectively improve the cycle stability and the rate performance of the VS4@rGO electrode.

Ex situ XRD measurements were carried out to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of VS4@rGO during the first DC cycle, as displayed in Fig. 5a. The VS4@rGO electrode at different states of the DC cycle is marked as ‘Dx’/‘Cx’, in which ‘x’ denotes the selected potential value. In the discharge process, the XRD pattern of the VS4@rGO electrode remains unchanged practically when discharged to 0.5 V. However, the two peaks at 12.3° and 30.1° indicate that a Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O phase (PDF #50-0570) was generated in the full discharge state (D0.35). In addition, another crystalline phase is also observed at 11.3° (inset of Fig. 5a). During the following charge process, the peak at 11.3° disappeared at the C0.8 state and the XRD pattern of the VS4@rGO electrode went back to the original state at C1.4. When charged to 1.8 V, the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O was formed again and the formation of orthorhombic sulfur (PDF #08-0247) was also observed. In the full charge state of the first DC cycle, the separator (the side facing the cathode) turned yellow in the area where it has a direct contact with the electrode materials, as shown in Fig. S5.† This phenomenon probably results from the permeation of sulfur into the electrolyte, which is also supported by the Raman spectra (Fig. S6†). Moreover, the (001) plane of VS4 shows a negligible shift during the first DC cycle. As shown in Fig. 5b, the existence of Zn element and formation of V5+ (two peaks centred at 517.6 and 525.2 eV) further confirm the generation of Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O.49 Besides, the absence of the V–C component in the spectrum of V 2p reveals the breakdown of V–C bonds after the first DC cycle. Combining the ex situ XRD results and the XPS spectrum, the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O can be ascribed to the component of the SEI layer, which is unstable and highly dynamic during cycling. A similar breathing behaviour of the SEI layer was also proposed for LIBs with the VS4 anode according to the V L-edge XAS spectra.28 The significant decrease in charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the VS4@rGO electrode in the full discharge and full charge states may associate with the formation of the SEI layer (Fig. S7 and Table S2†).

(b) XPS spectrum of the V 2p core level at the full charge state of the first charge–discharge cycle; the inset shows the XPS spectrum of the Zn 2p core level. 
However, the electrochemical behavior of VS4@rGO in the first DC cycle is not representative according to the CV curves (Fig. 4a) and the DC profiles (Fig. 4b). In order to gain a further insight into the electrochemical reaction mechanism of the VS4@rGO electrode, ex situ XRD measurements were performed during the third DC cycle, as shown in Fig. 6. Upon discharging, the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O phase was generated and grew strongest at the full discharge state, in which V is stabilized as +5. The abnormal change from V4+ to V5+ can be ascribed to the electron transfer from V4+ to S22− dimers, as proposed by Britto et al.26 Interestingly, the formation of Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O was also reported in VO1.52(OH)0.77 based ZIBs.50 In addition, the orthorhombic sulfur emerged and vanished repeatedly when discharged from 1.8 to 0.8 V, indicating that a complicated electrochemical induced transformation of sulfur species occurs. With the further decrease in voltage, an unknown phase with poor crystallinity appeared at 28.8°, 48.1° and 57.2°, which might be associated with an inserted compound of ternary zinc tetrathiovanadate (ZnxVS4). Similar phenomena were also reported in LIBs and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), where a ternary alkali metal tetrathiovanadate (MxVS4, M = Li or Na) was proposed for the sustained discharge process.29,31 In the charge process, the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O phase diminished significantly when charged from 0.35 to 0.8 V. Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of the poorly crystallized phase at 28.8°, 48.1° and 57.2° disappeared and the VS4 was regenerated with the extraction of Zn2+ ions. After that, the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O and the orthorhombic sulfur emerged simultaneously when charged to 1.4 and 1.8 V. The transformation from V4+ to V5+ species was further substantiated by XPS analysis of the V 2p core level at the full charge state, as shown in Fig. S8.† Besides, the intensity of these two phases increased dramatically while it decreased in VS4 from 1.4 to 1.8 V by using the diffraction peak of Ti at 40.2° as reference. Therefore, it translates to a partial conversion from VS4 to Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O and S during the charge process, in which Zn2+ ions and water in the electrolyte also serve as reactants according to the conservation of mass. The conversion mechanism can be expressed as follows: 2VS4 + 11H2O + 3Zn2+ → Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O + 8S + 16H+ + 10e−(1)
 Fig. 6  
Ex situ XRD patterns in the third discharge–charge cycle at 0.1 A g−1 (left). The evolution of the (011) plane of VS4 (right). 
Note that the mechanism descripted by eqn (1) is only suitable for the charge process, while the Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O phase generated in the full discharge state (D0.35) results from a different mechanism for the absence of the sulfur phase at D0.35. Moreover, other complicated conversion reactions also occur in the discharge process because the generation/disappearance of a certain phase can be observed between every two consecutive voltage points. Upon persistent voltage decrease, the (011) peak of VS4 shifted to a higher two-theta angle, which can be resumed in the charge process. This phenomenon states clearly that the relevant reaction involves an insertion mechanism. With the insertion of Zn2+ ions, the interaction between Zn2+ and V–S chains gives rise to the shrinkage of the VS4 lattice. In contrast, the lattice recovers when Zn2+ ions are extracted from VS4. Thus, the intercalation mechanism can be expressed by the following equation: VS4 + xZn2+ + 2xe− ↔ ZnxVS4(2)
In summary, a synergetic reaction mechanism composed of intercalation and conversion which coexist in the whole voltage range is proposed based on the ex situ XRD analysis of the third DC cycle (the schematic illustration is shown in Fig. S9†). Interestingly, this unusual mechanism is also observed in VS4 based LIBs.28 However, the electrochemical behaviour of VS4 in aqueous ZIBs is substantially different from the case of LIBs. When applied as the anode of LIBs, VS4 was subjected to a transformation to Li2S and metallic V during discharge.26–29 However, in the subsequent charge process, only amorphous VS4 was detected according to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray spectroscopy results,26,28 while recovery of the characteristic diffraction peaks of original VS4 was not observed in the ex situ or in situ XRD results.26,29 Thus, VS4 exhibits better reversibility in aqueous ZIB systems relative to LIBs. It is worth mentioning that further study is needed to provide a deeper and detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism.
To visually demonstrate the feasibility of this Zn battery for practical applications, two prototype batteries in series powering a mini motor with a fan (1.5 V, 15 mW) are shown in Fig. 7a and b. On the basis of the mass of active material, the energy density and power density are calculated to be 180 W h kg−1 and 145 W kg−1, respectively, at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. The Ragone plot is shown in Fig. 7c to compare the rate performance of our Zn//VS4@rGO cell to that of other ZIB systems. Our Zn//VS4@rGO cell shows better rate performance than the reported Zn//VS2,25 Zn//ZnHCF@MnO2,51 Zn//ZnHCF,13 and Zn//Na3V2(PO4)3 systems.52 Even though the power density is increased by one order of magnitude, the reduction in energy density is very low, demonstrating excellent rate performance.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a VS4@rGO composite was synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. This composite shows a morphology of rGO wrapping rice kernel like VS4 and direct binding between VS4 and the rGO matrix. When serving as the cathode of ZIBs, the composite delivers a capacity as high as 180 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 165 cycles and a capacity retention of 93.3%. In addition, the favorable crystal structure of VS4 and the existence of rGO contribute to a superior rate performance. During the galvanostatic charge–discharge process, a synergetic mechanism containing both intercalation and conversion was proposed, as evidenced by ex situ XRD measurements. The present study not only extends the selection of high performance cathode materials for zinc ion batteries but also motivates the application of VS4 in other aqueous ion batteries.
