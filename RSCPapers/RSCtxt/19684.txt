    , Accepted 26th April 2013First published on 3rd June 2013AbstractA highly active graphitic C3N4 photocatalyst prepared from a mixture of urea and melamine with advanced structural, optical and electronic properties and enhanced photocatalytic activity for the production of hydrogen gas is explored. The prepared photocatalyst is able to generate a high rate of hydrogen gas production (135 μmol h−1) by loading with 1 wt% Pt as a co-catalyst. The good separation of C3N4 sheets, lower recombination rate of excitons and the high amount of generated photocurrent have significantly contributed towards the photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride prepared from a mixture of urea and melamine.
1 Introduction
The search for suitable semiconductor photocatalysts for the production of hydrogen gas by splitting water using solar energy is one of the noble missions of the scientific community. Various photocatalysts have been developed for photocatalytic energy conversion, including mixed metal oxides, metal oxide nano-composites, metal sulphides and conjugated inorganic polymers.1–5 Among all, the conjugated inorganic polymers are of particular interest, as they are much closer to biological systems in composition and are potentially sustainable, as well as cheap and easily processable.6 Recently, researchers have paid much attention to the development of C3N4 based photocatalysts for energy production and removal of organic contaminants under visible light. Research on the synthesis of C3N4 and its derivatives have been started since the historic observation of Berzelius and named by Liebig7,8 in 1834. g-C3N4 is composed of only carbon and nitrogen and is stable in acidic and basic media due to the strong covalent bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms.8 These advanced properties imply that metal-free g-C3N4 has potential applications in photocatalysis. This metal free polymeric photocatalyst also has efficient thermodynamic potential for production of hydrogen energy from water as the reported band gap energy of g-C3N4 is 2.70 eV.9 The metal free polymeric photocatalyst g-C3N4 is also used as a sensitizer candidate and a support in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of various semiconductor photocatalysts like g-C3N4–ZnO, g-C3N4–Bi2WO6, g-C3N4–TaON.10–12 So the synthesis of highly active g-C3N4 with advanced optical and electronic properties for application in photocatalysis is inevitable. Most researchers have prepared this versatile inorganic polymer from carbon and nitrogen containing compounds like cyanamide, dicyandiamide, urea and melamine etc. by thermal polycondensation methods.9,13–15 The photocatalytic performances of g-C3N4 are quite low, so various researchers have modified g-C3N4 by nonmetal doping,16,17 noble metal deposition18,19 and preparation of nanoporous g-C3N4.20,21
In this investigation, we have prepared graphitic C3N4 from urea and melamine, by taking a unimolar ratio of both melamine and urea using a simple thermal condensation method. The graphitic C3N4 prepared from a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea showed advanced structural, optical and electronic properties and enhanced photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen production under visible light irradiation compared to that of C3N4 prepared from neat urea or melamine.
2 Experimental section
Materials and methods
The graphitic C3N4 photocatalysts were separately synthesized using three different precursors i.e. urea, melamine and a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea. Known amounts of melamine, urea and a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea were taken in three separate alumina crucibles with covers. These were calcined at 550 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The prepared graphitic C3N4 are named C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU according to the precursors urea, melamine and melamine–urea mixtures used in the synthesis process, respectively. For the hydrogen evolution studies, 1 wt% Pt was loaded over all the photocatalysts by a photodeposition technique. Photodeposition of Pt was carried out in a closed gas circulation system. Briefly, 1 g of photocatalyst with an appropriate amount of the metal precursor (H2PtCl6) was immersed in 80 vol% methanol solution. The solution was evacuated to completely remove dissolved air and then irradiated with a 125 W high pressure Hg lamp (UV source) for 3 h. After filtration and washing with pure water, the resulting powder was dried in an oven at 343 K for 24 h.
Preparation of photoelectrodes
For the photoelectrochemical measurement studies, the g-C3N4 film electrodes were prepared by an electrophoretic deposition method. The electrophoretic deposition was carried out by taking 40 mg of photocatalyst powder in 50 ml of acetone containing 10 mg iodine powder. To enable good dispersion of the powder photocatalysts in the iodine solution, the mixture was sonicated for 15 min. In this process, iodine reacts with acetone generating H+, thus the photocatalyst particles became positively charged.22 Two parallel FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) electrodes were immersed in the solution with a 10–15 mm separation, and a 50 V bias was applied using a DC power supply for 3 min. With the applied voltage, the positively charged particles are deposited on the cathodic side. The coated area was fixed at 1 cm × 1.5 cm and then dried. The coated electrodes were dried at 120 °C for 3 h before photocurrent measurement.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic reaction was carried out in an inner irradiation type reactor. The photocatalytic reaction was performed by taking 0.05 g of powder photocatalysts in 50 ml of an aqueous solution containing 10 vol% of triethanol amine solution (TEA solution) for H2 evolution. The solution was stirred with a magnetic stirrer, preventing particles from settling at the bottom of the reactor. Prior to irradiation, the reactant solution was first evacuated several times to ensure complete removal of air by purging with nitrogen. A 125 W medium pressure Hg visible lamp was used as the light source and 1 mol l−1 NaNO2 solution was introduced into the water jacket as an internal circulation cooling medium to eliminate light with a wavelength shorter than 400 nm. The evolved gas was collected by a water displacement technique and analyzed by GC-17A using a 5 Å molecular sieve column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A comparison of the retention time of the peak that appeared on the chromatogram with a standard confirmed that the gas was hydrogen.
Analytical characterisation
The crystalline phases of the prepared photocatalysts were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Rigaku Miniflex (set at 30 kV and 15 mA) powder diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Diffraction patterns were recorded over the range 10° < 2θ < 60° at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Optical absorbance of all the photocatalysts were measured by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 100) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory in the region 200–800 nm, with boric acid as the reference. N2 adsorption–desorption studies were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (−197 °C) in an Automated Surface area and Porosity Analyser (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA). Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum (10−5 torr) at 300 °C for 4 h. The percentage of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen were determined by elemental analysers (TruSpec, CHNS analyser) using a standard procedure. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 spectrometer with a non-monochromatised Mg-Kα X-ray source. The energy resolution of the spectrometer was set at 0.8 eV with Mg-Kα radiation at a pass energy of 50 eV. The binding energy correction was performed using the C1s peak of carbon at 284.9 eV as a reference. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples was taken on a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR spectrometer with KBr as the reference sample. FESEM images were recorded by using a Zeiss Supra 55 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were measured on a Philips TECNAI G2 instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The powder particles were supported on a carbon film coated on a 3 mm diameter fine-mesh copper grid. A suspension in ethanol was sonicated and a drop was dripped onto the support film. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with excitation at 300 nm at room temperature. Current voltage was measured using a conventional pyrex electrochemical cell consisted of a prepared electrode as the working electrode, and a platinum wire and a Ag–AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential of the working electrode was controlled by a potentiostat. The cell was filled with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the pH of the solution was maintained at 6. The electrolyte was saturated with nitrogen gas prior to electrochemical measurements. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Versastat 3, Princeton Applied Research) under illumination conditions (λ ≥ 400 nm). Irradiation was performed through the conducting glass using a 300 W Xe lamp with a cold mirror and cutoff filters as necessary. It should be noted that FTO does not show a photoresponse in the solution. In order to determine the stability of the prepared electrode in the electrolyte solution, the photocurrent measurement was repeated in the electrolyte solution for up to four cycles. After each measurement, the electrode was dipped in acetone and dried at 120 °C for 3 h before the next measurement.
3 Results and discussion
Structural characterisation
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU are presented in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns confirmed the formation of graphite like stacking C3N4 layers.13 Two peaks are observed in the XRD patterns for graphitic C3N4 prepared from urea, melamine and a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea. The peak observed at 13.1° corresponds to the in-plane structural packing motif of tristriazine units and is indexed as the (100) peak. This plane corresponds to the hole-to-hole distance (d = 0.675 nm) in the nitride pores.13 Another intense peak at 27.50° corresponds to the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments with a distance of 0.324 nm which is indexed as the (002) peak of the stacking of the conjugated aromatic system.13 Both the peaks are slightly shifted towards a lower angle with significant broadening of the peaks and a slight decrease in the overall intensity for the graphitic C3N4 prepared from a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea. The slightly shifted peak indicates that both the in-plane nitride pores and the interlayer distance between the conjugated aromatic system increase. The conjugated aromatic layers of C3N4-MU are well separated compared to C3N4-M and C3N4-U which is advantageous for the photocatalytic activity.

In order to determine the C, N atomic ratio, elemental analysis of all the samples has been carried out. In the present investigation, the C, N atomic ratio of all the prepared samples vary in the region 0.69–0.71, whereas the theoretical value is 0.75. The C, N ratios in the cases of C3N4-U and C3N4-M are found to be 0.69 and 0.70 whereas the C, N ratio in the case of C3N4-MU is observed to be 0.71. Minor amounts of hydrogen (1.6–1.7%) are also detected due to the presence of uncondensed amino groups and surface adsorbed water molecules.14
FT-IR spectra
In order to confirm the molecular structure of the prepared graphitic carbon nitrides, all the samples are characterised by FT-IR spectra. Fig. 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of all the prepared photocatalysts. From the spectra, it can be seen that all the photocatalysts have absorption bands in the region 810–879 cm−1 corresponding to breathing mode of the triazine units.23,24 The peak observed at 1570–1634 cm−1 is mainly due to the presence of CN bonds and the peaks observed in the region 1258–1480 cm−1 are mostly due to typical vibrations of C–N that contain C–N heterocycles and are generally associated with skeletal stretching vibrations of these aromatic rings.25,26 The broad band in the range 3000–3500 cm−1 can be assigned to uncondensed amine groups present during the synthesis of the photocatalysts and surface adsorbed water molecules.27

DRUV-vis spectra
The optical absorption spectra of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU are presented in Fig. 3(a). The optical absorption spectra reveal that all the materials show an intrinsic semiconductor-like absorption in the blue region of the visible spectrum.9 The band gap energies of all the prepared photocatalysts are calculated using the following equation:28ahv = A(hv − Eg)nwhere a, n, A, and Eg are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, proportionality constant, and band gap energy, respectively. In the above equation, n decides the features of the transitions in a semiconductor i.e. n = 1/2 for direct transitions and n = 2 for indirect transitions. In this case, the optical absorption of the C3N4 samples are directly allowed. The direct band gap energies of all the photocatalysts are observed to be in the region 2.70 to 2.72 eV as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(d), respectively. The band gaps calculated herein correlates well with the values reported in the literature.9,13 In all the cases, the materials are able to absorb light in the same region of the spectrum as all the samples contain similar phases of carbon nitride.28

XPS spectra
XPS spectra are used to reveal the valence state and chemical environment of the constituents of the samples. Fig. 4(a) represents the full scan spectrum of C3N4-MU; here three peaks are obtained at the binding energies of 288 eV, 389 eV and 531 eV for C 1s, N 1s and O 1s, respectively. The regional spectrum of C 1s represents a broad peak which is further deconvoluted into two peaks at the binding energies of 284.9 eV and 288 eV, respectively. The peak located at 284.9 eV is assigned to the C–C bond, and in contrast to the XPS peak at 288 eV is due to the carbon atom bonded to three nitrogen atoms in the g-C3N4 lattice.29Fig. 4(c) depicts the XPS peaks of N 1s, the broad peak of N 1s is deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 397.7 eV, 398.6 eV and 400 eV, respectively. The peak at 397.7 eV is due to the C–N–C bonding while the peaks at 398.6 eV and 400 eV is ascribed to the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 and N–H, respectively.30,31Fig. 4(d) represents the O 1s peak at 531 eV which is assigned to the adsorbed H2O on the photocatalyst surface.30

Photoluminescence spectra
The photoluminescence spectra of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU are presented in Fig. 5. The PL spectra are useful to reveal the migration, transfer and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers.1,2,28 All the samples show only one kind of luminescence peak in the spectrum. The emission peak of the samples is broad and centred at around 450 nm. This strong peak at 450 nm is attributed to the band–band PL phenomenon with the energy of light approximately equal to the band gap energy of C3N4 as the band gap energy of the C3N4 in this investigation is observed to be around 2.7 eV. This near band edge emission is attributed to the direct recombination of excitons through an exciton–exciton collision process.13 A comparative study of the overall intensity of all samples indicates that C3N4 prepared from unimolar ratio of melamine and urea possesses negligible intensity compared to the other samples. So the C3N4 prepared from a unimolar ratio of melamine and urea is very effective for the separation of charge carriers. The strong inhibition of charge carriers' recombination in C3N4-MU showed the potential for higher photocatalytic activity compared to the other samples, as the photocatalytic activity directly relates to the concentration of free charge carriers during the photocatalytic process.

Transmission electron microscopy
The TEM images of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the images, C3N4-U exhibits a two-dimensional agglomerated layered lamellar like morphology. C3N4-M exhibits a sheet like morphology with rolled edges as the sheets are folded. The TEM image of C3N4-MU shows that C3N4 is well exfoliated into a flat sheet like structure. This may be due the combined effects of urea and melamine, which is not possible in the cases of C3N4 prepared from only urea or melamine. So herein, the mixture of urea and melamine helped the good separation of the agglomerated sheets. The sheet layers mainly consisted of graphitic planes with a conjugated aromatic system and are constructed from tristriazine units connected by planar amine groups which is confirmed by the FT-IR spectra. So, it is very important to note that no advanced techniques are required for the good separation of C3N4 sheets.

As the layers of sheets are well separated and distinguished, this method of preparation can further be utilised for the modification of various semiconductors. The HRTEM image of C3N4-MU is presented in Fig. 7. The HRTEM image of C3N4-MU shows lattice planes in regular intervals and plane intervals of 0.326 nm corresponding to the 002 plane of C3N4-MU. It proves the high partial crystallinity of the C3N4 wall.20 The crystalline character is also characterised by a SAED pattern which is the inset in Fig. 7. The SAED pattern revealed that bright continuous concentric rings were attributed to diffraction from the 100 and 002 planes of graphitic C3N4 and is consistent with the XRD data.

FESEM
The surface topography of all the photocatalysts was investigated by FESEM. The FESEM images of all the samples are shown in Fig. S1.† The layered shape morphology is clearly observed in all the samples. The layered agglomerate sheet like morphology is observed in the case of C3N4-U. In the case of C3N4-M, the layers are more folded and agglomerated. In comparison with C3N4-U and C3N4-M, the layers are observed to be flat and separated in the case of C3N4-MU and the result is in good agreement with the TEM study. So the mixture of urea and melamine helped to separate the agglomerated sheets.
N2 adsorption–desorption analysis
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of all the prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8. From the isotherms, it is observed that all the photocatalysts showed type-1 isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops.32 The H3 hysteresis loops might be due to the aggregation of plate-like particles possessing slit-shaped pores which is in close agreement with our observations in the TEM study.32 Of all the photocatalysts, C3N4-U showed the highest BET surface area of 50 m2 g−1, whereas C3N4-M and C3N4-MU showed surface areas of 30 and 10 m2 g−1. The presence of oxygen in the urea precursor is mostly responsible for enlarging the surface area of g-C3N4, mainly due to the formation of CO2 during the polymerization to inhibit grain advance by chemisorption at basic docking sites.33

Photocurrent measurement
The photocurrent spectra of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU are depicted in Fig. 9. From photoelectrochemical measurement studies, it is found that C3N4 is an n-type semiconductor as the photocurrent is generated in the anodic direction under visible light irradiation.28 It is well known that the photocurrent density corresponds to the generation of electrons under light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). Therefore, the larger the current density, the more electrons will be generated, which leads to an enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The photocurrent densities in the cases of C3N4-U and C3N4-M is around 20 μA cm−2 but C3N4-MU shows a current density of 30 μA cm−2vs. the Ag–AgCl reference electrode at pH 6. Therefore it is demonstrated that the C3N4-MU is more sensitive towards light, compared to both C3N4-M and C3N4-U. As the generation of photocurrent is higher in the case of C3N4-MU, more excited charge carriers are developed. Therefore, C3N4-MU with the real potential for hydrogen evolution can be considered to be a suitable photocatalyst for energy conversion.
 Fig. 9  Photocurrent spectra of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU. 
In order to determine the stability of the prepared electrodes in the electrolyte solution, photocurrent measurements were repeatedly carried out in the electrolyte solution for up to four cycles. Nearly the same results were found in all cases. The repeated measurement of the photocurrent spectra is shown in Fig. S2.† The pH of the electrolyte medium doesn't change even after the experiment. The pH of the electrolyte solution before and after the measurement was found to be 6. This observation concludes that the prepared electrode is stable in the electrolyte solution. The detailed mechanism of photocurrent generation over the n-type g-C3N4 electrode surface is explained in the ESI.†
Photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation
The photocatalytic activities of all the samples were tested for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). All the experiments were carried out by taking 50 ml of 10 vol% TEA solution and 0.05 g of the powder photocatalysts. Reference experiments showed that no gas was evolved when the reactor was illuminated in the absence of a catalyst or in the presence of the catalyst without illumination.
All the neat carbon nitride samples are active for hydrogen evolution under visible light illumination even in the absence of any co-catalysts such as noble metals. The time course hydrogen evolution activities of all the neat carbon nitride samples are shown in Fig. 10. From the figure, it can be seen that C3N4-U and C3N4-M could evolve hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. In 4 h of experiment, C3N4-U and C3N4-M were able to generate 25 and 30 μmol of hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation, respectively. But dramatically, C3N4-MU showed a higher rate of hydrogen generation activity compared to C3N4-M and C3N4-U. C3N4-MU was able to generate 48 μmol of hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution activities of all the carbon nitride samples was significantly improved by loading with 1 wt% Pt on the external surface of the photocatalysts. The Pt loaded photocatalysts showed high rates of hydrogen evolution activity as compared to the neat carbon nitride samples. The time course hydrogen evolution activities of all the 1 wt% Pt loaded carbon nitride samples are shown in Fig. 11(a). 1 wt% Pt loaded C3N4-U and C3N4-M were able to generate 60 and 71 μmol of hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. 1 wt% Pt loaded C3N4-MU showed a high rate of hydrogen generation activity compared to C3N4-M and C3N4-U. In the initial 4 h of the hydrogen production experiment, 1 wt% Pt loaded C3N4-MU generated 135 μmol of hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. In order to determine the stability of the C3N4-MU photocatalyst, repeated experiments were carried out with evacuation of the photocatalytic system with an induction period of 4 h, and the results are shown in Fig. 11(b). From the repeated experiment graph, it can be seen that the material was able to maintain a steady rate of hydrogen production of 135 μmol h−1.

To optimise the synthesis of highly active graphitic C3N4 for hydrogen production under visible light, we have also varied the melamine to urea molar ratios to 1:2 and 2:1. For the hydrogen evolution study, 1 wt% Pt was loaded over all the photocatalysts by a photodeposition technique. Some of the characterisation techniques and the photocatalytic activities of the two samples for hydrogen production under visible light are given in ESI.† The preliminary characterisation techniques i.e. XRD (Fig. S4†), optical absorbance spectra (Fig. S5†) and FT-IR (Fig. S6†) suggest the formation of graphitic C3N4 similar to that of C3N4-U, C3N4-M and C3N4-MU. From Fig. S7,† it can be seen that the 1 wt% Pt loaded photocatalysts prepared from melamine and urea with molar ratios of 1:2 and 2:1 show slightly less activity than the sample prepared from neat urea and melamine. The 1 wt% Pt loaded photocatalysts prepared from melamine and urea with molar ratios of 1:2 and 2:1 were able to evolve 50 and 54 μmol of hydrogen gas under visible light irradiation. Owing to the low photocatalytic activity of these samples compared to the corresponding C3N4-U and C3N4-M, we have ignored some of the characterisation techniques for the above samples.
The surface areas of C3N4-M and C3N4-U are observed to be 10 m2 g−1 and 50 m2 g−1 whereas C3N4-MU exhibits a surface area of 30 m2 g−1. In some cases surface area does not play any significant role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity.34,35 So here surface area does not have any correlation with the photocatalytic activity of the materials.
As reported before, g-C3N4 has sufficient thermodynamic potential for hydrogen production.9 The conduction and valence band edge potentials of g-C3N4 are located at −1.12 and 1.57 eV, respectively. So, it has the sufficient thermodynamic potential for easy assessment of the water reduction reaction. The characterisation results of all the synthesized materials show that C3N4-MU has some interesting properties associated with demonstrating the best photocatalytic activity. Firstly, TEM results showed that the sheets are well separated and distinguishable in the case of C3N4-MU. Generally photocatalysts with a layered morphology are highly efficient for hydrogen production reactions.36,37 In the case of C3N4-MU, the layers of the C3N4 sheets are well separated. So in between the layers of the C3N4 unit, TEA solutions can easily accommodate and facilitate the reduction reaction. After light irradiation of the surface of the carbon nitride samples, the holes generated in the C3N4 layer oxidise the TEA solution whereas the photoelectrons reduce H+ to H2 through the Pt co-catalyst loaded on the external surface of the photocatalysts. As the oxidation and reduction reactions takes place on different surfaces of the photocatalysts, this results in efficient separation of charge carriers and consequently results in a high performance of the hydrogen production reaction.36,37 The mechanism of the hydrogen production reaction over 1 wt% Pt loaded carbon nitride samples is shown in Scheme 1.

We propose this to be the one of the reasons for the high photocatalytic activity. Apart from the TEM results, the photoluminescence spectra showed that C3N4-MU exhibits the lowest PL intensity compared to all the photocatalysts. As already discussed, it has a higher tendency to inhibit the recombination of charge carriers. So in the case of C3N4-MU, a higher number of free charge carriers are available for initiation of the photocatalytic reaction and consequently, it exhibits high hydrogen production activity. The PL result is also in good agreement with the result obtained from photoelectrochemical measurements. As C3N4-MU had a high photocurrent, more charge carriers are generated and consequently, C3N4-MU showed high photocatalytic activity. The highest result of hydrogen production obtained from C3N4-MU is consistent with the good separation of the C3N4 sheets, the lowest PL intensity and the high photocurrent generation.
4 Conclusions
Graphitic carbon nitride with excellent photocatalytic activity was successively synthesized by a thermal condensation method. The structural, optical and electronic properties of all the photocatalysts were successfully characterized by XRD, FTIR, XPS, elemental analysis, DRUV-vis spectra, TEM, FESEM, N2 adsorption–desorption, PL spectra and photoelectrochemical techniques. Experimental results indicate that the g-C3N4 prepared from a unimolar ratio of urea and melamine exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity compared to the photocatalysts prepared from neat urea and melamine. The excellent photocatalytic activity of C3N4-MU is in good agreement with its low PL intensity, ordered morphology with good separation of C3N4 sheets and the generation of a high photocurrent. We believe that this preparation method of graphitic C3N4 may give a new insight for the development of advanced visible light driven photocatalysts for energy and environmental applications.
