    , Accepted 24th August 2015First published on 24th August 2015AbstractWe have performed a theoretical investigation using a combination of DFT/TDDFT and molecular dynamics simulations to explain the relationship between bulky donor groups and higher efficiencies for a recent indoline sensitizer YA422 derived from its counterparts IQ4 and YA421, which features an extended donor subunit for use in dye-sensitizer solar cells (DSSCs). Firstly, the absorption and fluorescence properties indicate that the Förster resonance energy transfer occurs only in YA422, where the λems of the donor group D2 matches with the λabs of the whole molecule around the band at 533 nm. Secondly, the simulated heterogeneity between the sensitizer and (TiO2)124 before and after the co-adsorption of the additive CDCA shows that the nearest position of every monomer in YA422 is separated by a row of Ti atoms due to the steric hindrance introduced by the extended donor group, which not only forms the ordered alignment but also prevents aggregation. Meanwhile, the separated position decreases the self-decay which is shown by the complete intramolecular charge transfer in the aggregate structure of (TiO2)124. Furthermore, using a combined Newns–Anderson approach and the Marcus equation, a faster electron injection rate kinject of YA422 (2.27 × 1015 s−1) is obtained compared with those of IQ4 and YA421. We confirm that the higher conversion efficiency achieved by YA422 is caused by its bulky donor group which enhances the electron-donation and transfer. Finally, based on the above insights, we designed a novel sensitizer DW1 which is expected to be a promising candidate due to its enhanced absorption and larger kinject compared with those of YA422.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized-solar cells have aroused great interest in academia and engineering during recent decades due to the urgency of searching for sustainable and clean energy resources all over the world inspired by the first report by the pioneer group.1 Since then, considerable efforts have been made to further improve the conversion efficiency by optimizing the components such as sensitizers,2–8 electrolytes,9–11 photoanodes12–14 and counter electrodes.15,16 Meanwhile, the most critical mechanisms involved in photoinduced electron injection and recombination are still receiving much attention because a deeper understanding of the process of electron transfer can guide the synthesis of potential candidates before the real device is assembled.
In the recent years’ efforts, however, the conversion efficiencies have not improved obviously, especially in pure organic sensitizer-based devices because the π–π stacking in their own solutions17 and on the semiconductor surface (commonly TiO2)18 can lead to fast fluorescence decay from the excited state to the ground state, and deteriorates the electron injection efficiency.19–21 Thus experimental works have focused on co-sensitization via more than one kind of sensitizer22–27 to complement the absorption of each other28,29 which not only covers the panchromatic window extraordinarily but also produces a better short-circuit density Jsc, or co-adsorption with an anti-aggregate additive (commonly chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA))30,31 which aims to separate the sensitizers one by one and achieves a higher open-circuit voltage Voc.
For the process of co-sensitization, the inter-type Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)32–38 from the energy donor to the acceptor (the former features a shorter-wavelength absorption and is coded as a “blue” or energy relay dye, while the latter possesses a longer-wavelength response and is named as a “red” dye) occurs through nonradiative dipole–dipole coupling. This strategy not only decreases the usage of every kind of sensitizer but also improves the overall efficiencies at the compatible ratio.29,34,39,40 However, an observation of the detrimental inter-type FRET via experiment41 says that the weaker dipole–dipole coupling which features the relative vertical orientation can enhance the electron injection in a “blue dye”, while the more parallel orientation strengthens the intermolecular FRET at the expense of the degradation of its electron injection. Alternatively, this inter-type FRET can be transferred to intra-type FRET38,42,43 by end-capping the energy donor in the energy acceptor directly, similarly to an “antenna” where the energy can be transferred without lessening the injection efficiency of the energy donor and this can be embraced.
The representative case is YA422 (Fig. 1),44 an indoline sensitizer derivatized from IQ4 (ref. 44 and 54) and YA421 (ref. 44) (Fig. 1), which achieves an excellent conversion efficiency of η = 10.65% among indoline sensitizer-based devices.45–53 It has been shown that the conversion efficiency is enhanced in the order IQ4, YA421 and YA422 from 7.57% to 8.84% and then to 9.60% in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox, and finally, a further improvement to 10.65% sensitized by YA422 is obtained using gold-doped graphene as the counter electrode.44 Although the enhanced conversion efficiency of YA422 benefits from the extended donor group which can prevent the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox close to the TiO2 surface, the structure–property relationship, photoinduced energy transfer and electron injection rate still need to be understood deeply.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of IQ4, YA421, YA422 and the newly designed candidate DW1 (the D1/D1′ in blue/red, the D2/D2′ in pink/green and D3′ in orange represent the different definitions of extended donor subunits in the analysis of Förster resonance energy transfer). 
Therefore, it is the aim of this paper to explore the relationship between the extended donor part and the final efficiency from the viewpoints of the intra-type FRET, the capacity of anti-aggregation and the electron injection rate. Additionally, the co-adsorption along with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is also considered based on experiments to explain whether it is necessary in the bulky YA421 and YA422.
This paper is organized as follows: methodology introduces the theoretical approach and the model on which the simulations are based. And then the results and discussion analyze (1) the intra-type Förster resonance energy transfer in our defined donor groups (D1(D1′)/D2(D2′), Fig. 1) in YA421/YA422, respectively (2) the influence of the extended donor group on the adsorption mode and the role of CDCA on the anti-aggregation in YA421 and YA422 as well as (3) the electron injection rate of these three sensitizers and (4) the properties of a newly designed sensitizer DW1 (Fig. 1). The final section concludes with a summary.
2. Methodology
2.1 Electronic structure computations
For the optimization of isolated sensitizers in the ground and oxidized states, the density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP55 functional with the 6-31G(d)56/LANL2DZ57 basis set for C, H, O, N, S/Ti atoms was used. The subsequent simulation of frequency based on the optimized geometries was carried out to determine that these geometries were indeed the minima on the potential energy surface. For the intermolecular interaction of the dimeric structure on the TiO2 substrate, the B3LYP-D3 (ref. 58) method was utilized. It is known that the calculated vertical excitation energies of different types of molecules depend on the employed functionals. Test calculations have been carried out for IQ4 with several usually employed functionals including BHandHLYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, and MPW1K, where MPW1K shows the best performance with a discrepancy of 0.01 eV with respect to the experimental data (see Table S1 in ESI†). Thus, the optical properties of isolated and dimeric dyes are studied using the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)-MPW1K/6-31+G(d) method in dichloromethane solvent (modeled by C-PCM59).
To explain the intra-type Förster resonance energy transfer, the geometric optimization of the D1(D1′)/D2(D2′) subunits in their excited state (S1) was carried out in CH2Cl2 solution using the MPW1K/6-31+G(d) method. The maximum emission λems from S1 to S0 was then calculated because the λems is very important in the process of FRET and the emission spectra could not be obtained because the frequencies of the excited state are not available. All the above mentioned calculations were performed using the D.01 version of the Gaussian 09 program.60
To model the heterogeneous interface of the sensitizer and CDCA adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface, a neutral, stoichiometric (TiO2)124 cluster was selected. For the aggregate pattern, the nomenclature is illustrated in Fig. 2, the first monomer located in the (0, 0) position is fixed and another one is labeled by (x, y) coordinates. For aggregate structures of IQ4/YA421/YA422, the interaction positions of (−1, 1), (1, 1), (−3, 1), (3, 1)/(1, 1), (0, 2), (2, 2)/(0, 2), (2, 2) were chosen due to the steric hindrance introduced by the extended donor group. After the optimization of the heterogeneous interface, a molecular dynamics simulation for a total time span of 10 ps was performed to detect the instantaneous variation of distances, such as H-bonds and N⋯N distances which were both located on the donor groups. The above mentioned static optimization and dynamic simulation were carried out using the DFTB+ program package61,62 which has shown adequate accuracy with low computational cost in this field.63–66

2.2 Analysis of intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer
To qualitatively discuss the intra-type Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the energy donor and acceptor, we calculated the orientation factor κ2 and the position vectors |rD − rA|, and the FRET rate is expressed as:67 (1)where τ0 is the lifetime of the excited state for the energy donor, R0 is the Förster radius when the FRET has a 50% probability, and rD and rA are the position vectors of the energy donor and acceptor respectively. R0 can be obtained from the luminescence efficiency QD of the energy donor, the overlap integral of the donor emission spectrum FD and the acceptor absorption spectrum εA along with the orientation factor κ2 of the dipole–dipole coupling:32,67 (2)where NA and n are Avogadro's constant and the refractive index of the medium, respectively. Notably, κ2 can vary from 0 to 4 (κ2 = 0, 1, 4 when the transition dipole moment of the energy donor and acceptor is vertical, parallel and end to end, respectively, and κ2 = 2/3 of the random orientation68) and it is expressed as:41 κ2 = (sinαDsinαAcosβDA − 2cosαDcosαA)2(3)
Accordingly, the angles of the two dipoles are related as:41 (4)where the angles θD, θA are defined in the following chart:  
2.3 Analysis of interfacial electronic coupling
To obtain a relatively accurate electron-transfer time, the Newns–Anderson approach69 was employed to compute the mixing of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the sensitizer with the manifold virtue orbitals on the TiO2. Accordingly, this mixing possesses a Lorentzian distribution:70 (5)
The broadening width ħΓ in eqn (5) is taken as the mean deviation of the LUMO (sensitizer) levels, and is defined as follows:71 (6)where ELUMO(ads) is obtained by a weighted average:71 (7)where Pi and εi are the portion of ith molecular orbital (MO) for the sensitizer and its corresponding MO energy, respectively. Simultaneously, the Pi is evaluated by:71 (8)
And then, the heterogeneous electron-transfer time is calculated using the following formula:72 (9)
2.4 Estimation of electron injection rate
For the aim of comprehending the fast electron injection, the common Marcus equation (eqn (10)) of the following form: (10)is replaced by eqn (11) with a square root function because of the high numerical sensitivity of the exponential function:73 (11)where in eqn (11), χ is the inner reorganization energy which contains the solute part χsen and the solvent part χsol: (12)
Accordingly, χsen can be defined as: (13) (14)where the , ,  and  contribute to the energies obtained from the excited state in the form of the cation, the energies of the relaxed excited state, the cationic energies calculated in the geometry of the excited state and the energies of the relaxed cationic state, respectively.
As for the content related to χsol, it is expressed by: (15)where RD, RA, R denote the radii of the donor, the acceptor and the distances between their centers, and ε∞ and εs stand for the optical frequency and static relative dielectric constants of the solvent, respectively. And Δq is the amount of transferred electrons.
Additionally, the coupling constant VRP is estimated via the Generalized Mulliken–Hush formalism (GMH):73 (16)where μRP and μR (μP) stand for the transition dipole moment, and the permanent dipole of the excited and cationic states, respectively. In eqn (16), ΔERP is calculated by: (17)
In eqn (17), EP and ER contribute to the energies of the product (cationic state) and the reactant (excited state), respectively.
Furthermore, to compute the electron injection driving force ΔGinject in eqn (11), we assume that the process occurs via a relaxation pathway, thus ΔGinject can be calculated by: ΔGinject = Esen*ox-relax − ESCCB(18)where Esen*ox-relax is the excited state oxidation, and it can be expressed as: Esen*ox-relax = Esenox − Esen0–0(19)
In eqn (19), Esenox-relax and Esen0–0 represent the ground state oxidation and the “0–0” absorption energy, respectively, and the latter one can be written as: (20) (21) ESi(QS0) = ES0(QS0) + ΔESi(22)where ESi(QS0), ESi(QSi) and ES0(QS0) contribute to the energies for the excited state Si at the ground state S0, the energies obtained from the optimized excited state Si and the energies in the ground state S0, respectively. Additionally, ΔESi is the excitation energy from S0 → Si.
For the analysis of the electron injection rate, we only use the data obtained from eqn (11) unless otherwise noted. And we only provide an outline of the classical Marcus theory as the detail is given in ref. 73.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Intra-type Förster resonance energy transfer
As we know, the prerequisite for a high efficiency sensitizer is that the absorption can match with the solar radiation in the panchromatic range. Inspired by the more prominent conversion efficiency of YA421 and YA422 compared with that of IQ4, the optical properties of these isolated sensitizers in CH2Cl2 solution have been simulated to explore the critical role of the extended donor part D1/(D1′) and D2/(D2′) (Fig. 1) in YA421 and YA422, respectively. The simulated spectra, transition characterizations and the oscillator strengths f are summarized in Fig. 3(a) and Table 1. From Fig. 3(a), one can find that the maximum absorptions λabs among these sensitizers are all around 530 nm and the oscillator strength f related to this band improves in the order IQ4(1.11) < YA421 (1.16) < YA422 (1.26). However, in the region of 350–420 nm, the peaks are in the order of YA422 (367 nm), IQ4 (405 nm) and YA421 (407 nm). These results are perfectly in line with the observation from experiments44 and imply that the extended donor moiety can improve the absorption strength in the lower energy region and clearly affect the higher energy band.

In view of the enhanced absorption strength around the band at 530 nm and the prominent Jsc of the YA421 and YA422-based devices, the intra-type FRET from the extended donor group to the energy acceptor has been explored. Initially, the absorption and fluorescence (S1 → S0) properties are simulated to detect whether the fluorescence and absorption in the energy donor and acceptor in YA421 and YA422, respectively, are matched. We assume two different energy transfer paths in the two sensitizers: the first one is that the energy transfer is initially triggered from the D1′/D2′ segment (in red and green, Fig. 1) and in the second it is supposed to be from the D1/D2 segment (in blue and pink, Fig. 1). The absorption λabs and fluorescence λems of S1 → S0 in these defined donor parts have been simulated and the corresponding data is summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 3(b–e). From Table 2, one can find that the λabs of D1/D1′ is around 310/235 nm, respectively, and the λems is around 349/288 nm, respectively. Via the comparison of the spectra in Fig. 3(b), the λabs of 235 nm in D1′ is not involved in the absorption in YA421, and the λems of 288 nm in D1′ does not match with the λabs in YA421. While in Fig. 3(c), the λabs of 310 nm in D1 and the absorption of 300–400 nm in the A–π–A backbone are consistent with the absorption in YA421. Although the absorption band at around 310 nm of D1 overlaps with the higher energy excitation of YA421, the λems at around 349 nm in D1 does not contribute to the energy transfer because the fabs of YA421 in this region is not enhanced, namely, the fems (1.08) of D1 is stronger than that of the fabs (0.98) related to the band at 315 nm in YA421. Thus, it is speculated that the intra-type FRET does not occur in YA421 based on above analysis. Similarly to the absorption of D1′, the λabs of 292 nm in D2′ also does not involve the absorption of YA422 (Fig. 3(d)), and the λems of 348 nm in D2′ is not compatible with the absorption of 367 nm in YA422. While for D2, the λabs of 370 nm is overlapped with the band at 367 nm in YA422, and the absorption of 300–450 nm in the A–π–A backbone is also consistent with the absorption of 350–450 nm in YA422 (Fig. 3(e)). Furthermore, the λems of D2 at around 533 nm matches well with the absorption at 533 nm in YA422 where the fabs (1.26) in YA422 of this band is enhanced obviously with respect to the fems (0.93) of the band in D2. Thus, the intra-type FRET might occur only in YA422 that has contributions from the D2 segment.

Based on eqn (1)–(4), the position vectors |rD − rA| and the orientation factors κ2 between the energy donor and acceptor for isolated YA421 and YA422 are 4.52 Å and 5.28 Å, and 0.70 and 0.63, respectively. Since a smaller |rD − rA| and larger κ2 indicates faster FRET, it seems the FRET capability of YA422 is weaker than that of YA421. Note that since most sensitizers in DSSCs are adsorbed on TiO2 rather than being in solution, we further examined these two factors for sensitizers@TiO2 during a 10 ps dynamics simulation. As shown in Fig. 4, YA422 is characterized by a smaller |rD − rA| and larger κ2 than those of YA421. This highlights the importance of environmental effects and coincides with the optical clues.

3.2 Influence of the extended donor on the adsorption mode
In general, a sensitizer with a co-planar backbone is inclined to aggregate on the TiO2 substrate and this aggregation contributes to a disordered alignment whereas this can be hindered via a co-adsorbent additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).48 Thus, the sensitizers adsorbed on the TiO2 substrate have been simulated before and after the CDCA co-adsorption to explore the relationship between the bulky donor group and the capacity of anti-aggregation. According to experiments,74–76 the adsorption mode of sensitizers on a TiO2 anatase (101) surface is commonly found in three patterns: monodentate, bidentate chelating and bidentate bridging77–79 and the latter one has been shown to be more stable in sensitizers with 2-cyanoacrylic acid and cyanoacrylate as anchor groups. Our previous paper63 has reported that sensitizer C258 with cyanoacrylate as the anchor group can adsorb on a TiO2 anatase (101) surface in monodentate and bidentate bridging modes and the latter one is the most stable. Although the other bidentate bridging mode has been observed where the chemisorption by two Ti–O bonds transfers to the Ti–NC and Ti–O bonds and is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding,80,81 we only use the common bidentate bridging mode in this paper. Notably, for the discussion of the aggregate pattern on the substrate, we define the first monomer located in the (0, 0) position as fragment F1 and the second monomer in another position as fragment F2 for simplification based on Fig. 2.82 Additionally, the oxygen atoms belonging to cyanoacrylic acid in the sensitizer and substrate are labeled as OS1/S2 and OTi, and the titanium atoms bonded to OS1/S2 are denoted as Ti1/2 (Fig. 5) to make a clear distinction in the following analysis.
 Fig. 5  The three main carboxylic/carboxylate adsorption modes in the aggregate patterns of IQ4, YA421 and YA422. 
Based on the structure of the monomeric structure@substrate, the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid in every sensitizer transfers to the adjacent oxygen on the substrate and the distances of Ti1–OS1 and Ti2–OS2 are ∼2.02 to 2.10 Å (see Table S2 in ESI†). While for the dimeric structure, different situations are found in YA421 and YA422 and the bidentate bridging in F1 and F2 changes to the monodentate mode (M1 or M2) via H-bonds of OS2⋯H–OTi or OS2–H⋯OTi (Fig. 5). However, this situation is unchanged in IQ4, which reveals that the distances of C–OS1/C–OS2 (∼1.28 to 1.30 Å) and Ti1–OS1/Ti2–OS2 (∼2.02 to 2.10 Å) are comparable to that of the monomeric structure on the substrate (Table S2†). In view of the conspicuous transformation of the adsorption mode, we will analyze the effect of the extended donor subunit on the adsorption mode in YA421 and YA422 with respect to IQ4, and compare with the situation after the CDCA has been co-adsorbed.

3.2.1 Adsorption mode of aggregated YA421. 
For dimeric YA421, Fig. 6(a–c) shows the dynamical distances of H-bonds, and N⋯N interactions which are both located in the donor group in F1 and F2 as well as the interaction between the two monomers as a function of the time span of 10 ps before and after the CDCA co-adsorption. Firstly, we analyzed the change in the H-bonding in all dimeric structures. For the (1, 1) pattern (Fig. 6(a)), the H-bond of F1 and F2 (solid in black and pink) maintains a stable value of ∼0.90 to 1.00 Å before the CDCA is co-adsorbed, while an obvious fluctuation at 2 ps is observed with the presence of CDCA (dot in pink). Moving to the (0, 2) pattern (Fig. 6(b)), a similar variation in the H-bonding is observed compared with the (1, 1) pattern before the CDCA co-adsorption while the fluctuation presents after the CDCA co-adsorption. As for the (2, 2) pattern, the up and down of the H-bond length is negligible in the simulated time range before and after the CDCA co-adsorption.
 Fig. 6  The distances of H-bonds and N⋯N interactions (both located in the indoline group) and the intermolecular interaction energies (vs. the points-in-time) in a series of aggregate patterns in YA421: (a) for the (1, 1) (b) for the (0, 2) and (c) for the (2, 2) patterns (solid and dotted line in black and pink represents the H-bond in F1 (black) and F2 (pink) before and after CDCA co-adsorption. The lines in gray and magenta stand for the distances of the N⋯N interactions between F1 and F2 before and after CDCA co-adsorption, respectively. The interaction energies are marked in blue and green before and after CDCA co-adsorption, respectively). 
Subsequently, the averaged distances of the N⋯N interactions are characterized to reflect the capacity of anti-aggregation. For the (1, 1) pattern (Fig. 6(a)), the variation in the N⋯N distances is unobvious before and after CDCA co-adsorption (∼5.57/5.47 Å, in gray and purple, respectively). For the (0, 2) pattern, this quantity is decreased from ∼7.76 to 7.25 Å after co-adsorption with CDCA. Similarly, this value in the (2, 2) pattern is also decreased after CDCA co-adsorption. These decreased N⋯N distances in the latter two patterns indicate that the adsorption with CDCA could contribute to a stronger attraction between F1 and F2, then the parasitic lateral transfer of holes located in the donor moiety83 can lessen the efficiency of fast regeneration by redox media, consequently decreasing the Jsc.
Furthermore, the capacity of anti-aggregation can be characterized by the instantaneous intermolecular interaction between F1 and F2. For the (1, 1) pattern, the interaction is comparable before and after the co-adsorption with CDCA (the average values are both around 2.99 eV, in blue and green). For the (0, 2) pattern, the average interaction is weakened from ∼1.97 to 1.47 eV upon the CDCA co-adsorption. However, in the (2, 2) pattern, this magnitude is slightly decreased by ∼0.04 eV after the co-adsorption with CDCA, indicating that the extended donor group possesses the capacity of anti-aggregation without the co-adsorption with CDCA. Meanwhile, the distances of the H-bonds and the N⋯N interactions show that the monomers F1 and F2 in the (2, 2) pattern are more stable on the substrate before and after the CDCA co-adsorption with respect to the (1, 1) and (0, 2) patterns. On the other hand, one could speculate that the transferred adsorption mode from bidentate bridging (monomeric structure) to monodentate (dimeric structure) is caused by the van der Waals interaction via the two hexyloxy chains. Therefore, we deduce that the appropriate alignment of YA421 on the substrate is the (2, 2) pattern as it not only guarantees compact adsorption but also prevents π–π stacking.


3.2.2 Adsorption mode of aggregated YA422. 
In this section, the dynamic distances of the H-bonds, and N⋯N interactions between F1 and F2 as well as the interaction between the two monomers vs. the 10 ps time span are discussed, and the corresponding data are summarized in Fig. 7(a) and (b). For the (0, 2) pattern (Fig. 7(a)), the distances of the H-bonds are around 0.99 Å before the CDCA co-adsorption, but with the CDCA presence, a small change is detected from ∼0.90 to 2.00 Å in the initial 2 ps and then a distance of ∼0.98 Å is maintained in the later 8 ps. However in the (2, 2) pattern, this quantity does not display an evident change in the whole time span before and after the co-adsorption with CDCA.

The lines in gray and magenta stand for the distances of N⋯N interactions between F1 and F2 before and after CDCA co-adsorption, respectively. The interaction energies are marked in blue and green before and after CDCA co-adsorption, respectively). 
On the other hand, the N⋯N distances in the (0, 2) pattern tend to shorten from ∼7.50 to 7.20 Å after the CDCA co-adsorption. Similarly, this value in the (2, 2) pattern also decreases from ∼7.81 to 6.51 Å with the presence of CDCA. Meanwhile, the average interaction between F1 and F2 in the (0, 2) pattern is ∼2.96 and ∼3.00 eV before and after the CDCA co-adsorption, respectively. While in the (2, 2) pattern, these quantities are both about 2.40 eV independent of the CDCA co-adsorption. Based on the analysis above, it is clear that YA422 can prevent the aggregation, and this is shown by the negligible fluctuation in the H-bond distances as well as the more separated donor part before CDCA co-adsorption. Moreover, the interaction also shows that the stable alignment can form in the (0, 2) and (2, 2) patterns without the help of CDCA. In brief, the YA422 adsorbed on the substrate might be in the (2, 2) pattern like YA421 as the distances of the H-bonds and N⋯N interactions are comparable except for the relatively stronger interaction between F1 and F2, which is attributed to the van der Waals interaction via more hexyloxy chains in YA422 which can hamper the aggregation and ensure a denser alignment.

3.3 Optical properties of the aggregate structures in sensitizers
As we know, the absorption of a sensitizer on the substrate commonly presents a blue- or red-shift due to the H- or J-aggregation.84,85 In view of the current situation, the absorption of the aggregate structures on the substrate has been simulated to further detect the influence of the extended donor part on the optical properties. The calculated data are summarized in Table 3. Firstly, for IQ4, the maximum absorption λmax of all aggregate structures is blue-shifted and the oscillator strengths f are all strengthened compared to the monomeric structure (Table 1). Meanwhile, except for the transition of λmax in the (3, 1) pattern which originates from H → L+1, the transition in other patterns is caused by H−1 → L and this is different from the H → L transition of the monomeric IQ4. Table 3 also shows the transition isodensity plotting of these dimeric structures to distinguish the character intuitively. It is noted that the transition from H → L+1 in the (3, 1) structure features the intramolecular transition which is nearly localized on F1. While for the (1, 1), (−1, 1) and (−3, 1) structures, the transition related to H−1 → L shows a combined intramolecular and intermolecular character. Thus the complete intramolecular transition only observed in the (3, 1) structure indicates that the appropriate alignment can decrease the self-decay in the sensitizer monolayer and then enhance the electron injection.

As for the dimers of YA421, the λmax and f of all structures is red-shifted and strengthened with respect to the monomeric structure. In the (0, 2) and (2, 2) structures, the transition related to λmax is H−1 → L+1, whereas in the (1, 1) structure, the main contribution is triggered by H−1 → L. The isodensity plotting for the (1, 1) structure shows that the transition is an intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) from F1 to F2, whereas for the (0, 2) and (2, 2) structures, the intramolecular CT from H−1 → L+1 contributes to the transition. This picture of intramolecular CT in the (0, 2) and (2, 2) structures is similar to the IQ4-(3, 1) structure in that the intramolecular CT benefits from the well separated F1 and F2.
Regarding the dimers of YA422, it is similar to YA421 as the λmax of all the dimeric structures is red-shifted and along with having enhanced intensity. At the same time, the λmax of the (0, 2) structure is caused by H → L+1 whereas it is attributed to H−3 → L in the (2, 2) structure, and these two transitions both feature a prominent intramolecular CT centered on F1. Based on the above analysis of the transition properties, the blue-shift decreases in the order of IQ4, YA421 and Y422, and simultaneously, the transition character is altered from the mixed inter- and intramolecular transition to the complete intramolecular CT from IQ4 to YA421 and YA422, which alleviates the self-quenching from the excited state to the ground state. The result elucidates that the extended donor moiety can form a dense alignment of YA421 and YA422 on the substrate as well as guarantee a higher absorption and Jsc potentially.
3.4 Electronic coupling and electron injection rate
It is known that the photoinduced heterogeneous electron transfer is related to the electronic coupling between the sensitizer's LUMO and the manifold virtue orbitals on the TiO2 substrate.70,86 Therefore, to investigate the influence of the extended donor group on the mixing between the sensitizer's LUMO and the conduction band of the substrate, the Lorentzian broadening ρLUMO(E) and coupling strength of every sensitizer adsorbed on the substrate passing from IQ4 to YA422 have been modeled based on the Newns–Anderson approach. By using eqn (5), the obtained Lorentzian broadening is fitted in Fig. 8(a–c), and the ELUMO(ads), the broadening width ħΓ and the electron injection time τ are also obtained using eqn (6)–(9), respectively. The results show that the mixing of the LUMO on the sensitizer (ELUMO(ads)) with the manifold unoccupied orbitals of TiO2 are comparable in these three sensitizers (−2.99, −2.99 and −2.96 eV for IQ4, YA421 and YA422, respectively), simultaneously, similar ћΓ values of 0.166 among these sensitizers are obtained. This little difference in ELUMO(ads) among our considered cases is attributed to the subtle variation in molecular structure where only the donor group is extended. Meanwhile, the estimated electron-transfer times all fall in the femtosecond time range and there is little difference from IQ4 to YA422 (4.08, 3.96 and 3.96 fs, respectively).
 Fig. 8  Lorentzian broadening ρLUMO(E) of (a) IQ4, (b) YA421 and (c) YA422. The corresponding fitting parameters ELUMO(ads), broadening width ћΓ and lifetime τ are displayed. 
In view of the subtle difference in the electron-transfer time simulated by the Newns–Anderson approach above, the electron injection rate based on the Marcus equation has been evaluated to further explore the relationship between the extended donor unit and the outstanding efficiency for YA421 and YA422 with respect to that for IQ4. The required parameters to calculate the electron injection rate based on eqn (12)–(22) are collected in Table 4. Based on eqn (11), a smaller reorganization energy χsen and larger coupling constant VRP and injection driving force ΔGinject can achieve a faster injection rate kinject. From Table 4, it is noted that the ΔGinject values in all sensitizers are comparable (the differences are ∼0.02 to 0.04 eV), while χsen and VRP among these sensitizers varies clearly. For IQ4, the larger χsen (0.69 eV) and smaller VRP (0.25 eV) can generate a relatively low kinject of 0.74 × 1015 s−1. As for YA421, the estimated kinject is about 0.28 × 1015 s−1, and the reason for this lower quantity is due to the large χsen of 0.77 eV which disfavors the electron transfer although a high VRP of 0.40 eV is obtained. Contrarily, for YA422, although the relatively small VRP of 0.36 eV is calculated with respect to YA421, it still displays the largest kinject of 2.27 × 1015 s−1, and this benefits from the smallest χsen (0.59 eV) of all sensitizers, which merits the electron transfer and the successive injection. The above results elucidate that the extended donor group in YA422 can enhance the electron injection rate clearly and ensure a higher conversion efficiency compared to the other sensitizer-based devices.

3.5 Design of a potential sensitizer
Based on the above analysis of intra-type FRET, we designed a new sensitizer DW1, where the donor D2′ in YA422 is replaced by a more extended moiety D3′ (see Fig. 1) based on ref. 43. The simulated absorption spectrum of DW1 in comparison to IQ4 and YA422 is shown in Fig. 9. The obtained results show that the enhanced intra-FRET in DW1 is demonstrated by the near 3-fold higher absorption strength around 530 nm and an almost 1.26-fold increase in kinject (2.87 × 1015 s−1) compared to that of YA422 (2.27 × 1015 s−1). Thus, it is concluded that end-capped bulky donor groups can strengthen the absorption and increase the electron injection rate, and we speculate that this newly designed sensitizer DW1 could be a potential candidate for future high-efficiency DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In this study, inspired by the prominent conversion efficiency of the YA422-based solar cell, DFT/TDDFT combined with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the relationship between the extended donor group and the higher efficiency compared with IQ4 and YA421-based cells. It is found that the intra-type FRET only occurs in YA422 where the energy transfers to the A–π–A backbone via the luminescence of the D2 subunit around the band at 533 nm and the absorption strength fabs of this band is enhanced compared to that of IQ4 and YA421 with the smaller donor size. Meanwhile, the tendency towards aggregation in YA422 is lessened compared with IQ4 and YA421 due to the steric hindrance introduced by the extended donor group, as a result, the self-decay in the aggregate structure is weakened as evidenced by the fact that the mixed intra- and intermolecular transition in IQ4 transfers to the complete intramolecular transition in YA422. Additionally, the combined Newns–Anderson approach and Marcus equation verify that a faster kinject is achieved by YA422 compared to IQ4 and YA421. Our research provides fundamental insights on the fact that the extension of the donor part by a suitably electron donating group can potentially enhance the conversion efficiency, and this has been applied to design a potential candidate DW1 that possesses the donor D3′ which not only strengthens the absorption but also achieves a larger electron injection rate.
