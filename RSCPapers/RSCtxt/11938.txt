    , Accepted 17th April 2020First published on 4th May 2020AbstractDesigning low-cost and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vitally important for water splitting. Herein, we synthesize Co2−xNixO2 (0 < x < 1.0) hexagonal nanosheets with different Co/Ni molar ratios via a facile coprecipitation process followed by calcination under an Ar atmosphere. Changing the Co/Ni molar ratios of the Co2−xNixO2 products is found to have a momentous influence on the microstructures, specific surface areas and electrocatalytic performances. At a Co/Ni molar ratio of 0.6, the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet exhibits the largest specific surface area of 60.63 m2 g−1, the best OER with an onset overpotential of 278.5 mV, and HER of 72.8 mV as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, the minimum Tafel slope is 113.6 mV dec−1 for OER and 77.4 mV dec−1 for HER. The Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet has excellent OER and HER activity at 0.1 mg cm−2 trace loading. Moreover, we construct an overall water splitting cell using the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 bifunctional electrocatalyst in a two-electrode system to further demonstrate the practical application, which needs a cell voltage of 1.75 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and exhibits great long-term stability. These results provide an efficient strategy for the rational design of Co-based oxides towards bifunctional overall water electrocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Water splitting is considered to be one of the most promising solutions for hydrogen production,1–4 and can be divided into two half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the anode.5,6 For the overall water splitting process the change in the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is 237 kJ mol−1,7 and the required minimum voltage is 1.23 V.8–10 However, in practical applications, an additional high overpotential (0.6–0.9 V) is required to drive the HER/OER reactions at an adequately high rate,11 which seriously restricts the commercial applications of overall water splitting. Precious metals and their derivatives such as Pt/C, RuO2 and IrO2 have excellent OER and/or HER catalytic activity due to strongly decreasing the overpotential of water splitting.12–14 However, their scarcity and high cost have prevented their widespread application.15 Therefore, designing and exploring earth-abundant, low-cost and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts towards HER and OER has become a key topic for overall water splitting.16–18
Currently, overall water splitting electrocatalysts are mainly composed of first-row transition metals and their derivatives. Iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) have drawn much attention because of their redox chemistry, electrochemical stability, economical nature and easy accessibility.19–21 Compared with other metal elements, Co has the redox potential which is closest to the potential for the reduction of oxygen to water, and its different cationic oxidation states make the catalytic activity of Co-based oxides better.22,23 Hence, numerous Co-based oxides with different microstructures and compositions have been widely reported.24–26 Ye et al.27 developed a Ni-based metal–organic supramolecular electrocatalyst denoted Ni-9AC-AD with outstanding performance for overall water splitting. Dong et al.28 reported a one-step method for the synthesis of porous hollow Co3O4 polyhedrons, which were used as electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. I. Abidat et al.29 explored NixCo3−xO4 spinels based on Co3O4 as OER catalysts with controlled Co/Ni atomic ratios. R. P. Antony et al.30 demonstrated the effect of NixCo3−xO4−y nanocages with different compositions on the chemical characteristics. It is worth noting that among these Ni–Co binary oxides, CoNiO2 has a special rock-type structure (Fig. 1a), which is formed via Ni partially replacing Co in CoO.31 CoNiO2 has better electrical conductivity than NiCo2O4.32 However, as a novel electrocatalyst, CoNiO2 with different Co/Ni molar ratios is rarely reported for overall water splitting with bifunctional OER and HER activities.33

Herein, we synthesize Co2−xNixO2 with different Co/Ni molar ratios by a simple coprecipitation method followed by a calcination process under an Ar atmosphere. The effect of Co2−xNixO2 (0 < x < 1.0) nanosheets with different Co/Ni molar ratios on microstructures and electrocatalytic performances is systematically investigated. With the increasing Co/Ni molar ratio, the rock-type lattice parameters of Co2−xNixO2 are gradually increased. When the Co/Ni molar ratio is 1.4/0.6, Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the best electrocatalytic performance for both OER and HER at 0.1 mg cm−2 trace loading. Thus, Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is used as the anode and the cathode for an overall water splitting cell, which exhibits superior activity and stability. These results provide a new research strategy and theoretical basis for bifunctional overall water splitting.
2. Experimental section
All reagents are analytical grade reagents and can be used directly without any further purification. The coprecipitation and calcination method was used to synthesize Co2−xNixO2 (0 < x < 1.0) as follows. Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in deionized water to form a 3 M mixed solution. Then 3 M NaOH solution as a precipitant and a mixed metal salt solution (molar ratio of NaOH:metal salt = 1.5:1) were added dropwise into another beaker with deionized water at the same time. The mixed solution was stirred for 4 hours at room temperature to obtain the precursors. The precursors were washed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol until the pH was neutral. After drying at 80 °C for 12 hours, the precursors were calcined under protective argon at 400 °C for 3 hours with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to obtain the Co2−xNixO2 products, where x represented the molar amount of Ni element in Co2−xNixO2.
Details of material characterization and electrochemical measurements are shown in the ESI† based on our previous work.34
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1b shows the X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) patterns of Co2−xNixO2 with x from 0 to 1.0. The shapes of these diffraction peaks are not very sharp and the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of these diffraction peaks is relatively large. At x = 0, these diffraction peaks match the diffraction peaks of CoO, indicating that pure phase CoO is synthesized successfully. The XRD pattern of CoO at x = 0 has diffraction peaks at 2θ = 36.5°, 42.4°, 61.5°, and 73.7°, which are indexed to its (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively. With x increasing from 0.2 to 1.0, the diffraction peaks of all the Co2−xNixO2 samples match the pure CoNiO2 rock phase (vertical line with red color) very well and show no impurity peaks. These diffraction peaks of the (111) and (200) planes gradually shift to larger angles with increasing x (Fig. 1c), due to the increment of the lattice parameters from 4.235 Å to 4.247 Å for CoNiO2. The relationship between the lattice parameters and the x value is shown in Fig. 1d. The lattice parameters of the Co2−xNixO2 sample at x = 0 are 4.264 Å, which are similar to the lattice parameters of CoO (4.26 Å). As the x value increases from 0.2 to 1.0, the lattice parameters of Co2−xNixO2 are 4.235 Å, 4.236 Å, 4.238 Å, 4.244 Å and 4.247 Å, respectively, which are close to the lattice parameters of CoNiO2 (4.24 Å). The lattice parameters of Co2−xNixO2 with x from 0.2 to 1.0 gradually increase because the ionic radius of Ni2+ (0.69 Å) is larger than Co2+ (0.65 Å) and the amount of Ni is increasing. According to the XRD patterns, the lattice parameters of all the Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles can be calculated as shown in Table S1.† Fig. S1† shows that the diffraction peaks of the XRD patterns of Co2−xNixO2 precursor materials (x from 0 to 1.0) are shifted to higher degrees too.

Fig. 2a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption curves of Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles with different Co/Ni molar ratios. The curves overlap completely in regions with relatively low pressure and hysteresis loops appear in regions with relatively high pressure, which are H3 type. This suggests that all the samples have typical hysteresis loop characteristics of mesoporous materials. According to the N2 adsorption–desorption curve measurements, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas can be calculated. The BET specific surface areas of Co2−xNixO2 with x from 0 to 1.0 are 34.64, 47.96, 51.36, 60.63, 59.82 and 52.36 m2 g−1, respectively. Obviously, the specific surface area of the CoNiO2 phase is larger than that of the CoO structure, and Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the largest specific surface area. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore diameter distribution further indicates that the synthesized Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles have mesoporous structures, as shown in Fig. 2b. The pore diameters of Co2−xNixO2 are 40.09 nm for x = 0, 29.97 nm for x = 0.2, 21.42 nm for x = 0.4, 14.64 nm for x = 0.6, 13.60 nm for x = 0.8, and 13.22 nm for x = 1.0. It is not difficult to see that the pore diameters decrease with the increasing value of x. Moreover, the pore volumes are 0.35 cm3 g−1 for x = 0, 0.36 cm3 g−1 for x = 0.2, 0.27 cm3 g−1 for x = 0.4, 0.29 cm3 g−1 for x = 0.6, 0.26 cm3 g−1 for x = 0.8, and 0.23 cm3 g−1 for x = 1.0. This phenomenon indicates that as the amount of Ni increases, the micropores of the Co2−xNixO2 samples gradually collapse, causing the pore volume and pore diameter to decrease.29,35,36

To further observe the microstructures of Co2−xNixO2 with different Co/Ni molar ratios, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are shown in Fig. S2a–S2f.† The SEM images show that the microstructures are transformed from nanoparticles of CoO to hexagonal nanosheets of Co2−xNixO2 with different Co/Ni molar ratios. Fig. 3a shows a high-resolution SEM image of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheets with x = 0.6, where a large number of irregular mesopores are distributed on the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 hexagonal nanosheets. These mesopores are generated by the release of gas over the course of the disintegration procedure of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 precursors under high temperature conditions, and the diameter of these mesopores is about 20 nm. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 with x = 0.6 are further observed, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has a regular hexagonal nanosheet morphology assembled with numerous nanoparticles, and the surface of the hexagonal nanosheet has abundant mesopores. In Fig. 3b, the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet is a regular hexagon with a side length of about 126 nm. Meanwhile, Fig. S3† shows that the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 confirms the Co/Ni molar ratio of 2.31, which is very close to the theoretical value of 2.33. Fig. 3c shows that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 maintains an excellent crystalline structure. The measured interplanar spacing values are approximately 0.234 nm and 0.236 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of the CoNiO2 cubic rock-phase, which are consistent with the XRD results. Fig. 3d shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 and clearly presents hexagonal nanosheet concentric rings in the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222) and (400) planes. The SAED pattern indicates that the crystal structure of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is polycrystalline. Fig. 3e shows the elemental mapping images of Co1.4Ni0.6O2. It suggests that the Ni, Co and O elements have a uniform distribution and further confirms the nanosheet microstructure of Co1.4Ni0.6O2.

The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for different electrocatalysts is determined by solar-powered fuel synthesis.37,38Fig. 4a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles with different Co/Ni molar ratios, nickel foam (NF) and Pt/C versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The overpotentials of Co2−xNixO2 are found to decrease for x from 0 to 0.6 and increase for x from 0.6 to 1.0. Co1.4Ni0.6O2 shows the smallest overpotential (204.8 mV at 10 mA cm−2), which is far less than the overpotential of the other Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles. The overpotential of Pt/C is 142.5 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, the HER overpotential of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is compared with the electrocatalytic performances of HER non-noble electrocatalysts in recent years (Table 1). It is not difficult to see from Table 1 that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has a smaller overpotential than the other HER non-noble metal electrocatalysts under the trace loading condition at 0.1 mg cm−2.

Fig. 4b shows the Tafel slopes of Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles with different Co/Ni molar ratios and Pt/C, which indicates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the smallest Tafel slope (77.4 mV dec−1) compared with the other Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles. In Fig. 4b, the Tafel slope of Pt/C is 45.8 mV dec−1. Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the smallest overpotential and Tafel slope (Fig. 4d) because it has the largest BET specific surface area and pore volume, which makes the diffusion of electrons easier. Fig. 4c shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement in the electrode frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz. It is worth noting that the Nyquist curve is merely concentrated in the high-frequency region, indicating that the semicircles in the high-frequency range of the Nyquist plot are attributed to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and solution resistance (Rs), which are related to the electrocatalytic kinetics, with a lower value corresponding to a faster reaction rate. The diameters of the Nyquist semicircles, the charge-transfer resistances (Rct) of Co2−xNixO2, decrease for x from 0 to 0.6, then increase from 0.6 to 1.0. Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the smallest Nyquist semicircle diameter (1.52 Ω) of all the Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles. It indicates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has a lower charge transfer resistance and higher activity in the HER. The inset of Fig. 4c shows the fitting equivalent circuit. Rs, Rct and C represent the resistance of the electrolyte, the resistance of charge transfer and the constant phase element of the double layer, respectively.44–46Fig. 4e shows a long-term HER stability test of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which maintains about 94% of the initial value after the 30000 s long-term stability measurement. The initial LSV curve and the LSV curve after the stability test of the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4f. After the stability test, the overpotential of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is only 15 mV higher than the initial overpotential value.
In order to further evaluate the electrocatalysis performance of Co2−xNixO2 nanosheets, the OER activities of Co2−xNixO2 are evaluated in a standard three-electrode system in an O2-saturated solution. Fig. S4† shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves from −0.2 V to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 to activate the Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles with different Co/Ni molar ratios. Fig. 5a shows the LSV curves of all the Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles, NF and RuO2versus RHE. The onset potentials (1.0 mA cm−2vs. RHE) of Co2−xNixO2 are 1.588 V for x = 0, 1.645 V for x = 0.2, 1.589 V for x = 0.4, 1.508 V for x = 0.6, 1.594 V for x = 0.8, and 1.616 V for x = 1.0, and 1.682 V and 1.319 V for NF and RuO2, respectively. The overpotentials of the Co2−xNixO2 nanoparticles with x from 0 to 1.0 and RuO2 at 10 mA cm−2 current density are 426.4 mV, 434.1 mV, 415.0 mV, 366.3 mV, 408.3 mV, 442.6 mV, 508.2 mV and 298.5 mV, respectively. Co1.4Ni0.6O2 at x = 0.6 has the lowest onset potential and overpotential because the non-stoichiometric ratio of Co/Ni makes lattice defects of Co2−xNixO2 with x = 0.6, which provides more electroactive sites for the OER.47 In addition, the overpotential of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is compared with the OER electrocatalytic performance of non-noble electrocatalysts reported in recent years (Table 2). Table 2 illustrates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 shows better electrocatalytic ability under trace loading conditions than the other non-noble electrocatalysts which are reported.

In addition, the Tafel curves are used to further analyze the reaction kinetics of Co2−xNixO2 catalysts. Fig. 5b shows the Tafel slopes calculated by the OER LSV curves. The Tafel slopes of Co2−xNixO2 with x from 0 to 1.0, NF and RuO2 are 142.1 mV dec−1, 140.5 mV dec−1, 139.0 mV dec−1, 113.6 mV dec−1, 128.7 mV dec−1, 163.2 mV dec−1, 175.3 mV dec−1, and 64.2 mV dec−1, respectively. It can be found that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the lowest Tafel slope (Fig. 5d). This further indicates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is more advantageous in terms of OER kinetics. Fig. 5c shows the diameters of Nyquist semicircles of Co2−xNixO2 nanosheets with different x values in the electrode frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz. At the x value of 0.6, Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the smallest Nyquist semicircle (1.68 Ω). This result demonstrates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has a lower resistance and can transfer electrons faster than other materials. It is worth noting that, as for the HER, the Nyquist curve is concentrated in the high-frequency region, indicating that the OER process is controlled by the charge transfer process. The inset of Fig. 5c shows the fitting equivalent circuit. Long-term stability is another key parameter for evaluating electrocatalysts. Fig. 5e shows Co1.4Ni0.6O2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a chronopotentiometric test with 1.0 M KOH as the electrolyte environment for 30000 seconds. It can be found that the relative current can maintain about 93% of the initial value after the long-term stability measurement. In addition, Fig. 5f shows a comparison of the OER overpotential after the long-term stability test and the initial value of Co1.4Ni0.6O2. It is obvious that after the long-term stability test, the sample has an overpotential difference of only 5 mV compared to the initial value, which further illustrates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has excellent long-term stability.
We performed electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) measurements as a comparative standard of OER performance to gain a profound understanding of the reaction kinetics and mechanism of OER electrocatalysis. To estimate Cdl, the linear relationship of current density and scan rate is calculated according to the formula Δj = (ja − jc) at a potential of 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), where ja and jc are the anode and cathode current densities, respectively. All the Co2−xNixO2 with different Co/Ni molar ratios are subjected to double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements from 0 to 0.1 V under the same conditions and scan rates from 10 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1 to calculate the RHE of each sample in the non-faradaic region. Fig. 6a–e show the CV curves of Co2−xNixO2 with x from 0.2 to 1.0 in the non-faradaic region. The integral areas of the CV curves of Co2−xNixO2 are increased with increasing scan rates. Fig. 6f shows that the linear relationship of the scan rate and the Cdl for Co1.4Ni0.6O2 with an x value of 0.6 has a larger slope than the other samples. It indicates that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has a higher Cdl (1.57 mF cm−2) than other materials, such as Co1.8Ni0.2O2 (0.52 mF cm−2), Co1.6Ni0.4O2 (0.90 mF cm−2), Co1.2Ni0.8O2 (1.25 mF cm−2) and Co1.0Ni1.0O2 (0.50 mF cm−2). Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the highest ECSA, which means that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the most catalytic active sites in the OER compared with the other Co2−xNixO2 nanosheets. The catalytic active sites in the OER process result in water molecules being more easily adsorbed by the electrode material and enhancing the electron transport efficiency between the electrode surface and the electrolyte.52 Thereby, the electron transport efficiency of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 increases, and the catalytic activity of the OER is improved.

Based on the above mentioned excellent catalytic performance of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 for HER and OER, we construct an overall water splitting cell using Co1.4Ni0.6O2 as the cathode and anode in a two-electrode system. The overall water splitting is measured in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 7, the voltage of the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 overall water-splitting catalyst with a loading amount of 0.1 mg cm−2 is 1.75 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, long-term stability is measured at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It can be seen that the relative current remains above 90%, which shows that Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has excellent stability for overall water splitting. The inset of Fig. 7 shows that numerous hydrogen and oxygen bubbles form on NF in a two-electrode system.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Co2−xNixO2 nanosheets with different Co/Ni molar ratios are synthesized by a simple coprecipitation method. Co2−xNixO2 hexagonal nanosheets are used for the first time as a bifunctional electrode towards OER/HER for overall water splitting. When the x value is 0.6, Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheets have the maximum specific surface area (60.63 m2 g−1), the lowest HER overpotential (204.8 mV) and OER overpotential (366.3 mV), and excellent electrochemical stability (HER, 94%; OER, 93%); Co1.4Ni0.6O2 has the highest ECSA and catalytic activity. Obviously, the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet shows outstanding OER and HER activity at 0.1 mg cm−2 trace loading. Furthermore, the overall water splitting cell voltage of Co1.4Ni0.6O2 is 1.75 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work will lead to exciting new ways to further optimize the compositions and microstructures of Co-based oxides for better electrocatalytic overall water splitting.
