    , Accepted 12th November 2014First published on 21st November 2014AbstractA HC(NH2)2PbI3 solar cell of perovskite structure based on TiO2 nanohelices has been developed. Well-aligned helical TiO2 arrays of different pitch (p) and radius (r), helix-1 (p/2 = 118 nm, r = 42 nm), helix-2 (p/2 = 353 nm, r = 88 nm) and helix-3 (p/2 = 468 nm, r = 122 nm), were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by oblique-angle electron beam evaporation. HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite was deposited on the TiO2 nanohelices by a two-step dipping method. Helix-1 showed higher short-circuit current density (JSC), whereas helix-3 exhibited slightly higher open-circuit voltage (VOC). HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite combined with helix-1 demonstrated an average power conversion efficiency of 12.03 ± 0.07% due to its higher JSC compared to helix-2 and helix-3. The higher JSC of helix-1 could be attributed to its greater light scattering efficiency and higher absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency. In addition, despite having the longest pathway structure, helix-1 showed rapid electron diffusion, attributed to its higher charge injection efficiency due to the larger contact area between perovskite and TiO2. We have established that fine tuning of the interface between perovskite and the electron-injecting oxide is a crucial factor in achieving a perovskite solar cell of high performance.
Introduction
An initial report of organo-lead halide perovskite as a light harvester,1 following reports of a perovskite-sensitized solar cell of 6.5% efficiency2 and 10–11% long-term durable solid-state perovskite solar cells,3,4 has over recent years triggered intensive interest in perovskite solar cells. As a result, rapid improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been demonstrated by optimizing the device structure and deposition process,5–10 and a PCE as high as 19.3% has been demonstrated using a planar structure, and a PCE of 17.9% obtained from a mesoscopic structure.8,10
Along with efforts to enhance photovoltaic performance, studies aimed at the improved understanding of the origin of the superb performance of the perovskite solar cell have been carried out. Methylammonium lead iodide (MALI) was found to have the ability to accumulate charges and to transfer electrons and holes;11–13 diffusion lengths for electrons and holes were estimated to be over 1 μm.12,13 These unique properties of organometal halide perovskites have changed its diverse device structure from a sensitization concept to a planar p–n junction concept.14 Although the diffusion length of charges in perovskite are found to be much greater than its absorption depth, represented by the reciprocal of its absorption coefficient,15,16 it remains arguable whether or not an electron-accepting network for charge separation, such as mesoscopic TiO2, in the perovskite layer is necessarily required. Some studies have been conducted to gauge the effect of different n-type electron-accepting materials with various morphologies, including ZnO nanorods, ZnO nanoparticles, rutile TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 nanorods.17–20 Regardless of the materials used, it has been found that an electron acceptor in a perovskite solar cell plays an important role in improving its photovoltaic performance. Regarding charge collection, TiO2 nanorods are promising candidates, since better charge transport is expected through a 1-dimensional pathway than a 3-dimensional porous nanoparticle network. ZnO nanorods are found to be more efficient for charge collection than TiO2 nanorods, due to more rapid charge carrying.18 In addition, electron injection behavior has been found to differ with the crystal phase, in which more electrons were injected into rutile than anatase TiO2, and this consequently affected the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell.19
Recently, formamidinium-based perovskite, HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FALI), has been reported to be an acceptable alternative to the methylammonium analogue.21–26 Compared to MALI, FALI is free from phase transitions and is relatively photo-stable, and it has a wider absorption range.21,26 In addition, a mesoporous TiO2 layer embedded in the FALI layer has been found to improve charge collection and fill factor by lowering series resistance and increasing shunt resistance.26 Since charge transport and collection are influenced by oxide type and phase, as is observed in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite solar cells,18,19 we were stimulated to investigate the effect of 1-dimensional TiO2 nanorods in the FALI system. It was also of interest to examine the effect of electron transport and collection on 1-dimensional TiO2 nanorods of different pathway lengths.
We can now report the results based on the opto-electronic properties of TiO2 helix-embedded FALI perovskite solar cells. Highly aligned helical TiO2 arrays were deposited on FTO glass by oblique-angle deposition, which is a very promising method for producing aligned nanostructural films with excellent shape control.27 Arrays of 400 nm-thick helical TiO2 of differing radius, pitch and turn were used as an electron-accepting network in a FALI-perovskite solar cell. Morphological tuning of helical TiO2 resulted in an increase in charge collection and light harvesting efficiency. Using TiO2 nanohelices of 118 nm half-pitch and 42 nm radius, a PCE of 12.03% was demonstrated under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination.
Methods
Deposition of TiO2 nanohelices
FTO glass was cleaned using UV-ozone for 15 min and washed with a detergent solution. The substrates were further cleaned in an ethanol bath under sonication. A dense TiO2 blocking layer was formed by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Aldrich, 75 wt% in isopropanol) solution onto the cleaned FTO glass and annealing at 500 °C for 15 min. Arrays of 400 nm-thick helical TiO2 films of different shapes were formed on the FTO glass by an oblique-angle deposition technique using an electron-beam evaporator. With oblique-angle deposition, by adjusting the deposition conditions, such as substrate tilt angle, substrate rotation speed, time interval between substrate rotation, and deposition rate, a variety of three-dimensional nanostructures, including nanohelices, slanted nanorods, and nano zig-zags, were produced with precise control of geometrical shape. At the initial stage of the oblique-angle deposition, a TiO2 vapor flux with a high substrate tilt angle formed small islands of TiO2, producing self-shadowed regions.27–29 Limited atom diffusion into the self-shadowed regions, and preferential deposition of the TiO2 vapor flux in the non-shadowed area, created porous thin films with a variety of nanostructures, depending on the deposition conditions. Helical TiO2 nanostructures could be produced by rotating the substrate at controlled time intervals at a high substrate tilt angle.
Three samples, helix-1, helix-2 and helix-3, were produced using an identical substrate tilt angle of 80°, at a film deposition rate of 5 Å s−1 and a substrate rotational speed of 2 s, but with different time intervals between substrate rotations of 6, 12, or 24 s, respectively, in order to form TiO2 helices of different geometrical shapes. The average helical TiO2 diameter of each sample was estimated to be 66.4 ± 3.5 nm by SEM imaging. The pitch of the helical TiO2 became longer with increasing time interval, due to greater deposition along one direction of the helix. The thickness of each sample was precisely controlled using experimentally acquired tooling factors (deposited film thickness on sample/deposited film thickness on an alloy quartz crystal microbalance sensor) for each set of deposition conditions: 0.72, 0.79 and 1.02 for helix-1, helix-2 and helix-3, respectively. In order to improve the crystallinity of the helical TiO2, samples were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under ambient air conditions. Helical TiO2 films were post-treated with TiCl4 (Aldrich, >98%) by dipping in a 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 10 min, followed by heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min.
Production of FALI perovskite solar cells
HC(NH2)2I was synthesized according to the method described elsewhere.26 FALI was deposited on an FTO substrate with TiO2 nanohelices by a two-step dipping technique. 1 M PbI2 (Aldrich, 99%) in N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) solution was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 25 s. The PbI2-coated helical TiO2 film was dried at 40 °C for 3 min, followed by 10 min at 100 °C. The film was then dipped in 10 mg mL−1 HC(NH2)2I in isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) solution for 1 min. The electrode was spun at 500 rpm for 5 s, 1500 rpm for 10 s, and 3000 rpm for 20 s to ensure uniform drying, followed by heating in turn for 3 min at 40 °C and 15 min at 150 °C. The electrode was then washed with isopropanol for 15 s to remove unreacted HC(NH2)2I, and dried 5 min at 150 °C. A solution of 72.3 mg 2,2′7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene(spiro-MeOTAD) was prepared in 1 mL chlorobenzene, with 28.8 μL 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) as additives. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated on the FALI layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Gold was thermally evaporated at 1 Å s−1 and used as the positive electrode.
Characterization
Current density and voltage curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA). A 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) was used as a light source. The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with KG-2 filter. During the measurement the device was covered with a metal aperture mask of area 0.123 cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE, also known as incident photon-to-current efficiency, IPCE) was measured using a specially designed system (PV Measurement Inc., Boulder, CO). A 75 W Xenon lamp (Ushio, Japan) was used as a monochromatic light source, and EQE was measured in DC mode without bias light. Time-limited photocurrent response was monitored using a 550 nm monochromatic beam in which the beam was divided into different frequencies. Cross-sectional morphologies of the TiO2 helices were investigated using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL) and a focused ion-beam SEM (FIB-SEM, Zeiss Auriga). Time constants for electron transport were determined using the transient photocurrent measurement setup described elsewhere,30 in which a weak laser pulse at 532 nm superimposed on a relatively large bias illumination at 680 nm was used to generate the pulsed photocurrent.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows schematically the structure of the perovskite solar cell, consisting of TiO2 helices and FALI perovskite, in which three different geometrical shapes of helical TiO2, helix-1, helix-2 and helix-3, formed by an oblique-angle deposition method, were investigated. The helical structure can be defined in terms of the pitch of the helix (p), its radius (r), and the diameter of the helical cylinder (d), as illustrated in Fig. 1.

A longer time interval provided more time for the vapor flux to be deposited in one direction, resulting in a longer pitch of the helical TiO2, while the number of turns decreased for a similar film thickness. The porosity of the helix-2 thin film was estimated to be ∼63% by a linear effective medium approximation of refractive index value, measured using ellipsometry. The three types of nanohelices were grown at different time intervals between substrate rotations, but an identical substrate-tilt angle (80°). The porosity of the three types of TiO2 helices was therefore expected to be similar, since the porosity of the nanocolumns grown using oblique-angle deposition depended on the angle of incident vapor flux (substrate-tilt angle).31 Such high porosity values confirmed the presence of a high density of pores, into which the perovskite could easily penetrate during the two-step dipping procedure.32 The micro-structural evolution of helical TiO2 by thermal annealing has been described in a previous paper.33 The amorphous phase TiO2 deposited was transformed into a highly crystalline anatase phase during thermal annealing at 500 °C for 30 min, which should provide an effective pathway for electron transportation due to the probable removal of trap states.32 The average grain size along the growth axis of helix has been shown in a previous study to be 413 ± 25 nm, and was much larger than the widely used TiO2 nanoparticles (20–60 nm).33 Electrodes based on TiO2 nanohelices can therefore be expected to show better electron transport properties than those based on nanoparticles.
To ensure that the techniques and conditions for growing the helical TiO2 on a silicon wafer were applicable to a FTO substrate with haze, the helical TiO2 layers in the same batch grown, respectively, on silicon wafer and FTO glass were compared. Since a compact thin TiO2 underlayer coated on FTO was required for the perovskite solar cell, helical TiO2 was grown on the compact TiO2 layer at a thickness of 40 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 3, no significant difference either in thickness or morphology was detected, confirming that the procedure for growth of helical TiO2 was equally applicable to both silicon wafer and FTO glass.

Fig. 4 compares the photovoltaic parameters of helical TiO2-based perovskite solar cells, the parameters measured being summarized in Table 2. Compared to helix-2, helix-1 and helix-3 showed 4.9% and 3.6% higher short-circuit current density (JSC), respectively. Compared to JSC, the differences in VOC and FF were not significant, although on average helix-2 showed slightly higher VOC and FF. As a result, helix-1 had the highest PCE, mainly due to having the highest JSC. Opto-electronic properties were further investigated using helix morphology in order to understand the basis for the difference in JSC, by means of light harvesting efficiency (LHE), EQE, absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE), and the transient photocurrent response.

Optical properties are evaluated in Fig. 5 to explain the basis for the differences in JSC. LHE was calculated from the reflectance and transmittance of the films (Fig. 5(a)) by means of eqn (1):18 LHE = (1 − R) (1 − 10−A),(1)where R is the reflectance and A the absorbance of the film. As can be seen in Fig. 5(b), helix-1 showed slightly higher LHE over the wavelengths between 550 nm and 800 nm, helix-2 showed the lowest LHE, and helix-3 was intermediate. The higher LHE of helix-1 probably resulted from greater scattering, particularly at longer wavelengths, due to increased diffuse reflectance.

The surface area of helical TiO2 was calculated by designing a 3D model of a helix using the 3D MAX program, based on the parameter measurements in Table 1, in which the ratios of surface area of helix-1:helix-2:helix-3 were calculated to be 1.17:1.00:1.08. Since light scattering occurs in inhomogeneous optical media, in other words at the interface between two media of different reflective indices, it is reasonable that the interface of helical TiO2 and FALI perovskite should act as a scattering center. Thus, a helical TiO2 film of higher surface area could be expected to produce a greater increase in LHE due to higher light scattering than that of TiO2 nanohelices of low surface area.
In the EQE spectra (Fig. 5(c)), integrated values of JSC were calculated to be 19.24 mA cm−2 for helix-1, 17.09 mA cm−2 for helix-2 and 19.00 mA cm−2 for helix-3, in good agreement with the trend in the determined values of JSC shown in Table 1. The inset in Fig. 5(c) shows normalized EQE spectra. The overall tendency of the normalized EQE spectra for wavelengths ranging from 550 nm to 800 nm was well matched with the LHE results, which means that the increased JSC in helix-1 and helix-3 compared to helix-2 was partially attributable to the increase in LHE due to light scattering. APCE was calculated from LHE and EQE using eqn (2):18 APCE (%) = EQE (%)/LHE (%)(2)
Plots of APCE spectra are shown in Fig. 5(d), in which helix-1 and helix-3 were estimated to be 8% higher than that of helix-2 over the whole wavelength region, in line with eqn (3):34 APCE = φinj × φcoll,(3)in which φinj and φcoll are electron injection and collection efficiency, respectively. The low APCE is likely to be attributable either to low charge injection or low collection efficiency, or both. This indicates that charge injection and/or charge collection are probably affected by morphological differences in the TiO2 nanohelices.

Fig. 6 shows cross-sectional SEM images, together with FIB-assisted SEM images, for FALI perovskite solar cells of different helical TiO2 structures. It was difficult to distinguish helical TiO2 and the infiltrated FALI perovskite from normal SEM images. However, each component is clearly identified in the FIB-assisted SEM images (Fig. 6(d)–(f)), in which perovskite was fully integrated into ca. 400 nm thick helical TiO2 films, and a ca. 200 nm thick capping layer was additionally formed. In the vicinity of the interface between the TiO2 nanohelices and FALI, there was opportunity for electron injection from FALI to TiO2.

In Fig. 7 the time-limited photocurrent response of different helical TiO2 nanostructures is compared. With light chopped at 4 Hz and 10 Hz, helix-1 showed the most rapid photocurrent response, helix-2 gave the slowest response, and helix-3 was intermediate. This emphasized that charge collection in the perovskite solar cell with helix-2 was less efficient compared to the others. This correlated well with photovoltaic performance and APCE. With the incident light chopped at 50 Hz, the overall intensity of the photocurrent response decreased due to the limited response of electrons in TiO2,35 and certain rapidly responding components were identified (Fig. 7(c)). These components were probably due to charge transport through the perovskite layer itself, bearing in mind the much higher diffusion coefficient of electrons in perovskite (0.036 cm2 s−1) than in TiO2 (6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1).19 The amplitude of the rapidly responding components increased in the order, helix-2, helix-3 and helix-1, which is the reverse order to surface area. With a larger surface area, a higher portion of the electrons generated in perovskite are regarded as injected into the TiO2 network, a portion of electrons transported through the perovskite layer are assumed to be decreased, and vice versa.

The time constants for electron transport (τc) of the FALI perovskite solar cells incorporating different helical TiO2 structures are compared in Fig. 8. τcs was determined as 8.70 × 10−5 s for helix-1, 2.36 × 10−4 s for helix-2, and 1.39 × 10−4 s for helix-3. The corresponding diffusion coefficients were calculated as 7.83 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, 2.88 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and 4.90 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively, corresponding to the electron transport in helical TiO2. Contrary to our expectation that electron transport would be restricted by short pitch with high turns such as in helix-1, under the assumption that all the electrons were injected, electron transport was more rapid in the sequence, helix-1, helix-3, and helix-2. The difference in diffusion coefficient was probably related to the different quantity of electrons injected into TiO2. Indeed, the different magnitude of bias current density at a given light intensity was an indication of different photo-charge density in TiO2, resulting in a difference in electron diffusion coefficient.36 When considering the length of the electron pathway, helix-1 is expected to have the lowest electron diffusion coefficient. However, helix-1 had the highest electron diffusion coefficient, which means that the length of electron pathway was not the dominant factor, but that charge injection efficiency from FALI to TiO2 in fact determined the electron transport rate in this system. Therefore, the higher JSC from helix-1 may be attributed to higher charge injection efficiency, despite the longer pathway compared to the shortest pathway and lower JSC of helix-2.

Finally, we investigated the hysteresis effect of a HC(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite solar cell based on TiO2 nanohelices. As can be seen in Fig. 9, no difference in current density–voltage curves between forward (from JSC to VOC) and reverse (from VOC to JSC) scanning modes could be observed. This indicated that nanohelix-embedded HC(NH2)2PbI3 was free from hysteresis. Nanohelical TiO2 plays an important role in the suppression of hysteresis, since the capacitive charges are likely to be quickly dissipated by charge separation in the presence of nanohelices.37

Conclusions
The following conclusions may be drawn:
(1) The geometrical shape of the helical TiO2 had no significant effect on electron transport in TiO2.
(2) An increase in perovskite/TiO2 contact area by increasing the surface area of the oxide film was found to increase light harvesting and charge injection.
(3) An increase in electron injection from perovskite to TiO2 led to more rapid electron diffusion in TiO2, regardless of the pathway structure.
This indicated that the contact area between TiO2 and FALI perovskite was critical, and fine tuning of interface between perovskite and electron-injecting oxide therefore became a crucial factor in achieving a high performance perovskite solar cell.
