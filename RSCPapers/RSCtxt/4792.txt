Since the discovery of nitride clusterfullerenes (NCFs) in 1999, the family of clusterfullerenes has been significantly expanded within the past decade, with new members including carbide clusterfullerenes (CCFs), hydrocarbide clusterfullerenes (HCCFs), oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs), sulfide clusterfullerenes (SCFs), and carbonitride clusterfullerenes (CNCFs). We first present the classification of clusterfullerenes and list all the clusterfullerenes reported to date. For each type of clusterfullerenes, we review in detail their synthesis, separation, intriguing molecular structures and properties. For NCFs, as the first and most important clusterfullerenes, we point out the significance of their discovery and focus on their new synthesis and separation methods as well as the new advances. Finally the potential applications of clusterfullerenes are addressed.

1. Introduction
Endohedral fullerenes are a special type of nanostructure, having a fullerene cage encaging atoms, ions or clusters.1–10 With the first detection of LaC2n+ ions in the mass spectrum of a sample prepared by the vaporization of graphite rods impregnated with LaCl3 by Smalley et al. in 1985,1 the first stable endohedral metallofullerene, La@C82, was isolated by the same group in 1991,2 triggering the worldwide interests on the synthesis of a large variety of endohedral structures.3–10 In 1999 a brand-new structure—Sc3N@C80 as the first member of metal nitride clusterfullerenes—was discovered by Dorn et al. via introducing a small portion of nitrogen gas into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing metal oxides.11 Since the yield of Sc3N@C80 is higher than that of all other endohedral fullerenes, such a finding initiated the new era of endohedral fullerene research, and nowadays clusterfullerenes represent a novel branch of endohedral fullerenes, which are characterized by a robust fullerene cage with metal clusters encaged in its hollow.3–10
During the past decade the family of endohedral fullerenes was significantly enlarged by the clusterfullerenes, especially nitride clusterfullerenes, and the new carbon cages including non-IPR (IPR = isolated pentagon rule) structures.12 In particular, upon extending the number of encaged metal ions within endohedral fullerenes, the supposed multimetallofullerenes (Mx@C2n) turn out to be metal carbide clusterfullerenes (MxC2@C2n−2) instead. The existence of a C2 moiety in an endohedral fullerene was first detected in 2001 for Sc2C2@C84 as demonstrated by a NMR study, which had been assumed to be the dimetallofullerene “Sc2@C86”.13 Later on, several more types of endohedral clusterfullerenes were also discovered, including metal hydrocarbon clusterfullerene (Sc3CH@C80),14 metal oxide clusterfullerenes (e.g., Sc4O2@C80),15 metal sulfide clusterfullerenes (e.g., Sc2S@C82)16 and metal carbonitride clusterfullerenes (Sc3CN@C80)17etc. Thus, clusterfullerenes is becoming a fast-growing family of endohedral fullerenes.
One of the most characteristic features of endohedral fullerenes is the charge transfer from the encaged species to the fullerene cage, which brings about many new properties inaccessible by the empty fullerenes.3–10 Therefore, to understand the peculiar electronic properties of the endohedral fullerenes in comparison to the empty fullerenes, it is crucial to unveil the nature of such a charge transfer. For the conventional metallofullerenes with metal ion(s) encaged, a three-electron transfer is typically adopted for the metallofullerenes based on most group IIIB metals, like the first isolated metallofullerene La@C82, whereas for the metallofullerenes based on several other group IIIB metals including Sc, Eu, Tm, Yb and group IIA metals such as Mg, Ca, a two-electron transfer is preferred.3,4 However, for the case of clusterfullerenes, a more complex situation on the charge transfer occurs because the encaged metal cluster comprises both metal and non-metal atoms, both of which are involved in the overall charge transfer to the outer fullerene cage.5–10 For instance, Sc3N@C80 nitride clusterfullerenes can be formally viewed as a positively charged planar Sc3N cluster inside a negatively charged icosahedral carbon cage ([Sc3N]6+@C806−), i.e., there are six electrons transferred from the encaged Sc3N cluster to the outer C80 cage.5–10 Therefore, for clusterfullerenes the complex charge transfer between the encaged cluster and fullerene cage is important for understanding their intriguing stability and properties.
In this feature article, first we present a classification of clusterfullerenes reported to date, including nitride clusterfullerenes, carbide clusterfullerenes, hydrocarbide clusterfullerenes, oxide clusterfullerenes, sulfide clusterfullerenes and carbonitride clusterfullerenes. We then review each type of clusterfullerenes individually, including the synthesis, isolation, intriguing molecular structures and properties. The significance of the discovery of nitride clusterfullerenes is emphasized. Finally the potential applications of clusterfullerenes are addressed as well.

3. Metal nitride clusterfullerenes (NCFs)
In 1999, Dorn et al. discovered Sc3N@C80 by introducing a small portion of nitrogen gas into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing metal oxides,11 which turns out to be the most abundant member among all NCFs reported to date with the yield bing higher than that of all other endohedral fullerenes. In 2007 Dunsch and Yang published two general reviews in the field of NCFs, accounting the synthesis, separation, molecular and electronic structures of NCFs in details.5,6 In the following we first give a brief overview on the aforementioned issues of NCFs, then we focus on the new advances since 2007.
3.1 
          Synthesis methods of NCFs before 2007
The milestone synthesis method of fullerenes was DC arc discharge method, which was first developed by Krätschmer and Huffman in 1990 by resistive heating of graphite rods in a helium atmosphere, enabling the macroscopic amounts of fullerene materials available.81 All of the synthesis methods of NCFs are based on the modification of the Krätschmer–Huffman method, by introducing versatile nitrogen sources during the discharging (Scheme 1). According to the form of nitrogen sources introduced, the synthesis methods of NCFs reported before 2007 can be classified into two types:
 Scheme 1  Schematic summary of different methods for the synthesis of NCFs by using different nitrogen sources including compounds 1–586 (copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA; reproduced with permission). 

3.1.1 The gaseous nitrogen sources. 
(1) “Trimetallic nitride template” (TNT) process. 
During the course of the discovery of the first NCF Sc3N@C80 in 1999, Dorn et al. introduced a small portion of nitrogen gas into the Krätschmer–Huffman generator during vaporization of graphite rods containing metal oxides, and named this method as the “trimetallic nitride template” (TNT) process.11 Interestingly, the yield of Sc3N@C80 is higher than that of all other endohedral fullerenes and empty fullerene C84 as well. Based on this TNT method, the following nitride clusterfullerenes have been synthesized despite of the relatively low selectivity of NCFs: such as Sc3N@C2n (2n = 68,20 7823), M3N@C80 (M = Y,34Lu,40,41Er,11Tb36), Gd3N@C2n (2n = 80, 84, 88),24,35Tm3N@C80,28Tb3N@C2n (2n = 84, 86, 88).32,42 More recently a new type of azafullerene M2@C79N (M = Y, Tb) was also synthesized by this method by Dorn et al.82
Notably, by mixing Er2O3 and Sc2O3 as the raw materials, Dorn et al. detected Er2ScN@C80 and ErSc2N@C80 by mass spectrometry, in addition to the expected Er3N@C80 and Sc3N@C80 NCFs. According to the mass spectral data analysis, they concluded that the yield of Er2ScN@C80 and ErSc2N@C80 was 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than Sc3@C82. Moreover, the yield of ErSc2N@C80 was even higher than that of the most abundant homogeneous NCF Sc3N@C80.11 For this reason the mixed metal nitride clusterfullerenes (MMNCFs), which are NCFs with two or three different metals mixed in the encaged nitride, have been attracting the great interest of the fullerene community in recent years.10 So far the reported MMNCFs include MxSc3−xN@C68 (x = 0–2, M = Tm, Er, Gd, Ho, La),20MxSc3−xN@C80 (M = Y,21Ce,52 Nd,51Gd,50,53,54Tb,54Dy,49Er,11,21Lu51), ScYErN@C80,21YxEr3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2),21DySc2N@C76,49Lu2ScN@C68,48MSc2N@C68 (M = Dy, Lu),48LuxY3−xN@C80,57TiSc2N@C8056 and Lu2CeN@C80.58
(2) The “reactive gas atmosphere” route. 
Usually, the yield of endohedral metallofullerenes prepared by DC-arc discharge method is less than 2% of all the synthesized fullerenes, and the yield of Sc3N@C80 prepared by TNT process was about 3–5%.11 In 2003 Dunsch et al. developed the “reactive gas atmosphere” route by introducing NH3 as the reactive gas to the helium cooling gas and for the first time produced NCFs as the dominant products in the soot with the relative yield of the empty fullerene and conventional metallofullerenes being less than 5%.83
Based on this synthesis method, many new NCFs was synthesized and isolated including some MMNCFs, such as the first non-IPR C70 cage-based Sc3N@C70,22GdxSc3−xN@C80 (I, II; x = 0–2),50,53DySc2N@C76,49Nd3N@C2n (40 ≤ n ≤ 49),18,19La3N@C2n (43 ≤ n ≤ 55),46,47M3N@C2n (M = Nd, Pr, Ce; n = 40–53),18 LuxSc3−xN@C68 (I, II; x = 1, 2),48MSc2N@C80 (M = Dy, Lu),48 NdxSc3−xN@C80,51 LuxY3−xN@C80 (x = 1, 2),57 and Lu2CeN@C80.58


3.1.2 The solid nitrogen sources. 
In a first stage of modifying the synthesis of NCFs, a solid nitrogen-containing inorganic compound, calciumcyanamide (CaNCN) which was added to the graphite mixture in the same extent as the metal content, was applied by Dunsch et al. in 2004.39 With this “inorganic solid nitrogen” method, they succeeded in selectively synthesizing Sc3N@C80 with a selectivity ranging from 3 to 42%. However, the disadvantage of this “inorganic solid nitrogen” route was the low reproducibility of the fullerene yield, and this might be due to traces of water and/or hydrocarbons in the raw material.39 As a result this “inorganic solid nitrogen” route was not widely applied in the synthesis of other NCFs.
As a modification of TNT process, in 2007 Stevenson et al. used gaseous N2 from air as the nitrogen source and Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O as an additive, realizing the selective synthesis of Sc3N@C80 NCF. This method was named as “Chemically Adjusting Plasma Temperature, Energy, and Reactivity” (CAPTEAR).84 The CAPTEAR concept is based on the hypothesis that different types of carbonaceous nanomaterials (e.g., nanotubes, empty-cage fullerenes, NCFs) have preferred temperatures of formation and stability in a given chemically reactive plasma.84 The CAPTEAR process with Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O uses an exothermic nitrate moiety to suppress empty-cage fullerene formation, whereas Cu functions as a catalyst additive to offset the reactive plasma environment and boost the Sc3N@C80 NCF production. In this method, the introduction of copper nitrate hydrate forms NOx vapor generating solid reagents, air and combustion, and in this way the temperature, energy and reactivity of the plasma environment could be tuned. With the extent of temperature, energy and reactive environment stoichiometrically varied, the optimal conditions for selective nitride clusterfullerene synthesis have been achieved.84 Their results indicate that the percentages of C60 and Sc3N@C80 are inversely related, whereas the percentages of C70 and higher empty-cage C2nfullerenes are largely unaffected.
Using the CAPTEAR method, more recently the same group isolated a metallic nitride azafullerene La3N@C79N, which even dominates the product distribution with the yield above that of La3N@C96.85

3.2 New synthesis methods of NCFs
In 2010 Yang et al. developed a new “selective organic solid (SOS)” route for the facile synthesis of NCFs, by using two different guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate and guanidinium hydrochloride) as the new nitrogen sources (see Scheme 1).86 Using the SOS route, NCFs based on a variety of metals (Dy, Sc, Y, Gd, Lu, and mixed metals Sc/Dy, Sc/Gd, Sc/Lu and Lu/Ce) were synthesized. For several representative metals such as Sc, Y, Gd, Dy and Sc/Dy, they quantitatively compared the yield of M3N@C80 synthesized by the SOS route using guanidinium thiocyanate with the reported “reactive gas atmosphere” route, indicating that the yield of M3N@C80 by using guanidinium thiocyanate could be comparable to that obtained by the “reactive gas atmosphere” route. Therefore they claimed that the SOS route was a general route for the synthesis of NCFs that promises both high selectivity of NCFs and high reproducibility of the fullerene yield. Another advantage of the SOS route compared to the reported TNT process and the “reactive gas atmosphere” route is that no additional heating pretreatment is needed, thus simplifying the procedure and being much more facile.
Yang et al. summarized the different methods for the synthesis of NCFs by using different nitrogen sources including several nitrogen-containing organic solid compounds (Scheme 1).86
More recently, urea (CO(NH2)2) was used successfully as the new nitrogen source by Yang et al. for the first time to synthesize Sc-based NCFs Sc3N@C2n.87 The yield of Sc3N@C80 (Ih + D5h) per gram Sc2O3 by using CO(NH2)2 as the new nitrogen source is quantitatively compared to that by using the reported nitrogen sources, including N2, NH3 and guanidinium thiocyanate, indicating that the yield of Sc3N@C80 (Ih + D5h) per gram Sc2O3 by using CO(NH2)2 is almost identical to that by using N2, but much higher than that by using NH3. Compared to the reported solid nitrogen source guanidinium thiocyanate, the yield of Sc3N@C80 (Ih + D5h) per gram Sc2O3 synthesized by using CO(NH2)2 is around 1.6 times higher, while CO(NH2)2 is ca. 8.5 times cheaper than guanidinium thiocyanate.87
3.3 Separation of NCFs
The detailed separation techniques for NCFs before 2007 have been summarized in the two general reviews by Dunsch and Yang.5,6 Briefly, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been demonstrated to be one of the most powerful and frequently used techniques for separation of NCFs, which allows a separation of fullerenes according to their molecular weight, size, shape or other properties. By applying multi-step or recycling based on different modified HPLC columns, many kinds of NCFs including MMNCFs have been separated successfully.
Separation of NCFs by chemical methods appears very important for the large-scale separation as the non-chromatographic method. Echegoyen et al. first reported in 2005 a simple separation of two isomers of Sc3N@C80 ((I, Ih) and (II, D5h)) by the electrochemical method, indicating a 270 mV differences in the first electrochemical oxidation potentials of the two isomers.88
Based on selective chemical reactivity, in 2005 Dorn et al. reported Diels–Alder reactions with a reactive resin (cyclopentadiene-functionalized styrene-divinylbenzen resin), which provided a single-step separation of a series of NCFs (A3N@C80 (A = Er, Gd, Ho, Lu, Sc, Tb, Tm, Y) from the as-prepared fullerene soot.89 This chemical method takes advantage of the extraordinary kinetic chemical stability of NCFs with respect to the other fullerenes.
In 2006 Stevenson et al. proposed another chemical method as the “stir and filter approach” (SAFA). Without using any chromatography equipment, they used cyclopentadienyl- and amino-functionalized silica to selectively bind contaminant fullerenes (empty fullerenes and non-NCFs) and claimed to obtain purified NCFs under optimum conditions.90 Later on the same group further compared the reactivity of the D5h isomer of Sc3N@C80 relative to the Ih Sc3N@C80 isomer towards a reactive diamino silica used in the “SAFA” method.91 It was found that the reactivity of C70, C60 and Sc3N@C80 (D5h) > Sc3N@C80 (Ih). Accordingly, this significant difference on the reactivity could be used as a rapid, nonoxidative, nonchromatographic method for the rapid removal of the Sc3N@C80 (D5h) isomer from the Sc3N@C80 (Ih).
More recently Stevenson et al. reported that NCFs and metal oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs) reacted rapidly with an array of Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and FeCl3.92 Following the reactivity order of Sc4O2@Ih-C80 > Sc3N@C78 > Sc3N@C68 > Sc3N@D5h-C80 > Sc3N@Ih-C80 towards AlCl3, they first enriched Sc4O2@C80 (Ih) and Sc3N@C80 (D5h), then Sc3N@Ih-C80 was enriched successfully by using FeCl3 (Scheme 2), whereas empty cage fullerenes C60 and C70 were largely unreactive under the conditions used in their study.92

3.4 Molecular structures of NCFs
In general, there are mainly three methods for structural determination of NCFs, including X-ray crystallography study, 13C NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT quantum-mechanical calculations.5,6 The major important issues in the study of the molecular structures of NCFs include the structure of the outer fullerene cage, the interior cluster and the cluster-cage interaction.5,6 While the structures of the outer fullerene cage and the interior cluster can be unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallography, 13C NMR spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT quantum-mechanical calculations could be also used to elucidate the cage structures of NCFs. Of particular importance is the cluster-cage interaction, which can be probed by Raman spectroscopy, because it determines the stability of the NCF molecule. Specifically, for Sc3N@C80 as the first and most abundant member of NCFs,11 the C80 cage embraces a Sc3N cluster which is not stable as a single molecule. On the other hand the C80 cage has an isomeric form (Ih) which has not been isolated as an empty cage so far. The icosahedral C80 cage is stabilized by the electron transfer from the Sc3N cluster. Therefore, the Sc3N cluster structure and the C80-Ih cage appear to be stabilized by each other.5,6
The detailed discussion on the molecular structures of NCFs has been summarized in the two general reviews by Dunsch and Yang as well as the more recent review by Echegoyen et al.5,6,9 In the following we focus on the discussions on the novel structures of NCFs since 2007.

3.4.1 Dependence of the yield and cage size distribution of NCF on the size of the encaged nitride cluster. 
The earlier studies on a series of M3N@C2n NCFs based on lanthanides with relatively small ionic radii (M = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Lu) reveal a wide distribution of cage sizes ranging from cages C68 to C98.26,28,38 However, as the size of the encaged metal nitride cluster increases, the yield of the NCFs decreases drastically, as in the case of the Gd3N@C2n (40 ≤ n ≤ 44) NCFs.24 Even though the yield of these NCFs depends on the size of the encaged nitride clusters, they all show the common characteristic of the preferential templating of C80 cages.
When the encaged metal nitride cluster is as large as Nd3N, Echegoyen et al. revealed that the cluster Nd3N preferred to be encapsulated in the small-band-gap C88 cage instead of C80 cage (Fig. 1). Thus, a preferential templating of a C88 cage is realized by the Nd3N cluster. Interestingly, they found that the transition between the predominance of the C80 cage observed for Gd3N and the predominance of the C88 cage observed with Nd3N came even with an increase in the yield of production.19 Moreover, for Pr3N and Ce3N clusters, Echegoyen et al. further demonstrated the preferential templating of the C88 cage. Besides, a progressive and significant increase in the yield of the M3N@C96 NCFs was also observed, suggesting the preferential templating of a larger C96 cage is approached.18 Finally, by synthesizing La3N@C2n (43 ≤ n ≤ 55) encapsulating the largest metal nitride cluster to date, the same group revealed that La3N was preferentially encapsulated inside the large C96 cage.47 Notably, these preferentially template cages (C80, C88, C96) seem to increase in size by eight carbon atoms as the size of the encaged nitride cluster increases. Although such a discrete increase has not been understood yet, these results demonstrate clearly the strong dependence of the cage-size distribution of NCF on the size of the encaged nitride cluster.

3.4.2 NCFs encapsulating non-group III metal nitride. 
Despite of the extensive studies on NCFs, notably the encaged metals for all of NCFs reported before 2009 were limited to group-IIIB (Sc, Y, and lanthanide) metals.5,6 This significantly confines the availability of metals for encapsulation within NCFs and consequently limits the members of NCFs compared to the conventional endohedral metallofullerenes.3–10 In 2009 Yang et al. successfully synthesized and isolated the first Ti-containing NCF—TiSc2N@C80 (Ih) (Fig. 2), demonstrating the possibility of encaging Ti into the C80-Ihfullerene cage in the form other than the reported metal carbide and dimetal.56 By studying the role of the Ti atom in TiSc2N@C80, Popov et al. found that the redox property of TiSc2N@C80 differed markedly from those of homogenous M3N@C80 NCFs in giving reversible one-electron transfers even on the cathodic scale. The unpaired electron spin in TiSc2N@C80 was found to be preferably fixed at the Ti ion as shown by low-temperature ESR measurements and confirmed by DFT calculations.93 As the first successful encapsulation of a non-group-IIIB metal into NCFs, the significance of this study is that it may stimulate the search of other metals to be encapsulated within cages of NCFs, enlarging the versatility of NCFs.

More recently, Yang et al. further isolated a new Ti-containing non-scandium MMNCF, TiY2N@C80,94 suggesting that the encapsulation of Ti into NCFs appears to be a general route for the synthesis of novel MMNCFs.


3.4.3 The non-IPR NCFs. 
The isolated pentagon rule (IPR) has been widely accepted as a general rule for determining the stability of all-carbon fullerene cages and fullerenes that violate the IPR (non-IPR fullerenes) have been deemed too reactive to be synthesized. The stabilization of non-IPR NCFs depends on charge transfer from the encapsulated metal clusters to fullerene cages, the electronic properties of empty carbon cages, the matching size and geometries of fullerene and encaged clusters, as well as the strong coordination of the metal ions to the fused pentagons.95 In 2000, at nearly the same time, Shinohara et al. and Dorn et al. reported independently two non-IPR endohedral fullerene Sc2@C66 and Sc3N@C68, respectively,20,96 for the latter the corresponding MMNCFs such as AxSc3−xN@C68 (x = 0–2; A = Tm, Er, Gd, Ho, La) were also reported simultaneously.20 The 13C NMR spectroscopic study of Sc3N@C68 suggested a cage symmetry of D3, which was later confirmed by X-ray crystallography study (isomer 6140).20 By 2007 only very limited numbers of non-IPR NCFs were reported, including Sc3N@C70 (C2v:7854),22Tm3N@C78 and Dy3N@C78 (II) (both have C78:C2 (22010) cages),27 and Tb3N@C84 (Cs: 51365).42
The first C76-based NCF was isolated for DySc2N@C76 by Yang et al. in 2007, exhibiting a non-IPR C76 (Cs: 17490-I) cage with two pairs of the adjacent pentagons. Interestingly, as the asymmetric DySc2N cluster has a more suitable geometry for the inner space of the C76 cage compared to the homogeneous clusters such as Sc3N or Dy3N, the highest yield for C76-based clusterfullerenes with the DyxSc3−xN mixed nitride cluster is achieved for the DySc2N@C76.49 Thus, DySc2N@C76 provides the first example of stabilization of the non-IPR C76 cage by encapsulation of an asymmetric DySc2N mixed cluster, revealing the role of the cluster structure on the stability of the fullerene cage.
In 2008 Echegoyen et al. isolated a non-IPR C82-based NCF Gd3N@C82 (Cs: 39663) having only one pair of the adjacent pentagons as confirmed by X-ray crystallography study.97 Later on the same group isolated Gd3N@C78 (C2: 22010) with two pairs of the adjacent pentagons, which represents a rare example of encapsulating large metal ions in a relatively small fullerene cage. In Gd3N@C78, it was found that two of the Gd atoms of the planar Gd3N unit were located within the pentalene folds formed by the adjacent pentagons, whereas the third Gd atom resided at the center of a hexagonal face of the C78 cage.25
With the further isolation of two non-IPR NCFs, Gd3N@C84 and Tm3N@C84,98 both of which have C84 (Cs: 51365) cages, C84 appears to be the largest cage reported so far which can adopt the non-IPR structure. (Fig. 3)

3.5 Properties of NCFs
The detailed discussion on the properties of NCFs has been summarized in the two general reviews by Dunsch and Yang as well as the two reviews by Echegoyen et al., including the electronic properties studied by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and electrochemistry, magnetic and other physical properties, chemical properties etc.5,6,8,9
4. Metal carbide clusterfullerenes (CCFs)
The existence of a C2 moiety in an endohedral fullerene, the so-called metal carbide clusterfullerene (CCF), was first detected in 2001 for Sc2C2@C84 by Shinohara et al., which had been assumed to be the dimetallofullerene “Sc2@C86”.13 The (Sc2C2)@C84 contains a Sc2C2 carbide cluster encaged in a D2d-C84 cage as confirmed by 13C NMR and synchrotron X-ray structural studies (Fig. 4a).13

4.1 Synthesis of CCFs
Up to now, the synthesis of CCFs is mainly based on the conventional Krätschmer–Huffman DC-arc discharge method. The as-produced soot is typically collected under anaerobic conditions to avoid unnecessary degradation of the CCFs produced during the soot collection and handling. The prepared soot was then extracted with good solvents such as carbon disulfide. So far, a wealth of CCFs were synthesized and isolated, including Sc2C2@C84,13Y2C2@C82 (I, II, III),69,70Sc3C2@C80,65,66Ti2C2@C78,60–62Sc2C2@C82,74Sc2C2@C68,59Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III),71Gd2C2@C92 (Fig. 4b),77Sc4C2@C80,67Lu3C2@C88,45Sc2C2@C8064 and mixed metal carbide clusterfullerene ErYC2@C82.72 This growing family represents a type of the novel and intriguing endohedral fullerenes competitive to the conventional multimetallofullerenes.
Among the multimetallofullerenes the “Sc3@C82” structure was a very important one as the three metal ions were shown by ESR spectroscopy to be completely equivalent in the position and redox state of each scandium ions.99 Furthermore the position of the scandium ions inside the cage can be changed at lower temperatures as detected by ESR spectroscopy.100 As the equivalence of the three scandium ions inside the cage seemed to point to a balanced ordering of them, it was therefore very surprising that in 2005 a carbide endohedral fullerene was proposed by the group of Akasaka.65 By NMR spectroscopy the authors showed that a Sc3C2@C80 fullerene might exist with an icosahedral cage symmetry (Fig. 4c). In this way the existence of a five atomic cluster in an endohedral fullerene has been proved. Moreover, a higher trimetallic carbide clusterfullerene Lu3C2@C88 was recently reported by Wang et al., exhibiting a planar trimetallic carbide cluster Lu3C2 encapsulated in a D2-symmetric C88 cage. DFT theoretical studies revealed that, although for both Lu3C2@C88 and Lu3N@C88 the internal moieties supply the C88 cage with six electrons cases, Lu3C2@C88 owns an unpaired electron localized on the internal [Lu3C2]6+ moiety while Lu3N@C88 has a closed-shell electronic structure. Such different molecular electronic structures of Lu3C2@C88 and Lu3N@C88 lead to the distinct differences on their UV-vis absorption spectral features as well as electrochemical redox properties.45
More recently, Wang et al. reported the separation and characterization of Sc4C2@C80, the first endohedral fullerene that exhibits a Russian-doll nesting structure according to the FTIR and Raman spectroscopic study in combination with DFT calculations (Fig. 4d).67 An unprecedented electronic configuration of [C2]6−@[Sc3+]4@[C80-Ih]6− was proposed based on the DFT computations. Thus the question arises how large a cluster inside a fullerene cage can be and whether it is a matter of size or a matter of chemical structure which determines the existence of a cluster inside the fullerene cage.
It should be noted that recently another method used a plasma coupled radio frequency furnace for the synthesis of Sc4C2@C80 CCF as achieved by Krokos.101 In their method, a cylindrical carbon body is inductively heated while surrounded by pyrolytic boronitride (PBN) which acts as insulation. The foreign element is located at the basis of the carbon cylinder where the temperature is appropriate for its evaporation.101
4.2 Separation of CCFs
Up to now, the separation of CCFs is mainly achieved by multi-step HPLC with the application of several commercially available HPLC columns (PBB, Buckyprep, Buckyprep-M, Buckyclutcher etc.) in each step.3–10 For instance, Wang et al. separated Sc4C2@C80 by two-step HPLC using Buckyprep and Buckyprep-M columns in the first and second step, respectively, which were repeated several times to obtain purified sample.67
4.3 Molecular structure of CCFs

4.3.1 Cage structure determination of CCFs. 
Since MxC2@C2n CCFs have the same molecular formulae with those of Mx@C2n+2, their carbide nature should be carefully differentiated from the conventional metallofullerenes. Therefore, determination of the cage structure is essential for the CCFs.

NMR spectroscopy
            . 
Following the success by Shinohara et al.13 of using NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the cage structure as well as the carbide nature of the first CCF Sc2C2@C84, NMR spectroscopy is nowadays the most widely used method for the structure elucidation of CCFs. Including the first member of CCFs—Sc2C2@C84 (D2d) was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy alongside the synchrotron X-ray structural analysis. The 125 MHz 13C NMR spectrum of Sc2C2@C84 exhibits a series of ten distinct lines of nearly equal intensity, one line with half the intensity, and an additional line with 1/4 the intensity (Fig. 5(I)). This spectral feature is not accessible for any of the 19 IPR isomer of C86, therefore the authors precluded the assumed “Sc2@C86” structure and concluded the carbide nature of Sc2C2@C84 having a D2d-C84 cage with a C2 moiety inside as carbide,13 which was confirmed further by the synchrotron X-ray structural analysis.

KGaA; reproduced with permission). (II) (top) Experimental (CS2, 150 MHz) and (bottom) simulated 13C NMR spectra of the C80-Ih cage in Sc4C2@C80-Ih67 (reproduced with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
In a similar way, the structure of Sc2C2@C68—the only non-IPR CCF reported so far—was also well established by 13C NMR spectroscopy by Wang et al., revealing 21 lines resulting from the C2v-C68 cage strcucture.59 The cage structures of most of other reported CCFs are also determined by 13C NMR, including three isomers of Y2C2@C82 (Cs, C2v, C3v),69,70Sc2C2@C82 (C3v)74 and Sc4C2@C80 (Ih).67

IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT calculations. 

IR spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the structural analysis of fullerenes because of its high structural sensitivity and a higher time resolution compared to NMR spectroscopy. Supplemented by DFT calculations, IR spectroscopy can be used for the structural elucidation of endohedral fullerenes, as extensively validated for NCFs. For CCFs, however, there are few reports on this method. One successful example is the determination of the Ih-C80 cage structure of Sc4C2@C80 by IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT calculations.67
Of note, DFT calculations is a useful tool for predicting the molecular structures of CCFs. In particular, Sc4C2@C80 was predicted by DFT calculations before it was experimentally isolated and characterized.104,105 A few other CCFs were also suggested by DFT calculations such as Ti2C2@C7860,61 and M2C2@C78 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf).106

X-Ray crystallography study. 

X-Ray crystallography has been used for the unambiguous structure determination of CCFs in two reports.65,77 The carbide nature and cage structure of isomer I of Gd2C2@C92 was revealed by Liu and Balch et al. based on the X-ray crystallography study.77Fig. 4b shows the structure of the endohedral fullerene. The structural results indicated that Gd2C94 contains a Gd2C2 unit inside a cage of C92 (D3: 85). Interestingly, another isomer of Gd2C2@C92 which was eluted more slowly, was proposed to be a conventional metallofullerene Gd2@C2(121)-C94 based on the computations.77
Another example for the X-ray crystallography study of CCFs is the structure determination of Sc3C2@C80 (Fig. 4c) accomplished by Akasaka et al., who first prepared the single crystal of the cycloadduct Sc3C2@C80(Ad) obtained by chemical functionalization of the Sc3C2@C80 molecule by adamantylidene carbene.65 Combining the X-ray crystallography analysis and the 13C NMR spectroscopic study of the adduct, they discovered that the Sc3C2 unit was encaged in an Ih-C80, confirming the Sc3C2@C80 CCF structure instead of the assumed “Sc3@C82”.65

Synchrotron X-ray structural analysis. 

Synchrotron X-ray structural analysis is another method used in the structure elucidation of CCFs in earlier studies. In this method, the experiment data from the synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was analysed in an iterative way combining Rietveld analysis and maximum entropy method (MEM).3 Together with the first CCF Sc2C2@C84 (D2d),13 the structure elucidations for such CCFs as M2C2@C82 (III) (M = Sc, Y)102,103 and Sc3C2@C8066 were achieved by this method. However, it should be noted, its reliability depends strongly on the structure model chosen in the Rietveld analysis, and therefore should be carefully checked. As an example, the structure of Sc3C2@C80, which was originally proposed to be “Sc3@C82” based on the early synchrotron X-ray structural analysis, was later corrected by third-generation synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction.66


4.3.2 Structure of the carbide cluster and cluster–cage interaction. 
Structures of the encaged carbide cluster and cluster–cage interactions are important issues of the structures of CCFs and the latter determines the stability of the CCF molecule. For Sc2C2@C84 (D2d), the observation of a single 13C NMR line due to a sp-hybridized carbon atom (δ = 92) for Sc2C2 (see Fig. 5) suggests that the Sc2C2 cluster is in a rapid rocking motion along the Sc–Sc axis between two mutually orthogonal molecules.13 Akasaka et al. first detected the 13C NMR signal of the C2 unit in Sc2C2@C82 (C3v), Sc2C2@C84 (D2d) and [Sc3C2@C80(Ih)]− by using 13C-enriched samples and successfully assigned all 13C NMR chemical shifts of the cage carbon atoms for the three CCFs through 2D INADEQUATE (incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer experiment) NMR measurements.75 Besides, the structures of Sc3C2 and Gd2C2 clusters within Sc3C2@C80(Ad) and Gd2C2@D3(85)-C92, respectively, were clearly established by X-ray crystallography study as discussed above.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to reveal the geometric structure of clusterfullerenes, specifically the cluster–cage interaction, on the basis of the low-energy vibrational pattern, which is directly correlated to the bond formation between the cluster and outer fullerene cage.3,5,6,8,9,24,34,37,107 Hulman et al. observed the quantized rotational states of a diatomic C2 unit in solid C2Sc2@C84 CCF as identified in the low-energy Raman spectra. They described such a phenomena as a planar C2 rotor in a solid consisting of Sc2C84 molecules, a quantum gyroscope with a cardanic suspension.108 Wang et al. found that the low-energy Raman spectrum of Sc4C2@C80-Ih showed a resemblance to that of Sc3N@C80-Ih, confirming their assignment of the Ih symmetry of Sc4C2@C80.67 In a more recent study, the same group revealed that the low-energy Raman spectra of Lu3C2@C88 exhibited a group of Raman vibrations in the tangential cage mode region between 1000 and 1600 cm−1 which were almost identical to that of Lu3N@C88 (D2).45 Accordingly they proposed that Lu3C90 and Lu3N@C88 share the same C88 (D2) cage and claimed the carbide structure of Lu3C2@C88.45

4.4 Properties of CCFs

4.4.1 Electronic properties. 
It is well known that the electronic absorptions of fullerenes are predominantly due to π–π* carbon cage transitions and depend on the structure and charge state of the carbon cage.3–10 The optical bandgap is estimated by the onset of the electronic absorption spectrum. Shinohara et al. compared the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of three isomers of Er2C2@C82 with those of Er2@C82, as shown in Fig. 6.71 The absorption of Er2@C82 (I, II, III) are similar to those of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III), respectively, suggesting that they have the same C82 symmetries. However, slight peak shifts are observed for the corresponding absorption bands in Er2@C82 and Er2C2@C82, similar to those observed for Y2@C82 (III) and Y2C2@C82 (III). These shifts were ascribed to the difference in the amount of negative charge on the C82 cage. The onsets of the spectra of Er2C2@C82 are also shifted compared with those of Er2@C82, suggesting that the HOMO–LUMO gaps for Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) are larger than those of Er2@C82 (I, II, III). The authors proposed that the encapsulation of the C2 moiety may induce the stabilization of Er2C2@C82.71

On the basis of the reported isomeric structure of three isomers of Y2C2@C82 (Cs, C2v, C3v) by 13C NMR spectroscopy and considering the fact that the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of fullerenes and endohedral fullerenes can reflect sensitively their size and symmetry, Shinohara et al. determined the cage symmetries of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) to be Cs, C2v and C3v, respectively.71
The photoluminescence (PL) study of Er2C2@C82 (I, II, III) and Er2@C82 (I, II, III) by Shinohara et al. revealed that a dierbium CCF Er2C2@C82 (III) exhibited an enhanced PL from the encapsulated Er3+ at 1520 nm compared with other dierbium metallofullerenes Er2@C82 (I, II, III). These results can be interpreted that the widening of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the C82 cage when C2 is inserted between the two Er3+ results in the reduction of absorbance at ca. 1520 nm of the C82 cage.71

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is a powerful tool used to determine the electronic structure of fullerenes, and is helpful in estimating the cage structure of fullerenes.3,5,6,109 Previous studies reveal that the cage structure for monometal atom encapsulated metallofullerenes is principally responsible for the electronic structure, and as a result, metallofullerenes of the same cage symmetry with an incorporated metal atom of the same oxidation state give essentially the same UPS. Hino et al. studied the UPS of Ti2C2@C78 in comparison with that of La2@C78.109 The UPS of both Ti2C2@C78 and La2@C78 suggests that both have the same C78 (D3h:5) cage structure and that “Ti2C80” is actually Ti2C2@C78. Nevertheless, the UPS of Ti2C2@C78 differs significantly from that of La2@C78 despite their same cage structure. This is interpreted that the encapsulation of different species (Ti2C2 carbide or La2 dimetals) to the same C78 (D3h:5) cage brought about completely different electronic structures. To understand such a difference, the authors proposed that hybridization of wave functions between Ti atoms and the encaged C atoms distorted the electronic structure of the C78 considerably, and bonds may form between the Ti atoms and the encaged C atoms due to this distortion. Since Ti atoms have a high carbide-forming tendency, hybridization or bond formation between encapsulated Ti and C atoms has been induced.109
Poblet et al. analyzed theoretically the electronic structure of Sc2C2@C82,110 which is the most abundant CCF known so far, and proposed that the ionic model based on the formal transfer of four electrons from the encapsulated M2C2 carbide to the carbon cage was valid for the M2C2@C82 CCFs. They observed that the internal metal–carbide cluster is able to rotate inside the C82 cage. Furthermore, the higher stability of the C3v: 8 isomer of M2C2@C82 than other IPR C82 isomers was also explained by considering that its largest (LUMO-3)–(LUMO-2) gap facilitates the encapsulating of the M2C2 moiety because of the stabilization obtained by the formal transfer of four electrons from the cluster to the C82 cage.110


4.4.2 Electrochemical properties. 
The electrochemical characterization of endohedral clusterfullerenes provides a direct insight into their electronic structures including the interaction between the encaged clusters and the outer carbon cages.3–10 The first study on the redox properties of CCFs was reported for (Sc3+)3C23−@C806− by Akasaka et al.Cyclic voltammogram (CV) of Sc3C2@C80 carried out in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) revealed that the first reduction and oxidation potentials, redE1 and oxE1, appeared at −0.50 and −0.03 V vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively, pointing out a very small electrochemical gap (0.47 V) of Sc3C2@C80.65
Wang et al. measured the CV of Sc4C2@C80 in o-DCB, revealing that the first and second oxidation potentials (oxE1 and oxE2) and the first and second reduction potentials (redE1 and redE2), appear at 0.40, 1.10, −1.16 and −1.65 V, repectively.67 Thus the electrochemical gap of Sc4C2@C80 is 1.56 V, indicates that Sc4C2@C80-Ih is a very stable endohedral fullerene. It is noteworthy that the electrochemical gap of Sc4C2@C80 is much larger than that of Sc3C2@C80.67
CV of Lu3C2@C88 showed three reversible reduction processes and one reversible oxidation step in o-DCB, which is similar to the redox properties of Gd3N@C88 and Lu3N@C88.45 Interestingly, the reduction potentials of the three reversible reduction processes for Lu3C2@C88 (−1.341, −1.700, −2.150 V) are nearly identical to those of Lu3N@C88, this is obviously due to their identical C88 cage structure. However, the first oxidation potential of Lu3C2@C88 (0.307 V) is positively shifted compared to that of Lu3N@C88 (0.019 V), suggesting that the higher oxidation potential for Lu3C2@C88 may benefit from the endohedral singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO), where the unpaired electron is embedded, and significantly affects the molecular oxidation potential.


4.4.3 Chemical reactions. 
The first study on the chemical reactions of CCFs was reported by Akasaka et al. in 2005.65 Irradiation of a 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene/benzene solution of Sc3C2@C80 and an excess molar amount of 2-adamantane-2,3-[3H]diazirine in a degassed sealed tube at room temperature using a high-pressure mercury arc lamp resulted in the cycloadduct Sc3C2@C80(Ad). The adduct was purified by preparative HPLC and single crystals were obtained for the X-ray crystallography study, revealing its intriguing carbide nature.65
More recently Wang et al. reported the spin divergence in Sc3C2@C80 fulleropyrrolidine induced by exohedral modification by the Prato reaction of Sc3C2@C80 with N-ethylglycine and 13C-enriched paraformaldehyde.97 The 5,6-ring junction was determined to be the reaction site for the Sc3C2@C80 fulleropyrrolidine monoadduct, and the endohedral Sc3C2 cluster was deformed by the pyrrolidine addend. Interestingly, it was found that the pyrrolidine addend changed the spin density distributions and altered the paramagnetic properties of Sc3C2@C80 fulleropyrrolidine.111

5. Metal oxide clusterfullerenes (OCFs)
5.1 Synthesis of OCFs
In 2008 Stevenson et al. synthesized and isolated two metal oxide clusterfullerenes: the Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 and Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 by introducing air into the arc discharge process.15 Interestingly, in the course of optimizing the yield of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 they found that increasing the air flow improved the production of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 and that a flow of 12 Torr min−1 was optimal. In addition, using the CAPTEAR method,66 it was shown that increasing content of copper nitrate dramatically improved the yield of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 and the optimal conditions for formation of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 were an air flow of 0.2 Torr min−1 with graphite rods packed with 80% Cu(NO3)2 and 20% Sc2O3, leading to a 12% yield from the soluble extract.15 More recently, the same group successfully synthesized and isolated Sc2(μ2-O)@Cs(6)-C82 as the third member of OCF family.79
5.2 Separation of OCFs
As the first isolated and characterized OCF, Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 was separated from the extract mixture by Stevenson et al. with the “SAFA” method91 discussed in section 3.3. Briefly, the raw soot mixture was first extracted with o-xylene, and the extract was stirred with diaminosilica gel, which binds and removes the more reactive fullerenes. A pure sample of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 was consequently obtained after further chromatographic purification.15

          Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 was initially separated in the same way to Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 as discussed above.15 However, recognizing that the low abundance of Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 (<0.3%) in the extract makes its HPLC fraction collection at this stage impractical, Stevenson et al. developed an alternative method to remove the bulk of the empty-cage fullerenes. Solid AlCl3 was first added to the stirred CS2 solution of extract mixture, then the endohedral fullerenes were preferentially precipitated from the solution after 5 min of reaction time, which was filtered. The filter cake was treated with an ice-water mixture and transferred to a separatory funnel containing a saturated NaHCO3 solution and CS2. As a result the endohedral fullerenes were released from the AlCl3 through the treatment with water and dissolved in the CS2 layer.92 Subsequent removal of solventviarotary evaporation and washing of the fullerene powder with diethyl ether resulted in an enriched endohedral sample containing Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80, which was subjected to the preparatory HPLC separation resulting in the purified sample of Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80.78
Likewise, Sc2(μ2-O)@Cs(6)-C82 was successfully isolated from the extract mixture by the same group using two successive stages by precipitation with AlCl3, followed by three-step HPLC.79

5.3 Structure of OCFs. 

            Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 was the first OCF whose structure was unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallographic study, indicating that the Ih-C80 cage encapsulates a distorted tetrahedral set of scandium atoms with bridging oxygen atoms asymmetrically positioned on two of the triangular faces of the Sc4 tetrahedron (Fig. 7a).15 This unit is disordered over three orientations with occupancies of 0.50, 0.30 and 0.20. Despite of the presence of this large cluster within the Ih-C80 cage, the scandium to carbon contacts are similar to those seen in related endohedral metallofullerenes such as Sc3N@Ih-C80.

More recently, the structures of both Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 and Sc2(μ2-O)@Cs(6)-C82 were also determined by X-ray crystallographic study by Balch et al.78,79 For Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 (Fig. 7b), despite of the high symmetry of the Ih-C80 cage and the near C3v symmetry of the cluster, the crystal had sufficient order so that the authors obtained the structural information successfully. It was revealed that in the Sc4(μ3-O)3 cluster the Sc–Sc distances fall into two clear groups and the separations between Sc atoms that are bridged by two oxygen atoms are shorter than the distances between scandium atoms that are bridged by only one oxygen atom. The authors also concluded that in general the Sc–Sc and Sc–O distances in Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 are similar to those in Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80.78 On the other hand, X-ray crystallographic study clearly revealed that the Cs(6) isomeric structure of the C82 cage of Sc2(μ2-O)@Cs(6)-C82 (Fig. 7c). While the oxide ion sites are clustered near the center of the carbon cage, the Sc ion positions are arranged along the walls of the fullerene. More close-up study revealed that the Cs(6)-C82 cage possessed a unique band of 10 contiguous hexagons and the Sc ions were located along that set of 10 contiguous hexagons.79

5.4 Properties of OCFs
The properties of OCFs have been rarely studied yet because of their novelty. The electronic absorption properties of OCFs were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. The UV-vis spectral comparison of the CS2 solutions of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 with Sc3N@C80 (Ih) revealed their similarity of their absorption properties.15 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of Sc2O@C82 (Cs) shows four bands in the visible range, with a particularly strong absorption at 500 nm, is similar to those of Y2C2@C82 (I) and Sc2S@Cs(6)-C82, but different to those of (Y2C2)@C82(III) and Sc2S@C3v(8)-C82.79
DFT studies of the electronic structures of Sc4(μ3-O)2,3@Ih-C80 were reported by Poblet et al., concluding that both OCFs are formed by the formal transfer of six electrons from the oxide clusters to the carbon cage. Analysis of atomic charges of Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 indicates the mixed-valence cluster picture of (Sc2,33+)2(Sc1,42+)2(O2−)2@(Ih-C80)6−, whereas in Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 all of the Sc atoms are in oxidation state of 3+, i.e., an electronic confirguration (Sc3+)4(O2−)3@(Ih-C806−) is preferred. Theoretical electrochemical studies for Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80 suggest that it should exhibit a very small HOMO–LUMO gap of only 0.60 eV, which is much smaller than that of for Sc3N@C80 (Ih) (1.18 eV). An electrochemical (EC) gap of 0.88 eV in o-DCB is predicted for Sc4(μ3-O)2@Ih-C80. In contrast, Sc4(μ3-O)3@Ih-C80 is predicted to have a more conventional behavior with a larger electrochemical gap, with the HOMO–LUMO and EC gaps being calculated to be 1.49 and 1.61 eV, respectively.112 On the other hand, Sc2(μ2-O)@Cs(6)-C82 is stabilized by the transfer of four electrons from the internal cluster to the carbon cage according to the DFT computational study. It was revealed by Poblet et al. that, among the nine IPR isomers of C82, C82:Cs(6) isomer was the most favorable to encapsulate the Sc2O cluster at T > 1200 K.79
6. Metallic sulfide cluster fullerenes (SCFs)
6.1 Synthesis of SCFs
It is known that the standard Krätschmer–Huffman DC-arc discharge method generally lead to the preferable formation of the empty fullerenes whereas the endohedral fullerenes form with only few percent yield.3–10 In the modified Krätschmer–Huffman method such as the “reactive gas atmosphere” route, the non-metal atom forming the central nitride cluster is present in a larger concentration in the plasma, which should not block the fullerene formation in total, but affords a sufficient amount of the new endohedral cluster.5,6 Following such a concept, in 2010 Dunsch and Yang et al. synthesized the first metal sulfide clusterfullerenes (SCFs) M2S@C82 (M = Sc, Y, Dy, and Lu) by using a solid sulfur-containing source guanidium thiocyanate (CH5N3·HSCN).16 Interestingly, while for NCFs the fullerene cage is predominantly Ih-C80, in the case of SCFs the C82 cage is the dominating fullerene structure.16 It should be noted that, since the nitrogen content in CH5N3·HSCN is quite high, the authors found that, besides to the formation of SCFs, CH5N3·HSCN behaved as a nitrogen source simultaneously, leading to the formation of a large number of NCFs as the dominant products.86
Several months after the aforementioned discovery of SCFs, Echegoyen et al. developed an alternative method for synthesizing SCFs by introducing SO2 as the sulfur source, and claimed to synthesize a large Sc2S@C2n (n = 40–50) family.61 They also managed to separate two different isomers of Sc2S@C82 with distinct electronic absorption and redox properties. The different selectivity on the cage size by using different sulfur sources suggests the significant influence of the sulfur source on the production of SCFs. Specifically, it is very intriguing that, although the content of oxygen in SO2 is two times higher than that of sulfur, the formation of SCFs seems much more preferred than OCFs.80
6.2 Separation of SCFs
Dunsch and Yang et al. separated the first SCF Sc2S@C82 from the as-prepared fullerene soot mixture by two-step HPLC running first on a Buckyprep column and sequentially in recycling mode on a Buckyprep-M column.16
6.3 Structure of SCFs
Using IR spectroscopy supplemented by DFT quantum-mechanical calculations, Dunsch and Yang et al. determined the cage structure of the first SCF Sc2S@C82 as C3v(8), in which the C82 cage embraces an encaged bimetallic sulfide cluster MIII2S (Fig. 8) which is not stable in such a composition without the fullerene cage.16 As shown in Fig. 8, the FTIR spectrum of the Sc2S@C82 exhibits a pronounced similarity to the FTIR spectrum of the Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8), especially in the range of the tangential vibrations of the carbon cage (1100–1700 cm−1), suggesting that the same C82-C3v(8) is the cage isomer of Sc2S@C82. This statement was further confirmed by the DFT calculations, indicating that C3v(8) was indeed the lowest energy IPR isomer of C824−, and the similarly high resemblance of the Uv-vis-NIR spectrum of Sc2S@C82 to that of Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8). More detailed analysis on the FTIR spectrum of Sc2S@C82 indicates that the metal–sulfur vibration is significantly red-shifted to 382 cm−1 because of the larger atomic mass of sulfur compared to for those for the antisymmetric metal–nitrogen stretching mode within NCFs (500–700 cm−1).16

Very recently, Echegoyen and Balch et al. determined successfully the structures of the two isomers of Sc2S@C82 separated from the fullerene soot obtained by using SO2 as the sulfur source, i.e., Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v(8)-C82 (Fig. 9).113 The crystallographic data for Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82·NiII(OEP)·2C6H6 show two remarkable features with the presence of two slightly different cage sites and a fully ordered molecule Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 in one of these sites. Interestingly, it is found that the Sc–S–Sc angles in Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v(8)-C82 differ: in Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 the Sc–S–Sc angle is 113.84(3)°, whereas in the major site in Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v-(8)-C82 that angle is narrower, 97.34(13)°, and it is also narrower in two of the three minor sites. This result is consistent with the computational prediction. The authors proposed that this was the first case where the nature and structure of the fullerene cage isomer exerted a demonstrable effect on the geometry of the encaged cluster. There is another difference between the cage structures of Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v(8)-C82 in the orientations of two pairs of carbon atoms. Despite of such differences, the carbon cages in Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82 and Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v(8)-C82 have close similarity, and may be interconverted by rotating two carbon atoms in one isomer by 90° to form the other isomer, which can be achieved through two successive Stone–Wales transformations.113
 Fig. 9  X-Ray crystal structures of Sc2(μ2-S)@C3v(8)-C82 and Sc2(μ2-S)@Cs(6)-C82113 (reproduced with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
Dunsch and Yang et al. used 45Sc NMR spectroscopy to probe the dynamic behavior of the Sc atoms encapsulated in the C82C3v(8) cage, showing only a single line at 290 ppm.16 This result suggests that either two Sc atoms are equivalent, or the cluster rotates at such rates that the signal of different Sc atoms are averaged. Further studies on the dynamics of the metal sulfide cluster within Sc2S@C82 was made by DFT Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations, revealing that the Sc2S cluster exhibits rotation around the C3 axis (more than the half-turn is accomplished over the 10 ps) with relatively small amplitude of declination. Interestingly, based on the comparison of the dynamics of Sc2S@C82 to that of Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8), it is found that the displacements of the Sc atoms in Sc2C2@C82 are not as pronounced as for the Sc atoms in the Sc2S cluster on the 10 ps timescale, suggesting that the rotation of the Sc2C2 cluster can be somewhat more hindered than the rotation of the Sc2S cluster and there is any specific preference of the rotation around the C3 axis.16
6.4 Properties of SCFs
The UV-vis-NIR electronic absorption spectra of M2S@C82-C3v(8) (M = Sc, Y, Dy and Lu) was compared with those of other C82-based endohedral fullerenes including Sc2C2@C82 (C3v), Sc@C82 (C2v) and Dy3N@C82 (Cs) (Fig. 10).16 The optical band gap of Sc2S@C82 is estimated to be 1.0 eV according to the spectral onset (ca. 1240 nm), suggesting SCFs can be classified as kinetically stable fullerenes.16 Obviously the UV-vis-NIR spectrum of Sc2S@C82 closely resembles that of Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8) both in terms of the band gap and peak positions, confirming the assignment of the C3v(8) cage isomer for Sc2S@C82, as discussed above. On the other hand, Sc@C82-C2v(9) has a much smaller HOMO–LUMO gap and hence its spectrum is extended to the NIR range, while Dy3N@C82-Cs(39663) has a larger band-gap and its spectrum26 exhibits substantially different features in the 400–800 nm range. On the contrary, for the new isomer of Sc2S@C82 (Cs) isolated by Echegoyen et al., its spectral onset is located at 1351 nm, translating to an optical band gap of 0.89 eV, which is much smaller than for the C3v(8) isomer of Sc2S@C82. Thus, Sc2S@C82 (Cs) is thought to be a small band gap fullerene.80

UV-vis-NIR spectra of Sc2S@C82, Dy2S@C82 and Lu2S@C82 in comparison to those of other endohedral fullerenes with a C82 carbon cage, including Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8), Sc@C82-C2v(9) and Dy3N@C82-Cs(39663)16 (reproduced with permission from the American Chemical Society). 

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the first SCF Sc2S@C82-C3v(8) measured by Dunsch and Yang et al. at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 (in o-DCB solution, TBABF4 as supporting electrolyte) exhibits one irreversible reduction step with reduction/reoxidation peak potentials of −1.03/−0.51 V, two reversible reduction peaks at −1.16 and −1.61 V and one reversible oxidation step at 0.48 V. If multiple cycling is performed in the limited potential range (−1.8 V to −0.8 V so that the reoxidation peak is not reached at the reverse scan) and the scan rate is sufficiently high (1 V s−1, so that diffusion layer is not renewed after the first scan), only the second and the third reduction steps can be observed at the second and following scans. Almost the same electrochemical behavior (both in terms of potentials and reversibility of reduction steps) was reported for Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8), confirming further the assignment of the C3v(8) cage isomer for Sc2S@C82.16 Contrarily, CV of Sc2S@C82 (Cs) was measured by Echegoyen et al., showing a quite different pattern: the first and second reduction peaks overlap substantially with each other whereas the third reduction peak is well-defined, while in the oxidation scan, two reversible and one irreversible oxidation peaks were observed. The electrochemical gap of Sc2S@C82 (Cs) is 1.46 eV (Fig. 11).80 The difference on the redox behaviour between Sc2S@C82-C3v(8) and Sc2S@C82-Cs(6) is clearly caused by the different cage symmetries.

The electronic structures of Sc2S@C82-C3v(8) were further studied experimentally by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and theoretically by DFT.16ESR spectroscopic result indicates that Sc2S@C82 is ESR silent, suggesting its closed-shell structure. The detailed DFT computational study of the electronic structure of Sc2S@C82-C3v(8) in comparison with Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8) shows that the energies of their frontier orbitals are very similar (Fig. 12) and confirms the formal four-fold electron transfer from the sulfide cluster to the carbon cage. It has been concluded that the bonding in Sc2S@C82-C3v(8) and Sc2C2@C82-C3v(8) are very similar and the sulfur atom resembles the carbide unit. However, the metal–sulfur interactions exhibit a higher degree of covalency than the metal–carbide bonding.16

7. Quinary metal clusterfullerenes
7.1 Metal hydrocarbide clusterfullerene (HCCF)
In 2007 Dunsch et al. synthesized and separated a new clusterfullerene encaging a hydrocarbon cluster in the carbon cage—Sc3CH@C80 by applying the DC arc-discharge method in a reactive CH4 atmosphere (Fig. 13a).14 As the first clusterfullerene structure encaging a quinary metal cluster, a metal hydrocarbide clusterfullerene (HCCF) provides a further example that the concept of a “reactive gas atmosphere” route discussed in section 3.1.1 proves to be a general method for the synthesis of new clusterfullerenes with different cluster structure as well as the number of atoms comprising the cluster. It should be noted that Sc3CH@C80 is the only reported HCCF so far.
 Fig. 13  Schematic structures of (a) Sc3CH@C8014 (copyright Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA; reproduced with permission) and (b) Sc3NC@C8017 (reproduced with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
Upon the separation of Sc3CH@C80 by multi-step HPLC, Sc3CH@C80 was extensively characterized by 45Sc NMR, ESR, UV-vis-NIR and Raman spectroscopies.14 The optical HOMO–LUMO energy gap of Sc3CH@C80 is calculated to be 1.7 eV according to the UV-vis-NIR spectroscopic study, which is exactly the same to that of Sc3N@C80 (Ih).14 The 45Sc NMR spectrum of Sc3CH@C80 reveals two equally intense NMR lines, which is completely different from the singlet 45Sc NMR signal of Sc3N@C80 (Ih). This result was interpreted by the magnetic coupling between the scandium nuclear spin and that of hydrogen within the Sc3CH hydrocarbon cluster. Thus the authors concluded that the three scandium atoms and the hydrogen atom should be bonded within one chemical moiety, forming a Sc3CH cluster which was encaged within the C80 cage.14
The low-energy Raman spectra of Sc3CH@C80 provides the spectroscopic evidence that Sc3CH@C80 possesses the same C80 (Ih) cage as Sc3N@C80 (Ih) and La2@C80 and confirmed additionally the structural properties of Sc3CH@C80—a spherical C80 cage and a Sc3CH cluster inside. Such a structural feature of Sc3CH@C80 was clarified further by DFT calculations, revealing its closed-shell and large energy gap structure.14
Since the hydrogen is stabilized in the covalent cluster Sc3CH inside the C80 cage, this discovery opens a new route for a well-defined type of hydrogen encapsulation in carbon nanostructures, which is completely different from the molecular hydrogen in C60.114
7.2 Metal carbonitride clusterfullerenes (CNCFs)
Noticing an intriguing mass-to-charge ratio of 1121 in the mass spectrum detected by Dorn et al., very recently Chen et al. predicted by DFT calculations that it should be Sc3NC@C80.115 Such a prediction was soon proved by Wang et al. with the experimental separation of Sc3NC@C80 from the fullerene soot mixture obtained from the TNT process.17 After the three-step HPLC separation, pure Sc3NC@C80 was obtained and its structure was definitely confirmed as Sc3NC@C80-Ih by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing the encapsulation of a planar quinary carbonitride cluster in a C80-Ih cage (Fig. 13b). A closed-shell electronic configuration with a valence state of [Sc3+]3[NC]3−@[C80]6− was proposed by DFT calculations.17 As the first metal carbonitride clusterfullerene (CNCF), Sc3NC@C80 is quite significant because it represents the first chemical compound in which the presence of an unprecedented (NC)3−carbonitride trianion has been disclosed.
According to single-crystal X-ray diffraction results, in the encaged Sc3NC moiety the N atom is located in the center of the cluster and the C atom resides on one side of the triangle formed by the scandium atoms. The N-C bond length is 1.193(11) Å, and the N–Sc1, N–Sc2 and N–Sc3 bond distances are 2.072(8), 2.138(5) and 2.182(6) Å, respectively. Since the sum of the four angles around the central nitrogen is 360.1°, these five atoms are proved to be organized in a plane with approximate C2v symmetry.17 Of note, the planarity of the Sc3NC moiety within Sc3NC@C80 CNCF is completely different to that of the Sc3CH within Sc3CH@C80 HCCF.14,17
Wang et al. further characterized Sc3NC@C80 CNCF by 13C NMR spectroscopy, observing two signals at 137.7 and 144.9 ppm in a 1:3 intensity ratio, which is clearly the unique feature of the C80 (Ih) cage (20 triphenylenic sites and 60 corannulenic sites). Interestingly, they found that the 13C NMR pattern of Sc3NC@C80 is similar to that of Sc3N@C80-Ih, suggesting that both Sc3NC and Sc3N endocluster undergo constant rotation within the C80-Ih cage at room temperature. The 45Sc NMR spectrum of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) exhibits two signals in a 1:2 ratio at room temperature, and this situation is different from that of Sc3N@C80 (Ih) for which a single 45Sc signal arising from equivalent Sc nuclei was observed. Therefore, Wang et al. proposed an inhomogeneous electronic environment for the three Sc atoms in the Sc3NC cluster within Sc3NC@C80 (Ih). Such an unique 45Sc NMR feature of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) should be explained by the compact Sc3NC moiety and confined rotation of the NC unit, which rotates simultaneously with the Sc nuclei, as a result an unusually high polarity induced by the C2v symmetric [Sc3NC]6+ moiety was deduced for Sc3NC@C80 (Ih).17
The vibrational structures of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) was also studied by Wang et al. and compared with that of Sc3N@C80 (Ih) and Sc3C2@C80 (Ih). In the FTIR spectrum of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih), the tangential cage modes ranging from 1200 to 1600 cm−1 and the radical cage modes at about 574 cm−1 exhibit a high resemblance to those of Sc3N@C80 (Ih) and Sc3C2@C80 (Ih), confirming further the similarity of the C80 cage structure. Likewise, their C80 (Ih) cage modes between 1200 and 1600 cm−1 are also very similar, according to the Raman spectroscopic comparison. However, for Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) a group of lines accounting for the N-dominated δ(Sc-NC-Sc) bending modes and νs(SC–NC) stretch modes appears at about 468 cm−1 in the low-wavenumber range, whereas such modes are absent or hardly discernible in Sc3N@C80 (Ih) and Sc3C2@C80 (Ih).17
The electronic properties of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), exhibiting reversible first reduction and first oxidation steps with redE1 and oxE1 being −1.05 and 0.6 V, respectively. Accordingly the electrochemical energy gap of Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) is 1.65 V, which is 0.21 V smaller than that of Sc3N@C80 (Ih) (redE1 = −1.24 V, oxE1 = 0.62 V). Hence, it was concluded that Sc3NC@C80 (Ih) has similar electron-donating abilities to Sc3N@C80 (Ih), but is more electrophilic than Sc3N@C80 (Ih).17
While Sc3NC@C80 is the only member of NCF separated so far, with its fascinating intramolecular dynamics bringing about high polarity and promising ferroelectricity,17 two other CNCFs including Sc3NC@C78 and Sc3NC@C68 were also predicted by Chen et al. along with Sc3NC@C80. Notably the lowest-energy isomer of Sc3NC@C78 has a non-IPR C78 (C2: 22010) outer cage, while Sc3NC@C68 was predicted to have the non-IPR C68 (D3: 6140) cage adopted by the Sc3N@C68 NCF. Moreover, the bonding natures of these three CNCFs Sc3NC@C2n (2n = 80, 78, 68) were theoretically studied in detail, revealing that the Sc3NC cluster has a covalent bonding nature which is independent of the outer cages.115 Such predicted new CNCF structures might stimulate the experimental efforts on their synthesis and separation.
8. Potential applications of clusterfullerenes
As mentioned already in the two general reviews by Dunsch and Yang as well as the more recent reviews by Echegoyen et al., the intriguing properties arising from the charge transfer from the encaged metal clusters to the fullerene cage enable clusterfullerenes, especially NCFs, promising in potential applications including biomedicine, molecular electronics and photonics etc.5,6,8,9
The application of water-soluble endohedral fullerenes as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents has been extensively studied in recent years, because their ability to reduce the spin relaxation time of water protons is much better than that of the currently used GdIII chelates, while the carbon cage prevents the release of toxic Gd in organisms.5,6,8,9 Following a previous report on the in vitro and in vivo imaging studies on Gd3N@C80 functionalized with poly(ethylene glycol) units (Gd3N@C80-[DiPEG5000(OH)x]) with remarkably higher relaxivity (quantified by their longitudinal relaxivity factor r1) than that for commercial agents (e.g., gadodiamide),116 Dorn et al. reported in a more recent study that, by varying the chain length of PEG (350–5000 Da), the 350/750 Da PEG derivatives exhibited the highest relaxivities (r1 = 237/232 mM−1 s−1) at a clinical-range magnetic field of 2.4 T, which is ca. 60 times higher than that of commercially available Gd3+ ion chelated contrast agents (r1 ≈ 4 mM−1 s−1).117 More recently, Braun et al. synthesized a GdxSc3−xN@C80-BioShuttle-conjugate (Gd-cluster@-BioShuttle), which has high proton relaxation and high signal enhancement at very low Gd concentrations in comparison to the commonly used contrast agents (>500-fold than that of the commercial contrast agent Gd-DTPA).118 This modularly designed contrast agent represents a new tool for improved monitoring and evaluation of interventions at the gene transcription level. Using the Gd-cluster@-BioShuttle as MRI contrast agent allows an improved evaluation of radio- or chemotherapy treated tissues.118
Because of the large range of HOMO–LUMO gaps which can be tuned by the encaged metal clusters and the outer carbon cages, clusterfullerenes show very interesting electronic properties useful in molecular electronics and photonics.5,6,8,9 Echegoyen et al. synthesized a ferrocene adduct of Sc3N@C80 (Ih), and detected the photoinduced electron transfer between the ferrocene moiety and the fullerene as well as the significantly stabilized radical ion pair.119 More recently, Drees et al. integrated for the first time the methano derivatives of the Lu3N@C80 as new acceptors for organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) and found that the reduced energy offset of the molecular orbitals of Lu3N@C80 to the donor, poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) reduced energy losses in the charge transfer process and increased the open circuit voltage (Voc) to 260 mV above reference devices made with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric methyl ester (C60-PCBM) acceptor. As a result power conversion efficiencies >4% were achieved using P3HT as the donor material. Hence, such NCFs represent an entirely new class of acceptor materials for organic solar cells, that show a straightforward path towards commercially viable devices.120
9. Conclusions and outlook
The field of endohedral fullerene has been greatly advanced since the discovery of the first stable endohedral metallofullerene La@C82 in 1991.2 Specifically the discovery of the Sc3N@C80 NCF11 in 1999 opened up a novel branch of endohedral fullerenes—clusterfullerenes—fullerenes with metal clusters encaged in its hollow and appear to be the fastest growing family of endohedral fullerenes up to now. Besides NCFs, a number of other types of clusterfullerenes including CCFs, OCFs, SCFs, HCCFs, CNCFs have been discovered within the past decade, and different synthesis methods have been developed for different types of clusterfullerenes. By varying the structure of the encaged metal cluster, clusterfullerenes show quite different molecular and electronic structures as well as different chemical properties, as presented in this article.
Metal clusters encaged in the clusterfullerenes are typically consisted of multiple metal atoms and non-metal atom(s). So far the metal atoms which are reported to form clusterfullerene structures are quite limited to group-IIIB metals (Sc, Y, and lanthanide) and one group-IVB metal (Ti), while the non-metal atom(s) is also limited to such atoms as N, C, O, S and combination of C/H, N/C. Despite of such limitations, a wealth of novel clusterfullerenes have been synthesized and separated already due to the feasibility of tuning the encaged cluster species (the type of cluster, type of metal, and mixed metals etc.) and of stabilizing a large variety of cage sizes (C68–C96)20,46 including different isomeric structures. Therefore, clusterfullerenes appear to be the most versatile branch of endohedral fullerenes. Yet, there remain still several intriguing questions to be addressed. For instance, considering the large number of possible cluster structures which may form with the combination of the above-mentioned metal and non-metal atoms, which rules are valid for determining which type of metal clusters could be encapsulated into the carbon cage? Besides, in terms of the number of atoms encapsulated within carbon cage, so far the maximum number is six for Sc4C2@C80,67 can an even larger number of atoms be encapsulated? The answer to this question would probably lead to the discovery of new types of clusterfullerenes.
Chemical functionalizations of clusterfullerenes have been less studied compared to empty fullerenes and conventional endohedral metallofullerenes. Up to now most studies of chemical functionalization of clusterfullerenes have been focused on NCFs, including Diels–Alder reactions, 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, photochemical silylation, alkylation and carbene additions, Bingel–Hirsch reactions, and free-radical reactions etc.5,6,8,9 More recently, Wang et al. reported the discovery of an unprecedented open-cage endohedral fullerenevia the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of Ih-Sc3N@C80 NCF with in situ generated 4,5-diisopropoxybenzyne.121 Such a discovery indicates that new chemical functionalizations of NCFs and other clusterfullerenes are yet to be explored, affording new derivatives of clusterfullerenes with interesting properties and promising applications in e.g. biomedicine and organic photovoltaics.
