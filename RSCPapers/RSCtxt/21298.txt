Unlike those volatile chlorinated additives, a small portion of Cl anions from CaCl2 seem to enter into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, yet most insulating CaCl2 remains within the perovskite film, which is detrimental to perovskite solar cells.
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted significant attention owing to their extraordinary characteristics such as high absorption coefficient,1 tunable optical bandgaps,2 high carrier mobilities,3 and long electron and hole diffusion lengths.4,5 Within a very short timeframe, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite based solar cells has rocketed to a certified 20.1%6 since they were first introduced.7–12
Currently, most of the significant device enhancements have been achieved by the realization of high-quality perovskite films, suggesting that the film morphology such as uniformity and surface coverage is of prime importance for the high-efficiency operation of perovskite solar cells.13–16 The use of additives has been reported as a simple yet effective way of controlling the film morphology by successfully manipulating the nucleation and growth of the perovskite crystals, thereby improving the device performance. For instance, by adding HI, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) or CH3NH3Cl to their corresponding standard precursor solutions, the continuous and uniform HC(NH2)2PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx or CH3NH3PbI3 films were made, respectively.17–20 Most of these reported additives are then evaporated or sublimed during the thermal annealing step.
Moreover, recent studies showed that Cl− had a great impact on the crystallization dynamics.18,20–23 The Cl incorporation has proved to yield a longer diffusion length of carriers (∼1 μm)5 and higher electrical conductivity.24 However, the function of chloride ions in the formation of perovskite film remains a mystery.
Herein, we prepare a dense and uniform perovskite film by adding nonvolatile compounds such as NaCl and CaCl2 additives to the standard CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution consisting of an equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2. It was found that Cl− had a significant influence on the film morphology by altering the kinetics of perovskite crystal growth. Interestingly, XRD measurements verify the formation of an intermediate phase preceding the crystallization, which helps to avoid incomplete and uneven surface coverage. Unlike those volatile additives such as CH3NH3Cl and HI, most of the added insulating CaCl2 remains in the final perovskite film, which is detrimental to the device performance, despite the partial inclusion into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. We therefore argue that good additives used in solution chemistry of the perovskite film should not only enable to improve the film morphology but also possess the removability. Note that other inorganic chloride salts such as NaCl have similar effects on such film formation. We choose CaCl2 as a proof-of-concept due to its relatively large solubility in DMF compared to NaCl.
All perovskite films were prepared via the one-step solution method on the quartz substrate from CH3NH3I:PbI2:CaCl2 precursor mixtures with a molar ratio of 1:1:0.5, followed by thermal annealing at 95 °C. Fig. 1 compares optical spectra of annealed perovskite films over annealing time with the starting film before annealing. The unannealed perovskite film exhibits a typical absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3.25 With an increase in thermal annealing time, the annealed perovskite film shows an increase in the visible absorbance across the entire spectral range, particularly in the range of 600–750 nm, and remains unchanged after 20 min, indicating that the conversion of the perovskite crystal structure is complete.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted to explore the effect of CaCl2 in precursor solution on the perovskite film morphology. By using the standard precursor solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2, as displayed in Fig. 2a and b, a poor film morphology is formed showing needle-shaped crystals and incomplete, uneven surface coverage, which is consistent with previous reports.20,26 By the addition of CaCl2, closely packed crystals are generated and the film becomes uniform with noticeably improved surface coverage as shown in Fig. 2c and d. This morphological variation caused by CaCl2 is similar to the case of CH3NH3Cl.20 It seems reasonable that free Cl− ionized from CaCl2 in DMF solution plays a vital role in regulating the crystallization dynamics to improve the film topography. After thermal annealing for 20 min, some white spots show up. These tiny spots are probably the segregation of CaCl2, which could be attributed to thermally induced recrystallization of CaCl2 (Fig. 2e and f). In addition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of a fully annealed perovskite film (Fig. 2d and e) discloses a homogeneous distribution of Pb, I, Ca and Cl elements throughout the whole film.

In order to further understand how Cl− functions during the formation of the perovskite film, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out. Fig. 3a displays the XRD patterns of perovskite films obtained from CH3NH3I:PbI2:CaCl2 precursor mixtures as a function of thermal annealing time, in comparison with the spin-coated CaCl2 film. CaCl2 exhibits an intense peak at 31.70°, while all perovskite films show strong diffraction peaks at 14.08°, 28.41° and 31.73°, assigned to the 110, 220, and 310 reflections of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 phase, respectively, which are in good agreement with other reports.27,28 Upon heat treatment, all these annealed perovskite films present similar XRD patterns in which all diffraction peaks become sharper and enhanced in intensity with increasing thermal annealing time due to improved crystallinity. It is worth noting that an additional peak of 10.70° appears in the unannealed perovskite film (Fig. 3b), which disappears after thermal annealing of only 1 min. This could be indicative of the formation of an instable intermediate phase induced by Cl− preceding the crystallization step. A possible explanation is that this intermediate phase inhibits the formation of elongated crystals and incomplete coverage, and upon heat treatment it undergoes the rearrangement by releasing Cl−, which is consistent with the SEM observation in Fig. 2. Moreover, the (310) diffraction peak at 31.73° of the CaCl2 treated perovskite film that is overlapped with the characteristic peak of CaCl2 at 31.70° is down-shifted and broadened with prolonged thermal annealing time. This is presumed to relate to the CaCl2 recrystallization.

Furthermore, both EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results confirm the above assumption. The lead, calcium, chlorine and iodine elements are detected in the perovskite films from the EDX profiles (Fig. 4a). The lead amount shows a slight drop while the amounts of chlorine and calcium exhibit a little increase as thermal annealing went on. This indicates that the low-density CaCl2 agent may have migrated to the upper portion of the perovskite film, which coincides with SEM and XRD results of the recrystallization process of CaCl2. To explore further where and how Cl is located and bonded in the perovskite film, XPS spectra were acquired as shown in Fig. 4b. The unannealed perovskite film has a 2p3/2 signal of Cl at 198.8 eV, the same as CaCl2, suggesting the significant absence of Cl in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. Note that the Cl signal in the annealed perovskite film has an up-shift by 0.5 eV, implying the likelihood of a partial inclusion of Cl into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. Likely, most Cl− ions precipitate out as CaCl2 in the film after inducing a preferred orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal grains. In short, the possible chemical pathways among CaCl2, CH3NH3I and PbI2 during film formation are shown in Fig. 4c. The mixture of CaCl2, CH3NH3I and PbI2 first forms a kind of “solid solution”, which is unstable yet helpful in avoiding the formation of large needle-shaped CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, resulting in the incomplete surface coverage. Then after heat treatment, CH3NH3PbI3 is successfully generated out of the solid solution, and most of the Cl− and Ca2+ precipitate out in the form of CaCl2 while Cl− is partially incorporated into CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. However, the exact chemical pathways are very difficult to determine due to the high instability of the intermediate state.

(b) XPS spectra (Cl 2p core level) of CaCl2, unannealed and annealed perovskite films. (c) Possible chemical pathways among CaCl2, CH3NH3I and PbI2 during the formation of the perovskite film. 
Finally, in order to test the effect of nonvolatile CaCl2 on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3I:PbI2:CaCl2 precursor mixtures with varied molar ratios, the solar cells were constructed with a typical configuration of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/Ca/Al device with an active area of 0.11 cm2. Fig. 5a–c show the photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing CaCl2 treated perovskite planar photovoltaic cells under AM 1.5G simulated light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The best cells' characteristics are summarized in Table S1† and their average values with a standard deviation of 10 individual devices are presented in Table S2.†

With the increasing molar ratio of CaCl2, the device performs worse. Interestingly, the deterioration of device performance mainly lies in the short-circuit current density (JSC) rather than the open-circuit voltage (VOC). This agrees well with our other results, suggesting that the perovskite layer contains a certain amount of insulating CaCl2. Note that the exact impact of the remaining Ca element remains unclear and needs further investigation. In addition, all of these devices exhibit the serious hysteresis. This could be explained by the fact that the perovskite layer here accumulates the charge carriers if the charges are not quickly transferred or transported into electron and hole conductors, respectively.29,30Fig. 5d shows the representative external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of CaCl2 treated perovskite cells, also showing a decrease of EQE with increasing proportion of CaCl2, which indicates the aggravated photon-to-electron conversion.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully prepared a uniform CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with full surface coverage by adding the nonvolatile CaCl2 additive into its precursor solution. CaCl2 was found to modulate the crystallization kinetics and improve the film formation of perovskite. XRD measurements verify that an intermediate phase induced by Cl− inclusion exists during the crystallization process. Moreover, EDX and XPS spectra show that upon heat treatment, most Cl− ions precipitate out as insulating CaCl2 from this intermediate phase and remain in the final perovskite film while a small amount of Cl− ions may enter into the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. As a result, CaCl2 treated CH3NH3PbI3 based planar solar cells were shown to yield poor device performance.
