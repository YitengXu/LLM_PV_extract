    , Accepted 31st May 2017First published on 31st May 2017AbstractTwo novel amphipathic small molecular conjugated electrolytes (SMCEs) with self-doping effect were successfully synthesized by incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as n-type backbone and amine-based groups as polar pendants. In favor of the n-type backbone and amine-based groups, an obvious n-type doping was obtained, resulting in the dramatically improved conductivity of the SMCEs. The formation of the polar group induced dipoles at the SMCEs/Al interface to provide a favorable energy for cathode. Subsequently, the two small molecule electrolytes as cathode interlayers have been successfully applied in the polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a wide thickness range from 7–33 nm. A notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.2% for PSCs were achieved. And the two SMCEs also showed a good universality with substantial performance. These findings indicate that these small molecular conjugated electrolytes are promising candidates as cathode interlayers for highly efficient polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), which are low-cost, light-weight, mechanical flexibility and printable, have attracted much attention in the past few years.1–5 Recently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the single-junction PSCs have improved up to ∼12% for small-area devices.4,6 However, it still lags behind the requirement for the commercial application. To improve efficiency of PSCs, the design of new active layer photovoltaic materials,7–9 device optimization and interfacial engineering have been demonstrated to be the successful strategies.2 Among of these, interfacial engineering is an efficient approach to obtain relatively high PCE. An excellent interlayer can effectively control the active layer/electrode interface to form compatible ohmic contact,10,11 which can alleviate the interfacial energy barrier and facilitate holes and electrons to transfer to the corresponding electrodes. In addition, the interlayer also impacts the vertical phase separation of the active layer, which is very crucial for the charge selective injection. Therefore, interfacial modification have significant influence on the device performance parameters, such as open-circuit voltage (Voc),12,13 short-circuit current density (Jsc),14,15 and fill factor (FF).16
Conjugated electrolytes consisting of a conjugated main chain and polar ionic side group have been regarded as one of the most efficient interfacial materials due to their some unique properties, such as favoring intimate contact with both the hydrophobic organic active layer and hydrophilic electrode, easy to implement alcohol-soluble fabrication without intermixing with the halogenated solvent processed active layer. Normally, varieties of amino-group-functionalized conjugated polymers based on fluorene and their derivatives have been successfully used as cathode interlayer in the state-of-the-art solar cells, such as poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN).17,18 Recently, small molecular electrolytes with amine-based groups show more attractive compared to their polymeric counterparts because of their well-defined structure, simple synthesis and purification, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.19,20 The polar groups can form strong interfacial dipole moments in the cathode interface and adjust work function of cathode, resulting in a shift of vacuum level at the electrolyte/cathode (such as Ag, Al). In fact, the backbone of conjugated electrolytes also has important influence on the characteristics of interlayer materials. However, most of reported polyelectrolytes used for cathode interlayers are based on p-type conjugated or non-conjugated backbones, e.g. polythiophenes, polyfluorenes, polycarbazoles, and polyethylenimine.21–24 These backbones can't transport the electrons, they thus only worked efficiently with a ultra-thin film (usually less than 10 nm),25,26 which is not beneficial to large-area production and high throughput commercial application.
To improve the conductivity of the electrolytes interlayers, two strategies have been usually considered. One is to select the n-type and p-type conjugated backbone employed as cathode and anode interlayer to facilitate electrons and holes transportation respectively, as well as improve the charge selective collection. Very recently, a limited number of the n-type conjugated electrolyte as thick cathode interlayers based on perylenediimides (PDI), naphthalimides (NDI) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were reported.25–29 Another approach to improve the conductivity of the electrolytes interlayers is introducing the doping effect into the molecules. It has been reported that p-type conjugated electrolyte as anode interlayer with p-doping exhibited a high conductivity.30,31 And our group also studied n-type self-doping to endow the conjugated electrolyte as cathode modifier with a higher conductivity.27,32 However, the work mechanism of these high conductivity and thick-insensitive interlayers has not been fully addressed.
In this study, we developed two novel amphipathic small molecule conjugated electrolytes (SMCEs) FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M by fusing n-type backbone, amine-based pendants with self-doping effect (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the two SMCEs as cathode interlayers have been successfully applied in the conventional device and obtained a notable PCE of 9.2% for the PSC based on poly[[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]](PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butylic acid methyl ester (PC71BM), which are all higher than that of device with PFN, and 10.2% for ternary blend system. And we obtained a substantial performance with ∼33 nm thickness of the cathode interlayer. Therefore, incorporation of the n-type backbone and self-doping effect in the amine-based electrolyte is promising for a thick cathode interlayer to meet the future large-scale printing technique while without sacrifice of the device performance of the PSCs.

Result and discussion
The SMCEs, FDPP2-M and FDPP2-N, were synthesized from diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPP)-based bromide with flourene boronic acid pinacol ester by simple Suzuki coupling reaction. Incorporation of electron-deficient DPP moiety into the molecules is to favor the n-type nature in the backbone and improve the electron affinity for n-type doping. And incorporated into fluorine in the backbone is to down-shift the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy, which is beneficial to ohmic contact with active layer. In addition, two different amine-based functional groups, trimethylamine and methylimidazole, were introduced to investigate the effect of the polar groups on the electrical properties of the SMCEs. Due to the existence of the salt polar pendent groups in the side chain, the resulting FDPP2-M and FDPP2-N can be easily dissolved in the polar solvents including methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) etc. All the intermediates and final product have been thoroughly purified, and the chemical structures of the products were characterized by spectroscopic methods, from which satisfactory analysis data were obtained. The synthetic details and characterizations have been provided in the ESI (Scheme S1 and Fig. S1†).
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the small molecule conjugated electrolyte FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M methanol solutions and in solid states are shown in Fig. S2 in (ESI†). FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M solutions showed the absorption peaks at 558 nm and 553 nm, while for the solid films, the absorption bands peak at 633 nm and 631 nm, respectively. Compared to their corresponding solutions, the films showed a prominent red-shift with broadened absorption, because of the DPP backbone favoring the strong solid-state packing.26 The calculated optical band gap (Eoptg) of FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M is 1.54 eV and 1.52 eV, respectively. The Frontier molecular orbital energy of FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV),33,34 as shown in Fig. S3a and S3b in ESI.† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M were determined to be −5.13 eV/−3.78 eV, −5.10 eV/−3.80 eV, respectively. From the optical and electrochemical data summarized in Table S1 in ESI,† we can see that the different polar groups have no significant impact on the energy levels of the FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M.
The PSCs were fabricated to evaluate the interfacial modification ability of the two SMCEs in PSCs. To avoid the absorption loss of the active layer caused by the SMCEs, the devices were based on a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/cathode interlayer/Al with PTB7-Th:PC71BM as active layer (Fig. 1).35,36 The detailed information of the devices fabrication and active layer materials has been provided in ESI.† The two SMCEs were employed as cathode interlayer prepared by spin-coating from methanol solution on the surface of active layer. Meanwhile, the device with the PFN interlayer was also fabricated for comparison. All the device performance data are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The device with PFN as cathode modifier exhibited an open-voltage (Voc) of 0.780 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 15.90 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.4%, yielding a satisfied PCE of 8.1%. Intriguingly, the two SMCEs inserted between the active layer and Al electrode can further improved the PCE to 9.0% with a Voc of 0.790 V, a Jsc of 16.8 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.7% for FDPP2-N and to the highest value of 9.2% for FDPP2-M, together with a Voc of 0.795 V, a Jsc of 16.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 68.5%. The improved performance indicates that the two small molecules are promising cathode interfacial materials for efficient PSCs.

To explore the origin of the improvement in the device performance, the work functions (WF) of the SMCEs modified Al electrodes were measured by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy UPS (Fig. 3). After deposition of the two SMCEs on the Al electrode, the WF of the SMCE/Al electrode dramatically decreased. The reduced WFs can decrease the Schottky barrier and form a better energy alignment in the device to improve the electron injection. Compared with FDPP2-N/Al, FDPP2-M/Al showed slightly lower WF value, in favor of a better ohmic contact with the active layer. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are displayed in Fig. 2. Apparently, the devices with FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M showed the enhanced EQE values from 300–800 nm than the one with PFN. The integration of the EQE values with AM1.5G spectrum matched well with the corresponding Jsc values obtained from J–V measurement within 5% error. To further understand the improvement of carrier injection and collection, the J–V characteristic of all the devices were measured under dark. In Fig. 2, the reverse current (from −2 to 0 V) of the PSCs with SMCEs, especially with FDPP2-M, were greatly suppressed than the PFN-based PSCs. The suppressed dark current implies that the recombination of charge was decreased, consequently leading to the enhanced FF. This is because the n-type nature of the DPP-based backbone can block the hole injection and facilitate the electron transport. Therefore, the electron selective injection was greatly improved in the n-type molecules than in the p-type electrolyte.21,37

Apart from the improved device performance, we delightfully found that unlike the PFN interlayer that normally works in an ultrathin film, the n-type DPP-based SMCEs can function well in a much thicker film. For the PFN that based on the p-type backbone, the electrons injected from the active layer to electrode are supported by the “channel effect”, thus the film should be very thin, normally 5–6 nm. While for the DPP-based SMCEs, the n-type backbone possessed the intrinsic electron transport property, such that they acted not only as a modifier for the cathode, but also as the electron transport layers and hole blocking layers. Both FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M can remain over 90% value of PCE at the thickness of ∼25 nm, and near 85% value of PCE at the thickness of ∼33 nm. The electron mobilities were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the structure of electron-only device ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/SMCEs/Al. The device with PFN made the electron mobility of 4.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M treated devices improved the electron mobility to 6.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 2). In addition, the conductivity of the n-type SMCEs films were also investigated. The conductivity of FDPP2-M film is 1.52 × 10−6 S cm−1, which is higher than that of FDPP2-N film (1.23 × 10−6 S cm−1) (Fig. S4 in ESI†). The remarkably improved electron mobility and conductivity should be responsible for the well-maintained performance with the thick interlayers, as well as contributed to the improved Jsc. The insensitivity to the thickness of the alcohol-soluble n-SCMEs makes them a great potential for large-scale print-preparation in the future.
Generally speaking, the high conductivity and charge selectivity can only ensure the charge transport smoothly through the thick interlayer with minimized trapping and recombination. In fact, the trapping and recombination still exist in the interlayer, the device performance would drop more or less as the thickness of the interlayer increases. Unexpectedly, the thinnest FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M films with a thickness of 6–7 nm didn't deliver the best device performance, but the highest PCE together with all of the optimized parameters was obtained in the device with a much thicker interlayer instead, as shown in the Fig. 4 and Table 1. It also can be found that the WFs of the SMCE/Al electrode strongly depend on the SMCEs thickness (Fig. 5a and b). As the thickness of the interlayer increased, the WF of FDPP2-N/Al electrode decreased from −4.28 eV to −3.80 eV and the WF of FDPP2-M/Al also decreased from −4.28 eV to −3.70 eV. When the thickness of the SMCEs > 11 nm, the WF of SMCE/Al electrode kept constant. This phenomenon is quite different from the case of the PFN modified metal electrode, where the WF remained unchanged with the thickness varying. It has been reported that, due to the amine-based polar group assembling on the metal surface, the mechanism of interface modification by PFN turns out to be the formation of the mirror dipoles or “double dipole step” at the interfaces to reduce the WF of the electrode, the WF of the modified electrode therefore is independent on the thickness of the PFN modifier.10,22,38 Due to the SMCEs also possessing the amine-based polar group, such the mirror dipoles or “double dipole step” undoubtedly formed at the interface of SMCE/Al with the direction pointing out of Al cathode and made the reduction of WF.

As for the thickness dependence of the WF of SMCE/Al electrode, we speculated that it should be ascribed to the n-type self-doping effect. As shown in Fig. 5c, both FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M films presented the distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signals from the unpaired electron, indicating that the n-type self-doping in SMCEs was obtained. And the radical anions in backbone can be further stabilized by the polar pendant through electrostatic interaction.30 With respect to the FDPP2-N, the FDPP2-M exhibited more pronounced ESR signal. It should be due to the methylimidazole reducing the interaction with the Br− ions, which make Br− ions more easily realize the n-type doping on the backbone.27 Such n-type self-doping is very favorable for the improvement in the conductivity of the SMCEs, well consistent with conductivity results. It is worthy to note that the interfacial interaction could also be altered or strengthened by doping, and WF of the electrode is sensitive to the interlayer thickness and relies on the doping density.39,40 As a result, the WF of the SMCE/Al as well as the Voc varied with the thickness. The strengthened interfacial interaction by SMCEs was verified by the pyrene monomer fluorescence measurement.41,42 As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2 in ESI,† we employed the pyrene dissolved in the two electrolytes solution and spin-coating on the ITO and then to detect the fluorescence intensities change of FDPP2-N/pyrene and FDPP2-M/pyrene solid states, respectively. By comparing the intensity of the 0–0 band (band 1) and band 3, the calculated ratio of I1/I3 of pyrene in FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M were 7.22 and 11.32, respectively, revealing that the polarities of FDPP2-M were stronger than FDPP2-N. The stronger polarity originated from the strengthened interfacial interaction in FDPP2-M.
Based on the above mentioned observation, the mechanism of the n-type SMCEs to modified Al electrode was proposed and schematically illustrated in Fig. 5d. The formation of the mirror dipoles at the SMCE/Al interface induced by the amine-based polar groups and the strengthened interfacial interaction by self-doping effect of SMCEs synergistically contributed to the substantially reduced WF through the downshift of the Al vacuum level. Consequently, the best device performance was achieved with the relatively thick interlayer modification but not with the ultra-thin film. This means that incorporation of the n-type backbone and self-doping effect in the electrolyte interlayer is expected to be able to process a thick cathode interlayer to meet the future large-scale printing technique while without sacrifice of the device performance. When the interlayer thickness went on, the WF and Voc kept constant, suggesting the electron transport was dominated in much thicker films.
For the conventional structure device, the interlayers has little effect on the morphology of active layer, but after deposition of interlayers can improved the contact between electrode and active layer. Fig. S5 in ESI† shows the water contact angle (θ) of interfacial layer deposited on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend layer, The surface of pristine PTB7-Th:PC71BM is hydrophobic with contact angles (θ) of 82.9°. After PFN deposited on the top of PTB7-Th:PC71BM film, the surface became slightly more hydrophilic with a water contact angle of 71.7°. Replacing the PFN with FDPP2-N or FDPP2-M, the contact angles (θ) decreased dramatically to 52.6°and 48.7°, respectively. It means that an accumulation of the pendant polar groups formed on the top surface of organic PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer film, which would enhance the interaction with the subsequently deposited Al electrode. Fig. S6 in ESI† shows the surface morphologies of interfacial layer deposited on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM, observed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). The pristine PTB7-Th:PC71BM film exhibited relatively smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.87 nm. When PFN deposited on the active layer, the RMS is 1.14 nm. However, FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M have caused obvious change, and the RMS is improved to 2.32 nm and 2.28 nm, respectively. The slightly improved RMS of the interlayers also can provide an intimate contact with the Al electrode, in favor of the PCE enhancement.
To further confirm and testify the universality of this two SMCEs, the conventional device based on polymer polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene-co-benzodithio-phene (PTB7) as a donor and PC71BM as a acceptor were fabricated. The corresponding J–V characteristics and devices parameters are summarized in Fig. S7 and Table S3 in ESI.† The FDPP2-M as cathode interfacial layer yielded a decent PCE of 7.93% with a Voc of 0.742 V, a Jsc of 15.84 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68.1%. The FDPP2-N based device also obtained a PCE of 7.66%. Both of them achieved a higher device performance than PFN (7.18%). And the improved PCEs of the SMCEs modified devices are mainly related to the Voc, Jsc and FF. And we also applied the new interlayers in non-fullerene system with conventional device. When the J61:ITIC (poly(4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(dode-cylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole):3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) was used as the active layer, the PCE of 9.12% with Voc of 0.900 V, a Jsc of 15.84 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.0% was achieved for the device based on FDPP2-N. The PCE of 8.83% with Voc of 0.894 V, a Jsc of 15.64 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.2% was obtained for the device based on FDPP2-M. When the J51 (poly(4-(5-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thio-phen-2-yl)-6-methylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-2-yl)thio-phen-2-yl)-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole)):ITIC as active layer,43 FDPP2-N and FDPP2-M also delivered the decent PCE of 8.06% and 8.16%, respectively, which are all higher than the devices with Ca as interface layer, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 1. We further investigated the interfacial modification of SMCEs in a ternary organic solar cell with an inverted device structure based on 7,7-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5-hexyl-[2,2-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (p-DTS-(FBTTH2)2, PTB7-Th and PC71BM.44 For the inverted device, a notable PCE of 10.2%, with a Voc of 0.768 V, a Jsc of 18.44 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.8% for FDPP2-M and the PCE of 9.7% with a Voc of 0.762 V, a Jsc of 17.97 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.6% for FDPP2-N was achieved (Fig. 7 and Table 1). Compared with n-SCMEs/ZnO as interfacial materials, the PFN/ZnO show the inferior photoelectric properties, as shown in Fig. S10 and Table S4.† This results indicate the two SMCEs cathode interlayers have good universality for PSCs.

Conclusions
To summarize, two n-type SMCEs based DPP with amine-based pendants were synthesized as cathode interlayer for polymer solar cells. We found that the formation of the polar group-induced dipoles at the SMCE/Al interface and the strengthened interfacial interaction by n-type self-doping effect of SMCEs synergistically contributed to the substantially reduced WF of the Al electrode. The conductivity was found to be dramatically improved in the interlayers by n-type self-doping. Subsequently, the two SMCEs as cathode interlayers have been successfully applied in the PSCs with a thickness ∼33 nm. The best PCE of 9.2% was achieved for the PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM, which are much higher than that of device with PFN interlayer. The two SMCEs also showed a good universality for the application as cathode interlayer in the PSCs with different active materials systems. For the non-fullerene system, the best PCE was 9.12%, and a notable PCE reached 10.2% for ternary blend PSCs. More interestingly, the best device performance was obtained with the relatively thick interlayer modification but not with the ultra-thin film. The two n-SCMEs are alcohol solubility and insensitive to the thickness. Thus, it show a great potential for large-scale print-preparation in the future.
