    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 13th August 2014AbstractA novel and facile strategy has been successfully developed to synthesize uniform gold@titanium dioxide octahedral nanocages (Au@TiO2), which have a well-defined double-shelled structure with Au as the internal shell and TiO2 as the external shell. The unique Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages were elaborately fabricated by a Cu2O-templated strategy combining with spatially confined galvanic replacement. The formation process of these delicate hierarchical octahedral architectures is discussed in detail. The catalytic performance of the Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages was investigated using the reduction of 4-nitrophenol as a model reaction. The mesoporous structure of both the Au and TiO2 shells provides direct access for the reactant molecules to diffuse and subsequently interact with the Au shell. This novel catalyst shows excellent and stable activity for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol, which can be recycled for ten successive cycles of the reaction with a conversion efficiency of more than 90%. The superior catalytic activity attributes to mesoporous double shells, enhanced synergistic effects between the Au and TiO2 shells and the unique properties of the octahedral structure. More importantly, the as-obtained Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages also show potential applications in solar cells, organocatalysis and water splitting.
1. Introduction
Hollow nanostructures have attracted tremendous attention over the past few decades because of their unique properties, such as designable morphology, low density, large void space, high surface area and shell permeability, which give them potential usefulness for applications in catalysis, delivery vehicles, photonic materials, optics, sensors, and rechargeable batteries.1–3 Specifically, anisotropic nanocages with non-spherical shapes and regular interiors are of particular interest for their fascinating advantages.4–6 For instance, anisotropic cages are beneficial in biomedical applications,5 targeted drug delivery,6 and energy storage.7 Their anisotropic features even give them the possibility to be essential building blocks of complex hierarchical architectures with multiple functionalities.8
Noble metal nanocages are a class of most widely investigated materials owing to their unique properties and great importance in many advanced applications. For example, Fang et al. synthesized Au mesocages, which show a strong shape effect in highly sensitive single-particle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.9 Xia et al. highlighted the photothermal properties of Au nanocages for both cancer diagnosis and treatment.10 El-sayed et al. found that Au nanoparticles having sharp corners and edges have enhanced catalytic activity.11 Up to now, noble metal nanocages have been synthesized by several groups12–21 using Ag polyhedrons, Ag2O, Co, Te, Ni or Cu2O nanostructures as sacrificial templates via selective removal of the core from the core/shell structures. Although many advances in the synthesis and applications of hollow noble metal with controllable structures have been achieved, it still remains a problem that noble metal nanostructures tend to deform owing to their exposure to reactants and the surrounding medium, leading to rapid decay of catalytic activity and stability.22 In addition, further functionalization of noble metal nanocages needs to be urgently addressed.
It is generally accepted that the core–shell nanostructure with the metal composite embedded in an oxide matrix (e.g., SiO2, TiO2, CeO2, ZrO2) protects the former from agglomerating and getting exposed to the reactants and the surrounding medium.23–27 In addition, the encapsulation also increases the contact area between the metal composite and the oxide matrix and therefore allows for stronger synergistic interactions between them.28 Although it seems attractive that metal-oxide hollow polyhedral structures integrate the features of both a hollow interior and the novel properties arising from the combination of individual constituents, these reports on the synthesis of metal-oxide hetero-structural polyhedral cages are still lacking although there are a few examples of Au–CuO “microcages”29 or Au@SiO2 nanocages.30,31 Therefore, exploration of the controllable synthesis of polyhedral hollow nanostructures of metal-oxide hetero-structured materials is driven by both the synthetic challenges and the multi-functional properties of the products offered by their complex nanostructures.
In this work, we have prepared nano-sized Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages using a Cu2O-templated strategy combined with spatially confined galvanic replacement. The controlled growth process of these hierarchical octahedral architectures is discussed. The produced octahedral Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages possess unique structural features such as large surface area, highly roughened surface topography, enhanced synergistic effects, and decreased aggregation, leading to extremely high activity and stability. Finally, their catalytic performance towards the conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by NaBH4 as a model reaction was also investigated. Interestingly, it was found that the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages show an excellent catalytic ability and are more stable compared to bare Au nanocages, which allows them to be reused over multiple cycles while maintaining their catalytic activity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents and materials
Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 40000) and titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Copper chloride dehydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), gold chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium citrate (C6H5O7Na3·2H2O), glucose (C6H12O6), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and nitric acid (HNO3) were all obtained from Shanghai Lingfeng Chemical Reagent Co. All the chemicals were used as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized (DI) water with a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm.
2.2. Synthesis of Cu2O precursor templates
Cu2O precursor octahedra were synthesized by a modified method as described in Lou's work.32 In a typical procedure, 10 mL of an aqueous solution of NaOH (2 M) was added dropwise into 100 mL of a mixture solution containing CuCl2·2H2O (10 mM), sodium citrate (3.4 mM) and PVP (Mw = 40000, 0.04 g mL−1) under stirring. After 0.5 h, 10 mL of an ascorbic acid solution (0.6 M) was added dropwise into the above solution. The resulting suspension was further aged at 33 °C for 2.5 h to produce Cu2O octahedra with an edge length of 250 nm.
2.3. Synthesis of Cu2O@TiO2 core/shell structure
In a typical procedure, 0.01 g of Cu2O templates was dispersed into 25 mL of de-ionized (DI) water by ultra-sonication, followed by addition of 0.6 mL of an aqueous solution of TiF4 (0.02 M). After thorough mixing, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 1 h. After the reaction, the products were harvested by several rinse-centrifugation cycles with DI water and ethanol for further characterization.
2.4. Synthesis of Au@TiO2 double-shelled structure
In a typical procedure, 10 mg of the produced Cu2O@TiO2 materials were dispersed in H2O containing 1% PVP (Mw = 40000). After 10 min constant stirring, the mixture was heated to 60 °C,20 and 1.5 mL of various concentrations of HAuCl4 solution from 5 mM to 30 mM was added to the stirred solution. The solution turned black at the beginning for a few minutes, suggesting the formation of Cu2O@Au@TiO2 core–shell nanostructure. These Cu2O@Au@TiO2 core–shell particles were then immersed in a 1% PVP (Mw = 40000) and 0.15 M HNO3 solution for 12 h to remove the inner Cu2O core. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum overnight.
2.5. Synthesis of Au nanocages
For the synthesis of Au nanocages, most of the procedure is the same as the procedure for preparing the Au@TiO2 structure except that 10 mg of Cu2O@TiO2 materials were replaced by 10 mg of Cu2O templates. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum overnight.
2.6. Synthesis of Au nanoparticles
Au nanoparticles were synthesized by a similar method to that for the preparation of Au nanocages but without the addition of PVP. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol, and dried under vacuum overnight.
2.7. Measurements and characterizations
The morphology and microstructure of all samples were examined by high-transmission electron microscopy (TEM: JEM-2100, operated at 200 kV) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM: S-4800). X-ray power diffraction (RIGAK, D/MAX 2550 VB/PC, Japan) was used for the crystalline structure. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-vis spectrometer (UNICO UV-2102PC) at 25 °C. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) models were used to determine the specific surface areas, pore volume, and the pore sizes of the samples, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was carried out in a SHIMADZU ICPS-8100.
2.8. Catalytic performance measurement
The catalysis experiments were carried out in a 50 mL long neck quartz cuvette. Typically, a certain amount of the catalyst was dispersed in 10 mL DI water, and 1 mL of the catalyst solution was added into 24 mL of a mixture solution containing 4-nitrophenol (10−4 M) and sodium borohydride (0.3 M) under stirring at room temperature. UV-Vis spectra were recorded every 1 min to monitor the progress of the reaction. Once the reaction was complete, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water. The separated catalyst was then reused to initiate the second cycle of the reaction. The same procedure was performed repeatedly several times. Actually, as the reaction proceeds, one could observe a gradual change of the solution colour from yellow to colourless. The use of an excess of NaBH4 ensures that its concentration remains essentially constant during the reaction, which allows the assumption of pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to the nitro compound.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis strategy of Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages is illustrated in Scheme 1. In the first step, highly uniform Cu2O octahedral crystals were synthesized by reducing a copper-citrate complex solution with ascorbic acid in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).32 Afterwards, a thin TiO2 layer was preferentially deposited onto the Cu2O due to the high activity of Cu2O cores and accelerated hydrolysis of TiF4, as described in Lou's work. Subsequently, the Au@TiO2 nanocage was fabricated by a spatially confined galvanic replacement between the obtained Cu2O@TiO2 and HAuCl4 according to a controllable strategy.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the fabrication of Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages. 

Fig. 1 presents typical SEM and TEM images of the obtained Cu2O and Cu2O@TiO2. The Cu2O shows a uniform octahedral structure with an edge length of ca. 250 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The increased surface roughness of these octahedra compared with that of the original Cu2O crystals indicates the formation of TiO2 shells on the core particles (Fig. 1c, d). By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization, a uniform coating of TiO2 thin layers around the whole surface of Cu2O crystals is clearly evidenced, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. Benefitting from the fast exclusive deposition of TiO2 on Cu2O crystals, the coated particles are as discrete as the original Cu2O crystals even in the absence of stabilizing agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyelectrolytes. The easy formation of Cu2O@TiO2 core/shell structures attributes to the distinct difference in physicochemical stability between n-type TiO2 and p-type Cu2O.32 The TiO2 nanocages were also prepared by completely etching out the Cu2O cores in acidic medium. The thickness of these nanocages is ca. 30 nm (Fig. S1†). In addition, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm curves of the TiO2 nanocages indicate that the sample has a BET surface area of 63 m2 g−1. Pore size distribution (PSD) curves (the inset of Fig. S2†) also demonstrate the existence of mesopores. We believe that such a structural feature brings an additional possibility of interior functionalization by chemical manipulation of the Cu2O cores inside TiO2 shells.

Galvanic replacement is a redox process in which a metal is corroded (sacrificed) by the ions of a second metal when they are in contact in a solution phase.33,34 This simple reaction can be employed to generate a wide variety of metal nanostructures. Due to the much lower redox pair value of Cu2O/Cu2+ (+0.203 V, vs. SHE) than that of a noble metal redox pair, such as AuCl4−/Au (+1.002 V, vs. SHE), PtCl62−/Pt (+0.735 V, vs. SHE) and PdCl42−/Pd (+0.591 V, vs. SHE), the Cu2O crystals can be potentially used as sacrificial templates for the synthesis of hollow noble metal cages.35 The galvanic reaction between Cu2O@TiO2 and metal ions was performed immediately after the solution of HAuCl4 was added into the mixture of Cu2O@TiO2 and PVP.20 The solution color changed from carmine to black after the addition of noble metal precursors, indicating that the Au ions were reduced quickly. After the Cu2O cores were dissolved in HNO3 solution, Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages with octahedral morphologies inherited from the Cu2O templates were obtained. An obvious red shift of the SPR peak from 560 nm to 580 nm can be observed clearly between Au nanocages and Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages because of the large local refractive index of the TiO2 shell encapsulating the Au shell (Fig. S3†), which are similar to those in the previous work.36
The typical structural morphology of the Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages was observed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 2a–c). The product mainly consists of well-defined octahedral cages with edge sizes of 250 nm (Fig. 2a), indicative of a well-assembled structure without phase separation. The morphologies of the Cu2O octahedral-shapes were kept very well after the galvanic reactions. Although the thickness of the TiO2 shell is only nearly 30 nm, some core–shell structure cages which are demonstrated by the partial dissolution induced by interfacial reactions can even be found in our SEM image (Fig. 2b). A closer observation of one cracked nanocage reveals that the cage is composed of abundant nanograins (Fig. S4†). The SEM images of Au nanocages (Fig. S5 and S9†) also show clear nanograins, which are in agreement with the literature.9,35,37 It is considered that these nanograins have joined together to form a solid facet of the Au shell (Fig. S5†). Meanwhile, mesopores or cavities form into the cage wall, which is further demonstrated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm curves (Fig. S6†). The hollow interior and geometrical structure of as-obtained Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages are directly elucidated by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2c. In agreement with the SEM findings, the nanocages show a clear hollow interior and high uniformity. A strong contrast difference among the outer edges (light dark), inner edges (dark) and the center (bright) implies that the octahedral nanocages have two walls whose thicknesses are all around tens of nanometers. The crystal structure of the obtained product was examined by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. S7† presents the XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanostructure. The diffraction peaks at about 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.56°, and 77.5° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311) crystal faces of face-centered cubic Au (JCPDS file: 89-3697). The signal at 69.139° comes from the silicon chip. However, the diffraction peaks of TiO2 are hardly ever observed owing to very low crystallinity of TiO2 NGs,38 which agrees with the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage (Fig. S8†).

(d) EDX spectrum, in which the Cu signal has originated from the copper grid; STEM images (e) and elemental maps (f–i) for mixed, Au, O, Ti, respectively, of the octahedral Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages. 
In addition, we also applied energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray element mapping analysis to further characterize the structure phase and composition of the Au@TiO2 double-shell nanocages. The elemental compositions of the octahedron nanocages were measured by EDX and shown in Fig. 2d, suggesting that the products contain Au, Ti and O elements, with the atomic ratio of Ti to O being approximately 1:2. This is consistent with the EDX mapping analysis, which means that the samples are a hybrid of TiO2 and Au. The signal for copper comes from the copper grid. Fig. 2e–i show representative STEM images of hollow Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedrons and the corresponding Au, Ti, and O elemental maps, from which we can clearly see that the Au hollow nanocages are covered with a shell assembled from TiO2 NGs. These results conclusively show that uniform core–shell Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages were synthesized. The TiO2 shell has nanospaces between the TiO2 NGs enabling access of the reactants to the Au shell, and the mesopores between the Au nanograins also allow the reactants to enter the cavity easily.
To investigate the influence of the concentration of HAuCl4 on the morphological evolution of Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages, the Cu2O@TiO2 core–shell octahedra was titrated with 5, 10, 20 and 30 mM of the solution of HAuCl4 (1.5 mL). The TEM images reveal that small Au nanoparticles inside the TiO2 shell are present at a small proportion of HAuCl4 (Fig. 3a). A clear Au@TiO2 hollow shell was formed with the introduction of more HAuCl4 (Fig. 3b). When the titrated volume of HAuCl4 solution reached 20 mM, the interior of the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages became blacker indicating that the Au shell became thicker (Fig. 3c). On increasing the concentration of HAuCl4 to 30 mM, no intact Au shell was observed, leaving a disordered aggregation of small particles inside the TiO2 shell (Fig. 3d). This result demonstrates that intact Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedra can form at a certain amount of HAuCl4. If excessive HAuCl4 is added into the reaction, the Au shell would collapse. Fig. 3 shows a schematic illustration and electron microscopy images of the nanostructures at different stages. When an aqueous HAuCl4 solution is added into an aqueous suspension of Cu2O nanoparticles, galvanic replacement will be initiated immediately. As a result, Cu+ atoms will be oxidized and dissolved into the solution, generating a small hole on the surface of the nanoparticles. At the same time, the electrons will quickly migrate to the surface of the nanoparticles and be captured by AuCl4− to generate Au atoms via a reduction reaction. The newly formed Au atoms tend to be deposited epitaxially on the surface of the Cu2O nanoparticle. Due to the very small amount of HAuCl4 added into the system, only some Au nanoparticles were present inside the TiO2 shell when the inner Cu2O cores were dissolved by acid. When more HAuCl4 (10 mM and 20 mM) is added, an intact Au shell formed through further dissolution of Cu2O. However, if more HAuCl4 is added into the reaction system, the AuCl4− will cause dealloying for the Au–Cu2O shells by selectively removing Cu2O atoms from the Au–Cu2O shells, thus generating hollow nanocages with bigger holes and causing collapse.33 In this case, the addition of PVP is important when HAuCl4 is added into the solution. The gold shell structure tends to collapse and the final product is composed purely of gold particles without PVP. It is considered that the PVP polymer molecules can absorb on the surface of the gold nanograins and play the role of bridges connecting the adjacent nanograins together, thus keeping the octahedral shape of the gold shells.29

The catalytic activity of the as-prepared Au@TiO2 double-shelled structures was evaluated through the reduction of 4-NP in the presence of an excess amount of NaBH4, which has been widely used as a model reaction for evaluating the catalytic activity of various metal NPs. As observed in Fig. 4a, it is well known that a 4-NP solution exhibits a strong absorption peak at 317 nm which is remarkably red-shifted to 400 nm when treated with an aqueous solution of NaBH4.39–41 The absorption at 400 nm comes from the formation of 4-nitrophenolate ions owing to an increase in solution alkalinity upon the addition of NaBH4.42 It was demonstrated that the reduction reaction did not proceed without catalysts; in the absence of Au@TiO2 catalysts, the peak at 400 nm stayed unchanged for over 100 min (Fig. 4b). To highlight the excellent catalytic activity, we also prepared Au nanocages using an octahedral Cu2O template, which also shows the typical morphologies of octahedral Au nanocages by means of similar reduction processes as Au@TiO2 double-shelled octahedral nanocages (Fig. S9†). Au NPs@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages (Fig. S10†) and Au NPs (Fig. S11†) were synthesized, which are similar to Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages and Au nanocages except for the absence of PVP. To demonstrate the unique properties of the octahedral structure and synergistic effects between the Au and TiO2 shells for improvement of catalytic activities, Au content of all the samples measured by the ICP is consistent in performance measurement (Table S1†). The catalytic activities of the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages, Au nanocages, Au NP@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs catalysts were compared in the reaction of 4-NP reduction (Fig. 4c, d, e, f). After the catalyst was added, the absorption peak at 400 nm gradually dropped in intensity as the reduction reaction proceeded. At the same time, with the production of 4-AP, a new absorption peak started to appear as a shoulder at 300 nm, which indicated the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP.43–45 It is worthwhile to note that the reduction started immediately after the addition of the catalyst and there was no induction time required. This might be advantageous owing to ease of use in real technological applications. The reduction kinetics could be monitored by performing spectroscopic measurements based on the colour changes that were involved in the reaction.46,47 From the UV-visible absorption spectra in Fig. 4c, it took 5 min for Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages to complete the catalytic reaction that exhibited an excellent catalytic performance. For the other catalysts (Fig. 4d, e, f), the reaction times were different from each other. As observed in Fig. 5f, it took 12 min for the Au NPs to completely catalyze the reaction, which demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Au NPs was obviously lower. However, for Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages (Fig. 4e), the reaction time of which was shorter than that of the Au NPs but longer than that of the Au nanocages (Fig. 4d). The reduction rates show that the 4-NP can be completely reduced and all catalysts exhibit catalytic performance. Especially, the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage catalyst shows the best catalytic performance.

(c and d) The catalytic stability tests of Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages and Au nanocages. 
The kinetic analysis of these reactions can be carried out as described from the temporal decay of these peaks. Time-dependences of the absorbance at 400 nm for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol on Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages, Au nanocages, Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs indicate that all the catalysts exhibit catalytic performance and 4-NP can be completely reduced to 4-AP within 12 min (Fig. 5a). The linear relation of ln (Ct/C0) versus reaction time indicates that the reactions followed first order kinetics.48,49 The apparent rate constants (k) were estimated from diffusion-coupled first order reaction kinetics using the slopes of straight lines in Fig. 5b. The rate constant k which was calculated using the rate equation ln (Ct/C0) = kt is 1.35 × 10−2 s−1, 9.5 × 10−3 s−1, 8.03 × 10−3 s−1, and 4.93 × 10−3 s−1 for Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages, Au nanocages, Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs catalysts, respectively. We also calculated the TOFs of various catalysts (Table S1†). The TOFs can reach 870, 621, 483 and 360 h−1 for Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages, Au nanocages, Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs catalysts, respectively. Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages and Au nanocages show better catalytic performance than Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs. The catalytic stability tests of Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages and Au nanocages are shown in Fig. 5c–d. The Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage catalyst could be successfully reused for ten reaction cycles with a conversion efficiency of more than 90%, indicating that the Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage catalyst is stable and efficient. However, Au nanocages display relatively poor stability and reusability. The catalytic activity of Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages remained almost constant after ten cycles and was only a little lower after the tenth cycle (Table S2†). But it should be noted that the k value was still high and reached 1.07 × 10−2 s−1 after the tenth cycle, which confirmed that the catalyst possessed good stability and reusability. The decrease in k value may be attributed to the loss of catalyst arising from separation and purification processes.50
These results suggest that Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages show better catalytic activity and stability than the corresponding Au nanocages, Au NPs@TiO2 nanocages and Au NPs due to their unique structures. First, the interface between the TiO2 NGs and Au nanograins favors the fast diffusion of reactants and products.21,38 Second, the hollow structure of Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage catalysts leads to confinement of the reactants to the inner space, resulting in the higher instantaneous concentration of reactants and products in the nanoreactors, providing a driving force to accelerate the catalytic reaction.28 Third, Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocage catalysts have many corners and edges on which atoms have unsaturated valency with a lower number of bonds around them than those in the interiors or on the faces, largely improving the catalytic activity.49 Fourth, the synergistic effect between the Au nanowall and the TiO2 shells will speed up the rate of charge transfer and effectively inhibit catalyst poisoning, accelerating the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP.36,38 Finally, the TiO2 shell can restrict the Au nanocages from exposing to the reactants and the surrounding medium and protect the Au nanocages, thus improving the catalytic stability.36,38
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized nano-sized Au@TiO2 hollow octahedral hetero-structured nanocages composed of a hollow interior and double porous shells with the Au shell inside and the TiO2 shell outside. The Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages were readily obtained by depositing uniform TiO2 shells on Cu2O octahedra and then using Cu2O as sacrificial templates to form Cu2O@Au@TiO2 core/double-shell structures. Au@TiO2 double-shelled nanocages were fabricated by treating the Cu2O@Au@TiO2 structures in diluted HNO3, involving the process of removal of the Cu2O core. We found that the nanocages show unique structural features such as octahedral shape, porous shells, uniform coating of TiO2 NGs, enhanced synergistic effects and decreased leaching of noble metals, leading to extremely high catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with the apparent rate constants k of 1.35 × 10−2 s−1 and TOF of 870 h−1. The catalytic stability is also superior with the conversion remaining over 90% even after ten cycles of catalytic reaction. Most importantly, this method will open up a new way to synthesize a variety of hybrid metal-oxide hollow nanocages.
