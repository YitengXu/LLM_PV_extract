In this regard, semiconductor-oriented heterogeneous photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis via fuel cell technology are green and sustainable technologies that have been receiving wide attention by the scientific community for tackling these two issues. In addition, in the present scenario, the synthesis of cost-effective and robust catalysts with high stability, corrosion resistance in any medium, and size and morphology oriented in the micro and nanoscale is a hot topic of research. Therefore, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and their composite-based catalysts are extensively used in these fields, replacing previously used noble metals such as Pt, Au, and Ag due to scarcity, instability, and high price. Predominantly, nickel phosphide-based materials among all TMPs have proven to be excellent catalysts regarding these fields of application. The metal–phosphorus bonding, basically the Ni–P bonding present in the catalyst, and its resemblance with the [NiFe] hydrogenase makes it more stable and resistive. Several phases of nickel phosphides are available with different lattice structures. Moreover, according to their metal and phosphorus proportion, they can be divided in two categories as metal-rich nickel phosphides and phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides. With respect to this, their activities are also reflected by their elemental contents; the phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides are excellent in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), whereas metal-rich nickel phosphides are excellent in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution (OER). However, some metal-rich nickel phosphides with high P/Ni ratio, i.e., Ni5P4, show better activity towards HER because of the high P content. The Ni2P phase also plays an active role in both HER and OER, though it belongs to the metal-rich phase. This shows good catalytic behavior towards HER due to presence of well-defined exposed facets and proper proportion of Ni and P atoms. Furthermore, different types of composites are still being developed by modifying their morphology and size through different synthetic strategies with the expectation of more enhanced activity. This review gives an overview of the design and development of nanostructured nickel phosphide-based materials and their recent significant trends in electrocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and photocatalytic water splitting reactions. Moreover, we present the state-of-art various nickel phosphide materials in last five years, which highlight challenges and future prospects involving some critical issues in these emerging fields that await further exploration, and opportunities in the present and future research.Asheli RayMrs Asheli Ray received her Bachelor's degree from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar in the year 2015 and M.Sc. degree in Applied Chemistry from Centurion University, Jatni, Odisha, India in 2018.

1. Introduction
With the rapid industrial development and growth of population, the growing societal trend of energy requirement has become a crucial challenge across the globe. To resolve the problems of energy requirement and fossil fuel depletion, the exploration of eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative renewable energy has become a prudent strategy of young scientists in the 21st century.1 The different sustainable-renewable energy resources comprise of tidal energy, solar energy, nuclear energy, wind energy, and wave power, and fundamentally these energies are prerequisite for the production of an ideal energy. Though renewable energy is plenty yet its sources are intermittent and unpredictable; thus, efficient technological advancements have been researched and it has been concluded that these plentiful energies must be stored for reuse later.2 As a component of the world's clean energy strategy, obtaining molecular H2 and O2 gases from water splitting has been considered as an ideal, green, and sustainable energy technology. Water splitting is a clean and efficient route to produce molecular hydrogen (H2) by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting, with the advantage that water is treated as the starting material with no emission of greenhouse or other pollutant gases such as carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuels.3 Moreover, this technology has a great conversion efficiency, low environmental damage, and great potential for large-scale application.4 H2 produced by this is considered as a carbon neutral fuel and has a high fuel efficiency and the highest gravimetric energy density; thus, it is one that is extensively used in chemical industries for manufacturing various chemicals such as NH3 and hydrogenated petrol, and also releases energy by regenerating water.5–7 Thus, this technology with green and sustainable energy strategy has attracted much attention and extensive research in the present era. The water splitting reaction is a thermodynamically uphill process and requires high energy output. Thus, specific energy such as electrical, electromagnetic, or thermal energy is often given to water to cleave the highly energetic H–OH bond. Electrochemical water splitting requires only electrical energy and water as the solo input and can generate a considerable amount of H2 and O2.8 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the separate or combined processes where H2 and O2 gas are evolved from their respective electrodes, i.e., the cathodic compartment produces H2 and the anodic compartment produces O2 in electrochemical water splitting.4 Nowadays, it is viewed as an efficient and scalable approach for the generation of H2 fuel.
Further, the photocatalytic route or light-driven water splitting for the production of molecular H2 and O2 using a photocatalyst has tremendous potential for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. When an appropriate band structure semiconductor is suspended in water and placed under light illumination, electrons in the material that are transferred to the conduction band can reduce protons to produce H2, whereas the holes produced in the valence band can oxidize water to generate oxygen gas.9 Since solar energy is considered as the largest renewable energy resource, a lot of interest has been given to the coupling of electrochemical water splitting with solar light. Thus, the next discussion on energy conversion, i.e., photoelectrochemical water splitting, has been long considered as the “holy grail” of solar energy conversion and storage. The stoichiometric decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2 is found to occur successfully with/without the application of an external bias voltage of <1.23 V.10,11
To accomplish all these processes, young researchers of the present era are avidly researching efficient electrocatalysts, photoelectrocatalysts, or co-catalysts, which are mandatory to carry out the process successfully. In particular, the basic requirements of a good electrocatalyst for conducting an electrochemical reaction so as to acquire the best results can be listed as follows: the electrocatalyst should have proper (i) electrical conductivity, (ii) surface area, (iii) hydrogen adsorption ability, and (iv) stability.12 Moreover, an efficient photocatalytic semiconductor mainly depends upon three factors such as (i) light absorption capability, (ii) separation and migration of the photogenerated charges, and (iii) surface reduction and oxidation reactions.7 To fulfill the above mentioned criteria, various noble metals such as Au, Pt, and Pd have been extensively used in HER and photocatalytic applications, whereas Ru/Ir-based compounds such as RuO2 and IrO2 have been utilized in OER. However, the scarcity, high price, and instability of these materials in the acidic medium oppressively limit their large-scale application. Thus, it is required to develop a catalyst made up of earth-abundant elements and non-noble metals with low price, and high stability and efficiency.
During the past few decades, several non-noble-metals have been introduced but first row transition metals (TM) such as Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu and their compounds are well recognized. Among these TM-based materials, oxygen family-based TMs such as transition metal oxides (TMOs), transition metal sulfides (TMSs), transition metal selenides (TMSes), transition metal tellurides (TMTes), and layer double hydroxides (LDHs) have revealed their best activities in these fields. To date, NiFe–LDH,13 NiFe1−xSe2,14 and CoCr2O4/CNT15 have shown outstanding results in alkaline OER, whereas NiCo2O4 nanosheets,16 Fe17.5%Ni3S2/NF,17 N–SiSe2,18 and Co1.11Te2/C19 have shown best results in HER. However, these oxygen family-based TMs possess some drawbacks such as corrosion and instability. Furthermore, researchers have tried to develop more stable catalysts from transition metal-based carbides, borides, and nitrides. For example, Mo2C/G3-NCS750,20 Co–B/Ni,21 and Ni3N/Ni22 have shown appreciable performances towards HER. More recently, transition metal-based phosphides (TMPs), being cost-effective and corrosion resistance due to their excellent intrinsic properties, have shown superior activity compared to other TM-based materials. For the first time, TMPs were reported by Bertrand Pelletier et al. in 1792 but unfortunately remained suppressed for nearly two hundred years (till the 1960s); later in time, their applications were gradually extended to the field of metallurgy, hydroprocessing (HPC), photocatalytic degradation, lithium-ion batteries, pesticides, etc.3,23 Thereafter, Nozaki and his coworkers first discovered the hydrotreating activities of TMPs and became renowned in the fields of hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodesulfurization (HDS), and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO).24 Later, TMPs were found to have remarkable activity in the areas of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),25,26 oxygen evolution reaction (OER),26 full water splitting,27 and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Primarily, the blending of metallic or semi-metallic elements with phosphorus in various compositions yields transition metal phosphides having the general formula MxPy. With respect to the metal and phosphorus ratio, TMPs are often classified as metal-rich/stoichiometric metal phosphides (x ≥ y) and phosphorus-rich metal phosphides. The crystal structure as well as the bonding between the constituent elements is very diverse and solely depends upon the composition and the element present, where the phosphorus content is an important factor that determines the stability. In metal-rich TMPs, the delocalized electron cloud confirms the presence of the metallic bond (M–M) and due to this metal–metal bond, some TMPs are metallic/superconducting. For example, TMPs such as GaP and InP are well known semiconductors, whereas TiP, Fe2P, and CoP show metallic behavior because of the distinct metallic bond; some TMPs show super conducting behavior such as Mo3P, W3P, and Ni3P. Also, partial ionic contribution arises from partial electron transfer over the covalent bond (Mδ+–Pδ−), which adds stability to the TMPs. Due to this strong metal to phosphorus bond, metal-rich TMPs are thermally stable and can tolerate chemical attack as well as oxidation.28,29 In particular, for water splitting applications, these are quite stable in dilute acids and bases; some are impervious even to strong acids and alkaline medium. However, most of the metal-rich phosphides exhibit moderate stability in acidic environments due to the high metal content on the particle surface. Remarkably, in comparison to metal-rich phosphides, phosphorus-rich TMPs contain P–P bonded moieties as phosphorus is able to form different clusters and oligomers with itself. For example, NiP2 and SiP2 exhibit pyrite-type structures where P–P dimmers are present. Thus, these polyphosphides show different characteristic properties such as higher reactivity and lower thermal stability, in comparison to their corresponding metal-rich phosphides or stoichiometric counterparts. Consequently, many P-rich TMPs are thermally unstable and disproportionate into metal-rich phases and elemental phosphorus at high temperature. However, the presence of P–P bonding acts as an envelope and binds excess Mn+. Thus, the chemical stability of phosphorus-rich TMPs is more in highly acidic and basic conditions in comparison to metal–TMPs. Thus, in conclusion, metal–TMPs are thermally more stable, whereas phosphorus-TMPs are chemically more inert and reactive.3,28,29 In addition, a novel approach for synthesizing the TMP series is by pyrolyzing phytic acid (PA)-cross-linked metal complexes and also introducing oxygen atoms into the TMPs. This amplifies their intrinsic conductivities, facilitates electron transfer, and activates the active sites by elongating the M–P bonds, resulting in excellent full water splitting.27
Among various TMPs, nickel phosphide has been extensively studied and it has been reported that it has the ability for efficient water splitting. It exists in different phases such as metal-rich nickel phosphides (Ni2P, Ni12P5, Ni3P, Ni7P3, Ni5P4) and phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides (NiP2, NiP3). Phosphorus-rich nickel phosphides or metal-rich nickel phosphides with higher P/Ni ratio (Ni5P4) and their composites have proved to be good catalysts for HER and photocatalytic water splitting applications,30,31 whereas, metal-rich nickel phosphides with low P/Ni content and their composites have shown superior activity towards OER.32,33 Some exceptions have been seen in case of the Ni2P phase. This phase plays a role in both HER and OER, though it belongs to the metal-rich phase. The good catalytic behavior towards HER is due to presence of well-defined exposed facets and proper proportion of Ni and P atoms. According to solid state chemistry, different phases of nickel phosphide retain different crystallographic lattice structures. For example, Ni12P5 and Ni3P possess a tetragonal structure, whereas Ni5P4, Ni5P2, Ni2.55P, and Ni2P possess a hexagonal structure. Ni7P3 and Ni3P have a cubic structure, whereas Ni8P3, NiP, and NiP2 retain rhombohedral, orthorhombic, and monoclinic structures, respectively.34 Moreover, to discuss the chemical bonding and stability of different phases of nickel phosphides, Laurence et al. studied the heat of formation per atom of the seven phases of nickel phosphides such as Ni3P, Ni5P2, Ni12P5, Ni2P, NiP2, and NiP3. They observed that the stability nearly remained constant as the P content increases from Ni3P, Ni5P2, Ni12P5 to Ni2P, then dropped at P/Ni = 4:5, and dropped further above P/Ni = 2:1 in NiP2 and Ni3P (Fig. 1a). They also calculated the electron delocalization function (ELF) by DFT to study different types of bonding. They found that the metal-rich NiP are more stable because they possess the metallic bond as well as the partial Ni–P ionic bond; however, the stability of phosphorus rich-NiP (NiP2) decreases by about 22% in comparison to that of Ni2P because the stable Ni–Ni metallic bond and ionic bond is replaced by the less stable P–P bond, which decreases the overall negative enthalpy of formation. Hence, Ni rich-NiP is more corrosion resistant in air than its phosphorus-rich counter parts, which indicates the correlation between enthalpy of formation and corrosion stability (Fig. 1b and c).29

In 2005, Liu and Rodriguez discovered for the first time through density functional theory (DFT) calculation that Ni2P exhibits hydrogen evolution properties as that of [NiFe] hydrogenase. They found that the 001 plane of Ni2P has higher thermostability and comparable HER activity compared to hydrogenase.35 In order to understand the exceptional characteristics, different groups further studied the theoretical aspects of Ni2P.36–39 It was found that the alternating planes of Ni3P and Ni3P2 reconstructions are located along the (0001) direction of bulk Ni2P, where Ni3P2 terminations with less surface energy make the bulk Ni2P (0001) more stable and catalytically active. However, the STEM analysis simply contradicted the above outcome. Further, through the dynamic low-energy electron diffraction analysis, it was revealed that non-stoichiometric additional P adatoms resting on the Ni3 hollow sites at the Ni3P2 layers cover 80% of the surface, resulting in an increased stability rather than that only by the Ni3P2 layer. Beyond this, some other phases such as Ni5P4 (ref. 30 and 37) (metal-rich with more P/Ni ratio) have shown the highest catalytic activity and stability due to their exceptional structure. The most energetically favorable surfaces of Ni5P4 are observed to be the Ni3P3 and Ni4P3 bulk-derived terminations with P-adatoms. Waxler et al. found that both the P3 site (not present in Ni2P(0001)) and the Ni3 site strongly bind excess P. Hence, some stable Pn (n = 2, 4) agglomerates are formed on Ni5P4 at the P3-hollow sites. In addition, for (000) Ni5P4, the Ni4P3 terminations with P adatoms are the most stable. Hence, along the axis of (0001) and (000) of Ni5P4, P clusters, otherwise known as agglomerates sets, are present; this phase, apart from Ni2P(0001), makes the former phase more stable and catalytically active. Apart from that, considering the chemical potential value of Ni and P (ΔμNi & ΔμP), bulk Ni2P and Ni5P4 are stable as compared to other nickel phosphide compositions (Fig. 1d).40 Another exception was observed by Laursen et al. by carrying out the surface modification of hollow Ni-sites in metal-rich nickel phosphide Ni3P (001) that are also active for HER as, such as Ni2P and Ni5P4, both in acidic and basic medium. DFT calculations further revealed that the reconstruction of the Ni3P(001) surface strongly favors P enrichment of the Ni4P4 termination and is found to be the most stable surface termination at intermediate P content, and also provides the most active surface sites at low overpotentials.29 On the other hand, Ni12P5 (ref. 32) and Ni2P-based composites33,38 show best activities in the field of OER due to the greater metal content in the composition, which supports the formation of the M–O and M–O–O bonds, thus driving the production of molecular oxygen to a greater extent. Similarly, nickel phosphide has been widely used as a co-catalyst incorporated in various photocatalysts or composites due to its very low bandgap (nearly 1 eV) in order to enhance the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. For example, Ni2P/CdS NR39 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity due to its size and morphology (as a one-dimensional structured material) as it possesses more surface area to conduct enough surface reactions. Thus, in more than ten years, along with neat materials, different kinds of nickel phosphide-based composites, hybrid, or heterostructured materials with different cation- or anion-doping have been developed. Furthermore, the variation in the size and morphology with different types of nickel phosphide phases in the composites can be obtained by varying the solvent, time, and temperature or the quantity and concentration of different synthetic components such as Ni sources and the Ni:P ratio. In this review, we mainly focus on the current progress in nickel phosphides and their hybrid materials as electrocatalysts, photocatalysts, or photoelectrocatalysts in their respective fields of application for overall water splitting.
2. Synthesis of nickel phosphide
For synthesizing nanostructured nickel phosphide-based hybrid materials, different synthetic routes such as wet chemical and solid gas route have been adopted to date to obtain various phase and morphological NixPy. The morphology and phase of nickel phosphide mainly depend on the reaction time, temperature, reagents, and template support. Here, in this segment, we have emphasized on the phase- and morphology-dependent synthetic routes of various NixPy materials and their composites, as shown in Scheme 1.

2.1. Wet chemistry methods

2.1.1 Thermal decomposition. 
The wet chemical method has proven to be the most efficient method to synthesize phase, size, and morphology-oriented nanostructured nickel phosphides, which is based on the thermal decomposition of precursors in the liquid phases. The method has been identified to be the most proficient method for the synthesis of nickel phosphide nanoparticles, from metal-rich to phosphorus rich nanoparticles such as Ni2P,41,42 Ni12P5,43 Ni5P4,44 NiP2,45 and Ni7P3.46 The main reaction in the wet chemical method involves the reaction of metal salts or metallic Ni with the organic phosphorus source in a hot organic solvent under an inert atmosphere.42,47 Nickel acetylacetonate [Ni(acac)2] is commonly used as a nickel–metal precursor in many reported synthesis.42,45,48,49 However, some other nickel sources include nickel acetate [Ni(OAc)2·4H2O]41,49–51 and bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)-nickel(0)[Ni(COD)2].47,49 Brock et al. had reported that different Ni precursors have a different Ni release rate, which affects the Ni concentration and hence, nickel phosphides of different phases and morphology can be obtained.49 Organophosphorus sources such as tri-octylphosphine (TOP),41–43,51 tri-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO),47,51 and their analogous sources TPP43,44,50 and TBP43 have been extensively used as phosphorus precursors for solution-phase synthesis. In fact, compared with the expensive TOP, low-cost TPP is being widely exploited to serve as a reactive surfactant as well as a P source in many of the recent works of literature. Zheng et al. used TPP instead of TOP and found that large-sized Ni nanoparticles (NPs) were formed, which were then further converted to a bigger void in the Ni2P nanoparticles under the influence of TPP that serves as a reactive surfactant for enlarging the void size via the Kirkendall effect.44
2.1.1.1. Phase, size, and morphology variation in NixPy synthesis. 
Initially, nickel phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared via various processes by taking nickel acetylacetonate and TOP as the precursors, which form the Ni(acac)2–TOP complex solution; this solution was injected into a hot organic solvent, which gave rise to hollow monodisperse nickel phosphide nanoparticles. Later, in another way, the Ni precursor was dispersed in a hot organic solvent in an inert atmosphere to form Ni–oleylamine or the Ni–TOPO complex, and then, upon further heating after the addition of P sources to the hot Ni complex solution, nickel phosphide was formed.42,43,52 In these two procedures, size variation in the Ni2P particles was observed. Finally, they deduced the mechanism that in most of the cases, first the Ni(acac)2–TOP complex solution is formed, which upon heating in the presence of a hot organic solvent gives the Ni metal nanoparticles. These Ni metal nanoparticles upon further heating in the presence of TOP yield nickel phosphide. TOP acts as the P source as well as a complexing agent, which produces phosphorus after decomposition, appears to diffuse into the Ni metal nanoparticles at a slower rate, and forms hollow nickel phosphides based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect (Fig. 2a and b).42,45 Later, different types of solvents such as octyl ether,42 TOPO,43,51–53 oleylamine,41,43,44,50,54 hexadecylamine,41 tri-octylamine (TOA),55 and 1-octadecene41,43,46,56 were actively researched and it was found that these solvents also have an impact on the morphology as well as the phase pure synthesis. A high OAm/TOP ratio favors the formation of metal-rich nickel phosphides with low P/Ni ratio (Ni2P, Ni12P5, and Ni3P), whereas nickel phosphides with more P/Ni ratio (Ni5P4, NiP2) are effectively produced at the lower OAm/TOP ratio. Thus, oleylamine concentration plays an important role as a reducing agent, which reduces Ni2+ to Ni0,43 limits phosphorus inclusion by replacing the phosphine ligands from the Ni NPs surface, and creates a less reactive P, which results in the formation of metal-rich phases such as Ni12P5 even under conditions favorable for the formation of Ni2P NPs.

Oleylamine also plays an active role in reducing the void size in Ni12P5, which results in the conversion of hollow nanoparticles to solid nanoparticles.57 Colloidal NPs are frequently protected by a layer of surfactants that are stabilized beforehand by an organic solvent. Thus, the reactivity of the nanoparticles can be determined by different types of surfactants used in the synthetic processes. Long-chain amines are responsible for the successive synthesis of hollow Ni2P and hence determine the size of the hollow NPs. On replacing oleylamine with hexadecyl amine, similar results were observed.41
Morphological variation also depends upon the solvents used in the reaction medium. When oleic acid was used as the solvent, a solid nanorod structured Ni2P was formed. Moreover, when TOPO was used as the surfactant in the same reaction, solid spherical Ni2P was obtained.41 In addition, Jongnam Park et al. concluded that the development of 1-D nanorods was caused by the cooperative effects formed due to the different binding capacities of the two surfactants (TOP and oleylamine) and the intrinsically anisotropic crystal structure of the hexagonal closed packed Ni2P, as shown in Fig. 2c.53 In the past, no reports have been reported in support of the formation of hollow NPs under the influence of TOP; rather, TOP had been used as a P source and a complexing agent forming the metal–TOP precursor or has been used as a solvent. But, in the 21st century, Chiang et al. found that the TOP concentration is also a chief factor in the synthesis of hollow NPs and the reaction temperature also has a noteworthy effect on the TOP function. Thus, direct heating of the reaction mixture to 250 °C for 3 h resulted in the development of hollow Ni2P NPs. Finally, he concluded that the solid-state reaction occurs only by the collective control of the stability of the template NP, role of TOP concentration, and reaction temperature.41
It was further observed that at a lower TOP concentration, the Ni NPs are stabilized by a proper capping agent, where it is essential to avoid TOP dissolution. Keeping this information in mind, Chiang et al. decided to develop a one-pot reaction method. In this synthetic method, the Ni precursor, along with the solvent, surfactant, and P source, was taken at a time in one pot and the solution was heated in an inert atmosphere.41 However, it was observed low P/Ni ratio (less than 2.24) favors Ni0 NPs, whereas, a high ratio (more than 2.24) favors amorphous NixPy particles as the intermediate state, which, at last upon heating, produces crystalline nickel phosphide. They also observed that rapid heating gave rise to NiP clusters as the intermediate instead of Ni metal, which subsequently yield NiP.43,49 In due course of time, Yuan et al. extensively studied one-pot reactions and found that the Ni metal ion was reduced to Ni nanoclusters in the presence of OAm. TOP, as a strong ligand, adsorbed on Ni NP to form the Ni–TOP complex, in which, on heating at elevated temperature, the P–C bond of TOP breaks to form the phosphorus atom, which diffuses into the Ni nanoclusters to form hollow nickel phosphide nanoparticles via the Kirkendall pathway; the P/Ni ratio affects the conversion of the hollow to the solid nickel phosphide nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 2d.45 Further, Keigo et al. proved that at the elementary step, metal-rich phosphide with more phosphorus content phase, i.e., Ni5P4, was formed. When the TOP concentration was increased by increasing the crystallization time or changing the coordinating solvent (TOPO) to a non-coordinating solvent such as DCS [CH3(CH2)20CH3] by using hydrating precursors (Ni(acac)2·2H2O, Ni(Ac)2·4H2O) with increasing reaction time, a phosphorus-rich NiP2 phase was obtained.51 Huiming Li et al. and Brock et al. reported that low P/Ni ratio, shorter time, and lower reaction temperature favor the formation of metal-rich nickel phosphides such as Ni12P5 nanoparticles. However, phosphorus-rich phosphides such as NiP2 nanoparticles are formed at higher P/Ni ratio with longer time and reaction temperature. Hence, they deduced that by controlling the P/Ni ratio, temperature, and reaction time, nickel phosphide nanoparticles of different phases, morphologies, and sizes can be formed by the wet chemical synthesis method.48,49,57 Comparing the injection and one-pot reaction methods, the former is more convenient because the injection method is restricted to a particular delivering rate, which is responsible for the growth of morphologically oriented nickel phosphide nanoparticles.55 Generally, the wet chemical reaction involves expensive Ni as well as P sources; however, in 2015, for the first time, Yuan Pan et al. and Susan E. Habas et al. mutually developed an efficient route for the synthesis of nickel phosphide nanocrystals from a single-source precursor, i.e., BTND [bis(triphenylphosphine) nickel dichloride], and commercially available and air-stable metal–PPh3 complex, i.e., Ni(PPh3)2(CO)2, respectively. Thus, to overcome the price and instability of TOP, the strategy to use a single-source precursor compound was developed where both the Ni and P sources coexist.58,59
Detailed studies on the synthetic conditions for the fabrication of various nickel phosphides with different phases, sizes, and morphologies by thermal decomposition method are summarized in Table 1. From the table, it is concluded that the solvent (mainly OAm) has the main role in controlling the phase and void size of nickel phosphide. In addition, some other factors such as the Ni and P precursors used, (P/Ni) ratio, reaction temperature, and time are also key factors in the synthesis of phase pure nickel phosphides with a particular size and morphology.

2.1.2. Hydrothermal or solvothermal. 
Furthermore, the wet chemical synthetic process also includes hydrothermal or solvothermal method, which controls the morphology of nickel phosphides. In these methods, mostly inorganic salts such as NiCl2,60 NiCl2·6H2O,61–66 NiSO4·xH2O,67,68 NiNO3·6H2O,69,70 and Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O71 have been used as the nickel precursor and inorganic phosphorus such as red P,61,63,64,69–71 white P,60,66,67 and yellow P65,68 have been used as phosphorus precursors. These precursors are cost-effective and easily available. However, inorganic phosphorus is highly reactive and explosive in nature.
2.1.2.1. Phase, size, and morphology variation in NixPy synthesis. 
According to many reported synthetic processes, mainly the P/Ni ratio, solvent choice, and reaction conditions play important roles in phase transition and pure phase formation. These methods possess many merits, such as the production of a large number of nanomaterials at a relatively low cost and yield highly crystalline nanocrystals (NCs) with well-controlled dimensions. The best part of this reaction is that high temperature and high pressure support the formation of supercritical water, which is an excellent condition for the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts. For example, Yonghong et al. synthesized two phases of nickel phosphide (Ni2P and Ni12P5) via hydrothermal method using NiCl2·6H2O and red phosphorus as the nickel and phosphorus sources, respectively, in the presence of acrylamine (AM), which was used as a phase-controlling reagent. They observed that at high-temperature, pure Ni2P was formed,61 whereas Bo Wang et al. used the same precursor materials and described a variation in the same phases (Ni12P5 and Ni2P); they also studied the size variation of the nanoparticles on the addition of KOH solution and on increasing the pH values.62 Furthermore, Jie Chang et al. for the first time introduced a new ligand, myristic acid; on its addition to the same starting material as reported above, pure Ni12P5, pure Ni2P and a mixture of both was obtained just by varying the temperature.63 Moreover, an increase in the P/Ni ratio favors the formation of Ni2P, whereas an increase in time and temperature favors Ni12P5 formation.64,69 Discussing the different morphologies of nickel phosphide, S. Liu et al. synthesized dendrite-shaped Ni2P microstructure via EDTA-mediated hydrothermal route using NiSO4·7H2O and white phosphorus as the starting materials, where the temperature and EDTA played an important role in the dendrite structure formation.67
In some other cases, with water, some specific solvents are used in the reaction medium, which play a vital role in structural modification. Citing an example, Shuling Liu et al. synthesized Ni2P nanocrystals with dendritic morphology by using nickel sulfate (NiSO4·6H2O) and yellow phosphorus in a solution mixture of glycol and water maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. Here, in this process, the Ostwald ripening mechanism, reaction temperature, and glycol to water volume ratio played chief roles in the growth of the dendrite-like structure of Ni2P.65 Pure phase hollow Ni2P structure was developed with high yield through a one-step template-free surfactant-assisted solvothermal method, where SDBS (sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate) and urea were used as the surfactant and the pH regulator, respectively.68 Different phases of nickel phosphide can be prepared by this process just by adjusting the water and ethanol volume ratio.66 An urchin-like hollow superstructure was developed by Jieding Wei et al. by reacting Ni microspheres with white phosphorus, in which Ni@NixPy was formed initially, and thereafter, Ni2P to Ni12P5 conversion occurred on prolonging the reaction time.60 The details of the studies describing various synthetic levers that enable independent control of phase, size, and morphology in nickel phosphides prepared by hydrothermal/solvothermal method are summarized in Table 2.

2.2. Solid–gas method
The solid–gas method is more convenient than the wet chemical synthesis method; however, although the well-defined nanostructure of nickel phosphides is formed in the solution phase reaction, there are still some limitations such as the use of high-cost precursors, solvents, and surfactants. In addition, TOP is insoluble in water and the reaction in an organic solvent having a high boiling point is inflammable and corrosive. Solid–gas synthesis is a surfactant-free and low-temperature phosphidation process where sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2)72–74 and ammonium hypophosphite (NH4H2PO2)75 are mostly used as phosphorus precursors that are decomposed to form PH3 gas and react with Ni-based precursors (including metal salts such as Ni(NO3)2·6H2O,76 NiCl2·6H2O,69 nickel oxides,77 nickel hydroxide,74,78 metal–organic framework (MOFs),79,80 or Ni foam73,81) to form nickel phosphide in a static atmosphere. In the entire process, the precursors are kept separately in two porcelain boats with the phosphorus source placed upstream of the tubular furnace, as shown in Fig. 3a.

2.2.1. Phase, size, and morphology variation in NixPy synthesis. 
Guojun Shi and Jianyi Shen had first revealed the solid-phase reaction between cationic nickel and hypophosphite by heating a precursor mixture (nickel hypophosphite and ammonium hypophosphite) with the Ni2+ to H2PO2− molar ratio of 3 at 473 K under N2 atmosphere to produce pure phase Ni2P, wherein the temperature and the Ni2+/H2PO2− molar ratio played the main role in pure phase formation.75 Qingxin Guan et al. had also synthesized bulk Ni2P, which is used as a support co-catalyst, by using nickel chloride and NaH2PO2 as the nickel and phosphorus sources, respectively, followed by phosphidation at 300 °C for 30 min.72 Later, a unique morphology of nickel phosphide was developed by Lihuang Jin et al., i.e., porous hollow nanospheres (PHNs) of Ni3P. Here, firstly the prepared Ni–P nanoparticles (NPs) were annealed at different temperatures in the range of 300–600 °C to produce Ni–Ni3P, which was followed by acidic etching to selectively remove nickel and to produce the pure Ni3P phase.82 Ungyu Paik and his coworkers used template-assisted Ni-based MOF to produce a carbon-coated porous nanoplate structure mixed-phase nickel phosphide, containing Ni2P and Ni5P4 phases with Ni2P as the major product. They used Ni(H2O)2[Ni(CN)4]PBA {Ni–Ni PBA} as a template and carried out the low temperature phosphidation reaction, which showed the best catalytic activity towards OER and HER separately with long-term stability both in acidic and alkaline medium.79 3D self-supported biphasic nickel phosphide (Ni5P4–Ni2P) nanosheets array were developed by phosphidizing Ni foam with red phosphorus, followed by heating at different temperatures, with an optimal temperature of 500 °C for retaining the phase and nanosheet array-like structure. This compound phase structure was developed due to the topotactic redox reaction between the electropositive Ni metal and electronegative P.83
A hierarchically porous urchin-like superstructure Ni2P supported on Ni foam (Ni2P/Ni/NF) was composed by Yujie Sun and his coworker by applying template-free electrodeposition of porous Ni microsphere on Ni foam, followed by low-temperature phosphidation in the presence of NaH2PO2.73 Later, different crystalline Ni2P and Ni5P4 nickel phosphide flower-like microballs composed of self-assembled nanoplates were directly grown on the Ti foil surface using a facile precursor {Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O}, followed by the phosphidation process (Fig. 3b). During the phosphidation process, Ni2P or Ni5P4 was formed at different phosphorization temperatures of 300 or 370 °C, respectively, where the Ni5P4 flower-like microballs exhibited excellent catalytic activity.37 Furthermore, by changing the different nickel source, the phases of nickel phosphide could be changed. For example, Ruiqi Zhou et al. had prepared nickel phosphide by the phosphidation of the as-prepared β-Ni(OH)2 precursor. By using various nickel sources such as nickel chloride, nitrate, or sulphate with different molarity of NaOH, β-Ni(OH)2 precursor was synthesized, which, upon phosphidation, gave different phases such as Ni5P4, Ni2P, and Ni12P5. It was also observed that electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance of the β-Ni(OH)2 precursor plays an important role in the formation of the three phases of Ni–P based NCs with different Ni:P ratios.74 However, the drawbacks of this process are that a high temperature is needed to decompose the hypophosphites and the conventional method of mechanical blending or stirring of the suspension solvent causes irregular distribution in the loading of the co-catalyst and particle shedding in the course of catalytic reactions.84 A summary of the synthetic conditions with varied phases, sizes, and morphology of nickel phosphides prepared by the solid gas-method are listed in Table 3.

Besides the phosphidation process, the hydrogen reduction reaction also falls into the solid–gas reaction. In this process, H2 gas is used to reduce the metal-based ammonium phosphate such as NH4NiPO4·H2O85 directly or with a mixture of Ni sources and phosphates86 at high temperature in a static atmosphere. Apart from, wet chemical and solid–gas methods, some more methods have also been used to prepare nickel phosphide nanoparticles such as cyclic voltammetric or pulse deposition method,87,88 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),31,78,89 pulse discharge method,90 microwave-assisted methods,81,91 photochemical synthesis under UV-light illumination,92 and plasma synthesis method.93

2.3. Composites of nickel phosphide
Nickel phosphide itself can be used as a catalyst but due to its narrow bandgap, it is generally used as a co-catalyst in photocatalysis for electron trapping from its surface to prevent the further recombination of electron–hole pairs. In some other cases, it is also used to make heterojunctions,84,94,95 bimetallic composites,96,97 or simple composite98,99 with other materials for enhancing the photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic activities. The overall synthetic process mainly comprises of two types of processes, namely, ex situ and in situ.

2.3.1. 
            In situ synthesis. 
This process mainly involves one-pot synthesis. In these cases, the precursors are prepared via the hydrothermal route and then undergo phosphidation to obtain the composite or hybrid materials.100–102 Likewise, some other composites are synthesized via cation displacement reaction followed by phosphidation,103 pyrolysis followed by phosphidation,104 as well as coprecipitation followed by electrostatic self-assembly and phosphorization.105 For the first time, Yuming Dong et al. developed NixP/g-C3N4 through the photochemical deposition method.92 In most of the cases, different nickel phosphide-based composites supported on various substrates have been synthesized via hydrothermal or solvothermal method, followed by the phosphidation method. At first, the nickel precursor along with other metal precursors (for doped nickel phosphide) and/or structure-directing agents is taken in the hydrothermal container. In some cases, substrates such as Ni foam or some other metal foil/mesh with carbonaceous substrate are also taken in the precursor solution so that the corresponding nickel (metal) hydroxides can be developed on it. Then, this nickel hydroxide-substrate/nickel hydroxide is phosphidized in an argon/nitrogen atmosphere to yield the desired nickel phosphide-based materials. Fu et al. developed Co1−xNixP3 supported on carbon cloth via the hydrothermal route, followed by high-temperature phosphidation. For example, Co1−xNix(OH)F nanoneedle array-like structure was grown on CC via the hydrothermal method, which was then converted to Co1−xNixP3/CC through phosphidation, as shown in Fig. 3d.76 MOF-derived nickel, along with other metal precursors, is synthesized by the hydrothermal method, followed by phosphidation to develop morphology- and structure-oriented composites. For example, iron and oxygen co-doped MOF-derived nickel phosphide {(Fe0.1Ni0.9)2P(O)/NF} was also synthesized by hydrothermally phosphating the prepared Fe0.1Ni0.9MOF/NF precursor.106 Furthermore, MOF-derived bimetallic phosphides such as Ni2P–Co2P@C/NF,107 M16-ZIF-67-CNT-P,108 NiCoP,109 and Ni2P/ZnP2 (ref. 110) were prepared via the in situ synthesis method by using ZIF-67, M16-ZIF-67, NiCo–BDC, and NiZn–BDC MOF as the precursors, respectively. The Ni2P/C@NF composite was also prepared by the phosphidation of Ni/C@NF, which was formed by the annealing of the hydrothermally prepared NF@Ni–BDC precursor.111
So far, numerous mesoporous Ni2P materials have been synthesized via the in situ route for better enhancement of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting because these mesoporous structures provide multiple channels for electron/ion transfer.112 For example, 3D mesoporous (FexNi1−x)2P nanosheets on NF,101 mesoporous Ni2P–MoP2 nanorod array on 3D NF,112 and mesoporous NiCoP NSs on the MXene substrate113 were synthesized by the phosphidation of the corresponding in situ prepared FeNi–OH, NiMoO4 NRs/3D NF, and Ti3C2@Ni–Co precursors, respectively.


2.3.2. 
            Ex situ synthesis. 
In this process, neat materials are prepared separately and then undergo composite formation. For example, in the preparation of the Ni12P5/g-C3N4 composite, initially, Ni12P5 and g-C3N4 were prepared separately and mixed properly by physical grinding, followed by calcination.114 Likewise, the Ni2P/CdS composite was synthesized by the wet chemical method. In this case, CdS and Ni2P were prepared by coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods separately, which were finally subjected to the wet chemical method in order to form the composite.115 Some other composites such as Ni2P/CaIn2S4 (ref. 116) and MoO3/Ni2P99 have also been synthesized. Moreover, MOF-derived bimetallic phosphides such as Fe–Ni–P/C can be prepared via this method by using the BMM-10 MOF.117

3. Application of nickel phosphide-based materials
3.1. Water electrolysis
Electrolysis of water is a promising approach to split up water into H2 and O2 gases with high purity. Basically, the catalytic electrolysis system consists of two redox catalysts for achieving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). During this operation, the best HER and OER catalyst is expected to achieve high current densities at low overpotential with outstanding durability.118 According to the basic theory of water splitting, the potential required to initiate water electrolysis is 1.23 V vs. NHE (ΔG0 = 237.2 kJ mol−1); however, a much larger cell voltage (from 1.8 to 2.0 V) than the theoretical value is needed in case of commercial electrolyzers.119,120 Thus, electrocatalysts that behave actively for HER and OER are extremely required, which can reduce the overpotential of water splitting in the presence of a commercial electrolyzer, which consequently makes the process energy-efficient.

3.1.1. HER. 
HER is the cathodic half reaction that occurs in the water electrolysis process, which produces the clean energy carrier hydrogen gas from a sustainable source, i.e., water. Based on kinetic studies, HER undergoes a multistep reaction process and the rate determining step of the HER mechanism can be estimated by knowing the Tafel slope value.121 Generally, the first step involves the discharge process, popularly known as the Volmer reaction, followed by electrochemical/chemical adsorption to complete the whole HER process. Moreover, the HER mechanism follows different pathways in acidic and basic medium. HER in alkaline solution requires extra energy to generate protons by breaking the water molecule, while a large number of available protons in the acidic medium promote HER, which consequently influences the overall reaction rates.122
The first step is the Volmer step (discharge step):M + H3O+ + e− ↔ M–Hads + H2O, TS = (116–120) mV;where, M = catalytically active site, followed by either Heyrovsky step (electrochemical desorption) or Tafel step (chemical desorption) to complete the HER reaction.
Heyrovsky step:M–Hads + e− + H+ ↔ M + H2, TS = (38–40) mV
Tafel step:2M–Hads ↔ 2M + H2, TS = (29–30) mV
Similarly, in a basic medium, HER involves the following steps;
Volmer step (discharge step):M + H2O + e− ↔ M–Hads + OH−
Heyrovsky step:M–Hads + H2O + e− ↔ M + H2 + OH−
Tafel step:2M–Hads ↔ 2M + H2
Thus, to complete the HER reaction, either Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel mechanism must be involved.3,29,123,124
Although, Pt is considered as a benchmark catalyst for HER, its large-scale applications are limited by its high-cost and scarcity.125,126 Hence, it is essential to develop alternative electrocatalysts derived from earth-abundant elements. Transition metals are considered as earth-abundant elements and their phosphides have been used as the most stable and durable electrocatalysts. In general, nickel phosphide exhibits superior chemical properties because of the existence of multielectron orbitals (that easily adsorb hydrogen protons), favorable electronic configuration, and significant metalloid characteristics. Further, phosphorus induces electron transfer from the nickel metal to phosphorus and could also significantly weaken the strength of hydrogen adsorption (more positive ΔGH*), thus preventing nickel phosphide from poisoning due to the strong bonding with hydrogen atoms, leading to significant enhancement in the activity and stability in a wide pH range.127–129 In addition, the insight of the mechanism of HER on the surface of the catalyst can be explained using DFT calculations, which reveals that the Gibbs free energy changes in the intermediate adsorbed H*, denoted as ΔGH*, have been acknowledged as a vital descriptor for assessing the HER pathway. Thus, the ideal value of ΔGH* should be zero for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction. Hence, the development of proficient catalysts having ΔGH* value nearer to zero as compared to the most efficient noble metal for HER, i.e., Pt (ΔGH* of ca. −0.09 eV) is required.130 During the past few years, nickel phosphides have been showing greater efficiency than other precious noble metals due to their low-cost and stability both in acidic and basic medium. In particular, the nickel phosphide catalyst needs a very small overpotential (<50 mV) to achieve the minimum current density (10 mA cm−2) with a smaller Tafel slope and shows stability at the maximum current density (>10 mA cm−2) both in acidic and basic medium.78 In the section below, we have summarized some nickel phosphide-based electrocatalysts employed in HER.
3.1.1.1. Phase and pH dependent nickel phosphides. 
First of all, Ni2P is well known as an HDS catalyst.36,131 Later, Liu and Rodriguez studied the internal structure by DFT calculations and revealed that the presence of phosphorus changes the electronic properties of Ni. Hence, the Ni2P (001) system proved to be a good hydrogen evolution catalyst, mimicking [NiFe] hydrogenase. In particular, the Ni2P (001) surface has hollow Ni-sites, which are strong hydride acceptors; once the hydride adsorbate (H*) fills up the hollow Ni-sites, the less-reactive Ni–P bridge site gets interacted with an additional adsorbate (2H*) that forces the Ni–P bridge sites to moderately bind the intermediates and products, resulting in the removal of molecular H2 from the Ni2P (001) surface with less energy consumption (Fig. 4c). Hence, the P sites also directly influence the HER activity.35 Further, Schaak's group developed Ni2P nanoparticles with a highly accessible surface area, having a high density exposed on the (001) facets (Fig. 4a), which shows the highest activity for HER in the acidic medium.54 They observed that the overpotential (η) required to reach 20 mA cm−2 cathodic current density was 130 mV, with a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 4b). The turnover frequency (TOF) at corresponding over potential was found out to be 0.015 s−1. Following these pioneering studies, nickel phosphide NPs have become a recent focal point of consideration as an advanced HER catalyst.29,121,132–134 However, despite numerous on-going studies, the impact of nickel phosphide nanoparticle shape on the HER activity remains unexplored. Seo et al. prepared differently shaped Ni2P and studied their HER performance. A difference in the HER activity between the Ni2P(001) surface of the nanosphere and the Ni2P(210) surface of the nanorod morphology was observed; the polydisperse Ni2P nanoparticles exhibited the highest result because of the presence of more active sites and the presence of the prominent 001 active plane.121 Xile Hu and his coworkers synthesized Ni2P nanowires and studied the active sites available on different facets to drive excellent HER activity. As per the theoretical calculation, they observed that the Ni2P nanowires were grown along the c-axis, which is the 〈0001〉 direction. They also found that this morphology has some other exposed facets such as ±(110), (100), and (111) along with the Ni3P terminated (0001) facets. According to DFT calculations, the phosphor (P) stabilized Ni-bridge sites are available on the facets of Ni2P NWs and provide moderate binding to H atoms. The Ni bridge sites present in a continuous row on the (100) and (20) facets and adjacent to the Ni hollow sites on the (111) facet appeared as the sites with the highest exchange current density, as estimated by the Tafel plot. This requires an overpotential of 0.0 V, 0.6 V, and 0.19 V, respectively, which was even lower than that of the overpotential required for the (0001) facet. Thus, the high activity measured from the nanowires grown along the 〈0001〉 direction suggests that the active site of Ni2P is unlikely to be the (0001) facet.135

Although nickel phosphide was found to be an excellent electrocatalyst towards HER in acidic medium, however, the HER activity of nickel phosphide in alkaline medium is quite unsatisfactory as the performance rapidly declines due to the degradation of Ni2P to Ni.54 Thus, a rapid search of stable nickel phosphide in alkaline medium was carried out. Zheng Zhou et al. proposed a nickel phosphide that was applicable over a wide range of pH. They found that on increasing the pH from 0.52 to 10.46, the required overpotential increased from 171 to 410 mV at the respective pH, and after a certain pH, the value decreases. This is because with the increase in pH, the H+ concentration decreases, which trims down the Hads in the Volmer reaction. Similarly, the Tafel slope also increased from 84 to 255 mV dec−1 over the same pH range and then it dropped to 130 mV dec−1 with a further increase in the pH to 13.53. Hence, it was concluded that Ni2P exhibits higher HER activity in strong acidic and strong basic electrolytes. The outstanding activity shown in the strong basic medium may be due to the OH− ions produced in the Volmer step that selectively are attached to the positively charged Ni2+ species through strong electrostatic affinity, whereas the nearby Ni facilitate H adsorption and the in situ formation of NiO/Ni(OH)2 during the electrochemical tests, resulting in an increase in the HER catalytic activity.136,137
Further, nickel phosphide of different phases can be obtained by simply varying the reaction conditions. The variation in the HER activity, in accordance with different phases of nickel phosphide, has been keenly studied. Kucernak et al. synthesized Ni2P and Ni12P5 materials using ball milling and hydrothermal route, respectively, and observed the HER activity in acidic medium.129 They found that with increasing P content in nickel phosphide, the materials could resist corrosion even in harsh acidic medium. Here, the Ni2P phase was more corrosion resistant in acidic electrolytes and gave the best result for HER compared to Ni12P5. Later, from the year 2015 onwards, a massive work involving phase-dependent HER activity was carried out thoroughly.30,37,45,48 It was found that Ni5P4 is more HER active and corrosion resistant than Ni2P30 and Ni12P5 (ref. 45) both in acidic and basic medium as it possesses a higher positive charge on Ni and a stronger ensemble effect of the P atoms.45 For the first time, Andrew M. Rappe and his group used the DFT calculation method to study the internal structure and the theoretical HER activity of Ni5P4, which revealed that Ni5P4 is much more active than Ni2P towards HER.40 They observed that the Ni4P3 layer along the axis (000) of Ni5P4 provides a lower HER overpotential of about −0.16 V, and therefore, greater HER activity than that of Ni2P(0001) (overpotential = −0.21 V), which can be attributed to the P3 hollow sites of the (000) plane that provide optimum H adsorption.138 Among all the work regarding Ni5P4, Lurence et al. obtained the best result, i.e., among the two phases (Ni5P4 and Ni2P, distinctly observed from XRD as shown in Fig. 4d), Ni5P4 needs a very low potential of 23 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 of current density with a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec−1 in 1 M H2SO4 acidic solution and in case of the alkaline medium (1 M NaOH), to reach the same current density, 49 mV of overpotential with a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec−1 was required (Fig. 4e and f). In addition, according to the DFT calculations, they suggested that as compared to Ni2P, Ni5P4 possesses faster rate of HER due to enhance binding energy of the first hydrogenic intermediate, which in turn augments the second proton affinity, thus accelerating the overall reaction rate for hydrogen evolution.30 Similarly, two phases of Ni2P and Ni5P4 were composed of self-assembled nanoplates and were directly grown on Ti foil, which resulted in a flower-like microball structure. Here, it was also observed that the free energy of Hads on the Ni site of Ni5P4 was 0.152 eV, which was smaller than that of the Ni site of Ni2P (0.182 eV). Thus, the Ni5P4 microballs exhibited better HER activity at a very low overpotential of 35.4 mV with a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1 as compared to the Ni2P microballs due to the above-mentioned reasons.37 Ruiqi Zhou et al. also stated that the P-rich phases (Ni5P4 + Ni2P) show more HER activity with a low overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 of current density, which is due to the strong ensemble effect of the P atoms and more number of active sites provided by the P-rich Ni–P NPs. Further, they also concluded that simply by manipulating the surface properties of the Ni(OH)2 precursor used as the nickel source, the phases and composition of the Ni–P based NPs could be easily tuned, which provides a simple, economic, and green strategy route to enhance the HER activity.74,139 Rui Zhang et al. had prepared Ni–P NPs from Ni phenylphosphonate as a single source with different heating temperatures and found that the Ni2P phase shows the best activity with an 87 mV overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2.140 On the other hand, Ni3P is a metal-rich phosphide having high corrosion tolerance and could not show activity such as that of Ni2P, Ni5P4, and Pt but for the first time, Laursen et al. developed a reconstructed Ni3P(001) surface, which exhibited more active sites for HER activity both in acidic and basic medium and possesses very slightly lower HER activity than that of Ni5P4 and Pt despite of a low P content.29 Moreover, due to the reconstruction, the DFT calculation suggests that the Ni hollow sites on the Ni3P surface are substituted by Padatom, which stabilize the P-sites. Mainly, the Ni3P(s)/Ni4P4 + VNi + P stoichiometric reconstruction of the Ni3P (001) surface results in lower H coverage, providing nearly thermoneutral H binding (ΔGH ≈ 0.04 eV), and generates highly active sites for HER. This Pad reconstruction on the Ni3P (001) surface resembles the Ni2P(0001) and Ni5P4(0001) surfaces and showed a low overpotential of 66 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in acidic medium with a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1. The required overpotential was 291 mV in alkaline medium. Here, the reconstruction of the surface enables shallower binding energies of the H adsorbed atoms, which results in faster, efficient, and stable (16 h) catalysis. Hoyoung Kim et al. developed a new phase of nickel phosphide, i.e., Ni78P22, by the pulse-electrodeposition method for performing proton-exchange water electrolysis and it was found to exhibit better HER activity at 10 mA cm−2 current density with only 105 mV of overpotential.141
Further, in order to improve the HER performance of solo nickel phosphide, the material was hybridized with other materials to some extent. To gain in depth knowledge, the work of some renowned groups has been portrayed as an example.88,103,142–146 Liu et al. developed the Ni2P/MoS2 composite to improve the H2 evolution reaction in Ni2P.142 In 2015, Yuan Pan et al. prepared a hybrid of Ni2P with N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) and the best activity was found at a very low onset overpotential of 37 mV with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1, which is quite attractive.143 Besides rGO, some other carbonaceous materials have also been reported to be hybridized with nickel phosphides.88,144,145 The presence of heteroatoms (N, S, P, and O) derived from carbonaceous materials and metal oxide/sulphide plays an important role in HER by providing more number of proton (H+) adsorption sites through their lone pair electrons in the acidic medium.103 Further, Liu et al. reported a Ru modulated Ni@Ni2P rod-like heterostructure for HER.146 It was found that constructing a rod-like Ni@Ni2P–Ru heterostructure, as shown in TEM image (Fig. 4g), using a simple one-pot synthetic method enhances the HER activity both in acidic and basic medium. Ni@Ni2P–Ru revealed the best activity in basic medium with an overpotential of 31 mV, whereas it showed the best Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1 in acidic medium (Fig. 4h and i). It behaves nearly like a Pt electrode and hence, the replacement of Pt with nickel phosphide-based materials is now a reality.146
3.1.1.2. Immobilization of NixPy on conductive substrates or nanostructuring. 
Ni2P derived from 3D micro/nano structures such as MOFs provide better advantages towards HER activity in terms of great stability with long-term durability because the good distribution of the high Ni metal content at the center of the MOF gives perfect dispersity and highly exposed active sites, as shown in Fig. 5a. The DFT pore-size distribution study disclosed that the pore size of the MOF precursor became larger after the phosphorization calcination process, and this hierarchical pore structure helps in the faster diffusion of the electrolyte and promotes charge transportation through the working electrode interface.147 MOF-74-Ni-derived Ni2P polyhedron with hierarchically porous structured electrocatalyst was developed by Liting Yan et al. for hydrogen evolution both in acidic and basic medium.147 It was observed that with a very low catalyst loading (0.124 mg cm−2), the output reached a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 just with an overpotential of 158 mV and a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec−1 in acidic medium. An array of Ni2P@carbon coreshell nanorod148 was synthesized using ZIF-67-Ni MOF as a precursor. The observed unique core–shell structure of Ni2P@C nanorods consist of Ni2P in the core, which acts as a strong catalytic site, increases the electrochemical active surface area, and exposed the faces, whereas the shell is made up of amorphous carbon, which promotes electron transfer kinetics during the HER reaction. The nanorod array derived from a porous structure benefits from the fast diffusion of the electrolyte and the release of H2 gas bubbles during HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with an overpotential of 186 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2.

Furthermore, the development of nickel phosphide on substrates results in an interconnected conductive skeletal, which leads to better charge transfer kinetics. The 3D configuration that arises from this allows the small hydrogen gas bubbles to release timely during the HER process, which ensures the regeneration of sufficient number of active sites.102,149,150 Single-phase supported electrode of nickel phosphide could be prepared by phosphidizing Ni(OH)2/Ti to Ni2P/Ti in an indirect electrochemical set up, which showed excellent catalytic activity and stability with nearly 100% faradic efficiency in 1 M H2SO4 acidic solution with overpotentials of 120, 138, and 188 mV to afford the current densities of 10, 20, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively.149 Direct electrodes of different mixed phases were also synthesized such as P–NixP/Cu foil151 and (Ni–NixP/CC).87 Shun Wang et al. prepared a Ni–NixP/carbon cloth electrode via the pulse deposition method. In this method, at a low potential of 2.2 V, the deposited Ni–NixP nanospheres on carbon cloth afforded 10 mA cm−2 of cathodic current density at an overpotential of 164 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic solution and the corresponding Tafel plot slope was 76 mV dec−1.87 Another highly active flexible electrode was made by Cao et al. through the co-electrodeposition of hierarchical radial NixP nanospheres on the Ni foam, which showed the best activity in the basic at an overpotential of η10 = 63 mV with a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c and d).152 These hierarchical radial nanospheres possess an amorphous structure and are composed of ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 5b), which is responsible for the very good electrolyte permeation and electronic transportation, thus resulting in the best catalytic activity. Ni foam is considered to be an excellent support for the development of nickel phosphide-based materials. 3D self-supported nickel phosphide electrode and array cathodes were recently prepared for the enhancement of the HER performance. Lifeng Liu and his coworkers fabricated different nickel phosphide-based cathodes and tested their HER performance. They found that the Ni5P4–Ni2P nanosheets (NSs) array83 cathode is more active, which showed a high electrocatalytic HER activity, exhibiting overpotentials of 120, 140, and 200 mV at current densities of 10, 20, and 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5e), with the Tafel slope of 79.1 mV dec−1 compared to that of Ni2P–NRs/Ni.153 A constant cathodic current was observed for a period of 70 h; also, the activity was retained for 1000 continuous cycles, thus showing the best stability in the acidic medium (Fig. 5f). The outstanding HER activity of this biphasic NSs array compared to the pure phase Ni2P is due to the unique topology of the compound with the maximum number of active sites and a large fraction of Ni5P4, which provide a synergetic effect between the two phases.83 Further, Shi et al. reported a new 3D self-supported Ni2P NSs/NF, which is a highly active, stable, durable, and pH-tolerable electrode towards electrochemical hydrogen evolution.98 He found that the supported Ni2P NSs/NF cathode gave an excellent onset overpotential of 41 mV with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec−1. This excellent activity in alkaline medium was far better than that in the acidic medium because of the structure and morphology of the electrode. The material acts as a hydrophilic surface, which removes the gas bubbles easily and rapid reduction occurs due to the fast electron transfer from Ni2P to the electrode. This is because of its suitable morphology; the direct growth of the Ni2P sheets and the loose arrangement of the nanosheets over the Ni foam along with the net-like skeleton of the foam help the tiny bubbles to escape. It was observed that the adsorbed bubbles on the Ni2P/Ni foam (Fig. 5g) were much smaller in size, suggesting that the Ni2P nanosheets supported over the Ni foam possess a highly hydrophilic surface. As a result, the adhesion of the as-produced gas bubbles on the electrode surface decreases, which facilitates the rapid elimination of small gas bubbles and offers a constant working area. However, if the bubbles accumulate on the catalyst surface, the active area will be diminished and ionic transportation will be hindered.98 Recently, a new approach was realized to prepare Ni5P4/Ni2P nanoparticles on Ni5P4/Ni2P nanosheets (S–NiP).78 The material required only 35 mV (close to that of the Pt wire, 33 mV) and 65 mV of overpotential to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. The Tafel slope was found out to be 44.4 mV dec−1, which is very close to that of the Pt wire (40.5 mV dec−1), and showed excellent stability at a high current density of 1200 mA cm−2 for 24 h. Thus, the hierarchical structure of the NPs on NSs provided a widespread surface area that exhibits more active sites for excellent electrocatalytic performance both in acidic and basic medium.
In order to further improve the efficiency of electrocatalysts, modifications have been carried out by introducing some metal oxides such as Ni2P/CeO2 nanosheet array154 and Ni2P/NiO NR array,77 and metal sulphides such as WS2/Ni5P4–Ni2P.155 The WS2/Ni5P4–Ni2P composite was developed by the hybridization of WS2 and 3D self-supporting nickel phosphide array, which improves the performance of the electrode by an intriguing synergetic effect.155 In case of WS2/Ni5P4–Ni2P, DFT calculations explained the enhancement in the intrinsic catalytic activity by the doping of Ni and P atoms on WS2. The hydrogen atom was preferred to adsorb on the top of the P atom rather than on the S atom. Further, the ΔGH* of the WS2 matrix was also reduced to nearly zero because of the P atoms, which led to the activation of new active sites for superior HER activity. Among the various composites of metal oxides with metal phosphides, the Ni2P/CeO2 NSs array was found to be highly stable and shows the best result by achieving 20 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 84 mV with a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1 in alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). This proficient activity was due to the key reaction steps involved in the Ni2P(111) and Ni2P–CeO2(111) interface, as determined by the DFT calculations. With the adsorption of the H atom at favorable binding sites on Ni2P–CeO2(111), the corresponding ΔGH* value shifts to 0.05 eV, which is more feasible for the HER activity. Mainly, the reinforced binding strength of H* on the Ni2P–CeO2 interface plays an important role in lowering the activation energy barrier for water dissociation as well as more thermal neutral free energy.154 Moreover, the presence of O-vacancies in metal oxides provides active sites for H–OH bond cleavage; as a result, more protons gets trapped by the negatively charged P sites present in NiP2, which forms H2 molecules by adjusting the adsorption/desorption.77
3.1.1.3. Doped nickel phosphide-based materials towards HER. 
The doping of hetero-atoms has been considered as an efficient pathway towards more active catalysts as the impregnation of hetero-atoms makes for more opportunities available to modify the adsorption/desorption energies of the reactants/products, which is found to be critical for the HER activity.101 We already know that P act as a proton accepter center and promotes Ni to accept hydride ions for subsequent hydrogen evolution. Only one anionic active site is generated by the transition of valence electrons, which results in less capable proton discharge process in HER. Meanwhile, the introduction of binary or dual transition metals leads to valence electrons redistribution and provides two electron donation active sites, which amplifies the HER activity.156 Moreover, the presence of another transition metal along with Ni and P in bimetallic phosphides results in the shifting of the d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, which diminishes the chemical interaction taking place between the reaction intermediates and catalytic surface, and hence improves the catalytic properties.157 The inclusion of another metal surface to fabricate a composite is a very common approach to accelerate the Volmer and Tafel step.158
Single-phase bimetallic nickel phosphide materials have attracted somewhat more attention towards HER. Some examples of such materials are NiCuP,100,159 NiCoP,127,156,160–162 NiFeP,101,163,164 and NiMoP.158 In the case of NiCuP, a hole-structured NiCuP nanosheet array was developed by Sijun Chu et al., which exhibits very good HER activity, i.e., to attain 10 mA cm−2 of current density, only 78 mV of overpotential was required and a corresponding Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1.100 As per the DFT calculation, the Cu dopant changes the electronic structure and the Fermi level of Ni2P to optimize desorption/adsorption of hydrogen, and the holey structure provides better contact with the electrolytes and promotes gas release during HER. Similar to copper, Fe metal can also be used as a dopant in nickel phosphide to improve the activity.101,163,164 The bimetallic NiFeP composite exhibits better result than Ni–P in the acidic medium as for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm−2, just 101 mV of overpotential was required and the Tafel slope was 43 mV dec−1. Here, the DFT study explains that the decrease in δ+ at the Fe sites of 1Ni–4Fe–P promotes proton adsorption by reducing electronic repulsion, whereas the increase in δ− at the P sites makes proton trapping easy on the catalyst surface. In this case, the Fe sites act as hydride acceptors instead of Ni because of their high content.163 Moreover, a lot of work has also been carried out over the different structure- and morphology-oriented Co-doped nickel phosphide composites derived from different nano and microstructures.127,156,160–162 However, an optimum ratio between Ni and Co is very essential for the increase in the HER performance as it was studied from the DFT calculations that Ni-rich materials were exemplified by the very low adsorption energies and were not suitable for proton reduction, whereas the Co-rich NCs illustrated very high binding energies, which limited the hydrogen desorption rate, thus blocking the adsorption sites. Moreover, proper compatibility between the proportion of the components in Ni2−xCoxP and the Gibbs free energy of Hads on the Ni2−xCoxP surface drive the excellent HER activity.160 Further, NiCoP was grown on different matrix electrodes, which also got considerable attention; here, we have cited few reports.165–168 Among all the synthesized materials, the NiCoP NWs array/NF exhibited the best result in 1 M KOH as it required only 43 mV of overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 of current density with a long-lasting durability of a minimum of 33 h. This dramatically improved activity was due to the surface roughness of the nanowires through long-term CV sweeping.167 Further, NiCoP modification was done with other materials.105,124,169–171 Among the above-modified materials, the CoP/NiCoP/NC composite showed superior HER activity. The overpotentials required to afford 10 mA cm−2 of current density were 60, 75, and 123 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M PBS solutions, respectively. The enhancement in the activity is attributed to the following points: (i) electronic structure, (ii) interfacial coupling between CoP and NiCoP, and (iii) the enlarged surface area that exposes maximum of its catalytically active sites because of the 2D morphology as well as the conductivity of the NC support.105 A homogenous quadruple multimetallic phosphide (FexCoyNizP) was synthesized by Wenling Gu et al., in which the metallic ratio played an important role in enhancing the activity. The synthesized material with the ratio of the components as Fe0.33Co0.33Ni0.33P achieved benchmark current density at just 38 mV of overpotential with a Tafel slope of 45.91 mV dec−1 (Fig. 6a and b). Here, DFT showed that the H atoms were adsorbed on the metal–metal–P hollow sites or the transition metal top-site.172

Recently, strain engineering has received growing interest for precisely modifying the bond length, binding energy, and other properties of transition metal-based materials. In comparison to different strategies, sulphur substitution within the metal phosphides is considered to be an excellent approach. According to DFT, the modified phosphosulphide electronic structure and the tuned hydrogen adsorption free energy are the main reasons for the enhancement in the HER activity.130 Following these, some of the reported nickel phosphosulphide systems have been included.31,130,173–176 Among the various modification strategies of the nickel phosphide unit, the modification made by including sulphur significantly enhances the electrode surface area, thus extending the active sites. At the same time, it also controls the surface oxidation and dissolution of the catalyst in the electrolyte solution for HER performance. Chang et al. reported a high performance HER electrocatalyst with sulfur-doped Ni5P4 nanoplate arrays grown on carbon paper (S–Ni5P4 NPA/CP); this robust, monolithic, ternary composite S–Ni5P4 NPA/CP exhibited incredible HER activity compared to nickel phosphide and nickel sulfide catalysts. S–Ni5P4 NPA/CP with ∼6% S requires only 56 mV and 104 mV of overpotentials (η) to attain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, with a Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec−1 (Fig. 6e and f). The turnover frequency of 6% S–Ni5P4 NPA/CP was about 0.11 s−1 at an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, DFT illustrated that S–Ni5P4 NPA/CP showed only 0.04 eV of ΔGH*, which is more preferable than that of Pt (∼−0.09 eV). Here, S-doping not only constrained the surface oxidation and dissolution in the acid solution but also diminished the ΔGH*.130
Moreover, other kind of modifications have been done on nickel phosphide such as Al-doped Ni2P nanosheet array.177 Different attempts have also been made where various transition metal phosphides are incorporated with nickel phosphide as a separated phase in the composite.96,128,178–180 Among the different distinct phase-mixed phosphide electrocatalysts, CoP/Ni5P4/CoP grown over NF (Fig. 6c) was designed in such a manner that CoP is positioned on the top and below the Ni5P4 nanosheet array, forming sandwiched microsheets with mesopores and macropores in between them. This structure plays a great role in enhancing the HER activity. Mainly, the surface contact between CoP and Ni5P4 provides an easy pathway for electron flow. CoP, as an excellent electrical conducting material, facilitates fast electron transport. The 3D structure with porous feature enables highly exposed active sites for hydrogen adsorption together with providing a diffusion pathway for gaseous products and electrolytes. Thus, on considering the above results, for achieving 10 mA cm−2 of current density, a minimum overpotential of 33 mV and 71 mV was required in acidic (Fig. 6d) and basic medium, respectively.178 Similarly, Ge et al. developed the Ni2P/Fe2P electrocatalyst that reached a larger current density of 500 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 266 mV in acidic medium. This excellent activity is due to its structural advantages, with various active metal sites derived from the Ni(OH)2 and PBA precursors.180 Recently, novel V-doped Ni5P4 microspheres were developed that possess a 3D hierarchical nanoporous structure; the high surface area and V-doping effectively improved the H-adsorption strength. As a result, it exhibited an activity analogous to that of Pt at all pH values towards HER; however, in the alkaline medium, it showed required only 13 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2.181
In summary, nickel phosphide composites have proved to be excellent electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Mainly, the ensemble effect reflected by the P-atom is beneficial for the enhancement of the catalytic activity by reducing the number of exposed Ni active sites.182 Moreover, among various metal-rich nickel phosphides, Ni5P4 NCs, possessing large number of P-atoms, provides a large number of proton-acceptor centers and hence, provides more active sites for electrocatalytic reactions.183 Some exceptions have been seen in the case of the Ni2P phase, which shows good catalytic activity towards HER though it belongs to the metal-rich phase due to the presence of well-defined exposed facets and proper Ni and P atom proportion. The details of H2-generation by various nickel phosphide-based materials have been listed in Table 4.

3.1.2. OER. 
Oxygen evolution reaction is the other half-reaction in water electrolysis and is worthwhile to study as it is a core process of many energy storage and conversion cells.187 But OER occurring at the anode is an uphill process compared to HER, which hampers the overall reaction rate because of the following bottlenecks: (1) four-proton-coupled electron transfer, (2) strong oxygen–oxygen double bond, and (3) larger overpotential.188,189 Further, electrocatalytic OER is very sensitive to the reaction surface and its mechanism is quite complicated. Based on kinetic studies, various reaction mechanisms have been proposed on heterogeneous electrocatalysis, some of which are given below.
In acidic medium;M + H2O ↔ M–OHads + H+ + e−M–OHads ↔ M–Oads + H+ + e−2M–Oads ↔ 2M + O2
Superoxide pathway;M–Oads + H2O ↔ M–OOHads + H+ + e−2M–OOHads ↔ M–Oads + H2O + O2 + M
In basic medium;M + OH− ↔ M–OHads + e−M–OHads + OH− ↔ M–Oads + H2O + e−M–Oads + OH− ↔ M–OOHads + e−M–OOHads + OH− ↔ M–OOads + H2OM–OOads + OH− ↔ M + O2 + e−
Unlike HER, OER is much more complicated; therefore, we cannot possibly apply Buttler–Volmer equation to any of its step confidentially but the kinetics should be evaluated from the Tafel slope. The Tafel slope does not give the same values as it is potential dependent for OER. It was found that a higher slope originates at the commencement of 1.5 V potential, where the OH− concentration is higher and the electrode is positively charged.190,191 The activation is actually dependent on the M–O bond formation or OH− adsorption as the principle rate determining step. On the other hand, a lower slope implies that both M–O and M–O–O bond formations are the rate determining step. Further, at a more elevated potential of 1.8 V, the OH− concentration is depleted and the electrode is positively charged. As a result, M–O/M–O–O bond cleavage takes place. However, none of the OER mechanisms proposed for the heterogeneous catalyst have yet fully validated the concept based on experimental results. In different scenarios, different equations hold as the rate determining steps.190–193
In order to overcome the sluggish OER kinetic, the process requires some highly efficient catalysts. In this regards, iridium dioxide (IrO2) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) have proven to be quite promising catalysts, which achieved a standard current density of 10 mA cm−2 at very low overpotential and Tafel slope values; however, these catalysts suffer from certain drawbacks, i.e., they are quite expensive catalysts with a dissolution problem both in acidic and basic medium.189 However, the two systems stand up at the top position compared to other reported electrodes in the field of OER electrochemistry. Thus, the development of a robust, earth-abundant, cost effective, stable, and durable oxygen evolving electrocatalyst is a rough and vigorous research, which can efficiently produce an oxidative current density of above 500 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of <300 mV with long-term stability.194,195 Unlike HER catalysts, OER catalysts that require more overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (considered as the benchmark) with smaller Tafel slope are believed to be the best ones. Nickel metal-based materials are able to provide numerous vacant d-orbitals, which are easily occupied by the electrons of O 2p to form the Ni–O bond. Due to the varied valence state, the available 3d orbitals of the transition metals play a crucial role in promoting the OH− adsorption process and Ni–O bond formation.196 To date, all the nickel phosphide-based materials have proven to be the best electrocatalysts in the field of OER similar to their oxide and hydroxide counterparts. Since the phosphorization process not only increases the surface roughness but also makes the material porous, the number of active sites and convenient pathways to facilitate OH− and electron transfer are increased.38,197 Moreover, DFT describes the adsorption of different radicals such as OH*, O*, and OOH* on the nickel phosphide surface properly. For example, in the case of Ni2P(111), the adsorption of different radicals was studied with different Ni-n sites (n = 3, 4, 5; where, n is the coordination number). The results showed that Ni-3 is the best coordination state for all the three radicals; the OH* and O* radicals are found to be stable on hollow Ni3 adsorption sites, while OOH* is stable on the bridge sites. Discussing the overpotential and free energy, it was also found that OOH* formation is the potential limiting step for Ni2P and the overpotential of OER is effectively reduced with the introduction of P.198 In the section below, we have summarized some nickel phosphide-based electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
3.1.2.1. Phase dependent nickel phosphides. 
Since over a decade, Ni2P and Ni12P5 have been established as efficient OER catalysts. Stern et al. for the first time developed Ni2P and showed that nickel phosphides are also capable of carrying efficient water oxidation in alkaline condition at a very low overpotential, i.e., 290 mV (Fig. 7a).199 They observed the in situ formation of the core–shell Ni2P/NiOx assembly under catalytic conditions, which was the active form of the catalyst. The structural modification (formation of NiOx around Ni2P) was confirmed by HRTEM (Fig. 7b) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Fig. 7b inset). Moreover, nanostructured nickel phosphides have been intensively studied owing to the unique properties arising from their novel structure. The water oxidation of the pure phase Ni12P5 nanocapsule32 showed remarkable OER activity as it required an overpotential of 290 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1. Thus, nanocapsule-like structures provide more active sites, which lead to higher activity. Further, Li et al. developed a facile route for the fabrication of oxygen incorporated Ni2P nanosheets through the low-temperature phosphatization of the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet precursor. The obtained oxygen-incorporated Ni2P nanosheets presented an OER overpotential of 347 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 and the electrocatalytic current was enhanced 25 times compared to that of pure Ni2P.200

Moreover, very little work has been done in the field of solo nickel phosphides. In order to further increase the charge transportation efficiency, different materials have been coupled with NixPy. It was found that in comparison to the pure phase of nickel phosphide, there was an increase in the OER activity for the composite materials such as oxides core–shell Fe3O4/NixP,201 quantum dots (N–C QDs/Ni2P),202 and noble metal loading (Au–Ni12P5 (ref. 203)). The core–shell nanostructure composite Fe3O4/NixP, comprising of Fe3O4 crystalline core and NixP amorphous shell, has been reported as an effective OER catalyst (Fig. 7c). A selective phosphidation route was adopted for the phosphidation of Ni exclusively but remained inactive to Fe, leading to the desired nanostructure. Though Fe3O4 is OER inactive, the core–shell structure excelled in the field with an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7d).201
3.1.2.2. Immobilization of NixPy on conductive substrates or nanostructuring. 
As the preparation of Ni–P through phosphidation suffers from some drawbacks such as the aggregation of nanoparticles and coatings of active sites,198 thus novel strategies have been implemented where NiP was prepared from nano/microstructures (Ni-based MOF,191 LDHs,204 Prussian blue analogues79) or developed on various substrates such as Si wafer,205 metal foils/mesh, and carbon paper.206 Moreover, phosphidation from nano/microarchitecture provides uniform morphology, interconnected conductive skeleton, porous framework, as well as proper dispersive active sites.79 The synergistic effect from these aspects helps to improve the conductivity and charge transfer capability, thus improving the OER performance. Shanmugam et al. derived nickel phosphide from Ni-based MOF and found that it required an overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm−2.191 Further, Yu et al., on taking a more forward step, combined Ni-based Prussian blue analogue with Ni MOF and found a very efficient carbon-modified mixed phase nickel phosphide having a hexagonal structure.79 The porous desirable hexagonal nanostructure provided an overpotential of 300 mv at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8a). Though the catalyst is an impressive one but it is still lagging behind. It was seen that the derived carbon often shows an agglomerated morphology, which may be the cause of its lower activity. In order to achieve high catalytic activity, reducing the agglomeration for full exposure of the active sites and building up of the interconnected charge transport highway should be satisfied at the same time. Wang et al. derived Ni2P from Ni-based MOF and further enhanced its activity by incorporating graphene sheets. The obtained (Ni2P@C-G) catalyst presented an OER overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a very low Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1.207 It was found that on using substrate modified synthetic routes, the substrate provides a stable surface as well as a highly conductive crystal structure for NiPx.

Furthermore, Ko and his coworkers proposed an incredible approach for the controlled reproducible synthesis of low-cost Ni2P nanoparticles anchored on Mg2O(OH)2-like phase supported on carbon paper206 and Al-anchored self-supported Ni5P4–Ni2P NF.208 They found that the interfacial strain between the Mg and Ni containing phases is mainly responsible for the elevated catalytic OER with a large turn over frequency of 0.05 s−1, whereas the Al-containing phases produced high surface area and porosity in the alkaline medium, which facilitates surface deposition of NiOOH, accelerates water oxidation kinetics with an overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm−2 having a modest Tafel slope of 27 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8b and c), and was very stable upto 200 h.206,208 During water oxidation, Ni2P NPs immediately were oxidized to the core–shell structure of NiO(OH)/Ni2P@NiO or Ni(OH)2/NiO. This in situ generated stable hydroxide form is responsible for the excellent OER activity. In case of AlNiP, CV testing verified that during OER, the anode undergoes rapid oxidation; this observation was again supported by the XRD analysis of CV-tested AlNiP, which explains the decrease in the content of the Ni5P4 phase due to its oxidation. The XPS data of CV-tested AlNiP also explain the surface modification of nickel phosphide to nickel hydroxide/oxide.208
The enhancement in the OER activity can be further carried out by incorporating other OER active catalysts onto NixPy. Nickel phosphides are modified into the composite with other materials such as hydroxides Ni2P/Ni5P4/NiFeLDH,209 phosphites {Ni2P/Fe(PO3)2},210 and oxy-hydroxides (NiOOH/Ni–P).211 Yu et al. designed a 3D hierarchical structure, where NiFe double-layered hydroxide (which has long been established as an efficient OER catalyst) was grown on highly conductive NiP nanoarray NF. They found that the 3D nano-heterostructure presented an overpotential of 197 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 46.6 mV dec−1. The high efficiency was attributed to the smart 3D hierarchical core shell structure, which provides a large surface area with high porosity, and thus greatly accelerates water molecule adsorption, electrolyte diffusion, and easy release of O2.209 Zhou et al. developed a robust 3D catalyst Ni2P/Fe(PO3)2, which gave an excellent overpotential of 300 mV at 1705 mA cm−2 and could survive at 500 mA cm−2 operation for over 20 h.210 Recently, Cheng et al. prepared a novel 3D ternary hybrid consisting of Fe2O3, which strongly coupled with Ni2P/Ni(PO3)2 NF through a thermal phosphorization technique. They found a very high current density of 1000 mA cm−2 at very low potential of 1.60 V with a Tafel slope of 48.2 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8d and e),212 which is possible only due to the strong molecular coupling between the iron moiety and nickel phosphide.210,212
3.1.2.3. Different cation- and anion-doped nickel phosphides. 
Going further through the research, it was found that the incorporation of a suitable foreign element, i.e., transition metals, in NixPy to form the bimetallic nickel phosphide could be an effective method to optimize the OER activity. With the simple incorporation of very low quantity of metals into nickel phosphide (NiMP), the doped atoms help to create more active sites, tune the energy levels, and modulate the resulting electronic band structure, giving rise to different synergetic surface chemistry, which may be the cause of optimized catalytic activities towards electrochemical OER compared to monometallic NixPy.187,213 In recent years, some bimetallic phosphides such as NiCuP,214 NiCoP,187,196,215–218 NiFeP,33,97,104,197,219–229 NiMoP,190 NiMnP,190 NiRuP,229 and NiVP231 have been studied well. Byung Keun Kim et al. described that when Cu is added into the NiP electrocatalyst, an effective result is not obtained. Still, the activity observed by requiring 307 mV of overpotential to attain the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 42.5 mV dec−1 (ref. 214) is much better than that of neat NixPy but it is far behind the expected performance. Further, more research has been focused on Co doping over NixPy, which has proved to be best for HER. Bocheng Qiu et al. prepared nanocage-like structures of the Ni0.6Co1.4P composite by taking Cu2O as the template, as shown in Fig. 9a. As per their observation, the η10 value was found to be 300 mV with a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec−1 in alkaline medium (Fig. 9b and c), which was more efficient than that of pure Ni2P and CoP. The stability was measured by continuous testing for 10 h. As per the DFT analysis, the effective result is attributed to Co substitution in the nickel metal, which provides more active sites to adsorb more OH− ions, followed by oxidation to produce O2.215 Thus, it was found that the OER performance was not solely dependent on the amount of the metal but also depends on the tunable morphology and proper dispersion of metals. Since the homogeneous bimetallic nickel phosphides are free from undesired phase segregation, they enhance the charge transfer; however, they are difficult to obtain due to the complexity in preparing homo-bimetallic precursors.217 Thus, later, homogeneous doping of Co was obtained by taking a homogeneous precursor such as MOF/LDHs.187,217,218 As we have already explained the efficacy of these types of precursors in the upper section, more modification of the NiCoP composite was carried out to get a improved result by making a hybrid with some other materials.187,196,216–218 Here, it is observed that the Ni–CoP@C nanowire composites exhibited a low overpotential of 279 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 current density compared to other composites of NiCoP and the Tafel slope is found to be 54 mV dec−1. The carbon layer on the Ni–CoP nanowires has its own importance in retaining the morphology and core–shell structure, which is responsible for such an effective activity.216 In spite of all these, the surface high valence state Co species in NiCoP can be more easily oxidized to COOH and can act as surface active sites along with NiOOH, which are mainly responsible for the acceleration of water oxidation kinetics.

Tsang and his coworkers developed different homogeneous bimetallic nickel phosphides (NiMP, M = Co, Mn, Mo, Fe) through a simple wet chemical method. They found that among all the catalysts, Fe (d8) incorporation gives the best performance (η20 = 0.33 V, 39 mV dec−1) as Fe gives an appropriately balanced electron filling to the antibonding and bonding bands of NiP, resulting in optimal bonding interaction with M–O required for OER.190 Furthermore, Fe is also incorporated into the nickel phosphide with different Ni to Fe ratio and varied morphologies to enhance the activity. For example, Fe-doped NiP NSs in situ grown on Ni microwires {(Ni0.87Fe0.13P)2/Ni},213 defect rich Ni–Fe–P,219 Ni0.65Fe0.35P,220 Fe–NiOOH on Fe–Ni2P,221 and ternary nanocrystalline (Ni1−xFex)12P5 with adjustable Ni/Fe ratio.222 Moreover, a lot of work has also been reported on the NiFeP composite with an array-like structure deposited on different electrodes such as carbon cloth,223 carbon paper,224 and Ni foam.97,197 Hu and his coworkers developed iron-doped nickel phosphide arrays with different molar ratio over nickel foam without using any binder. However, among all these modifications, NiFe–P/NF (Fe:Ni = 3:7) reveales high performance in alkaline media by exhibiting an overpotential of 186 mV and 235 mV to reach the current density of 100 and 500 mA cm−2 with a very high TOF of 31.86 s−1, respectively. Also, the material exhibited OER performance in neutral pH containing phosphate buffer and produced 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 396 mV. This effectiveness of the catalyst is due to the array structure of the composite and the formation of Fe–Ni hydroxide on the surface of Ni–Fe–P during alkaline electrochemical experiment, which provides more surface area to carry out the OER activity (Fig. 9d and e).197 Moreover, Fe metal suppresses the Ni+2/Ni+3 oxidation peak, which is considered as a kinetic competitor of OER, whereas it introduces another peak of Ni+3/Ni+4, which helps in improving the catalytic activity and direct contact of the composite with the Ni foam electrode without having a binder blocking the actives sites.97,197 Besides this, some 3D microstructure-derived materials have also been explored, such as LDH-derived nanoflower-like NiFeP,204 (NixFe1−x)2P nanoflower,225 PBA- and MOF-derived Ni2P/(NiFe)2P(O)NA/NF,33 (Ni0.62Fe0.38)2P hollow nanocapsule,226 and NiFeP encapsulated with N, P, S-tri doped porous carbon (NiFePx@NPS-C).229 Benefiting from their 3D structure and exposed active sites, all of these materials excelled compared to pure nickel phosphide and the corresponding bimetallic hydroxides. In case of Ni2P/(NiFe)2P(O)NA/NF, the DFT calculation described that the incorporation of Fe atoms generates some new catalytically active sites near the Ni atoms in Ni2P, which induces the adsorption of O* and OH* species on Fe–Ni bridge and Fe–P–Fe hollow sites, respectively. Then, the OOH* species prefers to adsorb on the Fe atoms rather than on the Ni–Ni bridge sites. In addition, the Fe atoms and the coexistence of surface-doped O effectively diminish the free energy of the rate-limiting step, hence enhancing the OER by requiring only 260 mV of overpotential to deliver a current density of 500 mA cm−2.33 To discuss the morphology of the (NixFe1−x)2P nanoflower composite, the DFT pore size distribution describes that both the micropores and mesopores exist in this hybrid structure with an average pore width of 1.6 nm. Herein, the outstanding activity is due to the 3D hierarchically porous microflower structure with crosslinked nanoplates. This can expose more active sites and afford an easy pathway for charge transfer and mass transfer. This structure also expedites the facile release of O2.225 Further, the NiFeP composite has also been hybridized with other materials for the further enhancement of OER activity. Such hybrids are FeNiP–rGO,104 FeNiP@N-CF,227 and 3D graphene aerogel-supported NiFeP(NiFeP/GA).228
Apart from bimetallic nickel phosphide, the incursion of additional metal to obtain trimetallic nickel phosphides has also been explored. Xu et al. systematically studied the alkaline OER evolution of bimetal incorporation in NixPy, and they found that the trimetallic FeCoNiP excelled and produced 10 mA cm−2 current density at an overpotential of 200 mV.232 The order of OER activity of the corresponding monometallic, bimetallic, and trimetallic phosphides is FeP < NiP < CoP < FeNiP < FeCoP < CoNiP < FeCoNiP. These trimetallic phosphides facilitate the formation of M–OH and the chemical desorption of OH− groups due to the synergistic interaction occurring between the three metals.
Doping with another metal within the nickel phosphide matrix has attained a considerable attention but recently, some strain induced in NixPy through the doping of non-metals such as oxygen/sulphur has also been found to have a considerable effect on the narrowing of the overpotential required for OER. Oxygen-doped nickel iron phosphide nanocube arrays grown on Ni foam showed a great performance in OER for 100 h by requiring only 150 mV of overpotential to reach the benchmark current density with the Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1.33 This tremendous electrocatalytic activity is due to its porous structure and synergetic effect between Ni and Fe. Here also, the incorporation of Fe on Ni2P and the doping of oxygen on its surface generates more active sites (oxyphosphide) and decreases the energy barrier of the resultant intermediates and product, respectively. Further, Liu et al. synthesized properly interfaced intact Ni2P(O)/Fe2P(O) catalyst over NF, which results in high intrinsic OER activity due to the synergistic effect between the interfaces. It was also found that the in situ prepared oxyhydroxide and phosphate layers act as a proton-coupled electron mediator and accelerate the formation of the O–O bond. Hence, it lowers the kinetic barrier for OER. As a result, it shows the transformation of the M-Ni2P/Fe2P pre-catalyst to the M-Ni2P/Fe2P–O post-catalyst with active surface layers and conductive bulk phosphide (Fig. 9f).38 Likewise, Fu et al. developed a conductive 1D/1D heterostructure of nickel phosphide (dendride-like moieties on nanorod, as shown in Fig. 9g) with nickel sulphide (phosphosulphide) over nickel foam. The hybrid heterostructure provides smooth electron highway, guaranteeing fast charge transportation efficiency during electrocatalysis. In all the above cases, during the OER process, a thin layer of amorphous NiOOH/NiOx was formed, which enhanced the O–O bond formation, hence lowering the activation barrier for OER. This is the main reason for the acceleration of water oxidation kinetics. Thus, the best activity was observed as it required only 178 mV of overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9h).233 The detailed study of O2 evolution of different nickel-based catalysts is summarized in Table 5.

3.1.3. Overall water splitting. 
An overall water splitting unit contains a cathode, an anode, and a water electrolyzer. At the anode segment, water splits up into oxygen gas while producing proton and electrons, whereas in the cathode, hydrogen gases are evolved by the recombination of protons and electrons. Although the reaction requires only 1.23 V potential but practically, a much higher overpotential (>1.8 V) is required to carry out the necessary reaction.234 To enhance the conversion efficiency, an efficient electrocatalyst must be implemented that can lower the activation energy in the both the half cells. However, some catalysts such as sulphides and phosphides are more HER active, whereas oxide and hydroxides are more OER active and their performance is also dependable on the pH of the water electrolyzer. Therefore, the construction of resourceful bifunctional HER-OER heterostructures possessing binding force towards both hydrogen- and oxygen-containing intermediates is of immense interest, which can function in the same pH range so as to work simultaneously for improving the activity of overall water splitting. In addition, it is an advantage that using a single bifunctional HER-OER catalyst simplifies the overall electrolyzer system and lowers the cost. As the OER overpotential is much high as compared to that of HER, most inexpensive OER catalysts are very sensitive to acidic solutions, and at extremely high pH values, the conductivity of the electrolytes is higher than that of neutral electrolytes. Thus, it is more convenient and reasonable to perform overall water splitting in alkaline medium rather than in neutral or acidic medium.73 The mechanism of overall water splitting in acidic, basic, and neutral medium is as follows:235
Total reaction:  
In acidic solution
Cathode:2H+ + 2e− → H2
Anode:  
In alkaline or neutral solution
Cathode:2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−
Anode:  
3.1.3.1. Phase dependent nickel phosphides. 
Nickel-based materials have attracted broad interest as efficient HER and/or OER catalysts. Among them, nickel phosphide possesses many exceptional benefits because of its various nanostructures and physical properties.236 In the previous section, since we have already discussed the uses of nickel phosphide as an efficient individual HER and OER catalyst in a wide range of pH, thus, it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. In the recent literature reports, most of the neat nickel phosphides and their composites are now being treated as bifunctional electrocatalysts that can effectively reduce the overpotential for water splitting.237 However, their comparatively low OER performance, in comparison to non-noble metal OER catalysts such as NiFe LDH, limit their application as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting. Therefore, very few bifunctional nickel phosphides have been reported to date.238 For example, Ni5P4 NSs,239 Ni2P,71,199 Ni12P5,71 and Ni2P + Ni5P4 (ref. 234) have been developed, which perform both HER and OER activities. At first, Stern et al. developed Janus Ni2P that can serve as both cathode and anode along with served as a bifunctional catalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer, which generated 10 mA cm−2 at 1.63 V cell voltage.199 Further, it was found that Ni12P5 shows the best activity towards OER due to the presence of relatively more Ni metal content in this phase, which gets converted to Ni(OH)2/NiOOH on its surface. As a result, it leads to the production of more oxygen molecules in contrast to Ni2P, which shows the best performance in HER due to the existence of more P content on its surface that is responsible for producing more H2 molecules by trapping proton, being a slightly negative charged atom.71,234 Thus, P. W. Menezes et al. concluded that nickel phosphide loaded on NF showed better activity in comparison to FTO and the η10 value of Ni12P5/NF and Ni2P/NF was found to be 240 and 260 mV, respectively, towards OER and the η10 value of Ni2P/NF and Ni12P5/NF was found to be 85 and 170 mV, respectively, towards HER (Fig. 10a).71 They also observed a very low externally applied overpotential of 1.64 and 1.58 V for Ni12P5 and Ni2P at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 over 11 h, respectively (Fig. 10a). Thus, the use of nickel phosphide as a bifunctional catalyst, which can effectively reduce overpotential at both the half-cells, was concentrated. Li et al. synthesized a mixed phase metal-rich NixPy (Ni5P4 + Ni2P) through the facile solid phase phosphorization of the β-Ni(OH)2 nanoplate, which gave a low external applied potential of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm−2 over 60 h (Fig. 10b and c). As per the author's view, superior HER activity was obtained for NixPy-325 with a higher Ni5P4 amount due to the presence of more positively charged Ni sites; simultaneously, the in situ formation of NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 increases the OER efficiency. The overall water splitting and TEM image of NixPy-325 with the Ni(OH)2 precursor are shown in Fig. 10b.234

3.1.3.2. Immobilization of NixPy on conductive substrates or nanostructuring. 
Despite of these thrilling progresses, most of the designed bifunctional electrocatalysts still require a relatively higher overpotential to sustain a specific current density in comparison to that of the Pt/IrO2 couple. In order to further improve the catalytic reaction kinetics and energy efficiency of the overall water splitting reaction, catalysts were either prepared in substrates or derived from micro/nanostructures. The 3D hierarchically macroporous structure buffers the electrolyte to increase the ion mobility and facilitates the diffusion of gaseous H2 and O2 to utilize the active species more efficiently.73 MOF-derived carbon-confined nickel phosphide-based species have gained growing interest and achieved excellent electrocatalytic HER as well as OER performance. The enhancement in the activities is mainly due to the heteroatoms derived from MOF and the uniform dispersion of nickel phosphide with pores. These pores exist in both micro- and meso-forms, confirmed by pore size distribution evaluated from NLDFT, which act as active centers in the HER and OER catalyst. Thus, the efficiency of MOF-derived nickel phosphides have been well tested both as cathode and anode in water splitting.240 Yan et al. synthesized Ni2P dispersed in MOF-derived N and P-doped carbon matrix, which exhibited excellent HER as well as OER performance. They also found that in the alkaline electrolyzer, MOF-derived Ni2P acts both as a cathode and anode, and generates a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.62 V. Further, they implanted MOF-74-Ni into the GO matrix and phosphorized it to produce ultra-small nickel phosphide anchored on GO. The presence of a large active surface area, homogeneous carbon network, and perfect dispersity of the active species makes the electrocatalyst an efficient one towards both HER and OER. Furthermore, in the presence of an electrolyzer, Ni2P/rGO acts both as cathode and anode generating 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.61 V with excellent stability.236
Nickel foam electrodes were developed for the better enhancement of activity as the substrate itself provides a better conductive skeleton and proper dispersity of the active sites. Thus, numerous examples are there that represent the growth of nickel phosphides over nickel foam (NF) towards overall water splitting.73,241–244 In all the reported electrodes, urchin-like Ni2P/Ni/NF (as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 11a) show the evidence of best activity towards both HER and OER. For HER and OER, it required an overpotential of 96 mV and 200 mV, respectively, to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slope was 72 mV dec−1. Here, during OER, Ni2P/Ni/NF gets converted to NiO mainly on its surface to make a more active surface for OER and only 1.49 V cell voltage was required for 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium.73 Also, it was found that the Ni2P/Ni/NF electrode was very much stable after 20 h (Fig. 11b). Other substrates were also very effective in the enhancement of the electrochemical activities. Some nickel phosphides were prepared over other substrates such as carbon fibre,233 copper foil,246 and carbon cloth (CC).247 Wang et al. reported a scalable process to fabricate a self-supported 3D carbon fibre paper (CP) electrode combined with Ni–P nanosheets (vertically aligned) acting as a bifunctional electrocatalyst towards OER and HER, as shown in the SEM image (Fig. 11c). They observed that the self-supported 3D CP@Ni–P NS electrode can be directly used either as a cathode to carry out HER or as an anode to carry out OER. Further, it can also be used as both a cathode and an anode in an alkaline electrolyzer, thus demonstrating superior catalytic activity and excellent long-term stability (Fig. 11f). This reported noble-metal-free electrocatalyst worked with a high value of energy efficiency, i.e., 91.0% at 10 mA cm−2 for 100 h without any noticeable change in its performance (Fig. 11d and e).245

Moreover, a novel, free standing electrode was developed by Peng and his coworkers, where nickel phosphide NPs embedded in N and P co-doped porous carbon (NPC) was in situ synthesized on carbon cloth. This Ni2P@NPC@CC electrode worked as both an anode and a cathode, and achieved 10 mA cm−2 at a small bias of 1.54 V for overall water splitting.247 Moreover, the Ni2P/NiCo2O4 material was developed with a unique morphology for better water splitting, wherein Ni2P nanosheets grew on NiCo2O4 nanocone array to form a core–shell like structure. Due to the synergetic effects between Ni2P and NiCo2O4, excellent activity was observed as it required 250 and 45 mV of overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 of current density for OER and HER, respectively, with a cell voltage of 1.59 V.248
3.1.3.3. Different cation- and anion-doped nickel phosphides. 
Besides this, bimetallic phosphides comprising nickel metal with the addition or doping of different metals such as Fe,106,249–260 Co,76,109,113,118,263–270 Mo,271–273 V,274 and Cu275 have been developed for improving the activity of overall water splitting. It is extremely beneficial to develop NiFe-based phosphides for overall water splitting by merging the benefits of NiFe-based materials for OER and the phosphides for HER application.249 Moreover, we have already discussed in the upper sections that the doping of Fe has a huge impact on the activity of nickel–iron phosphide towards OER as OER is a major bottleneck that decreases the efficiency of overall water splitting. In light of the literatures that have been reported recently, the use of iron-doped nickel phosphide acting both as a cathode and an anode simultaneously has been widely explored. Some examples are NixFeyPz249–252 and NiFeP nanosheets supported on sponge-like strutted graphene (NiFeP/SG).253 Simply by doping iron onto the nickel-based microstructures and their conversion into their corresponding phosphides reduces the overpotential required for water splitting to some extent. Xuan et al. reported PBA-derived NiFeP towards full water splitting, operating at a cell voltage of 1.67 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2.249 In the latest literature, NiFeP grown on different matrix electrodes got considerable attention. Moreover, most of the Fe-doped nickel phosphides loaded on a proper substrate, i.e., nickel foam, have been reported.254–259 This is because the nickel foam not only provides an additional nickel precursor but also provides a uniform conductive skeletal. Xuan et al. synthesized 3D porous intertwined nanosheet of NiFeP supported on NF and found that a cell voltage of 1.48 V was sufficient to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a stability of up to 200 h.256 Further, NiFeP growth on other substrate such as a stainless steel mesh also gave an appreciable results. It was found that NiFeP loaded on 304-type stainless steel mesh unveiled the best activity with respect to both OER and HER as it required only 225 and 400 mV of overpotentials, respectively, to reach the large amount of current density of 500 mA cm−2. Here, DFT shows that the Fe dopant can enhance the adsorption of OER intermediates (OH*, OOH*, O*) on Ni2P and oxidize the Ni2P surface; it also reduces the required adsorption energy. Besides, Fe sites show better affinity towards H2O adsorption than Ni sites, and H2O is sensitive to the content of the Fe dopant. Only a small amount of Fe is required for its effective adsorption on the Ni2P surface so as to facilitate the HER mechanism. Thus, it is found that this composite with high Fe dopant content on the Ni2P surface shows comparably better performance for OER, whereas with low Fe dopant content, it shows comparably better performance towards HER. It exhibited overall water splitting voltages of 1.80, 1.84, and 1.89 V to achieve the current densities of 100, 200, and 500 mA cm−2, respectively.260
The composite Ni2P/FeP supported of 3D Ni foam manifests excellent activities towards overall water splitting by employing 10 mA cm−2 of the current density. It necessitated a very low overpotential of 14 mV and 154 mV with the Tafel slopes of 24.2 and 22.7 mV dec−1 for HER and OER, respectively, in alkaline electrolyte. In term of stability, it can stay stable for 40 h at a current density of 500 mA cm−2, while it requires only 1.42 and 1.72 V cell voltage to afford 10 mA cm−2 and 500 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. This is considerably lesser than that of the coupled benchmark IrO2–Pt catalysts (1.57 V) and superior to most previously reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. The comparison of cell voltage of FeP/Ni2P with different materials in different alkaline water electrolyzers and the comparison of the current densities at 1.7 V with non-noble metal electrocatalysts is shown in Fig. 12a and b. Herein, the excellent activity is explained on the basis of DFT calculations, which elucidates that the FeP (001) and (010) planes are chosen to be placed on the top of the Ni2P (100) plane separately to minimize the percent changes in both Ni2P and FeP. As a result, the hydrogen adsorption free energy was reduced to only 0.06 eV, which makes it more suitable for HER.255

From the DFT calculations, it was found that Co doping in nickel phosphide also induces moderate hydrogen adsorption and facile desorption of H2 when the highly active sites of the surface are poisoned, thereby increasing the catalytic activity towards HER.118 Thus, different types of Ni–Co–P catalysts were reported towards overall water splitting. In some cases, cobalt was substituted in the nickel phosphide matrix261–266 and in some, low content of nickel metals substituted cobalt from the cobalt phosphide matrix.76,267,268 Yet, the efficiencies are still quite high for activity towards both HER and OER because of the possible synergistic interaction between Ni and Co. The Ni sites present on the surface hasten water dissociation efficiently, whereas the Co sites facilitate gas generation and release.267 Fu et al. fabricated a new form of skutterudite-type ternary cobalt nickel phosphide (Co1−xNixP3) nanoneedle arrays (NAs) on carbon cloth. Herein, the effectiveness of Ni doping amount was studied using DFT calculations and it was found that a very small amount of Ni doping (Co0.93Ni0.07P3) could tune the electronic properties of the parent CoP3 with the optimization of the hydrogen adsorption free energy. This led to good catalytic activity towards HER (η10 = 87 mV) as well as towards OER (η20 = 221 mV).76 Yan et al. further reported another nickel-doped cobalt phosphide (Co4Ni1P nanotubes) that acted as both a cathode and an anode in the presence of an alkaline electrolyzer, yielding 1.59 V of cell voltage.267 Jothi et al. proposed an interesting approach by taking scrap Cu substrate and deposited amorphous nickel cobalt phosphide films; the scrap copper wires are well-proficient for catalyzing H2 and O2 evolution reaction at low overpotentials (η10-HER = 178 mV, η10-OER = 220 mV), which significantly promotes water catalysis reaction at 1.59 V@10 mA cm−2. Here, the copper substrate makes for easy and fast electron transfer and reduces the contact resistance between the electrocatalyst and the current collector. Thus, this system provided an interesting approach for designing of an eco-friendly low-cost electrocatalyst for water splitting.266
Later, NiCoP was modified with different carboneous materials such as r-GO,112 graphene quantum dots,269 graphene dots,270etc. Among them, it was found that the modification of the graphene dots was the best one, which necessitates a very low cell voltage of 1.54 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline medium.
MoP has also been considered as an efficient catalyst for HER similar to nickel phosphide. Thus, different studies have been carried out by incorporating Mo in nickel phosphide.271–273 It was found that NiMoP with a proper interface between MoP and Ni2P enhances the efficiency towards water splitting and the material developed over nickel foam exhibited a cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm−2.271 Likewise, vanadium(V) has a significant effect on doping in nickel phosphide. Thus, Qingyu Yan and his coworkers treated Ni2P with O2 plasma and V doping, where 10% V-doped Ni2P treated with O2 for 3 min showed superior activity in 1 M KOH by attaining the η10 value of 108 mV and 275 mV with a Tafel slope of 72.3 and 43.5 mV dec−1 for HER and OER, respectively. This excellent activity was studied by DFT and it was found that the V doping with oxygen incorporation enhances the charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, the charge density distribution analysis revealed that the Ni sites became more active towards OH− adsorption due to the presence of Ni–V co-electron deficiency centers.274
Since the incorporation of Co has a positive effect on HER and Fe has a pronounced effect on OER, thus both Fe and Co can be incorporated into nickel phosphide to achieve efficiency towards water splitting. Thus, for the first time, Ray et al. developed a tri-metallic Ni-based phosphide over carbon cloth, as shown in Fig. 12c,237 and found the best performance towards both HER and OER due to the following points: (i) similar distribution of all the elements, (ii) quick charge transformation capability imparted by the open spaces between the nanoplates, and (iii) the self-standing feature. As per the studies, this hybrid material required only 39 mV and 275 mV of overpotential to reach both the cathodic and anodic current densities of 10 mA cm−2 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slopes for HER and OER were found to be 50 and 56 mV dec−1, respectively. Furthermore, the two assembled electrodes needed 1.51 V of cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 of current density with a stability resistance of 150 h, as shown in Fig. 12d and e.237 Recently, another tri-metallic Ni-based phosphide, i.e., NiMoFeP was fabricated by Baek et al., who observed that a very low cell voltage of 1.45 V was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting.276
Different anions also substitute P in metal phosphide to form oxyphosphides and phosphosulphides, and it has been researched thoroughly. As per the DFT calculation, the mutual anion substitution modifies their electronic structure, tunes the hydrogen and H2O adsorption free energy; consequently, a dramatic enhancement of the catalytic performance could be expected.265 Thus, various works have been done by tuning the sulphur277–279 or oxygen280 amount. Finally, it was concluded that sulphides have noteworthy influence on the cell voltage. Zeng et al. reported the Ni3S2/Ni2P/NF electrode aligned at a proper interface at their corresponding phosphide and sulphide units (Fig. 12g), which drives the overall water splitting reaction at a very low cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 12f). Herein, the DFT calculation illustrates the strong coupling interactions in Ni–S–P that synergistically optimize the electronic structure and reduce the hydrogen (or water) adsorption energy, thus appreciably enhancing the overall water splitting.279
All the bifunctional catalysts showed satisfactory results in alkaline medium. Apart from this, no work had been reported using nickel-based bifunctional catalysts towards overall water splitting. Although it is intriguing that nickel phosphide compounds benefit neutral-pH HER/OER processes, they often run at an excess thermodynamic cost. Thus, cost-effective NiP capable of catalyzing HER and OER simultaneously at a low overpotential at pH 7 in water have been rarely developed, giving rise to a great challenge for the large-scale utilization of neutral-pH water electrolysis technique. For the first time, Wu et al. reported ternary Ni0.1Co0.9P porous nanosheets loaded on carbon fibre paper, which can drive overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.81 V.263
The detailed study of both H2 generation and O2 evolution by various nickel phosphide-based materials has been listed in Table 6.

3.2 Photocatalysis
Although different methods are being adopted to avoid energy crisis, currently, water splitting is the only efficient solution to address these issues. The prominent methods used by the scientific communities include electrochemical water splitting, and photoelectrochemical and powdered photocatalytic water splitting. The photoelectrochemical process necessitates an external applied bias, an expensive silver and platinum electrode, and a complicated cell set up. Though, the use of low-cost material as a catalyst reduces the experimental cost for the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting, still more attempts are always bordered by the electrode-exposed surface area. On the contrary, the powdered photocatalytic systems are cost effective and are comprised of a quartz batch reactor fitted with a light source, which successfully carries the water redox reaction towards energy production.282 Similar to electrochemical water splitting, photocatalytic water splitting also comprises of hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water splitting. In the case of photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation reactions, special scavengers are used such as methanol, TEOA, lactic acid/AgNO3, and FeCl3. The electron and hole scavengers are used to capture the desired holes/electrons during the corresponding half reactions, as shown in the following the equations.2834H+ + 4e− → 2H2 (reduction reaction)2H2O + 4h+ → 4H+ + O2 (oxidation reaction)
H2 production half reaction in the presence of a sacrificial reagent, taking CH3OH as an example:6H+ + 6e− → 3H2 (reduction reaction)H2O + CH3OH + 6h+ → CO2 + 6H+ (oxidation reaction)
O2 evolution half reaction in the presence of a sacrificial reagent, taking Ag+ as an example:4Ag+ + 4e− → 4Ag (reduction reaction)2H2O + 4h+ → 4H+ + O2 (oxidation reaction)
Moreover, in order to carry out photocatalytic water splitting, proper semiconductor photocatalysts are required such as metal oxides, metal sulphides, metal carbides, and (oxy) nitrides284 but they all lack in some essential criteria to carry out the reaction as a single semiconductor. These single semiconductors always have large surface overpotentials for water oxidation or reduction, which need to be compensated with extra photovoltage or by the application of external bias. Thus, photocatalytic systems are generally hybridized with other semiconductors or co-catalysts.
The high performance of TMP materials towards HER makes them potential co-catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. It is also valuable to note that the P content plays a vital role in the bandgap adjustment of metal phosphides by limiting the electron delocalization. Therefore, choosing metal phosphides with appropriate P content has a great prospect for achieving photocatalytic hydrogen.3 TMPs or transition metal-based hybrids have been accomplished for UV/solar-driven photocatalysis not only in energy production but also for environmental pollution management. Photocatalytic H2 evolution from water by visible-light irradiation via Ni2P, CoP, and Cu3P is considered to be a key pathway. Nickel phosphide shows photocatalytic activity by itself similar to pure Ni12P5; it has shown good activity towards H2 generation with the rate of 10760 μmol h−1 g−1 along with a TOF of 9.3 h−1.285 But somehow, due its very low bandgap (1 eV), the obtained result for H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) is not so appreciable.39 Thus, integrating it on a photocatalytic semiconductor as a co-catalyst can improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Basically, three factors play an important role in improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production, i.e., (i) improved light absorption, (ii) effectual charge carrier separation, and (iii) fast charge transfer at the interface.84 The Ni–P co-catalyst traps the electron from the surface of the photocatalyst due to the metallic characteristics of metal phosphide having lower absorption energy on its surface286 and the presence of the P site, which consequently plays a major role in accepting H+ and reducing it to H2. Therefore, as electrons transfer becomes fastest in a suitable medium, good charge separation is created with the lowering of activation energy287 that avoids electron–hole pair recombination. Moreover, as the P site is responsible for H2 generation, with increasing P ratio, the activity also increases.288 Besides this, more surface area of the co-catalyst with spatial charge separation surface reaction is accelerated, which boosts the photocatalytic activity.289

3.2.1. Modification with metal sulphides. 
So far, nickel phosphides have been incorporated in a limited number of metal sulphides such as CdS,7,39,115,290 MoS2,291 CaIn2S4,116 and ZnIn2S4.286 Cao et al. incorporated for the first time polydisperse Ni2P into a semiconductor (CdS NRs) and found a very exciting result in the presence of lactic acid as a sacrificial electron donor. After 20 h of visible light irradiation, the optimum H2 evolution rate and turn over number (TON) value for the resulting system (7.0 × 10−4 M CdS NRs, 1.0 × 10−6 M Ni2P NPs) reached to 34800 μmol h−1 g−1 and 26300, respectively. The turn over frequency (TOF) value was calculated as 2110 h−1 at a pH of 3.7 Later, the H2 activity drops down under the same pH condition. After more than 100 h of irradiation, on adding aliquots of the CdS photoabsorber, the Ni2P NPs still retain exceptional catalytic activity. Du's group fabricated Ni2P as a co-catalyst in one-dimensional CdS nanorod, which improved the efficiency and durability of photogenerated hydrogen from water in the presence of mixed sulphide–sulphite sacrificial agent.39 They found that with 0.5 wt% of Ni2P on CdS NR in 0.75 M Na2S and 1.05 M Na2SO3, the highest H2 generation rate reached ∼553000 μmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 13b), where the TON and TOF were observed to be 3270000 and 36400 in 90 h, respectively. The AQY was 41% at 450 nm. Compared to the Ni2P/CdS nanoparticles, the NiP/CdS nanorod structure showed better activity due to higher specific surface area of the CdS nanorod, which provided more active sites for the interfacial reaction to enhance the photocatalytic activity, as shown in the Fig. 13a. Moreover, Ni2P, which acts as a scavenger to trap electrons from the CdS surface to produce molecular hydrogen and sacrificial agents, consumes holes generated in the VB of CdS. Then, Limin Song et al. developed a bimetallic nickel-based phosphide as a co-catalyst and integrated it in CdS photocatalyst to significantly improve the activity and durability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) in water splitting.290 They found that the PHE rate was raised to 28412.6 μmol h−1 g−1 with an optimum 8 wt% of NiCoP loading, which is about 361 times higher than that of 1 wt% Pt/CdS (78.8 μmol h−1 g−1); the observed AQY was 36.8% in 100 h, which was evidence that the NiCoP in CdS is extremely stable. Recently, Peifang Wang and Yanhui Ao group's modified CdS NRs with thin carbon coating and then loaded Ni2P as a co-catalyst on it to fabricate CdS@C/Ni2P,292 where the carbon layer prevented photocorrosion and Ni2P drew photogenerated electrons towards itself, thereby providing more active sites for H2 generation (32030 μmol h−1 g−1 with 5 wt% of Ni2P, which is 19 times as high as that of pure CdS). Later, Shao et al.293 and Dai et al.294 prepared the same composite of Ni2P/Zn0.5Cd0.5S with different methodology, where Dai et al. revealed the high activity of the composite with 1173 μmol h−1 g−1 of PHE, which is 13 times superior than that of pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S.294

Ni2P is also used as a co-catalyst in ZnIn2S4 (ref. 286) and CaIn2S4 (ref. 116) photocatalysts, showing photocatalytic H2 generation activity of 2066 μmol h−1 g−1 and 486 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. In the case of Ni2P/ZnIn2S4, two types of morphology of Ni2P were taken into consideration, i.e., 0D and 2D, and high H2 generation was shown by the 2D morphology of Ni2P. In short, the 2D structure of Ni2P shows better activity as compared to the 0D nanoparticles structure due to lower overpotential and smaller charge transfer resistance. Furthermore, in the 2D–2D Ni2P/ZnIn2S4 nanohybrid, a large contact area with shorter transmission distance of the charges was exhibited, which improves the charge separation and interfacial charge transfer.286
A ternary nanohybrid CdS/MoS2@Ni2P was prepared by Tae Kyu Kim and his coworker with the aim to modify the CdS photocatalyst using MoS2 and Ni2P as the co-catalyst.291 As reported earlier, bare MoS2 and Ni2P cannot show appreciable activity; rather, on integrating with CdS, the activity of (2%) MoS2/CdS increases from 37370 μmol h−1 g−1 to 72760 μmol h−1 g−1 with 3 wt% of Ni2P loading. The AQE was observed to be 24.4% for the optimum photocatalyst.


3.2.2. Modification with carbon derivatives. 
In light of the high number of reports demonstrating the loading of nickel phosphide over a metal-free semiconductor such as g-C3N4, in comparison to other semiconductors, pure g-C3N4 has many advantages, such as the visible-light absorption, chemical and thermal stability, non-toxicity, and abundant availability of raw materials on earth. However, g-C3N4 generally suffers from very low quantum efficiency in various kinds of photocatalysis.114 Thus, a lot of work has been done by taking Ni2P as a co-catalyst over g-C3N4 through different preparation methods and by just varying the Ni2P loading weight percentage (wt%).9,84,94,288,295–297 For the first time, Wen et al. modified g-C3N4 with a very efficient H2 evolution co-catalyst Ni12P5 through a simple grinding strategy. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 126.61 μmol g−1 h−1 was attained by loading 2.0% Ni12P5 nanoparticles over the g-C3N4 surface, which is about 269.4 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4. It was believed that the Ni12P5 nanoparticles present on the g-C3N4 surface act as significant active sites, thus facilitating the charge transfer and subsequent hydrogen production from the water reduction reaction.114 Lu et al.94 and Zheng et al.84 reported on the 0D(Ni2P)–2D(g-C3N4) heterojunction. They observed high photocatalytic performance only due to the well-contacted 0D–2D heterojunction interfaces, which facilitated photogenerated charge separation and ensured high activity. Thus, on loading 3.5 wt% of Ni2P NPs over g-C3N4 NSs, the H2 generation rate was found to 474.4 μmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of 10 vol% of TEOA (sacrificial agent), which is better than g-C3N4/Pt. Also, it was confirmed that the activity of Ni2P as a co-catalyst was even more efficient than that of noble metal-like Pt.84 Excellent hydrogen evolution was recognized by photoexcited charge transfer from g-C3N4 to Ni2P and by suppressing the electron–hole pair recombination on its surface.295 Mesoporous g-C3N4 combined with Ni2P (Ni2P-sg-CN) was prepared by the sol–gel method with 2 wt% of Ni2P loading, which showed the best photocatalytic performance (440 μmol h−1 g−1 of H2 with 4.8% of AQY) and good stability compared to the physical mixture of Ni2P and sg-CN.9 Here, Indira et al. found a broad EPR signal (g = 2.22), indicating the formation of ferromagnetic Ni0 particles under the reaction conditions. This could be due to the surface oxidation of the Ni0 particles, forming a Ni2+ surface and a Ni0 core, which is quite helpful for H2 evolution. Ramireddy Boppella et al. modified 2D g-C3N4 slightly by integrating 2D black phosphorus and Ni2P simultaneously. He observed that the HER was found to be 852.2 μmol h−1 g−1 with 2 wt% loading of Ni2P@BP, which is nearly 50- and 5-fold higher compared to pristine CN and Pt/CN, respectively, with excellent stability and 2.8% of AQE.297 This enhancement in the activity is due to the synergetic effect between BP and Ni2P, where BP had superior electron mobility in accelerating the charge transfer/separation by facilitating the movement of photogenerated electrons from CN to the co-catalyst Ni2P surface, as shown in Fig. 13c, which was confirmed from the PL (Fig. 13d) and TRPL (Fig. 13e) spectra, and the active sites present on Ni2P reduce the proton to form H2 molecules.
Furthermore, some more phases of nickel phosphide such as Ni12P5 (ref. 114) and Ni3P298 along with the Ni2P phase were integrated with g-C3N4, where the Ni2P phase was observed to be the most proficient among all the other phases. Sun et al. studied the phase dependent nickel phosphide co-catalyst loading on g-C3N4 and found that among the three different NixPy (Ni2P, Ni12P5, and Ni3P), Ni2P/g-C3N4 showed the highest photocatalytic activity.298 Moreover, NixPy with a higher phosphorus ratio can accelerate the charge transfer and provides more Ni–P bonds, leading to a preferable hydrogen generation performance. For the first time, Yuming Dong et al. gave a report on the synthesis of NixP-20/g-C3N4via a photochemical method, where 20 refers to the illumination time and maximum H2 generation rate of 8585 μmol g−1 h−1 (318 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4) that occurred in the presence of TEOA, methanol, and lactate acid (hole scavengers).92 More importantly, intrinsic acid-resistant properties exhibited by NixP and g-C3N4 resulted in excellent photocatalytic activity towards H2 evolution in an acidic solution of pH = 2 for 75 h.
Further, the modification of g-C3N4 was done by applying ternary nickel phosphide-like NiCoP as the co-catalyst. Even though it has better activity in electrocatalysis towards HER, recently, Lingling Bi et al. tested it for photocatalytic activity by preparing NiCoP/g-C3N4, which showed an H2 evolution rate of 1643 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 21 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. NiCoP showed better conductivity for charge transfer corresponding to the high reduction of proton.299
In addition, nickel phosphide-g-C3N4-based ternary materials have also been synthesized for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Zhixiao Qin et al. constructed a novel 1D Ni2P–Cd0.9Zn0.1S/g-C3N4 heterostructure for hydrogen evolution with a very high AQE of 73.2% at 420 nm.300 Here, the efficient spatial charge separation with accelerated surface reaction was induced by Ni2P, which boosted the hydrogen evolution rate to nearly 2100.3 μmol h−1 g−1 (17 times higher than that of Cd0.9Zn0.1S/g-C3N4). The protective layer of g-C3N4 on the metal sulfide collected the holes from the Cd0.9Zn0.1S surface to effectively reduce the photocorrosion of Cd0.9Zn0.1S, which led to better stability of 90 h with continuous irradiation of visible light.
Furthermore, Ni2P can combine with MOF photocatalysts. For example, the Ni2P/MIL-125-NH2 composite was synthesized by Stavroula Kampouri et al., describing the effect of Ni2P (with different wt% loading) on MOF towards photocatalytic activity.80 They found that Ni2P with 9.2 (±0.4) wt% loading, with CH3CN and TEA (sacrificial agent) in water, H2 generation was maximized to 894 μmol h−1 g−1 with the highest AQY of 27 and 6.6% at 400 and 450 nm, respectively, which is 300 times greater than that of pristine MIL-125-NH2 (2.249 μmol h−1 g−1) due to the efficient photogenerated electron transfer from MIL-125-NH2 to Ni2P. Li Wu et al. for the first time described the use of MOF (UiO-66) as an electron transfer bridge for transferring charge carriers from the dye photosensitizer (erythrosin B) to the co-catalyst (Ni2P) for PHE.301 The strong pi–pi interactions with suitable energy band position and high absorption capacity of erythrosin B provided the MOF as an appropriate medium to accept electron from itself and to transfer it to Ni2P due to the close adherence with MOF, which resulted in an H2 production rate of 65 μmol h−1 g−1 on the loading of 0.69 wt% of Ni2P.


3.2.3. Modification with metal oxides. 
In 2016, Yubin Chen and Zhixiao Qin jointly first reported on the use of Ni2P as a co-catalyst on TiO2 nanorod for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen generation (PHE) using methanol as a sacrificial agent.302 They observed that the PHE was enhanced to 9.38 μmol h−1 g−1 after loading 0.4 wt% of Ni2P on TiNR, which is 85 times higher than that of pure TiNR (0.11 μmol h−1 g−1) with 11.6% apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 360 nm. Dengwei Jing and coworkers used Ni2P and NiCoP as co-catalysts on TiO2 for PHE287 and found that NiCoP/TiO2 showed better activity than Ni2P/TiO2 by producing 1540 μmol h−1 g1 of photocatalytic H2 with 1 wt% of NiCoP loading. A ternary hybrid was prepared by Mao Wu, where NixP was loaded on nitrogen doped TiO2 combined with the g-C3N4 heterojunction.95 As a result of NixP loading with 20 min of illumination, the H2 evolution rate reached 5438 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 7.5 times higher than that of TCN-20. Here, the electron transfer mechanism can be explained as follows: the photogenerated electrons are transferred from the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 to the CB of N–TiO2 and then to NixP, where the electrons get accumulated and participate in hydrogen production reaction. On the other hand, the holes are transferred from the valence band (VB) of N–TiO2 to the VB of g-C3N4, where the holes are scavenged by TEOA and oxidized to TEOA+. In 2017, for the first time, Juan Xie et al. implemented amorphous NiP as a co-catalyst on strontium titanate (SrTiO3 or STO) photocatalyst.303 The result was observed for Ni2P/STO-10 with 10 min of chemical plating time; 2142 μmol h−1 g−1 of H2 was evolved, which is 3 times higher than that of pure STO. Moreover, with longer time duration of chemical plating (more than the optimal time), the H2 generation decreased. Recently, MOF-derived C–ZrO2 photocatalyst was prepared by Jixiang Xu et al. and they further combined it onto g-C3N4 and loaded it with the Ni2P co-catalyst.304 As a result, the PHE rate reached 10040 μmol h−1 g−1 with 20 wt% of Ni2P loading; the AQE was found to be 35.5% at 420 nm.
To date, no report regarding photocatalytic O2 evolution using nickel phosphide-based hybrids had been published. Zhixiao Qin et al. first developed a composite of NiCoP@NiCo–Pi/g-C3N4 for both O2 and H2 evolution, where the NiCoP co-catalyst exhibited a core–shell structure (Fig. 14a and b). Here, NiCoP was the core and was surrounded by the NiCo–Pi shell. The NiCoP cores were responsible for hydrogen generation in the presence of the sacrificial agent K2HPO4 with TEOA, which increased the PHE rate to 1709.3 μmol h−1 g−1 with an AQE of 9.4% at 420 nm (Fig. 14c). Moreover, the NiCo–Pi shells were responsible for oxygen evolution in the presence of AgNO3 as a sacrificial agent at the rate of 312 μmol h−1 g−1 and an AQE of 0.6% (Fig. 14d). According to the study, it was revealed that the composite showed the best stability in K2HPO4, where HPO4− enhanced the reduction of the proton with the better oxidation of TEOA, for which the activity rapidly increased from 534.2 to 1709.3 μmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of K2HPO4.305 The mechanism suggested that for photocatalytic H2 evolution, the photo-induced electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 were transferred to the Fermi level of NiCoP and reduced the protons to hydrogen on the active sites, whereas Ni(II) and Co(II) ions in NiCo–P captured the photo-induced holes created in the VB of g-C3N4 and converted them to higher valence Ni and Co ions, resulting in the proficient separation of charges. These higher valence Ni and Co ions [probably Ni(IV), Co(III), Co(IV)] induced water oxidation to generate oxygen and thereafter, they were reduced to their lower valence states (Fig. 14e).

3.3. Photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC)
Photoelectrochemical water splitting proffers a promising pathway towards sustainable energy production using water and sunlight as the solitary inputs. Two types of systems are generally used for PEC: one is the combination of well-known solar panels with the electrochemical device and the second one is a single unit that could perform both light absorption and water splitting. Generally, in the first system, energy is generated in photovoltaic cells and further, this energy is utilized to carry out water splitting in another device; hence, the efficiency is severely narrowed down. Thus, the later device should be more energy efficient; therefore, different photoelectrochemical setups and efficient photoelectrocatalysts are being vigorously researched.2 For the efficient photoelectrocatalysis of water, the following criteria must be achieved: (1) the light absorption range should be broad, for which sunlight can be utilized properly; (2) proficient charge transfer should occur from the bulk to the surface of the photocathode; (3) fast consumption of photogenerated carriers to carry out an efficient surface reaction that requires minimum overpotential; (4) excellent stability and durability. The drawbacks that limit the utility of the photoelectrode are mainly due to the following reasons: (1) electron and hole recombination at the interface or within the semiconductor, (2) photo-corrosive nature of the semiconductor, and (3) the sluggish reaction kinetics of redox water splitting. These challenges have to be conquered by giving priority to scalable photoelectrochemical systems. The decisive factor is the availability of an appropriate semiconductor/electrocatalyst couple that can achieve better light harvesting, restrict charge carrier recombination, and improve surface reactions such as H2 and O2 evolution.314–316 At present, Pt/IrO2 and RuO2 group metals are the best available HER/OER electrocatalysts and their integration with photocathodes/anode boosts the PEC performance; however, their scarcity in accessibility renders them impractical for large-scale energy generation. Thus, the search for a low-cost alternative with high HER activity and sturdiness is an ongoing endeavor.
Nickel phosphide-based materials have been studied in the field of PEC for water splitting by deposition onto an Si substrate or integration with a different photocathode. Huang et al. deposited nickel phosphides (20 nm) for the first time on the surface of Si nanowires such as Ni12P5/SiNWs, as shown in Fig. 15b, to carry out photoelectrolysis, which resulted in 2.97% photo conversion efficiency (PCE), which is higher than that of unmodified SiNWs (0.0845%) and Pt (2.73%).50 In particular, with an increase in the loading amount of the Ni12P5 nanoparticles, the PCE first increases and decreases further with the increasing amount of Ni12P5 nanoparticles. With the increasing amount of Ni12P5 nanoparticles, the available active sites for HER increase and possibly shield incident illumination. Optimal PCE was obtained from the sample loaded with 0.4 mg cm−2 of Ni12P5 nanoparticles. Thus, as compared to SiNWs, Ni12P5/SiNWs showed the best activity in photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (Fig. 15a). They hereafter stated that the PEC activity can be further increased by the introduction of an n+ layer in the Si substrate. In light of this, Chen et al. prepared a photocathode by depositing an NiP2 layer on the surface of the Ti-modified n+p-Si substrate by the direct phosphorization of the pre-deposited Ni layer.315 They concluded that there must be a balance between the loading of the co-catalyst and the optical transparency because the thickness of the pre-deposited Ti and Ni layers has a great impact on the PEC activity. The photocathodes pn+-Si/Ti/NiP2 delivered a photo current density of 12 mA cm−2 at zero potential, were active in both acidic and neutral (0.35 V and 19 mA cm−2) electrolytes, where they retained nearly all of their PEC activities after 6 h of continuous performance. The half-cell solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency was calculated to be 2.6%. The high PEC activity was attributed to the pyramidal textured pn+-Si buried junction (Fig. 15c) and the coupling between the co-catalyst NiP2 and the substrate, which supplies larger built-in potential to improve the photogenerated charge carrier separation. Further, Mondal et al. constructed a p–n junction by depositing n-type Ni2P over p-type Si substrate; an optimized 10 mA cm−2 cathodic photocurrent was generated at 0.05 V (vs. RHE) with a reasonably positive onset potential.317 Further, to overcome the photo-corrosive nature of the Cu2O photocathode, an appropriate amount of NixPy was deposited over the material. The maximum current density of 3.2 mA cm−2 was obtained from Cu2O–CuO–NixPy at 0 V vs. RHE. The heterojunction photocathode was highly photostable due to the production of CuO, which inhibits the further corrosion of Cu2O, while NixPy is solely responsible for the enhancement of the PEC activity.316

Similar to the photocathode, NixPy has also been used as a photoanode for the enhancement of the water oxidation process. At first, Bu et al. reported a Ti4+-modified Fe2O3 photoanode, where they deposited Ni2P over the material by the drop-casting method. It was found that once the photogenerated holes were transferred from the Ti–Fe2O3 substrate to the surface of the Ni2P nanoparticles, they could rapidly get across and arrive at the surface of the Ni2P particles, thus suppressing the back reaction. As compared to Ti–Fe2O3, the Ni2P-loaded Ti–Fe2O3 photoanode showed a water oxidation onset potential at 0.82, cathodically shifted by 0.14 V, and at 1.23 V, the current density was nearly two times higher than that of the parent photoanode.318 Masaki Saruyama et al. reported a water oxidation catalyst, i.e., the NiPx@FePyOz/BiVO4 composite, and used it as a photoanode for water oxidation. On the loading of NiPx@FePyOz over BiVO4, the charge transfer efficiency (η surface) increased from 40% to 70% at 1.23 V vs. RHE and the current density reached 2.3 mA cm−2, which is twice that of bare BiVO4 (1.1 mA cm−2). Even at a lower potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE, the η surface was greatly enhanced from 9% to 58%, thus establishing it as a fast OER co-catalyst and the stability was tested by 62% of photocurrent retention for 3 h at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 15f). The photocurrent density of bare and NPs-loaded BiVO4 in 0.125 M K2B4O7 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was measured before and after CA (Fig. 15e). It was found that the CA measurement endorsed the alteration of the NiPx@FePyOz NPs into (Ni, Fe)OxHy (Fig. 15d) and also validated that NiPx@FePyOz augmented the OER activity in 0.125 M K2B4O7.224

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we summarized nickel phosphide, a promising electrocatalyst/co-catalyst that is drawing hot-spot attention in energy applications. The in situ studies endeavor to summarize the recent advances of nickel phosphide in their synthetic strategies, particularly, morphological and phase dependent design guidelines and our understanding of how catalytic (electro and photo) water splitting proceeds under the operational conditions. Such studies subsequently emphasized on the following points: firstly, in the molecular structure framework, the appearance of metallic-ionic bonding in metal-rich nickel phosphide with high P/Ni ratio is beneficial for corrosion resistance, whereas the surface metallic nickel and P–P linkage moiety is crucial for catalytic performance. Secondly, the key challenge in the easy preparation route with proper cationic/anionic-doped modification and attaining hydrogen adsorption–desorption enthalpy comparable with that of classical noble metals such as Pt is to improve their performance, thereby broadening the reliability in industrial applications. Thirdly, though the size of the nanoparticles affects the catalytic performances in individual materials, however, lesser the size, more is the surface area, and hence, more is the activity. However, the comparison of the activities of different materials just on the basis of size is not a satisfactory criterion as it is not the only factor responsible for the enhancement of catalytic performance.
Based on the above overview of nickel phosphide, the research vision and future prospective are shared in the subsequent points:
(i) Nowadays, nickel phosphide is being considered as an easily synthesized, inexpensive, and efficient catalyst for water splitting. However, its efficiency towards OER performance operated in an acidic regime is negligible due to its low stability. Therefore, we expect that future research will continue in the modification of nickel phosphide and the mechanistic details for the improvement of the OER strategies in the acidic medium will be unraveled for long-term stability.
(ii) Various synthetic approaches adopted to architect solo nickel phosphide or nickel phosphide-modified hybrid materials embrace hazardous P sources as the precursor. Moreover, the preparation of nickel phosphide over the substrate suffers from low yield and requires more synthetic strategies. Hence, a facile synthetic path needs to be established for the construction of a new phase or morphologically oriented nickel phosphides over various substrates ought to persist by the employment of environment-friendly precursors. This is another area of development that might result into a promising approach for a safe and sustainable environment.
(iii) Most of the developed phase/pH dependent nickel phosphide nanoparticles to-date are aggregated in appearance without any homogenous phase constituency (or mixed phase). This undoubtedly decreases the more exposed active reaction sites. In this regard, exploring novel ultrathin single-phase bimetallic phosphides that could expose abundant active sites to enhance the catalytic performance and stability is a significant research direction.
(iv) In present era, to achieve efficient overall water splitting without using any sacrificial agent is the ultimate research goal. However, the synthesized nickel phosphide and its modified catalysts have been successfully applied for HER-OER applications; however, their potential for photocatalytic overall water splitting is quite low. Therefore, it is mandatory for researchers to share a new vision to gain deep understanding on the involved catalytic mechanism so that an outstanding photocatalyst for overall water splitting can be designed and developed.
(v) The conventional electrolytic process for nickel phosphide operates best at extreme pH values (either very lower or very higher pH) as there exists the greatest probability for charge concentrations. However, operation in a pH-neutral electrolyte avoids many of the potential safety issues that are generally aroused in more caustic electrolytes. Therefore, it is necessary to find some advanced strategies that could serve the requirement in the practical sense.
(vi) The long-term chemical as well as structural stability/durability both in acidic and basic medium is very low (not more than 100 h). Thus, this area need more development. Though nickel phosphide-based materials have achieved some milestones in water splitting, however, the low overpotential (such as that of Pt and RuO2) at more than 1000 mA cm−2 is far from satisfactory. Thus, their activity can be increased by increasing the active sites, exposed facets selective for HER and OER, enhancement of charge transfer, interface designing, etc.
