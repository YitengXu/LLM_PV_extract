A general synthetic procedure was used for the covalent attachment of the donor-antenna units 1,3-di(2-thienyl)benzo[c]-thiophene (DTBT), trans-stilbene (tS) and 4-{2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]-ethoxy}-N,N-diphenylbenzenamine (TPA-EO) to 2,2′-bipyridine. First, a Vilsmeier-Haack reaction was applied to get the respective aldehyde-functionalised donor-antenna compounds which secondly reacted with 4,4′-bis(triphenylphosphonium-methyl)-2,2′-bipyridyl chloride under Wittig conditions to give the desired bipyridyl donor-antenna molecules. To create a dimethylamino (NMe2) substituted donor-antenna compound a reaction between 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine and Bredereck's reagent was carried out. The final Ru(II) complexes referred to as Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS and Ru-NMe2-NCS were obtained via one-pot reactions, starting from dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer. The bipyridyl donor-antenna molecules as well as the complexes were fully characterised and their optical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Preliminary tests of the novel Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells under AM1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2) yielded short-circuit current densities of 1.06, 2.15, 3.42 and 4.03 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltages of 625, 635, 685 and 735 mV and fill factors of about 45% corresponding to overall efficiencies of 0.31, 0.58, 0.99 and 1.37% for Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS, respectively.
1 Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted considerable research interest because of their ability to convert sunlight into electrical energy at low cost and their easy fabrication. Since the first report about DSCs,1 using the large band gap material TiO2 as n-type semiconductor, a trimeric ruthenium complex as light absorber and a liquid redox electrolyte as hole transport material, extensive efforts towards highly optimised systems have been done to achieve record efficiencies above 10%.2,3 The most serious drawbacks of such cells are inefficient sealing and leakage problems. Therefore solid hole-transport materials have been introduced to overcome the characteristic disadvantages. For that purpose, Grätzel et al.4 used an amorphous organic hole-transporter comprising doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) which is almost a reference material due to its suitable redox potentials, respectable charge carrier mobility, highly solubility and its ability to penetrate the pores of mesoporous TiO2.5 However, the power conversion efficiencies of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSCs) are still lower compared to liquid DSCs. Despite significant developments, fast charge recombination rates as well as insufficient light absorption are still considered to be the most limiting factors for the overall efficiencies of SDSCs. One approach to minimise these drawbacks is the well investigated concept of highly absorbing heteroleptic ruthenium(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes carrying donor-antenna groups.6–8 In accordance with the donor-antenna dye concept and general considerations concerning the SDSC technology, efficient dyes for SDSC applications have to fulfil some key requirements. (a) They have to carry anchor groups (e.g.carboxylate or phosphonate units) to guarantee intimate contact with the semiconductor surface by chemisorption. (b) They must exhibit excellent light harvesting properties. This includes a broad absorption range as well as high extinction coefficients. Thus, thinner SDSCs can be produced in which transport losses are reduced. This is the main advantage of the donor-antenna dye concept in which bipyridyl donor-antenna ligands with extended conjugated π-systems provide high optical extinction coefficients. (c) Moreover, the LUMO level of an ideal sensitizer has to be sufficiently high to provide the opportunity of charge injection into the conduction band of the respective semiconductor and the HOMO level has to be sufficiently low to enable efficient regeneration of the oxidised dye by the hole conductor. (d) The electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor has to be rapid in comparison to the decay of the excited states of the dye. (e) Additionally, a polarity match between the donor-antenna groups and the hole conductor is desirable to improve the wetting of dye-coated titanium dioxide with the hole transporting material spiro-OMeTAD.
2 Results and discussion
In order to achieve these goals and to gain more insight into the properties of heteroleptic polypyridyl ruthenium(II) donor-antenna complexes, we synthesised a series of Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes carrying different donor-antenna moieties. The details of synthesis, spectral properties, electrochemical behaviour and preliminary results of the performance of these dyes in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells are given in the following sections.
2.1 Synthesis of donor-antenna functionalised 2,2′-bipyridines
Our general synthetic strategy towards bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds was partly based on multi-step procedures. The target molecules 6, 7, 12 and bipy-TPA were obtained viaWittig reactions allowing the attachment of the donor-antenna moiety to the 2,2′-bipyridine core via a conjugated vinylene spacer. For that purpose, the particular aldehyde-functionalised donor-antenna unit was reacted with 4,4′-bis(triphenylphosphonium-methyl)-2,2′-bipyridyl chloride 5. The triphenylphosphonium salt was prepared in accordance with published procedures starting from 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine.6,9 Furthermore, the attachment of a dimethylamino donor unit to 2,2′-bipyridinevia a conjugated vinyl spacer yielding the bipyridyl donor antenna compound 13 was achieved using Bredereck's reagent. The trans-configuration of every vinylene spacer guarantees that the donor-antenna ligands of the Ru(II) complexes used in SDSCs directly project away from the titanium dioxide surface towards the hole-transport material. Subsequent to the synthesis of the bipyridyl donor-antenna molecules, one-pot reactions were performed to yield three novel Ru(II) complexes via a conventional synthesis and two dyesvia a microwave-assisted procedure (section 2.2).
The synthetic route for the preparation of the bipyridyl donor-antenna compound bipy-DTBT6 is shown in Scheme 1. First, 1,2-di[S-(2-pyridinyl)]benzenedithioate 1, was prepared via a trivial esterification of phthaloyl chloride with 2-mercapto-pyridine under the influence of triethylamine.10 A Grignard reaction of dithioester 1 and thiophen-2-yl-magnesium bromide yielded the diketone 1,2-di(2-thienoyl)benzene 2 in nearly quantitative yields.10 The subsequent ring closure yielded 1,3-di(2-thienyl)benzo[c]thiophene 3. This reaction was carried out in the presence of Lawesson's reagent which was used as a mild thionation agent.10,11 Subsequently, the formylation of 3 was done via a conventional Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, to yield the monoaldehyde 5-(3-thiophen-2-yl-benzo[c]thiophen-1-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde 4.12,13 Finally, the monoaldehyde 4 and the triphenylphosphonium salt 5 were reacted under Wittig conditions to yield 4,4′-bis{2-[5-(3-thiophen-2-yl-benzo[c]thiophen-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl]vinyl}-2,2′-bipyridine 6.

(i) Esterification: Et3N, THF, 0 °C, 1 min (quenched by HCl); (ii) Grignard reaction: thiophen-2-yl-magnesium bromide, THF, 0 °C, 30 min; (iii) ring closure: Lawesson's reagent, CH2Cl2, reflux, 30 min, ethanol, reflux, 30 min; (iv) Vilsmeier-Haack formylation: 1. POCl3, DMF, CH2Cl2, 0 °C → RT, 10 h, 2. NaOH/H2O, steam bath, 1 h; (v) Wittig reaction: 1. NaH, THF, RT, 5 d, 2. glacial acetic acid/H2O, RT, 1 h. 
The synthesis of the bipyridyl donor-antenna molecule 4,4′-bis[4-(p-phenylvinyl)styryl]-2,2′-bipyridine 7 denoted as bipy-tS was performed according to Scheme 2 by coupling commercially available trans-stilbene-4-carbaldehyde with 5via a Wittig reaction.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route for the preparation of donor-antenna molecule 7. (i) Wittig reaction: 1. 5, NaH, THF, RT, 4 d, 50 °C, 24 h, 2. acetic acid/H2O, 5 °C, 1 h. 
The reaction was carried out at room temperature in dry THF, using NaH as base, yielding the desired product together with traces of the monosubstituted derivative. The monosubstituted by-product was removed by boiling the raw product in methanol and cyclohexane, exploiting the difference in solubility of the two compounds.
The donor-antenna molecule 4,4′-bis[4-{N-{4-{2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}phenyl}-N-phenylamino}-styryl]-2,2′-bipyridine 12 denoted as bipy-TPA-EO was synthesised as shown in Scheme 3. First, an esterification between triethylene glycol monomethyl ether and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride was performed in the presence of pyridine. The latter neutralised the accruing HCl to facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the alcohol which resulted in the formation of {2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}-4-methyl-benzenesulfonate 8. To use a tosylate as intermediate allows the substitution of the hydroxyl group of triethylene glycol monomethyl ether by almost every nucleophile. Therefore, the reaction of 4-iodophenol with 8 resulted in the formation of 1-{2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}-4-iodobenzene 9. The subsequent synthetic step comprised an Ullmann reaction14,15 between 9, copper powder, potassium carbonate and 18-crown-6 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at elevated temperature. This copper mediated nucleophilic substitution is a conventional method for the preparation of triarylamines under the influence of a phase-transfer catalyst. Typically, a series of by-products is generated during the reaction. For that reason, an excess of the aryl iodide 9 was employed to synthesise 1-{2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}-4-(N,N-diphenylamino)benzene 10. Afterwards, 10 was converted into the respective monoaldehyde 4-{N-{4-{2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}phenyl}-N-phenylamino}benzaldehyde 11via a Vilsmeier-Haack formylation. Subsequently, a Wittig reaction was accomplished to yield the donor-antenna molecule bipy-TPA-EO 12.

(i) Esterification: pyridine, 0 °C, 2–3 h; (ii) nucleophilic substitution: 4-iodophenol, K2CO3, MEK, reflux, 4 h; (iii) Ullmann reaction: Cu powder, K2CO3, 18-crown-6, diphenylamine, o-dichlorobenzene, 120 °C, 1 h, 180 °C, 36 h; (iv) Vilsmeier-Haack reaction: 1. POCl3, DMF, 0–5 °C for 15 min, 80–85 °C for 2.5 h, 2. NaOAc/H2O, RT, overnight; (v) Wittig reaction: 1. 5, KOtBu, THF, RT, 18 h, 2. acetic acid/H2O, RT, 30 min. 
The donor-antenna compound 4,4′-bis[(N,N′-dimethylaminovinyl)-2,2′-bipyridine] 13, denoted as bipy-NMe2 was synthesised according to Bozec et al. using a one-pot reaction.16 This enamination between 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine and tert-butoxy bis(diethylamino)methane, known as Bredereck's reagent, is shown in Scheme 4. The mechanism of the enamination in polar solvents is discussed in detail by Wahl et al.17 The desired product 13 was formed after dissociation of Bredereck's reagent followed by deprotonation of the educt 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine and a β-H elimination. This results in the vinylic spacer with trans-configuration between the 2,2′-bipyridine core and the donor-antenna group –NMe2.

Additionally, the reference donor-antenna compound 4,4′-bis[4-(diphenylamino)styryl]-2,2′-bipyridine denoted as bipy-TPA was synthesised according to a published procedure.6,9,18
2.2 Synthesis of donor-antenna dyes
As shown in Scheme 5, all bipyridyl donor-antenna derivatives (6, 7, 12, 13 and bipy-TPA) were converted into the desired complexes by using dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer as reagent for the metallation reaction. This particular Ru(II) precursor provides the opportunity to obtain the desired heteroleptic octahedral ruthenium(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 complexes via an efficient one-pot synthesis by subsequent addition of the respective ligands (6, 7, 12, 13 or bipy-TPA followed by the anchoring molecule 1419 and finally adding an excess of NH4SCN).20

(i) Complex formation reaction: I. Conventional method to synthesise Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS: 1. bipyridyl donor-antenna derivative 6, 7 or 12, DMF, 100 °C, 4 h; 2. 14, DMF, 150 °C, 5 h; 3. NH4SCN, DMF, 150 °C, 4–5 h. II. Microwave assisted method to synthesise Ru-NMe2-NCS and Ru-TPA-NCS: 1. bipyridyl donor-antenna derivative 13 or bipy-TPA, DMF, microwave, 70 °C, 20–25 min; 2. 14, DMF, microwave, 135–150 °C, 20 min; 3. NH4SCN, DMF, microwave, 135–150 °C, 30–40 min. 
The metallation reaction to assemble the heteroleptic octahedral cis-di(isothiocyanato)(2,2′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridyl)(bipyridyl donor-antenna ligand)ruthenium(II) dyes was accomplished by different reaction conditions. The general procedure for the conventional preparation of Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS started with dissolving dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer in dry DMF, followed by adding the particular bipyridyl donor-antenna compound (6, 7 or 12) and heating by a conventional external heat source. In this step, the coordination of the donor-antenna compound to the ruthenium center proceeded via cleavage of the chlorine double-bridged structure of the Ru(II) dimer to yield a mononuclear complex.21 After full consumption of the donor-antenna compound in 4 h, the anchoring compound of the prospective dye4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine 14 was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was continued for 5 h under reflux. Finally, an excess of NH4SCN was added to be coordinated to the Ru(II) center atom in 4–5 h under reflux. The reaction was terminated by cooling the solution to room temperature and vacuum distillation of the solvent to obtain the respective raw product. Ru-DTBT-NCS was purified by reprecipitation. Ru-tS-NCS was isolated by precipitation from THF into diethyl ether. Ru-TPA-EO-NCS could be obtained as a pure product after washing with water and diethyl ether. The novel heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes were obtained as violet or black powders.
This time-consuming synthetic procedure could be remarkably improved by using a microwave assisted method. This method was applied to obtain the novel complex Ru-NMe2-NCS and the reference donor-antenna dye Ru-TPA-NCS which was synthesised here for the first time in a microwave oven. Thus, the metallation procedure was only modified with respect to the heat source and the time. The ruthenium(II) precursor, the steps of subsequent addition of ligands and the solvent were not changed. The use of microwave equipment implicates the advantage of a more efficient heating by direct transfer of the irradiated energy on the reaction mixture as a consequence of dielectric heating. This phenomenon is based on the ability of the molecules to absorb microwaves and transfer this energy directly into heat resulting in extremely fast heating of all compounds in the reaction solution. For this reason, the microwave assisted heating is more efficient, leads to less wall effects and side reactions than the conventional heating in an oil bath where heat transfer depends on thermal conductivity.22,23 The positive influence of the microwave assisted method for preparing polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes can be directly seen by the remarkable acceleration of the reactions and the nearly quantitative yields for Ru-NMe2-NCS and Ru-TPA-NCS. All dyes were characterised by FT-IR, UV-Vis and cyclic voltammetry (CV).
2.3 Spectral properties

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of all complexes were measured after embedding the substance into potassium bromide pellets. The prominent bands are summarised in Table 1. All FT-IR spectra show the characteristic signal of the NCS unit which is visible as an intense band at ∼2100 cm−1. This can be attributed to the N-coordinated isothiocyanate group proving the successful coordination of the NCS moiety to the ruthenium(II) center atom. The bands appearing at ∼1240 cm−1 can be assigned to the ν(C–O) stretching of carboxylic acid groups. Furthermore, the presence of COOH groups can be proven by the appearance of a ν(CO) stretching band present in the FT-IR spectrum of each complex between 1711 and 1722 cm−1. Additionally, the typically broad band at about 3440 cm−1 indicates the existence of OH groups. Beside these signals, the FT-IR spectrum of Ru-NMe2-NCS shows prominent bands at 1479 and 1367 cm−1, arising from asymmetric and symmetric bending vibrations of CH3-N-moieties. The medium absorption peak at 1109 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of Ru-TPA-EO-NCS indicates the existence of ethylene oxide moieties and the broadness of the band indicates the disorder of the side chains. Moreover, a weak but broad peak at 2879 cm−1 appears arising from the aliphatic CH groups of the ethylene oxide groups.

Fig. 1 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of all complexes and the standard dye N719 in solution. It is obvious that the polypyridyl complexes, including N719, show very broad and intense absorption bands throughout almost the whole absorption region extended up to the near UV range. All donor-antenna Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes exhibit higher extinction coefficients compared to the standard dye N719 over the whole investigated region. This can be understood by the influence of the different delocalised π-systems integrated in the bipyridyl donor-antenna ligands. Furthermore, all dyes (including N719) show three characteristic absorption maxima caused by ligand-centred (LC) electronic transitions and/or metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MLCT) transitions.

The high energy bands in the UV region between 301 and 310 nm (Table 2, λmax1) can be attributed to LC transitions arising from 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine and the particular donor-antenna ligand. The second absorption band series with wavelength maxima between 369 and 429 nm (Table 2, λmax2) can be assigned to two different influences. First, this absorption band results partly from LC π–π* transitions because the single bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds used for metallation absorb in almost the same region (λmax at 358, 355, 363, 398 and 395 nm for bipy-DTBT, bipy-NMe2, bipy-tS, bipy-TPA and bipy-TPA-EO, respectively). The bathochromic shift of 11 to 34 nm of this second dye absorption band compared to the absorption band of the single bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds can be seen as a consequence of the coordination of the bipyridyl donor-antenna derivative to the ruthenium core. The second factor affecting the absorption bands with maxima between 369 and 429 nm is caused by one spin allowed d-π* MLCT transitions. All dyes, except Ru-NMe2-NCS, show extraordinary high extinction coefficients (Table 2, εmax2) for this absorption band depending on the nature of the donor-antenna moiety and its conjugated π-system. The reason for the low absorption of the standard dye N719 in this region is the absence of any donor-antenna groups; thus its absorption is just governed by the d-π* MLCT transitions. The characteristic low energy absorption band of Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes with absorption maxima between 515 and 550 nm (Table 2, λmax3) is a direct consequence of the coordination of the NCS moiety to the ruthenium(II) center. Investigations of Ru(II)tris(bipyridyl)s showed that in the absence of this functional group no low energy MLCT transition appeared under standard conditions because this transition is spin-forbidden for tris(bipyridyl) dyes.6,18,24 Regarding Ru-DTBT-NCS, the low energy band is exceptionally broad and intensive (ε = 35600 L mol−1 cm−1 at 515 nm). The reason for this behaviour is based on an additional absorption contribution of the bipy-DTBT ligand 6 to this MLCT band. In contrast to all other donor-antenna ligands, this ligand shows a strongly bathochromic shifted low-energy absorption band with a wavelength maximum of 486 nm. As a consequence of this, the absorption band of Ru-DTBT-NCS at λmax = 515 nm can be seen as an overlap of ligand-centred π–π* transitions occurring in bipy-DTBT 6 and the characteristic ruthenium-to-NCS MLCT transition. Both factors enhance and enlarge this low-energy absorption band.

2.4 Electrochemical investigations
The electrochemical properties of the bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds (6, 7, 12, 13 and bipy-TPA), the Ru(II) complexes (Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS) and the standard dye N719 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in solution. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) was used as the conducting salt, a glassy carbon disk electrode as the working electrode and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode. Each measurement was calibrated by the internal standard ferrocene (Fc0/+ (CH2Cl2) = 0.08 V, Fc0/+ (DMF) = 0.04 V, Fc0/+ (DMSO) = 0.04 V). The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated relative to the value of −4.8 eV for ferrocene with respect to the vacuum level. All measured values are summarised in Table 3.

It is well known from the literature that the HOMOs of Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 complexes without donor-antenna groups like N719 have a large amplitude on the NCS ligands.21,25 It is also known that oxidations of octahedral Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes usually involve a metal centred (πM(t2g)) orbital upon formation of the respective Ru(III) complex (low spin, 4 d5 configuration).26 N719 showed in our investigation an oxidation potential of 0.28 eV vs. Fc in DMF, corresponding to a HOMO level of −5.08 eV. Except Ru-DTBT-NCS and Ru-NMe2-NCS, which have very similar first oxidation potentials both in the Ru(II) complex and the donor-antenna ligand, all other Ru(II) -dyes exhibit first oxidation potentials relevant for RuII/IIIoxidation (at ∼0.3 V vs.ferrocene). This is in agreement with the reported values in the literature.21,25 Thus the HOMO distribution for Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS is delocalised mainly over the ruthenium core and a certain group which is present in all dyes like the NCS ligand. However, in the cases of Ru-DTBT-NCS and Ru-NMe2-NCS, the HOMO can be assumed to be distributed over the ruthenium core and the bipyridyl donor-antenna moiety.
Furthermore, it is obvious that the HOMO−1 values of the dyes Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS agree with the HOMO values of the respective bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds within a maximum discrepancy of ±0.1 eV (Table 3). This indicates that the second oxidation of the complexes most probably occurs in the bipyridyl donor-antenna compound. Earlier we reported that the first oxidation of the Ru-TPA-NCS complex occurs on the bipyridyl donor-antenna moiety, but based on our detailed electrochemical investigations presented here, it becomes obvious that not the first but the second oxidation takes place on the bipyridyl donor-antenna moiety.27
Earlier, it was observed that tris(bipyridyl) dyes carrying donor-antenna groups provide the possibility to reduce the recombination rate in SDSCs at the interface between TiO2 and the hole conductor.28 The reason for the suppression of recombination by spatial separation of charges in tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) complexes is indeed a consequence of appropriate energy levels in these dyes. According to the literature, the RuII/III potential of the Ru(II)tris(bipyrindine) prototype [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+ occurs at 0.85 V vs. Fc26 which means that the oxidation of the bipyridyl donor-antenna compound, e.g. bipy-TPA, appears at definitely lower potentials (Eox1 (bipy-TPA) vs. Fc = 0.58 eV). In contrast to that, the RuII/IIIoxidation in bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 dyes occurs at much lower potentials around 0.28–0.32 V vs. Fc. The reason for the shift of the RuII/IIIoxidation is due to the substitution of one bipyridyl ligand by two NCS ligands. This implies that only very easily oxidizable donor-antenna groups exhibiting oxidation potentials ≤0.3 V vs. Fc promote charge cascade transfer and thus increased spatial separation in the charge separated state in Ru(II)L2(NCS)2dyes. Since these values are solely based on cyclic voltammetric measurements in solution and appreciable shift of energy levels at interfaces can occur, a real picture of energetics and charge injection at the TiO2–dye interface can be elucidated only by further spectroscopic studies.
Furthermore, it is known that the LUMO amplitude in N719 is homogeneously distributed over the two 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine anchoring ligands.21,25 The measured LUMO value for N719 was −3.15 eV corresponding to the reduction occurring primarily in the anchoring ligand. The measured LUMO levels of all the dyes lie in the same range (Table 3). Thus, it can be assumed that the LUMO of these dyes is mainly located on the anchor ligand.
2.5 Performance of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells
The extremely high molar extinction coefficients over an expanded wavelength region make the complexes Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS promising candidates for use as sensitizers in SDSCs. Therefore, we investigated the performance of these dyes in typical SDSC devices (Fig. 2) and report hereby the first preliminary results. For cell preparation, a standard procedure optimised in our group was used. We used partly etched FTO coated glass as a transparent conducting electrode covered by a compact TiO2 film, acting as a blocking layer to prevent direct contact between FTO and the hole-transport material.29 The well connected mesoporous TiO2 network, exhibiting a huge surface-area for a high dye uptake, was prepared by screen printing and subsequent sintering of a nano-titanium dioxide paste. The respective sensitizers (Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS and N719) were subsequently chemisorbed onto TiO2. Afterwards, the hole-transport material spiro-OMeTAD and additives such as lithium salt (LiN(SO2CF3)2) and 4-tert-butylpyridine were applied by spin coating and gold contacts were deposited under high vacuum.

The photovoltaic performances of the complexes Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS and the standard sensitizer N719 chemisorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 (thickness: 2.3 µm) were studied under standard AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 3 shows the results of the current–voltage measurements of the solar cells.

The characteristic parameters obtained from the current–voltage measurements such as photovoltage under open-current conditions (Voc), photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and the resulting power conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 4. For comparison, a N719 based device was also prepared and measured under the same conditions. The higher current or efficiency values reported earlier for reference dyes N719 and Ru-TPA-NCS arise from differences in the used samples of nanocrystalline TiO2 and thickness of active layers.6 In the comparative study here, we used a screen-printable TiO2 paste bought from Dyesol, Australia and we observed large differences between this paste and that supplied by ECN, Netherlands in SDSC performance.

The photovoltaic results (Table 4) indicate that the solar cell performance—especially the short-circuit photo-current density—strongly depends on the particular secondary donor unit. This is in excellent agreement with the optical properties and the extinction coefficients of the various dyes (Fig. 1, Table 2). The photocurrent density increases with increasing size of the conjugated π-system of the donor-antenna functionality (with the exception of Ru-DTBT-NCS). By comparing the small donor-antenna functionality –NMe2 without additional conjugated π-system with the trans-stilbene unit having an enlarged delocalised system an increase of the photocurrent density from 2.15 to 3.42 mA cm−2 was observed. By further extension of the π-system like in Ru-TPA-NCS and Ru-TPA-EO-NCS a further increase of the photocurrent density to 4.30 and 4.03 mA cm−2, respectively, was achieved. The optical density of chemisorbed Ru-TPA-EO-NCS is lower than that of Ru-TPA-NCS for the whole range of absorption (cf.Fig. 4). This explains the slightly decreased photocurrent density of Ru-TPA-EO-NCS compared to Ru-TPA-NCS. This might be a consequence of the increased spatial demand of Ru-TPA-EO-NCS due to the oligo(ethylene oxide) side chains.

UV-Vis spectra of Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS and N719 adsorbed onto mesoporous TiO2 (thickness: 2.3 µm). 
Nevertheless, the performance of Ru-DTBT-NCS is exceptional, indicating that the absorption behaviour is only one aspect for a good overall performance. Energetic properties of the dyes absorbed on TiO2 as well as recombination processes have to be taken into account for a detailed understanding. Investigations in this direction are under way. The photovoltaic performance and absorption on TiO2 of N719 and Ru-NMe2-NCS are almost equal because both sensitizers do not exhibit the influence of an expanded π-system which enhances the absorption and as a consequence the photocurrent. These results indicate the importance of appropriate donor-antenna moieties with extended delocalised π-systems. In accordance with this, the best overall results were obtained for the novel Ru-TPA-EO-NCS dye incorporating a highly conjugated delocalised π-system in combination with oligo(ethylene oxide) side chains acting as ion-coordinating functionalities. The positive effect of adding lithium salts in SDSCs to improve both Jsc and Voc has been studied earlier.6 In order to increase the concentration of lithium ions at the interface, oligo(ethylene oxide) functionalities have been introduced in bipyridyl moieties.30–32 These “ion-binding” groups can coordinate the lithium ions and partially block them from reaching the TiO2 surface. This prevents the lowering of the photovoltage.30 Thus the highest Voc was obtained for Ru-TPA-EO-NCS. Hence, this dye combines two different approaches to enhance the efficiency of SDSCs. (1) The donor effect of the conjugated π-system of TPA enhances the absorption and thus the photocurrent density. (2) The oligo(ethylene oxide) side chains improve the photovoltage in terms of ion-coordinating sensitizers for use in SDSCs.30–32 These preliminary results of the donor-antenna dyes in comparison with the standard sensitizer N719 indicate the potential of Ru(II) dyes carrying donor-antenna moieties.
3 Conclusion
We successfully synthesised a series of bipyridyl donor-antenna compounds in multi-step procedures and used them for metallation reactions to obtain heteroleptic donor-antenna Ru(II)bis(bipyridyl)(NCS)2 complexes via one-pot reactions. All complexes, denoted as Ru-DTBT-NCS, Ru-tS-NCS, Ru-TPA-EO-NCS, Ru-NMe2-NCS and Ru-TPA-NCS, comprised a bipyridyl carboxylic acid anchor moiety, two NCS ligands coordinated to the Ru(II) center, and different secondary donor-antenna units covalently attached to the bipyridine core. Our main goal was to increase the molar extinction coefficients of sensitizers for SDSC application by appropriate donor-antenna groups attached to bipyridines via a vinylene spacer. This enables the use of thinner solar cells and thus reduces transport losses. Measurements of the spectral properties of all dyes except the less delocalised dye Ru-NMe2-NCS demonstrated very high extinction coefficients over a broad range of the UV-Vis spectra. In addition to that, detailed electrochemical investigations were performed. The oxidations were assigned to the RuII/III core and the donor-antenna groups. The reduction occurs in the anchor ligand. The obtained values for the frontier orbitals indicated that the LUMO levels of the novel dyes were high enough for efficient charge injection into the conduction band of TiO2 and the HOMO levels were low enough for proper regeneration of the oxidised dyes by spiro-OMeTAD. Furthermore, preliminary tests of these complexes as sensitizers in SDSCs were successfully accomplished and showed promising results in not yet optimised systems with potential for further improvement.
4 Experimental
4.1 Analytical measurements

UV-Vis spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-300 spectrophotometer. The measurements were carried out in solution using quartz glass cuvettes with 1 cm thickness. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-40. The measurements were carried out after embedding the solid substance into a potassium bromide pellet and liquid between NaCl plates using 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1 (transmission mode). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance AC-250 spectrometer (250 MHz). Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 8500 with a MAT 112 S Varian at an ionisation energy of 70 eV (electron impact). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out under moisture- and oxygen-free conditions using a standard three-electrode assembly connected to a potentiostat (model 263A, EG&G Princeton Applied Research) and a PC at a scanning rate of 50 mV sec−1. The working electrode was a glassy carbon disk electrode (area = 0.0314 cm2), a platinum wire was used as auxiliary electrode and the quasi-reference electrode was Ag/Ag+ composed of a Ag wire and AgNO3 in acetonitrile. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) was used as the conducting salt. Each measurement was calibrated with an internal standard (ferrocene/ferrocenium). The HOMO and LUMO values were determined from the value of −4.8 eV for ferrocene with respect to vacuum level.
4.2 Materials for synthesis
Commercially available chemicals were used as received without further purification with the exception of POCl3 which was freshly distilled before use. Solvents for chromatography, reactions or extractions were purified by distillation. 4,4′-Bis(triphenylphosphonium-methyl)-2,2′-bipyridyl chloride 5 was synthesised according to the literature6,9 as well as the anchoring compound 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine 14.19 The bipyridyl donor-antenna compound 4,4′-bis[4-(diphenylamino)styryl]-2,2′-bipyridine bipy-TPA was synthesised by a method analogous to a recently published multi-step reaction.6,9,18

Freshly distilled POCl3 (1.40 mL, 2.34 g, 15.25 mmol) was added to DMF (10 mL) under dry conditions, cooled to 0 °C and stirred at 0–5 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the ice bath was removed and the solution was stirred until the red colour vanished. Meanwhile, 10 (6.11 g, 15.0 mmol) was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and cooled to 0–5 °C. Then the POCl3 containing solution was added dropwise to the solution of 10 in CH2Cl2. After stirring the resulting yellow solution for 15 min at 0–5 °C, it was heated to 80–85 °C and stirred for 2.5 h (TLC control; CH2Cl2; each sample was shaken with sodium acetate and diluted with CH2Cl2). After full conversion of 10, the reaction mixture was cooled to RT, added dropwise to a strongly stirring solution of sodium acetate in ice water (∼50 mL) and stirred overnight. Afterwards, the organic layer was isolated and the aqueous was extracted with CH2Cl2 (5 × 70 mL). The combined organic fractions were dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The raw product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel 60; cyclohexane:ethyl acetate 1:1). The pure product was obtained as a yellow, highly viscous liquid (2.80 g, 43%).

Diisopropoxytitanium bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) was used as received. The screen printable nano-titanium dioxide paste DSL 90-T was supplied by Dyesol, Queanbeyan NSW, Australia. The solid hole conductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (Aldrich) was used as received. Lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiN(SO2CF3)2) (Aldrich) was purchased, dried under vacuum and stored under N2 till use. The standard dye N719 purchased from Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland was used as received.
4.6 Solar cell preparation
FTO-covered glass substrates were partly etched (to create a non-conducting area for the cathode contacts), cleaned and covered with a compact TiO2 blocking layer by spray pyrolysis deposition.29 After screen-printing and sintering the mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide, the respective dye was adsorbed from a 0.5 mM DMF (dry) solution with the exception of Ru-NMe2-NCS which was adsorbed from a 0.5 mM DMSO (dry) solution. The hole-transport layer was prepared by spin coating a solution of 0.16 M spiro-OMeTAD, 30.3 mM lithium salt LiN(SO2CF3)2 and 0.23 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in chlorobenzene. To complete the solar cells, gold contacts were deposited under high vacuum.
4.7 Solar cell measurements
Current–voltage characteristics were measured under a standard light source (xenon arc lamp) equipped with suitable filters to get AM1.5G spectral conditions at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The lamp was regularly calibrated with an ISE Call lab, Freiburg silicon solar cell (WPVS cell). I/V values were recorded using a Keithley 6517 source measure unit.
