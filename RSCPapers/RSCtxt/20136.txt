    , Accepted 14th March 2013First published on 15th March 2013AbstractWe present a high-yield and low cost thermal evaporation-induced anhydrous strategy to prepare hybrid materials of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and graphene as an advanced anode for high-performance lithium ion batteries. The ∼10–20 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles are densely anchored on conducting graphene sheets and act as spacers to keep the adjacent sheets separated. The Fe3O4–graphene composite displays a superior battery performance with high retained capacity of 868 mA h g−1 up to 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and 539 mA h g−1 up to 200 cycles when cycling at 1000 mA g−1, high Coulombic efficiency (above 99% after 200 cycles), good rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability. The simple approach offers a promising route to prepare anode materials for practical fabrication of lithium ion batteries.
Introduction
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as power sources for various portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras and lap-top computers.1,2 Most recently, they have attracted increasing attention as power supplies for electric and hybrid vehicles. As we know, the main commercially used anode material is graphitic-based; however, it is widely expected that it cannot meet demand requirements due to its low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1.3 Consequently, intensive research has been performed to explore new anode materials for LIBs with low cost, high specific capacity and good cyclic stability for LIBs in order to produce energy storage devices that can sufficiently meet the increasing market demands. Recently, transition metal oxides including Co3O4,4 Mn3O4,5 Fe2O3,6 Fe3O4,7,8 SnO2,9 NiO,10 TiO211 and RuO212 have been widely investigated as promising anode materials for high performance LIBs because of their high theoretical capacity (∼500–1000 mA h g−1). Among them, Fe3O4 has been extensively investigated as one of the most promising anode materials for LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity (924 mA h g−1), abundance, low cost, high electronic conductivity, and environmental benignity, which are expected to meet the requirements of future energy storage systems.13–18 However, most Fe3O4 nanomaterials suffer from large volume expansion and severe particle aggregation occurs during the Li+ insertion–extraction processes so that the electrodes undergo partial pulverization and cannot maintain their integrity over several discharge–charge cycles, resulting in large irreversible capacity and poor cycling performance. Recently, combinations of Fe3O4 and nano-, micro-structures of nanowires,19 nanospindles,20 nanorods,21 nanoparticles (NPs)22 and micro-flowers23 with carbon-based conducting matrixes to form hybrid composites have been employed as effective routes to improve their electrochemical properties.
Graphene is a two-dimensional one-atom-thick sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atoms,24 which is widely used in numerous areas including solar cells,25 field effect transistors,26 optoelectronics,27 batteries28 and supercapacitors29 due to its unique ultra-thin thickness structure, high specific surface area, excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and high chemical functionality. For LIBs, graphene can also be employed to produce composites with metal oxide NPs to improve their electrochemical performance. Advantages of these composites arise because the supported graphene layer not only serves as a structural buffer to effectively accommodate the volume variation and prevents aggregation of NPs in the cycling process, but also serves as a conductive network to facilitate the conductivity of electrons and the diffusion of lithium-ions by shortening the transport distance.30–33 Furthermore, the NPs between graphene sheets act as spacers to keep the adjacent sheets separated and efficiently suppress the re-stacking of graphene thus keeping their high active surface area and, to some extent, increase the performance of graphene-based hybrid materials.34,35 This synergetic effect between graphene and metal oxide NPs is an important factor that can help to enhance battery performance. However, most of hydrothermal synthesis methods for such composites usually involved several time-consuming steps e.g. centrifuge to collect products, rinsed with ethanol and water, and dried in an oven. It is therefore desirable to develop high-yield and simple synthesis methods to promote the applications of such functional composites.
Here, we report a facile, high-yield, and low cost thermal evaporation-induced anhydrous strategy to prepare an Fe3O4–graphene composite directly from thermal evaporation of DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide), Fe(acac)3 (iron(III) acetylacetonate) and graphene oxide (GO). It should be noted that DMF serves a dual function as a solvent for GO and Fe(acac)3 and also as a reductant to reduce part of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the thermal evaporation process. Through this facile and anhydrous approach, the Fe3O4 NPs obtained with a size of ∼10–20 nm densely deposited on the conductive graphene sheets without additional molecular linkers. The existence of graphene in the composite enhanced battery performance because its performance is better than similar method synthesized carbon-supported Fe3O4 composites as described in ref. 8. The resultant Fe3O4–graphene composite exhibits a retained capacity of 868 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and 539 mA h g−1 up to 200 cycles when cycling at 1000 mA g−1, high Coulombic efficiency (above 99% after 200 cycles), good rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability.
Experimental section
Synthesis of GO
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from natural graphite powder by a modified Hummers method.36,37 First, the graphite powder was oxidized using 0.9 g NaNO3 and 37 mL of concentrated H2SO4 that were added to 1 g graphite powder cooled in an ice bath. This mixture was continuously stirred while 5 g of KMnO4 was added slowly over 1 h. It was left to stir for 2 h in the ice bath, and then removed and left for 4 days under continuous stirring. A black viscous liquid was obtained and 100 mL of deionized water was added over 30 min while stirring continuously. The mixture was stirred for a further 2 h, 10 mL H2O2 (30 wt% aqueous solution) was slowly added and then the mixture was left to stir for another 2 h. The resulting oxidized material was washed three times by 10 wt% diluted hydrochloric acid and then washed by deionized water until the pH value was close to 7. The light yellow GO powder was obtained after freeze drying for 12 h.
Preparation of Fe3O4–graphene composite
The Fe3O4–graphene composite was prepared by a simple thermal evaporation-induced method. In the typical synthesis, 90 mg GO were dissolved in 20 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) by mild sonication in an ultrasound bath for 15 min to form a clear, light yellow solution. Then, 1.059 g of iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3; 97%, Aldrich) were added into the resulting solution and stirred at 80 °C for 1 h to guarantee the metal ion combined with the oxygen-containing functional groups on the edges and surface of GO. The resulting solution was transferred to two glass bottles (30 mL in volume), which were then heated from room temperature to 180 °C at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1 in an electric oven until the DMF solution evaporated completely. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was collected from the bottle. For battery tests, the collected products were calcined in a tube furnace at 530 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h under a nitrogen atmosphere to reduce graphene oxide and obtain the better crystallinity Fe3O4–graphene composite. For comparison, Fe3O4 NPs were also prepared under the same procedure but without the presence of graphene.
Characterization
The as-prepared products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips PW 1830 with Cu Kα radiation and a normal 2θ scan) with a 1 mm X-ray beam at room temperature. The atomic force microcopy (AFM) image was obtained on a scanning probe microscope (Nanoscope IIIa, Digital instruments/Veeco Metrology group) with the tapping mode in air. Raman measurements were employed to verify chemical bonding characteristics of carbon with a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope. To investigate the approximate proportion of carbon in the synthesized products, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Q50) was employed from room temperature to 800 °C under air ventilation of 10 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The morphological characteristics were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Philips, CM20 operated at 200 kV), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM; CM200 FEG operated at 200 kV).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using coin cells (2032) with lithium metal foil (Aldrich, USA) as the counter electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt% active material (Fe3O4–graphene composite), 10 wt% acetylene carbon black, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent. The resulting slurry was coated homogeneously on a copper foil and dried at 100 °C for 10 h in a vacuum and then circular (1.6 cm2) anode discs were punched from the copper foil. The punched anode discs were weighed to determine the amount of active materials before assembly into a coin-type cell. One layer of Celgard 2032 (Celgard, Inc., USA) served as the separator and LiPF6 (1 mol L−1) was dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (1:1 in volume) as the electrolyte. The cells were assembled in a glove box filled with high purity argon gas with low moisture and oxygen. Galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling measurements of the assembled cells were tested in the voltage range from 5 mV to 3.0 V using different constant current densities on an Arbin Instruments (BT 2000, College Station, Texas, USA) battery cycler at room temperature. A CHI-660C electrochemical workstation was employed to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements over a frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz with a potentiostatic signal amplitude of 5 mV.
Results and discussion
GO has been synthesized by the chemical oxidation of graphite (see ESI,† Fig. S1 for the SEM, TEM and AFM images). The crystal structure of heat-treated Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite were characterized by the typical XRD as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The diffraction peaks and relative intensities of all diffraction peaks of both Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite are good agreement with those of the Fe3O4 (Magnetite, JCPDS 85-1436). No obvious XRD peaks corresponding to graphite are detected in the XRD pattern, indicating that the graphene sheets are not well crystallized.

The carbon content of the Fe3O4–graphene composite was quantitatively determined by TGA under air, as shown in Fig. 2. The small weight loss (about 0.9%) below 150 °C is likely due to the evaporation of moisture or gaseous content in the composite.38 As the temperature increases, a hump appeared beginning at ∼200 °C due to conversion of Fe3O4 to Fe2O3 when heated in the air,39 which causes a theoretical weight increase of 3.45% (each Fe3O4 can combine 1/2 O unit). The combustion of carbon begins around 350 °C, and the weight change is nearly completed at about 500 °C. From the TGA curve, the observed fraction of weight loss is about 18.6%. Assuming that the final residue is Fe2O3, resulting from carbon burning and oxygenation under the continuous flow of O2 gas at a high temperature, the weight percentage of carbon content in the sample is estimated to be ∼22.05%. The carbon content in the Fe3O4–graphene composite can improve the electrochemical performance due to the strong synergetic effect between graphene sheets and Fe3O4 NPs, however, when the percentage of carbon content increased to a certain level, the composite was unable to maintain a satisfactory electrochemical performance in term of both capacity and cyclic retention.40,41

The significant structural changes of the carbon network occurring during the chemical processing from GO to graphene are monitored by their Raman spectra as shown in Fig. 3. The two prominent peaks of GO appear at 1603 and 1335 cm−1, which correspond to the well-documented G and D bands. A general characteristic of the reduction of GO is that the G band shifts to lower wavenumber. The Raman spectrum of the Fe3O4–graphene composite also possesses both G and D bands, but the G band shifts to 1596 cm−1, indicating the reduction of GO during the heat treatment process. A second Raman spectra characteristic of the reduction of GO is that the ratio of the two bands (ID:IG) increases when GO is reduced. For the Fe3O4–graphene composite, the intensity ratio of ID:IG is calculated as 1.133 which is higher than that of GO (1.065), further confirming the reduction of GO. The change in intensity ratio of the D and G bands could be explained from the fact that the reduction of exfoliated GO leads to smaller but more numerous sp2 domains in the carbon and the presence of Fe3O4 NPs between graphene sheets.42 This change further reveals the structural features of the Fe3O4–graphene composite. The presence of a peak at 2684 cm−1 corresponding to the overtone of the D band and the peak at 2923 cm−1 attributed to the (D + G) band which also shows a substantial increase in the disorder degree in graphene sheets.43

To investigate the morphology and structure of the products, SEM images (see ESI,† Fig. S2 for detail) containing a large amount of the nanocomposites and TEM images were taken for the Fe3O4–graphene composite. Fig. 4(a) presents the representative morphology of the Fe3O4–graphene composite, revealing large amounts of Fe3O4 NPs of ∼10–20 nm in diameter which are clearly observed decorated onto graphene sheets. The HRTEM image of the edge of an individual Fe3O4 nanoparticle is shown in Fig. 4(b) and the inset shows the corresponding Fourier transform image. It is found that the lattice spacing is 0.30 nm which is consistent with the d-spacing of {220} planes observed in the inset of Fig. 4(b). This clearly demonstrates the well-textured and single-crystalline nature of the Fe3O4 NPs in the composite. It should be noted that the Fe3O4 NPs are strongly deposited on graphene sheets and a high density of them are observed even after long time sonication during the preparation of the TEM specimen. These results demonstrate the strong interaction between Fe3O4 NPs and conducting graphene sheets. In addition, the TEM and HRTEM images of Fe3O4 were also provided (see ESI,† Fig. S3 for detail) which revealed the size of Fe3O4 NPs (∼5–20 nm in diameter) changed compared with the NPs decorated onto graphene sheets.

The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Fe3O4–graphene composite was first evaluated by galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling at a current density of 50 mA g−1 for the first cycle and at 100 mA g−1 for the following four cycles. For comparison, we also present the result of Fe3O4 prepared by the same procedure under the same electrochemical conditions as shown in Fig. 5(a). The first discharge and charge capacities are 1071 and 614 mA h g−1 for Fe3O4, and 2144 and 1443 mA h g−1 for Fe3O4–graphene composite electrodes. Compared to the theoretical capacity of bulk Fe3O4 (924 mA h g−1) and graphite (372 mA h g−1) the initial high discharge capacities of Fe3O4 and the Fe3O4–graphene composite, which have been widely observed for transition metal oxide anodes, are attributed to the formation of a pseudo-capacitive gel like film.8,44 For the Fe3O4–graphene composite, the higher extra discharge capacity may be also because of the larger electrochemical active surface area of graphene and/or grain boundary area of the nanosized Fe3O4 particles.45 The initial capacity loss may result from the incomplete conversion reaction and irreversible lithium loss caused by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.46 After five discharge–charge cycles, the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 959 mA h g−1 and the corresponding Coulombic efficiency rises from 67% in the first cycle to 98% in the fifth one. In contrast, the reversible capacity of the Fe3O4 NPs electrode drops to 456 mA h g−1 and the corresponding Coulombic efficiency rose from 57% in the first cycle to 96% in the fifth one. These results demonstrated the strong synergistic effect between Fe3O4 NPs and graphene sheets, which is significant to improve the electrochemical performance of this hybrid composite electrode. In this system the Fe3O4 NPs are expected to be electrically connected with the graphene sheets and are expected to contribute to the total capacity leading to enhanced electronic transport in the Fe3O4–graphene composite compared with Fe3O4 NPs.

Subsequent cycles at 100 mA g−1 for the Fe3O4–graphene composite keep a reversible capacity of 928 mA h g−1 after the 11th cycle, whereas the retention capacity of the Fe3O4 electrode drops to 440 mA h g−1. To evaluate the effect of graphene sheets in the Fe3O4–graphene composite, the electrochemical properties of Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite as anode materials for LIBs were further tested for 10 cycles at various current densities between 0.2 and 2 C. The obtained reversible capacities of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite as anode materials for LIBs were further tested for 10 cycles at various current densities between 0.2 and 2 C. The obtained reversible capacities of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite electrodes are 746 and 372 mA h g−1 for the 21st cycle at 200 mA g−1, 531 and 273 mA h g−1 for the 31st cycle at 500 mA g−1, 405 and 218 mA h g−1 for the 41st cycle at 1000 mA g−1, and 282 and 167 mA h g−1 for the 51st cycle at 2000 mA g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Furthermore, when the current density was lowered to 200 mA g−1 after 51 cycles, the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode recovers its capacity to 935 mA h g−1 at the 61st cycle, thus demonstrating the excellent reversibility of the Fe3O4–graphene composite. It is obviously observed that the rate capability of the Fe3O4–graphene composite is much better than that of Fe3O4 NPs operating for current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. The improved electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite can be attributed to the distinctive strong synergetic effects of the Fe3O4 NPs and the conductive graphene network.

To further test the cyclic stability of the anodes, new cells were assembled and first cycled at 50 mA g−1 to activate the anode materials. And then the cells were cycled at 100 mA g−1 for 3 cycles, followed by cycling at 200 mA g−1 for 96 cycles and 1000 mA g−1 for 100 cycles. For the Fe3O4 electrode, the reversible capacity stabilized at ∼390 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles and the reversible capacity gradually increased to 438 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles when cycling at 200 mA g−1, the capacity decreased to 235 mA h g−1 up to 200 cycles when cycling at 1000 mA g−1, in contrast to the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode, the reversible capacity dropped to ∼750 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles but steadily increased until reaching 868 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, then the capacity decreased to 539 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The capacity rise after prolonged cycling can be attributed to a possible activation process, in which the irreversible Li2O formed during early cycles could be re-exposed, thus enabling its participation in the electrochemical reaction, as a consequence of the progressive particle pulverizations resulting from the electrochemical grinding effect.23,47 The Coulombic efficiencies of the Fe3O4 and Fe3O4–graphene composite electrodes are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The Coulombic efficiency of the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode is higher than that of the Fe3O4 electrode from the second cycle. It is noteworthy that the Coulombic efficiency of the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode reaches up to ∼98% after the 10th cycle and keeps showing an increasing trend in the remaining cycling process, which demonstrates great enhancement of the discharge–charge reversibility and capacities retention of the Fe3O4–graphene composite.

EIS is a powerful technique to analyze the kinetic and mechanistic information of electrode materials, which relates to charge transfer, lithium-ion diffusion, and passivation layer formation. In order to verify the good battery performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite, the Nyquist plots (Z′ vs. −Z′′) of ac impedance for Fe3O4 NPs and the Fe3O4–graphene composite were presented before cycling and after 100 cycles as shown in Fig. 8. The high frequency of the semicircle can be attributed to the formation of a passivation layer and corresponding impedance between active particles and electrolyte.48,49 The semicircle dominating in the medium frequency describes the charge transfer impedance (Rct) through the electrode–electrolyte interface which is a large proportion of the overall kinetic impedance of the cell.50 The sloping line at low frequency is known as Warburg impedance, which is due to the lithium ions diffusion/transport in the electrolyte to the electrode surface.51,52
 Fig. 8  Nyquist plots of Fe3O4 (a) before cycling and (c) after 100 cycles, and Fe3O4–graphene composite (b) before cycling and (d) after 100 cycles. 
It is obvious that the size of the semicircle for the Fe3O4–graphene composite before cycling or after 100 cycles is smaller than that of Fe3O4 NPs, indicating a lower Rct for the Fe3O4–graphene composite. This result clearly demonstrates that the incorporated graphene sheets facilitate diffusion of lithium-ions and electrons by providing a shortened diffusion pathway and providing larger interface areas between electrolyte and active materials. Furthermore, it is clearly shown in Fig. 8 that the impedance of both Fe3O4 NPs and the Fe3O4–graphene composite decreases with the increased cycling number. After 100 cycles, the total resistances of these two cells decrease from 550 to 75 Ω and from 270 to 30 Ω, respectively. The reduced resistance might be attributed to the wettability process between the electrode and the liquid electrolyte, and the pulverization effect of the electrode after a prolonged cycling process.53 Moreover, the Nyquist plots of the Fe3O4–graphene composite after 100 cycles become more smooth and denser. The reason may be the Fe3O4 NPs deposited on graphene sheets induce the formation of a high quality stable SEI layer, thereby contributing to the excellent cycling performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite as anode material for LIBs.48,54
The electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite presented is better than previously reported magnetite or carbon-based Fe3O4 composites.18,35,51,55–57 Considering the high reversible capacity, good rate capability, high Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cyclic stability, we believe that the composite of Fe3O4 NPs deposited on graphene is a good candidate as an anode material for high-performance LIBs. The significant improvement of battery performance with the Fe3O4–graphene composite electrode should be attributed to the distinctive synergetic effects of Fe3O4 NPs and conductive graphene network. It is believed that the supported graphene network serves triple functions (i) as a structural buffer to accommodate the volume variation (cracking or crumbing) of Fe3O4 NPs resulting from the Li+ insertion–extraction continuous process and to efficiently prevent the aggregation of Fe3O4 NPs, therefore maintaining good battery performance,33 (ii) as a highly conductive network for electrons and lithium-ions through decreasing the inner resistance of LIBs and connecting Fe3O4 NPs, thus leading to a higher specific capacity,58 and (iii) the supported graphene sheets enlarging interface areas between electrolyte and active materials, and shortening the diffusion path length for Li+ transport.58 Simultaneously, the Fe3O4 NPs can act as effective spacers between graphene sheets to prevent a degree of agglomeration and restacking of graphene during the cycling process. According to the above analyses, we can conclude that the excellent electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite results from the strong synergetic effect between conductive graphene sheets and Fe3O4 NPs.
Conclusion
In summary, we developed a high-yield, low cost, and simple thermal evaporation-induced anhydrous route to fabricate hybrid materials of Fe3O4 NPs and graphene as an advanced anode for LIBs. The obtained Fe3O4 NPs with a size of ∼10–20 nm are densely deposited on conducting graphene sheets. The presence of graphene sheets not only serve as a conductive network to decrease electric resistance and increase the transfer rate of lithium-ions and electrons but also as buffer layers to prevent volume variation and aggregation of Fe3O4 NPs in the continuous cycling process. As a consequence, the Fe3O4–graphene composite shows a high specific capacity of 868 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and 539 mA h g−1 up to 200 cycles when cycling at 1000 mA g−1, high Coulombic efficiency (above 99% after 200 cycles), good rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4–graphene composite could be ascribed to its special structure which results in the maximum utilization of electrochemically active Fe3O4 NPs and graphene.
