E-mail: acorma@itq.upv.es; hgarcia@qim.upv.esReceived 26th February 2013, Accepted 14th May 2013First published on 17th May 2013AbstractGold nanoparticles supported on P25 TiO2 act as highly efficient photocatalysts for promoting the simultaneous H2O reduction to H2 and CO oxidation to CO2. This photocatalytic process can be performed using simulated solar light as well as light from a LED quasi monochromatic centred at 450 nm, indicating that not only UV but also visible light promotes the reaction. This novel photocatalytic reaction corresponds to the water gas shift which is an endothermic process that is currently carried out on a large industrial scale at temperatures about 350 °C. In contrast, the photocatalytic process is performed at ambient temperature with no other energy requirement than sunlight. Other related TiO2 and CeO2 photocatalysts containing noble metals (Pt or Pd) behave similarly, but with lower efficiency both in the UV and in the visible region than Au/TiO2.Broader contextWater gas shift is currently one of the most important industrial processes for the production of hydrogen. In the present manuscript we report the photocatalytic version of this reaction using simulated solar light or visible light as the energy source and performing this reaction at near ambient temperature. The key point is modification of the TiO2 photocatalyst by supporting Au nanoparticles that, in contrast to Pd or Pt, introduce visible light photocatalytic activity due to the surface plasmon band of this noble metal.IntroductionIn the context of shifting from the fossil fuel technology to alternative renewable energies for transportation, it has been proposed that hydrogen generated by primary sustainable resources will be a convenient energy vector.1–6 While using fuel cells to effect hydrogen oxidation, the only by-product formed is water.7,8 Therefore, there is much current interest in the generation of hydrogen from water using sunlight.9–13 At present hydrogen is industrially obtained by steam reforming of natural gas, hydrocarbons and coal. Combined with steam reforming, extra amounts of hydrogen are generated by the reaction of CO with water (water gas shift reaction, WGS), also leading to the formation of CO2.14–16 WGS is an endothermic process (ΔH = +2.84 kJ mol−1) that is typically carried out in industry at temperatures about 623 K in order to achieve complete CO conversion. The overall process of hydrogen preparation is summarized in eqn (1) and (2). CH4 + 2H2O → CO + 4H2(1) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (WGS)(2)In this context, in the present manuscript we report the photocatalytic version of the WGS performed at ambient temperature with sunlight and visible light. When this process is carried out with sunlight, no additional energy consumption is required, and hydrogen is obtained from CO using the sun as the sustainable energy resource. As far as we know there are no precedents on the photocatalytic WGS.Results and discussionPreliminary experiments were carried out in the gas phase by irradiating a mixture of moisture-saturated CO diluted in nitrogen with simulated sunlight using semiconductors as photocatalysts which have shown activity for water splitting. In preliminary work we have observed that metal sulphides such as CdS and ZnS, metal oxide semiconductors such as ZnO and Ga2O3 and metal–organic frameworks such as Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC: benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) gave very low conversions (below 1% after 22 h). In the case of Bi2O5 and V2O5, the conversion of CO to CO2 was measurable, but still very low. In contrast to these negative preliminary results, the use of various types of modified TiO2 or CeO2 gave significant CO conversions in the presence of moisture with evolution of H2, according to eqn (2). The list of photoactive catalysts that were tested included six TiO2 containing metal nanoparticles (NPs) and three CeO2 having different loadings of Au NPs. Table 1 summarizes the semiconductors that were tested as photocatalysts and their main analytical and textural data. In the case of Au/CeO2, no significant differences in the average particle size were observed due to the relatively small range of Au loading. Due to the strong influence of the nature of the support on the interaction with Au nanoparticles, variation of the semiconductor can lead to significantly different photocatalytic activities. Table 2 shows photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and product distribution after 22 h irradiation with simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). During the irradiation the temperature increased from the ambient value to a maximum of 42 °C. Control experiments where the mixture of CO and moisture was submitted to irradiation in the absence of photocatalysts or moist nitrogen in the presence of photocatalysts but in the absence of CO is submitted to irradiation led to negligible hydrogen formation indicating that the four components, i.e. CO, H2O, photocatalyst and light are necessary to form H2 and CO2. Dark experiments at ambient temperature with CO and H2O in the presence of Au/TiO2 did not lead to the detection of H2. Lower light fluencies lead to lower conversions than using the solar simulator at the maximum power.

The stoichiometry between the CO2 and H2 evolved in the process is 1 to 1, which is in accordance with eqn (2), except for high conversion in which a certain deviation is observed with some H2 deficiency (see Fig. 1). This deviation could indicate that H2 is not totally stable under the reaction conditions and can be involved in secondary reactions as for instance in the formation of methane (see below). Fig. 1  Temporal profile of CO disappearance () and CO2 () and H2 () formation. Photolysis conditions: solar irradiation of a mixture of CO (20%, 4.9 mmol) and N2 saturated with vapour water at room temperature. Photocatalyst 150 mg of Au/TiO2 (1%). The molar balance based on C was calculated as moles of products derived from CO divided by the moles of CO converted. This C molar balance was in all cases over 90% (see Table 2) and in most of the cases it was very close to 100%. This fact rules out the formation of relevant amounts of elemental carbon on the solid catalyst. Besides CO2 and hydrogen, CH4 was also detected in most of the experiments, see Table 2, although in much lower amounts, together with trace amounts of ethane that were difficult to quantify.In view of the conversion data shown in Table 2 it can be concluded that although TiO2 and CeO2 show a low activity for promoting the photocatalytic version of WGS, the presence of noble metals considerably increases their photoactivity. In particular, Pd and Pt NPs at 1% loading increase H2 formation by one order of magnitude with respect to the photocatalytic activity of P25. Similarly the presence of Au enhances considerably the photoactivity of TiO2. In the case of CeO2 we found that the optimal loading of supported Au was about 0.5 wt%. As can be seen in Table 2, the most active photocatalyst tested was Au/TiO2 which achieves CO conversion of about 40% in 4 h under our reaction conditions. Longer irradiation times lead to higher conversions of up to 71% in 22 h and lower light fluencies lead to lower conversions. It should be commented that the photocatalytic activity of both Au/TiO2 and Au/CeO2 is not unprecedented and that these two materials have been found to be among the most efficient photocatalysts for promoting the visible light photocatalytic water splitting.17,18The previous photocatalytic data were obtained using concentrated simulated sunlight. This could be of interest for producing solar fuels that can be a future alternative to fossil fuels for transportation.19,20 However, sunlight contains about 4% of its energy in the UV region and it could happen that this small percentage contributes more to the photocatalytic hydrogen generation than sun photons in the visible range that account for 46% of the total solar energy. For this reason, using solar light is not suitable to determine whether the photocatalytic activity of these materials derives also from absorption in the visible zone or if the observed photocatalytic activity derives exclusively from the small percentage of UV light. Since the current challenge is to develop robust metal oxides with photocatalytic activity in the visible region,12,13,21–23 we have determined whether the photocatalysts based on TiO2 and CeO2 modified with noble metal NPs exhibit activity or not under visible light irradiation.To address this point a series of irradiation experiments were carried out under analogous conditions to those using sunlight, but employing the quasi monochromatic light from an LED lamp emitting at 450 nm as the excitation source. Besides spectral differences of the light, the difference in CO conversion between the simulated sunlight and LED can also originate from variations in the light intensity and for this reason it is not possible to establish direct comparisons between both types of experiments, apart from the assessment of the visible light activity. Fig. 2 shows the emission spectrum of the LED source used in these experiments compared to the absorption spectra of various photocatalysts used in the present work. The data obtained in the photocatalytic WGS promoted by visible light from the LED are summarized in Table 3.

However, the conversions achieved with LED are lower than those obtained with the solar simulator, in spite of the lower light power of the latter. Table 3 shows that Au/TiO2 still continues to be an active photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of Pt and Pd undergoes a drastic reduction on using LED as the irradiation source, suggesting that their photocatalytic activity mainly derived from excitation with UV photons. Also in the case of Au/CeO2, irradiation with LED leads to a significant reduction with respect to the solar simulator, suggesting again that photons in the UV region are responsible for a large part of the photocatalytic activity in this material.In view of the above results we propose two possible photocatalytic mechanisms that will be operating depending on whether the energy of the excitation photons is higher or lower than the band gap of the semiconductor. In the first mechanism, UV photons could directly excite TiO2 leading to charge separation and subsequent migration of the electrons from the conduction band of the semiconductor to the noble metal NP, which in this mechanism will operate as cocatalysts facilitating water reduction to hydrogen. In the second mechanism, under visible light irradiation the surface plasmon band of Au NPs will be excited and will inject electrons to the conduction band of the TiO2 and the holes remaining on Au/NP will be responsible for the oxidation of CO. Scheme 1 illustrates our proposal of different photocatalytic mechanisms depending on the energy of the photons. In the second mechanism, the surface plasmon band of Au NPs responsible for the typical purple color of Au NPs will act as an antenna harvesting the visible photons. This would also explain the lack of photoresponse observed for Pt- and Pd-containing TiO2, since these metals do not exhibit surface plasmon absorption bands. Scheme 1  Two possible mechanisms to rationalize the differences in the UV-visible or visible light photocatalytic activity of Au/TiO2. (i): Photon absorption, (ii) electron migration, (iii) interfacial electron migration, (iv) water reduction to hydrogen and (v) CO oxidation to CO2. ConclusionsIn the present article we have reported our finding on a novel photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water using CO as a reducing agent in the presence of TiO2 or CeO2 as photocatalysts containing noble metal NPs. The process, which takes place at ambient temperature, can be promoted by solar light and the most efficient Au/TiO2 photocatalyst shows a significant photoactivity with visible light. In the context of hydrogen technology and considering the current importance of WGS, our results open up the way to perform a sunlight-driven, near ambient temperature WGS process.Experimental sectionCatalyst preparationThe Au (1 wt%)/TiO2 photocatalyst consists of 1 wt% Au nanoparticles (average particle size 5 nm) deposited on TiO2 following the deposition/precipitation method and was supplied by STREM (reference 79-075).The Pd/TiO2 (1 wt%) catalyst was prepared by impregnating 1 g of TiO2 (Evonik P25) with a solution of 36 mg of PdCl2 (Aldrich) in 10 mL of H2O (MilliQ). The slurry was stirred for 4 h at room temperature, then all the liquid was evaporated and the solid obtained was dried at 373 K overnight. The catalyst was reduced under a flow of H2 (80 mL min−1) at 673 K for 4 h. Then, the catalyst was washed, filtered and dried at room temperature for 12 h. Finally, the catalyst was calcined under H2 flow at 673 K for 3 h. The final Pd content was found to be 1 wt% by atomic absorption analysis.The same preparation procedure as that used for Pd/TiO2 was used for Cu/TiO2 (1 wt%), Ag/TiO2 (1 wt%) and Pt/TiO2 (1 wt%), using aqueous solutions of 53, 19 and 28 mg of CuSO4·5H2O, AgNO3 and H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich), respectively.Materials containing different gold loadings were prepared by depositing the metal from an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (Alfa Aesar) onto a sample of CeO2 (Rhodia). The deposition precipitation procedure is described as follows. A solution of [HAuCl4]·3H2O in deionized water (50 mL) was adjusted to pH 10 by the addition of a solution of 0.2 M NaOH. Once the pH value was stable, the solution was added to a slurry containing colloidal CeO2 (10 g) in H2O (80 mL). After adjusting the pH with 0.2 M NaOH, the slurry was stirred vigorously for 18 h at room temperature. The Au/CeO2 solid was, then, filtered and exhaustively washed with distilled water until no traces of chloride were detected by the AgNO3 test. The catalyst was dried at room temperature under vacuum. Finally, the Au/CeO2 was activated by reduction by H2. The solid was washed and dried before using it as a photocatalyst. The total gold content of the final catalyst was determined by chemical analysis. The average particle size of the gold nanoparticles, as determined by the statistical analysis of a sufficiently large number of particles, is shown in Table 1.Photocatalytic testsIrradiation was carried out in the presence of photocatalysts by uniformly spreading a thin bed of powdered semiconductor, previously pelletized into the photoreactor, covering a surface of 1 × 1.5 cm2. CO gas diluted with moist saturated N2 was introduced into the reactor. Solar irradiation of the solids acting as photocatalysts was carried out using an Oriel solar simulator coupled with an AM1.5 filter that provides simulated concentrated sunlight. Irradiation with visible light was carried out with an LED lamp from LUXEON, LUMILEDS, model LXHL-NB98, emission centered at 450 nm with a maximum power of 16 lm.The course of the reaction was followed by analysing periodically the gas phase. At the final time, the possibility of elemental carbon or the presence of organic compounds adsorbed onto the solid was also considered and the solids were submitted to solid–liquid extraction using dichloromethane as the solvent. No products were detected in the extract. Reproducibility of the data was checked by performing independent experiments in quadruplicate, whereby consistent results with significantly low dispersions were obtained.The gas products were analysed using a Rapid Refinery Gas Analyser from Bruker that consists of a three-channel GC. The first channel analyses H2 using a micropacket HayeSep Q and Molsieve 5A column with Ar as carrier gas and TC detector. The second channel analyses CO, CO2, N2, and O2 with a combination of micropacket Haysep Q, H-N and Molsieve 13X columns using He as carrier gas and TC detector. The third channel analyses hydrocarbons from C1 to C5 in an Al2O3 plot column with He as carrier gas and FI detector. The mass balance of each experiment was determined by summing all the moles of the products in the gas phase divided by the moles of CO converted. Quantification of the moles of the products in the gas phase was carried out considering that N2 remains constant during the experiment and using this gas as the internal standard. The response factor of the products with respect to N2 was determined by independent calibrations. Deposition of elemental carbon or the presence of non-volatile compounds on the solid photocatalyst after irradiation was determined by combustion elemental analysis. The maximum carbon content on the photocatalyst was lower than 0.2 wt%.AcknowledgementsFinancial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa program as well as operating grants (Consolider Ingenio Multicat and CTQ-2012-363531) is gratefully acknowledged.
