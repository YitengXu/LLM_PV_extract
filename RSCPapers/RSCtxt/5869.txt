Pure hexagonal phase KSc(MoO4)2 crystals with a hexagonal block shape were successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method. It was confirmed that neutral conditions were the most favorable for the crystal growth by manipulating the pH environment of the reaction mixture. The process of doping Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm, Ho) into the KSc(MoO4)2 matrix required the assistance of citric acid. The up-conversion photoluminescence properties and mechanism of KSc(MoO4)2: Ln3+ phosphors were investigated with an excitation of 980 nm single-wavelength diode laser, and the energy transfers Yb3+ → Er3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+ → Tm3+ were two and three photon processes, respectively. Since the red light emission of Er3+ in KSc(MoO4)2 was basically negligible, the tri-doping of Yb3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ was selected to achieve white light adjustment. The blue emission at 478 nm due to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+ and the green/red emission at 540/660 nm from the 5S2,5F4 → 5I8/5F5 → 5F8 transitions of Ho3+ were observed in the KSc(MoO4)2:Yb3+, Ho3+, Tm3+ phosphors. Based on the RGB (primary colors of light), multicolor, especially white (CIE: x = 0.3424 and y = 0.3517), light can be obtained by adjusting the relative ratios of the doped ions. The as-synthesized phosphors might have a potential application value in many fields such as multicolor imaging, data storage and fluorescence coding.
Introduction
Lanthanide-doped inorganic luminescent materials have exceptional optoelectronic properties due to the electronic transition of the 4f layer,1–4 especially the up-conversion (UC) luminescent materials. They can convert low energy photons into higher energy photons through a multiphoton absorption process (anti-Stokes process)5,6 and have been widely used in solar cells, multicolor displays, biosensing, drug delivery and medical imaging fields,7–11 which have covered many aspects of people's production and life. As known, both up-conversion and down-conversion materials can achieve multicolor and white light emission, but down-conversion light emission involves multiple excitation sources and complex color modulation systems.12,13 One of the effective ways for generating white light is the frequency up-conversion although its quantum efficiency is low.14 Up-conversion materials are more attractive for achieving multicolor and white emission and have broad application prospects due to their excellent characteristics such as narrow emission band, strong light stability, low background interference, large anti-Stokes shift and tunable emission color via tailoring the intensity ratio of different emission bands.12–14 Lower quantum efficiency does not limit the application of up-conversion luminescent materials, and has not hindered their development. Besides, the excitation source is an infrared laser which is compact, power-rich, inexpensive and commercially available. Naturally, the UC luminescent materials caught the attention of researchers as expected. Various types of rare earth ion doped inorganic UC optical materials have been extensively reported in the literature such as metal oxides,15–17 fluorides,18 phosphates,19 vanadates,20 molybdates,20–24 borates,25 tungstates and so on.26,27 So far, it is still a formidable challenge to develop a single material with multicolor and white emission via a single NIR laser stimulation.
As an important member of the large family of inorganic optical materials, the metal molybdate phosphors stand out from all the materials above because of their low phonon energy and good physical/chemical stability.28,29 It's proved that metal molybdate is a particularly high quality and promising matrix material. Among all metal molybdates, the complex molybdates with rare earth ions are considered to be the most favored host medium for laser ions, which is attributed to their effective isomorphic substitutions over a wide range of concentrations.30 And the rare earth molybdates have been widely investigated as fluorescent substrates in recent years.31–42 For example, Zhou et al. synthesized Eu3+-activated NaTb(MoO4)2 microcrystals with a controllable shape by a facile one-step hydrothermal method without employing any surfactants and studied the process of energy transfer (ET) from MoO42− to Tb3+ then to Eu3+ as well as the multicolor emission in this process.39 Lim et al. prepared triple molybdate NaCaLa1−x–y (MoO4)3:xEr3+, yYb3+ phosphors via a microwave sol–gel method and evaluated the pump power dependence as well as the chromaticity coordinates of their up-conversion emission intensity.40 Anita Kumari and co-workers prepared Tm3+, Yb3+, and Li+ tri-doped Gd2(MoO4)3 phosphors with better blue emission by a chemical co-precipitation method.41 Wu and co-workers synthesized KEu(MoO4)2 crystallites with different morphologies by a molten salt method and explored the effect of reaction temperature and time on the size and morphology of products.42 According to literature reports, there are many other ways to synthesize rare earth molybdates than the three listed above, such as microwave heating, sol–gel and sonochemical methods and so on.43–45 But in general, the hydrothermal method is the most commendable one that combines many advantages such as simple operation, low energy consumption, low cost, strong controllability and many more.28
As is known to all, double molybdates MIMIII(MoO4)2 have evolved into a very important classification of inorganic functional materials due to their unique and remarkable photoelectronic properties, which also make them hold an irreplaceable considerable position in the fields of phosphors, electronics, lasers and photocatalysis.46,47 In particular, the double molybdates with both alkaline earth metal elements and rare earth elements (MI = Li+, Na+, K+; MIII = RE3+) have become a particularly attractive matrix material due to their excellent properties such as good chemical stability and low phonon energy.39,42,48–51 The KSc(MoO4)2 crystals studied in this work belong to the double alkaline rare-earth molybdate; the Mo6+ ions here are located in the center of a regular tetrahedron consisting of four oxygen atoms around them and the rare earth ions are easily replaced by other lanthanide ions of the same type (such as Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+) to prepare the phosphors we need.47 Previously, research on the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals mainly focused on their structure and ferroelastic phase transitions, and their synthesis mainly used the way of cooling the molten mixture and the thermal method.52–55 So far, neither the various morphologies of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals nor their use as a luminescent substrate has been reported, and naturally, there are no reports on using them as substrates to achieve UC white light emission.
Herein, we report, for the first time, the design of multicolor and white UC luminescence in the KSc(MoO4)2:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm and Ho) crystals under NIR-light excitation of 980 nm. Yb3+ ions can be used as a sensitizer and co-doped with other activator ions (Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+) to produce different colors of light emission because of their large absorption cross section in the near-infrared region. The mechanism of the ET process for Yb3+ → Er3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+ → Tm3+ requires two and three photon processes, respectively; the UC white light can be obtained in the KSc(MoO4)2:Yb3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ system. Based on multicolor and white adjustable luminescence, the obtained phosphors may have important potential value in multicolor imaging and data storage as well as fluorescence coding applications.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Lanthanide oxides Ln2O3 (Ln = Sc, Yb, Er, Ho, Tm) (99.99%), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium chloride (KCl) were purchased from Chuandong Chemical Reagents Company (China), and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), Citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (China). All reagents were analytical grade and used directly without any further purification. In order to reduce experiment accidental errors, each lanthanide oxide solid powder was prepared in a nitrate solution with a certain concentration by dissolving the corresponding lanthanide oxides in hot dilute HNO3 and evaporating of excess HNO3.
Synthesis
Taking the synthesis of KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ as an example, firstly, a certain amount of citric acid was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water, then stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. Next, 0.82 mmol Sc(NO3)3 (1 mol L−1, 820 μL), 0.16 mmol Yb(NO3)3 (1 mol L−1, 160 μL), 0.02 mmol Er(NO3)3 (1 mol L−1, 20 μL) and 1 mmol KCl were added in order and stirred for another 15 minutes to mix thoroughly. And then, 0.7259 g Na2MoO4·2H2O was added to the mixed solution and kept stirring for 30 minutes to mix the solution well again. At last, the obtained solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed and put into an oven, and reacted at 200 °C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the product was collected by washing several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried for 12 hours at 60 °C. The other samples were prepared in the same way except for changing the reagents or ratios based on actual conditions.
Characterization
Phase identification of the products was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Purkinje General Instrument MSAL-XD3 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) produced at 20 mA and 36 kV, at a scanning rate of 8° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10° to 90°. The morphology, energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and size of the samples were obtained with a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a TEM (JEM-2100) at 200 kV. The UC emission spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer spectrometer (LS-55) in the range of 300–750 nm using a 980 nm laser as an excitation source. All of the above measurements were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Structure, phase and morphology

Crystal structure of the KSc(MoO4)2. 

Fig. 1 shows the crystal structure of KSc(MoO4)2 and the coordination diagram of Mo6+, Sc3+ and K+ polyhedrons. The location of each ion in the hexagonal KSc(MoO4)2 structure as well as their coordination environment can be seen clearly. Mo6+ ions are in a four-coordination environment and each Mo6+ ion is located at the center of a regular tetrahedron composed of the nearest four O atoms around it. Meanwhile, Sc3+ and K+ ions are both in a six-coordination environment, and they are both located at the symmetry center of the octahedron formed by the six nearest O atoms around them, respectively. The six-coordinated Sc3+ and K+ along with the tetra-coordinated Mo6+ form the KSc(MoO4)2 structure in a manner of co-vertex, co-edge and co-planar. Here, Sc3+ ions can be easily replaced by other lanthanide ions Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm, Ho) to achieve doping because Sc3+ holds the same valence and similar radius (Sc3+ = 0.87 Å, Ln3+ ≈ 0.92–1.1 Å) as them.56

Phase and morphology of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals. 
We know that XRD is often used for phase analysis of crystalline materials. If the constituent elements or the structures of the substances to be measured are different, their X-ray diffraction patterns will show differences in the number of diffraction peaks, the angular position, the relative intensity and even the shape of the diffraction peaks.57 The XRD pattern of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals synthesized by the hydrothermal method is shown in Fig. 2a, and the inset is a magnified view of a dense area of diffraction peaks. All the diffraction peaks are attributed to the KSc(MoO4)2 hexagonal phase (JCPDS 74-2009) with a space group of Pm1 (164) and cell parameters of a = b = 5.774 Å, c = 7.219 Å, and Z = 1 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), which indicates that the pure phase product has been obtained. Simultaneously, those sharp and strong diffraction peaks provide a reliable basis for the fact that the product has a high degree of crystallinity. Based on the XRD data we measured, the unit cell parameters of the KSc(MoO4)2 host crystal are calculated to be a = b = 5.7114 Å and c = 7.206 Å, which are approximately equal to the theoretical values (JCPDS 74-2009).
 Fig. 2  XRD pattern (a), EDS spectrum (b) and SEM image (c) of the pure KSc(MoO4)2 host crystal. 

Fig. 2b shows the EDS diagram of the synthesized sample. After analyzing the test results, the sample is composed of only K, Sc, Mo and O (the Si here is ignored because it originates from the background of the silicon wafer), and the molar ratio of the four elements is calculated to be about 0.91:1.00:1.87:8.23, which is very close to the theoretical value of 1:1:2:8. Therefore, the conclusion of EDS characterization is consistent with the result reflected by the XRD pattern, that is, the pure KSc(MoO4)2 host crystals are obtained. Fig. 2c shows the SEM image of the sample above. It can be seen that they are approximately uniform hexagonal blocks with an average diameter of about 500 nm.
The structure of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals was further verified by transmission electron microscopy and the results are shown in Fig. 3. TEM micrographs show that the samples are hexagonal blocks with an average diameter of 500 nm and support the SEM analysis above. The HRTEM image selected from the red square in Fig. 3a gives a lattice spacing of 0.3 nm, which corresponds to the (012) interplanar spacing of the hexagonal KSc(MoO4)2 (Fig. 3b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image in Fig. 3c further confirms the hexagonal structure of the prepared crystal and also indicates that the crystal exhibits a single crystalline property. In addition, the angle marked in Fig. 3c also reflects the characteristic of the hexagonal system.

Effect of pH on phase and morphology. 

Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern and the SEM images of the samples prepared at different pH values under the same other conditions. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the phase of each prepared sample changes greatly at different pH values. In the process of changing the pH value from 2 to 7 then to 12, three phases, Sc2(MoO4)3 (JCPDS 73-0010), KSc(MoO4)2 (JCPDS 74-2009) and ScOOH (JCPDS 17-0941), appear in sequence. Correspondingly, the morphology has also changed, as shown in Fig. 4b–f. When pH = 2, the component of the sample is Sc2(MoO4)3, which is mainly needle-like; when pH = 7, the pure KSc(MoO4)2 crystals are obtained, which are hexagonal blocks with an average particle diameter of 500 nm; when the pH is increased to 12, the component of the sample is converted to ScOOH and its microscopic appearance correspondingly becomes spherical. When pH = 5 and pH = 9, the components of the samples are mixed phases. It's noticeable that the phase of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals starts to appear at pH = 5 and does not completely disappear at pH = 9. The experimental results reveal that the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals tend to grow in a neutral environment and they can also be formed under weak acidic or weak alkaline conditions, but both have a certain inhibitory effect on their phase formation.

The Debye–Hückel theory holds that every ion in a solution is surrounded by oppositely charged ions.58 Under acidic conditions, the higher concentration H+ hinders K+ and Sc3+ from binding to MoO42−. Since the concentration of K+ and Sc3+ is the same and the number of charges carried by Sc3+ is three times that of K+, the interaction between Sc3+ and MoO42− is larger, and the Sc2(MoO4)3 naturally becomes the preferred choice for generation. Similarly, under alkaline conditions, K+ and Sc3+ are surrounded by OH− and MoO42−. Subsequently, the higher concentration OH− ions select to combine with the Sc3+ with a more charged number to form a polyhydroxy ligand, and finally to form ScOOH by dehydration.


Effect of surfactants on morphology. 
It's well known that surfactants can alter the morphology and size of crystals to affect the luminescence properties of the crystals.59 In order to investigate the luminescence properties of phosphors based on KSc(MoO4)2, a series of experiments were carried out to synthesize the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ phosphor using different surfactants, where other conditions including pH = 7 were controlled consistently to achieve the purpose of a single variable parameter (surfactant). The experimental results are shown in Fig. 5. Under EDTA conditions, the sample still maintains a hexagonal block shape (Fig. 5b), under PVP conditions, it consists of hexagonal blocks and some elongated hexagons with a thickness of 0.1–0.2 μm (Fig. 5c), when the surfactant is replaced with citric acid, the product exhibits a peony flower shape formed by flaky polymerization (Fig. 5d), and when CTAB is used as the surfactant, the phenomenon of agglomeration is abnormal and it can be seen that the single crystal is an octahedral structure (Fig. 5e). This occurs mainly because the presence of the surfactant can affect the nucleation rate and thus the size of the crystal.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ crystals using four different additives at pH = 7 (a) and their corresponding SEM images: (b) EDTA, (c) PVP, (d) CA and (e) CTAB. 
At the same time, the different chelation modes and molecular complementary properties of various types of surfactants would lead to the anisotropic growth of crystals, which in turn gives different morphologies.60 Although the samples synthesized using the four additives have great differences in morphology and size, all the diffraction peaks of the four samples are attributed to the KSc(MoO4)2 hexagonal phase (74-2009), where it is preliminarily believed that Yb3+ and Er3+ are doped into the KSc(MoO4)2 host crystals (Fig. 5a). But the spectral test reveals that only the samples prepared with CA as the surfactant can emit light, that is, the doping is truly achieved only under CA conditions. The diffraction peak corresponding to the (011) crystal plane has been partially magnified in Fig. 5a, which can explain this phenomenon reasonably. By simple comparison, the characteristic (011) diffraction peak under the CA conditions slightly shifted to a lower diffraction angle, which is the exact sign that Yb3+/Er3+ ions with larger radius have been successfully incorporated into the lattice of the KSc(MoO4)2 matrix to replace the lattice sites of Sc3+ ions with smaller radius and then cause lattice expansion. The reason why KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ phosphors can be synthesized only under CA conditions is most likely due to the high water solubility and the smallest molecular weight of CA, which gives the highest concentration of CA when the four additives are of the same quality. Also, the main form of the citric acid present after ionization in the mixed solution is related to pH. When pH = 7, it mainly exists in the form of Cit3−, then a large number of Cit3− are distributed around Sc3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, which have not only the same number of charges but also similar radii. Therefore, the diffusion of Cit3− around the three ions is basically the same and it is easy to induce Yb3+ and Er3+ ions to occupy those positions that originally belonged to Sc3+ ions.61
In order to further prove that the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the KSc(MoO4)2 host under CA conditions, the analyses of elemental composition and element distribution were conducted on the sample (Fig. 6). The composition of the sample is precisely the same as expected, and the Yb/Er elements are present indeed as shown in Fig. 6. Some unmarked scattered peaks in Fig. 6a are attributed to the Si from the background of the silicon wafer. In Fig. 6a, K:Sc:Yb:Er:Mo:O = 0.95:0.81:0.15:0.027:1.96:8.34, which are approximately the same as the theoretical ratio. Fig. 6b displays the overall distribution of various elements in the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ crystal, where the dots of each color correspond to one element and the corresponding relationship is presented in the upper right corner. The individual distribution of each element is shown in Fig. 6c–h. The initial contours of all elements can be seen distinctly except for Er3+, which is caused by the relatively low doping amount of Er3+ ions. This result strongly demonstrates once again that the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions are well incorporated into the lattices of the KSc(MoO4)2 matrix under the conditions of CA as an additive. Many systematic studies on the up-conversion properties and mechanism of our products were conducted based on the aforementioned research, and the synthesis conditions of all the subsequent samples were reasonably controlled in the experiment.

Up-conversion luminescence and mechanism
A series of KSc(MoO4)2:Yb3+, Er3+ phosphors were synthesized under the conditions of using CA as the additive and adjusting the pH to 7. Fig. 7a shows the up-conversion spectra of the KSc(MoO4)2:y% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ (y = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20) phosphors excited by 980 nm (I = 1.5 A and P = 0.944 W). In the visible light region, the emission band is mainly composed of two parts, wherein the emission bands of the green (510 nm to 570 nm) and red (640 nm to 670 nm) light regions are derived from the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 energy level transitions of Er3+, respectively.62 The fluorescence intensity gradually increases as the concentration of Yb3+ becomes higher, and the optimal concentration appears at y = 16, then decreases due to concentration quenching. Surely, there are also subtle differences in the luminescence color of the phosphor during the change in the concentration of Yb3+ ions. The illustration shows the presence of yellow-green and green light, which is mainly caused by the difference in the relative intensities of the green and red emission bands at different Yb3+ concentrations (Fig. 7b). In addition, we also researched the influence of the doping concentration of Er3+ on the UC emission intensity by a control variable method, in which the Yb3+ doping concentration was fixed at 16% and the concentration of Er3+ was changed from 0.5% to 4%. Fig. 7c demonstrates that the optimal emission can be observed at 3% Er3+ within the set range. The experimental results illustrate that the optimal doping concentrations of the Yb3+ and Er3+ in the KSc(MoO4)2 matrix are 16% and 3%, respectively. Apart from the above conclusions, it can be discovered that whether the concentration of the Yb3+ or Er3+ is used as a variable parameter, the intensity of green light (IG) is much stronger than that of red light (IR), which indicates that Er3+ mainly facilitates the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 energy level transitions in the KSc(MoO4)2 host. Besides, since the hexagonal phase NaYF4 co-doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ ions is often considered as the most efficient material for up-conversion of near-infrared light,63 we took the KSc(MoO4)2:Yb3+, Er3+ as a representative and compared its relative luminous intensity with NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ as shown in Fig. S2.† The calculation results are shown as follows: IKSc(MoO4)2/INaYF4 = 0.547 in the green light region, IKSc(MoO4)2/INaYF4 = 0.121 in the red light region and IKSc(MoO4)2/INaYF4 = 0.339 in the whole region, respectively (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

Then, the up-conversion luminescence properties of co-doped Yb3+ and Ho3+ and Yb3+ and Tm3+ in the KSc(MoO4)2 host were investigated by the same research method, and the preferred doping concentration of the former and the latter were 12% and 1% and 10% and 2%, respectively. Next, we explored the mechanism of the up-conversion luminescence of Yb3+, Er3+/Yb3+, Ho3+/Yb3+, Tm3+ three groups of ions in the KSc(MoO4)2 host, respectively. According to the literature, the study of the up-conversion luminescence process needs to be conducted with the dependence of the up-conversion luminescence intensity on the pump power. The luminous intensity I and the pump power P satisfy the following relationship under the conditions of a low pump power density:64I ∝ PnHere, n represents the number of photons required to excite the up-conversion emission level. Fig. 8 shows the logarithmic variation relationship between the integrated intensity of the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+/2% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+/10% Yb3+, 2% Tm3+ phosphors and the pump power. And the illustrations show the trend of up-conversion luminescence intensity as a function of power. The slopes corresponding to the green and red emission of the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ in Fig. 8a are ngreen = 1.91 and nred = 1.74, respectively, revealing that both green and red emission originate from the two-photon process. In the same manner, we calculated the corresponding slopes of the KSc(MoO4)2:12% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+ phosphor and obtained ngreen = 2.10 and nred = 2.09, which shows the two-photon process as well (Fig. 8b). As for the KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 2% Tm3+ phosphor, Fig. 8c shows the results of data fitting. It is clear that both blue and red emission are generated by the three-photon process with slopes of nblue = 2.63 and nred = 2.76, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 9, under an excitation of 980 nm, the Yb3+ ground state (2F7/2) absorbs photons into an excited state (2F5/2), then the excited state Yb3+ releases energy and transfers it to Er3+ during its return to the ground state, causing Er3+ to be excited from the ground state (4I15/2) to the 4I11/2 state (GSA), and then the excited state of Er3+ continues to absorb the energy transmitted by Yb3+ to a higher 4F7/2 energy level (ESA), next the filled 4F7/2 energy level is attenuated to the lower 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels by non-radiative means while a few excited electrons of Er3+ ions will further relax and fall to the 4F9/2 level. Finally, they produce green light emission (2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red light emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) in the process of returning to the ground state (4I15/2). Likewise, Ho3+ is also excited by absorbing the energy released by the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 emission transition of the Yb3+ ions, next the latter Yb3+ continues to transfer energy to Ho3+ for promoting the excited state absorption process and fill from the 5I6 level to the higher 5F4/5S2 levels, then the non-radiative relaxation process occurs right after to cause the 5F5 level to be filled as well. At last, all return to the ground state (5I8) by means of radiation transitions to produce the green and red light emission at 540 nm and 660 nm, respectively.65,66 For Tm3+, the ground state absorption process is the same as Er3+ and Ho3+. The electrons of Tm3+ ions in the 3H5 level will fall to the 3F4 level by non-radiative relaxation, and then fall to the 3F4 level, and then fall to the 3F2 level through the ESA process. At this time, the non-radiative relaxation process occurs again and the 1G4 level will be filled by another ESA process immediately. Most of the electrons produce blue light emission at 478 nm through the 1G4 → 3H6 transition and some of them decay to the 3F4 level to produce weak red light emission.41

Fig. 10 shows the near-infrared visible UC emission spectra (I = 1.5 A, P = 0.944 W) of the above three groups of ions at the optimal doping concentration and their corresponding CIE chromaticity diagrams. The emission spectrum of the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+ phosphor (Fig. 10a) corresponds to the CIE coordinates of x = 0.2095 and y = 0.5277, which are located in the green region (point l in Fig. 10b). As for the KSc(MoO4)2:12% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+, the emission bands of the green (530–560 nm) and the red regions (630–670 nm) are derived from the 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5F8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. Both the green and the red light emission of the sample are strong at this doping ratio, so the final light is located in the yellow region (point m in Fig. 10b) and the corresponding CIE coordinates are x = 0.3611 and y = 0.4596. The KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 2% Tm3+ phosphor exhibits strong blue emission in the range of 450–500 nm and extremely weak red emission in the range of 625–657 nm, which are attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 and 1G4 → 3F4 transitions of Tm3+, respectively. The CIE coordinates fall in the blue region with the coordinate values of x = 0.2030 and y = 0.1256 (point n in Fig. 10b). A pair of complementary color lights can be found on the straight line passing through the white light area in the chromaticity diagram in light of the basic knowledge of color, and the final color obtained by mixing any two colors on the straight line always appears on this straight line.61 As shown in Fig. 10b, in the connecting points m and n, it is observable that the straight line passes through the white light area, which indicates that a suitable proportion of Yb3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ can be used to modulate white light. Besides, this inference can also be obtained from the reality that the KSc(MoO4)2:1% Ho3+ sample has significant reduction in the UC red emission spectrum compared with the KSc(MoO4)2:12% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+. The incorporation of Yb3+ is the primary cause of the shift in light from green to yellow, so there is no doubt that white light will be emitted as long as the ratio of the Yb3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ ions is appropriate.
 Fig. 10  (a) UC emission spectra of the KSc(MoO4)2:16% Yb3+, 3% Er3+, KSc(MoO4)2:12% Yb3+, 1% Ho3 and KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 2% Tm3+ samples under 980 nm excitation (I = 1.5 A and P = 0.944 W) and (b) their corresponding CIE chromaticity diagram. 
Many verification experiments were performed to support the above-mentioned inference that triple doping of Yb3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ into the KSc(MoO4)2 host can bring out white light. Fig. 11 shows the emission spectra of the KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+, z% Tm3+ (z = 0.5, 1, 2, 3) phosphors excited by 980 nm near-infrared light (I = 1.5 A, P = 0.944 W) and their matched chromaticity diagram. The emission peaks of all the up-conversion luminescence spectra are located in the blue region at 478 nm, the green region at 541 nm and the red region at 660 nm, which are in turn attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 transition of Tm3+, 5S2/5F4 → 5I8 transition of Ho3+ and 5F5 → 5F8 transition of Ho3+, respectively. It has been proven that the emission of Tm3+ ions is a three-photon process. It can be noticed from Fig. 11a that the blue light emission gradually strengthens as the concentration of Tm3+ increases from 0.5% to 3% in the three-photon emission process. When the concentration of Tm3+ is increased to 2%, the ideal white light shown in the inset is obtained (Fig. 11a). Fig. 11b shows the trend of the color coordinates of the KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+, z% Tm3+ phosphors as a function of Tm3+ concentration from 0.5% to 3%. And the color coordinates of the KSc(MoO4)2:10% Yb3+, 1% Ho3+, 2% Tm3+ with the ideal white light are x = 0.3424 and y = 0.3517.

Conclusion
In summary, the pure hexagonal phase KSc(MoO4)2 crystals were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, and three different phases and various morphologies were obtained by adjusting the pH of the reaction mixed solution, which proved that the environment most suitable for the formation of the KSc(MoO4)2 crystals was neutral. The synthesis of the KSc(MoO4)2:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, Tm, Ho) phosphors needs citric acid as a surfactant due to the better water solubility and the lower relative molecular mass of citric acid. The up-conversion luminescence properties and mechanism of the KSc(MoO4)2:Ln3+ phosphors were studied separately, and the results declared that the energy transfer of Yb3+ → Er3+/Ho3+ and Yb3+ → Tm3+ follows the two-photon and three-photon processes under the excitation of 980 nm, respectively. Based on the generation of the red (5S2/5F4 → 5I8 of Ho3+), green (5F5 → 5F8 of Ho3+) and blue (1G4 → 3H6 of Tm3+) light emission of the KSc(MoO4)2:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Ho and Tm) phosphors, the white light regulation with color coordinates of x = 0.3424 and y = 0.3517 can be achieved by doping Yb3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ ions. And it's expected that a series of different colors of light can be obtained by changing the relative proportions of the three ions. The synthesized phosphors have the advantages of a simple production process, adjustable color of light, low cost of raw materials, non-toxic and harmless and have potential application prospects in multicolor imaging, data storage and fluorescence coding fields.
