    , Accepted 31st July 2015First published on 4th August 2015AbstractWe report a novel method for synthesizing highly porous polyaniline (PANI) using carbon nanodots (CNDs) as a nucleating agent and demonstrate their use as counter electrodes (CEs) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). CNDs surrounded with aniline act as efficient nuclei in the polymerization reaction. CNDs disrupt undesirable secondary growth reactions leading to the formation of an agglomerated structure, and organize the highly porous PANI structures with a large surface area (43.6 m2 g−1). Moreover, the presence of CNDs in the polymerization mixture facilitates generation of head-to-tail dimers, and enhances the degree of para-coupling in the molecular structure of PANI. As a result of these nucleation effects, the fabricated PANI-CND films exhibit an increased electrical conductivity of ca. 774 S cm−1. When used as a CE in DSSCs, PANI-CND CEs exhibit a superior power conversion efficiency (η = 7.45%) to those of conventional platinum (η = 7.37%) and pristine PANI CEs (η = 5.60%).
Introduction
In dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) systems, the platinum (Pt)-based counter electrode (CE) is one of the major hurdles for large-scale production of DSSCs owing to the high cost and scarce resources of Pt.1 For this reason, alternative CE materials with low cost, high chemical stability, and high electro-catalytic activity are highly desirable. Recently, various types of CEs based on carbon materials, transition metal complexes, and conducting polymers have been investigated as promising candidates to replace Pt-based CEs.2 In particular, conducting polymers have many merits such as high electrochemical activity, transparency, low cost, and simple preparation.3–5
As a representative conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI) is suitable for CEs because of its superior catalytic activity for I3− reduction and environmental stability.6,7 Among the various preparation methods of PANI electrodes, PANI-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) can produce PANI thin-films with two or three orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity (≥500 S cm−1) than that of pristine PANI powder due to the expanded chain conformation with the help of CSA and meta-cresol solvent.8 Several studies utilized PANI-CSA for CEs in DSSCs, and represented conversion efficiencies of 5.5%, 6.2%, and 6.3%.9–11 However, the still insufficient conductivity has limited the high conversion efficiency of DSSCs with PANI-CSA electrodes. One of the main reasons to degrade electrical properties of the PANI-CSA film is the low surface area of PANI before solvation with meta-cresol. Typically, PANI is polymerized at low temperature to achieve high purity in the molecular structure.12 This method requires a long reaction time to attain a sufficient yield (≥30%) of PANI. During this time, polymer structures agglomerate by the growth onto the previously formed polymer, known as the secondary growth.13 The agglomerated structure leads to a lower surface area that is available for contact with the doping agent or solvent, eventually resulting in deteriorated electrical properties of PANI-CSA films. Therefore, organizing nanostructured PANI without agglomeration during the entire polymerization process is crucial to the electrochemical performance of PANI-CSA electrodes as CEs in DSSCs.
In previous studies, metal nanoparticles including TiO2, SiO2, and CdS were employed as seeds to organize the nanostructure of PANI.14–16 Although the metal nanoparticles drastically increased the surface areas of PANI (≥100 m2 g−1), electrical conductivity was low owing to relatively high concentrations of the seeds in the PANI. Moreover, the low uniformity of the seeds and necessity of additional surface modification to combine monomers are also challenging. In this regard, it is crucially required to develop a novel nucleating agent with high uniformity and ability to increase the surface area even in small amounts.
Herein, we report a novel method to synthesize highly porous nanostructured PANI using carbon nanodots (CNDs) as a nucleating agent for high-performance CEs of DSSCs. CNDs are carbonaceous clusters of less than 10 nm in diameter, which have received growing interest as a state of the art nanomaterial due to their ease of synthesis, chemical inertness, and low toxicity.17,18 In this work, CNDs played an important role in organizing porous structures of PANI by providing the nuclei of polymerization to prevent the secondary growth. The surface state of CNDs with rich carboxyl groups is appropriate for combination with aniline monomers and nanometer-sized dots could function as an efficient nucleating agent even at a low concentration. The enhanced structural properties of PANI by CND-induced nucleation increased electrical conductivity and enabled successful utilization as a CE in DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of using CNDs to enhance the electrochemical performance of PANI-CSA as a CE for DSSC. The nucleation effects of CNDs on the structural, electrical, and electrochemical characteristics of PANI-CND nanocomposites were systematically investigated using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, FT-IR and NMR spectra, and XRD patterns, respectively. The CEs fabricated with PANI-CND exhibited excellent electro-catalytic activity comparable to that of conventional Pt-based CEs and were characterized using CV and EIS measurements. These results show that zero-dimensional carbon materials can have great impacts on the structural and electrical properties of PANI.
Experimental section
Materials
Citric acid (99%), aniline (99%), and ammonium persulfate (APS, 98%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). TiO2 nanoparticles (Ti-nanoxide T/SP), cis-disothiocyanato-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato)ruthenium-(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719), butylmethylimidazolium iodide (BMII), lithium iodide, and iodine were purchased from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland). Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35–37%), boric acid (H3BO3, 99.5%), chloroform (CHCl3, 98%) and ammonia solution (NH4OH) were purchased from Samchun (Seoul, Korea).
Preparation of carbon nanodots
1 g of citric acid was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave (20 mL) and then heated at 180 °C in an electric oven for 4 h. In order to neutralize the CNDs, NaOH aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) was dropped into the resulting orange transparent liquid. The CND powder could be obtained by adding ethanol solvents into the CND solution followed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitates of CNDs were dried in an oven at 60 °C.
Synthesis of PANI-CND nanocomposites and fabrication of PANI-CND counter electrodes
PANI-CND emeraldine salt (ES) powder was synthesized using a self-stabilized dispersion polymerization (SSDP) method based on chemical oxidation polymerization at −42.5 °C.12 2 g of aniline monomer and 10 mL of HCl solution were added to 30 mL of deionized water. The obtained CND powder (the weight percentage of CND powder was 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt% with respect to aniline, respectively) and boric acid (1 mg) were dispersed into the aqueous anilinium ion solution, and then the solution was stirred at 50 °C for 3 h for passivation. 60 mL of chloroform was poured into the aqueous anilinium ion solution in order to induce interfacial polymerizations of aniline monomers. The oxidizing agent was prepared by adding 2.4 g of APS and 6 mL of HCl into the 10 mL of deionized water, and the resulting oxidizing agent was added into the reaction medium to initiate polymerization at −9 °C. The polymerization of aniline proceeded with vigorous stirring for 16 h at −42.5 °C. After washing with water, ethanol, and acetone, precipitates of greenish PANI-CND ES powder were obtained. The PANI-CND ES was fully reduced by adding 207.5 mL of 0.6 M NH4OH solution as a reducing agent. The products were washed with water, ethanol, and acetone as above in order to gain brownish PANI-CND emeraldine base (EB) powders. Secondary doping of the PANI-CND EB powders was conducted with CSA (CSA:PANI-CND EB = 2:1 by mole). 0.165 g of CSA-doped PANI-CND powders were dissolved in 5.0 mL of the meta-cresol/chloroform (7:3, v/v) co-solvent. The solution was vigorously stirred and sonochemically treated for 24 h to increase the solubility of PANI-CND powders within the solutions. In order to prepare PANI-CND CEs, the resulting CSA-doped PANI-CND solutions were fabricated as thin films onto the fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate using a spin-coater at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The spin-coated thin-film electrodes were dried at 40 °C for 16 h, and finally 650 nm PANI-CND CEs on FTO glass substrates were obtained.
Assembly of DSSCs with Pt and PANI-CND counter electrodes
FTO glass substrates were washed with deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol for 60 min, respectively. The FTO glass substrate for the photoanode was pretreated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution and heated at 450 °C for 30 min to form TiO2 compact layers on the FTO substrates. A paste of TiO2 nanoparticles was screen-printed onto the FTO glass substrate. Sintering of the TiO2-coated FTO glasses was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. The FTO glasses with TiO2 thin films were immersed in the dye solution (0.5 mM N719 dye in absolute ethanol) for 18 h at 25 °C. The as-prepared working electrodes were assembled with the PANI-CND thin-film CEs into sandwich-type cells. A drop of the redox electrolyte (0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) was injected into the cell. For comparison of their overall performance to that of conventional CEs, a Pt-coated CE was prepared by dropping 5 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) onto the FTO substrate followed by heat treatment at 400 °C for 30 min.
Characterization of materials and investigation of the counter electrodes and DSSC performance
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy images were obtained with a JEM 2100 (JEOL, Japan) and a JEM 3010 (JEOL, Japan). Morphological images of PANI-CND were acquired using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL, Japan) and an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Innova SPM, Vecco, USA). The X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded by using an AXIS-His spectrometer (Kratos/Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of PANI were obtained using a Micromeritic analyzer (ASAP 2000, Micromeritic Co., USA). Microstructural characterization of the PANI-CND EB was performed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Frontier FT-IR spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, USA) and solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy (Avance II, Bruker, Germany). The electrical conductivity was measured with a four-probe system using a KEITHLY 2400 (KEITHLY, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken by using Smartlab (Rigaku, Japan). CV (WBCS 3000, Wonatech, Korea) was conducted in an electrolyte containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. The symmetrical dummy cells were prepared by assembling two identical CEs and injecting the electrolyte as used for DSSCs to measure EIS and Tafel polarization curves using Zive lab (Wonatech, Korea). The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSSCs with various counter electrodes were evaluated using a 500 W xenon lamp (XIL model 05A50KS source units; AM 1.5G solar irradiance; intensity: 100 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of highly porous PANI-CND and fabrication of PANI-CND counter electrodes

Fig. 1 illustrates the overall procedure to synthesize highly porous PANI using CNDs as a nucleating agent and obtain PANI-CND electrodes. CNDs were prepared using a solvothermal process from citric acid. TEM and HR-TEM images of CNDs are shown in Fig. 2a. The mean diameter of the as-made nanodots was ca. 4.1 nm, with a narrow size distribution of ±0.6 nm. The inset image suggests that the interior of the CNDs has a lattice spacing of 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (1120) face of graphite.19,20 Conversely, the XPS spectra in Fig. 2b indicate that the surface of the CNDs has rich oxygen-containing functional groups. In particular, a peak of 288.6 eV related to carboxyl groups is predominant, which are favorable for reaction with aniline. The obtained CNDs were combined with anilinium ions using boric acid, which catalyzes formation of amide bonds between carboxyl groups and amine groups.21 Photoluminescence (PL) and zeta potential measurements were conducted to identify the transition in the surface states of CNDs by combination with aniline monomers (Fig. S1†). PL spectra of CNDs red-shifted after passivation because the amine groups of aniline lower the band gap of CNDs by donating electrons.22 The zeta potentials of CNDs and passivated CNDs were determined to be −15.2 mV and −5.4 mV, respectively. The negatively charged CNDs were partially neutralized by interaction with aniline monomers.23 After combination of CNDs with aniline monomers, anilinium ions preferentially arranged themselves around the surfaces of CNDs passivated with benzene rings. As an ammonium persulfate (APS) solution was added to produce radicals, CNDs aggregated with aniline monomers began to precipitate due to the insolubility of PANI in water. These precipitates acted as nucleation points, grew into a polymer, and resulted in highly defined porous PANI. The obtained PANI-CND was subsequently dedoped with ammonium hydroxide and given a secondary doping with CSA. This was then dissolved in meta-cresol/chloroform solvents, spin-coated onto substrates, and annealed to yield transparent green PANI-CND electrodes.

CNDs combine with aniline monomers by boric acid, and begin growing into a polymer as a radical initiator (ammonium persulfate, APS) participates in the polymerization reaction. The obtained PANI-CND is doped with ammonium hydroxide and camphorsulfonic acid, dissolved in the solvents, and spin-coated onto FTO glass substrates.

Structural characterization of highly porous PANI-CND
In FE-SEM images of Fig. 3, the morphological features of PANI are observed by varying the concentrations of CNDs added into the polymerization mixture. The micrograph of Fig. 3a shows pristine PANI after polymerization. Secondary growth on previously formed structures was evident and the original porous structure was obscured by agglomeration. In contrast, PANI that had been formed via nucleation on CNDs exhibited a highly defined and porous structure. The CNDs facilitated the continuous generation of nuclei such that homogeneous nucleation was maintained despite relatively long polymerization times. In general, newly polymerized PANI molecules could either grow from previously constructed PANI structures (heterogeneous nucleation) or from nuclei (homogeneous nucleation).13 In conventional methods, heterogeneous nucleation is preferred in the later stages of polymerization because PANI structures that are already formed become dominant.13 On the other hand, nuclei generated from CNDs can easily exceed supersaturation levels, thereby facilitating homogeneous nucleation even during the later stages of polymerization. Thus, in the presence of CNDs, agglomerated structures resulting from secondary growth were prevented and the high-surface-area porous structure that characterizes the initial stage of polymerization was preserved. However, when adding CNDs more than the optimized amount (5 wt%), the PANI structure agglomerated because excessive nuclei generated from CNDs might aggregate among themselves (Fig. 3d).
 Fig. 3  FE-SEM images of the synthesized (a) PANI and PANI polymerized with the addition of (b) 1 wt%, (c) 5 wt%, and (d) 10 wt% of CNDs. All the polymerization reactions proceeded for 16 h after the initiator solution was added into the aqueous anilinium solution. 
The porosity of PANI and PANI-CND was determined by measuring nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms (Fig. 4a). The curves of both materials exhibited hysteresis when the nitrogen was desorbed, indicating that the samples were mesoporous materials.24,25 Surface areas and total pore volumes were obtained using the BET method (Table 1). Among the samples, PANI with 5 wt% CNDs had the largest surface area of 43.64 m2 g−1, which was 3.5 times that of pristine PANI (12.43 m2 g−1). Both the surface area and pore volume decreased at CND weight ratios exceeding 5%, indicating that excessive nucleation caused agglomeration as shown in Fig. 3d. Fig. 4b shows the size distribution of pores in the PANI structure. No obvious peaks were observed in the pore size distribution of pristine PANI on account of its agglomerated morphology, but the number of pores in PANI-CND ranging from 20 to 50 nm significantly increased.

The nucleation of PANI on CNDs not only constructed porous morphology of the polymer, but also improved the purity of the PANI molecular structure. To compare the as-prepared samples with their ideal molecular structures, PANI and the PANI-CND emeraldine base (EB) were characterized by FT-IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The degree of para-coupling in the PANI microstructure was estimated from FT-IR spectra (Fig. 5a). The absorption band at ca. 1500 cm−1 is attributable to the CC stretching vibration mode of the benzene ring.12 This peak is infrared-inactive when the benzene moiety is substituted with identical groups on a para-pair.12 The absorption band at 820 cm−1 originates from the C–H out-of-plane bending mode of the 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.12 Thus, a ratio of peak intensities at 820 cm−1 and 1500 cm−1 (I820/I1500) was used to measure the degree of para-coupling in PANI. The I820/I1500 ratio of PANI-CND (I820/I1500 = 0.94) increased by 0.13 with respect to that of pristine PANI (I820/I1500 = 0.81), indicating an enhancement in the degree of para-coupling. The 13C NMR spectra in Fig. 5b, obtained using the CP MAS method, indicated an alternating benzenoid–quinoid structure in the PANI EB.12 Three individual peaks and three shoulder peaks were observed at 113 (shoulder), 122, 137 (shoulder), 141, 148 (shoulder), and 157 ppm, relative to the tetramethylsilane, in the NMR spectra of samples. These peaks were assigned to carbon atoms in the ideal molecular structure of the PANI EB. In particular, the peak at 137 ppm corresponds to protonated carbon atom C4 in the quinoid ring owing to its inability to rotate around the bent linkage of the imine group (N–) in the idealized repeat unit of the PANI EB.15 The peak at 137 ppm in the spectra of PANI-CNDs increased relative to that of pristine PANI, implying that the alternating microstructure in the para-direction was enhanced. These enhancements in the degree of para-coupling resulted from the nucleation on CNDs, which significantly decreased the generation of undesirable dimers by facilitating the head-to-tail coupling. In general, three types of dimers can be formed upon the oxidation of aniline via (1) head-to-tail coupling (para-aminodiphenylamine), (2) head-to-head coupling (N,N-diphenylhydrazine), or (3) tail-to-tail coupling (benzidine).26,27 Two dimeric species of N,N-diphenylhydrazine and benzidine may also participate in the propagation of the polymer chain, but these dimers reduce the degree of para-coupling.26,27 In our method, aniline monomers assumed a specific orientation due to the hydrophobicity of the passivated CNDs, resulting in more head-to-tail coupling. By facilitating the generation of desirable dimers, ideal PANI microstructures were realized with high purity.

Electrical conductivity and crystallinity of PANI-CND films
The effect of CND-induced nucleation on the electrical conductivity and crystalline structure of CSA-doped PANI films were determined using four-point probe resistivity measurements and XRD studies. Fig. 6a shows the electrical conductivity of PANI and PANI-CND films. The maximum film conductivity (815 S cm−1, average: 774 S cm−1) of PANI-CND was obtained with 5 wt% CNDs. The average conductivity of the pristine PANI films was ca. 596 S cm−1. This increase in conductivity can be explained as follows. (1) The increased surface area of PANI-CND facilitated dedoping and secondary doping reactions. The highly defined porous structure of PANI-CNDs can be more effectively reduced with NH3 molecules and can accommodate more CSA molecules during secondary doping, relative to PANI synthesized by conventional means. (2) Interactions between the PANI and meta-cresol/chloroform solvents may be increased due to the enlarged surface area of PANI-CNDs. It is known that the meta-cresol/chloroform solvents induce the electrostatic repulsion between positive charges on the PANI chains.28 Hence, the highly porous PANI-CND structure resulted in a more expanded coil conformation and higher linearity of the polymer chains, which greatly enhanced the crystallinity of the PANI-CND films. For this reason, cross sections of drop-casted PANI and PANI-CND films clearly showed a different stacked morphology. In FE-SEM images of Fig. 7, PANI-CND (5 and 10 wt%) films are densely stacked with vertical separation relative to pristine PANI and PANI-CND (1 wt%) films. The relatively large surface areas of PANI-CNDs (5 and 10 wt%) strengthened the stacking of polymer chains along the particular direction and increased the crystalline phase of the films.28 (3) Nucleation on CNDs enhanced the conjugation length of the PANI polymer backbone by improving the quality of the molecular structure as evidenced by FT-IR and 13C NMR data. XRD patterns of the prepared films are shown in Fig. 6b. Three major peaks of the patterns were observed at 15°, 20°, and 25°. When the sample became more metallic, the peak at 25°, which corresponds to the degree of interchain stacking between the phenyl rings of PANI, increased and sharpened.29,30 The peak intensity at 25° dominated the pattern after the addition of the CNDs, indicating an enhancement in the interchain stacking and π-conjugation length of the PANI.

Electrochemical performances of PANI-CND counter electrodes in DSSCs
To evaluate the electro-catalytic activity of the fabricated PANI-CND CE against that of conventional CEs based on Pt or PANI, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a three-electrode system and the I3−/I− redox pair. The CVs in Fig. 8a show typical I3−/I− redox peaks obtained on Pt, PANI, and PANI-CND CEs. The cathodic peaks of I3−/I− on PANI and PANI-CND CEs appeared at −0.24 V and −0.14 V, respectively. These peaks represent the reduction of I3− to I−, which is the main function of CEs.31 The anodic peaks on PANI and PANI-CND CEs occurred at 0.60 V and 0.55 V, corresponding to the oxidation of I− to I3−.31 The current densities at the cathodic peaks, which are used to evaluate the electro-catalytic activity of CEs, obtained on PANI and PANI-CND CEs were −6.18 mA cm−2 and −7.66 mA cm−2, respectively. In addition, the PANI-CND CE exhibited better peak-to-peak voltage separation (Epp) compared to that of the PANI CE. The Epp of the PANI-CND CE was 0.69 V, while that of the PANI CE was 0.84 V. The improvements in the peak current densities and the Epp of the PANI-CND electrode indicate enhancement in the catalytic activity to facilitate the triiodide regeneration,31,32 which were attributable to the enhanced electrical conductivity. But besides electrical conductivity, the active surface area of CEs for interaction with the I3−/I− redox couple can also impact electro-catalytic activity, so the surface roughness of film-type CEs is directly related to the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.33 We observed the surface morphology of the PANI and PANI-CND CEs using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. S2†). Measured surface roughness (Ra) values are presented together. Surfaces of spin-coated PANI and PANI-CND CEs from the viscous solution are extremely flat. However, the surface of PANI-CND CE seemed to be rougher than that of the pristine PANI CE in cross-sectional analyses. Moreover, Ra of the PANI-CND CE (0.67 nm) was larger than that of the pristine PANI CE (0.39 nm). CNDs might affect the organization of the grains in spin-coated PANI films, cause a rough surface, and increase catalytic sites for I3− reduction. Increased electrical conductivity and surface roughness made a synergistic effect, eventually enhancing the electro-catalytic activity of the PANI-CND CE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to further clarify the electron transport at the PANI-CND CE interface in symmetrical dummy cells. The resulting Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 8b. Series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) values are listed in Table 2. These parameters were calculated by fitting the EIS spectra in accordance with the Randle's circuit shown in Fig. 8b. The intercept on the real axis in the high frequency domain determines Rs, which represents the interfacial resistance of the ohmic contact between the CE and the FTO substrate.34,35 The Rs values of PANI and PANI-CND CEs were almost identical (13.15 Ω cm−2, 13.19 Ω cm−2) and were much lower than that of the Pt CE (17.89 Ω cm−2). These results indicate that both the PANI-CND and PANI CE are very compatible with FTO substrates due to the high polarity of the meta-cresol solvent.28Rct, the resistance between the CE and the I3−/I− electrolyte, was determined by measuring the arc of the left semicircle in the Nyquist plot.34,35 The Rct value of the PANI-CND CE (2.93 Ω cm−2) was significantly lower than that of the PANI CE (12.77 Ω cm−2) due to its enhanced electro-catalytic activity resulting from the synergistic effect of increased electrical conductivity and surface roughness.2 In addition, Rct is directly related to the exchange current density (J0 = RT/nFRct), which can be estimated from the extrapolated intercepts of the cathodic branches on the left side of the Tafel polarization curves shown in Fig. 8c.36 Among the three samples, the Pt CE exhibited the highest slope for the cathodic branch and exchange current density. However, the analogous slope of the PANI-CND CE was comparable to that of the Pt CE due to its low Rct. These results of CV and EIS show good consistency, and directly affect the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs made with the various CE materials. Fig. 8d shows the J–V characteristics of DSSCs employing Pt, PANI, and PANI-CND CEs; the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The photovoltaic performance data of DSSCs using PANI-CND CEs with other CND concentrations is presented in Fig. S3 and Table S1.† The short-circuit current density (JSC) of the cells with PANI-CND CEs (13.8 mA cm−2) was higher than those with Pt (13.2 mA cm−2) and PANI CEs (10.1 mA cm−2), indicating that more current can be collected at the PANI-CND CE, which suggests that CND nucleation consequently has a strong effect on the electro-catalytic activity of PANI.34 The PCE of DSSCs containing PANI-CND CEs was 7.45%, which is higher than that obtained with Pt (7.37%) or PANI (5.60%) CEs. Despite the slightly higher Rct of the PANI-CND CE relative to that of the Pt CE, the lower Rs of PANI-CND CE produced good photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs by compensating the gap in Rct.34

Conclusions
PANI with high surface area and purity was synthesized via CND-induced nucleation. In the polymerization reactions, the CNDs induced homogeneous nucleation and head-to-tail coupling of aniline dimers. As a result, PANI-CND exhibited a more than 3.5 times larger surface area (43.6 m2 g−1) than pristine PANI (12.43 m2 g−1), and produced highly conductive films (electrical conductivity: 774 S cm−1) with an increased surface roughness. PANI-CND films were successfully utilized as CEs for DSSCs, exhibiting a higher conversion efficiency (η = 7.45%) than those of both the conventional Pt CEs (η = 7.37%) and the CEs made with pristine PANI (η = 5.60%). The procedures detailed herein provide an efficient and facile means of producing high-performance PANI electrodes for DSSCs or other applications.

 	Fig. 1  A schematic illustration showing synthesis of PANI nucleated on CNDs via self-stabilized dispersion polymerization. CNDs combine with aniline monomers by boric acid, and begin growing into a polymer as a radical initiator (ammonium persulfate, APS) participates in the polymerization reaction. The obtained PANI-CND is doped with ammonium hydroxide and camphorsulfonic acid, dissolved in the solvents, and spin-coated onto FTO glass substrates.
