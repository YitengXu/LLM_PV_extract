    , Accepted 3rd March 2020First published on 5th March 2020AbstractNon-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous interest and made an impressive breakthrough, largely due to advances in high-performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs). The relationship between short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) is usually shown as one falls, the other rises. Controlling the trade-off between JSC and VOC to harvest high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still remains as a challenge. Herein, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) based asymmetric SMAs with different chlorinated dicyanoindanone-based end groups, named TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl, are designed and synthesized. These asymmetric acceptors exhibit a remarkable red-shifted absorption profile, while energy levels are simultaneously down-shifted when the numbers of chlorine atoms alter from 0, 1 to 2, due to the gradually improved electronegativity. As a result, PM7:TPIC-4Cl based OSCs achieved a champion PCE of 15.31%, which is the highest PCE for non-fullerene binary OSCs based on asymmetric SMAs. The superiority of the PM7:TPIC-4Cl system consists of the balanced charge transport, favorable phase separation, efficient exciton dissociation and extraction, coupled with the remarkable π–π stacking and crystallinity of the SMAs. Our results highlight the important strategy of asymmetric molecular design to optimize the trade-off between VOC and JSC, reaching a high PCE.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver promising alternatives to the conventional Si-based inorganic analogs owing to their advantages, such as low cost, light weight, and transparency.1–5 Generally, active layers of OSCs consist of electron-donors and deficient electron-acceptors. Compared to versatile and highly efficient donors, cost-effective acceptors are still scarce thanks to the synthetic challenge and photovoltaic characteristics optimization. Fullerene derivatives such as6 – phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) and indene-C60/C70 bisadducts (ICBAs) have played a dominant role as high-efficiency electron acceptors6–11 in the past two decades due to their excellent charge transport performance. However, the intrinsic defects of fullerene acceptors, such as high cost, narrow and weak absorption in the visible region, limited tunability of energy levels, and poor flexibility, seriously hindered further development.12–21 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) to overcome the above-mentioned defects of fullerene molecules.22–24
The pioneering research of the fused-ring acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) NFA, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC), of Zhan's group challenged the fullerene-based devices and yielded a PCE of up to 6.8% in 2015.25 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NFA based OSCs have been significantly improved and surpassed 16% within four years.24,26–32 ITIC-like acceptors comprise ladder-type fused-ring cores (D) peripherally connected with aryl or alkyl side chains, and strong electron-accepting groups (A) end-capped on both sides. The ladder-type fused-ring core plays a crucial role in the delocalization of π-electrons,33–37 and central cores mainly including IDT,38 IDTT39 and DTP.40 At present, most fused-ring cores are synthesized by symmetric regulation from both sides,41–43 which restricts a precise tuning of the spectral absorption range, molecular packing and orientation. Nevertheless, the asymmetric molecular core can increase the molecular dipole moment and dielectric constant, reducing the exciton binding energy, which is greatly beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transportation.44–52
Meanwhile, the end group also matters a lot in burgeoning efficient SMAs. Firstly, end groups can interact with donor cores to reduce the bandgap, leading absorption spectra to the near-infrared region.53–55 Secondly, close π–π stacking of the end groups can achieve a high electron mobility and fill factor (FF).56–58 Finally, end groups have a great influence on the LUMO levels of A–D–A acceptors and the resultant open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices.59–61 With an increase of the electron-withdrawing properties of end groups, a distinct near-infrared absorption and π–π interaction of the neighboring molecular can be enhanced, and thereby the JSC and FF, but the VOC will drop due to the downshifted LUMO energy levels of the SMAs.62 So how to better harmonize the VOC and JSC to yield a high PCE still remains a big challenge.
Based on the above-mentioned considerations, herein we developed three electron acceptors, with an asymmetric dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-like core end-capped with three different chlorinated dicyanoindanone terminal groups, named TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl with 0, 1, and 2 chlorine atom(s). The photoelectrical properties and OSC performances of these three SMAs were measured. They exhibited a broad absorption ranging from 600 to 900 nm with ultralow bandgaps of 1.50, 1.45, and 1.40 eV, respectively. Their HOMOs and LUMOs descended when chlorine atom(s) were changed from 0 to 1 to 2. When paired with the polymeric donor PM7, PM7:TPIC-4Cl-based OSCs achieved a champion PCE of 15.31% with a JSC of 23.03 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.881 V and an FF of 75.5%, outperforming it PM7:TPIC (13.33%) and PM7:TPIC-2Cl counterparts (14.53%). The 15.31% PCE is the highest value among binary OSCs with asymmetric fused core functionalized SMAs. The superiority of the PM7:TPIC-4Cl system consists of a more balanced and higher hole and electron mobilities, favorable phase separation, more efficient exciton dissociation, charge transport, and extraction, coupled with the remarkable π–π stacking and crystallinity of the SMAs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material synthesis and characterization
The structures of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl are shown in Fig. 1a, and the synthetic routes are displayed in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was obtained through the Negishi coupling reaction between 2,5-dibromo-terephthalic acid diethyl ester and thiophen-2-ylzinc chloride(II). Then, another Negishi coupling reaction was conducted and compound 2 was synthesized through 1 and N-(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-2-ylzinc chloride(II). Afterwards, a double nucleophilic addition reaction was implemented to convert the ester groups into hydroxyls which were subjected to an acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction to yield fused compound 3.

 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of three acceptors. 
Without further purification, the crude 3 was converted into the important intermediate 4 by a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction using dry DMF and POCl3, which was followed by end-capping with the Knoevenagel condensation; 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl) afforded the target product TPIC-4Cl in high yields. The other two asymmetrical analogs (TPIC and TPIC-2Cl) were also synthesized according to a similar method. The detailed synthesis procedure is provided in the ESI.† The molecular structures of the three molecules were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Due to the sp3 carbon linked hexylphenyl side chains and the branched 2-ethylhexyl groups, TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl were readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis indicated that TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl also exhibited an excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) exceeding 300 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S8†).
2.2 Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the three SMAs are shown in Fig. 1b and c. In dichloromethane solutions, all three acceptors exhibit strong and broad absorption (molar extinction coefficient >105 M−1 cm−1) ranging from 600 to 800 nm. The dichlorinated and tetrachlorinated TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl displayed remarkable and red-shifted intramolecular charge-transfer absorption (ICT) relative to TPIC owing to the highly electronegative chlorine atoms. The maximum peaks of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl are located at 711, 725 and 738 nm, respectively (Table 1). In solid-state films (Fig. 1c), these three asymmetrical SMAs displayed broad and structured vibration shoulder peaks ranging from 600 to 900 nm. Considerable red-shifts of 41 (TPIC), 57 (TPIC-2Cl) and 66 nm (TPIC-4Cl) are observed upon moving from solution to the film state, which demonstrates that close π–π stacking interactions could be formed in the films. Furthermore, the optical bandgaps of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl calculated from solid-state absorption edges are 1.50, 1.45, and 1.40 eV, which show a gradually decreased trend with the increase of chlorine atoms.

2.3 Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of these three asymmetric SMAs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in anhydrous dichloromethane solution with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrodes; the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. S3,† the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated through the onset reduction and oxidation potentials according to the equation: ELUMO/HOMO = −(Ered/ox − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) (eV),63 assuming Fc/Fc+ to be −4.8 eV.64 Thus, the LUMO/HOMO values of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl were determined to be −3.85/−5.30 eV, −3.92/−5.36 eV and −3.97/−5.35 eV, respectively. These results demonstrated that both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of chlorinated NFAs (TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl) are downshifted compared with that of the non-halogenated counterpart (TPIC), which could be explained by the electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine atoms. In addition, the molecular energy levels are consistent with the trend of the DFT calculations65 (Table S1†).
2.4 Photovoltaic properties
The as-synthesized molecules were applied as electron-acceptors partnering with the medium bandgap polymer PM7 as the electron-donor for the complementary absorption and matched energy levels. The traditional device architecture of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate))/PM7:acceptor/PNDIT-F3N (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide)/Ag was fabricated to check the device performance of the three acceptors, where PNDIT-F3N was used as the cathode interfacial layer. The corresponding device-fabrication conditions, including the donor/acceptor weight ratios, blend-film thickness, and thermal annealing in the active layer, were carefully optimized (the detailed optimization process is shown in the ESI†). The photovoltaic parameters of the optimized OSCs are summarized in Table 2 and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are depicted in Fig. 2a. The optimized PM7:TPIC based OSCs achieved a PCE of 13.33% with a short circuit JSC of 18.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.002 V, and an FF of 70.9%. Interestingly, when using the dichlorinated analog TPIC-2Cl as the electron acceptor, the PCE was improved to 14.53%, with a JSC of 21.37 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.941 V and an FF of 72.2%. The higher JSC of the TPIC-Cl-based solar cell than its TPIC-based counterpart is mainly due to its broader absorption. When changed to TPIC-4Cl, the PCE of PM7:TPIC-4Cl further improved to a champion value of 15.31%, with a JSC of 23.03 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.881 V and an FF of 75.5%, which is the highest PCE among binary OSCs with asymmetric non-fullerene SMAs. Although VOC is reduced gradually due to the deeper LUMO energy level triggered by the electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine atoms, the smaller bandgap and broader absorption notably enhanced the corresponding JSC. Finally, TPIC-4Cl balanced the level between VOC and JSC best among all three NFAs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements of the photovoltaic devices based on TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl were carried out to explore the JSC distinction. As shown in Fig. 2b, with the increase of chlorine atoms from TPIC, TPIC-2Cl to TPIC-4Cl, the PM7:acceptor based devices gradually ascend the photoresponse region, which is consistent with the absorption range for the three SMAs. PM7:TPIC-4Cl obtained the highest EQE, which is credited to the higher electron mobility.66 Furthermore, the integrated JSC values of PM7:TPIC, PM7:TPIC-2Cl, and PM7:TPIC-4Cl from EQE are 18.501, 21.907 and 22.809 mA cm−2, respectively, which exhibits a good match with the measured JSC from the J–V curves within a 5% error (Table 2).
2.5 Active layer charge transport
The charge transport properties were probed using the SCLC (space charge limited current) method. Single-charge carrier diodes of the ITO/MoOx/organics/MoOx/Ag structure for hole-only and of the ITO/ZnO/organics/PNDIT-F3N/Ag structure for electron-only devices were evaluated and are shown in Fig. 2c, S4 and S5.† The extracted mobilities data are demonstrated in Table S2.† With regard to neat TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl films, the electron mobilities (μes) moved upward from 6.66 × 10−4, 7.53 × 10−4 to 8.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, illustrating the μe values of the pristine TPIC films ascend with increasing number of chlorine atoms. This trend was maintained in blend films. The μes of the corresponding PM7 based blend films were 3.66 × 10−4, 4.45 × 10−4, and 5.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The corresponding μhs were 6.97 × 10−4, 7.96 × 10−4, and 8.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μh/μe values of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl blend films were 1.90, 1.78 and 1.64, respectively. It is obviously illustrated that the PM7:TPIC-4Cl blend film displayed a simultaneously balanced and higher hole and electron mobilities, which is beneficial to the charge transport and thereby higher JSC and FF.67
2.6 Exciton dissociation and charge extraction
To evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge extraction processes, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured (Fig. 2d and Table S3†), where Jph = JL − JD, JL and JD represent the photocurrent density under light and dark conditions. Veff = V0 − Vapp, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Vapp is the applied external voltage. The saturated photocurrent (Jsat) is defined by Jsat = qGmaxL, where q means the electric charge, L reflects the thickness of the active layer and Gmax represents the maximum generation rate of excitons dominated principally by optical absorption. The optimized PM7:TPIC-4Cl achieved a Jsat of 23.032 mA cm−2, obviously higher than PM7:TPIC (18.776 mA cm−2) and PM7:TPIC-2Cl (21.371 mA cm−2). So, we can infer that Gmax for PM7:TPIC-4Cl system is significantly higher than for the PM7:TPIC-2Cl and PM7:TPIC systems. The probabilities of exciton dissociation (ηdiss) and charge collection (ηcoll) of PM7:TPIC, PM7:TPIC-2Cl, and PM7:TPIC-4Cl based OSCs can be derived by Jph/Jsat under short current and maximal power output conditions with the following equations: ηdiss = Jsc/Jsat and ηcoll = Jmax/Jsat.65 Consequently, PM7:TPIC-4Cl based OSC devices delivered the maximal values of ηdiss = 94.9% and ηcoll = 85.1%, obviously exceeding the other two OSCs. Therefore, the efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction process in PM7:TPIC-4Cl based device contributes to its high Jsc and FF.68
2.7 Morphology characterization
The surface morphology of a blend film is closely related to the photovoltaic performance, so atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out and are presented in Fig. 3 and S6.† AFM height images showed that all of the blend films displayed a clear phase separation, and exhibited root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of 0.818 nm (PM7:TPIC), 1.05 nm (PM7:TPIC-Cl) and 1.17 nm (PM7:TPIC-2Cl), indicative of their smooth and uniform surface morphology favorable for interface contact. AFM phase images of the blend film PM7:TPIC-4Cl exhibited a relatively bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology relative to PM7:TPIC and PM7:TPIC-2Cl, which is favorable to exciton dissociation and charge transfer and thus results in a high FF.69,70

2.8 Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS)
To reveal the intermolecular packing morphology and orientation characteristics of neat and blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) measurements were performed. Fig. 4 presents the two-dimensional (2D) GI-WAXS patterns of the three SMA based neat and blend films and the corresponding cut-line profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions are shown in Fig. 5, and the calculated parameters are listed in Table S4.† The individual components of TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl displayed a similar crystallinity in the horizontal (100) lamellar scattering, and they showed a more discernible (010) out-of-plane diffraction peak considering preferential face-on orientation than that for polymer donor PM7 (Fig. S7†). With regards to the three blended PM7:SMAs films along the in-plane (IP) direction, PM7:TPIC, PM7:TPIC-2Cl and PM7:TPIC-4Cl showed strong and similar (100) lamellar peaks at q ≈ 0.30 Å−1 (d ≈ 20.9 Å) with crystalline coherent lengths (CCL) of 77.02, 82.42 and 83.34 nm. Along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, all three blend films displayed strong π–π stacking with a strong (010) diffraction peak in the qz direction. The CCLs calculated from the out-of-plane cut-line profiles were 20.56 nm for PM7:TPIC, 21.22 nm for PM7:TPIC-2Cl and 23.89 nm for PM7:TPIC-4Cl systems. The obviously larger coherence length in the PM7:TPIC-4Cl blend film indicated a stronger crystallinity than those of the TPIC and TPIC-2Cl-based films, contributing to the charge transport and photovoltaic performance in the devices.68

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole based asymmetric small molecule acceptors with different chlorinated dicyanoindanone-based end groups, named TPIC, TPIC-2Cl and TPIC-4Cl, were synthesized and characterized. These materials exhibited a strong and broad absorption from 600 to 900 nm and optical bandgaps of below 1.50 eV in films. With the increase of chlorine atoms, the absorption edge of the SMAs show significantly red-shifted and gradually decreased optical bandgaps, although they also simultaneously cause down-shifted LUMO energy levels and notably enhanced electron mobility. When combined with polymer donor PM7, PM7:TPIC-4Cl based OSCs delivered a champion PCE of 15.31% with a relatively low VOC of 0.881 V, significantly enhanced JSC of 23.03 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.5%, surpassing the TPIC (PCE = 13.33%) and TPIC-2Cl (PCE = 14.53%) based OSCs. The photovoltaic efficiency of 15.31% is the highest value among binary OSCs based on asymmetric acceptors ever reported. These results demonstrate that dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-containing a fused-ring as the asymmetric donor core, together with electron-withdrawing chlorinated dicyanoindanone as the terminal unit is a successful and expanded strategy to construct high-performance NF-SMAs.
