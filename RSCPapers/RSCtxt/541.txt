    , Accepted 23rd August 2014First published on 26th August 2014AbstractThe structural and electronic properties of an organic dye C258 before and after being adsorbed onto a TiO2(101) surface by two adsorption modes, monodentate (Mha) and bidentate bridging (BBH), have been investigated in detail. The combination of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), density functional theory (DFT), and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) approaches have been employed. DFT calculations show that C258 has remarkable charge-transfer characteristics, which favors fast electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2. A detailed analysis of the adsorbate contributions of the dye molecule to band states of TiO2 shows a strong coupling of the adsorbate orbitals with the substrate orbitals. Significant electronic transfer characteristics across the interface reveal a direct electron injection mechanism arising from the electronic excitation of the anchoring group of C258 to the conduction bands of TiO2. The adsorption energy and the electron density distribution demonstrate that the BBH structure is more stable and has a stronger coupling with TiO2 than the Mha pattern, which is able to better promote the electron injection to increase the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
1. Introduction
The rapid development of population and economy has steadily lead to a global energetic and environmental crisis. Therefore, renewable energy sources based on alternative eco-friendly solar energy have attracted a significant attention. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered one of the most promising photovoltaic devices due to their low cost, ease of manufacture, and relatively high conversion efficiency.1–4 To increase both the efficiency of light-harvesting and photoexcited electron transfer performances, significant efforts have been made in search of efficient dyes to make sensitizers.3–14 Dyes based on ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, such as N3 and N719, have been reported with an impressive solar to electric power conversion efficiency of over 11%.3,5,6 The Zn-metalated porphyrin YD2-o-C8 in conjunction with cobalt(II/III)-based redox electrolyte reached a high record of 12.3% in 2011.7 In 2014, a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, refreshed the record with 13% efficiency.12 Comparing with typical metal complex dyes, metal-free organic dyes are rapidly developing in recent years because of their high molar extinction coefficient, tunable structures, low cost, and environmental friendly compatibility for large-scale applications with a relatively high efficiency of up to 11.5–12.8%.10
Among the metal free organic dyes, triphenylamine (TPA)-based dyes, such as C217, C257, C258, and C259, have been extensively investigated because the TPA group has excellent electron-donating and transporting capabilities, and its particular structure can prevent dye aggregation and constrain cationic charge to the semiconductor surface, therefore efficiently reduce the charge recombination.10,15–19 TPA-based dyes show a typical donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure with TPA group as the electron donor and benzoic acid (BA) group as the acceptor. It is well known that both the dye structures and the electron density distributions of frontier orbitals of the dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 played important roles in electron injection and charge recombination processes.20,21
In addition to the nature of the dye itself, the combination pattern of the dye and TiO2 also strongly affects the electron transfer processes (electron injection and recombination) and further influences the efficiency of DSSCs, thus it has received widespread attention from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints.
By comparing with other metal-oxide surfaces, such as rutile, several different geometries of the dye adsorbed on anatase (101) can be determined. The molecular and dissociative adsorptions of formic acid are the two most studied types of configurations. In the case of molecular coordination, there are four different binding forms, i.e., monodentate through CO (Mha), monodentate through OH (Mhb), bidentate chelating (B(h)), and bidentate bridging (BB(h)).22 For dissociative adsorption, there are also four possible patterns, monodentate ester-type (MH), monodentate bidentate chelating (MBC), bidentate chelating (BH), and bidentate bridging (BBH).22 A series of studies have shown that Mha and BBH are the most stable mechanisms of adsorption for molecular and dissociative adsorption, respectively.22–28 However, opinions are divided for the stability of the two patterns. Vittadini et al. found that different adsorbing molecules produce different stability, by analyzing the adsorption energy of the different types of adsorption modes.22 Some studies suggest that Mha is the most stable arrangement for the adsorption of formic acid onto the anatase (101) surface. Moreover, Sodeyama et al. compared protonated and deprotonated types of adsorption, with one and two anchors, in both Mha and BBH configurations for black dye N749 adsorbed onto TiO2(101), and their calculation showed that protonated adsorption with one anchor in Mha mode was the most stable structure.29 However, other studies predict BBH to be more stable than Mha.30,31 A combined experimental and computational investigation of anthracene based sensitizers revealed that BBH was the most favorable configuration for M1 and M3 dyes.23 Grinter et al. used anharmonic vibrational spectra to investigate the adsorption mode of acetic acid onto anatase TiO2(101),27 followed by Matthew's work using the same system as that of Grinter et al., both groups satisfying the conclusions of investigations made by Srinivas.28 O'Rourke et al. made a comparison of Mha and BBH modes for C2-1 dye, showing that BBH was favored over Mha by 0.37 eV.24 Furthermore, for a system with two anchoring groups, Schiffmann et al. believed that a mixed bidentate–monodentate binding in the presence of protons is the favorable binding function for ruthenium bipyridyl dyes N3, N719 and N712.32 However, Labat and his co-workers considered that a mixed bidentate–monodentate binding presented similar adsorption energy to the bidentate–bidentate binding for N3 dye, and both modes are outlining the flexibility of N3 for binding to the TiO2 surface.33 Integrating the abovementioned opinions, the adsorption modes arising from strong binding interactions between C258 and the surface of TiO2 are limited to Mha and BBH patterns, depending on the number of oxygen atoms used by the molecule/anion to coordinate with the surface Ti5c sites.22
Both cluster models34–36 and periodic models33,37–39 have been widely used in theoretical studies of adsorption modes and electronic properties. However, the cluster models are usually too small to describe the real morphology and properties of materials and are not as convincing as periodic models. Fortunately, the density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach has been shown to provide the results of DFT quality for the structural, electronic, and optical properties of large molecules in clusters as well as periodic solids with high efficiency and in good agreement with results obtained by DFT calculations and by experiments.40–49
In this work, considering the Mha and BBH adsorption patterns, we systematically explored the structural and electronic properties of an emblematic TPA dye C258 before and after adsorption onto a TiO2(101) surface by performing DFT and DFTB calculations. The inherent nature of the periodical system with regards to the strength of the coupling degree and the mechanism of electron injection are also discussed.
2. Computational details
In the present work, calculations on the structure and electronic properties of the pure dye have been performed with Gaussian09 program.50 The ground-state geometric optimization was carried out by the hybrid functional B3LYP coupled with the 6-31G* basis set in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (the dielectric constant ε = 7.6).51 Frequency calculation was then carried out to confirm the nature of obtained minima at the same theory level as the geometry optimizations. The adsorption spectrum was calculated by TDDFT method using MPW1K hybrid density functional52 with 6-31G* basis set in THF solution. For DFT and TDDFT calculations, the solvation effects were simulated by a conducting polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).53
The structure and properties of C258 adsorbed onto a TiO2(101) surface were studied using the self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB) method. DFTB is an approximation to DFT based on a second-order expansion of the DFT total energy around a reference electron density with significantly reduced computational cost. We used a periodically repeated slab geometry appropriately cutting from the most stable anatase TiO2(101) surface,54,55 where the (101) TiO2 surface was constructed from a 8 × 8 monocline surface slab, corresponding to 12 atomic layers containing 256 titanium and 512 oxygen atoms, with a vacuum ∼60 Å wide in the z direction. For the sampling of the Brillouin zone, the Monkhorst–Pack grid parameters (4 × 4 × 1) were employed for the TiO2 anatase (101) surface, keeping the supercell volume fixed with lattice vectors a = 43.5 Å, b = 30.21 Å, c = 65.8 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 110.3°. The outermost atoms present on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface are 2-fold (O2C) and 3-fold (O3C) coordinated oxygen atoms and 5-fold (Ti5C) and 6-fold (Ti6C) coordinated titanium atoms. The unsaturated O2C and Ti5C atoms tend to strengthen their bonds with the adsorbed molecules and relax inward. On contrary, saturated O3C and Ti6C atoms relax outwards. In all the calculations, the dye molecule was adsorbed only on the upper surface of the slab because the coordinatively unsaturated O2C and Ti5C atoms on the surface tend to strengthen their bonds with the nearest neighbors.
For the (TiO2)256 and C258–(TiO2)256 periodic systems with numerous atoms, we take advantage of the efficiency of DFTB method available in the DFTB+ code56 for geometry optimization, structure and electronic properties analysis, and periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) application. In DFTB calculations, the full geometric optimization was performed using the conjugate gradient algorithm until the residual forces were below 5 × 10−4 au and the charge convergence criterion was 10−5 electrons. All the precomputed matrix elements were held in Slater–Koster files, downloaded from http://www.dftb.org. The basis sets contained numerically described s, p, d atomic orbitals for S and Ti, s, p orbitals for C, N, and O, and s orbital for H. The mio-1-1 parameter set was used for studying O, C, N, and S interactions57 and the tiorg-0-1 parameter set was used for studying Ti interactions58 in all the calculations.
Adsorption energy refers to the energy change of anatase system causing the adsorption of the dye molecule onto the TiO2 surface, and can be calculated by eqn (1) as follows:59 Eads = E (dye) + E (TiO2) − E (dye/TiO2)(1)where, E (dye), E (TiO2) and E (dye/TiO2) are the energies of the isolated dye molecule, the relaxed bare TiO2, and the adsorption system, respectively. With this definition, a positive Eads value corresponds to the stable adsorption onto the surface.
In DFTB calculations, the solvation effects were not considered because no solvation models were available in the present DFTB code used.
To validate the reliability of DFTB parameters, test calculations were performed on C258 molecule and (TiO2)36 periodical models in vacuum. For the structure of ground-state C258, our DFTB results show CO and C–N bond lengths of approximately 1.220 Å and 1.399 Å, respectively, and C–N–C bond angle of 121.1°, which are in good agreement with DFT values of 1.219 Å, 1.404 Å, and 121.1°, respectively. In terms of energy, the calculated band gap energy of (TiO2)36 (2.856 eV) by DFTB is similar to the GGA-PBE result (3.02 eV) and to the experimental value (3.2 eV). The abovementioned tests indicate that the accuracy of the Slater–Koster parameters used for DFTB is comparable with the DFT calculations for the study of C258 and TiO2 nanostructures.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Structural and electronic properties of free dyes
The dyes play an important role in light absorption and charge injection from the photo-excited state to the conduction band of a semiconductor, which are key factors in terms of conversion efficiency for solar cells. In this work, we focus on dye C258, where TPA is acting as an electron donor and the BA unit as an electron acceptor, with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%, as reported by Wang's group.10 The optimized geometry of C258 is displayed in Fig. 1. For C258, the π linker is a cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) connected to the TPA group and conjugated with benzothiadiazole (BT) unit. In addition, there is good coplanarity between the bridging unit and anchoring group, excluding the branched chains, which is beneficial for the electron transfer.
 Fig. 1  Optimized geometry and the HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals (isovalue is 0.01 au) on ground state of C258 (C: grey; H: white; O: red; S: yellow; N: blue). 
To probe into the electronic property of C258, its frontier orbitals of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are depicted in Fig. 1. The frontier orbitals are highly delocalized, which is a typical feature of D–π–A system. The HOMO is mainly populated over the substituted TPA and adjacent π linker units, thus the delocalization of π-electrons of the donor group can enhance the conjugation between the donor unit and the π conjugation segment. It can also extend the effective conjugation length for the molecular skeleton, which can increase the π–π* transition probability of the charge transfer, resulting in a high adsorption coefficient and in an improved light-harvesting capacity. Whereas, the LUMO is mainly distributed over the π linker and the acceptor BA group, in particular over the BT unit. This spatial arrangement of HOMO and LUMO are an ideal condition for DSSCs. During photo-excitation, an electron is transferred from the TPA unit through the π bridge to the benzoic acid, which promotes strong coupling of the excited state wave function with the Ti (3d, t2g) orbitals and subsequently facilitates the electron injection to the TiO2 conduction bands. Furthermore, such photo-excitation features may slow down the recombination of the electrons injected in TiO2 with the oxidized dye molecules.19
In the computed adsorption spectrum of C258, as Fig. 2 shows, the simulated maximum absorption appears in the visible region of 559 nm (f = 1.4287), which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 545 nm.10 The maximum absorption is dominated by the HOMO to LUMO transition with a proportion of over 80%. In most cases, the transition from HOMO to LUMO is the most important contribution to the excitation from the ground state (S0) to the lowest excited state (S1), which usually corresponds to the maximum absorbance of organic dyes.9 For C258, the transition from HOMO to LUMO has a high proportion of approximately 80% in the construction of the S0–S1 excitation. A broad absorption is necessary to obtain good overlap with the solar spectrum to produce a large photocurrent response. Thus, it is probably one of the key reasons for C258 to display a high PCE in DSSCs.10
 Fig. 2  Calculated absorption spectra using MPW1K/6-31G(d) for C258, along with the computed electron density difference between the first excited and ground state (purple and red refer to the increase and decrease of electronic density, respectively; isovalue 0.0004 au). 
The difference in electron density distribution between the HOMO and LUMO results in the intramolecular charge separation between the acceptor and the donor of the sensitizer on excitation, indicating that a large dipole moment may exist in the S1 state compared to the S0 state.60 To explore the charge-transfer features of these electronic transitions, we examined the variation of the total electron density between the S0 and S1 states. The corresponding electron density difference map is incorporated in Fig. 2, where the purple and red regions refer to the increase and decrease of electron density, respectively. As the density difference map reveals, there are remarkable charge-transfer characteristics for these transitions, in which the electron density of the photoexcited dye C258 exhibits a decrease at the TPA group and an increase at the CPDT group and the benzoic acid anchor, indicating that the TPA moiety and the π-bridge CPDT moieties act as the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, respectively. Accordingly, a high electron density at the anchoring group of the photoexcited C258 dye will make the electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 more effective, resulting in a high PCE in DSSCs.
3.2 Structural and electronic properties of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 system

3.2.1 Structural properties. 
Anatase TiO2(101) surface is known to be the most stable and prominent semiconductor that is widely used in DSSCs. The DFTB optimized structure of (TiO2)256 system is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The outermost atoms of the TiO2 anatase (101) surface are displayed in Fig. 3(a). In this investigation, the possible adsorption configurations of BA group for C258 bonded to TiO2 based on the structure parameters abovementioned are schematically represented in Fig. 3(b), where the used abbreviations Mha and BBH follow previous theoretical and experimental work.22,61–64 (All the different adsorption modes of C258 on the surface of TiO2 are provided in Fig. S2, ESI.†) Values of the adsorption energies for both Mha and BBH are summarized in Table 1 along with few important structural parameters (Ti–O lengths and O1–C–O2 angle). In Mha configuration, an O atom of BA binds to Ti5c with a bond length of 1.97 Å, and this adsorption mode also provides strong hydrogen bonding between H atom and O2c atom of the TiO2 surface, with an O2c–H length of 1.40 Å. Whereas in BBH configuration, the two oxygen atoms of BA interact with two titanium atoms on the TiO2(101) surface forming a bidentate structure, and the proton of benzoic acid transfers to the O2c site near the adsorption site. The two Ti–O lengths and O2c–H length are 2.12, 2.10, and 1.08 Å, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and Table 1. Both Ti–O bond lengths are comparable to the Ti–O separations (1.93/1.97 Å) in bulk TiO2, suggesting that there is strong chemisorption of C258 onto the anatase (101) surface. The adsorption energies were calculated using aforementioned eqn (1). In Table 1, the adsorption energy for the Mha pattern is 0.198 eV and 0.845 eV for BBH, which indicates that the structure of BBH is more stable than that of Mha. Our result is consistent with the previous findings for M1,23 M3,23 C2-1,24 and NKX dyes,65 boric acid,66 and acetic acid27 on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface, where BBH is the more preferred, but in contrast to the cases of N749 dye29 and formic acid22 adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. Interestingly, Tateyama et al. pointed out that the formation of the hydrogen bond between the proton in the carboxyl anchor and the surface O2c site is responsible for the higher stability of the Mha model for N749 dye on the TiO2(101) surface.29 The equivalent hydrogen bond is found in the Mha structure of C258 on the TiO2(101) surface as well (see Fig. 3), but this does not change the fact that the BBH structure is more stable than Mha. This clearly shows that the stability of varying adsorption modes of anchoring group is system dependent and deserves further studies to gain better understandings.

3.2.2 Electronic properties. 
The electronic band structure of (TiO2)256 (see Fig. S3, ESI†) shows that the direct band gaps at Γ point of TiO2 in vacuum is 2.856 eV, which is very similar to the experimental value of bulk anatase of 3.2 eV, and considerably better than other theoretical calculations of 2.0 and 2.14 eV.67–69 The density of states (DOS) of (TiO2)256 (see Fig. S4, ESI†) shows a broad, filled valence band (VB) and a broad, empty conduction band (CB), separated by a free band gap. The top of VB and the bottom of CB are mainly composed of oxygen 2p-orbital and Ti 3d-orbital character, which is consistent with the previous theoretical studies.64,70 Therefore, the DFTB method employed in this work was validated to provide reasonable and reliable calculation results. To explore the bonding interactions between C258 and the TiO2 surface, we plotted the total density of states (TDOS)/projected density of states (PDOS) for the clean and the adsorbed complexes presented in Fig. 4 and 5. The TDOS of TiO2 contains broad valence and conduction bands separated by a wide band gap. After adsorption, the dyes introduce sharp occupied molecular bands in the band gap in both Mha and BBH systems. Compared to the bare TiO2, the TDOS and PDOS of C258 adsorbed onto TiO2 indicate a significant upward shift of the conduction band and the valence band edge of TiO2. In regards to the difference between the Mha and BBH, the latter shows a significantly upper CB edge shift than the former, which in turn agrees with the experimentally observed trend to increase the open circuit potential (Voc) of DSSCs.71 In addition, this highlights the importance of the dye-anchoring mode for tuning the CB energy of TiO2. In Fig. 4, it can be clearly seen that the DOS of the dye has a strong overlap with the valence band and the higher energy conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor over a wide range of energy, which means C258 introduces few π-occupied levels on top of the TiO2 valence band. The newly π-occupied levels by the dye become the new top-part of the valence band for both Mha and BBH systems. However, the BBH pattern has a stronger overlap between C258 and the conduction bands and a more evident upper CB edge shift. The peak intensities of all dye–TiO2 systems on the edge of the conduction band are higher and sharper than those of the isolated TiO2 system, indicating a strong electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2. Probably, these newly π-occupied levels may account for a direct charge injection mechanism of a photoexcited electron transition from these π levels into the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2. In the BBH system, as shown by Fig. 4, there is a strong coupling over the C258–TiO2 interface, and Fig. 5 shows that the LUMO of C258 is localized not only on the Ti (3d) orbital close to the adsorbate, but also combines with different surface O 2p- and Ti 3d-orbitals. The Ti 3d-orbitals are split into a double eg(dz2 and dx2−y2) and a triple t2g(dxz, dyz, dxy) orbitals. The eg lies at a higher energy than t2g. After adsorption, the orbitals of C258 significantly mix with the substrate eg orbitals and t2g orbitals.

 Fig. 5  PDOS of TiO2 before and after C258 adsorption in Mha and BBH patterns. Black and blue continuous lines and red dashed line represent Ti-3d and O-2p orbitals, respectively. 
In Fig. 5, a sharply increased integral area of the O-2p orbital in the valence band and a relatively small integral area of the O-2p orbital in the conduction band indicate the probability of electron injection into the TiO2 surface, when the dye was adsorbed onto it. The complete PDOS of all the orbitals are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). The HOMO of C258 in Mha is located near −0.4 eV, whereas the LUMO of C258 shifts towards the conduction band. The band gap of the Mha system decreases to 0.667 eV due to the strong couplings. In the BBH system, the HOMO of C258 is located near 0 eV, and the LUMO of C258 in the BBH system has a bigger shift towards the conduction band with a higher overlap than that of the Mha system. The band gap of the BBH system also decreases to 0.228 eV, due to strong couplings. Comparing the PDOS of TiO2 before and after adsorption in Fig. 5, the adsorption of C258 alters the electronic structure of the surface in the region of 2.5–4.5 eV, which is in the conduction band of the surface, indicating that the adsorption of the dye may favor the injection of the electron to the surface.
The TDOS and PDOS of both Mha and BBH adsorption modes display similar results. It is clear that the TDOS and PDOS strongly depend on the considered C258 adsorption mode. It is obvious that the band gap reduced from 2.856 eV to 0.667 and 0.228 eV for Mha and BBH modes, respectively. The band gap reduction of more than 2 eV is significantly related to the adsorbate contribution at the valence band maximum (VBM), which can be associated with the typical π* orbital contributions of the isolated C258 molecule. The significant upshift of VBM is due to the transfer of protons from C258 to the surface. An upshift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) appears for the dipole appearing on the surface, which has been proved to play an important role in the experimentally measured high Voc values in some organic dyes.33,71 At the dye/TiO2 interface, the HOMO of C258 lies within the band gap of the semiconductor and the LUMO of C258, which is at least 0.4 eV above the CB edge, thus can provide a sufficient driving force for the electron injection into the semiconductor.
The band structures of the two binding patterns are shown in Fig. 6. After the adsorption, the newly π-occupied levels correspond to each linear band structures. It is clear that the BBH system has more introduced levels in both valence and conduction bands. Comparing the two adsorption patterns, the Fermi level shifts by about 0.8 eV from the Mha system to the BBH system. The obvious difference in the position of the valence band and conduction band may account for the different electron injection strength for the different binding modes.

3.2.3 Electron injection mechanism. 
With regards to the electron injection mechanism from C258 to the TiO2 system, we consider two possible characteristics. Firstly, the intermolecular electrons are excited to bring electrons towards the surface, which increases the overlap between the LUMOs of the dye and the TiO2 surface, thus improving the electron injection. Secondly, the band gap can decrease by increasing the open circuit potential and make a red shift in the adsorption spectrum to improve the light-harvesting efficiency. In the band structures shown in Fig. 6, the decrease of the band gap values between CBM and VBM at the Γ point, in particular in the BBH system, makes it more favorable to inject the electron to the surface.
To get more insights into the electron injection mechanism of the Mha and BBH systems, the band structure and partial orbital charge densities for the Γ point of VBM, VBM − 1, VBM − 2, VBM − 3, CBM, CBM + 1, CBM + 2, and CBM + 4 bands are selected and displayed in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively. In Mha, as shown in Fig. 7, the electron densities from VBM, VBM − 1, and VBM − 2 are primary located on the dye adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2, whereas the electron densities of CBM to CBM + 4 are mainly located on the TiO2 surface. The electron densities distributed in the VBMs and CBMs are mainly affected by the contribution of the O-2p orbital and Ti-3d orbital as depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In particular, for the bands of CBM and CBM + 1, the electron densities extend to the dye–TiO2 interface, with a small contribution of the adsorbate, which corresponds to the effect of the O-2p orbital to the conduction band in the region of 2.5–4.5 eV, revealed by PDOS analysis as shown in Fig. 5, indicating a coupling between the dye excited state and the conduction band state of TiO2. The partial orbital charge densities from the VBM to VBM − 2 bands are mainly localized in the π conjugated orbitals of the dye, while part of the density of VBM − 2 is on the adsorption interface, indicating a strong interaction between the dye and TiO2. The density of the VBM − 3 band is mainly distributed on the entire TiO2 slab with a slight density on the π-conjugated groups of the dye, which is different from the VBM − 2 band. The partial orbital charge densities prove that there are strong interactions between the C258 dye and TiO2. This result indicates that the direct injection electron mechanism is possible.

In the BBH system, as shown in Fig. 8, the electron densities of VBM and VBM − 1 are primary located on the adsorbed dye, and the density of VBM − 2 is distributed on the adsorption interface, similar to the distribution of CBM + 2, showing a strong interaction between the dye and TiO2. Though the electron density of VBM − 3 is not distributed in the dye–TiO2 interface, it spreads over the TiO2, aloof from the dye adsorption interface. The electron density for VBM − 4 is found in the entire TiO2 system. In regards to the CBMs, the electron densities of CBM to CBM + 2 are mainly located at the interface. The densities in the band of CBM are distributed at the dye/TiO2 interface and at the π-conjugated groups of the dye, with a big contribution of the adsorbate, which is different from the CBM of the Mha system. The electron densities of CBMs are significantly affected by the contribution of Ti-3d and O-2p orbitals as shown by Fig. S6 (ESI†). In BBH, the lowest unoccupied CB states are mainly localized on the TiO2 surface with big contributions from the adsorbates. These unoccupied molecular orbitals, i.e., LUMO–LUMO + 2, are higher in energy and similar to those for the isolated (gas-phase) molecule as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). In DSSCs, these levels play a central role for heterogeneous electron transfer and their electronic coupling to the surface is, therefore, particularly attractive. The strength of the interfacial interaction influences the rate of electron injection from the excited dye into the TiO2 surface. The adsorbate state, with a strong coupling to the surface, can be expected to possess an orbital that is delocalized over the surface as well as the benzene acid group. A weak coupling would show a concentration of the orbital contribution on the benzene ring. For our systems, there are strong couplings over the interface: the CBMs are delocalized over the adsorbate and the substrate slab, and are not localized only on the Ti-3d orbital close to the adsorbate. The LUMO π* system of C258 is conjugated almost over the entire molecule. The anchoring group contributions to the adsorbate part of the LUMOs are estimated from their PDOS contributions. As the band structure shows in Fig. 8, CBM + 2 and CBM + 1 in BBH are almost degenerated in energy and about 1 eV higher than the CBM, thus it is not surprising that the coupling between the dye and TiO2 in CBM + 2 and CBM + 1 is considerably weaker than that in CBM, illustrating that the orbital matching in energy significantly influences the interfacial electronic coupling.
Fig. S7 (ESI†), combined with Fig. 7 and 8, shows that the frontier occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO − 1, and HOMO − 2 of C258 correspond only to the partial orbital charge densities of VBM, VBM − 1, and VBM − 2 bands, respectively. The LUMO of C258 shows that its electrons are delocalized in the π-conjugated groups and acceptor parts. These frontier occupied orbitals are provided to correlate with the molecular orbitals of the isolated C258 dye. These relevances provide support to the direct injection mechanism, i.e., the electrons generated from the photoexcited C258 are probably directly injected into the conduction band of TiO2.
Efficient electron injection requires the electron injection to be faster than the decay of the excited state of the dye. A strong electronic coupling between the dye and the semiconductor is favorable for higher electron injection efficiency. The electron injection efficiency also depends on other aspects,72,73 including the reorganization energy, the dye excited state oxidation potential, the semiconductor acceptor density of states, the ions in the electrolyte, the dye excited state lifetime, and the dye aggregation, which are not considered here.

4. Conclusions
DFT calculations on the structure and optical properties of C258 show that the dye has remarkable charge-transfer characteristics, which can induce fast electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The structural and electronic properties of the C258 sensitized TiO2 system has been explored by using DFTB calculations. In view of the adsorption binding function of an anchoring group with the TiO2 surface, both monodentate (Mha) and bidentate bridging (BBH) modes have been considered. The dye's binding modes influence the shape of the lowest energy band with a variable spread, depending on the considered adsorption modes. The calculated adsorption energy and interface couplings indicate that the BBH binding structure is favored over the Mha structure. Visualized partial orbital charge densities demonstrate a strong mixing of adsorbate orbitals with the substrate orbitals and reveal remarkable charge transfers in their photoexcitation processes for both the systems. In addition, the strong couplings are confirmed by a detailed analysis of the adsorbate contributions to the TDOS, PDOS, and partial orbital charge densities. The adsorption of C258 reduces the band gap of TiO2 to less than 1 eV, leading to the upshift of VBM and CBM, which is beneficial for the increase of Voc. The predicted structural and electronic properties of the adsorption systems reveal the direct electron injection, which appears due to the electrons photoexcited from the HOMO orbitals of C258 to the conduction bands of TiO2. This investigation provides a basis for further research on the interaction between the dye and the semiconductor, as well as the injection mechanism.
