    , Accepted 31st May 2018First published on 1st June 2018AbstractPersistent luminescence (PeL) materials find many applications nowadays, such as in emergency lighting, medical imaging, and enhancement of solar cell devices. However, the majority of PeL materials are synthesized by time- and energy-consuming processes such as conventional solid-state methods. Here, a series of Ti-doped RE2O2S materials (RE: La, Gd, and Y) were successfully prepared by an energy-saving microwave-assisted solid-state synthesis. This versatile method allows obtaining oxysulfide materials starting from primary precursors (e.g. oxides and elemental sulfur) in a one-step 25 minute process. The PeL materials were characterized using synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction (SR-XPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS), and infrared absorption spectroscopy (FTIR), and the spectroscopic properties were studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and thermoluminescence (TL). SR-XAS at the sulfur K-edge of RE2O2S suggests that elemental sulfur (S0) is oxidized in a first step forming sulfate-like (SVI) species, then is gradually reduced to form oxysulfide (S2−). The RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials show a broad emission band in the orange-red spectral region, assigned to the transitions of Ti3+/TiIV ions. The persistent luminescence of the Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials is long-lasting, being visible for ca. 5 h with the naked eye. Lastly, these photonic materials were shown to act as emitting layers for PeL warm white-LEDs, presenting great potential for applications such as self-sustained security lighting.
1. Introduction
Since the accidental discovery of the Y2O2S matrix,1 rare earth oxysulfides have been continuously studied due to their high efficiency as an inorganic host lattice for luminescent materials.2–4 The intense red emission from Eu3+-doped Y2O2S made this material largely used as a red phosphor in color displays and light emitting diodes.5,6 Upconversion and persistent luminescence (PeL) phenomena can also be effectively achieved by co-doping the RE2O2S host (RE: La, Gd, Y) with Yb3+,Er3+ and Mg2+,Ti, respectively.7–10 Recently, RE2O2S-based upconversion and PeL materials have been designed for technological applications such as bioimaging and phototherapy.11,12
Usually, the ceramic method is used to prepare rare earth oxysulfide luminescent materials, which requires long periods of time and high energy costs.13 The conventional solid-state preparation of RE2O2S materials involves high annealing temperatures (>1000 °C) for periods that vary from 2 to 24 h, sometimes employing dynamic reducing atmospheres (H2/H2S/CO).8,10,14–16 In addition, this process generates high-temperature gradients and thus potentially inhomogeneous materials. The search for environmentally friendly and cost-effective preparation methods for RE2O2S materials is then required.
Microwave-assisted solid-state (MASS) reactions based on dielectric heating have recently attracted attention in the field of luminescent materials for yielding products with high homogeneity and purity.17,18 This process allows local and selective heating with a lower temperature gradient when compared to conventional resistive heating methods.17 The conversion of microwaves into heat depends on the dielectric constant (ε) and dielectric tangent loss (δ) of the materials, both mainly controlled by wave frequency, temperature and sample composition.19,20 Despite the fact that most ceramic materials interact very poorly with microwave radiation, it is possible to use different absorbers (e.g., C, SiC and CuO) in close contact with the sample to act as dielectric heating initiators.21,22 The dielectric tangent loss (δ) varies its magnitude with the temperature allowing precursors to absorb microwave radiation directly after the initial heating. Another essential aspect of MASS synthesis is that microwave irradiation increases the diffusion rates of atoms, making the synthesis much faster than resistive heating.19,20 Due to these features, the rapid microwave-assisted solid-state method is a recognized way to significantly reduce energy consumption and thus production costs.18
In this work, microwave-assisted solid-state preparation will be discussed as a rapid and cost-effective method to obtain orange-red emitting Ti-doped persistent luminescence oxysulfides with high-purity. The MASS method drastically reduces the time to synthesize RE2O2S compared to conventional solid-state methods: a single-step of 25 minutes. Oxysulfide particle formation was investigated using SR-XAS and FTIR in a series of ex situ experiments. Besides, the spectroscopic properties of the persistent luminescence materials have been studied using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and thermoluminescence (TL). Ultimately, light emitting diode (LED) devices showing persistent luminescence features were also fabricated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
Polycrystalline RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (RE: La, Gd, and Y) materials were prepared by thoroughly mixing and grinding the starting materials RE2O3 (CSTARM, 99.9%), S (Synth, 99.5%), TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), and MgCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%). For all materials, an excess of 7.5 wt% sulfur was added to guarantee complete formation of the products. For the sake of comparison of the sulfur concentration effect in material formation, Y2O2S with 300 wt% excess sulfur was also prepared. The titanium and magnesium concentrations were fixed at 1.5 and 4.5 mole% for all materials, respectively, calculated from the RE3+ amount. The phosphors were prepared with a flux of 25 mole% Na2CO3 (Merck, 99.5%), also calculated from the RE3+ amount.
In a typical preparation, 14 g of granular carbon (Ø: 1–2 mm, Synth) was used as the microwave susceptor, and placed in an alumina crucible (50 cm3). The susceptor is used to absorb the microwave radiation and convert it to heat. A second alumina crucible (5 cm3) was then used to hold 0.5 g of the precursor powder mixture. This crucible was placed into the granular carbon surrounding the sample with a sufficient amount of susceptor. Both crucibles were partially covered with an alumina lid to ensure that there is enough oxygen to react with carbon to form the reductive atmosphere (2C + O2 → 2CO). The crucibles were then placed into a cavity of aluminosilicate thermal insulation bricks (Fig. S1, ESI†). Finally, the materials were irradiated in a domestic microwave oven (Electrolux MEF41; frequency: 2.45 GHz) using a previously adjusted microwave program.
The duration of heating and the power levels were optimized following the temperature-time dependence (Fig. S2, ESI†) measured with a Homis H811-451 hand pyrometer. The heating curve follows the usual profile of microwave heating where a linear and rapid increase in temperature is observed, and then a steady-state is established with the temperature remaining reasonably constant17 until the end of the synthesis process (1500 s). The linear part of the temperature curve (from 30 to 120 s) indicates a heating rate of 4.8 ± 0.2 °C s−1, demonstrating fast heating due to the efficient energy conversion process. After the steady-state is established, the average temperature is calculated as 1092 ± 19 °C, which is similar to the temperature used in the conventional solid-state synthesis of oxysulfides (1100 °C),8,14–16 leading to effective and reproducible formation of oxysulfides.
The carbon susceptor has a second function, which is to provide a local reducing atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) generated from incomplete combustion. From weighing the carbon susceptor before and after each reaction, it was observed that the microwave-assisted synthesis of the oxysulfides consumes about 1.2 ± 0.3 g of carbon, making it possible to generate up to 0.1 mol of gases (CO and CO2) in the microwave oven cavity. This reducing atmosphere is necessary to guarantee that the elemental sulfur used as a precursor is reduced to sulfide in the final RE2O2S materials. The reduction potential of sulfur is −0.48 V (S + 2e− → S2−), which is very close to −0.56 V for TiO2 (2TiO2 + 2e− → Ti2O3), and thus, Ti3+ can be expected to be formed as well.23
Finally, the fabrication of the self-sustained light emitting diodes was carried out by covering an AlGaN LED chip (λmax: 280 nm, ∼7 mm2, SFLED) with a polydimethylsiloxane matrix (SYLGARD-184, base/curing agent 10:1) molded into a cap, containing 10 wt% RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (RE: Gd and Y) PeL material.
2.2 Characterization
Infrared absorption spectra of the materials were measured using KBr pellets with a Bomem MB102 FTIR spectrometer in the range from 400 to 4000 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 4.0 cm−1.
The crystal structure of the materials was routinely verified with X-ray powder diffraction (XPD) measurements using a Rigaku Miniflex 2 diffractometer with CuKα1 radiation (1.5406 Å) between 5 and 80 degrees (in 2θ) with a 0.05 degree 2θ step and 0.5 s integration time per step.
Synchrotron Radiation X-ray powder diffraction (SR-XPD) data at room temperature were collected at beamline XPD at the Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron (LNLS) of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais (CNPEM) at Campinas-SP, Brazil. The diffraction patterns were recorded using a θ–2θ detection system, a linear Dectris Mythen 1K detector with 0.001° resolution, and wavelengths of 1.61332 and 1.90781 Å in the 2θ range from 10 to 120 degrees using a step-scanning mode with a step size of 0.5°. Rietveld refinements were carried out using the General Structure Analysis System (EXPGUI-GSAS)24 software suite.
Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS) data were collected at the beamline SXS in the soft X-ray energy range (900 to 5500 eV) at LNLS, CNPEM, Campinas-SP, Brazil. The data were recorded in the XANES (X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure) region of the sulfur K-edge using a double crystal monochromator of Si(111) and an energy resolution of ΔE/E = 10−4. Total electron yield (TEY – Keithley electrometer, model 6514) and fluorescence yield (FY – Amptek, model X123) detectors were used.
Synchrotron Radiation Vacuum-UV (SR-VUV-UV) data were collected at the TGM beamline in the range from 3 to 13 eV at LNLS, CNPEM, Campinas, Brazil. The data were recorded using a toroidal grating monochromator and an energy resolution of ΔE/E = 500.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM-7401F in lower secondary electron image (LEI) mode. The samples’ pre-treatments were carried out by dispersing 5 mg of the sample in 2.5 cm3 isopropanol and sonicating these dispersions at 50 Hz in a Quimis Q335D sonicator for 2 minutes. Finally, 30 mm3 of these dispersions were deposited on a carbon stub.
Photoluminescence spectra were recorded with a HORIBA Jobin Yvon – Fluorolog 3–11 spectrofluorometer equipped with a double-grating monochromator in the emission position (iHR320) and a Synapse HORIBA Jobin Yvon E2V CCD30 (1024 × 256 pixels) CCD detector. A 450 W xenon lamp was used as the irradiation source. The luminescence lifetimes were measured using a pulsed Nd:YAG (Lotis TII) laser with a 3rd harmonic generator (λexc: 355 nm), equipped with a SPEX 1702/04 monochromator set at the maximum emission wavelength of each RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ material, and a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier as the detector.
Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves of the luminescent materials were recorded with a Harshaw TLD Model 4500 system with a linear heating rate of 5 °C s−1 in the temperature range from 20 to 400 °C, monitoring the global TL emission from the UV to 700 nm. Before the TL measurements, the materials were irradiated for 2 minutes with a 4 W EW-098 17–20 hand-lamp (254 nm) with a delay of 3 minutes before starting the measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
A gadolinium oxysulfide matrix was formed from the Gd2O3 and elemental S precursors after a short exposure (e.g. 10 minutes) to microwave radiation, using carbon as a susceptor. Moreover, after even shorter times of exposure (2 minutes), a considerable amount of low-crystalline Gd2O2S has already formed (Fig. 1). The XPD patterns of this material with an increasing microwave exposure time interval of 2 minutes suggest the conversion of Gd2O3 to Gd2O2S and there are no crystalline intermediates detectable. Sulfuration of rare earth oxides happens with the aid of the Na2Sx flux formed by the reaction in situ between Na2CO3 and S precursors. The Na2CO3 flux is not detected after the synthesis suggesting it decomposes under heating to form non-crystalline Na2Sx or Na2SO4.25 Furthermore, highly sulfurated materials were not detected in XPD data.

The reduction of sulfur to sulfide to produce the RE2O2S materials was assisted by the CO reducing atmosphere obtained by the incomplete burnt granular carbon. The Gibbs energy of formation of Ce2O2S by reacting CeO2 with CO–CO2–SO2 gas mixtures in the temperature interval of 1070 to 1750 K has been reported by Akila et al.26 Therefore, RE2O2S materials prepared by the MASS method can also be generated by the oxidation of S to SO2 and subsequent reduction assisted by CO gas.
The RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials were obtained by the MASS method in a single-step 25 minute synthesis. SR-XPD data including Rietveld refinement of Gd2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (Fig. 2) show a material with high crystallinity and purity. The same is observed for the La2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ material (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, a small Y2O3 impurity was detected in the Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ material (Fig. S3, ESI†), due to the greater hard-acid character of the Y3+ host ion compared to La3+ and Gd3+.29 Therefore, the formation of RE2O2S materials becomes more difficult with decreasing RE3+ radius. Higher amounts of sulfur were needed to obtain high purity Y2O2S-based materials (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Rietveld refinement using the EXPGUI-GSAS24 program provided a good agreement between the experimental and calculated X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2). All the χ2 converged well (Table 1), and the phase can be indexed as trigonal (space group: Pm1, Z: 1) for all materials. The cell parameters determined by the Rietveld refinement are similar between the undoped and Ti,Mg2+ doped materials. The cell parameter changes along the La, Gd and Y series can be explained as follows (Table 1): (i) the shortening of both a- and c-axes due to the decreasing RE3+ radius, and (ii) augmenting of the c-axis relative to the a-axis as indicated by the c/a ratios.

The more efficient packing can explain the shortening in the (REO)22+ layer distance along the RE3+ series.28 On the other hand, since S2− is bigger than O2−, they repulse each other more intensely with decreasing RE3+ radius. Therefore, the c-axis is elongated going from La to Y to compensate for this repulsion. It is possible to infer that in the doped RE2O2S materials the Ti3+/TiIV and Mg2+ ions act as substitutional dopants in the RE3+ sites with C3v symmetry. Moreover, Mg2+ was added as an aliovalent dopant that will create defects in the host lattice structure due to the charge compensation. The most probably ionic substitution of Mg2+ and TiIV aliovalent doping in RE2O2S hosts are: (i) Mg2+ replaces a RE3+ generating oxide/sulfide vacancies by charge compensation, (ii) TiIV (residual) substitutes a RE3+ creating interstitial oxide/sulfide in the lattice, and (iii) direct charge compensation between Mg2+ and TiIV. Defect formation in the materials by doping is expected since both Ti and Mg are not commonly found with 7-coordinated sites, like the rare earth site in RE2O2S. The formation of an oxide/sulfide vacancy can provide a more stable 6-coordinated site for Ti3+.30
According to the SEM images, the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ particles have flat and round faces and some aggregation with submicrometric size (Fig. 3). The size distribution of both very large and very small particles is probably due to the mechanism of growth, which resembles Ostwald ripening.31 In this case, the larger particles grow at the expense of the smaller ones owing to the melting of the sulfur precursor at low temperature, providing a melt/flux medium to the particle formation. The ion diffusion in the solid-state synthesis may also affect the final size of the particle. Thus, the microwave-assisted solid-state preparation is proved as an efficient way to prepare high quality microcrystalline trigonal plates with a well-defined morphology of high purity rare earth oxysulfides. The preparation of RE2O2S-based materials by the MASS method has reduced the reaction time by more than 90% compared to the conventional ceramic method.8,10,14–16

3.2 Investigation of particle formation
Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS) is a valuable tool to study the solid-state local structure and oxidation states of elements in materials. The sulfur K-edge XANES spectra and edge positions of the reference compounds FeS, S, Na2SO3, and CaSO4 (Fig. 4) show similar spectral profiles to those reported earlier in previous work.32,33 The oxidation state of sulfur correlates with a shift to higher energy of the sulfur K absorption edge, varying by approximately 12 eV from S2− to SO42− species, in agreement with earlier results.33 The energy shift of the sulfur absorption edge as a function of its oxidation state works quite well for compounds where the nearest neighbors of sulfur are O2− ions, and large-sized cations are restricted to the second or more distant coordination spheres. For the case of sulfides and oxysulfides, they are directly bonded to the metal cations, resulting in a different bonding character that strongly influences the position of the sulfur K-absorption edges.
 Fig. 4  SR-XAS spectra of the Gd2O2S materials prepared with 10 and 25 minutes heating time; spectra of FeS and CaSO4 standards are also presented (left). Sulfur K-edge energy as a function of the oxidation number (right). SR-XAS spectra of the S and Na2SO3 standards are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). 
SR-XAS spectra of the sulfur K-edge show absorption-edges at 2473.2 and 2477.5 eV, assigned to the transition of the 1s core electron to the lowest unoccupied antibonding states of sulfur. The post-edge features are generally attributed to multiple scattering resonances.34 The edge position of the Gd2O2S materials (2473 ± 0.5 eV) (Fig. 4, left) is higher than expected based on the values of the FeS standard (2470 eV). This observation is in accordance with how the structural environment affects the edge energies.33,34 A good linear correlation of the edge position with the sulfur oxidation state was observed for the measured standards (Fig. 4, right). Despite the fact that some sulfides show a variety of edge energies ranging from 2470 (FeS) to 2477 eV (CaS), there is an energy threshold for the reduced sulfur species.34,35 Therefore, the absorption edge at 2474 eV in the Gd2O2S materials (Fig. 4, left) was assigned to the K-edge of sulfur in the sulfide state.
The XANES spectra of the Gd2O2S materials obtained with 10 and 25 minutes microwave irradiation show the same edge positions, but with differences in the relative intensity of the bands (Fig. 4, left). The material obtained with 10 minutes of synthesis shows a higher intensity band at 2473 eV, indicating a majority of reduced sulfur species in this material. The same behavior is observed in the FeS profile. On the other hand, Gd2O2S obtained with 25 minutes shows a high intense band in the post-edge region centered at 2482 eV, characteristic of SO42− species present in CaSO4.
The MASS synthesis progression was monitored by recording ex situ XANES (Fig. 5, top left) and FTIR spectra (Fig. 5, top right) of materials obtained after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 25 minutes microwave irradiation. The XANES spectra of the material obtained with 2 minutes microwave radiation exposure show a profile distinct from the precursors (0 minutes), indicating a rapid conversion of elemental sulfur and Gd2O3 into the Gd2O2S material, in agreement with the XPD data (Fig. 1). In addition, the presence of the band at 2482 eV suggests a rapid oxidation after a short microwave exposure time, which is probably associated with the formation of S–O bonds on the material surface. Another possibility is that the elemental sulfur partially reacts with oxygen to form SO2 species that are chemically bonded to the surface and then oxidized to SO42−. The band at 2482 eV decreases in intensity with increasing reaction time from 2 to 10 minutes, with a minimum at 10 minutes (Fig. 5, top left). On the other hand, at longer reaction times (12 and 25 minutes) the band at 2482 eV rises again with the maximum at 25 minutes.

Schematic representation of oxysulfide formation with the participation of the gases assisting the redox process of sulfur (bottom). 
FTIR analysis (Fig. 5, top right) is in accordance with the XANES data, where the absorption band centered at 1100 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching of SO42− groups.36 This indicates that the sulfur is gradually oxidizing to form SO42− units with continuous increasing of the reaction time.
Based on the results from XPD, XANES and FTIR data of the materials, it is possible to suggest chemical reactions for the microwave-assisted synthesis with an important role for gaseous species formed in situ:S(l) + C(s) + 3/2O2(g) → SO2(g) + CO(g)Gd2O3(s) + SO2(g) + 3CO(g) → Gd2O2S(s) + 3CO2(g)
The schematic representation of gadolinium oxysulfide particle formation (Fig. 5, bottom) shows first the melted sulfur covering a Gd2O3 particle, and in that melt–solid interface will occur the dissolution–precipitation processes of Gd2O2S. Then, the oxidation process S(g) → SO2(g) occurs the aid of oxygen in the local atmosphere, where the SO2 might be chemically bonded to the oxide surface. After, reduction takes place with the aid of CO that reduces the S–O species to S2−, forming CO2. At this step, the RE2O2S material is formed and the excess sulfur is liberated as SO2 gas during the synthesis. Finally, the continuous increase in microwave irradiation promotes the oxidation of the surface particle, forming SO42− surfaces again. This oxidation/reduction process can also be supported by the reversible conversion RE2O2S(s) ↔ RE2O2SO4(s) as described previously, where oxysulfates are formed by heating the oxysulfides in the presence of oxygen.37
3.3 Optical properties of the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials
The excitation spectra of the polycrystalline RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials (RE: La, Gd, and Y) show bands centered at 273, 267 and 258 nm (Fig. 6, left), attributed to the host absorption of La2O2S, Gd2O2S and Y2O2S, respectively. Broad absorption bands centered at 323, 351, and 367 nm are also observed for the La, Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials, respectively. These bands are assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions, O2−(2p) and S2−(3p) to TiIV(3d0), as reported for other Ti-doped materials.38,39 The LMCT absorption bands are very intense for Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ compared with the La one. In addition, the Gd material exhibits narrow emission lines assigned to the 8S7/2 → 6P7/2 transition (313 nm), indicating energy transfer from Gd3+ to Ti.
 Fig. 6  Photoluminescence excitation (left) and emission (middle) spectra of the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials (RE: La, Gd, and Y) obtained by the microwave-assisted method with 25 minutes synthesis time. The excited state decay curves (right) are presented as well. 
Emission spectra for the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials show a broad emission band originating from the Ti3+ ions, centered at 590, 615 and 625 nm for La, Gd and Y oxysulfides, respectively (Fig. 6, middle). Ti3+ is acting as a luminescent center in a similar way to different Ti-doped inorganic lattices: ZrO2,38,39 CaGdAlO4,40 BaTiSi3O9,41etc. Ti3+ broad emission bands in the oxysulfides cover a large part of the visible spectra and extend to the near infrared region, resulting in an orange-red emission color.
The emission band position of Ti ions is strongly dependent on its oxidation state and the ligand field. The complex electrochemistry of Ti is important to highlight, where its oxidation states can be +2, +3, and IV in solid-state materials. For example, Ti2+(3d2) emits preferentially in the infrared region,42 Ti3+(3d1) emits in a wide visible-near infrared range,10,40,43 and TiIV(3d0) has a characteristic UV-visible charge transfer emission in oxide hosts.44 In addition, Ti-dopants with mixed valence can be expected in oxysulfide materials.
The nature of the broad emission band and color tuning in the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials is dependent on the ligand field of the La2O2S, Gd2O2S or Y2O2S host, which is consistent with the d–d transition of Ti3+ species present due to the reducing CO atmosphere of the microwave synthesis.10 The contribution of TiIV in the luminescence cannot be ruled out, though, since the reduction potential TiIV → Ti3+ is as low as −0.56 V and these ions exhibit similar radii [rion: 0.670 (Ti3+) and 0.605 Å (TiIV) for coordination number (CN): 6].44 However, Ti3+ has a better radius match with the rare earth cation sites [rion: 0.900 (Y3+), 0.938 (Gd3+), and 1.032 Å (La3+) for CN: 6] and there is no charge compensation involved, which makes it a better candidate for RE3+ substitution. In addition, the body color of the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ powders is grayish, which is characteristic of Ti3+-doped compounds.45
The lifetime of the excited state was determined for all materials and the decay times values are in the hundreds of microseconds range (Fig. 6, right), in accordance with Ti doped crystals and glasses.46 The Gd and Y oxysulfides have a longer lifetime than the La one, which can affect the persistent luminescence (PeL) properties. Persistent luminescence phenomenon is strongly related to the lifetime of the emitting ions; the electron transfer from the emitting ion's excited states to the charge carrier traps must occur before the radiative relaxation (emission).47 The decay times matched with a biexponential fitting, indicating two different emitting centers for all materials. This result can be associated with the disturbances caused by a binding oxide/sulfide vacancy in the emitting center, which is in agreement with the charge compensation processes.15,30
The persistent luminescence decay curves are useful to probe how the traps communicate with each other and also to estimate the PeL time.48,49 The decay curves for the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials (Fig. 7, left) show a very fast decay for La2O2S:Ti,Mg2+, indicating the poor energy storage ability of this material. On the other hand, Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ showed a long PeL decay time, which can be observed for 5 h by the naked eye.
 Fig. 7  Persistent luminescence decay curves (left) and emission spectra (middle), and thermoluminescence glow curves (right) of the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials. 
The PeL emission spectra of RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (Fig. 7, middle) were recorded one minute after ceasing the excitation source on the materials. As the La2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ material has a very short PeL decay time (Fig. 7, left), almost no emission could be detected after one minute. The Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials show an intense emission band, which is quite similar to their photoluminescence emission profile (Fig. 6, middle) that is consistent with their longer PeL decay time. These optical features are in good agreement with the trap structure from the normalized thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves (Fig. 7, right). The TL glow curves for Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ are very similar, showing a high density of traps at 370 K, which is suitable for persistent luminescence applications at room conditions. La2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ otherwise has a low density of traps close to 350 K, and the main PeL emission is obtained at temperatures around 450 K. The more efficient trap energy distribution in the Gd and Y oxysulfides grants an efficient orange-red persistent luminescence for both materials at room temperature.
Synchrotron radiation vacuum-UV excitation spectra of the Ti,Mg2+-doped materials show absorption bands assigned to the band gap of the RE2O2S hosts (Fig. S6, ESI†). The first derivative of SR-VUV-UV spectra present transitions attributed to the excitation from valence band state O2−(2p) to the conduction band (band gap). The energy gap values (Eg) obtained for the La, Gd and Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials were 4.5, 4.6 and 4.9 eV, respectively, showing good correlation with the literature.50–52 The band shifting to higher energies by decreasing the RE3+ radius is due to the ligand field around the RE3+ ion that should be the strongest for the Y2O2S host.
White-LED devices can be fabricated by combining a single light emitting diode with a proper conversion phosphor, as in the case of the blue-emitting InGaN LED (450 nm) involving the yellow-emitting YAG:Ce3+ phosphor (550 nm).53–55 One possible application for RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ is as a material for regular solid-state lighting with the additional feature of persistent luminescence light after turning the LED off (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Persistent luminescence (PeL) warm-light LEDs based on a 280 nm LED coated with polymer matrix doped with RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials (RE: Gd and Y). The CIE diagram shows the emission color during the LED excitation and of the PeL after ceasing the excitation. 
The prepared LED device with Y2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ phosphor emits warm-white light due to contributions of Ti3+ emission and the rare earth impurities (e.g. Er3+) in the Y2O2S matrix (Fig. S7, ESI†). The emission of lanthanide ions can be observed now where the AlGaN LED emission wavelength is close to the host absorption energy, causing a selective sensitization of impurities. It is worth noting that the RE2O2S host is a very efficient sensitizer of trivalent lanthanide dopants.56 The self-sustained orange-red light emitted from the LED devices can be observed for several minutes after turning off the electricity and is attributed to a broad emission band arising from Ti3+ species (Fig. 7, middle).
4. Conclusions
Persistent luminescence RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (RE: La, Gd, and Y) materials were rapidly prepared by microwave-assisted solid-state synthesis starting from oxides and elemental sulfur. The materials were structurally characterized by SR-XRD and single-phase trigonal oxysulfides were formed after 25 minutes synthesis. The reaction takes place in a very short time, and after only 2 minutes it is possible to detect the oxysulfide crystal phase by conventional powder diffraction. The oxysulfide particles are morphologically well-formed and have a trigonal-like plate structure. The SR-XAS data showed that the particles are formed with a sulfated (SVI) or reduced (S2−) surface depending on the duration of microwave irradiation and the gasses present in the atmosphere. This observation can be very useful to future studies on the surface functionalization of oxysulfides, granting new photonic properties and opening a way for new applications. The RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ materials show a broad persistent luminescence emission band centered in the orange-red region, due to the Ti3+ ions. The Mg2+ co-doping may be responsible for creating structural defects, such as oxygen and sulfide vacancies, that are responsible for the charge carrier storage essential to the persistent luminescence. Further EPR studies will be carried out to elucidate the interplay of Ti3+/TiIV to understand the persistent luminescence mechanism. Finally, the RE2O2S:Ti,Mg2+ (RE: Gd and Y) materials act as efficient warm-white LEDs which also show self-sustained properties. These photonic devices can find useful applications in PC-LEDs for illumination purposes with a built-in emergency light feature.
