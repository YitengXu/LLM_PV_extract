1 Introduction
The use of petroleum-based materials and their current processing techniques have been causing issues related to our finite resources and the natural environment.1 Sustainable and green chemistries are directing the development of next-generation polymer materials. Biodegradable materials can be generated from renewable biomass feedstock, and are regarded as promising alternatives to replace synthetic polymers and to reduce the global dependence on limited fossil fuel sources.2 Starch is the main energy storage material in plants, and it is one of the most abundant polysaccharides extracted mainly from tubers (potato and cassava) and cereals (wheat, maize, and rice).3 Starch is utilized largely in the food, chemistry, materials, fermentation, paper, and pharmaceutical industries because of its low-price, renewability and biodegradability.3
The sustainability in materials chemistry depends upon not only the selection of renewable raw materials for their manufacturing, but also the development of mild pretreatment methods that can reduce the energy consumption and avoid the use or generation of hazardous substances.4 The critical challenge in extending the applications of biopolymers for manufacturing bio-composite materials is the destruction of the strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds in these biopolymers.1 Consequently, considerable efforts have been devoted to the disruption of the hydrogen bonds in the biopolymers for enhancing their processability.
Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been utilized widely as promising “green solvents” to replace volatile organic solvents for polysaccharide processing.5 Over the past few years, ILs have been used as excellent media for the dissolution, plasticization and derivatization of starch,6 facilitating the synthesis of chemically modified starches with high degree of substitution (DS),3 and the development of starch-based materials such as thermoplastic starch,7,8 composite films,9 solid polymer electrolytes,10,11 nanoparticles12 and drug carriers13–15 (Fig. 1).

In recent years, there have been several reviews documenting the advances in cellulose dissolution in ILs.16–18 To the best of our knowledge, there is only one review paper in 2011 summarizing the applications of ILs in starch.6 Considering the rapid development of ILs in starch applications especially the novel sustainable engineering techniques in the treatment of starch using ILs, it is worthwhile to provide a most updated survey of the recent advances in these important aspects. This review presents an overview of the roles of ILs in starch dissolution, gelatinization, modification, and plasticization, and wider applications of ILs in starch. Moreover, current discrepancies in the mechanisms regarding the starch–IL interactions are critically examined.
2 Ionic liquids and their related properties for biopolymer processing
Ionic liquids (ILs) refer to “liquid salts composed of ions with melting temperature below 100 °C”, and were first introduced in chemical engineering applications around the turn of the 20th to 21st century.19 Over the past decades, there has been an exponential increase in the number of publications describing the synthesis and applications of ILs and there is no doubt that ILs have become a major subject of study in modern chemistry.20 ILs have been found to efficiently dissolve cellulose without derivatization,21 leading to the expanded use of ILs in the processing of diverse biopolymers.3,5,6,17,22 The processing of different biopolymers (e.g., cellulose, starch, chitin, inulin, chitosan, lignin etc.) and the fabrication of the related biodegradable materials are largely determined by the physicochemical properties of ILs used.5 Some important properties of ILs that are closely linked to biopolymer processing are illustrated in Fig. 2 and discussed respectively in the following sections.
 Fig. 2  Physicochemical properties of ionic liquids that are related to biopolymer processing. 
2.1. Green solvents
Most importantly, ILs can be used as “green solvents” for clean and green technologies.20 ILs have appealing and unique physicochemical properties such as negligible vapor pressure,23,24 non-flammability, excellent thermal and chemical stabilities,25 notable recoverability and ionic conductivities,26 and efficient dissolution ability for biopolymers, which make them fascinating candidates for the replacement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for biopolymer processing.27
2.2. Designable solvents
ILs are composed of an organic cation and an inorganic or organic anion. The commonly used ILs have cations such as alkylimidazolium [R1R2im]+, alkylpyridinium [RPy]+, alkylpyrrolidinium [RPr]+, choline [Ch]+, tetraalkylammonium [NR4]+, tetraalkylphosphonium [PR4]+ cations and anions such as halide, carboxylate [RCOO]−, dicyanamide [Dca]−, thiocyanate [SCN]−, tetraflouroborate [BF4]−, hexaflourophosphate [PF6]−, and methanesulfonate [CH3SO3]− anions. The cations and anions of ILs considered in this review are listed in Table 1. The most interesting aspect of ILs in biopolymer processing is the possibility to ‘design’ or ‘tune’ a set of specific physical and chemical properties through the adjustment of the cation structure (e.g., the class of cations, and the length and symmetry of substituent groups), the selection of the structure and the extent of charge delocalization of the anion.28,29 The number of potential ion combinations available reputedly equates to a million ILs, whereas just about 600 molecular solvents are in use today.19 Considering that ILs are tunable solvents, they can be designed with an appropriate combination of cations and anions for particular biopolymers, which is not possible when conventional organic solvents are concerned. Among all ILs, those with the combination of imidazolium-based cations and halide-based or carboxylate-based anions have been most commonly used for starch dissolution, plasticization and modification.6

2.3. Melting temperature
The melting temperature of ILs depends significantly on the structures of cations and anions. The first reported IL (N-ethylpyridinum chloride) for cellulose dissolution in 1930 has limited practical use because of its relatively high melting point (120 °C).30 The melting temperature of ILs nowadays is below 100 °C due to the design of bulky, asymmetric cations and weakly coordinating anions that destabilize the crystal lattice.31,32 An increasing number of carbon atoms in the side chain of the cation results in an increase in the melting temperature of ILs.16 The alkenyl moiety instead of the saturated alkyl moiety in the side chain of the cation decreases the melting point of ILs due to the suppressed crystallization of the ILs.33 For example, the melting temperature of 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Amim][Cl]) is 17 °C, which is much lower than that of 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Pmim][Cl], 60 °C).34 The presence or absence of strong hydrogen bonds in ILs also influences the melting temperature. The C–H⋯X (X = Cl, Br) interaction is very strong in alkylimidazolium halide ILs and can even possess some covalent character,35 which make this type of IL present higher melt temperatures (typically ≥60 °C) compared to those of conventional solvents. However, the hydrogen bonding interaction in imidazolium acetate ILs is considerably weak, resulting in a low melting point of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]) (<−20 °C).17
2.4. Viscosity
The viscosity of ILs, similar to oils, is higher than that of most common molecular solvents.16 It depends on their inter-ionic interactions (e.g., Coulomb forces, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions) and thus varies considerably with temperature, the chemical structure of the IL, and the co-solvent(s).5 The viscosity of alkylimidazolium-based ILs decreases with an increase in temperature and increases with a longer alkyl chain of the cation.36 Similar to the melting temperature of ILs, the viscosity of ILs is also affected by the hydrogen bonding interaction in ILs.37,38 For example, the acetate-based ILs have remarkably lower viscosities than the corresponding chloride-based ILs.36 In general, the viscosity of ILs with the same cations follows the order [Cl]− > [BF4]− > [PF6]−.16 For biopolymer processing, viscosity plays a major role in the dissolution of biopolymers in ILs. The high viscosity of ILs is not favorable for the dissolution of biopolymers; thus a co-solvent with low viscosity is always used. Addition of a small amount of water or some other common solvent (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethylene glycol) reduces the viscosity to almost one-half that of the pure IL.36,39–41 The presence of co-solvents decreases the aggregation of the IL ions (Fig. 3),42–44 with the nature of the co-solvent playing a more important role than its content.45

2.5. Polarity
Many compounds that are insoluble or only partially soluble in other organic solvents can be efficiently dissolved in ILs having strong hydrogen-bond acceptors.41,46 Based on their solvation capabilities, ILs are classified generally as highly polar solvents. The Kamlet–Taft method28 and solvatochromic method17 have been applied to predict and correlate the solubility of biopolymers and biomolecules in ILs with their polarities.
2.6. Miscibility with other solvents
ILs are usually miscible with polar solvents such as ketones, alcohols and dichloromethane, but immiscible with non-polar organic solvents including ethers and alkanes.5 Based on the solubility of ILs in water, ILs can be classified to be either hydrophilic (water-miscible) or hydrophobic (forming a biphasic system with water). The miscibility of ILs with water depends mainly on the hydrophilic nature of the anion and the hydrophobic nature of the cation.47 The hydrophobicity of ILs increases with the increase in the alkyl chain length of cations.48 ILs with [PF6]− anions are water-immiscible, and ILs with [OAc]−, [NO3]− and halide anions are water-miscible.16 The hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of ILs determines their solvation properties, which in turn determines the recovery of the products by solvent extraction.49 Generally, biopolymers can dissolve in hydrophilic ILs but not in hydrophobic ILs.21
2.7. Toxicity
The toxic effects of ILs are very important for starch processing because starch-based products are widely used in the areas of food and biodegradable materials. The structural composition of the IL, including the cation, alkyl chain length and anion can affect the degree of toxicity (Fig. 4a).50–54 While many ILs are classified as “readily biodegradable”,53 some ILs are relatively stable in the environment due to their resistance to photodegradation55 and small degree of biodegradation.56 Structural modification-based approaches, which yield nontoxic and biodegradable ILs, can be followed to design “greener” ILs (Fig. 4b). In the future, the design and synthesis of environmentally benign ILs from the green chemistry point of view, and research on the development of techniques for the removal of ILs, should be focused on for the development of starch-based products with ILs.

3 Starch structure, functionality and industrial applications
Biomass such as plant fibers and biopolymers produced from natural resources or microorganisms has been explored for industrial applications.57–59 Among different biomass feedstocks, starch as a natural biopolymer has been used in various industries (Fig. 5) due to its renewability, biodegradability, abundance and low cost. Recently, the sustainable or ‘green’ engineering of starch has been receiving significant attention, and it requires the minimal use of hazardous substances and enables reduction of energy consumption.3
 Fig. 5  Summary of various industrial applications of starch. 
Native starch granules are formed in heterotrophic plastids by coordinated interactions of multiple biosynthetic enzymes and stored in storage organs as semi-crystalline granules with a complicated structure and unique properties for each plant.60 Native starch consists mainly of two polysaccharides: lightly branched amylose (AM) and highly branched amylopectin (AP). Amylose is essentially linear and contains approximately 99% α-(1,4) bonds and 1% α-(1,6) bonds, whereas amylopectin has 95% α-(1,4) bonds and 5% α-(1,6) bonds linking D-glucose.61–63 Starch is constructed mainly by alternating semi-crystalline and amorphous growth rings surrounding a central amorphous region, with a degree of crystallinity ranging from 20 to 45%.64 Starches are generally divided into three main polymorphs (A-, B-, and C-type crystallites), which have distinct functional properties.65–67 Native starch granules are characterized on structural scales ranging from nano- to micrometers, including granule, growth ring, blocklet, lamellar, and double-helical structures.63,68 The multiscale structure of the starch granule plays a key role in determining the functionality and suitability for different applications of starch (Fig. 6).

4 Dissolution of starch in IL solvent systems
Native starch is in the form of granules with a supramolecular semi-crystalline structure and inherent strong intra-/intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The dissolution of starch requires the disruption of these inherent strong hydrogen bonds. In many cases, water is often used to dissolve starch with the aid of heat. Under common heating conditions (below 100 °C), starch cannot be fully dissolved in water, leading to the formation of an undissolved ghost structure.69,70 Over the past fifty years, great efforts have been focused on other solvents that can completely dissolve starch, such as DMSO,71–75 strong inorganic alkali solutions (e.g., KOH and NaOH),76,77 NaOH/urea,78 zinc chloride aqueous solution (ZnCl2),79,80N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO),81,82 and molten imidazole.83,84 However, these solvents may also have their drawbacks including narrow reaction windows (e.g., limited applicable ranges of temperature or starch concentration), undesirable side reactions, the tendency to cause starch degradation, difficulty in solvent separation or recovery, health hazardousness, environmental unfriendliness, and high energy consumption.
Recent studies have shown that ILs could effectively dissolve polysaccharides including starch.6,25,30,85,86 Although some ILs are toxic, there are still many ILs that can be synthesized via chemistry and are considered as “green” solvents for biopolymers. For example, [Emim][OAc] has desirable properties, e.g., low toxicity (LD50 > 2000 mg kg−1), low corrosiveness, low melting point (<−20 °C), low viscosity (10 mPa s at 80 °C), and favorable biodegradability.17 In the following sections, we will discuss the research progress on the dissolution of starch in ILs and the related mechanisms.
4.1. Dissolution of starch in pure ILs
ILs that consist of an imidazolium (less often pyridinium, ammonium, or phosphonium) cation and a strongly basic, hydrogen bond accepting anion (e.g., carboxylates or halides) have the ability to fully or partially disrupt the intermolecular hydrogen bonds present in biopolymeric networks, and to dissolve biopolymers such as starch.6,25,30,85,87

Table 2 provides a summary of typical studies on starch dissolution using pure ILs. It should be noted that the concentrations of starch listed are not necessarily the maximum solubility. The solubility can be measured by adding the solute into the IL at intervals until the solution became unclear.88 Nevertheless, this process could be tedious.

As seen from Table 2, the dissolution of starch in pure ILs requires aggressive conditions (higher temperatures and/or microwave treatment), which always lead to the molecular degradation of starch.89,90,93 Stevenson et al.89 studied the structural changes of starch in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]), which showed that heat-dispersion of starch in this IL degrades amylopectin to lower-molecular-mass molecules, and that maize, rice and wheat starches degraded more considerably than potato starch. Similar results were also observed in another study,90 where both amylopectin and amylose degrade during heating in [Bmim][Cl]. It is proposed that the hygroscopic nature of [Bmim][Cl] may result in the formation of HCl, which catalyzes the depolymerization of starch.90 Lappalainen et al.93 studied the dissolution and depolymerization of barley starch in various ILs using benzene sulfonic acid (p-TsOH) as a catalyst under controlled microwave heating. The results showed that starch in dialkylimidazolium halide ILs is depolymerized substantially to produce 79–100% water-soluble starch oligomers with an average molecular weight of 1000–2000 Da.93 In contrast, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([Emim][Me2PO4]) and 2-hydroxyethylammonium formate ([NH3CH2CH2OH][HCOO]) caused the lowest degree of depolymerization of starch among the tested ILs.93
The efficiency of starch dissolution was found to be highly dependent on the cation and anion of the IL used.93 The larger cation in 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Hexmim][Cl]) compared to the cation in [Amim][Cl] or [Bmim][Cl] led to a slightly longer time for starch dissolution.93 The more nucleophilic anion in [Bmim][Br] and [Hexmim][Br] compared to that in [Bmim][Cl] and [Hexmim][Cl], respectively, resulted in faster dissolution. ILs with [HCOO]− or [Me2PO4]− as an anion dissolved starch more slowly than ILs with a halide anion. These results correspond well to a previous finding by Papanyan et al.95 that there is a linear relationship between the −OH stretch frequencies measured by infrared spectroscopy and the solubility of the salt solutions. In other words, the redshift of the vibrational bands of the polymer in the −OH stretch region can be correlated with the higher solubility of the polymer. They suggested that the solubility capacities of the anions in the salt solutions follow the well-known Hofmeister series, which accounts for the disruption power of the anions and the specific size ratio of the anion/cation combinations.95
There are few studies dealing with the dissolution mechanism of starch in ILs. Nevertheless, the mechanism for cellulose dissolution in ILs has been widely reported.17,96–98 It has been suggested that basic IL anions (chloride,96,99,100 hydroxide,101 and formate102 anions), acting as proton acceptors, would efficiently promote cellulose dissolution by forming hydrogen bonds with cellulose hydroxyl groups (Fig. 7). Both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides consisting of D-glucose units, referred to as homoglucan or glucopyranose. The main difference between the two biopolymers is that the units of starch are mostly linked by α-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, while those of cellulose are connected by β-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds. Therefore, the dissolution of starch in ILs should also be considered to be due to the basicity of IL anions. When starch granules are dispersed in [Emim][OAc], the IL is able to disrupt the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between the hydroxyl groups of the starch biopolymer.103

4.2 Dissolution of starch in aqueous ILs
In an early study by Zdanowicz and Spychaj,91 heating starch with a low water content (5 wt%) in [Amim][Cl] at 80 °C for 60 min could result in the formation of a clear and amber gel, whereas heating starch with a high water content (14 wt%) could generate a clear and amber liquid.91 Liu and Budtova104 studied the dissolution of starch in [Emim][OAc]/water mixtures, and showed that the extent of starch dissolution in pure [Emim][OAc] increases with an increase in temperature, and the presence of water promotes the dissolution of starch in the IL. Compared with pure ILs, aqueous ILs have many advantages such as low viscosity, low dissolution temperature, low energy consumption, simple processing of starch and ILs (the drying process of ILs is no longer needed before dissolution) and low cost. These features make the aqueous IL solvents promising candidates in the dissolution and pre-treatment of starch.
Xie and coworkers103 have, for the first time, revealed that starch dissolves most effectively during heating when the [Emim][OAc]/water ratio is 1:7.2 (mol mol−1).103 Their further research has indicated that the dissolution of starch in this aqueous IL occurs under ambient conditions within 40 min.105 Soluble starch molecules in aqueous ILs could form a boundary film on hydrophobic surfaces, which makes them suitable for lubrication applications.106 The mechanism regarding the efficient reaction of this aqueous IL has not been fully elaborated. Conceivably, there are complex interactions among the IL, water and starch, which may influence the bulkiness of water and the viscosity of the solution as well.103,104 Kim et al.107 have interrogated the role of hydrogen bonding in water-mediated glucose solubility in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([Emim][TfO]), which may provide us with a basis for further investigating how the starch–water–IL ternary system works. Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, they reached the following conclusions:107
(a) The interaction among glucose molecules tends to be stronger, involving more hydrogen bonding in the pure IL than in the water-mediated IL.
(b) Water acts as a solubility enhancer, which disrupts glucose–glucose interactions and enhances glucose–solvent (water and [TfO]−) interactions, resulting in higher glucose solubility.
(c) Water molecules initially located around glucose molecules are later taken up by [TfO]−, leaving glucose molecules surrounded mainly by [TfO]− at equilibrium. Thus, the solubility of glucose in a water-mediated IL system may be controlled by the strength of water–anion interactions.
(d) In a water-mediated IL, all the components have higher diffusivity, which could lead to a higher reaction rate.
The dissolution efficiency of aqueous ILs is still linked to the cation and anion of the IL as already discussed for the case of pure ILs. Sciarini et al.108 found that [Emim][OAc] and cholinium acetate ([Ch][OAc]) have their respective amounts of water (3:7 water/[Emim][OAc] and 2:8 water/[Ch][OAc], wt/wt) to allow most efficient destruction of starch granules. At these concentrations, destruction (depolymerization and dissolution) starts at temperatures as low as 36 °C and 68 °C, respectively.108 This suggests that specific starch chain breaking reactions occur depending on the cation present in the IL, which can be linked to the theory of Papanyan et al.95
Recently, a mixture of [Emim][OAc]:water (molar ratio: 0.15:1) has been reported to dissolve normal maize starch at 28 °C,105 although in another study, waxy maize starch was not dissolved completely in aqueous [Amim][Cl] at 25 °C.109 We must highlight that the mechanism of starch dissolution in aqueous ILs under ambient conditions is different from the mechanism during heating because the interaction between starch and water is negligible at ambient temperature. The dissolution behavior of maize starch in mixtures of water and alkylmethylimidazolium chloride at ambient temperature (22–23 °C) was studied by Ren et al.110 At water:IL ratios of 10:1 and 5:1 (mol mol−1), the extent of disruption of the starch structure followed the order: [Bmim][Cl] > [Pmim][Cl] > [Emim][Cl]. At a lower water:IL ratio (2:1, mol mol−1), the complete disruption of the starch granule morphology and ordered structures in aqueous [Pmim][Cl] and aqueous [Emim][Cl] mixtures indicates that these mixtures are more effective at dissolving starch than the aqueous [Bmim][Cl] mixture. They have concluded that both the alkyl chain lengths of cations and water:IL ratios play key roles in the dissolution of starch, predominantly by affecting the interaction between ILs and water and the viscosity of aqueous ILs.110 Their further research111 has indicated that at high water/IL molar ratios, the hydrogen bonding capacity of the IL anions plays a major role in starch dissolution, whereas the viscosity of the water/IL mixtures dominates starch dissolution at low water/IL ratios. Although maize starch was dissolved in an aqueous [Emim][OAc] solution of IL:water (6:4, wt/wt) at ambient temperature, potato starch was not dissolved completely, which were attributed to structural differences of the granule surfaces.67
While the maximum solubility of starch in ILs has been found when there is a certain content of water mixed with the IL, this is not the case for cellulose, another polysaccharide with the same glucose repeat structure but different glycosidic bonds. For cellulose, the dissolution efficiency of ILs significantly decreases with an increase in the water content in the system,88 which makes the dissolution mechanism of polysaccharides by aqueous ILs more difficult to understand. Nonetheless, Taheri et al.112 reported that in the dissolution of cellulose, chitosan, and chitin using an acidic IL 1-(carboxymethyl)pyridinium chloride ([CMPy][Cl]), a 6/4 (wt/wt) [CMPy]Cl/water mixture outperformed others. Xu et al.113 found that lignin was efficiently dissolved by aqueous choline carboxylate solutions at 25 °C. Therefore, more research is required to understand the interactions among the IL, water and polysaccharides.
4.3 Dissolution of starch in mixtures of ILs and other solvents
Research has shown that the addition of DMSO into ILs such as [Bmim][Cl] could facilitate the dissolution and breakage of the original structure of starch.92 Similarly, [Bmim][OAc]/DMSO,114–116 [Bmim][OAc]/DMF117 and [Emim][OAc]/DMF118,119 have been found to be better solvents for cellulose with the absence of significant aggregation of dissolved chains. According to Radhi et al.,40 DMSO, at a low mole fraction (<0.4), can weakly associate with the cation and in doing so it disrupts the strong ion–ion association that exists in the pure IL. As a result, the anomalous diffusion (bulky cations moving faster than anions in pure [Emim][OAc]) is reduced with the addition of DMSO, and above a 0.6 mole fraction of DMSO, the anion diffuses in a “normal” way, that is, faster than the cation.40 This could explain why DMSO can assist in the dissolution of either starch or cellulose in ILs (Fig. 8).

Shen et al.94 found that the presence of an appropriate amount of water can accelerate the dissolution, while with methanol it is just the opposite. Their results showed that methanol can promote the dissolution of starch in an 8:2:3 (wt/wt/wt) mixture of [Mmim][(MeO)HPO2]/water/methanol as methanol can penetrate into the starch granules and swell the outer layer of the granules.94 They demonstrated that this ternary mixture is as good as a 7:3 (wt/wt) [Mmim][(MeO)HPO2]/water mixture to dissolve maize starch at lower temperature.94
Some deep eutectic solvents (DESs) that include IL components have been found to be excellent solvents for polysaccharides such as starch as well.84,120–123 For example, a 20 wt% potato starch (30% amylose content) solution can be prepared in a 3:7 (wt/wt) choline chloride ([Ch][Cl])/imidazole mixture after heating to 100 °C for 1 h.84 Dai et al.122 found that many plant-abundant primary metabolites changed their state from solid to liquid when they were mixed in appropriate ratios, which has led to their discovery of many natural deep eutectic solvents (NDESs) from nature such as mixtures of [Ch][Cl] with lactic acid, maleic acid, citric acid, aconitic acid, glycol, glycerol, xylitol, sorbose, sucrose, or maltose. These NDESs showed clear hydrogen bonding and high viscosity. Their viscosity decreased significantly with the addition of small amounts of water but their characteristics were preserved. The NDESs, due to their supramolecular structure and broad polarity range, proved to be excellent solvents for a wide range of metabolites of low to medium polarity that is non-soluble or poorly soluble in water, such as DNA, proteins and polysaccharides (including starch).122 Ramesh et al.124,125 showed that a DES of 1:2 (wt/wt) [Ch][Cl]/urea could effectively suppress the crystallinity of maize starch. It has been shown that the addition of urea to [Emim][OAc] could facilitate the dissolution of cellulose (with less time).126 So far, studies on the effects of IL mixtures with other co-solvents on starch are still quite limited and more research requires to be undertaken in this area.
5 Phase transition of starch in mixtures of ILs and water
Starch often undergoes gelatinization in the presence of water upon heating. Although the starch structure is disrupted during gelatinization, the granule remnants may still be present.70 The incomplete disruption of starch represents an issue when trying to obtain homogeneous amorphous materials. Recently, mixtures of ILs and water have been used as effective solvents for starch dissolution and plasticization,6 facilitating the development of biopolymer-based materials. For developing promising biodegradable starch-based materials, it is crucial to understand the phase transition mechanism of starch in water and IL mixtures.
5.1 Phase transition process of starch in water/IL mixtures
The phase transition process of starch in mixtures of water and ILs is commonly studied using DSC. The most frequently used transition parameters are: the onset temperature (To, the intersection point of tangents to the thermogram before maximum heat flow), the peak temperature (Tp, the temperature of maximum heat flow), the conclusion temperature (Tc, the intersection point of tangents to the trace at the upslope after Tp and an estimate of the baseline); and the heat input enthalpy change (ΔH, the area under the line drawn from the start temperature to the end temperature).69

Fig. 9 shows the DSC thermograms of native waxy maize starch in water:[Amim][Cl] mixtures.127 During DSC heating, a single well-defined gelatinization endotherm was observed for the native starch in pure water. With a decrease in the water/IL ratio, the phase transition changed from only a single endothermic event to endothermic plus exothermic transitions, and then to only a single exothermic event. Specifically, as the water/IL ratio was decreased to 10:1 (mol mol−1), the single endothermic transition shifted to a higher temperature. Further decreases in the water/IL ratio resulted in a shift of the gelatinization endotherm to lower temperatures, which was still higher than that of the starch–water mixture. At a water/IL ratio of 3:1 (mol mol−1), a small exothermic transition was followed by an obvious endothermic transition. When the water/IL ratios were further decreased, there was only a well-defined exothermic transition. Interestingly, an exothermic transition of starch in water/IL mixtures of 2:1 and 1.5:1 (mol mol−1) occurred at a lower temperature than in pure water and pure ILs, indicating water favoring starch disruption in aqueous ILs with low cost and energy consumption. Over the past few years, these similar results concerning the starch phase transition in other aqueous ILs ([Emim][OAc],103,108,128 [Amim][Cl],129 and [Ch][OAc]108), aqueous NMMO,81 and aqueous DMSO130 have been reported.

Undoubtedly, the endothermic transition process of starch can be ascribed to starch gelatinization at high water/IL ratios. However, there has been no consensus over whether the exothermic transition of starch in water/IL mixtures at a low water/IL ratio is dissolution or gelatinization. Most researchers have suggested that the exothermic transition is due to starch dissolution considering the only exothermic transition of starch in pure ILs,103,129 during which significant starch depolymerization occurs.108,130 However, there has been a different opinion suggesting that the exothermic transition should still be associated with the starch gelatinization process,127 which is based on the definition of starch gelatinization (viz. “disruption of molecular orders within the starch granule manifested in irreversible changes in properties such as crystallite melting, unwinding of double helices, loss of birefringence, and starch solubilization”).69 Hence, the definition of the phase transition of starch in aqueous ILs needs to be further clarified.
5.2 Structural changes of starch during phase transitions in water/IL mixtures
The structure of starch determines its functional properties, and the structural changes of starch during heating provided a better understanding of the phase transition mechanism of starch in water/IL mixtures. Hence, the structural changes of starch in water/IL mixtures during phase transitions have gained wide attention.
Microscopy is a simple yet reliable method to study the morphology (under normal light) and crystalline structure (under polarized light) of starch. Many researchers103,104,108,129 have reported a similar observation of morphological changes of starch in water/IL mixtures during heating using normal and polarized light microscopy. Before heating, the normal starch showed a well-defined granule structure and clear birefringent “Maltese cross” patterns. Then, whether being heated in pure water or water/IL mixtures at a high water/IL ratio, most of the granules were tremendously swollen and deformed with less remaining birefringence at Tp; and finally, the swollen granules showed no birefringence at Tc. It is noteworthy that at the Tp of the exotherm in the water:IL mixture at a low water/IL ratio, most granules were still intact and showed birefringence, although no granule remnants and birefringence were observed at Tc.
Zhang et al.128 studied the changes of crystalline and lamellar structures in maize starch heated in [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures using synchrotron X-ray scattering analysis in situ. Firstly, a preferable increase in the thickness of the crystalline lamellae rather than that of the amorphous lamellae causes an overall increase in the thickness of the semi-crystalline lamellae; then, the amorphous lamellae start to decrease probably due to the diffusion of starch molecules from them; this forms a fractal gel on a larger scale (than the lamellae) which gradually decreases to a stable value as the temperature increases further (Fig. 10). This hints at a future study and using certain aqueous ILs for disrupting the starch semi-crystalline structure is the key to realize green processes to obtain homogeneous amorphous materials.

(b) Changes of the semi-crystalline lamellar structure of starch in water–[Emim][OAc] mixtures. Adapted from ref. 128 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry (2015). 
Xiang et al.127 studied the multi-scale structural changes of waxy maize starch heated in water/[Amim][Cl] mixtures. They found that, whether being heated in pure water or water:IL mixtures, no obvious structural disruption of ordered structures in starch was evident at the To of the phase transition, whereas at the Tc of the thermal transitions, the starch samples were completely disrupted. In particular, no apparent crystalline structural changes of starch occurred when heated to the peak temperature of the exothermic peak before the endothermic peak at water/IL ratios of 3:1 and 2:1 (mol mol−1). Hence, they proposed that the exothermic transition followed by the gelatinization endotherm observed at water/IL ratios of 3:1 and 2:1 (mol mol−1) could be attributed to the interaction of ILs and amorphous regions in starch.
The depolymerization of starch molecules in ILs was elucidated by characterizing the molecular mass distribution changes of starch using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC)89,93 and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).90 Sciarini et al.108 found that the addition of rather small quantities of water (20%) could significantly reduce the depolymerization of starch caused by [Emim][OAc] and [Ch][OAc] during heating. While its depolymerization should be avoided, the water/IL mixtures can be considered as suitable solvents for starch modifications. Additionally, although these ILs did not completely avoid starch depolymerization, the reduction in the molecular mass was 1–3 orders of magnitude lower than those resulting from the use of halide-based imidazolium ILs.108
5.3 Phase transition mechanism of starch in water/IL mixtures
Over the past few years, the nature of the phase transitions of starch in water/IL mixtures has been the subject of extensive research, leading to several assumptions.
The phase transitions of starch in water and IL mixtures are mainly determined by the water/IL ratio, which has been proposed by many researchers.103,104,108,128–130 At a high water/IL ratio, the interaction between starch and water dominates, resulting in an endothermic transition of starch; at a low water/IL ratio, the interaction between starch and the IL prevails, leading to an exothermic transition of starch. This agrees with the study by Xie and coworkers,128 which has shown that when the water content is high, there is sufficient water to both solvate starch and interact with ILs; consequently, the IL has little chance to interact with the starch molecules. In contrast, when the amount of water is low, the IL–water interaction decreases and the IL is still able to interact with starch.
Researchers103,104,108,127–130 have assumed that the phase transition behavior of starch in water/IL mixtures is affected by the viscosity of the water/IL mixtures and the interactions between ILs and water. At a high water/IL ratio, with an increase in the IL content, the endotherm of starch shifted to higher temperature. The hydrogen-bonding interaction between water and the IL (the kosmotropic effect) could reduce the availability of water, leading to the delay of starch gelatinization.108,128 At a low water/IL ratio, the exotherm of starch appeared at a lower temperature than the phase transition temperature of the starch–water system or the starch–IL system.103,108,127 For this observation, two reasons have been proposed:104 (a) Water, being much less bulky than [Emim][OAc], penetrates the granule first, swells the outer layer and facilitates IL penetration and starch disruption; and (b) the viscosity of 75% [Emim][OAc]–25% water is much lower than that of pure [Emim][OAc], leading to a higher polymer diffusion coefficient, more rapid homogenization of the whole system, and thus a more expeditious phase transition. This finding could lead to the fabrication of starch materials with low energy consumption. For example, Zhang et al.11 prepared starch-based electro-conductive films with [Emim][OAc] and water mixtures at 55 °C and 65 °C, much lower than those commonly used in biopolymer melt processing (typically over 150 °C).
Recently, Xiang et al.127 systematically elucidated the mechanisms underlying the endotherm and exotherm of starch in water/[Amim][Cl] mixtures. In pure water, starch interacts with free water during DSC heating, leading to the disruption of hydrogen bonding between starch molecules. When a small amount of the IL is introduced (water/IL ratios of 80:1 to 10:1, mol mol−1), a small proportion of water molecules interact with the IL to form an HOH⋯IL⋯HOH network,44 resulting in reduced water availability for starch gelatinization, higher transition temperatures, and a greater enthalpy change. With decreasing amounts of water (water/IL ratios from 5:1 to 2:1, mol mol−1), the IL interacts strongly with not only water molecules but also starch molecules during DSC heating, weakening the hydrogen bonding between starch molecules, leading to lower gelatinization temperatures and a reduced enthalpy change. At a low water content, the IL interacts with water to form IL⋯HOH⋯IL,44 which makes more IL ions interact with starch molecules, leading to a heat release during the starch phase transition (an exothermic event). In the presence of the pure IL, starch molecules can interact strongly with the IL and release a greater amount of heat, leading to the formation of new hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of starch and the IL ions. Due to viscosity effects, the diffusion of the IL into starch granules is increasingly retarded with the decrease in the water/IL ratios, thus leading to increased gelatinization temperatures and a greater enthalpy change. So far, studies on the phase transition of starch in water/IL mixtures, especially the role of the structures of IL cations and anions, are still quite limited. Furthermore, the mechanisms of interactions among starch, water and ILs during the phase transition are mainly based on assumptions. Hence, more research requires to be undertaken in this area.
6 Chemical modification of starch in ILs
Native starch is limited for industrial applications due to several drawbacks such as insolubility in cold water and tendency towards retrogradation and syneresis.131 Therefore, it is necessary to improve the physicochemical and functional properties of starch for enhanced and broadened applications. Among the most widespread starch derivatives, esterified and etherified starches have attracted the most attention. These two modified starches are generally synthesized by traditional technologies using conventional solvents such as the aqueous phase,132,133 pyridine,134–136 DMSO,137 and DMAc/LiCl.138 Over the past few years, ILs have been considered as possible green substitutes for these toxic organic solvents and reaction media for the etherification and esterification of carbohydrates including starch.5,54 Some recent advances in etherification and esterification of starch in ILs over the past decade are listed in Table 3.

There have been limited reports on starch etherification in ILs. Xie et al.139,140 synthesized a maize starch ether with a high DS of 0.021–0.99 by reacting maize starch with different reactants in a homogeneous manner using [Bmim][Cl] as reaction medium. Similarly, Bakouri et al.141 reported a homogeneously modified maize starch synthesized with sodium monochloroacetic acid in [Bmim][Cl]. A high degree of etherification (DS of 0.79) could be achieved within a short time in [Bmim][Cl], which is conceivably due to the excellent dissolving capacity and catalytic effect of the IL.141
In contrast, the esterification of starch in ILs has been more widely studied. Several kinds of starch esters, such as starch laurate,92,142,143 starch palmitate,92,144 starch stearate,92,143 starch succinate,145 starch acetate,142,145–148 and starch vernolate,149,150 have been chemically synthesized using pure ILs or IL/other solvent mixtures as reaction media. Examples of IL solvents studied in this regard include [Bmim][Cl],140,141,143,145,148,150,151 [Emim][OAc],144,147 [Bmim][Dca],147 [Bmim][BF4]144,152 and [Bmim][PF6].149 Among them, [Bmim][Cl] is the most widely used IL for the esterification of native starch.
In these studies, the reaction medium was a mixture of ILs/DMSO or IL/IL in addition to pure ILs. Gao et al.92 described homogeneous esterification of maize starch with different chain length fatty acids (lauric acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid) using [Bmim][Cl], [Emim][OAc] and a [Bmim][Cl]/DMSO mixture, respectively, without catalysts. The DS of starch laureate was the highest and reached 0.10 when the mixture of [Bmim][Cl]/DMSO was the reaction medium, which was more efficient than pure ILs.92 Lu et al.144 reported the lipase-catalyzed synthesis of starch palmitate in IL mixtures consisting of [Bmim][OAc] and [Bmim][BF4]. The maximum DS of 0.144 was obtained for a [Bmim][BF4]/[Bmim][OAc] mass ratio of 19:5 at 60 °C during 3 h with a reactant/AGU ratio of 3:1.144
Starch esterification was also conducted in ILs using biocatalysts. Lu et al.144 showed that a slightly higher DS of 0.153 could be reached by increasing the lipase (Candida rugosa lipase) dosage from 0.1 g to 0.2 g. However, an excess amount of the enzyme was suggested to have no apparent influence on the reaction.144 Their further work concerned the same enzymatic synthesis of starch laurates in [Bmim][BF4] and [Bmim][Cl] starting from high-amylose maize starch and lauric acid.152 In this work, they used a two-step method involving, first, the pre-gelatinization of the starch in [Bmim][Cl] in order to destroy its granule structure and, then, the addition of the dried pregelatinized starch to [Bmim][BF4] for lipase esterification.152 These conditions led to a maximum DS of 0.171.152 Recently, Li et al.153 and Desalegn et al.149 have used the same enzyme (Novozyme 435 lipase) to catalyze the synthesis of starch esters. Li et al.153 reported the biosynthesis of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starch (DS of 0.0006–0.013) using 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([Omim][NO3]) as the reaction medium. Desalegn et al.149 synthesized epoxy fatty acid esters (DS of 0.95) of cassava starch by reacting the starch with vernonia acid methyl ester using [Bmim][PF6] as reaction medium and DMSO as a co-solvent. Zarski et al.151 conducted the esterification of potato starch with oleic acid in [Bmim][Cl] using immobilized lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus as the catalyst. The product with the highest DS (0.22) was obtained at 60 °C in 4 h, but a higher temperature or a longer reaction time led to a decrease in the DS due to the formation of water as a by-product that could favor hydrolytic reactions.151 These previous studies have shown that ILs can be used as convenient, homogeneous reaction media and/or catalysts for the esterification or etherification of starch with defined substitution patterns, expanding their applications (Fig. 11). In comparison with native starch, etherified starch shows desirable physico-chemical properties such as thermal stability, ion activity, higher reaction efficiency, and thixotropy. Starch ethers can be applied in many areas such as coating, flocculants, drug delivery and food additives.154 Starch esters possess higher viscosity, glueyness and transparency; so they can be used as adhesives, thickeners, stabilizers or drug bulking agents. Moreover, amphiphilic polymer esters have a wide range of industrial applications, particularly for emulsification, encapsulation, films and coatings, and gel production.131,155,156 While IL residues in the regenerated starch after treatment with ILs are not detectable,105 they may still pose potential biological toxicity risk. Thus, more research is in demand to detect IL residues and to develop methods for the removal of ILs.

7 Plasticization of starch in ILs
Starch can be considered as a crystalline material. It can be thermomechanically processed by industrial techniques such as extrusion or injection molding.157 Water is the most basic processing aid for starch. When mixed with a limited amount of water and subjected to heat and shear treatments, starch undergoes spontaneous destructuration, leading to a homogeneous material known as thermoplastic starch (TPS).158 Unfortunately, water is highly volatile and easy to lose during processing. Since the 1990s, polyols (in particular, glycerol) have emerged as the most widely used compounds for starch plasticization. However, compared with water, polyols are less capable of inducing the phase transition of starch during processing.159 Moreover, small molecules such as glycerol are likely to diffuse out of polymer materials after some time, causing changes in the materials properties. Recently, ILs (especially imidazolium-based ILs) have been studied as new plasticizers for starch, and are summarized in Table 4.

Sankri et al.8 reported that during starch extrusion, [Bmim][Cl] resulted in a greater decrease in molecular mass and a smaller average molecular mass than did glycerol, although [Bmim][Cl]-plasticized starch showed lower hydrophilicity. Ning et al.10 observed that the anion (Cl−) can interact locally with the hydrogen atom of the starch hydroxyl group, while the cation ([Amim]+) interacts weakly with the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group. In this case, the two hydroxyl groups are still capable of forming hydrogen bonds with other hydroxyl groups of starch or water molecules. Therefore, the plasticized starch prepared with [Amim][Cl] is more hydrophilic than the glycerin plasticized starch.10 However, this difference was not observed for the starch plasticized with [Bmim][Cl].8
Unlike traditional solvents, ILs can provide a plasticization effect to a variety of biopolymers and can be used as important media for plasticizing composite materials.160,161 Wu et al.162 prepared a series of bio-based composite films based on cellulose, starch and lignin using [Amim][Cl] by coagulating under non-solvent conditions. They found that the composite films have excellent thermal stability and high gas barrier capacity, and the CO2:O2 permeability was close to 1.162 Among these composites, starch was found to contribute to film flexibility.162 Leroy et al.163 reported that the use of [Bmim][Cl] improved the plasticization efficiency of starch and zein and the compatibility of the blend compared to the use of glycerol. Kadokawa et al.9 prepared a homogeneous mixture of cellulose 10% and starch 5% (mass fraction) in [Bmim][Cl] over several days at room temperature. They demonstrated that this mixture could then be used to fabricate a composite gel, or a composite fiber through regeneration (100–200 μm in diameter) (Fig. 12).

Xie et al.164 compared [Emim][OAc] and glycerol for the preparation of starch-based films. They found that [Emim][OAc] is more conducive to the plasticization of starch and can inhibit the destruction of starch-based materials by bacteria.164 They also found that the amylose content was not a significant factor determining the properties of materials when starch was plasticized by [Emim][OAc], which was opposite to the cases with the use of other plasticizers.165 Liu et al.166 obtained a polybutylene succinate (PBS)/starch blend using [Bmim][Cl] as a plasticizer, as compared to that plasticized by glycerol. They found that ILs had a stronger plasticizing effect on starch than glycerol, which allowed starch to be more finely dispersed in the PBS matrix, improving the mechanical properties of the blend.166 Ismail et al.167 found that 1:4 (wt/wt) [Emim][OAc]/water at a total content of 70% as a plasticizer could destroy the A-type crystal structure, resulting in a VH-type crystalline structure and improving the mobility of amorphous starch. In addition, this [Emim][OAc]/water mixture could also transform starch into TPS under mild conditions (90 °C).168 Zhang et al.170 reported that starch-based films plasticized by [Emim][OAc] had better uniformity than those plasticized by glycerol. When [Emim][OAc] was used as a plasticizer, the interactions between starch chains were much weaker and the starch–[Emim][OAc] interactions became stronger, resulting in decreased strength and stiffness but increased flexibility of the films.170 Moreover, [Emim][OAc] has been shown to effectively retard the retrogradation of starch-based films.170
Additionally, ILs can act simultaneously as a plasticizer and conductive agent.10,160,161,169,171 Recently, Zhang et al.11 found that starch could be straightforwardly processed into optically transparent electro-conductive films by compression molding in aqueous [Emim][OAc] at a relatively mild temperature (55 or 65 °C), much lower than those commonly used in biopolymer melt processing (typically over 150 °C) (Fig. 13). This finding could guide the evolution of materials processing techniques for reducing energy consumption and enhancing processing versatility to incorporate heat-sensitive ingredients. Although ILs have many advantages and characteristics as plasticizers, they still have potential risks of biological toxicity. Therefore, for practical applications, more attention should be paid to the development of nontoxic or biodegradable ILs in starch plasticization.

8 Preparation of starch nanoparticles in ILs
Compared with starch nanocrystals which refer to the crystalline part of starch obtained by hydrolysis, nanoparticles prepared by crosslinking may be amorphous.172 Several methods of preparation of starch nanoparticles have been investigated, such as precipitation, spray drying, solvent evaporation and emulsion-cross-linking.173 Most of these techniques have disadvantages such as the difficulty in particle size control, the generation of chemical waste, and the requirement of a long production time.174 In comparison, the water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion-crosslinking technique is more advantageous and has been more extensively used for the preparation of starch-based nanometer materials.175
Concerning the emulsion-cross-linking technique, ILs can be used to substitute for the water phase or oil phase, or even as surfactants to prepare starch nanoparticles (Table 5 and Fig. 14). ILs, due to their dissolution effect for starch, are capable of creating a favorable environment for the formation of starch nanoparticles. However, the preparation of starch nanoparticles using IL microemulsion systems has been rarely studied so far. Long-chained ILs [Cnmim][X] can be used to substitute for surfactants to stabilize W/O microemulsions, whose mean diameter is 94.3 nm.14 According to Davis et al.,176 ILs could act as surfactants to facilitate the emulsification of fluoroalkanes with phases. A similar approach was performed by Wang et al.,177 who used [C16mim][Br] and [Omim][OAc] as both the surfactant and polar phase. The generated starch nanoparticles were even smaller (80.5 nm), perhaps because ILs as surfactants could help stabilize the suspended phase. In another study,15 [C3OHmim][OAc] was tailor-made as the polar phase with superior solubility, and could be used to prepare spherical OSA starch-based nanoparticles. Starch nanoparticles can be used as a carrier of genes/drugs.178 Hence, the residual ILs in medicines or materials should be considered and minimised for application safety purposes.

The depolymerization of starch into reducing sugars is mainly performed under high temperature or concentrated strong acidic conditions for a long time. Starch depolymerized into water-soluble products during the dissolution of starch in ILs has been widely reported.89,90,93,108 For example, Lappalainen et al.93 found that dialkylimidazolium halide ILs dissolve barley starch effectively (microwave heating, 80 °C) and depolymerized it substantially producing 79–100% water-soluble starch oligomers with an average molecular weight of 1000–2000 Da. They also prepared water-soluble starch oligomers of 1500–2000 Da (yield varied from 60 to 99%) by depolymerization of starch in [Amim][Cl] using an oil bath (50 °C) or microwave heating (60 °C).179 The starch oligomers produced could be used in bacterial cultivation as a glucose source.179 Hernoux-Villière et al.180 tested the conversion process of potato peels and starch into reducing sugars in two ILs ([Amim][Cl] and 1-(4-sulfobutyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride [SBmim][Cl]) (Fig. 15). Although [Amim][Cl] is more suitable for dissolving potato, [SBmim][Cl] could dissolve and depolymerize the materials into sugars in aqueous Brønsted-acidic medium just in one step.180 Using potato starch and potato peels (20 wt%) as raw materials to be depolymerized in aqueous ILs over 2 h, a solution containing up to 43% and 98% reducing sugars respectively at low temperature (60 °C) could be obtained.180

Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has been called a “sleeping giant” because of its high potential versatility in the chemical industry.181 While the conversion of many carbohydrates and raw plant biomass to HMF in ILs has been studied extensively,182–187 few studies focus on the conversion of starch to HMF in IL media. Hu et al.188 obtained an impressive HMF yield of 47% from starch using SnCl4/[Emim][BF4]. Stahlberg et al.189 found that starch could be converted to HMF (yield of 33%) in [Emim][Cl] without a metal catalyst. Chun et al.190 found a simple, direct and cost-effective conversion method of starch into HMF using 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Omim][Cl]), and a CrCl2 catalyst. The highest yields of HMF (73.0 wt%) were obtained in tapioca starch dissolved in 0.5 M HCl.190 Then, they reported a sustainable production method of HMF from starch-rich raw acorn biomass using [Omim][Cl].191 The highest HMF yield (58.7 wt%) was achieved in a reaction mixture of 40% [Omim][Cl] + 10% ethyl acetate + 50% 0.3M HCl extract containing a CrBr3/CrF3 mixture.191 The addition of a combination of two halide catalysts was more effective at the synthesis of HMF (1.2-fold higher on average) than their single addition.191 Roy et al.192 reported that a maximum of 64 wt% HMF was obtained from waxy corn substrates in the presence of AlCl3·6H2O in water–[Bmim]Cl/MIBK biphasic medium, and high HMF yields were obtained from amylopectin-rich starches.
ILs are electrically conductive and can act as a vehicle for electrically conductive starch-based materials. ILs could contribute to starch-based electrolytes with a reduced glass transition temperature (Tg), wider potential stability and improved electrochemical performance.193,194 Upon addition of 50 wt% [Bmim][PF6], the biopolymer electrolytes achieved the highest ionic conductivity of (1.99 ± 0.02) × 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C.194 Wang et al.10 reported that the conductance of a TPS film with a 30 wt% [Amim][Cl] content could reach 10−1.6 S cm−1 at a 14.5 wt% water content. Their further research160 showed that a higher conductivity value (10−0.3 S cm−1) was obtained by adding sodium montmorillonite (9%, wet weight) to starch plasticized with [Amim][Cl]. Zhang et al.11 prepared [C2mim][OAc]-plasticized electroconductive starch films (highest electrical conductivity was 1.18 × 10−2 S cm−1) at mild temperatures (55 and 65 °C). A lower processing temperature could lead to higher electrical conductivity, whereas an increase in either the relative humidity (RH) or [C2mim][OAc] content could increase the electrical conductivity.11 Khanmirzae and Ramesh171 prepared a nanocomposite polymer electrolyte (NCPE) from rice starch, lithium iodide (LiI), 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide ([Pmim][I]) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) using a solution cast technique. The ionic conductivity of NCPE (3.63 × 10−4 S cm−1) was enhanced compared with that of the polymer electrolyte without the IL and TiO2, favoring the development of solar cells.171 Then, they prepared a novel polymer electrolyte of higher ionic conductivity (1.20 × 10−3 S cm−1) by changing LiI to NaI.195 The fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells using this electrolyte showed the highest energy conversion efficiency of 2.09%.195 Recently, Lobregas and Camacho196 fabricated a dye-sensitized solar cell with a starch-based gel polymer electrolyte (containing cationic starch and 1-glycidyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [Gmim][Cl]) as the quasi-solid-state electrolyte system which could exhibit 0.514% efficiency. Despite its low performance against a liquid electrolyte control, this cell exhibited stability due to its good filling contact between the electrodes.196
The cross-linked starch nanoparticles prepared with ILs are promising carriers in drug delivery systems due to their relatively small size and narrow size distribution.13–15 Zhou et al.13 tested the drug loading and release properties of starch nanoparticles which were prepared in [Bmim][PF6]. With mitoxantrone hydrochloride as a drug model, drug loading increased significantly to 0.7317 mg g−1 at 1.5 h and then decreased as the time extended to 3 h, and 79.95% of mitoxantrone hydrochloride contained in starch nanoparticles was released within 10 h.13 Similar results have been observed in a methylene blue drug model14 and an indomethacin drug model.15
10 Conclusions and perspectives
ILs with desirable properties play important roles in starch chemistry (including starch dissolution, gelatinization, modification and plasticization) as solvents, plasticizers or reaction media. The multiple roles of ILs in starch chemistry have expanded the application of ILs in starch-related application areas such as the synthesis of chemically modified starches of high DS, the development of TPS and starch-based composite films, the conversion of starch into reducing sugars and HMF, the fabrication of biopolymer electrolytes and solar cells, and the fabrication of starch nanoparticles and drug carriers. The processing of starch with ILs is mainly affected by the IL cation and anion structures, ratio of the IL and co-solvents, type of co-solvent, and processing conditions.
Despite all of these advantages and applications, the current high costs of ILs could prevent many commercial applications.5,49 However, this drawback may be overcome by adding a co-solvent. Not only low costs, but also mixtures of ILs and co-solvent have many other advantages such as low viscosity, low dissolution temperature, low energy consumption, biodegradability, and simple processing of starch and ILs (the drying process of starch and ILs is no longer needed before dissolution). These features make the IL co-solvent systems promising in the dissolution and pre-treatment of starch. The other main drawback of ILs is their potential toxicity, limiting their applications in starch-based foods and starch fermentation. Besides the complete removal of residual ILs after processing, one important way to address this issue is to develop and use safe ILs likely be synthesized based on appropriate cations (e.g., cholinium)197,198 and anions (e.g., saccharinate/acesulphamate),199,200 which have already been widely attempted.
Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of the interactions of starch–ILs, the proposed molecular mechanism is still mostly based on speculation. For example, the dissolution mechanisms of starch in IL solvents are generally deduced from the study of the dissolution of cellulose in ILs. While both starch and cellulose are natural polysaccharides consisting of the glucose unit, many structural differences exist between these two biopolymers (e.g. glycosidic bond, crystalline structure, micromorphology, and molecular weight)18,69 that affect the biopolymer–IL interactions, leading to different IL treatment effects. For example, most starches can be more easily treated with ILs than cellulose due to the weaker hydrogen-bonding interaction in starch granules. While [Bmim][Cl] can dissolve cellulose easily, it faces difficulty in interacting with potato starch under the same conditions due to the presence of charged phosphor-monoesters in potato starch.21,89 Besides, the physicochemical properties of IL solvent systems also affect the biopolymer–IL interactions. Different from the case of cellulose, the co-solvents (e.g., water, DMSO, DMF, and DMAc) interact with starch in IL solvent systems; therefore the related dissolution mechanisms are more complex. Hence, future research is necessary for understanding the mechanisms of starch changes in IL co-solvent systems.
While there is growing literature about the use of ILs in the processing of starch for the fabrication of starch-based materials, some underdeveloped fields such as starch-based food, drug/gene delivery and Pickering emulsions require more attention. In summary, we fully expect great progress in this area because of the tremendous application potential of ILs in starch processing, and also the significant benefits that ILs can offer to address urgent environmental challenges.
