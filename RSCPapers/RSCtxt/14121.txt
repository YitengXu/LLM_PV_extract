    , Accepted 13th December 2018First published on 17th December 2018AbstractMolecular doping has been considered as an effective approach to realize novel conjugated polymers with tailored morphology, electronic structure and performance. Inspired by these merits, a facile strategy is presented to address the problems of insufficient charge separation and low photocatalytic performance of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). We designed and synthesized molecularly doped g-C3N4 polymers using basic fuchsin (BF), a common organic dye, as the dopant. BF-g-C3N4 exhibited an enhanced performance for the photocatalytic hydrogen production with a H2 evolution rate of 1619 μmol g−1 h−1, which was ∼4.4 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. The mechanisms for the enhanced photocatalytic activity were systematically investigated by the techniques of ultraviolet-visible-near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis-NIR DRS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence decay spectroscopy as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggested that the BF doping can improve the light absorption and change the electronic structure of g-C3N4 polymers. The doped BF molecules can create extended band tails that act as electron trap states, leading to an enhanced efficiency for the separation and transportation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. This study not only sheds new light on the modification of semiconductor polymers via the cost-effective molecular doping approach, but will also expand the applicability of polymeric photocatalysts.
Introduction
With the population growth and economic development, global energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been continuously increasing over the past decades.1,2 In addition, there is no indication that the energy demand and GHS emissions will fall in the future. As a result, the energy crisis and environmental pollution has become an increasing threat to the long-term and sustainable development of human society.3 Clean energy has been regarded as one of the most promising options to solve the energy and environmental problems. In a recent article published in Science, Barack Obama shared his point of view that the trend toward clean energy is irreversible.4 The clean energy economy has become a new engine of economic growth and many countries have formulated their clean energy policy.
Clean energy solutions usually focus on aspects, such as better efficiency, better cost effectiveness, better environment and better energy security.3 Renewable energy sources with lower or no GHS emissions play a key role in clean energy solutions. According to the predictions of the International Energy Agency, renewable energy will be the fastest-growing source of power generation for the period of 2015–2040, rising by an average of 2.8% per year.5 Renewable energy includes the traditional biomass energy as well as modern energy types such as solar energy, hydrogen power, marine energy, wind energy, hydropower and geothermal energy.6–8 Among these renewable energy types, hydrogen energy is considered as an ideal energy carrier due to its high energy capacity (140 kJ g−1) and environmental friendliness (no GHS emissions).9 However, methods used for the industrial hydrogen production are usually associated with the consumption of fossil fuel, which is inefficient in terms of energy utilization and not environmentally friendly.9 Therefore, new technologies should be adopted for the production of clean hydrogen energy without using any conventional energy sources.
Among several sustainable hydrogen production techniques, photocatalytic water splitting is considered as among the most promising pathways to eventually achieve clean hydrogen energy. Catalysts for solar-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting require a suitable band gap corresponding to the solar light region and good stability. Photoresponsive semiconductors, such as TiO2, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, WO3, CdS, ZnS, and TaON, have been widely studied in photocatalytic H2 production.10–13 However, these metal-based-photocatalysts usually have some disadvantages, such as potential toxicity, high cost and only being responsive to ultraviolet light. Metal-free conjugated polymers made from earth abundant elements, such as C, H, O, and N are the other alternatives toward sustainable solar driven hydrogen production. The conjugated polymer-based photocatalysts hold the advantages of favorable band gap (visible light responsive),13 easily tunable optical properties, electronic structure, chemical composition and texture.14 In 2009, Wang et al. reported their discovery of visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from a melon-based graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer.15 This has triggered an extensive study on the design and synthesis of novel g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, various methods, including texture regulation, elemental and molecular doping, and composition and surface modifications, have been developed with the aim of improving the performance of g-C3N4.14,16 As an emerging approach, molecular doping via copolymerization, considered as the most cost-effective approach for tuning the electronic bands and extending the visible-light absorption of g-C3N4, is currently undergoing rapid development and attracting increasing attention.16
In spite of the great number of studies on metal and non-metal doping of g-C3N4, only a handful of groups have studied the incorporation of whole molecules of dopants into the superstructure of g-C3N4. In this study, an organic dye named basic fuchsin (BF), which is an aromatic compound containing three amino-groups, was applied as the dopant for the fabrication of BF doped g-C3N4 (BF-g-C3N4) via a facile and straightforward copolymerization method. As we expected, the resultant BF-g-C3N4 exhibited a great potential in improving the solar-energy conversion efficiency, which is favorable for the photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Experimental section
Preparation of g-C3N4 and basic fuchsin (BF) doped g-C3N4
All the materials used for the experiments were of analytical grade as received from the supplier and used without any further purification. Urea, triethanolamine (TEOA), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) and ethanol were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Basic fuchsin was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Factory. Water used in all experiments was purified using a Milli-Q system.
The basic fuchsin (BF)-doped g-C3N4 (BF-g-C3N4) was synthesized via a copolymerization method, as shown in Scheme 1. First, 0.025 g of basic fuchsin and 8 g of urea were dissolved in 300 mL of ethanol. Then, the mixed solution was kept in an oven and dried at 80 °C overnight. The obtained mixed powder was finely ground in an agate mortar. At last, the mixture was placed in an alumina crucible with a cover and heated to 550 °C in a muffle furnace for 2 h with a ramping rate of 2.3 °C min−1. The resulting product was collected for use without further treatment. For comparison, pure g-C3N4 was prepared according to the same heating procedure by using pure urea as the precursor. A series of BF-g-C3N4 samples (denoted as BFx-g-C3N4, x represents the content of basic fuchsin, and x = 0.031 wt%, 0.063 wt%, 0.125 wt%, respectively) were synthesized by varying the ratio of BF in the precursor.

Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained from a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54178 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were recorded on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab 250 photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα radiation source (1486.8 eV, 500 μm). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using a Nicolet NEXUS 670 FT-IR spectrometer. Raman spectra were collected using a LabRAM-HR Confocal Raman Microprobe (Jobin Yvon Instruments, France) equipped with a 785 nm laser. Ultraviolet-visible-infrared diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis-NIR DRS) were recorded on a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and lifetimes of the samples were collected by a LS-55 system (Perkin Elmer, USA) and an FLS 980 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh instruments, UK), respectively. The photocurrent was measured in Na2SO4 solution (0.5 M, pH 7.0) on a CHI660 B electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, Inc.).
Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) experiments were performed at the BL11U beamline in the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL, Hefei, China). The beamline was equipped with two gratings that provided soft X-rays (20 to 600 eV, 5 × 1010 photons per s) with a resolution (E/ΔE) better than 104 at 29 eV. Fermi level EF = 0 was measured from the Fermi edge of an Au foil. The work function was measured to observe the secondary electron cut-off with a photon energy of 40 eV and a set biased voltage of −5.0 V. During UPS measurements, 4f spectrum of the standard sample's Au peak and the Fermi edge were applied for the photon energy calibration.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
Photocatalytic measurements were performed in an on-line photocatalytic hydrogen production system with a top-irradiation vessel connected to a gas-closed glass system (Beijing PerfectLight Technology Co., Ltd., Labsolar-III AI). A total of 50 mg of the photocatalyst powder was dispersed in a 100 mL aqueous solution containing 10 vol% of the triethanolamine (TEOA) scavenger and 3 wt% H2PtCl6·6H2O (with respect to Pt, acting as cocatalysts). The reactor was then sealed and evacuated several times to remove air before irradiating under a 300 W Xenon lamp (BILON, Shanghai, GHX-Xe-300) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The amount of evolved H2 was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (FULI, Zhejiang, GC-9790) with a high-purity Ar carrier.
Computational methods
DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 program to optimize the molecular geometries and calculate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of g-C3N4 and BF-g-C3N4. Becke's three-parameter hybrid exchange functions with Lee–Yang–Parr gradient-corrected correlation functional (B3-LYP functional) and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set were chosen throughout. The minimum trimmer unit cell of the g-C3N4 was chosen as the calculation model and the structure was optimized without any symmetry constraints.
Results and discussions
Structure and morphology
The morphologies of pristine g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4 were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1). The SEM images of the samples display a corrugated sheet-like structure with a rough surface and abundant micropores (Fig. 1a and b). TEM images reveal the appearance of a large amount of nanopores with a honeycomb-like topology in the bulk phase for both g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4 (Fig. 1c and d). The size of the nanopores is in range of 10–80 nm. The presence of a large amount of pores can provide numerous channels for the mass transfer and facilitate the charge migration and separation.17 It is noteworthy that the morphologies of pristine g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4 are very similar to each other, suggesting that a small amount of BF doping would not change the morphology of pristine g-C3N4.

The phases of the samples were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2a). Two characteristic peaks located at 27.5° and 12.9°, corresponding to the periodic stacking of C3N4 layers (002) and in-planar repeating tri-s-triazine units (100),18,19 respectively, are observed in the XRD patterns of both pure g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4. The inset picture in Fig. 2a shows a slight up-shift of the (100) peak from 12.9° for pure g-C3N4 to 13.2° for BF0.063-g-C3N4, suggesting a slight change in the in-planar structure of the packing motif.20,21 The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size were evaluated by the N2-adsorption–desorption analysis (Fig. 2b). The N2-adsorption–desorption curves show the appearance of hysteresis loops at high relative pressures (0.5–1.0 P/P0), demonstrating the existence of a large number of nanopores in the bulk phase of the samples.22 The parameters for the N2-adsorption–desorption analysis are listed in the table inserted in Fig. 2b. BF0.063-g-C3N4 exhibits smaller BET specific surface area and pore volume compared with that of pure g-C3N4. The pore diameter of BF0.063-g-C3N4 (89.50 nm) is larger than that of g-C3N4 (67.48 nm). The larger pore size may lead to the smaller surface area and pore volume. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 2c. The broad band in the range of 3000–3300 cm−1 is assigned to the N–H vibration of the amino groups. The band at about 1580 cm−1 is ascribed to the CC skeletal vibration of the benzene ring, confirming that the BF molecules are successfully doped into the superstructure of g-C3N4. The sharp band at ∼881 cm−1 is due to the out-of-plane bending vibration of triazine rings, while the bands in the range of 1200–1700 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching modes of CN heterocycles.18,19 The FT-IR spectrum of BF0.063-g-C3N4 resembles that of pristine g-C3N4 with some differences that are discussed in detail below. As compared with the FT-IR spectrum of pristine g-C3N4, several weak peaks appear in succession in the region of 1020–1200 cm−1, which can be ascribed to the stretching modes of C–N in aniline, and thus imply the successful incorporation of BF molecules into g-C3N4. Raman spectra of g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 2d. The Raman peaks of both the samples are quite similar, suggesting that the main structure of BF0.063-g-C3N4 is almost identical to that of pure g-C3N4. The bands at 712 and 765 cm−1 can be ascribed to the in-plane bending vibrations of heptazine linkages, and the bands at ∼981 cm−1 resulted from the N-breathing mode of heptazine units.23 Interestingly, a new sharp peak at ∼1530 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration model of CC bonds,24,25 was observed in the Raman spectrum of BF0.063-g-C3N4, further verifying the successful doping of BF into g-C3N4.

The surface elemental composition and the chemical states of the elements of BF0.063-g-C3N4 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. As shown in Fig. 2e, the high resolution C 1s XPS spectrum is deconvoluted into three peaks at 288.4, 287.9 and 284.8 eV. The peaks at 288.4 and 287.9 eV can be ascribed to the sp2 carbons (CN and OC bonds), while the peak at 284.8 eV is attributed to the graphitic carbon (C–C) arising from the benzene structure in the doped BF molecule.26,27 The high resolution N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2f) is deconvoluted into four peaks with binding energies of 404.3, 400.5, 399.0 and 398.4 eV, corresponding to the charging effects, amino N (N–H) and tertiary nitrogen groups (N(C)3) and sp2-bonded N in triazine rings (C–NC), respectively.28
Electronic properties
Optical absorption and the energy band gaps of the samples were evaluated by UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis-NIR DRS). As shown in Fig. 3a, BF0.063-g-C3N4 exhibited an enhanced light absorption in the visible-NIR region as compared with pure g-C3N4. The photoabsorption edge showed no remarkable difference between pristine g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4, indicating that a small amount of basic fuchsin doping would not change the main structure of g-C3N4. The band gaps evaluated from UV-vis-NIR DRS are 2.82 eV for pristine g-C3N4 and 2.74 eV for BF0.063-g-C3N4 samples (inset in Fig. 3a). These band gap values are consistent with the band gap value for g-C3N4 in previous reports.29,30 The enhanced light absorption and the narrowed bandgap of BF0.063-g-C3N4 are beneficial for the production of photogenerated electron hole pairs, which may further lead to an improved photocatalytic activity. Valence band XPS (VB-XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) techniques were applied to determine the band position of g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4. As can be seen in the VB-XPS spectra (Fig. 3b), the energy differences from the VB edge level to the Fermi energy level (EF) were 2.38 eV for g-C3N4 and 2.24 eV for BF0.063-g-C3N4.31 The work function (WF) of the samples was calculated by the difference between the photon energy and the secondary-electron cut-off energy from UPS analysis. The WF values were determined to be −4.87 eV and −4.57 eV for g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4, respectively. With the addition of the VB edge level, the valence band maximum (Evb) could be determined, which was −7.25 eV for g-C3N4 and −6.81 eV for BF0.063-g-C3N4. In addition, the conduction band minimum (Ecb) could be evaluated by subtracting the optical bandgap value from the respective Evb value.31,32 Considering the 0.08 eV increase in the band gap and the positive shift of 0.44 eV in the VB, the Ecb of BF0.063-g-C3N4 was calculated to be upshifted by 0.36 eV. The upshift of the Ecb levels provides a larger thermodynamic driving force in the photocatalytic reduction of the hydrogen proton and finally boosts the hydrogen production efficiency,19 demonstrating that basic fuchsin-doped g-C3N4 can be an ideal photocatalyst with better aligned energy levels for the photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also applied to verify the energy level of the constitutional unit of the samples. The HOMO and LUMO electronic orbits of the subunit in pristine g-C3N4 and BF-g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 4a. For g-C3N4, the HOMO energy level of the tri-s-triazine subunit is mainly derived from the combination of nitrogen pz-orbitals, while the LUMO energy level is mostly attributed to the electrons in C–N bonds.33,34 For BF-g-C3N4, introducing organic dye molecules into g-C3N4 can effectively relocalize the π-electrons. The HOMO of BF-g-C3N4 mainly localizes in the doped BF molecule, while the LUMO includes both the BF molecule and the tri-s-triazine subunit. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the samples are illustrated in Fig. 4b, where we can clearly see the up-shift of HOMO levels and the down-shift of LUMO levels in BF-g-C3N4 as compared with those of the pristine g-C3N4. In addition, the energy bandgap between HOMO and LUMO energy levels narrowed from 3.99 eV for g-C3N4 to 3.06 eV for BF-g-C3N4. The narrowed bandgap and the shift in HOMO and LUMO energy levels are consistent with the results from UV-vis-NIR DRS and UPS analyses. The non-coplanar HOMO and LUMO in BF-g-C3N4 are beneficial for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which may further lead to an enhanced photocatalytic performance.

Photoluminescence and photoelectrochemical properties
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating the charge transfer and recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in a photocatalyst. The PL spectra of pure g-C3N4 and BF0.063-g-C3N4 were obtained with an excitation wavelength of 368 nm at room temperature. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, the PL spectra of g-C3N4 and BF-g-C3N4 exhibited two distinguished bands, which are located at ∼440 nm, due to the intrinsic LUMO to HOMO emission, and at ∼463 nm, resulting from the charge transfer emission.35 It is well known that photoluminescence stems from the recombination of free charge carriers. A lower PL intensity indicates the less recombination of separated electron–hole pairs. Accordingly, the quenched emission of BF-g-C3N4 features the restrained recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, which are beneficial for the photocatalysis. In addition, time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of g-C3N4 and BF-g-C3N4 were recorded to study the photophysical behaviors of their photoexcited charge carriers. As shown in Fig. 5b, the decay curves of the samples were fitted using a double-exponential equation:36It = P1 exp(−t/τ1) + P2 exp(−t/τ2)where It is the PL intensity, τ1 and τ2 are the decay times for the faster and slower PL decay processes, respectively, and P1 and P2 are the corresponding PL amplitudes. The faster and slower PL decay processes originate from the interband exciton recombination and the indirect recombination of charge carriers, respectively.36 The fitted parameters are listed in the inset table in Fig. 5b. The τ1 value increased from 2.06 ns for pure g-C3N4 to 8.95 ns for BF-g-C3N4, suggesting the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated carriers and the restrained interband exciton recombination. The shorter average decay life times (τaverage) of BF-g-C3N4 can be ascribed to the presence of extended band tails, which act as electron trap states of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs.33

Photoelectrochemical experiments were also performed to further study the transfer processes of photogenerated carriers under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6, the photocurrent intensity of BF-g-C3N4 is much higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, indicating that the separation and the transfer efficiency of electrons and holes have been greatly improved by the BF incorporation.36 These results are in accordance with the PL analysis, further demonstrating the enhanced photocatalytic properties of BF-g-C3N4.

Photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities of the as-synthesized BFx-g-C3N4 and pristine g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 7. The basic fuchsin-doped samples showed an enhanced hydrogen evolution performance and the BF0.065-g-C3N4 sample presented the best photocatalytic activity with the average hydrogen evolution rate reaching 1619.0 μmol g−1 h−1, which is ∼4.4 times that of pristine g-C3N4 (372.0 μmol g−1 h−1). BFx-g-C3N4 with higher BF doping exhibited decreased hydrogen evolution properties. This could be due to the fact that excess amount BF would break the structural integrity of g-C3N4 and create new recombination centers for electron–hole pairs.33 The enhanced photocatalytic activities arise from the BF doping, creating the donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) conjugated structure, which finally leads to enhanced light-absorption as well as improved electron–hole pair production and transfer. Moreover, since durability is another crucial criterion for practical applications, the photocatalytic stability of BF0.065-g-C3N4 was evaluated by a 16 h reaction during 4 consecutive runs. It turns out that no distinct attenuation of the hydrogen evolution activity for BF0.065-g-C3N4 was observed after the cycling tests, suggesting its good stability against photocorrosion. It is worth mentioning that pristine g-C3N4 exhibits higher BET surface area than that of BF0.065-g-C3N4 (inset table in Fig. 2b). However, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is inferior to that of BF0.065-g-C3N4, further indicating the good photocatalytic performance of BF0.065-g-C3N4.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a cost-effective approach toward the efficient modification of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) via a facile one-pot copolymerization method using a cheap and easily available organic dye (basic fuchsin, BF) as the dopant. BF-g-C3N4 exhibited enhanced visible light absorption due to the extended π-conjugation and the narrowed bandgap, which facilitated the production of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the small amount of doped BF molecules acting as electron acceptors could improve the transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. BF-g-C3N4 showed an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity with the average hydrogen evolution rate reaching 1619.0 μmol g−1 h−1, which is much higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. These results may open up opportunities for the design of efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts for the production of clean energy.
