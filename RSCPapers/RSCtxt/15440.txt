    , Accepted 16th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractChlorinated phenazine-based donor–acceptor conjugated copolymer PCTClP was designed and synthesized through Suzuki coupling polymerization. Compared to the unsubstituted copolymer PCTP, PCTClP exhibited a narrower band gap and a lower HOMO energy level. PCTClP/PC71BM based polymer solar cells show improved photovoltaic performance with power conversion efficiencies up to 4.06%.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their unique merits, such as low-cost solution fabrication processes, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1 The bulk-heterojunction structure (BHJ) incorporating conjugated polymers as donor materials and fullerenes e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as acceptor materials has been proven to be the most successful structure for PSCs. The molecular design of new donor materials is one of the most important topics in PSCs. Ideally, good photovoltaic polymers should have relatively deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels to achieve high open circuit voltages (Voc) and a favorable spectral overlap with the solar radiation (low band gaps) to obtain high short-circuit currents (Jsc).2 The alternation of electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units has been widely used to design low band gap conjugated polymers.3 However, it is rather difficult to decrease the band gaps and HOMO energy levels at the same time in most cases. Thus, the band gaps and the HOMO energy levels have to be compromised by finely tuning the donor and acceptor units.4
Recently, the introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing fluorine substituent into the acceptor unit has been used to simultaneously lower both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels.5 Accordingly, PSCs based on these fluorinated copolymers often showed improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than those of the non-fluorinated analogue, primarily due to an increase in open circuit voltage. In the halogen group, chlorine is the second most electronegative halogen after fluorine. Some research groups have found that chlorinated molecules also exhibit both lower HOMO levels and lower band gaps than those of unsubstituted molecules, which might be desirable for photovoltaic polymers.6 Considering the easier availability and lower cost of chlorinated precursors than fluorinated ones, Cl-substituted conjugated polymers should be more attractive toward real applications. However, there are only a few reports6d on the photovoltaic properties of the Cl-substituted low band gap polymers until now.
Recently, our group has succeeded in using phenazine as the acceptor unit to construct a low band gap polymer (PCTP) for efficient PSCs.7 Herein we report a chlorinated photovoltaic polymer (PCTClP) by incorporation of chlorine onto the phenazine acceptor unit of PCTP (Scheme 1a). The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of PCTClP have been investigated. Compared with the non-chlorinated counterpart (PCTP), as we expected, PCTClP really exhibited lower HOMO energy levels and lower optical gaps, leading to higher Voc, larger Jsc and therefore improved PCE in typical photovoltaic devices based on its blend film with PC71BM. After solvent vapor annealing treatment, the PCE of the optimized PSC based on PCTClP reached 4.06%, indicating that chlorinated D–A copolymers can be promising candidates for applications in PSCs.
 Scheme 1  Molecular design (a) and synthesis route (b) to PCTClP. 
The synthesis route to polymer PCTClP is shown in Scheme 1. Cl-substituted M1 was synthesized from 1,4-dibromo-7,8-dichloro-2,3-bis(decyloxy)phenazine via several steps similar to the unsubstituted monomer for PCTP (see the ESI† for details). Compound M2 was synthesized by the procedures described in the literature.8 The Suzuki polymerization between M1 and M2 with the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst in toluene gave the polymer PCTClP. The resulting polymer was purified through Soxhlet extraction using acetone and hexane for 12 h, respectively. PCTClP exhibits good solubility in organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc. The GPC measurement with uniform polystyrene as the standard shows that PCTClP has the number-average molar mass (Mn) of 73.0 kDa with a dispersity of 3.4, which is comparable to those of PCTP (Mn of 72.1 kDa with a dispersity of 2.67).7 In addition, PCTClP exhibits good thermal stability (Fig. S1†), showing less than 5% weight loss at temperatures up to 305 °C, which is adequate for fabrication for PSCs.
The optical absorption spectra of PCTClP in chlorobenzene solution and as thin films are displayed in Fig. 1 and the absorption data are summarized in Table 1. Similar to PCTP, PCTClP shows two absorption peaks which is a common feature of D–A copolymers. The absorption peak at short wavelength originates from π–π* transition of its conjugated backbone, while the absorption peak at long wavelength could be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions between the carbazole donor and the phenazine acceptor.7,9 As the Cl-substituent is introduced, the ICT absorption of PCTClP in solution is red shifted to 564 nm compared to that of PCTP (540 nm). Going from solution to the solid state, the absorption peak of PCTClP at long wavelength exhibits a red shift of 42 nm, which is also greater than that of PCTP (26 nm). The absorption coefficients of the films were also investigated (Fig. S5†). Compared to PCTP, the absorption intensity of the peak of PCTClP at long wavelength was decreased, while the peak at short wavelength was increased. The optical gap of PCTClP deduced from the absorption edges of the film spectra is 1.70 eV, lower than that of PCTP (1.81 eV), which will be beneficial for OPV applications.

Cyclic voltammetry was used to estimate the energy levels of the polymers (Fig. S2†). The same as PCTP,7PCTClP presents one irreversible p-doping process. The HOMO level of the polymer PCTClP is calculated from the electrochemical onset oxidation potential (HOMO = −(Eox + 4.80) eV).10 As shown in Table 1, the HOMO levels of these polymers are observed to be decreased from −5.31 eV for PCTP to −5.41 eV for PCTClP. From these results, it can be concluded that the Cl-substituent could effectively lower the HOMO level of PCTClP as the F-substituent, which may have a positive effect on Voc in PSCs.2a The LUMO energy level is obtained from the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg.11 As shown in Table 1, with the introduction of the Cl-substituent, the LUMO energy level decreases from −3.49 eV (PCTP) to −3.71 eV (PCTClP). In addition, the offset between the LUMO levels of PCTClP and PCBM (LUMO < −4.1 eV)3a,4d,4e,5e is still adequate for an efficient charge transfer from the polymer to PCBM.
To gain insight into the influence of the Cl-substituent on the electronic properties of both polymers, optimization of geometries of their model compounds was performed using density functional theory (DFT). The electronic density distributions of HOMO and LUMO of the model compounds are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI†. The HOMO wave function is delocalized along the polymer backbone while the electronic density of LUMO is somewhat more localized on the acceptor unit. This redistribution of electron density shows a pronounced intramolecular charge separation between the donor and the acceptor.7 With the introduction of the Cl-substituent, the calculated HOMO of the model compounds decreased from −4.76 eV to −4.89 eV. Similarly, the calculated LUMO energy values decrease from −2.50 eV to −2.80 eV and the calculated bandgap reduces from 2.26 eV to 2.09 eV, all of which followed the same trend as those observed from the experimental values. The calculated LUMO-level offset between the model compound of PCTClP and PC61BM (−3.09 eV) was rather small but might still be sufficient as reported for several low bandgap polymers.4f These results support the ideal effects of the Cl-substituent as we expected.
The photovoltaic properties of PCTClP were investigated in the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. The PCTP based device was also fabricated under the same conditions for comparison. The active layers of these devices were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solutions of these polymer/PCBM blends. The optimized weight ratio between polymer and PC61BM is 1/3 w/w. The details on the device fabrication process are provided in the ESI† and the parameters of the devices measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G) are summarized in Table 2. The PCTClP/PC61BM device showed a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 4.79 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.43, leading to an overall PCE of 1.96%. Under the same conditions, the PCTP/PC61BM device showed a PCE of 1.56%, with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 4.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.43. Compared with the PCTP device, an increase of 0.10 V in the Voc of the PCTClP device was observed. At the same time, Jsc is also a little larger for the PCTClP device. Finally, through the introduction of the Cl-substituent, the PCE of the PCTClP device increased by 25%. The improved performance of PCTClP based solar cells is mainly attributed to their deeper HOMO energy level and lower bandgap.

In order to further improve the PCE of these devices, PC71BM was used as the acceptor material to improve Jsc because of its complementary absorption in the visible region.4 As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2, when PC71BM was used as the acceptor material the Jsc of the PCTClP based solar cell was improved from 4.79 to 7.61 mA cm−2. Correspondingly, an increment of PCE from 1.96 to 2.87% was observed. However, a relatively low FF of 0.41 was still obtained, which might be related to the poor morphology of the active layer.

The morphology of the PCTClP/PC71BM blend was studied by TEM. As shown in Fig. S4,† just as observed in the PCTP/PC71BM blend, the morphology of the origin PCTClP/PC71BM blend is rather uniform and featureless. For bulk heterojunction PSCs, the nanoscale phase separation and the existence of percolating pathways leading to the electrodes are essential to obtain optimal performance. According to our recent results on PCTP,7 we conducted THF vapor annealing on the homogeneous blend films to achieve an optimized morphology and to further improve its PCE. As shown in TEM images (Fig. S4†), the nanoscale phase separation between PCTClP and PC71BM could be clearly observed after solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment for 60 s under THF vapor, indicating the formation of the bicontinuous nanoscale morphology and percolating pathways, which will reduce the recombination of holes and electrons and improve FF.12 The corresponding current density–voltage characteristics of the devices after THF vapor annealing are shown in Fig. 3a. The PCTClP/PC71BM blend PSCs exhibit an improved FF of 0.58 and a little higher Jsc of 8.06 mA cm−2. Although the Voc is decreased to 0.87 V, its PCE is still improved from 2.87% to 4.06%. Under the same conditions, the PCTP/PC71BM PSCs show a PCE of 3.49%. The external quantum efficiency spectra of the optimized devices were studied to further verify the photo-response. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PCTClP/PC71BM PSC showed efficient photo-responses in the range of 350 nm to 700 nm. The highest EQE value of the device reached ∼60%, which is also higher than that of the corresponding PCTP/PC71BM PSC.

In conclusion, chlorine-substituted PCTClP was synthesized and used as the donor polymer in PSCs. PCTClP showed deeper HOMO energy levels and lower optical gap after introducing the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms onto the phenazine acceptor unit. Through the improvement of both Voc and Jsc, the PCE of the chlorine-substituted PCTClP-based device reached 4.06% compared with the PCE of 3.49% for the unsubstituted PCTP-based device. These results clearly show that the chloro-substituent is an efficient substituent that can be used to finely tune the energy levels and band gaps of conjugated polymers for high performance PSCs.
