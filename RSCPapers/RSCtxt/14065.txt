    , Accepted 2nd May 2023First published on 8th May 2023AbstractIn this work, a series of new lignin-graft copolymers were successfully prepared through enzymatic hydrolytic lignin (EHL)-initiated ring-opening alternating copolymerization of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin (DHC) and epoxides (EPO) through organocatalysis. A series of EPOs, including styrene oxide (SO), propylene oxide (PO), cyclohexane oxide (CHO) and lignin-derived-2-(2-methoxy-4-methyl-phenoxy) (MPO), together with DHC, were selected as model compounds to prepare EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO), demonstrating the tailor-made potential of this synthetic protocol. The reaction conditions were optimized and the structures and thermal properties of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) were fully elucidated by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF MS and GPC, DSC, and TGA. It was found that EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) with a monomer conversion of 81.52%, DP of 3.21 and Mn of 62.9 kDa was prepared at a molar ratio of 5:5:1, 140 °C and 24 h. The UV shielding properties, antioxidant activity and biocompatibility of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) was systematically evaluated. As a ‘proof of concept’ application, the potential of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) as an active ingredient in sunscreen was demonstrated, and a high sun protection factor (SPF) of 22.42 was achieved at 5 wt% dosage of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) in the cream, and the possible mechanism for the outstanding performance is also discussed.
1. Introduction
Polymeric materials play a vital role in almost all aspects of modern society. However, the poor biodegradability of petroleum-based polymers has caused “white pollution” and “microplastic pollution”, which is endangering our ecosystem and human health.1 It is well accepted that developing environmentally friendly polymeric materials from natural polymers is an important pathway to reduce the dependence of the polymer industry on petroleum resources, thus promoting the realization of carbon neutrality in the polymer industry.2,3 Lignin is one of the most abundant renewable aromatic polymers in terrestrial plants that are composed of C6–C3 phenyl propane units, including guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H).4 These structural units are cross-linked mainly via aryl ether linkages: viz. β-O-4′ and carbon–carbon linkages such as β-5′, β-β′, and 5-5′.5 The complex structures of lignin mean it is rarely utilized in high-value products but is incinerated for power generation or treated as a pollutant.6 In particular, in the production of bioethanol, enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) is usually produced as a by-product.7 Therefore, the value-added utilization of lignin will be significant in the foundation of a cost-competitive biorefinery.
Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight will cause the degradation of organic compounds, biological damage to the skin and discoloration of pigments or dyes, and so on.8–11 Synthetic chemicals, such as homosalate and avobenzone, and inorganic minerals were usually used as UV absorbers to reduce the effect of UV radiation.12 Although inorganic mineral ingredients, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, have good anti-UV performance based on the reflection mechanism, they cause discomfort to people, especially those with dry skin, when used as an active ingredient in sunscreen.13 Therefore, the search for greener alternatives is significant and eagerly awaited nowadays.14 The unique phenyl propane units, hydroxy, carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups along the lignin skeleton make it excellently applicable as a natural antioxidant, UV protection agent and even a reinforcement filler in synthetic polymer materials.15,16 Qian mixed lignin with commercial emulsion to prepare a sunscreen with enhanced anti-UV properties, and it was found that the sunscreen had a sun protection factor (SPF) up 5.72 when 10 wt% lignin was added. However low dispersion behavior was observed at higher lignin concentration.13 Modification of the morphology and size are mainly accomplished by the self-assembly of lignin in a mixed solvent. Further on in this work, Qian treated lignin with water–THF solvent to prepare lignin nanoparticles, and the SPF increased from 7.57 to 15.03 when lignin nanoparticles were added to pure cream at 10 wt%.17
Because it is the second-most abundant terrestrial natural polymer,18 the utilization of lignin as a polymer material will be a direct pathway to fulfill its values. Unfortunately, lignin is usually brittle due to its aromatic and highly complex three-dimensional structure, and it had poor compatibility, a low degree of dispersion and poor processibility when lignin was used as a polymer directly or as a component in composites.19,20 It is well accepted that chemical modification of lignin by taking advantage of its structural features can significantly improve the aforementioned limitations, thus extending its applications. For example, lignin can be modified as a macro-polyol through alkylation, alkoxylation, nitration and esterification of hydroxyl, methoxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups without fragmenting its intrinsic structure,6,21–27 achieving materials with great application potential in various fields, such as cosmetics and energy catalysis, and as surfactants and fortifiers, etc.28–31 Among these modification strategies, graft modification has attracted particular attention (Fig. 1),32 as a large spectrum of new lignin-derived materials have been successfully prepared with application potential in heat resistance abrasion,33 engineering plastics,34 water or oil repellency35 or antibacterial activity. For example, the copolymerization of technical hardwood kraft lignin with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was studied through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using a selectively modified lignin-based macroinitiator, and the thermal decomposition temperature and the degree of polymerization (DP) of the lignin-g-poly (NIPAM) copolymers were tunable.36 Gupta prepared a kind of water-soluble surfactant through kraft lignin grafted with the hydrophilic polymers poly(acrylic acid) and polyacrylamide using reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization.37 Although significant progress has been achieved, these strategies usually encountered limitations, such as requiring the pre-preparation of halogen-containing initiators and metal catalysts, which usually lead to problems of complex composition, biological toxicity and catalyst residues in the final products. A ring-opening polymerization (ROP) strategy initiated by an alcoholic compound is a well-established technique to polymerize cyclic monomers such as lactones and lactide.38 The multihydroxyl functionality feature of lignin stimulated especial interest in utilizing an ROP strategy for the modification of lignin, achieving lignin-graft polymers.39,40 For example, Tian grafted alkaline lignin with polycaprolactone through a solvent-free ROP strategy, which realized a significant improvement in the tensile strength, flexural strength and compatibility of lignin.39 Kai et al. report the preparation of lignin-graft-poly(β-butyrolactone) using β-butyrolactone via ROP, which could be mixed with poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) to prepare nanofibers with a tensile strength of up to 5.61 ± 0.63 MPa with only 2% lignin-graft-poly(β-butyrolactone).41 These pioneering works have demonstrated the significant potential of the ROP strategy to adjust the structure and properties of lignin, thus developing new advanced lignin-derived materials. Although significant achievements have been made, limitations to the diversity and structural tunability still remain due to the limited number of polymerizable cyclic monomers with high activity; furthermore, expensive and toxic metallic catalysts were usually used, which resulted in products with residual metallic catalyst, thus finally impeding their downstream applications.42 Obviously, the exploration of new polymerizable cyclic monomers applicable to the ROP strategy for the modification of lignin is of great significance, and will significantly enrich the structural architecture and increase the property tunability of the targeted lignin-graft polymer materials.

3,4-Dihydrocoumarin (DHC) derived from natural resources is a six-membered phenolic lactone, designated as “generally recognized as safe” by the American Food and Drug Administration.43 Although the homopolymerization of DHC is not successful via traditional ROP, it can undergo ring-opening alternating copolymerization (ROAP) with epoxides, initiated by benzyl alcohol in the presence of a superbase catalyst.44–47 These studies demonstrated a fantastic map to prepare a copolyester via ROAP with higher structural diversity and functionality tunability than the ROP strategy, because of the high designability of epoxide, which motivated us to introduce the ROAP of DHC and epoxides into lignin materials chemistry.
Herein, taking the multi-hydroxyl structural feature of lignin, EHL was selected as model lignin initiator, and the metal-free ROAP of DHC with epoxides catalyzed by a green organocatalyst, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), to prepare EHL-grafted-alternating copolymers (EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO)) was studied systematically. The protocol was systematically explored, and the thermal and structural properties of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) with different grafting efficiencies were investigated. The UV-resistant properties, antioxidant ability and biocompatibility, as well as the potential of the materials as an antioxidant and UV-resistant component in sunscreen were systematically evaluated. The study provides a sustainable avenue to prepare advanced functional materials with high structural diversity by using biobased chemicals.
2. Materials, instruments, and experimental details
2.1 Materials
EHL was purchased from Shandong Longli Company in China and used after vacuum drying for 24 h. Nitrogen with a purity of 99.9% was purchased from Guiyang SanHe Gas Company. 2-(2-Methoxy-4-methyl-phenoxy)propylene oxide was prepared according to the published literature.48 3,4-Dihydrocoumarin (DHC), styrene oxide (SO), anhydrous DMF, DBU, propylene oxide (PO), cyclohexene oxide (CHO), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and butyl phenyl ether were purchased from Aladdin Commerce Reagent Co., Ltd. SO, DHC, PO and CHO were dried with NaH before use. DBU was dried with KOH. L929 cells (mouse fibroblast cell line) were purchased from Tianjin Ruiboxing Biotechnology Co., Ltd (China).
2.2 Measurements and characterization
FTIR characterization of EHL and EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) samples was conducted with an FTIR spectrometer (FTIR, Nicolet iS50, USA) with a universal attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory, and obtained with 32 scans from 4000 to 600 cm−1. 1H and 13C NMR spectra, HSQC and quantitative 31P NMR were recorded on an NMR spectrometer (JEOL JNMECZ-400 MHz, Japan) in DMSO-d6. Details of the tests are shown in ESI Text S1.†49
The total degree of polymerization (DP) of DHC and SO alternating copolymer fragments was determined with eqn (1) according to a previous publication:39 (1)where Ib and Ib* are the area integrals of methine for two different structures, and If is the area integral of phenolic hydroxyl groups.
The monomer conversion of DHC was tested according to previous publications:50,51 butyl phenyl ether was used as the internal standard, where the calibration curve was performed on a gas chromatograph (GC, GC-4100, China).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a thermal analyzer and rheometer (TA550, USA) from 25 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Q2000 (USA). Each sample was scanned at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from −50 to 200 °C, then held at 200 °C for 5 min and quenched to −70 °C to provide the same thermal history before measurement. All the glass transition temperature (Tg) values were obtained at the second scan.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed in DMF at 35 °C using identical PLgel columns (10 μm, MIXED-B) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 (Waters, USA). To obtain the apparent number-average molar mass (Mn) and molar mass distribution (ĐM) of the copolymers, calibration was performed with a series of narrowly dispersed polystyrene standards.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) measurements were performed on a Bruker autoflex maX MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) according to a previous publication.45
The UV absorption spectrum and UV transmittance were measured with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu). Transmittance (%) was collected in the wavelength range from UVB (290–320 nm) to UVA (320–400 nm) on quartz slides coated with 10 mg cm−2 sunscreen. The SPF value was calculated with eqn (2) according to a previous publication.13 (2)where Eλ is the spectral availability of CIE erythema,13Sλ is the solar spectral irradiance,13 and Tλ is the spectral transmittance of the sample.
The antioxidant capacity of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) was evaluated with DPPH radicals by improved spectrophotometry.52 The test details are shown in ESI Text S2.† The scavenging activity of DPPH was determined with eqn (3). DPPH scavenging activity (%) = 1 − [(Abssample − Absblank)/Abscontrol] × 100%(3)
The biocompatibility and the corresponding quantitative data were obtained from calcein-AM/PI double staining and CCK-8 experiments, respectively. The test details are shown in ESI Text S3.†
2.3 Typical procedure for the preparation of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO)
The designated amounts of EHL (3.4656 mmol g−1), epoxide compound (34.656 mmol), DHC (34.656 mmol), DBU (1.037 mmol), and anhydrous DMF (20 g) were placed in a high-pressure reaction kettle with a magneton, wherein air was replaced with N2 until a nitrogen atmosphere was formed. The reaction proceeded at 100–140 °C for 12–24 h. After the reaction was complete, 1.3 mL of acetic acid was dropped in to quench the reaction, and 15–30 mg of raw liquid was used for gas chromatography to measure monomer conversion. The final products were then precipitated and washed with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. Finally, a series of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) were obtained after freeze drying.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO)
DBU has been identified as an effective organocatalyst for transesterification reactions,53,54 and even the ROP of cellulose with DHC to form cellulose-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propionate ester.43 To our delight, EHL initiated the ROAP of DHC and epoxides and it proceeded successfully under the designed conditions in this study, and the results are shown in Table 1. The molar ratio of DHC, epoxides and DBU can be quantitatively used according to the whole hydroxyl group content in EHL, which can be evaluated by 31P NMR.49 The protocol was optimized by selecting styrene oxide associated with DHC to prepare EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) under various conditions (Table 1). It was found that the conversion of DHC reached 73.83% and 81.52% at 120 °C and 140 °C, respectively, compared to 57.00% at 100 °C, indicating that increasing temperature could favor the reaction (Table 1, entries LD5S5-1, LD5S5-2, LD5S5-3). Together with the increased conversion of DHC, the corresponding DP increased from 2.12 for LD5S5-1 to 3.21 for LD5S5-3. Prolonging the reaction time could also favor DHC conversion, as evidenced by DHC conversion of 69.55% and 81.52% (Table 1, LD5S5-4 and LD5S5-3) being observed at 12 h and 24 h, respectively. With an increase in the molar ratio of the epoxide and DHC to the hydroxyl group content from 1:1:1 to 10:10:1, a remarkable improvement in monomer conversion from 64.37% to 81.70%, and in DP from 3.52 to 6.51 (Table 1, entries LD1S1 and LD10S10) was achieved. The protocol is also applicable to other epoxides associated with DHC to prepare the corresponding EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) (Table 1, LD5P5, LD5C5, and LD5MP5) under identical conditions.

The structure of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) was elucidated using 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses. Taking the LD5S5-1 sample as an example, the 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. 2A, and the peaks at 1.22 ppm and 3.65 ppm are assigned to the protons of the methyl and methoxy groups of the EHL main chain. The peaks located at 6.69–7.33 ppm and at 9.40 ppm are assigned to the benzene ring in the grafting chain and the terminal phenolic hydroxyl group, respectively.43,55 For the 13C NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 2B, the peak at 56.18 ppm is assigned to the methoxy group of the EHL main chain. The carbonyl groups and the carbons of benzene rings appear at 172 ppm and 110–132 ppm, respectively. The peaks at 65.8–73.3 ppm are assigned to the carbons of methylene and methine. The lack of SO homo-polymerization (SOSO diads) which could have shown respectively benzyl ether (4.70–4.25 ppm) and aliphatic ether (3.75–3.20 ppm) was confirmed by 1H NMR.55 The 1H NMR and 13C NMR of the other EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) are shown in Fig. S1–S6.† These results confirm the successful preparation of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) and obvious β-scission and α-scission type ring-opening of SO (Scheme S1†).44

To gain an in-depth understanding of modification through the metal-free ROAP of DHC with epoxides, the HSQC two-dimensional NMR spectrum of LD5S5-1 was obtained (Fig. 3). The signal from the methoxy substituent –OCH3 on the aromatic ring could be clearly verified at δC/δH 56.18/3.65 ppm (Fig. 3). Strong signals are observed at δC/δH 71/4.9 and 62/3.5 ppm, assigned to the B′2 and C′3-related signals in the β-O-4′ structures of B′ and C′. Signals for methylene groups (structure A′) and resin alcohol (structure D′) are also present in LD5S5-1. The main lignin cross-signals for guaiacyl (G) can clearly be observed in the aromatic region. Strong signals are readily observed for G2 at 112.2/6.93 ppm, G5 at 114.5/6.75 ppm and G6 at 119.7/6.67 ppm of the guaiacyl unit for LD5S5-1.56 Meanwhile, the structures of the copolymer chain of SO and DHC via ROAP can also clearly be detected. The signals at 79/5.6 and 74/5.9 ppm, 68.4/4.6 and 71.2/4.4 ppm, 25.287/2.6 and 33.992/2.76 ppm are identified as benzyl and phenylethyl groups, and phenylpropionate originating from the SO the DHC, respectively. In short, 2D HSQC NMR spectroscopy further confirms the presence of major lignin structures (β-O-4′, and G units) and the grafting moiety, and the successful preparation of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO).

ATR-FTIR spectra further confirm the successful preparation of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) (Fig. 4). Compared to the FTIR spectra for EHL and EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO), it is found that new peaks at 769 and 750 cm−1 are identified as peaks for hydrogen protons on the benzene ring, and a new band for CO bond at 1735 cm−1 appears in the spectrum of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO), indicating the formation of the ester group via ROAP. Furthermore, the use of different epoxides results only in a slight difference in the peaks at 3030 to 2840 cm−1 and 1280 to 1110 cm−1 assigned to C–H stretching vibration and C–O, respectively.

GPC measurement results indicated that all the EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) had a bimodal molar mass distribution, as shown in Table S1.† In the case of LD5S5-1, they consist of Mn of 135 and 6.2 kDa (Fig. 5A). The bimodal mass distribution indicates the presence of a backbiting reaction and the formation of alternating copolymers of DHC and the epoxides,57 which were supported by the MALDI-TOF spectrum of the LD5S5-1 product (Fig. 5B), demonstrating the coexistence of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) and cyclic poly(DHC-alt-SO) structures. Due to the very similar structures and solubilities of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) and cyclic poly(DHC-alt-EPO), they could not be separated by various organic solvents, especially alcohol, dichloromethane or chloroform. Therefore, the characterization of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) gives a comprehensive picture for the compounds with both structures. The good solubilities of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) in various solvents are shown in Table S2.† When the DP is less than 6.51, the products can swell in various alcohols and ethyl acetate. All the EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) can be dissolved in THF, chloroform, dichloromethane and DMSO, except for LD1S1 with its short side chains, which is less soluble in organic solvents.

Bearing the aforementioned findings in mind, a schematic picture is drawn to depict the ROAP process and its general mechanistic aspects (Scheme 1A). It is noteworthy that both phenolic hydroxyl and aliphatic hydroxyl are present in EHL, which can both act as initiators in the presence of DBU via hydrogen-bonding interaction. Therefore, two types of ring-opening reactions at the beginning of the reaction will be undergone simultaneously: (1) with aliphatic hydroxyl as an initiator (Scheme 1A), the alkoxide group on EHL as a nucleophile reacts first with DHC to yield a phenoxide species, which nucleophilically attacks the epoxide subsequently, rather than another DHC in the manner of either α- or β-scission (Scheme S1†), producing the desirable EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) after the ROAP reaction; (2) with phenolic hydroxyl as an initiator (Scheme 1A), the formed phenoxide acts as a nucleophile reacting first with the epoxides to form an alkoxide group, which nucleophilically attacks DHC subsequently producing another a phenoxide nucleophile, thus producing the desirable EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) after the ROAP reaction. With the formation of the grafted P(DHC-alt-EPO) on lignin, an intramolecular transesterification reaction starts to occur, resulting in a mixture of desirable EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) products and a cyclic alternating P(DHC-alt-EPO) copolymer, which is consistent with the GPC and MALDI-TOF results shown in Fig. 5.57 It is believed that after the ring-opening of epoxide, the highly basic alkoxide tends to recapture a proton from the DBUH cation, resulting in a proton exchange equilibrium between the two species. The aliphatic alkoxide end is highly nucleophilic,57 and is therefore responsible for the backbiting reaction.58 It was found that a high reaction temperature and basicity of the organic base, even the presence of a trace of moisture, also result in intramolecular transesterification, thus forming a mixture of linear and cyclic alternating copolymers.57

To gain an in-depth understanding of the initiating process by different hydroxyl groups in lignin in the presence of DBU, an LD1S0 sample without the use of SO and an LD0S1 sample without the use of DHC were prepared (Table 1). Their 1H and 13C NMR spectra are presented in Fig. S7–S10,† indicating a clear reaction between lignin and DHC or the epoxides individually under identical conditions. 31P NMR was identified as a powerful tool to evaluate the various types of hydroxyl groups distributed in lignin,49 which will provide direct evidence of the two initiating process shown in Scheme 1, as both will result in the transformation of different types of hydroxyl groups (Fig. S11†). The contents of the phenolic hydroxyl and aliphatic hydroxyl groups in EHL are 1.7931 mmol g−1 and 0.7379 mmol g−1, respectively (Table S3†). For the LD0S1 sample, the content of phenolic hydroxyl was decreased to 0.8968 mmol g−1 and the aliphatic hydroxyl was increased to 1.4847 mmol g−1 (Table S3†), indicating the successful reaction of phenolic hydroxyls in lignin with the epoxide to form a new hydroxyl ether moiety in the product. Similarly, for the LD1S0 sample, the content of aliphatic hydroxyl decreased from 0.7379 to 0.0909 mmol g−1 and that of phenolic hydroxyl increased from 1.7931 to 1.9877 mmol g−1 (Table S3†), indicating the successful reaction of aliphatic hydroxyls in lignin with DHC to form a new lignin 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl)propionate ester moiety in the product.
3.2 Thermal properties of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO)
The thermal properties of raw EHL and EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) with various DP were first characterized by TGA and DSC. The corresponding results are displayed and summarized in Fig. 6 and Table S4.† It is found that the thermal stability of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) is lower than that of raw lignin, and a higher DP is achieved, and a lower Td5% observed (Fig. 6A). This observation indicated that the grafted P(DHC-alt-SO) ester has lower thermal stability. As expected, the introduction of a flexible P(DHC-alt-SO) ester onto lignin can significantly reduce the Tg.59 The Tg of raw EHL is 157.5 °C and that of LD1S1 is 125.4 °C, and a further increase in the grafting content results in a gradual decrease in Tg, which was evidenced by the change in Tg from 29.1 °C to 16.0 °C and −3.6 °C for LD3S3, LD5S5-3 and LD10S10, respectively. It is also found that Tg is significantly correlated with the structure of the epoxides (Fig. S12 and S13†). Usually, EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) derived from an epoxide with a more flexible structure has a lower Tg.60 The Tg of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) materials with comparable DP follows the order poly(DHC-alt-CHO) (Tg = 15.6 °C) > poly(DHC-alt-PO) (Tg = 12.4 °C) > poly(PA-alt-MPO) (Tg = −1.4 °C), indicating their better flexibility than raw lignin. These observations definitely demonstrate the potential in terms of property tunability of the protocol by selecting different epoxides for desirable downstream applications.

3.3 UV-vis absorption evaluation
The UV-vis spectra (0.025 mg mL−1 in THF) for raw EHL and EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) are shown in Fig. 7. Strong absorption peaks are present for all specimens at UVA and UVB. The absorptions at 235, 290 and 315 nm for EHL are assigned to methoxy-substituted phenoxy and quinone groups, which have carbonyl functional groups or conjugated double bonds.8,61–63 The absorption peaks at 235–234 and 290–274 nm in the spectra for EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) correspond to π–π* and n–π* electronic transitions of the phenyl ring and the carbonyl group in the copolymer main chain, respectively.64 Moreover, a slight blue shift and hypochromic effect occurred with an increase in DP value. The UV-vis spectra of other EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) derived from other epoxides are shown in Fig. S14.† In particular, the UV-vis spectrum for other EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) also show absorbance at 235 and 279 nm. Nevertheless, the findings indicate the satisfactory anti-UV performance of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO), demonstrating their potential as new organic anti-UV reagents with better flexibility than raw rigid lignin.

3.4 Antioxidation of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO)
The polyphenol structures of lignin and its derivatives make them promising natural antioxidants.65 Bearing the phenoxy terminal structure feature of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO), EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) with different DP values were selected as model materials for subsequent anti-oxidation evaluation. EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) was dissolved in DMF with various concentrations, and the antioxidant properties were appraised according to the well-established DPPH-based colorimetric protocol under different conditions.43 LD5S5-3 (5 mg mL−1) showed excellent free-radical scavenging ability, reaching 90% scavenging activity within 20 min, as presented by a color change from purple to pale yellow in a flash (Fig. 8A and F). The results indicate the superior antioxidant capacity of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) over those materials reported in previous publications.29,66–68 The free-radical scavenging activities were 53.2%, 60.3%, 62.2% and 100% at 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mg mL−1 of LD5S5-3 concentrations at 25 °C in 95 min, respectively, which implies a non-linear relationship between the free-radical scavenging activity and the concentration of LD5S5-3. Moreover, Fig. 8C presents the DPPH scavenging activity versus time for various DP values. The free-radical scavenging activity decreased from 97.0% to 60.3% in 95 minutes with an increase in DP value, which can be explained by the fact that a higher DP value will decrease the relative content of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO), thus lowering its free-radical scavenging activity at the same mass concentration.

(B) The pseudo-first-order dynamic curves of LD5S5-3 at 5 mg mL−1 and the pseudo-second-order kinetic curves of 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg mL−1 were obtained at 25 °C. (C) DPPH scavenging activity versus time for various DP at 0.5 mg mL−1 concentration at 25 °C. (D) Pseudo-second-order dynamic curves for various DP at 0.5 mg mL−1. (E) The scavenging activity of 0.5 mg mL−1 LD5S5-3 at DPPH 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C varied with time. (F) Photographs of all LD5S5-3 samples after the initial addition of DPPH solution (A1: 0.1 mg mL−1; A2: 0.5 mg mL−1; A3: 1 mg mL−1; A4: 5 mg mL−1; B4: the blank sample). 
To further comprehend the relationship between antioxidant activity and time, a kinetic model was established according to previous work.43 In fixed reaction time mode, the time duration (20–30 min) is usually considered as an estimate of antioxidant properties.69 It is clear that different times were necessary to reach a steady state for antioxidants; therefore, the free-radical scavenging reaction can be categorized as slow, medium or fast.70 As shown in Fig. 8B, the R2 of the pseudo-first-order model was 0.9972 and the R2 of the pseudo-second-order equation was 0.9382 for LD5S5-3, when C(LD5S5-3) (5 mg mL−1) ≫ C(DPPH) (0.1 mM). The greater R2 of the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model indicated that a linear correlation better suited the free-radical scavenging reaction of LD5S5-3. Conversely, when C(EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO)) (0.1–1 mg mL−1) < C(DPPH) (0.1 mM), the R2 of the pseudo-first-order equation was 0.8488–0.9056 and the R2 of the pseudo-second-order equation was 0.8910–0.9761 for EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO). Therefore, the latter situation was better modeled with the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetic model within 20 min (Fig. 8B and D). Other relevant fitting results are shown in Table S5.† Increasing the reaction temperature from 25 to 45 °C, the reaction rate constant k1 gradually increased, and the reaction activation energy Ea of LD5S5-3 on DPPH was calculated to be 64.78 kJ mol−1 according to the Arrhenius equation. This is much higher than that of the small-molecule phenol system (2–9.8 kJ mol−1)71 and is similar to that of the fructose-system (77 kJ mol−1).72
3.5 Cytotoxicity assay of LD5S5-3
Even though EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) has satisfactory free-radical scavenging activity, biocompatibility is another significant factor that ought to be considered for any ingredient in sunscreen. The viability of L929 cells treated with LD5S5-3 was qualitatively evaluated by calcein-AM/PI double staining, in which the live and dead cells were distinguished by green and red dyes, respectively.73 To our delight, only a few dead cells were spotted in both the untreated group and the groups treated with 0.05–1 mg mL−1 (Fig. 9 and Fig. S15†), indicating good biocompatibility between LD5S5-3 (below 0.5 mg mL−1) and cells. Furthermore, good biocompatibility was identified by quantitative data obtained from CCK-8 experiments (Fig. 9C), as a cell viability of LD5S5-3-treated cells up to 109% was observed when 0.5 mg mL−1 LD5S5-3 was used.

3.6 Proof of concept application of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) as an ingredient in sunscreen
The aforementioned satisfactory anti-UV, free-radical scavenging ability and high flexibility, as well as good biocompatibility of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) stimulated us to use them as an active ingredient in sunscreen.
UV protection is usually calculated according to the sun protection factor (SPF), which is defined in eqn (2). A commercial cream (SPF 2.33) was used as the substrate and mixed with raw lignin and LD5S5-3 in various mass concentrations (Fig. 10A). It is found that a decrease in their UV transmittance was associated with an increase in SPF values. The SPF of the cream13 was evaluated as 8.2 when 5 wt% of EHL was added. In contrast, the SPF value went up to 22.42 when 5 wt% of LD5S5-3 was added, which is much higher than in previous publications,13,31,74–76 as shown in Table S6.†Table 2 summarizes the comparative improvement in SPF values for creams when different concentrations of raw EHL and LD5S5-3 were used. The better UV transmittance of sun cream with the addition of LD5S5-3 instead of EHL was partly caused by the poor dispersion of EHL due to its rigid structure and hydrophobic properties at such a high loading, which is consistent with previous observations.13 Compared to EHL, the modified EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) has a relatively hydrophilic side chain, as well as high flexibility (lower Tg), which makes it disperse better in pure cream, thus achieving a better SPF.13 The brown color indicates a limitation of lignin when it is used as an active ingredient in sunscreen.77 It is found that the sunscreen with the addition of LD5S5-3 has a light yellow color that people prefer, instead of the brown color in the case of addition of raw lignin (Fig. 10B),43 suggesting that EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-SO) is a very good candidate for broad-spectrum sunscreens.

4. Conclusions
Series of EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) have been successfully prepared via the ROAP of DHC and various epoxides when lignin was used as a multi-hydroxyl initiator and DBU was used as a green organocatalyst. The structure and properties of the resulting EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) have been systematically characterized and could be easily manipulated by the choice of reaction conditions and a facile selection of epoxides. It was found that EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) have satisfactory thermal properties, excellent antioxidant activity, satisfactory UV-shielding and excellent biocompatibility, as well as a preferable light yellow color. The ‘proof of concept’ application of the as-prepared EHL-g-P(DHC-alt-EPO) as an active ingredient in sunscreen indicated that they had a better degree of dispersion in creams and a higher SPF of 22.42 than that of 8.2 when 5 wt% LD5S5-3 and EHL was used. It is believed that the high flexibility due to the low Tg, and relatively higher hydrophilicity than EHL can be attributed to its good dispersion in the creams, thus achieving an excellent SPF value. In words, the findings in this study provide not only a feasible protocol for the derivatization of lignin via ROAP by using biobased chemicals and green chemical technologies, but also in-depth insights into the design and preparation of green functional materials from lignin with potential applications in biological fields, UV shielding and antioxidants, and so on.
