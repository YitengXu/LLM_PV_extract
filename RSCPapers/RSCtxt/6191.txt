    , Accepted 14th August 2018First published on 16th August 2018AbstractAlkylammonium cations were widely applied in 2D halide perovskites as bulky spacers to improve their stability, while diaminoalkane molecules containing two –NH2 groups at the heads of the alkyl chains have been rarely investigated. Herein, we report on the synthesis and properties of a new series of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskites with diaminoalkane as a bulky spacer, typically, with a compositional formula of (NH3(CH2)xNH3)(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10, and the spacer length effects were systematically studied. As the alkyl chain length increased (x = 3 to 8), the layered structure of the as-made 2D rectangular plates became more complete, and the differences in crystalline structure, light absorbance, band energy position and filming properties became evident. In particular, (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 (x = 8, abbr. as DAT) with a pure chemical composition was synthesized and showed excellent 2D characteristic properties compared with well-studied (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (abbr. as BA). A crystal growth mechanism including “layered” and “stepped” growth was originally proposed to elucidate the orientation and morphology difference between 2D DAT and BA perovskites. Moreover, the deposited DAT film showed outstanding film characteristics, including a facile fabrication method and an ultralow surface roughness of 2.97 nm. Furthermore, we have successfully implemented this new 2D perovskite in solar cells, and obtained an inspiring power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (in particular, CH3NH3PbI3) are emerging as a new generation of solution processable, low cost photovoltaic materials.1–7 Momentous progress in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been made in the last five years, and a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 22% has been recently reported.8 With respect to practical applications, the insufficient long-term stability of organometal halide perovskite materials has to be overcome before their large-scale commercialization. One solution to the stability issue has been recently proposed by employing the two-dimensional (2D) perovskite formed by “slicing” the 3D frameworks into well-defined 2D slabs.9–14
The structural formula of 2D perovskites is generally given as (RNH3)2(A)n−1MnX3n+1, where RNH3 is a large aliphatic or aromatic alkylammonium cation working as a spacer between the perovskite layers, and the A and M cations and X anions form the perovskite framework. The integer n is the number of inorganic perovskite layers between two organic cation spacers (RNH3). The first 2D homologous Pb series of halide perovskites (C10H21NH3)2PbI4 was discovered in 1989.15 Karunadasa et al. for the first time demonstrated the solar cell application of a 2D layered perovskite (C6H5C2H5NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 by integrating C6H5C2H5NH3+ (PEA+) into 3D MAPbI3 perovskite with enhanced moisture stability.16 Kanatzidis et al. reported the fabrication and properties of 2D perovskites (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–5) thin films employing the large alkylammonium ion CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA+).9,13 The enhanced moisture resistance was proposed to result from the hydrophobicity of the long BA+ chain and the highly oriented and dense nature of the perovskite films, which prevents the direct contact of water molecules with the perovskite.
There could be several options for alkylammonium cations in solar cell application, such as PEA,16 BA,9,17 IC2H4NH3,18 histamine (HA),19 benzylamine,20etc. By introducing these organic ammonium cations, a 2D network was constructed consisting of inorganic perovskite layers of corner-sharing [MX6]4− octahedra confined between interdigitating two layers of long chain alkylammonium cations. These two layers are stacked together through van der Waals interactions between the alkyl chains, which exhibited a relatively weak bonding and the distance between inorganic perovskite layers would be enlarged because of intermolecular repulsion.21,22 Thus, we raised the idea of replacing the alkylammonium cations with a diaminoalkane chain (NH2(CH2)xNH2, containing two –NH2 at both ends of the alkyl chain), so that the interdigitating alkylammonium bilayer would be replaced by a mono-molecular layer. Besides, the covalent bond within the diaminoalkane chain would be much stronger than the van der Waals interactions between the alkyl chains,23 which would further increase the 2D crystalline stability. One other advantage of applying the NH2(CH2)xNH2 diaminoalkane chain was the facile-tuneable chain length, achieved by varying the x value so as to further decrease the [PbI6]4− layer distance. In fact, a 2D layered Pb series of halide perovskite [NH3(CH2)12NH3]PbX4 films was successfully fabricated by Matsui et al. in 2002,24 which revealed the possibility of developing diaminoalkane-based 2D halide perovskite materials and their application in solar cells.
The substitution of a large organic cation could not only decrease the dimensionality of the inorganic components from the 3D structure, but also cause an increase in the band gap. The band gap of the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite gradually increased from 1.52 to 2.24 eV when the crystal structure was converted from 3D to 2D (n = ∞ to n = 1).9 A band gap of 2.1 eV for (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 was achieved when PEA+ was inserted into the MAPbI3 perovskite structure.16 Kamminga et al. observed a 2D/1D transformation and bandgap adjustment by introducing phenylalkylamines of different sizes.25 The wide band gap would limit the visible light absorption and thus decrease the photovoltaic performance, whereas the tuneable band gap of the 2D perovskite would broaden its potential application in tandem solar cells and light-emitting diodes.26,27
Herein, we employed a series of diaminoalkane molecules to synthesize 2D halide perovskites, namely 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP), 1,4-diaminobutane (DAB), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH), and 1,8-diaminooctane (DAT). Because of the two amidogen introduced in the molecular structure, the new formula for this 2D perovskite family should be (NH3RNH3)(A)n−1MnX3n+1. We successfully synthesized the diaminoalkane-based 2D perovskite powders, characterized their crystal structure and morphology, and proposed a hypothesis in explaining the crystal growth mechanism of pure-phase (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 compared with (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10. We also investigated the effect of the methylene numbers of the diaminoalkane molecules (from 3 to 8) on the formation of the 2D layered crystal structure and the phase purity. Furthermore, we dissolved these 2D perovskite powders in DMF, and deposited 2D perovskite films. The film morphology, optical properties and bandgap were systematically discussed. Finally, we fabricated solar cells with the as-made 2D perovskite films, achieving a promising photovoltaic performance as the first shot in this field.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead(II) oxide (PbO, 99.9%) and hydriodic acid (HI, 57% w/w aqueous, stabilized with 1.5% hypophosphorous acid) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol Corp. 1,3-Diaminopropane (DAP, 99%), 1,4-diaminobutane (DAB, 99%), 1,6-diaminohexane (DAH, 98%), 1,8-diaminooctane (DAT, 98%), butylamine (BA, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous) and the other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the solvents and reagents were used as-received. The NiOx precursor solution was prepared as described previously.28
Material synthesis
Raw 2D perovskite materials were produced according to a published method with some modification.10 Briefly, PbO powder (2.232 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in HI solution (12.5 mL) by heating to boiling under constant magnetic stirring. Solid MAI (1.06 g, 6.7 mmol) was added under stirring to afford a clear bright-yellow solution. In separate beakers, BA, DAP, DAB, DAH and DAT were neutralized with HI (5 mL) resulting in clear pale yellow solutions, which were subsequently added into the PbI2 solution. The amount of diaminoalkane in the synthesis was adopted as half the molar ratio of BA in producing (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 following the formula of (NH3RNH3)(MA)2Pb3X10. Initially, a black precipitate was produced, which was subsequently dissolved by heating the combined solution to boiling. The stirring was then discontinued, and the solution was left to cool to room temperature, during which black rectangular-shaped plates started to crystallize (∼2 h). Finally, the crystals were isolated by suction filtration, washed with diethyl ether and finally dried in a vacuum oven before storage.
Film preparation and device fabrication
Patterned indium tin oxide glasses (ITO, sheet resistance: 15 Ω/□, CSG Holding Co., Ltd) were cleaned sequentially by ultra-sonication in detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, dried under nitrogen flow and further activated by an air plasma cleaning treatment (Atto, Diener, Germany) before use. A compact NiOx layer was firstly deposited onto the surface of the ITO substrate by spin-coating the NiOx precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The film was then sintered at 350 °C for 60 min. The ITO/NiOx was then transferred to an N2-filled glovebox for device fabrication. The 2D perovskite solution was prepared with a molar concentration of 1.15 M Pb2+ cations in anhydrous DMF. Spin coating the 2D perovskite solution at 5000 rpm for 20 s without any other advanced method would produce high quality perovskite films. For the annealing procedure, the films were step-annealed with the temperature gradually increased from 50 °C for 10 min to 75 °C for 10 min and to 100 °C for 10 min. For the device preparation, the [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, Luminescence Technology Corp.) in anhydrous chlorobenzene was deposited on perovskite films by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, silver electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation. We also applied the DAT film in the mesoporous structure perovskite device, and the fabrication details were the same as reported.29
Film and device characterization
The morphological characteristics of the samples were investigated with a field emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Auriga FIB-FESEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/max2500v, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation (1.54 Å) operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The single crystal 2D perovskite powders were filled in a quartz cell and the use of glue or dispersion oil was avoided due to the clear deterioration of the crystals. UV-vis reflectance and transmittance spectra were obtained using an UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin-Elmer, USA) together with an integrating sphere module. The valence band maximum was obtained using a Riken Keiki AC-2 photo-electron spectrometer in air (PESA system). The photoelectron emitted from the sample surface is detected when the energy of the UV photon (=hν) becomes larger than the work function of the sample. The surface roughness of the perovskite films was characterized using an Asylum Research Cypher atomic force microscope (AFM). AFM measurements were conducted in tapping mode. Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were acquired with an optical spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) excited with monochromatic light (λexc = 460 nm, xenon lamp).
The cell efficiency and performance parameters were determined via photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves recorded under a simulated AM1.5 spectrum. A Newport class A solar simulator (150 W Xe arc lamp) was calibrated to an irradiance of 1.00 ± 0.02 suns using a silicon reference diode fitted with a KG-5 filter (Fraunhoffer ISE, WPVS). Electrical measurements were performed with a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter, with 4-point terminal connections. The active area was accurately defined with mask apertures (laser cut 0.55 mm stainless steel, 0.06 cm2). The scanning voltage step during the measurement is 50 mV, and the dwell time at each voltage is 200 ms. Forward and backward scanning directions were taken between 1.2 V and −0.2 V.
Results and discussion
In the present study, we aim to synthesize a series of 2D perovskite materials with pure chemical composition following the formula of (NH3RNH3)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1. The diaminoalkane molecules we adopted are DAP, DAB, DAH, and DAT, in which the methylene numbers of the alkyl chain vary from 3, 4, 6, to 8. The increasing methylene numbers will change the size of the inserted bulky organic spacer, which is a crucial factor for the formation of 2D halide perovskites by slicing the archetypal MAPbI3 3D structure in a perpendicular direction (typically the (101) direction for (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1) to a crystallographic plane (revealing the (0k0) reflection of the cubic structure).9 In order to clarify the comparison of different bulky spacers, we used DAX as the abbreviation of (DAX)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, and BA for (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1. Besides, the thickness of each perovskite layer can be incrementally adjusted by careful control of the stoichiometry. Here we focus on the n = 3 member unless otherwise stated.
The 3D MAPbI3 single crystals and layered 2D perovskite BA rectangular plates were firstly prepared as shown in Fig. 1a, precipitated during cooling to ambient conditions from a boiling HI-excess solution containing stoichiometric amounts of PbI2 and MAI according to the desired composition. The shape of 3D MAPbI3 crystals conforms to the underlying tetragonal symmetry of the crystal lattice. The BA rectangular plates exhibit a well layered microscopic structure. When we replaced BA with DAX cations, different precipitating processes and crystal morphologies were observed with varying alkyl chain length (Fig. 1a). The microscopic morphology of as-made DAP was a mixture of rods and spheres, and the other three presented rectangular-plate shapes, proving that the layered structure was formed during the precipitation and crystallization. With the increase of the alkyl chain length of DAB to DAH, the layered structure of the plates became more complete along with the increased sizes of the 2D plates. This reveals that a longer alkyl chain is more preferable for the formation of a well-defined 2D layered structure during the precipitation process.

To justify the exact chemical composition and crystal information, XRD was conducted as shown in Fig. 1b. Firstly, the crystal data and calculated interplane spacing for orthorhombic MAPbI3 and (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 are summarized in Table S1.† The 2D layers consist of tilted, corner-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra that propagate in two directions (the ac plane, with a lattice parameter of ∼8.9 Å), whereas in the third dimension (the b-axis), the octahedral sheets are physically disconnected by the intercalated organic bilayers, and the b values gradually increase from 27.57 to 77.01 Å with the number of inorganic perovskite layers varying from n = 2 to n = 5.10,13 Based on these data, the lattice plane distance d(hkl) can be calculated by the equation 1/d(hkl)2 = h2/a2 + k2/b2 + l2/c2 conforming to the orthorhombic crystal system.30 The diffraction peaks of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 can be separated to two series. One is the typical 2D characteristic peak of (0k0) reflections, representing the diffraction plane parallel to the bulky organic spacer layer. The verification of the n value can be analysed by counting the evenly spaced reflections below ∼2θ = 14°, which is a useful analytical tool for the estimation of the crystal structure of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 or related Ruddlesden–Popper systems.10 We can also find that the d(0k0) for the specific (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 follows the law 2 × d(020) = 4 × d(040) = 6 × d(060) = 8 × d(080) = 10 × d(0100) = b, which can be applied to the calibration of specific (0k0) diffraction peaks. The other is a series of typical perovskite characteristic peaks of (101), (222) and (202) reflections, representing the diffraction planes perpendicular or lying 54.7° to the spacer layer (the (101) plane we mentioned here also includes (111), whose XRD peaks are too close to be separated from each other). These peaks can be easily recognized in the XRD patterns because the crystal plane distances of (101) and (202) almost remain constant at ∼6.25 and ∼3.17 Å despite varying n.
When compared with the crystal data of the 2D BA perovskite, the DAX XRD diffraction peaks could be correspondingly characterized and the chemical composition of DAX could be confirmed. For DAT, the three evenly spaced reflections below 2θ = 14° revealed an n value of 3. Besides, the plane distance calculated according to the Bragg law 2dsinθ = λ (ref. 30) (θ is the diffraction angle, λ = 1.5419 Å of Cu Kα) perfectly fitted with the law 2 × d(2θ=3.48) = 4 × d(2θ=6.98) = 6 × d(2θ=10.48) = 8 × d(2θ=14) = 10 × d(2θ=17.48), as summarized in Table S2.† Moreover, the XRD peak at 14.09°, 28.22° and 28.42° could be aligned to (101), (202) and (222) because of the same d-spacing as that in Table S1.† With the same method, we inspected the XRD peaks of DAH and DAB, and the 2D characteristic peaks could be assigned to (040), (060) and (080), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1b. It's worth noting that DAH and DAB were not pure 2D perovskite products, since some diffraction peaks couldn't be assigned to any typical 2D halide perovskite characteristic peak. The impurity might be the by-product during the 2D perovskite precipitation due to the irregular coordination of DAX and MA into the [PbI6]4− octahedra.9 As for the DAP diffraction pattern, the XRD peaks at 8.96° and 12.96° might be the 2D characteristic peaks of (040) and (060), because they were coincident with the law 4 × d(2θ=8.96) = 6 × d(2θ=12.76). However, we didn't observe the other peaks which could be aligned to (080) or other (0k0) planes. So the trend of the plane distances in DAP could not indicate the 2D structure and the peak at 8.96° and 12.96° might also be the diffraction peaks of the impurity during the precipitation. As shown in Fig. 1a, a few layered structure was found in the DAP SEM image.
The n value of DAH could be estimated by the comparison of the XRD peak positions and calculated lattice parameter b with those of DAT. As shown in Table 1, the lattice parameter b of Ruddlesden–Popper DAH was estimated to be 44.73 Å by the average of 4 × d(040), 6 × d(060) and 8 × d(080), which was 6.25 Å smaller than that of DAT. Each n addition would lead to an increase of two layers of [PbI6]4− octahedra in a unit cell of the 2D perovskite, which was ∼12.5 Å, much larger than 6.25 Å. So we hold the view that the difference in the b value between DAH and DAT resulted from the different length alkyl chains inserted into the perovskite layer, without any change of n. Thus, the n value of both DAH and DAB was supposed to be 3.

Furthermore, we adjusted the amount of DAB applied in the synthesis of the compounds from half the stoichiometric amount of DAB(MA)2Pb3I10 (DAB-0.5) to 1.25 times the original amount (DAB-1.25) attempting to achieve pure 2D DAB compounds. The amount of the bulky spacer added in the synthesis was proved to be essential in obtaining the 2D compounds in their pure form, because of the solubility difference between the bulky spacer and MA in HI/H3PO2 solvent medium.10 As shown in Fig. S1a,† the increase of DAB would alter the crystal preferred orientation of as-made DAB, but not the purity of the composition. Several peak disturbances could be observed in all the DAB XRD patterns. As a comparison, we further investigated the effect of the amount of DAT applied on the 2D DAT chemical composition as shown in Fig. S1b.† A transformation of the preferred crystal plane growth from (101) to (202) was observed when increasing the DAT amount from 0.5 times that of the stoichiometric formula to 0.625 times. In addition, when we decreased the DAT amount, especially for DAT-0.125 and DAT-0.25, two weak XRD peaks were detected along with an observation of yellow hue produced during the precipitation, which was supposed to be the hydrated form of perovskite, MAPbI3·H2O.31 The high n members (n > 4) ought to be produced when decreasing the DAT amount, which were reported to be unstable (for 2D BA and oxide RP perovskites13,32) to be partially degraded to MAPbI3·H2O accompanied by the n = 3 RP perovskite according to the following equation:  
Here we believed that a similar disproportionation process occurred in the DAT system due to the same Ruddlesden–Popper crystal structure.
To sum up, a new 2D halide perovskite (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 with high n members and pure chemical composition has been successfully synthesized. Both (DAH)(MA)2Pb3I10 and (DAB)(MA)2Pb3I10 were also produced, although unsuccessfully separated from the other precipitated impurities. The 2D halide perovskite would not be formed if DAP was applied as the organic spacer, which might be owing to its too small molecule size to separate the [PbI6]4− layer.
The schematic diagram of DAX and BA crystal structures is illustrated in Fig. 1c. Instead of the bilayer of BA molecules intercalated between the [PbI6]4− octahedral sheets, there is only a monolayer of self-assembled DAT molecules. The –NH3+ “head” of the ammonium cation points toward the centre of the rhombic cavity generated by adjacent octahedra, while the two –CH3 “tails” of BA pointing toward the interlayer space are stacked together through van der Waals interactions between the alkyl chains. For the DAT interlayer, it could be regarded as a replacement of the van der Waals interactions between two –CH3 with a covalent –H2C–CH2– bond, which is of much stronger bond energy than that of intermolecular force. The length of the C–C bond (1.54 Å) should be shorter than the intermolecular distance due to the repulsive interaction.33 This could be proved by the decrease of the (0k0) interplane spacing of DAT compared with that of BA, as listed in Table 1. The preferred orientation of the as-made DAT rectangular plates differed from BA, as shown in Fig. 2. The typical 2D (0k0) crystal planes were strongly diffracted in BA compounds, indicating that the (0k0) planes preferred to grow parallel with the surface of the 2D BA plate. However, the (0k0) diffraction of DAT was relatively weak and the preferred orientation was the (101) plane. The orientation difference could be interpreted by the competition arising between the bulky spacer ions, which tried to confine the crystal growth along the b axis (we named the spacer dominant growth as “stepped growth”), and the MA ions, which tried to expand the perovskite growth along the octahedral sheets in the ac directions (we name this MA dominant growth as “layered growth”), as illustrated in Fig. 2. We believed that the “stepped” and “layered” growth coexisted during the formation of BA and DAT. Meanwhile the “layered growth” along the (0k0) plane was supposed to be dominant during the BA precipitation, resulting in a split-layer morphology occurring in the lateral side of the 2D rectangular plate, which was commonly observed in the BA samples (Fig. 2). As for the DAT formation, the “stepped growth” was believed to be dominant. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the octahedral sheets would occupy the whole lateral side of the 2D plate when the 2D compounds grew along the (101) orientation, resulting in a condensed cross-section face, which could be witnessed in the SEM image of DAT.

The 2D perovskite films were prepared on ITO/NiOx substrates by one-step spin coating of the DAX and BA precursor solutions in DMF, as shown in Fig. 3a. The 3D MAPbI3 film was also prepared for comparison purposes. The MAPbI3 film deposited by a one-step spin coating method has suffered from a low surface coverage, high roughness and non-uniform crystal size, resulting in low photovoltaic performance. Therefore, many advanced film deposition techniques have to been developed to improve the film quality, such as anti-solvent extraction, sequential deposition, solvent engineering, etc.29,34,35 Meanwhile a high quality 2D perovskite film could be straightforwardly achieved by a facile one-step spin coating method with perfect surface coverage and ultralow roughness.9 Herein, a highly oriented, condensed and smooth BA film with only a few grain boundaries was achieved as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Two dominant planes were observed at diffraction angles (2θ) of 14.20° and 28.48°, representing the 2D BA crystallographic planes (111) and (202), respectively (Fig. 3d).9 The DAX films showed different morphologies with the change of the alkyl chain length. Various degrees of dendritic texture were observed in DAP, DAB and DAH films, which we considered to be interrelated with the impurities associatively precipitated with the 2D target crystals. The pinholes in the DAP film were harmful for blocking the direct contact between the NiOx and PCBM layer. Despite the texture, all the DAB, DAH and DAT films showed full coverage on the substrate and smooth surfaces as observed in Fig. 3c. In particular, an ultralow roughness with a root mean square (RMS) of 2.97 nm was obtained for the DAT film, which was even lower than that of the BA film (3.93 nm), as shown in Fig. 3e. This observed level of roughness is much lower than the reported lowest roughness factor of solution-processed (8.3 nm)36 and vapour assisted (4.6 nm)37 perovskite films in the literature. Interestingly, nearly no grain boundary could be observed on the surface of DAT films, or highly oriented grains as found in BA films. The exclusive (111) and (202) reflections of BA indicated the vertical growth of the perovskite compounds. However, the XRD peaks observed in the DAT film could match with those of the 3D perovskite film but having a lower degree of crystallinity than that of BA and 3D MAPbI3 films, as revealed by the large full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the (110) plane of DAT (0.85°) compared with that of the 3D film (0.15°). We consider that the low crystallinity may be caused by the dominant “stepped growth” during the formation of 2D DAT plates as shown in Fig. 2. We investigated the annealing effect on the crystallinity of DAX films (see Fig. S2†). The results show that after annealing some XRD peaks of DAX films (referred to as impurities during precipitation) disappeared; however, the crystallinity of DAT failed to show any optimization (FWHM of (110) didn't noticeably change).

The optical properties and band structures of the as-made BA and DAX films were carefully characterized as shown in Fig. 4. The optical band gap and valence band maximum (VBM) were determined based on a reflectance and photo-electron spectrometer in air (PESA) system. Fig. 4a shows the transformed Kubelka–Munk spectrum based on the reflectance spectra of these BA and DAX films. The bandgap energy Eg is obtained by the Kubelka–Munk equation,38,39F(R) = α = (1 − R)2/2R, [F(R)hν]2 = A(hν − Eg). Fig. 4b shows the cubic root of the photoelectron emission intensity (yield1/3) as a function of the irradiated photon energy (eV). The photoemission threshold energy represents the ionization potential, which is the energy difference between the vacuum level and VBM in semiconductors.40,41 The obtained Eg and VBM of the BA film were around 1.87 eV and −5.39 eV, which were in accord with reported values.9 The similar Eg and VBM of the DAT film (1.89 eV and −5.36 eV) to those of BA was coincident with their comparable crystal structures and calculated lattice parameters. The bandgaps of the 2D BA and DAT films are larger than that of the 3D MAPbI3 film (1.54 eV), which is because of the quantum confinement effects from the dimensional reduction of the perovskite chromophore.42,43 Steady state photoluminescence (PL spectra) measurement was also conducted to describe the band structure as shown in Fig. S3.† The PL peak position of the 3D perovskite was around 780 nm, which is in agreement with the reported value.29 The PL peak of BA and DAT was around 680 and 700 nm, respectively. The shorter emission wavelength of BA and DAT indicated a wider bandgap, which was in agreement with the Eg results obtained using the Kubelka–Munk equation. Additionally, the only one PL peak of BA and DAT films proved their phase purity. Notably, another peak above the absorption edge region was observed in the 2D BA and DAX (except DAP) films, which was reported to be attributed to a long-lived excitonic state trapped in the strong electrostatic field generated by the localized positively charged bulky spacer ions around the negatively charged (MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 layers.44 Herein, this additional absorption peak indicated the existence of 2D layered structures in DAT films, which was not reflected in the XRD patterns in Fig. 3d. As demonstrated by Kamminga et al., the increase of organic ligand length in 2D lead halide perovskite materials would result in a blue-shift of the bandgap.25 Thus, the Eg of DAP, DAB and DAH should sit between that of 3D CH3NH3PbI3 and DAT, respectively, which is 1.54–1.87 eV. However, we failed to observed any obvious absorption edge in this energy range of DAP, DAB and DAH, which was because of the impurity in these materials disturbing the light absorption spectra.

As stated in the previous section, a new series of diaminoalkane-based 2D perovskites (DAX)(MA)2Pb3I10 were successfully produced. The organic bulky length showed a significant effect on the 2D crystal properties and band structure. (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 was successfully separated with a pure chemical composition and the one-step deposited DAT film shows unique film characteristics, including a facile fabrication method, ultralow surface roughness and wide bandgap, which offer marvelous potential for successful application in solar cells. Thus, we continued to assemble the solar cell and characterized the photovoltaic performance. PSCs with an inverted planar structure of ITO/NiOx/DAX/PCBM/Ag were carefully fabricated according to our published procedure.28 However, the cells made by DAP, DAB and DAH films showed short circuit behaviour, which we thought was because of the incomplete coverage of PCBM on the 2D perovskite films due to the rough surface (dendritic texture) as observed in Fig. 3b. The cells based on DAT showed inspiring photovoltaic properties. The energy band level of the as-made PSCs and their J–V curves with photovoltaic characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 5. Our first-generation 2D device showed a PCE of ∼1%, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 2.17 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.01 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44. Although the 1% PCE wasn't as satisfactory as the published high efficiency of 22.1% of PSCs with 3D lead halide perovskites, it showed great potential for further optimization. The high Voc of 1.01 V was particularly promising and could be applied in more complex structures, e.g., the top cell in a tandem solar cell.45 Additionally, there is still great potential for the improvement of Voc due to the huge gap between the conduction band of DAT and PCBM (an energy loss of ∼0.5 eV). A proper replacement of the electron or hole transporting materials to better fit with the band alignment may yield substantially higher Voc without the penalties for Jsc. We attributed the obtained low Jsc to the inferior crystallinity and poor orientation of DAT films as shown in Fig. 3d. Therefore, extensive optimization has been carried out, including the induced “layered growth” of DAT compounds so as to promote the (0k0) orientation in 2D rectangular plates, and an employment of the flash evaporation printing46 method in preparing the DAT film so as to maintain its orientation during deposition by avoiding the dissolution of 2D plates in DMF, which might damage the layered structure to some extent. These are under investigation in our laboratory, and the findings will be reported separately. It's worth noting that although our DAT cell has a low PCE (1%), it was much higher than those of the published first-generation BA-based planar devices, whose Jsc was only ∼0.3 mA cm−2.9 More recent studies on 2D perovskites have demonstrated enhanced PCE through deposition technique optimization and the mixture of 3D perovskites.11,18,47 However, the intention of our study was to expand the research perspective in choosing the organic bulky molecules from the widely used alkylammonium cations to diaminoalkane molecules. Our findings in the synthesis and deposition of well-structured 2D (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 materials indicate that this technique can be applied more broadly to use these materials in optoelectronic devices and enhance the structural stability of related 2D Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskites.

Conclusion
2D halide perovskites with diaminoalkane as the bulky spacer were firstly synthesized and the role of the alkyl chain length was investigated. With the increase of the alkyl chain length of DAP to DAT, the layered structure of the as-made 2D rectangular plates became more complete along with enhanced 2D characteristic (0k0) diffractions. Specifically, (DAT)(MA)2Pb3I10 with high n members and pure chemical composition was prepared and showed excellent 2D characteristic properties. The two BA layers between the [PbI6]4− octahedral sheets are replaced by a monolayer of DAT accompanied by the replacement of van der Waals interactions between BA alkyl chains with a covalent –H2C–CH2– bond. A crystal growth mechanism including “layered” and “stepped” growth was originally proposed to elucidate the orientation and morphology difference between 2D DAT and BA. The spin coated DAT film shows outstanding film characteristics, including a facile fabrication method, an ultralow surface roughness of 2.97 nm and a bandgap of 1.87 eV. Finally, a solar cell based on the as-made 2D perovskite was successfully fabricated and showed inspiring photovoltaic performance. Our work provided a new strategy for synthesizing 2D Ruddlesden–Popper halide perovskites, which was of great potential for further optimization of the structural stability and charge transportation of 2D perovskites and their application in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
