    , Accepted 6th February 2023First published on 15th February 2023AbstractHere, we present a new two-electrode photo-rechargeable FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO system. The key material is the photoactive lead-free perovskite Cs3Bi2I9, which performs photoelectric conversion and provides energy storage. This study is the first example of a battery system in which charging and discharging are based on bismuth redox chemistry. In the photo-charged state, the fabricated battery has an open-circuit voltage of ∼0.28 V in the dark. With a series-connected pack of these batteries, an LED was lit for tens of seconds in the dark.
Solar energy is an important source of renewable energy, which can be harvested by concentrating solar power, photovoltaics, and other technologies.1–3 Because of fluctuations in insolation, however, solar cells must be coupled to energy storage devices to provide a continuous, uninterrupted supply of electrical energy. At present, there are three strategies for connecting solar cells to energy storage devices: wire connection (four-electrode system), three-electrode integration, and two-electrode connection.4–6 The combination of solar cells and rechargeable batteries is typically realized through external connection of two individual devices, e.g., a space solar power station and solar rooftop power generation system. Some extra circuits and electronic components have to be used to overcome mismatches between an energy harvesting unit and an energy storage device. Moreover, such systems are large, heavy, and expensive. Another technology for integration is to combine solar cells and secondary batteries in a single device, which can be achieved with a dual functional electrode that can both harvest solar energy and store it, similar to a battery (three-electrode integration).7 Three-electrode integration might solve some issues of the four-electrode system. However, the three-electrode integration has a complicated structure and a complex interrelation between the light-absorbing and energy storage properties. Compared with the four-electrode and three-electrode systems, two-electrode integration could be the most attractive integration strategy due to the simplicity of the fabrication process, compactness, good quality, flexibility, and possibility for commercial production.6 First photo-rechargeable batteries were proposed by Hodes et al. back in 1976, which were based on sulfide or selenide compounds and were two- or three-electrode systems, respectively.8 However, serious issues, including the compatibility of the photoactive and energy storage materials, complexity of equipment, and low conversion efficiency, slowed the development of rechargeable solar batteries. Nowadays, solar rechargeable batteries have come back due to the possibility of direct integration of photo-electrodes into rechargeable batteries such as Li–ion, Li–O2, and Zn–air batteries.9–14
Some new two-electrode-structured photo-rechargeable battery systems have been emerging in recent years. Paolella et al. assembled a two-electrode-structured photo-rechargeable system using N719-sensitized LiFePO4 as a cathode material and a Li-metal anode. The solar energy was harvested by the N719 dye and stored in LiFePO4.15 Ahmad et al. reported the preparation of polycrystalline metal-halide-based 2D perovskite materials that can simultaneously store energy and be recharged by light. This photo-rechargeable device showed efficiencies close to those of electrodes composed of a mixture of battery and solar materials and had a storage capacity of ca. 100 mA h g−1.16 Boruah et al. presented a photo-rechargeable cathode for lithium-ion batteries based on V2O5 nanofibers. The batteries were charged to ∼2.82 V by irradiation with light and displayed conversion efficiencies of ∼2.6% for light with a wavelength of 455 nm.17 A kind of photo-rechargeable zinc-ion capacitor was also proposed by this team.18 Wang et al. reported the fabrication of a Si/CoOx/KBi(aq)/MnOx faradaic junction device that showed a record value of the dark volumetric energy density (∼1.89 mJ cm−3).19 Generally, these two-electrode-structured photo-rechargeable systems are based on liquid rechargeable batteries, in particular, lithium ion batteries. Their photoelectrode has several drawbacks: the mismatch of the energy levels between the light-absorbing and energy storage materials and problems with enclosing, since an enclosure for such systems must be transparent to light while preventing electrolyte leakage. In this work, a new two-electrode-structured photo-rechargeable system based on all-inorganic perovskite solar cells is presented. In this system, no extra electrode or liquid electrolyte was added to the perovskite solar cells to provide electric energy storage.
Bismuth-based halide perovskites have attracted great attention as alternative photovoltaic materials to lead-based halide perovskites because of their low toxicity and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Here, a cell based on a bismuth halide perovskite was fabricated according to traditional sandwich-type solar cell design. The structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). The electron transport layer consisted of a porous TiO2 film (prepared with P25). The counter electrode was Pt-coated FTO. The bismuth halide perovskite was confirmed to be Cs3Bi2I9 by XRD analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†).20,21

A prepared Cs3Bi2I9 film used in this battery showed two absorption peaks at around 500 nm and 620 nm (Fig. S2(a), ESI†).22 Two broad fluorescence peaks appeared in the wavelength range of 600 nm to 850 nm (Fig. S2(b), ESI†). The thickness of the Cs3Bi2I9 layer was ∼60 μm. The Cs3Bi2I9 film consisted of hexagonal sheets, as in earlier reports.23–25 The hexagonal sheets of Cs3Bi2I9 film can also be seen on the surface topography (Fig. S3, ESI†). The cell structure is represented by the notation FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO.
This cell displayed obvious charging and discharging behavior (Fig. 1(c)). The discharge–charge measurements were performed in the galvanostatic mode at 1 mA cm−2. The charging and discharging plateaus were reached at ∼0.6 V and 0.3 V, respectively. The coulombic efficiency was 80%. Fifty cycles were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 1(d). It can be seen that this bismuth-based cell showed secondary charge and discharge performance and its cycling capacity did not diminish appreciably.
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at 1 mV s−1 to investigate the electrochemical reactions during the discharge–charge process (Fig. 1(e)). Two pairs of redox peaks (A/A′ and B/B′) appeared during a scan from 0.4 to −1.0 V (vs. Pt). These two redox peaks correspond to the two-stage redox processes of the Bi3+ ion. Cyclic voltammetry was also carried out at scan rates of 0.5, 2, and 5 mV s−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The electron transfer numbers of the two redox processes were calculated from the CV curves according to the Laviron's equation.26,27  where EP is the cathodic peak potential, E0 is the equilibrium potential, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T is the temperature (K), F is the Faraday constant, α is the charge transfer coefficient, k0 is the rate constant of the reaction (E = 0 V), and v is the potential scan rate. The electron transfer number n can be estimated from the slope of the linear dependence of Ep on the scan rate (v). The values of α were determined to be ∼0.50. The electron transfer numbers were ∼2.4 and 0.92, for the A and B cathodic processes, respectively. So, the redox peak A/A′ mainly contributes to the reduction and oxidation of Bi3+/Bi+. The redox peak B/B′ corresponds to the reduction and oxidation of Bi+/Bi. The presence of a discharge–charge plateau can be attributed to the Bi+/Bi redox process. To further confirm this conclusion, we performed XPS analysis of the Cs3Bi2I9 layer at the charged and discharged states. It can be seen that the element Bi had zero valence when the cell was charged to 1.0 V. The zero-valent bismuth was oxidized to Bi3+ when the cell was discharged to 0 V. However, a certain amount of zero-valent bismuth remained in the discharged sample, which means that the battery was not completely discharged. The remaining zero-valent bismuth constituted ∼25% at. % of the total Bi content, which was in accordance with the charge/discharge coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, the XRD spectra of the charged samples and the samples subjected to 50 cycles (Fig. S5, ESI†) had weak diffraction peaks related to metallic bismuth, which also confirmed the formation of metallic Bi during the charging and discharging processes in the batteries. However, it can also be seen that the main diffraction peaks in the spectra of the charged samples and the samples subjected to 50 cycles showed almost no change, which mainly corresponded to Cs3Bi2I9. Combining these findings with the XPS results for the charged samples lead to the conclusion that the charge/discharge processes in the batteries involve only the surface of the Cs3Bi2I9 particles.
The prepared FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO cells also showed efficient photoelectric conversion properties (Fig. 2(a)). The cells exhibited photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼1.03% (JSC = 6.55 mA cm−2; VOC = 0.443 V; FF = 35.3%). It is worth noting that traditional solar cells generate photovoltage while they are exposed to light, but it disappears in the dark. However, this solar cell, based on bismuth halide perovskites, was able to generate voltage in the dark after illumination with a xenon lamp. Statistical results of the open circuit voltage measurements of the battery under light and dark conditions are shown in Fig. 2(b). The average open circuit voltage of the battery in the dark was ∼0.28 V, which was lower than that under light. The open circuit voltage observed in the dark might be due to the charging of the battery under illumination. To verify this possibility, transient current curves were measured without applying a bias potential when the light was turned on and off (Fig. 2(c)). The initial photocurrent density was ∼0.17 mA cm−2 under the illumination of 1 sun (a simulated sunlight source), which then rapidly decayed. Wang et al. supposed that this process represents the charging of the battery.19,28 In this experiment, the illumination seems to be promoting the reduction of Bi3+ ions in the Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite materials, which is how this battery is charging. An opposite current density of −0.065 mA cm−2 appeared when the light was off. This dark current can be attributed to the discharging process of the battery, in which the Bi reduced under illumination undergoes oxidation. Moreover, the cycling stability of the device during photocharging and dark discharging was also measured (Fig. S6, ESI†). The photo-charging and dark discharging of the prepared cells continued (without noticeable diminution) during ∼60 cycles. However, the photo current and dark current decreased to 0.06 mA cm−2 and −0.023 mA cm−2, respectively, which must be related to the decay of the charge/discharge properties of the FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO cells. We also investigated the effects of illumination on the discharge process of the battery (shown in Fig. 2(d)). The charging and discharging currents were maintained at 1 mA cm−2. The light was turned on during the discharge process. The output voltage increased sharply from 0.30 to 0.47 V. The output voltage decayed slowly to 0.27 V and the discharging time was extended to thousands of seconds. Meanwhile, the output voltage decreased sharply to 0 V when the light was turned off (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). It can be seen that the illumination had noticeable effects on the battery discharging process. On the one hand, the illumination can provide photoexcited electrons for the reduction of Bi3+ ions. The mechanism of this process is illustrated in Fig. 2(e). The reduced Bi is reoxidized to Bi3+ during the discharge process through an external circuit. On the other hand, photocurrent is generated under illumination.

(d) Effects of illumination on the cell discharging. (e) Schematic diagram of the working principle of photocharging and discharging processes in our battery. 
Finally, 30 FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO batteries were connected in series (Fig S8, ESI†). The output voltage of this battery pack was 6.0 V in the dark state, which was enough to power a light emitting diode (LED) in the dark under zero bias (Fig. 3a and Movies S1–S4, ESI†). It can be seen that the photo-charged FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO batteries can be used as a practical power supply device. It was also found that the lighting time of the LED in the dark was longer if the illumination time was extended (Fig. 3(b)). The relationship between the lighting time of the LED and the illumination time was linear, which indicated that longer illumination allows obtaining more electricity from our FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO batteries.

In summary, a new kind of photo-rechargeable all-solid-state battery (denoted by FTO/TiO2/Cs3Bi2I9/Pt/FTO) was designed, in which a single active material was used to provide both light absorption, photoelectric conversion, and electric energy storage. In doing so, the photoelectric conversion and the energy storage processes were organically combined with each other. The battery charging and discharging is based on the redox processes of bismuth ions. The photocharged batteries showed an open-circuit voltage of about 0.28 V under dark conditions. In the dark, the series-connected batteries (i.e., the battery pack) were enough to light a LED light for tens of seconds. The LED lighting time increased almost linearly with the extension of the illumination time. It can be seen that the designed photo-rechargeable battery system is promising for practical applications because of its all solid-state design, flexibility, and organic unity of photoelectric conversion and photoelectric storage. However, there are also many difficulties in developing this system: the mechanism of photo-charge and discharge is not well understood and it has low open circuit voltage and low coulombic efficiency. It is believed that after some improvements this photo-rechargeable system will be an ideal source of electric power for portable electronic equipment in the near future.
