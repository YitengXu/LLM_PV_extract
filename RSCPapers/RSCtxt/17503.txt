The compounds appeared within hours or days and subsequently re-dissolved in the mother liquor, leading to [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2 as the final product. Single crystal X-ray analysis showed that all four compounds feature unprecedented anion motifs.
Introduction
Halogenido metalates, especially of the heavy group 14 and 15 elements, show optical and electronic properties like photoluminescence,1,2 ferroelectricity3,4 and semiconductivity5 which make them attractive for device applications.6,7 Besides a facile processability at room temperature8 especially metalates of antimony and bismuth often show only little sensitivity to air or moisture,9 unlike the more extensively studied tin and lead halides.10 Nonetheless, insights into the formation processes of these compounds in solution remain limited and have been mostly focused on MAPbX3 (MA = methylammonium; X = Cl, Br, I) and related structures.11
These compounds are exemplary for the renaissance of iodido metalates as light absorbers in hybrid perovskite solar cells.12 This emergent class of photovoltaic absorber materials reached power conversion efficiencies in prototype devices over 20%, based on formamidinium lead iodide.13,14 The technology's bottlenecks are the toxicity of lead,15 as well as the compound's sensitivity to heat and moisture.16 A promising solution seems to be the heterovalent substitution of lead with bismuth or antimony.17,18 Here, the antimonates have only recently come into focus.19,20 This progress was based on a number of earlier works, for example by Mitzi and coworkers, who synthesized Cs3[Sb2I9] in two structural modifications featuring layered or molecular anions, and processed the compound into thin films with enhanced moisture stability.21 The Mathews group showed that a substitution of Cs+ with Rb+ can template the formation of a layered structure when processed in solution,22 while Jakubas prepared [Sb2I9]3− salts with organic imidazolium cations.23 Recent investigations of the excitation dynamics in MA3[Sb2I9] have shown that using this compound and related materials for photovoltaics may be challenging,24 but other applications such as hard radiation detection may hold more promise.25 The interest in halogenido antimonates as absorption materials for photovoltaics is preceded by more fundamental investigations of their chemistry with much of the early work on iodido antimonates performed the 1980s by the group of Pohl.26–32 Iodido antimonates and the closely related bismuthates show an expansive structural chemistry with MI6 octahedra (M = Sb, Bi) as the main building block, connected via corner- edge- or face-sharing into anions of varying complexity. Antimony especially tends to form intricate discrete or 1D anions with diverse connectivity modes of the coordination polyhedra and flexible Sb–I interatomic distances.33–36
Siegfried Pohl investigated the structural chemistry of iodido antimonates nearly thirty years ago. Inspired by his work and looking to investigate the system CuI/SbI3/MeCN in preparation for the synthesis of ternary Cu/Sb/I anions, we repeated the synthesis of [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2.31 Unexpectedly, we could identify four transient iodido antimonates crystallizing prior to the described compound. All four compounds possess anion motifs previously unknown for halogenido antimonates. Crystals of the products form within hours or days and dissolve entirely in the mother liquor subsequently, a phenomenon that has not been described for iodido pentelates yet. The results not only emphasize the structural variety of the material class, but also offer a first glimpse into the intricate kinetics involved in the formation processes.
Experimental
General
Antimony triiodide (SbI3) was synthesized from the elements according to literature procedure.37 Copper(I) iodide (CuI) and acetonitrile were used as supplied from commercial sources.
Synthesis

[Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb6I22]·2MeCN (1), [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb7I25]·MeCN (2) and [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb10I34] (3). 
SbI3 (75 mg, 0.15 mmol) and CuI (20 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of acetonitrile by heating to reflux under magnetic stirring for 30 min. The hot reaction solution was left to cool to room temperature and stored for crystallization at −18 °C. Bright orange block-shaped crystals (1), as well as thin yellow planks (2) formed after four hours. After two days, dark red blocks (3) had crystallized. An isolation of bulk quantities of the crystals was not possible due to poor stability outside the mother liquor.


[Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb8I28] (4). 
SbI3 (75 mg, 0.15 mmol) and CuI (20 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of acetonitrile by heating to reflux under magnetic stirring for 30 min. The hot reaction solution was left to cool to room temperature and stored for crystallization. Bright orange blocks crystallized after three days at room temperature. The crystals showed poor stability in air due to loss of acetonitrile.

Single crystal X-ray crystallography
Single crystal X-ray diffraction was performed at 100 or 110 K on a Bruker Quest D8 diffractometer with microfocus Mo Kα radiation and a Photon 100 (CMOS) detector for compound 1, 2 and 3 and on a STOE IPDS2 diffractometer equipped with an imaging plate detector system using MoKα radiation with graphite monochromatization for compound 4. The structures were solved using direct methods, refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques and expanded using Fourier techniques, using the ShelX software package38–40 within the OLEX2 suite.41 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically unless indicated otherwise. Hydrogen atoms were assigned to idealized geometric positions and included in structure factors calculations. See ESI† for details on individual refinements. Pictures of the crystal structures were created using DIAMOND.42 The data for 1–4 has also been deposited as CCDC 1881276–1881279.†
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of 1 to 4 could be accomplished by following the method described by Pohl,31 dissolving 0.15 mmol SbI3 and 0.1 mmol CuI in 5 mL of acetonitrile by heating to reflux. The reaction solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature and was stored at −18 °C, leading to compounds 1 to 3, or at room temperature, resulting in compound 4. After few hours at −18 °C, orange and yellow crystals of 1 and 2 can be observed in the reaction solution. After few more hours, dark red blocks can be found in addition, until after two days, the crystals of 1 and 2 dissolved completely in the mother liquor and just dark red blocks of 3 can be found. After four more days, crystals of 3 disappeared, and only crystals of the known compound [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]231 are present now. An isolation of bulk samples of the compounds was not possible: 1, 2 and 3 rapidly lose acetonitrile when taken from the mother liquor and attempts to store the crystals under acetonitrile atmosphere for additional investigations were not successful.
When storing the reaction solution at room temperature, bright orange rods can be observed, consisting of aggregates of single crystals of 4. After two weeks, these crystals also dissolve in the mother liquor, forming once again the known compound [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2. Once again, an isolation of bulk quantities of 4 was not possible due to loss of acetonitrile.
Photographs of the single crystals are shown in Fig. 1, a schematic overview of the crystallization process is given in Fig. 2.

Description of the crystal structures
All four compounds feature the same cation, which consists of a Cu(I) ion coordinated by four acetonitrile ligands in a tetrahedral arrangement, shielding the charge of the Cu(I) ion and giving the cation a voluminous spherical shape. Thus, only little interactions between cation and anion are observed in compounds 1 to 4. Selected crystal data are given in Table 1. It has to be noted that the crystal colors described here are lighter than in the photographs, due to the well-known thermochromism of iodido pentelates, shifting the compounds’ color from orange or red at room temperature to yellow or orange at 100 K.43

Compound 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system in the space group I41/a. The anion consists of a discrete hexanuclear unit, constructed from [SbI6]3− octahedra sharing common edges. Previously, three [Sb6I22]4− anions have been reported,29,31,32 which can all be derived from the tetranuclear [Sb4I16]4−,44 whose structure can be understood as cutouts from layers in the CdI2 structure.45 As its isomers, compound 1 can be derived from [Sb4I16]4− by adding two neutral SbI3 units to the anion. For this, different positions are possible. If the positions of the added SbI3 units lie in the same plane as the metal atoms of the [Sb4I16]4− unit, another anion with CdI2-like structure is obtained (isomer A).31 If they lie behind and in front of the plane, two isomers are possible. In one case, the SbI3 units are added to the [Sb4I16]4− unit in such a way that they complete the fragment to form a double cube structure (isomer B).29
In this case, each [SbI6]3− octahedron has the same orientation, resulting in a close condensation of the octahedra and formation of μ4-bridging iodine atoms. In the second case, the addition of two SbI3 units results only in the formation of μ3-bridging iodine atoms, resulting in face-sharing octahedra, instead of the corner-sharing octahedra found in the other isomers (isomer C).32 The three different isomers are displayed in Fig. 3. In the case of compound 1, the condensed SbI3 units are situated above and below the plane of the four other Sb atoms. This structure has been described for the homologous bismuthate [Bi6I22]4−.46 In the unit cell of 1, anions and cations arrange in a way that allows the formation of channels along the crystallographic c-axis. These channels are formed by the cations, while the anions occupy the voids between them. There are two different types of channels present, as displayed in Fig. 4, where they can be distinguished by the orientation of the acetonitrile ligands. While they are pointing inside the channel in type I, reducing its volume, they adopt a more compact arrangement in type II.

When regarding the packing of the channels along the c-axis, as shown in Fig. 5, it becomes clear that they can also be distinguished by a different symmetry operation. In type I, the cations are arranged along a fourfold screw axis, giving the channel a more open structure compared to the type II channels, where the cations are arranged along a fourfold roto-inversion axis. Along both channel types disordered acetonitrile molecules can be found (see ESI† for details). Single crystal X-ray diffraction indicated a composition of two molecules of acetonitrile per formula unit. This initiates a fast decomposition of the crystals in air and even silicon oil, as the solvate acetonitrile evaporates. The sensitivity to solvent loss is not unexpected, as Pohl has already described this issue for [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2.31 As the solvate acetonitrile molecules are trapped inside the channels in 1, they can only leave the crystal in one direction. The process can be observed macroscopically under the microscope as a rapid independent movement during decomposition.

Compound 2 crystallizes as yellowish needles in the monoclinic space group P21. The structure of the anion can also be derived from the CdI2 structure. The known anions [Sb2I10]4−,47 [Sb4I16]4−,44 [Sb6I22]4− (ref. 31) and [Sb8I28]4− (ref. 27) can each be derived from the previous structure in the series by adding two SbI3 units to it, while the metal atoms all lie in the same plane. With 2, the first halogenido antimonate compound of this family with an odd number of metal atoms in the molecular anion was synthesized. The anion consists of seven edge-sharing SbI6 octahedra and can be derived from the [Sb6I22]4− isomer B by formal addition of one SbI3 unit. Excerpts of the crystal structure of 2 are shown in Fig. 6.

Compound 3 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1, with an unusual 1D anion. The polymeric chains are formed of condensed [Sb10I34]4− building blocks. Compared to other iodido antimonates with chain-like anions, these building blocks are rather complex. Typically, polymeric anions with the formula [SbI5]2− or [SbI4]− are found,44,48 consisting of corner- or edge-sharing [SbI6]3− octahedra. Additionally, anions composed of small building blocks like [Sb3I10]−, which are connected via common edges into a polymeric chain anion, are known.27 The anion in 3 can be derived from the [Sb6I22]4− isomer C. This double cube with antimony and iodine atoms occupying the twelve edges is connected to two [Sb2I10]4− units via common iodine atoms of the opposite small faces of the double cube. The decanuclear units are again connected by two bridging iodine atoms to form the polymeric chains shown in Fig. 7.

While a solution and refinement of the heavy atom structure is possible in P, the structure has to be solved in the non-centrosymmetric space group P1. The reason that this rare space group is observed here are the acetonitrile ligands coordinating the Cu(I) cation. When displaying them as the tetrahedral coordination sphere around the copper cation, it becomes clear that two different orientations of these tetrahedra are present and that these are incompatible with an inversion center, making a solution and refinement in P1 necessary (see ESI† for details). The different orientations of the [Cu(MeCN)4]+ tetrahedra and the pseudo-center of inversion are highlighted in Fig. 8.

Compound 4 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c as orange prisms. In contrast to compound 1 to 3, 4 was obtained at room temperature. As 3, it contains a chain-like anion, which shows a smaller repetition unit than 3. It can also be derived from the [Sb4I16]4− anion. Here, [Sb4I16]4− units are connected over two common iodine atoms, forming polymeric chains as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Excerpt of an anionic chain in 4 with the repeating unit highlighted in grey. 
The packing diagram of 4 reveals that the anionic chains arrange along the ab and bc plane of the unit cell, with two cations filling the voids between them. Similar to compound 2, the chains show different orientations reminiscent of a herringbone-like arrangement. Corresponding to the 1D extension of the anion, the cations also adopt a stacked structure in the unit cell. An excerpt of the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 10. Iodido antimonates featuring anionic chains of the same composition are known,30,49 yet a different mode of connection than in 4 is observed in these compounds, as shown in Fig. 11, where the chain motifs in [Me3NCH2Ph][Sb2I7] (Me3NCH2Ph = benzyltrimethylammonium)30 and 4 are compared.

Bond length and angles in 1–4 are within typical ranges (see ESI† for details). A closer look at the packing motifs of the [Cu(MeCN)4]+ units in 1–4 and [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2, shown in Fig. 12, reveals the great flexibility of the cation and thus at least a part of the reason why such a wide range of iodido antimonate motifs can be stabilized. The cations do not merely act as approximately spherical counterions, but can interlock in different ways, a phenomenon that has been studied quite deeply for the more prominently used tetraphenylphosphonium ions and related systems by Dance and coworkers.50

Discussion
Although often hard to catch, the occurrence of transient phases during synthesis, crystallization and transformation has been observed in various classes of materials.51 Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the work presented here represents the first example of such transient phases in the chemistry of single crystalline halogenido metalates, despite the fundamental role of intermediate and metastable phases during the synthesis and application of lead halide perovskite materials and devices.11 While unfortunately, the inclination of 1–4 towards rapid loss of solvent coupled with a comparatively long crystallization time has precluded us from performing detailed time-dependent powder X-ray diffraction studies either ex situ or in situ, a few observations can be made from the data at hand.
The reaction is initiated by dissolving the starting materials CuI and SbI3 in hot acetonitrile. The stoichiometry chosen here corresponds to the final product [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2 (Cu:Sb:I → 2:3:11 or CuI:SbI3 2:3). When the reaction solution is stored at −18 °C, the crystallization of two solvates, [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb6I22]·2 MeCN (1) and [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb7I25]·MeCN (2) is observed. 1 features the same composition as the reaction stoichiometry (CuI:SbI3 2:3), while 2 is more SbI3-rich (CuI:SbI3 2:3.5). The particular anion motifs found in these two compounds are unprecedented in the chemistry of halogenido antimonates, but molecular anions with nuclearities between two and eight are fairly common, suggesting that they are either present in solution or can rapidly assemble upon crystallization overriding the typically observed templating effects of the cations and leading to the crystallization of, in our case metastable, solvates.34
When the reaction is allowed to continue at −18 °C or conducted at room temperature, crystallization of [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb10I34] (3) at the cost of 1 and 2 or direct crystallization of [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb8I28] (4) are observed. Both 3 and 4 feature comparatively large chain-like anions that ostensibly take longer to assemble upon crystallization and both are SbI3-rich with respect to the reaction stoichiometry (CuI:SbI3 2:5 for 3 and 2:4 for 4) providing an additional driving force towards further reaction. Independent of the reaction pathway, the sole and final product over the course of several days is the literature-known [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2, forming as thick hexagonal plates.
The question is of course, why does this compound not form immediately upon cooling the reaction solution? We suggest that the condensed anion motif [Sb3I11]2− forms only very slowly. Most halogenido pentelates can be assembled, at least conceptually, by adding either EX3 or X− to the basic building unit [EX6]3−. [Sb3I11]2− cannot be formed this way, instead requiring the formation of the rare penta-coordinate building block [E2X8]2−,28 and an addition of EX3 with significant reorganization or an addition-elimination mechanism when adding EX3 to [E2X9]3−. Interestingly, the lone example of a iodido bismuthate with the same anion motif, [M(1,10-Phenanthroline)3][Bi3I11] (M = Co, Fe, Zn) is also obtained after long reaction times of more than five days, in this case at elevated temperatures.52
Such simplistic deliberations are, of course, going to miss complexities that are bound to exist in the solution chemistry of the halogenido pentelates, which has so far remained poorly understood due to the lack of analytical access. Yet, they may help to explain our findings here and point toward a richer chemistry, controlled by kinetics as well as thermodynamics, in the synthesis of new members of this class of materials.
Conclusions
We have isolated four new, transient iodido antimonates [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb6I22]·2MeCN (1), [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb7I25]·MeCN (2), [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb10I34] (3) and [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb8I28] (4), during the synthesis [Cu(MeCN)4]4[Sb3I11]2, a compound described by Pohl nearly 30 years ago. The transient compounds feature complex, previously unknown anion motifs, broadening the structural chemistry of the halogenido pentelates. Our results highlight the importance of kinetics in the field of halogenido metalates and suggest that more new compounds may be found en route to those already known. This may allow new insights into the complex reaction kinetics of halogenido metalates.
