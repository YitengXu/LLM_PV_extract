    , Accepted 25th April 2016First published on 26th April 2016AbstractDespite the potential of ZnO as the electron collection material for low-temperature processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs), previous investigations revealed that the CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite rapidly decomposes on ZnO at elevated temperature through a deprotonation process (base-induced reaction) that reduces thermal stability. To solve this thermal instability issue and to further enhance the photovoltaic performance, we employed a (FA)-based perovskite, i.e., FAPbI3 as the light absorber in ZnO-based PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the investigated FAPbI3 solar cells was clearly dependent on both the pre-heating of the PbI2 precursor and post-annealing of the FAPbI3 film in the solar cell fabrication procedure. The highest power conversion efficiency of up to 16.1% was achieved under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination, in which the pre-heating and post-annealing temperatures were 100 °C and 145 °C, respectively. Importantly, the thermostability of the perovskite film on ZnO was substantially improved with FAPbI3 owing to basically the robust nature of FA compared with methylammonium (MA) in CH3NH3PbI3. Moreover, FAPbI3-based PSCs exhibited excellent photostability and small J–V hysteresis, which are all useful characteristics for further commercialization of low-temperature processed ZnO solar cells.
1. Introduction
Research in the area of solution-processable solar cells has led to substantial progress in the development of both organic and hybrid photovoltaic devices, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now routinely approaching or exceeding 10%.1–5 Particularly, the use of organometallic halide perovskite materials as light absorbers has been established as a leading technology in high performance thin film solar cells because of their rapidly boosted power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and scalable processability.6–10
In the perovskite solar cell (PSC) device architectures, an electron transporting layer (ETL) plays a significant role in rectifying the photocurrent generated in the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination.12–15,32 Early PSCs were mainly based on a mesoporous titanium dioxide scaffold as ETL because titanium dioxide has been the best ETL employed in traditional dye-sensitized solar cells.9,24 Nonetheless, these TiO2 layers generally require sintering at 500–550 °C for preparation, which has significantly restricted the applications of PSCs in flexible and wearable electronics.5 In contrast, PSCs based on low-temperature processable metal oxide ETL materials such as ZnO, SnO2, TiOx, and WOx have recently been investigated.11–15 Among metal oxide ETLs, ZnO is the most promising owing to its high transparency, suitable work function, high electron mobility and structural tailorability at a nanoscale level. Currently, the highest PCEs of up to 14–16% have been achieved for purely ZnO-based PSCs,5,10 although they can be further improved by modification of ZnO with other ECLs, such as PFN, TiO2, and SnO2.12,16,17
Despite the good processability and physical properties of ZnO, the thermal instability of the CH3NH3PbI3-based ZnO solar cells is a more severe issue to limit further applications of such devices. This thermal instability of CH3NH3PbI3 on ZnO was attributed to the remaining hydroxyl groups and/or residual acetate ligands on the ZnO surface to accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite absorber; this is obviously related to the basic nature of ZnO that can undergo acid–base reaction with CH3NH3PbI3.18,19 Previous investigations suggest that PbI2 residues in the perovskite films prepared by a two-step process with the solvent thermal annealing method may partially improve the stability of the ZnO-based PSCs;12,13 however, further attempts to fabricate thermally stable ZnO-based PSCs are still imperative and remain challenging.
Formamidinium (HNCHNH3+, FA+) is known as a major alternative of methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA+), forming the three-dimensional (3D) structured organolead halide perovskite absorbers.20 Compared with MA+, FA+ as the organic cation not only provides a higher symmetrical perovskite structure with a decreased band gap of ∼1.48 eV, but also makes the perovskite more compatible with ZnO owing to the increased difficulty of the deprotonation process.23–26 Despite the advantages of FA+, PSCs especially with planar heterojunction structures were less investigated, because the large cation size of FA+ often results in incomplete formation of perovskite structure and formation of a uniform perovskite film is difficult. Thus, FAPbI3-based PSCs so far mainly employ porous TiO2 ETLs with PCEs up to 16%.20–27
In this investigation, we prepared ZnO thin films by spin-coating of nanoparticles as ETLs to fabricate low-temperature-processed PSCs, and employed HC(NH2)2+ instead of CH3NH3+ to synthesize the perovskite light-harvester. A previously reported two-step sequential deposition technique with the solvent-vapor annealed PbI2 precursor was employed to grow an FAPbI3 active layer.13 Intriguingly, we observed the dependence of both the grain morphology and absorption of the as-deposited FAPbI3 films on the annealing temperature. Consequently, the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI3-based PSCs was found to be sensitive to the post-annealing temperature. In addition, we observed that the preheating of the PbI2 layers prior to immersion in FAI solution was another factor to facilitate the reaction between PbI2 and FAI. Upon optimization, the ZnO–FAPbI3 planar structure demonstrates a PCE as high as 16.1% with an average PCE of 15.7% ± 0.3%. The thermostability of FAPbI3 and the photostability of FAPbI3-based PSCs are found to be superior to MAPbI3-based ones. Moreover, little J–V hysteresis is an additional benefit for the ZnO-based FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
ZnO (ZnO-350, Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co.)29 nanoparticles were used as received. Lead iodide (beads, 10 mesh, 99.999% trace metals basis) and lithium salts (>99.0%) were purchased from Aldrich. CH3NH3I (>99.0%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Co. (PLT). HC(NH2)2I (>98.0%) was purchased from TCI. Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, >99.0%) was purchased from Merck. Ultradry solvents of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, >99.9%) and isopropanol (>99.9%) were obtained from J&K and Acros, respectively. All the chemicals and solvents were kept in the glove-box before starting our experiment.
2.2 Device fabrication
The pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol in sequence. ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in butanol at a concentration of 6 mg mL−1 and stirred for 3 hours before use. The solution was filtered with a PVDF hydrophobic 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated on ITO substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s to form a relatively compact ZnO thin layer followed by short baking at 150 °C for 5 min. This procedure was repeated three times before finally baking at 200 °C for 1 hour. A 460 mg mL−1 solution of PbI2 in DMF was then spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s in the glove-box. The PbI2-coated ZnO thin film was immediately placed in a covered Petri dish for the SVA process for about 5 minutes followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. The films were preheated at 100 °C for 3 min before dipping into a FAI 2-propanol solution (10 mg mL−1) for 50 s followed by annealing at 145 °C for 15 min to obtain the desired crystallite formation. As the hole-transporting material (HTM), a spiro-OMeTAD solution (80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 10.5 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 46.5 μL of a lithium-bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (170 mg Li-TFSI/1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL chlorobenzene) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s on FAPbI3. The substrates with HTM were left overnight in dry air in the dark at room temperature. Finally, a 60 nm thick Ag electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the HTM to produce a completed PSC device.
2.3 Device characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of solar cells were measured by a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM 1.5G filter at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as determined by a standard silicon reference cell (91150 V Oriel Instruments). The effective area of the cell was defined to be 0.04 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. IPCE spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial IPCE setup (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD), which was equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, filter wheel, and monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents were measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated against a certified silicon reference diode. The impedance spectroscopy measurement was carried out by a VSP multichannel potentiostatic–galvanostatic system (Biologic, France), under dark conditions by applying a 5 mV voltage perturbation with the frequency ranging between 1 MHz and 0.1 Hz. The Z-View Analyst software was used to model the Nyquist plots obtained from the impedance measurements.
2.4 Thin film characterization
Film thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) spectra were obtained on a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 980), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-375). A Hamamatsu C5680-04 streak camera was used for TrPL. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at room temperature. The data were collected with a 0.01° step size (2θ). A field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8020) was used to acquire SEM images.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the PSC device configuration and the energy alignment of each component in the PSC devices.5,25 ZnO and spiro-OMeTAD were used as the electron and hole selective contacts, respectively. The ZnO thin films were prepared by spin-coating of the ZnO nanoparticles through a PVDF filter with an average pore size of 0.45 μm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZnO nanoparticles used in this investigation has been reported in the previous investigation.12 Additionally, the high magnification scanning electron microscope (SEM) surface image of the ZnO thin film is shown in Fig. S1.† The ZnO film is found to be ∼20 nm thick, and flat and dense in morphology, suggesting that the corresponding PSCs are based on the planar-heterojunction configuration.

In the previous report, we have established the method, in which, the grain size and porosity of the PbI2 layer could be controlled by varying the time of the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process.13 In the present investigation, to promote the infiltration of the relatively large size HC(NH2)2I (FAI) into the PbI2 layer for a complete formation of the perovskite film, we again employed the SVA and two-step sequential deposition methods in the preparation of PbI2 and FAPbI3 films, respectively. Besides, it was mentioned previously that the solvo-reaction between PbI2 and organic halide could be facilitated by dipping the hot PbI2 film into the organic halide solution.30,31
According to the previous report, as-prepared FAPbI3 films can complete crystallization in 15 min at a suitable annealing temperature.24 Hence, we also investigated the effect of the annealing temperature of the FAPbI3 layer on the photovoltaic performance in ZnO-based PSCs. Fig. 2 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of FAPbI3-based ZnO solar cells with different FAPbI3 annealing temperatures. Table 1 lists the related photovoltaic parameters obtained from the J–V curves. Amongst the annealing temperatures employed here, 145 °C gives the highest PCE of 15% calculated from a photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.5 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V and a fill factor (FF) of 68.5%. A slightly decreased/increased annealing temperature at 135 °C/150 °C causes a significant drop-down in PCE. The annealing effect was obviously overturned after 145 °C, because decoloring of the FAPbI3 film was observed at elevated temperatures from 145 °C to 150 °C.

To further understand the origin of this annealing effect on the photovoltaic performance, we measured, as shown in Fig. S2,† the absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FAPbI3 films prepared at different annealing temperatures. As the annealing temperature increases from 135 °C to 150 °C, the absorbance of the perovskite films decreases gradually together with the increase of the intensity of the XRD peak of PbI2 at 2θ = 12.68°, those facts both reflecting the decomposition of perovskite films at high annealing temperatures of above 135 °C. However, the XRD signals of FAPbI3 at 13.92°, 24.26°, 28.04° and 31.42° indexed to (110), (202), (220) and (222) reflections, respectively, are quite identical for each annealing temperature.22,28 It was reported that the formation of the yellow polymorph might be one of the reasons to limit the performance of FA-based PSCs.24,38 To investigate whether the yellow polymorph of the FAPbI3 absorber was present in our PSCs, we employed XRD analysis on the FAPbI3 films annealed at the investigated temperatures. As shown in Fig. S3,† the appearance of the yellow polymorph denoted with octothorpes can coexist with the black polymorph at the annealing temperature of 100 °C. The XRD signal of the yellow polymorph disappears with further elevating the annealing temperature to 135–150 °C. Thus, SEM images were obtained (Fig. 3) to differentiate the morphological feature of each FAPbI3 perovskite film. The quality of the perovskite film annealed at 135 °C is inferior; the grain size is relatively small and the surface is rough. As the annealing temperature increases to 145 °C, the crystalline grain becomes denser and larger resulting in a reduced number of grain boundaries, which are the main reason to cause charge recombination.32 In addition, the flat surface can avoid excitation quenching through the interfacial trap states. Further increasing the annealing temperature to 150 °C causes damage to the crystalline grain and grain boundary resulting in deteriorated performance as supported by the reduced intensity in the absorption spectrum and XRD.
 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of ITO/ZnO/FAPbI3 thin films with different annealing temperatures: (a) 135 °C, (b) 145 °C, and (c) 150 °C. The PbI2 layers were preheated at 70 °C for 3 min prior to dipping. 
The above SEM images further suggest that the morphology of the FAPbI3 film might be dependent on the ETL by a comparison of the morphology of FAPbI3 on ZnO to that of the previous reports on TiO2.20–24 To confirm this, the SEM images of perovskite films prepared under the same conditions on compact TiO2 were also measured and shown in Fig. S4.† Obviously, the optimal annealing temperature of FAPbI3 on ZnO, i.e., 145 °C, is not enough for producing FAPbI3 with large grain size and flat surface. Thus, we further increased the annealing temperature to 165 °C and even to 185 °C. With these higher annealing temperatures, the grain size of FAPbI3 is growing larger but without good uniformity and flatness. We therefore conclude that ZnO is a better ETL than TiO2 for producing FAPbI3 with large grain size and uniformity at a low temperature.
Not only the post-annealing process, but the preheating of the PbI2 layer prior to the dipping into FAI may also play a crucial role in determining the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI3-based solar cells, because hot PbI2 would facilitate the thermal dynamic reaction with FAI in solution. Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics measured from the reversed voltage scan of PSCs fabricated from PbI2 preheated at different temperatures, namely room temperature (RT), 70 °C, 100 °C, and 130 °C. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The increased Jsc value with increased preheating temperature is attributable to better conversion of PbI2 into perovskite. The Voc value is more or less similar. For the FF value, it reaches a maximum value with a 100 °C preheating. As the result of the varied Jsc, Voc and FF values, the average PCE of 15.5 ± 0.3% was achieved for the devices with the PbI2 layer preheated at an optimal temperature of 100 °C. Fig. S5† shows a typical cross-sectional SEM image of a perovskite solar cell device in which the pre-heating and post-annealing temperatures were 100 °C and 145 °C, respectively.

We also investigated in Fig. S6† the effect of preheating on the absorption spectra (a) and XRD patterns (b)–(d) of the FAPbI3 films. The fact that the absorbance of FAPbI3 films increases with increased preheating temperature is basically consistent with the Jsc value of corresponding devices. Fig. S6b and c† show the XRD signal at 2θ = 12.70° for PbI2 crystallites before and after immersion into FAI, respectively. Obviously, the increased preheating temperature not only decreases the intensity of the PbI2 reflection signal but roughly also increases the FAPbI3 XRD intensity at 2θ = 24.2° in Fig. S6d.† These coincident variations in the absorption and XRD intensities of PbI2 and FAPbI3 films suggest that the preheating of the PbI2 film facilitates the formation of FAPbI3.
The SVA and preheating of PbI2 films can routinely influence the morphology of perovskite crystallite grains. In Fig. 5, we measured the SEM surface images of the perovskite films obtained from PbI2 layers with different preheating temperatures. Noticeably, the preheating procedure has an effect on the average grain diameter of the perovskite crystals without affecting the surface roughness. The change in the grain size is particularly significant between PbI2 without and with preheating at a temperature of more than 100 °C. The grain size distribution for FAPbI3 corresponding to the preheating temperature of 100 °C is summarized in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† The average grain size of 390 nm obtained from the surface are even greater than the average film thickness (230 ± 10 nm) for the FAPbI3 film on ZnO. The large and densely packed crystalline grains must be beneficial in reducing the energy loss and charge recombination at grain boundaries over the photophysical processes of the PSCs.32 In contrast, we observed that this preheating treatment of PbI2 reduces the photovoltaic performance of the MAPbI3-based PSCs. Fig. S8 and Table S1 in the ESI† show respectively the J–V characteristics and related parameters of the MAPbI3-based PSCs without and with the preheating of PbI2 layers at 100 °C. Fig. S9† shows the SEM morphology characterization of corresponding MAPbI3 films. Although the average grain size of MAPbI3 crystallites is remarkably increased with preheating, the resultant rough surface and incompactness might induce more spaces for a direct contact between ZnO and hole-transporter to cause much serious charge recombination.

In order to better investigate the effect of preheating on the interfacial dynamics of the FAPbI3-based PSCs, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark at the open circuit potential on the devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. Fig. 6a shows the Nyquist plots of the corresponding PSCs prepared from PbI2 with different preheating temperatures. The Nyquist plot is composed of two irregular arcs, i.e., a small arc at high frequency and a large arc at low frequency.12Fig. 6d shows the equivalent circuit model that we employed to fit the EIS results by following the previous investigation.33 Here, the high-frequency feature is ascribed to the contact resistance (Rco) associated with the ZnO/FAPbI3 and FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces. An expanded view of the Nyquist plot at the high-frequency region is shown in Fig. 6b. In addition, the values at the starting part of the Nyquist plot correspond to the series resistance (Rs).39,40 The Rs is related to the resistance including that of external wires, the substrates and other additional contributions; the ETL also has an effect on Rs according to the report by Wang et al.15,39Fig. 6c shows the expanded view of the Nyquist plot at the starting part which is marked by red circles in Fig. 6b. The resistance values obtained from fitting of the equivalent circuit are tabulated in Table S2.† For each of these Rs and Rco parameters obtained from different preheating temperatures, the resistance values always follow the same order, i.e., RT > 70 °C > 100 °C > 130 °C. As the preheating temperature is increased, the device gives the reduced resistance values indicating that charge extraction becomes more efficient at the ZnO/FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces.33 Moreover, the lower Rs and Rco values must jointly contribute to the high Jsc value of PSCs.12 The span or diameter of the second arc corresponding to the lower frequency element reflects the resistance of charge recombination (Rrec).15 The Rrec value is the highest for the 100 °C preheated device, suggesting that the charge recombination is unfavorable between ZnO/FAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, the highest FF value of PSC with 100 °C could be mainly attributed to the suppressed charge recombination between interfaces with a concomitantly low Rs. The 100 °C preheated devices yield the highest PCE values with the highest FF and fairly high value of Jsc.

It was previously reported that the MAPbI3 absorber underwent fast thermal degradation on the ZnO surface even at a relatively low temperature.18,19 Therefore, the exploration of alternative perovskite absorbers for ZnO-based PSCs is imperative. The thermal instability of MAPbI3 on ZnO is originated from the hydroxyl residues on ZnO that can cause decomposition of MAPbI3 through acid–base reaction. In view of this, FAPbI3 must be much more stable compared to MAPbI3 on ZnO, because FAI is affordable to the acid–base reaction which may attribute to the interplay between size effects and the statistically higher probability of forming hydrogen bonds of FA compared to MA in stabilizing pseudocubic structures.34Fig. 7 shows the photographs of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 films on ZnO before and after the thermal treatment at 145 °C, respectively. Before the thermal treatment, all perovskite films showed the same black color. With merely 3 min thermal treatment, the color of the MAPbI3 film already turns yellow, whereas that of the FAPbI3 film remains black. Further extension of this heating process to 15 min makes the MAPbI3 film completely yellow indicating a complete decomposition of perovskite into PbI2. Surprisingly, the FAPbI3 film still looks as it used to be. Fig. 8 shows the FT-IR spectra of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 films on ZnO before and after the thermal treatment at 145 °C for 15 min. Compared with FAPbI3 films that exhibit basically identical IR spectrum before and after the thermal treatment, the MAPbI3 film after the thermal treatment shows a IR pattern same as that of the pure PbI2 film. Given that the MAI-based perovskite is unstable at temperatures above 120 °C, we also examined the thermal stability of both MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 films on ZnO at 110 °C. As shown in Fig. S10,† despite the slower decomposition speed as compared with 145 °C, the MAPbI3 film decomposes into almost pure PbI2 within 15 min, whereas the FAPbI3 film remains unchanged. Indeed, the excellent thermal stability of FAPbI3 on ZnO gives the highly efficient FAPbI3-based PSCs an additional benefit for future real-world applications.

The charge extraction dynamics of FAPbI3 by ZnO as an important parameter to determine the photovoltaic performance remains a mystery to be explored. We therefore employed time resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) spectroscopy to study the charge extraction dynamics. Fig. 9 shows the decay dynamics of TrPL spectra for MAPbI3/ZnO, FAPbI3/ZnO and FAPbI3/TiO2 samples. We fitted the PL lifetime (τ) of the perovskite/ETL films with a bi-exponential decay model. The larger time constant τ2 of the two time constants obtained from the exponential fitting was used to plot the lifetime of perovskite photo-carriers.35 As the result of the fitting, the τ2 values for MAPbI3/ZnO, FAPbI3/ZnO and FAPbI3/TiO2 samples are 84 ns, 235 ns, and 276 ns, respectively. Despite the presence of ZnO, the longer carrier lifetime of FAPbI3 compared with MAPbI3 will certainly increase the concentration of charge carriers involved in the charge extraction, which may originate from both the higher symmetric cubic structure and the reduced number of grain boundaries in the FAPbI3 perovskite layer.36 Moreover, the PL decay of the FAPbI3 on ZnO ETL displayed a faster rate than that based on TiO2, which suggests that the photoinduced electrons in perovskite could be more efficiently extracted by ZnO.15 Here, higher mobility would reduce the effects of space charge, and probably enhance the extraction of generated free charge carriers by transferring an electron to the underlying ZnO layer.35 That explains why ZnO shows a higher quenching efficiency by virtue of the higher mobility.

As shown in Fig. 10a, the champion device exhibits a PCE of 16.1% deduced by a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 20.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.713 by preheating the PbI2 film at 100 °C and post-annealing the FAPbI3 film at 145 °C. The calculated photocurrent from the IPCE spectrum in Fig. 10b at 19.6 mA cm−2 is consistent with the measured Jsc value. More details about the photovoltaic parameters and the mean values with standard deviations of the PSCs are shown in Table S3.† In order to verify the reliability of the results, we further fabricated the devices with a larger aperture area of 0.09 cm2, and obtained the PCE of up to 15.8% (see Fig. S11 and Table S4†), which is consistent with the values we obtained for PSCs with a 0.04 cm2 aperture area. In addition, the FAPbI3-based PSC exhibits smaller J–V hysteresis between the forward (from Jsc to Voc) and reversed (from Voc to Jsc) scans (Fig. S12b, Table S5†), as compared to MAPbI3-based PSCs in our previous report.11 In fact, the origin of the J–V hysteresis in PSCs was partially attributable to the reorientation of the permanent dipole of the organic cations in the perovskite structure.24 The smaller J–V hysteresis in FAPbI3-based PSCs compared to that in MAPbI3-based PSCs indicates that the reorientation energy of the permanent dipole for FAI+ is larger than that for MAI+. In addition, we compared the hysteresis behaviors in the J–V curves of solar cells post-annealed at 135 °C, 145 °C and 150 °C, respectively, in Fig. S12 (Table S5† shows the corresponding parameters). The FAPbI3-based PSC prepared at 135 °C annealing temperature exhibits the largest hysteresis among the three solar cells. The fact that the hysteresis degree coincides with the grain size and quality of the FAPbI3 films (Fig. 3) suggests that the hysteresis behavior is somehow partially determined by carrier/ion diffusion/migration in the perovskite layer. Of particular note is that the best Voc attained in the FAPbI3-based PSCs at 1.09 V is greater than the best MAPbI3-based PSC at 1.07 V, when ZnO was employed as the ETL.12 It has been documented that the band-gap of MAPbI3 is ca. 0.09 eV larger than that of FAPbI3.25 The higher Voc value of PSCs based on FAPbI3 compared with that based on MAPbI3 is attributable to the long carrier lifetime in the former than the latter, as the charge recombination dynamics depend on the carrier lifetime of perovskite absorbers in the opposite manner.25 To gain some understanding of the stabilized power output under the working conditions, the photocurrent of the devices close to the maximum power point was measured as a function of time in Fig. 10c.37 The photocurrent measured at 0.85 V slightly increased from the initial 18.2 mA cm−2 to a stabilized value of 18.5 mA cm−2 after tens of second illumination, resulting in an increased stabilized PCE of 15.7% for the device. The short ON–OFF relaxation time and repeatable ON–OFF performance demonstrated that the devices have good working-stability.12,37Fig. 10d shows the photo-stability results of the devices under simulated sunlight illumination. The PCEs of PSC devices based on MAPbI3 decreased significantly under the simulated sunlight illumination within 8 h, whereas those for the FAPbI3-based devices decreased more gently.26 This advantage in photo-stability of the FAPbI3-based PSCs is promising in practical stability of the device as a solar cell in the industrial applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells based on low-temperature-processed ZnO as the electron transport layer. The annealing temperature of the as-deposited FAPbI3 was found to be critical to photovoltaic performance. The FAPbI3 formed at 145 °C for 15 min showed compact and sizable crystalline grains with small surface roughness resulting in the best photovoltaic performance among the different annealing temperatures. The preheating process of the PbI2 layer was also found to be a key factor to determine the photovoltaic performance by promoting the growth of perovskite crystals. A champion device with the PCE of 16.1% was achieved for the ZnO–FAPbI3 PSCs. FAPbI3-based PSCs show superior thermo- and photo-stabilities than the MAPbI3-based control devices. Moreover, the small J–V hysteresis in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells is an additional merit. Given that FAPbI3-based ZnO PSCs hold all the above merits as a photovoltaic device, they deserve to be a promising new candidate to solve renewable energy issues in the future.
