    , Accepted 12th December 2018First published on 12th December 2018AbstractElectrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid or formate is desirable but challenging due to the lack of effective and selective electrocatalysts. Among the potential candidates, Sn-based materials have attracted wide attention, but most of them, unfortunately, do not achieve high formate selectivity until at very large overpotentials. Herein, we report the self-templated synthesis of mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets as the high-performance electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The final product features large surface area, abundant mesoporosity and three-dimensional hierarchical order, which are beneficial for electrochemical applications. When evaluated as the CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets exhibit small onset potential, large cathodic current density, high faradaic efficiency and great stability for formate production. It is most impressive that a high formate faradaic efficiency of 83% is achieved at η ∼ 710 mV, about 150–300 mV less than that discussed in previous literature results. Moreover, we integrate mesoporous SnO2 with a dimensionally stable anode, and achieve battery-driven CO2/H2O splitting to formate/O2 with decent conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Effective CO2 capture and utilization is considered as one of the key challenges to mitigate the increasing atmospheric CO2 level and steer towards a more sustainable future.1,2 In this regard, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) which converts CO2 to useful chemical fuels is appealing, particularly when it is powered by off-peak electricity or renewable energy such as solar or wind.3–8 However, the industrial success of this technology is contingent upon the development of high-performance CO2RR electrocatalysts. Despite the encouraging progress made over the last decade, there is still a lack of non-precious metal-based materials that can simultaneously meet the requirements of reaction activity, selectivity and stability.3–6,9,10 This is because CO2 is an inert molecule, and the breaking of its CO double bond is kinetically hindered.11 Moreover, its selectivity is often limited due to the competing hydrogen evolution process and the complex reaction pathways giving rise to a multitude of possible products.12 Formic acid or formate is a common product from CO2 reduction.13,14 Compared to gaseous products such as CO and CH4, it is more conducive to transport and storage. Formate is also an important chemical intermediate with considerable industrial demand and a renewable energy carrier with high technical feasibility.15,16 Since the pioneering work by Hori and co-workers in the 1980s, several different post-transition metals including Sn, Pb, Hg, In and Cd have been investigated for reducing CO2 to formate.17–19 Among these candidates, Sn-based materials come to the fore and attract the most attention due to their lower toxicity (compared to Pb, Hg and Cd) and lower cost (compared to In).4–6,20,21 Many studies have been carried out to design and engineer their nanostructures for enhanced catalytic performance.22–25 For example, Meyer et al. demonstrated that SnO2 nanocrystals from a facile hydrothermal method could reduce CO2 to formate at overpotentials as low as ∼340 mV and with a faradaic efficiency up to ∼93%;22 Xie et al. reported that Sn quantum sheets confined within graphene exhibited a current density of 21 mA cm−2, a formate faradaic efficiency of 89% and stability for 50 h at −1.8 V versus a saturated calomel electrode;23 Spurgeon et al. showed that electrochemically reduced SnO2 porous nanowires had enriched grain boundaries, and could enable CO2 reduction to formate with a current density of ∼10 mA cm−2 and formate faradaic efficiency of 78% at −1.0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode.24 Unfortunately, it should be noted that most Sn-based electrocatalysts currently available do not achieve high formate selectivity until at very large overpotentials (peak selectivity 50–90% usually at η ∼ 1 V).21–26 It remains obscure how to promote the reaction selectivity, especially at low-to-moderate overpotentials via proper composition and structure engineering.
Herein, we demonstrate the self-templated synthesis of mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets from the oxidative conversion of hierarchical SnS2 nanosheets. The final product features large surface area and abundant mesoporosity, while preserving the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure. It exhibits great activity, selectivity and stability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the two-step synthetic procedure toward mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets (mp-SnO2).27,28 It started with the preparation of hierarchical SnS2 nanosheets. SnCl2 and L-cysteine were first dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and solvothermally reacted at 180 °C for 6 h. The solid product was collected and subjected to structural characterization. Its X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern displays diffraction peaks assignable to layered 2H-type SnS2 free of any impurity (Fig. 2a). Based on Scherrer equation analysis of the (001) peak, we estimate its average thickness to be ∼11 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement reveals pronounced Sn (with the 3d5/2 peak centered at 486.0 eV) and S (with the 2p peak centered at 161.1 eV) signals, in good agreement with the established result for SnS2 (Fig. S1†).29 A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that SnS2 has a nanosheet morphology (Fig. 2b). Individual nanosheets are approximately 1 μm wide and appear translucent under the electron beam because of their small thickness. These nanosheets are often curved or wrinkled, and extensively interconnected to form a 3D hierarchical network. Fig. 2c depicts a typical Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) image of a SnS2 nanosheet. Its basal plane has an even contrast indicative of uniform thickness. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern exhibits six-fold diffraction spots along the [001] zone axis, which is evidence that each nanosheet is single-crystalline with its thickness along the c-direction. Moreover, a high-resolution TEM image unveils clear lattice fringes from the (100) plane (Fig. 2d).

During the second step, SnS2 nanosheets were calcined in air at 500 °C for their templated conversion to mp-SnO2. The XRD pattern of the final product only exhibits diffraction peaks from SnO2 (Fig. 2a). In addition to the composition change, it is worth noting that each diffraction peak becomes substantially broadened, signaling smaller structural feature sizes after the conversion. Scherrer equation analysis of the (110) peak, for example, suggests an average particle size of ∼9 nm. XPS analysis shows that the S signal completely vanishes and an intense O signal appears (Fig. S1†). The Sn doublet is displaced by ∼0.8 eV toward higher binding energy, in accordance with the formation of SnO2.22 Furthermore, the influence of the oxidative conversion on the microstructure is investigated by SEM and TEM. It is found that the overall 3D hierarchical structure is maintained after the conversion (Fig. 2e, f), whereas the original single-crystalline nanosheets are fragmented into numerous small nanoparticles about 10–20 nm in size (Fig. 2g, h). The nanosheet fragmentation is reasonably expected since the conversion from SnS2 to SnO2 involves a substantial volume contraction. However, it is remarkable that the nanosheets do not become pulverized, and the overall structural integrity is preserved. As a result, the oxidative conversion from SnS2 to SnO2 is considered as self-templating. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement of mp-SnO2 suggests that their specific surface area is 81.4 m2 g−1 and total pore volume is 0.15 cm3 g−1 (Fig. S2†) – both values are significant given the heavy density of SnO2. The corresponding pore size distribution curve shows a broad size distribution between 5 and 20 nm. In light of their large surface area, abundant mesoporosity and 3D hierarchical order, we believe that our mp-SnO2 are an ideal material for electrochemical applications.
Next, we carefully investigated the performance of mp-SnO2 for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in 0.5 M NaHCO3. Commercial Sn foil was used as the control sample for side-by-side comparison. We first recorded their linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Fig. 3a). The broad cathodic wave observed at ∼−0.2 V (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode or RHE) is assignable to the reduction of SnO2 to metallic Sn. The CO2RR cathodic current density of mp-SnO2 starts to accelerate at the range of −0.5 to −0.6 V, and then rapidly rises to 25 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V. Sn foil has a more negative onset potential, and its current density reaches only 10 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V. In order to quantitatively analyze the CO2RR product, chronoamperometric electrolysis at a few selected potentials in the range of −0.5 V to −1.1 V was carried out. The corresponding current density responses were collected, and were all found to quickly stabilize (Fig. 3b). The gas composition in the headspace was periodically measured using a gas chromatograph (GC) connected to the electrochemical cell; liquid reduction products were collected at the end of electrolysis and analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ion chromatography (IC). We conclude that formate is the major reduction product, together with minor amounts of H2 and CO. Their potential-dependent faradaic efficiency is plotted in Fig. 3c. Formate is first reliably detected on mp-SnO2 at −0.51 V with a faradaic efficiency of 9%. This potential translates to an overpotential of 320 mV, considerably lower than that of other Sn-based CO2RR electrocatalysts.21–23,25,26,30 Since the onset, the formate faradaic efficiency gradually increased, reached a maximum value of 83% at −0.90 V (η = 710 mV), and then slowly decreased to ∼54% at −1.13 V. This volcano-shaped potential dependence is generally consistent with that in previous reports.21–24,26 However, we want to highlight that our mp-SnO2 have much improved formate selectivity at low-to-medium overpotentials and their peak faradaic efficiency is achieved about 150–300 mV earlier than that for most literature results (Fig. 3d).23–26,30 For instance, to reach the equivalent formate faradaic efficiency, two state-of-the-art electrocatalysts – metallic Sn quantum sheets confined within graphene as reported by Xie and high surface area SnO2 nanocrystals as reported by Meyer – required η = 967 mV and η = 957 mV, respectively.22,23 On the other hand, the CO and H2 faradaic efficiencies of mp-SnO2 show different trends: the former peaks at −0.59 V with a value of 31%, and then gradually declines to zero with the increasing overpotential; the latter remains negligible until at potentials more negative than −0.90 V (Fig. 3c). Under the same experimental conditions, Sn foil has a much inferior formate selectivity, with its peak faradaic efficiency of 45% recorded at −1.12 V. Significantly more H2 is detected (Fig. S3†). Of note, our control experiment shows no formate production under N2, thereby confirming that it originates from CO2 reduction and not from other carbon sources (Fig. S4†).

(a) LSV curves of mp-SnO2 and commercial Sn foil in N2- and CO2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3; (b) change of total current density with time on mp-SnO2 in CO2-saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 at different potentials; (c) faradaic efficiencies of HCOO−, CO and H2 at different potentials on mp-SnO2 compared with the faradaic efficiency of HCOO− on commercial Sn foil; (d) comparison of the formate faradaic efficiency on mp-SnO2 with that on other Sn-based materials; (e) potential-dependent formate partial current density on mp-SnO2 and commercial Sn foil; (f) stability measurement of mp-SnO2 at η = 630 mV for 12 h. 
Furthermore, the formate partial current densities of mp-SnO2 and Sn foil are derived and compared by multiplying the corresponding total current density from Fig. 3b and formate faradaic efficiency from Fig. 3c at each potential. mp-SnO2 exhibit 2–5 times higher formate partial current density than Sn foil between −0.7 and −1.1 V (Fig. 3e). They deliver a maximum value of 16 mA cm−2, whereas the value for the latter does not exceed 8 mA cm−2. The measured formate partial current density of mp-SnO2 is also larger than that of many other formate-producing CO2RR electrocatalysts in aqueous solution.22,24,31–35 We find that lower or higher calcination temperatures result in slightly inferior formate selectivity and partial current density (Fig. S5†). In addition, the as-prepared SnS2 is analyzed to have much worse CO2RR performance (Fig. S6†).
Other than high activity and selectivity, long-term operation stability is another important criterion in the selection of proper electrocatalysts. In our experiment, the stability assessment was conducted by biasing mp-SnO2 at −0.82 V (η = 630 mV) for 10 h. During the course of the assessment, its current density stabilizes around 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f). Product analysis at the end of electrolysis suggests that the average formate faradaic efficiency is ∼75%.
The above electrochemical experiments show the great activity, selectivity and stability of our mp-SnO2 for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate. Even though Sn is known to favor CO2 reduction to formate relative to CO or H2 production by stabilizing its reaction intermediate (OCHO*) as revealed from earlier computational studies,20,36 high formate selectivity (>80%) was not attainable until at η > 800 mV for most Sn-based materials, and their formate partial current density was often limited to <10 mA cm−2. Here, the large surface area, abundant mesoporosity and 3D hierarchical order of mp-SnO2 are believed to collectively contribute to their great CO2RR performance. They not only increase the density of electrochemically accessible active centers thereby creating under-coordinated sites or structural defects with unexpected activities, but also facilitate the rapid transport of reactants and dissipation of products. The advantages of small nanoparticle size and mesoporosity in the CO2RR have also been documented in the literature. Meyer et al. believed that smaller (3–10 nm) SnO2 nanoparticles had a more suitable binding strength toward the CO2˙− intermediate, and hence higher formate selectivity.22 Spurgeon et al. suggested that mesoporous SnO2 had a high density of grain boundaries upon electrochemical reduction, which were believed to be highly active for CO2 reduction.24 In addition, Surendranath et al. recently demonstrated that mesopores may selectively inhibit the competing H2 evolution process by imposing diffusional limitations while preserving the high rates of the CO2RR.37
Encouraged by their great CO2RR performance, we went on to couple mp-SnO2 as the cathode with a commercially available dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and pursue full-cell CO2/H2O splitting (Fig. 4a). The DSA here consists of a thin IrO2 layer coated on Ti foil. It has been widely employed for the industrial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by virtue of its impressive activity and corrosion resistance. The OER activity of the DSA is first separately evaluated using a three-electrode configuration (Fig. 4b). Its anodic current density is observed to accelerate at 1.6 V and reach 10 mA cm−2 at 1.87 V in 0.5 M NaHCO3. Fig. 4c represents the non-iR-compensated polarization curve of the mp-SnO2/DSA full cell. The CO2RR–OER reaction couple becomes active at ∼2.1 V, and is capable of sustaining a current density of 7.3 mA cm−2 at 3.0 V (Fig. 4c). As a further step, we connected two AA-size alkaline batteries in series as the power source (with an open-circuit potential of ∼3 V) to drive the full-cell CO2/H2O splitting. The current density starts at 8 mA cm−2, slightly decreases initially, and then gradually levels off and stabilizes at ∼7.2 mA cm−2 till the end of the 6 h evaluation (Fig. 4d). Analysis of the reduction product shows that the average formate faradaic efficiency is ∼50%. This value is decent but not satisfactory because the actual working potential of the mp-SnO2 electrode is not sufficiently cathodic. The overall electricity-to-formate conversion efficiency is calculated to be ∼22%.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we reported a two-step, self-templated synthesis of mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate. Hierarchical SnS2 nanosheets with small thickness were first prepared by solvothermal reaction in NMP, and subsequently converted to mp-SnO2via air calcination. The final product exhibited large surface area and abundant mesoporosity, while surprisingly preserving the 3D hierarchical order. Such a unique structure increasingly exposed catalytically active sites at the surface, and thereby created under-coordinated sites or structural defects with unexpected activities. When assessed as the CO2RR electrocatalyst in 0.5 M NaHCO3, our mp-SnO2 exhibited small onset potential (∼320 mV), high formate faradaic efficiency (up to 83%), large formate partial current density (∼16 mA cm−2) and great stability. Most impressively, a high formate faradaic efficiency was achieved at η ∼ 710 mV, about 150–300 mV less than most previous results. In addition, we coupled mp-SnO2 with a commercially available DSA, and pursued battery-driven full cell CO2RR-OER electrolysis. A decent overall electricity-to-formate conversion efficiency was measured. Our study demonstrates that the rational structural engineering of SnO2 can lead to much improved CO2RR performance.
4. Experimental methods
Synthesis of mp-SnO2
SnCl2 (189.6 mg) and L-cysteine (290.8 mg) were first dissolved in NMP (50 mL) under magnetic stirring for ∼3 h. The precursor solution was solvothermally reacted at 180 °C for 6 h to yield SnS2 nanosheets. The solid products were isolated, washed 2–3 times with water and ethanol, and lyophilized. Subsequently, the as-prepared SnS2 nanosheets were calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h for their conversion to mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets (mp-SnO2).
Structural characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer. The sample morphology was characterized using a Zeiss scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was performed on a FEI Tecnai F20. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on an SSI S-Probe XPS spectrometer. N2 sorption study was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 at 77 K up to 1 bar. Before measurement, the sample was degassed at 150 °C for 24 h.
Electrochemical measurements
mp-SnO2 (1 mg), Ketjenblack carbon (0.5 mg) and Nafion solution (5 wt%, 6 μL) were first dispersed in 250 μL of ethanol, and vigorously sonicated for 30–40 min to form a uniform catalyst ink. The working electrode was prepared by dropcasting the catalyst ink on a Teflon-treated carbon fiber paper to achieve a catalyst loading of 1 mg cm−2. CO2RR experiments were carried out using a standard three-electrode system in a custom-designed two-compartment electrochemical cell, with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a graphite rod as the counter electrode. The two compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion-117) to avoid the formate crossover. Before CO2RR measurement, the electrolyte was purged with CO2 until its saturation. During CO2RR measurement, the electrolyte was continuously bubbled with CO2 at 20 sccm to maintain the saturation. Polarization curves were recorded at 10 mV s−1. The potentials were compensated for the ohmic loss, and reported with respect to RHE. Gaseous products from the CO2RR were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B), and the liquid products were analyzed using an ion chromatograph (Dionex ICS-600). Details about the product analysis are available in our previous publications.10,38
The full-cell measurement was conducted in a two-electrode configuration with mp-SnO2 as the cathode and the dimensionally stable IrOx/Ti electrode as the anode. This full cell was powered by two AA-sized alkaline batteries connected in series. A 2461-digital source-meter (Keithley) was used to record the current density during the battery-driven electrolysis. For this part of the study, the voltage readings were non-iR-compensated.
