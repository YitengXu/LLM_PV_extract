    , Accepted 19th September 2017First published on 20th September 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting nanowires have recently been widely regarded as promising candidates for electric and optical applications due to their faster carrier separation and low charge recombination. Here, we reported organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting nanowires with photoconductive properties based on a one dimensional ABX3-type compound, (2-methylpiperidine)PbI3 (1). In 1, one dimensional infinite double chains are surrounded by protonated organic 2-methylpiperidine cations to form a quantum wire structure, which has been thought to be favorable for carrier transport. Furthermore, the prepared semiconducting nanowires of 1 display obvious photoconductive properties, which have been verified using I–V and time-dependent photoresponse measurements. All the results indicate that such semiconducting nanowires based on low dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid materials have potential photoelectric applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have recently attracted intensive attention as promising materials for solar cells,1,2 light-emitting diodes,3,4 lasers,5 and photodetectors,6–8 benefitting from their low trap-state density and long charge diffusion length.9,10 Moreover, controlling the morphology of these hybrid lead halide perovskites, such as zero dimensional quantum dots,11–13 one dimensional (1D) nanowires (NWs),14–16 and two dimensional nanosheets,17,18 has been explored to have significant effects on their electric and optical properties. In particular, for 1D semiconducting NWs, electrons, holes or photons propagate freely along the NW direction.19,20 As a result, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconducting NWs show outstanding photoelectric properties.16,21–25 For instance, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite NW solar cells reported by the Park group showed a high power conversion efficiency, resulting from the outstanding conductivity and faster carrier separation of the hybrid semiconducting NWs.22 In addition, two-probe photoelectric detectors of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs with a fast photoresponse time, a large on/off ratio, and high detectivity were successfully fabricated by Horvath and his colleagues.21 However, to date, most research studies on organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NWs have been restricted to three dimensional methylammonium/formamidinium lead trihalide perovskites, and these hybrid perovskites have an issue of stability.21,22,26–30 Compared with conventional three dimensional lead trihalide semiconducting materials, low dimensional organic–inorganic hybrids show good moisture resistance and excellent optoelectronic properties.31–36 For 1D chain compounds, 1D inorganic chains are separated by organic cations to form a quantum wire structure, and the chains are connected by weak van der Waals forces, in which the charge carries are confined within the 1D inorganic framework.37 Therefore, exploring organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NWs based on 1D chain compounds may have a promising application prospect.
In this context, a new ABX3-type 1D infinite double chain lead trihalide compound, (2-methylpiperidine)PbI3 (1), was synthesized, and high quality organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NWs with a diameter of around 250 nm were facilely fabricated using a self-template-directed method. Further, photoconductive properties of the prepared semiconducting NWs were investigated using I–V and time-dependent photoresponse measurements. These new lead halide semiconducting NWs not only enrich the organic–inorganic hybrid NW family but also provide potential materials for photoelectric applications.
Experimental section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased and used without any further purification. 2-Methylpiperidine iodine was fabricated by adding equal stoichiometric ratio 2-methylpiperidine to dilute aqueous HI (25% in mixed ethanol and water) solution at 0 °C under strong stirring. The white precipitate was acquired by rotary evaporation at 60 °C. The product, 2-methylpiperidine iodine, was recrystallized with ethanol several times. Finally, the purified white powder was dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Synthesis and crystal growth of 1
Equimolar PbI2 (2.30 g, 5 mmol) and 2-methylpiperidine iodine (1.14 g, 5 mmol) were dissolved in the concentrated aqueous HI solution (55%, 50 mL) in a round bottom flask at 70 °C under magnetic stirring. Finally, yellow crystals were obtained by evaporating the solvent slowly at room temperature after several weeks. In addition, compound 1 can maintain good thermal stability until 610 K as observed from TGA (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Synthesis of the precursor NWs
In a typical synthesis procedure for precursor NWs,38 equimolar Pb(NO3)2 (0.066 g, 0.2 mmol) and L-cysteine (0.024 g, 0.2 mmol) were firstly dissolved in 60 mL deionized water under strong stirring at room temperature. The white NWs were formed immediately when 0.4 mL ethanolamine was quickly added to the above-mentioned aqueous solution and the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The white NWs were carefully collected by centrifugation and washed four times with water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the as-prepared NWs were dispersed in 8 mL isopropanol to serve as the precursor for the subsequent synthesis of NWs of 1.
Preparation of NWs based on 1
2-Methylpiperidine iodine (0.12 g) was dissolved in 8 mL isopropanol including 50 μL HI (55%) under ultrasonic wave conditions. Then, 1 mL precursor was quickly injected into solution under strong stirring at room temperature. After 4 h, the prepared NWs were collected and washed several times with isopropanol.
Powder X-ray diffraction and single crystal structure determination
Powder X-ray diffraction was performed on a Rigaku DMAX 2500 PC X-ray diffractometer at room temperature. The diffraction patterns were collected in the 2θ range of 5°–50° with a step size of 0.02°. Single crystal X-ray diffraction was performed on a SuperNova diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073). Absorption corrections were implemented by using the multi-scan program. The crystal structure was solved using direct methods and refined using the full matrix method based on F2 using the software packages SHELXLTL and SHELXS-97.39 Crystal data as well as details of data collection and refinement for compound 1 are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
Characterization
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using a JEOL JSM-6700F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired using a Tecnai F20. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a lambda 950 using BaSO4 as a standard, and the photoluminescence spectrum was acquired on the FLS980 (Edinburgh) equipped with a xenon lamp. I–V lines and the time-dependent photoresponse were measured on a KEITHLEY4200-SCS and temperature was controlled using a probe stage (linkam HFS600E-PB4).
Results and discussion
Bright yellow single crystals of 1 were obtained by volatilizing concentrated HI aqueous solution at room temperature (see the Experimental section for details). ABX3-type 1 crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with a centrosymmetric space group Pbcn at 293 K (Table S1, ESI†), and the phase purity was certified by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S2, ESI†). Structure analyses further reveal that the asymmetric unit of 1 consists of one Pb2+ ion, three I− ions and one protonated organic 2-methylpiperidine cation. Each lead is coordinated by six iodine atoms to form an octahedral configuration, and the adjacent octahedra are linked to give rise to a perovskite-like dinuclear [Pb2I6]2− anion cluster with face-sharing (Fig. 1a). Further, the perovskite-like dinuclear [Pb2I6] anion clusters form infinite single-chains by corner-sharing. Finally, the 1D infinite double chain framework of 1 along the (001) direction in the crystal lattice (Fig. 1c) is formed via edge-sharing of two single-chains (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†), the structure can be deemed as the assembly of 1D core–shell quantum wires, in which the organic 2-methylpiperidine cations surround in the lead iodine wires by weak hydrogen bonds. And the hydrogen-bond distances of N atoms and one triple bridged, one terminal I atoms are 3.6021 Å and 3.5675 Å, respectively (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Such a 1D core–shell quantum wire structure intensely motivates us to further explore the NWs of 1.

High quality NWs of 1 were prepared using a method based on the Pb-containing precursor NWs as self-template-directed, and the precursor NWs were fabricated using a previously reported method based on L-cysteine coordination.28 SEM (Fig. 2a) and TEM (Fig. 2b) images reveal that the uniform precursor NWs with a diameter of around 200 nm were successfully synthesized. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the precursor NWs reveal that these NWs are well crystallised as shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy proves that precursor NWs are composed of Pb, S, C, N, and O atoms (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The NWs based on compound 1 were prepared via adding the precursor NWs to 2-methylpiperidine iodine isopropanol solution at room temperature (see the Experimental section for details). As shown in Fig. 2c, powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the prepared NWs and simulated are completely consistent, indicating the high purity and good crystallinity of NWs based on 1. In addition, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S5a, ESI†) measurements show that the Pb and I atomic ratio of the prepared NWs is 1:2.7. From SEM micrographs (Fig. 2d and Fig. S5b, ESI†), uniform organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NWs with the length of tens of microns can be clearly observed, signifying that these prepared NWs still retain the morphology of 1D precursor NWs. High resolution SEM and TEM images (Fig. 2e and f) show that the diameter of NWs with a pretty smooth surface is about 250 nm. These results clearly confirmed that the Pb-containing precursor NWs have been fully converted into high quality organic–inorganic hybrid NWs based on 1.

To comprehend the semiconducting properties of compound 1, temperature-dependent conductivity was performed. The conductivity changes exponentially (Fig. S6, ESI†) as the number of carrier increases with the augment of temperature, indicating that 1 is an organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting compound.40,41 Besides, absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra of the prepared NWs were measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, the prepared NWs show an absorption edge of about 478 nm. The band gap of the prepared NWs is estimated to be about 2.61 eV according to the diffuse reflectance spectrum (Fig. 3a inset). To further understand the electronic mechanism of the semiconducting properties, the electronic band structure and density of states for 1 were calculated using ab initio first-principles density functional theory. As shown in Fig. 3b, the valence band maximum is situated in the middle of G and Z points, while the conduction band minimum is localized at the G point. So, 1 is an indirect band gap semiconductor42,43 and the band gap value is 2.608 eV, which is well consistent with the experimental result (Fig. 3a inset). Moreover, the partial density of states disclose that the valence band maximum almost stems from I 5p states, and the conduction band minimum mainly consists of the Pb 6p and I 5p states, which indicate that the inorganic moieties ascertain the band gap of 1, resembling some reported organic–inorganic hybrids.44–46 As a consequence, the energy gap could be easily adjusted by chemical tailoring.47

Further, the photoconductive properties based on the prepared hybrid semiconducting NWs were investigated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the semiconducting NWs were covered on a gold interdigital electrode with adjacent intervals about 180 μm using a spin coating method (Fig. S7, ESI†). Upon illumination using a Xenon lamp, I–V shows a linear relationship (Fig. 4b), which indicates that the hybrid semiconducting NWs are in ohmic contact with the gold interdigital electrode. Fig. 4c illustrated a good response to the light intensity with on/off ratio of 14 at the 3 bias voltages. Moreover, in different applied voltages of 1, 2, and 3 V, respectively, the photoelectric device based on the hybrid semiconducting NWs shows excellent repeatability of photocurrent under photo-switching conditions (Fig. S8, ESI†). What is more, the photoresponse after 3 weeks of storage under ambient conditions is almost the same as that of the as-prepared nanowire (Fig. S9, ESI†), indicating that the organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NWs have excellent air stability. In addition, the photoresponse time is one of the crucial parameters for photoconductive devices.48 Therefore, the photoresponse time of hybrid semiconducting NWs was tested, and Fig. 4d clearly reveals that the rise response time is as fast as 67 ms after illuminating and the decay recovery time is estimated to be about 60 ms after termination of irradiation, which is comparable to some of the reported pure inorganic and organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting materials.6,14,49–52 In a word, these results imply that the prepared semiconducting NWs based on a 1D organic–inorganic hybrid chain compound have a promising application in the photoelectric areas.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully obtained a 1D chain organic–inorganic hybrid ABX3-type semiconducting compound, featuring an infinite double chain quantum wire structure. Moreover, high quality semiconducting NWs based on compound 1 have been facilely prepared using a method based on the Pb-containing precursor NWs as self-template-directed. More importantly, the prepared semiconducting NWs exhibit an obvious photoconductive response. Hence, we believe that this work will broaden the organic–inorganic hybrid semiconducting NW family and pave the way for exploiting highly photoconductive materials based on semiconducting NWs of low dimensional organic–inorganic hybrids.
