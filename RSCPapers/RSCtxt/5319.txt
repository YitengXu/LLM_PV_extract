    , Accepted 31st August 2016First published on 1st September 2016AbstractHerein, we design and synthesize a perylene diimide derivative with a fully fused backbone, FITP, which possesses an elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level and high electron mobility. Consequently, polymer solar cells with FITP as the acceptor can provide the best efficiency of 7.33% with a high voltage of 0.99 V.
In recent years, fullerene-free polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained rapid development with the exploration of various electron acceptors.1–5 Strong light absorption, easily tuned energy levels, and improved morphological stability make non-fullerene electron acceptors, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61/C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM), show better flexibility and application prospects than fullerene derivatives.6–14 Also, the efficiencies of non-fullerene PSCs have been boosted to over 11%, which are comparative to or even better than that of fullerene-based PSCs.15–18
Among the numerous non-fullerene electron acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) is one of the most intensively studied and promising alternatives to fullerene derivatives because of its appropriate low-lying energy levels, complementary absorptions with narrow band gap polymer donors, and high electron mobility.5,19–23 To inhibit the strong tendency of forming large aggregates, PDI-based acceptors usually adopt a twisted molecular geometry, which can assure effective dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free charges, which lays the foundation for high photocurrents in devices.24–33 Although creating twisted or non-planar geometries seem to be a successful design strategy for PDI derivatives, the reduced π–π stacking of PDI molecules induced by steric repulsion weaken their electron-transporting capability to some extent. Therefore, fused-ring structures, which are favorable for π–π stacking, are also used in the design of PDI acceptors.7,34–36
To tap into the potential of PDI derivatives as high-performance acceptors in PSCs, the trade-off between fine phase-separation and strong π–π stacking should be resolved. Taking these considerations into account, in this work, we design and synthesize a non-fullerene acceptor, FITP, with a fully fused backbone by fusing two PDI units with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core (Scheme 1). IDTT is selected as the core because IDTT possesses a well-conjugated fused-ring structure itself and branched hexylphenyl groups which can help suppress strong intermolecular aggregation,37–40 and expose electron-accepting end-groups (two PDI units in our case) to form effective π–π stacking. The advantages of the IDTT core are demonstrated by the outstanding device performances of PSCs with IDTT core based electron acceptors.6,16,41,42 Hence, through the above molecular design, FITP will benefit from the fused structure as follows: (1) a planar and rigid backbone can be maintained, which favours the construction of percolated channels for efficient electron transport; (2) compared to that of unmodified PDI, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be lifted due to the electron-donating nature of the IDTT core,7 thus higher voltages can be expected for the resulting devices; and (3) the fused structure may allow π-electrons to be more delocalized, which leads to a red-shift and extension of absorption bands. Although the LUMO of FITP is elevated, it is still low enough to pair with some narrow band gap polymer donors, such as poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th). Additionally, the molecular geometry, absorption bands, energy levels, and photovoltaic properties of FITP are investigated in order to verify the feasibility of our molecular design strategy.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of FITP, and synthetic route and geometry of FITP. 
FITP was synthesized via the palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling between the trimethyl tin compound of IDTT and two mono-brominated PDI units followed by a cyclization reaction using iron trichloride as the oxidizing agent. 1H NMR (ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†) and elemental analysis were used to identify the chemical structure of FITP. The molecular geometry of FITP was confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the results are shown in Scheme 1. As expected, we can obviously notice that FITP has a planar molecular backbone, and four hexylphenyl side-chains stretch titled to the conjugated backbone plane. The thermal properties of FITP were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FITP exhibits excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (ESI, Fig. S3†). The DSC curve shows that there is no melting or crystallization peaks in the temperature range of 40–300 °C, which means that FITP is practically amorphous (ESI, Fig. S4†).
Optical properties were investigated via UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1a). We can observe that the absorption of the FITP film lies in the range of 300–700 nm, which is more red-shifted than that of normal PDI derivatives (300–600 nm).7,33 This phenomenon is reasonable because the fully fused backbone of FITP makes the π-electrons more delocalized. Since the absorption of PTB7-Th mainly lies in the range of 550–800 nm, we can get absorption in the full range of 300 nm to 800 nm if PTB7-Th is blended with FITP. This broad absorption of the blended film is beneficial for obtaining a high current in PSCs. The energy levels of FITP were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 1b). From the onset reduction potential (−0.65 V versus SCE) and the onset oxidation potential (1.08 V versus SCE), the LUMO and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of FITP were calculated to be −3.75 and −5.48 eV, respectively. As predicted, due to the strong electron-donating ability of the IDTT core, the LUMO of FITP is higher than that of PDI derivatives with a twisted molecular geometry.33 Therefore, we can expect a high voltage for the PSCs when FITP is used as the electron acceptor.

To test the potential of FITP as the electron acceptor for photovoltaic application, PSCs with the inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:FITP/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs are displayed in Fig. 2c and the relevant photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) are summarized in Table 1. We first changed the donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 to optimize the devices. It turns out that the ratio of 1.2:1 is the best choice. We obtained a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.13% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.18 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.51. To further improve the performance, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was used as an additive. Obvious improvements are observed when different amounts (1–3%) of CN are added. By adding 2% CN additive, we obtained the best PCE of 7.33% with a high Voc of 0.99 V, Jsc of 13.24 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.56. To the best of our knowledge, the Voc of nearly 1 V is one of the highest voltages for PSCs with efficiencies over 7%. Other post-treatments, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive or thermal annealing, were also tried to optimize the devices, but no obvious improvements were observed. Fig. 2d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of PTB7-Th:FITP (1.2:1, 2% CN) based PSCs. It has a broad cover over the range of 300–800 nm, which agrees well with the absorptions of PTB7-Th and FITP. Apparently, the photocurrent in the range of 300–550 nm is dominantly from FITP, and that in the range of 550–800 nm is mainly from PTB7-Th, which indicates that both components contribute to the photovoltaic responses.

The charge carrier transport of the PTB7-Th:FITP blended films was studied using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The J0.5–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†). The structure of the hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:FITP (1.2:1)/MoO3/Al, and the structure of the electron-only devices is ITO/PFN/PTB7-Th:FITP (1.2:1)/PFN/Al. The hole mobility for the as-cast devices was found to be 3.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, after the addition of CN, and the hole mobility increases to 5.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobility for the as-cast device was calculated to be 3.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, after the addition of CN, and the electron mobility only has a slight increase with the value of 3.66 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, the μh/μe ratios for the as-cast and CN devices were calculated to be 1.11 and 1.53, respectively. Therefore, high and balanced mobilities are obtained for the PTB7-Th:FITP blended thin films, and the addition of CN can improve the mobilities to some extent, which may help improve the current and efficiency of the devices. It is interesting to see that the post-treatment with the CN additive increases the hole mobility more than the electron mobility of the blends. The reason for this may be that PTB7-Th is crystalline whereas FITP is amorphous. The addition of CN may increase the crystallinity or face-on orientation of PTB7-Th, and thus increases the hole mobility. Although the addition of CN can't enhance the crystallinity of FITP, it may influence the orientation of FITP. Therefore, the hole mobility is increased more than the electron mobility when CN additive is used.
To investigate the molecular orientation and crystallinity in both neat and blended thin films, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out. Fig. 3 presents the two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS images and intensity profiles versus wave vectors qz and qr, which correspond to the molecular packing information in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively. For the PTB7-Th neat film, a (100) lamellar peak centered at qr ≈ 0.26 Å−1 (d ≈ 24.2 Å), and a strong (010) π–π stacking peak centered at qz ≈ 1.59 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.9 Å) along the qz axis are observed, which are indicative of a preferred face-on orientation. For the FITP neat film, no obvious peaks are observed, which is related with the relatively amorphous property of FITP. From its intensity profile, we can barely identify a very weak (010) π–π stacking peak at qz ≈ 1.73 Å−1 (d ≈ 3.6 Å) and a lamellar peak centered at qr ≈ 0.28 Å−1 (d ≈ 22.4 Å), which suggest the existence of weak face-on order in the pure FITP film. For the blended films, the face-on lamellar peak and π–π peak of PTB7-Th still appear in the same location. The peaks of FITP are not noticeable since they are covered by those of PTB7-Th in the blended films. It is worth noting that the addition of CN increases the intensity of the lamellar and π–π peaks, which suggests an enhancement of film crystallinity. Therefore, the favorable face-on orientation and higher crystallinity in the PTB7-Th:FITP CN film can be correlated with the observed improvements in charge carrier mobility.

In summary, we present a PDI derivative with two PDI units fused with an IDTT core, FITP, which possesses a fully fused backbone. The fully fused backbone causes FITP to show a superior charge carrier transport property, and the high-lying LUMO of FITP allows a high Voc for PSCs. By blending with PTB7-Th, FITP exhibits a good performance as an electron acceptor with a high efficiency of 7.33% and high Voc of 0.99 V. Our work demonstrates that, a PDI derivative with a fully fused backbone can show excellent performance and both high efficiency and high voltage can be achieved simultaneously, which provide meaningful guidelines for the future development of non-fullerene electron acceptors in organic photovoltaics.
