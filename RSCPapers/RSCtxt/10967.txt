    , Accepted 28th February 2022First published on 1st March 2022AbstractThe intrinsic features of tumors often give rise to unsatisfactory outcomes of photothermal treatment (PTT). Remarkably, the tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant antioxidants, elevated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and low pH has proven to be a tremendous obstacle for tumor treatment. Therefore, developing an effective photosensitizer that can respond to both NIR radiation and TME is imperative but remains a challenge. Here, we explore a molybdenum-based polyoxometalate (Na15[MoVI126-MoV28O462H14(H2O)70]·400H2O, [Mo154]) as a photosensitizer for TME-manipulated PTT enhancement because of the following features. Firstly, the 808 nm absorption of [Mo154] can be increased via pH-induced aggregation; secondly, due to the unique multi-electron property, [Mo154] can deplete cysteine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) via redox reactions; thirdly, reduced [Mo154] ([rMo154]) can further improve the 808 nm absorption by promoting the transition from Mo(VI) to Mo(V). Consequently, [Mo154] can overcome several obstacles in TME and thus improve the PTT efficiency by synergizing the effects of pH-induced aggregation, cysteine reduction and depletion, and free-radical scavenging. In addition to providing a promising photosensitizer for PTT, this finding extends the application of molybdenum-based polyoxometalates in the biomedical field.
1. Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease, with an average survival rate of six months after diagnosis. The high oxidant levels in pancreatic tumors is a serious issue and kills the surrounding normal cells; nevertheless, they thrive well under these toxic conditions by importing large amounts of cysteine.1–3 These competent tumor cells use cysteine to manufacture molecules that detoxify the oxidants, such as ROS, while they indiscriminately slaughter the innocent victims i.e. healthy cells. Therefore, it is possible to slow tumor growth by targeting this anti-oxidant amino acid.4 The strategy of starving the pancreatic cancer cells of cysteine has been proven to work well.5 In addition, when the gene that controls cysteine import was knocked out in mice with pancreatic cancer closely resembling human tumors, the tumors stopped growing as the cysteine supply was cut off, and the median survival time doubled.6 A similar result was achieved when the mice were treated with cysteinase, an experimental drug that breaks down cysteine in the blood.7 Therefore, the depletion of cysteine is an effective strategy to kill pancreatic cancers.
In addition, the specific microenvironment of tumors (TME) is believed to be the major obstacle to cancer therapy.8–10 Some common features of TME are mild acidity and reducibility,11,12 which are beneficial for materials that can undergo low-pH-induced self-assembly and self-adaptive photothermal conversion. Moreover, the elevation of anti-oxidants, such as cysteine and GSH, is another general feature of the cancer phenotype; the anti-oxidant system (AOS) within the cancer cells may prevent them from damage via quenching the excessive free radicals.13 For example, the levels of cysteine (Cys) and GSH in pancreatic cancer are several-fold higher than those in the normal tissues,14 thus causing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) to be scavenged before they arrive at the target sites and the subsequent significant reduction in anti-tumor efficiency.15,16 Therefore, reducing the intracellular cysteine level is highly desirable to circumvent tumor resistance and improve cancer therapy. Meanwhile, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is also over-produced within a tumor due to insufficient blood supply and the rapid metabolism of cancer cells.17–19 Since the above features are rather unique to the TME compared with normal tissues, it is conceivable that the manipulation of TME by internal and external stimuli will achieve a tumor-specific therapy.20–22 Photothermal conversion has attracted significant attention in the past decade with potential applications in various fields, such as solar energy collection,23 photothermal catalysis,24 microcontrollers,25 and photothermal therapy for cancer. Although it is considered a highly effective technique in advanced cancer treatment, photothermal therapy mediated by nanomaterials still faces significant challenges in clinical practice.26–28 The high-performance photothermal nanomaterials reported so far mainly include a variety of metal nanoparticles,29,30 metal oxides,31,32 carbon nanocomposites33,34 and organic conjugated polymers.35 However, the search for satisfactory nanotherapeutic materials is not a purely medical consideration in the pursuit of improved therapeutic efficiency and safety. Many aspects, such as low cost, mass production, and easy storage of laboratory samples, are also necessary for hospital use.
Herein, we explore a nanomaterial of [Mo154] with a size of 3.6 nm and strong absorption in the near-infrared region,36,37 which can be primarily improved by using cysteine as the reductant; it is expected to increase the photothermal conversion efficiency and be an efficient agent in the photothermal treatment of tumors. In addition, in the weakly acidic and reductive tumor microenvironment (TME),10 the reduced polyoxometalate (POM) self-assembled, resulting in enhanced absorbance at 808 nm, improving the photothermal conversion efficiency of [Mo154] and its anti-tumor effect in vitro. Furthermore, it is worth noting that due to the easy change in the valence of the molybdenum ions, sensitive and robust scavenging function towards H2O2 and ROS was also observed in this work. Therefore, this material can protect normal cells from damage. Thus, the strategies mentioned above are effective in tumor prevention and ablation. In summary, for the first time, we show that [Mo154] nanoclusters, which possess an ultrasmall size, good water solubility, and versatile properties, can serve as a potent yet straightforward photothermal sensitizer that can respond to both external stimulation at 808 nm and the internal TME (low pH, high cysteine/GSH and abundant H2O2).

Scheme 1 demonstrates the main principles of [Mo154] in anti-tumor treatment. Firstly, due to photo- and redox-sensitive elements like Mo, [Mo154] physically increases the NIR radiation dose deposition within cancer cells. Moreover, under the highest oxidation state of Mo(VI), these nanoclusters deplete the intracellular Cystine pool in Panc02 cells via the redox reaction between Mo(VI) and Cys, leading to overwhelming AOS and increased ROS levels.6 Besides, the mild photothermal effect caused by [rMo154] under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation enhances the intratumoral blood flow, subsequently increasing the concentration of oxygen around the TME. This further decreases hypoxia-associated radiotherapy resistance and results in the enhancement of PTT efficacy. Therefore, the [Mo154], with its dual response to 808 nm light and low pH, does not only enhance the local NIR dose deposition within cancer cells but also manipulates the TME toward reversing tumor resistance through the depletion of Cys levels, photothermal conversion of H2O2 into HO˙, and improvement of oxygen levels within tumors.

2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials
The synthesis of [Mo154] was performed by following the previous report.37 In brief, 3.04 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O was first added to 25 mL water; then 2.7 mL 32% hydrochloric acid (HA) was added to the solution and stirred continuously. Finally, 0.15 g of NaS2O4 was added to obtain a dark blue solution. After keeping the solution in a closed flask for 24 h at room temperature (RT), blue crystals were obtained through filtration, quickly washed with cold water, and dried at RT with CaCl2 for further use.

L-Cysteine hydrochloride (Cys) was purchased from Beijing Dingguo Changsheng Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (China). H2O2 and DCFH-DA were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. (China). 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and trypsin-EDTA were bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. Ltd. (China). Potassium peroxodisulfate (K2S408) was bought from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co. Ltd. (China). The cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was obtained from Biotool Co. (USA). Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Biological Industries. For cell culture, Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was acquired from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (USA). All chemical agents were used directly as received. The water used in the experiments was double distilled (ρ = 18.2 MΩ cm, 25 °C) in a Millipore Milli-Q purification assembly.
2.2. Instrumentation
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Meanwhile, the size distribution of the particles was measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using an instrument of Malvern Zetesizer (Nano-ZS90 USA). The photothermal properties and photothermography were recorded on an infrared thermal camera (FLIR C3-X). The cell viability was obtained from optical density (OD) measurements at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, ELx800, USA). The fluorescence spectrum for DCFH-DA was obtained using a Shimadzu (Japan) RF-5301PC spectrophotometer. Photographs were taken by using a cellphone from Xiaomi (MIX 4).
2.3. Cysteine-induced reduction of [Mo154] in vitro
The stock solutions of [Mo154] and Cys were prepared in distilled water. Then, they were mixed to achieve the final concentrations of 5 μM [Mo154] and 1–7 mM Cys. Incubation for 0.5, 24, 48, or 72 h at 4 °C was performed to get reduced [Mo154], [rMo154], at different levels. The UV-vis absorption spectrum was recorded for each mixture, respectively, to assay the reduction levels.
2.4. pH-Induced aggregation of [rMo154] in vitro
The stock solutions of [Mo154] (100 μM, pH 3.15) and Cys (1 M) were prepared in distilled water. Then, they were mixed to obtain the final concentration of 5 μM [Mo154] and 1–7 mM Cys (pH 3.43, 3.15, 2.98 and 2.79). The UV-vis absorption spectra were used to monitor their absorption changes.
2.5. Photothermal property assay of [Mo154] and [rMo154]
Each sample of [Mo154] and [rMo154] with different reduction levels in solution (1 mL) was irradiated with a near-infrared laser (808 nm, with a density of 1.4 W cm−2) for different times (1–10 min). The corresponding temperatures were recorded at intervals of 30 s. Besides, an equivalent amount of water was irradiated with the same laser to serve as a control. The FLIR C3-X camera recorded the temperature change in the solutions and took IR images simultaneously. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated based on the reported method.38
2.6. Cell culture
The human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa, C6330), human colon cancer cell line (SW480, C6915), human Embryonic Kidney 293T Cells (293T, C6008), and mouse pancreatic cancer cell line (Panc02, YS2683C) were cultured at 37 °C in a high-glucose DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 mg mL−1 streptomycin and 100 units per mL penicillin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h.
2.7. Anti-tumor cell assays
HeLa, SW480, and 293T cells were seeded (1 × 104 cells in 100 μL of DMEM per well) in quadruplication in 96-well microplates and allowed to adhere overnight. Then, the culture medium was replaced by 100 μL of fresh medium containing [Mo154] or [rMo154] at concentrations from 0.4 to 3.2 μM, while the molar ratio of Cys to [Mo154] was 600 times in all samples. All samples were preincubated at pH = 5.0 and 4 °C for 48 h. Next, these cells were irradiated by the 808 nm light for 5 min at a power density of 1.4 W cm−2. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced by an FBS-free medium containing 10% CCK-8 and co-incubated for another 2 h. Cell proliferation was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, ELx800, USA) and expressed as the percentage of untreated control cells.
2.8. ROS scavenging with [Mo154]
Two typical ROS (H2O2 and free radical) were selected to evaluate the ROS-scavenging activity of [Mo154]. For H2O2 scavenging evaluation, 5 μM [Mo154] was incubated with H2O2 at gradient concentrations, and the corresponding UV-vis spectra were recorded, respectively. In addition, the free-radical-scavenging capacity of [Mo154] was tested using the ABTS radical cation decolorization assay based on the reduction of ABTS+˙ radicals by the POM nanoclusters. First, 7 mM ABTS was dissolved in distilled water and treated with 2.45 mM K2S408 to produce ABTS radical cations (ABTS+˙); the mixture was allowed to stay in the dark at RT for 24 h before use. Then, the UV–Vis absorption spectra of the pure ABTS+˙ solution (Ab), and ABTS+˙ solution in the presence of 0.4–6.4 μM [Mo154] (Ae) were measured. Finally, the percentage of ABTS+˙ inhibition was calculated based on the following equation: [(Ab − Ae)/Ab] × 100%. Each measurement was carried out in triplicate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. pH-induced aggregation of [Mo154]
In water or PBS, the highly hydrophilic surface of [Mo154] leads to a well dispersive cluster in the shape of a hollow wheel with a diameter of 3.6 nm, which meets the threshold for kidney filtration and thus can pass through the glomeruli easily. However, under acidic conditions, [Mo154] can self-assemble into a hollow ball with a diameter of 45 nm.36 The concentration-dependent absorption spectra between 400–900 nm showed a peak at 750 nm for [Mo154], which originated from the charge transfer between Mo(V) and Mo(VI) through the bridging oxygen bonds.39 The appearance of such a band makes spectral monitoring of the conversion between Mo(V) and Mo(VI) easy; an increase in the ratio of Mo(V) to Mo(VI) leads to enhanced absorption and vice versa.40 The transformation between Mo(VI) and Mo(V) in [Mo154] under different redox environments can be used to adjust the optical features by introducing a reductant in the system to regulate the electronic structure. Moreover, the strong absorption of [Mo154] in the near-infrared (NIR) region enables it to efficiently convert light energy into heat energy under 808 nm laser irradiation, which is beneficial for efficient photothermal therapy in clinics.41
As shown, the low pH-induced self-assembly of [Mo154] led to enhanced absorption at 808 nm (A808, Fig. 1a), which corresponds with one of the most commonly used NIR lasers in clinics because of its high penetration depth.42,43 In addition, the blue colour of [Mo154] in solution deepened monotonically with successive pH reduction (Fig. 1b), corresponding to the proportionally increasing NIR absorbance. In addition, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) plot in Fig. 1c shows that the diameter of [Mo154] increased with the acidity decreasing in the solution, further confirming pH-induced [Mo154] aggregation. However, when the pH value of the solution exceeded 7.0, the A808 of [Mo154] almost disappeared after 0.5 h incubation, and the blue colour of the solution faded completely at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1b), indicating that [Mo154] cannot exist for a long time at such conditions. However, it can withstand the tumor microenvironment (TME) well and even remain very stable. As expected, after 24 h incubation, absorbance at the low pH values was still strong, but it was unstable at high pH (Fig. 1d).

3.2. Cysteine-induced reduction of [Mo154] in vitro
By monitoring the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 2a) of 5 μM [Mo154] at different concentrations of cysteine, the correlation between cysteine and A808 was achieved. [Mo154] had a broad NIR absorption centered at 750 nm. In the presence of cysteine, absorption at 808 nm increased (Fig. 2a) gradually with the concentration. This indicates that more Mo(VI) reduction to Mo(V) by cysteine leads to the improved electron transition numbers from Mo(V) to Mo(VI),44,45 thereby increasing the absorbance of [Mo154] at 808 nm. Besides, at a fixed amount of cysteine, A808 changed with incubation time (Fig. S1, ESI†). Taking 1 mM cysteine as an example, along with the incubation time, the A808 tended to rise and reached the maximum at 48 h, but then it decreased. Similarly, when treated with different amounts of cysteine, such as 3 or 5 mM, the A808 showed a more prominent parabolic trend with the incubation time (Fig. 2b). Surprisingly, the turn points moved ahead to 24 h, which may be due to the accelerated redox reaction rate at higher cysteine concentrations, resulting in the early appearance of the maximum A808 (Fig. 2b).
 Fig. 2  UV-Vis absorption spectra of 5 μM [Mo154] in the presence of different amounts of Cys at 1, 3, 5, 7 mM, measured 0.5 h after mixing at 4 °C. (b) The time-dependent plots of the absorbance at 808 nm (A808) of 5 μM [Mo154] at different Cys concentrations at 4 °C. (c) Comparison of the photothermal heating curves of the samples under the laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.4 W cm−2) for 10 min. (d) IR thermal images of the mixture of 5 μM [Mo154] and 3 mM cysteine, encountering 10 min laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.4 W cm−2), which were measured 24 h after mixing. 
After 24 h incubation, 3 mM cysteine induced the strongest A808, indicating the optimal concentration and reaction time for [Mo154] reduction, and therefore, they were used for the following PTT treatments. However, these “parabolic” inflection points decreased in the presence of excessive cysteine. This may be because excessive cysteine destroys the structure of [Mo154] and causes it to accumulate into larger particles, leading to precipitation. For example, in the presence of 7 mM cysteine, a large amount of blue precipitation was seen after 12 h incubation (data not shown).
Therefore, along with the incubation time, different concentrations of cysteine increased POM absorption at 808 nm (Fig. 2b). Subsequently, the A808 of [Mo154] varied with incubation time at fixed reductant concentrations. Moreover, at 24 h, the reaction reached saturation. Then it decreased, leading to a wide range of adjustable photothermal conversions and allowing the use of laser irradiation energy of different powers to produce the maximum heating effects under appropriate reductant concentration and incubation time. Finally, the 808 nm irradiation produced anefficient temperature rise suitable for PTT. Fig. 2c shows the degree of temperature increase induced by different amounts of cysteine in 10 min of 808 nm irradiation. In addition, the results show that higher degrees of [Mo154] reduction induced relatively higher photothermal conversion, which is beneficial to improve the conversion efficiency of [Mo154].
Meanwhile, after 10 min irradiation, the photothermal conversion of [rMo154] induced by 3 mM Cys was most substantial, and the temperature rise was 12.9 °C higher than that of [Mo154]. Accordingly, the photothermal conversion efficiency of [rMo154] was 46.1% (Fig. S2, ESI†), which was 15.2% higher than that of [Mo154].46 Finally, Fig. 2d shows the infrared photos of the mixture under the laser at different irradiation times. The colours represent the rapid temperature change from dark blue to red and then white with time, indicating that the [rMo154]-induced temperature rise was sharp under laser irradiation.
3.3. pH optimization of [rMo154] on PTT
Then, we fixed the concentrations of [Mo154] and Cys to optimize the ideal pH for the anti-tumor. Along with the incubation time, pH induced changes in A808 largely (Fig. S3, ESI†). As shown, at pH 5.0, the A808 of [Mo154] varied with incubation time (Fig. 3a). The intensity reached saturation at 48 h, and then it decreased with time, leading to a wide range of time adjustments on photothermal conversion. Fig. 3b compares the time-dependent A808 responses of the mixture of [Mo154] and Cys at different pH (5.0–8.0) in PBS buffer. The results show that the lower the pH, the higher was the A808 of [Mo154], which means that optimizing the pH and incubation time was beneficial to improving the A808. Finally, pH 5.0 produced the most efficient A808 suitable for photothermal treatments.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of 5 μM [Mo154] in the prescence of 3 mM Cys in PBS buffer (pH = 5.0) after incubation for different times (0.5–72 h) at 4 °C. (b) Time-dependent plot of A808 for 5 μM [Mo154] and 3 mM Cys after incubation at 4 °C, at different pH (5.0–8.0) in PBS buffer. (c) Photothermal curves of 5 μM [Mo154] and 3 mM Cys in PBS buffer (pH = 5.0) after reaction for different times at 4 °C under laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.4 W cm−2) for 10 min. (d) IR thermal images of 5 μM [Mo154] and 3 mM cysteine in PBS buffer (pH = 5.0) after incubation for 48 h, with 10 min of laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.4 W cm−2). 

Fig. 3c shows the degree of temperature increase induced by [rMo154] at different incubation times, along with 808 nm irradiation for 10 min. The results showed that the photothermal conversion changed with time, which means that the optimization of reaction time improved the photothermal conversion efficiency of [Mo154]. Meanwhile, after irradiation for 10 min, the photothermal conversion ability of [rMo154] obtained at 48 h was the most substantial, and the temperature rise during the photothermal conversion was 3.9 °C higher than that of [Mo154]. Fig. 3d shows the infrared photos of laser irradiation at different times. With the extension of irradiation time, the colour representing the temperature changes rapidly changed from dark blue to red and finally to white, indicating that the temperature of [Mo154] increased sharply under 808 nm irradiation. At the same time, the photothermal conversion efficiency was 36.8% (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is 5.9% higher than that of [Mo154].46
3.4. Anti-oxidant ability of [Mo154]
Mo-containing POMs have been proven to possess desirable reversibility in multi-electron redox reactions, endowing them with attractive photothermal properties.11 In principle, the electron structure of [Mo154] consists of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) mainly localized on the d0 or d1 of the transition metal atom of Mo.47 When [Mo154] is irradiated by an ideal wavelength with energy equal to or higher than the HOMO–LUMO gap, either in the UV-vis or NIR region, the electrons are excited and highly reactive electron–hole pairs are generated.48 Subsequently, these excited electrons and holes are trapped in the surface sites and react with the surrounding water or other molecules via either reductive (electron) or oxidative (hole) pathways.49 It is worth noting that if the energy level of POMs matches the potential of H2O2, they will catalyze low-toxic H2O2.28 Therefore, it offers an opportunity to use the overproduced H2O2 within the TME to improve the treatments. The ROS production inside the tumor cell is beneficial to tumor treatment. However, due to extensive light scattering and absorption by the skin and tissues, the generated ROS also damage the surrounding normal cells, which dramatically limits the bio-applications of POMs and should be eliminated.
The ROS-scavenging activity of [Mo154] was tested by incubating it with two primary ROS sources, namely hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Fig. 4a) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate) (ABTS, Fig. 4c). [Mo154] can exist in two states, namely Mo(V) and Mo(VI); Mo(V) is shown in blue because of the electron transition to form Mo(VI), while Mo(VI) is colourless.44 The time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of [Mo154] in the presence of 5 μM H2O2 showed a considerable decrease in absorption at 808 nm with time (Fig. 4b). This absorption weakening was attributed to the decrease in Mo(V) population as it is oxidized by H2O2 with time. Besides, 25 μM H2O2 in solution bleached about 43.8% of the 808 nm absorption of [Mo154], while 50 μM H2O2 diminished absorption by more than 70% (Fig. S5, ESI†). Moreover, after treatment with DCFH-DA, the emission at 525 nm was measured to assay ROS generation by [Mo154]. As shown, the [Mo154] solution treated with H2O2 and DCFH-DA showed no fluorescence at 525 nm for DCF irrespective of irradiation at 808 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). That means no ROS generation along with the colour depletion of [Mo154]. Such a result is strange, but might have occurred possibly due to an increased reduction of [Mo154] than new ROS generation in the redox reaction between [Mo154] and H2O2.

(b) The H2O2 concentration- and incubation time-dependent absorbance at 808 nm. (c) UV-Vis absorption spectra and (d) digital photos of the different concentrations (0–6.4 μM) of [Mo154] after ROS scavenging for 20 min. (e) The plot of the absorbance at 734 nm for the free radical-scavenging activity of [Mo154] at different concentrations incubated for 20 min. (f) Percentage of free radical-scavenging based on the absorbance peak at 734 nm. 
Next, the ABTS radical assay was used to test whether [Mo154] could scavenge free radicals. Fig. 4c shows that [Mo154] eliminated more than 1/3 of the free radicals at a low concentration (1.6 μM). Obviously, [Mo154] is a polymetallic oxygen cluster with a concentration-dependent effect in scavenging free radicals. Fig. 4d shows that after 20 min incubation, the higher the concentration of [Mo154], the lighter was the dark green color of ABTS+·. Finally, at 6.4 μM [Mo154], the colour of the solution disappeared thoroughly. It is fantastic that [Mo154] could scavenge ABTS+˙ very quickly. The time-dependent plots confirmed that this could be accomplished in seconds, along with a sharp decrease in absorption (Fig. 4e). Taken together, [Mo154] is a robust scavenger of free radicals and can protect normal cells from the ROS damage generated during PTT (Fig. 4f). Similar to the mechanism of ceria nanoparticles, the high ROS-scavenging performance of POM is intrinsically attributed to the fact that part of Mo(V) in POM is oxidized to Mo(VI) when eliminating the generated ROS.50,51
3.5. Synergetic effects of PTT and cysteine-induced reduction in cells
Based on the pH-induced aggregation and reduction of [Mo154] by Cys, we evaluated the PTT efficiencies of both [Mo154] and [rMo154] on three cancer cell lines. The toxicity was first evaluated based on the CCK-8 method (Fig. 5a–f). In the presence of 1.92 mM Cys, the CCK-8 assay on the three cell lines showed a dark orange color (Fig. 5a, c and e) regardless of the 808 nm laser irradiation. The corresponding survival rate in each cell was over 85.6% (Fig. 5b, d, f and h, blue), indicating that Cys did not affect the growth of the three cell lines much in a wide range of Cys concentration between 0.24–1.92 mM. At the same time, without laser irradiation, the survival rate of the cell lines treated with 3.2 μM [Mo154] and [rMo154] remained more than 92.5%, which proved that neither of them affected cell growth. On the other hand, when the three cell lines were irradiated by 808 nm, there was almost no colour change in the control group. Together with the survival rates higher than 88.2%, the result suggests that the 808 nm irradiation did not cause effective killing of the three cancer cell lines. In HeLa cells, the results indicated that the inhibition of cell growth by the two materials improved in a dose-dependent manner, particularly under 808 nm irradiation. For example, the survival rate of HeLa cells after treatment with 3.2 μM [Mo154] (Fig. 5b, green) or just 808 nm irradiation (Fig. 5b, yellow) was 99.3% and 88.2%, respectively. After co-treatment with 3.2 μM [Mo154] and 808 nm irradiation, the survival fraction declined to 57.5% (Fig. 5b, green). Compared with [Mo154] alone, more than 41.8% inhibition of HeLa cells was achieved along with 808 nm irradiation, confirming the photothermal effects of [Mo154].
 Fig. 5  Viability of (a and b) HeLa, (c and d) SW480, (e and f) Panc02 and (g and h) 293T cells after photothermal treatment (PTT) at different concentrations of [Mo154], in the presence and absence of Cys, as measured after 48 h incubation at pH = 5.0 with or without irradiation (808 nm, 1.4 W cm−2) for 5 min or not, repectively. (a, c, e and g) Photos of 96-well plates containing 3.2 μM [Mo154] and corresponding Cys without 808 nm laser treatment and [rMo154] at the different concentrations (I) 0.4 μM (II) 0.8 μM (III) 1.6 μM (IV) 3.2 μM with 808 nm laser treatment. 
The group treated with [rMo154] showed a dose-dependent cell viability trend similar to [Mo154], which was dramatically enhanced after 808 nm irradiation (Fig. 5b, red). Without irradiation, there was almost no inhibition of cell survival in the presence of 3.2 μM [rMo154] (100.2%) or [Mo154] (99.3%). Under irradiation at 808 nm, as shown in Fig. 5a, as the concentration of [rMo154] was increased from 0.4 to 3.2 μM, the orange became monotonically lighter. Moreover, 3.2 μM [rMo154] and [Mo154]decreased the survival rate of HeLa cells to 36.8% and 57.5%, respectively. Therefore, 63.4% improvement was achieved with 808 nm irradiation and 3.2 μM [rMo154]. Therefore, this suggests noticeable enhancements in killing and [Mo154] reduction under 808 nm irradiation.
Similar results were achieved for the cancer cell line SW480, (Fig. 5c and d). Without 808 nm irradiation, 92.6% and 92.5% were the survival rates shown by [rMo154] and [Mo154]; while under 808 nm irradiation, 10.7% and 50.0% survival rates were illustrated for [rMo154] and [Mo154], respectively. Therefore, the improvement in irradiation-induced killing of SW480 was more profound for [rMo154] (10.7% vs. 92.6%) than [Mo154] (50.0% vs. 92.5%).
Similar results were expected for the cancer cell line Panc02 (Fig. 5e and f). Without irradiation, 92.9% and 93.7% were the survival rates shown by [rMo154] and [Mo154]; while under the 808 nm irradiation, 13.6% and 44.0% survival rate were illustrated by [rMo154] and [Mo154], respectively. The 808 nm irradiation significantly improved the Panc02-killing rates of [rMo154] and [Mo154].
It is worth noting that under identical conditions, more than 83% of the non-cancerous 293T cells still survived (Fig. 5g and h). Meanwhile, Fig. 5g shows that the colour of the other groups was the same as that of the blank group in orange. All the above phenomena indicate that [Mo154] and [rMo154] did not affect the growth of the 293T cells, regardless of laser irradiation. The significant differences between this cell line and the three cancer cells directly relate to the specific microenvironment of the cancer cells. The relatively low pH and the high levels of the reductive substance in cancer cells result in acid-induced POM aggregation and [rMo154] generation. Notably, the enhancement of absorption at 808 nm both by pH and Cys reduction synergistically improved the PTT effect on the cancer cells, finally improving the tumor-killing efficiency of [Mo154].
4. Conclusions
In summary, we explored a TME-adaptive PTT treatment using Mo-based POM ([Mo154]) based on its unique multi-electron properties. The 808 nm absorption of [Mo154] was promoted via the low pH-induced aggregation and cysteine-induced reduction of [Mo154], which strengthened the PTT effects under 808 nm irradiation. Besides, in cells, the PTT effect could be further improved by mimicking the TME, which resulted in a better killing outcome on tumor cells and fewer side effects on the normal counterparts. Through employing TME-sensitive POM, this study provides new insights into the design of intelligent photosensitizers to achieve more precise and effective PTT treatment and extends the application of polyoxometalates in the biological and biomedical fields.
