    , Accepted 5th February 2014First published on 5th February 2014AbstractCharge generation and transport in (CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx sensitized mesostructured solar cells are investigated. A highly efficient charge generation is directly proven by time correlated single photon counting analysis. Photoinduced absorption and transient photovoltage investigations depict double charge recombination dynamics. To explain the high device performances according to those spectroscopic observations, we suggest the existence of two complementary paths for electron transport, involving either TiO2 or perovskite matrixes.

Broader context
The recent employment of self-assembling hybrid halide perovskites in full solid state sensitized solar cells has signified a substantial advancement for third generation photovoltaic devices, allowing record efficiencies up to 15% for low cost and stable devices. Interestingly, perovskites are easy to process and their physical properties can be widely tuned through material composition and preparation condition variations. Because of these properties, perovskites are ideal candidates as key constituents of photovoltaic devices. In this context, however, only few studies have been dedicated to the comprehension of photoinduced charge generation and transport. We report a detailed spectroscopic investigation aiming at understanding the charge dynamics in (CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx sensitized mesostructured solar cells. Through the analysis of model systems and devices, we suggest a peculiar working mechanism. According to experimental evidence, a double path for charge transport is proposed, allowing electron percolation in both TiO2 and perovskite media. In the context of this rapidly expanding research front, our study aims to underline the need of a specific investigating approach and device design of perovskite-based devices, as they differ substantially from classical solid state dye sensitized devices.

Sensitized solar cells, among the alternatives to silicon-based photovoltaic devices, attract great interest for their potentially easy processability, roughness, efficiency and low production costs.1 However, despite many years of focused research efforts, these devices barely figure in the PV market share.2,3 The presence of a liquid corrosive electrolyte in classical Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) and the still limited efficiencies reached by solid state sensitized solar cells, have been the main obstacles for this scale up. Starting from 2012, the utilization of an underexplored eclectic class of materials, hybrid halide perovskites, in full solid state sensitized devices has signified a field breakthrough, allowing novel device layouts to lead to record performances4–8 and holding the promise of cost effective solar energy production. The utilization of these hybrid materials offers the advantages of organic compounds, such as solution processability and tunability of optical properties, and inorganic crystalline semiconductors, such as high charge mobilities and large absorption coefficients. This class of materials was first investigated many years ago, but they were never employed as active components in solar converting devices before 2009.9–14 For this reason, despite the widening literature on the subject, many questions, concerning their peculiar structural chemistry and the physics of light induced processes, have to be addressed, to lead to further advancements in this emerging research front. Perovskites can act as a sensitizing layer deposited on a mesostructured semiconductor such as TiO2,6,13–17 as a p-type material in depleted hole conductor-free heterojunction solar cells18,19 or as an n-type light harvesting and charge transporting material, layered on an inert mesostructured oxide (Al2O3) and coupled with a Hole Transporting Material (HTM).5,20 Even though a detailed rationalization of the charge generation and transport for all of these architectural diverse devices has not been yet carried out, the ability of perovskite to efficiently perform ambipolar charge transport implies a peculiar mechanism with respect to the conventional solid state sensitized solar cells. An important question to be addressed regards the interpretation of the perovskite's behaviour when sandwiched between an n-type and a p-type material. In this scenario, the perovskite could contribute to the transport of either electrons or holes and thereby could constitute an alternative path for charge collection. This possibility, to the best of our knowledge, has not been directly investigated or proven so far. Here, we propose a mechanism for charge generation and recombination in (CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx (denoted as PERO in this paper) solar cells employing TiO2 as mesoporous substrates and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC),21–23 photoinduced absorption (PIA) and transient photocurrent/photovoltage (TPC/TPV) measurements24–27 were selected as direct investigative tools for the determination of charge generation and transport in model systems and working devices. The collection of our results depicts an unusual behaviour for charge dynamics, as the presence of two n-type materials, TiO2 and perovskite, generates alternative paths for electron transport. This important new insight helps the comprehension of these innovative devices and suggests potential design improvements.
Throughout the report we compared a PERO-based device with a solid state dye sensitized solar cell (SS-DSSC), manufactured employing a well known organic dye: D149. Our aim is to compare the photo-physical processes taking place in the PERO-sensitized cell with those of a device with a comparably thin photoanode and high efficiency in charge density generation.28 The device preparation details are reported in the ESI,† while photovoltaic performances of PERO and D149 in a SS-DSSC are shown in Fig. 1.

The remarkable difference in power conversion efficiency (PCE) between the organic dye and the perovskite, 3.2% and 7.9%, respectively, was essentially due to the improved photocurrent, almost three-fold higher, which characterizes the hybrid compound. The short-circuit current (Jsc) largely depends on the photo-generated carriers and on the interfacial recombination of the electrons and holes. The large difference found between the two compounds can be ascribed to the perovskite absorption extension towards the near infrared region, with respect to the organic dye, as clearly seen by comparing the absorption spectra and the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the two devices in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Monochromatic time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was investigated using a custom-made time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method. This is a standard procedure for determining the charge generation efficiency in liquid and solid state DSSCs or nanocrystal sensitized solar cells.19,20,22 The technique is based on the comparison between the photoluminescence (PL) decay of sensitizers embedded in a working device and in a reference system, in which the presence of an inert substrate is preventing charge extraction.29,30 Very recently this methodology has been employed for the determination of excitons and/or electron–hole diffusion length in perovskite-based solar cells. In two pioneering reports, the PL-quenching has been associated with the charge extraction in systems containing a flat, thin perovskite layer, coupled with diverse charge extracting materials: n-type, such as PCBM, or p-type, such as Spiro-OMeTAD.31,32 Here, we employed the same methodology to investigate mesostructured devices based on perovskite sensitizers combining a TiO2 matrix and Spiro-OMeTAD as n-type and p-type materials, respectively. Five model samples were manufactured, listed in Table 1, with the intention of separately investigating the active interfaces, with the exception of sample 5 which corresponded to a working solar cell, bearing both TiO2/PERO and PERO/HTM interfaces.

Fig. 2 shows TCSPC luminescence decays collected at the maximum of the PERO emission, for 4 of the 5 model samples described in Table 1.
 Fig. 2  Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) luminescence decays for samples 1, 2, 3 and 5 of Table 1. PL is collected at 770 nm, excited with a 635 nm ps pulsed laser. The instrumental response is also reported (100 ps FWHM). The exponential decays have been fitted with exponential functions (single or double), giving the following lifetimes: 350 ns for Glass/PERO/PMMA; 20 and 320 ns for Al2O3/PERO/PMMA; 4 ns for TiO2/PERO/PMMA and 2 ns for TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD. 
Comparing the PL decay of TiO2/PERO/PMMA and TiO2/PERO/Spiro with the one of Glass/PERO/PMMA, our reference, we can observe that the charge generation in these systems is extremely efficient, as reported and discussed in recent reports.31–33 A very interesting and unusual observation arises from the comparison of the PERO PL decay in Glass/PERO/PMMA and Al2O3/PERO/PMMA, which are supposed to give comparative results as in both cases the sensitizer is sandwiched between insulating materials, preventing charge extraction from the perovskite film. We observed, in fact an additional short living (≈ 20 ns) PL decay component when the perovskite is deposited on Al2O3. An interesting debate concerning the fate of perovskite-excited states is occurring within the scientific community. Up to now, a population of free charges and loosely bound excitons has been hypothesized to coexist in a dynamic equilibrium, established after light absorption.31 Coupling perovskite with diverse active materials, PL quenching was observed and related to the charge extraction, however, we found here that it could also occur in systems where injection cannot take place, and in these cases it could most likely be caused by oxide/perovskite interfacial interactions, as we further discuss and prove throughout this paper.
To directly monitor charge extraction in the investigated systems, we performed continuous wavelength (cw) Photo-Induced Absorption (PIA). In cw-PIA, an on/off monochromatic continuum laser source provides the excitation flux while a white light probes the photo-generated species. Formation and recombination of charge carriers is monitored in the μs–ms time domain. This spectroscopic tool is widely used for the determination of the charge generation efficiency in both liquid electrolyte (LE-) DSSCs and solid state (SS-) DSSCs.5,26,34 In Fig. 3a we compare the PIA spectrum of sample 3 of the initial set with a system containing a D149 sensitizer, replacing PERO.25 The broad negative signal assigned to the (TiO2) electrons is almost two orders of magnitude smaller in the case of PERO compared to D149. Noticeably, the feature is symmetrically present in the in-phase and out-of-phase signal (see Fig. S2†) and this is a recognized fingerprint of long living species. This peculiar observation can be correlated with the TCSPC measurements. PL quenching for TiO2/PERO systems, as in the previously discussed case of Al2O3/PERO, can not be straightforwardly related to a charge extraction, but the exciton dissociation leading to charge generation can occur within the perovskite layer in the presence of an active interface. As a consequence, the weak electron PIA signal, along with very efficient PL quenching, can likely be explained by hypothesizing the formation of a charge reservoir within the perovskite layer at the interface with TiO2. Noticeably, a similar deduction has been drawn for a CH3NH3I3 perovskite sensitizer by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements,35 supporting our hypothesis. Steady state photoluminescence spectra of PERO (peaking at 770 nm) and D149 (peaking at 600 nm) are also reported in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  (a) Photo-induced absorption (PIA) and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TiO2 thin films sensitized with PERO and D149 and covered with thin PMMA insulating layers. The PERO PIA spectrum has a 10× magnification. (b) Photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectra for TiO2 and Al2O3 thin films sensitized with PERO and covered with films of Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. 
In Fig. 3a we attribute the positive feature peaking around the onset of perovskite absorption (765 nm) to the ground state absorption bleaching. 31,32 In fact, it partially disappears when Spiro-OMeTAD is present and regenerates the oxidized perovskite (see Fig. 3b). Contrarily, the negative shoulder peaking at 720 nm is still observed after regeneration. The peculiar shape of the two features, together with the considerable amplitude of the positive peak, might reveal a contribution of the Stark effect superimposing the PIA signal.34,36 This interesting observation, related to the presence of a local electric field affecting molecular electronic transitions, could help to rationalize the charge distribution at the various interfaces of perovskite-based devices and therefore will be subject to quantitative investigations.37 In Fig. 3b, strong oxidized Spiro-OMeTAD features can be observed in the near infrared (NIR) region between 1000 and 1400 nm for sample 4 (Al2O3/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD) and 5 (TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD), with intensities in accordance with reported efficient hole transfer to this HTM.25,38 The spectra in Fig. 3b clearly show differences in two regions: between 850 nm and 1000 nm, where the absorption of injected electrons in the TiO2 device is observable, while no photo-generated species are present in the case of the inert scaffold Al2O3, and in the NIR region (1200–1600 nm) where the presence of such injected electrons shifts the positively charged Spiro-OMeTAD attributable features towards longer wavelengths.25,38
In order to further rationalize transport and recombination mechanisms in our devices, we performed transient photovoltage (TPV) and photocurrent (TPC, Fig. S3†) measurements. These techniques are widely employed for the determination of electron lifetimes (τe) in DSSCs. For a cell held at an open-circuit voltage (Voc), the carrier concentrations in the charge-transporting matrix vary by applying a tunable bias light, while a short weak pulse determines an additional amount of generated charge. The transient photovoltage associated with this population perturbation is related to electron recombination processes.24,27 The extracted τe is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the open-circuit voltage on complete working devices. The electron recombination lifetime is calculated by fitting the transient photovoltage decay with single or double exponential functions, depending on the sample, as clarified in the results discussion. In this case the TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD device (sample 5) is compared with a conventional LE-DSSC: TiO2/D149/iodine-based electrolyte, and a SS-DSSC: TiO2/D149/Spiro-OMeTAD,21,25 both bearing the same dye, with the intention of comparing the kinetics as a function of the charge generation/recombination mechanisms involved. The decrease in τe at a higher open-circuit voltage is attributed to a relatively faster recombination. This is usually observed in DSSCs and it is caused by the increased concentration of electrons in the TiO2 conduction band at a higher light intensity and device potential.
 Fig. 4  Electron lifetime as a function of the open-circuit voltage, derived from the exponential fitting of transient photovoltage decays at modulated light intensity. Three sensitized solar cells are compared: conventional liquid electrolyte (LE-) dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC): TiO2/D149/iodine-based electrolyte (red, rhombus), solid state (SS-) DSSC: TiO2/D149/Spiro-OMeTAD (blue, triangles) and the perovskite solar cell: TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD (green, squares; cyan, small squares). For the perovskite-based solar cell we report both the fast and the slow components of the transient photovoltage decay fitting. Inset: normalized transient photovoltage curves of Voc for TiO2/D149/iodine-based electrolyte (red), TiO2/D149/Spiro-OMeTAD (blue) and TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD (green). 
Electron lifetimes are found to be noticeably different in the diverse devices examined here. The mechanism for electron capturing in LE-DSSCs involves multi electron processes and it is known to be much slower than that in solid state devices.27 The two solid state solar cells differ only in the presence of the perovskite layer replacing the organic dye in between TiO2 and HTM, therefore, perovskite is likely playing an active role in the recombination dynamics. Interestingly, the perovskite-based device TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD is the only device for which the transient photovoltage decay is well fitted by a bi-exponential curve (see inset Fig. 4) instead of a single exponential curve. This observation suggests the presence of two distinguished populations of generated carriers, recombining independently. The charge population bearing a long lifetime is attributable to the electrons transported through the TiO2 matrix to the FTO anode. Two evidences support this consideration: first, its similarity to the curve of the SS-DSSC reference,39 and, second, the complete PIA spectrum showing a weak, long living signal attributable to the TiO2 electrons (see S2 figure already discussed above and S3†). The short TPV decay component observed in TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD device is the fastest decay observed for the investigated set, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the LE-DSSC and about one order of magnitude faster than the SS-DSSC. We associate this component with the charge confined within the perovskite layer recombining with holes in HTM. This attribution is based on the interconnection of all the previous observations: a high PL quenching leading to high charge generation, associated, however, to a very small TiO2 electron absorption in the PIA analysis. Thus, to justify the high device performances, carriers are required to reach the FTO electrode within the perovskite itself. Furthermore, we highlight that the charge collection dynamic needs to be very fast in order to assure high device performances, considering the high recombination rates deduced from TPV. Such a fast transport, already reported by other recent investigations,5,40 has been proven with a transient photocurrent measurement (see Fig. S4†). The peculiar combination of a short recombination lifetime and a fast transport assures high collection efficiency and good device performances. The TiO2/perovskite interface in HTM-free devices has recently been rationalized with the formation of a depletion layer.19 The collection of our results depicts, however, an unusual behavior for charge dynamics in perovskite-sensitized solar cells bearing Spiro-OMeTAD as a hole conductor. The presence of two n-type materials in the system, TiO2 and perovskite, generates alternative paths for electron transport, compatible with the formation of a charge accumulation layer in the perovskite film, recently proven for a similar device layout by Kim et al.35 Further studies need to focus on the nature of this interface transport layer and on the mechanisms through which the charge is transported within it.
Conclusions
In summary, a (CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx perovskite coupled with a TiO2 mesoporous substrate and Spiro-OMeTAD as a solid state hole transporting material was spectroscopically investigated. Time correlated single photon counting proved efficient PL quenching for PERO deposited on TiO2 and fast PERO/HTM hole transfer. We demonstrated that efficient PL quenching in these devices is not straightforwardly related to electron injection in the TiO2, as is commonly formed in solid state DSSCs, but can additionally be caused by oxide–perovskite interactions. Photoinduced absorption and transient photovoltage performed on working devices described a double charge recombination dynamic that we attribute to the existence of an electron percolation channel present within the perovskite film, which is alternative to the TiO2 mediated collection. The two paths are proven to complementarily contribute to the photocurrent as demonstrated by the high efficiency obtained for the PERO-based device. The proposed model for the charge collection mechanism in perovskite mesostructured devices would prefigure experimental findings not aligned with those expected for classical SS-DSSCs, highlighting the need of a specific approach for systems including this material, both in terms of data interpretation and device development.

Broader context
The recent employment of self-assembling hybrid halide perovskites in full solid state sensitized solar cells has signified a substantial advancement for third generation photovoltaic devices, allowing record efficiencies up to 15% for low cost and stable devices. Interestingly, perovskites are easy to process and their physical properties can be widely tuned through material composition and preparation condition variations. Because of these properties, perovskites are ideal candidates as key constituents of photovoltaic devices. In this context, however, only few studies have been dedicated to the comprehension of photoinduced charge generation and transport. We report a detailed spectroscopic investigation aiming at understanding the charge dynamics in (CH3NH3)PbI3−xClx sensitized mesostructured solar cells. Through the analysis of model systems and devices, we suggest a peculiar working mechanism. According to experimental evidence, a double path for charge transport is proposed, allowing electron percolation in both TiO2 and perovskite media. In the context of this rapidly expanding research front, our study aims to underline the need of a specific investigating approach and device design of perovskite-based devices, as they differ substantially from classical solid state dye sensitized devices.

 	Fig. 2  Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) luminescence decays for samples 1, 2, 3 and 5 of Table 1. PL is collected at 770 nm, excited with a 635 nm ps pulsed laser. The instrumental response is also reported (100 ps FWHM). The exponential decays have been fitted with exponential functions (single or double), giving the following lifetimes: 350 ns for Glass/PERO/PMMA; 20 and 320 ns for Al2O3/PERO/PMMA; 4 ns for TiO2/PERO/PMMA and 2 ns for TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photo-induced absorption (PIA) and steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TiO2 thin films sensitized with PERO and D149 and covered with thin PMMA insulating layers. The PERO PIA spectrum has a 10× magnification. (b) Photo-induced absorption (PIA) spectra for TiO2 and Al2O3 thin films sensitized with PERO and covered with films of Spiro-OMeTAD HTM.	 

 	Fig. 4  Electron lifetime as a function of the open-circuit voltage, derived from the exponential fitting of transient photovoltage decays at modulated light intensity. Three sensitized solar cells are compared: conventional liquid electrolyte (LE-) dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC): TiO2/D149/iodine-based electrolyte (red, rhombus), solid state (SS-) DSSC: TiO2/D149/Spiro-OMeTAD (blue, triangles) and the perovskite solar cell: TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD (green, squares; cyan, small squares). For the perovskite-based solar cell we report both the fast and the slow components of the transient photovoltage decay fitting. Inset: normalized transient photovoltage curves of Voc for TiO2/D149/iodine-based electrolyte (red), TiO2/D149/Spiro-OMeTAD (blue) and TiO2/PERO/Spiro-OMeTAD (green).
