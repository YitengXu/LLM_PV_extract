    First published on 29th March 2020AbstractRoom-temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are regarded as promising candidates for smart grids and large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) due to their significant benefits of abundant and low-cost sodium resource. Among the previously reported cathode materials for SIBs, layered transition-metal oxides and polyanion-type materials are considered to be the most attractive options. Although many layered transition-metal oxides can provide high capacity due to their small molecular weight, their further application is hindered by low output voltage (mostly lower than 3.5 V), irreversible phase transition as well as storage instability. Comparatively, polyanion-type materials exhibit higher operating potentials due to the inductive effect of polyanion groups. Their robust 3D framework significantly decreases the structural variations during sodium ion de/intercalation. Moreover, the effect of strong X–O (X = S, P, Si, etc.) covalent bonds can effectively inhibit oxygen evolution. These advantages contribute to the superior cycle stability and high safety of polyanion-type materials. However, low electronic conductivity and limited capacity still restrict their further application. This review summarizes the recent progress of polyanion-type materials for SIBs, which include phosphates, fluorophosphates, pyrophosphates, mixed phosphates, sulfates, and silicates. We also discuss the remaining challenges and corresponding strategies for polyanion-type materials. We hope this review can provide some insights into the development of polyanionic materials.

1. Introduction
For a long time, fossil fuels have supplied the main energy needs. However, their excessive consumption, along with the resulting environmental pollution, has made it an urgent issue to look for renewable and clean energy sources, such as solar, wind and tidal energy. Nevertheless, these energy sources are intermittent because they are highly dependent on environmental factors, e.g. weather, location and season. So far, energy storage systems (ESSs) have been considered to be superior candidates to integrate these intermittent energies into a continuous, stable and controllable electrical grid.1 Among various ESSs, the secondary battery technique is one of the most promising methods to store electricity due to the properties of good flexibility, high energy conversion efficiency and simple maintenance.2 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become primary candidates for energy storage since their first commercialization by Sony in the 1990s.3 Recently, LIBs have achieved great commercial success in electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), especially in portable electronic devices (e.g. laptops, cellphones etc.). With the development of electric vehicles in recent years, the demand for LIBs has skyrocketed. But unfortunately, the element lithium (Li) is rare (20 ppm) and unevenly distributed on the Earth.4 Sodium (Na) possesses similar physical and chemical properties to Li because they are in the same main group in the periodic table. In contrast to Li, Na is the fifth-most abundant element on the earth's crust. These properties of Na make sodium ion batteries (SIBs) ideal substitutes for LIBs, especially with great potential for application in large-scale ESSs (such as smart grids, electric vehicles, etc.).5,6 Despite the numerous advantages of SIBs, there are still various challenges for their commercialization. For instance, the much higher molecular weight of Na (23 g mol−1) relative to Li (6.94 g mol−1) and the higher redox potential of Na+/Na than Li+/Li (−2.71 V and −3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) lead to a lower energy density of SIBs. The calculation of theoretical energy density can be depicted in eqn (1) (1)where E is the theoretical energy density, Q is the specific capacity, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, V is the potential, and M is the molecular weight of the material. It can be found that increasing both the full-cell potential (V) and capacity (Q) is critical to improving the energy density of batteries. The output voltage of a battery is on account of the difference of potentials between the anodes and cathodes. For the anodes, hard carbon has been successfully applied and its performance is already comparable to that of graphite in LIBs.7 However, the development of cathodes is relatively sluggish. Therefore, developing suitable cathode materials with high capacity and voltage is critical to increasing the energy density of SIBs.
Up to now, layered metal oxides (NaxTMO2, 0 < x ≤ 1, TM = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, etc.) and polyanion-type materials have become the most widely researched cathodes for SIBs. Although some layered oxides can deliver high capacity, they generally exhibit the low voltage which not higher than 3.5 V.8 This drawback severely limits their energy density. In contrast, polyanion-type materials possess higher operating potential, stable structural framework, and superior safety.9 Thus, they are regarded as one of the most promising cathode materials in SIBs. Nevertheless, some bottlenecks still hinder their practical application, such as the limited capacity and low electric conductivity.
In this review, we summarized the recent progress of polyanion-type materials, mainly including phosphates, pyrophosphates, fluorophosphates, sulfates, and silicates. We especially focus on the design of materials, the characterization of reaction mechanisms, and strategies for improving electrochemical performance. Moreover, some new perspectives on materials synthesis and reaction mechanisms are discussed. In addition, the challenges and bottlenecks of polyanion-type materials are also highlighted. Through these discussions, we attempt to provide some insights into the research and application of polyanion-type materials for SIBs.
2. The structure of polyanion-type electrode materials
Polyanion-type electrode materials, NaxMy(XO4)n (X = S, P, Si, As, Mo, and W; M = transition metal), possess a series of tetrahedron anion units (XO4)n− and their derivatives (XmO3m+1)n−, in which strong covalent bonds exist in MOx polyhedra.9,10 There are mainly three characteristics of polyanion-type cathode materials, which can be concluded as follows:
(i) High redox potential
It is generally considered that the high redox potential of polyanion-type cathode results from the unique inductive effect. According to the molecular orbital principles, the covalent interaction between M and O leads to the split of molecular orbitals and the formation of bonding orbitals and antibonding orbitals. When the covalency between M–O becomes stronger, the splitting energy between antibonding and bonding orbitals will be higher and the electrons tend to fill in the bonding orbitals. This raises the antibonding orbitals and the energy difference between antibonding orbitals and vacuum (Δ) becomes smaller and hence will result in a lower redox potential. But when another strong electronegativity atom X is introduced to form M–O–X bonds, the covalent bond in M–O will be weakened and then Δ will become larger, thus leading to the high voltage.11 To further increase the redox voltage, stronger electronegativity groups (such as F−, OH−) have been introduced to increase the inductive effect, like the widely studied fluorinated phosphates.
(ii) High thermal stability
Oxygen atoms are linked by strong covalent bonds in the polyanion-type crystal structure. Thus, polyanion-type cathodes possess higher thermal stability than layered transition metal oxides, which ensure them better safety properties in large-scale applications.
(iii) Low electrical conductivity
Polyanion-type electrode materials possess intrinsic low electrical conductivity. This drawback is caused by their distinctive structures, which involve electronic interactions of the XO4 anion units during reactions. Take the NASICON–Na3V2(PO4)3 as an example, no oxygen atom is shared between the VO6 octahedra while they are shared in the PO4 tetrahedron. This makes the electron-transfer follow a V–O–P–O–V pattern, rather than the faster V–O–V pattern. Therefore, numerous research studies are committed to improving the conductivity through various strategies, such as carbon coating, reducing the particle size, designing the optimal morphology, and so on.12,13
3. Recent progress of polyanionic materials
3.1. Phosphates

3.1.1. NaMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn). 
After the successful commercialization of LiFePO4, it is reasonable to consider its sodium analogue NaFePO4 for SIBs. The NaFePO4 was found to possess two distinct phases, olivine and maricite.14,15 Frameworks of both polymorphs are constructed by slightly distorted FeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. In the olivine phase, the corner-shared FeO6 units are connected with PO4, building a one-dimensional sodium migration tunnel along the b-axis (Fig. 1a). While for the maricite phase, neighboring FeO6 units are edge-shared, and then linked with PO4 in a corner-sharing manner (Fig. 1b and c). Obviously, there is no sodium diffusion channel in maricite NaFePO4, thus it is considered electrochemically inactive. However, the maricite phase has been proven to be thermodynamically favored. Moreau et al. studied the structure and the thermal stability of olivine NaFePO4.15In situ X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1d) show that the olivine phase transforms into maricite phases in the high-temperature region (500 °C < T < 600 °C). Since it needs cumbersome processes to directly synthesize the olivine NaFePO4, the logical and general strategy is through cation exchange from olivine LiFePO4.15,16 Unlike lithium insertion/extraction in LiFePO4, however, the sodium exchange reaction in FePO4 (olivine Pnma) presents two steps that are separated by a voltage drop with the formation of an intermediate Na0.7FePO4 phase (Fig. 2a), which can be related to Na+ ordering in the crystal structure.15,17 The reaction mechanism of olivine NaFePO4 was exhaustively investigated by Cabanas's group.18,19 They attribute the appearance of intermediate phase Na2/3FePO4 to the strong volumetric variation (17.58%) between the two end members of the system (from NaFePO4 to FePO4). The phase diagram of NaxFePO4 (0 < x < 1) during the reaction was calculated (Fig. 2b). The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results also demonstrate that NaxFePO4 is stable at x = 2/3, which leads to the 0.16 V voltage increase in the charge profile. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) has confirmed that the typical asymmetrical voltage profile of the olivine NaFePO4 is derived from a different reaction path (Fig. 2c).18,20 The desodiation process involves a single-phase reaction until the Na0.7FePO4 phase appears at voltage discontinuity, and a two-phase reaction between a Na-rich NayFePO4 phase and a Na-deficient FePO4 phase. However, the sodiation process is more complex, with the simultaneous existence of three phases with varying miscibility limits.18 Sun et al. reported the electrochemical performance of NaFePO4, which demonstrates remarkable electrochemical properties, with a working voltage of 2.7 V and a discharge capacity of 125 mA h g−1.16 Further optimizations on morphology,21,22 electrolyte systems,23etc. were conducted to improve the performance of NaFePO4. DFT calculations were employed to disclose the relation between performance and structure.19,24,25 An atomistic simulation conducted by Nazar's group demonstrates that the superior capability of NaFePO4 should be linked to the low activation energy barrier for Na-ion conduction in the olivine framework along the 1D channels, which is even lower than that of Li-ion migration in LiFePO4.24 Recently, Xiang et al. proposed a new strain-accommodation mechanism on olivine NaFePO4 by using synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction (PXD) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis.26 They discovered a third amorphous phase. The reason why previous works did not find this phase is probably the short-range order over ∼1 nm is not detectable by powder diffraction alone. The PDF analysis of xNa = 0.3 and xNa = 0.6 has proved that a three-phase structure model can offer a good fit to the data (Fig. 2d), and the amorphous phase with no distinct lattice fringe has also been detected by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2e).26 It is suggested that the amorphous phase can buffer large lattice variation between the pristine and end phases, alleviating large transformation strains, and thus enabling better cycling stability.

Maricite NaFePO4, the thermodynamically stable phase, has been regarded as electrochemically inactive. In 2014, for the first time, the maricite NaFePO4 was reported to operate as an excellent cathode material by Kim et al.27 This work proved that Na ions can be extracted from the nano-sized maricite NaFePO4, with simultaneous transformation into amorphous FePO4. The maricite NaFePO4 and amorphous FePO4 delivered an impressive capacity of 142 mA h g−1 and showed excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of 95% after 200 cycles (Fig. 3a).27 The transformation from maricite NaFePO4 to amorphous FePO4 (a-FePO4) (Fig. 3b) is vital to the enhanced electrochemical activity. Quantum mechanics calculations indicate that the diffusion of Na ions in the maricite framework has relatively high energy barriers, making Na diffusion quite difficult at room temperature (Fig. 3d). While in the a-FePO4 phase, activation energy along the Na1–Na2–Na3–Na4/Na5 path is below 0.73 eV, which is around one-fourth of the energy barrier in maricite NaFePO4 (Fig. 3e).27Fig. 3f schematically presents the electrochemical mechanism of maricite NaFePO4 during charge/discharge process. This work provided a new strategy to improve the electrochemical activity of cathode materials. Li et al. boosted the kinetics of NaFePO4 by synthesizing hollow amorphous NaFePO4 nanospheres,28 which exhibit a long lifespan of over 300 cycles and good rate capability of up to 10C. Recently, Fan et al.21 used electrospinning to embed amorphous NaFePO4 nanoparticles into porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (Fig. 3j). When the cathode is charged and held at 4.7 V for 12 h, the XRD peaks completely disappeared, which indicates that the maricite phase has changed into an amorphous phase (Fig. 3h). NaFePO4@C demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance, with an ultra-high rate capability of 61 mA h g−1 at 50C as well as excellent cyclic stability of 89% capacity retention after 6300 cycles (Fig. 3i).

Actually, before the discovery of nano-sized amorphous NaFePO4, amorphous FePO4 has been investigated for both LIBs and SIBs and has demonstrated excellent electrochemical properties.29–33 Compared with crystalline FePO4, the amorphous phase FePO4 shows free volume to mitigate lattice distortions. Okada's group evaluated electrochemical performance of amorphous FePO4 for SIBs, which showed a large capacity loss in the initial cycle.33 The Fe Mössbauer spectra show that the low-spin Fe(II) remained at about 30% even when the cathode was charged to 4.0 V, which should be the result of insufficient reversibility. Mathew et al.34 synthesized a porous amorphous FePO4 as a host for Li, Na, and K ions. The obtained material can deliver a remarkable specific capacity of 179 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1. It is found that there is an amorphous-to-crystalline transition during the sodium insertion/extraction processes, which was identified by ex situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and TEM characterizations.
Highly conductive carbon is generally obtained by high-temperature treatment; however, high temperature calcination can induce the formation of crystalline FePO4. So, strategies such as in situ carbon-coating could be unsuitable for amorphous FePO4. In this context, a majority of work has been devoted to boost its electrochemical performance via introducing conductive carbon materials.29,35,36 Hu et al. wired porous FePO4 nanoparticles with single-walled carbon nanotubes, achieving a capacity retention of ∼75.8% after 300 cycles.35 Pan's group combined amorphous FePO4 sheets with carbon black.36 The obtained material shows a high reversible capacity of 168.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 92.3% after 1000 cycles. Note that FePO4 is Na-vacant, therefore the fabrication of full cells may need a pre-sodiation process, which is inconvenient for practical applications. The Na-containing amorphous phase should be further explored in the future.
NaMnPO4 also possesses olivine and maricite phases, and both structures have been deeply researched.37–39 In the olivine phase, Na containing octahedra share edges and form zigzag chains along the b axis for Na+ diffusion. However, the Na+ mobility is blocked in the maricite structure, which is the thermally stable phase. The olivine phase does not show favorable electrochemical performance. Although many synthesis methods, including ion-exchange,37,39 phosphate-format precursor method,39 and topotactic molten salt reaction,38etc. have been adopted to optimize it, investigation on the mechanism of NaMnPO4 is still relatively rare. To fully understand electrochemical properties of NaMnPO4, strategies such as carbon-coating would be needed.


3.1.2. NASICON-structured materials. 
Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)-structured materials represent a family of important electrode materials due to their great structural stability, as well as superior ionic conductivity. Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), the first NASICON material, was reported as a solid-state electrolyte by Goodenough et al. in the 1960s.40 Since the structure of Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 exhibits the capability to accommodate many kinds of alkali metal ions, it is considered to be a promising electrode material. The formula of NASICON-structured material can be defined as NaxM2(XO4)3 (1≤ x ≤ 4; M = V, Fe, Ni, Mn, Ti, Cr, Zr, etc.; X = P, S, Si, Se, Mo, etc.). Each MO6 octahedron is connected with three tetrahedral XO4 units, forming a “lantern” unit, which further constructs the three-dimensional framework with large interstices (Fig. 4a). Both the cation M and anion X are tunable and replaceable in this structure, thus offering great versatility for material engineering.41–43 By virtue of the distinctive robust structure with Na migration channels, many NASICON materials have been explored and have demonstrated satisfactory rate capability and cycling stability.

3.1.2.1. Single transition metal type. 
NASICON–Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) crystallizes to a rhombohedral structure with a Rc space group, where VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are interlinked in a corner-sharing fashion, building a three-dimensional framework with two different Na crystallographic sites.44,45 The Na1 sites with six-fold coordination (6b) are occupied by one Na ion, while the other Na2 sites with eightfold coordination (18e) are occupied by two Na ions. Only the Na+ located in the Na2 sites can be extracted from the structure, contributing to a theoretical capacity of 117 mA h g−1 with a flat plateau located at 3.3 V.44,46–48 In addition to the rhombohedral phase, Na3V2(PO4)3 was found to present four distinct crystal structures at temperatures from −30 °C to 225 °C (Fig. 4b).49 The high temperature γ-NVP adopts a classical rhombohedral Rc phase, while the low temperature α-NVP phase adopts a monoclinic C2/c phase, and two incommensurate monoclinic structures (β-, β′-phase) can be found around room temperature (Fig. 4c). Below 178 °C, the γ-NVP was reported to undergo a monoclinic distortion. These investigations on material phases are fundamental to electrochemical performance. Na3V2(PO4)3 was found to possess great sodium storage capabilities under different voltage ranges (Fig. 5a and b).44 Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Pivko et al.50 confirmed that the platform at 3.3 V derives from the V3+/V4+ redox in Na3V2(PO4)3 by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 5c and d). Meanwhile, electron paramagnetic resonance was employed to determine the local environment of Na3V2(PO4)3 at different charge states. Vanadium K edge-EXAFS results (Fig. 5e) showed that there are only small changes in the average bond length between vanadium and oxygen atoms during cycling processes, implying the rigid and stable structure of Na3V2(PO4)3. Note that, since the electrochemical reaction corresponding to the V5+/V4+ redox couple is hard to realize, the electrochemical extraction of Na+ in Na1 sites has not yet been realized. However, when the discharge cut-off voltage is lower than 1.5 V, additional Na+ ions can be intercalated at Na2 sites, and another platform at 1.6 V appears on account of the redox of V3+/V2+ (Fig. 5b).44,51 Due to the multiple valence of vanadium ions, NVP can be used as both cathode and anode. The reaction mechanism of NVP has been deeply investigated. Chen et al. studied the structure and kinetics of NaxV2(PO4)3 at the atomic level by annular-bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ABF-STEM) technologies.52 It is found that NVP possesses a stable framework without any noticeable changes after sodium extraction, and the result of NMR spectroscopy further confirmed that Na+ in Na1 sites was immobile and was only active in Na2 sites, suggesting a Na2–Na2 migration pattern. The first exploration of Na-ion migration behavior in NVP was conducted by Song et al.53 DFT calculations unveil a three-dimensional transport that comprises two pathways along the x and y directions and one possible curved route for Na migration (Fig. 5f). Recently, Wang et al.54 suggested a concerted ion-exchange route for Na migration, where the Na ions at both Na1 and Na2 sites are engaged in the transportation, which is different from the Na2–Na2 pattern (Fig. 5g). Chen's group also disclosed the biphasic reaction between Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 by in situ XRD (Fig. 5h).55 The calculated overall volume change is approximately 8.26%, which is comparable to LiFePO4. Yamada's group clarified the microscopic mechanism of the biphasic reaction through the potentiometric method.45 In practical circumstances, batteries are supposed to be faced with various conditions, such as changes in temperature and current density. Recent work from Mai's group demonstrates that at a high scan rate or low temperature, the phase evolution process of NVP adopts a one-phase solid solution reaction rather than the traditional two-phase reaction (Fig. 5i).56 This work may help to understand the phase evolution process and guide battery design under various working conditions.

Apart from investigations on the sodium storage mechanism, extensive efforts have also been made to overcome inferior electronic conductivity and boost electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3.57–62 Among various strategies, carbon coating is regarded as an effective one. Jian et al.55 used sugar as the carbon source and successfully coated a 6 nm carbon layer on the surface of Na3V2(PO4)3. The Na3V2(PO4)3/C exhibits a reversible capacity of 93 mA h g−1 with enhanced cycling stability. Recently, constructing a hierarchical structure is greatly effective in solving this problem. The main principles for structural design can be summarized as: (i) reducing particle size to shorten Na+ diffusion length; (ii) combining with a conductive network to enable fast electron transport and buffer the volume variation caused by Na insertion/extraction. For instance, Yu's group employed a facile soft-chemistry method with post-heat-treatment, realizing a structure of carbon-coated nano-Na3V2(PO4)3 embedded in a porous carbon matrix ((C@NVP)@pC).63 The composite material can be charged/discharged within 6 s under an ultra-high current density of 200C and deliver a specific capacity of 44 mA h g−1, which is even higher than those of LiCoO2 and LiFePO4. They also designed similar composites, such as rGO framework hosted Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (NVP@C@rGO)64 (Fig. 6a). This material demonstrates outstanding rate capability of up to 100C due to the enhanced electrode kinetics (Fig. 6b and c). Cao et al.65 adopted a cost-effective chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to construct the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 particles embedded in a hierarchical carbon framework (HCF-NVP), in which the hierarchical carbon framework contains graphene-like coating layers and interconnected nanofibers. The synthesis process is displayed in Fig. 6d. The HCF-NVP electrode exhibits a reversible capacity close to its theoretical value at 0.2C, superior high-rate capability reaching 500C, and ultra-long cycling stability with 54% capacity retention after 20000 cycles at 30C (Fig. 6e). Additionally, metal ion-doping is another effective way to improve the electrochemical properties of NVP. The impacts of Fe2+, Mn2+, Al3+, Cr3+ doping in Na3V2(PO4)3 have been systematically studied by Tirado's group.66–69 Inoishi et al. found that Mg2+ doped Na3.2V1.8Mg0.2(PO4)3 possesses higher reversible capacity than the pure phase due to the partial redox of V5+/V4+.70 The Mg-rich sample Na3.5V1.5Mg0.5(PO4)3 shows a more remarkable plateau for the V5+/V4+ redox. However, it presents lower capacity, because of the irreversibility in the V5+/V4+ redox region. Meng et al.71 further probed the mechanism for the cation doping by virtue of first-principles calculations. The results demonstrate that Mg2+ prefers to occupy the V site and then extra electrochemically active Na+ ions are successfully introduced to compensate charge. Moreover, experimental data indicate that Mg2+ ions are distributed on the surface of Na3V2(PO4)3/C particles (Fig. 6f), thus leading to the excellent rate performance of the Mg-rich phase material. Huang's group introduced high valence Mo6+ into Na3V2(PO4)3, and proved that Na+ diffusion can be promoted in Na2.9V1.98Mo0.02(PO4)3 by virtue of DFT calculations.72 Different from doping in transition-metal sites, Wang et al. doped Li, K, Ca, Mg, and Al in the Na1 sites.54 DFT calculations show that the K-doped NVP possesses the highest voltage and lowest lattice variation during sodium storage processes. Anions can also be used as another dopant. A series of B substituted Na3V2P3−xBxO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were studied by Cui's group.73 The results show that B in Na3V2P3−xBxO12 can significantly enhance the structural stability and electrochemical performance (Fig. 6g and h). This is because B in the material could change local element valence, resulting in the adjacent polyhedron geometry distortion, which can decrease the band gap and facilitate the diffusion of Na+.

Besides the vanadium-based NASICON type materials, other single transition-metal type materials (such as Na3Fe2(PO4)374,75 and Na3Cr2(PO4)376) have also been explored. Na3Fe2(PO4)3 crystallizes into a monoclinic structure with the space group of C2/c. Rajagopalan et al.74 investigated the reversible nature of the Fe4+/Fe3+ redox couple in Na3Fe2(PO4)3/C, which delivers a discharge capacity of 109 mA h g−1. Liu et al.75 disclosed the two-phase reaction by ex situ XRD. The average potential of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is relatively low (<3.0 V), which may hinder its application. Electrochemical properties of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 were unveiled by Yamada's group.76 Na3Cr2(PO4)3 can be indexed to a rhombohedral lattice with the space group Rc. Based on the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox reaction, it exhibits a flat plateau at 4.5 V with a discharge capacity of about 80 mA h g−1. Note that such a working voltage is almost the highest value among various cathodes of sodium-ion batteries. However, Na3Cr2(PO4)3 suffers from limited capacity and fast capacity decay, which needs further optimization.
3.1.2.2. Binary transition metal type. 
Recently, NASICON-type materials with binary transition metals have attracted increasing attention. Since V is toxic and expensive, V substitution or exploring vanadium-free materials could be a new option. Due to the flexible atomic arrangement and synergistic effect of different transition metals, NaxM1M2(PO4)3 (M1 and M2 represent different transition metal elements) possess interesting electrochemical properties. Mason et al. substituted half of the vanadium in Na3V2(PO4)3 with titanium, for the first time, and successfully synthesized NASICON–Na2VTi(PO4)3.77 In contrast to other vanadium compounds that suffer from a degradative oxidation process in aqueous systems, NASICON–Na2VTi(PO4)3 demonstrates enhanced cycling stability with a capacity retention of 70% over 1000 cycles at 10C.78 It is suggested that the Ti-substitution can prevent crystal structure from degradation and vanadium dissolution due to the polarizing effect of Ti atoms and/or the lower redox potential, reducing the rate of side reactions. Wang et al.79 studied the electrochemical performance of Na2VTi(PO4)3 in an organic electrolyte system, finding that it can deliver a high specific capacity of 147 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V. Three distinctive plateaus can be found at 3.4, 2.1 and 1.6 V, which correspond to the redox of V4+/V3+, Ti4+/Ti3+ and V3+/V2+, respectively (Fig. 7a). The symmetric full cell based on Na2VTi(PO4)3 demonstrates superior rate capability of up to 20C and ultra-long lifespan of over 10000 cycles. Detailed phase evolutions have been probed by Masquelier et al.80 Operando XRD indicates that the reaction between Na2TiV(PO4)3 and NaTiV(PO4)3 occurring at 3.33 V adopts a highly reversible two-phase mechanism (Fig. 7b). While the reduction from Na2TiV(PO4)3 to Na4TiV(PO4)3 is more complex, which includes several successive two-phase and single-phase steps corresponding to the redox of Ti3+/Ti2+ and V3+/V2+, respectively. Besides, an intermediate composition Na3TiV(PO4)3 was formed during the reaction (Fig. 7c). Due to the suitable voltage gap between V4+/V3+ and Ti4+/Ti3+, Na2TiV(PO4)3 can be used as both cathode and anode. Deng's group81 synthesized cross-linked Na2VTi(PO4)3@C hierarchical nanofibers as bi-functional electrodes for symmetric aqueous SIBs (Fig. 7d). The full cell exhibits a flat potential plateau of ∼1.2 V, superior rate performance (Fig. 7e) and stable long-term cycling with 83% of capacity retention after 600 cycles at alternate 40 and 4C (Fig. 7f). Zhang et al.82 found that the concentrated aqueous electrolyte of 9.2 M NaCF3SO3 (NaOTF) enabled construction of a stable solid/liquid interface of Na2VTi(PO4)3, enabling stable cycling at 20C for 1000 cycles without capacity decay (Fig. 7g).

The NASICON-type Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is isostructural with Na3V2(PO4)3, adopting a rhombohedral lattice with the space group Rc.83,84 The three-dimensional framework is based on MnO6 or TiO6 octahedra sharing with PO4 tetrahedra. Goodenough's group firstly reported the electrochemical properties of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 in aqueous symmetric SIBs.84 They found that the oxidation from Na3MnTi(PO4)3 to Na2MnTi(PO4)3 based on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox is well below the oxygen evolution potential, and the reduction to Na4MnTi(PO4)3 through the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox is above the hydrogen evolution potential. With one electron reaction, the symmetric cell can deliver a reversible capacity of 58.4 mA h g−1 at 0.5C. Additionally, they demonstrated that in organic systems, the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple can be realized in a voltage range of 2.5–4.2 V, contributing a platform above 4.0 V (Fig. 8a). Based on the two-electron reaction, the theoretical capacity of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 can reach 117 mA h g−1.83 Recently, Mai's group85 synthesized Na3MnTi(PO4)3/C hollow microspheres through the spray-drying method. Na3MnTi(PO4)3/C delivers a high reversible capacity of 160 mA h g−1 at 0.2C in the voltage window of 1.5–4.2 V, accompanied by a three-electron reaction (Fig. 8b). In situ XRD reveals that solid-solution and two-phase reactions are involved during the reaction (Fig. 8c).

A series of NASICON–NaxMV(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni) materials have also been unveiled by Goodenough's group.86 Rietveld refinements show that statistically, the octahedral transition-metal sites are equally occupied by V and M. Na4MnV(PO4)3 adopts a Rc trigonal structure, where two types of independent Na ions are located in the interstitial space of the framework, one for 6-fold coordination (Na1), and the other one for 10-fold coordination (Na2) per formula unit.86 There is a small difference in the structure of Na3FeV(PO4)3 because a cooperative distortion of the FeO6 octahedron distorts the crystal structure to monoclinic.86 Both of the two materials demonstrate multidimensional Na+ migration pathways, which was confirmed by aberration-corrected STEM. The Na3FeV(PO4)3 presented two platforms centered at ∼3.3 V and ∼2.5 V, which can be attributed to the redox of V4+/V3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ couples, respectively. This material also exhibited outstanding rate capability and stability, with 95% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C.86 Na4MnV(PO4)3 presents a higher potential at 3.6 V based on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple. Nevertheless, the relatively sluggish Mn diffusion limits its electrochemical performance. Zhang et al.87 designed a graphene aerogel supported Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanograin structure and successfully boosted its reversible capacity to 109 mA h g−1 and rate capability to 50C. The energy density of Na4MnV(PO4)3 should be further improved if the V5+/V4+ redox can be realized in this structure. Masquelier et al.88 reported that a charge capacity of 156 mA h g−1 can be obtained in Na4MnV(PO4)3 when the cutoff voltage increased to 4.3 V and activated V5+/V4+ redox. Nevertheless, operando XRD showed irreversible structural evolution during the first cycle, leading to a large capacity loss. Zakharkin et al.89 investigated the structural evolution of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in different voltage ranges (Fig. 8d). Cycling within the 2.5–3.8 V potential range leads to a solid solution reaction in the first step and a two-phase process from monoclinic to rhombohedral in the second step. The overall process is reversible. However, in the case of the 4.0 V, after changing to the rhombohedral phase, the discharge process shows a solid solution mechanism, which is different from the charge process.89 These results indicate that the activation of the V5+/V4+ redox couple in Na4MnV(PO4)3 is unstable, which is imperative to address in the future.
Very recently, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 was proposed as a high voltage cathode by Gao et al.90 It also adopts a rhombohedral Rc structure, where the interstitial sites accommodate three different types of Na+ ions: the six-fold coordination Na1 sites, eight-fold coordination Na2 sites, and the four-coordinate Na3 sites. Both Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples are reversible in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, exhibiting high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V with a high reversible capacity of 105 mA h g−1. Ex situ XRD demonstrates a reversible two-phase variation with a small volume change (5.5%), which is vital to long cycling stability (Fig. 8e and f). Notably, structural analysis and density functional theory calculations prove that, although the MnO6 sites are distorted on the local scale, the lack of long-range ordering of the Na2 sites implies that cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ can be suppressed in the cathode (Fig. 8g). Thus the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 presents satisfactory cycling stability,90 which may inspire the exploration of new Mn-based NASICON-type material for SIBs.


3.1.3. Layer-structured phosphates. 
The two-dimensional layered structure is expected to have better sodium storage performance due to large interlayer space for facile sodium diffusion. Recently, a variety of V-based phosphates with a layered structure have been reported. VOPO4 is considered to be a promising cathode for LIBs due to the high potential of the V5+/V4+ redox and high theoretical capacity of 165 mA h g−1.91–93 It presents various structures, in which only α1-VOPO4 possesses a layered structure. The α1-VOPO4 is stabilized to a tetragonal structure with the P4/n symmetry, where PO4 and distorted VO5 polyhedra are alternatively arranged by corner-sharing to form VOPO4 slabs in the ab-plane, and stacks along the c direction.94 It is tricky to synthesize a pure α1-VOPO4 material directly. Manthiram's group, using a strategy of chemical delithiation of α1-LiVOPO4, successfully prepared α1-VOPO4 and reported its electrochemical performance for the first time (Fig. 9a).94 It shows that for SIBs, α1-VOPO4 can offer a plateau at ∼3.5 V with a capacity of ∼110 mA h g−1, which further increases to 150 mA h g−1 after being optimized with reduced graphene oxide. Phase variation process of the material were studied by XRD (Fig. 9b). The bond valence sum (BVS) map suggests that sodium ions are positioned in the space between VOPO4 sheets and the migration of Na ions is primarily in the ab planes.94 Cao's group firstly synthesized layered NaVOPO4 through a facile solvothermal method.95 NaI was used as the reducing agent to reduce the V5+ ions to V4+ ions and provide Na+ to replace lattice water molecules in VOPO4·2H2O, thus forming NaVOPO4. Different from other previously reported NaVOPO4, this layered NaVOPO4 adopts a triclinic lattice (space group P). The group employed in situ SXRD and synchrotron XANES to characterize the sodium-chemistry (Fig. 9c–e). The NaVOPO4 demonstrates a multi-phase reaction process with 8.8% of d-spacing expansion along the c axis. Based on the V5+/V4+ redox, this material has a reversible capacity of 144 mA h g−1 at 0.05C, and a plateau at ∼3.5 V.95 Layered-Na3V(PO4)2 with a monoclinic C2/c space group was reported by Kim et al.96 The VO6 octahedra are corner-shared with PO4 tetrahedra along the ab-plane to form slabs, which further form a two-dimensional framework (Fig. 9f). The Na3V(PO4)2 exhibits a discharge capacity of 90 mA h g−1 and excellent rate performance with ∼79% of the theoretical capacity being obtained at 15C. First-principles calculations linked this high-power capability to the two-dimensional Na diffusion pathways with low energy barriers (∼433 meV). The group also probed a two-phase reaction accompanied by 3.87% of increase in the c-axis (from 6.98 to 7.25 Å) during the desodiation process.96 Such a small lattice parameter change is beneficial to its long cycling stability. Na3V3(PO4)4, which was found by Yang's group,97 also shows a two-dimensional framework. Its structure, kinetics and electrochemical performance were deeply studied. The layered structure enables 3D Na+ diffusion pathways. The BVS maps depicted in Fig. 9g and h illustrate interlayer Na1–Na1 and Na1–Na2 paths, as well as intralayer Na2–Na2 paths, which should facilitate migration of Na ions. Besides, Na3V3(PO4)4 possesses a high voltage plateau at 3.9 V. However, the discharge capacity is less than 45 mA h g−1, because of its heavy molecular weight.

3.2. Pyrophosphates
In terms of thermal stability, pyrophosphates could be better than phosphates due to the fact that the loss of oxygen leads to the formation of pyrophosphate [P2O7 or (PO4−x)2] units from phosphate units in the temperature range of 500–550 °C. Thus, the pyrophosphate anion can be considered energetically more stable than phosphate anions at higher temperature.98 Since NaFeP2O7 was discovered in the late 1980s,99–101 crystal structural characteristics of various pyrophosphates have been unveiled in the following decades.102–108 Yet, none of the literature studies has focused on their application in SIBs, until Yamaki introduced Na+ in orthorhombic (MoO2)2P2O7 (space group Pnma) in 2003.109 The (MoO2)2P2O7 shows poor rate capability due to the large ionic size of Na+, despite its impressive discharge capacity of over 180 mA h g−1.109,110
Great enthusiasm for exploring Na+ intercalation materials towards pyrophosphates has been ignited since 2010 when SIBs regained researchers’ attention. In 2012, Na2FeP2O7 was proposed as a positive Na insertion host by Yamada's group for the first time.111 The Na2FeP2O7 with a triclinic P phase is built from [Fe2O11] dimers created by corner-shared [FeO6] octahedra and [P2O7] groups via both edge-sharing and corner-sharing, forming a three-dimensional framework with spacious tunnels along the [011] direction for facile Na+ migration and large interstices to accommodate sodium insertion (Fig. 10a). Na2FeP2O7 can only extract one Na+, delivering a capacity of about 90 mA h g−1. Based on the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple, it shows multistep voltage–capacity profiles due to the different Na+ (Na1–Na8) with distinct circumstances and their ordering (Fig. 10b).111,112 Details of the phase behavior and sodium extraction process have been disclosed by Kim et al.112Ex situ XRD (Fig. 10c) and DFT calculation (Fig. 10d) show that the low potential plateau at around 2.5 V corresponds to a single-phase reaction, during which the first Na+ at the Na1 site is extracted along the [011] channel. On the other hand, the high potential plateau centered at around 3.0 V is identified to associate with a two-phase reaction, where other Na (Na3–Na8) can be extracted through 1D or/and 2D pathways. Sodium diffusion behavior was further studied by Yamada et al.113 The calculated paths for long-range Na+ migration along the a-axis, b-axis and c-axis directions possess activation energies less than 0.5 eV; such a comparable energy barrier is beneficial for fast sodium diffusion in Na2FeP2O7, which has been proved by Chen et al.,114 who adopted a double carbon modification strategy to improve the rate capability of Na2FeP2O7 to 50C. Kim's group synthesized a flexible binder-free NFPNPs@PCC (Na2FeP2O7 nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon cloth) electrode (Fig. 10e), which demonstrates 82% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 10C (Fig. 10f).115 In addition to the moderate high-rate capability, outstanding thermal stability is another merit of Na2FeP2O7. Thermal stability tests show that its charged state (NaFeP2O7) does not involve any decomposition or oxygen evolution even up to 600 °C, but there would be a phase variation from triclinic (P) to monoclinic (P21/c) at 560 °C.98 As a positive Na host, Na2FeP2O7 demonstrates intriguing Na-storage chemistry, even though practical applications of Na2FeP2O7 may be hindered by its low energy density.

Li2MnP2O7 is almost electrochemically inactive at ambient temperature due to the sluggish Mn3+/Mn2+ redox kinetics.116,117 In contrast, Na2MnP2O7 was reported to show anomalous manganese activation at room temperature. Choi's group found that Na2MnP2O7 adopts a triclinic structure with the space group P.116 The structure contains corner-shared MnO6-MnO5 dimers [Mn2O10], which in turn connect with PO4 or P2O7 to create an open framework. In the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V, 0.9 Na ion per formula unit of Na2MnP2O7 can be extracted. This impressive phenomenon is attributed to its unique binding structure. On one hand, it is known that bond rupturing and creation can produce a large activation barrier for Na deintercalation at room temperature; however, the corner-shared Na2MnP2O7 does not show any noticeable bonding changes during the reaction. On the other hand, it is considered that the corner-sharing manner helps Na2MnP2O7 to accommodate distortions and mitigate the Jahn–Teller effect.116 The theoretical capacity of Na2MnP2O7 (97.5 mA h g−1) is equal to that of Na2FeP2O7, but its energy density is higher because the Mn3+/Mn2+ has higher redox potentials. The CV curve reveals a multistep sodium (de)insertion process, which may signal structural rearrangements or Na-ion ordering. It is anticipated that half of the Na ions in Na1 sites will be firstly extracted, then all of the Na ions in Na3 sites, and finally, half in the Na4 sites (Fig. 10g).116 DFT calculations and ex situ XRD uncovered one single-phase reaction at 3.32 V and three consecutive two-phase reactions at 3.66, 3.98, and 4.15 V (Fig. 10h and i). The Na+ migration paths along the a-axis, b-axis and c-axis directions also show low activation energies of 0.58 eV; however, the rate capability of Na2MnP2O7 is unsatisfactory. That is probably because of the poor electronic conductivity of Na2MnP2O7, which is almost electrochemically ineffective without carbon coating. When modified by reducing particle size and graphene-coating, the electrochemical activity of Na2MnP2O7 can be significantly improved (Fig. 10j and k).118 Another kind of Na2MnP2O7 (β-Na2MnP2O7) was found by Barpanda et al.119 The β-Na2MnP2O7 also adopts a triclinic P phase, but the [Mn2O10] is formed from MnO6 octahedron by edge-sharing, instead of corner-sharing. This led to a reversible capacity of 80 mA h g−1, with an average potential of around 3.3 V. The smooth charge/discharge curves of β-Na2MnP2O7 signify a different reaction mechanism, which still needs further investigation.
Recent works from Nazar's group have identified a series of off-stoichiometric Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2 (2/3 ≤ α ≤ 7/8) materials.120 Due to the increased number of reversible sodium ions, Na4−αFe2+α/2(P2O7)2 obtained a higher capacity than the stoichiometric phase Na2FeP2O7. The Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 crystallizes into a triclinic structure (space group P). Different from triclinic Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7, the three-dimensional framework of Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 is built with corner-shared centrosymmetric crown units of [Fe2P4O22] and [Fe2P4O20]. Each crown unit contains two FeO6 octahedra and two P2O7 groups (Fig. 11a). Theoretically, the capacity of Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 can reach 117.6 mA h g−1, corresponding to 2.44 Na de/intercalation.120–122 This is obviously higher than that of Na2FeP2O7 (97.5 mA h g−1). Ex situ XRD patterns (Fig. 11b) collected with the sequential chemical desodiation/sodiation method show that the Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 underwent a single-phase reaction. Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2 was also found sensitive to moisture and CO2 in air. To address this problem, Deng's group designed a coral-like hierarchical Na3.12Fe2.44(P2O7)2/C composite.122 With improved surface stability, moisture sensitivity has been effectively reduced and a reversible capability of 107 mA h g−1 has been achieved. Chou et al. proposed a carbon-coated Na-rich Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2 (Fig. 11c).123 This material exhibits very high initial Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. In situ XRD identified a single-phase reaction with a tiny lattice volume change of approximately 2.19% (Fig. 11d). Such a small volume change is beneficial to structural stability. They also studied sodium diffusion paths by DFT calculations, which show two possible Na migration paths in the structure. Based on the distinctive Na-rich structure, the Na3.32Fe2.34(P2O7)2 presented enhanced rate capability to 10C and cycling stability with 92.3% of capacity retention after 300 cycles. Zhang et al. reported electrochemical performance of Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2.124 By embedding Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2 nanoparticles into porous carbon, the Na3.12Mn2.44(P2O7)2/C demonstrates moderate energy density due to the enhanced Mn3+/Mn2+ redox kinetics.

To achieve higher energy density, other transition metals with a high redox potential have also been introduced in the pyrophosphate framework. Na2CoP2O7 was found with various structures depending on synthesis conditions.108,125–127 An orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7 with the space group of Pna21 was firstly investigated by Barpanda et al.126 They found that it has a layered structure, offering two-dimensional channels for Na-ion migration. However, the layered Na2CoP2O7 shows a sloping voltage profile centered at 3.0 V, which is far from high potential. Jung et al. employed a strategy of controlling Na deficiencies in Na2CoP2O7 and successfully obtained a stable rose-phase Na2CoP2O7, which adopts a triclinic P structure (Fig. 12a and b).125 Different from the layered phase, the rose-phase material presents stable cycling with an average voltage of 4.3 V, providing an improved energy density that is 40% more than that of the layered one (Fig. 12c). This work proves that the crystal structure could affect the electrochemical performance of electrode materials significantly, and the strategy of nonstoichiometry-driven control of polymorphism may be informative for other materials.

Vanadium-based pyrophosphates are regarded as another attractive material in SIBs. NaVP2O7 adopts a centrosymmetric space group of P21/c.128 Although the nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation results indicate a low Na migration energy barrier in NaVP2O7, it exhibits limited electrochemical activity due to its intrinsic high resistance. Yamada et al. have extended the composition to Na2(VO)P2O7, which can be indexed to a tetragonal structure with P4bm symmetry.129 The tetragonal Na2(VO)P2O7 (t-Na2(VO)P2O7) shows a layered structure constructed by the stack of V–O–P polyhedron slabs and Na layer along the c direction. Each V–O–P polyhedron slab is formed by [VP2O11] units that comprises one (VO)O4 square pyramid and four independent PO4 tetrahedra in a corner-sharing fashion (Fig. 12d). The discharge capacity was approximately 80 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12e), which is 85.7% of its theoretical capacity (93.4 mA h g−1). Besides, based on the V5+/V4+ redox reaction, t-Na2(VO)P2O7 delivers a high average voltage of 3.8 V (Fig. 12f).129 Recently, Kang et al. proposed a novel Na7V3(P2O7)4 material with the highest redox potential among vanadium-based polyanion compounds.130 The crystal structure of Na7V3(P2O7)4 can be assigned to a monoclinic structure with the C2/c space group, and it also shows a quasi-layer structure. The VO6 octahedron shares corners with the P2O7 groups, creating large tunnels, which serve as 3D Na diffusion paths in the structure (Fig. 12g). A capacity close to its theoretical value (≈80 mA h g−1) can be obtained, with a voltage plateau centered at 4.13 V (Fig. 12h). The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra show that the reaction is based on the V4+/V3+ redox. Such a high potential should be ascribed to a stronger inductive effect, since every corner of the VO6 octahedra in Na7V3(P2O7)4 is shared with P2O7 groups, which is rather unique among vanadium-based polyanion materials.130 The improved electrochemical performance of Na7V3(P2O7)4 was also realized by nano-structural engineering.131
3.3. Fluorine transition metal salts
To further increase the energy density of the polyanionic material, increasing their capacity and output voltage would be necessary. Since it is very difficult to increase their capacity due to their inherently heavy molecular weight, the other option is to improve the output voltage. Introducing high electronegative anions into a polyanionic material (the polyanionic groups are designated as (XO4)n−(Z)m− (X = B, P, S, Si, etc., and Z = F, OH, etc.)) is considered to be an effective way to increase the redox potential by virtue of the inductive effect. F− with high iconicity can weaken the covalent bond between M–O, which can lead to a larger energy difference between antibonding orbitals and vacuum and hence result in a higher redox potential. In this review, we focus on the progress of fluorophosphates and fluorosulfates.

3.3.1. Fluorophosphates. 
The highly electronegative F was introduced to improve the output voltage of vanadium-based phosphates. Barker et al. firstly proposed NaVPO4F,132 which possesses a tetragonal symmetry structure (space group I4/mmm) and demonstrates an average discharge voltage of 3.7 V with an initial capacity of 82 mA h g−1. Afterwards, Zhuo et al. prepared NaVPO4F with a monoclinic phase (space group C2/c)133 and optimized its electrochemical performance by Cr doping, enabling it to deliver an initial reversible capacity of 83.3 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of about 91.4% after 20 cycles. However, the capacity is still far below its theoretical value (143 mA h g−1). Zhao and co-workers reported the phase transition between monoclinic and tetragonal structures of NaVPO4F at different temperatures.134 Recently, Li et al. have systematically investigated the structural and compositional evolution of NaVPO4F.135 They found that none of the prepared products is consistent with single-phase NaVPO4F at any temperature. So they speculated that the previously obtained I4/mmm and C2/c NaVPO4F from solid-state synthesis were incorrect. They conducted in situ XRD and TGA/DSC measurements based on the raw materials (NaF:VPO4 = 1:1), as displayed in Fig. 13a. The temperature region was divided into four parts. In the first part (below 400 °C), all diffraction peaks of NaF and VPO4 shift toward low angles, implying the occurrence of a reaction between the raw materials. In addition, a new peak at 16.5 °C fitted in the (002) plane of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 appeared, suggesting that Na3V2(PO4)2F3 began to form around 400 °C. In the second part (400–700 °C), NaF disappears at 500 °C, leaving Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and VPO4. In the third part (700–850 °C), a series of new peaks that look like those of the proposed monoclinic NaVPO4F emerged, but the weight loss (∼6.6%) precludes the possibility of NaVPO4F. These new peaks can be attributed to hexagonal Na3V2(PO4)3 (space group Rc) and the weight loss ascribed to the evolution of VF3 gas. The TGA/DSC curves and compositional changes (atomic ratio) of raw materials upon heating are displayed in Fig. 13b and c, respectively. In the fourth part (beyond 850 °C), some new peaks corresponding to the (113) plane of (VO)2P2O7 and the (005) plane of Na4P2O7 appear. The authors summarized the reaction of raw materials in different temperature ranges as:3NaF + 3VPO4 → Na3V2(PO4)2F3 + VPO4 (>500 °C)Na3V2(PO4)2F3 + VPO4 → Na3V2(PO4)3 + VF3↑ (600–800 °C)2Na3V2(PO4)3 → 2(VO)2P2O7 + Na4P2O7 + AP (>800 °C)

The crystal structure of monoclinic NaVPO4F includes two PO4 tetrahedra interconnected with two corner-shared oxygens through two different VO4F2 octahedra, as presented in Fig. 13d.136 Recently, in order to improve the performance of NaVPO4F, many groups have focused on improving the electronic conductivity by morphology control137 and surface coatings.138 Our group has successfully fabricated NaVPO4F/C nanofibers via the electrospinning method.137 The NaVPO4F/C presents a pair of redox peaks (3.66/3.42 V) with small polarization (Fig. 13e). Thanks to the improved conductivity and ultra-small NaVPO4F nanoparticles, the obtained material exhibits a high capacity of 126.3 mA h g−1 and excellent rate performance (61.2 mA h g−1 at 50C). Although the electrochemical performance of NaVPO4F has been greatly improved, there are still some controversies about the structure and composition of NaVPO4F which need to be investigated.
Another member of the sodium–vanadium fluorophosphate family is Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x(0 ≤ x ≤ 1), which has been reported by Park et al.139 The oxidation state of vanadium alters as the fluorine content changes. When x is 1, the compound is Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and the valence of V is 3. And when x is 0, the compound is Na3V2O2(PO4)2F and the valence of V is 4. The crystal structure of Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x is shown in Fig. 14a. The larger V3+ induced increased h (height of Vn+ octahedra) and the weaker F−–F− repulsion made d (distance between terminal anions) decrease. It is worth noting that the change in h plays a greater role in the change of c (c = 2h + d). As a result, the lattice parameter c and volume V increase as the F content increases. All the Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x electrodes with different F contents exhibit a similar average voltage of 3.8–3.9 V (vs. Na+/Na) and a capacity of 120–130 mA h g−1, the corresponding voltage–composition curves of Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x electrodes are shown in Fig. 14b and c. The authors found only a small volume change of ∼2% in the Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x system.

Na3V2(PO4)2F3, as a typical member of the Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x family, has gained significant attention due to its high operating voltage (≈3.9 V). Le Meins et al.140 firstly proposed that the structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 possesses tetragonal symmetry with the space group of P42/mnm. Bianchini et al. revisited the structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in 2014.141 They used high angular resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction to further investigate the crystal structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Surprisingly, they found that a very subtle orthorhombic distortion for (h00)tetragonal and (0k0)tetragonal reflections appeared, as presented in Fig. 14d. Through combining indexing software, electron diffraction, and crystallographic considerations, they obtained that the suitable crystal space group is Amam with unit-cell parameters of a = 9.02847(3) Å, b = 9.04444(3) Å, c = 10.74666(6) Å. This slight difference in structure reveals a significantly modified distribution of Na ions (Fig. 14e). For comparison, the crystal structures of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with space groups P42/mnm and Amam are shown in Fig. 15a and b, respectively.141,142 In particular, a different distribution of Na+ appears in the Amam space group. Three different sites (Na1A, Na2A, Na3A) pointing toward the tunnel directions are present in Fig. 15b. The arrangement of Na can significantly impact the properties of the material.

Various advanced techniques such as operando high resolution synchrotron XRD, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have been adopted to deduce the sodium storage mechanism in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Bianchini et al. have conducted a comprehensive investigation on a Na3V2(PO4)2F3–NaV2(PO4)2F3 system via high angular resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction measurements.142 Different from the previously reported one-step solid solution reaction, the authors revealed that there are four intermediate phases before the formation of NaV2(PO4)2F3. As an example, the phase change during the process of Na3V2(PO4)2F3–Na2V2(PO4)2F3 is shown in Fig. 15c. Two intermediate phases (Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 and Na2.2V2(PO4)2F3) can be detected. During the process of forming NaV2(PO4)2F3 from Na3V2(PO4)2F3, a solid solution reaction in the interval between 1.8 and 1.3 Na per formula unit happened. To clearly present this reaction, potential–composition electrochemical curves obtained upon Na+ extraction from Na3V2(PO4)2F3–NaV2(PO4)2F3 are depicted in Fig. 15d. Yang and Grey et al. investigated the local structure and dynamics of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in SIBs by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).143Fig. 15e shows the ex situ23Na NMR spectra of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 electrodes at different charge states. The two main resonances at 142 and 95 ppm can be ascribed to Na(1) and partially occupied Na(2) sites in the structure, respectively. At the beginning of Stage I (3.6–3.7 V), the weak resonances below 50 ppm quickly disappear. Simultaneously, the intensity of the Na1 and Na2 peaks decreases. The peak broadening is due to the extraction of Na and the formation of Na vacancies, indicating the increase of Na ion mobility. An obvious structural change occurs during late Stage I, indicating a rearrangement of unpaired electrons within the vanadium t2g orbitals. Stage II (3.7–4.2 V) indicates a single-phase Na extraction process. A new peak emerges (87 ppm) appearing at the beginning of Stage III (>4.2 V) followed by shifting to a lower frequency, which involves local structural changes and/or is electronic in nature.
To realize the accessibility of the third Na+ in NVPF, Tarascon's group has successfully triggered the activity of the third sodium electrochemically in Na3V2(PO4)2F3via the formation of a disordered NaxV2(PO4)2F3 phase of tetragonal symmetry (I4/mmm space group).144 The authors limited the amount of extracted sodium ions (Δx) to 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, and 3.0 in the charge process, which are referred to as NVPF-2, NVPF-2.25, NVPF-2.5, NVPF-2.75, and NVPF-3.0, respectively, and then discharged to different voltages (1 V and 3 V). Fig. 16a shows the charge–discharge profile of the second cycle in the voltage window of 4.4 and 1.0 V. All discharge capacities are larger than the theoretical capacity of NVPF based on the extraction of 2 Na+. NVPF-3.0 exhibits a reversible capacity of 200 mA h g−1, while when discharging to 3 V, only a capacity of 107 mA h g−1 is released. Therefore, most of the extra discharge capacity comes from the lower potential region. To probe the structural evolutions when activating the third sodium in Na3V2(PO4)2F3, the authors performed ex situ synchrotron XRD measurements. The XRD patterns of different samples discharged to 1 V are displayed in Fig. 16b. Interestingly, some new peaks appeared when Δx was larger than 2.5, reflecting the existence of a mixture of the Cmc21 phase and a new one. When Δx is increased to 3, the XRD pattern can be indexed to a single phase (space group I4/mmm) with an approximate chemical composition Na0V2(PO4)2F3. The structure of NVPF under different conditions is shown in Fig. 16c. Combined with the NMR spectra of 23Na and 31P (Fig. 17a), the authors confirmed the sodium disorder in the newly formed tetragonal phase, in which Na occupies several Wyckoff sites with partial occupancy. In addition, there are the broad peaks in 23Na and 31P spectra during the discharge process of the NVFP-3.0, which is due to the distribution of vanadium oxidation states associated with sodium site occupancies. This phenomenon indicates the change of Fermi contact shifts between the neighboring phosphate groups and sodium ions, thus confirming the presence of sodium disorder in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 formed by the electrochemical removal of three sodium ions. Different from the conventional understanding of the electrochemical properties of Na0V2(PO4)2F3, this work proved that the third Na+ can be reversibly de-intercalated, thus providing a new avenue to boost the energy density of SIBs.

Na3V2(PO4)2O2F, as a member of the Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x series (x = 0), can facilitate Na+ diffusion due to the weaker inductive effects provided by lower F content. Guo et al. prepared uniform and carbon-free Na3V2(PO4)2O2F nano-tetraprisms (NVPF–NTP).145 Two high voltage potential (4.01, 3.60 V) and a high specific capacity of 127.8 mA h g−1 are clearly exhibited in charge/discharge curves (Fig. 17b). Additionally, both GITT and CV at various scan rates have been used to probe the Na-migration kinetics of NVPF–NTP. The results indicate faster Na+ diffusion in the high plateau than that in the low plateau. Additionally, in situ XRD has been performed to probe the structural evolutions of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F during Na+ intercalation/extraction, which is shown in Fig. 17c. The result indicates two complete Na extraction during charging accompanied by the transition of Na3V2(PO4)2O2F to Na2V2(PO4)2O2F and then to NaV2(PO4)2O2F. After the subsequent discharge process, the XRD pattern can return to the pristine state, suggesting a fully reversible electrochemical transformation during the charge/discharge process. Moreover, by calculating the volume of the unit cells, it is shown that there is only a volumetric variation of 2.56% during Na intercalation/extraction. As a consequence, NVPF–NTP demonstrates excellent cycling stability with an ultralong lifepan.
In addition to vanadium-based fluorophosphates, other types of fluorinated phosphates (Na2FePO4F, Na2CoPO4F, NaMnPO4F) have also been researched. Na2FePO4F was firstly reported by Nazar's group,146 which crystallizes in the Pbcn orthorhombic space group and exhibits two-dimensional ion transport paths. It showed a solid-solution-like electrochemical behavior related to two different phases (Na1.5FePO4F and NaFePO4F) in LIBs. Later, Na-ion conduction behavior and intrinsic defect properties in Na2FePO4F were investigated with atomistic simulation methods.24 Na+ ion migration in Na2FePO4F is suggested to be fast through a 2D network in the ac plane. It exhibits only a small volume variation of 3.7% during the process of Na+ de-intercalation. Tereshchenko et al. investigated the intercalation chemistry of Na2FePO4F by combining XRD and DFT calculations.147 The results suggest that it adopts a two-phase mechanism and there exists an intermediate monoclinic Na1.55FePO4F phase during desodiation of Na2FePO4F. However, a different reaction mechanism was proposed by Smiley et al. in 2016148 They suggested that there is only one transition between Na2FePO4F and NaFePO4F. Thus, controversy still exists about the reaction mechanism of Na2FePO4F.
Very recently, Li and his colleagues employed in situ XRD, ex situ ssNMR spectra and DFT calculations to further verify the structural evolution and the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of Na2FePO4F.149Fig. 18a–c present the local environment of the Na sites in Na2FePO4F, Na1.5FePO4F, and NaFePO4F, respectively. Correspondingly, their 23Na MAS NMR spectra are sequentially displayed in Fig. 18d–f. The 23Na MAS NMR spectra in different states during Na2FePO4F charge and discharge states are shown in Fig. 18g and h. The results reveal two two-phase reactions among three structures of Na2FePO4F, Na1.5FePO4F, and NaFePO4F. In addition, the DFT calculation suggests that the intermediate phase, Na1.5FePO4F, crystallizes into the space group of P21/c (a subgroup of Pbcn). The pristine Na2FePO4F crystallizes in the space group Pbcn. Its structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 18i. The [FePO4F] layers are formed by face-sharing FeO4F2 octahedra, connected by bridging F atoms and PO4 tetrahedra. There are two different Na sites in the structure of Na2FePO4F behaving differently during cycling, in which only the Na2 site is electrochemically active while the Na1 site is inert.

Na2CoPO4F, as a high voltage cathode, was first prepared by a solid-state method in 2010.150 It has a high-voltage potential near 4.8 V in the Li half-cell based on Co2+/Co3+. But it shows poor electrochemical reversibility. Later, Komaba et al. synthesized carbon-modified Na2CoPO4F and firstly examined its performances in SIBs.151 It delivers an initial discharged capacity of about 100 mA h g−1 and demonstrates a voltage plateau at 4.3 V (vs. Na+/Na). But it still has a very large irreversible capacity in the first cycle and exhibits inferior cycling stability (Fig. 18j). To further improve the electrochemical performance of Na2CoPO4F, Yang's group prepared pure phase Na2CoPO4F/C composites through a spray-drying method followed by a high temperature sintering process.152 However, Na2CoPO4F/C composites still suffer a rapid capacity decay, which may be due to the decomposition of the electrolyte at a high voltage. Therefore, even if Na2CoPO4F is regarded as a very promising high-voltage cathode material for SIBs, it is still a challenge to improve its reversibility and cycle stability.
Na2MnPO4F crystallizes into a 3D tunnel structure (space group: P21/n).153 The initial reports from Recham et al. and Ellis et al. indicate no electrochemical activity in Na2MnPO4F.150,154 The electrochemical activity of Na2MnPO4F was first triggered by the formation of nanocomposites with carbon.155 However, it is noteworthy that the cell was tested at 60 °C and the capacity decayed rapidly. Later, Kim et al. systematically studied the electrochemical performance of Na2MnPO4F through experiment and first principles calculations.135 There are four distinguishable interstitial Na sites in the Na2MnPO4F lattice, where there exists three possible Na-ion diffusion paths: Na1–Na4 chain, Na2–Na3 chain, and interchain (from one chain to another chain). The corresponding activation barriers are approximately 600, 500, and 400 meV, respectively. Higher activation barriers lead to worse electrochemical kinetics. The specific capacity of Na2MnPO4F is approximately 120 mA h g−1 within the voltage range of conventional electrolyte. However, the large polarization and poor electrochemical activity still hinder the application of Na2MnPO4F. Further research studies are needed to improve the electrochemical performance of Na2MnPO4F.


3.3.2 Fluorosulfates. 
Tarascon's group successfully introduced LiFeSO4F into the cathode family of LIBs.156 This material shows a small voltage platform at 3.6 V, which is higher than that of LiFePO4. Moreover, it exhibits a high reversible capacity of ∼140 mA h g−1 as well as a superior rate capability. Later, a 3.9 V cathode has been reported by substituting 5% Fe with Mn in LiFeSO4F.157 The obtained LiFe1−σMnσSO4 crystallizes into a triplite structure and exhibits a capacity of 125 mA h g−1. It undergoes an ultra-small volume change of 0.6% during Li+ (de)intercalation. A series of significant discoveries encouraged researchers to extend them to Na-based systems. Barpanda et al. reported NaMSO4F (M = Fe, Co, Ni) for the first time.158 Different from the crystal structure of LiMSO4F, NaMSO4F possesses a monoclinic structure. Among them, only NaFeSO4F possesses electrochemical activity. It shows a redox potential of 3.6 V versus Li+/Li. Subsequently, Nazar et al. investigated the alkali ion transport behavior in both LiFeSO4F and NaFeSO4F by atomistic modeling methods.159 The results manifest that LiFeSO4F is a 3D Li+ conductor with a low activation energy of ∼0.4 eV, contributing to high Li mobility. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 19a, NaFeSO4F is a 1D Na-ion conductor and can only diffuse along the [101] direction, which possesses a higher activation energy of ∼0.6 eV than LiFeSO4F. This work offers a profound insight into the difference of alkali ion transport between LiFeSO4F and NaFeSO4F.159

Generally, the AFeSO4F (A = alkali ions, Li, Na etc.) can be obtained through the reaction between the alkali metal fluorides and FeSO4·H2O.160 As depicted in Fig. 19b, there are two reactions occurring simultaneously in the process: (i) loss of water from FeSO4·H2O; (ii) the insertion of alkali metal fluorides (NaF, LiF) in the structure. It is generally believed that in order to get pure-phase materials, the latter reaction should be faster than the former. However, it is still a challenge to synthesize pure-phase NaMSO4F due to their low thermodynamic stability and poor hydrolytic stability. To overcome this problem, Nazar's group put forward a scalable synthesis route to tavorite LiFeSO4F by reaction in hydrophilic tetraethylene glycol at 220 °C.161 Additionally, they successfully extended this synthesis method to other related materials. Fig. 19c illustrates the synthesis processes of LiFeSO4F. First, FeSO4·7H2O is quickly decomposed by rapid heating. And then, the obtained FeSO4·H2O reacts with LiF at a low temperature to prevent the dehydration of FeSO4·H2O. The synthesis of NaFeSO4F is similar to that of LiFeSO4F. Their structures were determined by Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern. The structure of LiFeSO4F, FeSO4F, and NaFeSO4F (as shown in Fig. 19d) crystallizes in the space group of P, P21/c, and C2/c, respectively.

3.4. Mixed phosphates
The mixed phosphates Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M represents transition metals) have emerged as promising cathodes due to their low volumetric strain, superior thermal stability, as well as higher operating potential than other polyanionic materials such as NaMPO4 and Na2MP2O7. However, similar to other polyanion-type cathode materials, mixed phosphates also suffer from poor electronic conductivity and low ionic conductivity.162,163 The structure of Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 possesses robust 3D Na+ transmission channels, which are constructed by MO6 octahedra, PO43− and P2O74− groups (Fig. 20a). DFT calculations demonstrate that the volume change of these materials is below 4% during sodium de/intercalation, thus enabling them with good cycling stability. Considering the factors of cost and environment, iron-based polyanionic compounds are regarded as the most promising cathodes among the mixed phosphates.164,165 Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 can deliver a theoretical capacity of 129 mA h g−1 and reaction potential with 3.2 V vs. Na+/Na, based on the redox reaction of Fe3+/Fe2+. To address the problem of sluggish kinetics, modification strategies, including controlling nanoparticle granularity, carbon coating and ion-doping, have been adopted. As shown in Fig. 20b and c, Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 nanoparticles distributed uniformly in the 3D rGO layer with a thickness of 2.2 nm, which not only prevented volume change but also improved electrical conductivity, displaying rate capability of up to 200C.166In situ XRD and XANES were employed to probe the sodium-storage mechanism of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7.167 As can be seen in Fig. 20d, all the diffraction peaks shifted reversibly during cycling, which means the reversible reaction of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 during sodium de/insertion. XANES results indicate that the redox between Fe2+ and Fe3+ is reversible, as shown in Fig. 20e and f. Additionally, the graphene modification can enhance the pseudocapacitive effect on the electrode, leading to superior rate capacity of the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode even at low temperatures, as shown in Fig. 20g.168 Barpanda and his colleagues synthesized a Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 thin film electrode, which displayed much better performance than the bulk electrode.169 Cabanas compared the electrochemical properties of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 in aqueous and organic electrolytes.170 The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode presents the same performance in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, indicating its impressive stability against air and moisture.170 The realization of superior cycling stability and rate capability of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 on flexible substrates was reported by Ma et al. through rational structural design. As displayed in Fig. 20h and i, a NaFePO4 thin shell is supposed to increase electrochemical activity and the Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 core can provide high redox voltage and capacity. Besides, the innermost carbon cloth carrier and the outermost carbon shell jointly constructs a 3D conductive network to make the electronic transport fast.171

The Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode displays promising application prospects due to its high voltage (4.5 V vs. Na+/Na) and high specific capacity (127 mA h g−1).172 Theoretically, three sodium ions are supposed to be extracted per unit formula, but first-principles calculations have proved that extraction of the fourth sodium may become a reality when Co3+ is oxidized to Co4+.173 Ion doping has been used to improve intrinsic ionic conductivity and prevent the lattice strain during cycling. For example, the Al-doped Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode displayed attractive high voltage properties, as well as ultralong cycle stability at a high current density of 30C (Fig. 21a).174 When assembled in a full cell, the output voltage can reach 4.36 V, which is higher than those of other reported Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 cathodes, revealing its prospect for practical applications. Compared to Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7, Na4Ni3(PO4)2P2O7 can get a higher operating voltage of 4.8 V based on the redox of Ni2+/Ni3+.175Ex situ XRD patterns in Fig. 21b clearly indicate the reversible phase transition, suggesting its stable crystal structure at high voltage. Owing to the close atomic size of transition metals and the same orthorhombic Pn21a space of Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7, a novel Na4Co3Mn0.3Ni0.3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode was prepared and it exhibited complex redox behavior. Ex situ XAS analysis (Fig. 21c) shows that the redox reactions of Co, Mn and Ni during charging occurred simultaneously rather than sequentially.176 By tuning the amounts of Mn and Ni atoms, a higher energy density cathode may be achieved.

Another type of classic mixed polyanion material is V-based ortho-diphosphate Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4, with a single-valued voltage plateau (V3+/V4+) at 3.88 V. As shown in Fig. 22a, the crystal structure of Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 provides 3D paths for ion transfer.177 However, the low conductivity leads to limited kinetics and inferior high-rate performance. Therefore, investigations on the sodium storage of Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 mainly focus on improving the electrical conductivity. Constructing a 3D graphen framework supported Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 nanorods structure has been proven effective (Fig. 22b).177 For instance, Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4 supported by 3D hybrid carbon forms derived from biological fungus was synthesized by Deng et al.178 Fang et al. and Lim et al. probed the role of intermediate phase (Na5V4(P2O7)4PO4) for the cycling performance of Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4.46,179 The results demonstrate that the intermediate phase can relieve the differences of lattice parameters between the original and final phases and then be beneficial to the cell kinetics. Masquelier et al. partly substituted V with Al in the Na7V4(P2O7)4PO4, thus leading to the electrode with partial redox of V4+/V5+ during cycling. Ex situ XRD (Fig. 22c and d) demonstrated 1.8 Na+ can be additionally extracted from Na7V3Al(P2O7)4PO4 per unit cell when the cut-off voltage increased from 4.2 to 5.0 V vs. Na+/Na. Unfortunately, the redox couple of V4+/V5+ has a negative effect to the electrochemical reversibility except for adding capacity.180

3.5. Sulfates
In pursuit to design high voltage materials, sulfates are of great significance because SO42− has stronger electronegativity than other polyanion groups. The alluaudite-type [Na2M(SO4)2·nH2O (m = transition metals Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, Mn. n = 0, 2, 4)] forms a rich treasure house for SIBs.181 To date, many alluaudite phase Na2M(SO4)2·nH2O materials, including Na2Fe(SO4)2,182 Na2Co(SO4)2,183 Na2Mn(SO4)2184 and Na2Mg(SO4)2185etc. have been explored. In particular, Na2Fe(SO4)2 can deliver a relatively high operating voltage of 3.25 V (Fe2+/Fe3+) with a theoretical capacity of 91 mA h g−1.182 DFT calculations reveal that Na2M(SO4)2 has an extraordinary small volume change below 5% during Na+ insertion/desertion,186 which ensures great structural stability for long cycling. Note that, the structural stability is also associated with H2O unit in the structure. For example, the absence of H2O unit led to different phase transformation reactions between Na2Fe(SO4)2 and Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O.187,188 Pan et al. reported a 3.6 V cathode of Na2Fe(SO4)2 (Fig. 23a).182 XRD result shows this cathode has outstanding thermal stability at up to 580 °C. No hydrates were formed even they have been exposed to nature environment for two months (Fig. 23b and c). As shown in Fig. 23d, the ex situ XPS revealed that the reaction of Na2Fe(SO4)2 was based on the reversible redox of Fe2+/Fe3+ couple. The realization of Fe3+/Fe4+ is always hard to achieve is sulfates, which limits its voltage as well as specific capacity.189,190 The Cr-doped Na2Fe0.8Cr0.2(SO4)2 has better thermal stability, but it shows inferior electrochemical performance because the Cr2+ in the structure is inert.191 The K-substituted Na0.97KFe(SO4)2 exhibits a higher redox potential of 3.27 V based on the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction (Fig. 23e), which is confirmed by XANES (Fig. 23f).192

The bond length of Fe–Fe in Na2Fe2(SO4)3 is the shortest among iron-based compounds, thus leading to a higher voltage. Chen et al. synthesized a Na2Fe2(SO4)3@C@GO electrode, which exhibited an impressive high voltage plateau centered at 3.8 V and a corresponding energy density of over 400 W h kg−1.193 The in situ synchrotron XRD patterns (Fig. 24a) show that the sodium storage mechanism of Na2Fe2(SO4)3 is one single-phase transition during sodium insertion/desertion. As shown in Fig. 24b, bond-valence calculation results prove that some of the sodium ions can be extracted from the bc plane where the energy barriers are lower than other crystallographic planes. In order to promote their crystal stability and intercalation, the off-stoichiometric Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3 was obtained by Liu et al.,194 where SO4 tetrahedron shortens the Fe–Fe bond length to around 0.32 nm and the voltage can reach 4.08 V which corresponds to the process of sodium insertion to the vacant Fe1/Na1 sites. The electrochemical measurement reveals that the Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3@GO electrode had an excellent low-temperature performance, with a capacity retention of >98% over 700 cycles at 0 °C (Fig. 24c). Zhang's group found that the SEI film was thicker (Fig. 24d) when rGO was introduced into Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3 at high voltage after the first charge.195 Goñi et al. prepared the Na2.5Fe1.75(SO4)3/ketjen/rGO composite and studied the effect of carbon coating on SEI formation. According to the XPS and TEM results, carbon coating is beneficial to form a stable SEI on the composite upon cycling, as illustrated in Fig. 24e.196 Additionally, the adding of rGO in Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3 can not only enhance the electronic conductivity of Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3 and rate performance (Fig. 24f), but also prevent Fe2+ from being oxidized to Fe3+ when exposed to an external environment (Fig. 24g).197 Other conductive carbon materials such as CNTs are also used to boost the electrochemical performance of Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3.198 To get sulfates with higher voltage, some prediction have been made based on DFT calculations. The alluaudite phase Na2+2xCo2−x(SO4)3 (Fig. 24h) is supposed to have a high platform of 4.76 V based on the Co3+/Co2+ redox,181 and Na2+2xMn2−x(SO4)3 is supposed to have a high voltage of 4.4 V based on the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox.184 Other efforts focus on fluorination. For instance, Kim et al. reported that the NaFeSO4F cathode possesses a redox potential of up to 3.7 V and a theoretical capacity of 138 mA h g−1, which is significantly higher than that of Na2Fe(SO4)2 (Fig. 24i and j).199

In conclusion, Fe based sulfates have attracted a lot of research interest due to their low cost and abundant raw material resources. Some unfavorable factors hinder their development and application such as poor thermal stability, high moisture sensitivity and poor electronic conductivity. Although various approaches (e.g. morphology design, metal ion doping, conductive carbon coating) have been adopted to improve the performance of sulfates, there is still a long way to go for commercial application.
3.6. Silicate
Compared with other types of polyanion cathodes, sodium orthosilicates Na2MSiO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) generally possess higher specific capacity, showing two electron transfer per formula unit.200 Similar to lithium orthosilicates, the main components of the Na2MSiO4 unit cell are NaO4, MO4, and SiO4 tetrahedra. By analyzing the bond lengths and bond angles, the authors concluded that the order of tetrahedral stability in Na2MSiO4 is NaO4 < MO4 < SiO4.200,201 The strong Si–O bond enables Na2MSiO4 thermodynamic stability at more than 1000 °C, and the averaged bond length of Si–O almost has no change during the desodiation, making the volume change below 5% even when fully desodiated.202 The most prominent example of sodium orthosilicate materials is Na2FeSiO4, due to the abundance resources of the Na–Fe–Si system on the earth. Na2FeSiO4 exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 276 mA h g−1 through two-electron reactions. As shown in Fig. 25a, the Fe K edge XANES spectra effectively reveal that the valence of iron in Na2FeSiO4 is Fe2+. However, in the actual measurement, the two-electron-transfer process can hardly be detected completely due to the lower intrinsic conductivity of Na2FeSiO4. Ex situ XRD patterns in Fig. 25b indicate that no phase change occurs on Na2FeSiO4 during its charge and discharge process.203 And the phenomenon of negligible shift of XRD peaks is similar to the zero-strain electrode materials, which is significantly beneficial to the long cycle performance of batteries. Ex situ XPS results (Fig. 25c) demonstrate that Fe2+ is completely oxidized to Fe3+ when charged to 4.1 V from the open circuit voltage (OCV). Fe4+ was detected when charged to 4.5 V, demonstrating that the sodium storage mechanism of Na2FeSiO4 is two-electron reactions. When discharged to 1.5 V, the binding energy of Fe 2p returns to the initial energy region, demonstrating that Fe2+/Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couples possess excellent cyclic reversibility.204 Ali et al.204 synthesized a Na2FeSiO4@CNT electrode to improve the electronic conductivity, which shows a superior specific capacity at current densities from 0.5 to 20C. Kaliyappan et al.205 used the solid-state method to prepare a carbon-coated Na2FeSiO4 electrode, which shows an ultra-long lifespan at a current density of 3.5C (Fig. 25d). Na2MnSiO4 is also of great interest due to their high theoretical capacity (278 mA h g−1) and increased redox potential.206 The valence changes of Mn varies from +2 to +4 during charging, and 1.5 sodium ions can be extracted per formula unit. The ex situ XRD patterns show that the peaks of Na2MnSiO4 gradually disappear at high-voltage stages. After being fully discharged, their characteristic diffraction peaks can be detected again (Fig. 25e),207 indicating the reversible structure evolution. However, the dissolution of Mn2+ into the electrolyte causes irreversible capacity decay. To solve this problem, Law et al. explored the impact of different contents of VC additive in the electrolyte on Na2MnSiO4 electrochemical performance.208 When the VC concentration increases from 0 to 5 vol%, the discharge capacity can be improved. Additionally, the VC also plays a key role in the formation of the surface-stabilizing layer on cathodes to inhibit the dissolution of Mn2+, as illustrated in Fig. 25f. A higher concentration of VC would lead to lower capacity delivering. Ex situ XPS results (Fig. 25g) confirmed that the high specific capacity of Na2MnSiO4 derived from the consecutive redox of Mn2+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ species. Recently, Renman et al. extended the Mn-based silicate family to Na2Mn2Si2O7, which provides new clues to design new silicates.209 Besides Fe/Mn based orthosilicate electrodes, a Na2CoSiO4 cathode was also reported.210 The two-electron process is also available in the Na2CoSiO4 cathode, indicating that this material has a theoretical specific capacity of 272 mA h g−1. Two obvious pairs of redox can be seen from the voltage–capacity profiles in Fig. 25h, revealing a two-step redox reaction, which is associated with the different Co sites in the crystal structure.211

Sodium orthosilicates are competitive in terms of cost and environment, but some disadvantages need to be overcome before their commercial application. For instance, elaborately controlled reaction conditions and complicated processes are needed to avoid the formation of an impurity phase. Besides, future engineering on nanostructures and optimizing electrolytes should also be necessary to overcome the poor kinetics.212
4. Conclusion and perspective
Polyanion-type compounds are considered to be one of the most promising cathode materials for room-temperature SIBs by virtue of their stable framework, high energy density and thermal stability character. In this review, we systematically discussed the recent progress in phosphates, fluorophosphates, pyrophosphates, mixed phosphates, sulfates, and silicates. A summary of representative polyanion-type electrode materials concentrating on the structure, redox voltage value, and electrochemical performance is provided in Table 1. And the comparison between different types of polyanion compounds are shown in Table 2. The key issues of polyanion-type positive electrodes mainly contain five aspects: (1) the intrinsic low electronic conductivity leads to poor Na+ diffusion kinetics. There are generally three strategies to accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Na+: (i) combining active materials with a conductive carbon matrix; (ii) reducing particle size to the nanoscale level and thus to shorten the Na+ diffusion length; (iii) designing a suitable morphology to optimize the structure. (2) The applications of some polyanion-type compounds with voltage beyond 4.2 V (such as Na2CoPO4F) are restricted due to the lack of suitable electrolytes, because the conventional electrolytes could be oxidized beyond that region. (3) There would be a compromise between high voltage and high stability due to the existence of heavy inactive counter cations (P, S, Si, etc.) in polyanion-type compounds. (4) A variety of high performance polyanion-type materials, such as Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3(VO1−xPO4)2F1+2x, contain the precious and toxic transition metal “V”. Replacing element V with environmentally friendly and cheap elements while maintaining their high performance is still challenging. (5) It can be found from Table 1 that there is still a big gap between the actual discharge capacities of polyanion-type compounds and their theoretical capacities. Thus, it is important to explore the reasons for this situation through some advanced characterization techniques. Only in this way can we further improve their energy density to meet the commercial application requirements.

Among various polyanion-type materials for SIBs, fluorophosphates are regarded to be the most promising ones by their merits of stable structure and higher redox potential (around 4 V). Nevertheless, further application of widely researched vanadium-based fluorophosphates is hindered by the toxicity of elemental V and restricted capacity value (<150 mA h g−1). Therefore, we can consider partially replacing V with other environmentally friendly elements (such as Mn, Fe).
Although the development of cathode materials plays an important role in SIBs, the rapid pace toward the commercialization of SIBs demands an intensified exploration of full cells. Therefore, all components of the full cell, including the positive electrode, the negative electrode, the electrolyte, the binder, etc., should be equally valued. There are still a variety of challenges for polyanion type materials; to further understand and study their mechanism, as well as develop novel high-performance polyanion type materials are imperative. We hope that these efforts can promote the development of polyanion type materials and contribute to their practical application.
