Cu2+ ions partially enter into the titania structure leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies responsible for the shift in the band gap, but also the creation of traps for photogenerated holes and electrons. While the band gap shifts to lower energies with the copper content, a maximum photocatalytic activity is shown for the intermediate copper loading. Gas-phase operations allow a higher H2 productivity with respect to liquid-phase operations, and especially a higher selectivity (about 92–93%) to acetaldehyde. It is remarked that the route of photo-dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 and acetaldehyde has an economic value about 3.0–3.5 times higher than the alternative route of photoreforming to produce H2. Gas-phase operations would be preferable for the photo-dehydrogenation of ethanol.1. IntroductionThe possibility to recover H2 from waste organic streams in biorefineries using photocatalytic approaches is an attractive option to enhance process sustainability and produce valuable energy products.1 Various authors have investigated the photocatalytic reforming of biomass-derived products (biowaste) as a promising way to produce hydrogen using renewable energy.2,3 Ma et al.4 have investigated the photocatalytic reforming of methanol on Pt/TiO2–SO42− as a model reaction of biomass reforming. Colmenares et al.5 have studied Pt/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 for photocatalytic reforming of glucose water solutions. Gu et al.6 have analyzed the photocatalytic reforming of 2-propanol over Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst. Xu et al.7 have explored the photocatalytic hydrogen production by reforming of biomass by-products (methanol, glycerol and glucose) using different Pt/TiO2 photocatalysts with variable ratio of the anatase–rutile titania phases. The same research group has also investigated the H2 production via photocatalytic reforming of methanol on Au/TiO2 catalyst8 and the role of surface modification of titania by anion adsorption to control the selectivity in H2 formation.9 De Oliveira Melo and Silva10 have used Pt/CdS/TiO2 hybrid photocatalysts for the photoreforming of glycerol. Daskalaki and Kondarides11 have analyzed the photocatalytic reforming of aqueous solutions of glycerol using a Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst. Bowker et al.12 have also investigated the photocatalytic reforming of glycerol to H2 over Pd- and Au-modified TiO2 catalysts.An intense research activity on this topic was thus made in recent years, but mainly focused on the use of titania modified with noble metals and the reaction of photoreforming of biomass byproducts, e.g. with conversion of the organic to CO2. With few exceptions,13 the reaction was studied using the photocatalyst in the form of a solid dispersed in the liquid phase (an aqueous solution containing the biomass-derived products). From the practical perspective it would be preferable the use of a thin film of the solid catalyst (avoids the problems related to separation, leaching, etc.) in contact with a gaseous stream containing the biowaste, because (i) many unused gaseous waste streams are present in biorefinery, (ii) it is avoided light scattering due to the liquid (thus better potential efficiencies in light use) and (iii) product recovery is easier and less costly. In addition, avoiding the use of noble metals is an important further target, to produce cheaper and environmental friendly catalysts. Few studies have investigated the photoproduction of H2 from biowastes using photocatalysts not containing noble metals.14From the application perspective, it would be also interesting the possibility of co-production of H2 and a valuable chemical by photoconversion rather than carbon dioxide, in order to have better process economics. A good example could be the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 and acetaldehyde, as alternative to the ethanol photoreforming: CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + H2 (photo-dehydrogenation)(1) CH3CH2OH + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 6H2 (photoreforming)(2)In terms of product value at actual costs (assuming 100% selectivity in both reactions), the first route has an economic value about 3.0–3.5 times higher than the second route. Selectivity and operations in gas phase are important aspects for the first route, in order to facilitate product recovery and purification.The aim of this investigation was thus to investigate the reaction of ethanol photo-dehydrogenation using CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites as photocatalysts. The focus of the investigation was the use of the photocatalyst in the form of a thin film for the conversion of ethanol in an inert (N2) gas stream, for the motivations indicated above, but the same samples were also tested in the form of a powder suspended in an aqueous ethanol solution, in order to have a better comparison with literature data as well as to understand pros and cons for gas versus liquid phase operations.In the last decade an increasing attention has been devoted to Cu2O and CuO as photocatalyst in combination with TiO2.14–24 The copper oxides show a band gap lower than titania (2.1 eV for Cu2O and 1.2 eV for CuO), making them as suitable candidates for photo-splitting water and/or photoreforming to produce hydrogen by using visible light. Unfortunately the copper oxides are unstable in electrolytic solutions because of their facile photo-oxidation, but the interaction with TiO2 by heterojunction may enhance protection against photo-corrosion.25Few studies have been reported on ethanol photo-dehydrogenation, because the oxidative dehydrogenation rather than dehydrogenation or photo-oxidation has typically been investigated.26–29 A recent interesting result has been reported by Lu et al.30 which showed that on rutile TiO2 the ethanol photo-oxidation selectively forms 2,3-butanediol, while acetaldehyde and acetal are the main products (together with acetic acid and other minor products) on anatase TiO2. The butanediol forms by coupling of two ethanol radicals formed by reaction of ethanol with photogenerated holes on TiO2, while protons are reduced to H2 using the photogenerated electrons at Pt nanoparticles supported on TiO2. Reaction times, however, were quite long, up to over 60 h. Other authors instead observed only the formation of acetaldehyde over Pt/TiO2, but in the presence of O2, e.g. forming H2O instead of H2.31–33A further aim of this work was to better understand the analogies and differences between gas and liquid phase photoproduction of H2 from biowaste, because very few studies have investigated this aspect,13 which is relevant from the practical and fundamental perspectives, as well as for a better engineering design of the photochemical processes.34–37 There are various types of photo-reactors used in literature for testing photoactive materials for H2 production,38–41 but typically based on a slurry-type reactor design showing various drawbacks for practical implementation: light scattering phenomena, difficulties to recover the photo-catalytic materials at the end of the process, easy catalyst leaching, difficulty in translating the results to plate-type photo-reactors using solar light, etc.42In this work we have thus used a solar device based on the use of the photocatalyst in the form of a thin film (about 50 microns thickness) over a conductive substrate (titanium foil) to measure eventually the photocurrent generated by illumination with a solar lamp. This photocatalyst is mounted in a gas phase flow reactor. The potential advantages of operating in gas phase with respect to the traditional slurry photo-chemical reactors are the following: (i) minimization of scattering phenomena, (ii) good pattern of irradiation, (iii) ability to transfer the power coming from sunlight to a conductive substrate, (iv) easier scale-up, (v) elimination of problems associated to metal-leaching and (vi) easier product recovery. The design is analogous to that used for light-illuminated sides of photoelectrochemical devices for producing H2 and O2 by water splitting.43,442. Experimental2.1 Photocatalyst preparationAll the reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Bidistilled water was used in all the preparations. TiO2 supports were synthesized by sol–gel (SG), precipitation from titanyl sulphate (PS) and by water-in-oil microemulsion (ME) procedure. Briefly, TiO2-SG was prepared by hydrolysis of titanium butoxide in ethanol in presence of HNO3 as catalyst.45 The gel was aged at room temperature for 24 h, dried at 80 °C overnight and finally calcined at 450 °C for 6 h. TiO2-PS was prepared by precipitation of an aqueous solution of TiOSO4 with NaOH 0.15 M until pH = 5.5 was reached.46 After aging at room temperature for 24 h, the precipitate was filtered, carefully washed to remove sulphate and sodium ions, dried at 80 °C overnight and finally calcined at 450 °C for 6 h. TiO2-ME was prepared in a two-step procedure at 25 °C. In the first step, a microemulsion of water-in-oil was obtained adding water into a cyclohexane solution containing the surfactant tert-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-100). In the second step, hydrolysis and polycondensation of tetraisopropyl orthotitanate (Ti(i-PrO)4) were performed by addition a cyclohexane solution of Ti(i-PrO)4 into the microemulsion system. After 16 h, the precipitate was filtered, washed, dried and calcined in air at 450 °C for 6 h.Copper particles were loaded on the supports by photo-deposition technique. Usually 1 g of TiO2 (SG, PS or ME) was suspended in a water–methanol 1:1 by volume solution containing copper nitrate. The amount of Cu(NO3)2·H2O was changed in order to obtain the desired Cu loading (1.0 or 2.5 wt%). After stirring for 30 min, the suspension was irradiated with a 125 W medium pressure Hg lamp for 2 h. The samples were finally filtered and dried. In the presence of light, a rapid change from green to black in the colour of the suspension was observed, indicating that the copper is easily reduced to Cu(0) and deposited on the support. All the samples showed a stable evolution of H2 during the catalysts preparation. The nature of TiO2 and the loading of Cu affect the H2 evolution rate. The amount of residual Cu in the solution after photodeposition was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Immediately after photodeposition in a glove box under argon, an aliquot of the suspension was filtered using a 0.45 μm membrane (Millipore) and the mother liquor was subjected to the analysis for the Cu determination. All the solutions were analyzed by ICP-AES using a Spectroflame Modula E Optical Plasma Interface (OPI) instrument by SpectroTM. The total copper concentration was evaluated using calibration curves obtained by dilution of Spectrascan™ copper standard solutions for ICP-AES analysis (Teknolab A/S, Norway). All standards (range: 0.1–50.0 mg L−1) were prepared using a MeOH–H2O 1:1 solution to compensate the matrix effect. The used emission wavelength was 324.754 nm, the limit of detection 0.03 mg L−1 and the repeatability of measurements expressed as relative standard deviations (RSD%) and calculated on 6 replicates of various samples was lower than 4%. Calibration curves obtained by means of 5 standard solutions had correlation coefficients higher than 0.998. The ICP analysis of the liquid phase evidenced that the amount of dissolved Cu was below the detection limit of the technique. Therefore it is reasonable to consider that with this preparation method the deposition of Cu is quantitative and consequently nominal and real amount of Copper introduced on the TiO2 are identical.In order to obtain a thin film of photoactive substrate, a paste was prepared by mixing 1 g of CuOx/TiO2 (SG, PS or ME, 1.0 or 2.5 wt%) with 10 mL of a solution consisting of water (H2O, 51 wt%), absolute ethanol (EtOH, 47 wt%) and polyethylene glycol (PEG 2000, 2 wt%). The paste was then deposited on a conductive substrate (Ti plate) by doctor-blade technique. After deposition, the substrate was annealed at 200 °C to eliminate all the organic.The photocatalyst film area is about 10 cm2, with at thickness of about 50 μm, and a total photocatalyst loading of about 100 mg. Due to slight differences in photocatalyst loading between the different samples, the catalytic data have been normalized to the same catalyst loading of 100 mg.2.2 Sample characterizationThe materials were characterized by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis using a Micromeritic ASAP2020 after degassing the samples overnight at 350 °C. Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a computer-controlled Philips X'Pert diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), while UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded by a Jasco V570 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere for solid samples using BaSO4 as reference and in air.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL2010F instrument, with 0.21 nm spatial resolution at Scherzer defocus conditions. High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF STEM) images were recorded on the same microscope by using an electron probe of 0.5 nm of diameter and a diffraction camera length of 12 cm. The use of STEM mode in combination with X-EDS detectors (Oxford Instrument) allows the possibility to corroborate the nature of the particles by perform chemical analysis with a spatial resolution better than 1 nm. To avoid any contact with solvents, samples were deposited by deeping the holey-carbon coated Mo grids into the fresh powder catalysts. The grids were previously pretreated at 200 °C under pure hydrogen flow to clean them and prevent desorption of volatile carbon base molecules during the quasi in situ experiments. The sample pretreatment was performed in a homemade reaction cell coupled to a vacuum transfer holder (VTST4006, GATAN Ltd.). This special holder was used to transfer the sample to the microscope under anaerobic conditions. A standard analytical single tilt holder was used to study the oxidized samples.2.3 Gas-phase photo-reactor for H2 productionThe photo-active thin films were tested in H2 production by simulated solar irradiation. The apparatus for the photocatalytic experiments consists of (i) a solar illuminator source, (ii) a photo-reactor and (iii) a gas chromatograph (GC). The light source is a Xe-arc lamp (ORIEL, 300 W), installed within a lamp housing with a set of lenses for light collection and focusing and a water filter to eliminate the infrared radiation. Moreover the possibility to use filters to select the wavelength band allows to simulate sunlight under standard terrestrial solar spectral irradiance distributions (i.e. Air Mass 1.5G). The photo-reactor is homemade. It is made in Pyrex and equipped with a quartz window which allows irradiating a photo-catalytic area of ∼10 cm2 (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1  Simplified scheme of the gas phase photo-reactor used to study the performances of CuOx/TiO2 photocatalysts in the form of thin films in ethanol photo-dehydrogenation. The CuOx/TiO2-based substrate, prepared as thin film, was suspended within the reactor headspace (300 mL) and irradiated perpendicularly by light coming from the external lamp. A liquid phase (aqueous ethanol solution) having controlled temperature (60 °C) and composition was present on the bottom of the reactor and maintained the gas phase in equilibrium with the liquid phase. A small continuous flow of inert gas (10 mL min−1) was fluxed to the reactor to facilitate the evaporation and also to monitor composition. It was checked that in the absence of irradiation, the gas phase composition maintained as constant within the time of experiments. By using an evaporating aqueous solution of ethanol with 10 vol% and a temperature of 60 °C, the gas feed composition (vol%) was the following: 1.5% ethanol, 19% water, 79.5% inert gas. A gas chromatograph (GC) with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) was used to analyze the permanent gases (H2, O2, CH4 and CO) by a molecular sieve column (5A Plot). Carbon dioxide, ethanol and acetaldehyde were instead analyzed by a fused silica column (Rt-Qbond). The total incident solar irradiance at a distance of 20 cm from the lamp was estimated to be 100 mW cm−2. Tests of incident light absorption on the photo-reactor carried out at 554 nm by using a standard solution of rhodamine B gave an irradiance value of 5.1 × 10−5 mW cm−2.2.4 Liquid-phase photo-reactor testsResults of H2 productivity were also compared with those obtained by using a slurry photo-reactor. Even though the two reactor configurations are quite different, we have expressed the rates of H2 productions per units of photocatalyst weight, in order to compare results. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated for the hydrogen production from aqueous solutions of ethanol 1:1 by volume. For UV-vis experiments, 500 mg of catalyst were suspended in 240 mL of solution and the suspension was irradiated with a 125 W medium pressure Hg lamp. For visible experiments, 100 mg of catalyst were suspended into 80 mL of solution and the suspension was irradiated using a solar simulator equipped with a 150 W Xe lamp filtered with an atmospheric filter to reduce the fraction of UV photons. Argon flow (15 mL min−1) was employed to remove air from the reactor and as carrier for the reaction products. Gaseous products were analyzed by a GC analysis using a TCD for the quantification of H2 and a Flame Ionization Detector (FID), couple with a methanator, for the quantification of the C-containing compounds (CO, CO2, CH4, etc.). The by-products present in the liquid phases after catalytic activity were analyzed by GC-MS using a HP 7890 GC equipped with a DB-225ms column (J&W) and a HP 5975C mass spectrometer.3. Results and discussion3.1 Characterization of CuOx/TiO2 samplesTable 1 summarizes the results of the textural (by BET method) and structural (by XRD method) characterization of CuOx/TiO2 samples.

Powder X-ray diffraction was employed to estimate the relative content of the different TiO2 polymorphs by the integrated intensity of the anatase (101), rutile (110), and brookite (121) reflections, according to the literature.47 The XRD pattern evidenced the presence of a mixture of polymorphs for TiO2-SG and TiO2-ME. The powder XRD pattern of TiO2-PS showed the presence of a pure anatase phase, with a mean crystallite size of 7 nm. XRD analysis of the CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites did not allow the identification of Cu-related phases, reasonably due to their low amount and/or small size of the nanoparticles.A HRTEM image of the CuOx (Cu 1.0 wt%)/TiO2-ME sample is reported in Fig. 2. Rather small copper particles well dispersed over crystalline TiO2 phase are present. Fig. 2  Representative HREM image of the sample CuOx (Cu 1 wt%)/TiO2-ME. In order to determine the copper particle size distribution, high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used in combination with X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (XEDS) chemical analysis. Fig. 3 shows the results for CuOx/TiO2-ME sample with 1.0 and 2.5 wt% copper loading. There is a relatively narrow distribution of copper particles (in the 0.5–3.0 nm range) which does not significantly change increasing the loading. Average particle diameter is about 1.5 nm. It should be pointed out that samples were analyzed after mildly reduction (pure hydrogen at 70 °C) and subsequently transferred to the TEM under anaerobic conditions, in order to prevent particle re-oxidation. This procedure allows simulating the possible reduction occurring during photo-dehydrogenation experiments and increases the particle contrast. Fig. 3  Representative HAADF image of the samples CuOx (Cu 1.0 wt%)/TiO2-ME (A) and CuOx (Cu 2.5 wt%)/TiO2-ME (B) and of the relative estimated copper particle distribution. HAADF-STEM images and the relative copper particle size distributions for Cu 1.0 wt% CuOx/TiO2-SG (A) and CuOx/TiO2-PS (B) samples are reported in Fig. 4, which were obtained using the same pre-reduction and anaerobic transfer routine. CuOx/TiO2-SG shows also the presence of relatively small copper oxide nanoparticles in the 0.5–3.5 nm range, with an average diameter only slightly higher than that of CuOx/TiO2-ME samples (1.7 vs. 1.5 nm). CuOx/TiO2-PS sample instead shows larger particles in the 3.0–6.0 nm range, with an average size of 4.3 nm. Also for these samples, no significant changes in particle size distribution were noted on increasing the copper loading from 1.0 to 2.5 wt%.48 Fig. 4  Representative HAADF image of the samples CuOx (Cu 1.0 wt%)/TiO2-SG (A) and CuOx (1.0 wt%)/TiO2-PS (B) and of the relative estimated copper particle distribution. Fig. 5A reports the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CuOx/TiO2 samples prepared according with the three studied modalities and with 1.0 and 2.5 wt% copper loading. The spectra of the bare TiO2 samples (without deposited copper) are also shown in Fig. 5A. For reference, the spectrum of TiO2 P25 Degussa (commercial) is reported. Fig. 5B shows instead the spectra of CuOx/TiO2 samples obtained after electronic subtraction of the TiO2 contribution. Fig. 5  (A) UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CuOx/TiO2 samples and of their corresponding TiO2 samples without deposited copper. For reference, the spectrum of TiO2 P25 Degussa (commercial) is also reported. (B) Spectra of CuOx/TiO2 samples after electronic subtraction of the TiO2 contribution. Bare TiO2 exhibits a strong absorption band centred at about 350 nm related to the lowest energy charge transfer Ti4+ → O2− and thus associated to the band gap which could be estimated to be in the 3.0–3.1 eV range, consistent with expectations for a mixture of anatase, brookite and rutile TiO2 polymorphs (see Table 1). Their modification by copper shifts the band gap, up to about 2.5 eV depending on the copper loading and method of preparation. Fig. 6 reports the estimated band gap (Ebg) values for the samples, calculated from the plot of absorbance vs. photon energy in electron-volts, from the formula λ = 1239.8/Ebg (absorbance has been extrapolated up to x-axis to obtain the band gap energy). Values are consistent with earlier findings, although prepared by different methods.22,49 Fig. 6  Dependence of the band gap on the copper loading and method of preparation in CuOx/TiO2 samples. While the trend of CuOx/TiO2 samples prepared by SG and ME methods is similar, the CuOx/TiO2 samples prepared by PS method all have a higher eV band gap, probably due to the fact that titania is present only in the anatase crystalline form (Table 1) differently from the other two preparation methods.Fig. 5B shows the specific contribution to the diffuse reflectance spectra due to copper species, obtained by subtracting electronically the spectrum of bare TiO2 from the CuOx/TiO2 spectra. A broad, relatively intense, absorption in the 600–1200 nm, centred at 767 nm with a shoulder on the lower energy side (at about 1105 nm), is present. This absorption is typical for d–d transitions in Cu2+ in octahedral or slightly distorted octahedral coordination.50–52 Being copper ions present in tetrahedral coordination in CuO, the presence of this relatively strong absorption (in considerations of the significantly lower ε value in d–d transitions with respect to charge transfer bands), indicates that a not-negligible part of copper is incorporated into TiO2 crystal structure. Substitution of Cu2+ ions in TiO2 lattice leads to formation of oxygen vacancy along the [110] direction53 with a distorted octahedral coordination for copper consistent with the observed d–d bands (Fig. 5A). The lattice deformation associated to this effect54 decreases the conduction band of TiO2 leading to the observed change in the band gap.The substitution of copper ions in TiO2 also introduces intervalence charge transfer bands (Cu → O–Ti) which are expected in the region around 400 nm, as experimentally observed (Fig. 5B). There is a good relation between the intensities (estimated by spectral deconvolution) of the band at around 400 nm and that of the broad band in the 600–1200 nm range, consistently that they are associated to the same species.Copper-doped TiO2 may thus extend its absorption in the visible region enhancing the photocatalyst response, but at the same time the increase of the oxygen vacancy concentration at the higher copper loading also increases the presence of trap sites for the photogenerated electrons and holes.3.2 Photocatalytic behaviour in gas-phase experimentsThe behaviour of the different CuOx/TiO2 samples in the H2 formation during ethanol photo-dehydrogenation in gas-phase experiments is reported in Fig. 7A, while Fig. 7B reports the dependence of the H2 productivity (mg of hydrogen per g of TiO2 and hour; about 10 cm2 of surface irradiated with simulated solar light) on the copper loading and type of preparation. Fig. 7A shows also the photocatalytic hydrogen production over TiO2 P25 Degussa (commercial), doped with Cu 1.0 wt% as reference material. Fig. 7  (A) Hydrogen production as a function of time in gas-phase photocatalytic experiments of ethanol photo-dehydrogenation over CuOx/TiO2 catalysts with different copper loading and catalyst preparation. (B) Catalyst productivity to H2 formation (mg of H2 per g of TiO2 and hour; about 10 cm2 of surface irradiated with simulated solar light). There is a good linear dependence of the formation of H2 with time of reaction, indicating that there are no deactivation effects at least during the time of these experiments (5 hours). The modification of TiO2 with copper enhances the productivity to H2, but SG and PS preparations show a maximum of productivity at the intermediate copper level, while a linear increase with copper loading is shown for the ME preparation. The initial H2 production rate (first 90 min) for TiO2 P25 Degussa is also high similarly to SG Cu 1% sample; then its slope diminishes suggesting the occurrence of some deactivation process.Table 2 reports the ethanol conversion in gas phase obtained after 5 hour of irradiation for all the CuOx/TiO2 catalysts investigated.
Table 2 Ethanol conversion for all the CuOx/TiO2 catalysts tested in gas phase

Photo-catalystConversion (%)TiO2-SG Cu 1.0%80.1TiO2-SG Cu 2.5%74.7TiO2-PS Cu 1.0%88.5TiO2-PS Cu 2.5%81.6TiO2-ME Cu 1.0%58.5TiO2-ME Cu 2.5%67.6The behaviour of conversion is very similar to H2 productivity, being higher when the Cu loading is 1.0% for SG and PS preparations, and 2.5% for ME. The maximum of conversion (88.5%) was obtained for the TiO2 PS (Cu 1.0%) sample, while for TiO2 ME (Cu 1.0%) it was only 58.5%.A comparison of the performances of these photocatalysts with literature data is difficult, because most of the studies were made in liquid phase using slurry-type reactors. However, as indicative comparison, Yang et al.,55 studying the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from ethanol over M/TiO2 samples (M = Pd, Pt or Rh), reported rates of reaction at the best of 0.4 g H2 per g catalyst and hour, but using an ultraviolet Hg lamp. Yu et al.,56 studying the photocatalytic hydrogen production from glycerol over CuO/TiO2 catalysts in liquid phase, instead observed maximum H2 production rates of 0.4 mg H2 per g catalyst and hour. Lu et al.30 reported a maximum H2 production rate on Pt/TiO2 catalysts of 33 mg H2 per g catalyst and hour. Taking into account the different operative conditions, the data of H2 productivity reported in Fig. 7 appear in line with literature.The full set of data for the different samples is shown in Fig. 8 reporting in addition to H2 formation also the production of acetaldehyde, methane and carbon monoxide, the other products detected. Fig. 8  Gas-phase photocatalytic experiments of ethanol photo-dehydrogenation over CuOx/TiO2 catalysts with different copper loading and catalyst preparation. Acetaldehyde is the main product detected, while CH4 and CO are always formed in very small amounts. Carbon dioxide forms only in traces. Methane and CO form reasonably from the decomposition/H-shift of acetaldehyde according to eqn (3): CH3CHO → CH4 + CO(3)The presence of only traces of CO2 may suggest that the reactions of ethanol or acetaldehyde photoreforming (eqn (2) and (4)) are negligible: CH3CHO + 3H2O → 2CO2 + 5H2(4)However, CO2 can fast be converted to CO by water gas shift (WGS) reaction (eqn (5)) upon formed: CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O (WGS)(5)Methane and CO were detected in nearly equimolecular amounts (as expected from eqn (3)), but always with a slight excess of CO with respect to methane. Thus, photoreforming (eqn (2) and (4)) may occur, but with a rate about 40 times lower than that of photo-dehydrogenation.The selectivity to acetaldehyde after 5 h of irradiation with respect to the detected products of ethanol conversion (acetaldehyde, CH4 and CO) is always in the 92–95% range, indicating thus a quite selective photoconversion. In CuOx/TiO2-PS samples, there is a good H2 balance (>95%) between that observed experimentally and that expected on the basis of the products of reaction detected (acetaldehyde, CO and CH4), the stoichiometry of H2 generations in eqn (1)–(5), and assuming that the excess of CO with respect to an equimolecular amount of methane (eqn (3)) derives from the CO2 produced by photoreforming and converted to CO by WGS. There is only a slightly initial deviation, reasonably due to the formation of some species like acetates (due to acetaldehyde oxidation by surface sites) that remain adsorbed on the catalyst, consistently with Nadeem et al.32 observations.In CuOx/TiO2-SG and -ME samples, however, there is an excess of H2 formed with respect to that expected from acetaldehyde, CO and CH4 products. Titania is present in these samples in rutile and brookite polymorphs together with anatase (see Table 1), while only anatase was present in CuOx/TiO2-PS samples. It is thus reasonable to attribute the different behaviour observed to the different polymorphic composition. As mentioned in the introduction, Lu et al.30 observed that on rutile TiO2 the ethanol photo-oxidation selectively forms 2,3-butanediol, while acetaldehyde and acetal are the main products on anatase TiO2. We were not able to detect the butanediol, but possibly it remains trapped in the catalyst. The formation of this product, however, could explain the higher H2 formation of these samples with respect to acetaldehyde. The results are also consistent with the photoreaction mechanism proposed by Nadeem et al.57 indicating that ethanol is converted to ethoxides which react with two photogenerated holes giving rise to α-hydroxyethyl radical further converted to acetaldehyde, while the two photogenerated electrons react with protons to produce H2. If the further conversion of α-hydroxyethyl radical is slow, the formation of 2,3-butanediol by radical recombination is possible, as in the case of ZnS (ref. 58) and the cited Lu et al.30 results.3.3 Photocatalytic behaviour in liquid-phase experimentsFig. 9 reports the H2 evolution from the different CuOx/TiO2 samples in liquid phase experiments, using a 1:1 water–ethanol mixture and 0.5 g of photocatalyst suspended in solution. The results are in good agreement with those in gas-phase (Fig. 7A). A maximum in productivity to hydrogen is observed for the 1.0 wt% copper loading, and the SG preparation gives result to more productive samples. On the average, catalyst productivity to H2 is about 20% lower in liquid phase experiments, even though the different experimental conditions and irradiation modalities (UV-lamp in liquid phase experiments vs. solar illuminator for gas phase) have to be taken into account. However, these results may further support the indication that gas phase operations could result in better performances with respect to the much more extensively investigated liquid-phase operations. Fig. 9  Hydrogen production as a function of time in liquid-phase photocatalytic experiments of ethanol photo-dehydrogenation over CuOx/TiO2 catalysts with different copper loading and catalyst preparation (A) under UV/vis and (B) sunlight simulated irradiation: (a) Cu (1.0 %)/TiO2-SG; (b) Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-SG; (c) Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-PS; (d) Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-PS; (e) Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-ME; (f) Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-ME; (g) Cu (1.0%)/TiO2 P25 Degussa. The product distribution in liquid-phase experiments of the different CuOx/TiO2 samples is reported in Fig. 10. Under the adopted reaction condition (large excess of sacrificial agent and duration of the irradiation) the variation of the ethanol concentration is negligible. Fig. 10  By-products detected in the gas stream during liquid-phase photocatalytic experiments of ethanol photo-dehydrogenation over CuOx/TiO2 catalysts with different catalyst preparation and copper loading under UV-vis irradiation of Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-SG (a), Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-SG (b), Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-PS (c), Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-PS (d), Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-ME (e) and Cu (2.5%)/TiO2-ME (f) and under sunlight simulated irradiation for Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-SG (g), Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-PS (h) and Cu (1.0%)/TiO2-ME (i). Please, note the different time scales. Acetaldehyde is the main product observed of ethanol conversion, and its amount linearly increases with respect to the time of irradiation. As a consequence of ethanol dehydrogenation, large quantities of acetaldehyde are produced and whose concentration continuously increased in the gas stream (Fig. 10), due to the equilibration with the products in the liquid phase. The order of activity in acetaldehyde formation is SG > ME ≅ PS and with 1.0 wt% Cu > 2.5 wt% Cu samples. Ethylene, produced by ethanol dehydration (eqn (6)), is also present: CH3CH2OH → CH2CH2 + H2O(6)Ethylene forms immediately after illumination, but the rate of formation decreases during irradiation time, e.g. the formation of ethylene occurs only initially, and then stops, being these experiments made in a batch-type photo-reactor. Ethylene formation may thus be associated to initial acid sites created upon illumination with UV light (deriving from OH formed by reaction of ethanol with photogenerated holes), but which then disappear during the reaction. An initial small formation of CO2, later disappearing, is also observed, confirming the indication of initial photoreforming followed by WGS reaction.Methane is also detected in small amounts, as well in ME samples, small amounts of also ethane, reasonably deriving from the coupling of methyl radicals. For the longer times, ethane disappears and increases the formation of methane, although both these products form in rather small amounts. Their trend, however, confirms the indication that there is an evolution in the catalyst photochemistry, with an initial slow rate of reaction of the radical type species (such as α-hydroxyethyl radical, formed by reaction of ethanol with the photogenerated holes) with further photogenerated holes. These radicals may thus give coupling reactions, or react with other species (such as methane) to give further radicals.3.4 Role of copper speciesTwo types of copper species have been identified to be present in CuOx/TiO2 samples:- a Cu2+ species in titania lattice by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and associated to the creation of oxygen vacancies responsible for band gap shift and the creation of trap sites for the photogenerated holes/electrons as well;- CuOx nanoparticles, identified by electron microscopy, which reasonably reduce during photoreduction process14 and to which may be attributed the change in the behaviour during time on stream.In fact, we have commented before that initial behaviour of the catalysts may be interpreted in terms of easy formation of α-hydroxyethyl radical by reaction of ethanol with the photogenerated holes, but slow reaction of this radical species with further photogenerated holes, and thus possibility of side reactions. Although with some differences, the same observation is valid for gas- and liquid-phase operations. For longer times of reaction, instead the further reaction of the α-hydroxyethyl radical becomes faster.This change may be explained considering the in situ (photo)reduction of CuOx nanoparticles,14 due also to the increasing amount of H2 generated in the photo-dehydrogenation of ethanol. The reduction generates metallic copper nanoparticles which by heterojunction effect stabilize the photogenerated electrons and their reaction with H+ to generate H2. It is known that this mechanism reduces the rates of recombination of h+/e− thus making the holes more available for the further reaction with α-hydroxyethyl radical to generate acetaldehyde, thus inhibiting side reactions of this radical species. It is known that solvent molecules partially stabilize radical species and it is thus reasonable why the presence of this radical-chemistry is less evident in gas-phase with respect to liquid-phase operations, and why selectivity in acetaldehyde formation is higher in gas-phase operations.Electron microscopy data evidence that the particle size distribution after mild reduction (which simulates that occurring during ethanol photo-dehydrogenation experiments) does not changes significantly with respect to the fresh sample.48 Thus, initial CuOx size distribution also determines the size distribution of the in situ formed (reduced) copper particles. While SG and ME samples have a similar copper particles distribution, PS samples show the presence of larger nanoparticles. However, there is no apparent relationship between copper particle size and photocatalytic behaviour in the investigated samples. It may thus be not reasonable to relate the enhanced photocatalytic behaviour (with respect to bare TiO2) to the presence of these copper particles, although they have a role in modifying the surface reactivity and life-time of photogenerated species, as discussed before.It appears thus more correct to relate the main role of copper to the modification of titania, due to the partial incorporation in the lattice. Brant et al.53 have in detail demonstrated the formation of oxygen vacancies (adjacent to Cu2+ ions) resulting from Ti4+ substitution in TiO2 lattice, while Sahu and Biswas49 have shown how this effect is related to the shift in band gap of Cu-doped TiO2 nanomaterials. The shift in band gap increases the light absorption and thus the activity in H2 photogeneration, but the creating of these oxygen vacancies introduces trapping sites that favour h+/e− recombination. It is thus reasonable to expect, as experimentally observed, a maximum in productivity on increasing the copper loading.We may note that there is no apparent relation between the activity and the surface area of the samples (Table 1), but the more active sample in H2 photoproduction is the SG sample, which contains the higher amount of rutile and brookite TiO2 polymorphs. In UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 5B) the band attributed to intervalence Cu2+ → Ti–O charge transfer is shifted from about 408 to 417 nm and a shoulder appear near 480 nm, reasonably related to the doping with copper ions of rutile and/or brookite TiO2 phases. Possibly, the synergy between copper-doped anatase and rutile/brookite phases is responsible for the enhanced productivity to H2. The synergistic effect between anatase and rutile TiO2 is known, e.g. that the addition of rutile can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic activity of anatase in the degradation of organic contaminants. Li et al.59 have shown how this effect is present also in photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. Li group7,60,61 has clearly shown this effect in hydrogen production from biomass reforming, and demonstrated how the presence of rutile small particles on TiO2anatase, due to photoinduced interfacial charge transfer, reduces the rate of recombination of trapped electrons with free holes, thus influencing the photocatalysis process of TiO2. It is thus reasonable that a similar effect could explain why SG samples show better H2 productivity with respect to ME and PS samples.3.5 Gas- vs. liquid-phase operationsAlthough the same catalysts were used for the comparison, the samples were used in the form of a thin film for gas phase operations and of a dispersed solid for liquid phase operations. The light illuminated perpendicularly the thin film in gas phase tests, while the lamp was immersed in the slurry reactor in liquid phase tests and the mean distance between the lamp and the catalysts is also different (about 20 cm in the case of gas phase tests, and few cm in liquid phase tests). The lamps were also different, a solar illuminator for gas phase tests, while an UV lamp for liquid phase operations. Therefore, even all the aspects were in favour of liquid phase operations, productivity to H2 in gas phase operations was found on the average 20% higher. Even with the necessary care due to the different reactor configurations, it may be possible to conclude that gas phase operations allow a better productivity to H2 than liquid phase operations, due to the reduced light scattering.In addition, the selectivity to acetaldehyde is in the 90–95% range for gas phase operations, while significantly lower (70–75%) for liquid phase operations. There are also advantages in terms of easier product recovery and absence of metal leaching. We could thus conclude that the use of gas phase operations is advantageous in ethanol photo-dehydrogenation and H2 production.3.6 Photo-dehydrogenation vs. photoreformingAs mentioned in the introduction, in the point of view of a potential industrial application, it would be interesting the co-production of H2 and a valuable chemical by photoconversion rather than carbon dioxide, in order to have better process economics. In the case of the photocatalytic dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 and acetaldehyde, as alternative to the ethanol photoreforming, at actual costs (assuming 100% selectivity in both reactions) the products value in ethanol photo-dehydrogenation have an economic value about 3.0–3.5 times higher than the photoreforming route.Using gas-phase operations, a high selectivity (over 90%) to acetaldehyde is observed and a stable behaviour, at least within the time of experiments, was observed. Product recovery and separation is also not difficult. Although reactor design and catalysts have to be improved, and the direct use of solar light has to be evaluated, the preliminary indications suggest the possibility to exploit on an industrial scale the process, in order to valorise gaseous waste emissions from biorefineries.4. ConclusionsEthanol photodehydrogenation to H2 and acetaldehyde using CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites represents an interesting possibility to valorise gaseous waste emissions from biorefineries, in alternative to photoreforming producing less valuable products. High selectivity (>90%) to acetaldehyde has been observed in gas phase operations, while liquid phase operations allow a lower selectivity and productivity.CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites represent also a valid alternative to the most investigated titania catalysts doped with noble metals. Samples prepared by copper photodeposition on TiO2 prepared by three different routes have been investigated here. Two types of copper species have been identified to be present: (i) a Cu2+ species in titania lattice and associated to the creation of oxygen vacancies responsible for band gap shift and the creation of trap sites for the photogenerated holes/electrons as well and (ii) CuOx nanoparticles. The second type of species reduce during the reaction forming well dispersed copper metal particles which favour electron trapping and the possibility of photogenerated holes to further convert the primary α-hydroxyethyl radical (generated also by interaction of ethanol with holes) to give acetaldehyde, limiting radical-type side reactions.14,48The photoactivity and productivity to H2 is instead related to the modification of TiO2 by Cu2+ ions, which generate oxygen vacancies, shifting the band gap (and thus promoting visible light activity), but creating also trap sites which favour recombination of h+/e− pairs. A maximum productivity is thus observed for an intermediate (1.0 wt%) copper loading.The presence of synergy between anatase and rutile/brookite TiO2 polymorphs (or their copper-doped equivalents) is a further aspect influencing the productivity in H2 formation and the catalytic behaviour.A further understanding of these aspects, as well as of the reactor design for gas phase operations, would be necessary to further optimize the catalytic behaviour in ethanol photo-dehydrogenation to H2 and acetaldehyde, but already these indications pointed out how CuOx/TiO2 nanocomposites are a valid alternative to the use of noble metal-based photocatalysts, and that the photo-dehydrogenation in gas phase operations is a potentially industrially attractive novel possibility to valorise gaseous biowaste in biorefinery and an environmentally attractive and energy efficient approach, particularly using solar light.A further development could derive from the use of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) cells43,62–64 and the use of nanostructured films of ordered titania nanotubes,65–67 doped with copper ions. In a photo-electrocatalytic approach, the vapours evaporating from a dilute aqueous organic solution are fed to a photo-anode chamber for the oxidation process, while protons migrate through a proton membrane to the cathodic side where combine with the electrons coming from the anode through an external circuit to produce H2. This approach would produce separate streams of H2 (at the cathodic side) and acetaldehyde plus unreacted ethanol at the anodic side. The use of ordered titania nanotubes allows a better light harvesting and reduced h+/e− pair recombination with respect to a film of TiO2 nanoparticles.43 It may also potentially act as photoactive membrane for advanced PEC cells,44 thus making further compact the cell design for exploiting the use of photo-dehydrogenation to valorise gaseous biowaste emissions.AcknowledgementsCA, RP, CG, SP and GC acknowledge financial support within the projects PON01_01725 and PONa3_00335.
