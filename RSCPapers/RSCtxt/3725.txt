    , Accepted 1st December 2014First published on 1st December 2014AbstractThe Cu–Pt nanocrystal (NC) samples with concisely controlled atomic ratios (Cu:Pt) are prepared by a facile strategy. We demonstrate that Cu–Pt (3:1) NCs exhibit the highest activity and faradaic efficiency in the CO2 electroreduction reaction among all the as-prepared samples.
The ever-increasing consumption of fossil fuels has accelerated the depletion of natural resources and led to the overproduction of carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.1–3 In the past few decades, different technologies have been proposed to reduce the emission of CO2. Among these technologies, conversion of CO2 into useful low-carbon fuels, such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, and CH3OH, represents an attracting technology because it offers a potential way to recycle CO2 into valuable products for energy needs or for industrial applications.4–8 In particular, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 has drawn extensive attention, as the reaction proceeds cleanly by utilizing sustainable energy (such as wind, solar and hydro).9–11 Unfortunately, this avenue is greatly inhibited by the lack of efficient catalysts, which should ideally possess sufficiently low overpotentials and high current densities to achieve high energetic efficiency. Therefore, exploring new electrocatalysts that efficiently reduce CO2 into liquid fuels, especially under mild conditions, is extremely important.
Researchers have demonstrated that copper is the most promising candidate among pure metals due to its unique ability to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to form hydrocarbons.12 However, the efficiency of Cu based catalysts is largely limited by the large overpotential (>0.7 V) required for CO2 reduction to outcompete H2O reduction.13,14 Also, both the selectivity towards the reduction products and the durability of the Cu-based catalysts should be substantially improved before meeting the requirements of practical applications.15–17 Moreover, the mechanism of CO2 reduction on Cu electrodes is complicated and the exact reaction path is controversial.18,19 Despite tremendous experimental efforts and computational calculations,20–23 the performance of Cu electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction remains unsatisfied. Recently, Cu-based alloys have been reported to possess improved faradaic efficiencies for CO2 reduction compared to both parent metals. It was found that even small additions of Au (10%) could completely suppress hydrocarbon formation, giving rise instead to the highly selective formation of CO.24 On the other hand, the activity of the Cu-based catalysts was reported to strongly depend on their structure and morphology.25,26 For example, compared with polycrystalline Cu, nanostructured Cu was demonstrated to possess much higher activity and better selectivity, whereas the major product was ethylene and methane.27 The enhanced performance was attributed to the large surface areas and unique structural properties of nanostructured Cu catalysts. More recently, several Cu-based bimetallic nanocrystals (NCs) appear as novel CO2 electrocatalysts due to their remarkable chemical and physical properties. To this end, Cu–noble metal (such as Au, Pt, Fe, and Ag) alloy NCs should be ideal candidates because of their easy preparation and desirable performance.22,24,28,29 For instance, Au3Cu nanocrystals (NCs) have been successfully prepared and exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity in the CO2 electroreduction reaction, compared with monometallic Au nanocrystals. Jin et al. found that the CO2 reduction current density on the Au3Cu NC electrode decreased with an increase of the mass of the Au precursor.30 Moreover, Pt-supported Cu overlayers were investigated for their catalytic activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction. It was found that hydrocarbon production was dependent on the Cu layer thickness.27
Cu–Pt alloy NCs has been previously prepared and used for a variety of applications, such as methanol or formic acid electro-oxidation,31–35 heterogeneous NOx reduction,36 CO oxidation37 and oxygen reduction reactions.38,39 However, as far as we know, Cu–Pt NCs have been rarely investigated as catalysts for electrochemical reduction of CO2, especially under mild conditions, such as 0.5 M KHCO3 (pH 7.3) at room temperature. Herein, we report the preparation of monodisperse Cu–Pt NCs by using a co-reduction strategy. By this synthetic method, uniform distribution of NCs can be realized and the atomic ratio of Pt and Cu can be concisely controlled. Correspondingly, the Cu–Pt NC samples show composition dependent activity towards electrochemical reduction of CO2. We discover that the sample of Cu–Pt (3:1) NCs exhibits the highest activity and faradaic efficiency as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction in 0.5 M KHCO3 at room temperature. Based on the analysis, we present a plausible mechanism to understand the composition dependent activity of Cu–Pt NCs.
The Cu–Pt NCs were prepared according to a modified procedure described by Fang et al.34 The Cu–Pt NCs prepared using different amounts of the Cu precursor and Pt precursor are given as Cu–Pt-1# (1:2), Cu–Pt-2# (1:1), Cu–Pt-3# (2:1), Cu–Pt-4# (3:1) and Cu–Pt-5# (5:1). Fig. 1a shows a typical transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image, displaying the overall morphology of Cu–Pt-2# (1:1). The sample consists of 24.0 ± 1.0 nm (side length) Cu–Pt NCs. A TEM diffraction pattern of the Cu–Pt NCs (Fig. 1b) indicates high crystallinity of these NCs (see below). Fig. 1c depicts the high-magnification TEM image of a single Cu–Pt NC, which reveals that the NCs are composed of many small nanoparticles. Moreover, the Cu weight ratios in the Cu–Pt NCs were extensively identified using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) to be 0.311, 0.542, 0.610, 0.759, and 0.812 for Cu–Pt-1#, Cu–Pt-2#, Cu–Pt-3#, Cu–Pt-4# and Cu–Pt-5#, respectively. These results indicate that the Cu/Pt atomic ratio in the as-synthesized Cu–Pt NCs was directly proportional to the precursors of the Cu(acac)2/Pt(acac)2 ratio.

In addition, we investigated the morphology of other Cu–Pt NCs samples with different molar ratios. It shows that all the samples have similar morphology, indicating that the different molar ratios of the Cu precursor and Pt precursor have no obvious influence on the morphology of the as-prepared Cu–Pt NCs (Fig. S1a–e, ESI†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of the as-prepared NCs are shown in Fig. S1f (ESI†). Each diffraction peak is located between the corresponding peaks of pure Pt and Cu, revealing typical characteristics of Cu–Pt alloy NCs. Noteworthy, the peak positions moves to the corresponding peak of pure Cu along with the increase of Cu content.
To examine the reduction of dissolved carbon dioxide in the electrolyte solution, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in a typical three-electrode system (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 2 shows CVs of the Cu–Pt NC modified electrodes in the absence and presence of CO2 in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. Generally, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a competing process of CO2 reduction at the electrode. Therefore, it is crucial to suppress hydrogen formation, since it consumes the applied energy instead of CO2 reduction. For the Cu–Pt-1# electrode, as shown in Fig. 2a, much higher reduction current was observed for N2 saturated solution than that for CO2 saturated solution. It strongly indicates that HER dominated the reduction process and the presence of CO2 seems to inhibit the HER at potentials lower than −1.1 V. In sharp contrast, all other samples exhibited obvious catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. The current density of CO2 reduction outcompeting HER could be simply calculated by subtracting the current density obtained at the black lines (HER current) from that recorded at the red lines (the overall current of HER and CO2 reduction), as inferred by the arrow lines in the figures. Noteworthily, we found that the activity of the Cu–Pt NCs should be closely associated with the composition of the NCs. Fig. 2b–d suggest that increasing the Cu content in the Cu–Pt NCs facilitates the reduction of CO2, leading to the enhanced activity of CO2 reduction. However, Fig. 2e shows that the Cu–Pt-5# sample for which Cu:Pt was increased to 5:1, CO2 reduction was subsequently suppressed. The results clearly indicate that an optimum content of Cu in the NCs is required to achieve maximum activity for CO2 reduction. To further clarify this point, Table S1 (ESI†) presents the onset potentials obtained with the samples in N2 and CO2 saturated conditions. Also, the current density of CO2 reduction at a potential of −1.3 V (vs. SCE) was calculated and compared in Table S1 (ESI†). Among all the samples, Cu–Pt-4#, for which the atomic ratio of Cu:Pt is 3:1, exhibited the best performance for CO2 reduction, i.e. the lowest onset potential (ca. −0.972 V) and highest CO2 reduction current density (ca. 0.598 mA cm−2 at −1.3 V vs. SCE).
 Fig. 2  The cyclic voltammograms of catalysts were recorded in N2- and CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 between −0.8 and −1.5 V (vs. SCE). (a) Cu–Pt-1#, (b) Cu–Pt-2#, (c) Cu–Pt-3#, (d) Cu–Pt-4#, and (e) Cu–Pt-5#. 
To compare the overall catalytic activities of the samples, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded in the 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a potential range from −0.6 to −1.6 V (vs. SCE). The solution was saturated with CO2 by bubbling CO2 gas for at least 30 min. Once again, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the Cu–Pt NC samples obviously exhibit composition dependent activities. Notably, Cu–Pt-4# gives the highest current density among all samples. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Cu–Pt NCs with an optimized atomic molar ratio of 3:1 (Cu:Pt) likely possess the highest activity both for CO2 reduction and for the overall reduction.
The selectivity of CO2 reduction is important for assessing the performance of a catalyst. In order to evaluate this, we used the on-line electrochemical gas chromatograph (GC) technique to detect gas productions and estimate their faradaic efficiency (FE). As illustrated schematically in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the on-line electrochemical GC setup consists of a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation, a home-made H-type electrochemical cell and a gas chromatography system. During electrolysis, the flow of the CO2 atmosphere was maintained and the electrolyte was kept under constant stirring. The GC analysis proves the presence of H2 and CH4 as the electrochemical reduction of CO2 takes place at the Cu–Pt NCs electrode under these conditions. The faradaic efficiency of the products was calculated according to the method described in the ESI.†40Fig. 3 summarizes the faradaic efficiency of H2 and CH4 obtained at the Cu–Pt-1#, Cu–Pt-2#, Cu–Pt-3#, Cu–Pt-4# and Cu–Pt-5# electrodes, respectively. The sample of Cu–Pt-4# gives the highest faradaic efficiency for CH4 with a value of 21%, which is comparable to the results previously reported by Buess-Herman et al. (ca. 20%), Jin et al. (ca. 38%) and Chorkendorff et al. (ca. 10%).24,30,41 In addition, we made a comparison between the achieved faradaic efficiency for methane of Cu–Pt NCs and of polycrystalline Cu and Cu nanoparticles. We found that the faradaic efficiency for methane of polycrystalline Cu and Cu nanoparticles was ca. 4% and 1%, respectively. This observation is in agreement with the previously reported results.25 These results indicate that the NCs have the advantage for CH4 production as a promising CO2 catalyst.

Finally, it is worth understanding the composition dependent activity of the Cu–Pt NCs, that is, why the sample of Cu–Pt (3:1) NCs exhibits the highest activity and faradaic efficiency for CO2 electroreduction. Peterson et al. have reported the DFT calculations, providing useful insights into how copper catalyses CO2 reduction to CH4.20 The DFT calculation suggests that a key step in the formation of CH4 from CO2 reduction is the protonation of adsorbed CO* to form adsorbed HCO* (CO* + H+ + e− → HCO*). It means that the selectivity-determining step for CO2 electroreduction on Cu involves the reduction of CO to CHO, which eventually leads to the formation of CH4.23 On the other hand, Pt is known as an element with high activity for HER due to its unique affinity for protons.42 Thus, the presence of Pt in the NCs should facilitate the protonation of adsorbed CO*. As a result, we assume that a synergistic effect between Cu and Pt should greatly benefit for producing CH4 by effective electroreduction of CO2. Fig. 4 presents a proposed mechanism illustrating the above depicted reaction process. However, a recent study elucidated that Pt in bimetallic catalysts would not be stable during the electrochemical reduction of CO2. The strong interaction between Pt and CO* would likely cause Pt segregation, therefore facilitating the HER over CO2 reduction.41 Similarly, we found that the Cu–Pt NCs suffer deactivation during the electrochemical reduction of CO2. We measured the efficiency of the reduction of CO2 as a function of time, which is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The production of methane from CO2 drops clearly in the beginning, and reaches an efficiency of ∼5% after 25 min. This should be related to the surface state of NCs caused by the electrochemical reaction, which requires more efforts to clarify. For Cu–Pt-1#, as the Pt content is high, the presence of CO2 in the solution leads to the production of CH4 at the cost of highly suppressing H2 production. Consequently, more adsorbed CO* was generated due to the increase of the Cu content in NCs, thereby improving the production of CH4. Therefore, an optimized atomic ratio of Cu and Pt (ca. 3:1) contributes to the highest activity of the NCs. However, too high a Cu content subsequently leads to a higher density of adsorbed CO*, while consequently to a lower density of adsorbed protons. Correspondingly, the overall performance of the NCs should be limited due to the low density of adsorbed protons at the catalyst surface. Meanwhile, we noted that a recently reported study of Au–Cu NCs indicated that Au3Cu NCs should give the highest performance for CO2 electroreduction.30 We suppose that the different optimum atomic ratios of Au:Cu and Pt:Cu might attribute to the different proton affinities of Pt and Au. Despite that our results should provide experimental evidence for supporting the DFT calculations for Cu–Pt NCs, substantial efforts are still needed to further elucidate clearly the detailed reaction procedure of CO2 electroreduction on bimetallic NCs.

In summary, we report the preparation of Cu–Pt NCs and investigate their application as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Uniform sized NCs with concisely controlled atomic ratios were prepared using a simple method. The NC samples exhibit composition dependent activities towards CO2 electroreduction. Among all the as-prepared samples, Cu–Pt (3:1) NCs exhibit the highest activity and faradaic efficiency as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in 0.5 M KHCO3 at room temperature. Based on the experimental analysis, we propose a reasonable mechanism to understand the CO2 electroreduction at the Cu–Pt bimetallic NC catalyst and illustrate the observed composition dependent activity of the NCs. This work highlights the importance of compositional effect of NCs on their catalytic activities and provides a strategy for designing efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction in the future.
