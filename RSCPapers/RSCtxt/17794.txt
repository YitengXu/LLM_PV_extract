    , Accepted 11th May 2022First published on 11th May 2022AbstractOrganic photoelectron conversion devices, due to their solution process and wide use in portable devices, have attracted intensive interest. Herein, a newly developed active layer of D18:Y6 is used to fabricate an organic photodetector and the device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/Phen-NaDPO/Ag shows a responsivity of 680 mA W−1 and a detectivity of 6.35 × 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) at a wavelength of 850 nm. Additionally, this device shows a wide linear dynamic range of 120 dB, indicating a potential near-infrared region (NIR) detector system. Owing to the minimal exciton binding energy of 37.6 meV for Y6, a desirable energy offset for efficient electron–hole pair dissociation and an ultrafast charge transfer of ∼58 ps at the interface of D18:Y6, the obtained organic photodetector has demonstrated a photoresponse time as fast as 1.8 μs upon laser light excitation without an external driven voltage. More importantly, D18 shows a preferred out-of-plane orientation with strong intensities and Y6 exhibits a preferred orientation along the in-plane direction on lamellar stacking, which facilitates charge transport. This work has demonstrated significant progress in exploring D18:Y6 NIR organic devices with a wide photosensitivity linearity and ultrafast photoresponse.
Introduction
Nowadays, organic semiconductor materials are attracting great interest due to their extended capabilities and possibilities for the next generation low-cost optoelectronic devices through facile deposition techniques.1–3 Recently emerged high-performance photo-absorbing organic semiconductors have generated much progress in developing bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodetectors (OPDs).4–10 Bulk heterojunctions, containing blends of electron donors (D) and electron acceptors (A), offer an intrinsic driving force by forming numerous D/A interfaces to dissociate optically generated excitons into free electrons and holes.11–13 Due to the localized Frenkel or tightly bound excitons (binding energy of 0.1 to 1 eV) upon photoexcitation in organic active layers, large energy level offsets at D/A interfaces could become energetically favorable for fast exciton dissociation and efficient charge transfer.14,15 However, this large energy offset increases charge carrier recombination, hindering the improvement of the device performance.16–20 Therefore, idealized D/A interfaces are essential to obtain a high and fast photosensitivity of OPDs.
To meet the great demand in a variety of applications including imaging, telecommunication, environmental monitoring and defense sensing, it is of huge necessity to develop efficient photodetectors with an ultrafast photoresponse and broad response spectra ranging from the visible to near-infrared light region.21–24 Recently, organic materials have been utilized for fabricating low-cost PDs with a broadband response.25–27 Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), owing to their tunable absorption from the ultraviolet to the near infrared region and readily tailored chemical structures that enabled fine energy level match between electron donors and electron extraction layers, have successfully captured increasing attention and promoted the device performance.28 However, further improvement in responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) of broadband OPDs was hindered by their intrinsic large exciton binding energy and low charge-carrier mobilities.29R and D* are two key parameters in evaluating the performance of PDs, which are significantly dependent on the high photocurrent density and low dark current density.
In this study, we herein select a blend of donor D18 (a dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole(DTBT) based polymer) and non-fullerene acceptor ((2,20-((2Z,20Z)-((12,13-bis(2ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5] thiadiazolo [3,4-e] thieno [2′′,30′:4′,50] thieno [20,30:4,5] pyrrolo [3,2g] thieno [20,30:4,5]thieno[3,2-b] indole-2,10-diyl) bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)) dimalononitrile) (Y6) as the active layer for fabricating an organic photodetector. Due to the fairly low exciton binding energy of 37.6 meV of Y6, direct excitons could be effectively dissociated without an extra driving force such as the D18/Y6 interface in an efficient way, contributing to efficient charge separation efficiency. Additionally, a preferred orientation of D18 or Y6 films on lamellar stacking favors charge carrier transport in the device, leading to effective charge collection efficiency. The obtained OPD with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/Phen-NaDPO/Ag has shown a substantially low dark current density of 1.28 × 10−9 A cm−2 at 0 V. A self-powered high responsivity of 680 mA W−1 and a detectivity of 6.35 × 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) at a wavelength of 850 nm have been obtained due to the reduction of dark current and enhanced photocurrent generation. Notably, the organic photodetector exhibits a wide wavelength ranging from 300 to 1000 nm and an ultrafast photoresponse of 1.8 μs. Therefore, this work has demonstrated significant effort in exploring NIR organic devices with a wide photosensitivity linearity and ultrafast photoresponse.
Results and discussion
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of organic thin films are carried out to investigate the evolution of organic layers. The nanowires seen in Fig. 1a–c belong to D18 because the crystallinity of D18 is stronger than that of Y6. A good interpenetrating network structure with homogeneous phase separation is observed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which is due to their super miscibility between D18 and Y6.30 A homogeneous thin film surface is also observed in the AFM image (Fig. 1a–c and Fig. S2, ESI†); the roughness of neat D18 and Y6 thin films is 1.47 nm and 1.36 nm, respectively, while the roughness of the active layer is only 1.27 nm. Such a smooth surface facilitates direct contact with the subsequent electron extraction layer, which is beneficial for electron transport. In Fig. 1d, this active layer of the D18:Y6 mixture exhibits broadband absorption in the wavelength ranging from 380 nm to 1000 nm, which is the requisite for realizing high photocurrent responsivity and density in the OPD. The Y6 thin film has strong absorption in the wavelength of 850 nm, which is expected to contribute to high performance OPDs at the NIR.

Fig. 2a shows the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/Phen-NaDPO/Ag. And the corresponding energy level alignment and charge carrier transport/extraction process are illustrated in Fig. 2b, where Phen-NaDPO acted as the electron extraction layer, due to its deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which efficiently blocks holes extracted from the active layer to silver (Ag). The current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of the OPD are measured in the dark and under the illumination of monochromatic light at a wavelength (λ) of 780 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†) and 850 nm (Fig. 2c) with various light intensities, and the wavelength of 850 nm was selected as it is located in the near-infrared region and has strong absorbance intensity. It is obvious that an enhancement in current is observed once photons are projected onto OPDs compared to that under dark conditions, and the current is gradually enlarged with increased light intensity, which implies that charge carriers are transferred efficiently to electrodes. In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of OPDs, R is estimated according to the equation of (1)where Llight is the light intensity. At λ = 850 nm, this organic photodetector exhibited R values of 680, 558 and 535 mA W−1 at 0 V and 1209, 875 and 723 mA W−1 at −0.5 V for 0.0005, 0.005 and 0.05 mW cm−2, respectively. The specific detectivity (D*) is the key figure-of-merit parameter for PD devices, which describes the detection quality of optical signals. It is dependent on the device area, bandwidth, and noise current. Assuming that the total noise is mainly dominated by the shot noise, D* could be simplified to the shot-noise-limited specific detectivity,31,32 which could be obtained from (2)where in is the noise current, ish is the shot noise current and q is the absolute value of electron charge (q = 1.6 × 10−19 C) and the corresponding D* values are 1.83, 1.58 and 1.34 × 1013 Jones at −0.5 V for 0.0005, 0.005 and 0.05 mW cm−2, respectively (Table 1). These values are higher than those of the reported OPDs based on the Y6 non-fullerene acceptor (Table S2, ESI†),28,33,34 and are comparable to or even higher than those of commercial inorganic materials or perovskite PDs in some cases (Table 2).24,35 To obtain R quantitatively in the spectral range of 300 nm to 1000 nm, the R of OPDs versus wavelength is shown in Fig. 2d, (3)where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The calculated R values from EQE are a few hundred mA W−1 and D* is over 1013 Jones in the visible region. Specifically, it exhibits an R of 556 mA W−1 and a D* of 5.42 × 1013 Jones at a wavelength of 850 nm, which are consistent with those measured from the light intensity of 0.005 mW cm−2.

On the other hand, the D* value is accurately detected by measuring the noise current, which can be calculated as follows:36 (4)where NEP and inoise are the noise equivalent power and the noise current, respectively. To accurately detect the D* values, the noise spectral density of devices was measured (Fig. 2e). According to eqn (3), taking the noise spectral density at 10 Hz with a light intensity of 0.005 mW cm−2, the D* values of the OPDs were calculated to be 5.58 × 1010 Jones and 4.73 × 1010 Jones at 0 V and −0.5 V, respectively. When the noise spectral density increased to 105 Hz, the D* values of the OPDs were calculated to be 1.22 × 1013 Jones and 4.77 × 1012 Jones at 0 V and −0.5 V, respectively (Table S1, ESI†).
The frequency response of the OPD at 900 nm was characterized from 1 Hz to 105 Hz as shown in Fig. 2f, and it was obvious that the −3 dB cutoff frequency of devices based on D18:Y6 was determined to be 6.5 × 104 Hz, which predicted a fast photo-response process.37,38 The response time of the PD, a direct indication reflecting the PD performance, is also investigated. The rise time and decay time are defined as the interval in which the current increased from 10% to 90%, and transition from 90% down to 10% of the peak current,24 respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, it is measured that the rise time is 1.8 μs and the decay time is as small as 2.2 μs, indicating that this device exhibits an ultrafast response time, which is inherently related to the interpenetrating interfaces in the bulk D18 and Y6 mixture and idealized device architecture. The linear dynamic region (LDR) or photosensitivity linearity (typically quoted in dB) is estimated according to the equation of (5)where Jmax and Jmin are the maximum and minimum of the linear part of detectable light intensity at a given wavelength, respectively. The photocurrent versus the incident light intensity of the OPD is shown in Fig. 3b. In the region of linear photosensitivity for the OPD, Jmax and Jmin are the photocurrent density measured at a light intensity of 10 mW cm−2 and 4.0 × 10−6 mW cm−2, respectively. Therefore, it is calculated that the OPD possesses 120 dB LDR, which is comparable to that of inorganic photodetectors.39

(d) Transient photovoltage measurement for the OPD. 
To explore the charge carrier extraction and recombination dynamics in the device, the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) of devices are measured.40–43 As shown in Fig. 3c, the curve tends to be linear at the first stage as most of the high mobility charge carriers are generated and extracted within a relatively short time, which is then followed by a long tail that originates from the trapping and detrapping of the charge carriers.44 This device exhibits a short charge carrier extraction time of 0.58 μs, suggesting a fast charge carrier extraction. In Fig. 3d, the TPV is fitted by a mono-exponential decay with δV = VMe(−τ/T), where VM is a constant that fits to the peak, τ is the time and T is the decay time constant. Encouragingly, a long charge carrier lifetime of 133 μs from TPV is achieved. The fast charge carrier extraction process suggests that photogenerated charge carriers are effectively transferred to respective electrodes, and a long charge carrier lifetime indicates that charge carrier recombination is significantly reduced which is conducive to high current density, and therefore high device performance.
In order to verify that devices with an active layer of D18:Y6 exhibit high efficiency as OSCs and high responsivity and detectivity as OPDs simultaneously, first the exciton binding energy of Y6 is calculated. As shown in Fig. 4a, the temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the Y6 thin film show that the PL intensity decreased as the temperature increased from 85 to 325 K due to thermal quenching. It is noted that, with the increased temperature, a 70 nm blue shift is observed. Fig. 4b shows the temperature dependent integrated PL intensity curve. The exciton binding energy (Eb) can be calculated by the following equation of45,46 (6)where A is a proportional constant, I(T) and I0 are the integrated PL intensity at temperature T and 0 K, respectively, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In order to clearly understand the state and transfer process of Frenkel excitons, a simple schematic structure is depicted in Fig. 4c. Frenkel excitons (electron–hole bounded pair) are generated after absorbing-photo materials are illuminated under light, which are commonly not able to dissociate into free electrons and holes until being transferred into the interface of D:A due to the large binding energy of about few hundred meV (Table S3, ESI†). Here, it is calculated that Y6 has a low Eb of 37.6 meV, which is likely due to strong polarization effects of charge carriers.47 This exciton binding energy is one of the smallest Frenkel exciton binding energies compared with that in the reported work (Table S3, ESI†), even a bit lower than 40 meV for reported 4TIC,48,49 a commonly used NFA in organic devices.50 Such a small exciton binding energy indicates that excitons generated in Y6 could be directly dissociated into free electrons and holes by thermal excitation.

(e) TA spectra as a function of delay time for the D18:Y6 film. (f) The time resolved photoluminescence spectra of the D18:Y6 film at a probed wavelength of 780 nm. 
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is employed to further explore the ultrafast charge transfer process and recombination mechanism in D18:Y6 films.51–53Fig. 4d and Fig. S4 (ESI†) show the representative TA spectra (ΔA) of organic thin layers at selected probe delay times (the TA was performed under 360 nm excitation at 1 kHz, 100 fs, around 1 μJ cm−2 pulse−1). Once photoexcitation occurs through excitation by pump laser from the ground state to the excited state and the probe beam detects the absorption, a new component due to excited state absorption appears, as well as a reduction in the ground state absorption depleted by the pump pulse, which is called ground state bleaching. It shows three notable photoinduced photobleaching (PB) signals (negative signals at 550 nm (PB1, n = 1), 590 nm (PB2, n = 2), and 850 nm (PB3, n = 3)); these negative bands are due to the excited state absorption of D18 and Y6 in the blend film, which are also confirmed in the pristine D18 film and pristine Y6 films (Fig. S5, ESI†). The PB positions of these transitions are in good accordance with the steady-state absorption peaks (Fig. 1d). The absorption band found at ∼950 nm, which is absent in the pristine D18 or Y6 film, is due to the absorption of polarons in charge separated states.
Regarding the temporal characteristics of charge carrier transfer, we have compared the kinetic decay-associated spectrum (DAS) process at 850 nm for the blend layer (Fig. 4e), and the fitting results yielded three kinetic components of 0.86 ps, 58 ps and 1258 ps as shown in Table S4 (ESI†). It indicates that Y6 singlet exciton decay and polaron are rapidly generated with a time constant of 0.86 ps. Excitons that migrate and reach the donor–acceptor interface can be separated into electrons on the acceptor the holes on the donor, where 58 ps is the charge (exciton) transfer time54 at the D18/Y6 interfaces. The ultrafast charge transfer time of 58 ps is inherently beneficial for the enhanced electron–hole pair separation, resulting in fast charge carrier extraction time obtained by TPC for the efficient D18:Y6 device (Fig. 3c) and a fast rise time of 1.8 μs for the high performance D18:Y6 OPD (Fig. 3a). Also, exciton geminate recombination to the ground state occurs, which shows a recombination time constant of 1258 ps.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the corresponding films are obtained to further study the charge carrier dynamic processes (charge separation, transport and recombination).55 As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the D18 and Y6 films on ITO glass exhibit a pronounced PL emission peak around 702 nm and 920 nm, respectively, whereas efficient PL quenching is observed in the D18:Y6 composite film. This indicates efficient charge transfer between D18 and Y6 in the composite. This promoted charge transfer in the D18:Y6 mixture is further evidenced by the TRPL results (Fig. 4f and Fig. S6, ESI†), and the excitation wavelength is 400 nm for all thin films. The emission lifetime of neat D18 (monitored at 630 nm) and Y6 (monitored at 780 nm due to measurement equipment limitation, and 850 nm should be the optimal one) thin films is 84 ps and 271 ps, respectively. However, the remarkedly decreased emission lifetime of the blend thin films, which is 32 ps and 36 ps for emission at 630 and 780 nm, respectively, can be observed. The shortened lifetime may be due to efficient exciton dissociation or charge transfer at D18/Y6 interfaces, as a result of which fast photoresponse is achieved (∼1.8 μs).
The intrinsic molecular packing of D18, Y6 and D18:Y6 was characterized by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) (Fig. 5). GISAXS is a powerful tool to distinguish the arrangements of polymers at the nanoscale.56 In this study, the characteristic length is around 1.9 nm as the effective q value is in the range of 0.07–1 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and 0.07–0.8 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. As can be seen from Fig. 5a–c, the scattering pattern of the neat D18 film mainly includes a triangle-like scattering area near the beam-stop and a bright round scattering spot on the top. A line-cut along the IP direction reveals two peaks at q = 0.29 Å−1 and q = 0.55 Å−1, which are assigned to the diffraction peaks of (100) and (002), respectively.30 The (100) peak is associated with the lamellar stacking based on a previous report.30 In our observation, the lamellar diffraction peak has a preferred OOP orientation which has strong intensities in the OOP direction, while low intensities are distributed as a weak but observable scattering arc. The line-cut along the OOP direction suggests that the bright scattering spot is centered at qz = 0.34 Å−1, corresponding to a characteristic distance of ∼1.85 nm. Such a distance is also consistent with the spacing between stacked D18 lamellae by previous molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.30 The neat Y6 film displays a needle-like scattering pattern in the center. The wider scattering shape around the beam-stop indicates that there are large aggregates in the film, which could be verified by the intensity increasing dramatically with the decrease of q in the OOP direction (Fig. 5d and e). Besides, the line-cut analysis also suggests that there is no lamellar peak (100) appearing along the OOP direction, while it was clearly observed in the IP direction. Such a feature suggests that the Y6 film still has a preferred orientation along the IP direction on lamellar stacking, although the overall stacking structure is weak. Besides the lamellar peak at q = 0.29 Å−1, another peak at q = 0.41 Å−1 is also observed, which originates from the (001) diffraction, implying the backbone ordering of Y6 that facilities the intermolecular electron transport.57 Interestingly, after mixing Y6 with D18, the intrinsic OOP orientation of D18 totally disappeared. At the same time, the scattering intensity of (100) was concentrated in the range of qz = 0–0.2 Å−1. And also, the aggregation in the D18:Y6 film is obviously less than that in the pure Y6 film. The line-cut profile along the IP presents clear diffraction peaks from both D18 and Y6, which reveals that blending does not impact their own packing feature along the IP direction. The preferred orientation could be measured by the scattering intensity as a function of polar angle (χ) with respect to the q-vector of the (100) planes.58 Fig. S7 (ESI†) compares the χ scattering profiles of D18, Y6 and D18:Y6. It shows that the scattering intensity is higher at smaller χ for D18, while inverse for D18:Y6. A previous study attributed the excess scattering intensity at smaller χ to oriented edge-on, and excess scattering intensity at larger χ as due to oriented face-on. Therefore, D18 has an edge-on orientation and Y6 has a face-on orientation (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Conclusion
In summary, we fabricate a fast response, high responsivity and detectivity organic photodetector with a D18:Y6 active layer herein. A small Frenkel exciton binding energy of 37.6 meV in Y6 ensured that excitons can be efficiently dissociated, which promotes a high photocurrent density for the device. The matched energy level alignment in thin films accelerates charge carrier transport and extraction for high device performance along with suppressed charge carrier recombination. TPC and TPV measurements show a very short charge carrier extraction time of 0.58 μs and a relatively long charge carrier lifetime of 133 μs, respectively. The TAS and TRPL results further confirm that efficient exciton dissociation or ultrafast charge transfer occurs at D18/Y6 interfaces. The GISAXS results show that the preferred orientation along the OOP or IP direction on lamellar stacking in organic films helps in the intermolecular electron transport from backbone ordering of Y6. As a result, the fabricated organic photodetector achieves a responsivity of 680 mA W−1 and a detectivity of 6.35 × 1013 Jones under zero bias at a wavelength of 850 nm, respectively, operated at room temperature. In addition, it is the first time that this type of device exhibits a high detectivity and responsivity simultaneously to the best of our knowledge.
Experimental section
Materials
D18 and Y6 were purchased from One Material. Chloroform (CF, 99.8%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ethanol was purchased from Alfa Aesar. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. Phen-NaDPO was purchased from Puri Material Technology Co. Ltd. All materials and reagents were used as received without further purification.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Ultrasound cleaning of ITO-coated glass substrates was carried out with ethanol, acetone solution, and deionized water for 20 minutes, respectively, and then the substrates were dried in a dry oven overnight. After that, the BHJ device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D18:Y6/Phen-NaDPO/Ag is fabricated. First, an ∼40 nm PEDOT:PSS layer is spin-coated onto pre-cleaned and UV-ozone treated ITO-coated glass substrates at 4000 revolution per minute (RPM) for 30 seconds (s), followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 minutes (min) on a hotplate. Then the substrates are transferred into an N2-glovebox, and an ∼90 nm D18:Y6 active layer is spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer from D18:Y6 (1:1.6 by weight) chloroform solution, followed by solvent annealing for 50 μL CF in a covered Petri dish for 5 min. After that, a 5 nm Phen-NaDPO layer is spin-coated on top of the D18:Y6 layer from Phen-NADPO solution (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol), Finally, ∼100 nm of Ag is sequentially thermally evaporated using a shadow mask under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The effective device area is measured to be 0.06 cm2.
Characterization of organic thin films
UV-Vis-NIR absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of thin films were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer and an FLS920 spectro fluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL-7401). Thicknesses of thin films were measured using a Dektak 150 surface profilometer. The AFM-based measurement was performed on an Asylum Research Cypher AFM with/without the built-in LED shedding light on the sample from the top. The broadband fs-TA measurements were carried out on a Heliospump-probe system (Ultrafast Systems LLC) coupled with an amplified femtosecond laser system (Coherent, 35 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm). The probe pulses (from 380 to 800 nm) were generated by focusing a small portion (around 10 μJ) of the fundamental 800 nm laser pulses onto a 1 mm CaF2 layer. The 365 nm pump pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-800-fs). TA curves as a function of delay time were fitted to a biexponential decay function of y = y0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2 + A3e−t/τ3. GISAXS patterns were measured using 18 keV X-rays at beamline 12-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. An area detector, MarCCD 165, was used to detect the scattered photons. The samples were thin polymer films coated on ITO glasses. The incidence angle is 0.09° and the sample to detector distance is ∼2 m.
Characterization of photovoltaic devices
The cells were connected to a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO-3054) and the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 100 MΩ and 50 Ω, respectively, for monitoring the charge density decay. The transient photovoltage was measured under 0.3 sun background illumination. An attenuated laser pulse (500 nm) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation was smaller than 5% of the VOC produced by the background illumination. The transient photocurrent was measured by applying 500 nm laser pulses with a pulse width of 120 fs and a low pulse energy to short circuit devices in the dark. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace). All I–V and current–time curve measurements were carried out with a home-built system at room temperature which consisted of the optical and electrical parts. The optical part includes SC-PRO and AOTF-PRO produced by OYSL and can produce 430–2000 nm light which provides the illumination needed by photodetectors. The electrical part consists of a probe and a Keithley 2600B and can detect the photodetectors’ current. The fast current–time curves were measured using a semiconductor analyzing system and digital oscilloscope at room temperature (Keithley 4200A-SCS, USA, LakeShore, USA, Tektronix DPO-3054). Measurement of noise current and calculation of NEP and D*: the photoconductive device was placed inside an electrically shielded and optically sealed probe station and connected in series with a Stanford Research SR830 lock-in amplifier. Batteries were used to bias the device for the measurement of the noise current to minimize noise components from the bias source. Through the choice of integration time, the lock-in amplifier reported a noise current in A/Hz1/2. The noise current divided by the responsivity under the same experimental conditions (applied bias and electronic bandwidth) yielded the noise equivalent power (NEP). To validate the NEP obtained using this technique, an identical procedure was carried out using a commercial Si detector with known NEP.
