    , Accepted 24th January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractBalancing photovoltaic parameters is very challenging to optimize the device performance of nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor (SMA)-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). We herein employed electron-withdrawing fluorinated or chlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (ICF or ICCl) as the terminal acceptor (A) group to develop two acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) SMAs, DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, with an electron-rich fluorene-fused dithienocyclopentafluorene as the identical central donor (D) core. Compared with the nonhalogenated counterpart (DTCFO-IC), the two halogenated SMAs possessed a red-shifted absorption spectrum, reduced optical bandgap, and increased charge carrier mobility, but these were accompanied by down-shifted HOMO and LUMO levels, especially for the chlorinated molecule (DTCFO-ICCl). Accordingly, with respect to DTCFO-IC, PSCs based on the two halogenated SMAs with polymer PBDB-T as a donor exhibited an improved Jsc, but a dropped Voc, thus leading to a commensurate power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.80% for DTCFO-ICF and an increased PCE of 8.55% for DTCFO-ICCl. To further improve the device performance by means of balancing photovoltaic parameters, polymer PBDB-TF with a lower-lying HOMO level relative to PBDB-T was used to replace PBDB-T as the donor. The PCEs of PBDB-TF-based PSCs were further improved mainly due to the significantly enhanced Voc. Importantly, the DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs achieved a high PCE of up to 11.03% along with an increased Voc (0.93 V), a further increased Jsc (18.80 mA cm−2), and almost retained FF (63.1%). The enhanced device performance could be attributed to better charge transport and collection abilities, less charge recombination and more optimal active layer morphology. These results argue that combining the halogenation on the A group of an A–D–A acceptor and variation of the paired polymer donor could be an effective strategy to enhance the device efficiency by balancing photovoltaic parameters.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) steadily and rapidly increased from 10%1–3 up to over 18%4–7 because fullerene-based acceptors were replaced by many new nonfullerene small-molecular acceptors (SMAs). Compared with classical fullerene-based acceptors (e.g. PC71BM), nonfullerene SMAs possess some intrinsic merits, such as strong absorption properties, good energy level tunability, and various and facile structural modification.8–13 High efficiency SMAs typically have an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type structural skeleton, in which an electron-rich polycyclic arene acts as the central donor (D) unit and an electron-deficient unit is employed as the terminal acceptor (A) group.8–13 Notably, a new class of high efficiency SMAs, so-called Y-series acceptors, were firstly developed by Zou and co-workers,9,14,15 which feature an A–DA′D–A type molecular structure. In this kind of SMA, an electron-deficient unit denoted as A′ (e.g. benzothiadiazole) fuses with electron-rich S, N-heteroacenes to form the particular DA′D-type central core.14–20 For most reported A–D–A SMAs, pentacyclic indacenodithiophene,21,22 heptacyclic indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT),23,24 and nonacyclic indacenobis(dithienopyrrol)25,26 are commonly used as D units and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) and its derivatives take on the A group.10,13,22,23 For example, the representative SMA ITIC just came from the heptacyclic IDTT moiety.23 Apart from ITIC, there are some other efficient A–D–A SMAs based on a heptacyclic central D unit through fusing a tricyclic building block, like fluorene, carbazole, and benzodithiophene with cyclopentadienylthiophene, to construct the corresponding dithienocyclopentafluorene (DTCF),27–33 dithienocyclopentacarbazole,27,34–36 and benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene),37–39 respectively.
In this respect, SMAs based on the fluorene-containing heptacyclic arene had received more attention due to the facile structural modification on the fluorene unit and high device performance. In 2017, Gao et al. reported alkylphenyl substituted DTCF-based SMA DTF-IC, which showed the best PCE of 6.92% with a low band gap polymer PTB7-Th as the donor.27 Very recently, a rather similar SMA FXIC-1 reported by Zhan et al. presented a slightly high PCE of 7.13% with the same polymer donor (PTB7-Th) mainly because of the obviously improved fill factor (FF).28 The differences between the two SMAs lie in the alkyl side chain attached on the fluorene segment (octyl versus hexyl) and the A group. With respect to arylalkyl substituted DTCF-based SMAs, our group had reported the alkoxylphenyl substituted analog DTCFO-IC, which exhibited a PCE of 6.92% using a medium band gap polymer PBDB-T as the donor with a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of up to 1.00 V relative to DTF-IC- and FXIC-1-based devices due to the difference in the polymer donor (PTB7-Th versus PBDB-T).29 Moreover, an efficient thick active layer and large area ternary PSC could be obtained when this fluorene-based heptacyclic SMA was used as the additional acceptor to add into the host binary PBDB-T:PC71BM system. At the same time, the Chen group reported fully alkylated DTCF-based SMA FDICTF with PBDB-T as the donor enabling a higher PCE of up to 10.06%.30 The enhanced PCE could be attributed to the increase of both short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF because the fully alkylated derivative (FDICTF) has a red-shifted absorption and higher charge carrier mobility relative to its counterparts with phenyl side chains (DTF-IC, FXIC-1, and DTCFO-IC). To further broaden the absorption spectrum of DTCF-based SMAs, a new oxygen heterocycle-fused A–D–A SMA based on fluorene, denoted as FCO-2F, was synthesized by inserting an oxygen atom into the backbone of DTCF and fluorinating on the A group.31 This new SMA showed a broader absorption up to 830 nm and a high PCE of over 13% using PM6 as the donor with a greatly increased Jsc. For a clear comparison, the chemical structures of the above-mentioned fluorene-based heptacyclic SMAs are displayed in Chart 1 and the corresponding PSC device performances are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† These results demonstrated that the type and side chain of the D unit have a great impact on the molecular structure, physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of the related A–D–A SMAs.
 Chart 1  Chemical structures of fluorene-based heptacyclic SMAs with various side chains and terminal A groups and their best-reported PCEs with the specified polymer donor. 
Besides the D unit, the molecular structure and optoelectronic properties of A–D–A SMAs are also affected by the type and substituent of the terminal A group. Similarly, we take the DTCF-based SMA FDICTF (Chart 1) as an example. When the A group of IC in FDICTF was replaced by a naphthyl-fused indanone as the A group, a new DTCF-based SMA FDNCTF (see Chart 1) was obtained.32 FDNCTF with the extended π-conjugation at the A group showed an improved light absorption and charge carrier mobility, which resulted in simultaneously increased Jsc and FF, thus delivering a higher PCE of 11.2% than that of FDICTF with the phenyl-fused IC as the A group. Another simple and useful means to modify the A group is introduction of various substituents, such as electron-donating alkyl or alkoxyl groups (Me40 and MeO41) and electron-withdrawing halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br atoms).33,42–55 The different π electron characteristics of these substituents have a great impact on the molecular stacking and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect between the D unit and the A group, and further on the device photovoltaic performance. For instance, the difluoride-substituted IC group (5,6-difluoro-3-(dicyanomethylene)indol-1-one, ICF) can effectively enhance the molecular π–π stacking and crystallinity of the related A–D–A SMAs due to the improved noncovalent intermolecular interactions in fluorinated molecules, which is beneficial to increase electron mobility.50–54 Moreover, the fluorinated SMAs show red-shifted absorption spectra and down-shifted HOMO/LUMO levels because of the intensive ICT effect between D and A groups (ICF). In comparison with the fluorinated IC group (ICF), the dichloride-substituted counterpart 5,6-dichloro-3-(dicyanomethylidene)indol-1-one (ICCl) commonly leads to stronger crystallization tendency, a broader absorption range and lower-lying HOMO/LUMO levels, hence contributing an improved Jsc, FF, and overall efficiency.42–49 Likewise, when one H atom of the benzene ring of the IC unit in FDICTF was substituted by an F or Cl or Br atom, a series of new halogenated FDICTF analogues (F–F, F–Cl, and F–Br, see Chart 1)33 had been synthesized and these halogenated SMAs showed superior device performance to FDICTF-based PSCs with the same polymer donor (PBDB-T) mainly due to the concurrently improved Jsc and FF, as shown in Table S1 in the ESI.† This result suggests that the halogenation strategy on the terminal A group is very effective in improving Jsc and FF, thus realizing high-performance solar cells.
In view of the fact that a BHJ PSC is composed of a polymer electron donor and a fullerene- or nonfullerene-based electron acceptor, the solar cell performance must be determined by both the polymer donor and acceptor. Actually, in the early phase of PSCs with a fullerene-based acceptor (e.g. PC71BM), conjugated polymer donors had dominated the device performance due to their tunable molecular structure and optoelectronic properties. At this stage, although the research emphasis of PSCs has been shifted on nonfullerene SMAs, it is still important to select a suitable polymer donor to pair well with one specified SMA for achieving a highly efficient solar cell device because the complementarity of the absorption spectrum and suitability of HOMO/LUMO levels between the polymer donor and SMA directly determine the device performance. As mentioned above, DTCF-based SMA DTF-IC and FXIC-1 exhibited different photovoltaic properties, like Voc, Jsc and FF, from DTCFO-IC, and even have a similar molecular structure. This is mainly ascribed to the utilization of different polymer donors (see Table S1, ESI†) with various absorption properties and HOMO/LUMO levels. Thus it is can be seen that the variation of the polymer donor is also a very useful approach to enhance the PSC device performance.
As mentioned above, we recently developed an A–D–A type fluorene-fused heptacyclic SMA DTCFO-IC (Chart 1) and a PCE of 6.92% was gained with a rather high Voc (1.00 V) but a mediocre Jsc (11.93 mA cm−2) and FF (57.9%) for the corresponding PSCs. In view of the high Voc, we considered that there must be much room for the enhancement of device performance if one can improve the Jsc and FF while keeping a high Voc. On the basis of the discussions above, it is well demonstrated that the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as F and Cl atoms, on the terminal A group (e.g. IC) can achieve simultaneous improvement of Jsc and FF. However, the halogenation on the A group inevitably down-shifts the HOMO and LUMO levels of the resultant SMAs. The reduced LUMO level would reduce Voc because the difference between the donor HOMO level and acceptor LUMO level directly affects the Voc in a BHJ solar cell device. To minimize the negative effect of the halogenation on Voc but benefit from this modification in terms of Jsc and FF, we considered that varying the polymer donor might be able to control the trade-off of Jsc/FF and Voc and accomplish the goal of increasing the Jsc and FF while retaining a high Voc, thus enabling an improved device performance. With these considerations in our mind, we herein designed and synthesized two new A–D–A-type fluorene-fused heptacyclic SMAs, DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, by replacing the terminal IC group of DTCFO-IC with its halogenated derivatives of ICF and ICCl, respectively. The chemical structures of the two DTCF-based SMAs are shown in Fig. 1. The two halogenated SMAs exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum, reduced optical band gap, and increased charge carrier mobility, especially for the chlorinated small molecule (DTCFO-ICCl) as compared with the nonhalogenated counterpart (DTCFO-IC). Meanwhile, as designed, both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two halogenated SMAs were slightly down-shifted relative to those of the nonhalogenated DTCFO-IC. Consequently, compared with DTCFO-IC, BHJ PSCs based on DTCFO-ICF with the same polymer donor PBDB-T presented an improved Jsc (15.52 mA cm−2) together with a similar FF (54.1%) but a greatly dropped Voc of 0.81 V, thus leading to a commensurate PCE of 6.80%. In contrast, PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs exhibited a higher PCE of up to 8.55% due to the simultaneously increased Jsc (16.69 mA cm−2) and FF (66.5%) and even a sharply reduced Voc (0.77 V). To further improve the device performance of these halogenated SMAs, we next employed polymer PBDB-TF, also known as PM6, to replace PBDB-T as the donor because PBDB-TF has a lower-lying HOMO level than PBDB-T and meanwhile it has similar absorption properties and molecular structure (see Fig. 1), which would be beneficial for obtaining a higher Voc while maintaining high Jsc and FF. As we anticipated, the overall efficiency of both the SMAs with PBDB-TF as the donor outperformed that of PBDB-T mainly because of the more balanced photovoltaic parameters. More importantly, the PCE of DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs was further improved up to 11.03% on account of a significantly increased Voc of 0.93 V, a further raised Jsc of 18.80 mA cm−2, and an almost maintained FF of 63.1%, relative to the corresponding PSCs with PBDB-T as the donor. Our finding highlights that combining the halogenation on the A group of an A–D–A type acceptor and variation of the paired polymer donor could be an effective strategy to achieve a superior device efficiency by balancing photovoltaic parameters.

After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (100 mL) to obtain a precipitate as the crude product, which was separated via silica gel column chromatography with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:1 by volume) as an eluent to afford DTCFO-ICF as a dark solid (501 mg, 56.7%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 8.88 (s, 2H), 8.56–8.52 (m, 2H), 7.71–7.68 (m, 2H), 7.69 (s, 2H), 7.68 (s, 2H), 7.58 (s, 2H), 7.13 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 6.80 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 3.89 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 2.06 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 1.86–1.66 (m, 8H), 1.36–1.23 (m, 12H), 1.16–1.12 (m, 28H), 0.88 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 12H), 0.79 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 6H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): −122.73 (d), −123.84 (d). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 186.03, 161.16, 158.42, 156.14, 155.84, 155.69, 153.22, 153.09, 152.95, 142.71, 140.64, 140.00, 138.72, 136.59, 136.51, 135.58, 135.18, 134.59, 128.94, 120.84, 118.31, 116.71, 115.13, 114.91, 114.54, 114.36, 114.27, 112.73, 112.54, 69.33, 68.00, 62.19, 54.74, 40.35, 31.78, 31.57, 30.02, 29.26, 29.23, 29.21, 25.74, 24.13, 22.62, 22.60, 14.09, 14.03.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of SMAs
The chemical structures of the two halogenated A groups ICF and ICCl and the synthetic route to the corresponding SMAs of DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl are displayed in Scheme 1. The key intermediate of DTCF-based dialdehyde DTCFO-CHO was synthesized according to the reported method.29 The target SMAs of DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl were subsequently gained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between DTCFO-CHO and the A groups of ICF and ICCl, respectively, in mediocre yields. The molecular structures of the target molecules were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR, and MALDI-TOF-MS. Compared with DTCFO-ICF, the chlorinated DTCFO-ICCl shows a relatively better solubility in common organic solvents, including CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and chlorobenzene (CB), at room temperature. Here, it should be noted that both DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl bear four 4-hexyloxyphenyl side chains on the heptacyclic DTCF core, which is different from some previously reported DTCF-containing analogues with alkylphenyl or fully alkylated side chains on the DTCF core (see Chart 1). There are two main purposes to utilize alkoxylphenyl as side chains: one is that the bulk alkoxylphenyl group is a relatively good solubilizing group with respect to alkyl side chains, which is very important for halogenated materials due to common reduction in solubility resulting from halogenation;42–55 the other is that the insertion of an oxygen atom can be useful to broaden the absorption window, reduce the band gap and down-shift energy levels56 relative to the alkylphenyl substituted analogs.27,28 The study on the thermal stability of DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl revealed that both SMAs exhibit good thermal stabilities with a weight loss of 5% at 347 and 352 °C (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), which is enough for solar cell device preparation, and they are even slightly lower than those of the nonhalogenated counterpart DTCFO-IC, as listed in Table 1. At the same time, the thermal phase transition behaviors of both the DTCF-based SMAs and the polymer donors were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As displayed in Fig. S2a and b in the ESI,†DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl exhibit an obvious endothermic peak (Tm) at about 277 and 183 °C in the second heating cycle, respectively. Interestingly, DTCFO-ICCl shows a remarkable crystallization thermal transition in the first cooling cycle with an exothermic peak at about 129 °C (Tc); whereas, the visible crystallization thermal transition in the first cooling cycle cannot be found for DTCFO-ICF. This observation indicates that DTCFO-ICCl should have a better crystallinity than DTCFO-ICF. As for the two polymer donors, both of them display no obvious thermal transitions up to 300 °C (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†), which is consistent with the previous result.57

3.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The photophysical properties of the two molecules were investigated by measuring UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra both in chloroform (CF) solution and as solid thin films, and the related results are listed in Table 1. Notably, for a clear comparison, some results based on the nonhalogenated parent molecule DTCFO-IC were also presented along with the two halogenated SMAs. As shown in Fig. 2a, in dilute CF solution, DTCFO-ICF provides a strong absorption band located in the 500–750 nm region with a red-shifted maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 665 nm, corresponding to a higher molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 2.16 × 105 M−1 cm−1 relative to the parent DTCFO-IC (Table 1). DTCFO-ICF in a thin film exhibits a similar absorption profile to its solution state but with a broadened absorption range associated with a distinctly red-shifted λmax up to 698 nm, owing to molecule aggregation in the solid state, as described in Fig. 2b and Table 1. The absorption edge of 750 nm was observed and the corresponding optical band gap (Eoptg) is determined to be 1.65 eV for DTCFO-ICF. With respect to the reported FXIC-1 with alkylphenyl side chains28 (see Chart 1), DTCFO-ICF in CF solution displays a higher ε (2.0 × 105 → 2.16 × 105 M−1 cm−1), a red-shifted λmax (684 → 698 nm) and a slightly reduced Eoptg (1.67 → 1.65 eV), indicating that the introduction of an oxygen atom is conducive to improve the absorption properties of the related SMAs. Compared with the fluorinated DTCFO-ICF, chlorination leads to a more red-shifted absorption spectrum, with a λmax in the solution and thin film of DTCFO-ICCl at 679 and 724 nm, respectively. Furthermore, one can find that DTCFO-ICCl depicts the highest ε (2.47 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and the lowest Eoptg (1.58 eV) among the three DTCF-based SMAs as listed in Table 1. This could be ascribed to the strongest intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of the chlorinated small molecule.42–49 In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 2b, the absorption spectrum of DTCFO-ICCl is complementary to the selected polymer donors as compared with DTCFO-ICF, indicating that a higher Jsc would be gained for DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs. These results argue that the introduction of halogen atoms into the A group of A–D–A type SMAs is favorable to improve spectral absorption abilities, red-shift absorption spectra and reduce band gaps; in particular, the chlorination is more remarkable than the fluorination. The improved absorption characteristics of these halogenated acceptors could be conducive to achieve higher Jsc of the related solar cell devices.

We used cyclic voltammetry (CV) to study the electrochemical properties of these DTCF-based SMAs. The detailed measurement procedure is described in the ESI.† From Fig. S3 (ESI†), the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox/red) are observed as 1.46/−0.18 V for DTCFO-ICF and 1.50/−0.10 V for DTCFO-ICCl. The HOMO/LUMO levels of DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, therefore, have been deduced to be −5.67/−4.03 and −5.71/−4.11 eV, respectively, on the basis of the following empirical equation: HOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + EFc/Fc+ − 4.8) (eV), where EFc/Fc+ refers to the redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple and was determined to be 0.59 V in this system. The electrochemical band gap (ECVg) obtained from HOMO and LUMO levels is 1.64 and 1.60 eV for DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, respectively, which is consistent with the corresponding optical band gap (Eoptg), as listed in Table 1. Obviously, the two halogenated SMAs exhibit the slightly lower-lying HOMO/LUMO levels compared to the parent DTCFO-IC, which can be attributed to the electron-withdrawing character of halogen atoms (F and Cl). Moreover, more down-shifted energy levels of the chlorinated DTCFO-ICCl were found, which are similar to the previously reported observations.44,45,48 As displayed in Fig. 2c, an energy level diagram was drawn to gain more clear understanding of the HOMO and LUMO energy offsets between these DTCF-based SMAs and two polymer donors (PBDB-T and PBDB-TF, see Fig. 1) used in this study. Obviously, there are enough big energy offsets both for HOMO and LUMO levels between all these DTCF-based SMAs and polymer donors, which is beneficial for both efficient hole and electron transfer between donors and acceptors.
3.3 Photovoltaic performance
To study the impact of halogenation on the photovoltaic performance of the two DTCF-based SMAs, inverted solar cell devices with an ITO/ZnO/polymer donor:SMA/MoO3/Al structure were prepared. The well-known polymer PBDB-T or PBDB-TF (see Fig. 1) was employed as the donor in view of their mutually complementary absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) and well-matched energy levels (Fig. 2c) with the two DTCF-based SMAs. We adopted CHCl3 (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvents for DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, respectively, on account of the different solubility of the two materials. Photovoltaic performance optimization was performed by means of changing the donor/acceptor blend ratio, film thickness, and thermal treatment (TA) temperature, and the correlative device performance results are included in Tables S2 and S3 in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic plots of the optimized PSCs based on DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl are displayed in Fig. 3a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compared in Table 2. Using polymer PBDB-T as the donor, DTCFO-ICF-based PSCs exhibit a slightly dropped PCE of 6.80% largely because of the concurrently decreased Voc (0.81 V) and FF (54.1%) even with an increased Jsc of 15.52 mA cm−2 compared to the parent DTCFO-IC-based devices (Voc = 1.0 V, Jsc = 11.92 mA cm−2, FF = 57.9%, and PCE = 6.92%).29 In contrast, the DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs exhibit an enhanced PCE of 8.55% due to a much increased Jsc of 16.69 mA cm−2 and a larger FF of 66.5%, albeit with an evidently dropped Voc of 0.77 V. The increased Jsc and FF would benefit from the improved light-harvesting ability and absorption spectra as well as better charge carrier mobility after the introduction of halogen atoms. On the other hand, the dramatically reduced Voc could be readily interpreted by the down-shifted LUMO levels of the two halogenated SMAs relative to the control SMA DTCFO-IC. From the above results, we could find that halogenation on the A group of an A–D–A type SMA is indeed a very successful strategy to improve the Jsc and FF synchronously, thus resulting in the enhancement of PSC performance. However, it should be noted that there is also a negative influence on the Voc, which is not what we wanted. To fully share benefits and reduce the detrimental effect of the introduction of halogen atoms on the acceptor molecules, we then tried to vary the polymer donor to balance photovoltaic parameters between Voc and Jsc/FF for further enhancing the device performance. As a fluorinated analogue of PBDB-T, polymer PBDB-TF (see Fig. 1) was thus deliberately selected to pair the two DTCF-based SMAs in view of its lower-lying HOMO level (Fig. 2c) and similar absorption properties (Fig. 2b) relative to PBDB-T, which is favorable for obtaining a higher Voc while keeping high Jsc and FF. As anticipated, PBDB-TF:DTCFO-ICF-based PSCs provide a clearly increased Voc of 0.99 V, but both Jsc (15.44 mA cm−2) and FF (50.2%) are slightly decreased, which results in a slightly improved PCE of 7.67% as compared with the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICF-based solar cells. In terms of the chlorinated DTCFO-ICCl, an evidently enhanced PCE of up to 11.03% is realized with PBDB-TF as the donor, thanking to a higher Voc of 0.93 V and a further increased Jsc of 18.80 mA cm−2 along with an almost retained FF (63.1%). Here, it should be noted that this outstanding device performance was obtained with a relatively thin active layer thickness (∼60 nm). We found that the device efficiency based on PBDB-TF:DTCFO-ICCl decreases gradually with the increase of the thickness of the active layer, as displayed in Table S3 in the ESI.† Obviously, the superior device performance of PBDB-TF-based PSCs relative to that of PBDB-T-based ones primarily was attributed to the enhanced Voc while almost retaining large Jsc and FF. On the other hand, the worse performance of the DTCFO-ICF-based devices should be mainly related to carrier mobility, charge transport and combination, and active layer morphology. These results highlight that combining the variation of the terminal A group of an A–D–A acceptor and the paired polymer donor could be a useful strategy to enhance device efficiency by balancing photovoltaic parameters.

As presented in Fig. 3b, external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the optimized PSCs based on the two DTCF-based SMAs paired with different polymer donors were measured to verify the Jsc values for the corresponding PSC devices. The spectral response range of EQE agrees well with the absorption spectra of the solid films as given in Fig. 2b. The EQE values in the short wavelength region (300–500 nm) are obviously lower than those in the longer wavelength range, indicating that DTCF-based SMAs play a dominant role in producing the photocurrent. DTCFO-ICCl-based devices provided a relative wide spectral response range and high EQE values in comparison with DTCFO-ICF-based devices, in good accordance with their corresponding higher Jsc values (Table 2). Additionally, the calculated Jsc values from EQE spectra as listed in Table 2 are generally consistent with those observed from J–V plots (Fig. 3a).
We measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure polymer films and donor:acceptor blend films to investigate the charge transfer process between the donor and acceptor. The blend films were prepared under the corresponding optimization conditions and all the PL spectra were obtained with an excitation wavelength of 590 nm. From Fig. S4a in the ESI,† both polymer donors PBDB-T and PBDB-TF exhibit a strong PL spectrum with a maximum emission peak at around 680 nm. However, when the polymer donor blends with the DTCF-based SMAs, the maximum PL emission intensity for the four blend films is apparently quenched over 90% relative to the pure polymer films, which suggests that an efficient charge transfer can occur in all the four donor:acceptor blend films. Specifically, for the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICF and PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICCl blend films, the intensity of the PL emission is quenched about 90% and 92%, respectively, as compared to the neat PBDB-T film. In contrast, the PL emission intensity of PBDB-TF is more completely quenched when blending with DTCFO-ICF (95%) and DTCFO-ICCl (97%). These results mean that there is more efficient electron transfer from the polymer donor PBDB-TF to the SMAs (DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl) with respect to PBDB-T. Moreover, the charge transfer can more effectively occur between the polymer donor (PBDB-T and PBDB-TF) and the chlorinated DTCFO-ICCl as compared with the fluorinated DTCFO-ICF. This should be one reasonable cause behind the relatively high Jsc of the PBDB-TF- and DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs (Table 2). In addition, one can find that the four blend films give a visible PL emission in the range of 700–800 nm corresponding to a maximum peak at about 750 nm, which could be attributed to the PL emission of the DTCF-based SMAs as corroborated by Fig. S4b (ESI†).
To seek the other possible reasons that cause the difference in Jsc and FF of the four PSCs, we measured the charge carrier transport properties of the blend films using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The test and calculation details of the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in these blend films are described in the ESI.† The corresponding J–V plots for SCLC measurements are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the deduced μh and μe values are summarized in Table 3. From these data, one can find that both μh and μe values of the DTCFO-ICCl-based blend films are significantly higher than those of the DTCFO-ICF-based counterparts, which is conducive to produce a larger Jsc. Moreover, the proportion of μh to μe (μh/μe) is 0.84 and 1.01 for the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICCl- and PBDB-TF:DTCFO-ICCl-based blend films, respectively, both of which are closer to 1 compared with the corresponding DTCFO-ICF-based blend films (μh/μe = 1.86 and 0.80). This means that DTCFO-ICCl-based devices possess more balanced carrier transport properties with respect to DTCFO-ICF-based ones, suggesting that less charge accumulation and recombination would occur in these devices as further verified in the next section, thus resulting in relatively higher FF values.

3.4 Charge collection, separation and recombination
To better understand the difference in Jsc and FF of the four PSCs, we studied the exciton dissociation and charge collection probability (P(E,T)) of the four PSCs by inspecting correspondence of the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff).58 As presented in Fig. 4a, the Jph increases gradually with the rise of Veff. However, all the Jph values could not arrive at saturation (Jsat) even when Veff approaches 3 V, which indicates relatively serious charge recombination in these PSCs. This would be detrimental to Jsc and FF of the related PSCs. The P(E,T) values of these PSCs are assessed by calculating the Jph/Jsat value. The DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs exhibit higher P(E,T) values (0.76 and 0.85) than the DTCFO-ICF-based counterparts (0.70 and 0.73) regardless of polymer donors, implying larger exciton dissociation and charge collection abilities. This could be partly responsible for the relatively larger Jsc and FF values of the DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs.
 Fig. 4  (a) Jphversus Veff and (b) light-intensity (P) dependence of Jsc of the four PSCs. 
To further investigate the charge recombination properties of the four PSCs, we next tested the dependence between the Jsc and the light intensity (Plight). The dependent relationship of the Jsc on Plight can be defined as: Jsc ∝ Pαlight, in which the α value represents the charge recombination degree.59,60 The bimolecular recombination in the PSCs can be ignored when the α value is close to 1 and the higher the values of the α (α ≤ 1), the less the occurrence of bimolecular recombination. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICCl- and PBDB-TF:DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs provide an α value of 0.92 and 0.96, respectively, both of which are obviously higher than those of the DTCFO-ICF-based ones (0.84 and 0.87). This implies that less bimolecular recombination exists in the DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs and it could be one of the reasons that caused the larger Jsc and FF in the DTCFO-ICCl-based solar cells. Moreover, two DTCFO-ICF-based PSCs present a small α value of 0.84 and 0.87, which are far away from 1, suggesting that a serious charge recombination occurs in these devices, which is consistent with the results observed from Fig. 4a. Moreover, one can find that the differences of the α values between the two PSCs with the same SMA are evidently smaller than those of PSCs with the same polymer donor. For example, the difference of the α values between two DTCFO-ICF-based PSCs is just 0.03, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is suppressed with a similar degree in both the PSCs. In contrast, there is a relatively large difference (0.09) of the α values between two PBDB-TF-based PSCs. This result can explain the unobvious variation in the Jsc and FF values for the PSCs with the same SMAs, but a more clear distinction in the Jsc and FF values for PSCs with the same polymer donors (see Table 2).
3.5 Blend film morphology and contact angles
As provided in Fig. 5, atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images were captured to investigate the blend film morphologies of the active layers based on the four PSCs, which can also help us to find some reasons that caused the divergence in Jsc and FF of these devices. All the blend films were prepared with the same conditions as those of the optimized PSCs. From the AFM height image (Fig. 5a), the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICF-based blend film is found to exhibit a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value of 3.17 nm, which is similar to that of PBDB-TF:DTCFO-ICF (RMS = 3.07 nm, Fig. 5c). The large RMS value indicates that both DTCFO-ICF-based blend films have coarse surface morphologies, suggesting a relatively serious phase separation as evidenced by the corresponding AFM phases (Fig. 5e and g). In contrast, as depicted in Fig. 5b and d, DTCFO-ICCl-based blend films presented relatively even and smooth surface morphologies with reduced RMS values of 2.82 and 1.38 nm. In the AFM phase images (Fig. 5f and h), the blend films based on DTCFO-ICCl display more visible fibrillar and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks as compared with DTCFO-ICF-based blend films. This is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, and therefore leads to high FF values in DTCFO-ICCl-based PSCs.

To further investigate the influence of halogenation of both polymer donors and SMAs on the blend film morphology, contact angles of water (θwater) and ethylene glycol (EG, θEG) on the pure polymer donor and SMA films were measured.61–64 The contact angle images of two polymer donors (PBDB-T and PBDB-TF) and two SMAs (DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl) are displayed in Fig. 6. The various polymer donor films exhibit a similar θwater of about 99°, and the two SMA films show a smaller but also almost equal θwater of 88°. However, there is relatively big difference between the θEG values of both polymer donors and SMAs. According to the data of contact angle, the surface energy (γ) can be obtained using the Owens model65 and the relevant data are listed in Table 4. The calculated γ values of pure PBDB-T, PBDB-TF, DTCFO-ICF, and DTCFO-ICCl films are 22.32, 34.87, 60.83, and 51.14 mN m−1, respectively. In view of the fact that the γ values of both polymer donors are smaller than those of the two SMAs, the donor and acceptor materials would be efficiently segregated toward the top air surface and the bottom of the active layer, respectively.66 Next, the miscibility and interaction of the two components in the donor:SMA blend are evaluated by calculating Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χdonor–acceptor based on the following empirical equation χdonor–acceptor = k[(γdonor)1/2 − (γacceptor)1/2]2, where k is a positive constant, and γdonor and γacceptor are the surface energies of the corresponding donor and SMA films, respectively.61,63 When the polymer donor PBDB-T or PBDB-TF is blended with the SMAs, the DTCFO-ICCl-based blends show an obviously smaller χdonor–acceptor value (5.89 and 1.55k) than the DTCFO-ICF-based ones (9.46 and 3.46k), suggesting that DTCFO-ICCl has much better miscibility with the polymer donors compared to DTCFO-ICF. This agrees with the observations of the relatively low RMS values and appropriate phase separation from morphology characterization (Fig. 5b and d). On the other hand, after mixing DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl with the polymer donors, PBDB-T-based blends exhibit a remarkably higher χdonor–acceptor value (9.46 and 5.89k) than the PBDB-TF-based ones (3.59 and 1.55k), which indicates the worse miscibility between PBDB-T and the SMAs compared to that between PBDB-TF and the SMAs. The reduced miscibility of two components (polymer donors and SMAs) may lead to large-scale phase separation as depicted in AFM images (Fig. 5a and c),66 which should be one of the reasons for the worse performance of PBDB-T-based PSCs relative to PBDB-TF. Therefore, the different miscibility of various donor:SMA pairs elucidates the diversity of the corresponding blend morphology and device performance, especially for FF.62,64

In addition, the DSC curves of the donor:SMA pairs were tested to confirm the results gained from the calculated χdonor–acceptor values.67–69 From Fig. S6 in the ESI,† one can find that the endothermic peak (Tm, in the second heating cycle) and exothermic peak (Tc, in the first cooling cycle) signals of DTCFO-ICCl (see Fig. S2b, ESI†) almost disappear in the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICCl blend, whereas the endothermic peak (in the second heating cycle, ∼270 °C) signal of the PBDB-T:DTCFO-ICF blend is still visible, which should be ascribed to Tm of DTCFO-ICF (see Fig. S2a, ESI†). For PBDB-TF-based blends, the same conclusion can be obtained as displayed in Fig. S6c and d (ESI†). According to these results, there is a reason to suspect that for the two SMAs, DTCFO-ICCl possesses better miscibility with the polymer donors relative to DTCFO-ICF, which is consistent with the above calculated Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (Table 4) and can well illustrate the difference in the blend film morphology and device performance of various donor:SMA pairs.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we prepared two new D–A–D-type SMAs DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl based on the fluorene-fused heptacyclic DTCF central core end-capped with the halogenated ICF and ICCl, respectively, with the aim of inspecting the halogenation of the A group and change of the polymer donor impacting the optoelectronic and morphological properties as well as photovoltaic performances. The introduction of a halogen atom (F and Cl) into the A group resulted in a red-shifted absorption spectrum, a reduced optical band gap, increased charge carrier mobility, and down-shifted HOMO/LUMO levels as compared with the nonhalogenated counterpart (DTCFO-IC). With respect to DTCFO-IC, PSCs based on the two halogenated SMAs with polymer PBDB-T as a donor produced a comparable (6.80%) or even higher PCE (8.55%) mainly due to the improved Jsc, but a reduced Voc. By replacing PBDB-T, PBDB-TF-based PSCs almost retained rather high Jsc and FF, accompanied by an obviously improved Voc (0.99 and 0.93 V) simultaneously because of the relatively lower-lying HOMO level of PBDB-TF. As a result, the device performance of the two SMAs paired with PBDB-TF was further enhanced with higher PCEs of 7.67% and 11.03% for DTCFO-ICF and DTCFO-ICCl, respectively. The improved device performance was closely related to the increased charge transport and collection properties, suppressed charge recombination and more optimal active layer morphology. Our results highlight that the device performance can be further enhanced by means of balancing photovoltaic parameters through integrating the halogenation on the A group of an A–D–A acceptor and change of the paired polymer donor.
