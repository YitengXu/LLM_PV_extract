    , Accepted 13th October 2020First published on 13th October 2020AbstractMemristors that possess massive memory capacity and outstanding processing efficiency concurrently are vitally important to surmount the limitation of Moore's law and traditional Von Neumann bottleneck. Specifically, memristors are capable of integrating various functionalities such as information storage and processing into just one unit to obtain high electrical performance and thereby satisfy the contemporary needs. Here, a multifunctional polymer memristor with combined data storage and processing abilities on the basis of novel solution-processed poly(9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene)-alt-1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-(5,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)-alt-((2,4-pentanedionato)bis(2-(thiophen-2-yl)-pyridine)iridium) (PFTBDD-IrTPy) is demonstrated for the first time. As confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the memristive behavior of the multifunctional device is attributed to the synergetic electrochemical metallization and charge transfer effect.

Introduction
Data storage and processing constitute the basic functions of contemporary computers. With the explosive increase of digital transmission in artificial intelligence and big-data age, computer systems possessing massive memory capacity and outstanding processing efficiency are urgently needed to be exploited in various fields such as machine learning and network monitoring.1–3 Nevertheless, successive scaling down to increase the number of devices per unit area and thereby the storage capacity seems to be a limitation towards this goal due to the quantum uncertainty and fabrication complexity. On the other hand, the frequent access and transmission of data between central processing unit and memory can greatly increase the energy consumption, thereby reducing the information processing efficiency. Therefore, the existing challenges and obstacles to keep up with Moore's law and traditional Von Neumann computing architecture need to be taken into account.4–7 To surmount these physical limitations and integrate memory and processing, memristors with in-memory computing properties were theoretically put forward as the fourth basic circuit element by Leon Chua in 1971 and then were experimentally verified in electronic devices based on titanium dioxide in 2008.8,9 Unlike the three-terminal transistor that stores information via the trapping and releasing of charges, a memristor encodes data on the basis of the resistance change of the active layer under specific electrical stimulus and can realize memory and processing functionalities concurrently.10 In diverse kinds of memristors, resistive random access memory (RRAM) is more common and has been extensively researched due to its plentiful advantages such as convenient access via interconnect electrodes, low energy dissipation and superior scalability and integration capability.11–22
Until now, various conductive mechanisms such as conductive filaments,23–25 space charge limited current (SCLC)26 and charge trapping assisted hopping27 have been utilized to interpret the memristive behaviors, and diverse active materials such as oxides,20 conjugated polymers,12,28 2D materials15 and perovskites13,29 have been exploited to implement the resistance change performance. Nonetheless, several impediments such as the relatively large power consumption to prepare oxides, the air stability of perovskites and the fabrication complexity and integration capability of 2D materials still need to be overcome. Compared to these materials, numerous merits of conjugated polymers such as simple structure, low cost, facile solution preparation and good 3D-stacking ability and scalability endow them significant advantages to be utilized for data storage and processing.30–35 Semiconducting materials have attracted the attention of many research groups as they can be used widely in many applications.36–38 Among them, optoelectronic organic polymers comprising phosphorescent iridium(III) (Ir(III)) complexes have received widespread concern. They have been extensively employed as emitters in organic light-emitting diodes due to their short life as well as large quantum efficiency induced by the inner intense spin–orbit coupling.39 Besides, they have also been exploited as active materials in organic solar cells via the use of the formed triplet excitons.40 Since covalent bonds connect the phosphorescent chromophores to composite materials, these kinds of polymers possess plentiful superior properties, for instance, a representative donor–acceptor configuration, good intra- and interchain charge transport characteristics as well as favorable film-forming capability and chemical stability, which are beneficial for their application as an active layer in electronic devices. Nonetheless, as far as we know, the employment of an Ir-based conjugated polymer in memristors has been seldom investigated. The vast majority of reported polymer-based RRAMs usually focus on simple binary data storage with insufficient reproducibility. In addition, the structure–characteristic of polymer-based RRAM relationship requires further clarification for deep understanding.
To address these issues, a donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymer with Ir complex through the polymer backbone was synthesized via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling polymerization reactions, and then utilized as the active material in a multifunctional memristive device to realize concurrent data storage and processing operations. We chose the fluorene unit as an electron-donating group because of its excellent photoelectronic properties (e.g., high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) and its previous use in various applications. In addition, TBDD and IrTPy comonomers were considered as electron-withdrawing groups to facilitate intramolecular charge transfer. The amount of IrTPy complex for polymerization was consistent with our previous reports on Pt-based conjugated polymers36,38 and the resulting new polymer in this article is designated as PFTBDD-IrTPy. The structure and synthetic route towards the resulting polymer are described in Fig. 1a and Scheme 1. The fluorene and TBDD co-monomers consist of octyl groups and ethylhexyl groups, respectively, to provide large steric hindrance and reduce the phenomenon of aggregation, resulting in highly solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane (DCM), at room temperature. The polymer was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the synthesized polymer were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (see Table S1, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the PFTBDD-IrTPy copolymer was 61650 g mol−1, and its PDI was 1.54. The iridium content of the PFTBDD-IrTPy polymer as evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was found to be 2142 ppm.

All the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristors presented the representative bipolar resistive switching performance with relatively low SET and RESET voltages, a large ON/OFF ratio as well as excellent retention capability. Besides, by modulating the compliance currents during the SET operation, multilevel data storage with diverse repeatable and reversible current states can also be realized and verified in the capital letters “RRAM” in a 13 × 13 device array. Moreover, by combining a series of control experiments with different test conditions, FE-SEM, EDX and DFT calculations, the synergetic electrochemical metallization and charge transfer effect are considered to lead to the resistive switching behavior. Inspired by the similarity between the migration of Ca2+ ions and neurotransmitters in chemical synapses and the cationic transport in the device, diverse synaptic processing behaviors such as paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), spiking-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) are also successfully implemented in the memristor. Finally, by setting appropriate electrical spikes, simple Boolean logic function as well as basic arithmetic operations and commutative law of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can also be achieved in our device. These results may have directive significance to the utilization of metal complex polymer based memristors for future multifunctional applications of organic electronics.
Results and discussion
We examined the photophysical properties of PFTBDD-IrTPy using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Fig. 1b presents the absorption spectra of PFTBDD-IrTPy which exhibit two characteristic absorption bands near 380 and 500 nm, while the photoluminance of FTBDD-IrTPy was observed at 590 nm. We assign the higher-energy absorption band to π–π* transitions from the polymer main chain, and the longer-wavelength absorption band to intramolecular charge transfer from the polymer main chain to the acceptor co-monomer and Ir complex monomer moieties. The optical band gap of PFTBDD-IrTPy was found to be approximately 2.19 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 1c presents the 3D schematic illustration of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristor, where a representative metal–insulator–metal (MIM) architecture is exploited. The details of RRAM construction are provided in the Experimental section in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1d, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was utilized to characterize the microscopic morphology of the spin-coated PFTBDD-IrTPy layer which displayed a relatively small root-mean-square roughness of approximately 0.614 nm, indicative of a smooth and high-quality film. The thickness of the as-fabricated PFTBDD-IrTPy film was found to be about 35 nm based on the side-view SEM image of the device (Fig. 1e).
The current–voltage (I–V) properties of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristive device with a crossbar configuration of glass substrate/ITO (185 nm)/PFTBDD-IrTPy (35 nm)/Ag (35 nm) are presented in Fig. 2a. This device presents the representative bipolar resistive switching phenomena. After a positive formation process and a negative switch-off, with a constant compliance current (ICC) of 1 mA and an increased electrical stress ranging from 0 to 3 V, the device initially possesses a high resistance state (HRS) and then its resistance abruptly decreases at a SET voltage (VSET) of 0.75 V, signifying that the device has been programmed from HRS to low resistance state (LRS). Subsequently, with a constant ICC of 100 mA and a gradually increased bias from 0 to −3 V, an abrupt increase in resistance occurs at a RESET bias (VRESET) of −0.4 V, indicating the successful erasing operation from LRS to HRS. It is worth pointing out that the program and erase process of the device can only be realized with positive and negative voltages respectively as confirmed by plentiful measurements. Because the rupture of conductive filaments regulated via Joule heating is independent of voltage polarity in phase-change devices, the heating effect will not dominate the erase operation of the device even though it exists. The retention and endurance characteristics of the device were also measured and evaluated and 0.1 V electrical stress was deliberately chosen to monitor the change of electrical currents in HRS and LRS. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device displays negligible degradation after 24 h and stable resistive switching behaviors after 200 program/erase sweep cycles, suggesting its prominent stability, repeatability and reliability. During various bias cycles, the fracture of multiple already formed conductive filaments induced by oxidation and Joule heating is incomplete and random and a small part of stable charge transfer states also may not recover under reverse bias and are stochastic, which finally can make the HRS in different scanning different and induce fluctuation. And the reason why the HRS in positive and negative sides is different may be because the potential barrier (1.21 eV) between Ag (4.26 eV) and PFTBDD-IrTPy (HOMO: 5.47 eV) is larger than that (0.67 eV) between ITO (4.8 eV) and PFTBDD-IrTPy. The larger barrier under positive bias can induce relatively large resistance and lower OFF current. The endurance capability of our memristors can be further improved by optimizing the film forming conditions, modulating the interface contact between electrodes and active layer and utilizing encapsulation layers. In addition, 100 RRAM devices were chosen stochastically and their ON/OFF currents (read at 0.1 V) and VSET/VRESET were extracted to analyze the device-to-device variability. According to the results in Fig. 2d and e, the ON and OFF currents of these devices range from 8.91 × 10−4 to 2.84 × 10−3 and 9.51 × 10−13 to 6.4 × 10−7 A, respectively. The Gaussian distributions of SET and RESET voltages are 0.96 ± 0.25 and −0.58 ± 0.13 V, respectively. Generally, it is believed that the construction of a conductive filament is more stochastic compared with the rupture of a whole filament due to the fact that the construction operation is dominated by the competition between various conductive paths.41 Thus one may discover more scattering VSET and OFF current values, which have been verified by numerous similar works. In this respect, the resistive switching behaviors of the device are extremely possible to be controlled via the filament formation and rupture process (electrochemical redox reactions). Furthermore, the essential resistive switching characteristics such as VSET, VRESET, endurance and retention of memristive devices based on organic materials are summarized in Table 1.42–56 Compared with other organic RRAM devices, the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device possesses the lowest SET and RESET voltages, the largest ON/OFF ratio as well as excellent endurance and retention capability.

For the purpose of understanding the conductive mechanism of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristive device, the log–log figure of the experimental data during the programming process is re-plotted (Fig. 2f). As shown in the plot, the relation between current and voltage in LRS obviously displays an Ohmic conduction phenomenon (slope is 0.99, I ∝ V) which might be attributed to filament formation in the RRAM after the SET operation. However, the I–V relationship in HRS matches well with the trap-controlled space charge limited conduction (SCLC) mechanism that is composed of an Ohmic portion (slope is 1.21, I ∝ V), a Child's law portion (slope is 2.00, I ∝ V2) and a steep conductance augment portion.57 The entirely different charge transport performance in HRS and LRS also indicates that the large current in LRS is supposed to be derived from a restricted and filamentary effect which also provides an approach for further scaling. Next, the multilevel data storage capacity of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device was investigated and ICC was modulated continuously in the SET operation. As presented in Fig. 2g, multiple reversible current states can be realized via tuning the compliance current values from 0.1 mA to 10 mA and meanwhile the memory windows are still high enough to be differentiated. Besides, it is noteworthy that both the currents and VSET increase gradually with the increase of ICC, which might stem from the formation of more and strong filaments which require a stronger electric field and result in higher conductance of the device. In addition, to further verify their relationship, the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristor was repeatedly swept 10 times under an identical compliance current situation, after which the SET voltages were extracted for Gaussian distribution fitting (Fig. S2, ESI†). The average SET voltages are 0.182 V (standard deviation: 0.044 V), 0.484 V (standard deviation: 0.062 V), 0.769 V (standard deviation: 0.09 V), 0.99 V (standard deviation: 0.075 V), and 1.294 V (standard deviation: 0.101 V) under an ICC of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mA, respectively. Based on these average SET values, it is obvious that the SET voltages rise gradually with increasing ICC values, which is attributed to the formation of thicker filaments and is in good agreement with the previous findings. Besides, we also conducted Gaussian distribution fitting of the extracted HRS currents from 10 repeated voltage sweeping under an identical compliance current situation (Fig. S3, ESI†). The average HRS currents are 3.14 × 10−10 A (standard deviation: 2.42 × 10−10 A), 3.43 × 10−10 A (standard deviation: 3.05 × 10−10 A), 4.59 × 10−10 A (standard deviation: 2.58 × 10−10 A), 2.78 × 10−10 A (standard deviation: 2.06 × 10−10 A), and 2.31 × 10−10 A (standard deviation: 2.15 × 10−10 A) under an ICC of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mA, respectively. According to our test results, it is evident that the HRS and current compliance are not necessarily related due to the fluctuation of HRS. Furthermore, based on our measurement in Fig. S4 (ESI†), our memristor indeed can display some volatile threshold switching behaviors under relatively low compliance currents (e.g., 10−7 A) due to the formation of unstable thin conductive filaments and charge transfer states. Moreover, 10 cycles (Fig. 2h) and 20 stochastically chosen devices (Fig. 2i) were utilized to investigate the current distributions under diverse ICC to evaluate the cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variability. Evidently, the different current states are repeatable and reversible during 10 sweeping cycles and these states between various devices are also stable and uniform. The average currents in LRS are 2.75 × 10−5 A (standard deviation: 7.92 × 10−6 A), 9.52 × 10−5 A (standard deviation: 1.04 × 10−5 A), 3.75 × 10−4 A (standard deviation: 4.77 × 10−5 A), 9.30 × 10−4 A (standard deviation: 4.03 × 10−5 A), and 2.21 × 10−3 A (standard deviation: 3.37 × 10−4 A) under an ICC of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mA, respectively. Furthermore, the retention ability of the multiple data levels was studied utilizing a memristive array with 13 × 13 memory cells (middle part of the 20 × 20 crossbar array, see the real photo in Fig. S5, ESI†) and the operation chart is provided in Fig. 2j. Several specific devices in the array were exerted with 2 V bias and various ICC values (the first “R”: ICC = 0.5 mA; the second “R”: ICC = 1 mA; “A”: ICC = 5 mA and “M”: ICC = 10 mA) and then 0.1 V bias was exploited to monitor the current value in LRS immediately (Fig. 2k) and after 4 × 103 s (Fig. 2l). Based on the experimental results, the currents under various ICC display no obvious distinction over time, signifying the feasibility of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device as a multibit memory. We also tested the delay time of our memristor devices from HRS to LRS by utilizing the PGU channel in a Keysight B1500A semiconductor parameter analyzer to enforce various SET pulses with constant amplitude (3 V) and various delay time (1 ms to 100 ns). The results indicated that the memristor devices could achieve resistive switching behavior at a minimum delay time of about 200 ns and then maintain the conductive state under the applied reading voltage (Fig. S6, ESI†).15
In combination with the previous conjecture, another series of experiments were carried out to further elucidate the conductive mechanism of our memristive device. First, the dependence of current values in LRS and HRS (read at 0.2 V) on cell size was investigated as presented in Fig. 3a. Apparently, the current in HRS displays positive dependence on the cell area, indicating that the OFF current density flows evenly through the RRAM device. On the other hand, the LRS current is unassociated with the cell area, signifying that LRS is mainly mediated by microscopic localized conductive filaments. Subsequently, the relationship between sweep rate and resistive switching performance was also investigated. According to the results in Fig. 3b, with the increase in the sweep rate from 0.01 to 0.1 V, the SET voltages increase systematically and meanwhile several intermediate resistance states can be observed, which might be originated from the formation of more conductive filaments under denser sweep rate and the existence of a “netlike” filamentary architecture. Afterwards, to clarify the constituents of the filaments, we measured the resistance variation in HRS and LRS under various test temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3c, the resistance in LRS increases gradually with the increase in operating temperature, which is a representative metallic electronic transport performance where the dominant factor is phonon scattering. The metallic resistance as a function of temperature is usually written as R(T) = R0[1 + α(T − T0)](1)where α represents the temperature coefficient and R0 represents the metallic resistance under specific operating temperature T0.58 The fitting result is in good agreement with the linear function, which suggests that the conductive bridges consist of metallic silver in our case and confirms our previous hypotheses. And if T0 is selected to be 300 K, the value of α can be deduced to be 5.2 × 10−3 K−1, which is extremely similar to the values reported before.59 On the other hand, the resistance in HRS exhibits a negatively correlated behavior at different temperatures, which complies with logROFF ∝ T approximately and hence belongs to a representative semiconducting phenomenon. In this circumstance, the relationship between resistance and temperature obeys (2)where κ and ϕt refer to the Boltzmann constant and thermal activation energy, respectively. By exploiting the Arrhenius figure with increasing temperature ranging from 300 to 400 K, the thermal activation energy can be further derived to be approximately 537 meV (Fig. S7, ESI†). In addition, it is noteworthy that the memory window is still larger than 106 at 400 K, indicative of the good thermotolerance capability of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device.

To further visualize the growth process of the Ag conductive filaments in the polymer film directly, a planar Ag/PFTBDD-IrTPy/Ag device was prepared and then investigated by a microscopic SEM technique after the program operation. Fig. 3d shows the 3D structure of the planar cell and the representative I–V characteristics of the RRAM device. Notably, the SET and RESET voltages of the lateral device are significantly larger compared with those of the vertical device on account of the negative relativity between the electric field intensity and the thickness of the active layer. The SEM images in Fig. 3e present the microscopic changes of the PFTBDD-IrTPy layer before and after the SET operation. Apparently, the Ag conductive filaments that connect the gap between the electrodes on both sides can be detected and the element contents of regions 1–5 extracted from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) also validate the existence of Ag element in the conductive bridges and the transfer of Ag from the Ag electrode to the PFTBDD-IrTPy layer (Fig. 3f), which effectively support the previous judgment and the results of control experiments. In addition, we subjected the molecules to density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3g). We found that the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of the PFTBDD-IrTPy polymer were delocalized to some extent over the conjugated systems, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) were more localized over the acceptor co-monomer TBDD and IrTPy moieties. This phenomenon was in agreement with the results of UV-Vis measurements above. In PFTBDD-IrTPy, the fluorene moieties function as electron donors while TBDD and IrTPy comonomers act as electron acceptors. Molecular electrostatic potential (ESP, Fig. 3h) surfaces show that an open channel is formed from the molecular surface throughout the polymer backbone with a positive ESP (in blue), which is advantageous to the migration of charge carriers through the polymeric main chain and side chain. Therefore, effective charge transfer may occur while PFTBDD-IrTPy is stimulated by external electrical bias, transporting carriers from fluorene moieties to TBDD and IrTPy comonomers and thereby generating charge transfer states.18,60,61 Besides, the negative ESP (in red) caused by the oxygen of TBDD and IrTPy further demonstrates that the charge carriers can be trapped in these locations and hence stable charge transfer states can be produced.62–64 So, under positive external voltage, the dipole moment gradually changes and the charge transfer process between donors and acceptors can occur, eventually resulting in the generation of charge transfer complexes.64,65 The aforementioned open channel can make the charge carriers (electrons) between donors and acceptors migrate much easier between various molecular chains and generate stable charge transfer states, which finally leads to an abrupt increase in the conductance of the polymer layer (switch from HRS to LRS). The LRS can be well maintained even after the electrical bias is removed (nonvolatile characteristic) due to the good stability of charge transfer states (may stem from the superior capture ability of TBDD and IrTPy comonomers and the formation of strong dipole moment) as well as the stable conductive bridges formed. However, the applied reverse voltage on the polymer can lead to the dissociation of charge transfer complexes as well as the fracture of conductive filaments and hence switch the devices from LRS to HRS. Overall, the synergetic electrochemical metallization and charge transfer effect throughout the polymer backbone (the switching characteristic induced by the individual charge transfer effect can also be demonstrated by a Au/PFTBDD-IrTPy/Au contrast device and the result is displayed in Fig. S8, ESI†) are considered to lead to the resistive switching behavior.
The cationic transport in the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device bears resemblance to the migration of Ca2+ ions and neurotransmitters in chemical synapses. As shown in Fig. 4a, in biological neural systems, when the stimulus is transmitted to the presynaptic membrane, the Ca2+ channels will open and then lead to the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal to the synaptic cleft, which finally induces the potentiation or depression effects of the postsynaptic membrane and hence achieves information transmission function. Similarly, electrical spikes can be applied to the electrodes of our memristor to induce the transport of Ag ions and hence realize the dynamic modulation of device conductance, which can be utilized to mimic the biological synaptic behaviors. Fig. 4b presents the representative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) density of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device under various pulse amplitudes (1, 2, 3 and 4 V) and identical duration (100 ms) and base voltage (0.01 V). Obviously, the current density after spike increases gradually with increasing pulse amplitudes on account of the nucleation and growth of more Ag conductive filaments in the active layer. Besides, it is noteworthy that the increased current density induced by relatively small amplitudes can only last a few seconds while that induced by relatively large voltages can last for more than 900 s, which corresponds to short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP), respectively. This can be understood from the viewpoint that the formed thermodynamically unstable Ag conductive filaments under relatively small amplitudes tend to disappear after several seconds while the growth of more stable filaments under relatively large voltages can induce the persistent potentiation of device current. Despite the fact that STP and LTP are frequently achieved via different pulse numbers or pulse frequencies, the adjustment of spike amplitude is a more convenient and effective approach to selectively implement STP and LTP in the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device. Fig. 4c displays the current variation of the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device stimulated by a series of single spikes with various amplitudes and durations. Evidently, the EPSC of the memristor can be tuned widely, indicative of the large-scale synaptic weights to be exploited in neuromorphic computing applications.

Subsequently, another form of STP called paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in which a former impulse can promote a succeeding reaction of biological synapses was then emulated. Analogous to the chemical synaptic behaviors in neural systems, the percentage variation of the peak current ((A2 − A1)/A1, defined as the PPF index) shows a negative correlation with the time interval, as shown in Fig. 4d. The extracted PPF index is approximately 20% under 10 ms interval while it reduces exponentially with increasing interval ranging from 10 ms to 2 s. The relationship between PPF index and time interval can be described by the following equation: (3)where C0, C1, C2, τ1 and τ2 represent a constant, the original amplitudes of the slow and rapid phases and the relaxation times of those phases, respectively.66 The extracted fitting parameters for eqn (3) (R2 is about 0.99) including C0, C1, C2, τ1 and τ2 are 4.68 × 10−4, 2.22 × 10−1, 5.58 × 10−2, 25 ms and 972 ms, respectively. The two calculated time constants (τ1: 25 ms, τ2: 972 ms) are in accordance with the characteristic values in chemical synapses (τ1: 40 ms, τ2: 300 ms). In addition, another form of LTP called spiking-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) has also been investigated in our device via modulating the pulse shape applied on top and bottom electrodes. A very significant feature of STDP is that the synaptic efficacy can be well controlled and tuned when the time interval between pre- and post-synaptic impulse gradually changes, which is essential for our brain to realize the memory and learning functions. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, two categories of STDP comprising symmetric Hebbian rule (Fig. 4e) and symmetric anti-Hebbian rule (Fig. 4f) have been implemented in the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device and the experimental data have been fitted exploiting the classic Gaussian function (4)where A and τ are the scaling factor and time constant, respectively.67 The extracted fitting parameters for eqn (4) (symmetric Hebbian learning rule, R2 is about 0.97) including A, τ and W0 are 6.18 × 10−1, 20 ms and −2.12 × 10−1, respectively. The extracted fitting parameters for eqn (4) (symmetric anti-Hebbian learning rule, R2 is about 0.95) including A, τ and W0 are −2.91 × 10−1, 126 ms and −9.57 × 10−2, respectively. The fitted time constants of these two learning rules are in the millisecond timescale, indicating a slightly faster STDP behavior in our device when compared to that in the human brain.
On the basis of the aforementioned STP and LTP phenomena, a 5 × 8 memristor array was further utilized to mimic the process of dynamically memorizing and forgetting two pictures, which is one of the most fundamental functions of the human brain. These 40 synaptic devices display a relatively homogeneous original current density, hence confirming the feasibility of the simulation process. As schematically shown in Fig. 4g, the pictures of capital letters “A” and “W” were concurrently stored exploiting electrical spikes with various potentiating amplitudes of 1 and 4 V which could induce STP and LTP and thereby realize the forgetfulness and memorization functions respectively. The corresponding test results are presented in Fig. 4h and the current density of the memristors is utilized to describe the memorized information. Originally, both “A” and “W” letters possess a relatively large current density. Nevertheless, the letter “W” basically remains unchanged with time while the letter “A” simply fades away, which indicates that the capital letters “A” and “W” are stored in short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), respectively. This successful simulation of the forgetfulness and memorization of “A” and “W” also effectively demonstrates the relatively homogeneous, stable and reliable electrical performance of our PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device. Then, analogous memristor arrays with various sizes can be utilized to achieve more complicated biological functions in neural systems such as associative learning.
Apart from the memory and synapse applications, the appropriate design of electrical spikes also enables the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based memristor to perform the nonvolatile binary logic function, which is essential for information processing. A single bipolar resistive switch (BRS) has been utilized to achieve various logic functionalities. As shown in Fig. 4i and j, the two different logical variables p and q represent various potentiating voltages such as ‘1’ (high potential, 2 V) or ‘0’ (low potential, −2 V) and they are exerted to top and bottom electrodes, respectively. If these two variables have an identical voltage level (e.g., ‘0’ or ‘1’), obviously no potential difference is applied onto cells. The two different states Z = ‘0’ and Z = ‘1’ represent the HRS and LRS of the device respectively, which are labelled by squares and circles, respectively. For read-out, after employing a small read bias, the HRS and LRS are defined as output ‘0’ and ‘1’, respectively. According to Fig. 4i and j, it is evident that our cell can only be switched from Z = ‘0’ to Z = ‘1’ under the situation of p = ‘1’ and q = ‘0’ and it can only be switched from Z = ‘1’ to Z = ‘0’ under the situation of p = ‘0’ and q = ‘1’. Therefore, under various initial states Z′, our cell displays either the inverse implication (NIMP) for the initial HRS or the reverse implication (RIMP) for the initial LRS. Due to the dependence between logical operation and original state Z′, a stateful logic is probable and generally a determined original state Z′ is required. So, the first required logic functions are TRUE and FALSE and they must be realized in the first cycle. And then by sequentially applying p and q under two or three cycles, more various logic operations such as OR, NOR, AND and NAND can be achieved (Fig. S9, ESI†). Finally, 14 of 16 Boolean logic functions can be implemented in a single BRS device and these logics are saved into the memory directly. Moreover, the remaining two functions including XNOR and XOR can also be realized if two cells are connected by a wired AND (one IMP and the other RIMP for XNOR while one OR and the other NAND for XOR).68 Furthermore, more logic concepts including MAGIC, MRL and PINATUBO will be investigated in our future work.69–73
Finally, since the increase and reduction of the device current under positive and negative pulses extremely resemble the addition and subtraction operations of an abacus, our PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device can also be utilized to implement the decimal arithmetic functions, which is meaningful for proposing novel computation concepts. In order to serve effectively as an abacus, the device current change and pulse number should show a relatively good linearity. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the current density of the memristor read at 0.01 V can be tuned consecutively and approximately linearly under successive positive (3 V, 100 ms) and negative (−4 V, 100 ms) pulse trains. To further ensure the accuracy of decimal abacus, the current variation of our device under pulse mode has been calibrated to realize a 6 − 6 = 0 operation (Fig. 5a). The current variation increases to 17.3% after 6 continuous positive spikes and thereby the number 6 is counted during calculation while the current variation is derived to be 17.3%. If we define 0 as the current variation of 0%, then 0–6 decimal numbers are capable of being indexed proportionally. The increased current variation can be reduced back to 0% after 6 successive negative pulses, demonstrating the successful implementation of the 6 − 6 = 0 subtraction function and calibration of our device for accurate decimal arithmetic application. Subsequently, four basic arithmetic operations comprising addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and commutative law are realized in the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device. As presented in Fig. 5b, the four electrical pulses applied first together with the two electrical pulses applied later can lead to a current variation of 17.3% (refer to the natural number 6 and thus indicate 4 + 2 = 6), which is the same as the results under an inverse applied sequence of electrical pulses. All the exerted electrical spikes possess identical parameters and thereby the commutative law of addition (A + B = B + A) is successfully implemented in the memristor (4 + 2 = 2 + 4 = 6). Fig. 5c displays the realization of the commutative law of subtraction (A − B − C = A − C − B). After applying 6 sequential positive spikes and hence inducing a current variation of 17.3%, the subsequently applied two sets of 4 negative and 2 negative spikes or 2 negative and 4 negative spikes both can make the value of current variation go to 0%, which suggests 6 − 4 − 2 = 6 − 2 − 4 = 0 and is consistent with the commutative subtraction operation. Analogously, the multiplication function is achieved on the basis of the accumulative addition calculation and thereby also works for the commutative law (Fig. 5d). As can be seen, the current variation induced by two sets of three positive spikes and three sets of two positive spikes is identical, which effectively confirms 3 × 2 = 2 × 3 = 6 (A × B = B × A). At last, the division (mainly fractional division) operation is implemented based on the combination of addition and subtraction calculation. In the division operation, A ÷ B stands for “A − B − B − B…” and these consecutive subtraction operations will last until the divisor (B) is larger compared to the remainder (R). And then the remainder R is replaced by R + R × 9 to perform the subsequent consecutive subtraction operations and these processes will be repeated until R becomes 0. The number of subtractions is defined as the final quotient. Herein, 6 ÷ 5 = 1.2 is realized in the PFTBDD-IrTPy-based device (Fig. 5e). A string of six positive spikes is first exerted and then another series of five negative spikes is loaded, which represents a 6 − 5 operation and gives rise to a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. Because the divisor 5 is much larger compared to the remainder 1, the remainder 1 is replaced by 1 + 1× 9 and another set of nine positive spikes is applied to the memristor. The following two subtraction operations (−5) lead to the initial current variation (0%) and hence end the whole calculation process. Since the replacement occurs only once during operation, the number in the tenths position is 2 and thereby we can obtain 6 ÷ 5 = 1.2 (1 + 0.2). Compared to the previous realization of full adders and multipliers which require several devices and multiple steps,74–76 a single device in this case can be utilized to achieve simple arithmetic applications based on the potentiation and depression of electronic synapses and the power consumption of our device can be further reduced by optimizing the device fabrication (e.g., reduce the device area). To achieve a more general application, our device will be further optimized and utilized to combine with logic operations to realize full adders (include carry operations) and multipliers in modern computer systems in our future study.74–76

Conclusions
In summary, novel metal complex polymer PFTBDD-IrTPy has been first synthesized and exploited as a functional material to fabricate a multifunctional memristor array with integrated information storage and processing functionalities. The as-fabricated device exhibits a representative bipolar switching phenomenon with superior electrical performance and multilevel data storage. Control experiments, FE-SEM, EDX and DFT calculations indicate that the synergetic electrochemical metallization and charge transfer effect give rise to the resistance change behavior. Associated with these characteristics, our memristor is also capable of realizing other interesting functional applications such as artificial synaptic emulation, simple Boolean logic and decimal arithmetic calculation. Therefore, the combination of multibit data storage and processing capabilities into just one memristive cell via appropriate molecular engineering of metal complex polymers provides an effective approach to acquire high-performance electronic products which meet the increased requirements of contemporary information storage and computing.
