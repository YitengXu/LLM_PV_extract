1. Introduction
As one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies, much attention has been paid to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1,2 Benefiting from the continuing optimization of materials and fabrication procedures, a conversion efficiency of more than 12% has been recently obtained.3 However, this kind of cell is usually based on a rigid fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate, which restricts its adaptability during transportation, installation, and remote application. Therefore, the development of new types of solar cell on flexible substrates has become a challenge.4,5 Flexible solar cells hold many advantages over their flat counterparts, such as their soft and flexible nature, free size and low cost, as well as their tendency to be light and thin.6–13 A high conversion efficiency of 7.2% has been achieved for flexible DSSCs using metal sheets as the substrate.8 In order to further strengthen flexible DSSC's adaptability, weavable fiber-shaped DSSCs using different wires (titanium wires, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes) as substrates were developed.14–20 Fiber-shaped solar cells can break the limitations of traditional flexible planar solar cells with regards to the possible shapes and materials and they can be built into three-dimensional modules with diverse shapes suitable for highly efficient light absorption and the production of power supplies for portable devices. In comparison to plastic and polymer substrates, stainless steel mesh (SSM) can withstand a high-temperature sintering process and simultaneously possesses high flexibility and transparency.21–23 Meanwhile, relative to metal foils, metal meshes can also provide large substrate surface areas for loading light-harvesting components. The challenge in fabricating SSM-based flexible solar cells lies in the successful construction of a well-defined semiconductor oxide on cylindrical metal microwires to achieve desirable performances.
ZnO possesses higher electron mobility and a similar electronic band structure with respect to TiO2.24−28 Various strategies have been addressed to enhance the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) mainly through tailoring the geometrical and structural features of ZnO.29 The cell of ZnO photoanodes, consisting of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanowire (NW) arrays, are expected to exhibit a faster electron transport with reduced recombination loss.30,31 Nevertheless, such DSSCs still suffer from lower power conversion efficiencies compared to the ZnO nanoparticle-based ones. This is mainly due to the lower specific surface areas of the NW arrays. While incorporation of nanoparticles with original 1D nanostructures to produce NW/nanoparticle composites can enhance the light harvesting and dye loading, serious charge recombination originating from excess electron hoping through interparticle barriers limits the enhancement of the conversion efficiency. Dendritic NW arrays are desirable nanostructures for use as photoanodes with simultaneously improved surface areas and favorable electron transportation.32,33 Creation of such complex nanoarchitectures, however, remains a challenge, especially on cylindrical or fiber-shaped substrates with large curvatures.
In this paper, we report the controllable growth of ZnO dendritic arrays on a SSM substrate. The SSM-supported dendritic ZnO nanostructure was utilized as a photoanode for large-area, flexible DSSCs. The unique dendritic nanostructure proves favorable for the improvement of the overall light conversion efficiency of the DSSC through an enhancement of the dye loading associated with an enhanced photon absorption and supply of a direct path for electron transport.
2. Experimental and characterization
2.1. Materials
Zinc nitrate hydrate, hexamethylenetetramine and ammonia were purchased from Qiangsheng Chemical Co. (China). Polyethylenimine (Mw = 800) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. All water used in this investigation was deionized by a Nanopure filtration system to a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm. The mesh (Shangyu Metal Mesh Co., China) was cleaned and degreased via multiple cleaning steps. The mesh was then sonicated for 10 min successively in acetone, absolute ethanol and deionized water. The mesh was finally blown dry in a stream of nitrogen gas.
The growth process of the dendritic ZnO NWs on the SSM is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. A 10–15 nm thick film of ZnO quantum dots was deposited onto a SSM by dip coating and heat treatment at 350 °C for 10 minutes (S1 of Fig. 1). The seeded mesh was then immersed in a precursor solution containing 50 mM zinc nitrate hydrate, 25 mM hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and 5 mM polyethylenimine (PEI) together with ammonia (1.5 M) at 90 °C for 3 hours to allow the formation of backbone ZnO NWs (S2).29 The backbone ZnO NWs were then modified through a chemical etching process by immersing the NWs in an aqueous solution of thiacetamide (CH3CSNH2), followed by hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for different times (S3). The surface-treated NW was then rinsed with deionized water, dried and annealed at 500 °C for 3 hours in air, which allowed the NW backbone to be coated in with uniform layer of ZnO seeds (S4). Finally, the as-modified ZnO NW was introduced into a fresh bath to grow the branch NWs, resulting in the dendritic ZnO nanostructures (S5).

2.2. Material characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM230, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010, Japan).
2.3. Photovoltaic characterization
To study the photovoltaic performance of the ZnO NW arrays with a dendritic structure on the SSM, open solar cells were fabricated. As-prepared ZnO NW arrays were rinsed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol to remove any residual reactants and then were sensitized in a solution of 0.5 mM (Bu4N)2[Ru(4,4′-(COOH)-2,2,-bipyridine)2(NCS)2] (N719 dye) in dry ethanol for 1 h without annealing. The sensitized NW arrays were then sandwiched together and bound with platinum catalyst-coated FTO counter electrodes separated by a 40 μm thick porous membrane. The electrolyte solution (50 mM LiI, 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 30 mM I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 50 mM tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15)) was introduced via capillary action into the gap formed by the two electrodes. The J–V measurements were carried out with a cell active area of 0.132 cm2 on a Keithley 236 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 illumination (standard 100 mW cm−2) cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated with the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell. With the exception of the sample that had 6 h etching (delay time: 300 ms), the I–V measurements were conducted using the same measuring parameters.
3. Results and discussion
The employed SSM (200 mesh) was made of a metal round wire with a diameter of about 40 μm and quite a smooth surface (Fig. 2a). The color of the SSM became white with the growth of the backbone ZnO NWs, indicating a successful coating with ZnO (Fig. 2b). The low-magnification scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of both the top- and cross-sections of the SSM confirm that the ZnO NWs were indeed uniformly and densely grown on the mesh substrate (Fig. 2c and d). The backbone NWs, with a length of ∼4 μm and diameters in the range 200–300 nm, were parallel to one another and perpendicular to the SSM substrate (Fig. 3a and b).

Chemical etching is a key factor for the growth of branch ZnO NWs on the backbone ZnO. With the etching process, the surface morphology of the ZnO backbone becomes slightly coarse after CH3CSNH2 treatment (Fig. 3c), during which tiny ZnS nanoparticles are formed and fully disperse on the ZnO NW backbone by the reaction of S2− anions, which are slowly released from CH3CSNH2, with the dissolved Zn2+ ions from the surface of the ZnO NWs.34 The reaction mechanism is suggested to be as follows: (1) H2S ↔ 2H+ + S2−(2) ZnO + 2H+ ↔ Zn2+ + H2O(3) Zn2+ + S2− ↔ ZnS(4)
The subsequent calcination in air allows the transformation of ZnS into ZnO, evidenced by the dramatic change in the surface roughness of the ZnO backbone (Fig. 3d). The embedded ZnO particles act as seeds for the subsequent branch growth of the ZnO NWs.
To produce desirable ZnO dendritic arrays with profusely branched NWs with a high surface area for a high conversion efficiency of the DSSC, the growth parameters of the NW branch on the backbone were optimized for the generation of high numbers of branches with long lengths. The presence of PEI has been reported to hinder the lateral growth of the ZnO NWs and NH3·H2O can substantially suppress ZnO homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, which avoids the rapid depletion of reactants and, thus, slows down the growth rate of the branched NWs.21Fig. 4 shows the top- and side-view FE-SEM images of NW arrays under different growth conditions (Table 1). In the absence of NH3·H2O, the array mainly consists of NWs with lengths of 900 nm and diameters of 30–60 nm (Fig. 4a). With substitution of NH3·H2O for PEI, the NWs exhibit elongated lengths of 1.8 μm together with wider diameters of 70–150 nm (Fig. 4b). With the synergistic mediation of NH3·H2O and PEI, ZnO NWs were further developed up to 4 μm in length without obvious thickening of their diameter compared to Fig. 4b (as shown in Fig. 4c). With an increase of the PEI concentration from 5 mM to 8 mM, the average diameter of the NWs was decreased while the length remained unchanged (Fig. 4d) and the NW number density of the latter was considerably higher than that of the former observed from the top-view images (insets in Fig. 4c and d). Moreover, the top parts of the NWs in the case of PEI = 8 mM prefer to inter-twist with each other, which may be favorable for an effective light scattering effect. A further increase of the PEI concentration to 10 mM, however, led to sparse NWs on the SSM substrates (Fig. 4e). The reason for this is that the existence of an excess of PEI may drastically increase the pH of the reaction solution, during which surplus OH− may participate in the erosion reaction according to ZnO + OH− → [Zn(OH)4]2−, leading to a difficult nucleation step. No ZnO formation on the SSM was observed with a decrease of the Zn2+ concentration to 15 mM in the presence of NH3·H2O, which is also due to the lack of a nucleation process as a result of a relative excess of OH− (Fig. 4f). On all accounts, parameter 4d listed in Table 1 was selected for the growth of the NW branch on the backbone for the generation of the dendritic array.

The etching time also plays an important role in the controlled growth of dendritic ZnO NWs. Fig. 5a shows that one hour etching leads to the NW branch growing only on the top part of the backbone NW. A short dipping time can not allow the CH3CSNH2 etching solution to deeply infiltrate the backbone NW array and, in this case, only the top-surface backbone NWs are modified. The hierarchical array thus obtained looks like a double-layer structure rather than a dendritic structure. With an increase of the etching time to 2 hours, the dendritic configuration begins to appear (Fig. 5b). Two-thirds of the height of the backbone was covered with NW branches. The well-ordered NW array dendritic nanostructures were produced with etching for 4 hours (Fig. 6), which enables the etching solution to completely penetrate the root of the NW backbone array. Such dendritic “trees” look like complex, network-like structures, fully covering the surface of the mesh substrate as can be seen by low-magnification FE-SEM (Fig. 6a). The side-view image reveals that the dendritic structure extended along the entire height of the NW arrays (Fig. 6b). The top-view image further indicates that the NW branches, with a diameter of 20–30 nm, densely entangle and pack together (Fig. 6c). The individual dendritic tree demonstrates that all branched NWs are oriented to the backbone NW axial and they radially project outwards (Fig. 6d). The TEM image shows that the NW branch is 200–400 nm in length and 20–50 nm in diameter (Fig. 7a). The HRTEM image and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the individual NW demonstrate that the NW is single-crystalline with a [0001] growth direction (Fig. 7b). With a further increase of the etching time to 6 hours, however, the dendritic nanostructure disappears and considerable nanoparticles are formed among the backbone interstice (Fig. 5c). The reason for this is due to the long-time etching process causing excessive overloading of the ZnO seeds, which makes the subsequent growing ZnO species develop into nanoparticles rather than their crystallization into NWs. The growth configuration of the ZnO nanostructure with the etching time is schematically summarized in Fig. 5d.

The SSM-supported ZnO dendritic NW array was utilized as a photoanode for the fabrication of a large-area, flexible DSSC (Fig. 8). The DSSC possessed relatively good flexibility when subjected to external force without an obvious degradation of the efficiency because of the slight relative displacement of horizontal and longitudinal wires, which can release some stress (Fig. 8a). The grid holes among the round wires of the SSM can act as both incidence passages for light and transport channels for the electrolyte solution (Fig. 8b). When light illuminates the photoanode, the excited electrons of the dye rapidly inject into the conduction band of the ZnO dendritic NW arrays and transport along the SSM wire. They then flow to the counter electrode through the external circuit (Fig. 8c). A photograph of the bent solar cell with a typical size of 10 cm × 5 cm under 1.5 AM light illumination demonstrates its output of ∼0.5 V following connection to a voltmeter (Fig. 8d).

Fig. 9 shows the I–V characteristics for dendritic ZnO NW array-based solar cells with different etching times and the DSSC characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The overall light conversion efficiency (η) increases with the enhanced integrality of the dendritic nanostructure. The η of the backbone NW (ca. 4–5 μm length) cell on the SSM was 0.61%, which is at the same level as the ZnO NW cells on an FTO glass substrate.31–36 This means that the ZnO NWs have good adhesion to the SSM substrate. The η of the well-defined ZnO dendritic tree array with 4 hour etching reaches 1.78%, which is enhanced by ca. 200% relative to the backbone NW cell and close to that of the hierarchically branched ZnO NW on a flat ITO glass substrate.32–36 This η is far higher than that (0.5%) of branched ZnO NW cells made by the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) routine, which usually have lower NW densities.31 The overall efficiency is also 20% higher than ref. 33 (1.51%). The efficiency is still a little lower than ref. 32 (2.63%), the substrate of which was ITO glass. Table 2 reveals that the main reason comes from the lower open-circuit voltage (0.48 V) of our solar cell, which may be due to the energy level mismatch between the interface of the ZnO NWs and the SSM substrate.21 An increase of the short-circuit current density (JSC) mainly contributes to the improvement of the overall efficiency, which can be explained by several combined effects: (1) the outgrowths of the branched NWs from the backbone NW significantly increase the surface area of the ZnO dendritic tree, which leads to an augmented dye loading associated with an enhanced photon absorption. This point could be confirmed by the improvement of the IPCE shown in Fig. 9b. The maxima of the IPCE, at approximately 525 nm, is contributed to by the dye absorption, which corresponds to the visible t2 → π* metal-to-ligand charge transfer.33 (2) Three-dimensional tree-like network structures increase the light-harvesting efficiency by the scattering enhancement and trapping (light–dye interaction).32,37 (3) The NW branch can provide a direct path for electron transport to the electrodes through the ZnO NW backbone without overcoming multiple hoping, which usually occurs among the nanoparticles.30–33 In the case of an etching time of 6 hours, the η shows an obvious decrease. It results from the weak interconnection among the ZnO nanoparticles and between the ZnO particle and the ZnO NW backbone, which seriously limits the electron diffusion coefficient and increases the transfer resistance.

4. Conclusions
Well-defined ZnO NW dendritic arrays were controllably built on a SSM and were utilized as photoanodes for the fabrication of a large-area, flexible DSSC. The unique dendritic nanostructure proves favorable for the improvement of the overall light conversion efficiency of the DSSC by enhancement of the dye loading associated with enhanced photon absorption, an increase of the light-harvesting efficiency and the supply of a direct path for electron transport. At present, the efficiency of the SSM-based solar cell is still relatively low but we believe it can be increased significantly by improving two factors: (1) the open-circuit voltage of our solar cell (0.48 V) is lower than that of conventional ITO-based DSSCs (generally beyond 0.6 V), which may be due to the energy level mismatch between the interface of ZnO NWs and the SSM substrate.21 Modification of the SSM with an appropriate buffer layer may be helpful to improve the open-circuit voltage prior to the growth of the ZnO. (2) The existence of contact resistance among the SSM wires may severely depress the electron transport. Thus, use of a more compact SSM may decrease the contact resistance.
