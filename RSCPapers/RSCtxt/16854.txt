    , Accepted 4th December 2017First published on 22nd December 2017AbstractRecently, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have received attention for applications in solar cells. Measurements of high-quality single crystals reveal lower defect densities and longer carrier lifetimes than those of conventional thin films, which result in improved electrical and optical properties. However, single crystal surfaces are sensitive to exposure to ambient conditions, and degrade under long-term storage in air. The surface also shows differences from the bulk in terms of its optical and electronic characteristics. For a heterojunction device, the interface at the single crystal is important. Understanding the difference between the surface and bulk properties offers insights into device design. Here, we prepared non-sliced and sliced formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3; FA+ = HC(NH2)2+) single crystals with a bandgap of 1.4 eV, which matches well with the requirements for solar cell photoabsorption layers. We evaluate the energy level diagrams of the surface and bulk regions, respectively. Our data indicate that the valence band maximum of the surface region is at a higher energy level than that of the bulk region. We also discuss hypotheses for the well-known and unexplained phenomena (multiple bandgaps and bandgap narrowing) seen in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra of single crystals. We conclude that these effects are likely caused by a combination of the degraded surface, Rashba-splitting in bulk, and self-absorption by the single crystal itself.
1. Introduction
Perovskite materials have the structure of ABX3, where: the A site features organic or inorganic cations such as Cs+, MA+ (CH3NH3+), and FA+ (HC(NH2)2+); the B site includes metals such as Pb2+ and Sn2+; and the X site contains halides such as Cl−, Br−, and I−. Such organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHP) have attracted great interest for use in solar cells.
Miyasaka et al. first reported that MAPbI3 acts as a photosensitizer for titanium oxide in a dye-sensitized solar cell, with a power-conversion efficiency, Eff = 3.8%.1 Various improvements of the hole-transport layer and other factors have since been reported,2–5 and Eff values of more than 22% for MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells have been achieved.6,7 Conventional MAPbI3 thin films (TFs) have a large bandgap of approximately 1.6 to 1.7 eV8–11 compared with theoretical predictions for the optimal bandgap (1.3 to 1.4 eV). These materials are effective photoabsorption layers for solar cells, because of a strong light absorption coefficient12 and a high carrier mobility.13–15 The absorption edge of an MAPbI3 single crystal (SC) is approximately 1.5 eV, and shows a noticeable red shift from that of the TF.14,16 A similar tendency for the absorption edge to shift has been reported for MAPbBr3.16–18 Moreover, for SCs of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 multiple peaks have been observed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra.17–20 Although there is no generally accepted explanation for this effect, some hypotheses include: surface defects,18 Fabry–Pérot interference,18,21 quantum size effects,22,23 self-absorption,17,19,20 lattice deformation,16,17,20 and Rashba effects.24–26 The Rashba splitting of an electronic band structure owing to spin–orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking in OIHP has been simulated.27–30 Recently, giant Rashba splitting was experimentally demonstrated for a MAPbBr3 SC with the use of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.31 In a MAPbI3 SC, the existence of an indirect bandgap has been confirmed by polarization-dependent photocurrent measurements.32 Thus, in addition to their uses in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices, OIHP SCs may also have applications in spintronic devices owing to their long spin diffusion length.32
In the large volume of research into OIHP SCs, some issues have been noted including surface degradation,16,17,20 ion migration,33–46 and deep defect traps.47–50 Recently, differences between the surface and bulk regions of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 SCs have been reported.16,17,20 Wu et al. showed that the surface region had a higher trap density, lower carrier lifetime, and wider bandgap than those of the bulk region.16 Murali et al. revealed that the surface of the as-grown SC behaves like a polycrystalline TF owing to hydration and lattice deformation.17,20 Moreover, it has been suggested that ion-vacancy pairs near the SC surface generate an electric field, resulting in the increase in bandgap.46 The degraded surface of the SCs has a considerable influence on the interface of heterojunction devices.17,20,46
Regarding ion migration, Eames et al. have suggested that the majority ionic carriers in MAPbI3 are I− ions, which move by hopping through I vacancy defects (VI) with a low activation energy and a high diffusion coefficient.38 Haruyama et al. suggested similar low barriers for the migration of MA+ vacancies (VMA) and FA+ vacancies (VFA) in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively.39 This result implies that both VFA and VMA can migrate. The migration of VMA and/or VI in MAPbI3 has been experimentally reported.35–37,40,42,43 However, recently, Senocrate et al. revealed that I− ions in MAPbI3 are the main mobile species contributing to ion conduction, using a multimethod approach.44 Moreover, the migration of I− ions was directly observed in the MAPbI3−xClx TF by glow discharge optical emission spectrometry.45 These defects create the defect states within the bandgap. The charge transition levels of defects in MAPbI3 have been reported;48 possible shallow donors include Pbi (interstitial Pb) and VI. The existence of deep defect levels has been theoretically47,48 and experimentally49,50 reported for MAPbI3. For example, DFT calculations have suggested that a Pb dimer associated with negatively-charged VI forms a deep defect level through a cooling process from 350 to 0 K.47
The bandgap of OIHPs can be easily manipulated by atomic substitution at each site. For example, substituting MA+ for FA+ ions at A sites will cause the bandgap to narrow,51,52 resulting in a bandgap of approximately 1.5 eV for the FAPbI3 TFs.51–56 Interestingly, FAPbI3 SCs (α-phase) have a narrow bandgap of approximately 1.4 eV,57–60 which matches well with the optimal bandgap for photovoltaic applications. These materials have drawn considerable attention for application as a photoabsorption layer for solar cells. Although many reports of MA-based OIHP SCs have been published, there have been fewer studies on the FAPbI3 SC. One reason for this lack of previous work is the gradual phase transition to a δ-phase,57–60 which occurs under ambient conditions. The SCs of δ-FAPbI3 show a wide bandgap (approximately 2.1 eV) and a low carrier mobility compared with that of α-FAPbI3 SCs.58 Contamination of the original α-phase by the δ-phase degrades the electrical and optical properties of the materials. Thus, careful handling of the α-FAPbI3 SC is required, avoiding humidity. Owing to these difficulties the difference between the surface and bulk properties, ion migration, and deep defect levels of FAPbI3 SCs have not yet been investigated experimentally.
Here we evaluate the energy level diagrams of the surface and bulk regions for a FAPbI3 SC made by an inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method.61 We studied the following electrical and optical properties: temperature dependence of electrical resistance with and without light illumination in hole-only and electron-only devices, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, transmittance and reflectance (TR) measurements, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, photoemission yield spectroscopy in air (PYSA), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). On the basis of these experimental results and previous reports, we discuss the origin of the multiple activation energies and bandgaps.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Sample preparation
FAPbI3 SCs were grown by an ITC method, with 1 M formamidinium iodide (FAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) in γ-butyrolactone solution. The FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 TFs were deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate by a conventional spin coating technique from a solution of 1 M FAI, methylammonium iodide (MAI), and PbI2 in dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by an annealing step to stabilize the α-phase. The samples were prepared and stored under a dry air atmosphere. The following measurements were conducted under a dry air atmosphere unless otherwise noted.
To examine the sample purity, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was collected on a diffractometer SmartLab 9 kW (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in dry air at room temperature.
2.2 Current–voltage measurements
For dark current (I)–voltage (V) measurements, we prepared a hole-only device with a gold (Au)/FAPbI3 SC (0.75 mm)/Au configuration and an electron-only device with a indium (In)/FAPbI3 SC (0.89 mm)/In configuration. The Au electrode (20 nm) was deposited by vacuum evaporation, and the In electrode was quickly welded with a soldering iron. Temperature dependent I–V curves were sequentially measured from high to low temperatures, where the I–V measurements were conducted after stabilizing for 5 min at each temperature. Incident light from a pseudo solar spectrum (air mass 1.5) was illuminated from the side of the Au electrode for the hole-only device, and was illuminated in the gap between the In electrodes for the electron-only device. The voltage was scanned from 0.1 to 10 V (forward), and then from 10 to 0.1 V (reverse).
2.3 External quantum efficiency measurements
The EQE of a solar cell with Au (40 nm)/FAPbI3 SC (2.16 mm)/gallium (Ga) configuration was measured with a spectral sensitivity measurement system (SM-250, Bunkoukeiki) under an applied bias voltage of −2.0 V. The Au/FAPbI3 SC was attached to a glass substrate with Ga paste, and then a heat treatment was performed at 50 °C for 5 min to make the device. Incident light was illuminated from the Au-electrode side.
2.4 Transmittance and reflectance measurements
We calculated absorption coefficient (α) from the data of TR measurements for the SCs sliced by FIB processing (thickness (d) = 0.3, 1.2, 7.2 μm) to cancel the interference effects in α. The TR measurements were performed with a microscopic spectrophotometer (MSV-5200, Jasco) in ambient air. The samples were annealed before the measurements to stabilize the α-phase.
Powder milled from a SC was sandwiched by glass substrates. The thickness of the pressed powder was 130 ± 30 μm, and α was calculated only from transmittance data, measured by a spectrophotometer (Solidspec-3700, Shimadzu) under a dry air atmosphere.
2.5 Photoluminescence spectroscopy
PL spectrum and time-dependent PL decays were measured with a near-infrared fluorescence lifetime measurement system (C7990, Hamamatsu Photonics) with a YAG laser (532 nm). The measurement was started as soon as possible (within 5 min) after the crystal was picked up from ITC solution and after the crystal surface was rinsed with acetone. The amplitude (A) of the PL transient curve was analyzed by two exponential components: A = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where A1 and A2 represent the amplitudes of the two components, t is the measurement time, and τ1 and τ2 are lifetimes (τ1 < τ2). The time-waveform pulse of laser light was superimposed as the first component. Thus, we compared the carrier lifetime of τ2 as the second component. The sample was stored under a dry air atmosphere for 154 days, and the PL spectra of the aged samples were measured again to determine the influence of sample degradation, before and after annealing treatment at 150 °C for 30 min.
2.6 Photoemission yield spectroscopy in air
We estimated the ionization potentials (IPs) of non-sliced and sliced FAPbI3 SCs with a photoemission yield spectrometer (AC-3, Riken Keiki) in ambient air, where the sliced sample was prepared by mechanically thinning the bulk crystal without lubricant, to prevent surface degradation.
2.7 Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
To specify the position of Fermi energy (EF) in the bandgap, UPS was performed on a small piece cleaved from a SC bulk. The piece of SC was fixed with silver paste onto an ITO/glass substrate, and we identified the EF of FAPbI3 with respect to that of ITO. UPS measurements were conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum system with an electron spectrometer (R3000, Scienta Omicron) and a monochromatic He Iα radiation source.
3. Results and discussion

Temperature dependence of electrical resistance with and without light illumination (AM 1.5) for (b) hole-only and (c) electron-only devices. Black and red marks represent the data under dark conditions and 1 Sun illumination, respectively. Dashed lines represent fitting lines. 

Fig. 1b and c show the temperature (T) dependence of the electrical resistance (R) with and without light illumination for hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively. By fitting the linear region of a current vs. voltage plot, below 0.5 V, we calculated R. From the Arrhenius equation, we estimated the activation energy (Ea). Interestingly, hole-only and electron-only devices showed differences in the temperature dependence of R. In the case of hole-only devices, two types of Ea were obtained: Ea1 = 0.48 eV for the dark condition and Ea2 = 0.17 eV for the illuminated condition. Xing et al. have shown that light illumination enhances ion migration through the surface and grain boundaries based on a comparison of MAPbI3 TFs and SCs.37 The decrease in Ea from 0.48 to 0.17 eV that we observed for the hole-only device under light illumination matches their claim;37 the reduction of Ea under light illumination is due to generation of light-induced defects. The electron-only device showed four different types of Ea: Ea3 = 0.19 eV and Ea4 = 0.40 eV under dark conditions, and Ea5 = 0.10 eV and Ea6 = 0.30 eV under light illumination. Azpiroz et al. predicted activation energies for ionic migration of 0.46 eV for VMA and 0.1 to 0.2 eV for VI in MAPbI3.34 Moreover, Game et al. reported the presence of fast and slow ion migration with activation energies of 0.1 and 0.41 eV for MAPbI3 TF, respectively.43 Hence, the multiple Ea values observed under dark conditions, suggest that Ea3 is derived from the fast migration of VI, and Ea1 and Ea4 can be attributed to the slow migration of VFA. However, in the case of a hole-only device, the low Ea corresponding to Ea3 was not observed in the same temperature range, implying that Ea3 cannot be attributed to the fast migration. In other reports, different Ea values for the migration of VI (0.28 to 0.58 eV)35,38,39 have been suggested, and the averages of these values are close to the Ea1 and Ea4. Additionally, recent reports have revealed that the main ionic carrier is VI (or I− ions).44,45 The migration of slow ions along grain boundaries should be negligible for the SCs in this study, suggesting a low probability of VFA migration. Thus, a more plausible interpretation for the multiple Ea values is the following: Ea1 and Ea4 derive from electro-migration of VI, and Ea3 is derived from the thermal excitation of electrons trapped in deep donor levels, as has been previously reported for MAPbI3.47–50 We have confirmed that the quantity of I atoms in FAPbI3 SC is smaller than the stoichiometric composition, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy/nuclear reaction analysis.62 Recently, it has been theoretically suggested that the formation energy of VI is lower than that of VFA in the case of the I-poor condition,63 in good agreement with our claim. Interestingly, the light-induced decrease of Ea for the electron-only device were 0.09 eV (= Ea3 − Ea5) and 0.10 eV (= Ea4 − Ea6). These values were smaller than the 0.31 eV (= Ea1 − Ea2) for the case of the hole-only device. These results imply that hole conduction rather than electron conduction contributes to the creation of light-induced defects. The coexistence of electronic conduction with Ea3 and ionic conduction with Ea1 may result in a lower value of the Ea4 than Ea1. As a result, the lowest energy of the Ea5 is likely attributed to photo-excited electrons trapped in a shallow donor level rather than contributions from fast ion migration.

Fig. 2a shows the normalized EQE of an Au/FAPbI3 SC/Ga cell, where the dashed line represents literature data from a solar cell based on the FAPbI3 TF.54 The edge of the EQE of the FAPbI3 SC device was shifted to longer wavelengths (>900 nm) than those of the FAPbI3 TF device. This result indicated that the cell based on the FAPbI3 SC can make use of longer-wavelength light. Furthermore, the SC contains a region with a narrower bandgap, as has been reported for MAPbI3 SCs and TFs.14 Because the thickness was greater than the carrier diffusion length (on the order of micrometers),59 photo-excited electrons recombined in the bulk before reaching the Ga electrode, under excitation by short-wavelength light, and thus made no contribution to the photocurrent.

(b) Absorption coefficients of FAPbI3 SCs compared with literature TF data for FAPbI3 (ref. 55 and 56) and MAPbI3 (ref. 12), and Tauc plots (insets), where hν represents photon energy. (c) PL spectra (as-grown sample without annealing treatment, and aged sample before and after annealing treatment), and (d) time-dependent PL decay (as-grown sample without annealing treatment) of the FAPbI3 SC. Numbers near each PL peak represent the wavelength of the maximum intensity. 

Fig. 2b shows the calculated α together with literature data,12,55,56 and Tauc plots.64 The FAPbI3 SC showed a higher α than that of FAPbI3 TF.55,56 In particular, the α of FAPbI3 SC was greater than or equal to that of MAPbI3 TF12 over the measured range of the photon energy. The bandgap Eg1 of the sample with d = 7.2 μm was 1.52 eV (direct), and similar to the previously reported bandgaps of TF.51–56 A powder sample with d = 130 μm showed a bandgap Eg2 of 1.41 eV, corresponding to the literature values for the SCs.57–60 The difference in Eg2, estimated from the (αhν)2vs. hν and (αhν)1/2vs. hν plots, was quite small (approximately 0.005 eV). Thus, it is difficult to determine whether Eg2 arises from a direct or indirect transition.
In Fig. 2c, we show the PL spectra of a non-sliced FAPbI3 SC, where the most characteristic PL spectra were selected from a sample aged for 154 days. The PL spectrum of the as-grown sample can be perfectly fitted by three (rather than two) Gaussian curves: EPL1 = 1.55 eV (peak position of 801 nm), EPL2 = 1.43 eV (870 nm), and EPL3 = 1.39 eV (894 nm), respectively. The PL peak positions of the aged sample shifted to longer wavelengths than those of the as-grown sample. Although the PL spectrum of the aged sample before the annealing treatment showed a large PL peak at ∼820 nm, its intensity decreased after the annealing treatment. After the annealing treatment of the aged sample, the PL peak positions did not return to the initial positions of the as-grown sample. The values of EPL1 and EPL2 were very close to the values of Eg1 and Eg2 estimated from the α data. These data indicated the existence of multiple bandgaps, but differed from literature reports of single PL peaks at approximately 812,60 815,46 820,56 and 843 nm46,59 for FAPbI3 SCs. These reported wavelengths were close to the ca. 80351 and 805 nm58 measured for FAPbI3 TFs. In Fig. 2d, we show time-dependent PL decays of the as-grown sample, which were monitored at 799 and 871 nm, corresponding to EPL1 and EPL2, respectively. The carrier lifetime (τ2) of 38.6 ns at 871 nm was longer than that of 26.6 ns at 799 nm.

Fig. 3a shows the PYSA results of the non-sliced and sliced FAPbI3 SCs and a FAPbI3 TF. The estimated IP values of the non-sliced and sliced crystals were 5.53 and 5.61 eV, respectively. The IP of the non-sliced crystal was almost the same as that of a solution-processed FAPbI3 TF (5.52 eV), while the IP of the sliced crystal was close to the literature value of the FAPbI3 SC (5.63 eV).59 From this measurement, we deduce that the non-sliced crystal was affected by surface degradation and the surface became TF-like, because the PYSA signal is sensitive to the surface state of the sample. The IP of the sliced sample was distinctly different from that of the non-sliced sample, and likely reflected the bulk state without surface degradation.
 Fig. 3  (a) PYSA data of non-sliced and sliced FAPbI3 SCs and TF, and (b) UPS spectra of cleaved FAPbI3 SC and MAPbI3 TF. (c) Energy level diagram of the FAPbI3 single crystal evaluated in this study. ESD and EDD represent the shallow and deep donor levels, respectively. 
We show the results of UPS in Fig. 3b. From a semi-log plot, we estimated EF − EVBM = 1.18 eV for FAPbI3 SC and 1.24 eV for MAPbI3 TF, where EVBM is the energy of the valence band maximum (VBM). The EF was close to the conduction band minimum (CBM), as has been reported for MAPbI3 TFs.9–11 Interestingly, for the FAPbI3 SC, EF − EVBM + Ea3 = 1.37 eV, a value which is close to Eg2 (1.41 eV) and EPL2 (1.43 eV), supporting the fact that the Ea3 was caused by thermal excitation of electrons in a deep donor level. One hypotheses for the deep defect levels is the formation of Pb dimers, where the defect state of the Pb dimer is located below 0.38 eV from the CBM in the case of MAPbI3,47 which is consistent with the value of 2 × Ea3. These results imply that the position of EF is derived from the existence of donor levels. Inferring from simulations in the literature,47 deep defect levels may have formed through cooling processes in the sample preparation.
On the basis of the above-mentioned data, we discuss the reasons for the multiple transitions and the bandgap narrowing. In general, carriers trapped in impurity levels derived from surface defects, have a narrow spectral photo-response. However, the PL intensity at EPL2 recovered after the annealing treatment, as shown in Fig. 2c. Moreover, a longer τ2 was observed at a longer wavelength as shown in Fig. 2d, indicating that the PL response of EPL2 did not derive from surface defects. Multiple interference should not occur in this study, because we used thick SCs, of the order of millimetres, for the PL measurements, rather than TFs. Quantum size effects become noticeable for a sample thickness of the order of several tens of nm and at low temperatures. However, the sample size was much larger than the exciton Bohr radii (∼nm), and this effect would cause a blue shift of the emission wavelength. Thus, in the case of thick SCs, quantum size effects cannot be responsible for the multiple narrow bands. Note that self-absorption effects occur near the absorption edge, which explains the low PL intensity for the thick sample. The PL response of EPL3 near the absorption edge is attributed to the self-absorption of other PL responses. With respect to lattice deformation, PL peaks in the surface and bulk regions have been reported for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 SCs based on one- and two-photon induced PL.16 The surface region showed a wider bandgap and shorter lifetime than those of the bulk region, as has been previously reported.16,17,20 Multiple PL peaks should be observed when the surface and bulk regions have different characteristics. As mentioned in the introduction, it has been reported that the Rashba effect gives rise to spin–orbital splitting of the band structure.24–30 The spin features of Rashba-splitting of the VB and CB are opposite, thus direct band-to-band recombination is forbidden, and indirect recombination is mainly allowed, resulting in longer lifetimes. The bandgap should decrease by the value of the sum ΔE of the Rashba energies for the VB and CB. Recently, an ΔE value of approximately 0.15 eV was theoretically estimated for FAPbI3,30 and this value is close to the energy difference between EPL1 and EPL2 (0.12 eV). Thus, an explanation based on the Rashba effect is consistent with the PL data in this study. The PL peak with EPL2 was derived from an indirect transition. The corrected Eg2 was 1.40 eV (indirect). Moreover, the EQE measurements in Fig. 2a revealed that photo-excited carriers contributed to the photo current in the region >900 nm. These data indicate that multiple PL peaks and bandgap narrowing originated from lattice deformation and the Rashba effect, namely, the degraded surface and the Rashba-splitting of the bulk of the SC, in addition to self-absorption. In summary, the EPL1 (1.55 eV), which had characteristics similar to those of a TF with a direct bandgap, indicates that the SC contains a TF-like region near the sample surface. The EPL2 (1.43 eV) is likely to be caused by a transition between indirect bands with a longer lifetime caused by Rashba splitting. The EPL3 (1.39 eV) can be attributed to self-absorption with the lowest PL intensity near the absorption edge.
Finally, the energy level diagrams of the surface and bulk regions are summarized in Fig. 3c. Our research shows that there may also be a relationship between the formation of double charged surface layers46 and surface degradation. In the figure, there remains uncertainty about the shallow acceptor level, although this may be further elucidated by I–V measurements at low temperature.
4. Conclusions
FAPbI3 SC made by an ITC method showed high α (>104 cm−1), indicating the highly-crystalline FAPbI3 has potential as a photoabsorption layer in solar cells. Analyses of temperature- dependent R, with and without light illumination using hole- and electron-only devices, indicated that the origins of multiple activation energies can be interpreted as the migration of VI (0.40 and 0.48 eV) and the thermal excitation of electrons from donor levels (0.10 and 0.19 eV). Moreover, the analysis of UPS showed that EF − EVBM = 1.18 eV, resulting in n-type semiconductor characteristics. The light-induced decrease in Ea implies the possibility of light-induced defect creation. The PL spectrum showed multiple bandgaps (1.55, 1.43, and 1.39 eV), and the excitation at longer wavelengths showed longer lifetimes. The PL peak at a long wavelength with a long lifetime indicates the existence of an indirect bandgap. The Rashba splitting in the bulk and self-absorption effects can consistently explain the origins of the two narrow bandgaps. The degraded surface region featured a wider bandgap and smaller IP than those of the bulk region. Therefore, the band offset caused by the surface will reduce the solar cell performance. Further investigations are necessary to make the best potential use of SC materials in device applications.
