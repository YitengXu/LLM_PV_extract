1. Introduction

Polymer solar cells have attracted a great concern for fabricating low-cost large-area mechanically flexible photovoltaic devices compared to the conventional inorganic counterparts.1–5 The state-of-the art polymer solar cell is based on donor–acceptor bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), consisting of the electron accepting network formed randomly within the polymer matrix.6–8 A recent advance for achieving a high photovoltaic efficiency in excess of 7% has been realized.9 Although numerous combinations of donors and acceptors have been reported,1–5 the most popular BHJ polymer solar cells consist of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends with power conversion efficiencies 4–5%.1,3 In addition, the most commonly used transparent and conducting hole collecting electrode in polymer solar cells is indium tin oxide (ITO). A thin and planar layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is usually coated on top of ITO and serves to minimize the detrimental effects of ITO roughness as well as to align the work function. Although such a device design has achieved a very promising power conversion efficiency, there still exist several fundamental issues to be overcome by using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS as an anode electrode in the future market integration of low-cost plastic solar cells. For example, the price of ITO has increased by an order of magnitude over the last decade due to an increase in demand for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and the scarcity of In. The lack of mechanical flexibility of ITO limits its application in the plastic organic electronics. Moreover, the interface between ITO and PEDOT:PSS is not stable since PEDOT:PSS is usually deposited from highly acidic (pH ∼1) aqueous suspensions that are known to corrode ITO at elevated temperatures.10,11 Several alternatives to ITO and PEDOT:PSS have been pursued and reported. For example, other transparent conducting oxide,12 conducting polymer,13,14 single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)15–22 and graphene films23 have been demonstrated to replace ITO as a transparent conducting electrode. Transition metal oxides such as V2O5, MoO324 and NiO25 deposited by vacuum techniques were also found to effectively substitute PEDOT:PSS as the buffer layer in the polymer solar cells. Nevertheless, the main advantage of polymer solar cells is that devices can be fabricated at room temperature over large areas using solution processing or transfer printing onto substrates. It would be of great potential to develop fully solution-processable fabrications of polymer solar cells for deposition of both electrodes and photoactive layers. In this article, we would like to demonstrate an architecture of polymer solar cells based on allotropes of nanocarbon materials, consisting of a transparent conducting electrode using one-dimensional (1D) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), a hole transporting interfacial layer using two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) and the zero-dimension (0D) fullerene derivative PCBM/P3HT bulk heterojunctions as a photoactive layer. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the nanocarbon based polymer photovoltaic device is shown in Fig. 1. The advantage of this polymer photovoltaic device structure is that it can be fabricated fully compatible with solution processed printable electronics based on the nanocarbon platform.

2. Results and discussion
It has been demonstrated that solution processed SWNT thin films can be alternative transparent and conducting electrodes15–22 for photovoltaic devices due to their high transparency over much of the solar spectrum, excellent electrical conductivity, and the potential for inexpensive roll-to-roll processing. The SWNTs from dispersed suspensions were deposited on glass substrates by vacuum filtration as reported previously.15,17 These devices were then soaked in HNO3 to further reduce the sheet resistance by removing the residual surfactant and also introducing carboxyl groups on the SWNTs to give a p-type doping.17,21Fig. 2(a) plots the transmittance at 550 nm of SWNT thin films as a function of their resistance before and after nitric acid treatment. A sheet resistance value as low as 100 Ω □−1 can be obtained at a transmittance of ∼80% for the SWNT electrode after treatment. Graphene oxide (GO) is a graphene sheet functionalized with oxygen functional groups in the form of epoxy and hydroxyl groups attached on the basal plane or decorated at the edges.26–28 GO thus contains a large fraction of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms bound to oxygen which makes it an insulator (sheet resistance ∼109 Ω □−1) with a large band gap.29 Recently, the incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) deposited from neutral solution was found to be a good candidate of an anode interfacial layer.30Fig. 2(b) shows the atomic force microscope (AFM) morphology image of a GO sheet deposited from aqueous solution. The lateral dimensions of GO flakes are ranged from 1–5 μm and the height was measured to be about 1 nm, which corresponds to an atom-layer thickness of a single GO sheet.31 GO thin films with different thicknesses were then deposited on top of the nitric-acid treated SWNT electrodes by spin coating to act as an anode interfacial layer. By controlling the number of spin coatings, we are able to obtain GO layers with different thicknesses. Fig. 2(c) shows the dependence of the GO thin film thickness as a function of different numbers of layers on atomically flat silicon substrate. The average thickness of each layer of GO thin films is found to be slightly larger than that of an individual GO flake as shown in Fig. 2(b) due to possible stacking between different GO flakes in the thin films by spin coating.

The topography and local work function mapping images of the SWNT electrodes without and with different layers of GO thin films were further revealed by AFM, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(f).

The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the pristine SWNT electrode before depositing the GO thin films is about 5.77 nm while several spots with a height larger than 40 nm can be clearly seen (Fig. 3(a)). A decreasing roughness of the SWNT electrodes after depositing the GO thin layers is clearly observed. The rms roughnesses for the SWNT electrodes with one layer and three layers of GO thin films are 4.20 nm and 3.94 nm respectively. Since the morphology of a membrane-transferred SWNT electrode usually displays a nonuniform height distribution due to its porosity, the protrusion of SWNTs into the active layer can possibly result in the shorting of the device and a low shunt resistance.32 The deposition of GO thin films can not only act as an anode interfacial layer but also assist the planarization of the SWNT electrodes. The average work function values of the SWNT/GO anode measured by SKPM are found to slightly decrease from 5.09 eV for the SWNT electrode to 5.08 and 5.05 eV after depositing one and three layers of GO thin films respectively. Since GO is very insulating with a wide band gap, we have further employed a Riken Keiki AC-2 photoelectron emission and Tauc plot33 measurements to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of GO respectively as shown in Fig. 4(a). The HOMO level of GO is 5.2 eV which is only ∼0.2 eV below the HOMO level of P3HT lying at 5.0 eV. In contrast, the large band gap of GO of ∼3.6 eV hinders the possibility for electrons from the LUMO levels of P3HT or PCBM to be collected at the SWNT anode. The relevant energetics of each component in the nanocarbon based polymer solar cell device are shown in Fig. 4(b).

Next, we have fabricated the photovoltaic devices by spin coating the photoactive layer of P3HT:PCBM hybrids on top of the SWNT/GO anode electrode with a thickness of about 160 nm. The Al electrode was then deposited onto the active layer by thermal evaporation. In this study, we have not utilized the LiF layer below the Al cathode to simplify the device structure. The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells based on the SWNT/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al device structure with different thicknesses of GO interfacial layers are shown in Fig. 5(a). Firstly, the device consisting of no GO interfacial layer with a structure of SWNT/P3HT:PCBM/Al exhibits a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 8.45 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.48 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.42, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.67% respectively under A.M.1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination. After depositing one layer of GO thin film on top of the SWNT electrode, a large improvement in the photovoltaic performance of the SWNT/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al device can be obtained, exhibiting a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, an Voc of 0.57 V and a FF of 0.53, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.11%. Further increase in the layer thickness of GO thin films results in a clear trend of decreasing power conversion efficiencies of lower Jsc and FFs with increased serial resistance and decreased shunt resistance. To examine whether the resistivity of GO is the key factor to affect the power conversion efficiencies, we have further optimized the device performances of the SWNT/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al solar cells by using more conductive reduced GO thin films to replace the original insulating GO layers. It has been reported that the insulating GO can be transferred to more graphene-like reduced GO (r-GO) through exposure to hydrazine vapor and/or annealing in inert conditions to render the material electrically conductivity.29 The sheet resistance can be largely lowered from 1 × 109 Ω □−1 for the pristine GO to 5 × 104, 6 × 103 and 1 × 103 Ω □−1 for the reduced GO thin films by exposure to hydrazine vapor for 3 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours respectively. Fig. 5(b) exhibits the photovoltaic performances of devices using one layer of reduced GO thin films as an anode interfacial layer with different hydrazine exposure times. All these devices consisting of reduced GO thin films show significant decreasing cell efficiencies of lower Jsc, Voc and FF, accompanied with a large enhancement of leakage current. Table 1 summarizes all the device performances of the solar cells based on the SWNT/GO (or r-GO) anodes with different configurations. For comparison, we have also fabricated a control device using the conventional polymer solar cell of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al under the same fabrication conditions, which exhibits a photovoltaic performance of a Jsc of 11.0 mA cm−2, an Voc of 0.57 V, a FF of 0.57, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.57%.

From the above result, it is concluded that the device consisting of the thinnest insulating GO interfacial layer gives the best performance of a SWNT/GO/P3HT:PCBM/Al solar cell. To further examine the origin of transporting mechanism of the GO interfacial layer, we have employed the conductive-AFM (C-AFM) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements to probe the transport and recombination behaviors of the nanocarbon based polymer solar cells. The details of the TPV measurement have been described elsewhere.5Fig. 5(c) shows the local current–voltage characteristics of the devices consisting of one, three and six layers of GO thin films onto the SWNT electrodes. It is found that the conductive current becomes largely suppressed from 2 nA to 0.06 nA at a bias of −3 V as the thickness of the GO thin films increases from one to six layers. The thin insulating GO layer in the nanocarbon based polymer solar cell therefore acts as a tunneling barrier which favors holes to transport through and blocks electrons effectively, as compared to the energy level diagram in Fig. 4(b). The transporting of holes in GO is very different from that in PEDOT:PSS which is very conductive and is contrast to the NiO interfacial layer where transfer of holes to the anode electrode is facilitated by injection into Ni2+ defect levels close to the valence band.25 The tunneling probability of holes from P3HT becomes largely reduced while the thickness of the GO layer is increased, although electrons can be effectively blocked. The electron–hole back recombination rate is increased with GO thickness as a result of a decreasing recombination time of 13.7, 12.5, and 8.9 μs for the devices consisting of one, three and six layers of GO respectively as shown in Fig. 5(d), consistent with increased serial resistance and decreased shunt resistance. When the conductivity of GO is increased by increasing the concentration of sp2 fractions through reduction, both electrons and holes can transport along these more conductive sp2 sites via delocalized π electrons29 toward the SWNT anode. As a result, holes and electrons can be easily recombined at the SWNT anode with a shorter recombination time of 6.7 μs, giving a large leakage current and a low shunt resistance.
3. Experimental
Preparation of SWNT transparent electrodes
Raw SWNTs purchased from Unidym, Inc. were purified by reiterative low temperature oxidative annealing and acid treatment.34 Aqueous solutions of 1 wt% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used to disperse SWNTs at the concentration of 0.04 mg ml−1. The SWNT thin film was then deposited on glass using the vacuum filtration and transfer method as reported by Wu et al.15 Here, we especially used the membrane with 25 nm pore size to obtain smooth and uniform SWNT thin films. Further functionalization was carried out by soaking samples in HNO3 (16 M) for 1 h, air drying after removing from the acid bath, and followed by rinsing with DI water as well as drying with gentle nitrogen flow.
Preparation of graphene oxide (GO) interfacial layers
GO was obtained from purified natural graphite powder (SP-1, Bay Carbon) using the modified Hummers method.35 A concentration of 2 mg ml−1 in DI water was prepared for deposition of GO thin films. The GO solution was spin coated onto SWNT thin films at the speed of 2000 rpm for 1 layer. To obtain r-GO with different extent of reduction, the samples with 1 layer of GO were exposed to hydrazine vapor at room temperature for 3 min, 1 h, and 4 h respectively.
Device fabrications
For the fabrication of OPV devices (area = 0.1 cm2), the GO thin films were moved into a nitrogen-purged glove box for deposition of the photoactive layers and top electrodes. The photoactive layers were deposited on top of the GO (or r-GO) thin films by spin coating using a 1:0.8 weight ratio blend of P3HT:PCBM dissolved in chlorobenzene. The film thickness of the photoactive layer was about 160 nm. Al cathodes were then deposited onto the blend layers by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 4 × 10−6 Torr. After deposition of Al cathodes, all devices were thermally annealed at 150 °C for 5 minutes in the nitrogen glove box.
Measurements and characterizations

UV-Visible
absorption spectra were obtained using a Jasco V-570 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer. Current–voltage characteristics (Keithley 2410 source meter) were obtained by using a solar simulator (Newport Inc.) with the A.M.1.5 filter under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The workfunction values were measured by a scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) and the local current–voltage characteristics were probed by using the conductive AFM measurement module (Innova, Vecco Inc.). For all the measurements, Pt/Ir coated cantilevers were used. For the transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measurement, the devices were measured at an open circuit condition under illumination from the solar simulator with adjustable intensities. A small perturbation generated by a pulsed laser of a frequency-double Nd:YAG pulsed laser (λ = 532 nm, repetition rate 10 Hz, duration ∼5 ns) is used. The transient decay signals were recorded by a digital oscilloscope (Tetronix TDS5052B). The samples were mounted in a vacuum chamber under 10−3 Torr during measurement.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated nanocarbon based polymer solar cells which consist of the SWNT transparent electrode and GO interfacial buffer layer and polymer/fullerene hybrid photoactive layer. The fully solution processable SWNT/GO anode can be a good candidate to replace the traditional transparent conducting electrode ITO and the interfacial anode layer PEDOT:PSS, providing a new route to develop low-cost, large area and flexible organic photovoltaic devices. Further optimization of the SWNT/GO anode via the enhanced conductivity and transparency of the SWNT electrode or improved uniformity of the SWNT/GO interface should lead to additional improvements in the device performance.

Broader context
The main advantage of polymer solar cells is that devices can be fabricated at room temperature over large areas using solution processing or transfer printing onto substrates. It would be of great potential to develop fully solution-processable fabrications of polymer solar cells for deposition of both electrodes and photoactive layers. In this article, we would like to demonstrate an architecture of polymer solar cells based on allotropes of nanocarbon materials, consisting of a transparent conducting electrode using one-dimensional (1D) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), a hole transporting interfacial layer using two-dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) and the zero-dimension (0D) fullerene derivative PCBM/P3HT bulk heterojunctions as a photoactive layer. The advantage of this polymer photovoltaic device structure is that it can be fabricated fully compatible with solution processed printable electronics based on the nanocarbon platform.
