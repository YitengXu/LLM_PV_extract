    , Accepted 10th March 2014First published on 11th March 2014AbstractHighly ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with well-connected frameworks was applied in mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells as counter electrode. The OMC were synthesized by a template method and mixed with flaky graphite to prepare the carbon paste, which was used to fabricate the counter electrode by screen-printing technology. The OMC based solar cell presented a fill factor (FF) of 0.63 and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.02%, which was a remarkable improvement compared with the carbon black based device. The electrochemical impedance spectrum measurement demonstrated that the uniform mesopores and interconnected structures in the carbon counter electrode promoted the decrease of charge transfer resistance at the interface and thereby the higher FF and η was obtained.
Introduction
Inorganic–organic heterojunction mesoscopic solar cells have attracted widespread attention recently for their high efficiency and low-cost fabrication.1,2 Power conversion efficiency (η) over 15% has been achieved by many groups, which promise high potential to replace commercialized solar cells made from silicon, CIGS or CdTe.3,4 Normally, these inorganic–organic heterojunction mesoscopic solar cells are usually composed of a nanocrystalline metal dioxide as the photoanode, an organometal halide perovskite as the light absorber, a p-type material as hole transport material (HTM) and a noble metal film as the counter electrode (CE). Several HTM materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT and PTAA,5–7 have been used to study the effect on the photovoltaic performance. Dramatically, Grätzel and co-workers reported a “HTM-free” mesoscopic methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells, where the perovskite acts the role of both light harvester and HTM.8 Obviously, this improved design would promise lower cost due to avoiding the use of HTM, which is not only very expensive but also poses a serious predicament for pore filling problem and the long term stability of the device. So far, the high η of 8% has been reported for ‘HTM-free’ perovskite solar cell,9 where a vapor deposited gold film is used as CE. This noble metal CE would still definitely hinder the industrialization of this kind of solar cell, which is extremely urgent to be replaced by low-cost material at present.
As an alternative, carbon CEs have been widely studied on solar cells due to their low-cost and screen printable deposition technique. Several varieties of carbon materials, such as carbon nanotube, active carbon, carbon black, fullerene, graphite and graphene, showed surprising performance compared with noble metal electrode.10–14 Recently, our group has successfully applied carbon black/spheroidal graphite CE to the mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells, which presented a considerable efficiency and high stability.15 This result boosted our confidence to develop more available carbon-based electrodes.
The ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has been employed as a potentially effective electrode for electrochemistry applications, as it possesses high surface area, regular and tunable pore sizes, stable frameworks and physicochemical properties.16–20 In 2005, Zhao’s group reported highly ordered carbon frameworks C-FDU-15 and C-FDU-16 consisting of uniform mesopores prepared by a solvent evaporation induced self-assembly method, which is commercially available for its nontoxic, low-cost and simple fabrication process.21 These mesopores and interconnected structures will favor the penetration of perovskite precursors and provide effective contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon film. However, these OMC usually behave more as insulators, which cannot meet the demand of high lateral conductivity for monolithic devices.
Herein, we prepared the carbon pastes mixed the OMC and graphite and applied them to perovskite based heterojunction mesoporous solar cells as CE. Compared with commonly used carbon black, this OMC electrode possessing highly ordered uniform mesopores and interconnected structures exhibited lower charge resistance at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface, which was confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Thus, the higher fill factor (FF) of 0.63, and thereby higher efficiencies of 7.02% were obtained for OMC based solar cells.
Results and discussion
The two types of OMC were prepared by evaporation induced self-assembly strategy with low-molecular weight phenolic resin as carbon precursors and triblock copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO-PPO-PEO, pluronic 127) as templates, followed by the carbonization process at 900 °C. Fig. 1a and b represent the mesostructures of the assembled framework C-FDU-15 and C-FDU-16, which can be controlled by varying the mass ratio of F127 and phenolic resin.

Fig. 1c shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of C-FDU-15 view from (110) direction. The well-ordered 2D hexagonal (P6mm) arrays of mesopores with 1D mesochannels can be observed in the whole domain. The C-FDU-16 TEM image viewed in the (110) direction is shown in Fig. 1d, suggesting a 3D cubic (Imm) mesostructure. Both of the two kinds of OMC present highly ordered uniform mesopores and well-connected frameworks, which would favor the diffusion of perovskite precursors and provide effective contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and CE.
The small-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of OMCs are shown in Fig. 2. Both of the samples exhibit strong peaks at 2θ range of 1 to 1.5°, which are assigned to (10) diffraction of C-FDU-15 and (110) diffraction of C-FDU-16, respectively. The other weak peaks can be observed at the 2θ range of 1.5 to 2.5°. The d-spacing value of (10) and (110) diffraction peak for C-FDU-15 and C-FDU-16 are calculated to be 7.61 nm and 7.89 nm, which correspond to the unit-cell parameters (a0 = 8.79 nm for C-FDU-15, a0 = 11.15 nm for C-FDU-16). This result is consistent with the view of TEM, further confirming the highly ordered mesostructures of 2D hexagonal symmetry (space group of P6mm) and 3D cubic symmetry (space group of Imm) exhibited in Fig. 1a and b.
It is mentioned above that the pure OMC films usually present poor electrical conductivity for monolithic solar cells. In our case a 5 μm thick OMC film presents the square resistance over 106 Ω per square. Therefore, we prepared carbon pastes for screen-printing process by mixing OMC and conductive flaky graphite at the mass ratio of 1:2 in a terpineol solution. Both of the components could play their respective advantages in this kind of mixture electrode, which has been proved in previous literature.22,23 The OMC will increase the surface area and offer more contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon while graphite provides high lateral conductivity for monolithic devices. Four-point probe measurement indicates that the square resistances (Rsr) of the three carbon films, the C-FDU-15/graphite electrode (OG-15), C-FDU-16/graphite electrode (OG-16) and carbon black/graphite electrode (CG), exhibit close resistance (see Table 1), which are due to the same ratio of graphite. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of OG-15, OG-16 and CG, which were deposited on glass substrates by screen-printing technology. It can be found that the OMC presents flake-like morphology due to the self-assembly process. The accumulation of the flaky OMC and flaky graphite may form large spaces to facilitate the rapid penetration of perovskite precursors. However, the BET analysis shows that the OMC-based electrodes possess a little higher surface area than CG. As shown in Table 1, OG-15 and OG-16 represent a value of 244.5 m2 g−1 and 178.3 m2 g−1, respectively. Indeed, both of them are higher than 167.7 m2 g−1 of CG. Enough relative surface area is necessary to provide effective contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon film. Obviously, the increase in surface area would also be beneficial for hole injection efficiency, leading to a lower charge transfer resistance (RCT).

The schematic structure of mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell with carbon CE is shown in Fig. 4, which has been reported in our previous work.15 Fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass plates with high transparency in the visible range were purchased from CSG Holding Co. LTD. The fabricating processes are described briefly as follows: FTO glass substrates were etched with a laser before being cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, deionized water and ethanol, followed by depositing a compact TiO2 layer onto the patterned substrate by spray pyrolysis. Then, mesoscopic TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon electrode were screen-printed layer by layer with sintering process. After that, CH3NH3PbI3 precursor (CH3NH3I and PbI2 at 1:1 molar ratio) was dipped on the top of the carbon layer and the devices were dried at 50 °C on a hot plate under dark conditions. The color of coated devices transferred from light yellow to dark brown, indicating the accomplishment of the solar cell. In this structure, the perovskite used for light collection is about 1 to 2 μm in TiO2 and ZrO2 because of its high light absorption ability and short carrier diffusion length.24,25 The perovskite filled in the carbon electrode plays the role of HTM, which will transport and inject holes to CE. The quantity of perovskite filled in the carbon CE was controlled by the volume of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor dipped onto the carbon film and drying temperature.

The photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of mesoscopic solar cells based on the OG-15, OG-16 and CG based CE are shown in Fig. 5, and their characteristic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Under one sun illumination of AM1.5, the OG-15 and OG-16 based devices present the η of 7.02% and 6.30% whereas the device based on CG CE exhibits 5.17%. Interestingly, these three samples demonstrate very close value of 839 to 846 mV in the open-circuit voltage (Voc), while slightly higher short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 13.23 mA cm−2 for OG-15 based devices than 12.58 mA cm−2 for OG16 and 12.27 mA cm−2 for CG versions. Evidently, the improvement in η of devices using OMC based electrode is mainly due to the increase in FF, which increases by 20% for OG-16 and 26% for OG-15 compared with FF of 0.55 for CG. This remarkable improvement could be attributed to not only the larger surface area of OMC but also previously observed uniform mesopores within interconnected mesostructures.

To further confirm the influence of OMC electrode on the performance of mesoscopic solar cells, we carried out the measurement using EIS in the frequency range 100 mHz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude under dark conditions. Fig. 6 depicts the Nyquist plots of solar cells fabricated with different kinds of CEs at a forward bias of 800 mV. The EIS transmission-line model of mesoscopic solar cells based on the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 have been investigated by some groups.26,27 There are two RC elements and a negative capacitance of each device can be found in the Nyquist plot. The RC response in the high frequency region is assigned to the charge exchange process at the perovskite/CE interface while the one at low frequencies represents the TiO2/perovskite interface. The negative capacitance appears in the low frequency region corresponding to an additional recombination pathway at high forward bias at one of the interfaces. Here in this case the semicircle in the high frequency range associates with the surface morphological properties of the porous electrode. In the Nyquist plot of Fig. 6, it's obvious to see that the radius of the semicircle in the high frequency decreases when replacing the carbon black with OMC, which indicates lower RCT of OMC at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface. We attribute this result to ordered uniform mesopores and well-connected framework in the OMC electrode. Interestingly, the OG-15 based device shows smaller radius of the first semicircle than OG-16. Besides the larger surface area of OG-15 compared to OG-16, C-FDU-15 consisting of 1D channel structures might also contribute to the better contact and lower RCT at the interface. It should be noted that the formation of these mesopore channels will help to meet the needs of rapid transport of perovskite precursors for better pore filling. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the lower RCT promotes the higher FF of OMC-based devices, which are in accordance with the photovoltaic characterization.

Conclusions
Highly ordered mesoporous carbon was applied in the CE of mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell. C-FDU-15 and C-FDU-16 were synthesized by a templating method and mixed with flaky graphite to prepare the carbon paste. The interconnected mesotructures with uniform mesopores successfully decreased the RCT at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface, which had been demonstrated by EIS analysis. Consequently, the OMC based device achieved high η of 7.02% whereas the referential device exhibited η of 5.17%. Moreover, the 1D channel structures in C-FDU-15 might also contribute to the transport of perovskite precursors for better pore filling hence exhibiting better contact and lower RCT. Further investigation will focus on tuning the pore size of OMC to control the morphology of perovskite.
