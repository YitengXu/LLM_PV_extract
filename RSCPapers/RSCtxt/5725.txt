    , Accepted 4th August 2017First published on 4th August 2017AbstractDespite the substantial progress in the development of two-dimensional (2D) materials from conventional layered crystals, it still remains particularly challenging to produce high-quality 2D non-layered semiconductor alloys which may bring in some unique properties and new functions. In this work, the synthesis of well-oriented 2D non-layered CdSxSe(1−x) semiconductor alloy flakes with tunable compositions and optical properties is established. Structural analysis reveals that the 2D non-layered alloys follow an incommensurate van der Waals epitaxial growth pattern. Photoluminescence measurements show that the 2D alloys have composition-dependent direct bandgaps with the emission peak varying from 1.8 eV to 2.3 eV, coinciding well with the density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, photodetectors based on the CdSxSe(1−x) flakes exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 703 A W−1 with an external quantum efficiency of 1.94 × 103 and a response time of 39 ms. Flexible devices fabricated on a thin mica substrate display good mechanical stability upon repeated bending. This work suggests a facile and general method to produce high-quality 2D non-layered semiconductor alloys for next-generation optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a huge family of hundreds of members with different electrical characteristics including metallic, semiconducting, insulating and charge density wave behaviors.1–4 Particularly, semiconducting 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their extraordinary properties such as thickness-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, piezoelectricity and valley Hall effect.5–8 Additionally, in contrast to three-dimensional (3D) bulk crystals, 2D TMDs possess better processability and larger mechanical stretchability. These advantages greatly facilitate integration of the 2D TMDs with a traditional silicon substrate, even flexible ones such as a plastic film and mica sheet, which make it possible for realizing ultrathin, lightweight and flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.9–11
However, beyond 2D layered materials, 2D non-layer crystals may also provide important access to new properties and novel functional devices unachievable using their counterparts in other dimensionalities. For example, Aerts et al. synthesized ultrathin PbS nanosheets and found that they show a higher carrier multiplication efficiency over the bulk materials, enabling almost all photon energy in excess of the carrier multiplication threshold to virtually completely convert into additional e–h pairs.12 Wang et al. reported that 2D Pb1−xSnxSe nanoplates possess a broad and sensitive infrared photoresponse because of the narrow direct bandgap and large light absorption coefficient.13 Additionally, Li's group demonstrated that the monolayer Rh nanosheets are an excellent catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions owing to the 100% ratio of the Rh atoms on the Rh nanosheet surface.14 In this regard, synthesis of high-quality 2D non-layered materials with highly controlled dimensions and adjustable chemical compositions is in high demand.
In this work, a facile one-pot van der Waals (VDWs) epitaxial growth of 2D non-layered semiconductor alloys of CdSxSe(1−x) with tunable composition and optical properties is successfully demonstrated. Structural characterization based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates the high crystallinity of the as-achieved 2D alloy flakes with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that the CdSxSe(1−x) possesses tunable near band edge emission varying from 1.8 to 2.3 eV, matching well with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, photodetectors made of the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes exhibit an excellent photoresponse, making the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) a highly qualified candidate for next-generation photodetectors.
Experimental section
Synthesis of 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys
2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys were prepared using an atmospheric pressure vapor deposition method, as reported in our previous work.15 In a typical growth process, a few newly cleaved fluorophlogopite mica sheets were used as the substrates downstream of the heating zone center with a distance around 10–20 cm. 80 mg CdCl2 powder loaded in a ceramic boat was placed at the heating zone center. 500 mg mixed powder of S and Se was placed upstream of the heating zone center with a distance of about 20 cm and the molar ratio of S and Se was set as 1:10–10:1. High-purity Ar with a flow of 10 sccm was used as the carrier gas during synthesis. Next, the heating zone center was heated to 800 °C with a rate of 20 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 10 minutes. After growth, the temperature was allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature.
Characterization
Morphology of the as-grown samples was characterized using a Hitachi S4800 field-emission microscope and a Nikon inverted optical microscope Eclipse Ti-U with a CCD. Thickness information was obtained using a Bruker Mutimode 8 atomic force microscope. The XRD pattern was recorded using a Bruker D8 Focus powder X-ray diffractometer. The microstructure and composition were investigated via a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope and an Oxford energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope. Room-temperature PL spectra and PL maps were collected using a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope with a 442 nm laser. For low-temperature PL measurements, a Linkam THMS 600 heating and freezing stage was adopted to control the temperature.
Theoretical calculations
The energy band structure was obtained based on density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the CASTEP module of Material Studio. The calculations were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism for a combination of exchange and correlation function. The cut-off energy is set as 400 eV, and a density of (3 × 3 × 4) Monkhorst–Pack k-point was used to sample the Brillouin zone. The self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance was 1 × 10−6 eV. The core electrons were replaced with ultra-soft pseudo-potentials.
Device fabrication and measurements
Photodetectors based on 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes were in situ fabricated on the mica substrate. A copper grid shadow mask with a gap of 6 μm was covered on the surface of the mica substrate, followed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm In and 100 nm Au. In order to reduce the resistance, the devices were annealed at 120 °C under a flowing Ar atmosphere for 2 h. Subsequently, a Lakeshore probe station and a Keithley-4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyser were used for photoresponse measurements. A 450 nm laser diode and a 532 nm laser diode were used as the illuminated light source and the intensity of the incident beam was adjusted using a laser attenuator.
Results and discussion
Herein, epitaxial growth of 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys was carried out in a simple atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) system, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Specifically, CdCl2 powder and a mixture of S and Se powders were utilized as the precursors for the synthesis of 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys. A newly cleaved layered fluorophlogopite mica sheet was adopted as the receiving substrate. By heating the source powders to high temperature, products with different colors covering the surface of the substrate can be obtained, as displayed in the insets of Fig. S1.† Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization in Fig. 1b exhibits that the products are mainly isolated domains with a hexagonal shape (Fig. 1c). The side length and thickness of these hexagonal crystallites are measured and found to be about several microns and 76 nm (Fig. 1d), respectively. A careful examination of Fig. 1b reveals that the majority of the hexagonal flake edges are oriented along well-defined directions, predominantly at multiples of ∼60°, confirmed by the orientation histogram presented in Fig. 1e and the corresponding optical image is shown in Fig. S1a.† Interestingly, such a phenomenon can also be found in other samples synthesized with different ratios of S and Se powders (Fig. S1b–d†), substantiating the epitaxial growth in the as-achieved 2D flakes. In contrast to solid precursors containing CdS and CdSe powders used in previous physical vapor deposition (PVD) synthesis of alloyed CdSxSe(1−x) nanowires or nanobelts, the used precursors in this work are beneficial for the formation of 2D crystals owing to the low melting points which can provide more uniform and stable growth conditions during the growth process.16–20 Furthermore, due to the layered structure coupled by a weak VDWs force, the newly cleaved mica sheet is expected to offer a dangling-bond-free and chemically inert surface that enables epitaxial growth, namely, VDWs epitaxy.21–23 Unlike conventional epitaxy, the VDWs epitaxial growth pattern doesn't require strict lattice matching between the overlayer and the substrate, and it usually occurs when the epitaxial layer is connected to the substrate by weak VDWs force. This feature means that there are no strong chemical bonds between the overlayer and the substrate. As a result, the use of a layered mica sheet whose surface is free of active dangling bonds facilitates the growth of highly oriented 2D non-layered CdSxSe(1−x) crystals.13,24

(f) XRD patterns of several different CdSxSe(1−x) samples and the reference mica substrate. Curves A–D are from the samples in Fig. S1a–d,† respectively. 
The crystalline phase of the as-grown 2D flakes was investigated using XRD, as displayed in Fig. 1f. It can been clearly seen that the mica substrates show three diffraction peaks and they can be ascribed to (0006), (0009) and (11–24) planes of the fluorophlogopite mica [JCPDS no. 16-0352, KMg3(Si3AlO10)F2, P3112 space group, a = b = 0.53 nm, c = 2.998 nm, α = γ = 90°, β = 120°], respectively. In contrast, all of the products present only one single peak located at around 26°. Compared with the standard CdSe (JCPDS no. 08-0459) and CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049), it can be concluded that the samples have a hexagonal wurtzite phase, and the sole diffraction peaks should be indexed to (0002) planes of the samples, suggesting that the 2D crystals grow preferably along the c-axis direction with the (0002) plane as the basal plane. In addition, the (0002) diffraction peaks are found to shift gradually to a larger angle, indicating that the lattice constants of the samples decrease gradually with an increase of the S content. According to Bragg's law, the lattice parameter c for these samples can be derived from the XRD data, and the results are shown in Fig. 1f. Meanwhile, the S content of the CdSxSe(1−x) flakes can also be obtained based on Vegard's law using the calculated lattice parameters, and they are 0.14, 0.51, 0.7 and 0.87 for curves A, B, C and D, respectively.25
The microstructure and chemical composition of the individual CdSxSe(1−x) flakes were investigated by TEM combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Fig. 2a depicts a low-magnification bright-field TEM image of an individual 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flake shown in Fig. 1b and the lateral size is about 2 μm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2b exhibits a pretty clear-eyed view of a hexagonal lattice structure. The fringe spacings obtained from the HRTEM image are about 0.37 nm and 0.21 nm, which fit well to the interplanar distance of {10–10} and {11–20} planes of wurtzite CdSxSe(1−x), respectively. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is presented in Fig. 2c. The well-aligned diffraction spots with a six-fold symmetry corroborate the single crystallinity of this sample. EDS elemental maps shown in Fig. 2d–f reveal a uniform spatial distribution of Cd, S and Se elements, and the atomic ratio of Cd:S:Se is determined as about 12.1:1.69:10.41 (Fig. 2g), matching well with the stoichiometric ratio of CdS0.14Se0.86. Additionally, the samples shown in Fig. S1b–d† were also investigated (Fig. S2†) and were proved to be CdS0.51Se0.49, CdS0.7Se0.3 and CdS0.87Se0.13, respectively. These results are in good agreement with the XRD results in Fig. 1f, indicating that 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes with different chemical compositions can be synthesized using VDWs epitaxy.

Inset presents the atomic ratio of Cd, S and Se. 
Next, the growth behavior of the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys on a mica substrate is discussed. The sheet of fluorophlogopite mica is linked together by a weak interlayer VDWs force coming from the electrostatic interaction between the alternately stacked K+ layer and the negatively charged aluminosilicate layer.26 Upon exfoliation, a large number of K+ cations remain on the mica surface and then interact with the CdSxSe(1−x), leading to the formation of 2D alloy flakes. According to the results from XRD and TEM characterization, it is understood that the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys are hexagonal single crystals with lateral edges consisting of {10−10} planes and exposed (0002) facets parallel to the mica (0001) surface, as presented in Fig. 3a. The lattice parameter a (Fig. 3b) for CdS0.14Se0.86, CdS0.51Se0.49, CdS0.7Se0.3 and CdS0.87Se0.13 is calculated and found to be 0.422 nm, 0.418 nm, 0.417 nm and 0.415 nm based on Vegard's law, respectively. For the mica substrate, the lattice parameter a is determined as 0.53 nm (Fig. S3† and JCPDS no. 16-0352). In consideration of the similar crystal structure of 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes and fluorophlogopite mica, two possible epitaxial matching models are proposed: (i) (0001)[11–20]CdSxSe(1−x)‖(0001)[11–20]mica and (0001)[1–100]CdSxSe(1−x)‖(0001)[1–100]mica; (ii) (0001)[11–20]CdSxSe(1−x)‖(0001)[1–100]mica and (0001)[1–100]CdSxSe(1−x)‖(0001)[11–20]mica. Defining the lattice mismatch by f = (1 − doverlayer/dsubstrate) × 100%, where d is the lattice spacing, the f values for models (i) and (ii) can be obtained, as shown in Table S1.† As seen, CdS0.14Se0.86 is found to have the smallest lattice mismatches among the four samples. The f values are both 20.3% along [11–20]CdS0.14Se0.86 and [1–100]CdS0.14Se0.86 directions in model (i), and they are 30.9% along [11–20]CdS0.14Se0.86 and 8.3% along [2–200]CdS0.14Se0.86 in model (ii). As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that the highly oriented 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes are grown by incommensurate VDWs epitaxy, instead of commensurate heteroepitaxy. Furthermore, based on the foregoing analysis, it can be deduced that 5 × d(1–100)CdS0.14Se0.86 ≈ 4 × d(1–100)mica with a f value of 0.47% and 5 × d(11–20)CdS0.14Se0.86 ≈ 4 × d(11–20)mica with a f value of 0.47% in model (i) (Fig. 3c). In model (ii), it is found that 12 × d(11–20)CdS0.14Se0.86 ≈ 11 × d(2–200)mica with a f value of 0.17%, and every 10 × d(2–200)CdS0.14Se0.86 ≈ 7 × d(11–20)mica with a f value of 1.56% (Fig. 3d). The smaller supercell together with the less lattice mismatch (Fig. 3c) and the hexagonal morphology of the 2D alloy flakes (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1†) suggest that the model (i) is a more preferred incommensurate growth type.27

Next, optical properties of the 2D alloys were investigated by room-temperature PL spectroscopy, as displayed in Fig. 4a. It can be clearly observed that every individual sample possesses only one pronounced emission peak, suggesting a high crystallinity and uniformity in the flakes within the size of the optical probe (∼500 nm), which is further confirmed by the PL intensity map in the inset of Fig. 4a. Additionally, as the S content x increases gradually, a noticeable blue shift from 1.8 eV to 2.3 eV can be found. The correlation between the composition x and the bandgap (PL peak energy) is plotted in Fig. 4b. As seen, the experimental values (black squares) coincide well with the DFT calculation results (green dots) (Fig. S4†) and the fitted red curve based on the quadratic optical bowing function:19,28 Eg(CdSxSe1−x) = xEg(CdS) + (1 − x)Eg(CdSe) − bx(1 − x)(1)where the fitting parameters Eg(CdS) and Eg(CdSe) are found to be 2.44 eV and 1.74 eV, which match well with previously reported bandgaps of CdS and CdSe at room temperature, respectively.18 Meanwhile, the bowing constant b presenting the extent of nonlinearity is determined to be about 0.3, suggesting a good bandgap bowing effect on the CdSxSe(1−x) alloys.

(b) Composition dependent bandgap (PL peak energy) of the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloy flakes. The black squares and green dots represent the values extracted from the PL spectra (a) and the DFT calculations (Fig. S5†), respectively. The red curve is fitted with the quadratic optical bowing function. (c) Normalized PL spectra obtained on a CdS0.14S0.86 flake with temperature in the 295–80 K range. (d) Temperature dependence of the CdS0.14S0.86 flake bandgap (PL peak energy). The red curve is fitted with the Varshni equation. 
Previous reports have confirmed that temperature-dependent PL spectroscopy is an efficient method to study the electronic states near the band edge of semiconductors.29,30 Here, PL characterization with the temperature ranging from 295 K to 80 K was conducted on a representative CdS0.14Se0.86 flake, as displayed in Fig. 4c. As seen, all the PL peaks have a blue shift from 1.8 eV to 1.88 eV as the temperature decreases, accompanied by an obvious narrowing of their full width at half maximum. This change reveals the existence of lattice thermal expansion and temperature-dependent electron–phonon interaction in the alloyed flake. Noteworthily, the spectrum displays only one dominant PL peak at lower temperature even at 80 K, which strongly corroborates the high crystallinity of this flake. Moreover, the temperature dependence of PL peak energy of this flake is also given, as exhibited in Fig. 4d. To quantify the peak energy shift as a function of temperature, Varshni equation is used, as follows:28,30 Eg(T) = Eg(0) − αT2/(β + T)(2)where Eg(0) is the bandgap energy of the sample at 0 K and α and β are the Varshni coefficients. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Varshni fitting curve (solid red plot) fits very well with the experimental data (black five-pointed stars). The good fits yield Eg(0) = 1.884 eV, α = 0.42 meV K−1 and β = 124 K, which compare reasonably with previous results for CdS nanobelts (Eg(0) = 2.55 eV, α = 0.43 meV K−1 and β = 72.28 K) and CdSe nanowires (Eg(0) = 1.824 eV, α = 0.18 meV K−1, β = 151 K).31,32 In short, the excellent optical properties indicate that the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys possess huge application potential in color-tunable lasers and solar energy harvesting devices.33–37
In light of the 2D geometry of the CdSxSe(1−x) samples, two-electrode photodetectors can be readily fabricated, as displayed in Fig. 5a. Briefly, 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flake photodetectors were in situ fabricated on the mica substrate using a shadow mask with In/Au (10 nm/100 nm) as electrodes. The current (I)–voltage (V) characteristics of the CdSxSe(1−x) flake photodetector (inset in Fig. 5b) exposed to a laser of different wavelengths (450 nm, 532 nm; 2.45 mW cm−2) or in the dark are exhibited in Fig. 5b. The approximate linear behavior of the I–V plots suggests a good contact between the CdSxSe(1−x) flake and the electrodes. Meanwhile, it can been clearly seen that the current of the device is very small in the dark, while a pronounced increase in current is observed when the device is illuminated with lasers of different wavelengths. In particular, the current of the device is recorded as high as 0.86 μA under 450 nm laser illumination with a light intensity of 2.45 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V, demonstrating a good wavelength sensitivity of the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flake photodetector. The light intensity dependent photoresponse of the device under 450 nm laser illumination is also exhibited, as shown in Fig. 5c. As seen, the photocurrent (Iph = Iilluminated – Idark) of the photodetector increases gradually with an increase in light intensity and reaches 1.62 μA at a light intensity of 5.73 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V. In contrast to the dark current (Idark = 0.07 μA) at the same bias, the photocurrent increases by 23 times, indicating a good photoresponse of this device. The correlation between the photocurrent Iph and light intensity P can be further expressed by a simple power law equation Iph ∝ Pθ, where θ is the index of the power law.38 By fitting the experimental data (Fig. 5d), the θ value can be determined to be about 0.81. The deviation from the ideal slope of θ = 1 demonstrates the loss of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and it may be attributed to the trap states caused by defects or charge impurities in the CdSxSe(1−x) flakes, and the adsorbed oxygen molecules on the surface of CdSxSe(1−x) or at the CdSxSe(1−x)/mica interface.39–41

(b) I–V curves of the device in the dark and in the presence of 450 nm and 532 nm laser illumination with a light intensity of 2.45 mW cm−2.

(d) Light intensity dependence of the photocurrent under 450 nm laser illumination with the bias of 5 V. (e) Time-dependent photoresponse of the device under 450 nm laser illumination with a light intensity of 2.45 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V. (f) One single response showing the rising time of 39 ms and decay time of 39 ms, respectively. 
Some important parameters such as photoresponsivity (Rλ), external quantum efficiency (EQE), specific detectivity (D*) and response time τ can be used to judge the performance of the photodetectors.41–43 According to the expression of photoresponsivity Rλ = Iph/(PS), where Iph is the photocurrent, P is the light intensity and S is the effective area of the device (here S = 52.8 μm2) under laser illumination, a high Rλ of about 703 A W−1 can be obtained at a light intensity of 0.56 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V. This value is larger than that of the photodetectors based on other 2D materials such as graphene, SnS2 and Te nanoplates.38,39,44 With the calculated Rλ, corresponding external quantum efficiency EQE = hcRλ/(eλ) and specific detectivity D* = RλS1/2/(2eIdark)1/2, where h is the Planck constant, c is the light velocity, e is the elementary electronic charge and λ is the wavelength of the irradiated laser, can be determined to be about 1.94 × 103 and 3.41 × 1010 Jones, respectively. To investigate the response time, time-resolved photoresponse measurements were performed via turning on or off the 450 nm laser periodically with the device under a light intensity of 2.45 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V, as displayed in Fig. 5e. The results show a good repeatable and stable response to the laser illumination. Fig. 5f presents a single cycle showing the rise and decay behaviors of the current. It can be obviously seen that the current increases by more than 90% in 39 ms when the laser illumination is turned on and decreases dramatically by more than 90% in 39 ms after the laser is turned off. According to the definition of response time, it can be concluded that the rise and decay times are both 39 ms for this device.45 This value is comparable to those of the photodetectors based on WS2, CuIn7Se11 and GaTe flakes, which may be attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of the alloyed flakes owing to the sulphur or selenium vacancies.43,46–48
Synthesis of 2D CdSxSe(1−x) flakes on the thin mica sheet makes it possible for fabricating flexible optoelectronic devices. To investigate the stability, time-dependent photoresponse measurements were performed on another CdSxSe(1−x) flake photodetector before and after it was bent 50 times, as shown in Fig. 6. Comparing the photoresponse in Fig. 6a with that in Fig. 6b, it can be clearly found that both the current in the dark and under laser illumination decrease after bending the device. This may result from the higher contact barrier owing to the relaxation of the contact electrodes, which is confirmed from Fig. S5.† Although there exists a decrease in current after bending the device, a clear ON- and OFF-response is still observed, demonstrating the good mechanical stability of the 2D alloyed flake photodetector (Fig. S6†). Particularly, the stability of the contact electrodes could be enhanced effectively via improving the device fabrication technique. The bending measurements clearly demonstrate that the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) on the thin mica sheet can withstand small bending radius and repeated bending, making it an appealing material for flexible photodetectors.

Inset shows the photograph of the setup for the bending measurements. The photoresponse test was performed under 450 nm laser illumination with a light intensity of 4.6 mW cm−2 and a bias of 5 V. 
Conclusions
In summary, we successfully demonstrate the incommensurate VDWs epitaxy of composition-tunable 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloy flakes on a fluorophlogopite mica substrate. The as-achieved 2D alloys crystallized into a hexagonal shape with the lateral size of several microns and height of about 70 nm. Both XRD and TEM demonstrate the high crystallinity of the 2D CdSxSe(1−x), confirmed by the low-temperature PL spectra. Room-temperature PL reveals that the 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloys have a composition-dependent near band edge emission with the spectra peak varying from 1.8 to 2.3 eV, matching well with the DFT calculations. Photodetectors based on 2D CdSxSe(1−x) alloy flakes display a superior photoresponse with the photoresponsivity, external quantum efficiency, specific detectivity and response time as high as 703 A W−1, 1.94 × 103, 3.41 × 1010 Jones and 39 ms, respectively. Impressively, flexible devices fabricated on the mica sheet show good mechanical stability upon repeated bending. This study provides a convenient way to obtain high-quality 2D ternary semiconductors with tunable composition and optical properties, allowing their use in future flexible optoelectronic devices.
