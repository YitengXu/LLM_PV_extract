Due to their semiconducting, optical, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric properties, n-type wide bandgap semiconductors such as ZnO and TiO2 have been widely used in gas sensors, photocatalysis, catalyst supports, batteries, and solar cells.1–10 In recent years, nanostructured ZnO and TiO2 with controlled size, shape and dimensions have received considerable attention.11–16 As wide bandgap semiconductors, ZnO and TiO2 possess similar energy band structures and physical properties. Compared to TiO2, the synthesis of ZnO is advantageous as diverse synthesis methods can be employed to yield a variety of nanostructured ZnO. Among many synthesis strategies,17 including sol–gel, electrostatic spray deposition techniques, electrochemical deposition fabrication and hydrothermal reactions, chemical bath deposition (CBD) represents a simple yet effective method for producing a large number of accessible nanomaterials.18 The advantages of the CBD approach include the easily achievable synthesis conditions (e.g., low reaction temperature and atmosphere pressure), and the ease of large-scale production.19–21Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising low-cost high-efficiency alternatives to conventional Si solar cells. Regardless of higher electron mobility that facilitates electron transport and reduces the recombination loss,17 DSSCs assembled by using ZnO as the photoanode exhibited poor performance when compared to those fabricated from TiO2.22 One primary reason can be attributed to the instability of ZnO in acidic dye solution. For example, Zn can be dissolved in the commonly used dye N719 solution, forming a Zn2+/N719 dye complex20 immediately after the immersion of ZnO in the N719 solution for 10 min.23 In comparison with TiO2, the existence of the Zn2+/dye complex would agglomerate to yield a thick covering layer instead of a monolayer, thus leading to poor electron injection.24 It is noteworthy that, in contrast to a sintered network consisting of randomly dispersed nanoparticles, the use of hierarchically structured photoanodes in DSSCs may offer an effective direct conduction pathway for charge injection into the collection electrode while retaining a high surface area for sufficient dye loading and light harvesting.16,25–27Herein, we report that, by combining the ease of producing ZnO nanoflowers with the advantageous chemical stability of TiO2, hierarchically structured hollow TiO2 flower-like clusters were created via chemical bath deposition (CBD) of ZnO nanoflowers, followed by their conversion into TiO2 flower-like clusters in the presence of TiO2 precursors. The effects of different reaction conditions (i.e., precursor concentration and amount, and reaction time) on the formation of ZnO nanoflowers during the CBD process were scrutinized. ZnO nanoflowers were then converted into TiO2 flower-like clusters by immersing in the TiO2 precursor solution. These hierarchically structured TiO2 flowers were produced by depositing TiO2 on the surface of ZnO nanoflowers and meanwhile dissolving the ZnO scaffold. The converted TiO2 exhibited a similar size and shape to ZnO nanoflowers while possessing a hollow structure. Dye-sensitized solar cells assembled by utilizing hierarchically structured ZnO and TiO2 flower clusters showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.16% and 2.73%, respectively. The intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) measurements were performed to reveal the dynamics of electron transit time and life-time in the resulting DSSCs, suggesting that flower-like structures had a fast electron transit time and their charge collection efficiency was nearly 100%.Experimental sectionZinc nitrite (Zn(NO3)2), hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine, HMTA) and NH3 are used as precursors for chemical bath deposition (CBD) of ZnO nanoflowers on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass.28,29 The FTO glass was pre-cleaned by sonicating in acetone, methanol and isopropanol baths sequentially for 30 min. The temperature of CBD was fixed at 80 °C in an oven at atmospheric pressure. The Zn2+ concentration was changed from 12.5 mM to 37.5 mM. The effect of the amount of ZnO precursors was also investigated. Subsequently, the ZnO nanoflower-coated FTO substrate was immersed in a solution composed of 0.075 M ammonium fluorotitanate ((NH4)2TiCl6) and 0.2 M boric acid (H3BO3) at room temperature to deposit TiO2 on the surface of the ZnO nanoflower while dissolving ZnO simultaneously.30 The ZnO nanoflower-coated FTO and TiO2 nanoflower-coated FTO were sintered at 450 °C for 2 h and used as photoanodes for DSSCs later.TiO2 nanoparticle (NP)-coated FTO was fabricated as the photoanode and used as the control for the comparison of electron transit time and charge collection efficiency with those of TiO2 flower-like cluster photoanodes. A 10 wt% TiO2 NP paste was prepared by mixing 1 g P-25 TiO2 (Degussa) and 1 g poly(ethylene glycol) in 4.5 ml H2O and 4.5 ml ethanol. It was then deposited on a clean FTO glass. A 50 μm thick tape (3M) was used to control the thickness of the P-25 TiO2 NP film coated on the FTO glass by the doctor-blade method. The P-25 TiO2 NP film was coated on the FTO glass by the doctor-blade method, and allowed to dry at room temperature for 15 min, and then sintered at 450 °C for 2 h. A 0.2 M TiCl4 aqueous solution was prepared by adding 2 ml TiCl4 into a mixture of 50 g ice and 50 g water. Prior to the dye adsorption, TiO2 NP films were immersed in TiCl4 aqueous solution, and then kept in an oil bath at 70 °C for 1 h, followed by rinsing with ethanol and annealed at 450 °C in air for 30 min. After that, the surface-treated films were immersed in a 0.2 mM dye ethanol solution for 24 h to allow for sufficient dye adsorption. The dye used in the study was cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetra-butylammonium) (N719, Solaronix). Flower-like ZnO and TiO2 cluster photoanodes were fabricated with the same dye sensitization procedure as that used for TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) photoanodes described above. We note that the surface of ZnO nanoflowers was not treated with TiCl4 as ZnO would readily dissolve in TiCl4 solution.Platinum (Pt)-coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode, prepared by placing a drop of 0.5 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution on a clean FTO glass substrate and subsequently sintered at 380 °C for 30 min. The DSSCs were assembled with ZnO-flower-cluster-coated FTO glass or TiO2-flower-cluster-coated FTO glass as photoanodes, and Pt-coated FTO glass as the counter electrode. A 25 μm thick hot-melt film (SX1170-25, Solaronix) was used as the spacer to separate the photoanode and the counter electrode. The resulting DSSCs were in the front-side illumination mode (i.e., the incident photons directly encounter the dye-adsorbed photoanodes). An ionic liquid electrolyte containing 0.60 M BMIM-I, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M TBP and 0.10 M GTC in acetonitrile–valeronitrile 85/15 (v/v) (ES-0004, purchased from io.li.tec, Germany) was injected between two electrodes driven by the capillary force through holes on the hot-melt film.A digital optical power meter (Thor Labs Inc.) was used to measure the light emitted from a SoLux solar simulator. The light intensity was adjusted until a power density of 100 mW cm−2 reached the cell. The current density–voltage curves (J–V curves) were recorded with Keithley's Lab Tracer 2.0. The photoactive area of solar cells was 0.125 cm2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed using a ZEISS LEO 1550 SEM. Intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) data were obtained using a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation with a controlled intensity modulated photospectroscopy (CIMPS) system. The cells were exposed under a blue diode laser (λmax = 447 nm) at different light intensity with sinusoidal perturbation. The modulation frequency ranged from 0.1Hz to 10 kHz for both IMPS and IMVS measurements.Results and discussionThe chemical reactions of CBD of ZnO contain the following three steps:19,31 (CH2)6N4 + 6H2O ↔ 4NH3 + 6HCHO(1) NH3 + H2O ↔ NH3·H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH−(2) Zn2+ + 2OH− ↔ Zn(OH)2 ↔ ZnO + H2O(3)Eqn (1) shows that hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) is hydrolyzed into NH3 and an organic compound, formaldehyde. The formed NH3 together with the added NH3 provide OH− in the solution (eqn (2)). The OH− and Zn2+ from Zn(NO3)2 precursors react and generate Zn(OH)2, which easily lose one water molecule and precipitate as ZnO onto the FTO substrate (eqn (3)). HMTA can continuously hydrolyze into NH3, which replenishes the evaporated NH3 during the reaction at high temperature while keeping a constant basic environment, thus facilitating the formation of ZnO.Fig. 1 displays the SEM images of ZnO flower-like clusters (i.e., nanoflowers) prepared with 40 ml of 25 mM Zn(NO3)2 solution reacted at 80 °C for 6 h. Such flower-like clusters were developed by preferentially oriented nucleation, and densely distributed over the surface of the FTO substrate. A close-up view revealed that the flower-like clusters were composed of an agglomeration of nanorods of approximately 3 μm in length and 300 nm in diameter with a sharp end (Fig. 1b) (i.e., forming hierarchically structured flower-like clusters). The thickness of the nanoflower film is about 34 μm as shown in the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1c and d). The ZnO nanoflowers were then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h to further increase the crystallinity and promote the connections between adjacent nanoflowers as shown in Fig. 2. Notably, the size and shape of ZnO nanoflowers were almost the same as those prior to sintering. Clearly, the flower-like structures were not altered by the sintering process. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results revealed that the percentages of Zn and O atoms are 52% and 48%, respectively, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of ZnO.

(c and d) Cross-sectional view of nanoflowers.  Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) ZnO nanoflowers sintered at 450 °C, and (b) close-up of sintered ZnO nanoflowers. To understand the formation of ZnO nanoflowers by CBD, a series of ZnO nanoflowers grown from 20 ml of 25 mM Zn(NO3)2 solution with the increased reaction time were imaged (Fig. 3). At the early stage of the reaction, the solution became opaque within 30 min, indicating the formation of ZnO in the solution. However, no ZnO flower-like clusters were formed on the FTO glass after the reaction for 1 h (Fig. 3a). As the reaction time increased to 2 h, one to two layers of ZnO nanoflowers with a thickness of 7 ± 3 μm were emerged on the FTO substrate (Fig. 3b). The prolonged reaction to 3 h yielded a thicker ZnO nanoflower film (h = 17 ± 4 μm) (Fig. 3c). However, when the reaction time was extended to 6 h, no further thickness increase was observed (Fig. 3d), which may be attributed to the fact that all Zn precursors were consumed and precipitated on the FTO glass. The solution was found to be completely clear as no ZnO was left in the solution. The effect of precursor concentration at the constant solution volume (i.e., 20 ml) on the film thickness was investigated. As the concentration of the Zn(NO3)2 precursor increased from 12.5 mM, to 25 mM, and to 37.5 mM, the thickness of the ZnO flower-like cluster film increased from 2.5 ± 1 μm (Fig. 4a), to 15 ± 4 μm (Fig. 4b), and to 22 ± 5 μm (Fig. 4c), respectively. Fig. 5 shows the influence of solution volume at the constant precursor concentration (i.e., 25 mM) on the ZnO film thickness. The film thickness increased from 15 ± 4 μm (Fig. 5a), to 34 ± 6 μm (Fig. 5b), and 56 ± 6 μm (Fig. 5c) when the solution volume was changed from 20 ml, to 40 ml, and to 60 ml, respectively. Thus, the thickness of the deposited ZnO is proportional to the total amount of Zn precursors used (i.e., both concentration and volume), except for the situation at low concentration (i.e., 12.5 mM in Fig. 4a). This is not surprising as all Zn precursors were reacted to form ZnO nanoflowers on the FTO glass at high precursor concentration. On the basis of these observations, it is possible to control the thickness of ZnO flower-like cluster films by varying the reaction time and the amount of precursors used. Fig. 3  SEM images of ZnO nanoflowers produced at different reaction times. (a) 1 h, (b) 2 h, (c) 3 h, and (d) 6 h.  Fig. 4  SEM images of ZnO nanoflowers formed at different precursor concentrations. (a) 12.5 mM, (b) 25 mM, and (c) 37.5 mM.  Fig. 5  SEM images of ZnO nanoflowers created at different solution volumes. (a) 20 ml, (b) 40 ml, and (c) 60 ml. The formed ZnO nanoflowers were then converted into TiO2 flower-like clusters via the CBD method by immersing the former into a solution containing 0.075 M ammonium fluorotitanate ((NH4)2TiF6) and 0.2 M boric acid (H3BO3) at room temperature. The reaction of (NH4)2TiF6 and H3BO3 during the liquid phase deposition can be described by the following equations.30–32 TiF62− + 2H2O ↔ TiO2 + 4HF + 2F−(4) H3BO3 + 4HF ↔ BF4− + 3H2O + H+(5) ZnO + 2H+ ↔ Zn2+ + H2O(6)As shown in eqn (4), TiO2 is deposited by the hydrolysis of Ti-fluoride complex ions (TiF62−). The produced HF and the added H3BO3 move the reaction to the right in eqn (5), creating H+. This acidic solution then dissolves ZnO simultaneously as depicted in eqn (6). In this work the immersion time for TiO2 conversion was varied from 15 min to 2 h, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 2 h to allow the crystallization of TiO2 and form the anatase TiO2. EDS was performed to investigate the change of composition from ZnO nanoflowers to TiO2 flower-like clusters. The original ZnO nanoflowers contained 52% Zn and 48% O. After 15 min immersion in the (NH4)2TiF6 and boric acid (H3BO3) solution, the atomic ratio of Zn to Ti was 25:8, thus 24% of ZnO was converted into TiO2. The atomic ratio of Zn to Ti changed to 24:11 after immersing for 30 min, indicating that 32% of ZnO was converted to TiO2. Interestingly, after 1 h immersion, the atomic ratio of Zn to Ti dropped to 1:8, signifying 90% conversion of ZnO into TiO2. The conversion was further increased to 93% after 2 h immersion, where the atomic ratio of Zn to Ti is 1:14 was found. The longer immersion time did not significantly increase the TiO2 content to 100%. This may be attributed to the fact that some residual ZnO is fully covered by TiO2, making it not accessible to be completely dissolved in the acidic environment. The EDS result indicated that the newly converted TiO2 flower-like clusters contained 20% atomic percentage of F atoms. The origin of these F atoms may be from the Ti precursor (TiF62−). However, the sintering of TiO2 flower-like clusters at 450 °C for 2 h fully removed those F atoms and meanwhile crystallized the flower-like TiO2. As a result, no F signal was found by EDS after sintering. Fig. 6 shows converted TiO2 flower-like clusters obtained after the 2 h conversion from ZnO nanoflowers. Obviously, the shape of flower-like clusters was retained after the conversion, however the structure became hollow (marked with circles in Fig. 6b). The film thickness remained as 34 μm after transforming into TiO2 (Fig. 6c and d). Fig. 6  SEM images of TiO2 flower-like clusters converted from ZnO nanoflowers. (a and b) Top view of flower-like clusters (the red circles mark the hollow structure of clusters). (c and d) Cross-sectional view of flower-like clusters. The ZnO and TiO2 flower-like cluster films were then exploited as photoanodes to assemble dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The thicknesses of ZnO and TiO2 nanoflower films used were 15 μm. In order to further increase the performance of DSSCs based on TiO2 flower-like clusters, the TiCl4 treatment was performed (see the Experimental section). Fig. 7 shows the sintered TiO2 flower-like clusters prior to TiCl4 treatment (Fig. 7a and b) and after TiCl4 treatment (Fig. 7c and d). Small TiO2 nanoparticles were clearly evident on the surface of nanoflowers after the TiCl4 treatment (marked with circles in Fig. 7d). The presence of nanoparticles is expected to further improve the device performance due to the increased surface area for dye adsorption.

(c and d) Top view of flower-like clusters after the TiCl4 treatment (the red circles mark the emergence of TiO2 nanoparticles). The current density–voltage characteristics of ZnO-flower-cluster-based DSSCs and TiO2-flower-cluster-based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8a. The device performance is summarized in Table 1. The ZnO-flower-cluster-based DSSCs had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.70% before sintering and 1.16% after sintering at 450 °C. The open circuit voltages, Voc, of ZnO-flower-cluster-based DSSCs were 0.71 V and 0.70 V before and after sintering, respectively. After sintering, the short circuit current density, Jsc, doubled (i.e., 2.41 mA cm−2vs. 4.76 mA cm−2; Fig. 8a), possibly due to the improved connectivity between flower clusters and better crystallinity of ZnO, which reduced the charge recombination during charge transport within ZnO and increased the current. However, these Jsc are much lower than that of TiO2-flower-cluster-based DSSCs (Fig. 8a). After ZnO was transformed into TiO2 and subsequently treated with TiCl4, the Jsc of the resulting TiO2-flower-cluster-based DSSC increased to 7.96 mA cm−2. The PCE of TiO2-flower-cluster-based DSSCs was 2.73%, which is higher than that of ZnO-flower-cluster-based DSSCs. It is noteworthy that both Jsc and PCE of TiO2-flower-cluster-based DSSCs were lower than that of TiO2-nanoparticle-based DSSCs we prepared (Jsc = 11.6 mA cm−2, PCE = 5.16%). The low surface area of flower-like structures, and thus low dye loading, may account for low Jsc and PCE. Compared to ZnO nanoflower photoanodes, the surface area of the converted TiO2 flower-like cluster photoanode after treated with TiCl4 increased due to the presence of a hollow structure (Fig. 6b and 7d) and the emergence of small TiO2 nanoparticles (marked with circles in Fig. 7d). In contrast, ZnO nanoflowers cannot experience the TiCl4 treatment as ZnO would readily dissolve in the acidic environment with the presence of TiCl4.

The results were summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Fig. 8b shows the electron transit time and life-time of TiO2 flower-like-cluster-based DSSCs and TiO2-nanoparticle-based DSSCs measured at different light intensities by IMPS/IMVS. The red open circles and open triangles indicate the electron transit time, τt and life-time, τl of flower-like cluster architectures, respectively. The blue open circles and open triangles indicate the electron transit time and life-time of nanoparticle architectures, respectively. The solid lines are the fitted results for each transit time and life-time. Notably, the electron life-times of flower-like clusters and nanoparticles are very close to each other (i.e., within 20%) as evidenced in Fig. 8b; this is not surprising as both these architectures are comprised of TiO2 and underwent the same treatments. However, the electron transit time of flower-like cluster architectures is nearly 4 times faster than that of nanoparticle architectures at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and 7 times faster at a light intensity of 3 mW cm−2. The short electron transit time of flower-like cluster architectures indicates that the excited electrons can travel much faster in flower-like clusters than that in nanoparticles, especially when the light intensity is low. Consequently, the charge collection efficiency,33ηcc = 1 − τt/τl, of flower-like cluster architectures can reach as high as 96% at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which is in sharp contrast with ηcc of their nanoparticle counterpart (ηcc = 82%). When the light intensity decreased to 3 mW cm−2, the ηcc of flower-like cluster architectures remained 94%, while the ηcc of nanoparticle architectures dropped to 53%. With the advantageous short electron transit time and large charge collection efficiency, the flower-like cluster architecture may have potential applications in fast response and sensitive detectors, especially under a working environment with low light intensity.

The thickness of ZnO nanoflower films depends on the precursor concentration and precursor amount, and reaction time. ZnO nanoflowers were then converted into hollow TiO2 flower clusters. N719 dye-sensitized solar cells were assembled by exploiting ZnO and TiO2 flower-like cluster films as photoanodes. Dye-sensitized ZnO-flower-cluster-based and TiO2-flower-cluster-based solar cells illuminated under 100 mW cm−2 exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 1.16% and 2.73%, respectively. The intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) measurements suggested that flower-like cluster architectures had a fast electron transit time and nearly 100% charge collection efficiency. Further study on increasing the surface area of flower clusters is necessary to yield high performance DSSCs; this work is currently under investigation.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Georgia Institute of Technology.ReferencesA.
