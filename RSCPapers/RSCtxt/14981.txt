Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the morphology and structure of nanoparticles. Transmission spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Surface wettability was studied by an automatic contact angle/interface system. Condensation performance of the Fresnel lenses was studied by measuring the focal length and the powers before and after being focused. The (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating turned out to simultaneously demonstrate excellent superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective properties, which has a maximum transmittance of 99.0% and average transmittance of 98.5% in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, and the condensing efficiency of the coated Fresnel lens has also been significantly improved. The surface morphology and structure of coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effects of surface morphology and structure on the optical and wetting properties of coatings were also discussed. The density of SPHSNs on the coating surface was considered to significantly influence both the light transmission and hydrophobicity of coated Fresnel lenses.1. IntroductionFresnel lenses, which have better optical performance but smaller mass and volume than conventional spherical lenses, have been widely used in optics such as solar cells, projectors, slide projectors, film magnifiers, and infrared detectors, etc.1–6 As transparent components on optical devices, the antireflective and self-cleaning properties are essential and important for Fresnel lenses. Generally, to obtain antireflective and self-cleaning performance,7–18 nanostructured coatings are applied on the surface of substrates, followed by high-temperature post-treatment such as calcination or surface modification (>100 °C).19–28 The approach was applicable because the substrates were glass or other thermostable materials. However, Fresnel lenses are usually made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is thermolabile because of its low glass transition temperature.5,25,29,30 Therefore, the previous preparation methods of antireflective and self-cleaning coatings, which include the step of high temperature treatment, are generally not applicable to Fresnel lenses, and new approaches to coating fabrication need to be explored to avoid high temperature treatments.Recently, highly antireflective coatings were successfully prepared on Fresnel lenses by spin-coating solid silica nanoparticles (SSNs),5 where nearly zero reflection was achieved and the maximum transmittance reached as high as 99.8%. Very recently, a new functional feature, superhydrophilicity, was introduced to the highly antireflective coatings by using mesoporous silica nanoparticles as top layers.30 To our best knowledge, however, bifunctional coatings with both antireflective and superhydrophobic functions have not been achieved yet on Fresnel lenses. On the other hand, superhydrophobic surfaces had been fabricated by applying hydrophobically modified silica nanoparticles coatings on glass substrates without any high-temperature treatment,31,32 but the coatings are hardly antireflective. Consequently, the fabrication of rationally designed coating structures using both SSNs and hydrophobically modified silica nanoparticles as building blocks is expected to produce coatings of both superior antireflective and superhydrophobic properties on Fresnel lenses. It is in fact the case.In the current work, SSNs and hydrophobically modified hollow silica nanoparticles (HSNs) were applied to Fresnel lenses, and superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective coatings were successfully fabricated without any high-temperature pre- or post-treatment. The coated Fresnel lenses were highly transparent, and their condensing efficiency was also significantly improved. To the best of our knowledge, Fresnel lenses with both superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective properties have never been reported before.2. Experimental2.1. MaterialsTetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perflurooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS, 97%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Ammonia (25%), stearic acid (STA), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%), concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%) and absolute ethanol (99.5%) were purchased from Beihua Fine Chemicals. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, 30%) was supplied by Zaozhuang Fenghe Chemicals. All chemicals were used as received. Ultrapure water with a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm was used in all experiments, and was obtained from a three-stage Millipore Mill-Q Plus 185 purification system (Academic). Fresnel lenses (diameter: 28 mm, thickness: 1.5 mm and focal length: 15 mm) were purchased from Shenzhen Haiwang Sensors & Controls Co.2.2. Preparation of silica nanoparticlesSSNs of ca. 16 nm in size were synthesized according to the previous works.5,30,33 5 mL aqueous ammonia (25%) and 100 mL absolute ethanol (99.5%) were mixed with stirring in a round-bottomed flask. After the mixture was heated to 60 °C in a water bath, 3 mL TEOS was added to the mixture with stirring. The mixture was then stirred for additional 12 h, and finally the ethanolic suspension of SSNs of ca. 16 nm in size was obtained.HSNs of ca. 53 nm in size were synthesized at room temperature by hydrolyzing TEOS in presence of ammonia, PAA and ethanol.33,34 In a typical procedure, 0.35 mL PAA dissolved in 4.5 mL aqueous ammonia was mixed with 90 mL ethanol in a 250 mL two-neck round-bottomed flask, followed by injection of 2.25 mL TEOS within 50 min under vigorous magnetic stirring. After stirring for 10 h, the ethanolic suspension of HSNs of ca. 53 nm in diameter was obtained.The as-prepared suspension of HSNs was stirred in an open glass beaker in a ventilating cabinet to remove ammonia for the following reaction. STA was then used to modify the HSNs in the prepared suspension. In detail, after the prepared suspension was heated to 60 °C, 1.5 g STA (2.4 wt%) was added, keeping reaction under magnetic stirring for 5.5 h. Then, 0.1521 g POTS (0.5 wt%) was dissolved in 30 g of the suspension. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 2.5 h. Finally, the suspension of HSNs modified with both STA and POTS (SPHSNs) was obtained. The molar ratio of TEOS, STA and POTS was 16:8:1.312.3. Surface treatment of Fresnel lenses and preparation of nanoparticle filmsFresnel lenses were pre-cleaned with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. Then they were treated with oxygen plasma (0.84 W) for 5 min to remove any organic contaminants on their surfaces35 and render their surfaces a significant amount of surface hydroxyl groups. The suspension of SSNs (1.0 wt%) was spin-coated on the as-treated Fresnel lenses first at 50 rpm for 15 s and then at 2000 rpm for 40 s to prepare (SSNs)1 coatings (KW-4A spin coater, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences).5 To fabricate (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings on Fresnel lenses, the Fresnel lenses with the (SSNs)1 coatings were used as substrate, and the suspension of SPHSNs (0.8 wt%) was sprayed onto the substrate. In detail, the suspension was loaded into the barrel of spray gun (ANEST IWATA, Iwata) and sprayed onto the substrate at a flow rate of 0.6 mL s−1, keeping the distance between the gun and the substrate to be 12 cm and the spray pressure to be 0.5 MPa. A given number of spray-cycles were repeated, which is denoted by n. Subsequently, the spin- and spray-coated Fresnel lenses were dried at 90 °C for 16 h to allow ethanol and excess water to evaporate from the thin coatings.31 A schematic illustration for the preparation of nanoparticle coatings on Fresnel lenses is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1  Schematic illustration for the preparation of superhydrophobic antireflective coatings on Fresnel lens. 2.4. CharacterizationTo examine the morphology and structure of as-prepared SSNs and SPHSNs, the ethanolic suspensions of SSNs and SPHSNs were added onto carbon-coated copper grids. After drying at 60 °C overnight, they were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV. The surface morphologies of as-prepared coatings were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an MM8-SYS scanning probe microscope (Bruker AXR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Hitachi S-4300 scanning electron microscope operated at 5 kV. The specimens were coated with a thin layer of gold by ion sputtering before SEM observations. Transmission spectra in the range of 350–800 nm were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Water contact angles (WCAs) and sliding angles (SAs) of surfaces were measured at ambient temperature on a Kino SL200B3 automatic contact angle meter, the angle precision of which is ±0.2°. Water droplets of an appropriate volume (ca. 4 μL) were dropped carefully onto the sample surfaces. Effects of water droplet impact and pH value were investigated on the superhydrophobic coatings.31,36 In the water droplet impact test, about 1200 water droplets (ca. 32 μL) were dropped from ca. 45 cm above the sample surface. WCAs were measured on the sample surface after the water droplet impact test. In the pH test, contact angles were measured on the sample surface using aqueous hydrochloric solution (pH = 1) and aqueous alkaline solution (pH = 14), respectively, which were carefully dropped onto the surface of superhydrophobic coating. To examine light condensation performance, the focal length (f) and the power ratio (r) of power recorded at the focal point (Pf) to power of incident light (Pin) (r = Pf/Pin) were measured, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The incident light was a laser beam with a wavelength of 790 ± 2 nm. The power at the focal point and that of the incident light were measured by an EPM2000 power meter (Coherent Inc.).

Results and discussion3.1. Morphology and structure of silica nanoparticlesSSNs were synthesized by the Stöber method,33 and the mean size of SSNs was regulated to ca. 16 nm by controlling the reaction temperature at 60 °C. Fig. 3a shows a TEM image of the obtained SSNs. It could be seen that they are basically monodisperse. Some particles were connected together, producing SSNs of peculiar shapes, which are attractive for construction of rough and stable surfaces.23 HSNs were prepared via a method reported by Yu et al.34 As shown in Fig. 3b, they are nearly monodisperse and well dispersed. The mean size of the HSNs was estimated to be ca. 53 nm. The as-prepared HSNs were sequentially modified by STA and POTS to obtain SPHSNs,31,37,38 which are supposed to be hydrophobic on their surfaces. Fig. 3c shows a TEM image of SPHSNs. A less dark thin shell was observed on the HSN shell, and is supposed to consist of STA and POTS. The STA, POTS and HSNs could be assembled together to minimize the interfacial energy, and they have synergetic effects in enhancing surface roughness and thus hydrophobicity according to our previous report.31 Therefore, similarly obtained micro/nanostructures are expected to create necessary surface roughness on Fresnel lenses towards superhydrophobicity.31 Fig. 3  TEM images of (a) SSNs, (b) HSNs, and (c) SPHSNs, respectively. 3.2. Spin/spray-assembly of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings on Fresnel lenses and their wetting and optical propertiesFresnel lens has two surfaces, i.e., the smooth surface and the patterned surface. As we previously reported,5,31 Fresnel lens with SSNs coatings on both patterned and smooth surfaces is extremely transparent;5 and on the other hand, SPHSNs coatings could provide superhydrophobicity but they would slightly decrease the transmittance of substrates.31 Thus, to obtain high transmittance and superhydrophobic surfaces, SSNs coatings were first spin-assembled on both surfaces of Fresnel lenses, and SPHSNs coatings were then spray-assembled on the smooth surface of Fresnel lenses. The as-assembled coatings are named as (SSNs)m/(SPHSNs)n, where m represents the number of SSNs layers on both surfaces of Fresnel lenses and n represents the number of SPHSNs layers on the smooth surface of Fresnel lenses.Wettability is an important property of coatings. According to early theoretical works by Wenzel39 and Quere et al.,40,41 the wetting behavior of a surface is dependent on both surface chemistry and surface topography. The wetting properties of the as-prepared coatings were investigated by measuring WCAs and SAs on the smooth surface of Fresnel lenses, where the volumes of water droplets used for measuring WCAs and SAs were 4 μL and 10 μL, respectively. The digital images of water droplets on the smooth surface of coated Fresnel lenses are shown in Fig. 4a–d. For the (SSNs)1/(MSNs)1, (SSNs)1/(MSNs)2, (SSNs)1/(MSNs)3, and (SSNs)1/(MSNs)4 coating, the WCAs were measured to be 26°, 154°, 156°, and 159°, respectively. The successive increase of WCAs indicates that the hydrophobicity increases with increase of the number of SPHSNs layers, and when the number of SPHSNs layers is equal to or more than 2, the WCAs are larger than 150°, and the SAs are lower than 5°. Water droplets of 10 μL roll off the surface of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coatings easily and quickly, which are shown in Fig. 4e–h. Therefore, these (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coatings exhibit superhydrophobicity, which bestows a self-cleaning function like that of lotus leaves. Fig. 1 shows a photograph of water droplets on the smooth surface of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating. Clearly, the water droplets look like spheres and have very high WCAs. Fig. 4  (a–d) Digital images of water droplets on the surfaces of (a) (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1 coating, (b) (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating, (c) (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)3 coating, and (d) (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)4 coating; (e–h) images of the rolling process of water droplet on the surface of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating titled by an angle of 5°. Effects of water droplet impact and pH value on the stability of the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating were evaluated. After impact by 1200 water droplets (height: ca. 45 cm, impacting velocity: 297 cm s−1), the WCA of the coating remains 154° (Fig. 5a), and the SA is lower than 5°, indicating that the coating is robust to rinsing by water. Both aqueous hydrochloric solution (pH = 1) and aqueous alkaline solution (pH = 14) droplets were applied onto the superhydrophobic coating. The contact angles were measured to be 153° (Fig. 5b, pH = 1) and 150° (Fig. 5c, pH = 14), respectively, and the SAs are lower than 5°. The contact angles are slightly lower than the WCA (154°) measured using pure water droplets (Fig. 5a, pH = 7), but the coating is still superhydrophobic with a contact angle of not lower than 150°. The insensitivity of contact angle to the pH value implies high stability of the coating towards acidic and basic aqueous solutions droplets, which is probably attributed to the high repellence of the coating surface towards acidic and basic droplets. What's more, the WCAs did not decrease significantly after the specimens were stored under indoor conditions for six months, indicating that the superhydrophobicity of the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings is also stable over time. Fig. 5  Digital images of (a) water droplet after impact by 1200 water droplets, (b) aqueous hydrochloric solution droplet (pH = 1) and (c) aqueous alkaline solution droplet (pH = 14) on the surface of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating. As we know, the increase of surface roughness is beneficial to hydrophobicity but harmful to transparency, i.e., the hydrophobicity and transparency are competitive properties.21,23,26,31,42,43 Therefore, the surface roughness should be appropriately controlled to balance both properties. Fig. 6a shows transmission spectra of the coated Fresnel lenses. Apparently, the transmittance of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coated Fresnel lenses is higher than that of uncoated Fresnel lens but lower than that of the (SSNs)1 coated Fresnel lens. The spectrum of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1 coating is in close proximity to that of the (SSNs)1 coating, i.e., only a reduction of 0.12% and 0.16% in average and maximum transmittance was observed, respectively. Considering that the WCA on the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1 coating (26°, Fig. 4a) is much lower than that on the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating (154°, Fig. 4b), it could be inferred that with one layer of SPHSNs, there might be only a small amount of SPHSNs staying on the surface. The transmittance of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coated Fresnel lenses decreases, however, more significantly from that of the (SSNs)1 coated Fresnel lens, and their spectral profiles also differ from that of the (SSNs)1 coated Fresnel lens. For example, the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating, which has the highest transmittance among the superhydrophobic coatings, has a peak value of 99.0% at 655 nm in wavelength, while that of the (SSNs)1 coating has a peak value of 99.8% at 556 nm. Besides, the transmittance of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coated Fresnel lenses decreases more significantly in the wavelength range of 400–720 nm and less significantly in the wavelength range of 720–800 nm from that of the (SSNs)1 coated Fresnel lens. Fig. 6  Transmission spectra (a) and dependence of maximum and average transmittance in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm on the number (n) of SPHSNs layers (b) of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coated Fresnel lenses (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). The curves in (a) along the direction of the arrow are transmission spectra of Fresnel lenses coated with the (SSNs)1, (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1, (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2, (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)3, (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)4 coating and uncoated Fresnel lens, respectively. For better comparison, the dependence of maximum and average transmittance in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm was plotted on the number of SPHSNs layers, and the results are shown in Fig. 6b. Clearly, both the maximum and average transmittance of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings decrease monotonically with increase of the number of SPHSNs layers. It is known from Fig. 4 and 5 that the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings exhibit superhydrophobicity (WCA > 150° and SA < 5°) when the number of SPHSNs layers reaches 2 or more. Hence, among the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coatings, the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating simultaneously demonstrates excellent superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective properties, which has a maximum transmittance of 99.0% and average transmittance of 98.5% in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm.Light condensation is an essential property of Fresnel lenses as optical devices. Although both superhydrophobic self-cleaning property and significant enhancement in transmittance were achieved by applying (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 on Fresnel lens, which are highly desired for practical applications, the coating must not significantly affect its light condensation performance. It could be verified by measuring the focal length (f) and the power ratio (r) of the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coated Fresnel lens (Fig. 2). The power ratio is defined as the ratio of the power at the focal point (Pf) to the power of incident light (Pin) (r = Pf/Pin). For the purpose of comparison, uncoated Fresnel lens and the (SSNs)1 coated Fresnel lens were also measured, and the results are all listed in Table 1. Apparently, by applying the (SSNs)1 or (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating, the focal length of Fresnel lens hardly changed, but the power ratio presented a higher value than that of uncoated Fresnel lens, and the trend of the power ratios agrees well with that of the transmission spectra. Therefore, it could be concluded that the nanostructured coatings have improved the light condensation efficiency of Fresnel lens without significantly changing its focal length. It is probably due to the fact that the nanoscale coatings are too thin to affect the condensation performance, but they significantly enhance the transmittance of Fresnel lens according to the transmission spectra in Fig. 6.

Surface morphology and its relationship with wetting and optical propertiesAs discussed above, the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coatings endow Fresnel lenses with both superhydrophobicity and enhanced transmittance. The surface morphology and structure of these coatings were investigated by SEM and AFM, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. SEM images in Fig. 7a–c show the surface morphology and structure of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n = 2, 3, 4) coatings on Fresnel lenses, respectively. For better comparison, their magnified images are provided in Fig. 7d–f. The SEM images clearly reveal that the surfaces are covered with a dense SSNs (ca. 16 nm) layer as in the previous work,5 on top of which is covered a layer of larger SPHSNs (ca. 53 nm). When increasing the number of spray-cycles, the SPHSNs assembly changes from random to non-close-packed to close-packed. Additionally, the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)3 coating (see Fig. 7b and e) has a few second layer SPHSNs on top of the first SPHSNs layer, and the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)4 coating (see Fig. 7c and f) appears to have much more second layer SPHSNs. The increase in the SPHSNs density would contribute to the difference in surface topography and roughness, and eventually to the increase of WCAs as shown in Fig. 4. The SEM images of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1 coating in Fig. S2 in the ESI† show that the SPHSNs are too sparse to form a layer. This may account for the observation that the WCA of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)1 coating is much lower than those of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coatings. Fig. 7  SEM (a–f) and AFM (g–i) images of (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 (a, d and g), (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)3 (b, e and h) and (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)4 (c, f and i) coatings, respectively. (d–f) are the magnified images of (a–c). The RMS roughness of (g–i) is 18.0, 19.7 and 34.6 nm, respectively, from each full image area (2 μm × 2 μm). The (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n (n ≥ 2) coatings were further observed by AFM (Fig. 7g–i). The surface topography and structure revealed by AFM observations agree well with those by SEM observations. In addition, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was estimated to be ca. 18.0 nm, 19.7 nm and 34.6 nm, respectively, for the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2, (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)3 and (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)4 coatings, suggesting that the surface roughness increases with increase of the number of spray-cycles.The surface roughness would significantly influence the wetting property as revealed by the Wenzel model.39 In the Wenzel model, the apparent WCA, θ, on a rough surface is defined as:cosθ = rcosθ0where r is the roughness factor and θ0 is the equilibrium contact angle on a flat surface or the Young's contact angle. On a hydrophobic surface (θ0 > 90°), θ is increased by a higher surface roughness. Herein, the increase in surface roughness from Fig. 7g–i is in good agreement with the water contact angle observations in Fig. 4.In addition to the wettability, optical properties also rely heavily on the surface morphology and structure. It is known from previous works44–47 that excellent antireflective property can be achieved by a single-layer coating of refractive index nc = (na × ns)1/2, where na is the refractive index of air (na = 1.00) and ns is the refractive index of substrate (here the substrate is PMMA Fresnel lens, ns = 1.49). Thus, the refractive index of coating should be 1.22 to achieve excellent antireflective property. As there are no existing bulk materials that possess such a low refractive index,48 nanoporous coatings were produced by assembling SSNs and SPHSNs (see Fig. 3) on Fresnel lenses in the current work. The transmission spectra in Fig. 6 and the power ratio in Table 1 indicate that the as-prepared nanostructured coatings have excellent optical property, i.e., they are broadband antireflective without changing their light condensation performance. Yet the transmission spectra of the coated Fresnel lenses differ in profile or intensity from each other. The film optical theory44,47–50 suggests that the profile and intensity of film transmission spectra are affected by the properties of film layers, such as their refractive index, thickness, and number of layers (if it is a multilayer), etc. The SEM and AFM images (Fig. 7) indicate that the increase of spray-cycles would increase the density of SPHSNs on top of the SSNs layer on the substrate surface, which could account for the diversity of the transmission spectra in Fig. 6 from the film optical theory.44,48–50 To simplify the discussion, assuming that the as-prepared nanostructured coatings are homogeneous composite films, their theoretical refractive indices (nc) were calculated,47 and the results are listed in Table 2. Clearly, the refractive index keeps increasing when the number of SPHSNs spray-cycles increases from 0 to 4. The change of the transmission spectra from the (SSNs)1 coating to the (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)n coating should be attributed to the addition of SPHSNs, which are slightly harmful to transmittance.31 When the SPHSNs density increases from Fig. 7a, d and g to Fig. 7b, e and h to Fig. 7c, f and i, the corresponding transmittance decreases likewise (see Fig. 6).

ConclusionsIn summary, superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective coatings were successfully fabricated on Fresnel lenses via assembling hydrophilic solid and hydrophobic hollow silica nanoparticles without any high temperature pre- or post-treatments. The solid and hollow silica nanoparticles hierarchically cover the surfaces of Fresnel lenses, thus, providing the necessary surface roughness to form superhydrophobic surfaces. The (SSNs)1/(SPHSNs)2 coating simultaneously demonstrates excellent superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective properties with a maximum transmittance of 99.0% and an average transmittance of 98.5% in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, and robust and stable superhydrophobicity toward water droplets impact and varied pH values and over storage time. What's more, the nanostructured coatings improve the light condensation efficiency of Fresnel lens without significantly changing its focal length. The current work has doubtlessly demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of coating approach to fabricate superhydrophobic self-cleaning and antireflective coatings on Fresnel lenses. The spin/spray assembling method used is facile and the conditions used are mild so that it could be easily extended to practical applications where high-temperature pre- or post-treatments are not feasible (e.g., PMMA Fresnel lenses).AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (Grant Nos.
