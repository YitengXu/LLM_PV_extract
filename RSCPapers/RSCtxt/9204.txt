    , Accepted 5th November 2013First published on 8th November 2013AbstractEarth-abundant and nontoxic pyrite iron disulfide (FeS2) is very promising for photovoltaic applications but the phase purity and the morphology of iron pyrite nanocrystals (NCs) have a significant impact on the solar cell performance. In this work, we systematically investigated reaction conditions and the local chemical environment on the phase purity and morphology of iron pyrite NCs synthesized via the hot injection method. By using different solvents to dissolve iron and sulfur agents, varying reactant concentrations, and adding trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or 1,2-hexadecanediol (Diol) into the reaction solution, iron pyrite short, branched and chromosome-like rods were obtained with a diameter of ∼10 nm and a length of ∼20–30 nm as well as quasi-cubic NC agglomerates with a size of ∼200 nm. Our experimental results show that the molar ratio of sulfur to iron and the reaction temperature are two critical factors in determining the crystalline phase of the synthesized materials. A mechanism involving the generation of H2S is proposed to explain the phase purity observed. The as-synthesized iron pyrite NCs can be dispersed well in chloroform, chlorobenzene, toluene, and hexane and thus are promising in solution-processable photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Earth-abundant and nontoxic iron pyrite (FeS2) is very promising for photovoltaic applications because of its adequate bandgap (0.95 eV) and high light absorption (α > 105 cm−1 for hν > 1.3 eV). According to the Shockley–Queisser estimate, a maximum of 28% theoretical photovoltaic efficiency could be achieved by iron pyrite solar cells.1
Iron pyrite photoelectrochemical and Schottky solar cells were first demonstrated by Tributsch in 1984.2 High quantum efficiencies (>90%) and photocurrents (>40 mA cm−2) were reported. Recently, iron pyrite nanocrystals (NCs) have been used to prepare hybrid polymer–pyrite3–5 and all inorganic pyrite–quantum dot (QD)6 solar cells. Hybrid poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)–pyrite NC bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells showed extended red light harvesting up to 900 nm resulting from the pyrite NCs.3 Blending pyrite NCs in the P3HT:phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layer demonstrated increased photocurrent of the ternary BHJ solar cells compared to those without pyrite NCs.4,5 Inverted hybrid BHJ solar cells based on pyrite NCs in P3HT:PCBM showed an average 28% increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE), after air exposure, over the control binary device with no pyrite NCs.4 All inorganic nano-heterojunction solar cells prepared by mixing pyrite NCs with CdS QDs were also explored and a large photovoltage of 0.79 V and a PCE of 1.1% under the AM 1.5 illumination were demonstrated.6 However, one report showed that no photoresponse and no rectification were observed in any of the pyrite NC-based solar cells with varying architectures, including Schottky barrier, depleted heterojunction, and conventional hybrid BHJ structures.7 Besides being involved in the active layer of solar cells, pyrite NCs were explored to be used as catalytic electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to replace Pt.8 A PCE as high as 7.31% and a remarkable electrochemical stability of greater than 500 consecutive cycle scans were achieved.
The cubic pyrite phase (space group Pa3) is by far the most abundant of the iron disulfides.9 The Fe atoms are octahedrally coordinated to six sulfur atoms and are at the corners and face centers of the cubic unit cell, while the sulfur atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated to three iron atoms and one sulfur atom. The axes of the S2 dumb-bells are aligned along the four equivalent 〈111〉 directions. Trace amounts of impure phases (e.g., marcasite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) with a bandgap of 0.34 eV and 0.04 eV, respectively) were attributed to the low open circuit voltage (<200 mV) observed in some fabricated devices.1 In addition, the size and morphology of semiconductor NCs influence the performance of BHJ solar cells.10–13 Thus, synthesis of iron pyrite NCs with high phase purity and controlled morphology is crucial for photovoltaic applications.1,2,14
Solution-based synthesis is a robust method that can provide pyrite materials with various sizes, shapes and surface states. Generally, pyrite crystals larger than 100 nm are synthesized via a hydro/solvothermal process in an autoclave.15–19 Pyrite NCs with sizes below 100 nm are typically synthesized via the hot injection method by injecting a sulfur source into a heated iron source with one or two capping agents. The synthesis of 10–20 nm spherical pyrite NCs using the hot injection method was first demonstrated by Law's group.20 Pyrite NCs were obtained by injecting the sulfur diphenyl ether (DPE) solution into the iron chloride (FeCl2) octadecylamine (ODA) complex at 220 °C and performing the reaction at 220 °C for 3 h. Ren's group modified this procedure by varying the injection temperature and adding a second injection of the FeCl2–ODA complex but performing the reaction at 220 °C for 90 min.21 Pyrite NCs with spherical, popcorn-like, and cubic shapes were obtained with the size of ∼30 to ∼220 nm. They also used different iron agents and found that thin and thick two dimensional sheets were formed when iron(II) acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)2) and iron(0) pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) were used, respectively. Oleylamine (OLA) was reported as the solvent to dissolve both the iron source and the sulfur source.22 Pyrite nanodendrites and clusters of nanocubes were formed with high (four times the low concentration) and low concentrations of the reactant, respectively, by the reaction between a sulfur OLA solution and an FeCl2–OLA solution at 220 °C for 20 min. Additional surface capping agents or co-solvents, such as 1,2-hexadecanediol (Diol),3 trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO),23 ethylenediamine,24 or 1-hexadecanesulfonate,25 were added into the reaction solution to achieve better surface passivation or to direct the formation of specific morphologies. Well dispersed pyrite NCs were synthesized by injecting an OLA solution of sulfur into an OLA solution of FeCl2 with Diol as an additional capping agent.3 The solar cell constructed by using these NCs showed extended red light harvesting. Pyrite cubic-like NCs (∼60–200 nm) synthesized by injecting an OLA solution of sulfur into an OLA solution of FeCl2 with TOPO demonstrated high air stability, which was attributed to the possible formation of O–Fe and P–S bonds between TOPO and pyrite NC surfaces to prevent oxidation.23 Recently, pyrite nanocubes with {100} facets and <50 nm size were successfully synthesized via a procedure including the high temperature (250 °C) nucleation in the solvent of hexadecylamine and a S:Fe molar ratio of 6:1 followed by two steps of crystal growth at 200 °C in the co-solvent of hexadecylamine and oleylamine and a reduced S:Fe molar ratio of 2.05.26 A strategy of using an uncommon ligand, 1-hexadecanesulfonate, also demonstrated the success in growing cubic pyrite NCs.25 Despite the recent progress in the synthesis of pyrite NCs, thorough investigations are required in order to understand the reaction mechanisms and key parameters in determining the phase purity and morphology of pyrite NCs.
In this work, we demonstrated that short, branched, and chromosome-like nanorods versus quasi-cubic NC agglomerates can be synthesized by carefully controlling the reaction conditions including solvents, reactant concentrations, and capping agents. We further varied the molar ratio of sulfur to iron and the reaction temperature and showed that the phase of the synthesized products was significantly influenced by these two parameters. Our experimental results suggest that these parameters affected the generation of H2S gas produced by sulfur and amine, which played a critical role in the phase of final products. The present study sheds light on the growth mechanism and the possible means to control the morphology of pyrite NCs. Pyrite NCs with different morphologies and surface passivation can be used as model systems for the study of crystalline structures and surface chemical and structural properties on the electronic and optical properties of pyrite NCs in order to improve the physical properties of pyrite NCs for efficient photovoltaic conversion.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were used as received. FeCl2·4H2O (99.99%), chloroform (≥99.8%), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%) and sulfur powder (99.98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, while oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), octadecylamine (ODA, 90%) and diphenyl ether (DPE, 99%) were obtained from Acros. Ethanol (200 Proof, 100%) was obtained from Decon Labs, Inc. and 1,2-hexadecanediol (Diol, >98.0% (GC)) was purchased from TCI America.
Synthesis of pyrite NCs
All synthesis conditions are listed in Table 1. The typical reaction was carried out as follows. FeCl2·4H2O (0.2010 g, 1.0 mmol) was mixed with ODA (10.0 g, 37.1 mmol) (or OLA (8.1 g, 10.0 mL, 30.4 mmol)) to form the Fe–ODA (or Fe–OLA) complex under the conditions of degassing with N2 for 1 h at 120 °C in a three-neck flask. In a separate tube, an injection solution consisting of sulfur (0.1922 g, 6.0 mmol) in DPE (5.4 g, 5 mL) was degassed with N2 at 70 °C for 1 h. The molar ratio of sulfur to iron was 6:1. The injection solution was added to the iron source solution using a syringe and the reaction mixture was kept at 120 °C for 30 min. The temperature of the reaction solution was then raised to 220 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by removing the heating mantle and allowing the reaction solution to cool naturally. Once the temperature fell below 100 °C, 5 mL of chloroform was injected into the solution to prevent ODA from solidifying. The product was separated from the reaction mixture by precipitation using ethanol. The precipitate was further purified by washing with chloroform–ethanol mixtures (1:9 v/v). Subsequent addition of chloroform followed by centrifugation at 4400 rpm for 5 min removed the large NCs and any residues of side products from the product suspension. The redispersion and precipitation were repeated three times.

For the synthesis using OLA to dissolve sulfur, 0.2010 g (1.0 mmol) FeCl2·4H2O was dissolved in 10.0 mL OLA and the injection solution consisted of 0.1922 g (6.0 mmol) sulfur powder in 5.0 mL OLA. A reduced concentration, i.e. 0.1005 g (0.5 mmol) FeCl2·4H2O in 10.0 mL OLA and 0.0961 g (3.0 mmol) sulfur powder in 5.0 mL OLA, was also applied to the synthesis. The other procedures and conditions were kept the same as aforementioned.
For the synthesis with an additive, 1.1599 g of TOPO or 0.1290 g of Diol was added to ODA (10.0 g, 37.1 mmol) (or OLA (8.1 g, 10.0 mL, 30.4 mmol)) to dissolve FeCl2·4H2O and the mixture was degassed with N2 at 120 °C for 1 h in a three-neck flask before the injection of the sulfur solution. The rest of the synthesis and purification steps were the same as aforementioned.
Reactions were also conducted under the following conditions as summarized in Table 1. The molar ratio of sulfur to iron was reduced to 4:1 and 2:1 (sulfur (0.1281 g, 4.0 mmol):FeCl2·4H2O (0.2010 g, 1.0 mmol) and sulfur (0.0641 g, 2.0 mmol):FeCl2·4H2O (0.2010 g, 1.0 mmol)), respectively. Or, the concentration of sulfur and iron sources was reduced by half. Or, the reaction was conducted at 120 and 250 °C.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Spot size 9 was applied for STEM measurement and a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector was used to collect images. The samples for TEM/STEM analysis were prepared by drop casting a dilute solution of NCs in chloroform onto ultrathin carbon-coated copper grids. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) images were generated by ImageJ 1.45 S. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out on a GADDS D8 Discover diffractometer (Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å). Three frames with 100 seconds per frame were obtained for each sample. Scan angle 2θ begins at 30 degrees with a frame width of 25 degrees. Data were processed using the EVA package provided by Bruker AXS. Raman spectra of the products were acquired using a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer attached to a Leica DMLM upright microscope. A 100× (0.75 NA) objective lens was used to focus the 514 nm laser onto the particles and to collect the back scattered light from the particles. The illuminated sample area was about 3 μm2 with a power of 1.5 mW. All spectra were collected for 10 accumulations with 10 s exposure time for each scan. Samples for XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements were prepared by dusting the vacuum dried particles on double-sided tape attached to a glass slide. UV-vis-NIR optical absorption measurements of the samples were performed on a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The hydrodynamic size of the particles was analyzed with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle sizer (Nano ZS, Zetasizer Nano, Malvern). Purified pyrite NCs dissolved in chloroform were used for UV-vis-NIR and DLS measurements.
Results and discussion
Following the typical reaction conditions, ODA and OLA were used to dissolve FeCl2·4H2O and to form the iron precursor, respectively, and sulfur powder was dissolved in DPE. The as-synthesized NCs are denoted as NC–ODA and NC–OLA. The phase purity of NC–ODA and NC–OLA was determined using powder XRD and Raman spectroscopy. All the XRD peaks (Fig. 1A) can be assigned to the pure cubic pyrite phase of FeS2 with a lattice constant of a = 5.416 Å (compared to JSPDS file no. 42-1340). No other iron–sulfur related phases, such as marcasite (FeS2), pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS), troilite (FeS), or greigite (Fe3S4), were observed. Raman spectroscopy provides the phonon vibrational modes of crystalline materials, which is very sensitive to their phase and composition, and therefore, was also applied to confirm the phase purity of NC–ODA and NC–OLA. Fig. 1B shows Raman peaks at 340, 376, and 425 cm−1 for both products that match well with the reported values for the Eg, Ag, and Tg modes of pyrite FeS2,27 respectively, indicating the high phase purity of the products. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD and Raman peaks of NC–ODA is narrower than those of NC–OLA, indicating better crystallinity of NC–ODA.

The hydrodynamic radius of NC–ODA and NC–OLA was determined using DLS by dispersing NCs in chloroform. The radius of a nonspherical particle is determined as the radius of a sphere that has the same translational diffusion speed as the spherical particle. Fig. 1C and D show that the peak positions of the NC radii are 14.4 and 25.2 nm for NC–ODA and NC–OLA, respectively. NC–OLA has a broader size distribution than NC–ODA. To utilize these NCs for solution processable device fabrication, it is desired that they can be well suspended in different organic solvents. The DLS results show that the as-synthesized NC–ODA pyrite NCs in chlorobenzene, toluene, and hexane have similar peak positions and size distributions to those in chloroform but an additional large aggregation around 100–200 nm in pyridine.
The optical properties of NC–ODA and NC–OLA dispersed in chloroform were investigated by UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. The synthesized pyrite NCs have the absorption extended to the near infrared region (>900 nm) as shown in the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra (Fig. 2A). The indirect bandgap and the first and second direct transitions were estimated by plotting (αhν)nversus hν with n = 1/2 and 2, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). The indirect bandgap was obtained to be 1.24 and 1.16 eV for NC–ODA and NC–OLA, respectively. The first and second direct transitions were 2.24 and 2.94 eV for NC–ODA and 1.97 and 2.90 eV for NC–OLA. We noticed that the indirect bandgap of pyrite NCs was larger compared to that of bulk pyrite. This phenomenon was also observed by several other groups.3,7,26,28 The size dependence of the bandgap of semiconductor nanocrystals has been observed in other semiconductor materials and the lowest electronic transition can be related to the size of the semiconductor NCs using the following equation:29 (1)where Ebulkg is the bulk bandgap, R is the radius of the NCs, h is Planck's constant 6.63 × 10−34 J s, and m*h and m*e are the effective hole and electron mass, respectively. For pyrite, Ebulkg = 0.95 eV, m*h = 2.2me and m*e = 0.25me are obtained from the literature.14 The calculated indirect bandgap as a function of NC radius is plotted in Fig. 2D. The bandgap exponentially decays with the increase of the NC radius. The calculated indirect bandgaps are 1.27 and 1.05 eV for NCs with R = 14.4 and 25.2 nm, which are the average sizes of NC–ODA and NC–OLA determined by DLS, respectively. The small errors between the calculated and experimental values of the indirect bandgap may be caused by the non-spherical feature of the NCs. The first and second direct transitions have been previously studied experimentally by analyzing band-edge absorption of cubic pyrite NCs26 and theoretically from density functional theory (DFT) calculations.30 Our estimated values of the first direct transition of both NC–ODA and NC–OLA pyrite NCs are close to those determined experimentally (1.9 eV)26 and theoretically (2.1 eV).30 The values of the second direct transition of both pyrite NCs are close to the experimental value (3.0 eV)26 but smaller than the theoretical value (3.5 eV).30 This difference in the second direct transition is ascribed to the ambiguity of the appropriate level of absorption in this energy region.26

The morphology of NC–ODA and NC–OLA pyrite NCs was examined using TEM and STEM. Fig. 3A shows the TEM image of NC–ODA pyrite NCs which are dominated by short rods (∼8 nm in diameter and ∼20 nm in length) and rods with kinks and branches (∼8 nm in diameter and ∼30 nm in length). Compared to the previous synthesis,20 we doubled the concentration of both iron and sulfur reagents while keeping the S:Fe molar ratio the same, i.e. 6:1. More anisotropic NCs were obtained by using a higher concentration of reactants after reaction for 2 h. The elongation of nanocrystals induced by increasing concentration of reactants has also been observed in the synthesis of CdSe NCs.31 The anisotropic growth of CdSe along a kinetically favorable crystalline direction is promoted by the high local reactant concentration. The rod-type pyrite NCs were also observed in the products of NC–OLA as shown in the TEM image of Fig. 3B. However, the NC–OLA pyrite NCs are mainly curved and chromosome-like rods with smaller diameters. By counting 200 NCs, the average branch diameter of NC–OLA is about 2–3 nm smaller than that of NC–ODA. STEM images (Fig. 3C and D) also show the difference between these two types of pyrite NCs. The NC–ODA pyrite NCs are separated, individual nanorods, while the NC–OLA pyrite NCs are branched, chromosome-like nanorods and form clusters. The morphological difference of NC–ODA and NC–OLA may be caused by the different passivation density and orientation of ODA and OLA on the NC surface as well as the different interactions between aliphatic chains during the course of the growth. Both OLA and ODA have an 18-carbon chain but OLA has a double bond in the middle of the chain and has a cis configuration. A single OLA chain occupies a larger steric space than a single ODA chain. Both OLA and ODA bind iron atoms via the N–Fe interaction. The rotation of the octahedra formed by the six bonds of each iron atom at the corners and the face centers of the cubic unit cell (Scheme 1) makes it energetically unfavorable to passivate the same number of iron atoms with OLA compared to ODA. The packing of OLA on the NC surface was thus not expected to be strong, well ordered, or dense enough. The high-energy or poorly covered facets then favor an oriented attachment.22,32 Meanwhile, after injection of the sulfur source and increasing the temperature to 220 °C, a higher concentration of H2S caused by the vulcanization process33,34 between sulfur and the double bond of OLA could also favor the growth of branched structures.35 Thus, using OLA as a solvent leads to the growth of pyrite NCs with more branches, chromosome-like shapes and poorer crystallinity compared to NCs synthesized using ODA as a solvent.

In the synthesis of pyrite NCs using FeCl2·4H2O and sulfur powder with the hot injection method, both DPE and OLA have been used to dissolve sulfur powder.20–22 We investigated the effect of the solvent used to dissolve sulfur on the morphology of pyrite NCs. We conducted the experiment by using OLA to dissolve both sulfur and iron agents. While keeping the molar ratio of sulfur to iron 6:1, the concentrations were 6 mmol sulfur powder in 5.0 mL OLA and 1.0 mmol FeCl2·4H2O in 10.0 mL OLA. These concentrations are the same as those for the synthesis of NC–ODA and NC–OLA but doubled compared to those reported in the previous studies.3,20,22,23 The product is noted as 2C. Unlike the curved and chromosome-like nanorods of NC–OLA pyrite NCs shown in Fig. 3B and D, the TEM images in Fig. 4A and C show that the product has a smaller size with mixed spherical and short and curved-rod-like shapes. The crystal structure of the product is pure pyrite as shown by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in the inset of Fig. 4A. We also investigated the concentration effect. We reduced the concentrations of the reactants to half, i.e., 3 mmol sulfur in 5.0 mL OLA and 0.5 mmol FeCl2·4H2O in 10.0 mL OLA. The product is noted as 1C. The TEM images in Fig. 4B and D show quasi-cubic NC agglomerates formed by the attachment of single cube-like NCs. The SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 4B shows that the product is pure pyrite. The HRTEM image in Fig. 4E shows that the fringe spacing of a single cubic NC in the quasi-cubic NC agglomerates is 2.7 Å, matching the distance between the (100) planes of pyrite FeS2. Fig. 4E also shows that one edge of the NC is parallel to the (100) plane. The phase purity of the products synthesized using high and low concentrations of the reactants was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 4F. One reason for the production of the quasi-cubic NC agglomerates with well defined {100} facets could be ascribed to the generation of local sulfur-lean spots when the concentration is halved.36 Using OLA to dissolve iron and sulfur agents was reported before.22 Although the iron source was stirred at 100 °C and the reaction took place at 220 °C for 20 min, which were different from our procedures, similar quasi-cubic NC agglomerates and nanodendrites with elongated hyperbranches were obtained when the concentrations of the reactants were close to 1C and 4C, respectively, and the S:Fe molar ratio was kept as 6:1. This trend is in concord with our observations that higher concentrations lead to elongated NCs with branches.

(B and D) TEM and (E) HRTEM images of the pyrite NCs synthesized by using OLA as the solvent but the concentrations of the reactants were noted as 1C. (F) Raman spectra of the synthesized pyrite NCs with the reactant concentrations of 1C and 2C, respectively. 
While ODA and OLA not only function as a solvent but also a capping agent to iron atoms via the interaction between Fe and N, we added an additional capping agent in the reaction to investigate their effects on both the morphology and phase purity of the products. The results are summarized in Table 1. When TOPO was added to the iron ODA solution while all the other conditions were the same as for the synthesis of NC–ODA, the TEM images show a similar morphology but with more facets (Fig. 5A and B) compared to NC–ODA (Fig. 3A). The peak position and size distribution of the radius of the NCs determined by DLS is 14.4 nm with a PDI of 0.2 (Fig. 5C), which is close to the size of NC–ODA without TOPO (14.4 nm with a PDI of 0.2, Fig. 1C). The product was the pure pyrite phase determined by XRD (Fig. 5D). We investigated the chemical states of the iron and sulfur atoms at the surface of these NCs using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and found more oxidized iron compared to those without adding TOPO.4 This leads to the rise of the conduction band energy from −4.5 to −3.9 eV. These pyrite NCs were blended with P3HT and PCBM to make the inverted BHJ solar cells, which showed enhanced photocurrent and high air stability.4 While all the reaction conditions were the same, simply changing the solvent from ODA to OLA to dissolve the iron agent, the dominating phase in the product was greigite (Fe3S4) with only a trace amount of the pyrite phase as shown in Fig. 5D. The product with pure pyrite can be restored by replacing DPE with OLA to dissolve sulfur while keeping OLA plus TOPO or Diol as the solvent to dissolve the iron source (Fig. 6A). The products appear to have better crystallinity indicated by the narrower XRD peaks, which is mainly due to the relatively large (60–200 nm) quasi-cubic NC agglomerates (Fig. 6B and C). The possible mechanisms will be discussed later.

We then investigated the reaction conditions that influence the phase purity. We first varied the molar ratio of sulfur to iron. Under the same reaction conditions as the synthesis of NC–ODA but by reducing the molar ratio of sulfur to iron from 6:1 to 4:1, the XRD pattern in Fig. 7A shows that a trace amount of the greigite (Fe3S4) phase exists in the product besides the pyrite phase. The narrower XRD peaks are due to larger crystals (∼300–500 nm) (Fig. 7C). Further reducing this ratio to 2:1, the XRD pattern in Fig. 7A shows that only the greigite (Fe3S4) and pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) phases are in the product and no pyrite phase.
 Fig. 7  (A) XRD patterns of the products synthesized under the same conditions as those for NC–ODA but with lower molar ratio of sulfur to iron from 6:1 to 4:1 and 2:1, respectively. The XRD peaks belong to pyrite (FeS2), greigite (Fe3S4), and pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) and are marked as P, G and Pht, respectively. (B) XRD patterns of the products synthesized under the same conditions as those for NC–ODA but at 250 and 120 °C, respectively. (C and D) TEM images of the products synthesized with the molar ratio of sulfur to iron as 4:1 and 2:1, respectively. The pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) phase NCs are shown as the hexagonal plates indicated by the white arrows for example. 
The TEM image in Fig. 7D shows some ∼100 nm hexagonal plates in the product, which could be the pyrrhotite phase NCs.37–40 It appears that excess sulfur in the reactants with a molar ratio of sulfur to iron of 6:1 is necessary to ensure the product with the pure pyrite phase. Next, we investigated the effect of reaction temperature on phase purity. We conducted the experiments using the same conditions as those for the synthesis of NC–ODA but increased and decreased the reaction temperature from 220 to 250 °C and 120 °C, respectively. The XRD pattern in Fig. 7B shows that the product synthesized at the higher reaction temperature of 250 °C for 2 h has the greigite (Fe3S4) crystalline phase with a trace amount of pyrite. The product synthesized at the lower reaction temperature of 120 °C for 2 h shows no strong peaks between the 2θ of 25 to 65°. Two peaks at lower angle of the XRD pattern may be due to the complex formed between FeCl2 and ODA.41
All of the synthesis conditions and the phase and morphology of the products are summarized in Table 1. Sulfur powder dispersed in long chain primary alkylamines, such as OLA, has been widely used as a sulfur precursor in the synthesis of metal sulfide using the hot injection method.42–44 A recent study showed that the reaction between sulfur powder and OLA could undergo four different reaction pathways, each of which produced H2S and other byproducts.45 It was found that alkylammonium polysulfides were the main products in the injection solution, which were typically prepared by mixing sulfur and OLA at a low temperature (<80 °C). Upon injecting into the hot metal precursor solutions and heating to nanocrystal growth temperatures, H2S was liberated and other byproducts were formed. Under appropriate conditions, H2S combines with the metal precursor to form metal sulfide nanocrystals. Here, in our typical reactions, we used the non-amine solvent DPE to dissolve sulfur powder. It was reported that elemental sulfur can cleave DPE to benzene, thiophenol and phenol and generate H2S but this takes place at 450 °C.46 Therefore, sulfur powder may be just dissolved in DPE at 70 °C. When the sulfur–DPE solution was injected into the iron–ODA or OLA solution and the mixture was kept stirring for 30 min at 120 °C, the reaction between sulfur and amine (and sulfur and the double bond of OLA34) could happen. A similar reaction mechanism45 could be followed when the temperature was raised to 220 °C. Therefore, having an adequate amount of H2S in the reaction solution plays a crucial role in the formation of the pyrite phase. When the molar ratio of sulfur to iron was 4:1, less H2S was generated and thus the sulfur deficient product, Fe3S4, was produced in addition to the pyrite phase. By further reducing this ratio to 2:1, the lack of H2S impeded the formation of pyrite iron disulfide and thus only greigite (Fe3S4) and pyrrhotite (Fe1−xS) were produced (Fig. 7A).
Since the amount of H2S in the reaction solution can also be affected by the reaction temperature as observed in the previous studies for CdS34 and CdSe,33 it is expected that the phase purity of the products could be affected by the reaction temperature. A higher reaction temperature (e.g. 250 °C) could cause the escape of H2S gas. This might be the reason for the final product consisting of the greigite phase with a trace amount of the pyrite phase (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, if the reaction temperature is very low (e.g., 120 °C), the reaction could remain at the stage of the formation of alkylammonium polysulfides. The incompletion of the amine and sulfur reaction could result in no or less generation of H2S gas, and thus no crystalline phase in the product (Fig. 7B).
Adding TOPO into the reaction of FeCl2·4H2O in ODA and sulfur in DPE has a different effect on the phase purity of the product as compared to adding TOPO into the reaction of FeCl2·4H2O in OLA and sulfur in DPE. The pure pyrite phase was obtained for ODA but greigite with trace pyrite for OLA (Table 1). This could be due to several factors, such as the double bond in OLA causes the slower rate of nucleophilic attack on S8 rings; the vulcanization process between sulfur and the double bond of OLA which is similar to the behavior observed in sulfur with 1-octadecence (ODE)34 and selenium with ODE;33 and the steric hindrance of TOPO and OLA. As a result, less H2S is generated. When DPE was replaced by OLA to dissolve sulfur, alkylammonium polysulfides have been formed in the injection solution. After injecting the sulfur OLA solution into the iron precursor solution and subsequently raising the temperature to 220 °C, enough H2S was generated33,34,45 to ensure the formation of the pure pyrite phase in the product. Therefore, the additional capping agent (TOPO or Diol) mainly affects the morphology of the pyrite NCs but not the phase purity of the product.
Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the morphology and phase purity of pyrite NCs synthesized via the hot injection method by varying the reaction conditions and local chemical environment. High reactant concentrations or dissolving sulfur in OLA led to the growth of elongated NCs (short, branched, and chromosome-like rods) resulting from the fast growth of the kinetically favorable direction and possible oriented attachment of high energy facets. Quasi-cubic NC agglomerates were obtained when the reactant concentration was reduced or an additional capping agent (TOPO or Diol) was added into the reaction mixture where both iron and sulfur reagents were dissolved in OLA. The molar ratio of iron to sulfur and the reaction temperature were identified as two key parameters controlling the crystalline phase of the synthesized products. A mechanism involving the generation and amount of H2S in the reaction solution can successfully explain the phase of products synthesized under different conditions. The as-synthesized pyrite NCs have absorption up to the NIR region and exhibit a slightly larger indirect bandgap than that of bulk pyrite. The present study demonstrated that the synthesis of pyrite NCs with controlled sizes, shapes, and surface states is feasible. The phase and morphology-controlled pyrite NCs make it possible to further study the optical and electronic properties of pyrite NCs and to develop pyrite NC based photovoltaic devices for sustainable energy.
