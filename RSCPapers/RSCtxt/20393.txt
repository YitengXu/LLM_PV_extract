    , Accepted 19th December 2020First published on 21st December 2020AbstractLayered semiconducting Ge4Se3Te shows unusual bonding that suggests the possibility of unusual transport that may be favorable for thermoelectrics. We investigated the electronic transport properties in relation to thermoelectricity of Ge4Se3Te using Boltzmann transport theory based on first principles calculations. We find favorable properties of transport for the bulk. Additionally, we find that both the carrier mobility and power factor may be increased through dimensional reduction. The nature of the bonding, specifically the weak anharmonic bonds, can lead to phonon scattering and low lattice thermal conductivity. This combination leads to the potential for high thermoelectric performance for the monolayer, for both p-type and n-type if the carrier concentration is optimized. Based on the results, the values as high as ZT = 2.6 at 900 K may be achievable.
Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials enable direct solid state conversion between thermal and electrical energy. They have been widely used for power generation on spacecraft and in terrestrial refrigeration applications.1,2 Recently, there has been considerable interest in potential applications for waste heat recovery and solar thermal conversion in relation to energy technology.3–5 The energy conversion efficiency is critical for the development of such applications. This is governed by the dimensionless figure of merit of the thermoelectric materials, ZT = S2σT/(κe + κl), where S, σ, T, κe and κl are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature, and electronic and lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. High ZT requires a difficult to achieve combination of transport properties due to the opposite tendency of the components of ZT in most materials, for example the contrary behavior of S and σ with respect to band mass and doping level in semiconductors. However, certain material features have been identified that favor thermoelectric performance. These are in terms of structure, electronic structure and bonding. For example, dimensional reduction is generally beneficial for the electronic part of ZT, as can be obtained in superlattices or monolayers6 and through particular bonding patterns.7 Anharmonic bonding, especially of the type characteristic of lone pairs and nearness to ferroelectricity, is favorable from the point of view of both mobility (via high dielectric constant)8 and anharmonic phonon scattering.9–13 Furthermore, certain complex band shapes have been identified as a factor that can improve electrical transport properties.14–21 Finally, it should be mentioned that nanostructuring has proven to be a useful approach for improving thermoelectric performance particularly through thermal conductivity reduction.22–26
The IV–VI compounds have long been a focus of thermoelectric research, since they exemplify several of the characteristics discussed above, particularly, lone pair activity, nearness to ferroelectricity with strongly anharmonic phonons and high dielectric constants, complex band structures and in some cases layered crystal structures.27–30 In this regard, the cubic and ferroelectrically distorted rhombohedral phases of GeTe have been shown to be excellent thermoelectrics, offering exceptionally high conversion efficiencies and experimental ZT values reaching 2.0.18,31–35 This also extends to alloys, including those related to phase change materials, such as the Ge–Sb–Te system. Among them, there are relationships between competing bonding types, low thermal conductivity and electrical behavior that are of the type favorable for thermoelectrics.36–42 Recently, a layered Ge–Te–Se phase with bonding closely related to phase change materials including the unexpected Ge–Ge bonding was reported experimentally.43 The layering suggests that it might be possible to achieve even better thermoelectric performance if this material is suitably doped. The purpose of this paper is to explore that possibility and the conditions under which it might be realized.
The hexagonal phase of GeSe1−xTex (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) was reported in the 1960s.44 As mentioned, the crystal structure of the alloy semiconductor Ge4Se3Te has been obtained experimentally43 and was found to be a layered structure (note that following experiment, we use here the notation Ge4Se3Te instead of the IUPAC nomenclature Ge4TeSe3). We use first-principles methods combined with the Boltzmann transport to investigate the thermoelectric properties of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer Ge4Se3Te is very low and is about 1.6 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature. In addition, dimensional reduction of the crystal structure by going to the monolayer is highly favorable for the electronic transport properties. The optimized ZT is estimated to be 2.6, which is approximately 30% higher than the best reported bulk GeTe value.
Computational methods and models
First principles calculations
All ab initio calculations were performed with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method, which was implemented in the VASP code.45 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) was employed for the exchange–correlation functional.46 An energy cutoff of 500 eV for the plane-wave basis set was chosen in all calculations. The atomic positions were fully relaxed with the energy convergence being 10−8 eV and the Hellmann–Feynman forces being less than 10−5 eV Å−1. A vacuum spacing of 20 Å was used for the monolayer structure to eliminate the interactions between layers.
Electrical transport
The electrical transport properties of materials were calculated based on the electronic band structure. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as47 (1) (2)with  where fμ(T, ε) is the equilibrium state Fermi–Dirac distribution function, μ is the chemical potential, εi,q is the energy eigenvalue, kB is the Boltzmann constant, να(i, q) is the group velocity along the α direction and τ(i, q) is the relaxation time of the state with wave vector q. It should be noticed that τ(i, q) is related to not only the wave vector but also the band index (i) in the electronic band structure. It is clear that the scattering rate expressed by relaxation time τ(i, q) in formula 1–2 is energy, momentum and band dependent. In addition, there are different scattering mechanisms included in reality, such as electron–phonon scattering, ionized impurity scattering and boundary scattering. These make the evaluation of relaxation time difficult. Some works have been done for considering the energy and momentum dependence of scattering times.48 The constant scattering time approximation (CSTA) assumes that the energy dependence of the band structure is more important than the energy dependence of the scattering rate, but does not require assumptions about the temperature or doping level dependencies. The CSTA has smoothened out the complexities of the band structure.48 However, it makes the evaluation of the Seebeck coefficient easy. Especially, in heavily doped semiconductors and metals, the relaxation time is found to be approximately energy independent under fixed temperature and doping level. The use of CSTA allows prediction of the Seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature and doping level directly from the band structure. Here we used the implementation in the BoltzTraP code47 for the required integrations. It has led to many successful applications to thermoelectric materials.49–51 Then in order to obtain the scattering time which is needed for the conductivity and ZT, we have assumed that electron–phonon scattering is typical in thermoelectrics, and evaluated the scattering rate by the deformation potential theory of Bardeen and Shockley.52
Thermal transport
The thermal conductivity has contributions from electronic and lattice terms, κ = κe + κl. The electronic thermal conductivity κe can be obtained approximately from the Wiedemann–Franz law,53κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number (2.45 × 10−8 W Ω K−2). This is a conservative approximation, as often the open circuit electronic thermal conductivity of importance for ZT is lower than this value.54–56 The lattice thermal conductivity can be obtained by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation combined with phonon band structure. Based on the phonon kinetic theory, the lattice thermal conductivity can be expressed as57 (3)where vg is the group velocity, τqs is the phonon lifetime of the phonon mode of wavevector q and band index s, and CV is the phonon mode specific heat capacity. This is the general Callaway expression for thermal conductivity. Except for the phonon lifetime τqs, all the terms in this expression can be directly obtained from the harmonic phonon dispersions. Here we used the real space harmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) to obtain the phonon dispersions with the Phonopy package.58 The phonon lifetime is limited by anharmonic phonon–phonon scattering. For this it is desirable to go beyond the Callaway expression and use the Boltzmann transport directly. We treated this using anharmonic third-order IFCs, specifically the finite-different approach implemented in ShengBTE.59 The lattice thermal conductivity was calculated using 3 × 5 × 1 supercells with an interaction cutoff radius up to 6 Å. We chose the half of the bulk material lattice parameter as the thickness of the monolayer Ge4Se3Te in order to describe our results for the monolayer in units suitable for comparison with the bulk.
Carrier lifetime based on deformation potential
We used the deformation potential theory52 to evaluate the carrier lifetime. In this theoretical model, the relaxation time is obtained by only considering the interactions between carriers and phonons. It is an approximate method to deal with the electron–phonon interaction which is expressed by the coupling matrix elements of electrons with phonon modes. Since this model is based on the approximation of long wavelength, there is no inter-band scattering between electrons and only the scattering with acoustic phonons is considered. With this theoretical model, the relaxation time of two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials can be expressed as60 (4)and (5)where h is Planck's constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant. m2d and m3d are the 2D and 3D average density of states effective mass, with the formulas  where m* is the effective mass along different transport directions. The elastic modulus of 2D and 3D can be obtained by checking the change of energy under small strain with the formulas C2D = (d2E/dδ2)/S0(6)and C3D = (d2E/dδ2)/V0,(7)where δ is the strain applied along the transport direction. S0 and V0 are the area of the 2D unit cell and the volume of the 3D crystal structure. The deformation potential theory assumes that the lattice potential perturbation  due to thermal motions has a linear dependence on the relative volume change . The relation is  where El is the deformation potential constant. It can be obtained from the change of band edge with respect to vacuum level using the formula El = ΔE/(Δl/l0), where ΔE is the band edge shift of the valence band maximum (VBM, for holes) or the conduction band minimum (CBM, for electrons) along the transport direction when the structure is dilated or compressed from the equilibrium lattice l0 to l0 ± Δl.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and electronic structure
Experimental results have shown that bulk Ge4Se3Te is a van der Waals (vdW) layered material.43 The Te (Se) in Ge4Se3Te is replaced with Se (Te) to obtain the binary compound GeSe (Te). This compound GeSe (Te) has a hexagonal layered structure with four atomic layers composed of Q-Ge–Ge-Q (Q is Se or Te). The unit cell includes two Ge atoms and two Se atoms, with space group P63mc. Often monolayer materials can be obtained from bulk structures if the structures are stacked by layers with vdW interactions. The calculated exfoliation energy of GeSe is 0.21 J m−2, which is less than that (0.37 J m−2) of graphite,61 and indicates that monolayer GeSe can be exfoliated from the bulk structure.
We can expand the hexagonal cell structure of monolayer Ge2Se2 into a rectangular cell (Ge4Se4) and replace one of the Se atoms in the first sublayer with Te to construct a unit cell structure of monolayer Ge4Se3Te. The bulk structure of Ge4Se3Te is that which can be obtained from AB stacking of monolayer Ge4Se3Te, as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The black box represents the corresponding unit cell, and x and y represent two different directions in the layer plane. Due to the weak interlayer interaction, we included the vdW interaction during the structural optimization. The optimized lattice parameters were a = 6.71 Å, b = 3.87 Å, and c = 16.00 Å. The optimized lattice parameters of the monolayer were a = 6.72 Å and b = 3.88 Å.

Fig. 2a and b show the band structures of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te, respectively. They are both indirect band gap semiconductors and with band gaps of 0.49 eV and 0.16 eV at the PBE level, respectively. The conduction band minimum (CBM) of the monolayer structure is at the Γ point, and the valence band maximum (VBM) is on Γ–Y. The CBM of the bulk structure is also at the Γ point, and the VBM is characterized by near degenerate maxima in the Γ–Y and Γ–M directions. Fig. 2c shows the isoenergy surfaces of monolayer Ge4Se3Te at energies of 0.1 and 0.2 eV above the CBM and at energies of 0.1 and 0.2 eV below the VBM, respectively. Isoenergy surfaces of bulk Ge4Se3Te are shown in Fig. 2d.

The blue surfaces denote the lowest conduction band with energies of 0.1 eV and 0.2 eV higher than the CBM (at Γ point), and the red surfaces denote the highest valence band with energies of 0.1 eV and 0.2 eV lower than the VBM (at Σ point in monolayer and Λ point in bulk). 
For monolayer Ge4Se3Te, n-type doping will result in a single pocket located at the Γ point for light doping. However, with increasing dopant concentration, as seen from the isoenergy surface 0.2 eV above the CBM, another pocket appears at the M point. This two band characteristic is often favorable for thermoelectric performance as was discussed previously for p-type filled skutterudites62 and n-type La3Te4.51 Similar to the monolayer, the n-type bulk also shows the two-band characteristic. The p-type material also shows an interesting complex band structure. Specifically, the monolayer VBM shows multiple isosurfaces, which can be favorable for thermoelectric performance. Importantly, note the complex shapes of the carrier pockets, which are far from being the isotropic circles and spheres characteristic of a single isotropic parabolic band model.
Thermoelectric transport

Fig. 3 shows the Seebeck coefficients as a function of carrier concentration at different temperatures for monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te. As normal, when the carrier concentration increases, S gradually decreases, while S increases as the temperature increases at high carrier concentration. The directional anisotropy in S is small, similar to most semiconductors. It should also be noted that for both doping signs there is evident bipolar reduction of S at high temperatures (900 K) for low doping levels (below ∼5 × 1012 cm−2). These bipolar effects begin at lower temperatures for the bulk due to the smaller band gap.
 Fig. 3  Calculated S of n-type (a and c) and p-type (b and d) of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te as a function of carrier concentration along x and y directions, respectively. 
For the p-type doping, the Seebeck coefficient of the monolayer is higher than that of the bulk. With the bipolar effect at temperature more than 600 K, the maximum magnitude |S| is about 300 μV K−1 for the monolayer, while the maximum magnitude in bulk Ge4Se3Te is about 165 μV K−1. Turning to n-type doping, the maximum magnitude of S for the monolayer is about 285 μV K−1 at a carrier concentration of 5 × 1012 cm−2 and in the bulk it is 265 μV K−1 with a carrier concentration of 6.5 × 1019 cm−3.
In Fig. S1 (ESI†), we show the σ/τ of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te as a function of carrier concentration at different temperatures. In a single parabolic band model the conductivity, σ ∝ nτ(m*)−1, σ/τ is inversely proportional to the effective mass. However, the transport mass and density of states mass are not the same for complex band structures, and furthermore these quantities can depend on both temperature and doping level in such cases. Nonetheless, for monolayer Ge4Se3Te, on account of the smaller electron effective mass at the CBM (in Table 1), the n-type doping does yield larger σ/τ compared with the p-type counterpart (in Fig. S1a and b, ESI†), so the qualitative expectation of the single parabolic band model holds. For the bulk, the p-type σ/τ is similar to that for the n-type (in Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). It may be noted that with the increase of temperature, the value of σ/τ in the bulk increases at low concentration, which is consistent with a bipolar effect.

The relaxation time is important to understand the conductivity σ and power factor S2σ. In thermoelectrics, acoustic phonon scattering is often the main scattering mechanism. Here we evaluate the lifetime of carriers in monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te with this scattering mechanism by the deformation potential model. The calculated effective masses, deformation potential constant and carrier mobility of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te along x and y directions are listed in Table 1.
Compared with the monolayer, the strong interlayer coupling in bulk Ge4Se3Te leads to a large deformation potential constant and thus a smaller carrier mobility in the x–y plane. In Table 1, it is also noticed that the electron/hole effective mass along the y direction is much larger than that along the x and z directions. This indicates the obvious anisotropy of electronic transport. Interestingly, for the monolayer the deformation potential constant is lower, which implies better carrier mobility (see Table 1). In monolayer Ge4Se3Te, the maximum mobilities of holes and electrons are 516 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the y direction and 1087 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x direction, respectively.
Based on these basic parameters, we can obtain the relaxation time from formulas 4–5. In Fig. 4, the relaxation times are plotted as a function of temperature for electrons and holes along different transport directions. The relaxation time of monolayer (Fig. 4a) is much larger than that of bulk Ge4Se3Te (Fig. 4b). The electrical transport properties can be obtained with these relaxation times. The electronic conductivity and power factor are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 5, respectively. Compared with the bulk Ge4Se3Te, the larger carrier relaxation time of the monolayer leads to higher electronic conductivity, whether for the p-type doping or n-type doping. Also, in the case of the monolayer, the electronic conductivity for the n-type is superior to that of the p-type (see Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). Fig. 5 shows the power factor of monolayer and bulk Ge4Se3Te. It clearly shows that the maximum power factor of the monolayer material is higher than that of the bulk. It is due to the longer carrier lifetime and the favorable band structure of the monolayer. For the p-type doped monolayer (in Fig. 5b), the high conductivity is in the y direction. At 300 K, the optimized power factors are 18 mW m−1 K−2 along the y direction and 7.9 mW m−1 K−2 along the x direction. As normal, the electronic conductivity decreases with temperature and the Seebeck increases. It is also noteworthy that there is a strong anisotropy in the power factor, as shown in Fig. 5a, especially for n-type. This comes from the anisotropy in conductivity. The power factors along the x and y directions are 20.9 mW m−1 K−2 and 3.5 mW m−1 K−2 for n-type doping, respectively. We note that the power factors in monolayer Ge4Se3Te are very high and comparable to that of monolayer materials reported in the literature, such as monolayer SnSe (20 mW m−1 K−2)63 and monolayer GeAs2 (14 mW m−1 K−2)64 from theoretical calculations, and bulk material Bi2Te3 (4.5 mW m−1 K−2)23 from experiment. Of course, the other scattering mechanisms beyond acoustic phonon scattering, such as optical phonon scattering and ionized impurity scattering, are ignored in the calculations, and this maybe results in the overestimation of the power factor. In any case, these results indicate that thin film Ge4Se3Te may have better thermoelectric performance than the bulk depending on the thermal transport.

Thermal transport and ZT values
According to the Wiedemann–Franz law,53 the electronic thermal conductivity κe is proportional to the electrical conductivity σ at a specific temperature. It is clear that κe of n-type doping (Fig. S3b, ESI†) is larger than that of p-type (Fig. S3a, ESI†) for monolayer Ge4Se3Te due to the higher conductivity of n-type. This is a favorable situation. For the n-type doping, the κe at 300 K are 2.1 W m−1 K−1 and 3.8 W m−1 K−1 along x and y directions at a carrier concentration of 1013 cm−2, respectively.

Fig. 6a shows the calculated phonon dispersion and phonon density of states of monolayer Ge4Se3Te. There are no imaginary phonon modes. This indicates that this structure is dynamically stable. The lattice thermal conductivity κl is shown in Fig. 6d. It decreases with the increase in temperature as normal which along with the increase in S favors enhanced ZT at high temperature. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer Ge4Se3Te is 1.6 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and reduces to 0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 900 K. This can be compared with many traditional thermoelectric materials, such as bulk SnSe (0.62 W m−1 K−1),65 SbAs (1.6 W m−1 K−1),66 antimonene (2.59 W m−1 K−1),66 germanene (2.4 W m−1 K−1),67 silicene (2.86 W m−1 K−1)68 and monolayer SnSe (3 W m−1 K−1).69 In addition, the low lattice thermal conductivity also means that the thermal conductivity of electrons is important when evaluating the figure of merit. This is normally the case for high performance thermoelectrics near their optimum carrier concentration. In the present case, as mentioned, we use a conservative estimate for this electronic part, based on Wiedemann–Franz.

The inset in (d) shows the relationship between the cumulative lattice thermal conductivity and frequency. 
The frequency-dependent κl of monolayer Ge4Se3Te is plotted in the inset of Fig. 6d. Phonons below 3 THz contribute approximately 90% of the total thermal conductivity. Thus the thermal conductivity is mainly from acoustic phonons and low-frequency optical branches. The high-frequency optical phonon modes above the phonon band gap in Fig. 6a do not have significant contributions. The modes below 1 THz are the main acoustic phonons and have a contribution of 60% to the thermal conductivity. The lifetimes of these modes are long (Fig. 6b and c) and one to two orders of magnitude larger than that (0.4 ps) of those high-frequency phonons. As shown in Fig. 6a, the acoustic phonons have three branches, including LA, TA and ZA in which ZA is the out of plane model of vibration. We can find that the E–k dispersion of ZA is very flat near the Γ point and thus has a minor contribution to thermal conductivity. The lowest frequency of the optical phonon mode at the Γ point is about 60 cm−1, which is relatively low, and favors a low thermal conductivity as discussed in materials with rattling modes.70 The modes from 1 THz to 3 THz do not have large contributions to the thermal conductivity and just contribute 30%. We note that these results are consistent with the results for a number of other two-dimensional materials, where those with planar structures have higher in-plane lattice thermal conductivity than those with buckled or more complex structures, which have more complex bonding and more phonon branches increasing the scattering, thereby reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. For example, in MoS2 with a sandwich structure, the weak chemical bond in the non-planar structure reduces the phonon velocity and increases the Grüneisen parameter and thus leads to low lattice thermal conductivity. In monolayer Ge4Se3Te, the weaker Ge–Ge bond in the Se–Ge–Ge–Se(Te) stacking softens the optical modes and enhances the anharmonic coupling of acoustic phonons and optical phonons. Thus, it can have very low lattice thermal conductivity.
Based on the power factor and thermal conductivity, the theoretical ZT values can be obtained. The calculated ZT values as a function of doping concentration at 300 K, 600 K and 900 K are shown in Fig. 7. One can see that the TE performance of p-type is slightly better than that of n-type doping, due to the larger power factor of p-type. Along x and y directions, the maximum ZT values of p-type at 300 K are 0.9 and 1.5, respectively. As noted, the lattice thermal conductivity decreases quickly with the temperature. This results in high ZT at high temperature. For example at 900 K, the optimized ZT values for p-type are 2.0 along the x direction and 2.5 along the y direction at a normal hole concentration of 7.9 × 1012 cm−2. For the n-type doping, the optimized ZT values are 2.6 (1.8) along the x (y) direction at 6.9 × 1012 cm−2. These results indicate that the two-dimensional Ge4Se3Te thin film can have a good TE performance.

Summary and conclusions
In summary, we present a systematic theoretical study of electronic and thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer Ge4Se3Te based on first principles. Bulk and monolayer Ge4Se3Te are semiconductors with indirect gaps of 0.16 eV and 0.49 eV at the PBE level, respectively. The bulk structure exhibits a shorter carrier lifetime and lower electronic conductivity compared to the monolayer, which has higher carrier mobility. Combined with its high S, the power factor of monolayer Ge4Se3Te is found to be high. For the n-type doping, the power factor of monolayer Ge4Se3Te is 21 mW m−1 K−2, similar to that of SnSe (20 mW m−1 K−2).63
The anharmonic mixing of low frequency optical phonons and acoustic phonons results in low thermal conductivity. The calculated average lattice thermal conductivity is 1.6 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature. The high power factor combined with low thermal conductivity makes the ZT value high. We have also found that ZT has high anisotropy in this material. The maximum ZT value of the p-type can reach 2.6 along the y direction at 600 K. For the n-type doping, the maximum ZT value along the x direction is also about 2.6 at 900 K. Thus, the Ge4Se3Te thin film may be a promising TE material. In this way, it also demonstrates an approach to enhance TE performance by reducing the thickness of certain layered materials.
