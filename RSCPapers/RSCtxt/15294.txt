    , Accepted 21st October 2013First published on 21st October 2013AbstractWe present a review of recent efforts aimed at understanding interfacial charge transfer at the single molecule and single nanoparticle level using the combined methods of traditional electrochemistry and optical spectroscopy with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Elastic light scattering, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), fluorescence, and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) techniques have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for the study of interfacial charge transfer events involving a single molecule or nanoparticle and for the characterization of nanostructured electrodes. It is shown that these optical methods enable the exploration of electrochemical events with improved temporal and spatial resolution which are usually obstructed by the ensemble averaging inherent in conventional electrochemical methods. In this report, the current status of the field is reviewed and challenges for future work are discussed.

1. Introduction
Recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have led us to believe that electrodes with any desired geometry and/or composition can be fabricated to help seek answers previously unachievable using conventional planar thin film electrode systems. Nanostructured electrodes have been extensively implemented in many kinds of electrochemical devices. For example, the light absorption, exciton dissociation, and transport efficiencies of solar cells can be greatly enhanced through the careful engineering of nonplanar electrode interfaces. Working electrodes with nanostructured surfaces not only provide higher surface areas for high density interfacial charge storage and improved catalytic reaction rates, but also have dimensions on the nanometer scale that are comparable to the thickness of the electrical double layer or the size of the analytes. Therefore, sensitive electrochemical detection and high spatial resolution for direct electrochemical imaging can be achieved without being limited by double layer charging currents. Individual nanostructured electrodes can be utilized for ultrasensitive imaging and trace analysis for single redox molecule detection1 and biomolecular sensing.2 Such unique electrochemical performance is greatly improved when interfaced with scanning probe techniques (e.g., scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)) and/or optical spectroscopic methods. For example, single molecule electrochemistry can be achieved using nanoelectrodes as demonstrated by Bard and co-workers in 1995,1,3 and more recently by Sun and Mirkin4 and in nanofluidic devices as demonstrated by Lemay et al.5,6 As of yet, the broad application of single molecule detection in these confined nanoelectrode configurations remains a challenging topic due to the slow turnover rate of redox molecules, high background signals, and limited access to interior structural and chemical information of a complex system (e.g., optoelectronic devices and living cells).
With advanced high resolution optical imaging and detection techniques such as single molecule fluorescence, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL), and dark field scattering (DFS), one can keep pushing electrochemical detection beyond the limits of conventional electrochemical methods. Some challenges that need to be overcome to improve such optically coupled electrochemical measurements and widen their applicability are (1) the development and refinement of additional detection schemes that complement established fluorescence- and Raman-based techniques, (2) the careful design of plasmonic nanostructures which can be employed to enhance the detection of optical signals in an existing electrochemical system of interest, and (3) developing experimental methods capable of studying redox reactions at many (100's or 1000's) single nanostructures with varying geometries simultaneously, enabling the rapid acquisition of statistically sound data describing the heterogeneity present in these systems. In this perspective, we review recent work on studying interfacial charge transfer events using combined electrochemical and optical methods. Elastic dark field light scattering, Raman scattering, fluorescence, and ECL as electrochemical detection schemes at the single molecule/nanostructure level are covered. Remaining challenging issues in this field are discussed at the end.
2. Scattering techniques
Metallic nanostructured electrode materials, particularly those composed of Ag and Au, are capable of coupling strongly to optical fields through the excitation of plasmons, qualitatively described as collective oscillations of free electrons within the metal. This property can be exploited to create ultra-sensitive optical detection schemes, utilizing the scattering/absorption signal arising from the excitation of the plasmon itself or the amplification of other optical spectroscopic signals (e.g., Raman scattering, fluorescence, sum frequency generation) due to the strong local field enhancement capability of the plasmonic substrate. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is of particular importance to chemists because of its power to provide vibrational fingerprints of a molecule with single molecule detection limits and is discussed in-depth later in this section. Dark field scattering, capable of probing the plasmon resonance of metallic nanostructures directly, is first discussed for its application in probing local electrochemical events.
2.1 Dark field scattering microscopy
It has been shown experimentally that it is possible to probe individual plasmonic nanostructures through scattering and/or absorption microscopy.7–13 Observation of electrochemical events at the single nanoparticle level via dark field scattering (DFS) is particularly attractive due to the simplicity of the required experimental setup (see Fig. 1), though it is less sensitive than absorption-based methods in the smallest size regime (due to the related cross sections varying with particle radius as r6 and r3, respectively). Considerable experimental and theoretical efforts have been invested in understanding the dependence of a particle's plasmon resonance spectra on its size, morphology, electron density, and surrounding dielectric environment. This is typically accomplished through correlating spectroscopic studies with physical characterization via scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM). Numerous such studies of Au and Ag structures of various shapes (spheres, various polyhedra, cage-like structures) have been reported.14–23 It has been demonstrated that plasmonic nanoparticles can act as sensitive probes of the local dielectric environment.16,18,24,25 They can resultantly be exploited for sensitive, localized chemical detection.

One field which can benefit greatly from such a powerful analytical technique is that of nanoparticle catalysis, where the heterogeneity inherent in the synthesis of catalyst particles can complicate the study of the underlying catalytic mechanism through traditional ensemble measurements. The value of being able to monitor local reactant/product concentrations (and consequently reaction rates) for individual nanoparticles cannot be understated. Few studies of redox catalysis at single nanostructures employing dark field scattering have been reported so far.26–28 A great example of the study of single nanoparticle catalysis through dark field scattering was given in 2008 by Mulvaney et al.29 Here, the authors observed the oxidation of ascorbic acid at the surface of individual Au nanocrystals. While monitoring the scattering spectra of individual Au particles after the addition of a solution of ascorbic acid, a reversible blueshift of the plasmon peak of ∼20 nm occurs gradually over a time span of minutes due to the injection of electrons into the Au particle from ascorbic acid followed by discharging of the excess electrons via the reduction of O2 at the Au surface. The observed shift can be explained quantitatively based on a change in the electron density within the metal.30 By correlating their spectroscopic results with high-resolution TEM measurements, the authors demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to calculate reaction rates for both redox half-reactions occurring at a single catalyst nanoparticle. This charge-induced plasmon shift has also been observed after the direct electrochemical reduction/oxidation of individual Au nanorods.31
Published work on the dark field scattering of individual plasmonic nanostructures has been composed almost entirely of studies of pre-synthesized structures with a well defined geometry, save for the chemically induced elongation of Au NRs reported in a previously mentioned study.29 Our group has recently employed dark field scattering microscopy to study the electrochemical synthesis of individual plasmonic nanostructures in situ. The light scattering at a transparent electrode in a solution containing Ag+ ions was projected onto a CCD camera while sweeping the electrode towards cathodic potentials to produce Ag nanoparticles. This is depicted in Fig. 2A. Using this technique, scattering-time curves (Fig. 2B) describing the deposition of hundreds of individual Ag nanostructures can be obtained simultaneously, yielding a direct insight into the heterogeneity inherent in the deposition of such metallic nanostructures on transparent oxide electrodes. As an illustration of this, a histogram of E1/2 (defined as the potential at 1/2 of the final scattering intensity) values for these Ag particles is given in Fig. 2C. The deposited Ag nanostructures were characterized by SEM to obtain final particle size distributions. Theoretical calculations of the scattering intensity as a function of particle size (here through Mie theory, making the rough assumption of spherical particles) combined with electron microscopy analysis allow for an estimation of particle size to be obtained from the scattering intensity measured at the CCD. By having an estimate of a particle's size at every stage of its growth, the estimation of the current–potential (I–V) curve depicting the faradaic current (i.e., Ag+ + e− → Ag) associated with its deposition follows directly (Fig. 2D).

The insets in A are scattering images (∼30 × 30 μm) taken at the indicated point along the potential sweep. The vertical dashed line in B indicates the end of the potential sweep. The individual particle curves in (B) and (D) are not correlated. 
A rather drastic limitation of dark field scattering microscopy in the transmission configuration presented here is the need for optically transparent working electrode materials. The high overpotentials required to drive an electrochemical reaction of interest at these transparent electrodes, which have a limited potential window, can result in damage to the electrode materials themselves. However, a reflection configuration could be employed dark field imaging of opaque substrates. Another drawback for such dark field measurements is the need for the nanostructure being analyzed to be composed of, or at least incorporate, a plasmonic metal in order to achieve a sufficient scattering cross section for single particle detection. Even then, the structures must be of sufficient size (∼20 nm or so in diameter for spherical Ag particles, for example) in order to be detected. Thus, in order to infer information on the particle's growth below this size regime using the method presented here, a theoretical model for particle growth must be used to fit the acquired single particle data. Further refinement of this DFS-based electrochemical technique is an area of ongoing research in our laboratory.
2.2 SERS
As a chemically specific sensing technique capable of probing species in an aqueous environment, Raman scattering seems like an ideal method for probing electrochemical interactions. However, the low cross sections (10−30 to 10−25 cm2 per molecule) in comparison to those of fluorescence (10−16 cm2 per molecule for good fluorophores) limits its ability to probe electrochemical events on a useful timescale. Following the discovery of SERS in 1974 by Fleischmann and co-workers32 and subsequent explanation independently by both Jeanmaire and Van Duyne33 and Albrecht and Creighton,34 Raman has become a more generalized analytical tool.35–37 The SERS effect relies on a two part enhancement, an electromagnetic field enhancement caused by the surface plasmon and a charge transfer enhancement caused by direct interaction between the surface and the analyte. SERS truly is a surface sensitive technique with the enhancement factor decaying dramatically as the analyte is moved further away from the surface. Further work has been able to extend SERS into the realm of single molecule detection38–40 with SERS enhancement factors as large as 1011.
Taking advantage of the huge enhancement factors for ultrasensitive detection, several groups have looked at probing the electrochemistry of adsorbates on SERS active electrodes.41–43 More recent work has mainly focused on using well-defined SERS electrode substrates.44–47 SERS substrates with well-defined nanostructures provide a distinct advantage in fundamental studies over bulk ensembles as the individual structures can be directly probed and compared to theoretical calculations. Willets and co-workers48,49 recently employed super-resolution imaging techniques to demonstrate distinct co-localization and determination of SERS and luminescence hot spots at individual plasmonic nanostructures.
SERS has been used to study many kinds of electrochemical events involving various analytes50–53 and electrodes,54–56 including some SERS electrodes prepared by microsphere coating methods.57,58 This work has been extended all the way down to the single molecule level.59,60 For example, Cortés et al.61 performed a single molecule analysis of the redox reaction of Nile Blue (NB) using a SERS technique. Here, the authors employed a bi-analyte system combining NB, which undergoes a reduction reaction that causes the Raman band at 590 cm−1 to almost completely disappear, and Rhodamine 6G (R6G), whose spectrum remains essentially constant in the experimental potential window. Fig. 3 shows a set of Raman spectra and intensity traces of the 590 cm−1 NB peak as the electrode potential is swept at 0.3 V s−1. Fig. 3a shows a very smooth transition in the intensity as it probes many NB molecules, whereas Fig. 3b and c only show a single molecule. The transition is much more abrupt in these trajectories, which show a definitive difference in the onset of the reduction step, indicating a stochastic single molecule process. Histograms (not shown) of the onset of single molecule oxidation and reduction indicate that the reversibility of the reaction is heterogeneous across the sample. In comparison to the bulk sample, it becomes evident that the bulk behaviour can be explained by the heterogeneity in the redox behaviour of the individual molecules and that the only way to successfully observe this phenomenon is through single molecule methods.

2.2.1 Other potentially applicable SERS-based methods. 
The greatest difficulty with employing SERS as a probe for spatial electrochemical heterogeneities at electrode surfaces has been substrate specificity. Though there are some reports of SERS on other transition metals and semiconductors, the strongest enhancements occur on Ag and Au. Since these metals can directly interact with the analyte through chemical bonding and by catalyzing electrochemical interactions, electromagnetic field enhancement borrowing methods were developed.62 In these methods, the SERS substrate is insulated from the analyte of interest, ensuring that the only interaction between the SERS-active substrate and the analyte is the electromagnetic field enhancement.
The first of these enhancement borrowing methods developed was tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS).63–65 TERS involves moving a strongly enhancing electromagnetic field localized on an AFM tip close to the sample, thus generating a known hot spot for enhancing the scattering cross-section of Raman active species in close proximity to the tip, as shown in Fig. 4a. TERS is capable of sub-diffraction limit spatial resolution due to the localized enhancement in the vicinity of the AFM tip. The major drawback is that the relative enhancement of the TERS tip is not as large as the current colloidal substrates. Despite this drawback, TERS has been used to probe biological systems,66–68 solid state catalysts,69 and metallic surfaces.70–72 Recently, Zhang et al.73 have made use of TERS to perform single molecule mapping using a scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) system. The STM image of meso-tetrakis(3,5-di-tertiarybutylphenyl)-porphyrin (H2TBPP) molecules on a Ag(111) surface can be seen in Fig. 4b. When Raman spectra were taken with the STM tip localized over the bare silver surface, no signal beyond a broad background was detected, while the identity of the H2TBPP molecules was readily apparent down to the single molecule level, as seen in Fig. 4c. Further work has begun to probe the usage of TERS in the liquid phase.74 As this work is extended, the complete ability to image and probe heterogeneities in situ for electrochemical experiments will provide new and interesting insights.

The second enhancement borrowing method developed was shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS).75 Based upon colloidal nanoparticles that used a transition metal shell with a noble metal core,62,76,77 SHINERS particles consist of a noble metal core with a chemically inert shell. The SHINERS particles are synthesized by first growing Au or Ag78 nanoparticles with a very small size distribution at a known size, which support plasmon excitation on resonance with the eventual excitation light. The shell is then deposited in a carefully controlled manner, either through a chemical reduction method or through atomic layer deposition, allowing distance control between the analyte and the SERS core. This allows the SERS active core to enhance the Raman signal while not chemically interacting with the analyte. The SHINERS particles can be spread over any electrode in a dusting method in order to generate a direct in situ probe of the electrode surface using standard Raman collection techniques. This allows for electrode heterogeneities to be probed without altering the actual surface chemistry. For example, Li et al.79 have demonstrated SHINERS as a method for probing pyridine adsorption on flat, single crystal Au in comparison to a bare Au nanoparticle SERS coating. As seen in Fig. 5A, both bias dependent SHINERS (red) and gold nanoparticle SERS spectra (black) show variations in the pyridine band intensity at 1014 and 1039 cm−1 bands as the bias is swept. The peak intensities actually occur at different biases, with the SHINERS showing the greatest intensity at −0.2 V and the SERS at −0.6 V. The SHINERS spectra display a greater overall peak intensity for the pyridine than the Au nanoparticle coated SERS spectra. This leads to an estimated enhancement factor of 106 for the SHINERS method which is an order of magnitude greater than that of the gold nanoparticle coated substrate. These two observations are both explained by Fig. 5B which illustrates the expected areas of greatest electromagnetic field enhancement with red being largest and blue being smallest. As can be seen, the SHINERS method primarily enhances the pyridine located at the surface of the electrode instead of between the particles like that seen for the gold nanoparticles. This actually allows for a greater area of more intense excitation, accounting for the greater intensity. Further, since the majority of the enhanced pyridines in the gold nanoparticle SERS configuration are actually between the gold nanoparticles instead of at the electrode surface, which has a greater affinity for the pyridine, a shift in the bias with the highest intensity is seen. Further work was carried out showing similar results on a Pt electrode.

More work has already been reported showing the ability of this method to probe other standard SERS substrate electrodes80,81 as well as non-SERS based electrodes such as Pt.82 Further work has been performed to extend the SHINERS particles from Au@SiO2 and Au@Al2O3 to other shell types, such as MnO2,83 which would increase the substrate, analyte, and system generality of the SHINERS method by providing system specific inert behaviour. Geometric modification has also started to be explored in SHINERS (e.g., nanorod shaped SHINERS particles84).
The application of SERS to the study of single molecule/particle electrochemistry is certainly promising, but limited. As for DFS, the application of SERS for electrochemical detection requires the presence of a plasmonic nanostructure at the working electrode surface. In cases where this is not already incorporated into the system, an external one must be introduced. Ideally, this plasmonic structure would be stable within the electrochemical window of interest and not interact chemically with the analyte. The most widely employed metal for SERS, Ag, is not particularly electrochemically stable, and all commonly used metals (Ag, Au, and Pt) have catalytic properties, making it often impossible to employ them as-is without perturbing the system of interest. The enhancement borrowing methods discussed (TERS/SHINERS) attempt to address these issues, with SHINERS being particularly attractive due to the ability of selecting a shell material which will be inert in a particular system of interest. However, even these methods require additional modification of the electrochemical system and can introduce experimental complications, particularly disruption of local mass transfer processes at the electrode surface.

3. Fluorescence
While plasmon resonance spectroscopy and SERS both require the presence of plasmonic structures within the system of interest, fluorescence spectroscopy is capable of single molecule/particle sensitivity in the absence of plasmonic amplification (which can inherently alter the system at hand) due to the much larger typical cross sections involved. This makes fluorescence a comparatively “cleaner” technique for the study of many systems where it can be applied. Due to the typically broad nature of fluorescence spectra, most applications of single molecule fluorescence to the tracking of chemical reactions involve the switching of a fluorophore between fluorescent (“on”) and nonfluorescent (“off”) states. This switching can take the form of chemically modifying the fluorophore in question or somehow quenching its fluorescence, through mechanisms such as charge transfer or Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Both schemes have been applied to the study of single molecule redox events.
The groups of Barbara and Bard first demonstrated the use of fluorescence microscopy to study the electrochemistry of individual conjugated polymer molecules.85 The application of this technique to small molecule fluorophores followed soon after.86,87 The initial studies on conjugated polymer molecules are especially relevant due to the use of such conjugated polymer materials in organic electronic devices. By monitoring the fluorescence of these single molecules immobilized at a transparent electrode while sweeping the electrode potential anodically, effective oxidation half-potentials for the individual molecules were determined from the potential at which the molecules stopped fluorescing. The distribution of observed oxidation potentials offers insight into important physical properties not obtainable from bulk measurements, such as the distribution of low energy redox-active sites along the polymer chains.88 Subsequent studies of individual polymer nanoparticles88,89 were performed which provided valuable insight into the mechanism of deep versus shallow hole trap formation in conjugated polymer materials. Such traps in conjugated polymer films cause funnelling/quenching of excitons therein, limiting the performance of devices based on these materials. The reversibility of hole injection into individual conjugated polymer nanoparticles imbedded in a Nafion film was studied by monitoring their fluorescence while cyclically sweeping the electrode potential at different rates. By estimating the nanoparticle size from the fluorescence of unoxidized particles and having an estimate of the effective “quenching volume” for a single injected hole, a quantitative estimate of the hole concentration within the individual particles can be made. Studying the effects of hole concentration on the fluorescence of individual nanoscale features in such a manner is not possible using traditional bulk spectroscopic/electrochemical measurements. At high potential sweep rates, hole injection into the nanoparticles was found to be reversible; this hole injection becomes irreversible at lower sweep rates. The authors attributed this irreversibility to the conversion of initially injected “untrapped” holes into “trapped” holes, through a relaxation of the polymer structure or intraparticle hole transfer to a lower energy, deeply trapped site.
Such single molecule fluorescence techniques can also be applied to the study of catalytic systems. For example, the observation of single molecule electrocatalysis at individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was reported by Chen et al. and is summarized in Fig. 6.90 Here, the electrocatalytic reduction of individual nonfluorescent resazurin molecules to the fluorescent resorufin at individual SWNTs was monitored via wide-field fluorescence imaging. At a given SWNT, an intermittent fluorescence signal is turned “on” and “off” as resazurin molecules are reduced to resorufin which subsequently dissociate from the SWNT or are further reduced to non-fluorescent species. Since each “on” state can be associated with a single fluorescing resorufin molecule, super-resolution imaging methods were employed to gain insight into the emitting molecules' locations. Briefly, this involves fitting the spatial intensity profile for each “on” state to a two-dimensional gaussian function to extract an emission centroid. The distribution of the observed centroid positions at a single SWNT for a large number of these “on” states was measured; using the resulting FWHM of the distribution as a metric, the authors were able to determine that the reactive sites on the SWNTs were less than ∼20 nm in length. Though working electrodes of comparable dimensions have been prepared, it is not possible to selectively expose such small individual regions of a macroscopic electrode to an electrolyte solution for direct electrochemical measurements. In addition to the spatial distribution of the observed fluorescence, the “on” and “off” state durations also provide valuable information about the underlying reaction kinetics, reflecting the rate of dissociation/reduction of resofurin and reduction of resazurin, respectively. Through these wide field optical measurements, the authors were able to determine the associated rate constants for these processes for many individual reactive sites simultaneously, shedding light on the heterogeneity in reactivity not visible in traditional electrochemical measurements.

A primary limitation of fluorescence detection for the study of single molecule/particle electrochemical events is photostability issues; many fluorophores readily undergo photobleaching under intense laser excitation, especially in the presence of oxygen and water. Another limitation is the simple fact that fluorescence is a rather rare property. For the study of some systems (such as the conjugated polymer systems discussed here), fluorescence happens to be a convenient tool. Otherwise, it is necessary to incorporate a model redox-active fluorophore system, such as the resorufin system employed extensively by Chen et al.90–97 Such systems are thoroughly characterized and well suited to experimental application (good chemical stability, high fluorescence quantum efficiency, etc.), but may not directly correlate with an actual chemical system of importance. However, this strategy can be very effective when the fluorophore is not the component of interest in the experimental system (e.g., using a known redox-generated fluorophore to study the catalytic activity of individual metallic nanostructures).
4. Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL)
4.1 Operation mechanism
Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) involves the radiative decay process of an excited chromophore generated through a redox reaction in an electrochemical cell. Similar to photoluminescence and chemiluminescence, the ECL process also originates from radiative relaxation of excited states. The major difference between these three is the method used to generate the excited states. This similarity is demonstrated in Fig. 7, where the ECL and fluorescence spectra for a poly[3-hexylthiophene] film are given.98 ECL efficiency is typically low when compared to luminescence efficiency due to the poor stability of the electrogenerated species which react to yield the excited chromophore. The efficiency can be enhanced in aqueous solution through the use of co-reactants such as tripropyl amine. Due to its simplicity, low cost, and low background signals for light generation and detection, ECL has been extensively applied to biomolecular sensing to help resolve specific molecular bonding events. Solid-state ECL devices can be constructed to compete with existing light emitting diodes (LEDs).99 Our recent efforts in the area of nanoelectrochemistry have used ECL to help understand thin film charge transfer properties, mass transfer events at new nanostructured electrodes, and morphological information on the active layer of an organic solar cell device. We have also used ECL to study the catalytic activity of newly fabricated nanostructures that can potentially benefit energy storage and conversion efforts. These studies are essential to understanding the operation mechanism and limiting factors of energy storage and conversion systems. Results yielded from ECL and other combined approaches would benefit the development of efficient catalytic and energy conversion devices.

4.2 ECL at C, Au modified TiO2 electrodes and single particle ECL imaging
In the area of nanoelectrochemistry, we recently discovered that TiO2 can serve as an excellent electrode blocking layer for gold nanoparticles electrodeposited onto Ti substrates for ECL imaging in the spherical mass transfer region.100 As shown in Fig. 8, individual gold nanoparticles serve as nanoelectrodes as they have reliable electrical contact with the Ti substrate while the remaining Ti surface is blocked by a metal oxide coating to prevent charge transfer. Redox reactions at the active gold electrodes can be used to generate ECL. We used confocal microscopy and standard ECL detection methods to study the effects of gold electrodeposition conditions on ECL intensity and Faradaic current responses at various Ti substrates. Such gold decorated TiO2 nanoelectrodes can also be utilized for combined spectroelectrochemical studies using both ECL and optical spectroscopy (e.g., SERS) to resolve interfacial charge transfer events.101 As shown in Fig. 9, we are able to probe the surface adsorption and stability of N3 dye using both ECL and SERS signatures while cycling the electrode's potential in aqueous solution. It should be noted that the metal oxide blocking layer is unnecessary if the overpotential applied to the substrate is not too high, as gold can catalyze the redox reaction of the coreactant to generate more efficient ECL than other electrodes (e.g., ITO and Ti). More recently, we have shown that metal-like C-doped Ti nanowire structures can be used as excellent ECL substrates for investigating double layer charging effects.102 The substrate in this study was made of an anodized Ti electrode followed by doping with C via a high temperature chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. Such sensitive ECL detection methods helped us resolve local electrochemical activities at the nanometer scale with additional information on the mass transfer of the ECL active redox species without being limited by double layer charging currents. Catalytic activities of the ECL events can be studied at nanostructured electrodes as well. For instance, we are able to study the reductive-oxidation ECL events at transparent graphene and silver nanowire electrodes.103 Our study shows that the graphene electrode and silver nanowire electrode can catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide which has been applied as a coreactant in the reductive-oxidation ECL production.

4.3 Conjugated polymers incorporating nanostructured TiO2 and graphene
In addition to benefiting the understanding of surface catalytic activities and providing sensitive imaging for studying electrochemical events, we recently utilized ECL to study nanocomposite materials containing conjugated polymers in the presence of charge acceptors such as C60,104 TiO2,98 and graphene105 (cf. Fig. 10). These polymers have large light absorption cross sections to absorb solar energy, while the acceptors (e.g., metal oxide, C60, and graphene) serve as electron conduction media to help separate excited states to free charges in order to produce power to an external circuit under solar energy excitation. The ECL of the pristine polymer films shows a large turn-on potential for ECL generation due to its poor conductivity and the poor mass transfer of the coreactant to the conductive substrate. In the presence of these charge collectors, the ECL intensity increases due to morphological changes within the polymer film and enhanced mass transfer of the coreactant within the polymer matrix, producing a higher population of excited states. ECL quenching was observed in the presence of a high concentration of the electron acceptor due to charge transfer directly from the excited states to the electron acceptor. In our work, these ECL results are compared with steady-state photoluminescence, fluorescence lifetime, and transient absorption spectroscopy results to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature of the light harvesting system.

The application of ECL detection is largely limited by poor efficiency as compared to fluorescence because the chemical reactions which generate the excited states often involve unstable energetic species, and sometimes a coreactant is needed to generate these redox species prior to producing the excited states. Poor temporal stability is another drawback which arises from unstable electrode materials and/or mass transfer processes of the redox species involved in the ECL reaction.
5. Conclusions
Elastic light scattering, SERS, fluorescence, and ECL are powerful tools for probing heterogeneities in charge transfer events and local conductivity at electrode materials that are essential for next generation alternative energy conversion/storage and optical electronic devices. These combined optical and electrochemical tools provide rich information on local electrochemical events including charge transfer kinetics and mass transfer as well as temporal and spatial heterogeneities in these electrochemical events. Some remaining challenges and opportunities in this field are (1) applying existing single molecule and single nanoparticle detection schemes to catalytic systems of high academic and industrial importance without interfering with the target catalytic reactions, (2) constructing an ideal transparent and conductive electrode with minimized local heterogeneities in conductivity for carrying out these studies, and (3) extending the application of these single molecule/particle spectroelectrochemical techniques to practical applications, such as electrochemical biosensing and the imaging of living systems.
