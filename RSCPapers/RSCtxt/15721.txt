    , Accepted 21st January 2023First published on 31st March 2023AbstractMetal hydride (MH) hydrogen storage systems have gained interest as an efficient and safe method for hydrogen storage. An extremely high chemical reaction rate and rapid heat transfer should be the characteristics of an ideal metal hydride reactor (MHR). However, the thermal conductivity of a metal hydride bed (MHB) is only 0.1–1.5 W m−1 K−1, which poses a challenge in practical applications and makes it urgent to adopt an efficient thermal management approach. This paper reviews the development of the MHB thermal management over the past few decades, which can be divided into three parts: (1) from the MHR structure, methods like adding cooling tubes and fins are adopted to enhance the heat transfer between the MHR and the outside environment; (2) from the material perspective, thermal conductivity enhancers that include metal foams and expanded natural graphite (ENG) are introduced to the MHB to improve the effective thermal conductivity of the MHB; and (3) a phase change material (PCM) is employed to strengthen the heat transformation inside the MHB and reduce the energy loss. This research is focused on evaluating the impact of various thermal management measures on heat and mass transfer and comparing their heat transfer effectiveness, summarizing the benefits and drawbacks of different MHR structures. Finally, some views on the future designs of MHBs are proposed.Guodong MiaoGuodong Miao, a Graduate Student of the University of Science and Technology Beijing, has research interests in metal hydride modification treatments and metal hydride reactor designs.

1 Introduction
Energy is the basis for the survival and development of human society. However, there is a pressing need for the development of renewable and ecologically friendly energy with the increasing global population, rising energy demand, diminishing supplies of fossil fuels, and deteriorating ecological conditions. Hydrogen energy is renewable, clean, and widely available, and has a high calorific value of combustion (3 times that of gasoline and 4.5 times that of coke) to meet the demand for new energy sources.1
The hydrogen energy business consists of four main segments: production, storage, transport, and application, where the storage technology is a fundamental barrier to the widespread use of hydrogen energy.2 The three main types of hydrogen storage are high-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage, liquid hydrogen storage, and solid-state hydrogen storage.3 High-pressure gaseous hydrogen storage technology is sophisticated and quick to absorb or desorb hydrogen, but it suffers from the disadvantages of high cost, poor safety, and low energy density.4 Liquid hydrogen technology is closer to the practical objective requirements in terms of mass and volume hydrogen storage density. However, the liquid technology has some potential problems including high energy consumption, volatility, high cost, and leakage while using.5 MH is a predominant type of solid-state hydrogen storage, which has a high hydrogen storage density (it can even reach 90 kg H2 per m3), a compact structure, excellent safety, and high hydrogen release purity,6,7 thus it has attracted much attention recently from researchers.
MH is formed by the reversible reaction of metals and alloys with hydrogen at a specific temperature and pressure. The pressure composition isotherm (P–C–T) is used to describe this thermodynamic process. At first, hydrogen dissolves into metal crystal interstices, forming a hydrogen-containing solid solution (α phase), which is represented as a rising curve on the P–C–T curve. When the hydrogen pressure and hydrogen concentration continue to increase, the concentration of hydrogen reaches the ultimate solubility and the hydrogen-containing solid solution (α phase) reacts with hydrogen to produce the metal hydride phase (β phase). At this time, the P–C–T curve shows a plateau state, and this pressure value is called the plateau pressure, in which the width of the plateau reflects the mass hydrogen storage density of metals and alloys. The absorption of hydrogen is an exothermic reaction, while desorption is an endothermic process. The heat produced by the reversible process is around 10–20% of hydrogen's high heating value, which depends on the plateau pressure and temperature of the material.8,9 If the heat released from the hydrogen absorption process is not dissipated in time, the temperature of the MHB will rise, which will reduce the hydrogen absorption rate and increase the reaction time. The same is true for the hydrogen desorption process. It is necessary to dissipate and supply heat from the MHB during hydrogen absorption and desorption processes, respectively, to ensure that the reaction proceeds. However, the thermal conductivity of the MHB is only 0.1–1.5 W m−1 K−1,10,11 which makes it difficult to complete the heat transfer and hinders the process of hydrogen charge and discharge, thus effective thermal management means need to be added.12–14 The reaction of metal hydride absorption/desorption of hydrogen can be expressed as follows:  
The immediate site where the reversible reaction takes place is known as the reaction bed. The reactor is a whole unit composed of the reaction bed, an external tank, and various thermal management measures added. Besides hydrogen storage, MH is also used in refrigeration, heat pumps, hydrogen compressors, hydrogen purification, fuel cells, etc.15–17 If the MHB is kept at a low enough temperature, MH may absorb hydrogen at a low pressure, and if the MHB is kept at a high enough temperature, hydrogen can be delivered at a high pressure, so as to act as hydrogen compressors. Metal hydride thermal storage is a promising new energy storage technology, including solar thermal field, low-temperature heat storage field, and heat pump field. Metal hydride thermal storage is based on the conversion of chemical energy into thermal energy. The principle of heat storage of MH is to use the reaction enthalpy of their reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption chemical reactions to store or release heat energy. The MHR needs to meet the requirements of hydrogen storage capacity and hydrogen absorption and desorption rates in these application scenarios. The amount of hydrogen storage can be satisfied by increasing the mass of MH, which cannot meet the requirement of hydrogen absorption and desorption rate. The rate of hydrogen absorption and desorption is closely related to the selection of MH materials and the heat transfer effect of MHB. Several kinds of hydrogen storage materials including La-based hydrides,18,19 Ti-based hydrides20,21 and Mg-based hydrides22,23 have been well explored in the previous literature, which provides a range of hydrogen storage materials with different temperatures and plateau pressures that can be selected according to the needs of practical applications. The MHB composed of these materials has the same characteristics of a violent initial reaction, with a sudden increase in MHB temperature during hydrogen absorption and a sudden decrease in MHB temperature during hydrogen desorption. The hydrogen absorption and desorption rates of the MHB in practical applications are always limited by the heat transfer efficiency rather than the intrinsic kinetics of the hydrogen storage material.24 Therefore, it is necessary to explore the thermal management of the MHB.
The research efforts focused on the kinetic behavior of the reaction process in the 1980s. ENG and metal foams have been introduced into the MHB to improve heat transfer, but an explanation of the internal behavior of the MHB was lacking. The development of modeling and simulation techniques in the 1990s and the beginning of this century has led researchers to construct many types of 2D and 3D models that revealed various aspects of hydrogen flow and heat transfer inside the MHB. The construction of the model accelerated the development of mass and heat transfer in the MHB, and the reactor system evolved from a small to medium size to a large MHR. Many review articles have explored the development of metal hydride hydrogen storage systems, and previous studies have been more extensive, in terms of various types of hydrogen storage technologies, reactor design and geometry, etc., but there is a lack of systematic and comprehensive study on thermal management techniques for metal hydride hydrogen storage systems. For example, Afzal et al.25 have outlined the optimization of the MHB with the addition of cooling tubes and fins. However, only the improvement in the number of fins and cooling tubes was mentioned in the paper and the study of the form and arrangement of fins and cooling tubes was lacking. Cui et al.26 tried to summarize the thermal management techniques for adding cooling tubes, fins, and PCMs. However, not only does the thermal management technique involve the addition of cooling tubes, fins, and PCMs, but it should also include the introduction of thermal conductivity enhancers (e.g. ENG and metal foams).
Here, more than 180 representative, highly cited and original studies reported in the literature were selected as references, and the proportion of the number of typical publications involving various types of thermal management measures is shown in Fig. 1. To describe the challenges with the design and optimization of MHR thermal management, these measures are grouped into three sections in this paper: structural designs, the addition of thermal conductivity enhancers, and PCMs. The structural designs' part can be subdivided into six parts: an external cooling jacket, embedded tubes, fins, mini channels and heat pipes, dimensions and shapes of the MHR, and other unconventional structural designs. The addition of thermal conductivity enhancers contains four parts: metal foams, ENG, mixed metal powder, and encapsulation. The purpose of this study is to provide a thorough analysis of the evolution of the MHB structural and geometric designs as well as improved heat transfer methods in recent decades, laying the groundwork for future MHR designs.

2 Design of the MHR structure
The design and optimization of the structure are crucial subjects of the MHR study. More than 60% of the work on the MHR heat transfer problem in the hydrogen storage process is concentrated on remodeling the MHR structure, which covers both the addition of improved heat transmission devices (e.g. cooling tubes and fins) and adjustments to the height-to-diameter ratio and shape of the MHR.
2.1 Addition of cooling devices
The cooling devices can remove heat during hydrogen absorption and supply heat during hydrogen desorption to maintain the stability of the MH system. Therefore, it is reasonable for the thermal management system of MH to use cooling fluids (air, water, oil) and construct cooling devices to achieve an efficient rate of heat transfer. The cooling fluids may be passed through an external cooling jacket wrapped around the unit or an internal heat exchanger built into the MHB according to how the MHR unit is installed.

2.1.1 External cooling jacket. 
The external cooling jacket is the most popular method of removing heat from the MHB, and the fundamental structure is shown in Fig. 2a.27 This method does not change the structure of the MHB and it is a simple and fast heat exchange device, which makes it useful both directly as a basic tool and in combination with other thermal management technologies.28 As compared to the MHR without the cooling jacket, the effective heat transfer coefficient of the MHR with the external cooling jacket may be raised from 5.5 ± 1 W m−2 K−1 to 113 ± 1 W m−2 K−1,29 and the bed temperature peak is lower, which would enhance the hydrogen absorption rate and shorten the absorption time.30 The heat transfer effect of the system can be impacted by the fluid temperature27,31 and jacket parameters.32 As a result of simulations, controlling the fluid temperature and hydrogen pressure can minimize the entropy generated during hydrogen storage and de-storage and lengthen cycle periods.27 There are some cooling jackets that gather numerous MHBs for shared use, besides the cooling jackets used individually. Not only does this collection enhance the hydrogen storage capacity, but it also enlarges the region where the MHB comes into contact with the coolant.32–37 As shown in Fig. 2b,33 nine tubular MHRs are located inside with the coolant added outside the tubes, in which nearly 90% improvement in storage time can be achieved by optimizing the parameters.

2.1.2 Embedded tubes. 
Relying solely on the external cooling jacket to transport heat could generate the temperature gradient within the large MHB, which adversely affects the overall performance of the MHB.38 The embedded tubes are a class of cooling tubes inserted directly into the MHB, which can separate the MHB to speed up internal heat transport and increase the contact area with the MHB to improve heat transfer compared with the external cooling jacket.39 As shown in Fig. 3, the most commonly applied embedded tubes are straight,40 U-shaped,41 and spiral tubes.42 The straight tubes keep the temperature low in many parts of the MHB and boost the hydrogen absorption time by nearly 60% compared to the MHR without the straight tubes.43,44 It is straightforward to process and assemble straight pipes, but there are problems with the number and quality of welded joints and difficulties in maintenance. U-shaped tubes can partially replace the application of straight tubes due to their compact structure, excellent heat transfer performance, and ease of maintenance management.45–47 The spiral tubes have excellent axial elasticity, which not only mitigates the stress generated by temperature changes and volume expansion but also enhances the turbulence strength and reduces the thermal resistance of the heat transfer fluid.42,48 Studies have shown that spiral tubes are significantly more effective than straight tube heat exchangers49 and slightly superior to the fins40,50 in improving the heat and mass transfer of the MHR. It is the better choice in structural design to use spiral tubes taking into account the manufacturing cost and maintenance complexity.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram: (a) straight tubes;40 (b) double U-shaped tubes;41 and (c) spiral tubes.42 
Increasing the number of embedded tubes can reduce the thermal resistance of the reaction bed and remove a large amount of heat in a short period.51,52 When the number of embedded tubes is raised from 24 to 60 (Fig. 4),53 the average bed temperature reaches the coolant temperature more quickly and the hydrogen absorption time is decreased by 42.4%. However, the number increases further to 70, and the MHR exhibits the same performance as at number 60, which demonstrates that there is an optimum number of embedded tubes. The optimal number of embedded tubes to be installed is 60 for consideration of the design of the MHB and the cost of tube manufacture, where the effective thermal conductivity is 2.5 W m−1 K−1. A large MHR for industrial applications is embedded with 99 straight tubes and filled with 40 kg of LaNi4.7Al0.3, which can absorb 552.356 g of hydrogen with a volumetric storage density of 56.1 kg m−3 and a maximum storage capacity of 1.4 wt% to satisfy practical application requirements.54 The MHB is split up when a large number of embedded tubes are inserted and there is just one hydrogen channel in the central area (Fig. 5a), which reduces the hydrogen delivery effect (Fig. 5a).55–57 Researchers dramatically accelerated hydrogen flow by setting up a side hydrogen channel (Fig. 5b)58 and multiplying axial hydrogen channels (Fig. 5c).59,60
 Fig. 4  Number of embedded tubes affects the temperature (a) and mass hydrogen storage density (b).53 
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the MHR with multiple straight tubes: (a) a hydrogen channel in the center;53 (b) a side hydrogen channel;58 and (c) axial hydrogen channels.59 
The crucial factors affecting the performance of the MHR relate to the size and placement of the embedded tubes. When the diameter of the straight tubes is doubled, the hydrogen absorption time can be reduced by 25%.61 When the diameter of the U-tubes increases from 3.4 mm to 5.4 mm, the hydrogen absorption time decreases from 725 s to 515 s.45 However, when the diameter increases to a certain extent, there is a smaller effect on the heat transfer of the MHB; instead, more volume of MHB is occupied and the amount of hydrogen storage is reduced.30 In most cases, embedded tubes are placed in a central area arrangement for a single tube (Fig. 3a) and in a circular symmetrical arrangement for multiple tubes (Fig. 5a),62,63 which depends on the geometry and size of the MHR and the number of tubes to maintain a rapid and uniform heat transfer rate. The report has stated that the hydrogen storage time can be shortened to 90% by minimizing the sum of the distance between the embedded tubes and the MHB center, which is the optimal arrangement of the embedded tubes in the heat and mass transfer process.64
The major radius (rc), axial pitch (b), and the number of turns (Fig. 6a) are also essential factors affecting the effect of the MHR with spiral tubes thermal management besides the parameters of number, size, and position.48,65–70 The major radius reflects the distance from the center of the MHB to the spiral tubes, and the axial pitch is defined as the distance between similar positions on consecutive turns of the spiral tubes. The reaction rate is accelerated by growing the major radius and the number of spiral tube turns, whereas a rise in axial pitch has the reverse effect on H2 absorption. This is because the former increases the MHB area for heat transmission, while the latter expands the space between the upper and lower tubes and slows down heat transfer. As a result, the axial pitch should be minimized to the limit during the design phase. The rate of heat transmission to the MHR center is decreased as the major radius continues to grow.71 The researchers have developed a spiral tube with a central return tube (Fig. 6b),72 double spiral tubes (Fig. 6c),73 and a coiled-tube heat exchanger (Fig. 6d),68,74 which promotes heat transfer in the central region and achieves uniform heat transfer inside the MHB.
 Fig. 6  Schematic: (a) the structure of spiral tube;48 (b) spiral tube with a central return tube;72 (c) double spiral tubes;73 and (d) coiled-tube heat exchanger.74 
The embedded tubes are used to supply and disperse the heat produced by the MHB, where optimization of the number, arrangement, and size ensures that the reaction kinetics of the MHB is improved within the target range. However, it is still necessary to boost the MHB transfer effect by combining embedded tubes with additional thermal management techniques (graphite, metal foam, fins, etc.), which exhibits superior performance to employing embedded tubes alone.34,65,75–78 For instance, Gkanas et al.75 designed the MHR with 60 cooling straight tubes and the MHR with 12 longitudinal finned cooling straight tubes respectively. Although both exhibit the same kinetics, the collaboration of cooling tubes and fins not only reduces the volume share of cooling tubes and increases the amount of MH added, but also enlarges the heat transfer area, thus presenting better hydrogen storage performance.

2.2 Addition of fins
The cooling devices can provide a better heat transfer boundary for the MHR, but the heat removal from the MHB to the boundary is constrained by the low thermal conductivity of MH. The fins decrease bed temperature variance and shorten loading times by expanding the heat dissipation area of the MHR. The fins are divided into internal fins (Fig. 7a),76,79–83 external fins (Fig. 7b),84–87 and combined internal and external fins (Fig. 7c)88,89 according to their position on the MHB. The best heat transmission occurs when the internal and external fins are combined. However, the internal fins that are in direct contact with the MHB are the best structural option when efficiency and cost are taken into account. The internal fins are classified into transverse fins90 and longitudinal fins,91 which are usually distributed along the cooling tube (Fig. 7d and e). There are issues of space wastage, powder agglomeration, and heat transfer bottlenecks in the transverse fins. The conical fins (Fig. 7g)92,93 and perforated fins (Fig. 7h)45,94 are built, which promote the ease of MH loading and lessen space wastage and powder agglomeration. Tree-shaped fins (Fig. 7i),95 bio-inspired leaf-vein type fins,96 and bifurcated fins (Fig. 7j)97 are constructed based on the longitudinal structure, and these three structures all have more branches and expand the area in contact with the MHB, and the tree-shaped fins can reduce the hydrogen absorption time by 20.7% among them. The fins are formed into a network structure for more uniform heat transfer.34,98 For example, a coherent heat transfer network inside the MHB can be formed using small and flexible pin fins (Fig. 7f), which are welded to one side of the cooling tubes to accelerate the transfer and transport of heat.99

The arrangement, quantity, and thickness of the fins have profound impacts on the MHB as more fins are added. The fins are arranged in aligned and shifted arrangements. The MHB is divided into some thinner areas in the case of the shifted arrangement of fins, which results in relatively shorter heat transfer paths and better uniformity of temperature distribution inside the MHR.41,77 The thermal resistance of the MHR can be decreased by increasing the radius, thickness, and the number of fins,61,100,101 where the effect of quantity on thermal resistance is more significant than that of radius and thickness, and the enhancement of heat transfer is negligible when the thickness exceeds a certain limit. Thus, as far as the overall system heat dissipation is concerned, the number of fins is given priority, then radius, and finally thickness. The actual medium-sized MHR with a volume hydrogen storage density of 42 g L−1 and an energy density of 1.44 kW h L−1 is made with 28 pieces of 0.8 mm-thick copper fins and can hold 105 g of hydrogen.102 However, the fins suffer from high production costs and complex assembly, and when compared to the blocks, the latter exhibit superior performance.103
2.3 Usage of mini channels and heat pipes
The diameter of the cooling tube is reduced to produce a mini channel in the same volume, which can obtain a larger heat transfer area and ensure the amount of MH added.104,105 Wang et al.106–108 proposed a radiant mini-channel MHR (Fig. 8a) with each radiant tube consisting of an axial main tube and several radial lateral branches, in which 77%, 52%, and 37% of the reaction time are saved compared to no heat exchanger, straight tubes and spiral tubes, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Schematic of the structure of (a) radiant mini channel106 and (b) heat pipe.109 
It is a tedious task to connect the cooling tubes to the MHR, especially for the large MHR, and the coolant in the embedded tubes can leak and damage the MH. As an alternative, the heat pipes (Fig. 8b), which are simple to assemble, can be employed by putting the fluid piping system outside the MHR and attaching the MHB to it.109,110 The size of the heat pipes is similar to the size of the embedded tubes, and the heat pipes are highly efficient in transferring heat via a liquid–vapor phase change. Compared with the MHR without heat pipes, the absorption time of the MHR with heat pipes was more than half reduced and the desorption time was 44 percent longer.111 The large MHR requires at least more than one heat pipe to transport heat. The use of more heat pipes with a smaller radius is more effective in heat transfer than the use of fewer heat pipes with a larger radius, which is the same conclusion as for the embedded tubes.64 The working fluids used in the heat pipes are water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and mixtures of them. The orientation of the heat pipes is vertical, 45° inclined, and horizontally inclined, where the vertical distribution has the lowest thermal resistance (Fig. 8b).112,113 The effect of heat transfer can be further strengthened by using heat pipes coupled with the fins or PCMs.84,112,114
2.4 Design of MHR dimensions and shapes
The most immediate site where the reaction takes place is the MHB, whose dimensions are changed to have a dramatic effect on the reaction, in addition to the use of cooling tubes or fins. In relative terms, the small-diameter MHR can start and complete the reaction process earlier than the big-diameter MHR when the height is constant.32,115 The ratio of radius (R) to height (H) is known as the aspect ratio when both the MHR height and radius are altered. The setting of aspect ratio has less effect on the reaction for the MHB with high thermal conductivity, whereas the progress of the MHB can be improved by using a reasonable aspect ratio for the low-thermal conductivity MHB, as shown in Fig. 9a.116 Hence, the dimensions of the MHB must be taken into account based on a combination of aspect ratio, expense, and thermal conductivity of the MHB.
 Fig. 9  (a) Variation in the hydrogen content with the MHR aspect ratio116 and (b) schematic of the structure of the rectangular MHR.120 
Most MHRs are cylindrical, but there are also a few elliptical87,117 and rectangular MHRs.105,118–120 Elliptical MHRs can provide a more compact MHB than cylindrical MHRs with the same MH volume. The use of stackable rectangular MHRs (Fig. 9b) can address the issues of cooling media leakage generated by cylindrical MHRs' corrosion and the strains.
2.5 Other structural designs
The honeycomb metal structure resembles fins, which enhances heat transport during the reaction. Afzal et al.121,122 constructed a MHR with a hexagonal honeycomb heat transfer enhancement network (Fig. 10a) by adding 50 kg MH, which can achieve 90% hydrogenation (about 600 g H2) in 7200 s. It provides equivalent volumetric efficiency while significantly reducing the system weight compared to other large hydrogen storage devices. Bhouri et al.123 created a metal honeycomb structure (Fig. 10b) that had a bigger surface area and a significantly faster reaction rate. Corgnale et al.124 assessed the effectiveness of the honeycomb structure with the MOF-5 as the MH. What is more, Bai et al.125 changed the cylindrical cooling straight tubes into a rectangle shape structure (Fig. 10c), which decreased the time needed for hydrogen absorption by almost 40%. Larpruenrudee et al.126 and Eisapour et al.127 proposed a semi-cylindrical coil heat exchanger (SCHE) and a multi-zone configuration in the MHB, respectively, where significantly lower MHB temperatures and faster absorption rate can be observed. Lewis et al.128 reported the use of the MHR with an embossed plate heat exchanger (EPHX) and created four different flow field designs: parallel, pin-type, vertical serpentine, and horizontal serpentine, among which the serpentine flow-field EPHX presented better heat transfer and faster hydrogen storage ability.

3 Addition of thermal conductivity enhancers
There is heat transfer within the MHB, between the MHB and hydrogen, between the MHB and the external environment for a system composed of hydrogen and MH, where heat conduction predominates, while convective and radiative heat transfers are typically ignored.129 The increase in hydrogen concentration (the ratio of the number of hydrogen atoms to the number of metal atoms) in the hydrogen storage alloy (metal status) will cause a linear rise of the effective thermal conductivity of the metal hydride bed (hydride status). The hydrogenation reaction results in the expansion of the metal lattice, which leads to an increase in the contact area of MH particles and thus exhibits an improvement in thermal conductivity. The MHB composed of alloy/hydride is the direct bearer of the heat absorbed and released during the hydrogen absorption and desorption of MH, but its thermal conductivity is usually in the range of 0.1–1.5 W m−1 K−1.14 It is difficult to complete the heat transfer in a definite time, which will hinder the process of hydrogen charge and discharge. Additionally, the volume expansion and contraction of the MHB will cause powdering and agglomeration in the cycle of hydrogen absorption and desorption, which can further reduce the thermal conductivity, even below 0.1 W m−1 K−1 in some cases.130 Improving thermal conductivity and shortening the distance of heat transfer are efficient methods for enhancing heat exchange according to the Fourier's law of heat transfer. For this reason, the effective thermal conductivity of the MHB can be enhanced by the addition of thermal conductivity enhancers such as copper mesh, metal foams, and ENG. The achievements from recent years are listed in Table 1, which shows the average thermal conductivity of the composite structure of MH materials and thermal conductivity enhancers, which can be measured by experimental methods such as the flash method and the absolute steady-state method.131,132

As shown in Fig. 11a, the metal foam with the porous structure can completely fill the heat transfer unit without accumulating the thermal mass of the system, which makes it a good choice for heat exchangers.154,155 As shown in Table 1, the thermal conductivity of the MHB is elevated to 8–10 W m−1 K−1 by adding foam materials. The heat transfer capacity of the MHB is governed by the conduction resistance of the foam, the resistance among the hydride materials, and the resistance of the hydrogen within the alloy materials. Consequently, it is vital to choose the appropriate materials and pore size.139 There are nickel, zinc, titanium, and copper foams that are frequently used besides the aluminum foam listed in Table 1, but the aluminum foam is the best choice since it has a higher thermal conductivity and a lower thermal mass.156–158 The smaller the pore size is, the higher the heat transfer area per unit volume of the vessel can be, which can produce a higher heat transfer rate.137 When the volume fraction of the metal foam exceeds the limit value, it leads to a decrease in hydrogen storage capacity, while the reaction time can be prolonged if the volume fraction of the metal foam is less.159 The optimal amount of the foam added is dependent on the size of the MHR, saturation time of the MHB, and form of foam added.64,160,161

As shown in Fig. 11b, the MHR with the metal foam added shows a 60% faster hydrogen absorption rate than the MHR without metal foam during the testing of the whole MHR.156 The copper foam is more efficient for MH heat transmission in comparison to the MHR using copper fins.162 The MH with the nickel foam is put into a 420 L hydrogen storage tank as a block, which has a volumetric hydrogen storage of 40 kg H2 per m3.163 There are several drawbacks to the usage of the metal foam: high contact resistance between the alloy powder and the metal foam, difficulty in densifying the powder in the foam, a large proportion of metal foams (lower hydrogen storage capacity), and expensive production.
The thermal conductivity of the MHB is raised by the encapsulation to 6 W m−1 K−1, which can be applied to every corner of the MHB and takes up less space than the metal foam,164 as shown in Fig. 11c. The encapsulation materials can be chosen from copper and nickel. The thickness of the coating layer after encapsulation is mostly 1–5 μm, and the particle size of the encapsulated MH is usually 20 μm. The blocks obtained with the pressing process have 30% volume expansion after 1000 cycles, but no surface cracks.165,166 The encapsulation treatment slightly interferes with the diffusion of hydrogen into the alloy compared to the unencapsulated blocks, but instead of degrading the kinetics, it boosts the hydrogen uptake rate and curbs the deactivation of the MHB.167 Chen et al.163 chemically coated MH with 10 wt% copper and put it into a 500 L hydrogen storage tank, in which the mass and volume hydrogen density of the tank were tested to be 1.1 wt% and 25 kg H2 per m3, respectively, and it was equipped with electric bicycles to meet the speed of 30–40 km h−1 for 4–5 h. The encapsulation has two barriers: expensive cost, which is detrimental to economic growth, and difficulty in controlling the process, which makes it simple to have an overly thick plating somewhere and diminishes the permeability of hydrogen.
The continuous heat transfer path is formed by interconnecting ENG, aluminum powder, and copper powder on the MHB,132 which can speed up the heat transfer, and they are easier to operate and have higher thermal conductivity than the metal foam and the encapsulation treatment.143,144,168,169 The amount of ENG added is in the range of 0–30 wt%, and that of aluminum powder and copper powder is in the range of 0–20 wt%. The MHB mixed with aluminum powder or copper powder is usually pressed into a block by using sintering, but it brings thermodynamic loss during the sintering process.170 Moreover, the aluminum powder or copper powder can form a solid solution with MH (e.g. Al12Mg17 and Al3Mg2), as shown in Fig. 11d, which can reduce the mass hydrogen storage density.171,172 This problem is solved when the MHB is combined with ENG via cold pressing and it can control the thermal conductivity, porosity, and permeability of the MHB by controlling ENG parameters (e.g. size, content, and incorporation form).145,173–175 For instance, Pohlmann et al.175 changed the radial thermal conductivity of the MHB from 2.4 to 62.8 W m−1 K−1 while maintaining the axial thermal conductivity between 2 and 8 W m−1 K−1 by adjusting the ENG content and pressing pressure. The test of the MHR with ENG shows that the hydrogen absorption process is controlled by hydrogen mass transfer in the early stage and by MHB heat transfer in the later stage. The hydrogen absorption rate rises as the ENG content increases and the MHR with ENG has a higher reaction rate than that of the MHR without ENG. Furthermore, the larger the block diameter is, the longer the hydrogen absorption time is due to the longer heat dissipation path.176,177 The combination of ENG with fins and a central cooling tube (Fig. 11e) further enlarges the heat dissipation area of the MHB, which has been tested to absorb 100 nL H2 in 25 min.178
The MH can cause volume expansion and contraction during the hydrogen absorption and desorption process, and the stress generated by the continuous volume change causes MH to break down into smaller MH.179 After multiple cycles of hydrogen charge and discharge, the number of small particles increases and they gradually accumulate at the bottom of the MHR, leading to powder agglomeration, which not only causes a decrease in the amount of hydrogen absorbed and released but also causes dramatic stress.180 Long-cycle mechanical stability of the MHB is maintained by pressing treatment.141,181 The joining of foams, ENG, aluminum powder, etc., can also play a role in hindering the agglomeration of MH powder.182–184 The MHR with a nickel foam was evaluated for 100 cycles of hydrogen absorption and release, in which there were no volume expansion or agglomeration of the powder and the MHR structure was well preserved.163 After 5000 cycles of testing, the volume and diameter of blocks of the copper encapsulation were expanded by about 30% and 9%, respectively, without any cracks or obvious disintegration.185 The MHB with 10 wt% ENG was set up for the experiment for 1000 cycles.186 The thermal conductivity of the MHB dropped from 40 W m−1 K−1 to 12.7 W m−1 K−1 upon undergoing 250 cycles, where it eventually stabilized around 10–15 W m−1 K−1. Although the heat conductivity of the MHB has decreased, it was still much higher than that of the widely used loose powder bed. The block's original cylindrical form with the central hole can still be seen (Fig. 11f) despite a slight rise in the block's height and several radial cracks.
4 Phase change material
As an energy management material, the PCM can effectively compensate for the time and space difference in the process of energy use, which is now widely used in buildings, solar energy, and industrial waste heat collection.187,188 Heat storage and release in PCMs are dependent on phase change. PCMs can store the heat released during hydrogen absorption and supply it to the MHB during hydrogen desorption in the MHR, which reduces the use of external heat sources, improves the efficiency of energy utilization, and enhances the heat transfer effect of the MHB.189–191 As shown in Fig. 12a, the early PCM designs for the MHB are comparable to the external cooling jacket form, where absorption near the PCM area is finished earlier than the center area of the MHB.192 The spherical MHR with a PCM jacket has a bigger thermal contact area and lower thermal resistance than the cylindrical MHR with a PCM jacket, which reduces the time required for 80% hydrogen storage by 22%.193,194 Besides a single PCM jacket, the MHB with cascaded PCM jackets offers nearly 16% and 30% improvement in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation durations, respectively.195
 Fig. 12  Schematic of the metal hydride reactor equipped with a PCM: (a) jacket structure;192 (b) conical structure;196 (c) sandwich structure by Alqahtani et al.;198 (d) sandwich structure by Ye et al.;200 (e) combined cooling straight tube structure; and (f) combined U-shaped tube structure.204 
There is insufficient heat absorption when the thickness of PCM incorporation is inadequate, which affects heat transfer, and it also affects heat transmission because of the poor thermal conductivity inside the PCM if the thickness is too high. For this reason, the contact form between the MHB and PCM must be reasonably designed. Ardahaie et al.196 designed the structure of a conical PCM jacket to increase the added thickness of the PCM in the transverse direction of the reactor, which significantly improved the bad heat transfer in the upper part of the cylindrical-shaped reactor, as shown in Fig. 12b. Mellouli et al.197 introduced a PCM wrapped by several cylindrical tubes, spherical shells and hexagonal tubes inside the reaction bed, respectively, on the basis of the PCM jacket structure. With the same total weight of MH and the PCM, the MHR with the addition of PCMs inside and outside the MHB had a better heat transfer rate, in which the MHR with PCMs wrapped by cylindrical tubes had the largest improvement in hydrogen uptake time of 58.1%. Alqahtani et al.198 and Ye et al.199,200 developed sandwich MH-PCM structures, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12c and d. The sandwich MH-PCM structures enlarged the contact area between the MHB and the PCM. The results of simulation obtained by Alqahtani et al. showed that the required time for the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes of the MHR with sandwich structure was cut down by 81.5% and 73%, respectively. In addition, Ye et al.200 established the equation for the MH-to-PCM mass ratio, which provided a basis for the design and performance adjustment of the MH-PCM system.
The PCM can also be combined with various thermal management methods such as metal foams and cooling tubes as mentioned above.157,158,189,201–205 Rabienataj et al.189 pointed out that the addition of metal foams to the PCM reduced the MHR hydrogen discharge time from 300 min to 190 min. Mellouli et al.204 and Alqahtani et al.203 both installed cooling straight tubes inside the MHB and a PCM jacket outside the MHB, and the basic structure of the MHR is shown in Fig. 12e. The former experimental results indicated that this structure could reduce the hydrogen absorption time by 94%, and the latter found a17 times increase in the efficiency of the whole device. In addition, Mellouli et al.204 designed the MHR structure of the PCM synergistic U-tubes, as shown in Fig. 12f. The U-shaped tubes were inserted in both the MHB and PCM separately, taking away the heat from the MHB and transferring it to the PCM, which speeded up the heat transfer rate from the MHB to the PCM.204 In general, the MHR using PCMs in combination with other thermal management methods has a better heat transfer rate than that using PCMs alone, but there is the problem of excessive volume share of thermal management devices.
5 Conclusion
The main problem confronted by the MHR is the extremely low thermal conductivity of the MHB (0.1–1.5 W m−1 K−1), which restricts the heat transfer during hydrogen absorption and desorption. The paper provides a comprehensive review of the thermal management of the MHR from three perspectives: (1) enhancement of the heat transfer with the external environment from the MHR structure; (2) improvement of the effective thermal conductivity of the MHB from the material aspect; and (3) adopting PCMs to strengthen the heat transformation inside the MHB. The key objective of all three perspectives is to reduce thermal resistance and promote the thermal management efficiency of the MHB.
(1) The improvement of the MHR structure provides the MHB with a larger heat transfer area and reinforces heat transfer to the external environment. It is easy to assemble the external cooling jacket, which is the best choice for the small MHR. Temperature gradients within the MHB can be generated for the large MHR by the external cooling jacket alone via heat transmission. The ideal selections for the large MHR are spiral tubes and tree-shaped fins; nevertheless, these methods pose technical challenges related to design, fabrication and assembly. As a result, to meet the objectives of practical applications, it is necessary to simplify the design of cooling tubes, fins, etc., while satisfying the MHB heat and mass transfer requirements after material selections.
(2) The thermal conductivity of the MHB can be raised to 10–20 W m−1 K−1 or even higher by adding ENG, metal foam, aluminum powder, and encapsulation treatment. The combination of pressing also reduces the appearance of powder agglomeration, but decreases the porosity, permeability, and hydrogen storage capacity of the MHB, in which ENG demonstrates the advantages in process, cost and performance. Subsequently, a cycle performance index needs to be determined and the practical application of the block cycle performance needs to be explored. It is crucial to explain the mechanism for the appearance of cracks and the change in performance during the cycle.
(3) The use of PCMs is a technically feasible solution to store the heat generated by hydrogen absorption and release it to MH for hydrogen discharge, which avoids dependence on external energy sources. Extensive research on PCMs has mainly focused on simulation, while actual MHR productions are lacking. It is not obvious how effective their guidance is for practical manufacture despite the series of simple models that have been proposed. Additionally, the MHR with a PCM jacket produced contained a high proportion of PCMs (63 wt%) and had a relatively low volumetric hydrogen storage density, which was unfavorable for use in practical applications.206 Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the manufacture of the actual MHR equipped with PCMs and find a more suitable PCM.
(4) The heat transfer can be viewed from two different angles on the MHB. First of all, there is heat transfer inside the reaction bed, where the thermal conductivity of the MHB comes into play. The second is the heat transfer that occurs between the MHB and the external environment. The thermal management measures used should all aim to improve both factors simultaneously, as each factor is constrained by the other. The heat transfer bottleneck may not be resolved by simply raising thermal conductivity or enlarging the heat transfer area. Therefore, it is recommended to combine the improvement of the effective thermal conductivity of the reaction bed with structural design and PCMs, like a combination of ENG, PCMs, and an external cooling jacket and fins.
