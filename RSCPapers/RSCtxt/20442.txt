    , Accepted 23rd March 2022First published on 24th March 2022AbstractMetal halide perovskites are highly promising materials for next generation optoelectronic devices, but they suffer from moisture-driven and thermal degradation. We focus on the prototypical light-absorbing methylammonium lead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) crystal that degrades predominantly into lead iodide (PbI2). In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of the structural and optical properties between perovskites coated with spiro-OMeTAD and a discotic liquid crystal (DLC) 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(pentyloxy)triphenylene (HAT5). Butylammonium iodide (BAI) is used as an additive to make hybrid mixed dimensional (MD) and two-dimensional perovskites. We perform aging studies in a lab environment over a period of 45 days and two sets of conditions are tested; the first set is exposed to humidity that varies between 58 and 36%, and the second set was exposed to the environment and additionally was heated at 65 °C in the atmosphere for four hours every day. Our results demonstrate that the DLC HAT5 molecule results in improved long-term stability of hybrid MD BAI substituted Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites. Some concerns about low phase transition temperatures in working devices are also highlighted. The enhanced stability of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices with the use of HATn HTLs provides a promising molecular engineering approach that can be applied in stable next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices.

Design, System, Application
In this work, stability studies are performed on metal halide Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPP) using discotic liquid crystalline (DLC) hole transport layers (HTLs). RPPs are mixed-dimensional layered derivatives of three-dimensional perovskites typically prepared using long alkyl-chain cation substitution, causing periodic splitting of the 3D crystalline structure. We apply a hexa-alkyloxy triphenylene DLC molecule as a HTL on RPP films and perform lifetime and aging studies. DLCs typically form columnar mesophases with varying symmetries of columnar arrangement. The phases are typically constituted of disc-shaped molecules that pi-stack into long-range molecular columns. In addition to the molecular shape, a balance of fluidity (alkyl chains) and rigidity (polyaromatic core) facilitates mesogenic properties. Many DLC molecules, including the prototypical triphenylene HATn, exhibit good hole transporting properties, with high, anisotropic mobilities. In this work, we exploit the hydrophobic nature and uniform film morphology of alkyloxy triphenylene DLC films to demonstrate the enhanced stability of RPP films in comparison with industry standard spiro-OMeTAD. Our results are significant as the vast library of homologous DLCs provide fertile ground for molecular engineering through alignment modulation. Increased stability combined with the highly tunable and preferential optoelectronic properties of RPP phases should stimulate work on next-generation DLC HTL-based perovskite devices.

Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskites are exciting semiconductor materials with applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Crystalline films of these materials are ideal for photovoltaic,1–3 light-emitting diode,4 lasing,5 and photodetecting applications due to their ambipolar charge transport, long diffusion lengths (exceeding 1 μm), good excitonic properties and widely tunable bandgaps.2 Furthermore, the solution processibility and high crystallinity of these materials makes the scalable production of functional devices possible with relatively low investment compared to conventional semiconductor technologies.4
However, despite the many advantages of metal halide perovskite crystals, one of the main limitations of these materials is the lack of stability under working conditions. The methylammonium lead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) system is a prototypical system that exhibits an electronic bandgap of ≈1.5 eV and has been used to demonstrate photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies as high as 21%.1,2 However, the material degrades under thermal stress, humidity (due to the hygroscopic nature of the crystal), ultraviolet exposure6 and ion migration leading to a breakdown of the crystal structure and the formation of lead(II) iodide PbI2.7–9
There has been a significant effort to mitigate the degradation of metal halide perovskites and to make them a commercially viable technology.10,11 Viable routes for addressing moisture instability include substituting the methylammonium cation with alternative alkylammonium cations, the use of passivating encapsulation layers to seal devices,12 and dimensional engineering. The latter is typically accomplished via substituting the cation (e.g., methylammonium) with long alkyl chains (such as butylammonium) into the chemical structure, leading to the formation of Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite phases.13 These phases then help to achieve better hydrophobicity and stability14,15 and can be used to tune the crystal structure from a three-dimensional crystal to a mixed-dimensional and purely two-dimensional perovskite.
Another molecular engineering-based approach towards improving the stability of perovskite solar cells is tailoring the hole transport layer (HTL).16 Working organometallic lead halide perovskite devices require charge transport layers to transport charges (electrons and holes) to and fro the perovskite semiconductor. The typical characteristics of a good HTL include high hole-transport mobility, uniform pinhole-free coverage, electron-blocking and repeatable, stable doping. Furthermore, band-matching between the HOMO level of the hole transport layer (HTL) and valence band of the perovskite semiconductor is important for energetically favorable charge transfer. In conventional n–i–p mesoscopic and planar perovskite solar cells, the most used hole transport layer is the organic semiconducting material spiro-OMeTAD.17 Devices having spiro-OMeTAD as a HTL demonstrated efficiencies up to 21.1%.17–19 However, spiro-based HTLs suffer instabilities due to external degrading factors such as heat and moisture effects.20 Furthermore, spiro-OMeTAD is still an expensive HTL material21 and the oxidative doping technique typically used has repeatability issues.22
Amongst a library of possible hole-transporting materials, thermotropic discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) present an exciting class of materials.23–25 A typical DLC molecule consists of a rigid polyaromatic core and a series of alkyl-chains that add flexibility, fluidity and low temperature processing. The chemical structure of a prototypical hexakis(n-alkyloxy)triphenylene DLC HAT5 can be seen in Fig. 1b. As a result of electronic delocalization in the polyaromatic core and close-ordered molecular packing, DLCs can exhibit high charge transport (notably hole) mobilities via charge hopping. The example molecule used in this study 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(pentyloxy)triphenylene (HAT5) has demonstrated hole mobilities on the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than those of many commonly used HTLs in perovskite devices.26–29 While DLCs have previously been used as charge transport layers in organic solar cells30 and organic light emitting diodes, their application in perovskite devices is relatively unexplored and they present a potentially viable solution. The use of ordered LC HTLs presents an opportunity for low temperature melt infiltration, self-healing at working temperatures, high charge carrier (directional) hopping mobility31 and supramolecular alignment engineering. While conventional work on HTLs typically focuses on conduction and film parameters, the application of LCs allows tailoring of structural properties for achieving desired device performance. This study aims to investigate the effect of incorporating a prototypical triphenylene DLC as a HTL alternative in perovskite devices. To the best of our knowledge, DLC materials have not been used as HTLs in perovskite solar cell or light emitting architectures.

In this work, we compare the passivating effects of spiro-OMeTAD and HAT5 HTLs on perovskite optoelectronic devices. We focus on the prototypical methyl ammonium lead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) system, and its Ruddlesden–Popper derivatives. We compare their passivating effects on quasi-2D butylammonium/methylammonium lead halide perovskites. A complete set of optical (micro-Raman and photoluminescence) and structural (XRD and SEM) techniques are employed to study degradation under ambient and thermally stressed conditions.
Materials and fabrication
TiO2 n-type mesoporous and blocking layer
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (7 ohms per square, 15 × 15 × 1.1 mm3, TFD Inc) were ultrasonicated in deionized water, isopropanol (IPA) (Sigma Aldrich) and acetone (Sigma Aldrich) for five minutes. The substrates were then dried with nitrogen and heated at 120 °C followed by deposition of an electron transport layer (ETL). To prepare an n-type compact titania film, 400 μL of the precursor titanium butoxide (Sigma Aldrich) was added in 6 mL anhydrous IPA, while HCl (Fisher) was the reaction catalyst. The solution was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30s, followed by drying at 110 °C for 10 minutes and then annealing at 550 °C for 1 hour. Subsequently, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited with a 1:4 ethanol diluted titania paste (GreatCell Solar 18 NR-T) solution to prepare an ≈300 nm thick layer. The solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds and annealed at 550 °C in a furnace.
Perovskite film deposition and dimensional engineering
A three-dimensional (3D) methyl ammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1.3 M (each) solutions of MAI (GreatCell Solar) and PbI2 (TCI Chemicals). The solvent was a DMF:DMSO mixture in a ratio of 4:1. The solution was stirred for 1 hour for homogeneous mixing. Subsequently, the MAPbI3 solution was spin-coated on the prepared mesoporous film substrates at a speed of 4000 rpm for 20 seconds and anti-solvent chlorobenzene was sprayed during spin coating. A brown-colored film was observed right after coating, which turned black after annealing at 110 °C for 15 minutes. For mixed dimensional (MD) perovskite preparation, n-butyl ammonium iodide (BAI) was added to the precursor solution (GreatCell Solar). The precursor solution consisted of 1.3 M solutions of PbI2 and MAI, and 2.4 M BAI mixed in a molar ratio of 2:1:1.85. Excess BAI was added in accordance with a previous study32 and chlorobenzene was used as the anti-solvent and the color of the prepared films became red after annealing at 110 °C. For two-dimensional (2D) perovskite films, the preparation method was kept the same, with the exception that BAI was used as the sole cation. Once again, 2.4 M BAI and 1.3 M PbI2 solutions were mixed, and during spin-coating, chlorobenzene was used as the anti-solvent. The prepared films were initially yellow in color and turned orange after annealing.
Hole transport layer (HTL) coating
To deposit HTLs on top of the perovskite films, we prepared 59 mM solutions of spiro-OMeTAD (Solaronix) and HAT5 (Synthon Chemicals) in chlorobenzene (Sigma Aldrich). On each mixed-dimensional perovskite substrate, 40 μL of the HTL solutions were spin-coated at 3000 rpm (ref. 31 and 33) and 2000 rpm (HAT5,26), respectively, for 2 minutes to achieve an ≈250 ± 50 nm thick capping layer.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
To prepare photovoltaic devices for testing open circuit voltage as a function of time, 100 nm Au was deposited on the HTL-coated perovskite films using a 9 mm2 shadow mask via thermal evaporation (Moorfields NanoPVD-T15A).
Experimental techniques and characterization
Micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements (micro-PL) were performed on a custom optical setup with an imaging Horiba photo-spectrometer (iHR550). A 532 nm diode laser was used for excitation. The same setup was also used for Raman spectroscopy, with a 1200 nm grating and 90 second exposure time with a 5 mW laser power. For absorption spectroscopy, an Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer was used and titania coated FTO substrates were used as a reference. For optical bandgap measurements, a diffuse reflectance setup (JASCO V-770 spectrophotometer ILN-925) was used with a wavelength range of 300–900 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed using a Bruker D2 Phaser (Cu α-tube, λ = 1.54 Å) with an operating current and voltage of 10 mA and 30 kV, respectively, and a step size of 0.05° (2θ = 5–60°) under room temperature conditions. The XRD patterns of all the samples were labeled with the calculated XRD data using MDI Jade software.
A NovaNanoSem 450 SEM setup was used for capturing electron micrographs. To measure the phase transition temperature of the liquid crystalline hole transport layer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 setup with a scan rate of 5 °C min−1 for both heating and cooling. For polarized optical microscopy of the HTLs, polarizing microscopes (AmScope and a custom setup) were used. For hydrophobicity testing of perovskite films and HTLs, contact angle measurements (Kruss DSA30 Drop Shape Analyzer) were performed. Voc measurements of thermally aged photovoltaic devices were performed under AM 1.5 conditions using a solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech, CT50AAA). All thermal aging studies were performed on a hot-plate (Chemat KW-4AH) under ambient atmospheric conditions.
Results and discussion
In this work, we compare the stability of perovskite films using spiro-OMeTAD and HAT5 as HTLs in potential devices. The chemical structures of both spiro-OMeTAD and HAT5 are illustrated in Fig. 1a and b, respectively.34–36 While spiro consists of several aromatic cores with significant delocalization, HAT5 has a rigid central triphenylene core and six relatively long C5H11 alkyl chains (Fig. 1b) that add fluidity. Polarized optical micrographs of spin coated prospective HTLs on glass substrates at room temperature are illustrated in Fig. 1c and d. It can be seen that on glass, the uniaxially birefringent HAT5 molecule exhibits a characteristic fan-like texture under crossed polarizers at 25 °C, which is indicative of the planar alignment of the columnar axes.26,37,38 The alignment of the columnar director is important for optoelectronics applications because hole mobility is highly anisotropic. The polarized micrographs of spiro exhibit a uniform dark texture due to a lack of noticeable birefringence as well as long range order. The optical bandgaps of spiro-OMeTAD and HAT5 are 2.9 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively, extracted using UV-vis Tauc plots (Fig. 1e).
To determine the hydrophobicity of the spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD and HAT5 films, contact angle measurements were performed on the spin-coated films using de-ionized water (Fig. 1f). The average contact angle of water droplets for HAT5 and spiro-OMeTAD was measured to be 99.6° and 72.4°, respectively, indicating that HAT5 is more hydrophobic than spiro-OMeTAD. It is hypothesized that this is due to the DLC molecule's non-polar periphery alkyl chains which can play an important role in passivating perovskite devices such as solar cells by protecting the films from moisture.
HAT5 is a thermotropic LC and exhibits phase transitions on heating from room temperature. DSC measurements on heating of a HAT5 sample are illustrated in Fig. 1g. It can be seen that there is an endothermic peak corresponding to a crystalline to liquid crystal (Cr–LC) transition at 67 °C and another endothermic peak at 121 °C corresponding to an isotropic (LC–I) transition.41 The low working temperatures are both a valuable property as well as a cause of concern for the use of HATn charge transport layers in photovoltaics, as the working devices can typically reach temperatures beyond the phase transition temperature of HAT5, and this can affect film morphology in day/night cycles. A possible advantage, however, is that the low Cr–LC transition temperature can facilitate self-healing of the HTLs in working devices, which can be achieved through active or passive thermal cycling. On the other hand, the low LC–I temperatures mean that HTLs can be potentially melt-filled into large panels, something that is not practical with a HTL such as spiro-OMeTAD that has a melting point of ≈248 °C.26,42 The DLC films in this study are in the crystalline (Cr) phase as characterization is performed at room temperature.
Three-dimensional (3D) methylammonium lead iodide as well as Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites were prepared and characterized. The RP perovskites were prepared by incorporating varying molar ratios of butyl ammonium iodide (BAI).43 Photographs of prepared films of pure and mixed perovskites are shown in Fig. 2a, and color variations due to the optical bandgap are apparent. The incorporation of long chain BAI ions results in layering of the structure of the 3D perovskite. This in turn also affects the morphology and optical characteristics of these samples.44 The chemical formula for the prepared RP perovskites is (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, where n is the number of incorporated MAPbI3 layers. For purely 2D perovskites, n = 1 and n = ∞ for 3D structured perovskites. Fig. 2b illustrates a schematic of the layering process in RP perovskites.

Fig. 2c illustrates a comparison of the XRD spectra of two-dimensional (2D), mixed dimensional (MD) and three-dimensional (3D) perovskite films immediately after deposition. The peaks of all the samples match well with those in the literature.44–46 A PbI2 peak is not observed at 12.7° (see Fig. 3d for reference) in any of the samples on the day of deposition. The MD perovskites (predominantly n = 2 BA2MAPb2I7) show preferred growth along the (111) plane. This plane corresponds to the diagonal vertical growth of the perovskite and is beneficial toward the enhancement of the charge collection efficiency.47 SEM micrographs (Fig. 2d) illustrate that the 3D, 2D and mixed dimensional films have different morphologies and grain sizes, consistent with the varying stoichiometries and crystal structures. To study the interaction with water, contact angle measurements were performed (Fig. 2e). Due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of BAI as compared to MAI, higher contact angles are measured in the mixed dimensional (MD) and pure (2D) structures as compared to higher dimensional perovskites.

Micro-PL spectra of the films (Fig. 2f) match with those in the literature.48,49 In the case of 2D perovskites, an emission maximum is observed very close to the pump laser (532 nm) due to a larger optical bandgap. Interestingly, in the case of MD perovskites, we observe excitonic signatures with peaks at 580 nm, 620 nm, and 640 nm. Based on similar observations in the literature, it is hypothesized that while the dominant phase is the n = 2 BA2MAPb2I7, excitonic contributions from mixed multiple (n) quantum wells are responsible for multiple peaks.11,42,48 This non-homogeneous, mixed dimensional quantum well layering is hypothesized to be a result of rapid crystallization due to a room-temperature spin-coating deposition process and has been reported in other studies.48,51 Tauc plot measurements as shown in Fig. 2g estimate the optical band gap of the fabricated 2D, MD, and 3D perovskites as 2.42 eV, 1.95 eV, and 1.54 eV, respectively.52–54 The UV-vis spectrum of PbI2 is added for comparison.55
A qualitative comparison of the stability of 3D, MD and 2D BAI substituted MAPbI3 perovskites is illustrated in Fig. 3. The photographs in Fig. 3a illustrate the gradual decay of all the perovskite films. The three perovskite films show different colors due to the differences in optical bandgaps, consistent with the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 2g. A clear trend is observed in the photographs where lower dimensional films are more stable as the transformation of the color of the films into characteristic PbI2 is delayed. Furthermore, all the aged (heating at 65 °C for four hours daily) perovskite films degrade faster than the films aged at room temperature, hypothesized to be a result of ion migration effects.51 The alkylammonium lead halide perovskite materials are sensitive to temperature and moisture. The 3D perovskite film decomposes into PbI2, MA and HI, a process accelerated by temperature. The reason for temperature sensitivity, as discussed in ref. 56 as well, is that MA and HI can escape from the perovskite surface leaving iodide vacancies. At a higher temperature, the iodide has a higher energy to enable a faster diffusion from the inside of the perovskite film to the surface vacancies. With the increase of vacancy defects at the surface, the movement of iodide within the perovskite film and subsequent degradation are accelerated.56 This effect can be seen in the photographs of 3D perovskite films in Fig. 3a as heated films decay more rapidly in comparison to the non-heated ones.
Moreover, it can be seen in Fig. 3c that after six days of aging, the Raman spectrum of MAPbI3 starts to exhibit fingerprint modes corresponding to partial transformation of the perovskite crystal lattice into PbI2. Moreover, powder XRD scans of the 3D perovskite films (Fig. 3b) also support the results presented in Fig. 3a. Both XRD and Raman data of the 3D perovskite on day 0 shows the pure phase of MAPbI3. However, the film started to decay with time and exhibit fingerprint modes corresponding to partial transformation of the perovskite crystal lattice into PbI2 on day 6. The stability of 3D perovskites can be increased by reducing the dimension as presented in Fig. 3a. The 3D to 2D structural transition can be controlled by the size of the organic cation, in particular when it exceeds the critical size of Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (TF). From a device perspective, there are both advantages and drawbacks to a 3D to 2D transition. The main advantages of 2D structures are increased thermal stability in comparison to 3D perovskites, larger cations hamper internal ionic motion and their relatively hydrophobic character leads to improved stability in moisture.57 The increased stability in the 2D structure in comparison to 3D can be observed in Fig. 3a. However, the wider optical bandgap of 2D perovskites (2.5 eV) makes them less desirable for photovoltaic applications in single-junction devices, but might still be desirable in multi-junction as well as blue/UV light emitting diode applications. For most optoelectronic applications however, including single-junction photovoltaic devices, hybrid MD films present a good compromise between 3D and 2D perovskites. Fig. 3a and 2g demonstrate the higher stability and relatively desirable band gap, respectively, of MD perovskites.
Subsequently, stability tests were performed on HTL coated MD perovskite films and HTL coated 2D perovskites were not included in this study as their shallow valence band (Fig. 2h compared to the inset in Fig. 1e) makes hole transfer energetically unfavorable with both spiro and HATn-based HTLs. Aging studies were performed over 45 days, with a relative humidity that varies between 58 and 36% and a measured lab temperature between 28 and 21 °C. Comparative XRD studies of the stability of spiro and HAT5-coated MD perovskite films are presented in Fig. 4a. The peaks observed at 8.22°, 12.67° and 25.8° are typical PbI2 (JCPDS card no.73-1752) peaks and correspond to the crystal planes (002), (003) and (013), respectively. The peak observed at 9.05° belongs to BA2MAPb2I7.47 The unlabeled peaks at 9.5° and 10.7° are hypothesized to be associated with either a complex of PbI2–DMF, a complex of PbI2–MAI–DMF, or a hydrate compound (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O. It can be seen that in the spiro-coated films, clear signatures corresponding to PbI2 are observed on day 45. However, in the case of HAT5 coated MD perovskites, the XRD spectra are relatively unchanged after being exposed to air at room temperature for as long as 45 days after fabrication.

SEM analysis was performed to investigate the surface morphology of the HTL-coated samples. In the SEM micrographs, a ‘blurry’ morphology of the MD perovskites was observed (Fig. 4b), due to charging effects. Both HTLs yield a mostly uniform film coverage with few pinholes. Fig. 4d illustrates a cross-sectional view of the perovskite thin film showing the layered structure. The figure shows a compact, well-defined perovskite thin film with few grain boundaries. Photographs of the deposited films were taken periodically to keep a record of visual changes occurring in the films' surface. Fig. 4c illustrates the variation of photographs of the surface of the MD perovskite films coated with spiro and HAT5. The films are more stable than their non-HTL coated counterparts (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, it can be seen that there is a gradual increase in yellow-colored regions in almost all the samples due to the breakdown of the perovskite structure and formation of PbI2. However, this breakdown is much more gradual in the case of the HAT5-coated perovskite films than the spiro-coated films. These visual results correlate well with the XRD results.
In addition to visual and structural analysis, optical absorption, emission and vibrational spectroscopy can reveal changes in properties relevant to optoelectronic devices. Fig. 5 shows the variation in the optical properties of the perovskite films with aging using UV-vis, micro-PL and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 5a shows the room-temperature micro-PL spectra of both films. At day 0, both samples exhibit contributions from excitons originating from spatially distributed quantum wells of varying effective dimensionalities,48 as seen in Fig. 2f. The PL spectra of both films are consistent with the XRD data shown in Fig. 4a, where we found traces of (BA)2(MA)Pb2I7 (corresponding to n = 2) along with contributions from mixed multiple quantum wells (MQWs).50 Moreover, the graph shows that the excitonic properties of both films are relatively stable till 22 days. However, the breakdown of the perovskite crystal structure eventually leads to a loss of characteristic emission properties, as can be seen in the micro-PL spectra of spiro-OMeTAD coated films exhibiting degradation into PbI2 (ref. 52) in measurements taken 45 days after fabrication.

(b) UV-vis spectra of MD perovskites. (c) Non-resonant Raman spectra recorded as a function of time of MD perovskites. 

Fig. 5b illustrates the UV-vis absorption spectra of MD perovskites at days 0 and 45. Initially, the absorption onset of both sets of films is at ≈635 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.95 eV. In addition to the primary absorption edge, we observed another peak above the absorption edge region. This secondary absorption can be attributed to contributions from mixed MQWs,42,48 correlating with the micro-PL data. While the absorption spectra of the MD films taken 45 days after fabrication exhibited lower optical absorption in both HTL samples, the individual excitonic absorption peaks are still weakly evident in the HAT5-coated samples (Fig. 5b) but difficult to discern in the spiro-coated samples.

Fig. 5c compares the Raman modes of MD perovskites with the two HTLs. In the case of the spiro-OMeTAD coated perovskite films, hybrid MD films exhibit signature peaks at 97 cm−1 and 111 cm−1 corresponding to Pb–I bond stretching modes (Fig. 3c) in measurements taken as early as six days after fabrication. Furthermore, on subsequent days, the appearance of peaks at 75 cm−1 and 170 cm−1 (Pb–I characteristic peaks) in the case of the spiro-OMeTAD coated samples indicate that a larger fraction of the film has degraded into PbI2. Comparatively, the micro-Raman, micro-PL and UV-vis studies on aged films (without heating) indicate the substantially better stability and preservation of excitonic properties in HAT5 coated films. It is interesting to observe that the micro-Raman spectra are able to show small changes in the MD perovskite films before they become evident in the photographs in Fig. 4c.
In addition to studying passive aging under benchtop conditions, a systematic study under thermal stress was also performed to observe if HTL-based passivation can improve stability under heating as well. Samples with HAT5 and spiro-coated HTLs on MD perovskites were heated at 65 °C for four hours in every twenty-four hour period for 45 days. During this period, the optical and structural properties of the films were studied at regular intervals. XRD analysis of the films at regular intervals within the 45 day period is illustrated in Fig. 6a. The XRD spectra once again indicate an increased contribution of PbI2 with time. However, the degradation is seen as early as day 22 in the case of the spiro-coated samples and at day 45 in both sets of samples (but with pronounced PbI2 peaks in the spiro samples). Fig. 6c illustrates the time-series photographs of the surface of prepared films that have been subjected to both thermal stress and humidity. A quick comparison with the photographs of non-heated samples (Fig. 4c) shows that (as expected) faster degradation is seen in the heated samples. Furthermore, from a visual standpoint, while we see prominent degradation of both HTL films, faster degradation is seen in the spiro-coated samples.

(d) Photographs of the HTL-coated MD films recorded as a function of days after fabrication. 
In addition to ion migration effects in the perovskite due to heating common to both HTL samples, another reason for degradation in the HAT5 samples is the liquid crystalline nature of the material. As discussed in Fig. 1g, HAT5 has a Cr–LC phase transition temperature of ≈67 °C. In our studies, we placed the samples on a programmable hot plate set at 65 °C for four hours every day for 45 days. It is hypothesized that repeated heating and cooling so close to the phase transition temperature leads to repeated gradual melting and recrystallization of the HAT5 films. The bare perovskite is eventually exposed to the external environment, leading to faster degradation as compared to un-heated samples. The choice of temperature (65 °C) was made to emulate standardized solar cell testing that perovskite solar cells will have to comply with. This de-wetting is seen in the POM micrographs (Fig. 6b.i and ii) of non-heated and heated HAT5 coated MD perovskite samples 45 days after deposition. The non-heated samples show a characteristic ‘fan-like’ texture corresponding to the planar alignment of the DLC columns, whereas nucleated crystals are observed in the heated samples. The SEM micrographs in Fig. 6c.i and ii illustrate the nano-scale surface morphology. In the case of the heated HAT5 perovskites, the underlying perovskite crystals are relatively visible in the heated sample as compared to those in the un-heated sample, corroborating the overall recrystallization hypothesis.
Optical characterization of the aged HTL-coated 65 °C heated films is summarized in Fig. 7. In the PL spectra of heated HTL coated MD perovskites, significant changes in the spectra are evident with time (Fig. 7a) in both the HAT5 and spiro-coated samples 22 days after deposition. UV-vis spectroscopy, like the PL spectra, illustrates significant changes by day 45, and indicates a near complete breakdown of the perovskite structure into PbI2 in both HTLs. Fig. 7c summarizes the Raman spectra of heated films. Once again, like the Raman spectra of unheated films (Fig. 5c), the spiro-OMeTAD films exhibit two modes at ≈97 cm−1 and ≈111 cm−1, as early as 6 days after fabrication in the case of the hybrid MD films. However, since these films have been thermally cycled between 65 °C and room temperature, the HAT5 MD films exhibited weak modes at ≈111 cm−1 in measurements on day 6, and very prominent peaks at ≈97 cm−1 as well on subsequent days.

It has been seen in the preceding aging studies that while non-heated HAT5 (Fig. 4) films are substantially more stable than the corresponding spiro-coated films, their performance in heating studies (while comparatively better) still requires improvement. The hypothesized reason for this is de-wetting of the DLC HTL, which represents a challenge not only for stability, but also for long term performance of practical devices. As a confirmation on the passivating behavior of HAT5 films, however, we summarize the results of another aging study performed on hybrid MD films in Fig. 8. Perovskite films were coated with HAT5 (Fig. 8a) and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 8b), and in this case, the films were heated at 45 °C for four hours each day for 26 days, and then further aged till 134 days after fabrication under ambient lab conditions. It can be seen from the results that at temperatures much lower than the Cr–LC transition temperature of HAT5, the HTL has a substantial passivating effect under humidity as well as at raised temperature.

Illustration of testing under AM1.5 conditions (d.ii) (inset: photograph of device with 9 mm2 Au electrodes). 
It is clear, however, that while practical devices such as perovskite LEDs can work with a HTL like HAT5, for applications in solar cells, which can easily get heated beyond 65 °C, a HTL solution like HAT5 that not only is both hydrophobic and easily aligned with high carrier mobility, but also has higher phase transition temperatures will be required. One possible solution is to test shorter chain HATn derivatives with n < 5 that have higher phase transition temperatures. However, this will present a tradeoff with the higher hydrophilicity of the shorter chain homologues. Another alternative is to apply DLC molecules such as those based on coronenes, pyrene, perylene, porphyrin and phthalocyanine central cores as larger core sizes raise transition temperatures while also supporting higher charge carrier mobilities and conductivity.58
Another important aspect in the application of DLCs such as HAT5 as HTLs in perovskite optoelectronics is columnar alignment. Molecular systems such as triphenylene HAT5 exhibit a nearly three orders of magnitude higher carrier mobility when parallel to the columnar director as compared to perpendicular ones. Fig. 8c illustrates three possible alignments that the HAT5 molecules can assume on the MD perovskite surface. Analyzing the optical micrographs in Fig. 6b.ii. however rules out the possibility of homeotropic alignment (Fig. 8c.ii), a regime that can be useful for out-of-plane devices such as solar cells. We hypothesize that the molecules align as either purely planar (Fig. 8c.i) or in a hybrid configuration with a planar interface with air (8c.iii). Engineering columnar alignment presents both an opportunity and a challenge in future perovskite devices utilizing DLC charge transport layers. There are many methods to control alignment, such as solvent engineering, the application of external magnetic fields and surface engineering59–61 and alignment will have to be tailored to particular device architectures for maximum benefit.
The preparation of efficient light emitting or photovoltaic perovskite devices incorporating HATn HTLs warrants a careful study of doping mechanisms. As a demonstrative device, perovskite solar cells were prepared by evaporating 100 nm of Au as a back contact on the HTL-coated un-doped perovskite films. The devices were prepared under ambient conditions, and aged in a similar manner. The variation in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) as a function of time of the HAT5 and spiro-OMeTAD devices prepared in an identical manner in our laboratory is presented in Fig. 8d. The data presented are of five of the best 9 mm2 devices of each type, chosen from a set of twelve devices. The devices were heated at 45 °C for eight hours everyday and stored as well as tested under ambient benchtop conditions. The mean voltage and the associated standard uncertainty are plotted in both cases. It is encouraging to see that the initial Voc values of the HAT5 HTL devices are comparable to those of the spiro-coated devices. Furthermore, in the devices tested, lower day to day variation in the measured average Voc was seen in the HAT5 devices. Whether this is solely an effect of higher hydrophobicity, or this involves differences in charge carrier dynamics at the HTL/perovskite interface is a matter that requires further study. Furthermore, detailed doping analysis as well as columnar alignment engineering is required to extract the best performance from future DLC-based perovskite optoelectronic devices.
Conclusions
In this work, BAI was used as an additive in the 3D MAPbI3 perovskite crystal structure to prepare hybrid MD and 2D perovskites. Humidity and thermal-stress aging studies were conducted over a 45 day period at both ambient and elevated (65 °C) temperatures in a lab environment. In addition, a set of HTL-coated samples were compared after 134 days of heating at 45 °C for four hours every day. Our results show that the HAT5 coated samples exhibited a significant improvement in the stability of MD perovskites aged at ambient temperatures compared with industry standard spiro-OMeTAD coated samples. Moreover, in aging studies conducted at elevated temperatures (65 °C), HAT5-coated perovskites were once again more stable than spiro-coated films, but they degraded faster than un-heated films. Part of the faster degradation of HAT5 films in the case of heating to 65 °C is de-wetting of the HAT5 HTL from the perovskite after repeated melting and recrystallization cycles. The open-circuit voltage of un-doped HTL-coated MD perovskite solar cells is measured as a test case for potential device performance with aging. Overall, HAT5 exhibited better stability in both heated and ambient aged MD perovskite samples.

Design, System, Application
In this work, stability studies are performed on metal halide Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPP) using discotic liquid crystalline (DLC) hole transport layers (HTLs). RPPs are mixed-dimensional layered derivatives of three-dimensional perovskites typically prepared using long alkyl-chain cation substitution, causing periodic splitting of the 3D crystalline structure. We apply a hexa-alkyloxy triphenylene DLC molecule as a HTL on RPP films and perform lifetime and aging studies. DLCs typically form columnar mesophases with varying symmetries of columnar arrangement. The phases are typically constituted of disc-shaped molecules that pi-stack into long-range molecular columns. In addition to the molecular shape, a balance of fluidity (alkyl chains) and rigidity (polyaromatic core) facilitates mesogenic properties. Many DLC molecules, including the prototypical triphenylene HATn, exhibit good hole transporting properties, with high, anisotropic mobilities. In this work, we exploit the hydrophobic nature and uniform film morphology of alkyloxy triphenylene DLC films to demonstrate the enhanced stability of RPP films in comparison with industry standard spiro-OMeTAD. Our results are significant as the vast library of homologous DLCs provide fertile ground for molecular engineering through alignment modulation. Increased stability combined with the highly tunable and preferential optoelectronic properties of RPP phases should stimulate work on next-generation DLC HTL-based perovskite devices.
