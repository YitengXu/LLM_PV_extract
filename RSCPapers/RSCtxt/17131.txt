    , Accepted 17th August 2016First published on 17th August 2016AbstractRational design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable non-noble metal electrocatalysts are critical for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with some renewable energy conversion systems. Herein, we report a one-step facile synthesis of ultrasmall tungsten phosphide nanoparticles (WP NPs) embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix (WP NPs@NC). The optimized catalyst, consisting of WP NPs of less than 5 nm diameter encapsulated by ultrathin carbon shells, shows excellent HER activity in strongly acidic media with a low onset overpotential (40 mV), high current density (j = 10 mA cm−2 at η = 102 mV), small Tafel slope (58 mV dec−1), and superior durability (4 days). The as-prepared WP NPs@NC catalyst also offers excellent HER activity in both neutral and alkaline conditions, as well as remarkable durability. This synthesis strategy opens up a new avenue for obtaining transition metal phosphide nanoparticles as a new class of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for water splitting and hydrogen generation.
1. Introduction
Widespread utilization of hydrogen has the potential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, as well as benefit the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.1–3 Recently, tremendous effort has been made to generate hydrogen from electrochemical or photoelectrochemical water splitting powered by renewable energy sources, including solar or wind energies. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a vital step in water splitting. An efficient HER catalyst is often required to generate large cathodic current densities at low overpotentials.4 To date, Pt is the most active and typical electrocatalyst for HER. However, it is neither abundant nor low in cost, which seriously hampers the development and widespread application of water electrolysis technology. In recent years, much attention has been paid to the search for low cost and earth-abundant 3d transition-metal based electrocatalysts such as Fe, Co and Ni-based materials.5–13 However, most of their electrocatalytic efficiency is intrinsically limited by low stability when used in catalysis or energy storage applications.14,15
Tungsten-based materials are an important family of catalysts. The combination of W with C, N, O, S and P can form active catalysts that are beneficial for fuel cells, methanol oxidation, hydrodesulfurization (HDS), solar cells and HER.16–23 In particular, in the HER field, tungsten phosphides (WP2 and WP) have emerged as the preferred electrocatalysts due to their high electrical conductivity.21,24 Only recently, WP2 or WP nanorods have been successfully synthesized via phosphorization of tungsten precursors under an in situ generated PH3 atmosphere. These catalysts showed high HER activity and stability.24,25 Unfortunately, the extremely toxic nature of PH3, which is lethal at a dose of only a few ppm, makes this synthetic strategy problematic.26 Amorphous WP NPs have also been used as an efficient HER catalyst. However, their preparation suffers from high decomposition temperature of the organic reagents, which results in a reaction mixture that is highly flammable and corrosive.27 Therefore, the need to develop a non-toxic and facile method for preparing nanostructure tungsten phosphide is urgent.
In general, using conductive carbon as protective layers for the catalyst has aroused considerable interests in energy storage and conversion28,29 owing to the following advantages: (1) electronic conduction of the catalyst is enhanced, (2) the dispersion of active phases is improved, thus offering more active sites, and (3) the corrosion resistance under both strongly acidic and basic conditions is boosted.14,15,30,31 On the other hand, heteroatom-doped carbon (N and P) could reduce ΔGH* values due to the promoted initial H* adsorption, which enhances HER activity versus that of pure carbon materials.32
In this study, for the first time, we report on the preparation of ultrasmall WP NPs (less than 5 nm in size) embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) matrix (WP NPs@NC) through a one-step facile solid-state reaction using sodium tungstate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and melamine as precursors. This catalyst shows high HER activity and durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. More importantly, WP NPs@NC also provides excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER under both neutral and alkaline conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this new WP NPs@NC catalyst is one of the most active tungsten phosphide-based catalysts towards HER.
2. Experimental
Materials
NH4H2PO4, K2HPO4, KH2PO4, and ethanol were purchased from Aladdin Reagent. H2SO4 and KOH were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. Na2WO4·2H2O and melamine were purchased from Xinglong Chemical Corp. Ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6W12O39·xH2O), Pt/C (20 wt%) and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the reagents used in the experiment were of analytical grade. Distilled water used throughout all the experiments was purified through a Millipore system. All the reagents were used as received without further treatments. De-ionized water (Mini-Q) was employed as solvent.
Preparation of WP NPs@NC and bulk WP
0.55 g Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.81 g NH4H2PO4 and 4.0 g melamine were combined and ground into a homogeneous powder. The solid mixture was then annealed at 800 °C for 120 min under inert atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the black products were collected and washed by centrifugation with deionized water several times to remove the residue of reactants, and finally, dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. WP NPs@NC was obtained as a black powder. The following comparative studies were performed: (1) two samples were synthesized by varying the molar ratio of the precursors, i.e. ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium tungstate, (2:1 and 8:1) at 800 °C and (2) two more samples with different thermolysis temperatures were prepared (700 and 900 °C) under the same precursor ratio (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate/sodium tungstate: 4:1). The samples prepared using 2:1 and 8:1 molar ratios were named C-800-2 and C-800-8, respectively. The samples prepared using different thermolysis temperatures were denoted as C-700-4 and C-900-4, respectively.
Preparation of bulk WP
Bulk WP was prepared by modification of a previously reported method. Briefly, (NH4)6W12O39·xH2O and NH4H2PO4 were ground to form a homogeneous powder. The powder was reduced in H2/Ar atmosphere (20 wt%) with a temperature ramp from room temperature to 800 °C for 120 min, and then naturally cooled to room temperature.
Preparation of N-doped carbon
1.0 g activated carbon and 4.0 g melamine were ground to form a homogeneous powder. The solid mixture was then annealed at 800 °C for 120 min under an inert atmosphere.
Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphology and structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, XL30 ESEM FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained on an ESCALABMK II X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) SSA was analyzed using a Quantachrome NOVA 1000 system at liquid N2 temperature. Raman shifts were recorded on aLabRAMAramis Raman spectrometer instrument using an Ar ion laser with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm.
Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed with a CHI 660E electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) in a standard three-electrode system. A graphite rod and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A glass carbon electrode (GCE:diameter = 3 mm) was used as the working electrode. 10 mg catalyst and 10 μl 5 wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in 990 μl ethanol/water (v/v = 1:1) solvent mixture by sonication for 30 min. Then, 14 μl of the catalyst ink was loaded on a GCE. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH = 0), 1.0 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.0) and 1.0 M KOH (pH = 14) with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 at 25 °C. In all the measurements, the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by adding a value of (0.197 + 0.059 pH) V. Onset overpotentials were determined based on the beginning of the linear regime in the Tafel plot and iR correction was applied for all the electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
The WP NPs@NC catalyst was synthesized via a one-step facile solid-state reaction under Ar gas flow at 800 °C using sodium tungstate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and melamine as precursors (see the Experimental section for preparation details). Fig. 1A and B show the TEM images of the obtained product, indicating that numerous small WP NPs with a uniform size of generally less than 5 nm (Fig. S1†) are uniformly distributed in the ultrathin carbon matrix. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1C) further reveal that WP NPs are embedded within carbon nanolayers. In addition, the observed lattice fringe of WP NPs is 0.29 nm, which can be ascribed to the (100) crystal plane of the orthorhombic WP.15 The scanning TEM (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images (Fig. 1D) further confirm the uniform distribution of W, P, N and C. All these results strongly support the successful preparation of WP NPs@NC materials via a facile solid-state reaction. In addition, all the test, including SEM, EDX spectrum and XRD, indicates that bulk WP can be obtained through molecular hydrogen (H2) reduction of the ammonium tungstate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate mixture (refer to Fig. S2†).

The XRD pattern of WP NPs@NC is shown in Fig. 2A, which is consistent with the reference XRD pattern of the orthorhombic WP phase (JCPDS No. 29-1364).33 Orthorhombic WP possesses a MnP-type structure (Fig. 2B). The XPS survey spectrum was obtained to investigate the composition information of WP NPs@NC and confirm the presence of W, P, C, N and O (Fig. S3†). The high resolution W 4f spectrum can be fitted into four peaks. The strong peaks at 33.6 and 31.5 eV are consistent with W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 of WP, whereas the weak peaks at 37.6 and 35.7 eV are associated with the W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 of WO3 due to strong surface oxidation in air (Fig. 2C).34 From the P 2p spectrum (Fig. 2D), two peaks at 130.0 and 129.3 eV correspond to binding energies for P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2. The relatively broader peak at 133.7 eV is assignable to P–O.35–37 The N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2E) shows the presence of pyridinic-N (398.2 eV), graphitic N (401.4 eV) and oxidized-N (403.0 eV).38 In the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2F), the main peak is located at 284.6 eV and is attributed to graphitic carbon, whereas the other two peaks at 285.9 and 289.3 eV are assigned to C–N and/or CN and O–CO, respectively.39,40 To further characterize the carbon component, the Raman spectrum of the samples was obtained (Fig. S4†). Two strong peaks at ∼1350 and 1590 cm−1 are observed, which correspond to the D- and G-bands of carbon materials. The intensity ratio of D- to G-bands (ID/IG) is about 1.05, which suggests that many defects are present in the carbon component for WP NPs@NC.41 Moreover, the amount of N-doped carbon in the WP NPs@NC was determined to be about 19.6 wt% by carbon elemental (CHNS) analysis.

The as-prepared WP NPs@NC was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for HER in a H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three electrode system. In addition, bare GCE, N-doped carbon, bulk WP and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (Johnson Matthey) were also tested as references. For all the samples, the same loading (2.0 mg cm−2) on a GCE was used to make our comparative studies easier. As shown in Fig. 3A, WP NPs@NC shows the best HER activity among the compared samples. From the low current density region of the Tafel plots wherein the current response deviates from the linear region (Fig. S5A†), the onset overpotential of WP NPs@NC is ∼40 mV. In addition, to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the current density expected for a 12.3% efficient solar water-splitting device, N-doped carbon and bulk WP require overpotentials (η) of 501 and 306 mV, respectively, whereas WP NPs@NC requires a smaller overpotential of 102 mV. Such an overpotential is only 68 mV higher than the value of commercial Pt/C (34 mV). Notably, bulk WP shows very low HER activity. These results demonstrate the dramatic effects of N-doped carbon layers on enhancing the performance of WP. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic performance of WP NPs@NC is superior to the best reported tungsten phosphide-based HER electrocatalysts so far (Table S1†) and is considered good among the non-precious metal electrocatalysts (Table S2†).

(C) Polarization curves for WP NPs@NC initial and after 6000 CV scanning between +0.28 and −0.27 V vs. RHE. (D) Time-dependent current density curve for WP NPs@NC under static overpotential of 80 mV for 96 h. 
In addition, the HER mechanism of WP NPs@NC was studied using the corresponding Tafel plots. Typically, three possible elementary reaction steps are assumed to predominate the HER in acidic media, commonly named the Volmer (eqn (1)), Heyrovsky (eqn (2)) and Tafel reactions (eqn (3)).42 H3O+ + e− → Hads + H2O(1) Hads + H3O+ + e− → H2 + H2O(2) Hads + Hads → H2(3)
As shown in Fig. 3B, the slope of the Tafel plot is 30 mV dec−1 for commercial Pt/C. In contrast, Tafel slopes for WP NPs@NC and bulk WP are calculated to be 58 and 78 mV dec−1, respectively, suggesting that hydrogen evolution could be based on the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.43,44 Furthermore, the exchange current density (j0) value of WP NPs@NC is 0.25 mA cm−2, calculated by extrapolating the Tafel plot (Fig. S5B†). This value compares favorably to the behaviors of most reported non-precious metal HER electrocatalysts (Tables S1 and S2†).
Stability is another significant factor in evaluating an HER catalyst. Fig. 3C illuminates the polarization curves of WP NPs@NC before and after 3000 and 6000 cyclic voltammetric (CV) cycles between +0.28 and −0.27 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. As seen, even through 6000 cycles, the polarization curve exhibits only a slight current density loss. Moreover, an i–t curve during HER for the long reaction time was recorded. Fig. 3D shows that the HER activity of WP NPs@NC remains nearly unchanged after electrolysis for more than 96 h in 0.5 M H2SO4 at an applied overpotential of 80 mV. These results demonstrate that the as-synthesised WP NPs@NC are highly efficient and stable catalysts for HER.
It is worth noting that numerous microbial and strongly alkaline electrolysis cells need active and stable catalysts in neutral and basic media.45,46 As such, we further investigated the HER activity of WP NPs@NC in neutral and alkaline solutions (1.0 M PBS, pH = 7 and 1.0 M KOH, pH = 14), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4A and C, WP NPs@NC exhibits excellent HER catalytic activity in both 1.0 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH solutions, affording a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials of 196 and 150 mV, respectively. In addition, WP NPs@NC also shows good stability in both solutions (Fig. 4B and D). It is important to mention that the WP NPs@NC catalyst has activity comparable to most of the reported non-precious metal HER electrocatalysts in neutral or basic conditions, as shown in Tables S3 and S4.† Overall observations clearly confirm that WP NPs@NC is a highly active HER electrocatalyst over the entire pH range (pH 0–14).

Four additional samples were synthesized by varying the molar ratio of the precursors ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium tungstate (2:1 and 8:1) and the thermolysis temperature (700 and 900 °C). Note that these samples were named C-800-2, C-800-8, C-700-4 and C-900-4. XRD patterns, XPS spectra and Raman analysis indicate the successful formation of WP and N-doped carbon hybrid structures and are shown in Fig. S6–S10.† The WP NPs@NC sample discussed above was made from a 4:1 molar ratio of precursors at 800 °C and is denoted in this section as C-800-4. The HER catalytic activity of these samples was investigated. Fig. 5A shows the polarization curves. The catalytic performance increases in the order of C-800-8 < C-900-4 < C-700-4 < C-800-2 < C-800-4. The increased activity could be attributed to the larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). One approach to estimate ECSA is to measure the double layer capacitance (Cdl).47,48 The measured Cdl is 87.7, 51.6, 33.1, 32.2 and 28.0 mF cm−2 for C-800-4, C-800-2, C-700-4, C-900-4 and C-800-8 (Fig. 5B and S11†), respectively, indicating that ECSA decreases in the same order. As shown in Fig. 5C, the BET specific surface area also decreases in order of C-800-4 (70.95 m2 g−1) > C-800-2 (28.82 m2 g−1) > C-700-4 (28.79 m2 g−1) > C-900-4 (21.11 m2 g−1) > C-800-8 (18.60 m2 g−1). This mirrors the relationship between ECSA of the samples and their catalytic performance. The high catalytic activity and stability of WP NPs@NC in HER at all pH values could be ascribed to the following factors: (1) The small size WP NPs uniformly distributed on highly conductive N-doped carbon layers enable the full utilization of the active sites of the catalysts. (2) The ultrathin N-doped carbon shells can facilitate the electron transfer from the WP NPs core to the NC surface during the electrochemical reactions.49,50 Indeed, the EIS analysis confirms that WP NPs@NC has much lower impedance and thus exhibits markedly faster HER kinetics than bulk WP,51 as shown in Fig. S12.† (3) The larger ECSA and BET surface areas could provide more catalytic sites, thus resulting in the higher HER performance. (4) Synergistic effects between WP NPs and NC might further enhance the HER catalytic acticivy.52 (5) The unique nanostructure of WP NPs embedded within N-doped carbon shells not only avoids aggregation, but also guarantees strong cyclic stability of the electrocatalyst during long-term operation.

In conclusion, we prepared ultrasmall WP NPs embedded within the N-doped carbon matrix (WP NPs@NC) through a one-step facile solid-state reaction. WP NPs@NC functions as an efficient HER electrocatalyst driving large cathodic current at low overpotential with robust durability and applicability under a wide range of pH conditions. The remarkable HER catalytic activity could be attributed to synergistic/cooperative effects of WP NPs and N-doped carbon layers. The facile and scale-up synthesis method might allow low-cost preparation of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen-doped carbon, thus making these materials attractive options for various electrocatalytic applications.
