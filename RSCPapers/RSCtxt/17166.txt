    , Accepted 1st June 2015First published on 8th June 2015AbstractA new two-dimensional (2D) conjugated small molecule, namely DCA3TBDTP, with an alkoxyphenyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit as the central core, octyl cyanoacetate as the end-capped groups and terthiophene as the π-linked bridge, was designed and synthesized for solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) as an electron donor material, in which an alkoxyphenyl group was introduced as a weak electron-donating side chain of the BDT moiety. The DCA3TBDTP molecule exhibited good solubility, a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.25 eV), an appropriate optical band-gap (1.82 eV) and a high decomposition temperature (362 °C). By applying the simple solution spin-coating fabrication process, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs based on DCA3TBDTP and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) exhibited a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.51% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V when thermal annealing at only 70 °C.
Introduction
As described in a report from Chen et al. in 2011,1 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT, as the core) based acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSC) reached their power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.44%, which was mainly attributed to BDT's large and rigid planar structure as a structural analogue of the electron-rich anthracene moiety with enhanced electron delocalization and promoted cofacial π–π stacking in the solid state, thus being favored for charge transport in OSC devices.2–5 This had made it a very good electron-donating unit in high-performance conjugated donor materials in SMOSCs with their promisingly comparable PCEs (exceeding 9%) to their polymer counterparts,6–8 possessing great advantages of relatively simple synthesis and purification and well-defined structures thus, less batch-to-batch variation, possible versatile structural design thus, easier control of energy levels, and high charge carrier mobilities.9,10 Since then, significant progress on such BDT based SMOSCs has been achieved by incorporating a series of dye building blocks as various acceptor motifs such as 3-ethulrodanine,11 indenedione (1,3-indandione),12 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid,9 and DPP,13 as well as by symmetrical π-conjugated substitutions on the phenyl unit of BDT with alkylthienyl,14 alkylphenyl,15 alkylsilylethynyl16 and alkylselenophene17 groups. Such π-conjugated substituents in the orthogonal direction of BDT result in 2-dimensional (2D) expanded delocalization of π-electrons to the conjugated side groups thus, better interchain π–π stacking, which could benefit the exciton diffusion and charge transport (in comparison to 1D BDT units substituted with non-conjugated side groups like dialkoxy11 or dialkylthiol6 substituents), therefore allowing improved broad light absorbance and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels which could contribute to a relatively high open-circuit voltage (Voc) (ca. 0.90–1.0 V) and high efficiency (PCE > 7%).6,18
State-of-the-art methods involving altering the side chain structures on the BDT moiety have presented the great ability to fine tune electronic properties such as energy levels, bandgap, and charge carrier mobility, etc.6,18 Among the vast variety of developed BDT-based electron-donating derivatives, systematic investigations on 1D alkyl-, alkoxy-, and alkylthiol-BDT based SMOSCs have been carried out by Chen et al. in a series of papers: the choice of the weaker electron-donating ability of alkylthiol- than alkoxy-BDT based SMOSCs with a Voc of 0.91 V;6 the replacement of a strong electron donating 2-ethylhexyloxy side chain on the BDT unit with a less electron-donating octyl side chain resulting in an even lower HOMO energy level (−5.02 eV) and thus a much higher Voc (0.98 V).19 However, for 2D π-conjugated units attached to BDT in SMOSCs, only strong electron donors like alkylthiophene, alkylbenzene, alkylselenophene, and alkylsilylethyne14–17 have been reported. In order to systematically engineer such side chain dependency, the promising, less strong alkoxylphenyl substituents ought to be taken into consideration for the molecular design. An alkoxyphenyl side group has been recently been used in 2D BDT based polymers by both Zou's group, with PBDTPO-DTBO,20 and our group, with PBDTPF-DTBT21 (with fluorinated alkoxyphenyl side chain), which demonstrated high PCEs of 6.2% and 7.02%, and mobilities of up to 0.22 and 0.034 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. Meanwhile, we designed and synthesized a new small molecule, BDT–PO–DPP, by replacing the alkoxyl groups in the BDT unit with alkoxyphenyl ones for extended conjugation along the side chain directions; this gave a PCE of 5.63% after thermal annealing at 110 °C.22 In order to systematically explore the molecular structure dependency on electronic properties like energy level and charge mobility, further design of more SMOSCs based on alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT would be fundamentally essential. On the other hand, being one of the widely used end-capped blocks for building high-performance SMOSCs due to its simple conjugated structure and strong electron-withdrawing ability, octyl cyanoacetate could not only effectively regulate the energy levels of the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), but also greatly improve the solubility of the targeted small molecules.1,9,11–13,18
Considering the above discussion, in this work, for the side-chain engineering of BDT based high PCE SMOSCs, we introduced the weak electron-donating group para-alkoxyphenyl as an aromatic substituent on BDT to obtain a new 2D conjugated small molecule DCA3TBDTP (Scheme 1). This compound consists of three segments: octyl cyanoacetate as the end-capped groups, terthiophene as the π-linked bridge and alkoxyphenyl substituted BDT as the central core. The molecule DCA3TBDTP exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents and good thermal stability, and the DCA3TBDTP–PC61BM blend film showed a hole mobility of up to 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, which was measured via the space-charge limit current (SCLC) model. BHJ-OSCs fabricated with DCA3TBDTP as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor showed a good PCE of 4.51% with a high open-circuit voltage of 0.90 V after thermal annealing at a low temperature (70 °C).

Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were freshly distilled in the presence of sodium and benzophenone under a nitrogen atmosphere prior to use. 5′′-Bromo-4′,4′′-dioctyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-trithiophene-5-carbaldehyde (6) was synthesized as reported in the literature.23
Instruments and measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded under the APCI mode on a Bruker Maxis UHRTOF spectrometer. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on an STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out on a Perkin Elmer diamond differential scanning calorimeter. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and a platinum wire counter electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. The surface roughness and morphology of the thin films of the active layers were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400 working at the tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance.
Fabrication and characterization of the organic solar cells
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with the device geometry of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3TBDTP:PC61BM/Ca(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The ITO glass substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, toluene, methanol and isopropyl alcohol, sequentially. Then, oxygen plasma treatment was carried out for 20 min, then the substrates were spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm, and dried under an argon atmosphere for 30 min at 160 °C. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of the DCA3TBDTP and PC61BM with a weight ratio of 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1 in deoxygenated anhydrous chloroform on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate in a glove box. The thickness of the active layer films was measured by a Dektak 150 profilometer was determined to be around 100 nm. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were thermally evaporated and deposited on the top of the active layer in a defined area of 0.1 cm2 at a vacuum pressure of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2420 source measurement under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) from a Newport solar simulator. A standard silicon solar cell was used to calibrate the light intensity. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the OSCs were measured using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The detailed synthetic route of the small molecule DCA3TBDTP is outlined in Scheme 2. Compound 5 and 6 were synthesized according to reported procedures.20,23 The important precursor 7 containing two aldehyde groups was synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction between compound 5 and 6. The target small molecule DCA3TBDTP was obtained by means of a Knoevenagel condensation between octyl cyanoacetate and the corresponding aldehyde, compound 7. The purity of the targeted compound for device fabrication was guaranteed by multiple column chromatographic purification and recrystallization in a mixing solvent of methanol–chloroform. The targeted compound was fully characterized using HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR (Fig. S3, ESI†). DCA3TBDTP shows good solubility in common organic solvents, which is a prerequisite for solution-processed SMOSCs.
Thermal stability
The thermal property of DCA3TBDTP was investigated through TGA and DSC. As shown in Fig. 1, DCA3TBDTP exhibited a good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) at 362 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere, evidencing sufficient thermal stability for its device application. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the first thermal heating scan (heat 1 curve) was applied in order to undo the thermal/solvent induced crystallization of the sample. Thermodynamic phase transition temperatures including the melting point and crystallization temperature were adopted from the second heating scan and cooling of the thermogram (heat 2 and cooling curve). Distinct melting peaks from both solvent induced (heat 1) and thermally crystallized (heat 2) samples reveal the formation of the crystal structure and therefore indicate the strong intermolecular interactions among the small molecules via π–π stacking within the aromatic moieties and hydrophobic interactions within the alkyl side chains. It is found that the main melting endotherm of DCA3TBDTP occurred at 192.84 °C and the corresponding melting enthalpy (ΔHm) calculated from the integrated area of the melting peak was 39.96 J g−1. During the cooling process, DCA3TBDTP showed a crystallization ΔHm of 23.75 J g−1 at 180.87 °C, proving that the small molecule has an obvious tendency to crystallize,24 while the larger enthalpy value of the solvent induced crystallization (ΔHm of 44.80 J g−1) indicates a higher degree of crystallinity than that of the materials crystallized via cooling, possibly indicating good phase separation between the donor DCA3TBDTP and the acceptor PC61BM caused by solvent evaporation during spin-coating of the active layer materials.

Optical properties

Fig. 2 explored the normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption of DCA3TBDTP in a dilute chloroform solution (5 × 10−6 mol L−1) and in the thin film. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of DCA3TBDTP in solution exhibited an absorption peak at 500 nm with a maximum molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of 8.68 × 104 L (mol cm)−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†), arising from intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor moieties. The shoulder peak ranging from 350–450 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated units. The DCA3TBDTP thin film showed broader absorption across the visible region (300–700 nm) due to more effective electron push–pull effects and extended π–π packing of the molecular backbones in the solid state. Compared with that in solution, the thin film absorption peak displayed a bathochromic shift of about 73 nm, indicating the strong intermolecular π–π interaction and aggregation in the solid state due to improved planar construction of the 2D side chains. The optical band gap (ΔEoptg) of DCA3TBDTP is estimated to be 1.82 eV derived from the absorption onset of the thin film (683 nm). In terms of OSC design, such a low band gap of DCA3TBDTP will lead to a higher photocurrent, making this molecule more useful for OSC applications.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of DCA3TBDTP were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). A solution of tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte and the potential scan rate was 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3a, DCA3TBDTP displayed one reversible oxidation wave. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is 0.39 V vs. SCE. The HOMO energy level of the target molecule was determined by the empirical formula of EHOMO = −e(EOx + 4.8 − E+1/2,(Fc/Fc)). The onset oxidation potential of DCA3TBDTP is 0.84 V, thus the corresponding HOMO energy level is −5.25 eV. Additionally, the LUMO energy level of DCA3TBDTP, calculated from the HOMO and optical band gap, is −3.43 eV.

The energy level diagrams of DCA3TBDTP and other materials used in the solution-processed BHJ SMOSCs are shown in Fig. 3b. The LUMO energy level offset (ΔELUMO) and HOMO energy level offset (ΔEHOMO) of DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM are 0.48 eV and 0.68 eV, respectively. The relatively unmatched ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO values could lead to an unbalanced charge dissociation,25 which is not conducive to the improvement of Jsc.
Geometry and electronic structure
Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the electronic structure of the molecule DCA3TBDTP with the B3LYP method at the 6-31G(d) basis set level in the gas phase (Fig. 4), and the DFT calculation was performed by the Gaussian 09 program.26–29 All the alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to reduce the computational cost. The optimized molecular structure was confirmed to be in a stable local minimum of the ground state potential energy surface since there is no imaginary frequency by vibrational calculation at the same level of theory. The DFT-derived HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecule DCA3TBDTP were −5.10 eV and −2.91 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, DCA3TBDTP presented good planarity in the molecular backbone direction. However, the pendant benzene rings on the benzodithiophene of DCA3TBDTP exhibited a torsion angle of about 59.1° because of the space steric effect, leading to a relatively poor planarity in the side chain direction.22

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3TBDTP:PC61BM/Ca/Al, and tested under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Firstly, the blends of DCA3TBDTP and PC61BM at different weight ratios were used to optimize the device performance. The detailed device parameters were summarized in Table 1. With an increase in the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM blend ratio from 1:1 to 3:1, Voc had no obvious change. However, the short circuit current density (Jsc) firstly increased from 5.40 mA cm−2 to 6.95 mA cm−2 and then decreased to 6.22 mA cm−2. Compared with the Voc and Jsc, the fill factor (FF) gradually increased. As is known to all, thermal annealing of the blend film could generally enhance the photovoltaic performance due to the improved morphology of the active layer. Therefore, thermal annealing in the range of 50–90 °C was also employed to further optimize the device performance. With increasing the annealing temperature, the values of Jsc and FF increased significantly compared to the pristine ones. Interestingly, the Voc of the BHJ solar cells remained almost constant before and after thermal annealing, as high as ∼0.90 V, which is similar with that of other reported BDT-based SMOSCs and is believed to be related to the deep HOMO (−5.25 eV) energy level of the molecule, DCA3TBDTP (Fig. 3b).6,11,23 The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices before and after thermal annealing at 70 °C are shown in Fig. 5a. Finally, a PCE of 4.51% for the DCA3TBDTP-based small molecule OSC was obtained with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 7.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.66%, when the device was fabricated with a donor–acceptor weight ratio of 2:1 after thermal annealing at 70 °C.

To further understand the photo-to-electron conversion efficiencies of the DCA3TBDTP-based solar cells in the UV-vis region, the EQE curves of the optimized BHJ devices based on DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM (w:w, 2:1) are presented in Fig. 5b. The EQE curves show a broad response covering 300–700 nm, consistent with the absorption spectrum. It is worth pointing out that thermal annealing improved the photo-response of the active layer over the whole range, leading to an increased Jsc. The Jsc values (6.92 mA cm−2 and 7.86 mA cm−2) were calculated from integration of the EQE curves, which were consistent with the Jsc values (6.95 mA cm−2 and 7.88 mA cm−2) obtained from the J–V measurements before and after thermal annealing at 70 °C for the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM (w:w, 2:1) devices.
Morphology and structural (X-ray) characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to study the morphologies and phase separations of the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM (w:w, 2:1) blend films before and after thermal annealing at 70 °C. The active layer was spin-coated from a CHCl3 solution on a glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate for the AFM measurements. The corresponding topography and phase images are shown in Fig. 6 (a, b – pristine films and d, e – thermal annealing films). Both blend films before and after thermal annealing exhibited a uniform and smooth surface, ensuring a better contact with the Ca/Al electrode and being beneficial for the increase in the charge collection efficiency. The root mean square (RMS) roughness is ca. 1.48 nm and 1.04 nm for the pristine film and thermally annealed blend film, respectively. The decreased RMS suggested that the quality of the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM blend film could be improved by thermal annealing. As shown in the TEM images (Fig. 6c and f), the thermally annealed blend film exhibits a better interpenetrating network containing a slightly larger nanoscale phase separation in the active layer. After annealing at 70 °C, the domain boundary intensity obviously reduced, which would decrease the trap state density existing in the boundary. Therefore, the transport and collection of the carrier charge was improved and the recombination current was also reduced. This is probably an important reason for the enhancement of Jsc and FF after thermal annealing in this work.23,30–33

To further understand the relationship between the photovoltaic performance and the annealing temperature, the crystallinity of the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM blend film before and after thermal annealing at 70 °C was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 7, the first-order diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.97° corresponding to the (100) lattice plane of DCA3TBDTP with a d100-spacing value of 22.2 Å and the second-order diffraction peak (200) at 2θ = 7.94° were also clearly observed. The d100-spacing is the distance between the main conjugated chains of the small molecules, separated by their side chains. The high intensity (100) diffraction peaks are due to the presence of many alkyl side chains around the main chain, which were featured by the solution-processed small molecules as reported.1,18 Therefore the presence of these diffraction peaks indicated that the blend film exhibited an obvious ordered arrangement before and after thermal annealing. However, compared with the pristine film, the intensity of the diffraction peak of the annealed film was significantly enhanced and the half-band width was also narrowed, indicating that the ordered arrangement and degree of crystallinity was further improved in the active layer after thermal annealing.23,32 This is also in good agreement with the DSC results formerly discussed. The enhanced crystallinity associated with the stronger π–π stacking ability after thermal annealing could improve the carrier mobility which is beneficial to the carrier transport and collection, resulting in an improved Jsc and FF.31,32,34

Hole mobility
The hole mobility of the DCA3TBDTP/PC61BM blend film before and after thermal annealing at 70 °C was explored by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model35 using a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCA3TBDTP:PC61BM (2:1, 100 nm)/Au (Fig. 8). The calculated hole mobility values of the blend films were 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 and 2.74 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 before and after thermal annealing, respectively. The results indicated that thermal annealing contributes to the improvement of the hole mobility, which was another important factor for the enhanced device performance after thermal annealing at a relatively low temperature.

Conclusion
A new small molecule DCA3TBDTP based on alkoxyphenyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, terthiophene and octyl cyanoacetate was designed and synthesized by Stille coupling and Knoevenagel reactions. The small molecule exhibited good thermal stability, solubility and a deep HOMO energy level. As a weak electron donor, the alkoxylphenyl group as a conjugated side chain was introduced into the molecular backbone without having an obvious influence on the optical band gap and crystallinity. Solution-processed organic solar cells based on DCA3TBDTP and PC61BM exhibited a PCE of 4.51% with a high Voc of 0.90 V after thermal annealing at only 70 °C. The encouraging results reveal that the alkoxyphenyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivative is a prospective two-dimensional heterocyclic core in constructing donor–acceptor type small molecules for high-efficiency solution-processed organic solar cells.
