Moreover, ultra-thin perovskite films prepared to achieve semi-transparency compromise the quality of films and damage much of the photovoltaic performance. Herein, a straightforward crystallization strategy is developed for fabricating MAPb(IxBr1−x)3 perovskite films. High-quality ultra-thin films are achieved through controlled nucleation and growth of introducing methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) components in the form of a precursor solution as a whole, which can change the variety of colloids serving as nucleation sites during crystallization, simultaneously improving the crystallinity of films and reducing the loss of photovoltaic performance caused by defects. Thus, an ST-PSC with efficiency exceeding 18% was obtained, and the average visible transmittance (AVT) of the perovskite film reached 26.23% by introducing 4% MAPbBr3. This work demonstrates a simple and convenient method to prepare high-quality perovskite films and reveals the intrinsic reasons for improving the crystallinity of perovskite films, which paves the way for the evolution of high-performance tandem cells using efficient ST-PSCs as top cells or integrating them with buildings.
Introduction
Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) have received considerable attention recently as emerging solar cells with great commercial application prospects. ST-PSCs can function as glass walls for buildings and cars,1,2 which require both characteristics of light-harvesting and power generation, i.e., obtaining visible transparency and harnessing solar energy. Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can obviously reduce building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by generating electricity without relying on the grid.3 Furthermore, ST-PSCs integrated into the side of buildings can maximize space utilization to obtain solar energy compared to conventional PSCs that require additional installation space.4 In addition, ST-PSCs can also form tandem solar cells with silicon solar cells accounting for a large percentage of the photovoltaic market to maximize the overall efficiency of the device.5–7 MAPbI3 is the most representative and commonly used material as the light-absorbing layer in ST-PSCs because of its suitable optical bandgap and the appearance of the semi-transparent film. However, directly using MAPbI3 as the active layer of the cells brings some inevitable drawbacks: (i) poor film quality such as pinholes and low coverage, (ii) reduced short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) due to the extremely thin perovskite film, and (iii) the transmittance of the device cannot meet the requirements of commercial applications. In this regard, researchers have proposed many innovative optimization methods. For example, tuning the bandgap of perovskite films by changing the composition,8 passivating defects at the interface to improve FF,9–11 and surface modification to improve carrier extraction and transport.12,13 Obtaining thin perovskite films by reducing the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution to achieve semi-transparency could become an impressive technique.14 However, at the same time, the most obvious problem accompanying the reduction of film thickness is non-uniformity and pinholes.
To address these issues, Bag et al.15 used thiourea vapor for surface passivation treatment of PEDOT:PSS films at different lengths of time and fabricated perovskite films by a two-step deposition process. Since the PEDOT:PSS film is passivated by chalcogenide species, the interaction between Pb and I is improved; thus, the surface coverage of the perovskite film on top of it is superior. A uniform, pinhole-free 110 nm perovskite film was finally formed with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.2% and AVT of 34% for the corresponding inverted planar device. Although interfacial passivation can improve the coverage of perovskite films, it increases the complexity of the preparation and makes an inconspicuous contribution to increasing the transmittance. Besides, the bandgap of perovskite can be effortlessly tuned by changing the composition as the radius of the halide (iodine, bromine, and chlorine) decreases, enabling more visible light to pass through the perovskite film.16 In reference to the adjustable bandgap, superior light transmission, and improved thermal and moisture stability, dual halide perovskite has been widely used.17,18 The wide-bandgap MAPbI3−xBrx (0 < x < 3) perovskite material has been demonstrated to be a good candidate for ST-PSCs.19,20 Therefore, the ratio of bromide to iodide in the perovskite can be modified to change the transparency. Li et al.21 systematically studied the composition and thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx (0 < x < 3) perovskite films. If the thickness of the film is constant, the bandgap extends with the increase of the bromide ratio, and the AVT of the film increases accordingly, varying from 10% AVT at x = 0 to 24% AVT at x = 1.5 (film thickness of 300 nm). On the other hand, the substitution of large amounts of Br for I will lead to halide segregation, which in turn will have a negative impact on device performance.22 Therefore, adjusting and optimizing the content of the Br component not only finds a suitable bandgap for ST-PSC, but also maximizes the grain size and crystallinity of the film, thereby enhancing the photovoltaic performance, ultimately maintaining acceptable AVT while concomitantly achieving relatively high PCE.
Here, we report a straightforward crystallization strategy that does not require changes in device architecture to prepare high-quality films for the fabrication of ST-PSCs. The key point to obtain films with favorable crystallinity is to modify the nucleation via introducing MAPbBr3 as a whole into MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution. The addition of MAPbBr3 was able to increase the variety of colloidal species acting as nucleation sites in the precursor solution. At the same time, improved grain size and crystallinity of the films can significantly reduce grain boundaries and further reduce the harmful defects in the film. The resulting perovskite films contributed to high-performance ST-PSC with an increase in FF from about 70% to 75%, achieving PCE of 18.27% and AVT of 26.23% for the film.
Results and discussion
Different colloids existing in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 precursor solutions are made of soft coordination complexes in the form of a lead polyhalide framework between organic and inorganic components.23 Based on coordination chemistry, coordination complexes can be made of a variety of lead polyiodides, such as [PbX3]1−, [PbX4]2−, [PbX5]3−, and [PbX6]4−. Obviously, [PbX6]4− is the full coordination compound with a more stable free octahedral structure. Therefore, we assume that this colloidal structure occupies the primary component in the precursor. Compared to the direct preparation of MAPbIxBr3−x, when introducing MAPbBr3 into MAPbI3, a portion of [PbI6]4− and [PbBr6]4− will re-coordinate; consequently, the mixed precursor contains different sizes of colloids: [PbI6]4−, [PbBr6]4− and [PbIxBr6−x]4− (Fig. 1a). These colloids serve as nucleation sites during the crystallization which can influence the size of perovskite crystal. Only one kind of colloid is present in the precursor solution, and the perovskite crystals tend to grow into small and dense grains (Fig. 1b). However, adding MAPbBr3 will form different kinds of nucleation sites, which will significantly change the grain size (Fig. 1c). In polycrystalline films, the size of the grains is determined by the crystallization rate of crystals, which is governed by the competition between nucleation rate and growth rate of crystals.24 As a rule, the Ostwald ripening process involves two coupled steps: the first step is the dissolution of small-sized crystals because of their higher surface energy, whereas the second step is the growth of large-sized crystals with lower surface energy.25 In other words, the Ostwald ripening process results from the suppression of the nucleation of crystals (corresponding to the first step) and facilitation of the growth of crystals (corresponding to the second step) during the film-forming process. The enlarged grains will reduce defects caused by the presence of grain boundaries. Crystal defects known as charge recombination centers can adversely affect the photovoltaic performance of corresponding devices. Generally, the introduction of MAPbBr3 not only improves the crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite film but also further reduces the undesired defects in the film.

(b) MAPbI3 crystal nucleation and growth process; (c) MAPbI3 + MAPbBr3 crystal undergoes Ostwald ripening during the crystallization. 
To confirm the existence of colloids in the perovskite precursor solution, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy was further used to detect structural information on the precursor solutions. The difference in absorption between the colloids and their corresponding films was first compared. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, there is a significant blue shift in the absorption of colloid compared to film, which can be easily explained as the size reduction or partial dissolution effect in the solution. More interestingly, the perovskite colloidal precursor has a significant red-shifted plateau absorption edge (438 nm) compared to the pure PbI2 colloid (410 nm), suggesting that the perovskite precursor solution consists not only of PbI2 and MAI dissolved in DMSO/DMF mixed solvent, but also primarily a series of a new coordination compound. Furthermore, different from films, the colloidal compound exhibits a representative absorption plateau over a broad spectral range, which is probably caused by coordination equilibrium between colloids at various levels of coordination. Namely, the absorption characteristics of a series of compounds with different coordination states, as described above, will overlap as absorption plateaus in the coordination system. The same phenomenon can be observed in MAPbBr3 precursor solution as well (Fig. S1†). For an explanation of the alteration in colloid size distribution after adding MAPbBr3, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was further employed to verify the colloid size distribution of the dispersion in the precursor solutions. The MAPbI3 precursor has a nucleation size of 478.9 nm, whereas the MAPbBr3-containing precursor obtains as large as 646.7 nm, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. It is revealed that the larger colloid size and fewer nucleation sites result in the formation of larger crystal grains.26

To investigate the effect of MAPbBr3 content on the phase and crystallinity of MAPbI3 perovskite, films based on MAPbI3 + x% MAPbBr3 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). To make a parallel comparison, the preparation conditions were kept the same for all films. The diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.8° can be assigned to (110), (220), and (310) planes of α-MAPbI3, respectively (Fig. 2d).17 The diffraction peaks corresponding to the black phase of perovskite dramatically enhanced when the MAPbBr3 content was raised, proving that the addition of MAPbBr3 is beneficial to improve the crystallinity of MAPbI3. MAPbI3 has a distorted three-dimensional perovskite structure that crystallizes in the tetragonal I4/mcm space group, and in contrast, MAPbBr3 has a cubic perovskite structure phase of the Pmm space group at room temperature (Fig. S2†).27 The structural difference between the two perovskites seems to originate from the differences in the ionic radius of I− and Br− ions with 6-fold coordination, which are 2.20 and 1.96 Å, respectively. The ionic radii relationship of A, B, and X in ABX3 perovskite structure has been widely accepted as a criterion for the distortion of the BX6 octahedron; that is, the formation or stability of cubic perovskite structure and the smaller X ion radius is relatively profitable for the formation of cubic structure.28 The gradual shift of the (110) peak to a higher 2θ angle can be attributed to the transformation of the crystal structure from tetragonal to pseudo-cubic phases (Fig. 2e). We then calculated the crystal plane spacing according to the Bragg's equation:2dsinθ = nλwhere d is the crystal lattice planar spacing, θ is the angle of incidence, λ is the X-ray incident wavelength, and n is the diffraction level (n = 1). Assuming a cubic structure of perovskite, the lattice constant of (110) plane was simultaneously calculated (Fig. 2f). In addition, we further plotted the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak from the XRD patterns, as presented in Fig. 2f. According to Scherrer's equation:  where D is the average thickness of the grain perpendicular to the direction of the crystal plane, K is Scherrer constant, λ is the X-ray incident wavelength, B is FWHM, and θ is the angle of incidence. The lower FWHM value reveals the larger grain size, which brings a lower density of grain boundaries and improves charge transport and collection in the perovskite films.29 The related results are summarized in Table S1.† To confirm the modification of grain size by MAPbBr3, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to probe the morphology of the film. The top-view SEM images display the enlarged and more homogeneous grains with the rising MAPbBr3 content (Fig. S3†), corresponding to the calculated FWHM values. Such growth behaviour can be explained by the fact that the introduction of MAPbBr3 raises the variety of colloids that act as nucleation sites in the precursor solution. During the growth of MAPbBr3-containing perovskite crystals, small crystallites suffer re-dissolution and deposit onto intermediate-sized crystallites to form large grains, as mentioned above, for Ostwald ripening. Moreover, detailed energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was conducted for the element mapping investigation (Fig. S4†). The EDS mapping of the Br component describes the introduction of MAPbBr3 was uniformly distributed in the lattice dominated by MAPbI3.
The optical properties of MAPbI3 + x% MAPbBr3 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) films were further characterized by UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a). The absorption edges were located in the range from 757 to 775 nm, and the boost MAPbBr3 content caused a distinct blue shift of the absorption edge, suggesting that the perovskite films possessed a wider bandgap with greater transparency, therefore allowing more light to pass through the film. The Eg obtained by Tauc plot fitting from UV-vis spectra were 1.601, 1.609, 1.619, 1.627, and 1.637 eV, respectively (Fig. 3b). The transmittance spectra of films spin-coated on glass are shown in Fig. 3c. The trends are almost identical for all compositions in the 400–730 nm range but exhibit a gradual expansion in the 730–800 nm range at the same thickness (200 nm). This is owing to the substitution of larger ions I− with smaller Br− and thus widens the bandgap to some extent, resulting in a portion of electrons that are insufficiently excited by photons to leap from the valence band to the conduction band. The AVT calculated from the simple arithmetic mean of the transmittances in the range of 400–800 nm is 25.53–27.93% for comparable thickness (Table S2†). Herein, we obtained mirror-like and semi-transparent perovskite films from macroscopic views (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, valuable information related to the defects within perovskite crystals could be obtained by fitting the exponential drop in absorption at the band edge (also named as Urbach tail).30,31 According to the Urbach rule, we can extract the energetic disorder parameter, known as Urbach energy (Eu), from the law:  where α is the absorption coefficient, α0 is a constant, h is Planck's constant, and ν is optical frequency. The linear relationship of Urbach tail between lnα and excitation energy can be derived, and the inverse of the slope is Eu. Urbach energy arises through defects and structural disorder in the crystalline structure and thermal fluctuation of constituent atoms or ions.32,33 Defects of the crystalline structure in perovskite film are related to the values of Eu.34 The larger the energy, the larger the density of crystal defects.27,31 Even though the UV-vis absorption is not sensitive enough to accurately measure the Urbach energy, the relative tendency of Urbach energy can be obtained as seen in Fig. 3e.35 Comparing the slopes, we considered a lower energetic disorder and fewer defects associated with the MAPbBr3-containing films.

To probe the trap states of MAPbI3 + x% MAPbBr3 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) perovskite films, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement was carried out under an excitation wavelength of 450 nm (Fig. 4a). A blue shift in the position of the PL peak was observed, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a). When the content of MAPbBr3 was 4%, the PL peak intensity reaches the strongest indicating an obvious suppression of non-radiative recombination in the films (others are shown in Fig. S5†). We further employed the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to compare the carrier lifetime (τ) of pristine and 4% MAPbBr3 introduced films (Fig. 4b). Both curves are fitted with a bi-exponential decay function to obtain τ values, and the corresponding results are summarized in Table S3,† where τ1 and τ2 represent surface non-radiative recombination and bulk recombination, respectively, in perovskite film.36 Compared to the pristine, the MAPbBr3 introduced film exhibits longer τ1 and τ2, and the calculated τ are 23.99 and 38.44 ns for the pristine and MAPbBr3-containing films, implying fewer trap states and suppressed recombination. In addition, we performed confocal laser microscopy and PL mapping to analyze the carrier-dynamic properties of perovskite films. Compared with the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film, the film containing 4% MAPbBr3 exhibited a much stronger and more homogeneous PL distribution arising from the outstanding crystalline quality (Fig. 4c).

In the following, space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements were further adopted to study the trap state in the perovskite film on electron-only and hole-only devices (Fig. 4d and e). The device structures are FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au and FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, respectively, as inserted in the figures. The trap state density was decided using the equation:37  Here, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), ε is the relative dielectric constant (32 for MAPbI3), and VTFL is trap-filled limit voltage, which can be obtained from the dark I–V curves, L denotes the thickness of perovskite layer (200 nm measured from the cross-sectional SEM image). The density of electron traps decreases to 3.13 × 1016 cm−3 after the addition of 4% MAPbBr3 in the precursor solution, lower than the MAPbI3 devices (5.36 × 1016 cm−3). The density of hole traps also decreases from 9.01 × 1016 cm−3 to 6.41 × 1016 cm−3. These results further demonstrate the dual suppression effect on trap states of MAPbBr3 introduction, which is consistent with the TRPL results. Moreover, the leakage current produced by carrier recombination in the cells was studied by J–V test in dark conditions (Fig. 4f). The 4% MAPbBr3 added device presented almost one order of magnitude lower dark saturation current density than that of the pristine device, implying suppressed non-radiative recombination, which is consistent with the results from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements conducted under the dark condition (Fig. S6†). The Rs and Rrec of the equivalent circuit model stand for the series resistance and charge carrier recombination resistance of the device, respectively.38 The Rrec of the 4% MAPbBr3 device enhances from 60 kΩ to 122 kΩ compared to the control device, meaning that the introduction of MAPbBr3 could hinder charge carrier recombination and promote charge carrier transport.
We fabricated ST-PSCs with a planar p–i–n architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au because the commonly used mesoporous layer will increase the refraction of the optical path in the device, thereby decreasing the transmittance (see Fig. 5a for the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices). Fig. 5b shows the typical photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves for MAPbI3-based devices with and without 4% MAPbBr3 under reverse scan. We also prepared ST-PSCs with the same structure, but different MAPbBr3 contents and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S7a.† All the performance parameters of these ST-PSCs are collected in Table S4.† The incorporation of MAPbBr3 improves all the photovoltaic parameters with respect to the control device, and it is worth noting that there is a significant increase in fill factor (FF), which is in agreement with the improved crystallinity of MAPbI3 films when MAPbBr3 is presented as characterized above. The 4% MAPbBr3 ST-PSCs show the highest PCE with a Voc of 1.10 V, Jsc of 21.88 mA cm−2, FF of 75.79%, and PCE of 18.27% by the reverse scan. Further increase in the MAPbBr3 content, however, leads to decreased performance, which may result from ion segregation taking place via halide defects.22 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the solar cells based on MAPbI3 + x% MAPbBr3 (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) is strongly dependent both in intensity (in the Lambert region, wavelength < 500 nm) and in shape (in the cavity region, wavelength > 500 nm) on the perovskite active layer thickness, as expected (Fig. 5c and S7b†).39 The integrated current density values from the EQE spectra for the different components are reported in Table S4.† To evaluate the long-term stability of devices, we measured the performance of unencapsulated ST-PSCs stored with 65 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) in ambient air. The 4% MAPbBr3 ST-PSC maintains 70% of initial PCE after 456 h, whereas the pristine ST-PSC merely retains 40% of initial PCE (Fig. 5d). We further measured the uniformity and reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance (PV) of ST-PSCs. The PCE histogram fitted with a Gaussian distribution for the pristine ST-PSCs and the induced 4% MAPbBr3 ST-PSCs are shown in Fig. S8a,† and the statistical distribution of corresponding photovoltaic parameters is shown in Fig. S8b–d.† After counting the PV performance of 20 devices, it was observed that the average PCE of MAPbI3-based devices increased from 14.49% to 17.17% (summarized in Table S5†). The transmittance spectra of each semi-transparent device with or without the top electrode (TE) made in this work are displayed in Fig. S9,† and the characters under the 4% MAPbBr3 ST-PSC with 10 nm gold as TE could be recognized clearly demonstrating superb transparency. The recently reported PCEs of ST-PSCs to AVT are summarized in Fig. 5e. The findings demonstrate that the majority of previous studies have concentrated on low PCE with higher AVT. Our work obtains a high PCE value in a comparable AVT range, indicating the positive effects of crystallization strategy and defect suppression on ST-PSC. In addition to this, the light utilization efficiency (LUE) value serves as an evaluation criterion for the development of ST-PSCs, unifying the overall efficiency and transmittance of ST-PSCs. According to the definition of LUE (LUE = AVT × PCE), a proper balance between PCE and AVT is essential to achieve high-performance of ST-PSCs.40Fig. 5f shows the corresponding relationship graph between LUE and AVT. The detailed relevant values are all summarized in Table S6.†

Conclusions
In summary, we implemented the strategy of introducing MAPbBr3 as a whole into MAPbI3 precursor solution, which changes nucleation during the crystallization. A small amount of MAPbBr3 results in larger grains and better crystallinity with fewer grain boundaries, making up for the poor quality problems such as pinholes caused by the thin film. We found that using MAPbBr3 has multiple advantages: (i) it changes the size distribution of colloids in the perovskite precursor solution, thus affecting the nucleation sites to improve crystallization; (ii) Br ions can be embedded in the X-site of the perovskite lattice to achieve a more stable pseudo-cubic crystal structure; (iii) it does not require additional processing steps nor interfere with the one-step deposition of the perovskite film. As a result, we achieved planar semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with AVT of 26.23% for the 200 nm film and PCE of 18.27% for the corresponding device based on MAPbI3 + 4% MAPbBr3 composites. Our study provides a direction for efficient ST-PSCs, based on which combining high-quality, semi-transparent perovskite films with advanced process-optimized transparent top electrodes is expected to further enable practical applications of the device.

Device fabrication
Glass substrates coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (1.5 × 2.0 cm) were cleaned sequentially by ultrasonication in detergent, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min, followed by drying with a high flow of air and UV–ozone treatment for 20 min. Compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited on the FTO substrate via spraying from a precursor solution consisting of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in isopropanol (1:25 by volume ratio) at 450 °C with nitrogen as a carrier gas. 1 M MAPbI3 and 1 M MAPbBr3 both in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture (1:4 by volume ratio) were prepared in advance, respectively, and MAPbBr3 was added to MAPbI3 according to the volume ratio to obtain perovskite precursor with the Br content of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8%. Perovskite films were deposited on c-TiO2 using antisolvent-assisted one-step deposition method. 20 μL precursor solution was coated at a spin rate of 1100 rpm for 10 s and 4600 rpm for 35 s with dripping 200 μL chlorobenzene at the last 15 s before finishing the process at room temperature followed by mild annealing at 100 °C for 20 min on a hot plate.

Finally, about 10 nm thick gold electrode was obtained by thermal evaporation as the back electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2.
Characterization
The dynamic light scattering (DLS) was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZSE. The measurement was done with a glass cuvette at room temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed with a 9 kW Rigaku Smart Lab X-ray diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.540593 Å) in the range from 5° to 65° (2θ). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis were conducted by a high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Sirion 200, FEI Corp., Holland). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and transmittance spectra were obtained from TU-1901 spectrophotometer (PGENERAL, Beijing) and U-3900H spectrophotometer (HITACHI, Japan). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were recorded by a QM400-TM system employing a 450 nm laser as the excitation source. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained by using the Time-Correlated Single Photo Counting (TCSPC) technique, and the excitation was provided by a picosecond diode laser (PicoQuant) at a wavelength of 450 nm with a repetition frequency of 1 MHz. Confocal laser microscopy and PL mapping were carried out by Carl Zeiss LSM 710 (Germany) employed with a solid-state laser as an excitation source at 633 nm. All the measurements for perovskite films deposited on glass/FTO were performed at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 302N, Metrohm, Switzerland) within the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz in the dark box, and AC 10 mV perturbation was applied. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Nova software (v2.1.4, Metrohm, Switzerland). The J–V characteristics of the photovoltaic device were acquired by a Keithley 2420 source meter under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, employing an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (0.09 cm2 active area). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were collected from 300 to 900 nm by Newport QE Kit (PV Measurements, Inc.). The unencapsulated devices were kept in the dark at a temperature of ∼25 °C under controlled relative humidity (RH) of 65 ± 5%. Digital photos were acquired by Huawei Mate 30 Pro without any postproduction process.
