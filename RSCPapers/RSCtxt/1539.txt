    First published on 2nd November 2020AbstractFacile activation and conversion of small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, N2, CH4, and C6H6) into solar fuels or value-added chemicals under mild conditions is an attractive pathway in dealing with the worldwide appeal of energy consumption and the growing demand of industrial feedstocks. Compared with conventional thermo- or electro-catalytic approaches, the protocol of photocatalysis shines light on green and low-cost storage of sunlight in chemical bonds. For instance, artificial photosynthesis is an effective way to split H2O into molecular O2 and H2, thereby storing solar energy in the form of hydrogen fuel. Because of rational tunability in band gaps, charge-carrier dynamics, exposed active sites and catalytic redox activities by tailoring size, composition, morphology, surface, and/or interface property, semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) emerge as very promising candidates for photo-induced small molecule activation, including H2O splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, CH4 conversion and chemical bond formation (e.g., S–S, C–C, C–N, C–P, C–O). In this review, we summarize the recent advances in small molecule activation via artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor NCs, especially those consisting of II–VI and III–V elements. Moreover, we highlight the intrinsic advantages of semiconductor NCs in this field and look into the fabrication of prototype devices for large-scale and sustainable small molecule activation to store solar energy in chemical bonds.

1. Introduction
Facile activation and selective transformation of virtually inexhaustible or easy-to-generate small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, N2 and CH4, etc.) to sustainable fuels or value-added chemicals is a very important research area because of the economic relevance as well as the huge ecological impact.1–4 Nonetheless, the cleavage of these originally inert chemical bonds (e.g., O–H, C–H, CO, NN) is endothermic, sufficient external energy input is needed to overcome the energy barriers. Thus, a variety of synthetic protocols, such as thermal- and electro-catalysis, have been discovered and exploited.5–7 For example, the steam-methane reforming to produce CO and H2, the feedstocks of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, is normally performed at high temperatures (700–1100 °C) by taking alumina-supported nickel as the catalyst.8 In the scenario of electrocatalytic systems, the activation of CO2 into the CO2˙− anion radical intermediates usually proceeds at a reduction potential of −1.9 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which is regarded as the bottle neck of CO2 valorisation.9 In order to resolve above issues, appropriate catalysts are designed to drive these reactions through a low energy barrier process. Heterogeneous catalysts such as metal-free catalysts, metal nanoparticles, metal alloys, metal oxides/sulfides/carbides/phosphides/nitrides, MOFs, and COFs as well as homogeneous complexes of transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir, Mn, and Mo) have been verified effective to cut down the reaction temperature or the external bias, and simultaneously tune the reaction trails to yield desired products.10–13 However, external energy input in the form of heat or electricity increases the cost and the complexity in establishing a catalytic system toward small molecule activation.
Artificial photosynthesis taking sunlight as the mere energy input seems to be an ideal alternative for sustainable and low-cost small molecule activation.14–16 Sunlight is an inexhaustible, widespread, clean and renewable natural resource. Solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface per hour actually exceeds the annual global energy consumption. In nature, green plants exploit the energy of incident photons to convert raw materials (CO2 and H2O) into chemical energy (carbohydrates) via photosynthesis.3,17 Inspired by the structure and function of natural photosynthesis, scientific community has been devoting considerable efforts to replicate the natural process by establishing artificial photosynthetic systems.18–21 Obviously, the photocatalytic protocol is a greener and more effective pathway for following reasons: (i) solar light as energy input reduces fossil fuels consumption and exhaust gases (e.g., CO2, SO2, and NOx) emission, (ii) the combination of photo energy and appropriate catalysts easily overcomes the reaction barriers of chemical bond activation at room temperature, and (iii) last but not least, the mild reaction conditions of photocatalysis benefit the widespread application of this technology. For example, a 1 m2 photo-driven water splitting panel based on Al-doped SrTiO3 photocatalysts can split H2O into O2 and H2 with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.4% under sunlight, which shows the promising applications of artificial photosynthetic devices for energy-related small molecule activation reactions.22
The development of artificial photosynthetic systems has long been explored.23–25 In light of the fact that biological small molecule activation (e.g., N2 fixation, H2 evolution, H2O oxidation, and CH4 oxidation) in nature is realized by elegant molecular assemblies.  In this regard, semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) based artificial photosynthetic systems are becoming active and stable for their advantages in anti-photodegradation, multiple exciton generation and facile charge migration, etc. Though many review articles regarding artificial photosynthetic applications of bulk semiconductors and semiconductor NCs have been published,26–33 to the best of our knowledge, a review on small molecule activation via semiconductor NCs artificial photosynthesis has not yet been reported.
In this Review article, we will focus on the rapid advances in photo-induced small molecule activation using semiconductor NCs, a very important class of building blocks in artificial photosynthesis (Fig. 1). The main aspects are included: (i) intrinsic advantages of semiconductor NCs in photo-driven small molecule activation, (ii) energy-related small molecule activation including H2O splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation and CH4 conversion to produce solar fuels (e.g., H2, CO, NH3, CH3OH), and inert chemical bond transformation via electron-transfer processes (oxidation or reduction) or energy-transfer process using semiconductor NCs, and (iii) the prospects for small molecule activation via semiconductor NCs photocatalysis. We hope this article will offer knowledge to analyse and scrutinize the utilization of semiconductor NCs for facile and selective photo-induced small molecule activation in the near future.

2. Semiconductor NCs for photocatalytic small molecule activation
2.1 Brief introduction of semiconductor NCs
Semiconductor NCs are crystalline particles with typical dimensions in the range of 1–100 nm, thus exhibiting significant quantum confinement effects.34 Over the past decades, a set of synthetic routes, such as hydro/solvo-thermal synthesis, thermolysis method, co-precipitation synthesis, sol–gel method, and continuous flow approach, have been successfully established to produce binary or ternary II–VI NCs, including cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) chalcogenides, III–V semiconductor NCs (e.g., InP, GaN, and GaAs), as well as perovskite-type NCs (e.g., CsPbBr3, CH3NH3PbBr3, and Cs2AgBiBr6).35–37 The synthetic control over semiconductor nanocrystal materials has grown in sophistication to reach a stage where a wide variety of size distributions and morphologies can facilely be acquired, including quasi-zero dimensional quantum dots (QDs), one-dimensional nanorods or nanowires, two-dimensional nanoplates, and other convex and concave polyhedral shapes, branched and cage-like nanomaterials (e.g., tetrapods, nanosheets, and networks).
The flexible synthetic ability of semiconductor NCs not only contributes their large-scale applications, but also enables the opportunities in the control of optical properties, electronic structures, surface active sites, and charge-carrier dynamics. For instance, the electron and hole energy levels and the corresponding band gaps are size-dependent, thus enabling a facile pathway to tune light response from UV to near-infrared region.38,39 Moreover, the quantum confinement effects induce strong carrier–carrier interactions in NCs (e.g., PdSe, PdS, CdSe QDs), which leads to the production of multiple excitons by absorbing one photon with high energy.40,41 Last but not least, the extension of charge carriers outside physical domain will enhance electronic coupling between acceptors/donors and semiconductor NCs, thereby favoring interfacial charge transfer.42,43
2.2 Principle of small molecule activation via NCs photocatalysis
These attractive advantages have triggered extensive exploration of NCs-based photocatalytic systems for selective small molecule activation. The typical working principle of artificial photosystem for small molecule activation is illustrated in Fig. 2. Upon excitation, semiconductor NCs act as light absorbers to capture solar light, and are photoexcited by incident photons with energy (hν) equal to or larger than band gap (Eg) to generate high-energy state electron–hole pairs. Electrons at the bottom of conduction band (CB) migrate to the reductive active sites (e.g., [FeFe]-H2ase mimics, NiSx, Ni-clusters, cobaloxime, and MoS2) to initiate reduction reactions, including proton reduction, CO2 reduction, and N2 fixation, while holes at the top of valence band (VB) transfer to the oxidative active sites (e.g., IrOx, RuOx, and Cu-complex) for oxidation reactions, including H2O oxidation, and inert chemical bonds functionization (e.g., C–H, N–H, and O–H). Therefore, solar energy is consequently converted to usable fuels or value-added chemicals. In the case of solar-driven overall H2O splitting, the excited electrons resulting from this process reduce protons to H2, while the holes oxidize H2O to O2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of typical semiconductor NCs based artificial photosynthesis for small molecules activation, thus achieving solar-to-chemical conversion. 
For the abundant surface sites, semiconductor NCs can also work very well in the absence of external reductive and/or oxidative cocatalysts, which is quite different from molecular and bulk materials. The unbonded atoms at corners and edges, and surface vacancies, either cation or anion, would serve as the active sites of small molecule activation. For example, in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy reveals that the oxygen vacancies of BiOBr nanosheets contribute to adsorb and activate CO2 into *COOH intermediates, thus greatly increasing the activity of CO2 photoreduction under visible light.44 This property somehow favors the integration of light harvesting and catalytic active sites in a single nanocrystal. Moreover, mutual interaction between semiconductor NCs and substrates can facilely be enhanced by engineering the surface property, such as stoichiometry, surface charge and ligands, etc., which in turn provides possibilities in manipulating the catalytic kinetics of redox reactions.45–47
2.3 Evaluation of the photocatalytic performance
In most of the cases, the performance of photo-induced small molecule activation is reported as the rates of per gram, per active site, or turnover frequency (TOF). However, due to variations in the photocatalytic reaction conditions (such as, catalyst concentration, light intensity, reaction temperature, and so on), direct comparison of photocatalytic activities of different laboratories by rate or TOF alone is somewhat meaningless. At present stage, the report of quantunm yield and solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of a photo-induced redox reaction is highly recommended.48,49 As accurately determining the actual number of photons absorbed by photocatalysts suffers from light transmission and scattering in a photosystem, apparent quantum yield (AQY) is usually reported. The AQY of a certain photosystem toward small molecule activation can be estimated by following eqn (1). AQY = Ncharges/Iλ × 100%(1)where Ncharges represents the number of electrons or holes consumed in the formation of reductive or oxidative products within a specific time interval, Iλ is the number of incident photons of a certain wavelength reaching the surface of photoreactor during the same time interval.
Solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency is used to quantify the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy that is stored in the newly formed chemical bonds. Taking photocatalytic H2 production from H2O splitting as an example, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion efficiency can be estimated by following eqn (2). STH = (RH2 × ΔGr)/(P × S) × 100%(2)where RH2 is the rate of H2 evolution from overall H2O splitting reaction (mmol s−1), ΔGr is the Gibbs energy of H2O splitting reaction (237000 J mol−1), P is the energy flux of incident light AM 1.5G (mW cm−2) irradiated at photoreactor surface, and S is the irradiated area (cm2). If energy conversion efficiency of other molecules activation rather than H2O splitting is to be estimated, corresponding Gibbs energy of the certain reaction should be used.
3. Intrinsic advantages of semiconductor NCs for photocatalytic small molecule activation
3.1 Adjustable band-position alignment
Semiconductor NCs not only display discrete electronic transitions reminiscent of isolated atoms and molecules, but also enable the exploitation of the useful properties of crystalline materials, thus bridging the gap between molecular dyes and bulk materials. The band gap of semiconductor NCs confined in one, two, or three dimensions shifts along with the change of size distribution.50 Generally speaking, an increased number of confined dimensions yields a stronger degree of electronic confinement, thereby leading to a wider range of tunability in band gap. In a typical photocatalytic redox reaction, the mass transport to the surface of photocatalysts is not the rate-limiting step. Instead, the reaction rate is more likely controlled by interfacial charge-transfer kinetics. Therefore, in most of the cases, the activity of photocatalytic small molecule activation can facilely be tuned by size modulation of NCs.
For example, the photocatalytic H2 evolution of CdSe QDs is size dependent.51 As shown in Fig. 3a, CdSe QD powders clearly show size-correlated colour alteration, which is the direct evidence on the change of optical band gaps. Furthermore, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity is size-dependent in the presence of sulfite (SO32−) (Fig. 3b). Two half-reactions are involved at QD/H2O interface: (i) the oxidation of SO32− to SO42− and (ii) the reduction of protons (H+) to hydrogen. The rates of photocatalytic H2 evolution in the logarithmic form together with the quasi-Fermi energies (EF,n) are plotted versus the diameter of QDs (Fig. 3c). Obviously, both logarithmic rates and EF,n values increase as the size of QD decreases, indicating the good correlation between them. Due to the presence of quantum confinement effects, ECB becomes more reducing while EVB becomes more oxidizing with decreasing the size distribution of CdSe QDs. The driving force of oxidative half-reaction (ΔGox) is defined as the difference between EVB and E[SO42−/SO32−] while the driving force of reductive half-reaction (ΔGred) is given by the difference between ECB and E[H+/H2]. In comparison with ΔGox, ΔGred is strongly affected by QD size variation, thereby changing the activity of proton reduction.

3.2 Abundant surface sites
Semiconductor NCs normally consist of hundreds to thousands of atoms. Compared with bulk materials, the fraction of surface atom significantly increases in NCs.52,53 Taking CdSe QDs with a total of ∼100 atoms as an example, about 60% atoms are on the surface. Moreover, the ratio of surface atoms to total atoms is also dictated by nanocrystal shape. The elongated structure of nanorods and nanowires demonstrates a higher fraction of their constituent atoms on surface than QDs, thereby favouring the interaction between charge carriers and surrounding environment for photo-redox catalysis. In contrast to extended flat surfaces, nanocrystal surfaces are encircled by vertex, edge, corner, trap-site, unsaturated dangling bonds as well as surface ligands. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and time-resolved experimental studies (e.g., transient absorption spectroscopy) suggest that the surface complexity plays vital roles in controlling optical properties and charge-carrier dynamics of semiconductor NCs.54–56 For example, we had revealed that surface sulfide ions (S2−), either grown in lattice or binding on surface, could regulate interfacial charge-transfer dynamics (both electrons and holes) of CdSe QDs, thus providing an effective pathway to control the activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution from H2O.57
The uncoordinated metal ions and trap sites can also work as the active sites of small molecule activation. For instance, it is generally accepted that photo-excited QDs are able to deliver photoelectrons to uncoordinated metal ions (e.g., Cd2+) for H2 evolution.58 However, the abundant trap states on QDs would annihilate most of the photogenerated excitons, thus leading to the low activity of bare QDs toward photo-induced H2 evolution. Accordingly, the wide band-gap material ZnS layer was introduced on CdSe QDs to modulate the photogenerated charge-carrier kinetics. ZnS was selected for its matched lattice parameter, null visible-light absorption and good anti-photooxidation ability. It turned out that the anisotropic ZnS shell not only inhibits electron–hole recombination at trap states, but also retains electron transfer to surface cadmium ions for proton reduction (Fig. 4a). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy-high-angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) directly confirmed the anisotropic distribution of thin ZnS shell on CdSe core (Fig. 4b and c). Specifically, CdSe QDs with 46% ZnS coverage evolved H2 with a rate of ∼306.3 ± 21.1 μmol mg−1 h−1 within 40 h (Fig. 4d), corresponding to a turnover number of ∼(4.4 ± 0.3) × 105, which was ∼110-fold to unmodified CdSe QDs under the same conditions. The modified QDs toward photocatalytic H2 evolution was comparable to or even better than those obtained in the presence of external cocatalysts, such as metal clusters, metal complexes, and metal ions.

3.3 Excellent exciton generation and charge migration
Different from molecular dyes (e.g., eosin Y,59 and fluorescein60), the charge-carrier dynamics of semiconductor NCs can also be rationally tuned by tailoring size, composition, and morphology, thus regulating the activity of photo-redox reactions. In zero-dimensional (0D) QDs, ultra-small size limits the long-distance charge separation. Unlike 0D QDs where exciton is quantum confined in three dimensions, exciton migration in 1D nanorods or nanowires is only confined in the radial direction but bulk-like along the axial direction. Hence, nanorods favor the processes of electron–hole separation and long-distance charge transport, which might basically enhance the activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution from H2O. Taking CdS nanorod/Pt heterostructure as an example, transient absorption spectroscopic study indicated that excitons generated in CdS domain instantly dissociated via ultrafast electron transfer to Pt with a half-life of ∼3.4 ps.61 The charge separation state was surprisingly long-lived with a half-life of ∼1.2 ± 0.6 μs due to the holes trapped in CdS nanorod. The asymmetry in charge separation and recombination is the key feature for enhanced photo-redox catalysis.
Lately, the detailed time-resolved spectroscopic studies and modeling of the elementary charge separation and recombination processes show that charge recombination in 2D nanoplates is about 5-fold slower than that in 1D nanorods.62 In comparison with 1D nanorods, a hole in the 2D morphology requires extra random walk steps before reaching the recombination site, which slows the process of charge recombination (Fig. 5a). In the 2D CdS nanoplate-Pt heterostructure, Pt is selectively anchored on side surface (Fig. 5b). Along with increasing pH value from 10.0 to 14.7, the time of hole transfer from valence band of nanoplates to sacrificial reagents decreases from 37.7 ± 1.7 to 7.03 ± 0.20 ps (Fig. 5c). The promoted hole transfer plays a dominant role in enhancing the quantum efficiency of H2 evolution of 2D CdS nanoplates at pH below 13, which is significantly higher than those of 1D nanorods or CdSe nanoplates counterparts (Fig. 5d).

3.4 Effective triplet exciton donors
Similar with the typical metal complexes, like Ir(ppy)3 (fac-tris(2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N)iridium),63 semiconductor nanocrystal is able to activate chemical bonds via photo-induced energy transfer. The size-dependent band gaps of semiconductor NCs make it possible to work as visible light absorbers to form exciton and triplet exciton donors at the same time, which enable the smooth energy transfer from NCs to reactants. For example, Weiss and coworkers had employed colloidal CdSe QDs as efficient photocatalysts for homo- and hetero-intermolecular [2+2] photocycloadditions of 4-vinylbenzoic acid derivatives, one kind of the core components of many leading compounds for drug development.64 As shown in Fig. 6a, CdSe QDs, served as visible-light chromophores and reusable scaffolds, can donate energy to triplet states of organic molecules from triplet-like states, which is about 20 meV below the optically active states. Then, the photocycloaddition reactions are initiated with excellent switchable (between HH and HT) regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 98%) for syn-HH or syn-HT configurations that are previously unattainable using traditional methods. Moreover, selective hetero-coupling, apart from homo-coupling, was achieved by precisely controlling the triplet energy level of CdSe QDs (Fig. 6b). Very recently, using the triplet energy transfer from CdS QDs to a Pd(II)-alkyl iodide intermediate as the driving force, Pd-catalyzed Heck reaction was achieved in 82% yield.65

It is clear that the precise control of the size, shape, composition, and surface property can enhance the interaction between NCs and small molecules, which might realize the direct activation of inert chemical bonds (e.g., O–H, CO, NN, C–H) by facile photo-induced charge or energy transfer. Furthermore, the photo-redox positions of semiconductor NCs can be shifted by the methods of doping metal ions (e.g., Cu,66 Mn,67 Sn68) or non-metal ions (e.g., O,69 P,70 Cl71), regulating surface ligands as well as engineering surface stoichiometry.72–74 All of these pathways allow the control of catalytic activity of semiconductor NCs toward photocatalytic small molecule activation. In the following section, we will highlight the recent advances in small molecule activation via semiconductor NCs based artificial photosynthesis.
4. Recent advances in small molecule activation via NCs based artificial photosynthesis
4.1 Overall water (H2O) splitting
The splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 is a thermodynamically unfavorable chemical reaction according to Gibbs free energy (H2O → 1/2O2 + H2; ΔG0 = 237.13 kJ mol−1).75 The input energy should be large enough to overcome the energy barrier. The photoexcited electrons and holes are capable of driving proton reduction (0 V vs. NHE at pH = 0) and H2O oxidation (1.23 V vs. NHE at pH = 0), respectively. As H2 gas is one of the most potential energy carriers for its high energy density, transportation convenience, pollution-free combustion product, and important feedstock in many modern industrial processes, such as Fischer–Tropsch reaction and ammonia synthesis, solar-driven overall H2O splitting is considered as a cost-effective and convenient way to store the clean, renewable and sustainable solar energy in chemical bonds.76,77
Since the first report of photo-driven H2O splitting in 1972, a variety of systems (homogeneous or heterogeneous) have been developed to achieve high STH conversion efficiency.78 Compared with molecular dyes, semiconductor photocatalysts show better potential to realize large-scale solar H2 production for their ready synthesis, good stability, exceptional activity as well as the simple reactor and facility designs.79,80 Over the past decades, the size, structure, morphology and composition of the semiconductors are systematically optimized for enhanced light harvesting, exciton generation and charge separation. To facilitate the reaction of overall H2O splitting thermodynamically and kinetically, both reductive and oxidative cocatalysts are also delicately designed and integrated with semiconductor light absorbers. Generally, suitable H2-evolution cocatalysts are based on Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Fe, Co or Ni metal species, whereas suitable O2-evolution sites are consisting of Co, Fe, Mn, Ru or Ir.81,82 Coupling two photocatalysts together to rationally design Z-scheme system has been confirmed as an effective approach of photocatalytic overall H2O splitting.83,84
Among various semiconductors, metal oxide, (oxy)nitrides and nitrides consisting of metals with either d0 or d10 configurations (for example, Zr4+, Ti4+, V5+, W6+, Ta5+, Nb5+, Ce4+, In3+, Ga3+, Zn2+, Sn4+, Ge4+, and Sb5+) have been verified as potential photocatalytic materials to split H2O into H2 and O2. For instance,85–87 Ta2O5 and TaON can work as effective photocatalysts for photo-induced H2 evolution from H2O. However, the overall photocatalytic H2O splitting by Ta3N5 is still a big challenge due to preferential charge recombination at the defect sites. Recently, Ta3N5 nanorods comprising well-defined single crystals without grain boundaries are found to evolve H2 and O2 in expected stoichiometric molar ratio of 2:1 under sunlight.88
Meanwhile, metal chalcogenides (e.g., CdTe, CdSe, CdS, and CdSe/ZnS) are particularly promising candidates in visible-light-driven redox reactions for their good charge transfer kinetics and suitable band-position alignments. The conjunction of metal chalcogenides in the form of QDs, nanorods, and nanoplates with transition metal ions (e.g., Fe2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) has become an extremely effective and facile pathway of photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents, such as ascorbic acid, methanol, isopropanol, and triethylamine.89–91 For instance, Cd0.5Zn0.5S twinned NCs in conjunction with NiSx clusters generated in situ could evolve H2 gas with an internal quantum efficiency approaching 100% at 425 nm with Na2S/Na2SO3 as hole scavengers.92 However, due to the p orbitals of chalcogenide ions are shallower than O 2p orbitals, metal chalcogenides can hardly decompose H2O into H2 and O2. The facile oxidation of chalcogenide anions (e.g., S2−, Se2−, and Te2−) within the materials by holes near the valence band would lead to apparent self-photocorrosion before O2 evolution.
Rational integration of oxidative and reductive cocatalysts on a single metal chalcogenide nanocrystal to simultaneously overcome the overpotentials of both half-reactions and achieve efficient charge separation is regarded as an effective pathway to realize overall H2O splitting.93 Recently, Wolff et al. fabricated a CdS nanorods decorated with Pt nanoparticles and molecular oxidation co-catalysts to achieve overall H2O splitting.94 In the system, Pt nanoparticle was anchored at the tips of the nanocrystal as the electron sink, while the Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl2 (RuDTC) based oxidation catalyst anchored to the sides of CdS nanorods through dithiocarbamate groups were near the natural hole trapping sites, but far away from Pt sites at the tips of CdS nanorods (Fig. 7a). This configuration achieved ultrafast hole transfer (∼300 fs) to RuDTC catalysts, thus successfully preventing the nanorods from photo-degradation. In the presence of TEOA, the Pt-decorated CdS nanorods could evolve H2 gas effectively under visible light (Fig. 7b). With the increase of the amounts of RuDTC molecules catalyst on per nanorod, the oxygen generation rate reached a maximum rate of 170 μmol gcat−1 h−1 when 83 molecules RuDTC were anchored on per nanorod (Fig. 7c). Nonetheless, the ratio of H2 to O2 never reaches the stoichiometric result of 2 to 1 as some photogenerated holes may oxidize cysteine ligands or lattice sulfide anions.

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced hot-electron transfer mechanism is an extremely promising way for photo-redox catalysis especially for achieving long wavelength excitation.95,96 Currently, the realization of photocatalysis through LSPR-induced hot-electron transfer mechanism is most based on Au nanoparticle (NP) materials.97 The Au NP-based hetero-nanostructures enabling to harvest and concentrate even sub-band gap photons by the plasmonic antenna effects are a favored selection. In the half-cut Au(core)–CdS(shell) (HC-Au@CdS) heterostructure, the Au core is selectively excited at λex = 640 nm to avoid the CdS shell absorption range (λ < 500 nm). Hot electrons generated in Au core inject into the CB of CdS by Landau damping and subsequently reduce proton to H2 gas. Lowering Fermi level (EF) of Au NP from +0.87 V with the interfacial electron transfer provides the driving force for the oxidation of H2O to O2 (E(O2/H2O) = +0.81 V vs. NHE at pH 7) (Fig. 8a). Notably, the photocatalytic activity is sensitive to CdS thickness as a result of quantum size effect. When the thickness of CdS is around 2 nm, the system realizes an unprecedentedly high external quantum yield (0.24%) of H2 evolution at 640 nm. Furthermore, the rates of H2 and O2 keep unchanged with a ratio of 2:1 during 200 h (Fig. 8b), indicating its good stability in H2O activation.

The integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell based on semiconductor NCs is another approach to realize visible-light-driven H2O splitting.98–100 A typical integrated PEC H2O-splitting system comprises a photocathode and a photoanode sensitized by different light absorbers. Under light irradiation, the photocathode absorbs photons with energies exceeding band gaps to generate electron–hole pairs. Then, electrons migrate to reductive active sites for H2 production, while holes transfer to the counter electrode for H2O oxidation. Thus, a well-designed PEC cell featuring both photocathode and photoanode can overcome the sluggish kinetics of charge separation and the oxidative decomposition of semiconductor NCs to split H2O into H2 and O2 in a molar ratio of 2:1. Compared with organic dyes, semiconductor NCs possess the superiorities in absorption, tunability, and durability, thus emerging as promising alternatives to solar H2O splitting. For instance, the unassisted PEC cell comprising CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanode integrated with CdSe QD-modified NiO nanosheet photocathode realized the evolution of H2 gas via overall neutral H2O splitting under visible light.101 The optimized system afforded average rates of 2.24 (H2) and 1.07 (O2) mmol h−1 cm−2, corresponding to a STH conversion efficiency of 0.17% (Fig. 9), which is comparable to the efficiency of natural photosynthesis, and validates the concept of spontaneous PEC devices for practical small molecule activation in the future.

Spectroscopic studies reveal that interfacial photo-induced electron transfer proceeds smoothly, but hole migration is somewhat problematic, which has become the bottleneck of PEC overall H2O splitting. In order to resolve the dilemma, hole transfer layers (e.g., Au, p-type silicon, CuCrO2, and graphdiyne)102–105 and small organic molecules (e.g., phenothiazine and derivatives)106 have been employed to promote hole capture and migration at electrode interface, thereby greatly enhancing activity and durability of H2O oxidation on photoanode surface. Moreover, photocathodes based on sophisticated nanoparticle assemblies of semiconductor QDs have also been constructed to favour light harvesting, electron–hole separation as well as oriented charge migration.107 Benefiting from the complementary light absorption and the typical type-II staggered band-position alignment, the hand-in-hand assembly of CdSe QDs and CdTe QDs sensitized photocathode integrates functions of the two kinds of QDs in light harvesting, effective exciton dissociation as well as directional charge migration at the electrode interfaces, thereby greatly enhancing the activity of H2 evolution from PEC H2O splitting under visible light.108 In addition to above approaches, photovoltaic–powered electrocatalysis (PV–EC) devices show much higher STH conversion efficiencies, usually in the realm of ∼20%.109 However, this method involves the integration of photovoltaic device components, which would increase the cost and difficulty for large-scale applications.
4.2 Inert chemical bond activation via photo-redox catalysis
As disclosed above, photocatalytic overall H2O splitting based on semiconductor NCs is an ideal pathway to convert solar energy into H2 fuel. Due to the sluggish kinetics of H2O oxidation half-reaction, the STH energy conversion efficiencies are still below the threshold of commercial applications. The use of hole scavengers can boost the activity and stability. However, this strategy shows the drawbacks of wasting the oxidation power of holes as well as increasing the cost of the systems.110 Therefore, it is practically necessary to exploit the integration of selective organic transformation with H2 evolution, which emerges as an attractive solution to above issues as both solar fuels and value-added chemicals can be produced together. By tuning the oxidation power of photogenerated holes, a variety of chemical bonds (e.g., C–H, O–H, and N–H) can be selectively activated. In 2013, we firstly realized the C–H bonds activation to afford cross-coupling product via C–C bond construction and equivalent amount of H2 gas under visible light at room temperature, namely cross-coupling hydrogen evolution (CCHE) reaction.111 Lately, aromatic C–H bond was successfully functionalized to produce aniline, phenol and other derivatives by taking onium (i.e., 1-methylquinolinum ion (QuH+), and 3-cyano-1-methylquinolinum ion (QuCN+)) as the photocatalysts and Co(dmgBF2)2(CH3CN)2 (dmg = dimethylglyoximate) as the H2-evolution catalysts (Fig. 10).112,113 Compared with the present industrial approaches in production aniline and phenol, the photo-redox strategy shows advantages in selective and effective inert chemical bond activation.

Semiconductor NCs are particularly suitable for photo-redox catalysis due to their efficient visible-light-harvesting capabilities, abundant surface active sites, and tunable redox potentials. Especially, the high ratio of surface atoms provides highly reactive sites for efficient interfacial energy or electron transfer to activate various kinds of chemical bonds.114–118 For instance, the selective oxidation of thiols to disulfides is a simple but very important and tricky reaction as S–S bonds play vital roles in drug delivery systems, smart materials and natural proteins. In 2014, we revealed that a variety of thiols could be quantitatively coupled to disulfides along with the evolution of H2 gas under visible light by taking CdSe QDs as the photocatalysts (Fig. 11a).119 Furthermore, the addition of small amounts of Ni2+ salts could dramatically enhance the activity of this conversion by facilitating the formation of hydrogen atoms on QD surface. As disulfides show much weaker affinity toward QD surface than that of thiols, the over-oxidation of thiols to sulfoxides and sulfones was avoided. Furthermore, we found that the thiyl radical (RS˙) generated in situ could selectively abstract hydrogen atom from C–H bond of benzyl alcohols (Fig. 11b), which showed good reaction efficiency, excellent functional group tolerance, and high site-selectivity in polyhydroxy compounds.120

In 2018, Xie et al. reported that the C–H bond of methanol (CH3OH) could be activated without oxidation of the –OH group to produce ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH) on MoS2 nanofoam decorated CdS nanorod (MoS2/CdS),121 as shown in Fig. 11c. Under light irradiation, the holes in CdS nanorods oxidize CH3OH to produce ˙CH2OH radical via a concerted proton–electron transfer process, and then two ˙CH2OH radicals couple together to form one HOCH2CH2OH. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons reduce protons to H2 gas by taking MoS2 as the active sites. DFT calculations were performed to gain mechanistic insights into the preferential activation of C–H over O–H bond. As shown in Fig. 11d, DFT studies suggest that the cleavage of the C–H bond in methanol occurs preferentially on CdS surface for following reasons: (i) the formation energy of ˙CH2OH is about 0.5 eV lower than that of CH3O˙, (ii) the production of ˙CH2OH possesses a much smaller reaction barrier (0.8 eV) than that of CH3O˙ (1.6 eV), and (iii) more importantly, ˙CH2OH intermediate shows a small adsorption energy (−0.2 eV) on CdS, thus leading to the facile desorption from CdS to avoid consecutive oxidation.
By modulating morphology, size and/or active sites of the photocatalysts, other materials such as CdS nanoparticles,122 CdS nanosheets,123 CdS/CdOx QDs,124 TiO2,125–127 g-C3N4,128 and MOFs,129 are also employed to activate a variety of renewable and low-cost feedstocks, including biomass (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), biomass-derived intermediates (e.g., furfuryl alcohols, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and 2-methylfuran) and plastic wastes (e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(lactic acid), and polyurethane) by the holes to produce value-added chemicals while the electrons can simultaneously reduce protons to generate H2. For instance, Luo and coworkers disclosed that, by taking Ru-doped ZnIn2S4 nanomaterials as the photocatalysts, H2 evolution was successfully integrated with the generation of diesel-fuel precursors via dehydrogenative C–C coupling reaction under visible light (Fig. 12).130 Obviously, the coupling of solar fuel (H2) production with oxidative organic transformation for bulk or fine chemical synthesis is an extremely promising pathway of solar energy utilization and storage.

In addition, the photogenerated reductive intermediates (such as hydrogen atom) can be used (such as participating in hydrogenation reaction) before forming H2 gas. In this mechanism, solar energy is harvested by semiconductor NCs to create excitons, and then the photogenerated electrons transfer to surface-active sites for initiating the production of reductive species. In a recent example, a bioinorganic hybrid platform consisting of genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae and indium phosphide (InP) nanoparticles was developed to realize the photoreduction of 3-dehydroshikimic acid to Shikimic acid, a common precursor for several drugs and fine chemicals.131 This system well combines the rationally designed metabolic pathways and the electron donation capabilities of illuminated semiconductor NCs. As shown in Fig. 13a, polyphenol moieties functionalized InP nanoparticles were assembled on genetically engineered yeast to form modular inorganic–biological hybrids. Upon visible-light excitation, photogenerated electrons flowed from surface-bound InP nanoparticles to regenerate NADPH from NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) inside the S. cerevisiae Δzwf1. Subsequently, the regenerated NADPH fueled subsequent conversion of 3-dehydroshikimic acid to Shikimic acid (Fig. 13b). Due to the suitable direct band gap (Eg = 1.34 eV) of InP nanoparticles, the processes of providing reductive equivalents to central metabolic processes and accepting electrons from various species in culture medium facilitate the carbon and energy-efficient production of metabolite Shikimic acid.

It is reported that the radical anion of perylene bisimide can effectively reduce stable aryl chlorides to produce aryl radicals, which are trapped by hydrogen atom or used in carbon–carbon bond formation.132 Recently, ZnSe/CdS QDs have also been shown as effective catalysts for photo-redox catalytic activation of carbon–halogen bonds.133 Upon photo-induced single electron transfer, (hetero)aryl halides (Ar–X) turn into corresponding radical anions (Ar–X˙−), and then generate (hetero)-aryl radicals by releasing halide anions. Carbon radical abstracts a hydrogen atom on QD surface to form C–H bond. Furthermore, controllable deuteration of halogenated compounds was realized by taking D2O as deuteration reagent and porous CdSe nanosheets as photocatalysts (Fig. 14). Mechanism study reveals that the reaction begins with the adsorption of substrates on CdSe, and then the formation of deuterium radicals and aryl anion radical (Ar–X˙−) proceeds via photo-induced electron transfer from CdSe to substrates.134 This method shows very good selectivity and functional group tolerance. The carbon radicals react with deuterium atoms to generate a variety of deuterated products, such as boronic acids, halides, alkynes, and aldehydes, which can work as the synthons to synthesize complex deuterated molecules. Compared to current C–H/C–D exchange, this strategy shows good site selectivity and controllable number of deuterium atoms on target molecules.

Perovskite NCs are confirmed as low-cost, abundant and highly efficient candidates for broad applications in photo-redox organic synthesis. For instance, perovskite NCs (e.g., Cs3Bi2Br9, and CsPbBr3, etc.) are revealed as effective photocatalysts for the selective activation of aliphatic and aromatic C–H bonds to produce aldehydes, ketones, or the construction of C–C bonds.135,136 Recently, Yan and coworkers reported that APbBr3 (A = Cs or methylammonium (MA)) type perovskite NCs with a size distribution around 2–100 nm were capable of realizing effective photocatalytic α-alkylation with a turnover number of >52000 via an ultrafast photo-induced charge transfer process (Fig. 15).137 More importantly, this photocatalytic system was successfully extended to construct C–N and C–O bonds with moderate to high reaction yields.

Obviously, semiconductor photocatalysts demonstrate wide applicability and good stability in photo-induced chemical bond activation. Some other semiconductor NCs, such as Mn-doped QDs, TiO2 nanoparticles with non-innocent ligands and highly crystalline carbon dots, have also been employed as effective photocatalysts for advanced organic transformation, where photo-generated oxidative species (e.g., singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anion) act as active equivalents to initiate these conversions.138–140 One of the most intriguing conversion is the one-step photocatalytic activation of CH3OH to synthesize EtOH under visible light by taking ultra-stable gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor nanowires as the photocatalysts (Fig. 16a).141 Specifically, about 17 mmol EtOH was generated in 12 h with p-GaN nanowires as the photocatalysts, giving an impressive rate of 48500 mmol g−1 or 4050 mmol g−1 h−1. It is revealed that the conversion occurs on the c-plane of GaN nanomaterials. As shown in Fig. 16b, mechanistic studies indicate that the photoexcited electrons aggregate on the GaN surface instead of internal regions because of the energy band of p-GaN bends downward near the surface, thereby leading to the formation of highly negatively charged N− anions at the c-plane surface upon light illumination. The N− anion then attacks C–H bond of MeOH to generate methyl carbene by eliminating a H2O molecule. The methyl carbine then methylates the C–H bond of another MeOH to give EtOH via dimerization. By controlling the reaction temperature at 0 °C, n-propyl alcohol could also be produced. Apparently, compared with the traditional methods (e.g., carbonylation and hydrogenation, direct reductive carbonylation, and carbonylation via dimethyl oxalate intermediate)142–144 which require harsh reaction conditions, the direct photocatalytic valorization approach is highly efficient and atom-economic, thus showing great potentials for low-cost CH3OH activation.

4.3 Carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction integrated with organic transformation
Owing to the high dissociation energy of CO bond (∼750 kJ mol−1), the activation of stable CO2 molecule is difficult and the reduction of CO2 involves multiple protons and electrons resulting in a wide variety of reductive products, such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), formic acid (HCOOH), methanol (CH3OH), as well as even higher hydrocarbons.145 For the high thermodynamic stability, an effective catalyst and sufficient energy input are essential to activate the linear CO2 molecules. In recent years, artificial photosynthesis, in addition to thermal- or electro-catalytic protocols, for conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals or solar fuels has attracted much attentions.146–149 From a viewpoint of light absorbers, the research can be classified as follows: (i) molecule dyes, such as Ir-complex, Ru-complex;150–152 (ii) inorganic semiconductor materials, such as quantum dots and rods;153–155 and (iii) organic semiconductors, such as carbon nitride,156–162 covalent organic frameworks (COFs).163–166 The cocatalysts including metal complexes, metal oxide, alloys, metal clusters, and single-atom catalysts, etc. are introduced to integrate light absorbers. Carbon-based materials, especially graphene, have been also incorporated to promote charge-transfer processes.167–170 Various types of photocatalysts constitute the grand occasion of today's CO2 reduction via artificial photosynthesis. Similar to photocatalytic H2 evolution, numerous CO2 photoreduction systems require the aid of sacrificial reagents. Upon light irradiation, photoexcited electrons are used to reduce CO2 while holes are consumed by sacrificial reagents (e.g., TEA, TEOA, ascorbic acid and Na2SO3) to complete the entire catalytic cycle. However, the introduction of sacrificial reagents undoubtedly increases economic cost.
The photocatalytic system combining CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation together is an ideal, albeit very challenging, pathway for CO2 conversion.171–173 We summarize some representative reports of photocatalytic CO2 reduction by taking H2O as the electron donor from 2014 to 2020. As shown in Table 1, the sluggish kinetics of both H2O oxidation half-reaction and CO2 reduction half-reduction endow quantum yields around 1%, far below the threshold of practical applications.

Integration of CO2 photoreduction with oxidative organic synthesis emerges as a promising solution to above issues. Photogenerated holes for valuable organic synthesis can not only avoid the waste of holes to increase the economic feasibility, but also solve the problem of sluggish kinetics of H2O oxidation. The released protons and electrons of the oxidative half-reaction are used for CO2 reduction, thus greatly enhancing activity and durability of the photosystem. In 2015, Ag–TiO2 was reported as the photocatalysts to reduce CO2 under ultra-violet light, while photogenerated holes were able to convert aromatic alcohols to corresponding aromatic aldehydes.174 Because of the wide band gap, TiO2 based photocatalysts are only applicable to ultra-violet irradiation, greatly limiting its wide applications. A solar-light-driven system that integrates CO2 photoreduction with oxidative organic synthesis together is highly demanded.
In 2016, Yang et al. reported a hybrid system, which successfully combined good light harvesting of inorganic semiconductors, CdS nanoparticles, and high activity of biocatalysts, non-photosynthetic bacterium of Moorella thermoacetica, for CO2 photoreduction and thiol coupling (Fig. 17).207,208 CdS nanoparticles are biologically precipitated in bacterium to ensure their intact mutual interaction. Under visible light, the photogenerated electrons in CdS transfer to bacterium to produce reducing equivalents [H], which further participates in Wood–Ljungdahl pathway to convert CO2 to acetic acid (CH3COOH). Meanwhile, photogenerated holes in CdS nanoparticles oxidize cysteine to the disulfide of cystine. Follow-up time-resolved spectroscopic studies revealed that a two-pathway mechanism was involved in this system.209 High quantum efficiency of charge-transfer pathway to H2ase for H2 evolution as molecular intermediate dominates the long time scale (24 h), while direct energy-transducing enzymatic pathway is responsible for the acetic acid production at the short time scale (3.0 h). Very recently, a silicon nanowire/Sporomusa ovata system realized a solar-to-acetate conversion efficiency of 3.6% over 7 days when coupled with a photovoltaic device, showing exceptional activity and durability for CO2 conversion.210

Recently, we successfully coupled CO2 reduction with organic synthesis under solar light using semiconductor QDs.211 As shown in Fig. 18a, the photogenerated electrons are employed to reduce CO2, while the photogenerated holes can initiate the oxidative coupling of 1-phenylethanol to generate pinacol. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that CO2 was energetically favorable to adsorb at the anion-vacancy on QD surface (Fig. 18b), thus leading to the activation of linear CO2 molecule to a bended structure. To gain direct thermodynamic evidences on CO2 reduction, QDs with different sizes were employed for CO2 photoreduction. Almost no CO gas was produced when the size of QDs was larger than 2.5 nm (Fig. 18c). Further theoretical studies indicated that the introduction of sulfur vacancy could simultaneously cut down the energy barriers of both CO2 reduction and C–H bond cleavage (Fig. 18d). The optimized CdSe/CdS QDs converted CO2 to CO with an AQY of 32.7% using TEA as electron donor. In the presence of 1-phenylethanol and derivatives, the rate of CO generation was 27.63 mmol g−1 h−1 with a selectivity of 94%. Meanwhile, the C–C coupling product of pinacol reached to a yield of 98%. Apparently, this strategy provides an exact answer to low-cost and effective CO2 valorization. Lately, a MOF-supported Ru-complex hybrid was used to couple CO2 photoreduction with semi-dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline.212

To sum up, the protocol of integrating CO2 activation and organic synthesis together via semiconductor NCs based artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach to the full utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes to simultaneously produce solar fuels and value-added chemicals.213 Thermodynamically and kinetically favoured oxidation half-reaction greatly enhances the solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of CO2 reduction, which is much higher than those systems taking H2O as electron donor. Recently, Reisner and coworkers demonstrated that perovskite-BiVO4 PEC tandems could sustain bias-free syngas production coupled to H2O oxidation for three days under 1 sun irradiation.214 However, solar-to-H2 and solar-to-CO conversion efficiencies are only 0.06% and 0.02%. We believe that the concept of CO2 reduction coupled with organic transformation may show great potentials in scale-up and high-efficient solar-driven CO2 conversion.
4.4 Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation
The catalytic nitrogen (N2) activation in industry is the Haber–Bosch process, which can fix N2 with H2 to produce ammonia NH3 (N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3), an important industrial chemical that is widely used to produce dyes, medicines, and explosives. Also, NH3 provides adequate fertilizers for agricultural production and increases food production.215–217 However, the high NN triple bond energy (∼941 kJ mol−1) makes N2 molecule extremely stable under ambient conditions.218,219 In order to dissociate N2 into nitrogen atoms, the Haber–Bosch process proceeds at high temperatures (400–500 °C) and pressures (15–30 MPa), which occupies about 2% of the annual world energy consumption as well as causes the emission of greenhouse gases. Moreover, H2 gas used in the Haber–Bosch process is typically derived from natural gas (CH4) via steam reforming process and water–gas shift reaction. In view of the increasing energy crisis and the environmental concerns, alternative pathways toward sustainable and cost-effective N2 fixation are in great necessity.
In nature, nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, such as Rhizobium, Azospirillum, Cyanobacteria and Azotobacter chroococcum, can catalytically reduce atmospheric N2 gas to produce NH3 by means of nitrogenase at ambient conditions, thus providing bioavailable nitrogen sources for plants growth, proteins and nucleic acids synthesis, etc.220,221 In principle, nitrogenase is composed of two components, the MoFe protein (component I) containing the FeMo cofactor (FeMo-co) and P-cluster, and the Fe protein (component II). To be specific, the Fe protein receives electrons from reducing species and transfers electrons to FeMo-co through P-cluster of MoFe protein driven by coupling ATP hydrolysis. The FeMo-co acts as an active site for N2 binding and activation to ammonia NH3. Thanks to the energy input maintained by ATP hydrolysis and the electron transfer with the assistance of Fe protein, N2 fixation runs efficiently under natural conditions.
Motivated by nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, it is anticipated to realize N2 fixation on MoFe protein by using photoexcited electrons from artificial chromophores. In 2016, King and co-workers fabricated a CdS:nitrogenase MoFe protein biohybrid to accomplish N2 reduction to NH3 under 405 nm light irradiation.222 Light energy absorbed by CdS nanorods replaces chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis and the migration of photoexcited electrons in CdS nanocrystal replaces ATP-coupled electron transfer process with Fe protein (Fig. 19a). Experimental results demonstrate that CdS binds at or near the Fe protein binding site on MoFe protein. Despite the unclear role of P cluster, whether or not participates in electron transfer, the photocatalytic NH3 production rates reach 315 ± 55 nmol (mg MoFe protein)−1 min−1, thereby giving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 75 min−1 and an internal quantum yield (IQY) of 3.3% in the presence of sacrificial electron donor, HEPES. The turnover number (TON) of NH3 production in 5 hours is as high as 1.1 × 104 based on MoFe protein. Furthermore, the existence of FeMo-co inhibitors, such as C2H2, CO, and H2, gives rise to no catalytic activity of N2 activation, confirming that FeMo-co is the active site during the photocatalytic process (Fig. 19b). Compared with molecular dyes (e.g., Ru-complex), CdS NCs show stable conjugation with MoFe protein, thus resulting in the high efficiency of N2 fixation.

In addition to the semi-artificial photosynthetic systems, a variety of semiconductors, such as metal oxides/sulfides including Ti, Bi, Mo, Cd, W, Zr,223–225 bismuth oxyhalides (e.g., BiOBr, BiO)226,227 and layered double hydroxides (LDHs)228 have been established for N2 fixation to generate NH3via artificial photosynthesis. The design of appropriate active sites from defect engineering to bind N2 and break NN bond can significantly enhance the activity of photo-induced N2 fixation. As shown in Fig. 19c, the Mo-doped W18O49 ultrathin nanowires with abundant defects were effective photocatalysts for N2 fixation.229 The doped low-valence Mo species as coordinative unsaturated sites adsorb N2 molecule and provide an adequate channel for electron transfer to activate NN bond. Illumination under 300 W Xe-lamp leads to a NH3 production rate of 195.5 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of ∼0.33% at 400 nm with Na2SO3 as the sacrificial agent. More importantly, the solar-to-ammonia conversion efficiency reaches 0.028% under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. The proposed reaction pathway of photocatalytic N2 fixation to NH3·H2O is illustrated in Fig. 19d. Mo–W metallic dimer centers work as the active sites to adsorb N2 and transfer photoexcited electrons to N2 through coupling proton transfer, and eventually evolve two NH3·H2O molecules. Very recently, Zhang et al. disclosed that TiO2 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies (VO) obtained via a Cu-doping strategy exhibited remarkable activity toward photocatalytic N2 activation to produce NH3 in water up to 700 nm light irradiation (Fig. 20), further indicating the vital importance of anion defects in NN bond activation.230

Moreover, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metallic nanoparticles/semiconductor NCs heterostructures has received much attention in N2 activation because of its visible-light-harvesting and electric-field-enhancing effects.231–233 In 2016, Misawa and coworkers fabricated an Au-nanoparticles/niobium-doped strontium titanate (Nb-SrTiO3)/zirconium/zirconium oxide (Zr/ZrOx) photoelectrode for the selective fixation of N2 into NH3 through plasmon induced charge separation.224 As shown in Fig. 21a, the NH3 synthesis device contains two compartments for separating collection of the reduction and oxidation products. The anodic chamber was filled with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution while the cathodic chamber was injected with aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution using N2 gas. The plasmon-induced electrons were injected into the conduction band of SrTiO3 to reduce N2 at the Zr/ZrOx surface. On the contrary, holes trapped near the Au/Nb-SrTiO3/H2O interface efficiently induced an oxidation reaction of H2O. As a result, the formation of both NH3 and O2 was observed with rates of 0.73 nmol h−1 cm−2 and 0.53 nmol h−1 cm−2, respectively, thus giving a ratio between NH3 and O2 of approximate 4:3 under visible light (Fig. 21b). Benefiting from the favoured adsorption of N atoms on the Zr/ZrOx surface sites, a large amount of NH3, not H2, is produced in the system. Recent study showed that the aerophilic–hydrophilic surface of Si-photocathode could also enrich N2 concentration at Au active sites while supress proton reduction, thus facilitating NH3 production by reducing the energy barrier of N2 activation.234

4.5 Methane (CH4) activation via photocatalysis
Methane (CH4) is the main component of natural gas, found in underground rock (such as shale gas) or stems from biogas or methane hydrate with huge reserves in the world.8,235 CH4 can not only be regarded as fuel, but also is an important C1 building block in industry to produce alcohols, aromatics, long-chain alkanes and alkenes, etc. In particular, the conversion of CH4 gas into liquid fuels allows reducing the cost of storage and transportation. In the view of chemistry, CH4 molecule shows highly symmetrical tetrahedral configuration without any functional group. The extremely high dissociation energy of C–H bond (about 439.3 kJ mol−1) and the low polarizability make the direct activation of CH4 molecules quite tough under ambient conditions.236 In industry, CH4 is indirectly converted into liquid hydrocarbons through a combination of steam reforming and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, both of which require high energy input. During past decades, a variety of homogeneous or heterogeneous systems via thermo catalysis can only work effective for CH4 activation under harsh reaction conditions.237
Photocatalytic CH4 activation would be an ideal pathway because sunlight is the most abundant and clean renewable energy source.238 Developing innovative photocatalysts for CH4 conversion has drawn much attention in recent years. Heterogeneous photocatalysts based on semiconductor metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, WO3, BiVO4, Bi2WO6, and Ga2O3) have been successfully developed for CH4 conversion.239 The C–H bond of methane can be activated by photo-induced reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals, alkoxyl radicals and so on. For example, photogenerated holes can oxidize H2O to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which is a highly electrophilic specie to abstract the H atom from the C–H bond of CH4 to produce carbon radicals. As the homolytic cleavage of C–H bond is exothermic (ΔH = −60 kJ mol−1), the reaction can proceed under mild condition.
To date, the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 includes two main categories: the indirect and direct CH4 activation pathways. Indirect photocatalytic conversion route converts CH4 into hydrogen via steam CH4 reforming (CH4 + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H2) or dry reforming of CH4 (CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 + 2CO). For instance, Yoshida et al. disclosed the high activity of Rh/Rh2O3/K2Ti6O13 photocatalysts toward steam CH4 reforming under Xe-lamp irradiation at 50 °C.240 As shown in Fig. 22a, Rh-loaded K2Ti6O13 prepared via the photo-deposition method exhibits higher activity for CH4 conversion than the Pt-, Ru-, Pd-, or Au-loaded K2Ti6O13 prepared by same method or impregnation–calcination method (Fig. 22b). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicates that Rh-loaded K2Ti6O13 prepared by photo-deposition method is a mixture of small rhodium metal particles and large rhodium oxide particles. The metallic Rh accepts the photogenerated electrons from K2Ti6O13 conduction band to promote hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, the rhodium oxide can receive the photoexcited holes from the K2Ti6O13 valence band to oxidize CH4 molecules to form carbon dioxide (CO2). The bifunctional Rh-based cocatalysts cooperatively favor the oxidative reaction and the reductive reaction, thereby enhancing the entire photocatalytic activity for steam CH4 reforming. In 2020, a SrTiO3-supported rhodium (Rh/STO) was revealed to efficiently realize CH4 reforming under ultra-violet light at low temperatures, in which lattice oxygen (O2−) acts as a mediator of this conversion.241 The light excited holes were used for CH4 oxidation, while photoelectrons reduced CO2 to CO over rhodium.

In the realm of direct photocatalytic CH4 conversion, three main pathways are normally included: (i) non-oxidative or oxidative coupling of CH4 to produce ethane or ethylene, (ii) partial oxidation of CH4 by reacting with oxidants to produce valuable oxygenates, such as methanol (CH3OH) and formaldehyde, and (iii) directly functionalization to generate value-added organic compounds via photo-redox catalysis. For instance, Tang et al. reported that Pt nanoparticles and CuOx clusters co-modified TiO2 could work as effective photocatalysts to show an increased C2 products (ethane and ethylene) yield (6.8 μmol h−1), which was the highest yield for C2 products among all the photocatalytic CH4 conversion reported under atmospheric pressure.242 Mechanistic insights indicated that Pt nanoparticles functioned as an electron acceptor to facilitate charge separation, while CuOx could avoid deep dehydrogenation and over-oxidation of C2 products. Recently, the FeOx/TiO2 photocatalysts, consisting both FeOOH and Fe2O3 active sites, were used for the selective transformation of CH4 to CH3OH under moderate light irradiation (close to one Sun; Fig. 23).243 Here, photogenerated electrons in TiO2 migrate to iron oxide and then react with H2O2 molecules to form ˙OH radicals. On the contrary, CH4 molecules react with photogenerated holes in the valence band of TiO2 to produce methyl radicals (˙CH3). Finally, ˙CH3 and ˙OH radicals turn into the desired product of CH3OH. Unfortunately, UV-light is needed to initiate the activation of C–H bond because of the wide band gap of TiO2 nanomaterials. Future research would like to focus on the exploration of visible-light responsive photocatalysts for C–H activation.

In addition, surface plasmon resonance protocol is another pathway of CH4 conversion. For instance, plasmonic metal, such as Ag,96 decorated ZnO nanoparticles showed high quantum yield (8% at wavelength below 400 nm and 0.1% at wavelength of ∼470 nm) of CH4 oxidation (Fig. 24). The application of plasmonic metals extends the light harvesting to long wavelength region. Despite the intrinsic advantages of solar energy-mediated CH4 conversion via artificial photosynthesis, this research field still faces following challenges: (i) the efficiency is extremely low, (ii) the control of selectivity remains challenging, and (iii) the mechanistic insights into photocatalytic CH4 conversion is not very clear. To increase the activity and selectivity, novel photocatalysts based semiconductor NCs with enhanced light harvesting, suitable band positions, promoted charge separation and abundant surface-active sites are to be designed and constructed. It should be pointed out that the direct C(sp3)–H functionalization (e.g., amination, alkylation, and arylation) of CH4 and other light hydrocarbons via semiconductor NCs photo-redox catalysis remains unexplored.

5. Strategies to enhance efficiency of artificial photosynthetic small molecule activation
In an attempt to greatly facilitate the multi-electron and multi-proton processes of small molecule activation, (i) the intrinsic properties (e.g., size, morphology, structure, composition, defect, ligands, etc.) of semiconductor NCs should be elegantly designed, (ii) the generation and transport of photo-induced carriers needs to be well monitored, and (iii) the mechanism of photo-redox catalytic reactions at the active sites should be studied. The above aspects will help us to establish advanced artificial photosystems with exceptional efficiency, selectivity and durability toward small molecule activation. In this section, we will introduce four main strategies to enhance efficiency of small molecule activation via artificial photosynthesis.
5.1 Delicate surface design of semiconductor NCs
The surface and interface property, including defects, edges, corners and ligands, etc., of semiconductor NCs plays very important role in photophysical processes of light absorption, exciton generation, charge separation, and interfacial charge transport, and thereby greatly controlling the efficiency of photo-redox reactions.244–248 For example, defects can tune band-position alignment of NCs to enhance light harvesting as well as act as the active sites for small molecules (such as CO2) adsorption and activation in some cases.211 However, things are far more complicated than they seem. Defects can also work as the center of photogenerated electron–hole recombination, thus cutting down the fraction of charge carriers participating in photo-redox reactions. Another example, the surface ligands stabilize the high-energy colloidal NC particles in solution, while also somewhat block interfacial charge transfer, especially those long insulating alkyl chains.249 Moreover, surface stoichiometry is another sensitive parameter to affect the exciton decay dynamics of nanocrystal structures, thus controlling the photocatalytic performance.250 We revealed that, by modifying the surface of CdSe QDs to give an appropriate Cd/Se ratio, the activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution was significantly enhanced.72 That's because high ratio of surface Se increases the possibility of electron–hole recombination at hole traps. Thus, multiple factors should be taken into account in designing semiconductor NCs to reach a balance between photophysical processes and chemical reactions, which is highly expected for well-controlled and promoted photo-induced small molecule activation via artificial photosynthesis.
The surface binding of cocatalysts is another effective pathway to kinetically facilitate the redox reactions.251–253 For bulk materials, the well-controlled loading cocatalysts on specific facets are feasible by multiple approaches, such as photo- or thermo-induced deposition.254 However, the integration of NCs, especially QDs, with cocatalysts, such as non-noble metal ions, in a cooperative and well-controlled manner remains very challenging. Recently, we disclosed a two-step strategy for site- and spatial-selective integration of earth-abundant elements with CdSe QDs (∼2.0 nm in diameter) at atomic level.255 Briefly, CdSe QDs are initially modified with an anisotropic ZnS shell, leading to the construction of CdSe/ZnS QDs. Then, by controlling the solvent, reaction temperature and reaction time, a certain number of Zn2+ ions are changed to typical divalent metal ions (such as Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, denoted as M2+) via selective cation exchange, thus successfully integrating light absorber, protecting layer and H2-evolution site together in a single QD (Fig. 25a). The ultra-thin and anisotropic ZnS shell plays three roles: (i) protect CdSe core, (ii) realize site-selective binding of non-noble metal ions, and (iii) enable close and firm interaction between CdSe QDs and active sites. Taking CdSe/Zn1−xFexS as an example, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy revealed that photo-induced electron transfer from CdSe QDs to Fe-active sites occurred within 90 ps (Fig. 25b and c). Thereby, more than 880 mL (∼39300 mol) molecular H2 is constantly produced from 6 mL alkaline aqueous solution during a consecutive 172 h (>one week) irradiation, thus giving an AQY of 22% at 450 nm (Fig. 25d). We believe the multifunctional QDs can be further extended to other applications, such as CO2 reduction and N2 fixation.

5.2 Engineering band structure of heterostructure NCs
Semiconductor NCs show great advantages in exciton generation, thus emerging as attractive photocatalysts for visible-light-driven small molecule activation. However, the process of electron–hole recombination causes the giant loss of high energy charge carriers that might participate in redox reactions. In order to address this issue, the charge carrier dynamics should be regulated to inhibit electron–hole recombination. Among various trials, the construction of heterostructure, especially type II and quasi-type II, is one of the most effective pathway to engineer band structure to decrease electron–hole wavefunction overlap to facilitate spatial charge separation.256–258 For example, Zamkov et al. reported that quasi-type II ZnSe/CdS dot-in-rod heterostructure could achieve simultaneous ultra-fast charge separation and ultra-slow charge recombination.259 However, ZnSe core is fully covered by CdS, which blocks the process of interfacial hole migration. The quasi-type II CdSe/CdS dot-on-rod heterostructure designed by Patra and coworkers not only realized facile electron–hole separation, but also favored hole transfer from CdSe domain to sacrificial reagent in solution.260 Benefiting from the combined advantages of efficient charge separation, slow recombination and facile migration, this quasi-type II heterostructure showed much higher activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution than that of bare CdS nanorods or CdSe nanoparticles under identical conditions.
Recently, the integration of two or three semiconducting materials in a single 1D nanorod to construct heterojunctions has been verified as a promising pathway to synergistically enhance light absorption and sequential charge migration.261,262 For instance, Yu et al. integrated three semiconductors into a single nanocrystal by stepwise synthesis,263 thus leading to the construction of ternary multi-node sheath ZnS–CdS–Cu2−xS heteronanorods (Fig. 26a). High-resolution TEM and HAADF-STEM revealed structural and elemental compositions of the ternary heteronanorods (Fig. 26b). Because of their complementary band gaps, the ternary heteronanorods showed extended light response in UV, visible, and NIR range. Moreover, the incorporation of Cu2−xS on CdS domain via selective cation exchange resulted in the formation of p–n heterojunction between CdS and Cu2−xS confirmed by DFT calculations. Owing to the staggered band-position alignment in the ternary heterostructure, the delivery of photogenerated electrons to conduction band of CdS while the collection of the holes in the valence band of Cu2−xS were thermodynamically feasible, thereby promoting the electron–hole carrier separation (Fig. 26c). The enhanced solar light harvesting and efficient charge separation in the ternary ZnS–CdS–Cu2−xS heteronanostructure led to significantly increased activity of photo-induced H2O splitting.

Although significant progress has been made in the study of applying type II or quasi-type II heterostructures for photo-redox reactions, further research in the area should pay attention to following aspects: (i) comprehensive consideration the various factors, including shape, size, crystal phase, and crystallinity, in the design of heterostructures, (ii) rational control of the elemental ratio at the interface to tune the electronic band structure, (iii) accurate regulation of the band position to tune the driving forces of reductive and oxidative half-reactions, and (iii) selective and non-destructive loading of active sites for a variety of small molecules activation. Regarding the structure design and regulation of semiconductor materials one can turn to some excellent review articles elsewhere.264–267
5.3 Time/spatial-resolved techniques for operando investigation
Traditional micro/nano characterization techniques can reveal the structural and composition information of semiconductor NCs. For instance, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), is a powerful technique to reveal the size, morphology, defect, and lattice parameter of nanomaterials. Other steady-state techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), are also widely used to gain structural detail and elemental composition of semiconductor NCs. However, photocatalysis involves the generation and transport of high-energy charge carriers, beyond the scope of steady-state techniques. Therefore, time/spatial-resolved techniques emerge at a historic moment.
Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and pump–probe transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy are powerful techniques to monitor the exciton generation, charge-separation state and interfacial charge transfer processes of semiconductor NCs. Lian, Kamat, Peng, Krauss and Zhu et al. have done lot of pioneer works in this field.268–272 The better understanding of the charge-carrier dynamics helps us reaching into the mechanistic insights of chemical bond activation via semiconductor NCs photocatalysis. Unfortunately, direct observation the electronic state and chemical structure of active sites under realistic conditions is challenging.
X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy is able to monitor the transient (ps time scales) electronic and local geometric configurations of metal-based catalytic center in a photocatalytic system, especially those of homogeneous systems.273–275 Recently, this technique is successfully extended to the heterogeneous photocatalysis.276 In 2017, we reported the first work to examine charge transfer dynamics in CdSe/CdS QDs–Pt nanoparticles assembly.277 Pt L3 XANES under laser irradiation indicated that the surface Pt atoms were partially reduced in a time scale of 60 ps, which was highly consistent with the result of ultrafast transient absorption measurements (∼65 ps). The study provides the first example using XTA to investigate charge carrier kinetics in a photosystem, indicating its potential applications in revealing the mechanism of photo-induced small molecule activation.

In situ X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) is an attractive pathway to monitor the structure change of catalytic center under realistic conditions.278 For instance,279in operando XAS measurements were employed to reveal the structure variation of catalytic center in a typical photosystem consisting of CdSe/CdS QDs and Ni2+ ions under alkaline conditions (pH = 12), see photocatalytic setup in Fig. 27a. Under visible light, the absorption Ni K-edge energy in X-ray absorption near edge structure spectra (XANES) shifted to a lower energy (0.73 eV), suggesting partial reduction of Ni2+ to low-valence species (Fig. 27b). Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum indicated that an extra peak at 2.15 Å, matched with Ni–Ni bond in Ni foil, appeared in k2-weighted Fourier transform EXAFS curve. That is a handful of Ni atoms escape from Ni(OH)2 nanosheets to form vacancies (VNi) and corresponding Ni-clusters (n < 20) under light irradiation (Fig. 27c). In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) monitored a broad signal with a calculated g value of 2.23 appeared under light irradiation, which further confirmed the formation of ferromagnetic Ni0 species in realistic conditions (Fig. 26d). The in situ generated Ni0x/Ni1−x(OH)2 worked as the real catalytic species of H2 photogeneration in this system.

Other in operando experiments, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), room-temperature and freezing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy are also widely employed to investigate the photo-induced electronic change of the active sites, the reaction intermediates and reaction pathways of small molecules (such as H2O, CO2, N2, and CH4, etc.) on surfaces.280–283 The rapid advances of in operando analysis allow us to reveal the structure–property–activity relationships, which in turn guides the design and synthesis of semiconductor NCs and catalysts.

          Density functional theory (DFT) calculations to gain mechanistic insights
Theoretical DFT calculations, including ground-state DFT and constrained DFT, not only emerge as effective toolkits to gain insights into the catalytic mechanisms complement to experimental evidences, but also provide guidance in the design and construction of photocatalysts for enhanced activity and stability.252,284–287 As a result, DFT calculations are widely employed in the field of photocatalytic small molecule activation. Taking photo-induced CO2 reduction as an example, Xie et al. reported that sulfur-deficient CuIn5S8 containing charge enriched Cu–In dual sites achieved near 100% selectivity for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction to CH4, but not CO.288 DFT calculations revealed that, in comparison with Cu single sites in the pristine CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layer, the dual active sites of low-coordinated Cu and In atoms could effectively stabilize the rate-limiting COOH* intermediates (Fig. 28). As a result, this advantage of VS-CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers helped to lower overall activation energy barrier of photocatalytic CO2 activation.

In comparison with Cu single sites in pristine CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers, the dual sites of Cu–In showed much stronger binding strength with CHO* species, thereby altering the protonation step from endoergic to exoergic. The largely decreased energy barrier allowed this step to proceed spontaneously to evolve CH4 instead of CO on the VS-CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers. Moreover, the charge enriched In sites in the VS-CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers showed much stronger hybridization with the O atom of CH3O intermediates relative to Cu sites in pristine CuIn5S8 counterparts. The strong In–O interaction on VS-CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers also led to the facile breakage of C–O bond in the CH3O intermediates, thus finally decreasing the desorption energy of CH4 molecules. The above mentioned advantages enabled the VS-CuIn5S8 single-unit-cell layers to reach near 100% selectivity as well as high activity (8.7 μmol g−1 h−1) of visible-light-driven CO2 reduction to CH4, indicating that rational design of dual-metal sites could thermodynamically and kinetically modulate the trail of CO2 photoreduction.
DFT calculations were also carried out to understand the influence of other factors on photocatalytic CO2 reduction, such as facet effects of Cu2O nanocrystals.289 DFT calculations show that the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2O is thermodynamically favorable on both (110) and (100) facets (Cu termination is considered for both facets), although the co-adsorption on (110) is much more favorable than that on (100). It is notable that the co-adsorption of CO2 and H2O on Cu-terminated (110) lead to the re-arrangement of Cu atoms on the surface, thus leading to the formation of Cu clusters. The cluster formation, however, does not occur on either Cu/O-terminated or Cu-terminated (100) on CO2 and H2O adsorption. These results suggest that (110) facet of the synthesized Cu2O nanoparticles is likely to be Cu terminated and therefore promotes photo-driven CO2 activation.
At present, DFT calculations have been widely employed as a robust theoretical platform to reveal the catalytic insights into other small molecule activation in photocatalysis. Moreover, the rapid advancement of time-dependent DFT or constrained DFT extremely makes the understanding of photocatalytic mechanisms under excited state possible. Apparently, with the help of operando techniques and DFT calculations, we believe that the construction of highly efficient and active photocatalysts for practical artificial photosynthesis will come into reality in the near future.
6. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in small molecule activation via semiconductor NCs based artificial photosynthesis. Benefiting from the intrinsic advantages in light absorption, exciton generation, charge transfer, surface engineering and so on, semiconductor NCs based photosystems do have demonstrated amazing advances in many chemical reactions, such as H2O splitting and CO2 reduction. The obtained results have laid a solid foundation for scale-up small molecule activation using semiconductor NCs-based devices for following reasons: (i) semiconductor NCs are typically free of expensive noble metals and toxic elements, (ii) the protocols of semiconductor NCs synthesis always have the benefit of easy to scale up, either in aqueous solutions or in organic solvents, (iii) the photophysical and photochemical basis of semiconductor NCs have been clearly revealed, and (iv) many reported systems in Lab have shown very promising efficiency and durability. However, energy conversion efficiency of scale-up devices is generally lower than that of solution systems because of the inherent difficulty in controlling the structure and orientation of nanocrystal photocatalysts with very small particle sizes. Despite some prototype devices in Lab show attractive efficiency toward small molecule activation, it's quite difficult to scale up. For instance, the well-known strategy of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2O splitting have pH gradients as well as high levels of solution resistance based on the significant distances between reduction and oxidation sites. Vigorous stirring of the reaction solution and the addition of a large amount of electrolyte are necessary, both of which complicate the scaling-up process of the reaction system.
Based on above discussions, the combination of a variety of characterization techniques is the general trend of future scientific research. Deep understanding of mechanistic insights can help us in structure optimization, surface engineering, catalytic-site design, and device integration to increase the efficiency and stability of small molecule activation via artificial photosynthesis. We hope this review article can shine light on the photocatalysts design and eventually lead to construct artificial photosynthetic devices for efficient, selective and scale-up small molecule activation, thus enabling to develop viable fuel alternatives and value-added chemicals from solar energy. Therefore, human society can reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, but taking environmentally benign, and sustainable energy resources instead (Fig. 29). For instance, catalytic H2O splitting provides a promising way to convert sunlight to chemical energy, which is stored as H2 fuel. H2 oxidation in fuel cells is an energy-releasing process to generate electric energy and H2O as the only product. Obviously, such a H2-based new energy cycle is appealing for sustainable development as no wastes are produced during the processes.

To sum up, future research in the field of artificial photosynthetic small molecule activation by semiconductor NCs may encounter following challenges:
(i) Enhancing the activity and durability of photocatalytic N2 fixation. Despite the substantial advances of electrocatalytic N2 fixation, artificial photosynthetic N2 reduction reaction represents a more sustainable strategy for N2 fixation beyond Haber–Bosch chemistry.290 Nonetheless, the development of photocatalytic N2 fixation is in its infancy. The activity is relatively low, usually in the realm of micromole or below. Considering, but not limited to, the thermodynamically stable NN, the kinetic challenge to reduce N2via multi-electron and multi-proton processes should be studied in great detail. Thus, the synthesis of suitable photocatalysts for highly efficient N2 to NH3 conversion still remains a challenge. The future research of N2 photoreduction on semiconductor NCs should focus on following aspects: (i) modulating optoelectronic structures of photocatalysts, (ii) introduction of active sites for N2 adsorption and activation in photocatalysts via defect engineering, surface engineering, chemical modification and heteroatoms doping, (iii) combination of theoretical computations and experimental studies to thoroughly understand the mechanisms, and (iv) construction of sophisticated assemblies to organize NCs and external cocatalysts in proximity, thus realizing ultra-fast, continuous and unidirectional multi-electron and proton transfer. We have very reasons to believe that the efficiency of N2-to-chemical conversion via artificial photosynthesis will be greatly enhanced.
(ii) Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into two or more carbon atoms (C2+) products. The transformation of CO2 into solar fuels and value-added chemicals has great potentials to mitigate the depletion of fossil resources and abate carbon emissions. At present, CO, formic acid and CH4 are the main products of most photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems. However, the synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products such as ethylene and ethanol from photocatalytic CO2 reduction has rarely been reported, albeit they are highly attractive because of the versatility of these products in the chemical and energy industries.291 In order to realize the photo-induced transformation of CO2 into C2+ products, the strategies including surface modification, facet engineering, vacancy steering, dopant modification, and cocatalyst design of semiconductor NCs are to be performed to thermodynamically favor CO2 activation as well as kinetically increase the coverage and elongate the lifetime of one key intermediate (e.g., *CHO) of CO2 reduction, thereby enhancing the C–C coupling possibility between the adsorbed intermediates for C2+ products formation.
(iii) Photocatalytic C(sp3)–H functionalization of light hydrocarbons. Direct activation of light hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane, and so on, remains a major challenge for the chemistry community. Because of the intrinsic inertness of these compounds, harsh reaction conditions (for instance, high temperature and/or pressure) are typically required to enable C(sp3)–H bond cleavage with a bond dissociation energy (BDE) from 96.5 to 105 kcal mol−1. Recently, photo-redox catalysis by using cerium complex or decatungstate anion has been reported as a powerful platform for the direct activation and functionalization of light hydrocarbons under ultra-violet irradiation or high pressure.292,293 However, the direct functionalization (e.g., amination, alkylation, and arylation) of methane and other simple hydrocarbons by semiconductor NCs under visible light and ambient conditions (e.g., room temperature, atmospheric pressure) is still a big challenge. Photocatalysts based on semiconductor NCs with optimized structure, suitable band-position alignment and rich surface active site are to be designed to abstract hydrogen atoms from C(sp3)–H fragments upon visible-light excitation, thus generating reactive intermediates for subsequent reactions.
