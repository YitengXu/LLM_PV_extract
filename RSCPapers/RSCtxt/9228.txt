    , Accepted 15th November 2020First published on 16th November 2020AbstractThemoelectric materials exhibit great potential in alleviating the energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of homologous series is helpful for understanding the relationship between structure and properties, thereby providing new strategies for seeking high-performance thermoelectric materials. Among the various structure prototypes, pavonite is a rising star and has received increasing attention as a potential n-type thermoelectric material owing to their diverse structures and extremely low thermal conductivity. In this review, we summarized the structural characteristics of pavonite and introduced the relationship between structure and thermoelectric performance. The pavonite structure consists of two alternating slabs with separately tunable thicknesses, and has wide adaptability for elemental substitution. Specifically, the participation of heavy atoms in the pavonite structure results in large unit cell volume and Grüneisen parameters, and thus extremely low lattice thermal conductivity. Finally, we briefly discussed the potential of pavonite compounds in thermoelectric applications.
1. Introduction
Since the second industrial revolution, human demand for fossil energy has surged, and at the same time, environmental problems have also followed. Therefore, the development and utilization of renewable energy sources, such as wind, tidal and solar energy, are the key to solving the energy and environmental crises we are facing. Thermal energy is one of the most common energies in nature. How to convert thermal energy into electrical energy to reduce the use of fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is challenging and of increasing importance. Thermoelectric (TE) materials utilize the carriers in the material to carry out directional transmission under the drive of temperature field or electric field, so as to realize the mutual conversion of thermal energy and electric energy.1–3 TE materials can collect waste heat from car engines, industrial waste heat and even sunlight, thereby improving the efficiency of fossils.
In 1821, German scientist Thomas Johann Seebeck observed that the temperature difference at the node of two different metals in a closed loop caused the compass magnet near the loop to deflect, demonstrating that the temperature difference can generate current in a closed loop. In the following thirty years, the relationship between thermal and electrical transport within materials has been continuously studied, resulting in the TE effect mentioned today (as shown in Fig. 1a and b). TE equipment is “green” with no mechanical moving parts and no noise, and the small possibility of failure results in low maintenance cost.
 Fig. 1  (a) The Seebeck effect for TE generator. The p-type and n-type semiconductors in the thermocouple form a circuit. Maintaining the temperature difference across the thermocouple, charge carriers (holes and electrons) will flow from the hot side to the cold side, establishing an electric field between the two junctions. (b) The Peltier effect for TE cooler. When a current is applied in the direction shown, the two charge carriers in the thermocouple can absorb heat from the cold end and then release it to the hot end to form a cooling effect. (c) Comparison of the efficiency of conventional engines and TE generators. (Data reproduced from ref. 2 and 5). 
Commercial applications of TE materials include TE power generation, infrared detection, refrigeration of microelectronic component, thermostats, etc.4 However, the conversion efficiency of most TE materials is between 5% and 20%, which still has a huge gap compared with traditional heat engines (Fig. 1c).5 Therefore, it is urgent to develop materials with high thermal and electrical properties. The performance of TE materials is usually quantified by a dimensionless factor, figure of merit (ZT), which is defined as ZT = S2σT/κtot, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κtot is the total thermal conductivity. For better TE performance, large Seebeck coefficients, high conductivity, and low thermal conductivity are usually expected. These parameters cannot be controlled independently, and the relationship between them can be summarized as follows: (1) (2) κtot = DCpρ = κlat + κele(3) κele = LσT(4)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electrical charge, h is the Planck constant, m* is the DOS effective mass, n is the carrier concentration, μ is the carrier mobility, τ is the relaxation time, D is the thermal diffusivity, Cp is the specific heat, ρ is the mass density, κtot is the lattice thermal conductivity, κele is the electronic thermal conductivity, and L is the Lorenz number. In the past few decades, a variety of strategies have been adopted to optimize the power factor or thermal conductivity of materials, such as band structure engineering,6 resonant state doping,7 nano-structure8 and phonon glass electron crystal (PGEC).9
Researchers are pursuing the intentional design of materials with target characteristics, and have made efforts by analyzing the relationship between existing structures and their characteristics. Material homology provides the possibility of fine-tuning the material structure, which can better reveal the relationship between structure and properties.10–15 From the structural point of view, homologous series can be expressed as a series of structures constructed in modules according to the same structural principle.16 On the basis of maintaining the “pattern” of the modules, the size of some modules varies incrementally as the number of basic coordination polyhedra in the modules changes.13,17–19 For the pavonite homologues with the general formula of MeN+1Bi2SN+5, the structure usually consists of two parts: one is usually referred to as a “non-accreting” slab, while the other is a slab with variable thickness.13,20–25 In view of this principle, plentiful pavonite compounds can be designed and synthesized experimentally. Due to the complex structures and the diverse constituent atoms, this series of compounds is expected to be a good candidate for TE with low thermal conductivity. In this review, we summarize the structural characteristics and TE-related properties of the pavonite homologues, and then discuss the prospect of pavonites in the TE field. Although the structure of the pavonite series has been discussed in some articles, the principle of structure design such as element substitution has not been fully studied. Moreover, the relationship between the TE properties and structures of pavonite homologues has not been fully explored.
Therefore, we discuss the structures of pavonite homologues and the TE performances to introduce the progresses and challenges of optimizing TE properties. We hope that this review will encourage more researchers to explore the potential of pavonite homologues in TE applications.
2. The crystal structure of pavonite homologues
2.1 General description of the pavonite structure
In 1954, Nuffield discovered a new mineral while studying “benjaminite”, which was named “pavonite” in memory of Professor M. A. Peacoc.26 After that, three scientists, Makowicky, Mumme and Watts conducted a more detailed study on it. In 1977, they defined a general formula MeN+1Bi2SN+5 for pavonites, which was an extensive series of complex sulfides in the Cu–Ag–(Pb)–Bi–S system. In the formula, Bi represents the atoms occupying the center of the pyramids in the A slabs; Me represents metal atoms occupying all octahedral sites on the A and B slabs; the N value represents different members of the series.22,27
2.2 Thickness tuning of the slabs in pavonites
Pavonite homologues with a three-dimensional framework usually crystallize in the C2/m space group.23,28–33Fig. 2 shows the details of a pavonite structure. The ideal pavonite homologues can be described as ordered intergrowth of two alternating types of slabs:
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagram of the structure principle of pavonite homologous series compounds with fixed thickness slabs (A slabs) and variable thickness slabs (B slabs). The A slabs are composed of single [MeS6] coordination octahedron alternating with paired [BiS5] square pyramids, while the B slabs are composed of distorted edge-sharing octahedra of variable thickness. 
(a) The thickness of the A slab is generally considered to be unchangeable, so it is also called the “non-accreting” slab.34 The A slab consists of single [MeS6] coordination octahedra alternating with paired [BiS5] square pyramids, and is only one [MeS6] octahedron wide along the c-axis. The two pyramids are connected to both sides of the octahedra in an edge-sharing manner. Therefore, considering the connection method and the number of building units, the composition of the thinner slabs can be summarized as [MeBi2S4], where Bi is generally bismuth.22
(b) The thicker slab (B) with a galena-like structure is referred to as the “accreting” slab, which consists of distorted octahedra of variable thickness. These slabs are similar to the continuous layers of galena and are parallel to its (−113) plane. The thickness of the B slab can be expressed by the number of octahedra (N) in the chain of octahedra (edge-sharing) stretching in the direction [1−10]PbS. Similar to the A slab, the composition of the B slab is described as MeNSN+3, which is associated with the A slab by sharing two out of (N + 3) sulfur atoms on both sides with the octahedra in the A slab.22
A pavonite structure can be described with another representation NP, and N represents the number of octahedra along the diagonal direction of the B slab, and for AgBi3S5, it is record as 5P. The pavonite homologues with different N values are shown in Fig. 3. The N values of most pavonite homologous range from 2 to 8, but in theory it can vary from 0 to ∞. When N = 0, there is no octahedron in the B slabs, such as AgBiS2Cl3.35 The A slabs form a channel through the interaction of Bi and S atoms in the pyramids, while chain-like Cl atoms are located at the center of the channel. When N is close to ∞, it can be approximately regarded as a little-deformed galena-like structure.21

2.3 Elemental substitution
In addition to adjusting the thickness of the B slabs in a wide range, the wide adaptability of the pavonite homologues structure also allows multiple elemental substitutions within the structure. In the general chemical formula MeN+1Bi2SN+5, the metal atoms at the Me position in the A slabs can be Ag, Cd, Pb, Cu, Mn, In, etc., while the atoms in the octahedral coordination of the B slabs are mostly Bi.32,34,36–42 As the proportion of cations at the Me position in the formula increases, the Bi atoms in the B slabs can also be partially replaced by other elements. A special case concerns the substitution of Sb for Bi atoms.20 When Sb occupies the octahedral sites in the B slabs, it seems that a stable octahedron cannot be formed due to the enhanced repulsion of the lone electron pair of Sb3+. Therefore, pure antimonate has never been found to have a pavonite structure.
A pavonite structure forms in antimonate only when hetero-atoms are introduced to partially replace Sb to restrict the role of Sb in the octahedral sites of the B slabs, such as Li3xSb6−xS9 (x = 1/3),43 Ag2.5CdSb6.5Se12 (Fig. 3),44 and MnSb2Se4.45 The S atoms in the pavonite structure can be replaced by Se or partially substituted by univalent halogen atoms (Cl, Br).35,46–48 According to the valence bond theory, low-valent cations and halogen atoms are usually introduced at the same time to maintain charge balance. Poudeu et al. first reported partially Cl-substituted pavonite AgBi2S2Cl3 in 2002, where N = 0.35 Halogen can be substituted for S within a wide range of N values. Currently, Ag5.14Bi4.86S7.76Br4.24 reported by Ruck et al. is the one with the largest N-value (N = 7) where the S can be substituted by halogen, but higher values are still possible.19 In the ideal pavonite series, an interesting phenomenon occurs when sulfur sites are occupied by halogen atoms. Starting from the pavonite compound with N = 1, halogen atoms always tend to occupy the S atom with the smallest coordination number in the accretion plate first. As the proportion of halogen atoms in the structure gradually increases, they will co-occupy with S atoms in other positions of the “accretion” slabs. Simultaneously, the variation of the unit cell volumes is also consistent with the increase of halogen elements. Fig. 4 shows the pavonite compounds AgBi3S4Br2 (Br/S = 0.5), Ag1.46Bi2.54S3.09Br2.91 (Br/S = 0.94) and Ag5.14Bi4.86S7.76Br4.24 (Br/S = 0.55).17,19 In AgBi3S4Br2, Br completely occupies the S atom position with a coordination number of 2. Then, as the ratio of Br/S increases, the Br and S atoms jointly occupy the connection points between the A slabs and B slabs. When the thickness of the “accretion” slabs increases, apart from the above two cases, Br will partially occupy the positions of other anions in the “accretion” slabs. This phenomenon can be maintained until Ag5.14Bi4.86S7.76Br4.24 (N = 7). However, in all halogen-substituted compounds, the S atom positions in the A slabs connected to the square pyramid are not substituted. This may be related to the shorter bond length of the S atoms at these positions, resulting in stronger bonding energy. Therefore, we surmise that the halogen atoms may not be able to completely replace the S atoms due to the lack of structural stability.
 Fig. 4  The pavonite compounds (a) AgBi3S4Br2 (Br/S = 0.5),17 (b) Ag1.46Bi2.54S3.09Br2.91 (Br/S = 0.94),17 and (c) Ag5.14Bi4.86S7.76Br4.24 (Br/S = 0.55).19 When Br/S is greater than 0.5, Br and S are mixed at the S position connecting the two slabs. 
The cation substitution is similar to that of anion substitution. Fig. 5 shows several pavonite compounds with N = 3 and N = 5. When the ratio of Me to Bi is equal to 1:(N + 2), such as MnBi4S7 (Me:Bi = 1:4)32 and ideal “CuBi5S8” (Me:Bi = 1:5, although “CuBi5S8” does not actually exist),31 Me mostly occupies an ideal position in the A slabs of the pavonite structure, while the B slabs are entirely composed of BiS6 octahedra. As the ratio of Me to Bi increases, Me begins to diffuse in the B slabs (MnBi2S4).49,50 From the perspective of structural chemistry, Me should follow the principle of the lowest overall structural energy when replacing Bi with octahedral coordination. Therefore, most Me tends to occupy the octahedra with the least distortion in the B slabs first. Subsequently, Me gradually mixed with all the Bi atoms in the octahedral sites in the B slabs (CdSnBi4Se8).51 When the ratio of Me to Bi further increases, such as in InSn2Bi3Se8, Me further mixes with pyramid coordinated Bi atoms located in the A slabs.52 It should be noted that Cu in the pavonite series has two distinctive atomic sites, which are in the interstitial and substitutional Cu sites.53 Therefore, the sum of cations often exceeds the estimated value, such as Cu1.57Bi4.57S854 and Cu1.75Bi4.75Se8.55

Regardless of cation or anion substitution, although the octahedra are slightly distorted in the crystal structure, the basic model will still remain. Therefore, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns are similar to each other in the pavonite homologues with the same thickness (N value).56 Nearly all of the pavonites are stable up to 800 K, such as AgBi3S5 (993 K), LiSn2Bi5S10 (936 K) and CdPbBi4Se8 (974 K).28,51,57 Based on these characteristics, the crystal structure can be extensively adjusted, making pavonite homologues a good choice for medium-temperature TE materials.
2.4 Chalcogenides with pavonite-derived crystal structures
There are many homologous structures that are strongly related to ideal pavonite homologues, such as makovickyite, and cupropavonite.58–64 Makovickyite was first reported by Mumme (1986) and Žák et al. and then it was published as a new mineral in 1994.59 The crystal structure contains the basic module of pavonite homologues, which consists of a thicker layer of octahedra with variable thickness and a thinner layer of single octahedral thickness, but the thinner layer is slightly different from the ideal layer in the pavonite homologues. The representative compound of the Makovickyite family has the chemical formula of Ag3Bi11S18, in which the two layers can be denoted as [Ag2Bi4S7]thinlayer and [Ag0.8Bi7.2S11]thicklayer.58,65Fig. 6a shows the crystal structure of the makovickyite compound Cu2.12Ag1.36Bi11.2S18 with N = 4 reported by Topa et al.60 Silver occupies octahedral sites in the thinner layer and also shares sites with Bi in the thicker layer. The Cu atoms only exist in the thinner layer and possess two different coordination environments. Some of the Cu share sites with Ag located in the centre of the octahedra, and the rest are distributed in the tetrahedral positions adjacent to the octahedra.
 Fig. 6  The crystal structure of makovickyite Cu2.12Ag1.36Bi11.2S1859 and cupropavonite Cu2AgPbBi5S10.62 They can be denoted as 4P and 5,5P respectively. 
When the thinner slabs of pavonite homologues are rich in Cu and Pb, a new mineral can be formed, named as cupropavonite.62 Compared with the parameters of the pavonite ideal structure, the a and b parameters of the cupropavonite are almost identical, while the c axis is doubled.61,66Fig. 6b shows the cupropavonite compound Cu2AgPbBi5S10. In the thinner slabs, the Bi atoms in one of the pyramids are replaced by Pb. Together with the adjacent bismuth coordination pyramid, this lead polyhedron replaces the double bismuth coordination pyramids of an ideal pavonite structure. The multiplication of the c-axis can be attributed to the asymmetry of the thinner slab. The octahedral interstices near to the Bi pyramids are occupied by two tetrahedral-coordinated Cu atoms, and silver is distributed in the octahedra of the thick slabs (B slabs). The thickness of the B slabs of cupropavonite can be the same or different. Therefore, analogous to the pavonite homologous series, these structures can be expressed as N1,N2P, where N1 and N2 represent the different thicknesses of the B slabs. For Cu2AgPbBi5S10, it can be noted as 5,5P, and for Cu8Ag3Pb4Bi19S38, it is 4,5P.62
The accretional series of pavonite homologues are similar to that of lillianite homologues which formed by reflection twinning on cell-twin units. A lillianite homologue is characterized by N1,N2L, where N1 and N2 are the octahedra numbers along the diagonal direction of the two adjacent NaCl-type slabs, and the values of N1 and N2 do not need to be equal. For pavonite homologous series, the A slab is only one octahedron width, thence one of the N values is fixed at one. Only the thicknesses of the B slabs are variable. In other words, it may hence be denoted as 1,NL in analogy with the lillianite homologues.20Table 1 lists part of the known pavonite homologues and their TE properties.

3. TE performance of the pavonite series
The pavonite homologous series is one of the most abundant minerals in nature. The excellent structural stability allows further adjustment of the layer structure, elemental substitution or doping of elements, so as to achieve more precise structure design and band gap control. Although the structural complexity and high thermal stability make it a good candidate for TE materials, its TE performance has not been extensively explored so far. Most of the reported pavonite TE materials show n-type semiconductor properties and moderate electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the high Grüneisen parameter also leads to extremely low total thermal conductivity.
3.1 Electrical transport performance
Kim et al. first reported the TE parameters of AgBi3S5 in 2004.67 The conduction band of AgBi3S5 is mainly composed of Bi-p orbitals, while the valence band is composed of Ag-d and S-p orbitals. The conductivity of AgBi3S5 is mainly achieved by electron transportation through the Bi-p orbital in the conduction band. Then in 2005, it was further proposed that the bottom of the conduction band is mainly contributed by the Bi-p orbitals in the B slabs, so most of the electron transport is limited to the B slabs. The valence band is mainly formed by the hybridization between the p states of S atoms and the d states of Ag atoms in the A slabs. Therefore, electron and hole transport should be separated in the two slabs.68 Zhang et al. synthesized a nearly single-phase AgBi3S5 sample with low thermal conductivity in 2013, but the reported ZT peak value was only 0.2 at 573 K.69 Tan et al. doped N-type semiconductor AgBi3S5 with Cl doping in 2017.70 The carrier concentration is increased by about an order of magnitude compared with the undoped sample, which greatly enhanced the conductivity. All these results indicate that aliovalent ion doping is an effective way to improve the TE performance of pavonite homologues.
For pavonite homologues with electrons as the dominant carrier, the conduction band minimum (CBM) state has a great influence on the electrical transport properties. Many pavonite homologues have small band gap, such as LiSn2Bi5S10 (0.31 eV),28 NaSn2Bi5S10 (0.07 eV),28 CdSnBi4Se8 (0.16 eV),51 CdPb2Bi4S9 (0.39 eV)44 and AgBi3S5 (0.17 eV).68 The conduction band bottoms consist mainly of Bi 6p and S 3P (Se 4p) states and the valence bands are mainly contributed by Me and S atoms. As mentioned above, the CBM of AgBi3S5 is mainly contributed by Bi 6p states, which is also a common feature for Bi-containing pavonites. Khoury et al. found that in several alkali metal-containing compounds A1+xSn2−xBi5+xS10 (A+ = Li+, Na+), the highest occupied orbitals of alkali metal are not enough to contribute to the band edge, and thus have little effect on the density of states.28 Optimizing the electronic energy band structure is an effective way to improve the power factor of pavonite homologues. By simply adjusting the element ratio and element doping, the band gap value and the degeneracy of the energy band can be adjusted to optimize the Fermi energy, thereby improving the TE performances of the materials. Kim et al. studied the Cu–Bi–Ch (Ch = S or Se) series of compounds and found that increasing the proportion of Cu in CuBi5Se8 can increase the band gap.55 In addition, the insertion of interstitial copper atoms also reduces the difference between CBM and 2nd-CBM, thereby increasing the degeneracy of CBM. The interstitial Cu sites along the b-axis provide additional electrons and effective conduction paths, and increase the band-edge state density, ultimately achieving simultaneous increase of σ and S.53,71–74 Due to the anisotropic crystal structure of pavonites, the electrical conductivities of the sample are different in the measured directions parallel or perpendicular to the sintering pressure. The Seebeck coefficients are approximately not affected by the measurement direction. Fig. 7 shows the electrical transport properties of several pavonites, in which all compounds have negative S values, showing n-type semiconductor behavior. The power factor of Cl-doped AgBi3S5 reaches a maximum value of about 7 μW cm−1 K−2 at 800 K, and that of undoped CdAg2Bi6Se11 is about 5.3 μW cm−1 K−2 at 825 K. Obviously, the TE powers of pavonites reported so far are still lower than that of the state-of-the-art TE materials.75,76

Negative Seebeck coefficients exhibit n-type semiconductor behavior and the maximum power factor is below 10 μW cm−1 K−2. 
3.2 Thermal conductivity performance
The total thermal conductivity of a material can be divided into two parts: lattice thermal conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity. According to Wiedemann–Franz law and Boltzmann theory, the thermal conductivity of the lattice is only influenced by the thermal vibration of the atoms at the equilibrium position, so it is independent of the electrical conductivity. Therefore, searching for materials with low lattice thermal conductivity and reducing the contribution of electronic thermal conductivity is essential for exploring high ZT values. Fig. 8a and b show the total thermal conductivity of several pavonites. The thermal conductivities of pavonites are comparable to or even lower than that of many of the most advanced TE materials, such as GeTe–Bi2Te3,77 Bi0.925Sr0.075CuSeO78 and Cu2Se.9 The low thermal conductivities are caused by a combination of many factors. Generally speaking, complex pavonite compounds are composed of heavy atoms, which makes the thermal vibration of atoms weaker than light atoms at high temperature. Since the room temperature electrical conductivities of undoped pavonites are usually low (<300 S cm−1), the electronic thermal conductivity's contribution to the total thermal conductivity can be neglected.
 Fig. 8  The thermal properties and ZT values of several pavonite homologues: (a) total thermal conductivity and (b) lattice thermal conductivity. The total thermal conductivities are lower than 1 W m−1 K−1 and the lattice thermal conductivities are approximately independent of temperature, and thus high ZT values are obtained (Data reproduced from ref. 9, 44, 51, 69, 70, 74 and 78). (c) The phonon dispersion of AgBi3S5.70 The presence of low-frequency phonon patterns at Z and X indicates low phonon velocity. The large average Grüneisen parameter (γ = 2.96, γ = 4.12, and γ = 3.59) indicates strong anharmonicity (e), which leads to low lattice thermal conductivity (d). The phonon density of states shows that there are two peaks from Ag and Bi in the low frequency range (f). Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. 
The lattice thermal conductivity can be described as: (5)where M is the average mass, γ is the Grüneisen parameter, V is the average volume occupied by one atom, and θD is the Debye temperature. Especially for structures with higher N values, the unit cell contains more heavy atoms, which theoretically means lower thermal conductivity, such as CdPb2Bi4S9 (N = 4) and CdAg2Bi6Se11 (N = 6).44 Of course, this is not absolute. Thermal conductivity is also affected by other factors such as defect scattering and anharmonic vibration. Usually pavonite homologues have a larger Grüneisen parameter, which means stronger anharmonicity and phonon scattering, thereby reducing thermal conductivity.44,51,70 Labégorre et al. reported that the large Grüneisen parameter of MnBi4S7/FeBi4S7 was partly derived from lone pair electrons of Bi3+. There were two kinds of Bi atoms occupying different coordination environments of MnBi4S7/FeBi4S7, resulting in different distorted polyhedrons, which led to greater anharmonicity.79 This situation may also apply to all Bi-containing pavonites due to the existence of more than two different distortion polyhedra in all structural modules. Fig. 8c–f show the phonon calculation results of AgBi3S5.70 The large average Grüneisen parameter results in low thermal conductivity. CdSnBi4Se8 is similar to AgBi3S5. The projected phonon density of states of CdSnBi4Se8 shows that the low frequency mode is mainly contributed by the heavier Bi atomic vibration. The average Grüneisen parameters are γTA = 1.82, γTA′ = 2.1, and γLA = 1.45, respectively, and a small lattice thermal conductivity is calculated. In addition, the lower sound velocity further promotes the reduction of thermal conductivity. It was reported that the average sound velocities of CdPb2Bi4S9 TA, TA′, and LA modes were 1457, 1714, and 2925 m s−1, and for CdAg2Bi6Se11 they were 1284, 1545, and 2654 m s−1, respectively.44 Labégorre et al. reported that the average sound velocities of MnBi4S7 and FeBi4S7 were 1767 and 1967 m s−1,79 which were lower than BiCuOS (2126 m s−1).80
Apart from the low crystal symmetry, the disordered occupancy of atoms in pavonite homologues also enhances the point defect scattering of phonons. The mass and volume fluctuations caused by mixed distribution of atoms effectively increase the anharmonic scattering of low-frequency phonons, thereby reducing the free path of phonons. In summary, element doping is an effective means to optimize thermal conductivity. Hwang et al. synthesized Cu1.595Zn0.025Bi4.61S8, and its lattice thermal conductivity reduced 29% at 662 K compared with undoped Cu1.62Bi4.61S8.74 The reported thermal conductivities of pavonite homologues demonstrate weak temperature dependence, which may be related to the short average phonon free path inside the crystal lattice and the statistically disordered distribution of atomic positions.53
3.3 Overall TE performance
Although the TE power factors of pavonite homologues are not excellent, considering the extremely low thermal conductivity, a high ZT value can still be achieved. The ZT values of some pavonite homologues are shown in Fig. 9. It is worth noting that most compounds are in an undoped state. Among them, we reported that the maximum ZT value obtained in CdAg2Bi6Se11 reached 0.95,44 which was higher than that of Sr-doped Bi0.925Sr0.075CuSeO (0.76 at 873 K),78 and was comparable to filled skutterudite LaFe3CoSb12 (near 1 at 800 K).81

Due to the inherently adjustable structural modules and the complex structures mainly composed of heavy atoms, the pavonite homologues are good choices for TE materials. According to the general formula, a large number of pavonites have not yet been discovered. In a nutshell, the pavonite homologues can become a favorable competitor for the development and design of n-type TE materials, due to the following reasons: (1) the majority carriers of most pavonite homologues are electrons. (2) The compound has low total thermal conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity with low temperature dependence. (3) Adjustable layer structure allows more intentional design of pavonite's TE performance. (4) The stable structure allows for easier fine-tuning of the band structure and thermal conductivity by doping or substituting atoms. (5) Although not perfect, it can be seen that when elements replace anions and cations in the original structure, certain rules will be followed, which means that the structure can be adjusted more precisely. Furthermore, it should be noted that the undoped compounds such as CdAg2Bi6Se11 have reached a high ZT value close to 1, which means that more new pavonite homologues and optimization of the structure can be developed to achieve better TE performance.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, the fascinating structure of pavonite homologues enriches materials chemistry. Their diverse structures stem from the variability of its constituent modules. On the one hand, the galena slabs with variable thickness makes the unit cell volume and unit cell atomic number increase or decrease regularly. On the other hand, the excellent structural stability realizes the mixed distribution of multiple atoms. The combination of these two aspects greatly affects the energy band structure, thus providing a route for band gap regulation and homologous compound design. Since the compounds are usually composed of heavy atoms, a large unit cell mass can scatter phonons more effectively. Furthermore, the thermal conductivities are also affected by the large Grüneisen parameter, low sound velocity, low Debye temperature, and mixed occupancy of constituent atoms.
TE materials have developed rapidly in recent years. However, most excellent TE materials are p-type semiconductors, while good n-type TE materials are still rare. Designing new types of pavonite homologues is very desirable but challenging, because it is difficult to accurately predict the exact position of all replacement atoms, which requires a lot of experimental verification. The mechanism of anion and cation substitution also needs further research. Although the thermal conductivity is comparable with the state-of-the-art TE materials, the low TE power factor is still a concern. How to increase the carrier concentration and density of states through a variety of methods to optimize the power factor such as modulation doping or band convergence while still maintaining low thermal conductivity is the key to improving the TE performance of the pavonite series. In addition, the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the pavonite pellet samples obtained by spark plasma sintering exhibit anisotropy in different measurement directions, which undoubtedly requires more consideration in device development. With the in-depth understanding of the transport mechanism and the development of more advanced technologies, it is possible to realize TE devices made of pavonite homologues.

 	Fig. 1  (a) The Seebeck effect for TE generator. The p-type and n-type semiconductors in the thermocouple form a circuit. Maintaining the temperature difference across the thermocouple, charge carriers (holes and electrons) will flow from the hot side to the cold side, establishing an electric field between the two junctions. (b) The Peltier effect for TE cooler. When a current is applied in the direction shown, the two charge carriers in the thermocouple can absorb heat from the cold end and then release it to the hot end to form a cooling effect. (c) Comparison of the efficiency of conventional engines and TE generators. (Data reproduced from ref. 2 and 5).

 	Fig. 7  The electrical transport properties of AgBi3S5,69 AgBi3(S0.9967Cl0.0033)5,70 Cu1.61Bi4.81S8,74 CdAg2Bi6Se11,44 and CdPbBi4Se8:51 (a) electronic conductivity, (b) Seebeck coefficient, and (c) power factor. Negative Seebeck coefficients exhibit n-type semiconductor behavior and the maximum power factor is below 10 μW cm−1 K−2.	 

 	Fig. 8  The thermal properties and ZT values of several pavonite homologues: (a) total thermal conductivity and (b) lattice thermal conductivity. The total thermal conductivities are lower than 1 W m−1 K−1 and the lattice thermal conductivities are approximately independent of temperature, and thus high ZT values are obtained (Data reproduced from ref. 9, 44, 51, 69, 70, 74 and 78). (c) The phonon dispersion of AgBi3S5.70 The presence of low-frequency phonon patterns at Z and X indicates low phonon velocity. The large average Grüneisen parameter (γ = 2.96, γ = 4.12, and γ = 3.59) indicates strong anharmonicity (e), which leads to low lattice thermal conductivity (d). The phonon density of states shows that there are two peaks from Ag and Bi in the low frequency range (f). Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society.
