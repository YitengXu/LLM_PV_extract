    , Accepted 20th May 2020First published on 20th May 2020AbstractStoring solar energy using a stable visible light absorbing Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite is achieved using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) device with cobalt complexes and methyl viologen redox mediators. Under illumination, a potential gain of nearly 500 mV is achieved for charging. The charge–discharge cycling was carried out, and using in situ emission and FTIR studies, the self-discharge and solvent crossover were investigated.
Solar energy storage is essential to ensure constant power output, which otherwise cannot be achieved with solar cells due to the diurnal variation of sunlight. Conventionally, the solar energy conversion to electricity is achieved using photovoltaic (PV) devices, and the storage is done in batteries.1 However, the use of two separate systems for conversion and storage increases the overall system cost. It would be ideal to have a single system that does both conversion and storage of light into electricity. Photoelectrochemical devices are excellent choices for storing solar energy directly in the form of chemical bonds or in redox mediators. Examples of the former include water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction.2–4 The storage of electrical energy in the redox mediators has been well explored in the redox flow battery (RFB) domain.5 Vanadium based redox mediators in a highly acidic medium are predominantly used in the RFBs, where most of the well-known photoabsorbing semiconductors are not stable.6–15 To utilize the well-established redox shuttles from RFBs for direct solar energy storage, semiconductors with protective oxide layers that restrict the intimate contact of the absorber with electrolyte were explored.6–8,10–13 A typical device consists of positive and negative electrode compartments separated by an ion-conducting membrane. The photoabsorber is most often located in the positive compartment. Cadmium sulfide,6 doped indium phosphides,8 InGaP/GaAs tandem cells,7 and doped silicon,11 protected with titanium dioxide layer, were successfully used to inject photogenerated carriers into redox mediators. Oxide-based absorbers were also employed, although not efficient in photoconversion, they do not require any protection layer due to their intrinsic stability.13,14,16 Since many of the best semiconducting photoabsorbers are not stable in aqueous electrolytes and/or wherever the protection layers are not deemed suitable, redox mediators in organic solvents were used.17–20 In a recent report, dye-sensitized titanium dioxide was used along with iodide–triiodide and ethyl viologen redox couples in an organic solvent.19 In some cases, a combination of solvents was used as the electrolyte in positive and negative compartments, either with both organic or organic and aqueous solvents.20
Solar assisted charging has also been implemented where the charging potential of the redox couples is higher than the potential generated by the photoabsorber.12,17,18,21 Dye-sensitized TiO2 was used as an absorber with a Li–iodine flow battery setup where 20% of potential savings is achieved with light. A similar absorber coupled to a Li–O2 battery reduced the charging potential from 3.4 V to 2.8 V, leaving a potential gain of 0.6 V.21 In most of the cases mentioned above, charging is achieved using dye-sensitized electrodes, titanium dioxide/iron oxide absorbers, or expensive tandem compound semiconductors. However, integrating the best performing solar cell absorber materials from the PV domain, with the well-established redox mediators of flow battery systems, would be a great choice. In the recent past, the halide perovskites have been showing an extremely high solar conversion efficiency reaching over 20%, which is significantly higher among the state-of-the-art single-junction solar cells.22–24 So, it would be ideal to implement these materials in solar-assisted/unassisted charging where the energy shall be stored in redox mediators. However, since the halide perovskites are not stable in water, no direct extrapolation of the existing aqueous redox-based solar energy storage PEC systems can be done.25 So, the key lies in finding the right set of redox couples that can be used along with organic solvents.26 In this work, we identified a set of redox couples, a cobalt tris(bipyridine) complex (Co2+/Co3+) and methyl viologen (MV2+/MV+), with suitable solvents which are stable with Cs2AgBiBr6 halide double perovskite and successfully demonstrated the light assisted solar energy storage. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ photoluminescence studies, the charging properties were probed.

Fig. 1(a) shows the conduction and valence band positions of various halide perovskites and electrochemical potentials of well-known redox couples investigated in redox flow batteries or dye-sensitized solar cells.5,27–34 The basic requirement for the solar energy storage device is that the absorber's conduction band should be positioned higher than the electron acceptor redox level, and the valence band should be placed lower than the donor level. Almost all the visible light-absorbing semiconductors do not possess valence band edges lower than well-known Ce3+/Ce4+, so essentially, this redox mediator cannot be used. Since I−/I3− and Co2+/Co3+ possess redox levels near the valence bands of most of the absorbers, they shall be used as donors. All the other four redox couples, from V2+/V3+, shall be considered as acceptors. The iodide/triiodide redox mediator is corrosive, and hence we have chosen to use cobaltII/IIItris(bipyridine) redox shuttles as a donor. It has to be noted that the latter has been well explored in the dye-sensitized solar cells.34 Amongst the electron acceptor systems, MV+(PF6)−/MV2+(PF6)2− is compatible with organic solvents, and since it possesses higher redox potential, the attainable photovoltage shall be high. So in this work, considering the compatibility of the redox mediators with perovskites and the attainable photopotential, we have selected MV+/MV2+ and Co2+/Co3+ as an electron acceptor and donor, respectively. It would be ideal to use the best performing CH3NH3PbI3 for solar rechargeable batteries. However, the decomposition of this material under ambient conditions prevented us from employing it in this PEC device. The decomposition product PbI2 is insulating and it is expected to hamper the charge transfer to the redox mediator. So, in search of an alternate material, we found Cs2AgBiBr6 to be suitable because of its appropriate band alignment, visible light-absorbing properties, long excited-state lifetime, and stability under ambient conditions.27 The overpotential for charge injection to the redox mediator is also higher for Cs2AgBiBr6, compared to CH3NH3PbI3. Being zeroed in on with the absorber, and redox mediators, the next step of device design is to identify the solvents. We have screened several solvents, including water, ethanol, acetonitrile (ACN), 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE), dichloromethane, and toluene. However, Cs2AgBiBr6 is found to be stable only in halogenated solvents, so in this study, we have used this high boiling tetrachloroethane along with 10% (v/v) of acetonitrile (to solubilize Co3+) for the Co2+/Co3+ redox mediator. Pure acetonitrile, on the other hand, degrades the absorber. Dichloromethane is another halogenated solvent option, but the membrane used to separate the positive and negative compartments swells immediately and the evaporation of solvent due to its low boiling point makes it difficult to make reproducible devices.26 MV(PF6)2 is not soluble in TCE, so in the second compartment, pure acetonitrile was employed as the solvent. A detailed compatibility/solubility table (Table S1, ESI†) for various components of the PEC device is given in the ESI.†
The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of MV+/MV2+ and Co2+/Co3+ were recorded in ACN and TCE/ACN (90/10 v/v), respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†) and their redox potentials are found to be −4.2 eV and −5.17 eV (vs. vacuum), respectively. The difference between the two redox levels, 0.97 V (E(MV+/MV2+)–E(Co2+/Co3+)), is the theoretical potential required to carry out redox reactions. With these energy levels, the band diagram of a complete PEC solar energy storage device is constructed (Fig. 1(b)). Upon illumination, an electron from the valence band of Cs2AgBiBr6 is excited to its conduction band. The electrons are then injected into TiO2, and the holes are pumped into Co2+, where it gets converted to Co3+. The electrons in the conduction band of titanium dioxide move to the second electrode via the external circuit to reduce MV2+ to MV+ in the negative compartment. In order to balance the ionic charges, PF6− counter ions migrate from methyl viologen to the cobalt compartment. The discharge is achieved between two platinum-coated FTO electrodes, which is present beneath the charging PEC cell.

Co2+/Co3+ here represents cobalt(II)(bipyridine)3(TFSI)2 and Co(III)(bipyridine)3(TFSI)3 salts. The separator used here is the DSV anion-exchange membrane from Selemion, Japan. 
The device block diagram is given in Fig. 1(c), which contains top charging and bottom discharging electrodes. The X-ray diffraction pattern, absorption properties, and the optimization of deposition conditions of Cs2AgBiBr6 for best photovoltaic performance are explained in the ESI† text and Fig. S2–S8 (ESI†). With the device shown in Fig. 1(c), the charging of the device both in the dark and under light was carried out. At a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, the charging voltage in the dark is found to be around 1.8 V, and it is higher than expected 0.97 V (E(MV+/MV2+)–E(Co2+/Co3+)) which shall be due to higher overpotential required for the conversion of Co2+ to Co3+ and MV2+ to MV+ or the resistance of ion transfer across the membrane. Upon shining light, the voltage required for charging reduced to ∼1.6 V, giving a potential gain of 200 mV (Fig. 2(a)). In order to rule out photocorrosion, chopped light measurements were carried out at various charging currents: 5 μA, 10 μA, and 100 μA (Fig. 2(b)). At 100 μA, the potential required for charging is found to be ∼1.65 V, and upon illumination, a gain of ∼65 mV is achieved. When the charging current is decreased to 10 μA and 5 μA, photopotential gains of 490 mV and 320 mV, respectively, were obtained. The photopotential remained fairly constant within a given charging current, and this rules out the current generation due to photocorrosion. One has to note that in the chopped light measurements at 100 μA, photopotential developed is only 65 mV, whereas, under constant illumination, the gain is nearly 200 mV. This difference may be due to the non-equilibrium conditions induced to the device by turning the illumination on and off in the chopped measurements. In addition, the variation in the photogenerated voltage at various current values may have their origin in the difference in the recombination rates at various charge densities.35

Although a gain in the charging potential is achieved in the PEC energy storage device, it is worthwhile investigating the maximum possible potential that can be generated by the absorber. To study this, photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the same architecture as given in Fig. 1(b) but without the membrane and the MV+/MV2+ compartment. Fig. 2(c) shows the current–voltage curve in the dark and under AM1.5G illumination conditions. The device generated an open-circuit potential (at zero current) of around 700 mV and ∼675 mV at 10 μA. In the PEC device, at the same current, that is at 10 μA, ∼490 mV photopotential is achieved, which is less than the maximum possible voltage of 675 mV. This difference shall be attributed to the resistance of ion transfer through the membrane and the kinetics of redox reactions. To understand the charge–discharge measurements, we have fabricated symmetric cells with Pt coated FTO electrodes without titanium dioxide and the perovskite absorber. The charge–discharge curves are shown in Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S9 (ESI†). The voltage required for charging the device is between 1.1 V and 1.5 V, whereas the discharge voltage lies between 0.9 V and 0.7 V.
One can notice that the capacity fades during charging cycles, whereas the discharge capacity remains fairly constant. During the first cycle of charging, the capacity of the device was ∼11.2 mA h gmethyl-viologen−1, whereas, during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cycles, the values reduced to 4.6, 3.2, and 2.5 mA h g−1 respectively. Additionally, the discharge capacity during all the cycles was around 0.25 mA h g−1. Note that the theoretical specific capacity of MV(PF6)2 is 56.28 mA h g−1. In order to understand the difference in capacity between charging and discharging cycles, and to investigate the decrease in the capacity during charging, photoluminescence studies were carried to probe the concentration of MV2+. The methyl viologen in its 2+ state, which shows fluorescence between 460 nm and 650 nm (Fig. 3(a)).36 Upon charging MV2+ reduced to MV+ and the emission is quenched. From the area under the curve, we noticed that only 43% of MV2+ was reduced. This result shows that complete charging is not achieved within the cut-off voltage of 1.3 V. In situ emission decay is monitored at 526 nm (Fig. 3(b)) while the device is being charged. Upon the application of voltage, the emission intensity continuously drops, indicating the reduction of MV2+ to MV+, but upon leaving the device at open-circuit, the emission is quickly regained, back to its original value. The singly charged MV cation is actually a radical which can be oxidized by atmospheric oxygen (Fig. S10, ESI†). Although the PEC energy storage device is tightly packed, the presence of residual oxygen may be the source of MV+ oxidation back to MV2+. This oxygen-induced self-discharge process can explain the significant loss in capacity between charge and discharge cycles in the PEC energy storage devices (Fig. 2(a)).
 Fig. 3  (a) Emission spectra of the initial cell and charged cell measured at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm, (b) in situ photoluminescence measurement of the cell to monitor self-discharge due to O2 ingression after charging, monitored by using the emission of MV2+ as a probe at 526 nm with light excitation at 440 nm and (c) FTIR spectra of fresh electrolyte and electrolyte collected after three charge–discharge cycles in compartments (1) and (2). 
FT-infrared measurements were done for the fresh electrolyte (in both positive and negative compartments) and after three cycles (Fig. 3(c)). In the second compartment, after three cycles, we observed a new set of vibrational peaks that correspond to the C–H bending (790 cm−1) and C–Cl stretch (735 cm−1 and, 715 cm−1) and in the first compartment, we observed a strong –CN stretch at 2250 cm−1.37 The solvent spectra are also given in Fig. 3(c) for reference. The appearance of new peaks after three cycles indicates the solvent crossover between compartments, that is, the TCE diffused into the methyl viologen compartment and acetonitrile diffused to the cobalt compartment. As methyl viologen is not soluble in TCE, the ingression of TCE to the second compartment precipitates out the redox mediator leaving it unusable for energy storage. The perovskite material is not stable in acetonitrile and so the ingression of this solvent from compartment 2 to 1 also can affect the stability. The second and subsequent charge–discharge cycles of the PEC device (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†) show less than 50 mV gain, compared to 200 mV in the first cycle. It has to be noted that the photovoltaic data in Fig. S4 (ESI†) show over twenty hours of device stability, with TCE/ACN. So the deterioration in PEC energy storage device performance shall be attributed to the solvent crossover that led to the precipitation of methyl viologen by TCE and the degradation of the absorber by ACN. The in situ emission decay and FTIR studies indicate the oxygen-induced self-discharge, and the crossover of the solvent resulted in the capacity fade between different charging cycles, and it also explains the difference in the capacities between charging and discharging. Apart from the aforementioned issues, some changes in the Cs2AgBiBr6 film morphology was observed after cycling. The film prior to device making shows uniform deposition of perovskite, however after a cycle, some crystals were observed. With the help of EDX mapping, we found that these crystals correspond to AgBr. It has to be noted that the segregation of AgBr may also be affecting the device performance in the long run (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).
Overall in this work, we have successfully employed the halide double perovskite material to store solar energy in the redox systems, which is inspired from both the dye-sensitized solar cells and redox flow batteries.
