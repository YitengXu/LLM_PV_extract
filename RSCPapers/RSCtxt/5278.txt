    , Accepted 16th October 2014First published on 17th October 2014AbstractPorous carbon nitride nanosheets (PCNs) have been prepared for the first time by a simple liquid exfoliation method via probe sonication. These mesoporous nanosheets of around 5 nm in thickness combine several advantages including high surface area, enhanced light absorption and excellent water dispersity. It can be used as a versatile support for co-catalyst loading for photocatalytic dye degradation and water reduction. With 3.8 wt% Co3O4 loaded, PCNs can achieve more efficient photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B, compared with non-porous C3N4 nanosheets (CNs), bulk porous C3N4 (PCN) and bulk nonporous C3N4 (CN). With 1.0 wt% Pt loaded, CNs and PCN exhibit 7–8 times enhancement in H2 evolution than CN. Remarkably, PCNs with both porous and nanosheet-like features achieve 26 times higher activity in H2 evolution than CN. These significant improvements in photocatalytic activities can be attributed to the high surface area as well as better electron mobility of the two-dimensional nanostructure.
1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a few atomic layers have received increasing interest due to their superior properties for various applications.1–5 Since the discovery of graphene,6 other 2D materials, such as nanosheets of MoS2,7 WS2,8 other transition metal dichalcogenide,4 covalent framework (COF) etc.,9 have also been fabricated via delamination of their bulk materials. In particular for solar energy conversion and environmental applications, 2D materials have the advantages of higher surface area, improved charge transport ability and more exposed active sites.4,10–13 For example, monolayered WS2 nanosheets can be obtained from chemical exfoliation of bulk WS2 and display more efficient H2 evolution activity due to more abundant active sites on the nanosheets.4 In another work, 2D titania nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 20 nm were fabricated and hybridized with CdS nanoparticles.13 These 2D hetero-structures have large surface areas and abundant coupling interfaces which manifest superior migration of photoexcited charges and excellent H2 production.13
Recently, polymeric-like carbon nitride (C3N4) was reported for photocatalytic water reduction and oxidation,14–18 degradation of pollutants16,19 and carbon dioxide reduction.20–23 C3N4 nanosheets have been prepared through thermal treatment10 or liquid exfoliation methods,24 and studied in diverse applications such as bioimaging,24 water reduction,10–12,25 dye degradation,12,24 Cu2+ detection,26,27 nanosensors for glucose detection,28,29 and oxygen reduction reaction.30,31 Graphene-like C3N4 nanosheets were obtained from thermal oxidation of bulk C3N4 with improved photocatalytic activities of ˙OH radical generation and H2 evolution.10 From pyrolysis of urea as reported in our previous work, 2D C3N4 nanosheets with a high surface area can be obtained and used for improved dye-sensitized H2 evolution.25 Besides the thermal process, liquid exfoliation is another facile method to prepare C3N4 nanosheets. Bulk C3N4 samples obtained directly from the calcination of precursors like melamine, dicyanamide etc. were treated by ultrasonication to obtain exfoliated C3N4 nanosheets.11,24 The reported yield of C3N4 nanosheets from the liquid exfoliation method is typically lower than 15%27,32 and the resulting C3N4 nanosheets are non-porous. On the other hand, porous (microporous, mesoporous or macroporous) C3N4 materials have shown improved performances for water reduction or dye degradation due to enhanced light absorption and more efficient charge transfer.15,17,33–35 For example in our earlier studies, mesoporous C3N4 with in situ sulfur doping was synthesized from pyrolysis of thiourea using SiO2 as the template and showed a high quantum efficiency of 5.8% (at 440 nm) for H2 evolution.17 Mesoporous C3N4 after loading of NiS was also found active for H2 evolution without the use of noble metal co-catalysts.34 Three-dimensional macroporous C3N4 was fabricated by Jun et al. through calcination of melamine-cyanuric acid or melamine-trithiocyanuric acid complex, which showed enhanced activity for H2 evolution.35 To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on exfoliation of porous C3N4. It is anticipated that the combination of porous and the nanosheet-like structure in C3N4 can lead to a higher surface area for co-catalyst loading, dye molecule adsorption and improved electron mobility. Hence, more efficient photocatalytic activities can be expected.
Herein, we report the preparation of porous C3N4 nanosheets via a simple liquid exfoliation method by probe sonication. The obtained porous C3N4 nanosheets were further loaded with transition metal oxides for photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Pt for water reduction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of porous carbon nitride nanosheets
Mesoporous C3N4 (PCN) and non-porous C3N4 (CN) were prepared using similar methods as in our previous report.17 Briefly, cyanamide was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to obtain CN. The crucible with a lid was used to maintain the calcination process in static air. To prepare PCN, cyanamide mixed with SiO2 (Ludox® HS40, Aldrich, diameter: 12 nm, 40 wt%, mass ratio of cyanamide: SiO2 = 1:1) was first calcined under the same conditions. SiO2 was removed by etching with hydrofluoric acid solution (HF, 5 wt%, 40 mL, Alfa Aesar; CAUTION: HF is highly toxic and should be used with extreme care!) for 24 h followed by centrifugation and washing for several times. Non-porous C3N4 nanosheets (CNs) and mesoporous C3N4 nanosheets (PCNs) were obtained by dispersing 50 mg of CN or PCN in 50 mL of ethanol, followed by ultrasonication for 2 h using a 750 W Sonics Vibra-cell at 90% amplitude (model VCX 750, Sonics & Materials, Inc., USA). Other solvents including water, methanol, 1-isopropanol, dimethylformamide, acetone, acetonitrile and 1,4-dioxane were also tested to disperse CN before ultrasonication. It was found that the effect of solvent for dispersion is in the order of: ethanol > methanol, water > isopropanol ≫ others. Therefore, ethanol was used in all studies in this work. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min to remove un-exfoliated C3N4. The top suspension was separated from the precipitated solids and then centrifuged at 20000 rpm for 5 min. The collected solid was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for characterization and loading of metal oxide co-catalysts. The suspension obtained after centrifugation at 6000 rpm was used directly for Pt loading for H2 evolution. The yield of carbon nitride nanosheets was calculated by dividing the weight of the obtained nanosheets by the initial weight of carbon nitride.
2.2. Loading of metal oxides as co-catalysts
Different transition metal oxides including Co3O4, Fe3O4, NiO and CuO were investigated as co-catalysts for degradation of organic dye. Co3O4 and Fe3O4 were first prepared according to the previous reports.36,37 To prepare Co3O4, colbalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(Ac)2·4H2O, 0.5 g) was dissolved in a mixture of 2 mL of H2O and 23 mL of ethanol at 45 °C. Ammonium solution (NH3·H2O, 28–30%, 2.5 mL) was dropwise added into the above solution under vigorous stirring. The temperature was increased to 80 °C and held for 3 h. The obtained dark suspension was washed with acetone to precipitate the solid. The precipitated Co3O4 was re-dispersed in 20 mL of methanol. To prepare Fe3O4, iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 8.74 mmol) and iron(II) chloride (FeCl2·xH2O, 4.37 mmol) were mixed in 40 mL of H2O. The solution was heated to 80 °C with N2 purging and ammonium solution (NH3·H2O, 28–30%, 5 mL) was dropwise added into the above solution under vigorous stirring. After 30 min, the obtained dark solution was washed with deionized H2O and re-dispersed in 100 mL of deionized H2O.
To load Co3O4 on PCNs, different volumes (0, 46, 93, 185, 278, 370, 556 μL) of Co3O4 suspension (2.1 mg Co3O4 per mL methanol) were added into 20 mg PCNs dispersed in 1 mL of methanol. After ultrasonication for 10 min followed by drying at 60 °C to remove methanol, the obtained Co3O4/PCNs were calcined in air at 350 °C for 2 h to promote the interaction between Co3O4 and PCNs. The same loading method was applied to deposit Co3O4 on other carbon nitride samples. Fe3O4 was loaded on PCNs by the same method. To load NiO and CuO, nickel(II) nitrate or copper(II) nitrate was added into 20 mg PCNs in 1 mL of H2O, respectively. After ultrasonication for 10 min and drying at 60 °C to remove H2O, the precursor was calcined at 350 °C for 2 h to form NiO and CuO loaded PCNs.
2.3. Characterizations
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D2 diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å, 30 kV and 10 mA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on a Digilab FTS 3100 FTIR in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 using a standard KBr disk technique. The morphology of samples was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM 6701F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out using a MFP3D microscope (Asylum Research) with a silicon cantilever operating in tapping mode. The surface area was determined from the adsorption isotherm of nitrogen at −196 °C on a Quantachrome Autosorb-6B apparatus using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The desorption isotherms were used to determine the pore size distribution using the Barret–Joyner–Halender (BJH) method. The concentration of Co3O4 and Fe3O4 suspension and the loading percentage of Co3O4 in Co3O4/PCNs were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on a Perkin Elmer ICP Optima 2000DV. The UV-vis diffusion reflectance spectra (DRS) were collected on a UV-vis spectroscope (UV2450, Shimadzu) using BaSO4 as the reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected on a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) at room temperature with the excitation wavelength of 333 nm and the excitation/emission slit widths both of 5.0 nm. The samples dispersed in water with a concentration of 0.01 mg mL−1 were used for analysis.
2.4. Photocatalytic activity evaluation
For degradation of the dye, 5 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of Rhodamine B solution (10 mg L−1 RhB). After ultrasonication for 10 min, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 2 h to reach the adsorption equilibrium prior to photocatalytic reaction. H2O2 was added in the suspension (0.01 M) before turning on the light. A 300 W Xe lamp (Newport) without a filter was used as the light source. At different time intervals, 1 mL of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged at 13000 rpm to remove the catalyst. The supernatant after centrifugation was diluted two times with H2O. The concentration of RhB was determined using a UV-vis spectroscope (UV2450, Shimadzu). The photocatalytic H2 reaction was carried out in a closed circulation system using a Pyrex cell (a total volume of about 300 mL with a top irradiation area of around 28 cm2). In each run, a certain volume of the suspension (for example, 35 mL of 0.134 mg mL−1 PCNs in ethanol) was added with 65 mL of triethanolamine (TEOA) aqueous solution (15 vol%, pH = 8.5). H2PtCl6·xH2O (50 μL, 1 mg mL−1 Pt) was added to the above suspension for in situ loading of 1 wt% Pt by photoreduction. A 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter (Newport) was used as the visible light source. The reaction cell was kept at room temperature with jacketed circulation of cooling water. The amount of evolved H2 was determined using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N, Argon as carrier gas, 5 Å molecular sieve column, TCD detector).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows the XRD patterns of CN, CNs, PCN and PCNs. The intensities of both the interlayer-stacking (002) peak and the in-planar peak at 13.3° are greatly reduced after exfoliation of CN and PCN, and the extent of reduction is more severe in the case of PCNs. These results suggest the successful delamination of the bulk CN and PCN.24 On the other hand, there is no obvious change found in FTIR spectra (Fig. 1B), indicating that the functional groups of PCNs and CNs after exfoliation are essentially retained. Both UV-vis DRS and PL spectra reveal a slight blue shift of PCNs and CNs compared with their bulk counterparts, respectively (Fig. 2). The blue shift could be due to the quantum confinement effect, which was also shown in previous reports.10,24 As expected, the porous carbon nitride samples (PCN and PCNs) display enhanced light absorbance in the visible light range compared to nonporous samples (CN and CNs) due to the scattering sites of pore walls (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, it is found that the PL intensities of porous samples are remarkably suppressed compared to those of nonporous carbon nitride samples (Fig. 2B). This could be attributed to the presence of more abundant surface defect sites that quench the luminescence.17 The defect sites were most likely created during the post-treatment by HF acid for removal of the SiO2 template. In our recent study, it was found that the surface defects of metal oxides can enhance the charge separation and promote the photocatalytic activity when the charge carriers can be efficiently utilized by the co-catalysts.38Fig. 2B also shows that the PL intensities of exfoliated samples are greater than those of the bulk samples, especially for CNs. This may be contributed by a better dispersion of the exfoliated samples in water during PL measurement.

The SEM image in Fig. 3A shows that the particle sizes of PCNs are smaller compared to those of the original PCN (Fig. S1†). The TEM image in Fig. 3B indicates that PCNs retain the sheet-like and mesoporous structure despite the reduction in particle size. As shown in Fig. 3C, the average thickness of PCNs is around 5 nm, which corresponds to about 14 C–N layers. It is to be noted that this thickness could be overestimated for irregularly shaped particles like PCNs without a large aspect ratio and a flat lying surface. A similar morphological change can be found for CNs. The size of the obtained CNs after ultrasonication is decreased roughly to 100–200 nm (Fig. S2B and S2D†) from the aggregates of several micrometers of CN (Fig. S2A†). AFM images in Fig. S2C and S2D† show that the typical thickness of CNs is around 2–3 nm, corresponding to 5–8 C–N layers. This is similar to those reported in the literature (1.65–2.62 nm,10 2 nm,11 2.5 nm24). Though the same exfoliation conditions were applied to CN and PCN, the thickness of PCNs is roughly twice of that of CNs. Based on TEM observation (Fig. 3B), the domain size (i.e., the wall thickness) of PCNs is limited to around 20 nm. It may be challenging for such a small lateral size to induce sufficient interaction between the sample and the solvent for effective exfoliation. On the other hand, the obtained yield of PCNs is 25.8% which is much higher than that of CNs in this work (3.5%) and those in the literature (up to 14.5%).27,32 This can be well explained by the effect of overall particle size reduction of PCNs which makes the particles better dispersed after ultrasonic treatment. As expected, the samples exhibit larger surface areas after exfoliation. The specific surface area of PNCs is 112.5 m2 g−1 which is 35% higher than that of a PCN at 83.4 m2 g−1. On the other hand, the specific surface area of CNs is increased 2.4 times to 63.9 m2 g−1 compared to that of a CN at 18.9 m2 g−1. These results are consistent with the observed morphological changes. In addition, it is interesting to note that the peak at around 3.9 nm in BJH pore size distribution is greatly enhanced for PCNs compared to the PCN (Fig. S3B†), indicating new pores of smaller sizes were generated during the exfoliation process by ultrasonication.

Co3O4 nanoparticles were loaded on PCNs for the photocatalytic dye degradation study. XRD patterns in Fig. 4A demonstrate the successful preparation of C3N4 and Co3O4 (JCPDS 78-1970) composites. With the increasing loading percentage of Co3O4 in the range of 0.55–7.68 wt% as determined by ICP, the characteristic (311) and (400) peaks of the spinel Co3O4 become more obvious. The UV-vis DRS spectra (Fig. 4B) show that the light absorption intensity in the visible region is greatly enhanced after loading of Co3O4 on PCNs. As evidenced by the TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 5, Co3O4 nanoparticles of around 5–10 nm are well distributed on the surface of PCNs and the lattices of the nanoparticles are consistent with the Co3O4 phase as detected by XRD. The AFM image in Fig. S4† shows that particles in 3.82% Co3O4/PCNs become slightly thicker at around 6 nm compared with that of PCNs alone (5 nm) due to the presence of Co3O4 on the surface. The mesopores of PCNs could be partially blocked by Co3O4 as evidenced by the weakening of BJH peaks in Fig. S3B† while the specific surface area is only decreased slightly from 112.5 to 103.5 m2 g−1. Hence, the heat treatment at 350 °C during the loading of the Co3O4 co-catalyst does not induce adverse effects on the morphological properties of PCNs.

Rhodamine B was chosen as a model dye to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of various samples. Before light irradiation, adsorption equilibrium was achieved in the dark. It was found that 2.7%, 4.2%, 8.3% and 10.0% of RhB in the starting solution can be adsorbed on CN, CNs, PCN and PCNs in the dark, respectively. These results correlate well with the specific surface areas of different samples. Under UV-vis light illumination, RhB can be completely degraded in 2 h when Co3O4/CN was used as the photocatalyst and H2O2 as the oxidant (Fig. 6A). Under the same conditions, it took 30 min less for complete degradation of RhB when CN was replaced by CNs, indicating that exfoliated C3N4 with a higher surface area and smaller thickness lead to higher photocatalytic activity, which has been observed by others for degradation of dyes or organic pollutants.12,24,32 The activity can be further enhanced using the porous C3N4 samples. As shown in Fig. 6A, it only requires 60 min and 30 min for complete degradation of RhB in the presence of Co3O4/PCN and Co3O4/PCNs, respectively. These data show that the photocatalytic activity of C3N4 can be greatly improved by proper tuning of its morphological features such as porosity and layer thickness. The mesoporous C3N4 nanosheets (PCNs) exhibit remarkably higher photocatalytic activity than the bulk C3N4 (CN) due to its higher surface area (Fig. S3†), enhanced light absorption (Fig. 2) and good water dispersity (Fig. S5†). The control studies (Fig. 6B) show that in the absence of light or catalysts, there were no significant changes in dye concentration within the 150 min test. When an equivalent amount of Co3O4 alone was used as the catalyst, no appreciable drop in RhB concentration was observed as well. It is to be noted that the catalyst concentration adopted in this work is rather low (5 mg of Co3O4/PCNs in 100 mL solution). On the other hand, it took 50 min to degrade RhB completely when the bare PCNs were used as the photocatalyst. Thus, the loading of Co3O4 can facilitate the electron and hole separation generated in C3N4 to achieve higher photocatalytic activity.4,37 The exfoliated mesoporous C3N4 nanosheets developed in the present work can promote the formation of a heterostructure with Co3O4 due to its high surface area and good dispersity in water. The effect of the loading percentage of Co3O4 was studied. As shown in Fig. S6,† with a small percentage of Co3O4 (1.66 wt%) loaded, 61% of RhB can be degraded in 10 min compared with 31% without Co3O4. When the loading was increased by 3.82%, up to 61% and 85% of RhB can be degraded within 10 and 20 min, respectively. At higher loadings of 5.18% and 7.68%, the activity dropped which could be due to the light shielding effect caused by the overloaded Co3O4 nanoparticles. The time needed for complete RhB degradation was around 30 min when the loading of Co3O4 was between 0.55 and 3.82%. A recycle study using 3.82% Co3O4/PCNs has revealed that the catalyst is stable as there was almost no decrease in activity within 6 cycles (Fig. 7). Besides Co3O4, three other metal oxides, Fe3O4, NiO and CuO, were also loaded on PCNs for degradation of RhB. As revealed by TEM images in Fig. S7,† these metal oxides were successfully loaded. They have similar particle sizes to that of Co3O4 (5–10 nm). Among them, Fe3O4 and NiO nanoparticles are poorly dispersed on PCNs compared to Co3O4. CuO nanoparticles are well distributed and a similar activity compared with Co3O4 for dye degradation was obtained (Fig. S8†). NiO and Fe3O4 as cocatalysts are slightly less active and are still able to degrade RhB completely within 40 min. These results demonstrate that PCNs can be used as a versatile support to load earth-abundant metal oxides for efficient dye degradation. Similarly, macroporous C3N4 nanosheets were also prepared by exfoliating macroporous C3N4 in the present study. The resulting nanosheets also show enhanced photocatalytic activity for RhB degradation (Fig. S9†). Although a direct comparison of photocatalytic activity with those in the literature is difficult due to varied reaction conditions, our system is indeed among the best reported under similar reaction conditions as summarized in Table S1.†
 Fig. 6  Photocatalytic degradation of RhB over different carbon nitride samples (A) and under different conditions (B) with UV-vis light. The amounts of PCN and PCNs were kept at 5 mg, and the loading of Co3O4 was about 3.8–4.0 wt%.

Based on the results presented in the literature, it was found that bath sonication was generally applied for exfoliation of C3N4. Although this type of sonicator is easily accessible, the relatively weak power and uneven energy distribution within the bath may hamper the efficient production of high quality nanosheets.13,39 On the other hand, a probe sonicator which has a higher power and directly contacts with the liquid can induce higher stress to the liquid in the suspension. Herein, we carried out a comparative study on these two types of sonicators using the PCN sample. The detailed experimental conditions can be found in ESI.† Though it is not likely to gain quantitative conclusions for two different systems, it is certain that a much shorter time is needed for probe sonication (2 h) than bath sonication (16 h) to obtain C3N4 with similar thickness of several nanometers (Fig. S10†). Furthermore, probe sonication has resulted in a decrease of lateral size of C3N4 to around 200 nm while the bath sonication has no such effect. Micron-sized C3N4 nanosheets were mainly observed after bath sonication which is supported by the particle size distribution from dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement (Fig. S10C and D†). As a result, the photocatalytic activity of PCNs by probe sonication is higher than that by bath sonication for RhB degradation as shown in Fig. S10B.†
The superior performance of PCNs can also be demonstrated for photocatalytic water reduction to H2 after loaded with a Pt co-catalyst. As shown in Fig. 8, the visible light-driven H2 evolution rate over Pt/PCNs is 18.8 μmol h−1, which is 26 times higher than that over Pt/CN. Meanwhile, Pt/CNs can achieve 7.5 times enhancement in H2 evolution compared with Pt/CN. The enhancement factor of Pt/CNs compared to Pt/CN for H2 evolution reported by other groups is normally 2–3 times under visible light.10,12 Due to the quantum confinement effect, the exfoliated C3N4 exhibits a blue shift in light absorbance with the absorption edge normally shifted from around 450–470 nm to 420 nm.10,12 Such a blue shift compromises the activity under visible light, hence leading to limited improvement in H2 evolution as reported in the literature. In comparison, the absorbance edges of CNs and PCNs derived from cyanamide in this work after exfoliation are still maintained in the visible light range (456 nm and 488 nm, respectively). As a result, a greater enhancement factor in H2 evolution activity was obtained in this work under visible light. When urea-derived C3N4 was used as a control, a similar blue shift to near-UV light can be observed for exfoliated C3N4 which resulted in less than two times enhancement for H2 evolution (data not shown). These results demonstrate that C3N4 obtained from appropriate precursors like cyanamide can benefit more from the formation of nanosheets by exfoliation while with less significant effect from the blue shift due to the 2D quantum confinement.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the porous C3N4 nanosheets (PCNs) obtained by probe ultrasonication treatment of porous C3N4 exhibit remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activities compared with the bulk nonporous C3N4. With Co3O4 loaded as the co-catalyst, the degradation of RhB was completed in 30 min, which is substantially shorter than 120 min required when the bulk C3N4 was used. The stability of the catalyst was demonstrated by consistent performances in 6 repeated runs. In the presence of the Pt co-catalyst, the evolution rate of H2 over PCNs is 26 times higher than that over the bulk C3N4 under the same conditions. The superior photocatalytic performances of PCNs can be attributed to the high surface area, good dispersity in aqueous solution, and favourable interaction with the co-catalyst nanoparticles toward efficient charge transfer.
