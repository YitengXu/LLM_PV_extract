    , Accepted 13th June 2012First published on 14th June 2012AbstractThis work demonstrates that the bis-adduct of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is an effective inhibitor of the aggregation of PCBM inside the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix. Substituting some of the PCBM with bis-PCBM apparently reduces the size of PCBM-rich clusters, enhancing both the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the fill factor (FF), leading to a ∼17% increment in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for a cell with 8.3 wt% bis-PCBM replacement. More importantly, a tiny amount of bis-PCBM significantly improves the morphological stability of P3HT–PCBM blend against high-temperature aging. All P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM devices exhibit extremely stable PCEs, which do not visibly change upon heating at 150 °C for 15 hours.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells have attracted considerable research interest from both academia and industry because they have the advantages of light weight, low material cost, good mechanical flexibility, and simplicity of manufacture.1–3 Among numerous photoactive donor–acceptor composites, the blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been extensively investigated since cells based on such a composite have a reproducible power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3–5%.4–7 Recent advances in low-bandgap conjugated polymers and novel fullerene derivatives have further increased the PCE to 6–9%.8,9 Beyond the need for a high PCE, the lifetime of solar devices importantly affects their commercialization. Many studies have established that appropriate annealing treatment3,5 or the use of a liquid with a high boiling point as a processing additive10,11 in the coating solution during device fabrication to increase the number and size of the crystalline domains of the conjugated polymer and to establish nano-scale bi-continuous networks of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in the photoactive layer is essential to obtaining a high PCE. However, the morphology of the D–A blend is normally very sensitive to the fabrication procedure and the heating process. For instance, soaking P3HT–PCBM devices at high temperature for a long period can cause the segregation of PCBM, which is a commonly used acceptor, into micro-sized clusters, markedly reducing the area of the D–A interface and destroying the continuous path along which carriers can be transported to electrodes, severely degrading the cell efficiency.12
Several strategies for overcoming the drawback of the morphological instability of photoactive composites of conjugated polymer/fullerene derivatives have been developed. Fréchet etal.13 incorporated a 3,4-dihexylthiophene monomer into the backbone of P3HT to reduce the effective regioregularity of P3HT and found that this polymer can dramatically suppress the crystallization-driven phase separation of its composite with PCBM during thermal annealing. Bertho et al.14 utilized a conjugated polymer with a high glass transition temperature as the donor to freeze PCBM clusters after spin-drying. Miyanishi et al.15 and Fréchet et al.16 synthesized a cross-linkable poly(3-(5-hexenyl)thiophene) and a bromine-functionalized copolymer, respectively, to construct polymer nets to confine the large-scale motion of PCBM molecules/clusters at high temperature. However, the presence of crosslinking bridges can disturb the crystallization of conjugated polymer backbones, lowering the carrier mobility and light-harvesting capability. Furthermore, the thermal annealing process that is adopted to grow polymer crystals and create continuous pathways for charge carriers can simultaneously activate the cross-linking reaction to form intermolecular bonds that may hinder the development of the optimal morphology. Accordingly, although this method is simple and effective, the development of cross-linkable materials that can form a stable as well as optimal morphology remains a challenge. Along with these methods, C60-bearing diblock copolymers17 and double-cable polymers18 have been employed as effective surfactants to improve the mutual compatibility of P3HT and PCBM, retarding their phase separation. However, the preparation of these copolymers typically involves complicated synthetic steps and a tedious purification procedure, which lowers the yield of the product and limits its practical uses.
Various new fullerene derivatives have been designed to solve the aforementioned problem.19–24 The functionalization of PCBM with epoxide19 or styrene20 groups can greatly stabilize the blend morphology by chemically bonding PCBM molecules together, but the presence of these cross-linkable moieties reduces the probability that molecules come into close contact with each other, thereby lowering the mobility of electrons in the material. Recently, several amorphous fullerene derivatives, such as dihexylfluorene21 and 9,9-dimethylfluorene22 analogues of PCBM, have been used to replace PCBM as electron acceptors. Their blends with P3HT exhibit favorable morphological stability against heating. Nevertheless, the application of these molecules as acceptors of low-bandgap polymers frequently yields a lower cell efficiency than that achieved when PCBM is used as the acceptor. This study demonstrates that a tiny amount of bis-PCBM, which typically appears as a byproduct in the synthesis of PCBM, can effectively protect PCBM from harsh intermolecular aggregation, reducing the size of PCBM clusters within the P3HT matrix and thereby increasing the area of the interface between the two materials and the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the solar device. This effect largely stabilizes the morphology of the photoactive composite and then the PCE of the device against aging at high temperature.
Experimental section
Materials
PCBM (>99%) and bis-PCBM (>99.5%) were purchased from Nano-C and used as received. Regioregular P3HT was prepared using the Grignard metathesis method,25 providing regiocontrol in each coupling step in the polymeric reaction. The regioregularity was determined by 1H NMR to be greater than 95%. The number-average molecular weight was 43000 g mol−1 and the polydispersity index was 1.3, based on GPC analysis in which tetrahydrofuran and polystyrene were employed as eluent and standard, respectively. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) (Clevios P VP AI4083) was purchased from HC Stark and filtered through a 0.25 μm PVDF syringe filter before spin-coating.
Solar cell fabrication
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated by spin-coating a layer of PEDOT–PSS (∼40 nm) on a piece of precleaned ITO glass, drying at 140 °C for 10 min in air, and transferring into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Both P3HT (15 mg mL−1) and PCBM (12 mg mL−1) were co-dissolved in 1.0 mL of chlorobenzene to prepare the coating solution. Four other coating solutions were also made by replacing 4.1, 8.3, 17, or 100 wt% of PCBM with bis-PCBM. Then, these solutions were spin-coated on top of the PEDOT–PSS layer to form a P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM photoactive layer of ∼120 nm, and then thermally annealed on a digitally controlled hot plate at 150 °C for 10 min. Finally, a Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm) electrode was deposited on top of the P3HT–PCBM by thermal evaporation at a pressure of approximately 10−6 torr to complete the fabrication of the device. The thickness of each layer was determined using a Dektak 6 M profilometer after the surface of the film had been cut with a razor blade to expose the substrate. The active area of the device, defined by a shadow mask, was 0.06 cm2.
Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 on a Keithley 2400 instrument. AM1.5G solar irradiation was obtained from a 300 W solar simulator (Oriel 91160), and the 100 mW cm−2 light intensity was calibrated by a mono-Si reference cell with a KG5 filter (PV Measurements, Inc.), which was precalibrated by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), according to the procedure described elsewhere.26 The mismatch factor was not considered here. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed with a differential scanning calorimeter (Du-Pont, DSC 2900) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained on a Jasco V-570 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Optical microscopic (OM) and atomic force microscopic images were recorded on a home-made microscope and an atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments Nano Scope IIIa), respectively. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were captured with a Hitachi H-7100 microscope. The TEM samples were prepared by spin-coating the blend solution on a crystalline KBr substrate before being placed in a water bath to dissolve the KBr. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) film floating on the surface of the water was deposited onto a TEM copper grid, before being dried at room temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were measured by a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα as the incident beam. Data were obtained from 4° to 30° (2θ) at a scan rate of 0.2 s per step.
Results and discussion
Although bis-PCBM has the same substituent as PCBM, the former bears two functional moieties on each C60 core and generally comprises a mixture of stereo-isomers, hindering the close contact of neighboring fullerene cages and then lowering the degree of intermolecular aggregation. The DSC thermograms in Fig. 1 reveal that PCBM possesses crystallization and melting temperatures of 249 and 285 °C, respectively, but bis-PCBM is apparently an amorphous compound whose DSC curve includes no noticeable phase transition peak. Based on this observation, bis-PCBM is adopted as an aggregation inhibitor to reduce the size of the PCBM clusters inside the P3HT matrix to increase the donor–acceptor interface, and to restrain the coagulation of PCBM clusters at high temperature to improve the morphological stability of the photoactive blend. Moreover, the structure similarity may promote the compatibility of two molecules.

Bulk heterojunction solar cells based on composite films of P3HT and PCBM, bis-PCBM or their mixture were fabricated with a device structure of ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:(PCBM:bis-PCBM)/Ca/Al, as displayed in Fig. 2. The J–V curves of these solar devices are plotted in Fig. 3 and the relevant photovoltaic characteristics are listed in Table 1. As expected, the P3HT–bis-PCBM cell has the highest open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.69 V because bis-PCBM has a higher-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) than PCBM. All other devices have a similar VOC of 0.58 V, revealing that the partial replacement of PCBM with bis-PCBM does not influence VOC. Conversely, the low carrier-mobility nature in bis-PCBM causes the P3HT–bis-PCBM cell to have the lowest JSC. However, JSC increases from 8.67 to 9.47 mA cm−2 as the amount of bis-PCBM increases from 0 to 8.3 wt%; it then decreases as the bis-PCBM loading increases further. The fill factor (FF) also increases with the bis-PCBM loading up to 8.3 wt%, and decreases thereafter. The surface morphology of the thermally annealed composite films of P3HT–PCBM with various bis-PCBM loadings was examined using AFM. Fig. 4 shows that the surface roughness decreases from 5.4, 5.0, 3.7 to 2.8 nm as the bis-PCBM loading increases from 0, 4.1, 8.3 to 17 wt%. This finding suggests that the presence of bis-PCBM may suppress the growth of PCBM clusters during drying and thermal annealing processes, substantially increasing the interfacial area between the P3HT donor and the fullerene acceptor, and promoting the formation of interconnected PCBM–bis-PCBM clusters, which transport free electrons to the cathode. In addition, how bis-PCBM affects the structural ordering of P3HT was examined by conducting XRD measurements on the films of P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM ternary blends, which were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. All diffractograms in Fig. S1 (ESI†) display a distinct (100) peak at 2θ ≈ 5.3°, originating from the lamella structure of P3HT. The corresponding mean size of P3HT crystallites was then estimated based on the full width at the half maximum intensity (B2θ) of the diffraction peak, according to Scherrer's equation, L = 0.9λ/B2θcos(θ), where λ denotes the wavelength of the X-ray and θ represents the diffraction angle. Table S1† summarizes these results, indicating that the grain size of P3HT crystallites in the P3HT–PCBM blend is around 11.2 nm, which monotonously increases with an increasing loading of the bis-PCBM additive. This finding reveals that bis-PCBM reduces the mean size of PCBM clusters in the P3HT matrix, subsequently promoting the crystallinity of P3HT. On the other hand, from a viewpoint of electronic energy levels, the relative high-lying LUMO of bis-PCBM over that of PCBM may prohibit the transfer of excited electrons from PCBM to bis-PCBM and create electron traps. To explore this effect, the electron and hole mobilities of the blend films were determined by using the SCLC method as a function of the weight ratio of bis-PCBM over the sum of both fullerene derivatives. Experimental results in Fig. S2 and Table S2† indicate that as the wt% of bis-PCBM increases from 0% to 17%, the electron mobility decreases gradually from 3.64 × 10−4 to 3.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Conversely, the hole mobility increases from 1.86 × 10−4 to 3.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whose trend is consistent with the XRD results. These changes subsequently improve the balance between the mobilities of the two carries because the P3HT–PCBM blend has a higher electron mobility than its hole mobility. However, P3HT–bis-PCBM has the lowest electron mobility of 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the highest hole mobility of 3.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 among those of the P3HT–PCBM:bis:PCBM blends. As a result, the device based on the blend of P3HT and PCBM:bis-PCBM (11:1) has the highest power conversion efficiency of 3.62%.

To examine the effect of bis-PCBM on the thermal stability of device performance, the P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM devices were heated on top of a digitally controlled hot plate at 150 °C for various periods in a glovebox, which provided a low moisture and low oxygen environment (water < 0.1 ppm and O2 < 0.3 ppm) to exclude any possible influence of thermal oxidation of P3HT. The J–V curves of these solar cells were obtained under simulated AM 1.5 illumination. Fig. 5 plots the variations of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE as functions of heating time. Heat treatment has no effect on the VOC of the standard P3HT–PCBM device, but both JSC and FF fall rapidly with heating time, leading to a rapid drop in PCE to be below 0.5% after 900 min of heating. In contrast, the P3HT–bis-PCBM cell exhibits highly stable PCE against high-temperature aging. Very interestingly, replacing a very little (4.1 wt%) PCBM with bis-PCBM in the P3HT–PCBM blend already yields a highly thermally stable polymer solar cell, which retains its initial PCE even after thermal aging at 150 °C for 15 hours.

Fig. 6(a) and (b) present the UV-vis absorption spectra of the composite films of P3HT–PCBM and P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM (8.3 wt%), respectively, following thermal aging at 150 °C for various times. Both spectra include two main absorption bands at 330 and 515 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition in PCBM–bis-PCBM and P3HT, respectively. Without bis-PCBM, the absorption feature of P3HT is almost the same, but the intensity of the absorption band at 330 nm declines considerably during thermal aging, to almost zero after two hours of heating, suggesting that PCBM clusters in the P3HT matrix coalesce into large particles, which fully scatter incident light. Fig. 6(b) clearly reveals that the absorption spectrum of the P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM (8.3 wt%) film remains very stable upon thermal aging, indicating that bis-PCBM can effectively mitigate the aggregation of PCBM. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments also supported these findings. The measurements were made under an excitation light with a wavelength of 550 nm to monitor the PL behavior of P3HT. Fig. 7(a) and (b) present the PL spectra of the P3HT–PCBM and P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM (8.3 wt%) blends, respectively, after they had been thermally aged for various time intervals. As aging time increases, the emission of the P3HT–PCBM film becomes more intense, implying growth of the size of the phase domains in the blend, which reduces the interfacial area between P3HT and PCBM and the dissociation efficiency of the photo-induced P3HT excitons. Moreover, the aged P3HT–PCBM films exhibit a larger increase in intensity in the high-wavelength region than in the low-wavelength region of their PL spectra, suggesting that aging induces the ordered packing of more P3HT chains. Consistent with the UV-vis results, the presence of bis-PCBM effectively keeps the PL spectra unchanged during long-term aging at 150 °C, as shown in Fig. 7(b).

Both optical microscopy (OM) and TEM were utilized to study the evolution of thin-film morphology during the thermal aging of P3HT–PCBM and P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM (8.3 wt%) blends. The OM images in Fig. 8(a) reveal that aging of the P3HT–PCBM film at 150 °C for two hours produces numerous micron-sized black dots over the whole surface, the number of which increases with aging time. Elemental analysis of these black dots by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in Fig. S3† reveals an intense oxygen signal accompanied with a trace sulfur peak, proving that they are PCBM-rich clusters. However, Fig. 8(b) indicates that all P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM surfaces are featureless with almost no black aggregate formed even after heating for 15 hours. The TEM images in Fig. 9(a) magnify the smooth region and the insets display the black dots identified in Fig. 8(a). The bright and dark areas correspond to the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich domains, respectively. Clearly, longer thermal aging produces larger PCBM clusters. Furthermore, the enlarged TEM micrographs in Fig. S4† show that the P3HT chains in the aged films pack into a fiber-like structure and these fibers become longer as the aging time increases, indicating that the high-temperature aging causes the crystallization of P3HT into a polymeric fiber and the simultaneous aggregation of PCBM into micro-sized clusters. The latter will reduce the concentration of PCBM in the smooth region that would otherwise destroy the continuous electron-transporting networks, increasing the number of carrier traps. However, for the P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM system, thermal aging neither causes the formation of large PCBM particles nor obviously affects the nano-morphology of the blends, as shown in Fig. 9(b). For comparison, two P3HT–PCBM blends with fewer PCBM contents, in which the weight ratios of P3HT:PCBM are 1:0.73 and 1:0.67 rather than 1:0.8, were thermally aged at 150 °C for 15 hours. The OM images displayed in Fig. S5† clearly reveal that the aging process still induces the generation of micro-sized clusters, demonstrating that the reduced concentration of PCBM in the P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM system is not the cause for the enhanced stability of blend morphology. These findings strongly support the application of bis-PCBM as an effective anticoagulant of PCBM, even in very small amounts, to yield P3HT–PCBM blends with a highly thermally stable morphology.

Conclusions
Bulk heterojunction P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM solar cells with various bis-PCBM loadings were fabricated. The second substituent in bis-PCBM further hinders the close contact of C60 cores to form large clusters, and the diverse molecular geometry of regioisomers of disubstituted fullerene prevents the formation of the ordered molecular packing that increases the area of the D–A interface and promotes the formation of bicontinuous networks of D–A materials. Accordingly, the JSC, FF and then the PCE of solar devices are increased. Moreover, the thin film of P3HT–PCBM:bis-PCBM exhibits a highly stable morphology in a high-temperature environment; therefore, the PCE of the device based on such a blend remains almost constant during aging for 15 hours at 150 °C. These observations demonstrate that disubstituted fullerene is a promising phase-separation inhibitor for use in polymer/fullerene-based bulk heterojunction solar cells. This approach offers several advantages: the identical substituent in fullerene mono- and bis-adducts ensures high miscibility of these compounds and retains the compatibility between the conjugated polymer and fullerene derivative; the similar solubility of the two molecules simplifies the selection of a processing solvent; and the bisadduct is generally a byproduct of the synthesis of monosubstituted fullerene, so no extra effort is required for its preparation.
