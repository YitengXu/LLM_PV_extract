Introduction
Solar energy conversion by artificial photosynthetic systems (APSs) that is inspired by natural leaves is thought to be a potential and promising approach for solving the energy crisis.1–3 The photochemical transformation of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels (such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, and so on) has emerged as a research hotspot.4–7 However, CO2 conversion efficiency in artificial photosynthesis is still very low compared with photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. For the gas involved CO2 reduction reactions, gas transport in the gas channels and within the porous materials is one limiting factor and tends to affect the activities to some extent. However, there are very few studies on such exploration.8,9 Hierarchical assemblies featuring the combination of macroscopic and microscopic structures could in principle allow for enhanced liquid flow and gas transport in liquid-phase reaction systems.10,11 Thus designing of artificial photosynthetic systems with hierarchical porosity is of high significance. Further investigation of liquid flow and gas transport from the theoretical aspects will deepen understandings between the performance and hierarchical morphology.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising material with wide applications in photocatalytic solar energy conversion,12,13 NADH regeneration,14 CO2 activation,15 ion actuators,16 chemical sensors,17 biological imaging,18 piezoelectricity19 and so forth.20–22 To date, various nanoarchitectural g-C3N4, including 1D nanorods and nanowires, 2D nanosheets, and 3D architectures, have been developed via hard/soft template synthesis,23–25 solvothermal/molten-salt technology,26 exfoliation methods18,27 and supermolecular chemistry.28 The morphology, electronic structure, optical properties and functions of g-C3N4 can be efficiently regulated through nanostructure engineering.29–32 However, the current approaches are limited to exotemplating (for 0D and 1D materials) and exfoliation (for 2D materials) strategies.27,33–35 Assembling low-dimensional building blocks into bioinspired hierarchical architectures with superior performance is a promising but challenging task. Jun and Stucky et al. developed a molecular cooperative assembly strategy for the construction of 3D macroscopic assemblies of carbon nitride.36 Nevertheless, a more general and effective transformation strategy for multiscale morph-tunable assemblies will be more appealing.
Nature has a variety of hierarchical morphologies ranging from 1D to 3D structures that generate sophisticated functions, such as light manipulation,37–39 transportation,40–42 and gas diffusion.43 Bio-directed morphology engineering would allow facile tailoring of morphology and physical properties.44,45 However, there are few reports on constructing multiscale carbon nitride architectures by this bio-directed strategy.46 Herein we demonstrate a general and facile synthetic strategy to prepare hierarchical 1D to 3D macro/meso/nanoscopic morph-tunable carbon nitride assemblies via bio-directed morphology engineering for enhanced artificial photosynthesis of CO and methane via CO2 reduction. Three typical kinds of biological systems, Escherichia coli (1D), Papilio nephelus butterfly wings (2D, planar) and cole pollen (3D), are employed in the current study. A two-step transformation process is applied for the construction of 1D to 3D macro/meso/nanoscopic carbon nitride assemblies with high surface areas (Scheme 1). Moreover, liquid flow and gas diffusion behaviors are investigated using COMSOL multiphysics computational simulation to reveal the relationship between structural effects and output efficiency theoretically. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive theoretical modelling and understanding for liquid flow and gas diffusion within hierarchical porous materials in artificial photosynthesis. More importantly, this research combining theoretical calculations and experimental techniques in the controlled design of APSs may provide further avenues to APS optimization.

Experimental
Materials

Escherichia coli samples were provided by Beijing Beina Chuanglian Biotechnology Institute. Papilio nephelus butterfly wings were provided by Shanghai Qiuyu Biological Technology Co., Ltd. Wall-broken cole pollen was provided by Shengzhou Siming Mountain apiculture Co., Ltd. All the commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification.
Synthesis of g-C3N4
Bio-directed g-C3N4 was synthesized via a two-step transformation method. Firstly, three bio-templates were pretreated by different methods. Escherichia coli was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution and dehydrated using ethanol with graded concentrations before slightly drying at 30 °C to obtain a solid sample. Butterfly wings of Papilio nephelus were soaked in ethanol for 10 min, followed by immersing in 4 wt% NaOH solution for 2 h, and then they were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water, followed by drying at 60 °C to be used. The wall-broken cole pollen was washed with ethanol under magnetic stirring three times, 20 min each time and then dried at 60 °C. Bio-directed SiO2 was synthesized through a surface sol–gel process with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, ≥99.0%) as the surfactant. In a typical procedure, CTAB (6.0 g) was dissolved in pure water (30 mL) with magnetic stirring at 60 °C for 15 min. Secondly, 1.4 M HCl solution (30 mL) was added to ethyl silicate (TEOS, SiO2 ≥28.4%, 16 g) dissolved in ethanol (180 mL). The high volume ratio of ethanol-to-H2O prevented silica from precipitating. Afterwards, the two solutions were mixed together and stirred for another 10 min to obtain a sol. The pretreated Escherichia coli, butterfly wings and cole pollen were immersed into the sol for 12 h at room temperature and subsequently pulled out to rinse and dry at 60 °C, followed by calcination under continuous air flowing at 600 °C for 12 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to remove the organic constituents, and the residues were bio-directed SiO2 samples.
In the second step, SiO2 samples were activated with 1 M HCl solution for 10 min, followed by centrifuging and washing until pH constant at 7. After vacuum drying at 60 °C, the pretreated SiO2 samples were immersed in cyanamide solution (SiO2/cyanamide = 1/1, w/w). Afterwards, the suspension was brought into vacuum impregnation at 60 °C for 12 h, and then centrifuged, washed and dried at 60 °C. After that, the obtained white mixture was sintered under continuous Ar flowing at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1 to obtain SiO2/g-C3N4 hybrids. Finally, the resultant yellow powder was treated with 4 M NH4HF2 solution at room temperature for 48 hours to eliminate the silica template, and the precipitate was then centrifuged and thoroughly washed three times with deionized water and ethanol before drying at 80 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The ultimate products were bio-directed g-C3N4 with different architectures.
Bulk g-C3N4 was obtained by sintering cyanamide under continuous Ar flowing at 550 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1.
Loading of co-catalysts
The loading of 1 wt% Au on the g-C3N4 photocatalyst was conducted by a precipitation method using HAuCl4 as the Au source.47 Typically, g-C3N4 (1.95 g) was immersed in 10 mM HAuCl4 solution (10 mL) under vigorous stirring at 70 °C for 4 h, with a pH value of 9 adjusted by using 0.2 M NaOH solution. The photocatalyst was then recovered, filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at 100 °C overnight before heat preservation at 200 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
The loading of 1 wt% RuO2 was performed according to an established method reported previously.8 Firstly, photocatalyst powder (986.8 mg, after loading of 1 wt% Au co-catalysts) was impregnated with the solution of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl (Ru3(CO)12, ≥99%, 21.1 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 20 mL). The mixed samples were continually stirred at 60 °C for 4 h, and then dried at 60 °C, and the powder obtained was calcined at 350 °C in air for 2 h to convert ruthenium complex species to ruthenium oxide.
Characterization
The morphologies were characterized with a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). Raw Escherichia coli samples were characterized by using a biological TEM (Tecnai G2 spirit Biotwin, FEI). The samples were examined by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, D-max/2550) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Nicolet 6700) was used to analyze the composition and functional groups of the samples. UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was perfomed using a UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 950). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos, AXIS ULTRA DLD) was utilized to analyze the intramolecular electron valence state and a chemical adsorption analyzer (ASAP 2010 M + C) was adopted to evaluate the surface areas and porosity of the samples. Elemental analysis (EA, Elementar, Vario-EL Cube) was conducted to measure the content of C, N and H in the samples.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Reduction of CO2 was carried out in a photocatalytic activity evaluation system (Beijing Aulight technology co., LTD) composed of a CEL-PE300E-3A Xe lamp (PerkinElmer, 300 W) and a 300 mL sealed quartz reactor at ambient temperature. A CEL-NP2000 optical power meter (Beijing Aulight technology co., LTD) was used to test the light intensity on the sample. The average irradiance of the full spectrum is about 690 mW cm−2. For the reaction under visible light, an optical cut-off filter (Beijing perfect light technology co., LTD) was applied to restrict the wavelength of incident light to >400 nm, decreasing light intensity to 330 mW cm−2. To measure the photocatalytic performance, the gaseous reaction products (CO and CH4) were detected using a gas chromatograph (GC-7920, Beijing Aulight technology co., LTD) with a flame ionization detector (FID) and argon as the carrier gas. In a typical experiment process, catalyst powder (100 mg) was dispersed in a solution (50 mL) consisting of water (40 mL) as the solvent and triethanolamine (TEOA, ≥78.0%, 10 mL) as the sacrificial agent under continuous magnetic stirring. Prior to irradiation, the reaction system was evacuated and purged with pure CO2 for three or more cycles to substitute all the residuary air by CO2. The evolution of CO and CH4 was measured using a gas chromatography sampling each hour.
Liquid flow and gas diffusion simulation
Liquid flow and gas diffusion behaviors were investigated by the finite element method (FEM) utilizing the COMSOL multiphysics coupling function (software: COMSOL 5.0). Batteries & Fuel Cells module, CAD Import module, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) module and Chemical Reaction Engineering module were used here to carry out the steady state solution. A quasi-2D butterfly wing structural model was developed analytically and the dimension parameters of the simulation system were derived from SEM images. The inverse V-type ridges, disordered columnar pillars and basal substrate were ignored using periodic boundary conditions to simplify the calculation. The non-structural model was established by squeezing the corresponding structural model into a rectangle slab with equal volume. In order to reveal the effects of bio-directed macro/meso/nanoscopic architectures, models for laminar flow and transport of diluted species were used to simulate the process of liquid flow, chemical reaction as well as gas diffusion within a periodic repeating unit. Detailed data used in the simulation and calculation could be found in the ESI.†
Results and discussion

Escherichia coli (Fig. 1a2), Papilio nephelus butterfly wings (Fig. 1b2) and wall-broken cole pollen (Fig. 1c2) are selected as 1D, 2D and 3D architectures models respectively because of their large variety and species-specific (Fig. S1†). Here the butterfly wing serves as a 2D planar prototype because of its film feature although its elaborated structures are more complex than the traditional 2D concept. Typically, the biomass was first converted into SiO2 with CTAB as the surfactant to obtain a high specific surface area and the bio-directed SiO2 was subsequently templated into g-C3N4 with cyanamide as the precursor followed by the removal of SiO2 (Scheme 1). SEM images demonstrate the replication of the original morphologies of the biomass into the resulting SiO2 and g-C3N4 (Fig. 1). Distinctions mainly lie in the shrinkage of the dimensions caused by the heat treatment process. Hierarchical macro/meso/nanoscopic morph-tunable carbon nitride has a number of macropores particularly for 2D and 3D assemblies (Fig. 1b4 and c4). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms further demonstrate their hierarchical porosity. The adsorption–desorption isotherms for bio-directed SiO2 (Fig. 2a) demonstrate the existence of mesopores with wide size distribution. The BET surface area of bio-directed SiO2 has been remarkably improved (up to 734.63 m2 g−1) after CTAB was added as a surfactant (Table S1†), which is largely derived from the self-assembly of CTAB into a micellar structure and incorporating into a silica network to create nanopore channels after calcination.48 By contrast, the surface area of SiO2 replica without CTAB is only 45 m2 g−1. The resulting g-C3N4 has a higher surface area of 71 m2 g−1 (cole pollen-directed g-C3N4) and pore volume of 0.16 cm3 g−1 (Table S1†).

Both bulk g-C3N4 and bio-directed g-C3N4 samples possess almost the same X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S2a†) with slight diminishment of diffraction peaks of the bio-directed samples. The FTIR spectra of the bio-directed g-C3N4 (Fig. 2b) exhibit characteristic stretching vibration of aromatic CN heterocycles between 1200 cm−1 and 1650 cm−1 and breathing vibration of triazine or heptazine units at around 808 cm−1, analogous to those of bulk g-C3N4. The product with the C/N atomic ratio close to 0.65 (Table S2†) could be identified as nitrogen-rich g-C3N4.49,50 Additionally, a trace of hydrogen (∼2 wt%) derived from the uncondensed amino functions and adsorbed water was detected through the elemental analysis, which is also verified by the FTIR spectrum.51,52 Three distinct peaks in C 1s spectra at 284.8, 287.5 and 288.3 eV can be identified by the XPS spectrum (Fig. S2b†), corresponding to the graphite carbon species, C–NH2 species and sp2-hybridized carbon (N–CN) from the g-C3N4, respectively.53Fig. 2c shows two peaks presented in N 1s spectra. The dominative N 1s peak centered at 398.8 eV is defined as graphite-like sp2-hybridized nitrogen (CN–C) in g-C3N4. Besides, the other peak at 401.1 eV is regarded as amino functions (C–N–H).13 From the UV/vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2d), the red-shift of the absorption edge of butterfly wing-directed g-C3N4 was observed. Typical semiconductor absorption with a bandgap of 2.74 eV is observed for butterfly wing-directed g-C3N4 while the value of 2.77 eV is determined for bulk g-C3N4.
Nanometer-sized Au and RuO2 with a grain size ranging from 4 to 10 nm were directly deposited on the bare surface of g-C3N4, as was observed in extensive TEM studies (Fig. 3a). The clear lattice fringe of 0.230 nm can be attributed to the (111) facets of Au.54,55 Besides, the interplanar spacing of some other crystalline grains was calculated to be 0.252 nm, corresponding to the orientation of the atomic plane (101) in the rutile RuO2 (Fig. 3b).56 However, extremely trace of elemental Ru0 (d101 = 0.199 nm) can also be observed (Fig. 3c), which could be the by-product of ruthenium oxide reduction.57 XPS was carried out to examine the presence of Au and RuO2. C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Au 4f and Ru 3d peak can be detected obviously (Fig. 3d). Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 binding energies of 84.1 and 87.8 eV respectively were observed in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3e), which confirms the presence of Au with a zero-valent state.58 Moreover, the Ru 3d peak is very close to C 1s peaks (Fig. 3f). The Ru 3d spectrum was fitted with two primary spin orbit components at 282.6 and 285.4 eV for Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 respectively, which corresponds to the binding energy of Ru4+ and suggests the presence of RuO2 in the composites.59

Artificial photosynthesis is operated on g-C3N4 based systems in a liquid-phase reaction using triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Bare g-C3N4 evolved CO and CH4 as the main products. Other possible products including formic acid, formaldehyde or methanol were not detected, presumably due to the strong oxidizing ability of photoexcited holes (or OH radicals), which are able to react with the intermediates and products.60–62 The net hydrocarbon production was negligible. As expected, butterfly wing-directed g-C3N4 (termed bio-directed CN) without cocatalysts exhibited about 60% improvements in activities compared with the bulk g-C3N4 (termed bulk CN) (Fig. 4a).

(d) Scheme of the artificial photosynthesis processes over butterfly wing-directed g-C3N4. 
Co-catalysts were loaded to promote the activity. Au functions as an effective cocatalyst to accelerate CO2 reduction.63 After loading with 1 wt% Au, Au bio-directed CN evolved approximately 4.09 μmol of CO after 24 h irradiation, which is 4.1 times as much as that of Au bulk CN (Fig. S3†). In addition, the photocatalytic activity could be further improved after deposition of 1 wt% RuO2 co-catalyst (Fig. 4b and c). Ruthenium and its complexes could assist photocatalyze or electrocatalyze CO2 reduction to form CO or HCOOH with high selectivity and quantum yields.64,65 It is worth noting that an obvious promotion nearly 3.6 folds for CO evolution can be observed when comparing Au/RuO2 bio-directed CN with Au/RuO2 bulk CN. The CH4 yield reached 4.34 μmol g−1 h−1 for Au/RuO2 bio-directed CN, 11.6 times higher than that of Au/RuO2 bulk CN (Fig. 4a and c).
Oxygen was not detected in the current study. The oxygen produced by the water splitting is possibly partially consumed by the oxygen vacancies on the photocatalyst surface and partially employed for oxidizing the evolved products.66,67 Control experiments were cautiously performed. Without either of TEOA, photocatalyst or light, almost no CO and CH4 could be detected. When using Ar gas instead of CO2, only traces of products were detected because of the photoreduction of residual CO2 adsorbed on the photocatalyst surfaces. Since there are about 2 ppm of CO and 1 ppm of CH4 in the atmosphere, CO and CH4 in the above control experiments are partly regarded as contaminations from the natural air during sampling.8 These results strongly suggest that g-C3N4 undergoes photoexcitation with visible light irradiation, separating the photon-generated electrons and holes. Subsequently, electrons in the conduction band are consumed by CO2 reduction and holes in the valence band are captured by TEOA. We compared our results with other CO2 photoreduction systems and the data are listed in Table 1. However, because the experimental conditions (light intensity, wavelength range, irradiation distance, reaction temperature, reaction medium and others) are different, the photocatalytic performances vary considerably.

We attribute the activity improvements in APSs to the synergy of high liquid flow and gas diffusion efficiency due to the multiscale macro/meso/nanoscopic architectures, and more reactive sites originating from high specific surface areas (Fig. 4d). The surface area factor is a well-known one and widely investigated already.68–72 Whereas the CO2 photoreduction was conducted in a liquid-phase system involving processes of liquid flow and gas diffusion which are important factors for the catalytic reactions, so here we focus on liquid flow and gas diffusion behaviors using a COMSOL computational simulation method to reveal the relationship between structural effects and output efficiency theoretically. The finite element method (FEM) based on two major physical models (laminar flow and transport of diluted species)73,74 was conducted for the simulation within a macro/meso/nanoscopic periodic repeating unit based on a quasi-2D butterfly wing-directed model (Fig. 5a1). After loading with Au and RuO2 co-catalysts respectively, the g-C3N4 assemblies still retain the original hierarchical morphologies as revealed by SEM and EDS mapping (Fig. S4†). Thus the simulation based on such bio-directed structures is reasonable and convincing. The inverse V-type ridges, disordered columnar pillars and basal substrate were all simplified using periodic boundary conditions (Fig. 5a1) with dimension parameters shown in Fig. S5a.† The non-structural model for comparison was established by squeezing the corresponding structural model into a rectangle slab with equal volume (Fig. 5a2).

Numerical modules of the bio-directed model (b1) and non-structural model (b2) with periodic boundary condition. The blue arrow represents the direction of fluid flow. Sketch of fluid flow and the major gas diffusion mechanism for the bio-directed model (c1 and d1) and non-structural model (c2 and d2), respectively. The simulation results of flow velocity distribution, velocity field distribution and residual CO concentration on the bio-directed model (e1, f1 and g1) and non-structural model (e2, f2 and g2) surface, respectively. 
The liquid flow in the structures is modeled with the laminar flow interface that solves the Navier–Stokes equations at steady state73 (basic data for the simulation listed in Table S3†). The numerical modules with long entrance established by software (Fig. 5b1 and b2) designate the flow direction of external liquid with periodic boundary condition. The aqueous solution can circulate in the hierarchical macro/meso/nanoscopic holes and reacts on the surfaces of the whole substrate (Fig. 5c1). Contrastively, only the external surface is exposed to be contacted in the non-structural model (Fig. 5c2). The substance concentration and velocity field within the internal structures would change accordingly as time goes on, until the realization of steady state. Fig. 5e1 and e2 demonstrate that the flow velocity of the liquid in the bio-directed model with hierarchical architectures gains more than 60% improvements as compared to the non-structural model. Additionally, vortexes are formed around the hole wall of the porous structure (Fig. 5f1 and f2), which partly facilitate the sufficient contact and mass transport of the reacting species, thus speeding up the reaction kinetically.75,76
The catalytic reaction occurred in the APS was assumed to be a surface reaction (Fig. S5b and c†). The mass balances were set up with the transport of diluted species interface and solves the diffusion-convection equations at steady state.74 Gas diffusion behavior is discussed to have a better understanding of structural effects on catalytic efficiency. Differences of gas diffusion mechanism in micro-nano-scale distinguish the two models.77 Gas diffusion in the bio-directed model with hierarchical pores on a scale ranging from nanometer to submicrometre is determined by synergistic effect of molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion and adsorption layer surface diffusion (Fig. 5d1).74,78 Knudsen diffusion is predominant in mesopores while molecular diffusion occupies a leading position in macropores.78,79 While for the non-structural model, the molecular diffusion can be ignored and surface diffusion is foremost leaving internal parts not contacting (Fig. 5d2) since there is only traces of mesopores existed.78 The diffusivity of CO2 and CO (taking as examples) in hierarchical macro/meso/nanoscopic gas channels has been calculated (ESI for details†). Obviously, the molecular diffusivity in macropores is about 2–4 folds larger than the Knudsen diffusivity in mesopores, both of which are 4 orders of magnitude higher than the surface diffusivity (Table S5†). Thus the diffusion efficiency in bio-directed model with hierarchical architectures is definitely superior to the non-structural model.
Based on the higher gas diffusion efficiency, the reactants (CO2) can diffuse much faster within the bio-directed hierarchical framework. Meanwhile, the higher surface areas and more mesopores increase the local CO2 concentration which can prolong the hold-up time of CO2 in gas channels.11,80 Thus we can infer that the reaction rate is faster because of the aggregation of CO2 in the hierarchical porous framework.81 During the reaction, the main products CO and CH4 are released into the medium. The diffusion of released gases (taking CO as an example) was simulated based on the eqn (S4) and (S5) in the ESI.† Astonishingly, the average CO concentration (integral from Fig. 5g1 and g2) residual in the bio-directed model (0.45 mol m−3) is about a quarter of that in the non-structural model (1.9 mol m−3) (ESI for details†) in spite of a faster reaction rate, which means that more CO has been released. So it is reasonable to conclude that the diffusion of reaction products has been greatly facilitated in the bio-directed structures.
Above all, the macroscopic output efficiency has been significantly improved, closely relevant to the structure effects. First, the multiscale macro/meso/nanoscopic architectures facilitate the liquid flow. Second, gas transport is promoted by the mutual effect of hierarchical macro/mesoporous, including CO2 entrance to the reactive sites and products release to external liquid medium effectively. Last but not least, high porosity and surface areas contribute to increase the local CO2 concentration. The simulation results support the experiments well and give a deep understanding of the processes.
Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a general approach for the fabrication of hierarchical 1D to 3D macro/meso/nanoscopic morph-tunable carbon nitride assemblies via bio-directed morphology engineering. We believe that such an approach can be extended to a large variety of biomass with hierarchical architectures for realizing versatile fabrication of morph-tunable functional assemblies (not limited to carbon nitride). The CO2 photoreduction activity improvements are attributed to the synergy of high liquid flow and gas diffusion efficiency arising from the multiscale macro/meso/nanoscopic architectures, and more reactive sites derived from high specific surface areas. We anticipate that suitable structure modulations might be applied on other APSs to meet the optimal mass transport requirements. Moreover, this strategy provides the insight for designing a new family of APS by tuning morphology and functionality, and may also shed light on fundamental mechanisms of artificial photosynthesis processes.

 	Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the simplified butterfly wing-directed model (a1) and non-structural model (a2) using in the finite element simulation. Numerical modules of the bio-directed model (b1) and non-structural model (b2) with periodic boundary condition. The blue arrow represents the direction of fluid flow. Sketch of fluid flow and the major gas diffusion mechanism for the bio-directed model (c1 and d1) and non-structural model (c2 and d2), respectively. The simulation results of flow velocity distribution, velocity field distribution and residual CO concentration on the bio-directed model (e1, f1 and g1) and non-structural model (e2, f2 and g2) surface, respectively.
