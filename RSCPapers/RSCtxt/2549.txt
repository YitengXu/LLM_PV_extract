    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 5th November 2020AbstractTo investigate the effects of metal ions and angles of the carboxyl groups of dicarboxylates on the structures of coordination polymers, four Zn(II)/Cd(II) coordination polymers [Zn(L)(1,4-BDC)]·H2O (1), [Zn(L)(1,3-BDC)]·H2O (2), [Zn(L)(1,2-BDC)] (3) and [Cd(L)0.5(1,2-BDC)(H2O)] (4) [L = N,N′-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-terephthalamide, 1,4-H2BDC = terephthalic acid, 1,3-H2BDC = isophthalic acid, 1,2-H2BDC = phthalate] were prepared under hydrothermal conditions. Polymers 1 and 2 are 2D structures with 63 and 44 topology. Polymer 3 shows a 4-connected 3D framework, and 4 features a 1D structure with single/double alternate linkers. The effects of the positions of carboxyl groups and the coordination characteristics of metal ions on the structures of the title coordination polymers were studied. The title coordination polymers show multi-functional fluorescence responses towards metal ions (Fe3+), anions (CrO42−, Cr2O72−) and pesticides (2,6-DC-4-NA) and good stability in a wide range of pH values. Taking 1 as an example, the mechanism was also explored by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and the fluorescence lifetime experiment.
Introduction
In recent years, research on coordination polymers (CPs) has received widespread attention, mainly due to their role in adsorption, catalysis, photoelectricity, separation, and fluorescence sensing.1–15 Among the large variety of CPs, d10-based CPs exhibit fascinating sensing performance for metallic cations, inorganic anions, organic explosives, small organic molecules, antibiotics, and so on.16–24 Because of the variable components with this kind of CPs, including different types of metal ions and organic ligands with different functional sites, it is challenging and meaningful to elucidate the relationship between structures, compositions, and properties.25–29
On the other hand, the importance of sustainable development is self-evident; especially water and the environment are of paramount importance to human survival.30,31 Fe3+, inorganic anions containing Cr(VI) and pesticide (2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline = 2,6-DC-4-NA) pollutants pose a great threat to the ecosystem.32–37 Therefore, it is urgent to explore effective multi-functional fluorescence detection materials for the aforementioned pollutants. The Zn/Cd-carboxylate-based CPs show excellent sensing properties.38–43 Although the introduction of the second ligands with N-donors can enrich the structural type of CPs, it simultaneously complicates the understanding of the influential performance factors. Therefore, in this paper, three kinds of dicarboxylic acids (1,4-H2BDC = terephthalic acid, 1,3-H2BDC = isophthalic acid and 1,2-H2BDC = phthalate), two d10 metal ions (Zn2+ and Cd2+), and one N-donor ligand of N,N′-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-terephthalamide (L) were selected under the following considerations. a) Zn2+ and Cd2+ have excellent coordination ability and different coordination radii, which display different connected modes. b) 1,4-BDC, 1,3-BDC and 1,2-H2BDC exhibit the coordination angles from 180°, 120° to 60°, which may induce different coordination skeletons. c) The L ligand not only has good coordination capacity owing to the pyridine groups, but also possesses flexible conformation and supramolecular recognition sites, which may lead to different packing ways.
Based on the aforementioned considerations, in order to investigate the effects of metal ions, angles of carboxylates, and the L ligand on the structures and sensing properties, four multifunctional fluorescence recognition CPs [Zn(L)(1,4-BDC)]·H2O (1), [Zn(L)(1,3-BDC)]·H2O (2), [Zn(L)(1,2-BDC)] (3) and [Cd(L)0.5(1,2-BDC) (H2O)] (4) were obtained under hydrothermal conditions. On the basis of characterization by IR, PXRD and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the effects of the positions of carboxyl groups and the coordination characteristics of metal ions on the structures of the title CPs were studied. The fluorescence sensing properties of the title coordination polymers for Fe3+, anions (CrO42− and Cr2O72−) and pesticides (2,6-DC-4-NA), as well as the sensing mechanism were also investigated.

Result and discussion
Description of crystal structures

Crystal structure of [Zn(L)(1,4-BDC)]·H2O (1). 
The structural unit of 1 includes one Zn2+ ion, one L ligand, one 1,4-BDC anion and lattice water, which shows a 2D 3-c structure formed by Zn-(1,4-BDC) chains and (Zn-L)2 loops (Fig. 1). Polymer 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with a P21/c space group (Table 1). Central metal Zn2+ has a four-coordination mode with two N atoms of two different L ligands and two O atoms of two 1,4-BDC anions (Fig. 1a). The Zn–O bonds are 1.9202(13) Å and 1.9367(15) Å, which is a little shorter than those of Zn–N bonds [2.0405(16) Å and 2.0759(16) Å] (Table S1†). In 1, each 1,4-BDC anion connects the adjacent Zn2+ ions to form a [Zn-(1,4-BDC)]n wave-like chain with the Zn⋯Zn distance of 10.899 Å (Fig. 1b). Two Zn2+ are connected by two L ligands with a Zn⋯Zn distance of 13.617 Å (Fig. 1c). Thus, a 2D structure is constructed with the two above-mentioned subunits (Fig. 1d). Considering the 1,4-BDC anions and pairs of L ligands as linkers, keeping Zn2+ ions as nodes, the structure of 1 can be described as a 63 network (Fig. 1e).

Crystal structure of [Zn(L)(1,3-BDC)]·H2O (2). 
Polymer 2 is a 2D grid based on [Zn-L]n and [Zn-(1,3-BDC)]n chains (Fig. 2 and S2†). Polymer 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with a P space group. Central metal Zn2+ has a four-coordination mode, provided by two pyridyl N atoms from two L ligands and two carboxyl O atoms (Fig. 2a). The bond lengths of Zn–N are 2.036(2) Å and 2.076(2) Å, which is a little longer than those of Zn–O distances [1.9178(18) Å and 1.9394(17) Å] (Table S2†). In 2, the Zn2+ ions are linked by 1,3-BDC anions and L ligands to create a [Zn-(1,3-BDC)]n linear chain and a wave-like chain [Zn-L]n (Fig. S2a and b†). The above [Zn-(1,3-BDC)]n and [Zn-L]n chains are alternately connected to each other to form a 2D 4-c network (Fig. 2b and S2c†). Finally, the 2D layers are extended into a 2D → 2D parallel interpenetration (Fig. 2c and d). Its catenation is very special that each twisted quadrilateral forms an interlocking structure with another four-membered ring.

Crystal structure of [Zn(L)(1,2-BDC)] (3). 
Polymer 3 is a 4-connected 3D structure derived from [Zn-L]n and [Zn-(1,2-BDC)]n chains (Fig. 3 and S3†). Polymer 3 is crystallized in a monoclinic system having a C2/c space group. The structural unit of 3 includes one Zn2+, one L ligand and one 1,2-BDC anion. Each Zn2+ is 4-coordinated by two pyridyl N atoms from two L ligands with Zn–N distances of 2.0853(16) Å and 2.0933(16) Å, two O atoms from carboxyl O atoms with Zn–O distances of 2.0336(16) Å and 2.0891(19) Å (Fig. 3a) (Table S3†). In 3, each 1,2-BDC anion connects adjacent Zn2+ to form a [Zn-(1,2-BDC)]n wave chain and the distance between Zn⋯Zn is 5.936 Å (Fig. S3a†). The ligand L is connected by Zn2+ to form a [Zn-L]n wave chain with a Zn⋯Zn distance of 17.557 Å (Fig. S3b†). [Zn-(1,2-BDC)]n and [Zn-L]n chains extend in different directions to form a 3D 4-c framework (Fig. 3b and c).

Crystal structure of [Cd(L)0.5(1,2-BDC)(H2O)] (4). 
Polymer 4 is a 1D structure connected by single/double linkers (Fig. 4 and S4†). Polymer 4 is crystallized in a monoclinic system having a space group of P. The structural unit of 4 includes one Cd ion, half a L ligand, one 1,2-BDC anion and one coordination water molecule. Each Cd2+ is 6-coordinated by one pyridyl N atom from one L ligand with a Cd–N distance of 2.2545(14) Å, five O atoms from the carboxyl groups and coordinating water molecule [Cd–O, 2.2328–2.5026 Å] (Fig. 4a) (Table S4†). In 4, a pair of 1,2-BDC connects two Cd2+ ions to form a [Cd-(1,2-BDC)]2 loop with a Cd⋯Cd distance of 6.881 Å, and adjacent loops are connected by the L ligand to form a linear structure with a Cd⋯Cd distance of 20.610 Å (Fig. 4b and S4†).

Effects of carboxylates and metal ions on the structures of title CPs
In order to explore the effects of carboxylic acids on the structure of the title CPs, three dicarboxylates with different angles of 180° (1,4-BDC), 120° (1,3-BDC) and 60° (1,2-BDC) for their two carboxyl groups were selected to combine with Zn2+ and L ligand. As a result, several different structural details were found by a deep analysis (Fig. 5 and Chart S1†). a) The metal–carboxylates chains are changed from zigzag (in 1), linear (in 2) to wave-like (in 3). The corresponding Zn⋯Zn distances are 10.899 Å, 9.602 Å and 5.936 Å. Although the dicarboxylates all adopt the same μ1-η1:η0/μ1-η0:η1 coordination pattern, the torsion angles between the carboxyl groups and benzene rings of dicarboxylates are 23.78° (5.12°), 6.35° (12.39°) and 36.56° (52.59°) for 1–3. b) The metal-L subunits show from (Zn-L)2 loop (in 1) to (Zn-L)n multi-torsion zigzag chains (in 2 and 3). The Zn⋯Zn distances are 13.617 Å, 16.078 Å (or 17.150 Å), and 17.557 Å (or 13.695 Å) for 1 to 3. The two carbonyl oxygen atoms of the L ligand are in trans, trans (trans) and trans (cis) modes. The corresponding pyridine nitrogen atoms are in cis, trans (trans) and trans (trans) modes. The N⋯N distances of the two pyridine rings in the L ligand are 13.424 Å, 13.857 Å (or 14.755 Å) and 14.944 Å (or 12.924 Å). To further demonstrate the effects of carboxylic acid on the structure of complexes, Cd2+ was used instead of Zn2+ to combine with the L ligand and the above-mentioned three dicarboxylates. A 3D NaCl type framework of 1a derived from 1,4-BDC anion having the same structure as that in Luo's report, and a 1D structure of 4 based on 1,2-BDC anion were obtained.29 Unfortunately, only unknown power was obtained when 1,3-BDC was used. Further structural analyses show that the metal–carboxylate subunits are changed from the 2D network based on Cd3 clusters (in 1a) to [Cd(1,2-BDC)]2 loops (in 4). The dicarboxylates adopt the μ2-η1:η1/μ2-η2:η1 and μ1-η1:η1/μ1-η1:η1 coordination patterns, and the torsion angles between the carboxyl groups and benzene rings of dicarboxylates are 4.05° (or 4.20°) and 4.67° (or 69.09°) for 1a and 4. The two carbonyl oxygen atoms of L ligands are both in trans modes. The corresponding pyridine nitrogen atoms are in trans and cis modes. The N⋯N distances of the two pyridine rings in L ligands are 14.426 Å and 16.237 Å. The above comparisons demonstrate that the angles of the carboxyl groups in carboxylic ligands have a greater influence on the structures of the target complexes.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of the effect of the metal and carboxylates on the structures. 
Furthermore, metal ions are proved to be an important factor on the structures of the target complexes. In 1 and 1a, the same L ligand and 1,4-BDC anion were used to combine with different metal ions of Zn2+ and Cd2+. As a result, the structures are changed from 2D 63 network of 1 to 3D NaCl-type framework of 1a. When 1,3-BDC was used, a 2D → 2D parallel polycatenation array of 2 was constructed from Zn2+, but only an unknown powder was obtained from Cd2+. While 1,2-BDC was selected, Zn2+ induced a 3D complicated framework of 3, but only a simple 1D structure of 4 was prepared by Cd2+. Although Zn2+ and Cd2+ are of the same main group with the oxidation state of two, Zn2+ has a smaller coordination radius than Cd2+, which leads to different coordination characteristics of them. In 1–3, the metal ions of Zn2+ all show four-coordination modes. However, in 1a and 4, the coordination numbers increased to six and seven. The above comparison demonstrates that the carboxylates and metal ions are two important factors on the structures of the target complexes.
pH stability of 1–4 and 1a
At room temperature, powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out for 1–4 and 1a with different pH values. The ground samples were soaked in distilled water with pH 1–14 for 24 hours (adjusted with HCl or NaOH) and dried at room temperature. The powders were recovered and the PXRD patterns were determined. As shown in Fig. S5,† the structures of 1, 3 at pH 2–11 and 2, 4, 1a at pH 2–12 have not changed, indicating that all CPs have high stabilities, which provides necessary conditions for subsequent fluorescence detection. The structural collapse of the CPs under the conditions of strong acid and strong base may be attributed to the decomposition of the amide ligand. The slight differences in the alkali resistance of the CPs may be due to the different structures of 1–4 and 1a.
Photoluminescence properties
At ambient temperature, the solid-state fluorescence properties of 1–4, 1a and the free L ligand were recorded under the same experimental conditions (slit: 2.5 nm, voltage: 700) (Fig. 6). When 1–4, 1a and the L ligand were excited at 335 nm, the maximum emission peaks are at 443 nm, 424 nm, 442 nm, 439 nm, 448 nm and 451 nm, respectively. The carboxylates contribute little to the photoluminescence of 1–4 and 1a because of very weak p* → n transitions.44 Thus, the emissions of 1–4 and 1a may be assigned to intraligand charge transitions of the L ligand.45,46 The blue shifts are probably caused by the coordination of L ligands to the metal centers.47 The different fluorescence intensities and positions of the maximum emission peaks of the five complexes may be due to various structures and their various organic components.

Sensing properties for metal cation
Fe3+ is one of the most important elements in the metabolic process of human body. High contents of Fe3+ in the human body can cause certain cancers and certain organ abnormalities. Therefore, it is very important to detect Fe3+ in an aqueous solution.16,33 First of all, the fluorescence sensing abilities of 1–4 and 1a to metal cations were studied according to the literature method.31 Taking 1 as the example, 3 mg fine powders of 1 were dispersed in 3 mL aqueous solution (10−2 M) containing M(NO3)x (M is Al3+, Co2+, Na+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Ni2+, K+, Sr2+ and Fe3+). As shown in Fig. 7a, the order of luminous intensity of 1 is Al3+ > Ba2+ > Sr2+ > Na+ > Zn2+ > K+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Fe3+. The Fe3+ ion shows significant fluorescence quenching effect compared with other cations. Polymers 2–4 and 1a have a similar quenching effect on Fe3+ (Fig. S6†).

In order to understand the quenching process of Fe3+ in more detail, a concentration gradient titration experiment was carried out with 10−3 M Fe3+ solution. It can be seen from Fig. 7b that as the Fe3+ concentration increases, the fluorescence intensity of 1 decreases gradually. The Stern–Volmer constant (KSV, KSV = [I0/I − 1]/C) and the detection limit (3σ/KSV) were 5.8 × 104 and 5.7 × 10−5.48 Polymer 1 has a good linear relationship at low concentrations, which is mainly due to the static quenching of Fe3+ (Fig. 7c).24 The concentration gradient of 2–4 and 1a is similar to that of 1, which proves that the fluorescence quenching effect may be caused by the electron transfer effect between Fe3+ and the ligand L.32 In order to study the anti-interference characteristics of 1, other cations were added at the same time as Fe3+, as shown in Fig. 7d. With the addition of other interference cations, there was a little effect on the quenching effect of Fe3+. Polymers 2–4 and 1a show the same effect (Fig. S7–S10†).
Sensing properties for inorganic anions
Industrial wastewater contains a large number of CrO42−, Cr2O72− and other heavy metal ions, and it is very important to detect them effectively.18,34 Use the same method of the cation to detect 7 kinds of anions, namely, Br−, NO3−, Cl−, CrO42−, Cr2O72−, SO42−, and I−. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the order of fluorescence intensity from strong to weak is NO3− > SO42− > Cl− > Br− > I− > CrO42− > Cr2O72−. CrO42− and Cr2O72− significantly quenched the fluorescence of the 1 suspension. Polymers 2–4 and 1a show similar effects (Table 2, Fig. S11–S14†). As shown in Fig. 8c and d, the luminescence intensity gradually decreases as the CrO42− and Cr2O72− ion concentration increases. Based on the SV plot, the KSV values of CrO42− and Cr2O72− of 1 were calculated as 4.08 × 104 and 2.38 × 104, respectively. The detection limits are 8.1 × 10−5 and 1.39 × 10−4 (Fig. 8e and f). The KSV values and detection limits for 1–4 and 1a are shown in Table 2. The effects of other anions on the detection of CrO42− and Cr2O72− anions by 1–4 and 1a were also studied. As shown in Fig. 8g, h and S11–S14,† when constant concentration of different anions (Br−, NO3−, Cl−, SO42−, I−) were added to the aqueous solution of 1–4 and 1a, these anions hardly affect the emission intensity, which show that these CPs have good selectivity to CrO42− and Cr2O72− in the aqueous solution.

Sensing properties for pesticides
The use of organochlorine pesticides can effectively prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, but overuse of pesticides leaves their residues in the nature, causing adverse effects on the ecosystem and harm to human health. Therefore, rapid and effective detection of pesticides is critical.36,37 In this paper, four organochlorine pesticides (1,2,4-TCB = 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, CB = chlorobenzene, 2,6-DC-4-NA = 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroamine and AT = atrazine) were tested by 1–4 and 1a. Because pesticides are insoluble in water, N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) was used as the solvent. The rest of the steps are the same as the detection of cations. As shown in Fig. 9a, 2,6-DC-4-NA has a significant fluorescence quenching effect compared with other pesticides. In addition, a concentration gradient titration experiment was also performed (Fig. 9b). As 2,6-Dich-4-NA was gradually added, the fluorescence intensity of 1 gradually decreased. When the concentration of 2,6-DC-4-NA reaches 0.6 mM, the 2,6-DC-4-NA shows up to 94.18% quenching efficiency. The KSV value and detection limit are 2.78 × 104 and 1.19 × 10−4 (Fig. 9c). Polymers 2–4 and 1a show similar detection abilities (Table 2, Fig. S16–S19†). As shown in Fig. 9d, when other pesticides were added as interference reagents, there was almost no effect on the quenching effect of 2,6-Dich-4-NA. As displayed in Fig. S20,† it is not difficult to find that the luminous intensity remains almost unchanged after at least 5 cycles, indicating that 1–4 and 1a have the potential to be used as fluorescent sensors to detect pesticides.

Sensing comparison, stability and mechanism
Zn/Cd coordination polymers have been proved as good kinds of sensing materials for anions, small organic molecules, cations, and so on.19,20,32 However, many of them can only be used for the detection of a single species.26,38,40 The title CPs show multi-functional fluorescence responses towards metal ions (Fe3+), anions (CrO42−, Cr2O72−) and pesticides (2,6-DC-4-NA), which is limited. The title CPs were based on different metal ions and carboxylates, and they show different dimensional features, but show similar sensing performances. Therefore, we can speculate that the fluorescence sensing performance is mainly due to the functional amide ligand of L. Thus, the stability and mechanism are explored by taking 1 as an example. First, after putting 1 into the four solutions (Fe3+, CrO42−, Cr2O72−, and 2,6-DC-4-NA) for 24 hours, it can be found that the PXRD patterns are consistent with the initially synthesized complex, which proved that the structure of the complex remained stable in the solvent (Fig. S21†). Then, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the four analytes were tested, as shown in Fig. S22.† It can be found that the absorption spectra of the four analytes overlapped with the emission spectrum of 1, and the competition between the four analytes and 1 inhibited the absorption of excitation energy, leading to resonance energy transfer.49 Finally, the fluorescence lifetime of 1 was tested before and after adding the analytes. The lifetimes are as follows: 7.56 ns (before adding analytes), 7.59 ns (after addition of Fe3+), 7.42 ns (after addition of CrO42−), 7.49 ns (after addition of Cr2O72−), and 7.57 ns (after addition of 2,6-DC-4-NA). As shown in Fig. S23,† the five fluorescence lifetime curves almost completely overlap, indicating that a static quenching effect is formed between 1 and the analytes.50
Conclusions
By adjusting the metal ions and angle of the carboxyl groups of dicarboxylates, four Zn(II)/Cd(II) coordination polymers were prepared under hydrothermal conditions, showing the different structures from 1D structure, 2D network to 3D framework. The position of the carboxyl groups and the coordination characteristics of metal ions were proved to be important factors affecting the structures of complexes. The title coordination polymers display similar multifunctional fluorescence sensing capabilities for metal ions (Fe3+), inorganic anions (CrO42− and Cr2O72−) and pesticides (2,6-DC-4-NA), which proved that proper selection of N-containing ligands is an effective strategy for designing new functional fluorescence sensing materials. More effective structural design and optimization of detection conditions are the future research directions for improving the detection performance of materials.
