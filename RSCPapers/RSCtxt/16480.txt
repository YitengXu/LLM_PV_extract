    , Accepted 24th September 2015First published on 24th September 2015AbstractThe long-term stability of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite in moist environments is a paramount challenge to realise the commercialization of perovskite solar cells. In an attempt to address this concern, we have carried out systematic first-principles studies on the MAPbI3 perovskite with a hydrophobic graphene layer interfaced as a water barrier. We find there is a charge transfer at the graphene/MAPbI3 interface and electrons can be excited from graphene into the perovskite surface, leading to well separated electron–hole pairs, i.e. reduced recombination. By studying the optical properties, we find the hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite displays enhanced light absorption compared with the pristine MAPbI3. Furthermore, from an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, the graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite is confirmed to be able to resist the reaction with water molecules, highlighting a great advantage of this nanocomposite in promoting long-term photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
The third-generation methylammonium lead halide perovskite MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = halogen) based solar cells have undergone rapid and remarkable development over the past five years with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 3.8%1 to a certified value of 20.1%2 in 2014. The significant benefits of these photovoltaic (PV) cells include long charge carrier diffusion lengths, high absorption coefficients, low carrier effective masses, and compatibility with low-cost, solution-based fabrication processes.3–10 In spite of the tremendous progress in the PCE, some great challenges11,12 are still urgent to be addressed toward the worldwide commercialization. One of the most crucial concerns for perovskites is the lack of long-term stability13 under water exposure. In other words, rapid degradation in moist environments has suggested that water may corrode perovskites, which would inevitably limit its outdoor applications. Therefore, how to prevent chemical reaction between water and perovskite surface is vital for the industrial applications of this new PV technology.
Graphene as a two-dimensional one-atom thick sheet of carbon has attracted enormous interest due to its unique properties and a wide variety of potential applications including photodetectors14 and solar cells.15 Graphene has demonstrated exceptional thermal and chemical stability16 under various circumstances. It also possesses excellent optical properties with 97.7% optical transparency, so graphene coating is not expected to degrade the light absorption ability of the underlying materials.17–19 Additionally, the unique properties of hydrophobic graphene may enable it to be an excellent barrier for protecting solar cell materials from unwanted chemical reactions.
Most recently, great experimental efforts have been carried out on the synthesis of hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposites,20 in which enhanced photovoltaic properties have been demonstrated. Theoretical work21 has also been performed to study the structural and electronic properties of graphene/MAPbI3 interfaces and a graphene-induced ferroelectric distortion is identified. However, up to now the underlying mechanism regarding light absorption and the stability of this hybrid system in humid environment still have not been revealed yet. In this work, first-principle calculations are performed to study the nature of interface between hydrophobic graphene and MAPbI3. Two different terminations, namely MAI-terminated (001) and PbI2-terminated (001) surfaces for the tetragonal phase of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 are considered, because the (001) surface is one of the most stable surfaces and the MAI and PbI2 are two precursors utilized in the synthesis of MAPbI3. We first examine the origin of charge transfer at the graphene/MAPbI3 interface. Then the electronic and optical properties of graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite were investigated. Lastly, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are performed to prove the stabilities of graphene/MAPbI3 systems under water exposure.
Computational methods
All the calculations were performed based on density functional theory (DFT) by using the plane wave basis Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code,22,23 implementing the projector augment wave (PAW) method.24 The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof form (GGA–PBE)25 was used as exchange correlation functional for the calculations of geometries, electronic and optical properties of graphene/MAPbI3 system. A damped van der Waals correction was incorporated using Grimme's scheme26 to better describe the non-bonding interaction. Notice that the spin–orbital-coupling (SOC) effect was not taken into consideration in the current calculations because the electrical properties could be well described at PBE level compared with experiments, although it was somewhat fortuitous, i.e., the accidental cancellation of the underestimation by GGA–PBE method.10,27,28 The vacuum space perpendicular to the MAI (001) and PbI2 (001) surface was more than 20 Å, which was enough to avoid the interaction between neighboring slabs. Monkhorst–Pack k-points29 of 4 × 2 × 1 and 8 × 4 × 1 points were used to sample the Brillouin zone for geometry optimization and calculating density of states, respectively. The cut-off energies for plane waves were set to be 500 eV, and the residual force and energy on each atom during structure relaxation were converged to 0.008 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. To understand the mechanism of the interface charge transfer in the hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 system, work functions of the graphene layer, bare MAI-terminated (001) and PbI2-terminated (001) surfaces were calculated via aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level.
A rectangle 2 × 7 graphene layer (a = 4.26 Å, b = 2.46 Å, 56 carbon atoms) was used to match a 1 × 2 × 2 eight-layer MAPbI3 (a = b = 8.74 Å, c = 12.92 Å, from GGA–PBE calculation) surface slab containing 16 Pb, 48 I, 16 C, 16 N and 96 H atoms with six bottom layers fixed at bulk position in a supercell. The whole system contained totally 248 atoms with 864 valence electrons and the lattice mismatch was approximately 1%. It is noticeable that such a mismatch will not affect the electronic property of graphene because the graphene layer on GGA–PBE level can sustain a tensile strain as large as 26.2% with its gapless nature maintained.30
AIMD simulations have been undertaken to study the stability of hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 systems in water environment. The MAPbI3 slab was sandwiched by two layers of graphene as the water barriers and 36 water molecules were placed on the top of graphene layer. The whole system contained 400 atoms with 1304 valence electrons for MAI surface slab and 382 atoms with the same 1304 valence electrons for PbI2 surface slab. Only Γ-point was used for the Brillouin zone sampling and the energy cut-off was 300 eV. During the AIMD simulation, the systems were heated up and maintained at the temperature of 300 K for 6.0 ps in a NVT (canonical) ensemble with a time step of 1 fs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the top view of the graphene/CH3NH3PbI3 interface model used in our calculations. The equilibrium distance between the graphene layer and the MAI/PbI2 surface slab is 2.8/3.8 Å. The interface binding energy was obtained according to the following equationEb = Ecomp − Egraphene − EMAPbI3where Ecomp, Egraphene and EMAPbI3 are the total energy of the relaxed hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 complex, pure graphene sheet and MAPbI3 slab, respectively. The interface binding energy is −1.52 eV for hybrid graphene/MAI surface and −1.79 eV for graphene/PbI2 complex, which indicates very high structural stability. The combination of graphene and MAPbI3 will lead to the structural change in the interface because of the strong interaction. For the optimized graphene/MAI system, the MA molecules in first atomic layer display obvious rotation mainly around the (100) axis compared with the pristine MAPbI3 (see the ESI Fig. S1†). However, such molecular rotation is less significant in the other atomic layers. In addition, the strong interaction also induces the increase of the C–C bond in graphene layer (from 1.424–1.426 Å in pristine graphene to 1.435–1.441 Å in the hybrid system). As for the optimized graphene/PbI2 complex, the rotation of MA molecules can be also found, and the variation of C–C bond length in the graphene layer still occurs (1.435–1.442 Å).

Before identifying the electronic properties of the graphene/MAPbI3 interface, we first check the band structures of these two components based on current GGA–PBE method. We find the PBE calculated band gap of tetragonal MaPbI3 bulk is 1.58 eV (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), which is in agreement with the experiments.31,32 Moreover, the zero band gap nature of graphene can also be well characterised according to our calculations (Fig. S3 in the ESI†), indicating the high reliability for the prediction of MAPbI3 and graphene via this method.
To characterize the electron coupling at the graphene/MAPbI3 interface, 3D charge density difference are plotted by subtracting electronic charge of hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite from pure graphene layer and separated MAI or PbI2 surface slab as shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. For graphene/MAI system, it can be seen that at the equilibrium, charge will redistribute within graphene layer and, all iodine atoms in MAI surface show significant electron accumulation, while all charge depletion occurs around CH3NH3 molecules. For graphene/PbI2 system, charge transfer from the graphene layer to the first layer of PbI2 surface in the ground electronic state can be obviously seen. The dominating charge transfer derives between graphene and iodine atoms at PbI2 surface, and this is able to induce efficient hole accumulation in the graphene layer and electron accumulation at perovskite surface, resulting in the well-separated electron–hole pairs. The electrical conductivity in the interface is also expected to be enhanced because of the high electrical conductivity in the graphene layer.

To understand the origin of such an interface charge-transfer in the hybrid grpahene/MAPbI3 complex, work functions for the graphene layer, MAI and PbI2 surface slabs were calculated by aligning the Fermi level relative to the vacuum energy level (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The work functions for graphene were found to be 4.29, which is closed to the experimental measurements33 and the values for MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 (001) surfaces are 4.60 and 4.75 eV, respectively. The spontaneous interfacial charge transfer from graphene to MAPbI3 can be simply rationalized in terms of the higher work functions on MAI and PbI2-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces which usually act as “electron acceptor”.
To study the electronic properties of the hybrid system, we plot the total density of states (DOS) for free-standing MAPbI3, graphene/MAI (001) and graphene/PbI2 (001) surface as shown in Fig. 3. For graphene/MAI (001) nanocomposite, the Fermi level show downwards shift by around 0.2 eV relative to the Dirac point, while the Dirac point for graphene/PbI2 system remains nearly unchanged. This may be due to the fact that the interlayer distance for graphene/MAI (2.8 Å) is much shorter, which would display much stronger interface interaction compared with that in graphene/PbI2. From the projected density of state (PDOS, see Fig. S5a in the ESI†), we find the strong hybridizations of 6s-orbital of Pb, 5p-orbital of I and 2p-orbital of C (graphene) in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which is mainly due to the high binding energy between graphene and MAI surface. For PbI2 surface (Fig. S5b in the ESI†), by contrast, the band edges of Pb and I display obvious downwards shift about 1 eV and it is clearly visible that 2p-orbital of graphene layer plays a significant role in state accumulation at interface near Fermi level (the inset of Fig. S5b†). It should be noted that the inhomogeneous hybrid system induces charge redistribution in layers, forming interlayer electron–hole puddles, which may significantly enhance the electron conductivity as well as generate new photovoltaic and catalytic activities. Furthermore, the new introduced states from graphene near Fermi level are expected to enhance the conductance in this hybrid system.

Previous studies34,35 have revealed that the charge-transfer complex is able to improve photocatalytic activities under light illumination. The similar behaviour is also found in current hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 systems as shown in Fig. 4. The imaginary part of the dielectric function for MAPbI3 bulk and a hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 were calculated. As GGA–PBE calculation can yield good results of band gap for MaPbI3, we believe the absorption edge of the systems can be well-predicted at this level. It can be seen clearly from the calculated imaginary part of the dielectric function, the redshift of absorption edge is as large as 1.5 eV for the hybrid graphene/MAI and graphene/PbI2 nanocomposite compared with that for the pristine MAPbI3, demonstrating more effective infrared (IR) light absorption and enhanced visible light response. The onsets of optical absorption for hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 lie in the IR light region, which is attributed to the electronic structure of the hybrid systems. According to the PDOS of graphene/PbI2 system, the valence band maximum is totally dominated by 2p orbital of C (C-2p) from graphene while the conduction band minimum is mainly contributed by C-2p from graphene and marginally from Pb-6p. Whereas, the transition from occupied C-2p state to unoccupied C-2p orbital is symmetrically forbidden. Only the transition from C-2p to Pb-6p is allowed. By contrast for graphene/MAI system, absorption peak in low-energy region mainly derives from the transition between C-2p from graphene and I-5p. Clearly, graphene plays an important role in the enhancement of light response and the hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite is expected to display the improved photocurrent activities under the light irradiation.

Having confirmed the excellent optical properties of graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposite, then we turn to estimate their stabilities surrounded by water molecules. The relaxed structures of water adsorbing on the neutral graphene-covered MAI and PbI2 surfaces are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. In these two cases, 36 water molecules are contained in the supercell and the water density is close to the density at room temperature and 1 atm pressure. First the geometries were fully relaxed at 0 K and the minimum distances between hydrogen atoms in water and graphene layers dh–g for the two cases were calculated to be 2.16 and 2.24 Å, respectively. During the AIMD simulation, the distance dh–g and dg–m did not alter significantly and no water molecule was able to reach the perovskite surface and bond with Pb cations (see movie files in the ESI†). Therefore, the graphene-coated strategy can effectively protect MAPbI3 from the reaction with water, thus maintaining the long-term stability of MaPbI3 in the moist environment and enhancing visible and infrared light response.

Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the electronic, optical properties and long-term stability under water exposure in the hybrid graphene/MAPbI3 nanocomposites. The high interface binding energy indicates very high structural stability and the calculated imaginary part of the dielectric function demonstrates the enhanced light absorption compared with the pristine MAPbI3. Furthermore, the electrons and holes can be well separated due to the charge transfer at the graphene/MAPbI3 interface, leading the reduction of electron–hole recombination. Most importantly, we also confirm that the stability of methylammonium lead triiodide in water environment can be maintained via the graphene-coated strategy. Our results offer new theoretical insights and are expected to stimulate new experiments along this direction by fabricating the long-term stable perovskite solar cells in laboratory.
