    , Accepted 13th June 2018First published on 18th June 2018AbstractA novel Z-scheme CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 nanosheets photocatalyst was synthesized by combining the hydrothermal and photo-deposition techniques, where Ag nanoparticles as carrier transport channels significantly improve the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. Outstanding photocatalytic activity was observed, which indicates that the constructed Z-scheme can retain the oxidizing ability of the CdS valence band and reducing ability of the g-C3N4 conduction band. In addition, trapping experiments and ESR measurement reveal that the superoxide radical (˙O2−) and holes (h+) are the predominant active species. This study provides a new approach to perfect the Z-scheme photocatalytic system for application in the efficient treatment of persistent pollutants in wastewater.
1. Introduction
The steadily worsening organic pollution has evoked global awareness due to its environmental impact and possible harm to the ecological system.1–3 Thus, eliminating the environmental risk of organic contaminated wastewater has become an urgent issue for environmental conservation, which requires eco-friendly and high-efficiency methods to solve this problem. Conventional physical, chemical and biological methods are applied to wastewater treatment; however, it is still difficult for them to remove organic pollutants with low concentration from water.4 In the past few years, photocatalysis technology, as a type of advanced oxidation process that is environment-friendly and simple, has been attracting increasing attention in the field of environmental science, which can take full advantage of solar energy to degrade organic pollutants.5–8 The efficiency of solar conversion in photocatalytic systems depends on four stages: visible light absorption, charge separation, charge migration, and charge recombination.9 Heterostructured photocatalytic materials can boost photocatalytic ability by enhancing the visible-light response and separation of electron–hole pairs.10 Among the numerous heterostructured photocatalysts, there are principally two charge transfer types. One type involves the transfer of photogenerated electrons (e−) to a semiconductor with a less negative conductive band (CB), while holes (h+) transfer to a semiconductor with a less positive valence band (VB). This type can enhance the separation ability of e−–h+ pairs, but the transferred photo-induced carriers exhibit lower oxidation and reduction abilities than the original electrons and holes. The other is the Z-scheme type, in which the photogenerated e− from the less negative CB and h+ from the less positive VB will recombine, leaving the e− and h+ with stronger redox ability separately on two semiconductors.11–14
Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) materials, which have a graphite-like layered structure, are novel metal-free visible-light driven photocatalysts worthy of investigation.15–18 g-C3N4 possesses extraordinary thermal stability due to its aromatic C–N heterocycles, visible light response with a narrow band gap of 2.7 eV and unique two-dimensional (2D) layered structure.19,20 Thus, it has been extensively researched as an excellent photocatalyst in applications such as environmental protection,21 CO2 reduction,22 water splitting,23 organic syntheses24 and solar energy conversion.25 Two-dimensional (2D) g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) have attracted increasing attention owing to their large specific surface area, which can increase reaction sites and shorten the charge transport distance.26–29 Recently, Li et al. successfully prepared a sandwich sulfur-doped CdS/Au/g-C3N4 photocatalyst using the bath deposition method. Their photocatalyst displayed better photocatalytic performance for water splitting and dye degradation than binary heterojunction CdS/g-C3N4 and Au/g-C3N4,30 which provided inspiration for us. Among the several noble materials, silver (Ag) is the most suitable for industrial applications owing to its low cost and non-toxicity. Noble metal Ag nanoparticles (NPs) anchored between CdS and g-C3N4 NSs can tightly connect both materials and act as carrier transport channels, which are the recombination centers of photogenerated e− and h+ for Z-scheme photocatalysts, thus reducing the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, Ag NPs can also increase visible light absorption via surface plasmon resonance (SPR).31 Hence, the Ag NPS anchored between g-C3N4 and CdS act as electron transfer mediators, which facilitate charge carrier separation and consequently extend the lifetime of the carriers. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this the first time that Ag NPs were introduced into the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction.
Herein, based on the above considerations, CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were first prepared by combining the hydrothermal and photo-deposition methods. In this multicomponent system, the Ag NPs acted as carrier transport channels to accelerate the separation of electron–hole pairs. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs was investigated by degrading organic contaminants under visible light irradiation. The improved photocatalytic activity mainly resulted from the introduction of Ag NPs. The corresponding possible reaction mechanism was investigated using the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and active species trapping experiments. This study has profound significance due to its insight into the construction of Z-scheme structures with the noble metal nanoparticles acting as carrier transport channels.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
All reagents were used without further purification. Sodium sulfide (Na2S, AR), silver nitrate (AgNO3, AR), p-benzoquinone (99.0%, AR), triethanolamine (TEOA, AR) and isopropanol (IPA, AR) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethanol (C2H5OH, 95.0%) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Melamine, cadmium chloride hemi(pentahydrate) (CdCl2·2.5H2O, 98%), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, 98.0%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30.0%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97.0%), and L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S, AR) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. Tetracycline was analytically pure and used without further purification, and distilled water was used in all the experiments.
2.2. Photocatalyst preparation

2.2.1. Synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets. 
Bulk g-C3N4 was synthesized by calcining melamine. In a typical procedure, 5 g melamine was heated at 550 °C for 4 h in static air at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1. The faint yellow agglomerates obtained were milled into powder after cooling naturally and then, the powder was calcined under the same conditions to acquire g-C3N4 NSs.
The specific surface area of g-C3N4 NSs was increased by the alkaline hydrothermal treatment. Initially, 1.0 g of g-C3N4, 90 mL of deionized water and 0.40 g NaOH were added to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (150 cm3), and the mixture was heated at 110 °C for 18 h. After the solution cooled to room temperature, the product was washed with deionized water several times.


2.2.2. Synthesis of Ag/g-C3N4 NSs. 
Initially, 0.20 g portions of the as-prepared g-C3N4 NSs and 0.05 g AgNO3 were dispersed in 60 mL of deionized water. Then, the solution was stirred for 3 h under 250 W Xe lamp. The sample was washed with deionized water and dried at 80 °C for 12 h.


2.2.3. Synthesis of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs. 
The CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method. Briefly, 0.1833 g of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 0.1756 g of L-cysteine were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water and stirred for 15 min. Subsequently, the pH of the solution was regulated at 7 using 0.1 mol L−1 of NaOH and then, 0.1 g of the as-prepared Ag/g-C3N4 NSs was added under continuous stirring, followed by the addition of 0.045 g of Na2S·9H2O and stirring for 15 min under nitrogen. Finally, the suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The preparation of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs is shown in Scheme 1 (schematic of the formation of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs).

2.3. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the scanning range of 10–80° at a scanning step of 5° min−1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet magna-IR 550 spectrometer using the standard KBr pellet method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250X (America) electron spectrometer using a 150WAl Kα X-ray source. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the solid as-prepared samples were collected using an F4500 (Hitachi, Japan). UV-vis absorption spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-vis 2550 spectrophotometer, in which BaSO4 was used as the internal reflectance standard. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission SEM (Hitachi, Japan) to observe the morphology of the as-prepared samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using an F20 S-TWIN electron microscope (Tecnai G2, FEI Co.) at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The photocurrent was tested on a CHI852C electrochemical workstation and CHI760E workstation. The specific surface areas were characterized using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and a porosity analyzer (NDVA-2000e). The ESR signals of radicals spin-trapped by spin-trap reagent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were examined on a Bruker EPR A 300-10/12 spectrometer.
2.4. Photocatalytic analysis
The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples was evaluated via the degradation of organic contaminants (TC and RhB) under visible light irradiation. A 250 W Xe lamp with a cut-off filter was used to eliminate wavelengths less than 420 nm. Briefly, the photocatalytic degradation system included 100 mL of 20 mg L−1 organic contaminant solution, 0.1 g of photocatalyst and a circulating water system to avoid thermal catalytic effects. Prior to visible light irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred for half an hour in the dark to ensure the organic contaminants reached adsorption–desorption equilibrium on the surface of the photocatalyst. At the same irradiation intervals, 5 mL aqueous solution was sampled and centrifuged to remove the precipitates, which was determined by HPLC.
2.5. Active species trapping and ESR experiments
The radical capture experiments were similar to the photocatalytic degradation experiments. They were carried out using 1 mmol triethanolamine (TEOA, a quencher of h+), 1 mmol isopropanol (IPA, a quencher of ˙OH) and 1 mmol benzoquinone (BQ, a quencher of ˙O2−). To further study the impact of the active species, ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals were tested by the ESR technique using DMPO. Prior to determining ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals, 10.0 mg sample was dissolved in 0.5 mL deionized water and 0.5 mL methanol, separately, and then, 20 μL DMPO added to the above solutions.
2.6. Photo-electrochemical measurements
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the as-prepared samples were determined on a CHI852C electrochemical workstation using 0.5 M NaSO4 electrolyte, 1 cm2 irradiation area under a 150 W xenon lamp, and a standard three-electrode cell. Pt foil was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 10 mg of the composite photocatalyst was dispersed in 5 mL mixed solution of ethanol and ethylene glycol (ethanol:ethylene glycol = 1:1), which was then painted on a 1.5 × 3 cm2 FTO glass electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
The crystalline structure and phase purity of the photocatalysts were investigated by XRD measurements. The X-ray diffraction patterns of g-C3N4 NSs, CdS, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the pure g-C3N4 NSs have two distinct diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ = 27.6° and 13.1°, which are indexed to the (002) and (100) diffraction planes, respectively (JCPDS No. 87-1526). The high intensity (002) peak is attributed to the interlayer stacking reflection of the conjugated aromatic systems, and the low intensity (100) peak is related to the interlayer structure packing.32 Furthermore, the CdS peaks located at 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 43.68°, 47.84° and 51.82° correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (112) crystal planes of the hexagonal structure of CdS, respectively (JCPDS No. 41-1049). For the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, no diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 were observed, which could be attributed to the fact that CdS and Ag were successfully loaded on g-C3N4 and played an inhibitory effect on the crystallization of g-C3N4.33 In addition, from the XRD pattern of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, only the characteristic peaks of CdS were observed, which might be because the Ag layer tightly attached both CdS and g-C3N4 NSs.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the TEM images of the g-C3N4 NSs, which exhibit bat-like structures with ordered distribution. Also, the g-C3N4 NSs consist of thin nanosheets with wrinkles and some black stripes related to the overlapped structures. Usually, the advantages of thin-layer g-C3N4 NSs are related to their large specific area, superior electron transport ability and good charge separation efficiency.34Fig. 2(c) shows the TEM image of the Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, in which Ag nanoparticles are uniformly stacked on the surface of the g-C3N4 NSs due to the photodeposition method. Fig. 2(d) shows the TEM images of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, which illustrates a large area and flake-like structure of g-C3N4 NSs with numerous particles. These particles are the Ag nanoparticles with an approximate size of 30–50 nm, which are uniformly deposited on the surface of the g-C3N4 NSs. Moreover, the Ag nanoparticles are covered by black dots, which are the CdS nanoparticles with diameter of about 20 nm. Also, the electron transfer mediator layer of Ag tightly attached the g-C3N4 NSs and CdS. These observations imply that Z-scheme was successfully constructed, which would improve the separation efficiency of photo-generated e−–h+ pairs. As shown in the HRTEM image of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs in Fig. 2(e), the crystalline interplanar spacings of CdS and Ag could be identified as 0.34 nm and 0.206 nm, which represented the (111) plane of CdS and (110) plane of Ag, respectively.35,36 This indicates that CdS and Ag effectively combined with together. Fig. S1(a)–(c) (ESI†) show the SEM images of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, in which abundant Ag and CdS nanoparticles are adhered on the surface of the g-C3N4 NSs. In addition, the EDS spectrum in Fig. S1(d) (ESI†) shows the C, N, S, Cd and Ag elements in the sample, which implies that the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs photocatalyst was successfully obtained.

To investigate the chemical composition and valence state of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. Fig. 3(a) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cd 3d, which was resolved into two peaks with binding energies of 404.5 eV (Cd 3d5/2) and 411.9 eV (Cd 3d3/2) that were assigned to the characteristic peaks of Cd2+ in CdS.37 The high-resolution spectra of S 2p in Fig. 3(b) present two peaks at 158.3 eV and 162.8 eV, which are attributed to the corresponding S2− species in CdS.38 The XPS spectrum in Fig. 3(c) shows peaks located at 367.2 eV and 373.5 eV corresponding to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, which are attributed to the metallic sliver (Ag0) states.39 The C 1s spectrum in Fig. 3d displays three distinct peaks at 283.7 eV, 285.8 eV and 288.8 eV, among which the peaks at 288.8 and 285.8 eV can be assigned to the sp2 C atoms bonded to N in the sample as C–(N)3, while the peak at 283.7 eV is ascribed to the graphitic or amorphous carbons (C–C bonding) in the as-prepared samples.40

Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of CdS, g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs photocatalyst. For CdS, the absorption peak at 3450 cm−1 should be attributed to the surface-adsorbed H2O.41 The characteristic absorption bands at 1394 and 1052 cm−1 are due to the vibrations of the Cd–S bond.42 The broad peak at 3000–3500 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrational modes of the primary (NH2) and secondary (–NH) amines.43 Moreover, the strong bands at 1200–1700 cm−1 with the characteristic peaks at 1240, 1320, 1407, 1567 and 1640 cm−1 are attributed to the typical stretching vibrations of the C–N heterocycles.44 Several absorption peaks appeared in the g-C3N4 NSs, among which the sharp peak located at 814 cm−1 originates from the vibration of the triazine ring.45

The UV-vis DRS spectra were measured to analyze the optical absorption of CdS, g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, as shown in Fig. 5(a). According to the spectrum of g-C3N4 NSs, the maximum absorption wavelength was approximately 470 nm, which is in agreement with the results reported in the literature.46 The absorption intensity of Ag/g-C3N4 NSs did not change significantly compared with g-C3N4 NSs. Furthermore, the maximum absorption wavelength of CdS was approximately at about 590 nm. The absorption intensity of CdS/g-C3N4 NSs was stronger than that of CdS from 200 to 800 nm after the addition g-C3N4 NSs. Comparing CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs with the other samples, the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs had better absorption in the visible light range, which is due to the surface plasma resonance effect of Ag.47 Furthermore, the plots of (αhν)2versus hν were recorded to determine the band gap values of the as-prepared samples, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The optical bang gap energy (Eg) of semiconductor materials can be calculated using the following formula: αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(1)where Eg, hν, A and α represent the band gap energy, Planck constant, light frequency and absorption coefficient, respectively. n is equal to 1 or 4 depending on whether the semiconductor material is direct transition or indirect transition.48,49 In this study, n is 1 and 4 for CdS and g-C3N4, respectively. Therefore, the band gaps of pure CdS and g-C3N4 were determined to be 2.15 eV and 2.68 eV, respectively.

3.2. Photocatalytic activity measurements

3.2.1. Photocatalytic activity study. 
The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples were evaluated via the degradation of pollutants under visible light irradiation. Adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved between the organic contaminants and photocatalyst for 30 min in the dark. The photocatalytic efficiency was represented as C/C0, where C0 corresponds to the initial concentration of the organic contaminants after adsorption–desorption equilibrium and C is their concentration after visible light irradiation for different time intervals. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the experimental results of the as-prepared samples to degrade TC. The degradation efficiency of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction was superior to that of CdS, g-C3N4 NSs and Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, but the degradation efficiency of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs was higher than that of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction when the Ag NPs embedded between CdS and g-C3N4 NSs. From Fig. 6(b), the photocatalytic degradation reaction rate was depicted by the pseudo-first-order kinetics as follows: (2)where k (min−1) is the reaction rate constant.50,51 Also, it was further observed that the reaction rate constant of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (0.02657 min−1) was higher than that of the other as-prepared samples, which was about 1.17, 1.39, 1.76 and 1.91 times higher than that of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction (0.02276 min−1), CdS (0.01908 min−1), Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (0.01511 min−1) and g-C3N4 NSs (0.01389 min−1), respectively. The removal efficiency of RhB over CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs and g-C3N4 NSs was 81.90%, 77.80%, 66.14%, 44.74% and 20.16%, respectively. Moreover, the reaction rate constant of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (0.01715 min−1) was higher than that of the other samples, which was about 1.02, 1.29, 3.80 and 7.98 times higher than that of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction (0.0168 min−1), CdS (0.01325 min−1), Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (0.00451 min−1) and g-C3N4 NSs (0.00215 min−1). Thus, the degradation experiments directly demonstrate that the Ag NPs functioned as carrier transport channels to modify the Z-scheme heterojunction and effectively boost the photocatalytic activity.

3.2.2. N2 adsorption–desorption. 
To explore the relationship between BET surface area, diameter distribution and photocatalytic activity, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the as-prepared samples were recorded, as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(c). It can be observed that all the isotherms are of type IV in the range of 0.50–1.00 P/P0, which confirms that the samples have mesopores (2-50 nm).52 The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution curves of the samples show that the most probable pore size of g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs is about 30.8 nm, 3.7 nm and 3.6 nm, respectively, indicating that the loading of Ag and CdS had some effect on the pore size of g-C3N4 NSs. In addition, the relative size of BET surface areas were in the order of g-C3N4 NSs (24.05 m2 g−1) (Fig. 7a) < CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (35.39 m2 g−1) (Fig. 7c) < Ag/g-C3N4 NSs (58.73 m2 g−1) (Fig. 7b). Thus, the influence of the BET surface area on improving photocatalytic activity was insignificant. Hence, this result indirectly proves that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the constructed Z-scheme system, which improves the transfer and separation of charge carriers.

3.2.3. Stability. 
The stability and reusability of photocatalysts are crucial parameters for their practical application of environmental pollutant degradation. For each experiment, the photocatalysts were collected, washed, centrifuged, dried and reused. Fig. 8(a) shows the results of five successive recycling experiments for the photocatalytic degradation TC over the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs. The slight catalyst deactivation might be ascribed to the loss of sample during the cycling runs. The photodegradation efficiency of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs towards TC still exceeded 80% after five cycles compared to the first circulation (85.7%). As shown in Fig. 8(b), there were no visible changes in the XRD peaks of the recycled samples. These results indicate that the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs sample is a stable and durable photocatalyst. Hence, the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs exhibited favorable stability and reusability during photocatalytic degradation experiments.

3.3. PL and electrochemistry analysis
Enhancing the efficiency of generating and separating photogenerated charge carriers is principal for photocatalytic reactions, and it was reported that the intensity of the PL emission spectrum could be related to the recombination degree of charge carriers.53 As shown in Fig. 9(a), the g-C3N4 NSs and Ag/g-C3N4 NSs exhibited stronger emission than the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction, which indicates higher recombination rate of electrons and holes. However, the emission from the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs significantly decreased compared to that of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction upon the introduction of Ag NPs, which clearly indicates that Ag impaired the binding efficiency between photogenerated electrons and holes.54

For further exploration of the dynamic electron mobility process, the time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra of the as-prepared samples were introduced and analysed in Fig. 9(b). It is well known that a relatively longer fluorescence lifetime indicates greater separation efficiency of photogenerated e−–h+ pairs, and better photocatalytic activity.55 Furthermore, quenched photoluminescence and reduced decay lifetime confirm the better separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface.56 The time-resolved fluorescence decay curves of g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were fitted by the biexponential function: (3)and the average lifetime was calculated as follows:  where I(t) is the PL intensity at a certain delay time, and A1 and A2 represent the relative weight of the decay components at t = 0.57Table 1 shows the radiative lifetimes from the fitting decay curves of g-C3N4, Ag/g-C3N4, CdS/g-C3N4, and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4, which were 0.81, 1.65, 2.00, and 3.18 ns, respectively. The comparative results demonstrate that the addition of Ag to the photocatalyst increased the photoelectron lifetime.

To better understand the electron transfer process of the as-prepared samples, the transient photocurrent responses of g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were recorded by switching “ON–OFF” cycles under visible light irradiation. The generation of photocurrent was primarily occurred by the diffusion of the photogenerated electrons to the back contact, and the holes were taken up by the holes acceptor in the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 10, the photocurrent response intensity of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction was significantly stronger than that of the g-C3N4 NSs and Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, but it was lower than of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs. The enhanced photocurrent of the as-prepared CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs indicates the more efficient separation and longer lifetime of the charge carriers, which are consistent with the PL results. The enhanced photocurrent can be attributed to the presence of Ag nanoparticles between CdS and g-C3N4 NSs as transport channels, which could facilitate the migration of the photogenerated charge carriers. CdS and g-C3N4 NSs formed a Z-scheme, and the photoelectrons excited from CdS and holes excited from g-C3N4 NSs were quickly transferred to Ag and then annihilated. This process effectively enhanced the separation of photogenerated e−–h+ pairs and extended the photogenerated charge carriers lifetime, further confirming that the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs have potential to be an excellent photocatalyst.

3.4. Photocatalytic mechanism
For further insight into the photocatalytic mechanism, active species trapping experiments were carried out, as depicted in Fig. 11(a) and (b). Triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropanol (IPA) and benzoquinone (BQ) were used as hole (h+), hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and superoxide radical (˙O2−) scavengers, respectively. Under visible light irradiation, the degradation effect of TC decreased slightly from 86.4% to 76.3% after the addition of IPA, which shows that ˙OH only plays a minor role. On the contrary, the TC degradation rates largely decreased to 24.5% and 40.1% upon the addition of BQ and TEOA, respectively, indicating that BQ and TEOA inhibited the degradation of TC. According to these results, it can be concluded that h+ and ˙O2− were the predominant reactive species in the process of photocatalytic degradation.

It is important to detect the photocatalytic intermediate products. Thus, the possible intermediate products from the degradation of tetracycline were studied by mass spectrometry with different degradation times. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the prominent anion with an m/z of 445 was the deprotonated tetracycline molecular ion,58 and tetracycline was fragmented into small molecules during the process of degradation, as shown in Fig. 12. It was found that the intermediate product A1 (m/z = 362) was obtained by breaking the naphthalene ring under alkaline conditions.59 Then, the lactone structure product A2 (m/z = 361) was obtained by the formation of hydroxyl electron rich groups (negative oxygen ions) from nucleophilic reaction with carbonyl, which became product A3 (m/z = 318) by the loss of N-methyl groups. Furthermore, another degradation pathway was that tetracycline was fragmented into the product B1 (m/z = 345) due to the dissociation of the –CH3, –N(CH3)2 and –CO(NH2) groups, and it became product B2 (m/z = 329) from the loss of –OH, which decomposed into product B3 (m/z = 274) through ring opening reactions.60 The product C3 (m/z = 246) was obtained by the loss of –OH and –COH groups. Product C1 (m/z = 429) originated from tetracycline (m/z = 445) by the loss of –OH during the photocatalytic reaction, and the product C1 transformed into product C2 (m/z = 415). Finally, tetracycline was gradually broken down into small molecules as the photocatalytic reaction progressed.

Transient radical formation was probed using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a spin trapping reagent, followed by ESR characterization, as shown in Fig. 13. As shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b), almost no characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙O2− and DMPO–˙OH were observed for all the as-prepared samples in the dark. In contrast, the DMPO–˙O2− and DMPO–˙OH adducts over g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were detected in the methanol dispersion and aqueous dispersion under visible light irradiation, respectively (Fig. 13(c) and (d)). This indicates that visible light illumination is essential for the generation of ˙O2− and ˙OH.

As shown in Fig. 13(c), the intensity of the characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙O2− over the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction was stronger than that of g-C3N4 NSs and Ag/g-C3N4 NSs. However, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙O2− over CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs surpassed that of the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs when the Ag NPs was inserted in the CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction, implying that the Ag NPs modification greatly increased the molecular oxygen activation ability. Furthermore, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of DMPO–˙OH over g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, CdS/g-C3N4 NSs and CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs were relatively weaker under light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 13(d); nevertheless, the peak intensity of CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs was also stronger than that of other samples. The experimental results show that ˙OH was not the dominant active species. Therefore, it can be concluded that ˙O2− and h+ play important roles in the photodegradation process. Moreover, the same result was also confirmed by the trapping experiments (Fig. 11).
According to the abovementioned experimental results for the charge carrier behaviors and band energy levels, schematic diagrams of the charge carrier migration process on the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs are proposed in Fig. 14. The relative positions of the energy bands of CdS (2.15 eV) and g-C3N4 (2.68 eV) are known according to the results in the previous reports.61–64 In the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs Z-scheme heterojunction, Ag NPs are paired between CdS and g-C3N4 NSs, and the electrons of CdS and holes of g-C3N4 NSs are annihilated in the Ag NPs. This enhances the redox ability of the photogenerated e− and h+, followed by an increase in the lifetime of the photoelectrons, which combine with more molecular oxygen. This results from the fact that the CB potential of CdS is more negative than that of Ag due to its high Schottky barriers at the interface of the semiconductor–metal. Thus, the photoinduced e− from CdS shifts to metallic Ag and combine with the h+ from g-C3N4. Simultaneously, the strong reductive e− is left on the conduction band of g-C3N4 NSs and the strong oxidizing h+ is left on the valence band of CdS. Therefore, it is easy to degrade TC to CO2, H2O and other small molecules. The reaction process is as follows (eqn (4)–(8)): g-C3N4 + hν → e− (g-C3N4) + h+ (g-C3N4)(4) CdS + hν → e− (CdS) + h+ (CdS)(5) h+ (g-C3N4) + e− (CdS) → Recommendation(6) O2 + e− (g-C3N4) → ˙O2−(7) h+ (CdS) + ˙O2− + pollutants → Oxidative products(8)

4. Conclusion
In summary, a novel CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs Z-scheme heterostructure was synthesized via a hydrothermal method combined with a photo-deposition process. The CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of organic pollutants, which was higher than that of the CdS, g-C3N4 NSs, Ag/g-C3N4 NSs, and CdS/g-C3N4 NSs heterojunction. Its enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to its modification with Ag NPs, which were anchored between CdS and g-C3N4 NSs and acted as carrier transport channels. Moreover, the Z-scheme carriers transfer mechanism of the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs photocatalyst increased the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes and boosted its redox ability, therefore enhancing its photocatalytic degradation activity. Moreover, the CdS/Ag/g-C3N4 NSs composite exhibited favourable stability under visible light irradiation. This study may provide a new idea for the practical application of noble metals in the photocatalysis field and promote the development of Z-scheme composite photocatalytic systems.
