    , Accepted 25th September 2019First published on 26th September 2019AbstractPhase change materials (PCMs) exhibit wide application prospects in many fields related to energy utilization and management and attract increasing interest. In this work, through the graphene oxide (GO)-assisted dispersion technology, GO/boron nitride (BN) nanosheets were incorporated into melamine foam and successfully deposited on the surface of the foam framework after hydrothermal reaction. Through the following freeze-drying and carbonization treatment, the composite MF/rGO/BN aerogels were obtained with integrated hybrid rGO/BN frameworks. The composite PCMs were prepared through encapsulating polyethylene glycol (PEG) within the hybrid aerogels. The encapsulation stability and thermal properties of the composite PCMs were systematically investigated. The composite PCM sample containing the highest content of rGO/BN exhibited excellent encapsulation stability, high thermal conductivity (up to 0.79 W m−1 K−1), high phase change enthalpy (160.7 J g−1) with the retention of 90.8% of the pure PEG, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Further results clearly showed that the composite PCMs had excellent light-to-heat energy transition ability and could be used as a thermal management component to suppress the overheating of devices during the operation process, or to supply energy for thermoelectric devices under emergency conditions to ensure a continuous power supply sustained for a certain time until the safeguard procedures are adopted.
1. Introduction
Phase change materials (PCMs), which have the ability to store and release thermal energy, have attracted increasing attention of researchers in the past few years due to their great potential applications in various fields, such as energy conservation and environmental protection related to ‘green building’,1,2 waste heat reclamation related to a manufacturing factory,3 temperature protection and maintenance related to electronic devices,4,5etc. Inorganic PCMs and organic PCMs are the two typical kinds of PCMs, in which the storage and release of thermal energy are achieved usually through the solid–liquid phase transition.6 Although inorganic PCMs, such as hydrous salts, exhibit high latent heat and low manufacturing cost, their drawbacks are also apparent, such as a supercooling phenomenon, phase separation, low reusability, and possibly high erosion, which greatly restrict their application in real engineering.3 Therefore, most of the research studies have been focused on developing organic PCMs recently, such as paraffin wax,7 aliphatic acids,8 polyhydric alcohols9 and polymers with low melting points,10 due to their various advantages, such as stable physicochemical properties, no supercooling and phase separation phenomena, low erosion and good reusability.6 However, organic PCMs also exhibit apparent drawbacks, such as low thermal conductivity, high leakage risk, etc.11 Obviously, it is of great significance to enhance the thermal conductivity and encapsulation ability of organic PCMs.
Incorporating thermally conductive fillers into organic PCMs is a common method to enhance the thermal conductivity of composite PCMs.12,13 However, high thermal conductivity is usually achieved with an extremely high filler content, leading to the decreased PCM content and capacity of heat storage of the composite PCMs.14,15 Therefore, constructing a highly efficient conductive pathway in the composite PCMs at low filler contents becomes one of the key points to maintain both high thermal conductivity and large heat latent. Recently, a method of pre-constructing the frameworks of thermally conductive fillers and then impregnating organic PCMs into the pores of the frameworks has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to enhance the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs.16–18 Specifically, aerogels and foams are believed to be ideal materials to provide frameworks and porous structures, in which the pore size is easily tailored from the nanoscale to microscale.19,20 Once the frameworks of the aerogels or foams are constructed by the thermally conductive fillers, they can be used to prepare the composite PCMs.7,21,22 Furthermore, the frameworks of thermally conductive fillers also facilitate the improvement of the encapsulation stability of the organic PCMs.7,23
The frameworks of the aerogels and foams can be constructed by various thermally conductive fillers, such as graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs),15,24 carbon nanotubes (CNTs) including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),12,25 boron nitride (BN),26,27etc. Different from the simultaneous enhancement in the thermal and electrical conductivities of the composite PCMs by addition of carbon-based fillers, BN nanosheets usually endow the composite PCMs with high electrical insulation properties, which makes the composite PCMs suitable for great applications in microelectronic devices. However, BN nanosheets exhibit an inert surface feature and are difficult to be dispersed in most of the solvents on the one hand. On the other hand, there is no strong interaction between BN nanosheets and the self-supported BN frameworks are difficult to be constructed.28–30 This indicates that fabricating BN-based aerogels or foams is relatively difficult. Hence, other fillers or templates are used to assist in the construction of the BN frameworks.31–33 For example, An F et al.34 fabricated an anisotropic hybrid aerogel consisting of graphene and BN for the first time through hydrothermal treatment, air drying and carbonization at 2000 °C, successively. Yang J et al.23 fabricated a three-dimensional oriented hybrid porous scaffold of graphene oxide (GO) and BN. Xue Y et al.35,36 fabricated isotropic BN foam on a template of a silica aerogel or BN-based porous monolith through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. These frameworks constructed with BN and other thermally conductive fillers exhibit high efficiency in enhancing the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs.17,37,38 However, the effect of the BN frameworks on the properties of the PCMs has been less researched, and especially few research studies have been performed to investigate the applicability of the BN-based PCMs in thermal management and energy supply of microelectronic devices.
In this work, a commercial melamine foam (MF), which had high porosity and large pore size, was used as the template for the construction of the BN-based framework. GO was used to assist the impregnation of BN nanosheets into the MF and then deposition on the surface of the MF framework. Here, GO acted as a bridge between MF frameworks and BN nanosheets. The oxygen-containing groups of GO can interact with the nitrogen-containing groups of the MF.39 Besides, GO can also promote the dispersion of BN nanosheets in water due to the excellent dispersion ability of GO originating from the large number of oxygen-containing groups40,41 and the van der Waals interactions or hydrophobic interactions between GO and BN.33 Then, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was impregnated into the carbonized MF/rGO/BN aerogel to prepare the composite PCMs. PEG is a common PCM having many merits, such as large phase change enthalpy, narrow phase change temperature range, and stable chemical and physical properties. Furthermore, the most important point is that the interaction between BN or GO and PEG occurs very well through the van der Waals force, which has been proved in previous research studies.13,15,42 It is interesting to observe that the composite PCMs exhibit high thermal conductivity, high encapsulation stability and high latent heat. Furthermore, the composite PCMs exhibit excellent light-to-heat energy transition ability and can be used to provide energy for thermoelectric devices so that the continuous power supply could be sustained under emergency conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Melamine foam (MF) was purchased from Runde Trading Co. Ltd (China). Hexagonal BN nanosheets with a purity of 99.5% and an average size of 10–15 μm were purchased from Qinhuangdao ENO High-Tech Materials Development Co., LTD (China) and its typical morphology is shown in Fig. S1.† GO was prepared in our lab according to the modified Hummers’ method using the natural graphite powder, which was obtained from Qingdao Heilong Co. Ltd (China). The typical morphology of GO is exhibited in Fig. S2,† and the average size is about 0.5 μm. The oxygen-containing groups of GO were about 40 wt%, which was confirmed through the thermogravimetric analysis measurement.43 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China), and the weight-average molecular weight was 6000 g mol−1. A polycrystalline silicon solar cell (30 mm × 25 mm) was purchased from Tianshikai Co. Ltd (China).
2.2. Preparation of the MF-supported rGO/BN frameworks
The MF-supported rGO/BN frameworks were fabricated through the procedures shown in Fig. 1. First, certain amounts of GO and BN were dissolved in deionized water with the aid of stirring for 0.5 h and then ultrasonication treatment for 1 h (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, a certain amount of vitamin C that was twice the GO mass was added into the solution and the solution was further stirred for 3 min. After that, a rectangular MF sample was immersed in the GO/BN solution and pressed several times to ensure full impregnation of the GO/BN solution into the MF (Fig. 1b). Then, the temperature of the solution was increased up to 90 °C and was maintained for 12 h and, under these conditions, partially reduced GO (rGO) and the black MF/rGO/BN composite hydrogel were obtained (Fig. 1c). The volume of the hydrogel was similar to that of the as-prepared MF sample. The composite hydrogel was then dialyzed using deionized water several times until the pH value of dialysis was 7. Then, the composite hydrogel was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried using an FD-1A-50 freeze-drying machine (Beijing Boyikang Instrument, China) set at −40 °C for 48 h to obtain the MF/rGO/BN aerogel (Fig. 1d). Finally, the composite aerogel was carbonized at 800 °C for 3 h in an argon atmosphere (Fig. 1e). During the carbonization process, apparent volume shrinkage was observed for the carbonized aerogel. The MF/rGO/BN composite aerogel was named M-GxBy, while the carbonized aerogel was named C-GxBy, where x and y represent the concentrations (mg ml−1) of GO and BN in the GO/BN solution, respectively. For example, M-G0.5B1 represented the composite aerogel prepared using the GO/BN solution with a GO concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1 and a BN concentration of 1 mg ml−1.

(a) The GO/BN solution and MF sample were prepared; (b) the cubic MF sample was immersed in the GO/BN solution and GO/BN was impregnated into the MF sample; (c) hydrothermal reaction was induced to obtain the composite hydrogel; (d) the pre-frozen hydrogel was freeze-dried to obtain the composite aerogel; and (e) the composite aerogel was further carbonized at 800 °C. 
2.3. Preparation of the composite PCMs
To prepare the composite PCMs, the carbonized MF/rGO/BN composite aerogel was immersed in the PEG melt at 80 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven to ensure the impregnation of PEG into the composite aerogel. After that, the sample was taken out and cooled down to room temperature. The sample notation of the composite PCMs was then defined as P-GxBy, where x and y had the same meaning compared with M-GxBy and C-GxBy. For comparison, the P-Gx PCMs, which contained only rGO, were also prepared through similar preparation procedures.
2.4. Microstructure characterization
The dispersion states of GO, BN and GO/BN in the solution were roughly evaluated using a UV-2600 ultraviolet spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, Japan). The concentrations of the solutions were set at 0.5, 3 and 0.5/3 mg ml−1 for GO, BN and GO/BN solutions, respectively. After being ultrasonically treated for 1 h, the solutions were analysed. After that, the solutions were statically placed for 24 h, and then further analysed using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer.
The morphologies of the composite aerogels before and after carbonization as well as the composite PCMs were characterized using a Fei Inspect scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI, the Netherlands) at an operating voltage of 20 kV. The sample was coated with a thin layer of gold before SEM characterization. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) measurements were also carried out during the SEM characterization process.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TG 209F1 Iris thermo-analyzer instrument (NETZSCH, Germany). About 8 mg of the sample was heated from 30 to 800 °C under air atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
The melting and crystallization behaviors of the composite PCM samples were measured using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC2500 thermal analyzer (TA instruments, USA). About 5–8 mg of the sample was heated from 0 to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
A Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR) iS50 (Thermo Nicolet, USA) was used to measure the sample before and after cycling measurements. The measurement was carried out at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in transmission mode.
2.5. Performance measurements
The thermal conductivity of the sample was measured using a Transient Hot Disk TPS 2200 instrument (Hot Disk AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). The measurement was carried out according to the testing standards of ISO22007-2.2. Furthermore, the heat diffusion of the sample during the heating and cooling processes was recorded using an infrared video camera (FLIR T460).
The dimensional retention rate of the sample was transformed from its gap value, which was obtained using a stress-controlled rheometer DHR-1 (TA Instrument, USA). To obtain the gap value, the sample was heated from 30 to 90 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere under a constant pressure of 1 N.
Light-to-heat energy conversion measurement was carried out using simulated sunshine, which was achieved through using an HSX-F300 xenon lamp (Beijing Nbet Technology Co., China) as the light source and the light was filtered using an AM1.5 filter lens. The light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. The temperature evolution of the composite PCM sample was recorded using a thermoelectric thermometer. During the measurements, the samples were cylindrical in shape and had a mass of about 1.2 g, and the ambient temperature was about 15 °C.
The potential application of the composite PCM sample in a power system under emergency conditions for continuous power supply was evaluated through a simple device composed of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell, a composite PCM sample, a thermoelectric unit and a cooling fin. Simulated sunshine was used to provide energy for two 100 Ω resistors, and the voltage and current were recorded using a Keithley (DAQ6510) recorder, respectively. To eliminate the thermal contact resistance, thermally conductive silicone grease was coated on the interface between the composite PCM sample and the solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Dispersion of BN by GO and morphologies of the MF-supported rGO/BN frameworks
GO-assisted dispersion of BN in water was firstly confirmed through UV-vis measurements as shown in Fig. 2. As expected, GO exhibits good dispersion in aqueous solution and shows intensive absorption. After being statically placed for 24 h, the GO solution still shows high adsorption intensity. BN shows almost no adsorption and exhibits poor dispersion in aqueous solution. The GO/BN solution also exhibits intensive absorption in its UV-vis spectrum after being ultrasonically treated and the absorption is mainly derived from GO. However, the solution exhibits a very low absorption intensity after being statically placed for 24 h. This indicates that the dispersion of GO/BN in aqueous solution is not stable and the amount of suspended GO in the solution also reduced. In other words, nearly all the GO nanosheets precipitate at the bottom of the bottle due to the presence of BN as shown in the inset photographs in Fig. 2. This phenomenon would be attributed to the interaction between BN and GO and the poor dispersion of BN in water. Here, the concentration of GO (0.5 mg mL−1) was smaller than that of BN (3 mg mL−1) in the GO/BN solution. During the static treatment process, GO also precipitated when BN precipitated. The dispersion states of pure BN and GO/BN at higher concentrations, i.e. 18 mg mL−1 and 3/18 mg mL−1, respectively, were also detected, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† It is clearly seen that even after being statically placed for 1 month, GO/BN exhibits homogeneous dispersion in aqueous solution, which confirms that a higher GO content facilitates the dispersion stability of BN in aqueous solution.
 Fig. 2  Variations of the UV-vis spectra of BN and GO/BN particles in the water solution as prepared and after being statically placed for 24 h. The inset photographs show the changes of the solutions. Here, the concentration of GO was kept at 0.5 mg mL−1 while that of BN was maintained at 3 mg mL−1 in all solutions. 

Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of the pure MF, M-G0.5B1 and C-G0.5B1 composite aerogels. The pure MF exhibits the typical porous structure with a smooth framework surface and an aperture size of about 100–200 μm (Fig. 3a and d). After incorporation of rGO/BN, the composite aerogel still shows the porous structure (Fig. 3b) with a similar aperture size. This indicates that the successive pressing, adsorption and freeze-drying treatment do not apparently change the porous structure. At higher magnification (Fig. 3e), one can clearly see that the rGO and BN nanosheets attach tightly to the surface of the MF framework. Specifically, many rGO nanosheets locate around BN nanosheets, which not only confirms the good interaction between rGO and BN but also indicates that the deposition of BN on the MF frameworks is achieved by rGO. Furthermore, it is found that not all the framework surface is covered by rGO/BN nanosheets. In other words, the conductive pathways formed by rGO and BN are not integrated. The carbonized composite aerogel shows the apparently different morphologies as shown in Fig. 3c and f. First, the porous structure is still present in the composite aerogel, but the pore size is greatly reduced to 10–100 μm, confirming the volume shrinkage during carbonization at 800 °C as shown by the inset photographs in Fig. 1e. Second, it is found that the carbonized composite aerogel still shows the framework structure (Fig. 3f). Third, the template of MF cannot be differentiated clearly and simultaneously; rGO and BN form the framework structure with close contact of rGO and BN nanosheets. In other words, the hybrid frameworks are formed by rGO and BN nanosheets, which ensures the construction of the three dimensional (3D) thermal conduction pathway in the whole aerogel sample. Factually, pure MF nearly disappears after being carbonized at 800 °C as confirmed by Fig. S4.† Therefore, it can be deduced that the content of carbonized MF in the carbonized composite aerogel can be ignored. The TGA curves of the representative M-G3B18 and C-G3B18 composite aerogels are shown in Fig. S5.† The largely enhanced starting decomposition temperature of C-G3B18 (515 °C) compared with that of M-G3B18 (190 °C) further confirms the reduction of GO and the disappearance of MF during the carbonization treatment.

To further confirm the role of GO in promoting the dispersion of BN and the distribution of the two fillers in the composite aerogel, the EDS mapping measurement was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. At least two features need to be noticed. First, before carbonization or after carbonization, both the oxygen and boron elements mainly locate on the frameworks of the MF homogeneously. Second, the distribution of the boron element is almost coincident with that of the oxygen element. Third, the reduction of the oxygen element before and after carbonization also confirms the further reduction of rGO during the carbonization process. Furthermore, N mapping is also performed as shown in Fig. S6,† which is similar to B mapping. The EDS mapping results not only confirm that GO can help the dispersion of BN, but also manifest that the preparation method is highly efficient in tailoring the distribution of rGO/BN nanosheets on the framework of the MF.

3.2. Microstructure of the composite PCM samples
The morphologies of the representative composite PCM samples were characterized using SEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a and e show the morphologies of the representative P-G3 sample obtained at different magnifications. PEG exhibits homogeneous distribution in the sample while the frameworks of rGO can be differentiated at higher magnification. In the P-GxBy samples, BN nanosheets can be clearly differentiated because of their smooth surface feature. The more the BN nanosheets, the more the integration of the network structure of BN in the composite. This indicates that higher thermal conductivity can be achieved at higher BN contents.

3.3. Encapsulation stability
One of the most important parameters for evaluating the applicability of the organic PCMs is the encapsulation stability.1,44 Here, the encapsulation stability of the representative composite PCM samples was evaluated through different methods. First, the dimensional retention rate of the sample during the heating process was measured at a load of 1 N. As shown in Fig. 6a, a pure PEG sample exhibits no dimensional retention rate after the temperature is higher than its melting point, while all the composite PCM samples containing fillers exhibit high dimensional retention rates, indicating excellent dimensional stability. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6b, after being placed on a hot-stage set at 90 °C for a certain time, the dimensions of the pure PEG sample are completely destroyed and it melts completely on the hot-stage, while the P-G3B6 and P-G3B18 samples still show excellent dimensional stability and there is no PEG leakage. Even if a weight of 200 g is placed on the sample and maintained at 90 °C for 10 min, there is still no apparent leakage of PEG, and the weight losses of the PCM samples are only about 0.4% and 0.2% for the P-G3B6 and the P-G3B18 samples, respectively, which further confirms the excellent encapsulation stability of the composite PCM samples attributed to the dense rGO/BN frameworks. This also suggests that the hybrid framework shows a favorable interaction with the PEG and significantly improves the form stability of the composites.
 Fig. 6  (a) Variations of the dimension retention rates of the pure PEG and the representative PCMs as indicated during the heating process at a load of 1 N, and (b) appearances of the representative samples at different temperatures and a pressure of a weight of 200 g. 
3.4. Thermally conductive properties

Fig. 7a shows the variations of the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM samples. The pure PEG sample shows a low thermal conductivity (k, W m−1 K−1), i.e. 0.30 W m−1 K−1. Although incorporating only rGO facilitates the enhancement of k, the degree of the enhancement is relatively low. For example, the P-G3 sample shows a k of about 0.35 W m−1 K−1, which is only about 16.67% higher than that of the pure PEG sample. The slight enhancement of k in the P-Gx samples is mainly attributed to the low thermal conductivity of rGO. Here, although rGO was partially reduced during the hydrothermal reaction and further reduced during the carbonization process, the recovery degree of rGO is still very small, much lower than that of graphene.2,43 For the composite PCM samples containing both rGO and BN, there are several features that need to be noticed. First, a higher content of rGO/BN leads to a higher k. For example, the P-G0.5B1 sample shows a k of 0.40 W m−1 K−1, while the k is enhanced up to 0.79 W m−1 K−1 in the P-G3B18 sample. Second, k gradually increases with an increase in the BN content in the composite PCM samples with the same rGO content. Third, the plots of k versus the rGO/BN content show a larger slope for the composite PCM samples with higher rGO contents. The variations of k indicate that dense thermal conduction pathways form in the composite PCM samples with higher rGO/BN contents on the one hand. On the other hand, a higher rGO content is more favorable for the formation of the more integrated rGO/BN conductive pathway, possibly due to the better dispersion of BN induced by the higher rGO content as shown in Fig. S3.†
 Fig. 7  (a) Comparison of thermal conductivities of the pure PEG and composite PCM samples as indicated, and (b) digital/infrared photographs showing the surface temperature evolution of the representative samples as indicated with the increasing heating or cooling time. Samples were placed on a hot-stage which was set at 50 °C; after the sample temperature was close to the temperature of the hot-stage, the samples were then transferred to the other stage whose temperature was about 22 °C. 
Furthermore, there is another interesting phenomenon that needs to be noticed. From Fig. 7a one can also see that in the PCM samples with similar BN contents, increasing the rGO content leads to a slight decrease of the thermal conductivity. For example, the P-G3B12 sample shows lower thermal conductivity (0.65 W m−1 K−1) compared with the P-G2B12 sample (0.71 W m−1 K−1). It is suggested that the mechanism is mainly attributed to the large interfacial thermal resistance between rGO and BN. As mentioned above, the reduction of rGO is not complete during the carbonization process that was carried out at 800 °C and, under this condition, there is large interfacial thermal resistance between rGO and BN on the one hand.34 On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of rGO is much smaller than that of BN. The more the rGO in the PCMs, the larger the interfacial thermal resistance is. Consequently, the positive role of rGO in enhancing the thermal conductivity of the PCMs is covered up by the negative effect of the increased interfacial thermal resistance on the thermal conductivity of the PCMs with the increase in the rGO content.
The heat diffusion behaviors of the representative composite PCM samples during the heating and cooling processes were also detected, and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. During the heating process, the composite PCM samples with higher contents of rGO/BN exhibit relatively higher heating rates. For example, after being placed on the hot-stage that was set at 50 °C for 50 s, the highest temperature of the upper surface of the pure PEG sample was about 37.3 °C, while for the P-G3B6 and P-G3B18 samples, the highest temperatures were enhanced up to 41.1 and 43.3 °C, respectively. Furthermore, it can be seen that a higher rGO/BN content leads to more homogeneous distribution of surface temperature, which can be attributed to the dense thermal conduction pathways in the composite PCM samples. During the cooling process, although the P-G3B6 and P-G3B18 samples had higher surface temperatures, higher cooling rates were achieved for the two samples compared with that of the pure PEG sample, especially in the early stage of the cooling process. The variations of the surface temperature of the samples indicate that denser rGO/BN frameworks endow the samples with higher heating diffusion rates.
3.5. Heat energy storage ability
Phase change enthalpy represents the heat energy storage ability of the PCMs.23,44 Here, the phase change enthalpies, including the melting enthalpy (ΔHm, J g−1) and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc, J g−1), of the representative samples were measured by using DSC, and the results are shown in Fig. 8, and the corresponding thermal parameters obtained during the DSC measurements are listed in Table 1. Compared with the pure PEG sample, which shows a crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting point (Tm) of 34.0 and 59.0 °C, respectively, the composite PCM samples show hysteretic Tc and Tm with different extents on the one hand. This may be the result of the limitation effect of the hybrid filler network on the mobility of the polymer chains, especially in the crystallization and melting processes of the PEG.45 On the other hand, the higher rGO/BN content leads to lower ΔHc and ΔHm. For example, the P-G3B18 sample, which exhibits the highest thermal conductivity among all the composite PCM samples, shows a ΔHm of 160.7 J g−1, which is about 90.8% (phase change enthalpy retention, φ) of that of the pure PEG sample. The reduction of the phase change enthalpies of the composite PCM samples is possibly attributed to the presence of the dense rGO/BN frameworks, which reduces the PEG content and restricts the growth and integration of the PEG spherulites.14 Similar phenomena have also been widely reported in the literature.15,46

The heat energy storage stability was also evaluated through cycling measurements. As shown in Fig. 9a, even after cycling 50 times, the P-G3B18 sample still shows high ΔHc and ΔHm, indicating its excellent stability in heat energy storage. Furthermore, the P-G3B18 sample was also characterized using FTIR before and after cycling measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen that after being heated and cooled 50 times, the P-G3B18 sample shows nearly no change in the FTIR spectrum, which further confirms the excellent chemical and thermal stability of the composite PCM samples.

To comprehensively understand the role of the hybrid rGO/BN frameworks in thermal conductivities and the phase change enthalpies of the composite PCM samples, a simple comparison has been done between the results obtained in this work and the results reported in the literature7,12,13,27,47–50 as shown in Table 2. It is worth noting that the thermal conductivities of the samples are greatly dependent upon the measuring methods and the instruments and, therefore, it is inappropriate to directly compare the thermal conductivities of the samples that have been reported in different literature studies. Here, an enhancement coefficient (λ) is defined to show the efficiency of the fillers in enhancing the thermal conductivity of the composite PCM samples: (1)where kc and ko represent the thermal conductivities of the PCM samples containing fillers and the pure PCM sample, and φ represents the weight fraction (%) of the fillers in the composite PCM samples. From Table 2 it can be seen that the composite PCM samples prepared in this work exhibit relatively large λ and high φ among all the listed composite PCM samples. Although the composite PCM samples prepared from BN foam and paraffin showed the largest λ, they showed lower φ compared with the composite PCM sample prepared in this work.27 In other words, the MF-templated hybrid rGO/BN frameworks endow the composite PCM samples with excellent comprehensive thermal properties.

3.6. Potential application in microelectronic devices
The above results clearly show that through constructing the hybrid rGO/BN frameworks, the composite PCM samples show good thermal conductivity, excellent encapsulation ability and high phase change enthalpy. This indicates that the composite PCMs may be applied in heat management of microelectronic devices.51,52 Here, the light-to-heat energy transition ability of the composite PCM samples was firstly measured. Fig. 10 shows the temperature evolution of the pure PEG and the representative composite PCM samples with time. The pure PEG sample shows a weak light-to-heat energy transition ability. The surface temperature of the pure PEG sample slightly increases with an increase in the irradiation time. After being irradiated for 1800 s with simulated sunshine, the surface temperature is only about 44.8 °C, which is still lower than the Tm of the pure PEG (59.0 °C). This indicates that no phase change occurs for the pure PEG sample. However, largely enhanced heating rate and surface temperature are achieved for the composite PCM samples. For example, after being irradiated for only 300 s, the surface temperature of the P-G3B18 sample quickly increases up to 55 °C, which is higher than the starting temperature of melting of PEG as shown in Fig. 8a, indicating the melting of some PEG with a smaller lamellar thickness.53 That is, a phase change has already occurred at this temperature. Further increasing the irradiation time leads to a slight enhancement of the surface temperature for a long time and in this process, the light energy provided by the xenon lamp is transformed into heat energy and then stored through melting of PEG crystallites. As shown in Fig. 10, a plateau representing the solid–liquid phase change is present in the temperature evolution curve. After all the PEG crystallites are melted completely, the composite PCM samples show further enhanced surface temperature with the increase in the irradiation time. After being irradiated for 1800 s, the surface temperature of the P-G3B18 sample increases up to 77.3 °C, which is much higher than the Tm of PEG. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the P-G3B18 sample shows a narrower plateau compared with the P-G3B6 and P-G3B12 samples. This may be the result of the following: the k of P-G3B18 is higher than those of the other two composite PCM samples and P-G3B18 can transfer heat absorbed faster to completely melt the PEG. After being irradiated for 1800 s, the xenon lamp was switched off and the sample was naturally cooled down to room temperature. Similarly, a plateau representing the liquid–solid transition is observed in the cooling curves. The surface temperature is maintained at a relatively high level (about 43–45 °C) for a long time, and the stored heat energy is released through the crystallization of PEG. The above results indicate that the composite PCM samples have an excellent light-to-heat energy transition ability on the one hand. On the other hand, through the occurrence of the phase change, the composite PCM sample has an ability to reduce the overheating phenomenon if more energy is applied to the devices and/or maintain the operating temperature of the devices if the environmental temperature is too low.
 Fig. 10  Temperature evolution of the pure PEG and PCM samples as indicated in the graph with time during the light-to-thermal energy transition measurements by using the simulated sunlight. 
To evaluate the applicability of the composite PCMs as a component of microelectronic devices, a simple device was assembled and measured. As shown in Fig. 11a, the device was composed of a solar cell, a composite PCM sample (P-G3B18) prepared in this work, a thermoelectric device (TED), and a cooling fin. The output power of the solar cell and the TED were calculated using the data from the Keithley recorder and are shown in Fig. 11b. Here, the output power of the solar cell was obtained under three different conditions. First, only the solar cell was measured. Second, the PCM sample was assembled with the solar cell (solar cell&PCM device) which was then measured. Third, the composite PCM sample, the TED device and the cooling fin were assembled with the solar cell (solar cell&PCM&TED device) and the output power was gained again. It is well known to all that the output power of the solar cell is inversely proportional to the operating temperature,54 and higher operating temperature usually leads to the reduction of the output power. As shown in Fig. 11b, when only the solar cell is irradiated, the output power of the solar cell is the smallest due to the fast increase of the operating temperature. Once the composite PCM sample (P-G3B18) is assembled to the device, the surface temperature of the solar cell can be easily reduced through heat diffusion from the solar cell to the PCM sample compared with that without the PCM because the composite PCM can absorb more heat faster and, therefore, higher output power is achieved for the solar cell. For the solar cell&PCM&TED device, the introduction of the TED component further consumes the heat energy diffused from the composite PCM sample, which facilitates further reduction of the operating temperature of the solar cell and, consequently, the highest output power is achieved for the solar cell. As expected, once the xenon lamp is switched off, the solar cell does not work and then no output power is achieved. Under these conditions, the output power of the TED component was also calculated, and the result is shown in Fig. 11c. It is clearly seen that the output power of the TED component gradually increases with the increase in the irradiation time. Furthermore, when the xenon lamp is switched off, the TED component may continuously work and supply output power for a long time. Specifically, one can see that there is a plateau in the output power curve, in which the output power is relatively stable. Obviously, the plateau is mainly related to the occurrence of the phase change of the composite PCM sample during the cooling process and under these conditions, the temperature is maintained at a high level for a long time as confirmed in Fig. 10, which provides the persistent temperature gradient for the TED and then promotes the continuous working of the TED component. The variation of the output power of the TED component indicates that the composite PCM samples prepared in this work can be used under emergency conditions to provide energy for thermoelectric devices so that a continuous power supply could be sustained.

4. Conclusions
In summary, through the GO-assisted dispersion technology, inert BN nanosheets have been successfully incorporated into the MF. The integrated hybrid rGO/BN frameworks have also been constructed based on the template of the MF frameworks through the hydrothermal reaction with the aid of a reducing agent, freeze-drying treatment, and carbonization treatment, successively. The composite PCM samples containing PEG and rGO/BN frameworks show excellent encapsulation stability, high thermal conductivity (up to 0.79 W m−1 K−1), high phase change enthalpy (160.7 J g−1) with a retention of 90.8% of the pure PEG, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. The composite PCM samples exhibit an excellent light-to-heat energy transition ability and they can be used as the thermal management component of a microelectronic device. Specifically, they can be used to provide energy for the thermoelectric device under emergency conditions so that a continuous power supply could be sustained.
