    , Accepted 12th December 2022First published on 13th December 2022AbstractRegarding the design of high-performance solar energy conversion platforms, heteronanostructured photocatalysts consisting of plasmonic metals and semiconductors are of particular interest due to their capability for the conversion of solar to plasmon energy that can accelerate the formation of charge carriers. Here, we introduce ternary heteronanocrystals composed of two different plasmonic metal nanocrystals (hexoctahedral Au and spherical Ag nanocrystals) and a semiconductor (Cu2O). The site-selective overgrowth of Cu2O on the high-curvature vertices of hexoctahedral Au nanocrystals and the subsequent deposition of spherical Ag nanocrystals on the Cu2O surface could realize the formation of Au–Cu2O–Ag ternary heteronanocrystals with a precisely controlled configuration. The synthesized ternary heteronanocrystals exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution performance over a wide range of visible-light wavelengths compared to binary and monomeric counterparts. The improved photocatalytic function of the ternary heteronanocrystals can be attributed to the combination of the two different plasmonic metal nanocrystals having distinct plasmonic properties with the semiconductor, which can enable the promotion of both plasmon-induced charge and energy transfer processes. Our study can give a design guideline for devising heteronanostructure-based solar energy conversion platforms with intended functions.
Introduction
Recently, integrating plasmonic metals having specific localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) characteristics with semiconductors has emerged as a promising approach to the construction of high-performance solar energy conversion platforms.1–3 In this context, plasmonic metal–semiconductor heteronanocrystals (HNCs) have been extensively explored in the field of photocatalysis, such as H2 evolution by water splitting,4–6 chemical fuel production by CO2 reduction,7,8 and pollutant degradation.9,10 The enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of plasmonic metal–semiconductor HNCs can be attributed to the plasmon energy transfer from a metal to a semiconductor through plasmon-induced hot electron transfer (PHET), plasmon-induced interfacial charge-transfer transition (PICTT), plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET), and/or local electromagnetic (EM) field enhancement mechanisms.2,3,11–16 In the PHET and PICTT mechanisms, plasmon-induced hot electrons in a metal are injected into the conduction band of a semiconductor, contributing to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity.17–21 Hereafter, these plasmon-induced charge transfer processes will be referred to as the HET process. The PIRET and local EM field enhancement processes can accelerate charge carrier formation in a semiconductor through the transfer of plasmon-induced dipole–dipole excitation energy and enhanced near-field of a plasmonic metal to the semiconductor, respectively.22,23 Contrary to the HET process, the above processes can be activated when there is considerable spectral overlap between the LSPR band of the plasmonic metal and the bandgap absorption of the semiconductor. Hereafter, these processes, in which energy and EM field are transferred, will be referred to as the EMT process.
To expedite the utilization of plasmon energy in photocatalysis, the plasmon energy transfer processes should be effectively promoted through fine control over the configuration and optical properties of plasmonic metal–semiconductor HNCs.6,13,22–25 In this regard, it is noteworthy that the coupling of a semiconductor at the high-curvature sites (tips, vertices, and edges) of plasmonic metal (Au) NCs has proved to be promising for enhancing the plasmon-induced processes at the metal/semiconductor interfaces.24,26–28 This is because the plasmon energy is highly concentrated at the high-curvature sites.29–31 However, most of the reported HNCs have exhibited limited photocatalytic activities because the full exploitation of both the HET and EMT mechanisms is difficult due to their compositional and morphological limitations. Since the LSPR peaks of the Au nanostructures with well-defined high-curvature sites included in the HNCs appear at long-wavelength visible light (λ > 600 nm), their spectral overlap with the bandgap absorption of semiconductors, such as TiO2, CdS, and Cu2O, is weak, resulting in a marginal EMT-mediated enhancement. Accordingly, the development of plasmonic metal–semiconductor HNCs that can promote both the HET and EMT processes through the formation of intense plasmon energy at high curvature sites and the utilization of a wide range of wavelengths of light is highly desirable to enable efficient plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis.
Herein, we introduce a new type of metal–semiconductor–metal ternary HNC with a precisely controlled configuration that can allow both the HET- and EMT-mediated enhancement of photocatalysis. The ternary HNCs have a combination of two different plasmonic metal NCs, i.e., spherical Ag NCs and hexoctahedral (HOH) Au NCs with well-developed multiple high-curvature sites, and a p-type semiconductor, i.e., Cu2O. The constituent materials of the ternary HNCs are coupled with a well-defined configuration (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag), which was realized by coupling Cu2O on the high-curvature vertices of HOH Au NCs, followed by the growth of Ag NCs on the Cu2O domain overgrown on the HOH Au NCs. Fig. 1a shows the extinction spectra of spherical Ag and HOH Au NCs and the diffuse reflectance spectrum of Cu2O NCs. The Ag and Cu2O NCs used in the optical measurements were separately prepared (see the Experimental section and Fig. S1 and S2†) and had average sizes of 11.9 ± 1.5 and 123 ± 9 nm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the Ag and Cu2O NCs in the optimal ternary HNCs. The HOH Au NCs used to prepare the ternary HNCs were synthesized using a previously reported procedure31 and had an average size of 136 ± 6 nm (see the Experimental section and Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 1a, the spherical Ag and HOH Au NCs exhibited a strong LSPR band in the short- and long-wavelength regions of visible light, respectively. As such, we can expect that the combination of the two plasmonic NCs in the ternary HNCs can lead to the utilization of a wide range of visible light wavelengths in the plasmon-induced processes. In particular, a considerable spectral overlap between the LSPR band of the spherical Ag NCs and the bandgap absorption of Cu2O (bandgap = 2.02 eV, Fig. S2e†) can accelerate the formation of charge carriers via the EMT together with the HET processes (Fig. 1a and b). Furthermore, intense plasmon energy formed on the high-curvature vertices of the HOH Au NCs can enhance the photocatalytic performance of the ternary HNCs by facilitating the HET process (Fig. 1b). The band diagrams at the Au/Cu2O and Ag/Cu2O interfaces were constructed based on the reported work functions of Au and Ag32 and the measured work function, valence band energy, and bandgap of the Cu2O NCs (Fig. S2c–e†). In fact, we chose the two plasmonic NCs to form the ternary HNCs based on the abovementioned expectation. Indeed, the prepared ternary HNCs, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs, showed superb photocatalytic H2 evolution activity compared to binary HNCs and a single semiconductor counterpart. Based on the results of a series of experiments and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, we can verify that the excellent photocatalytic performance of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs explicitly originates from the effective facilitation of the plasmonic effects of the two types of plasmonic metals by constructing the ternary HNC structure.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of HNCs
The schematic illustration of the synthesis process of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs is shown in Fig. 1c, and the synthesis details are described in the Experimental section. First, based on our reported method,24 Cu2O was grown selectively on the 8 high-curvature 〈111〉-directed vertices of the HOH Au NCs by reducing CuCl2 in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). Then, the subsequent reduction of AgNO3 led to the formation of Ag NCs preferentially on the surface of the formed Cu2O domain, resulting in the production of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs. Given that PVP used in the synthesis as a stabilizer prefers to adsorb on the low-curvature surfaces of NCs compared to high-curvature sites,24 the site-selective overgrowth of Cu2O on the high-curvature vertices of the HOH Au NCs and the subsequent formation of Ag NCs on the surface of the Cu2O domain could be possible. The role of PVP in the protection of the low-curvature sites of the HOH Au NCs could further be confirmed by our finding that the reduction of AgNO3 on the HOH Au NCs having no Cu2O domains in the presence of PVP led to the formation of Ag NCs preferentially on the high-curvature vertices of the HOH Au NCs, yielding Auvertex–Ag HNCs (Fig. S4†). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping image of a representative Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNC distinctly demonstrate the successful formation of the ternary HNCs with a controlled configuration (Fig. 1d and e). The low-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the product further indicates the high-yield (>90%) synthesis of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs (Fig. S5a†). The TEM and SEM images of the ternary HNCs viewed along different directions are closely correlated with their three-dimensional geometric models (Fig. 1f–h and S5b, c†), revealing the well-defined configuration of the prepared HNCs. The TEM-determined average sizes of the Cu2O and Ag NCs of the ternary HNCs were 86 ± 6 and 11.2 ± 1.7 nm, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs corroborates the face-centered cubic structure of the Au and Ag domains and the cuprite structure of the Cu2O domain (Fig. S6a†). Besides, Cu 2p core level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on the ternary HNCs confirmed that the Cu in the Cu2O domains is mainly in the Cu(I) state (Fig. S6b†).
Notably, the Ag composition and the size of Ag NCs in the ternary HNCs could be tuned by controlling the amount of Ag precursors added to the growth solution. When the volume of the AgNO3 solution (5 mM) injected into the growth solution was adjusted to 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mL, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs with EDS-determined Ag atomic percentages of 3.0, 5.9, 8.0, and 10.4% were generated, respectively. Hereafter, the ternary HNCs with different Ag compositions will be denoted as Auvertex–Cu2O–Agx HNCs (x = 3.0, 5.9, 8.0, and 10.4). In fact, the abovementioned Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs correspond to the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs, which are the optimal HNCs in photocatalysis (vide infra). As the Ag content of the ternary HNCs increased, the size of Ag NCs in the ternary HNCs increased. The average sizes of Ag NCs in the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag3.0, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag8.0, and Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag10.4 HNCs were estimated to be 8.8 ± 1.4, 11.2 ± 1.7, 13.6 ± 2.1, and 15.9 ± 3.4 nm, respectively, by TEM measurements (Fig. 2b–e and g–j). The extinction spectra of the HNCs showed the distinct LSPR features of the Ag and Au NCs in the HNCs (Fig. S7†).

Photocatalysis with HNCs
To investigate the effect of synergism between the constituent materials of the ternary HNCs in the photocatalysis, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs with various Ag compositions were examined under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) using methanol as a hole scavenger, and the results were compared with those of binary plasmonic metal–semiconductor HNCs (Auvertex–Cu2O and Cu2O–Ag HNCs), Cu2O NCs, and a physical mixture of the HOH Au, spherical Ag, and Cu2O NCs. The Ag and Cu2O NC samples are identical to those used in the optical measurements (Fig. 1a). The Cu2O–Ag HNCs were prepared by reducing AgNO3 on the Cu2O NCs through a synthetic procedure similar to that employed in the production of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs from the Auvertex–Cu2O HNCs (Fig. S8†). Fig. 3a and b show the amounts of evolved H2 during the photocatalysis and corresponding H2 evolution rates obtained with the various catalysts, respectively. Apparently, the binary Auvertex–Cu2O and Cu2O–Ag HNCs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activities compared to the Cu2O NCs, demonstrating that the Au and Ag NCs can accelerate H2 evolution by transferring their plasmon energy to the Cu2O NCs. Notably, all the ternary Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs showed higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activities than the binary HNCs. This distinctly indicates that the ternary HNC structure can lead to the effective facilitation of the plasmonic effects in photocatalysis through the synergistic integration of the two plasmonic metals. Interestingly, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of the ternary HNCs showed a volcano-like trend with the change in the size of the Ag NCs in the HNCs. The H2 evolution activities of the ternary HNCs follow the order Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs (122.93 μmol g−1 h−1) > Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag8.0 HNCs (80.14 μmol g−1 h−1) > Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag3.0 HNCs (57.74 μmol g−1 h−1) > Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag10.4 HNCs (38.50 μmol g−1 h−1). Indeed, the increase in the size of the Ag NCs in the ternary HNCs will increase the plasmon energy associated with the Ag NCs, thus promoting the plasmonic effect of the Ag NCs in the photocatalysis. However, as the size of the Ag NCs increases, the efficiency of the light utilization for the Cu2O domain and the vertices of the HOH Au NCs decreases, and the active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction on the Cu2O domain are reduced, thus lessening their contribution to photocatalysis. In the case of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag3.0 and Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs, which have well-separated small Ag NCs, the abovementioned detrimental effects of the Ag NCs are insignificant and, hence, the plasmonic effect of the Ag NCs in the photocatalysis is promoted as the size of the Ag NCs increases. On the contrary, as the size of the Ag NCs further increases and some of them are aggregated (for the case of the Auvetex–Cu2O–Ag8.0 and Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag10.4 HNCs), the detrimental effects become significant, resulting in the decrease of photocatalytic activity. As such, the ternary HNCs exhibited the volcano-like trend of photocatalytic activities with the increase in the size of their Ag NCs. The experimental results indicate that the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs have an optimal Ag NC size for the enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution among the various ternary HNCs. On the other hand, the physical mixture of the HOH Au, spherical Ag, and Cu2O NCs showed an H2 evolution rate of 4.02 μmol g−1 h−1, which is much lower than those of the ternary HNCs (Fig. S9†), signifying that intimate coupling between the components of the ternary HNCs is essential for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The temperature of the reaction mixture did not change significantly during the photocatalysis (Fig. S10†), which further indicates that the contribution of the photothermal effect to the enhancement of photocatalysis is insignificant. Notably, the H2 evolution rate of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs was proportional to the intensity of irradiated light (Fig. S11†), which is indeed the characteristic behavior of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis.1 Due to the effective plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic function of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs, the H2 evolution activity of the ternary HNCs is higher than those of reported Cu2O-based photocatalysts (Table S1†). The recyclability of the ternary HNCs was confirmed by the almost preserved H2 evolution rate and intact morphology of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs during repeated photocatalysis cycles (Fig. S12a and b†). Furthermore, the XRD pattern and Cu 2p XPS spectrum of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs after the photocatalysis cycles showed that the Cu2O phase of the ternary HNCs was well preserved (Fig. S12c and d†). These results demonstrate that the ternary HNCs are not susceptible to the photo-corrosion of Cu2O, which is a major problem of Cu2O-based photocatalysts.33 This can be attributed to the hole scavenger, methanol, which can effectively suppress the self-oxidation of Cu2O by photoexcited holes.34 Besides, there were no detectable changes in the chemical state of Au and Ag after the recyclability test (Fig. S12e and f†).

The cross-section views of FDTD-simulation models are shown below. 
To investigate the correlation between the LSPR characteristics of the ternary HNCs and their photocatalytic activity, the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs were measured under the monochromatic light irradiation (Fig. 3c). Notably, the ternary HNCs exhibited efficient photocatalytic activities over a wide range of visible light wavelengths with distinctly high AQEs around 450 and 750 nm, which are highly correlated with the LSPR features of the Ag and Au NCs in the HNCs, respectively. In the long-wavelength region of visible light (>∼600 nm), where the spectral overlap between the LSPR band of the metal NCs and the bandgap absorption of Cu2O is very low, the AQE values follow the extinction spectrum of the ternary HNCs, which is associated with the HOH Au NCs in the ternary HNCs. This demonstrates that the Au NC domains of the ternary HNCs can lead to plasmon-induced photocatalysis through the HET mechanism, which is in good accordance with our expectations. Meanwhile, in the short-wavelength region of visible light (<∼600 nm), i.e., large spectral overlap region, the ternary HNCs showed relatively high AQE values despite the lower intensity of extinction at this region compared to that in the long-wavelength region. Given our previous finding that the binary Auvertex–Cu2O HNCs have a low photocatalytic activity below 600 nm (ref. 21) together with the low visible-light photocatalytic activity of the Cu2O NCs, the high AQE values in the short-wavelength region indicate that the Ag NC domains of the ternary HNCs can indeed accelerate the photocatalysis through the transfer of their plasmon energy to the Cu2O domains. The results of AQE measurements explicitly reveal that the construction of the ternary HNCs with the two different plasmonic metal nanostructures having distinct plasmon properties enables the plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis over a wide range of visible light wavelengths.
Plasmonic effects of HNCs on photocatalysis
To further examine the plasmonic function of the Ag and Au domains of the ternary HNCs in photocatalysis, we estimated EM field enhancements on the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9, Auvertex–Cu2O, and Cu2O–Ag HNCs by FDTD simulations. Three-dimensional geometric models for the simulations were constructed based on the TEM images of the HNCs, and the excitation wavelengths (λex = 450 and 750 nm) were set based on the AQE measurements. Through the 1 and 2 monitor planes, the plasmon excitation around the surface of aligned Ag NCs and the vertices of the HOH Au NCs was analyzed, respectively (Fig. 3d). Notably, the model Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNC showed intense EM field amplitudes at the surface of Ag NCs aligned on the Cu2O surface with the λex of 450 nm (Fig. 3e), and at the vertices of the HOH Au NC with the λex of 750 nm (Fig. 3f). This corroborates the induction of high plasmon energy at the ternary HNCs under the irradiation of both the excitation wavelengths, which is in line with the results of the AQE measurements. On the contrary, the Auvertex–Cu2O and Cu2O–Ag HNC models exhibited plasmon excitation only at the λex of 750 and 450 nm, respectively (Fig. 3e and f). The FDTD simulation results confirm that the efficient visible-light utilization of the ternary HNCs can be attributed to the multiple plasmon excitations endowed by the Ag and HOH Au NCs.
For the elucidation of the plasmon energy transfer mechanism of the ternary HNCs, (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag)@Cu2O core–shell HNCs were prepared by the overgrowth of Cu2O on the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs (Fig. 4a–c), and their photocatalytic activity was compared with that of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs. Because the exposed metal surfaces of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs are covered by the Cu2O shell layer, the HET by the Ag and HOH Au NCs cannot be sustained in the (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag)@Cu2O core–shell HNCs due to accumulated holes on the metal surfaces, whereas the EMT process can be preserved (Fig. 4d). The AQEs of the (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag)@Cu2O core–shell HNCs measured under the monochromatic light irradiation are shown in Fig. 4e. Interestingly, the AQE values of the core–shell HNCs are comparable to those of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs up to 600 nm, implying that the EMT mechanism is dominant for the plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis in that wavelength region. This coincides with previous findings that the EMT process is prevalent when the LSRP band of a plasmonic metal matches well the bandgap absorption of a semiconductor.25,35 On the other hand, under light irradiation with wavelengths of longer than 600 nm, the core–shell HNCs showed much lower AQEs than the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs. This further verifies that the HET mechanism dominates in the long-wavelength region of visible light. To further confirm the dominant role of the HET in the promotional effect of the HOH Au NCs, we prepared (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs containing insulating SiO2 interlayers between the HOH Au and Cu2O NCs, which can effectively block the HET from Au to Cu2O. The (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs were synthesized using HOH Au@SiO2 core–shell HNCs (Fig. S13a and b†) as seeds under otherwise synthesis conditions similar to those employed for the preparation of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs. The (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs showed a morphology almost identical to that of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs except for the presence of thin SiO2 interlayers with a thickness of 1–2 nm (Fig. S13c and d†). Notably, the (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs exhibited a drastically decreased H2 evolution activity compared to the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs (Fig. S13e†). This result corroborates that the HET is the principal mechanism for the promotional effect of the HOH Au NCs in photocatalysis. The results of the control experiments confirm that the EMT of the Ag NCs and the HET of the HOH Au NCs are the main plasmon-induced enhancement pathways for the excellent photocatalytic performance of the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a synthetic strategy for the construction of plasmonic metal–semiconductor–plasmonic metal ternary HNCs with a controlled configuration. Through the selective overgrowth of Cu2O on the sharp vertices of hexoctahedral Au NCs, followed by the deposition of numerous Ag NCs on the surface of Cu2O, Au–Cu2O–Ag ternary HNCs with the distinct compositional and morphological structure could be generated. The prepared ternary HNCs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activities over a wide range of visible light wavelengths compared to binary plasmonic metal–semiconductor HNCs and a single semiconductor counterpart. The excellent photocatalytic performance of the ternary HNCs can be attributed to the facilitation of plasmon energy transfer from the Au and Ag domains to the Cu2O domains in the HNCs through the simultaneous activation of the HET and EMT mechanisms, which are associated with the plasmon excitation of the Au and Ag domains, respectively. We expect that the present work can provide a new opportunity to design heteronanostructures for efficient solar energy conversion.

Preparation of HOH Au NCs
HOH Au NCs were synthesized using a previously reported procedure.31 First, CTAC-capped Au NC seeds were prepared. Aqueous solutions of HAuCl4 (0.5 mL, 5 mM) and ice-cold NaBH4 (0.6 mL, 10 mM) were sequentially injected into 10 mL of CTAC solution (100 mM) under vigorous stirring. After stirring for 1 min, the resultant Au NC seed solution was left undisturbed for 5 h. To synthesize HOH Au NCs, an aqueous solution of CTAC (20 mL, 100 mM) was gently stirred on a hot plate.

The centrifugation speed and time were the same for all of the preparation of NCs. Then, the collected HOH Au NCs were redispersed into 0.5 mL of water and then used for the growth of Cu2O. In a typical synthesis of Auvertex–Cu2O HNCs, an aqueous solution of CuCl2 (0.05 mL, 50 mM) was injected into 7.2 mL of water. Then, 1.0 mL of PVP (100 mg mL−1), 0.5 mL of sodium citrate dihydrate (100 mM), HOH Au NC solution (0.5 mL), 0.25 mL of NaOH (1.0 M), and 0.5 mL of NH2OH·HCl (400 mM) were sequentially added to the solution with gentle shaking. The resultant solution was left undisturbed for 10 min. To prepare Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs, a certain amount of AgNO3 (5 mM) was injected into the Auvertex–Cu2O HNC solution. After gentle shaking for 10 s, the growth solution was kept in an oven at 55 °C for 2 h. The volumes of the AgNO3 solution for preparing the Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag3.0, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag8.0, and Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag10.4 HNCs were 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mL, respectively. To purify the resultant HNCs, they were washed with ethanol twice by centrifugation and dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol.
Preparation of Ag NCs
Ag NCs were prepared by modifying a reported method.36 In a typical synthesis of Ag NCs, 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing sodium citrate dihydrate (25 mM) and tannic acid (0.025 mM) was heated at 100 °C with vigorous stirring. After 15 min, 1 mL of AgNO3 (25 mM) was added to the solution and kept heating for 5 min. Then, the resultant solution was cooled down to room temperature.
Preparation of Cu2O NCs
Cu2O NCs were synthesized using a previously reported procedure with a slight modification.37 First, 10, 9, 18, and 180 mL of solutions containing SDS (33 mM) and CuSO4 (1 mM) were prepared and labeled A, B, C, and D, respectively. Aqueous solutions of sodium ascorbate (200 mM) and NaOH (1 M) were sequentially added to solution A, and the resultant solution was transferred to solution B. The same procedure was carried out for solutions B, C, and D. The volume of sodium ascorbate, NaOH, A, B, and C solutions used for the growth of Cu2O: 0.25 mL of sodium ascorbate and 0.5 mL of NaOH for solution A; 0.25 mL of sodium ascorbate, 0.5 mL of NaOH, and 1 mL of solution A for solution B; 0.5 mL of sodium ascorbate, 1 mL of NaOH, and 2 mL of solution B for solution C; 5 mL of sodium ascorbate, 10 mL of NaOH, and 20 mL of solution C for solution D. After incubating for 2 h at room temperature, Cu2O NCs in solution D were washed with ethanol twice by centrifugation and dispersed in ethanol.
Preparation of Cu2O–Ag HNCs
For the preparation of Cu2O–Ag HNCs, 20 mL of Cu2O NC solution was centrifuged. The collected Cu2O NCs were redispersed in 0.5 mL of water and then used for the growth of Ag. In a typical synthesis of Cu2O–Ag HNCs, 1.0 mL of PVP (100 mg mL−1), 0.5 mL sodium citrate dihydrate (100 mM), Cu2O NC solution (0.5 mL), 0.25 mL of NaOH (1.0 M), and 0.5 mL of NH2OH·HCl (400 mM) were sequentially injected into 7.25 mL of water with gentle shaking. The resultant solution was left undisturbed for 10 min, and then 0.1 mL of AgNO3 (5 mM) was added to the solution. After gentle shaking for 10 s, the growth solution was kept in an oven at 55 °C for 2 h.
Preparation of (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag)@Cu2O HNCs
In a typical synthesis of (Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag)@Cu2O HNCs, Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNCs dispersed in ethanol were collected by centrifugation and redispersed in 0.5 mL of water. The concentrated Auvertex–Cu2O–Ag5.9 HNC solution was injected into a mixture of water (7.55 mL), CuCl2 (0.2 mL, 10 mM), and PVP (1.0 mL, 100 mg mL−1). After adding NaOH (0.25 mL, 1 M) and NH2OH·HCl (0.5 mL, 200 mM) with gentle shaking for several seconds, the resultant solution was kept in an oven at 55 °C for 2 h. The resultant HNCs were washed with ethanol twice by centrifugation and dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol.
Preparation of HOH Au@SiO2 core–shell NCs
HOH Au@SiO2 core–shell NCs were prepared by following a reported method24 with a slight modification. In a typical synthesis of HOH Au@SiO2 core–shell NCs, 0.2 mL of an aqueous solution of APTMS (10 mM) was injected into an aqueous solution of HOH Au NCs (20 mL, 1.16 mMAu). After stirring for 30 min, the resultant solution was centrifuged once and redispersed in 20 mL of water. Then, to the reaction solution, sodium silicate solution (0.05 mL, 5.4 wt%) and ammonia solution (1 μL, 0.25 v/v%) were added and heated at 90 °C for 1 h. The resultant HOH Au@SiO2 core–shell NCs were washed with water several times by centrifugation and redispersed in 2 mL of water.
Preparation of (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs
(Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs were prepared based on a reported method24 with a slight modification. In a typical synthesis of (Au@SiO2)vertex–Cu2O–Ag HNCs, an aqueous solution of CuCl2 (0.05 mL, 50 mM) was injected into 7.2 mL of water. Then, 1.0 mL of PVP (100 mg mL−1), 0.5 mL of sodium citrate dihydrate (100 mM), Au@SiO2 core–shell NC solution (0.5 mL), 0.25 mL of NaOH (1.0 M), and 0.5 mL of NH2OH·HCl (400 mM) were sequentially added to the reaction solution with gentle shaking. The resultant solution was left undisturbed for 2 h. Then, AgNO3 solution (0.01 mL, 5 mM) was injected into the solution and kept at 55 °C for 30 min. The resultant HNCs were washed with ethanol twice by centrifugation and redispersed in 20 mL of ethanol.
Characterization
SEM images of the samples were taken with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI, Inspect F50). TEM images of the samples were taken with a field-emission transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV (FEI, Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin). HAADF-STEM measurements and EDS analyses were performed using a field-emission transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV (FEI, Talos F200X). For TEM measurements, sample solutions were loaded on a carbon-coated Ni grid (300 mesh). Extinction and diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer equipped with an ISR-3100 integrating sphere. XRD patterns were obtained by using a multipurpose thin-film X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU, D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å). XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out using a Kratos Axis-Supra photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray (1486.7 eV) and He–I (21.2 eV) as light sources, respectively. XPS data were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, and UPS data were calibrated using the Fermi level position of Au.
Photocatalysis experiments
For visible-light photocatalysis experiments, a Xe lamp (300 W, Newport 66902) equipped with a UV cut-off filter and a liquid filter was used as a light source (λ > 400 nm). The power density of light was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2. To prepare a photocatalytic reaction cell, 5 mg of catalysts dispersed in a mixed solution of water (15 mL) and methanol (5 mL) was put in a quartz cell. Before light irradiation, the catalyst solution was purged with Ar for 30 min. A typical photocatalytic reaction was conducted for 3 h and evolved H2 gas was quantitatively measured by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, 7890 B) every 1 h. To obtain AQE values, the amounts of evolved H2 were measured under monochromatic light irradiation using bandpass filters with center wavelengths of 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, and 850 nm (full width at half maximum = 10 ± 2 nm). AQEs were calculated from the following equation: AQE (%) = {2 × N(H2)/N(photons)} × 100 = {2 × n(H2) × NA × h × c}/{S × P × t × λ} × 100, where N(H2) is the number of evolved H2 molecules, N(photons) is the number of incident photons, n(H2) is the number of moles of evolved H2, NA is the Avogadro number, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, S is the irradiated area, P is the intensity of light, t is the irradiation time, and λ is the excitation wavelength.
FDTD simulations
The three-dimensional FDTD method with a commercial FDTD-Lumerical™ simulation package was used to calculate the electric field distribution of HNCs. For the calculations, the size of the mesh box including the target models was set to 0.5 nm, and the refractive index of surrounding media was set to 1.33 for aqueous conditions. The geometric models for the HNCs were designed based on their structural parameters measured using microscopic tools.
