    First published on 19th June 2023AbstractMetal agents have made incredible strides in preclinical research and clinical applications in recent years, but their short emission/absorption wavelengths continue to be a barrier to their distribution, therapeutic action, visual tracking, and efficacy evaluation. Nowadays, the near-infrared window (NIR, 650–1700 nm) provides a more accurate imaging and treatment option. Thus, there has been ongoing research focusing on developing multifunctional NIR metal agents for imaging and therapy that have deeper tissue penetration. The design, characteristics, bioimaging, and therapy of NIR metal agents are covered in this overview of papers and reports published to date. To start with, we focus on describing the structure, design strategies, and photophysical properties of metal agents from the NIR-I (650–1000 nm) to NIR-II (1000–1700 nm) region, in order of molecular metal complexes (MMCs), metal–organic complexes (MOCs), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Next, the biomedical applications brought by these superior photophysical and chemical properties for more accurate imaging and therapy are discussed. Finally, we explore the challenges and prospects of each type of NIR metal agent for future biomedical research and clinical translation.

1. Introduction
The Noble Prize in Chemistry of 1913 was awarded to Alfred Werner, the father of coordination chemistry.1 He revolutionarily proposed a theory that divided chemical bonds into “ionogenic” (ionic) and “non-ionogenic” (covalent) bonding in order to demonstrate the configuration and composition of octahedral metal complexes.2 Pioneering contribution of Werner to coordination chemistry laid the foundations for modern chemistry broadly encompassing bioinorganic chemistry, metal-based pharmaceuticals, supramolecular chemistry, and other related fields.3 In the field of metal coordination chemistry, the breadth and depth of research on molecular metal complexes (MMCs), metal–organic complexes (MOCs), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have become progressively apparent owing to their versatile and controllable structures as well as diverse applications in medicine, chemical biology, molecular imaging, sensing, catalysis, energy storage and environmental chemistry in more recent decades.4–8
The first structure-defined MMC, arsphenamine containing metallic arsenic, was identified at the turn of 20th century.9 After that, arsenic-containing molecular complexes were constructed to study structure–activity relationship and Salvarsan was chosen for syphilis treatment.10 Rosenberg made the groundbreaking discovery of cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II) (generally named cisplatin) in the 1960s, which is the gold standard in chemotherapy and an important milestone in the development of MMC.11,12 Later, new platinum (Pt) complexes incorporating carboplatin and oxaliplatin were given clinical practice approval.13,14 Apart from Pt-based drugs, MMCs based on germanium (Ga), iron (Fe), palladium (Pd) and other metals have received clinical approval in the United States and/or in Europe.9,15 In recent years, clinical investigations on ruthenium (Ru) complexes like NAMI-A, KP1019, NKP1339 and TLD-1433 have also been conducted.16–19 Hitherto, in the field of clinical medicine, MMCs have been investigated in diagnostics and therapeutics including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide imaging, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT) and radiotherapy.20–22 Through modulating metal ions and coordinated ligands, the geometrical, electronic, topological, and optical properties can be rationally tuned to produce MMCs with enhanced target specificity, biosafety and theranostic effectiveness.23–26
The 2016 Nobel prize in Chemistry was given to molecular machines.27 MOCs are two- or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) structures made of discrete systems with metal centers connected to ligands through self-assembly coordination. The 2D MOCs are metallacycles while the 3D MOCs are metallacages and chiral helicates.28 To construct MOCs, the ordinary assembly methods are edge- and face-directed, and also include symmetry-adapted and weak-link approaches.29 Inspired by the groundbreaking work on the formation of MOCs by Fujita, Therrien, Stang, Raymond, Nitschke, Mirkin, Cotton and Newkome, many other researchers entered this research field.30–36 A molecular library of MOCs having customized topology, shapes, sizes and physical/chemical properties has been constructed by modifying the components involving bite angles, metal nodes, organic ligands and substituents.37,38 As a result, they have been used more and more for catalysis, sensing, molecular recognition, drug delivery and biomedical applications.6,39,40
MOFs are organic–inorganic hybrid crystalline porous materials, composed of positively charged metallic centers/clusters surrounded by multidentate organic ligands.39,41 Through pre-designed or post-synthetic modification strategies, a variety of MOFs can be formed using metal precursors (MIL-, UiO-, ZIF-series, etc.), organic likers (metallo, ditopic, tritopic, tetratopic, hexatopic, octatopic, mixed, desymmetrized, and N-heterocyclic linkers, etc.) and customizable reaction conditions.42,43 Benefiting from their unique advantages like well-defined crystalline structures, organic–inorganic hybrid composition and porous structures with high internal surface areas, MOFs are applied in various fields including sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, gas/energy storage, energy conversion, chemical purification, and many more.7,44–49
As the applications of metal agents containing MMCs, MOCs, and MOFs have expanded in clinical practice and exploratory studies, the mono-chemotherapeutic functions of traditional metal-based agents with drug resistance and adverse reactions did not satisfy the need for personalized treatment.50,51 To overcome the intrinsic drawbacks in biomedical applications, phototherapy including PDT and PTT was devised to combat multiple drug resistance and lower the associated side effects.52–55 In addition, the use of photo-induced luminescence permits in vitro and/or in vivo tracking of metal agents to evaluate the real-time monitoring of the treatment progress. However, typical metal agents that excite and emit within the near-infrared (NIR) region are scanty.
Light-triggered biomedical applications in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) region (200–650 nm) are limited due to its restricted penetration depth, high auto-fluorescence background, and ultralow permissible exposure.56,57 Therefore, numerous efforts were made to achieve both precise imaging and effective phototherapy, including making wavelength red-shifting into the NIR bio-window (650–1700 nm), designing two-photon metal agents and introducing rare earth metals with up-conversion fluorescence function.58–61 Among these research studies, Tang and our group simultaneously developed NIR-II fluorescent metallacycles/metallacages via self-assembling NIR-II (1000–1700 nm) emissive ligands with metal acceptors to realize in vivo NIR-II fluorescent imaging-guided chemo-phototherapy in deep tissues.62–64
In the last few years, a variety of reviews have been reported to summarize the recent advances in metal agents from different perspectives.4,6,9,15,20,22,25,28,37,40,44,45,58 For example, Gasser et al. focused on the utilization of first-row transition metal complexes in anticancer phototherapeutics.65 Sadler et al. concisely examined the state-of-the-art design of MMCs for PDT and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT).52 Stang et al. thoroughly reviewed Pt-based metallacycles and metallacages via coordination-driven self-assembly.28 However, a comprehensive analysis of photo-induced metal complexes, covering MMCs, MOCs and MOFs, especially those excited and/or emitted within the NIR bio-window is lacking.
In this review, we first systematically review the design and construction of NIR metal agents including MMCs, MOCs and MOFs, and the metal elements (in red) listed in the periodic table (Fig. 1). The luminous mechanism and photophysical/photochemical properties of these metal agents are emphatically discussed. Based on the well-designed metal agents, the corresponding biomedical applications extensively incorporating bioimaging, phototherapy, synergistic therapy and imaging-guided therapy are meticulously presented. Finally, we summarize current frontiers, present challenges in synthesis/characterization, propose potential limitations in applied biotechnology and map out future perspectives of NIR metal agents. We hope to provide a comprehensive and systematic discussion on the design, construction, functionality and bio-application of NIR metal agents (Fig. 2).

2. Construction and properties of molecular metal complexes (MMCs)
Over the past decade, scientists have achieved notable progress in diagnostic and therapeutic applications through the utilization of the abundant photophysical and photochemical properties of MMCs.66–70 The MMCs with excellent photophysical/photochemical characteristics can be selected by a reasonable combination of different metal ions and ligands.71–73 The MMCs possess interesting features like large Stokes shifts, high photostability, long luminescence lifetimes, the ability to extend to NIR absorption/emission wavelength, etc.73 Among many merits, MMCs with NIR absorption/emission wavelength are particularly important in accurate diagnosis and treatment because they reduce auto-fluorescence and light scattering and increase tissue penetration depth.56,57,74 The absorption and emission of MMCs can be caused by a variety of electronic transitions, including metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT),75 intraligand charge-transfer (ILCT),76,77 ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer (LLCT),78,79 ligand-to-metal–metal charge transfer (LMMCT),80 metal–metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MMLCT),80 and metal-to-ligand-ligand charge-transfer (MLLCT).80 As a result, by changing the metal ion or ligand, the wavelength of MMCs is red-shifted to the NIR region, affecting the numerous electronic transitions. The strategy of extending the wavelength of MMCs primarily entails extending π-systems, inserting polarizable heteroatoms (S, O),81 introducing electron-withdrawing substituents,82 introducing long absorption/emission ligands,83,84 metal–metal bond formation85,86 and introducing rare earth metal ions, etc.87–89 After that, we will go over how these strategies were applied to a variety of MMCs with different skeletons, as well as the associated photophysical and photochemical properties. The photophysical properties, imaging, and therapeutic types of MMCs were summarized in Table 1.

2.1 NIR-I MMCs

2.1.1 Polypyridine ligands. 
Polypyridyl ligands, such as 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and 2,20-bipyridine (bipy), have been instrumental in the advancement of coordination chemistry.90–92 These ligands, as a powerful chelating ligands, can form thermodynamically stable metal polypyridyl complexes with metal ions such as Pt, iridium (Ir), Pd, etc.93 Metal polypyridyl complexes have piqued the interest of researchers due to their coordination saturation, substitutional inertness and unique redox properties.94,95 Furthermore, because of their excellent photophysical and photochemical properties, they are widely used in catalysis,96 molecular devices,97 dye sensitizers for solar cells,98 and fluorescent probes.99 Since Dwyer et al. first reported the biological activity of metal polypyridyl complexes in 1950, there has been a great deal of interest in their potential anticancer properties.100 The anticancer mechanism of metal polypyridyl complexes is generally believed to be their ability to bind to DNA or related proteins in cells, causing cell death.101 In addition, metal polypyridyl complexes can act as photosensitizers, generating significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill cancer cells when exposed to light.102 Some luminescent metal polypyridyl complexes can also be used as bioimaging fluorescent probes.103 Long-wavelength metal polypyridyl complexes have been shown in recent studies to be very beneficial for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment. As a result, scientists have been working hard to develop long-wavelength metal polypyridyl complexes.
2.1.1.1 Ru(II) polypyridine complexes. 
Ruthenium easily forms hexagonal complexes and has abundant valence state changes, so it has excellent stability, diverse range of photochemical and photophysical properties, highly reactive excited states, long lifetimes, and exceptional luminescence performance. At the same time, ruthenium complexes have low toxicity, promising absorption and fast metabolism, making them ideal for use in biomedicine (Fig. 3).90,91 In 2020, Gasser et al. synthesized a series of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes with varying photophysical properties by incorporating different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents (–H, –CH3, –Br, –CONH2, and –CHCHN(CH3)) into the [Ru-(phen)2(bipy)]2+ and [Ru(bphen)2(bipy)]2+ scaffold to regulate the wavelength.104 In Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, the ruthenium t2g d orbitals constitute the highest occupied orbitals, while the lowest occupied orbitals are usually π* orbitals localized on the ligands.105 Therefore, MLCT should be characterized by lower-intensity absorption bands due to the t2g electronic transitions to the lowest orbitals of empty ligands, leading to the collective singlet state of MLCT under strong illumination. Therefore, the authors specially functionalized the ligands to reduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap and red-shift the absorption energy of MLCT. According to research, all the complexes had similar excitation and absorption spectra. Under excitation irradiation at 355 nm, the maximum emission wavelength of these complexes was between 600 nm and 710 nm. Importantly, complexes 1 and 2 with the vinyl dimethylamine group exhibited the highest redshift in absorption, and the maximum emission wavelength also showed a significant redshift (703 nm for 1 and 694 nm for 2). This was consistent with the theoretical calculation that complexes 1 and 2 have the smallest HOMO–LUMO energy gap (ΔEgap = 3.24 eV for 1 and ΔEgap = 3.17 eV for 2). In addition, the luminescence quantum yield of complexes 1 and 2 was less than 0.001. The singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields of complexes 1 and 2 range from 0.22 to 0.35 in CH3CN and from 0.07 to 0.21 in aqueous solution. These findings provided a reliable basis for subsequent PDT. In the same year, using the electron-donating groups described above, the authors introduced six vinyl dimethylamine groups into the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ core to extend the wavelength of the commercial ruthenium complex.106 Due to the extension of the π system and the terminal insertion of vinyl dimethylamine, the maximum MLCT transition of complex 3 had a strong redshift of 65 nm, and the extinction coefficient was greatly increased compared with that of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The maximum emission wavelength of complex 3 was 621 nm under excitation at 355 nm. However, it had a relatively low luminescence quantum yield. In addition, complex 3 was more easily taken up by HeLa cells. In 2019, Wang et al. synthesized a novel NIR emitting Ru(II) polypyridine complex containing thiophene[Ru(dtdpq)3](ClO4)2 (complex 4).107 Complex 4 displayed a significant solvent-induced discoloration behavior, with a visible emission maximum at 588 nm in dichloromethane and a shift to the NIR-I region at 700 nm in water. The maximum emission of complex 4 in DMSO was 629 nm, and the luminescence quantum yield was 0.087 (based on [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in water). Furthermore, complex 4 exhibited 1O2 generation yield of 23% in water and a DNA binding constant of approximately 106 M−1. Compared with [Ru(bpy)2(dtdpq)](ClO4)2, the addition of dithiophene groups remarkable improved DNA binding, photolysis and 1O2 production.
 Fig. 3  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I Ru(II) polypyridine complexes (1–7). 
The Ru(II) polypyridine complex had the characteristics of long absorption wavelength and high 1O2 quantum yield, and has great potential for application in photodynamic therapy. Zhang et al. (2010) reported a new isoelectric Ru(II) polypyridine complex [Ru(bpy)(dpb)(dppn)]2+ (complex 5).108 It can prolong the lifetime of MLCT states by maintaining their long-wave absorption. Complex 5 exhibited a maximum absorption of 1MLCT at 548 nm and a high 1O2 quantum yield of 0.43. The emission maximum of complex 5 was measured at 926 nm using a Millennium laser. The ligand dppn displayed a relatively long-lived 3MLCT (Ru → dpb) (229 ns) and a high-affinity binding for DNA (1.9 × 107 M−1). Overall, the combination of dpb and dppn in complex 5 results in excellent photodynamic effects, demonstrating the modularity and versatility of the heteroleptic Ru(II) complex. In 2020, Zhao et al. designed and synthesized seven Ru(II) polypyridine complexes by using Schiff base (iminopyridine or iminoquinoline analogues) and benzo[i]dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c] phenazine (dppn) to replace bipyridine ligands in [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2, respectively.109 The Schiff base ligand was used to regulate the wavelength redshift, while dppn was used to attain long-lived intraligand (3IL) excited states. Compared with the absorption peak of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 at 450 nm, the absorption peaks of all complexes showed the largest red shift above 470 nm. In methanol, the emission spectra of all complexes were between 700 and 900 nm. This was due to the distortion of the CN bond in the excited state. Among them, complex 6 showed the most significant redshift in absorption and a weak but distinct absorption band above 700 nm. Furthermore, complex 6 had a 1O2 quantum efficiency of 0.36 under irradiation at 465 nm (1.26 J cm−2) and was also capable of producing an effective amount of 1O2 at 650 nm (19.2 J cm−2) NIR-I photoexcitation. Complex 6 was extremely toxic to A549 and HepG2 cells, when exposed to 650 nm light, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 56 nM and 63 nM and phototoxicity index (PI) values of 763 and 613, respectively. Therefore, complex 6 showed good potential for therapeutic applications in the “therapeutic window”.
McFarland et al. (2022) introduced nine new NIR photosensitizers that utilize a Ru(II) tris-heteroleptic scaffold [Ru(NNN)(NN)(L)]Cln.110 These photosensitizers were created by combining π-expanded tridentate ligands with Ru(II), with the NNN ligands being referred to as chromophoric ligands. The π-expansion of these ligands in a direction orthogonal to the M–N bond was crucial in ensuring that the absorption wavelength falls within the NIR range. The ligand 2, 20-(4-(tert-butyl)pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1,8-naphthyridine) (tpbn) can form complexes with NIR absorption of around 800 nm. For improved 1O2 production, the dppn ligand had a low-energy 3IL state. The maximum absorption wavelength of these complexes in the NIR range ranged from 715 to 903 nm, which was primarily caused by Ru(dπ) → π* transitions. Combining a chlorinated ligand with a smaller pigmented tpbn ligand or a 4-pic with a larger pigmented tpbbn ligand results in a NIR maximum between these two extremes (805–820 nm and 785 nm, respectively). Small changes in substituents on the central pyridine ring of the smaller chromophoric ligand produced only minor redshifts in these bands. Among these complexes, compound 7 produced the highest 1O2 quantum yields (ΦΔ = 93%, λex = 630 nm and ΦΔ = 86%, λex = 753 nm). Compound 7 demonstrated good anti-melanoma activity against melanoma cells, with an EC50 value of 1.45 μM under 633 nm red light irradiation and 1.77 μM under 733 nm NIR light irradiation, respectively. The PI values of compound 7 were 43 with 633 nm red light and 35 with 733 nm NIR light. In mouse B16F10 melanoma cells, PDT treatment with compound 7 caused a proinflammatory response and immunogenic cell death.
2.1.1.2 Ir(III) polypyridine complex. 
The Ir(III) complex is regarded as one of the most efficient and adaptable biosensing and bioimaging agents owing to its unique strong spin-orbital coupling constant, high quantum yield, and adjustable spectrum (Fig. 4). The cationic Ir(III) complex can be rapidly absorbed by living cells due to its appropriate biocompatibility. Ir(III) complexes have been proven to be promising candidates for bioimaging and cell studies. Moreover, these complexes can accumulate in large amounts exclusively in mitochondria, making them even more suitable for further research in this field. In 2017, Sun et al. synthesized five heterosensory cationic Ir(III) complexes using a π-expansive cyclometalating 2,3-diphenylbenzo[g]quinoxaline (dpbq) ligand (C–N ligand) and various diimine ligands (N–N ligands).111 The absorption spectra of all complexes had substantial molar extinction coefficients (6.0–6.8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) below 350 nm, which was mainly attributed to the 1π, π*/1ILCT transition of the dpbq ligand. The absorption bands between 400–500 nm were mainly generated by 1π,π*/1MLCT/1ILCT/1LMCT transitions occurring in the center of the dpbq ligand. The low energy absorption bands between 500–600 nm were primarily derived from dpbq ligand associated 1ILCT/1MLCT transitions mixed with some 1π,π* characters. All complexes exhibited faint but distinct absorption bands between 600–800 nm (ε < 200 M−1 cm−1), which were attributed to the forbidden-spin transition to the three-state excited states. Most importantly, all complexes had a maximum emission wavelength in the 700–1400 nm range, with weak NIR phosphorescence and quantum yield of about 10−3. Among them, complex 8 showed the strongest photocytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.012 μM, visible light and EC50 = 0.20 μM, red light) and the highest phototoxicity index (PI = 273, visible light and PI = 16, red light). Therefore, complex 8 demonstrated the highest level of in vitro PDT efficacy, exhibiting superior photocytotoxicity and a higher phototherapeutic index compared to other complexes tested. In 2017, Chao et al. synthesized a set of novel Ir(III) complexes using the auxiliary ligands, 3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline (mpq).112 These complexes displayed low absorption bands within the 330–400 nm range while exhibiting intense absorption bands within the 250–325 nm range. Their maximum emission peak was in the range of 672–702 nm, and Stokes's shift was greater than 300 nm. Among them, compound 9 exhibited the longest emission wavelength (702 nm). The luminescence quantum yield of compound 9 was 0.112 in PBS, 0.132 in methanol, and 0.465 in dichloromethane. In addition, the luminescence lifetime of compound 9 reached 189.3 ns in PBS. Due to its excellent optical properties, compound 9 was employed successfully as a multifunctional imaging agent in monolayer cells, multicellular tumor spherules (MCTSs) and animal tissues.
 Fig. 4  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I Ir(III) polypyridine complexes (8–14). 
In 2017, Xu et al. reported two NIR-emitted cationic iridium(III) complexes.113 These two complexes had similar absorption spectra in the range of 300–600 nm. The absorption bands below 350 nm were attributed to π → π* transitions of ligands with spin, while the absorption bands observed above 350 nm were attributed to mixed transitions of 1MLCT and 3MLCT with LLCT. The two complexes exhibited nearly identical emission bands at 750 nm. Complex 10 has a luminescence quantum yield of up to 0.85. In addition, complex 10 has a long phosphorescent lifetime (456 ns). Because of its larger planar aromatic area, compound 10 has a higher quantum yield and a longer lifespan. These excellent photophysics and imaging properties enable its wide application in the field of biological imaging. In 2017, Zhu et al. synthesized two new Ir(III) complexes using fused heterocyclic phenazine derivatives as ligands.114 The Ir(III) complexes showed different emission characteristics related to the number of benzo rings. Compound 11 exhibited a strong NIR emission peak at 732 nm, with a luminescence quantum yield of 13% and a lifetime of 0.60 μs. Qiao et al. (2020) reported a new NIR homoleptic Ir(III) complex (compound 12).115 Complex 12 had a weak absorption band beyond 700 nm, indicating excitation from the ground state to the lowest tristate (S0–T1). It also exhibited pure NIR emission beyond 700 nm with a maximum peak at 850 nm. In a CH2Cl2 solution, the luminescence quantum yield of complex 12 was 0.015 and the lifetime was 0.16 ms. In 2020, Chao et al. reported a novel lysosomal targeting and NIR emission phosphorescent probe (complex 13) for the visualization of NO/O2˙− cross-talk via the detection of protonated peroxynitrite (ONOO−) in vivo.116 As the concentration of ONOO− (0–1.5 equiv.) increased, the emission intensity of complex 13 at 702 nm gradually increased (∼100-fold). The phosphorescent quantum yield Φ increased from 0.009 to 0.128. Furthermore, the detection limit (LOD) of ONOO− was about 49.8 nM, indicating that complex 13 was highly sensitive to ONOO−. Complex 13 was capable of responding to ONOO− within 200 s. Due to these excellent properties, complex 13 could identify intracellular ONOO− in both in vitro and in vivo living organisms. In 2022, Yoshihara et al. developed an Ir(III) complex 14 for in vivo oxygen imaging.117 Complex 14, which features a π expansive ligand based on a mesomesityl dipyrromethene and phenylpyridine ligands, had been shown to enhance intracellular uptake. Complex 14 exhibited a maximum absorption wavelength at 577 nm. The maximum emission wavelength of complex 14 was 773 nm. Complex 14 exhibited a longer phosphorescence lifetime (18.5 μs in deaerated MeCN) and a larger Stokes shift compared to the standard fluorescent probe. Complex 14 had high cellular uptake and was predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
2.1.1.3 Pt(II) polypyridine complex. 
In general, Pt(II) metal complexes with a d8 electron configuration are distinguished by their planar molecular geometry, allowing for strong intermolecular metal contacts via d–d orbital interactions.118 This facilitates the formation of dimers or multimers of Pt(II) complexes, resulting in a significantly red-shifted emission compared to the monomeric species. The process of MMLCT transitions involves the excitation of electrons from the filled Pt⋯Pt antibonding dσ* orbital to the empty complex π* orbital (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I Pt(II) polypyridine complexes (15–21). 
In 2018, Tian et al. designed two novel Pt(II) complexes with C^N^C cyclometalated ligands and different substituents as auxiliary ligands.119 The σ-donor and π-acceptors can boost the energy of the metal-center d orbitals, minimizing non-radiative decay. The ability of Pt(II) complexes to push–pull electrons was modulated by introducing auxiliary ligands with varying electron-donating capacities, which further establishes the link between spectral and electronic properties. The absorption spectra of the two complexes showed a clear absorption band at 280 nm caused by the 1π, π* transition of the 1IL ligand. The low-energy absorption band between 325 and 550 nm was caused by the dyz(Pt) → π*(C^N^C) and dxz(Pt) → π*(C–N–C) 1MLCT transitions. The absorption band between 340–380 nm was the result of dyz(Pt) → π*(C–N–C) transition, which was minimally affected by various auxiliary ligands. The use of auxiliary ligands ranging from PPh3 (acceptor) to pyridyl (D–π–A) type donors caused a low band redshift, indicating that the absorption band was caused by the dxz(Pt) → π*(C–N–C) transition. The LUMOs of the two complexes had the same energy and were located at the C–N–C trigonal position. The energy of dxz was mainly determined from the auxiliary ligands with different electron-donating capacities. This eventually led to a smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap and a redshift in the absorption band. The emission bands of the two complexes were mainly distributed in the 500–600 nm range, which is attributed to the 3MLCT[dπ(Pt) → π*(C–N–C)] transition. Importantly, complex 15 exhibited a high emission peak at 663 nm with decreasing temperature, which could be attributed to ground-state aggregation emission. Complex 15 had a high quantum yield (9.1%) and a medium three-state excited state lifetime (5.32 μs).
In the same year, Wong et al. reported a NIR platinum complex with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics by introducing tetrapyryl (TPE) into a terpyridyl Pt(II) complex (complex 16).120 The Pt(II) core with a tripyridinyl structure displayed robust intermolecular interactions and produced emissive MMLCT excited states. When in an aggregate state, the TPE group not only elongated the π-conjugation of the complex but also reduced the intense π–π stacking. Additionally, the pentaethylene glycol group could enhance its biocompatibility. The absorption band of complex 16 at 263–330 nm was attributed to the intraligand [π → π*] transition of the alkynyl and terpyridine ligands, and the absorption band at 375–490 nm was attributed to [dπ(Pt) → π(terpyridine).] and [π(alkynyl) → π*(terpyridine)] mixed transitions. Because of molecular aggregates, complex 16 exhibited a new broad absorption band (520–650 nm) in water or ethyl acetate. Complex 16 barely emitted in acetonitrile, but showed a strong NIR-I emission at 730 nm with increasing water volume, which may be attributed to aggregation-induced MMLCT emission and restricted TPE motion. In 2021, Ni et al. reported a series of diimine Pt(II) complexes by combining the one-dimensional (1D) “Pt wire” structure with the electronic effects of substituents.121 The electron-withdrawing group in the pyridine ligand and the electron-donating group in the phenylacetylene ligand can greatly reduce the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. In the solid state, these complexes showed low-energy absorption bands between 600 and 783 nm due to the MMLCT transition. All complexes exhibited long-wavelength NIR emissions ranging from 935 to 1044 nm. Compound 17 characterized by a 1/2 toluene crystal structure exhibited the maximum emission wavelength at 984 nm. Furthermore, after the methyl group was replaced with ethyl, the emission wavelength of compound 17 could be redshifted to the NIR-II region, with the Pt⋯Pt distance being the smallest. In 2021, Bonnet et al. further investigated the Pt⋯Pt interactions at a cellular level.122 The authors synthesized two isomeric Pt(II) complexes using the tetradentate ligands HMeL1 and HMeL2. Complex 18 was further away from the bridging NMe group. In the dimer, the Pt⋯Pt distance of complex 18 was 3.26 Å. Also, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap decreased from 4.13 eV (monomer) to 3.39 eV (dimer). The maximum emission wavelengths of complex 18 in pure water were located at 651 and 687 nm, which were attributed to 3MLCT and 3MMLCT transition emissions from the polymer self-assembly through metallophilic interaction. In opti-MEM complete solution, a new absorption peak for complex 18 appeared at 540 nm and the maximum emission peak was at 699 nm. This coincides with the spectral characteristics of the complexes in the solid state. These findings further open up new directions for the development of bioimaging nanoplatforms based on Pt⋯Pt interactions.
In 2022, Gareth Williams et al. designed a novel series of Pt(II) complexes based on the Pt(N–C–N)X skeleton.123 It has been demonstrated that SCN- or I-containing complexes can modulate the formation of the aggregates more than Cl-containing complexes. I-containing complexes had been found to restrict the formation of aggregates in dimers. On the other hand, the presence of SCN had been observed to promote the formation of larger aggregates. The electroluminescence of complex 19 was red-shifted beyond 940 nm. This value was by far the longest wavelength for an electroluminescent aggregated Pt(II) complex. Chi et al. (2020) found that the introduction of bulky substituents in Pt(II) isoquinolino pyrazole complexes did not consistently promote metalophilic Pt⋯Pt interactions.124 In contrast, the MMLCT transitions are highly influenced by π–π stacking between chelates fine-tuned by the relevant substituents. Among them, complex 20 exhibited the longest emission wavelength (691 nm) and the largest luminescence quantum yield of 96.8% in solid thin films. In 2022, Yang et al. synthesized a series of binuclear Pt(II) complexes with strong Pt⋯Pt and π–π interactions using rigid carboline as a bridging ligand.86 In doped polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films, complex 21 showed a strong emission peak (10 wt%) at 690 nm. In addition, the luminescence quantum yield was 40%, and the emission lifetime was 0.89 ms.
2.1.1.4 Cr(III) polypyridine complex. 
Octahedral Cr(III) complexes allow metal-centered spin-flip Cr(2E → 4A2) and Cr(2T1 → 4A2) emissions in the range of 600–800 nm due to the strong ligand field of the Cr(III) ion (Fig. 6).125 In 2015, Heinze et al. synthesized a novel Cr(III) complex (complex 22) under the large N–Cr–N occlusion angle of the tridentate ddpd ligand and its strong s-donor capability.125 The ddpd ligand had been observed to enhance the energy of the 4T2 state in complex 22, while simultaneously decreasing the energy of the 2E state. This effect led to an overall increase in the 4T2/2E energy gap, which ultimately prevented back-intersystem crossing from taking place. This contributed to an increase in the NIR phosphorescence quantum yield and lifetime of complex 22. The maximum value of the low energy absorption of complex 22 was 435 nm in CH3CN, which was attributed to the 4A2 → 4T2 and LMCT transition. The absence of the MLCT transition was most likely due to the ddpd ligand's poor electron-accepting characteristics and the inaccessible CrIII/IV oxidation. Under excitation at 435 nm, complex 22 showed a strong, sharp emission peak at 775 nm as the 2E emission and a weak emission peak at 738 nm as the 2T1 emission. The luminescence quantum yield of the complex in CH3CN was determined to be 12.1% with a lifetime of emitting doublet states of about 899 μs. These were by far the highest values for Cr(III) complexes at room temperature.
 Fig. 6  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I Cr(III) polypyridine complexes (22–25). 
In 2021, Heinze et al. introduced a novel Cr(III) complex [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (complex 23) (bpmp = 2,6-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)pyridine)with remarkable luminescence properties.126 Complex 23 produced a very sharp emission peak at 709 nm under light excitation at 462 nm. In addition, the photoluminescence quantum yield of complex 23 in D2O at room temperature was up to 20% with a lifespan of 1800 μs. In 2019, Heinze et al. designed a near octahedral symmetry Cr(III) complex [Cr(tpe)2]3+ (complex 24) (tpe = 1,1,1-tris(pyridin-2-yl)ethane).127 Complex 24 produced an asymmetric and broad emission band at 748 nm (λex = 428 nm). It exhibited distinct peaks at 775 and 738 nm, indicating the presence of octahedral Cr(III) complexes in their lowest-energy doublet states. Complex 24 exhibited an unusually extended luminescence lifetime (t = 4500 ms) and a luminescence quantum yield of 8.2% in a room-temperature fluid solution. In 2017, Lovaasen et al. synthesized a bis-arylterpyridyl Cr(III) complex (complex 25).128 The maximum phosphorescence emission wavelength of complex 25 was 796 nm, and it exhibited higher phosphorescence intensity compared to Cr(tpy)23+. The emission lifetime of complex 25 (600 ns) was longer than that of Cr(tpy)23+ (140 ns). Increased electron delocalization on the aryltripyridine ligand in the 2Eg (Oh) excited state resulted in a longer emission lifetime.
2.1.1.5 Os(II) polypyridine complex. 
Compared to other metal complexes such as Ru, Ir, and Pt, the osmium (Os) complex has unique features. This is due to the π-conjugate structure of the ligand and the heavy atomic effect provided by the Os center. As a result, these complexes can red-shift wavelengths into the NIR region, which allows for increased penetration depth in deeper tissues (Fig. 7). Therefore, the selection of Os complexes with simple structures and wavelengths in the NIR region is crucial for in vivo studies.129 Gasser et al. successfully prepared and characterized a series of simple Os(II) polypyridine complexes containing 4,7-diphenylphenanthroline ligands.130 The single crystal structure shows that the Os atom was coordinated with the orthophilline ligand via the N atom in a twisted octahedral geometry. All complexes exhibited panchromatic absorption spectra ranging from 240 to 840 nm, which distinguishes them from the previously reported Ru(II) complexes. The IL ππ* transition of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DIP) resulted in a sharp and intense peak at 280 nm. Additionally, the absorption peaks at 450 and 500 nm were attributed to MLCT Os(dπ) → ligand (π*) transitions. Finally, a weaker and broader absorption band was observed at 650–750 nm, which was attributed to spin-forbidden MLCT transitions resulting from direct single–triplet-state transitions. Among them, complex 26 exhibited high killing efficiency and high PI against most cancer cells (118 for A2780, 87 for RPE-1) in PBS, with a 1O2 quantum yield of 6.2% (using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a reference). The PI values of complex 26 with different antagonistic anions PF6− and Cl− were significantly different in CT-26. In addition, McFarland et al. synthesized a series of Os(II) polypyridine complexes with thiophene chains of varying lengths. These complexes were based on a similar skeleton to the Ru(II) complex TLD1433, which had completed phase I clinical trials.131 As the amount of thiophene in the Os(II) complex increased, the logDo/w value also increased gradually, suggesting an enhancement in lipophilicity. These complexes exhibited strong absorption bands within the range of 400–525 nm, which were attributed to the Os(dπ)/phen(π*) MLCT transition. Additionally, the absorption bands gradually weakened and widened near 700 nm, indicating an analogous spin-forbidden MLCT transition. The IL ππ* transition on the phen/IP ligands was responsible for the sharper peaks near 300 nm. In degassed acetonitrile, all Os(II) complexes displayed a single, broad emission peak. The introduction of thiophene resulted in a reduction of the emission energy compared to [Os(phen)3]2+. However, each subsequent addition of thiophene had a minimal effect with a shift of approximately 3 nm, and the respective excitation spectra remained relatively unchanged. Complex 27, which contained four thiophenes, exhibited the highest emission wavelength at 746 nm and the highest 1O2 quantum yield of 0.95. Complex 27 exhibited the longest delayed emission lifetime (14–16 μs) when exposed to 355 nm laser irradiation, in contrast to nanosecond lifetime observed for other Os(II) complexes. Additionally, all Os(II) complexes were relatively nontoxic in the absence of light, but phototoxicity increased with an increase in the concentration of thiophene. Complex 27 demonstrated picomolar activity and a PI value exceeding 106 under normal oxygen conditions. Importantly, complex 27 exhibited a PI value of over 70 under red light, which is unprecedented and suggests the promising potential for future applications.
 Fig. 7  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I Os(II) polypyridine complexes (26–28). 
To develop Os complexes that are photostable and capable of NIR imaging, Thomas et al. synthesized a series of TAP-type complexes using Ru(II) or Os(II) as metal centers for stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging in the NIR region.132 Despite the almost identical structure and similar DNA binding properties of Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes, their photophysical properties differed greatly. Compared with Ru(II) complexes, Os(II) complexes exhibited superior photostability during extended laser irradiation. The optical properties remained unchanged and no photobleaching was observed during cell imaging. Compound 28's absorption spectrum displayed a double peak in the visible region ranging from 400 to 500 nm and extended up to 750 nm. Compound 28 displayed a wide and unstructured emission band in the range of 680 to 1100 nm, with a maximum emission wavelength of approximately 780 nm. This was due to the low-lying Os → TAP based 3MCLT state. Additionally, it had a luminescence quantum yield of 1.03 × 10−3. Compound 28 did not exhibit cytotoxic or photo-cytotoxic properties like Ru(II) complexes. However, it had high photostability, and long-wavelength emission, and was able to penetrate live cells. These properties make it an excellent probe for optical microscopy.


2.1.2 Porphyrin ligands. 
Porphyrins are 18-electron-conjugated macrocyclic compounds composed of four pyrrole rings linked through a methylene bond.133 Because of their exceptional molecular coordination characteristics, they can easily form NIR-I complexes with the majority of the metal ions in the periodic table (Fig. 8).134 In 2007, Brown et al. reported a Pt(II)-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (tpbp) complex (compound 29).135 Due to the increased conjugation degree of the porphyrin center, the absorption and emission spectra of tpbp are significantly redshifted relative to those of the unsubstituted porphyrins. The inclusion of bulky groups on the β-substituted pyrrole might result in the formation of non-planar porphyrins, further redshifting the absorption spectra. The introduction of heavy metal atoms reduces the energy level difference between the single and triplet states of metalloporphyrins, thereby improving the radiative decay rate of the triplet state. Compound 29 exhibited strong absorption peaks at 430 nm (ε = 2.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1), and 611 nm (ε = 1.35 × 105 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The phosphorescence emission spectrum of complex 29 demonstrated the maximum emission wavelength at 765 nm. In addition, its phosphorescence lifetime at room temperature was 53 μs and its photoluminescent quantum yield was 0.7. Subsequently, Schanze et al. synthesized a tetraarylanthroporphyrin (compound 30) with a maximum emission wavelength of 891 nm based on compound 29 by extending the π-conjugation.136

In 2017, Dong et al. reported a zinc porphyrin (compound 31) with strong NIR absorption.137 Compound 31 showed a strong absorption at 668 nm and a shoulder peak at 610 nm. The luminescence spectrum of complex 31 showed a strong peak at 709 nm and a shoulder at 760 nm. Importantly, the photodynamic effect was greatly enhanced by the introduction of metallic zinc, resulting in a 1O2 quantum yield of up to 79% for compound 31. In addition, compound 31 had a favorable photothermal effect. Therefore, it had the potential to be a promising photothermal photosensitizer for cancer therapy. In 2019, Zhang et al. synthesized a series of novel Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes utilizing tetradentate macrocyclic benzitripyrrin (C^N^N^N).138 The coordination of metal ions resulted in a red-shift in the absorption/emission spectra of the complex relative to those of the ligand. These metal complexes absorbed strongly in the 320–400 nm and 500–750 nm wavelength ranges. These complexes exhibited a red shift of ∼45 nm in the high energy range and ∼150 nm in the low energy range compared to the corresponding ligands. The emission wavelengths of all metal complexes were located in the range of 700–1000 nm under 600 or 700 nm excitation, which were red-shifted by approximately 130 nm compared to those of the ligands. Among them, complex 31 exhibited an intense NIR fluorescence signal at 732 nm and an intense vibronic band at 792 nm. Furthermore, compound 32 exhibited a strong luminescence, whereas the phosphorescence was essentially non-existent, probably due to the O-bridging substituted methine linker reducing the degree of π-conjugation of the complex. The luminescence quantum yield of compound 32 was 6%, and the luminescence lifetime was about 1.06 ns. These outstanding results promoted the development of Pd(II) complexes in biomedicine. In 2020, Sessler et al. synthesized a series of NIR metallotexaphyrin compounds using texaphyrins as ligands.139 Texaphyrins are penta-aza Schiff base expanded porphyrins that were capable of forming stable complexes with different functional metal cations. These metal complexes outperformed indocyanine green (ICG) in terms of photostability. Compound 33 produced no 1O2 and exhibited an excellent PA signal when exposed to light at 725 nm. This could be attributed to the fact that Mn(II) is a good luminescence quencher, promoting efficient non-radiative decay and effective PA imaging.
In addition, extended porphyrins consisting of five or more pyrrole rings were important fluorophores for NIR dyes due to their flexible and large π-conjugated systems. In 2008, Furuta et al., synthesized a new series of double N-confused calix[6]phyrin ligands and their Pt(II) complexes.140 The complexes contained a rectangular coordination environment of six nitrogen and two carbon atoms and two divalent platinum metal ions. All the Pt(II) complexes had two strong absorption peaks at around 650 nm and 720 nm. These binuclear porphyrin ligands do not emit; however, their Pt(II) complexes exhibited NIR luminescence at ambient temperature. Complex 34 exhibited a strong emission wavelength (986 nm) and a large quantum yield (1.8 × 10−3). Furthermore, Pt(II) complexes with cyclohexyl groups caused a 25 nm red shift in the emission peak when compared to Pt(II) complexes with methyl groups. The substitution of the cyclohexyl to methyl group increased the luminous lifetime of the Pt(II) complexes. The luminous lifetime of the double Pt(II) complex was substantially shorter than that of the single Pt(II) complex, which could be attributed to the presence of two heavy atoms and the small energy gap in the double Pt(II) complex. This was the first instance of a confused expanded porphyrinoids with two unsymmetrical coordination cavities, resulting in a stable bis-metal complex. Smaller spin–orbit coupling increased the lifetime of the triplet state, while a smaller atomic number decreases spin–orbit coupling. As a result, the researchers had therefore synthesized new bispalladiumcalix[6]phyrin complexes (complex 35) by replacing the platinum metal with palladium having a smaller atomic number.141 The maximum peak in the low energy absorption band of complex 35 was 619 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 9.07 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In addition, the trans-configured complex exhibited a relatively strong shoulder band in the low-energy region. Under excitation at 532 nm, the maximum emission peak of complex 35 was observed at 977 nm, and the phosphorescence quantum yield was 1.2 × 10−3. Complex 35 exhibited a phosphorescence duration of 183 ns, which was much longer than the luminescence lifetime of the Pt-calix[6] phyrin complex (20–30 ns). Complex 35 showed a high singlet oxygen quantum yield (0.30), possibly because Pd substitution improved the triplet lifetime of the complex. The calix[6] porphyrin complexes had promising applications in photodynamic therapeutics due to the ease of synthesis, high single oxygen production capacity and good photostability. Due to the peculiar structure of porphyrins, a trinuclear porphyrin complex (complex 36) with three cavities was synthesized by Song et al. in 2016.142 Complex 36 featured a strong NIR absorption and a curved π-plane. Therefore, this new porphyrin complex with polymetallic coordination offered a lot of practical potential. In 2017, Sessler et al. reported a novel 26π electron expanded porphyrin bis-rhodium complex (complex 37).143 Complex 37 has an aromatic Hückel character and it exhibited a prominent absorption peak at 1014 nm with a maximum molar absorbance of 3.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Contrary to most porphyrin derivatives, complex 37 had a larger Q-band extinction coefficient than the Soret band. Unfortunately, complex 37 was not luminescent. In 2017, Therien et al. synthesized a series of a (porphinato)metal(II)-spacer-(porphinato)metal(II) (PM-Sp-PM) complexes.144 Depending on the contribution of the quinoidal resonance to the electron-excited singlet state, the Sp group can vary the maximum absorption of the complex's long-axis polarized Q state (Qx). These highly conjugated complexes exhibited strong NIR absorption properties. Among them, the maximum absorption wavelength of complex 38 was 839 nm with the maximum emission wavelength of 995 nm. Complex 38 showed a weaker emission with a quantum yield of 0.003.


2.1.3 Fluorophore-containing ligands. 
As ligands, π-conjugated organic chromophores with NIR absorption/emission can significantly lower the HOMO–LUMO gap of MMCs (Fig. 9).145 The incorporation of π-bonded organic chromophores into MMC can effectively prolong the lifetime of 3π,π* MMC states. MMC operates in the lowest triplet excited state (T1), with the ground-state absorption red-shifted to longer wavelengths.146 In 2020, Peng et al. synthesized a new Ru(II) complex photosensitizer (complex 39) by using cyanine dyes as ligands.147 Compared with the traditional Ru(II) polypyridine complex, complex 39 had a maximum MLCT absorption at ∼660 nm with a red shift of ∼100 nm. Complex 39, like conventional Ru(II) complexes, was non-luminescent at 660 nm. However, complex 39 exhibited green luminescence under excitation at 450 nm. Importantly, complex 39 is positively charged for rapid uptake into cells, has excellent water solubility, and localizes into lysosomes. Complex 39 demonstrated good PDT effect and biocompatibility. In the same year, Wong et al. reported the synthesis of an Ir(III) complex (complex 40) employing rhodamine as a ligand.148 Complex 40 had a high 1O2 generation capacity and can be specifically localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
 Fig. 9  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I MMCs containing fluorophore ligands (39–46). 
In 2021, Chao et al. synthesized a novel Ru(II)-difluoroboron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complex (complex 41) for NIR-driven photosensitization via a π-conjugated connection between the BODIPY fluorophore and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex.149 Complex 41 exhibited strong absorption in the visible region between 550–650 nm, which was mostly due to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ absorption. In the NIR region, the maximum absorption peak of complex 41 was observed at 652 nm (ε = 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1), which can be attributed to the π–π* transition of the BODIPY fluorophore. The maximum emission peak of complex 41 was observed at 681 nm, with a luminescence quantum yield of 27.5. It exhibited a greater1O2 quantum yield of 0.77 at 660 nm excitation compared to the BODIPY ligand. Furthermore, in 2022, Gong et al. developed a NIR BODIPY–Ir complex (complex 42) by introducing BODIPY fluorescent ligands into Ir(III) complexes.150 The maximum absorption and emission peaks of complex 42 were observed at 740 nm and 810 nm, respectively. In addition, complex 42 exhibited a strong photoacoustic signal at 740 nm. To improve the efficiency of ROS generation, Sun et al. (2021) developed a novel NIR Ir(III) complex (complex 43).151 The high-energy absorption band of complex 43 was located at ∼450 nm and the low-energy absorption band was located at 550–750 nm. The low energy absorption band of complex 43 in water was red-shifted by 17 nm compared with that in DMF, which was attributed to J-aggregation caused by π–π interaction between molecules in water. The maximum emission peak of complex 43 in DMF was located at 680 nm with a lifetime shorter than 10 ns, and a luminescence quantum yield of less than 1%. The very low luminescence quantum yield of complex 43 was due to the inter-system crossing caused by the heavy atoms, which rapidly populated the triple excited state. In 2020, Zhao et al. synthesized a novel series of NIR Pt(II) complexes by replacing the boron ion in aza-BODIPY with platinum ions.152 Pt atoms can assist the intersystem cross-over from the singlet-to-triplet transition, allowing oxygen to 1O2 conversion. The aza-BODIPY skeleton provided a very strong photothermal effect. Of these, complex 44 had the longest NIR absorption peak at 717 nm (ε = 0.5 × 105 M−1 cm−1), due to the stronger electron-donating ability of carbazole compared to fluorene and benzothiophene. The maximum emission peak of complex 44 was at 811 nm. Because complex 44 showed a lower luminescence quantum yield than the ligand, chelation of Pt atoms may enhance intersystem cross-over. In addition, complex 44 had the best PTT and PDT effects. Similarly, in 2021, the authors introduced Pt(II) ions as well as iodine atoms into the aza-BODIPY skeleton to design and construct a NIR Pt(II) complex (complex 45) for enhanced phototherapeutic effects.153 In 2018, Wong et al. developed a series of Pt(II) complexes using isomeric donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated fluorophores and Pt(II) ion coordination.154 These Pt(II) complexes displayed significantly altered photophysical properties when the coordination group was changed from quinoline to [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (pyT) and finally to pyridine. The high energy absorption band of complex 46 in the 300–400 nm range was attributed to the π–π* transition of the fluorescent ligand, the intermediate absorption band in the 400–500 nm range belonged to the MLCT transition, and the 520–750 nm absorption band was dominated by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, as well as part of the MLCT transition. The maximum emission peak of complex 46 in non-polar hexane was at 682 nm and at 761 nm in polar dichloromethane. The presence of strong ICT within the molecule may be the cause of this larger solvatochromism. Complex 46 also exhibited a luminescence quantum yield of 0.6 and a lifespan of 0.33 μs.

2.2 NIR-II MMCs

2.2.1 Polypyridine ligands. 
Due to the generally weak ligand field of transition metal ions, most metal complexes emit poorly at room temperature, especially in the NIR-II region (Fig. 10).155 To solve this problem, Heinze et al., reported a vanadium(III) complex with NIR-II region emission mer-[V(ddpd)2][PF6]3 (complex 47) using the strong field ligand ddpd (N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-dipyridine-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine) and metallic vanadium(III) coordination.156 On the one hand, a strong ligand field can block the back-ISC from the 1Eg/1T2g state to the 3T2g state, making the 3T2g state more dynamic than the singlet state. Furthermore, the high-density 3T2g state energy was conducive to facilitating the ISC from triplets to singlet manifolds. These two design principles were beneficial in enhancing the NIR-II emission of complex 47. In CH3CN, complex 47 had a broad absorption band at around 597 nm, a shoulder band at around 475 nm, an asymmetric absorption band at 422 nm, and a strong absorption band at 301 nm. The molar absorbance coefficients for these absorption bands were all substantially above 1000 M−1 cm−1, indicating a clear charge transfer (CT) character. Complex 47 exhibited double emission peaks at 396 and 1109/1123 nm in a deaerated CH3CN solution under 306 nm excitation at room temperature. The emission peak at 396 nm was associated with fluorescence, while the NIR-II emission band at 1109/1123 nm was related to phosphorescence. The phosphorescent quantum yield of complex 47 in CH3CN was 1.8 × 10−4%. Although this value was not particularly high, it had a very sharp emission band (full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 325 cm−1). This was the first successful synthesis of blue and NIR-II luminescent complexes with metallic vanadium, offering great promise for the future use of luminescent vanadium complexes.
 Fig. 10  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-II MMCs containing polypyridine ligands (47–48). 
In addition, by optimizing the ligand field intensity, the emission wavelength is redshifted to the NIR-II region. In 2021, Wenger et al., synthesized a Cr(III) complex that emits luminescence in the NIR-II region through a combination of π-donor and π-acceptor interactions to promote metal–ligand bond covalency.157 Complex 48 consisted of a central π-donor amino group and two σ-donor and σ-acceptor groups, which together contributed to thenear-perfect octahedral geometry of the Cr(III) metal. The absorption band of complex 48 between 220 and 330 nm was attributed to the π–π* transition in the center of the ligand. The absorption band ranging from 330 to 450 nm was primarily caused by the LMCT transition, MLCT transition, and the weaker MC transition. An absorption peak at 500 nm was evident due to ILCT between the carbazole and pyridine units. The absorption peak at 521 nm was attributed to a significant 4A2 → 4T2 transition. Complex 48 was excited at 450 nm in 77 K acetonitrile with a maximum emission wavelength of 1067 nm and trailing to 1350 nm. The emission signal at 1067 nm decreased double exponentially with lifetimes of 1.4 μs (88%) or 6.3 μs (12%) under excitation at 350 nm. This was the first Cr(III) complex with an emission wavelength in the NIR-II region.


2.2.2 Porphyrin ligands. 
Porphyrin complexes can be red-shifted to the NIR-II region by J-aggregation (Fig. 11).158 In 2022, Wong et al., synthesized a Pt(II) complex (complex 49) for hypoxia-activated NIR-II phosphorescence imaging by inserting a steric phenyl ring group at the meso-position of Pt(II)-porphyrin.158 Complex 49 generated J-aggregates in the solid state, resulting in a significant red-shifted multi-emission peak in the NIR-II window. Complex 49 displayed a Soret band absorption peak at approximately 391 nm and Q band absorption peaks at 502 and 533 nm in a dilute tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. Additionally, in the same solution, strong vis-NIR-I emission peaks were observed at ∼636 nm and 689 nm, along with a weak NIR-II luminous signal at wavelengths greater than 1000 nm. In the solid-state, complex 49 displayed several notable NIR-II emission peaks. However, the emission peaks at approximately 636 and 689 nm were barely detectable. This phenomenon may be attributed to the formation of ordered J-aggregates. To improve biocompatibility, complex 49 was encapsulated in a commercially available amphiphilic triblock copolymer (Pluronic F127) to construct water-soluble nanoparticles (49 NPs). The highest sensitivity to O2 was observed at a loading ratio of 4.76% for complex 49, with a 4.06-fold increase in NIR-II signal values after deoxygenation. In addition, complex 49 NPs4.76 exhibited a NIR-II phosphorescence lifetime of a microsecond (35.33 μs). This “end-to-tail” J-aggregation strategy for wavelength red-shifting will aid in the development of NIR-II phosphorescent organic dyes with low-oxygen activation.
 Fig. 11  Chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-II MMCs containing porphyrin ligands (49–54). 
To red-shift the wavelength of monomeric porphyrin complexes to the NIR-II region or even longer, scientists had developed many strategies, including lateral π-extension through multiple fusions at the periphery, core extension to the limit, and the use of open-shell radicalized structures.159–161 However, when the HOMO–LUMO energy gap was less than 0.83 eV, the dye molecule became unstable. This was mostly due to the fact that raised HOMO orbitals were sensitive to oxidative degradation, whereas lowered LUMO orbitals may be extremely electrophilic.162 To address this problem, Furuta et al. (2020) proposed a metal-coupled MO hybrid method for the synthesis of a series of bimetallic complexes through the complexation of simple 26π-conjugated hexaphyrin derivatives with Pd(II) or Pt(II) metals.162 Structural modification of the main hexalectin core using an n-disordering approach resulted in a symmetry shift (i.e., HOMO inversion), pronounced dπ–ppπ interactions, and a reduction in the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The bis-Pt(II) complex (complex 50) had an absorption wavelength that exceeded 1700 nm in the NIR-III region (1500–1850 nm), with the maximal photoacoustic (PA) signal occurring at 1700 nm. This makes it a suitable contrast agent for NIR-III PA imaging. It was worth noting that solid-state bis-Pd(II) complexes were rare NIR emitters above 1500 nm. These findings suggested a new approach for molecular engineering of NIR-III dyes for biological imaging of deep tissue.
In the same year, the authors also reported a variety of bimetallic (Zn and Cu) dioxohexaphyrin complexes having photo-responsive characteristics in the NIR-II region.163 In this paper, the authors presented a new approach to differentiate between cisoid-dioxohexaphyrin homologues that are nonaromatic and transoid-dioxohexaphyrin homologues that are strongly aromatic. One of the nonaromatic cis-structures exhibited unique redox reactivity and was converted to a 26π Hückel-aromatic homologue during bimetallic-induced oxidation. The new cis-homologue with two carbonyl groups in the same cavity featured a saddle-twisted π-conjugate circuit with moderate aromaticity. Due to their unique aromatic electronic structure, the transoid bis-metal complexes of dioxohexaphyrins had a strong absorption/emission/PA signal in the NIR-II region. Compared to the commercial NIR-II dyes (IR-26 and IR-1040), dioxohexaphyrins dyes had extremely high photostability, making PA imaging of deep tissues possible. In this case, the PA signal of the metal–copper chelated dioxohexaphyrin complex (complex 51) was 1.4-fold higher than that of the free ligand, demonstrating that the metal coordination enhanced the PA signal intensity. Furthermore, when activated with laser light in the NIR-II region, complex 51 demonstrated an effective photoacoustic response. This was the first example of a NIR-II-responsive extended porphyrin-based photoacoustic contrast agent.
Recently NIR-II emitting lanthanide (Ln) complexes have emerged as potential candidates for various applications owing to their compact size, unique f–f emission, significant Stokes shifts, and exceptional photostability and chemical stability.164 In 2018, Zhang et al. reported a new generation of low molecular weight lanthanide conjugates (conjugate 52) (0.54 kDa), which were synthesized by a one-step process, for targeted image-guided in situ surgery and metastatic ovarian cancer in the NIR-II region.165 Complex 52 exhibited a broad absorption band located at 400–900 nm and stimulated emission (4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transition) located around 1057 nm in the NIR region. Under 808 nm excitation, complex 52 showed two NIR-II emission peaks at approximately 1060 nm and 1330 nm, respectively, with a broad Stokes shift and narrow FWHM (∼28 nm). Furthermore, the luminescence lifetime of complex 52 at 1060 nm was approximately 5.37 μs. Complex 52 possessed excellent water solubility, photostability, and high levels of renal clearance. It could also detect cancers via molecular imaging when paired with folic acid-targeting agents. Nevertheless, NIR Ln emission was readily burst by high-energy X–H bond (X = C, N and O) vibrations induced by ligands and solvents.166 Furthermore, due to the low luminescence quantum yield of NIR Ln molecular probes (<3% in water), only a small number of probes were employed for cellular imaging.167–169
To enhance the NIR emission of Ln metals, Seitz170 and Charbonnière171,172et al. first replaced the high vibrational energy X–H bonds with X–D/F bonds for extended Ln metal radiative lifetimes and tuning ligands to sensitize Ln metals. Unfortunately, the poor solubility and low cellular uptake of these Ln complexes limited their cellular and in vivo use. To overcome this challenge, Zhang et al. reported a perfluorinated Yb3+ porphyrinate with a quantum yield of up to ∼25% in the NIR region. In addition, the quantum yield of Yb3+ complexes in water was as high as 5–13%, which could be used for live cell imaging.173 To further investigate the metabolism and imaging of Yb3+ complexes in vivo, the researchers synthesized a carboxylic acid-modified water-soluble β-fluorinated Yb3+ complex (complex 53) for NIR-II whole-body bioimaging.174 Complex 53 exhibited a strong Soret band at ∼410 nm and a Q-band at 525–650 nm (>104 M−1 cm−1). Under Soret or Q-band excitation, the emission spectrum of complex 53 exhibited a range of 900–1100 nm, which is attributed to the strong 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+. In water, complex 53 had a higher quantum yield (10%) and luminescence lifetime (140 μs), with a brightness (ε × Φ) of approximately 103 M−1 cm−1. In addition, complex 53 had a metabolic mechanism in vivo similar to that of organic small molecules, ruling out the disadvantage that nanoprobes were difficult to metabolize. When compared to traditional organic dyes, the luminescence of Ln complexes was metal-centric and so had a higher photostability as well as an environment-independent emission band. In addition, the researchers developed a series of clickable, high-efficiency NIR bioorthogonal lanthanide molecular probes by introducing bioorthogonal functional groups such as azide and alkyne on Yb3+ complexes.175 These Yb3+ complexes can be combined with various biomolecular labeling strategies for multi-color imaging. And their excellent photophysical properties and bioorthogonality made them the first example of NIR expansion microscopy (ExM) imaging. To achieve an energy match between ligand and Ln metal Er(III) emission levels as well as excitation extension into the NIR region, Zhang et al. reported an erbium(III)–bacteriochlorin complex (complex 54) with a large Stokes shift and narrowband NIR-to-NIR downconversion spectrum.176 Complex 54 exhibited four absorption bands (By, Bx, Qx and Qy bands) in dichloromethane. The introduction of Er(III) ions drastically altered the wavelength and oscillator intensity of the ligand. The Qy band, for instance, was located at 766 nm and was red-shifted by 18 nm when compared to the ligand. Complex 54 had a molar absorbance value of 113000 M−1 cm−1 and an FWHM of 15 nm. Under the stimulation of a 760 nm laser, the emission spectrum of complex 54 was observed at about 1530 nm (FWHM = 20 nm, which corresponds to the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition. The absolute quantum yield of complex 54 in PBS was 0.01%, the only value of Er(III) complexes in the water system documented. In PBS, the luminescent lifetime at 1530 nm was 1.73 μs. The luminance (ε × Φ) of complex 54 micelle solution was about 11 M−1 cm−1 in the 1400–1600 nm range, which was equivalent to or even higher than that of NIR-II fluorophores with an emission wavelength of about ∼1100 nm. Under the excitation of a 760 nm laser, the maximum tissue penetration depth of complex 54 was about 8 mm. In addition, the spectral overlap between complex 54 and other available NIR-II fluorophores can be used for multiplexed NIR imaging.


2.2.3 Fluorophore-containing ligands. 
In addition to the strategies discussed above, J-aggregation, metal-coupled MO hybrid, and rare earth metals can successfully red-shift the wavelengths of MMCs to the NIR-II region. Another simpler approach is to conjugate fluorophores with NIR-II absorption/emission to MMCs, hence imparting NIR-II region features to the MMCs (Fig. 12).177,178 Gou et al. reported an NIR-triggered D–A conjugated Ru(II)-arene complex (55) using NIR-II fluorophores and Ru(II)-arene acceptors for coordination.177 The absorption band of complex 55 in DMF was located at 600–900 nm, with an absorption peak at 729 nm. In addition, the increase in water content of complex 55 caused the maximum absorption peak to redshift to 800 nm, indicating J-aggregation in water. The maximum emission wavelength of complex 55 was 1050 nm, and the Stokes shift was about 300 nm, indicating that the geometry of the excited state had changed significantly to form a lower energy excited state. The luminescence quantum yield of complex 55 in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) was 3.3% (0.6% in CH3OH), while the emission wavelength in 5% aqueous methanol showed a minor red shift and a decrease in quantum yield (0.22%), possibly due to self-assembly. More importantly, in the aggregated state, complex 55 can only generate 1O2, probably due to the greatly increased inter-system crossing process between the singlet and triplet states in the aggregated state. Complex 55 showed efficient 1O2 production and good photothermal effects, with a 1O2 quantum yield of 16.4% (ΦΔ = 0.2% for ICG) and a photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2%. In summary, complex 55 was an efficient PDT/PTT agent. Furthermore, researchers synthesized a stable NIR-II emissive Ir(III) complex 56, using the same fluorescent ligand described above with an Ir(III) acceptor bearing a C–N ligand.178 Complex 55 and complex 56 exhibited similar absorption and emission spectra and luminescence quantum yield. The distinction was that complex 56 can generate ROS via a type I mechanism, lessening its reliance on oxygen dependence. In addition, the ROS quantum yield of complex 56 was 14.6% and the PCE was increased to 27.5% compared to complex 55. Complex 56 exhibited excellent photostability and high-efficiency PDT and PTT synergies, owing to aggregation and substantial ICT caused by intermolecular interaction and intramolecular mobility. In addition, Xiao et al. successfully constructed a NIR-II emissive Ru(II) complex (complex 57) utilizing the identical donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) fluorophore chelated with Ru(bpy)2Cl2(bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) and PEGylation.179 Complex 57 had maximum absorption and emission wavelengths of 822 and 1028 nm in water, respectively, which were red-shifted by 92 and 42 nm, respectively, when compared to the fluorescent ligand. The quantum yield of complex 57 in an aqueous solution was 0.42% (IR-26 = 0.5%). Complex 57 also possessed good photostability and pH stability. Complex 57 demonstrated good chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy on U87MG cells under 808 nm laser light irradiation (IC50 = 20.97 μM).

2.3 Two-photon excited MMCs
Two-photon MMCs are excited with long wavelength light in the NIR region and emit upconverted two-photon fluorescence (TPF) due to two-photon absorption.180–182 Two-photon microscopy (TPM) employs a femtosecond (Fs) pulsed laser to stimulate MMCs with two photons generated simultaneously in the NIR region.183–185 As a result, the technique improved visualization of the target sample depth (∼1000 mm), while minimizing toxicity, auto-fluorescence, and light scattering.185–187 This technique was developed by Maria Goeppert–Mayer in the 1930s.188 To commemorate him, the scientific community adopted the Goeppert-Mayer abbreviation (1 GM = 1 × 10−50 s mol−1) as the unit for the value of the two-photon absorption (2PA) cross-section (σ2), which was related to the quantitative degree of two-photon absorption.189 Most photosensitizers used in 2P-PDT are porphyrins and tetrapyrrole derivatives, which possess favorable physical and biological properties. However, their σ2 values are comparatively low. For instance, photofrin in methanol had a σ value of 10 GM at 800 nm.190 GM values were often related to MMC size, symmetry, charge, ambient conditions and functional groups.191 In general, MMCs with large conjugation length systems and strong push–pull electronic properties were beneficial for increasing GM values (Fig. 13).192

Lemercier's group was the first to use Ru(II) polypyridine compounds for two-photon PDT in 2008.193 The single-photon absorption bands of complex 58 were mainly concentrated at 267 nm, 335 nm and 410–460 nm. The absorption peak at 267 nm corresponds to 1,10-phenanthroline, the absorption peak at 335 nm corresponds to ILCT, while the low-energy absorption in the 410–460 nm range is attributed to MLCT. Similarly, the absorption bands of complex 58 were observed at 272 nm, 340 nm, 400 nm and 450 nm, and the peaks were attributed to the former. Complex 58 had an absorption cross-section of 120 GM at 830 nm, while complex 58 had an absorption cross-section of 90 GM at 750 nm, with the latter's wavelength blueshift and reduction in the two-photon cross-section attributed to the reduced conjugation of the ligand. The absorption spectra were attributed to the triplet–triplet absorption of the Ru(II) triplet chelate's 3MLCT excited state. The decay time of these transient absorption signals was on the order of microseconds, which was consistent with the luminescence lifetime. Complex 58 had a luminous lifetime of 2.5 ms compared to complex 58's 0.7 ms. The shorter luminescence lifetime of complex 59 implied that its three MLCT and fluorene triplet states were in a quick equilibrium state. As an adjustment, this group picked a mono-fluorenyl Ru(II) complex and increased its biocompatibility by inserting a hydrophilic triethylene glycol group at the fluorene's ninth position.194 The new complex's single and two-photon absorption properties were identical to those of its hydrophobic parent. This compound had a 40 GM two-photon cross-section in CH3CN at 740 nm. Morphological changes in cells could be observed when they were exposed to complex 60 and two-photon excitation under continuous irradiation with a 740 nm laser.
Ru(II) complexes had received a lot of attention in the realm of two-photon photosensitizers because of their unique photophysical features, especially polypyridine Ru(II) complexes.195 By reasonably modifying the rigid π-conjugation plane on pyridine, its electron-donating ability at coordination can be improved.196 More importantly, it is expected to insert the central orbital of the donor into the metal front orbital.197 This could boost the MLCT rate, allowing the MMCs' absorption wavelength to be extended. Gilles Gasser et al. synthesized seven Ru(II) complexes by extending different numbers of double bonds and substituted phenyl groups on Ru(bpy)32+.198 The photophysical behavior of different molecules revealed that the presence of trans-stilbene in the molecule is essential for achieving a large 2PA cross-section. As compared to Ru(bpy)32+, these complexes exhibited a 50–70 nm red-shift, with absorption wavelengths between 250 nm to 700 nm and an absorption tail within the biological window. In addition, complex 61 had a 2PA cross-section of up to 6800 GM in DCM. A long-excited state lifetime in both its degassed (338 ns) and aerated saturated (76 ns) states, indicating that it can react with an air component. More importantly, under the irradiation of 740 nm light, the ruthenium complex 61 can be used as a transition metal co-catalyst for the metal photo-oxidation C–C coupling reaction.199
Mitochondria are cell life factories that are involved in energy conversion, tricarboxylic acid cycle, calcium ion storage, and other critical processes. They are also strongly associated to apoptosis.200 When localized in mitochondria, photosensitizers can disrupt the redox homeostasis of mitochondria, leading to the activation of the associated death signaling pathway, which in turn stimulates apoptosis.201 The researchers created a two-photon photosensitizer (complex 62) with mitochondrial targeting and added a triphenylphosphine cation with variable spacing of saturated carbon atoms to the molecule.202 Complex 62 exhibited a strong MLCT absorption band at around 460 nm. The luminescence attenuation experiments at 298 K showed that the lifetime of complex 62 was 264 ns. In addition, complex 62 exhibited a very high 1O2 quantum yield (0.81) in methanol and an appreciable 2PA cross–section (198 GM) at 810–830 nm. HeLa cell localization experiments showed that complex 62 was mainly located in mitochondria with a correlation coefficient of about 0.88. Furthermore, higher two-photon absorption was seen in a 3D tumor model with a volume of 800 mm. As an important parameter of photosensitizers, the charge can directly affect the 2PA cross-section of the photosensitizer. By introducing amine cations with different alkyl chain lengths on the polypyridine ligand of Ru(bpy)32+, the group was able to effectively adjust its 2PA cross–section.203 Under excitation with light at 800 nm, complex 63 showed a maximum TPA cross-section value of 250 GM, while the 2PA cross-section value of Ru(bpy)32+ was 66 GM. The 1O2 quantum yield of complex 63 was 99% in methanol and 67% in D2O by direct comparison with the 1O2 emission areas of phenenone at around 1270 nm under 450 nm irradiation. Moreover, this highly charged two-photon photosensitizer linked to different alkylamine groups can effectively modulate its logP (−1.55) and the way through the cell membrane (internalization). This photosensitizer can efficiently localize into the lysosome, avoiding severe dark toxicity of cells in the same way that mitochondrial localization and genetic alterations in nucleus localization do.
Chao et al. developed and synthesized a series of pheromone imidazole ligand Ir(II) complexes by replacing the substituents (hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, aminomethyl, fluorine and tert-butyl and phenoxy) connected to the nitrogen atom of imidazole.204 The complexes with two-photon imaging and three-photon imaging capabilities were evaluated. The absorption spectra of these complexes range from 250 nm–420 nm, and these absorptions can be assigned to 1MLCT and 3MLCT and ILCT, while the maximum emission wavelength is around 600 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield of complex 64 was 0.42 in air and 0.74 in degassed solution. Under 980 nm excitation, the two-photon cross-section and three-photon cross-section of complex 64 were 101 GM and 2.63 × 10−78 cm6 s2 photon−2, respectively. In vivo studies demonstrate that the maximum penetration depth of complex 64 extended to ∼1000 μm under 980 nm three-photon excitation, compared to only 400 μm under 750 nm two-photon excitation. The ability to perform deeper tissue imaging in vivo while simultaneously performing PDT was the most significant advantage of two-photon photosensitizers. Most two-photon photosensitizers were highly oxygen dependent. By modulating the aforementioned similar backbone and adopting the method of peroxyanthracene, the researchers have synthesized new Ir(II) anthracene-based complexes 65, which can achieve tumor suppressive effects in the nanomolar range even under hypoxic conditions.205 The endoperoxide-functionalized complex 65 outperforms the anthracene-based precursor in terms of luminescence. Under the irradiation of 405 nm (20 mW cm−2) light, complex 65 can continuously release oxygen under the condition of hypoxia and exhibits 80% luminescence attenuation after two minutes. Under low oxygen conditions, complex 65 had a longer excited state lifetime than the anthracene-based precursor. Complex 65 can effectively generate 1O2 under normal and anoxic conditions; the latter mechanism is due to the ROS released by complex 65 itself. Under anoxic conditions, complex 65 can produce a highly cytotoxic iridium(III) complex, 1O2 and an alkoxy radical after laser irradiation in PBS solution. Complex 65 showed a 2PA cross-section of 297 GM at 750 nm in a methanol solution.
In addition, by replacing the auxiliary ligand 2-phenylpyridine with 2-phenylbenzo[d]-thiazole, complex 66 possessed enhanced two-photon absorption and ROS production properties compared to the precursors.206 Interestingly, the subcellular organelle localization of small molecules shifted from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria, showing enhanced two-photon excitation for photodynamic immunotherapy. Complex 66 showed a prominent absorption band in the 300–350 nm range, with an absorption tail length of about 500 nm. The 1O2 quantum yield of complex 66 in methanol was 0.35 under 405 nm excitation and was accompanied by superoxide anion production. Complex 66 showed a 2PA cross-section of 75 GM in the 740–800 nm range.
In addition to the excellent two-photon properties of ruthenium and iridium polypyridine complexes mentioned above, the two-photon properties of porphyrin derivatives have also been further investigated. Vinogradov et al. combined a series of porphyrin derivatives and investigated their structure–activity relationship.207 It was shown that the synergistic fusion with aromatic groups and the reduction of symmetry of porphyrin derivatives are effective strategies to increase their two-photon cross–sections. Furthermore, the addition of alkoxycarbonyl groups to the benzene of synthetic dibenzoporphyrins leads to a sharp enhancement of the two-photon cross-section in the B-band region. Complex 67 with the best photophysical properties showed the largest 2PA cross-section at 750 nm (213 GM). Also, complex 67 showed an extremely high phosphorescence quantum yield (0.45). Osuka et al. expanded the conjugated electron system of porphyrins by modifying the 4-asparagon-based structure of porphyrins.208 Their research showed that the azulene structures at different substitution positions do not affect the degree of conjugation of the porphyrins equally, with the 1-position and 6-position having a smaller effect compared to the 4-position azulene. Besides, when the azure complex 68 was fused directly to the porphyrin, the absorption wavelength was longer than when it was joined by a single bond. The quadruple asphaltene-fused complex 68 showed a drastic absorption spectrum at 684 and 1136 nm, covering the entire visible and NIR regions up to about 1200 nm. Complex 68 exhibited an exceptionally narrow HOMO–LUMO gap (1.01 V) in benzonitrile, according to cyclic voltammetry curves. An attractive 2PA cross-section is 7170 GM at 1380 nm, encompassing complex 68 with sufficient penetration depth. Marder et al. designed and synthesized a porphyrin complex 69, with strong ICT, by employing a square acid derivative as an electron acceptor and an alkynyl porphyrin derivative as an electron donor.209 Complex 69 exhibited strong absorptions at 425 nm and 736 nm, corresponding to the characteristic absorptions of porphyrin and square acid derivatives, respectively. The two-photon absorption wavelength of compound 69 was notably broad (1300–1550 nm), with 2PA cross-sections greater than 780 GM, and a peak cross-section value of 11000 GM. Complex 69 had a significant 2PA cross-section due to the presence of a lot of electronic interactions between the porphyrin and the square acid derivative. The existence of multiple single-electron absorption states in compound 69 may lead to the overlap of multiple transitions, resulting in its broad two-photon absorption.
3. Construction and properties of metal–organic complexes (MOCs)
In natural systems, non-covalent interactions are commonly employed to construct complex and functional biomolecules that execute a range of biological functions. Inspired by nature, chemists have used the coordination metal bonds between Lewis basic organic donors and Lewis acidic metal acceptors to guide the assembly of molecular precursors.210–212 Due to the directionality and reversibility of metal–ligand coordination interactions, discrete MOCs with well-defined sizes and shapes can be efficiently designed and synthesized via metal–ligand directed self-assembly. MOCs have several advantages over MMCs, including inherent ring tension and positive charge, adjustable cavity size, and the prevention of unfavorable stacking. These benefits can result in improved photophysical properties, increased cell uptake and enhanced therapeutic effects of MOCs.213–215 The first coordination macrocycle was synthesized by Verkade, and since then, various approaches for the design and preparation of MOCs have been described.216 Particular attention has been paid to the development of NIR MOCs, and the exploration of related photophysical properties and biomedical applications.217–221 Using long-wavelength fluorophores as ligands or acceptors and introducing ligands with two-photon excitation in the NIR region are the basic strategies for creating MOCs in the NIR region.64,222–224 In addition, the metallacycles or metallacage with a fixed shape play a critical role in improving the photophysical characteristics of ligands.210,225,226 Following that, we will go through how these tactics were used to successfully build MMCs in the NIR region, and their impact on the associated photophysical properties. The photophysical properties, imaging, and therapeutic types of MOCs were summarized in Table 2.

3.1 NIR-I MOCs
D–A structures, BODIPY fluorophores, cyanine fluorophores, perylene bisimide fluorophores (PPy), and porphyrin are the major ligands employed in the production of NIR-I MOCs (Fig. 14). Stang et al. (2017) prepared a long-wavelength ligand using pyridine rather than the classical AIE-type 9,10-diphenyl (DSA) derivative and obtained two rectangular MOCs via heteronuclear coordination in a water/acetone system with a 90° bis(triethylphosphine) Pt(II) acceptor and two differently angled bicarboxylic acid ligands. Both compounds exhibited strong optical absorption at about 425 nm, with a weak shoulder peak absorption at 540 nm. Metallacycle 70 had the longest emission wavelength of 672 nm. In addition, it showed strong solvent effects in many solvents, and high-intensity luminescence in both dilute solution and aggregated states. When the polarity of the solvent was increased, an irregular change in emission wavelength occurred. Its emission intensity was strong in solvents like toluene, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, but lower in polar solvents like ethyl acetate, methanol and water. When exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere, the film of the complexes changed from red to yellow, which was because ammonia disrupts the coordination of the pyridine nitrogen atom with platinum.227 By introducing a D–A structure into the structure, the emission wavelength of the ligand can be easily adjusted to the NIR-I region. With morpholine as an electron donor and α-cyanopyridine vinyl as an acceptor, the NIR ligand, which had a maximum emission of 735 nm, was self-assembled with the Pt(II) acceptor to obtain metallacycle 71. The flexibility of the α-cyanopyridine ethylene ligand enabled the coordination of the cis-Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 receptor in a [6+6] mode with a controlled angle of 180°. The introduction of the metal acceptor generated a bathochromic shift of 36 nm at the maximum emission wavelength of 1% DMSO/H2O. The presence of the ligand α-cyanostyrene led to AIEE properties, as demonstrated by a luminescence quantum yield of 6.90% in 1% DMSO/H2O solution and 11.63% in solids. The metallacycle luminescence quantum yields were less than 0.5%, demonstrating that metal–pyridine coordination bonds play an important role in luminescence emission. Dynamic light scattering was used to examine the stability of three metallacycles in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium, and the results showed that they were stable for up to two days. Cellular assays revealed that metallacycle 71 had the best cytostatic activity among the three compounds, outperforming cisplatin.228
 Fig. 14  The chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-I MOCs (70–71) not containing fluorophores. 
As the most important class of NIR organic fluorescent small molecules, cyanine dye is an excellent fluorescent ligand for MOCs due to its high molar extinction coefficient, significant luminescence quantum yield, adjustable absorption/emission wavelength and easy modification (Fig. 15).229 Zhang et al. designed and synthesized the first hexagonal MOCs using an anthocyanine dye (IR780) as a side chain 120° ligand and benzophenone Pt(PEt3)2OTf as a 120° acceptor.230 The successfully prepared metallacycle 72 was directly wrapped in amphiphilic polymers for property testing. The PEC was 8.05% at a chemical concentration of 30 μg mL−1 and a temperature rise of 23 °C under NIR light irradiation. Metallacycle 72 showed strong NIR absorption at 780 nm. When the pH was 5.4, the nanoparticle release efficiency was 47.1%, which was 3.18% higher than that in a neutral environment (pH = 7.4). In addition, the presence of Cl− and Br− leads to the breaking of the coordination bonds between pyridine and platinum of the metallacycle, resulting in the release of free metal acceptors and cyanine ligands. The quaternary ammonium cation of the cyanine fraction allows it to target mitochondria in cancer cells, enhancing the phototherapeutic effect.

BODIPY has outstanding performance in NIR fluorescent dyes due to its superior photophysical properties, strong structural modifiability and high stability. The high absorption coefficient makes BODIPY more flexible in excited state energy distribution, particularly in photodynamic therapy.231 In addition, pyridine alteration at positions 2 and 6 on BODIPY can be employed as a 180° fluorescent ligand in the construction of MOCs. Zhou et al. combined a 180° bipyridyl BODIPY ligand and two 60° Pt(II) receptors using a [3+3] coordination self-assembly strategy to produce two high-emission triangular metal rings. Among them, the BODIPY ligand in the metallacycle can be used for cell imaging. In addition, BODIPY fluorophores are excellent photodynamic agents that can be used as metallacycle agents in conjunction with PDT and chemotherapy.232 To further redshift the emission wavelength to the NIR region, Yin and Stang used two triangular metallacycles formed by the phenylmercaptan BODIPY ligand with platinum coordination at longer wavelengths. Among them, metallacycle 73 emitted red luminescence at about 660 nm, and was successfully used for bioimaging and intra-tumor transport visualization. In addition, the chemotherapeutic action based on the platinum(II) acceptor and the BODIPY's high 1O2 generation capacity had a good synergistic therapeutic effect.233 In addition, Zhao et al. synthesized a series of 60° ligands by introducing alkynyl groups into the BODIPY skeleton and then reported a series of NIR absorption metallacycles using the coordination of alkynyl groups with the 180° Pt(II) acceptor. The optimized conformation demonstrates that the entire ring had a planar structure, stacked in the lower capacity AA type, and was highly stable. The metallacycle 74 exhibited strong NIR absorption at 760 nm (66900 L mol−1 cm−1), indicating remarkable light-trapping ability. The metallacycle 74 showed low luminescence quantum yields compared to the BODIPY precursors because the introduction of Pt effectively quenched the luminescence, and the energy of the metallacycle excited state was consumed by the singlet-to-triplet transition and nonradiative decay. Photothermal measurements revealed that rigid square planar Pt can contribute to the photothermal effect through enhanced nonradiative attenuation. Encapsulated in amphiphilic polymers, metallacycle 74 had a PCE of 31.1% and a good photothermal cycle. The combination of PTT and chemotherapy demonstrated remarkable anti-tumor effects, offering valuable insights for the advancement of biomedical supramolecular materials with superior performance.234
Perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI) derivatives, like BODIPY fluorite, are excellent NIR fluorite ligands in metallacycle synthesis. They have tremendous practical potential in the field of metallacycles due to their outstanding photothermal and chemical stability, high luminescence quantum yield, large Stokes shift and ease of modification.235 Sun et al. synthesized highly stable ligand-based metallacycles derived from NIR perylenediamine ligands via a spontaneous deprotection self-assembly process. This type of emission octyl organic palladium metallacycle had excellent chemical stability and 1O2 generation ability. In the NIR region, metallacycle 75 exhibited a prominent red emission band, with maximum emission wavelength concentrated at 617 nm and 627 nm. When compared to the ligand, the photoluminescence rate of the metallacycle 75 was lowered by 50.7%. This may be due to the aggregation of the metallacycle leading to luminescence quenching.236 To solve the problem of luminescence quenching, Mao et al. synthesized a hexagonal metallacycle 76 of diplatinum(II) metal precursor (TPE-Pt) with long wavelength perylene diimide fluorophores (PPy) using a tetraphene with a colligation-induced luminescence as a coordination unit.237 The formation of the metallacycle greatly inhibited the π–π stacking interaction of PPy due to the insertion of spiral TPE fluorophores and the electrostatic interaction of pyridine cations. However, the very short distance and spectral overlap between the donor and recipient within the molecule led to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (energy transfer efficiency ≈68.4%), which altered the luminescence lifetime of the fluorophore. Furthermore, the luminescence intensity and quantum yield of metallacycle 76 were much higher than those of PPy. Chen et al. synthesized a self-assembled metallacage 77 with a multi-component coordination drive using porphyrin ligands, possessing coordination-enhanced NIR emission and 1O2 quantum yield. Importantly, metallacage 77 achieved ternary imaging of NIR luminescence, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) after chelating Mn2+ or 64Cu.223
3.2 NIR-II MOCs
Compared with NIR-I MOCs, NIR-II MOCs provide prominent advantages in precision diagnosis and treatment, due to significantly reduced photon scattering and self-fluorescence appearance (Fig. 16). Prior to the first reported case of NIR-II MOCs, Sun and Stang used amphiphilic polymer 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoethanolamine-N-methoxy(polyethyleneglyco)-5000 (DSPE-mPEG5000) to simultaneously encase the NIR-II fluorescent dye and chemo-effective metallacycle to achieve NIR-II luminescence image-guided chemotherapy.219,221 Unfortunately, due to the dose mismatch between the imaging agent and therapeutic agent, as well as the instability of the amphiphilic polymer in the physiological environment, imaging and treatment are difficult to be completely consistent in time and space, making accurate diagnosis and treatment challenging. To address these issues, our research group reported the first example of NIR-II luminescence metallacycle 78 with chemotherapeutic effects obtained by self-assembly of a bipyridine-modified aza-BODIPY fluorescent ligand with a dinuclear arene-ruthenium acceptor.64 Metallacycle 78 had a maximum absorption of 874 nm in DCM and a maximum emission of 1085 nm, resulting in precise imaging performance (penetration depth up to 6 mm) in the NIR-II region. The pseudo-planar structure junoridine with strong electron donating ability was the foundation for this aza-BODIPY maximum emission over 1000 nm. The fixed shape and size of metallacycle 78 confer excellent cellular uptake, underpinned by its suitable lipophilicity compared to the ligand (logPo/w = 0.54) and Ru(II) acceptor (logPo/w = −0.79). Also, the aza-BODIPY ligand was a highly effective phototherapeutic agent, endowing the metallacycle with both photothermal and photodynamic properties. Unfortunately, metallacycle 78 possessed higher dark toxicity due to the metal ion. As a result, our group recently proposed a π-expansion acceptor strategy to simultaneously reduce dark toxicity and increase phototoxicity. The results showed that the metallacycle with the largest π-expansion acceptor exhibited the highest PI (∼146) and ROS generation capability. This study provided a reliable solution to the dark toxicity caused by heavy metal ions in MOCs.238 In addition to the construction of Ru(II) metallacycles in the NIR-II region, our group also used the above fluorescent ligand to construct the first case of Pt(II) metallacycle 79 in the NIR-II region for antibacterial research. Metallacycle 79 can be activated by irradiation with a 980 nm laser and emits luminescence at 1100 nm. Compared to ligand, metallacycle 79 significantly improved PCE and 1O2 generation efficiency and had a good bactericidal ability under safe laser irradiation (0.72 W cm−2).239
 Fig. 16  The chemical structures and maximum absorption/emission wavelengths of NIR-II MOCs (78–81) containing fluorophores. 
Although the MOCs mentioned above could reduce the luminescence quenching of ligands to a certain extent, it was not AIE MOC. To address this issue, Wang et al. (2022) delicately constructed a prismatic metallacage 81 by using a benzobisthiadiazole-type NIR-II ligand with a 90° Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 acceptor in DMSO.62 Using the semi-empirical molecular orbital method of PM6, calculations indicate that the height of the triangle inside the prism is 39.3 Å, the side length is 29.5 Å, and the cross-sectional area of the triangle is 294 Å2. Metallacage 81 exhibited a broad absorption peak at the high energy π–π* band at 370 nm, and a charge transfer band at 672 nm with a tail trailing to more than 800 nm. The emission of metallacage 81 in DMSO from 800 nm to 1250 nm can be used for NIR-II imaging. This metallacage had a higher luminescence quantum yield of about 1.61% than the classical NIR-II contrast agents, carbon nanotubes (0.4%), and CH1055-PEG (0.3%). The non-planarity of the four-armed NIR-II ligand core and the presence of alkyl chains with steric hindrance allowed the trigonal prism to have lower symmetry than the classical molecular prism, a feature that is responsible for the AIE properties of the metallacage. The metallacage outperformed the prior ligand in PDT performance. On the one hand, the cavity provided by the cage structure enabled the metallacage to have full contact with oxygen in the state of aggregation; on the other hand, it was due to the intersystem crossing promoted by heavy atoms and the rigid structure of the cage. The metallacage had excellent photothermal conversion (39.3%), and its photothermal conversion remained stable after six cycles of irradiation/cooling. In vitro experiments showed that the metallacage had excellent tumor imaging ability and inhibition.
3.3 Two-photon excited MOCs
As far as we know, the rigid MOC structure is conducive to improving TPA performance due to its enhanced strain-induced charge polarization and ligand conformational strain.241 As a result of combining the advantages of NIR two-photon and supramolecular metal complexes, NIR-activated MOCs have great potential in the biomedical field (Fig. 17). The large conjugated planar structure and electronic push–pull properties were favorable factors for the best two-photon performance of MOCs. In 2015, Zhao et al. synthesized a series of metallacycles 82 based on phenanthroline and compared their photophysical properties separately.242 The triple excited states of these metallacycles exhibited two distinct characteristics, namely, ligand/metal–ligand charge transfer and acetylated ligand center features, which were dependent on the conjugate length and electronic properties of the cyclic ligands. These metallacycles exhibited substantial 2PA activity across a relatively broad spectral in the NIR region. Among these metallacycles, metallacycle 82 possessed the maximum 2PA cross-section of 1020 GM, corresponding to LC excitation. These findings confirmed that building metallacycle structures with related Pt-based complexes can greatly boost 2PA capacity. Besides, the higher the elongation and polarization of the π conjugate scaffold of the ligand, the more planar the conformation, both of which contributed to the expansion of the 2PA cross-section. These metallacycle structures also had other useful nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including broadband transient triplet absorption and reverse saturation absorption.

As mentioned above, the Ru(II) polypyridine complex has outstanding photodynamic and two-photon characteristics, and it can considerably boost the therapeutic impact of MOCs. In 2018, Stang and Chao et al. designed and synthesized a supramolecular heterometallic Ru–Pt metallacycle 83 by ligand-driven self-assembly.243 The metallacycle exhibited bathochromic luminescence in the NIR region, a larger 2PA cross-section (1371 GM), and higher efficiency of 1O2 generation. MOCs may confer favorable photophysical properties to this Ru(II) complex compared to similar MMCs for biomedical applications such as bathochromic shift emission and enhanced TPA activity. Additionally, the use of heavy metals such as platinum promoted the efficient generation of ROS through intersystem crossing. The highly charged nature of the resulting MOCs likely facilitated PDT-mediated internalization and selective accumulation in susceptible intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and nuclei. This provided a model for the development of efficient two-photon PDT agents.
Due to the 3D structure and a large number of functional parts within the same integration, 3D metallacages with high structural complexity can give higher photophysical and biological qualities than 2D metallacages. Fang et al. synthesized a 3D metallacage 84 with a 2PA cross-section of up to 2010 GM at 750 nm by introducing an olefin bond between triphenylamine and pyridine with potassium salt of p-dibenzoate and a 90° Pt(II) acceptor, which was 2.4 times higher than that of the ligand. Metalamides had higher multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) compared to organic ligands due to the π-extension and stiffening effects of aromatics increased by coordination in metalamides.244 Similarly, Su et al. combined eight Ir(III)-based photosensitizers and four Pd-based acceptors in a highly ordered cubic metallacage 85. Metallacage 85 demonstrated adequate water solubility, increased efficiency of 1O2 production following laser irradiation, favorable cellular uptake, and specific mitochondrial targeting ability, resulting in effective cell death in cancer cells. In addition, the metallacage 85 had a maximum 2PA cross-section of 783 GM between 720 and 880 nm, whereas the precursor has a cross-section of just 31 GM.245 Stang et al. designed and synthesized 3D octahedral metallacage 86 through the coordination of Ru(II)-based photosensitizers and Pt(II) acceptors. Under 820 nm laser excitation, metallacage 86 demonstrated exceptional two-photon performance.213 Under MLCT excitation, metallacage 86 displayed unstructured red emission bands centered at 673 nm, with a redshift of ∼30 nm relative to the ligand. The long lifetime (>400 ns) and enhanced luminescence quantum yield of the emission suggest a possible phosphorescence emission. Metallacage 86 exhibited the highest two-photon absorption of 5468 GM at 820 nm, while the Ru(II) polypyridine ligand had a two-photon cross-section of 161 GM. The 1O2 quantum yield of metallacage 86 was 85.0% under 1270 nm laser excitation, with Ru(bpy)32+ solution serving as a reference (ΦΔ = 81.0%). Therefore, compared with 2D metallacycles, 3D metallacages have greater application potential in two-photon and PDT.
4. Construction and properties of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
MOF nanomaterials have attracted substantial scientific interest in recent years as a novel type of nano-porous material for biosensing, photocatalysis, and drug delivery applications.246,247 Owing to the advantages of easily adjustable linker structures, highly accessible functional sites and high porosity, MOF nanomaterials have been widely used in loading drugs, metal nanoparticles, proteins and photosensitizers to develop multifunctional nanoplatforms.248,249 Compared with MOCs, MOFs have a broad range of metal types and ligands. In particular, metal ions can be selected from a variety of metal ions with high biocompatibility such as iron, copper, zirconium, hafnium, and zinc, and side effects can be minimized by selecting appropriate metal ions. In addition, the unique cavity and large specific surface area afforded by MOFs can avoid ROS quenching, thereby boosting phototherapy efficiency.250,251
While MOF nanomaterials primarily focus on visible light excitation and emission, NIR excitation and emission cover a much broader spectrum ranging from 700 nm to 2500 nm in wavelength; NIR therapeutic agents have extensive development possibilities in phototherapy, diagnosis and imaging. MOF composite materials based on NIR excitation and emission are predicted to improve biological imaging and therapeutic precision.252–254 Several design strategies of MOFs have been employed to guide precision therapy, such as NIR-I MOFs, NIR-II MOFs, and two-photon excited MOFs were used to collect more accurate lesion site data. The photophysical properties, imaging, and therapeutic types of MOFs were summarized in Table 3.

4.1 NIR-I MOFs
NIR-I metal agents were widely used in phototherapy and disease diagnosis due to their high tissue penetration depth. The porous structure of MOFs makes it possible to design phototherapy materials by modifying the metals and functional ligands in the structure. In this section, we review the current state of NIR-I MOFs.255,256 One strategy for constructing MOFs in the NIR-I region is to use MOF cavities to coat fluorophores with NIR absorption and emission. By encapsulating organic dyes in a MOF cavity, Hu et al. realized a NIR microscale laser, and dye molecules in the micromolar space limit help to inhibit multiple radiation processes; this strategy allowed for the achievement of higher radiation efficiency and a lower NIR laser threshold (Fig. 18a).257 The MOF single crystal was synthesized using a solvent thermal reaction, and the near-infrared dye was loaded into the single crystal by ion exchange. The resulting diamond dodecahedral dye@MOF microcrystals had a regular morphology and a smooth surface, minimizing unnecessary aggregation-induced quenching (ACQ) and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) processes. By using the polarity of dye molecules to control the ICT process, polar molecules into the MOF cavity further tuned the excitation wavelength. The results demonstrate a new perspective on the non-radiative transition modulation of organic dyes.

NIR cyanine dye and its derivatives are commonly utilized as agents for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and NIR imaging and can convert NIR laser to heat or ROS, but their bioavailability is low. Nanocarrier development has become a major trend in current research to improve the bioavailability, imaging, and tumor-targeting ability of cyanine dyes.258 Yang et al. reported a one-pot approach using a NIR dye and Fe3+ to build multifunctional MOFs.259 The carboxyl group of cypate molecules was used to facilitate the interaction between the dye and Fe3+. This approach enabled multimodal imaging-guided phototherapy for cancer treatment in vivo. The study found that the multifunctional MOFs were highly effective in eliminating the tumor without any noticeable side effects, indicating their efficiency and safety (Fig. 18b). Specifically, cypate molecules were selected as functional organic molecules to form precursor complexes with Fe3+, and then organic junction group 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) was added to form the stable structure of MIL-53. Following that, the surface of cypate@MIL-53 nanoparticles (abbreviated as cetyl-modified nanoparticles (CMNPs)) was modified using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and transferrin, resulting in high biocompatibility and tumor targeting function.
Lanthanide(III) cations (Ln3+) have been extensively studied due to their emission wavelength exceeding 800 nm, narrow emission bands, and resistance to variations in experimental conditions (pH, temperature, and biological environment).260 Therefore, another way to construct NIR MOFs is to use lanthanide metal ions as metal nodes. For example, Petoud et al. reported rare earth metal MOFs with NIR emission, in which Yb3+ was sensitized by fluorescein, referred to as low energy absorption chromophores (FL@CD-MOFs-161), resulting in the formation of Yb3+-based NIR emission MOFs which could be excited with low energy, and exhibited enhanced quantum yield (Fig. 18c).261 During synthesis and crystal growth, fluorescein molecules within the well of FL@CD-MOFs-161 were efficiently loaded and diffused, ensuring efficient loading and diffusion of chromophores within the crystal volume. The FL@CD-MOFs-161 exhibited promising potential for NIR imaging and diagnostic applications, as demonstrated by the acquisition of high-quality images from Yb3+-generated NIR signals.
Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can convert longer wavelength photons to shorter wavelength photons, which can then be reabsorbed by nearby UV/vis response components. Jiang et al. designed and prepared a UCNPs-Pt@MOF/Au composite with wide-band light absorption characteristics from ultraviolet and up-conversion effects; the composite showed considerable photocatalytic H2 under ultraviolet, visible and even NIR radiation activity. This study opens a new avenue for the development of novel high-efficiency composite photocatalysts for H2 photocatalytic activity (Fig. 18d).262 Furthermore, Li et al. rationally designed core–shell super converted nanoparticles@porphyrin MOFs (UCSs) for hypoxic tumors combination therapy using NIR light-induced PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy to address the limitations of current tumor therapy. The development of the rare earth (RE3+) metal clusters RE4(μ3-OH)4(COO)62+ and MOFs with a controllable topology has gained significant attention (Fig. 18e).263 Rosi et al. proposed a series of synthesis methods for porous MOFs based on RE4(μ3-OH)4(COO)62+ clusters and designed a new MOF structure. The MOF platform is highly tunable relative to the RE3+ structure, which can be modified by post-synthetic anion exchange and/or covalent modification. Through post-modification strategies, the excitation wavelength of MOFs was further shifted to lower energy producing NIR-emitting MOFs, suitable for biological imaging applications (Fig. 18f).264
4.2 NIR-II MOFs
Compared with the NIR-I region MOFs, the NIR-II region MOFs exhibit more prominent advantages in imaging and treatment due to their higher sensitivity and deeper tissue penetration. Similar to the strategy for constructing MOFs in the NIR-I region, the main methods for constructing the NIR-II region MOFs include loading NIR-II fluorophores into a cavity larger than that of MOFs, using NIR-II fluorophores containing carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid or nitrogen-containing groups as ligands, and using lanthanide metals as metal nodes. In this section, we will mainly discuss the most recent progress of the above two methodologies in detail.
For example, Tian et al. loaded NIR-II luminescent D–A–D fluorophores into an MOF skeleton and reported a novel diagnostic nanoprobe (CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE) for NIR-II/MR dual-mode imaging-guided PTT and in situ surgical resection of glioblastoma (GBM) (Fig. 19a).265 The photothermal probe (CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE) was made up of iron-based MOF nanoparticles that contained a NIR-II fluorophore (CH4T). The photothermal probe ((CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE) was composed of iron-based MOF nanoparticles loaded with NIR-II fluorophores (CH4T) and could effectively target the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) overexpressed on GBM through a rationally designed and tumor-targeting AE105 peptide modification. This nanoplatform combined the high penetration depth of magnetic resonance imaging with the high-sensitivity detection advantages of NIR-II luminescence imaging for the accurate diagnosis of GBM. In vivo studies demonstrated that CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE could perform PTT and successfully ablate U87MG tumors under the guidance of MR/NIR-II imaging, providing new insights into the development of an effective non-diagnostic platform for GBM diagnostic and therapeutic supplies.

NIR photothermal materials have been widely studied in the fields of PTT, bioimaging, and photoresponsivity drugs, especially NIR-II absorbing photothermal agents (PTAs), which have higher penetrating power, lower energy dissipation, and lower toxicity to normal tissues than NIR-I absorbing photothermal agents.266 Therefore, Qian et al. synthesized for the first time a class of photochromic MOFs (pMOFs) based on the phototransfer-acceptor molecular charge transfer process by combining ligands with good photothermal properties of NIR-II with zinc ions, thereby enhancing the water stability of materials (Fig. 19b).266 Particularly, hydrothermal processes were used to create a photochromic MOF {[Zn4(PTIA)(TPT)2(H2O)2]·(7H2O)} (pMOF) with a pillar-layer 3D architecture (PTIA = piperazine-N,N′-bis(2,4,6-triazinyl-3,5-bis(N,N′-iminodiacetic acid)), TPT = 2,4,6-tri(4-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine. When exposed to UV light, the pMOF displayed photochromic properties, undergoing a significant change in absorption upon irradiation at wavelengths ranging from 500 to 1500 nm. On incorporating pMOF-a material into Pluronic F-127 matrix, water-soluble pMOF-a nanoparticles (pMOF-aNPs) exhibited better PTT tumor resection efficiency in the NIR-II region. This was the first MOF-based NIR-II photothermal conversion investigation that did not require any extra chemical modification.
Furthermore, some lanthanide MOFs exhibit enhanced NIR-II region luminescence and therapeutic benefits. Lanthanide MOFs were crystalline materials self-assembled by trivalent lanthanide metal ions and organic ligands. Combining the excellent luminescence properties of lanthanide metal sites with the inherent high porosity, good structure tunability, surface modification and good biocompatibility of MOF materials, higher luminescence intensity and higher stability, higher quantum yield, longer lifetime and larger Stokes shift were observed. Liu et al. created block crystals and nanospheres from 2,3,3′,5′-biphenyl tetracarboxylic acid and Nd3+ metal nodes, possessing long-wavelength emission (1068 nm) and high quantum yield (8.91%) in the NIR-II region (Fig. 19c).267 The CQ/Nd-MOFs@HA nanohybrid was developed as a pH-controlled releasing platform for the in vivo targeting NIR-II bioimaging agent and the anticancer drug CQ. The CQ/Nd-MOFs@HA nanohybrid demonstrated remarkable capability toward inhibition of cancer cells and tumors while maintaining low biotoxicity toward HL-7702 normal cells. Similarly, Liu et al. presented a NIR-II emissive MOF by integrating the NIR dyes IR-3C and Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er). IR-3C has a high photon absorption ability and transfers energy to Ln3+ through the resonant energy transfer pathway, which greatly enhances the NIR-II emission of Ln3+. The Er-BTC spectra showed good NIR-IIb emission properties (1500–1700 nm) and good biocompatibility in the aqueous phase, paving the way for further development of in vivo bioimaging performance. (Fig. 19d).268 Yan et al. constructed an Er3+ doped NaLnF4@MOF core@shell nanoparticle for NIR-triggered PDT and NIR-II luminescence imaging.256
4.3 Two-photon excited MOFs
Two-photon responsive agents have been widely used in biomedicine because of their advantages such as superior tissue penetration depth, high spatial resolution, and low sample damage. However, the limited absorption cross-section and required emission properties have hindered the development of agents for use in biological imaging and therapy. MOFs are a new porous material made up of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands that can inherently combine the characteristics of inorganic and organic units to improve and optimize the photon properties.269 Based on the above considerations, Zhang et al. reported the first. two-photon MOF (TP-MOF) sensing platform for bioimaging (Fig. 20a).270 The first design used PCN-58 as a model building module, and was connected with zirconium and organic connecters to ensure a large enough cavity for loading fluorophores. The TP-MOF was covalently cross-linked with the TP organic fluorescent probe by copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloadditions (CuAAC), which could effectively avoid cross-reaction with other functional groups of the organic probe. The probe detected H2S and Zn2+ and demonstrated excellent sensing and imaging performance in complex biological systems. To enhance the therapeutic effect of two-photon MOFs on hypoxic tumors, a porphyrin MOF nanoplatform involving the Fenton/Fenton-like reaction was constructed by Li et al. The synthetic Pd@MOF-525@HA effectively enhanced the oxygen-dependent antitumor treatment effect (Fig. 20b).271 The resulting Pd@MOF-525@HA used a porphyrin MOF, named MOF-525 (Zr6(OH)4O4(TCPP-H2)3) as the target carrier. The porphyrin portion of the framework acted not only as a PDT and SDT agent but also as a reactive part of NIR-induced two-photon PDT due to a larger π-bond system and rigid planar structure. Besides, highly dispersed Pd nanocubes can be easily encapsulated, catalyzed and reacted with H2O2 overexpressed in cancer cells to furnish, highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and O2−˙ though a Fenton-like reaction. This triggers cell apoptosis and greatly alleviates tumor hypoxia. The study demonstrated that the nanoplatform Pd@MOF-525@HA, which responds to two-photon stimulation, can penetrate deeper into tissue, produce a significant amount of 1O2 when exposed to light or ultrasound, and target cancer cells specifically. These findings suggest that the nanoplatform had the potential for precision anti-cancer therapy.

Similarly, Li et al. synthesized ZnL1@MOF-199@FA, in which MOF-199 was selected as a nanocarrier to facilitate the loading of two-photon photosensitizer ZnL1 and realized NIR-induced PDT (Fig. 20c).272 To improve PDT with deeper tissue penetration, the prepared-199@FA nanoplatform with a two-photon response was employed to minimize the hypoxic environment caused by a Fenton-like reaction. Moreover, by enhancing the polypyridine Ru complexes to produce 1O2, it may be possible to realize a better two-photon treatment. Yue et al. presented a novel strategy for obtaining a 2PA absorption 1O2 generation system by incorporating cationic Ru complexes into an anionic MOF through an ion-exchange process (Fig. 20d).273 The bio-MOF-1&RCs effectively enhanced the luminescence emission by preventing the aggregation of the RCs. Additionally, bio-MOF-1&RCs showed a significant ability to produce 1O2 under both single photon and duplex excitation, indicating the potential for future integrated PDT chemotherapy synergy in cancer treatment.
NMOFs had received much attention as a potential drug carrier for chemotherapy and PDT because of their high porosity of customizable pore size, and structural regularity. During PDT, luminescent NMOFs were not only used as an imaging agent and an effective drug-loading system through encapsulation or adsorption but they also facilitated the separation of photosensitizers into the nanopore to prevent self-aggregation quenching.274 Despite the unique luminescence properties of Ln-MOFs, they were seldom utilized in the PDT field. However, they can be employed in two-photon-absorption PDT (TPA-PDT), which allows for deep tissue penetration by simultaneously stimulating two low-energy NIR photons. Few studies on NIR-triggered TPA-PDTA using NMOFs as a drug carrier to reduce global photodamage have been conducted. Tang et al. designed and assembled an NMOF probe based on Eu, abbreviated as MB@THA-NMOF-76@cRGD via the post-synthetic modification (PSM) of NMOF-76, for realizing high-efficiency TPA-PDT under 808 nm laser irradiation (Fig. 20e).275 The appropriate NMOF particle size can isolate PSs (MB) within the microporous structure and prevent excited state auto-disappearance due to aggregation. Meanwhile, NMOF micropores loaded a large amount of MB, which improved the killing effect on cancer cells. This design ensured the high efficiency of the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) process between the Eu-MOF and the receptor MB molecule, resulting in a highly efficient NIR-triggered and targeted PDT. Furthermore, Li et al. synthesized a functional MOF material (PCN-58-Ps-HA), using the click reaction and coordination effect (Fig. 20f).276 They employed a two-photon active photosensitizer with a D–π–A configuration to construct PN-58-Ps via an azide-alkyne “click” reaction, which allowed for a covalent connection between various functional groups and effectively prevented aggregation. PCN-58-Ps were combined with hyaluronic acid (HA) to achieve cancer cell-specific targeting. The resulting PCN-58-Ps exhibited significant two-photon activity and excellent light-triggered ROS generation capabilities when exposed to 910 nm laser excitation. These properties make them ideal for use in NIR light-stimulated PDT for deep-tissue cancer imaging and therapy, with promising potential for future clinical applications.
5. Biomedical applications
NIR phototherapy agents are useful in optical imaging, biosensing and optical therapy.277,278 Most NIR phototherapy agents, on the other hand, have obvious limitations such as poor optical stability, small Stokes shift, and limited detection sensitivity. NIR metal agents have become one of the main research focuses in the field of bioimaging and therapy in recent years due to their advantages of high tissue penetration depth, high photostability, large Stokes shift, adjustable chemical structure, long luminescent lifetime, high membrane permeability, controlled cell uptake behavior, intracellular localization and cytotoxicity.279,280 In this section, we will mainly discuss the above-mentioned advancement of NIR metal agents (MMCs, MOCs and MOFs) in biological imaging and therapy.
5.1 Bioimaging

5.1.1. 
            In vitro imaging. 
NIR metal agents have been frequently used in cell imaging due to their advantages in photostability, luminous lifetime and cell uptake sensitivity.281,282 In addition, based on the advantages of NIR luminescence, many NIR metal agents have been devised to facilitate cell imaging in order to expose many biological processes.283 Peng et al. reported a novel Ru–I complex containing cyanine fluorophores.147 Ru-1 is positively charged, easily soluble in water, can be quickly absorbed by cancer cells, and emits green light. The intracellular green luminescence was enhanced gradually with time, reaching the maximum at 40 min. The intracellular luminescence intensity remained constant even after incubation for 4 hours, indicating that Ru–I was not readily excreted from the cell. In addition, the green luminescence signal generated by Ru–I in MCF-7 coincided well with the red luminescence signal of the lysosome, with a correlation coefficient of 0.943. This indicates that Ru–I was selectively localized to lysosomes (Fig. 21a). In addition, two-photon biological imaging also exhibited satisfactory results in cell imaging. Tripier et al. thoroughly examined the pyclen-based bioprobe family, including [EuL4a], [SmL4a], [YbL4b], [TbL4c], and [DyL4c]. They synthesized the derivative L4a′ and its [EuL4a′] complex to explore the impact of asymmetric arrangement on photophysical properties and bioimaging (Fig. 21b).284 Two-photon cell imaging studies have shown that the complex visibly stains human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, two-photon microscopy imaging on small living zebrafish models was conducted in vivo for the first time. Among them, [EuL4a] was capable of achieving high-quality 3D images of the 2P-luminescent lanthanide bioprobe (2P-LLB) from the single-cell state to the end of the experiment. The biological imaging experimental results obtained using Dy(III) llb are extremely rare in the literature. To achieve labeling of biomolecules in the NIR region and multi-color imaging, Zhang et al. synthesized a series of clickable NIR fluorescent Ln complexes.175 These azides or acetylene-functionalized Ln complexes have excellent luminescence properties and hydrophilicity and exhibit enhanced NIR luminescence when reacted with biomolecules. These clickable Ln complexes successfully achieve NIR fluorescent labeling for intracellular DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans (Fig. 21c). The combination of clickable Yb3+ complex with classical immunoluminescence staining successfully achieved intracellular multicolor luminescence imaging (Fig. 21d). Importantly, the researchers achieved dual-mode imaging for the first time by combining high-resolution NIR luminescence imaging with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) (Fig. 21e).

MOCs have better cell uptake compared to MMCs, which is very beneficial for obtaining high-quality cell imaging images. Stang et al. reported a Ru–Pt metallacycle with two-photon properties.243 The metallacycle showed strong red shifted luminescence in the NIR region. Studies conducted on cells had demonstrated that the metallacycle can efficiently enter cells and emit a strong red luminescence when subjected to single-photon excitation. Furthermore, colocalization experiments revealed that the red luminescent signal generated by the metallacycle exhibits a high degree of overlap with the luminous signal of MTDR, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80. In contrast, the overlap with Hoechst was found to be less, with a correlation coefficient of 0.33, indicating that the metallacycle had a selective affinity for accumulation in mitochondria and nuclei. (Fig. 22a). Analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) revealed that the metallacycle had higher cellular uptake compared to small molecules. In addition, the authors demonstrated that the metallacycle had a good chemical stability within the cell. Our group also reported a Ru(II) metallacycle Ru1085 with NIR-II luminescence.64 After co-incubating 78 with A549 cells, the red luminescence signal of the cells was gradually enhanced with the extension of incubation time (3–24 h) (Fig. 22b). The luminescence signal of 78 was stronger than that of the ligand, indicating that 78 had good absorption and retention efficiency. 78 was mainly located in the lysosome with a correlation coefficient of 0.71. Furthermore, cellular uptake of the Ru element was further determined at a single-cell level by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). MOFs showed great promise in cell imaging as well. Petoud et al. introduced a new compound called nano-Yb-PVDC-3, which contains a high density of sensitized Yb3+ lanthanide cations and phenylenes to enable NIR imaging of living cells. The compound showed excellent stability in specific biological media, and demonstrated photostability, making it suitable for imaging living cells. Upon uptake by cells, nano-Yb-PVDC-3 localized in the cytoplasm and was rapidly taken up, allowing it to be utilized for imaging living HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells. (Fig. 22c).

5.1.2. 
            In vivo imaging. 
NIR luminescence imaging technology offers significant advantages for in vivo imaging, due to its significantly reduced photon scattering and self-fluorescence phenomenon, thus increasing the penetration depth of tissues.286 The successful development of NIR metal agents has substantially enriched the agent library available for NIR luminescence imaging technology imaging and promoted the development of this field, especially the development of longer wavelength NIR-II metal reagents.287 Performing multiple bioimaging on a living organism is extremely challenging. Zhang et al. reported erbium(III)–bacteriochlorin complex EB766 with NIR-II emission for multiple bioimaging.176 Single channel detection was achieved by combining EB766 with NaYF4:20%Yb, 2% Er@NaYF4 down-conversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). Two false colors were observed from the same emission at about 1530 nm when excited with 760 and 980 nm lasers. This protocol provided the benefit of obtaining high-resolution information on the differentiation of mouse lymph nodes and vascular necks, due to minimal scattering and tissue background (Fig. 23a). The combination of commercial cyanine dyes Cy7.5 and EB766 can produce two-color luminescence signals in the range of 1000–1400 nm and 1400–1600 nm, when excited at 760 nm. This protocol was successful in achieving dynamic imaging of multi-organ metabolism. For example, intravenous administration of Cy7.5 phospholipid micelles labeled with a caudal marker allowed for clear distinction of liver and spleen organs. Similarly, oral administration of EB766 phospholipid micelles enabled clear visualization of the peristaltic gastrointestinal system (Fig. 23b).

To perform NIR-II imaging of MOCs at the in vivo level, our research group loaded Pt(II) metallacycle and NIR-II fluorescent dye on multifunctional melanin dots for accurate dual-mode imaging.221In vivo NIR-II luminescence and PA imaging showed that the tumor and background tissue could be identified (Fig. 23c), and tumor uptake of the probe reached the maximum at 6 h. The tumor and other major organs or tissues were imaged in ex vivo 24 h after injection. One hour after probe injection, the luminescence signal of the tumor was significantly higher than that of other organs, which was consistent with in vivo imaging results. Chen et al. also reported a porphyrin metallacage. The successful combination of luminescence imaging (Fig. 23d), PET imaging and MRI imaging by chelating metal ions (64Cu) or paramagnetic Mn in porphyrin centers enabled precise tumor diagnosis and real-time monitoring of metallacage delivery, biological distribution and excretion.223 The development of NIR-II-emitting MOFs was of great significance for biomedical research. Due to the low efficiency of MOF NIR-II emission, it is difficult to achieve in vivo NIR-II imaging. Liu et al. used NIR dyes IR-3C and Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) together to prepare MOFs (ER-BTC-IR) with strong NIR-II luminescence.267 Er-BTC-IR possessed good in vivo biological imaging performance. The Er-BTC-IR was administrated through the tail vein into the mouse, and the blood vessels as well as the spine and lymph of the mouse were visible after a few seconds (Fig. 23e). The luminescence intensity of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated right hindlimb was significantly higher than that of the saline-treated left hindlimb, indicating increased blood flow during acute vascular inflammation.

5.2 Phototherapy
Phototherapy involves combining phototherapy agents with the light source irradiation in the lesion area, to stimulate the phototherapy agents to kill tumor cells.288,289 In comparison to traditional treatment, phototherapy offers advantages such as certain tissue penetration depth, specificity characteristics, and toxic side effects of the irradiation site. Through the specific stimulation of phototherapy agents, it not only can track drugs by luminescence imaging, and erradicate lesions, but it may also reduce the pain of surgical treatment in patients.290–292 In this section, we will mainly discuss PDT and PTT based on NIR metal agents for cancer treatment.

5.2.1 Photothermal therapy. 
NIR photothermal agents have been widely used in the fields of photothermal therapy, bioimaging, and photo-responsive pharmaceuticals due to their benefits of deep penetration, low energy consumption, and low normal tissue toxicity.293–295 So far, several NIR absorption agents have been developed using inorganic nanomaterials, conjugated polymer nanoparticles, and organic small molecules.294 Nonetheless, there still exist long-term safety issues and difficult preparation processes with these NIR absorption photothermal agents.296 NIR metal agents are of great help in improving PTT. As a result, we will focus on the most current biological applications of NIR metal agents in photothermal therapy.
To solve the problem of cisplatin resistance, Xiao et al. combined a Ru(II) polypyridine complex with D–A–D type NIR-II fluorophores and reported a novel NIR-II small molecule metal photothermic agent HLPEG2k in 2022.179 The temperature of HL-PEG2k rapidly reaches 62.5 °C within 300 s, and its PCE is 41.77%, indicating good photothermal stability. In vivo studies showed that the temperature at the HL-PEG2K tumor increased from 29.2 to 57.4 °C within 5 minutes upon irradiation (Fig. 24a). The photothermal treatment can destroy the lysosomal membrane, aggravating mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in cell cycle stagnation in the G2 phase, and eventually leading to cell apoptosis. In addition, HL-PEG2k demonstrated good biocompatibility and was therefore an effective small-molecule metal agent for tumor treatment. The development of absorption wavelength is beneficial for metal photothermal agents in the NIR-II region, especially with a 1064 nm laser, which can significantly reduce the laser dose, provide higher safety, and reduce side effects.296 Huang et al. synthesized a series of dithiophene nickel(II) complexes that had ligand-dependent NIR absorption properties. NiBD-Cz was coated with an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer (F-127), and iBD-Cz/F-127 water-soluble nanoparticles (NiBD-Cz NPs) were formed through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in redshifting of the absorption peak to 1036 nm. During laser irradiation, the temperature of NiBD-Cz NPs can be increased from 30.8 °C to 78.1 °C. NiBD-Cz NPs showed good dispersion and photostability under 1064 nm laser irradiation, with a PCE of 63.6% (Fig. 24b). High PCE enabled better photothermal treatment at low concentration and under low power laser irradiation.297

Compared with MMC photothermal agents, MOCs showed greater potential for photothermal therapy due to their ability to integrate multiple photothermal agents in the same large metallacycle or metallacage through coordination self-assembly, showing potential to greatly improve the efficacy of photothermal therapy. Yin et al. reported a rhomboidal photothermal metallacycle with an emission wavelength greater than 800 nm.298 To improve biocompatibility, the metallacycle was encapsulated with Pluronic F127 to generate F127/M nanoparticles with high hydrophilicity. As the power density increased, the temperature with F127/M could reach 63.9 °C (Fig. 24c). The F127/M NPs had a PCE of 36%, and good photothermal stability. F127/M NPs had demonstrated remarkable cellular uptake and photothermal therapeutic efficacy in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that F127/M NPs can effectively inhibit tumor growth with few side effects. Furthermore, F127/M NPs may be tracked by NIR luminescence imaging, which can improve the therapeutic precision of photothermal therapy. Similarly, MOFs had great potential for application in photothermal therapy. Zhou et al. successfully prepared a series of new NIR MOF photothermal agents by heating Cu-BTC MOF precursors in the range of 400–900 °C under the condition of argon protection (Fig. 24d).299 The size and carbon defect concentration of the copper nanoparticles in these photothermal agents (Cu@CPP-t) increased with increasing synthesis temperature, resulting in Cu@CPP-t displaying remarkable NIR absorption and photothermal heating response. Among them, Cu@CPP-800 exhibited 48.5% PCE under 808 nm laser irradiation, the highest so far among carbon-based photothermal agents. Cu@CPP-800 had shown potential as a photothermal MOF agent for in vivo NIR activation. Qian et al. demonstrated that pMOFs based on the photo-induced D–A intermolecular charge transfer process may be a promising class of NIR-II photothermal agents. After further surface modification, these UV-induced pMOF-α nanoparticles could effectively inhibit 4T1 tumor cells when exposed to 1064 nm laser radiation.266


5.2.2 Photodynamic therapy. 
In the past, PDT has received increasing attention in cancer treatment.300,301 The use of conventional photosensitizers was generally limited by their low solubility in water, their tendency to aggregate, their tendency to photodegrade and their slow clearance in vivo. Recent metal-agent-based studies tend to use blue light to realize PDT effects, but the poor penetration depth into the tissue limits the possibility of treating large tumors.302 Hence, the development of NIR metal photodynamic agents plays an important role in improving the therapeutic effect of cancer. Gasser et al. (Fig. 25a) developed a Ru(II) polypyridine complex using density functional theory (DFT) that had quite high phototoxicity under laser irradiation in both monolayer cells and 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS).104 Under laser irradiation, the compound was found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells and disturbed the mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis processes. In recent years, two-photon PDT (TP-PDT) metal agents have received much attention due to their low-energy NIR laser excitation, reduced damage to normal cells, photobleaching of photosensitizers, and deeper tissue penetration.303 However, at present, the low water solubility, poor photostability, and limited selectivity of metal photodynamic agents against cancer cells limit their wide application in TP-PDT. To understand these problems, Chao et al. prepared three highly positively charged Ru(II) polypyridine complexes.203 These complexes can be captured by lysosomes through endocytosis. Compared to the clinically approved PDT agent 5-aminolevulpionic acid (5-ALA), Ru1 was highly cytotoxic to HeLa cells under light, with an IC50 value of 1.5 μm (PI = 313). Under light irradiation, Ru1 pretreated cells contracted and formed a large number of vesicles. Meanwhile, large amounts of 1O2 are produced in the cells. In addition, the cellular localization of Ru1 was transferred from the lysosome to the cytoplasm and finally to the nucleus and nucleoli (Fig. 25b). 3D HeLa MCTSs treated with Ru1 demonstrated exceptional cytotoxicity under 800 nm laser irradiation.

The effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is often hindered by various factors such as elevated levels of glutathione, inadequate targeting of tumors, insufficient delivery of drugs, and ineffective activation of cell death pathways specific to cancer cells. To address this problem, the researchers reported a biodegradable Ir(III) coordination polymer (IrS NPs). IrS NPs consume glutathione and are broken down into monomer Ir(III) complexes in a tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect (Fig. 25c).304 Also, IrS NPs can be selectively localized in mitochondria, and produce 1O2, and O2−˙ as well as lipid peroxides under irradiation. Coated with amphiphilic biotin-functionalized polymers, IrSNPs@biotin accumulated significantly at tumor sites of tumor-bearing mice and almost completely eradicated tumors in a single treatment, thereby providing a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. In addition to the above-cited issues, PDT was also limited by the low oxygen concentration in the tumor. Chao et al., therefore, reported a novel mitochondria-targeted Ir(III) endoperoxide prodrug (2-O-IrAn) (Fig. 25d).205 2-O-IrAn can simultaneously release highly cytotoxic Ir(III) complexes (2-IrAn), 1O2, and alkoxy radicals. Since the mode of activation of 2-O-IrAn is not oxygen-dependent, it was found to have high toxicity under normoxic (IC50 < 51.53 nM) as well as hypoxic conditions ((IC50 = 60 nM) in A549 tumor cells and MCTSs in the nanomolar range. The mechanistic studies revealed that the complex was specifically accumulated into mitochondria resulting in membrane potential loss and apoptosis. To further improve tumor selectivity, 2-O-IrAn was encapsulated in a biotin-functionalized polymer. The current study demonstrated that the nanoparticle almost completely eradicated tumors in mice within a single light treatment. Therefore, the current approach utilized a combination of PDT and chem-photodynamic therapy to overcome the hypoxia-mediated hurdles in cancer photodynamic therapy.
Compared with photodynamic agents MMCs, MOCs are more photodynamically efficient because their inherent shape effectively prevents the accumulation of photosensitizers and increases the intersystem crossing of photosensitizers due to heavy atom effects.305 For example, our group proposed a π-expansion strategy for the Ru(II) acceptor and developed a series of Ru(II) metallacycles (Ru1-Ru4) with NIR-II emission (Fig. 26a).238 This strategy can simultaneously reduce dark toxicity and enhance phototoxicity, to obtain a higher PI value. These metallacycles enabled fluorescence tissue penetration and ROS penetration up to 7 mm. Moreover, these metallacycles exhibited excellent anticancer cell activity under hypoxic conditions. Importantly, Ru4 had the lowest dark toxicity, the highest ROS generation and the best PI value (∼146). In vivo studies had shown that Ru4 can be an effective and safe PDT agent for A549 tumors. In addition, Chao et al. reported a metallacage that can be excited with two-photons (Fig. 26b). The metallacage had NIR luminescence properties, a large 2PA cross-section, and efficient ROS generation capability.213 Metallacage coated with amphiphilic block copolymers can be selectively localized in lysosomes, which is advantageous for photodynamic therapy. The resulting 5-NPs exhibited a lower IC50 (4.83 μM) at very low concentrations. When the laser dose was increased to 12 J cm−2, the IC50 value decreased to 1.89 μM (PI > 63.5). Two-photon excitation of 5-NPs offered greater penetration depth in the 3D A549 spheroid model compared to single-photon excitation (Fig. 26c). Finally, tumor inhibition studies in 3D multicellular spheres (MCS) and A549 tumor-bearing mice showed that 5-NPs exhibited excellent efficacy in two-photon PDT.

MOFs have great potential in photodynamic therapy, especially porphyrin-based photosensitizer MOFs. Porphyrin-based photosensitizers can handle a high load and prevent their aggregation, due to their self-quenching properties. Lin et al. reported the first example of chlorine nanoscale MOF (NMOF) DBC-UiO for photodynamic therapy (Fig. 26d).250 Compared with the previously reported porphyrin-based NMOF DBP-UiO, DBC-UiO produced 1O2 more efficiently and significantly enhanced PDT in two mouse models of colon cancer. In addition, immunogenic cell death pathways were also induced in DBC-UiO. By combining MOFs and upconversion photochemistry to grow porphyrin MOFs on prepared Nd3+ upconversion nanoparticles, Zhao et al. synthesized a mitochondria-specific, NIR light-activated PDT system with an organelle-targeting strategy (Fig. 26e).305 The effectiveness of PDT was increased by targeting mitochondria, which was achieved by depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane and initiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This article not only introduces the first NIR light-activatable MOF for organelle-targeting PDT, but also discusses hybrid MOF designs to overcome the current limitations of PDT.

5.3 Synergistic therapy
More and more studies have shown that it is difficult to achieve an excellent therapeutic effect with single therapy.306 To enhance the anti-cancer impact, two or more therapy modalities must be used concurrently and the benefits of each therapy modality must be combined to generate a therapeutic effect of 1 + 1 > 2.307 In particular, the use of combination therapy in the NIR region can be effective in promoting the anti-tumor therapeutic effect of solid tumors.308 Metal agents have great advantages in combination therapy. Some metal agents have various other properties in addition to their chemotherapy action, such as photokinetic properties, photothermal properties, and chemical kinetics. These features provide the optimum formula for combination treatment.309
Zhang et al. (2020) developed a series of porphodilactol derivatives and their corresponding metal complexes for regulating the balance between inter-systemic cross-over (ISC) and PCE.310 This balance was achieved mainly by modulating the aromaticity of the porphyrin derivatives and the two lanthanide cations (Lu3+ or Gd3+) (Fig. 27a). Studies had shown that Gd-trans-2 exhibited the best ISC efficiency, PCE (∼30%), and luminescence intensity. Moreover, the free β-hydroxyl group facilitates the production of type I ROS. ItsO2−˙ production was increased by ∼7-fold (3.1%) compared to that of free base trans-2. Eventually, Gd-trans-2 was encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) for tumor diagnosis and treatment. The results showed that MSN-Gd-trans-2 exhibited excellent PTT/PDT therapeutic effects on 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Sun et al. (2021) reported a neutral Ir(III) complex incorporating a BODIPY fluorophore (BODIPY-Ir) (Fig. 27b).151 It was effective in producing ROS and photothermal effects in response to NIR light irradiation. The micellization of BODIPY-Ir then formed “micelle-Ir” for enhanced tumor inhibition in vivo. Micelle-Ir enters cells via clathrin-mediated energy-dependent endocytosis and localizes in lysosomes. Micelle-Ir exhibits minimal dark cytotoxicity but causes high phototoxicity (IC50 = 2.01 μM) by synergistic PDT/PTT upon light activation. Under light irradiation, Micelle-Ir was able to completely inhibit the growth of in situ 4T1 breast tumors and suppress metastatic nodules in the lungs through synergistic PDT/PTT treatment.

Similarly, Gao et al. reported an Ir(III) complex (IrDAD) with a D–A–D fluorophore skeleton for synergistic PDT and PTT therapy (Fig. 27c).178 In the aggregated form, IrDAD possessed very low radiative transition, thus maximizing the conversion of light energy into the energy required for PDT and PTT therapy. IrDAD was combined with PEG to form biocompatible nanoparticles (IrDAD-NPs). Upon NIR irradiation, the IC50 value of IrDAD-NPs against A549 cancer cells was 7.1 μM (14.4 μM for IrDAD). This combined therapeutic agent with low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity demonstrated promising application potential. In vivo studies showed that IrDAD nanoparticles preferentially aggregated in tumors, reduced tumor volume by 96%, and had a significant inhibitory effect and even eliminated tumors. Moreover, the researchers reported a NIR supramolecular photosensitizer (RuDA) that demonstrated a similar antitumor effect as the IrDAD complex by replacing the acceptor portion of IrDAD with Ru(II)-arene (Fig. 27d).177 This also demonstrates the prospect of Ru(II) complexes as candidate materials for simultaneous NIR-activated PDT/PTT treatment.
Furthermore, unlike MMCs, MOCs can integrate many therapeutic modalities by simple coordination self-assembly. Zhao et al. (2021) reported a series of metallacycles (M1–M3) with high stability and NIR absorption through the Pt–acetylide coordination for synergistic PDT/PTT (Fig. 28a).234 The introduction of platinum atoms into the metallacycle promoted 1O2 production and PCE. The metallacycles had a strong NIR absorption, facilitating a deeper tissue penetration and an effective treatment action. To further improve biocompatibility, metallacycles were encapsulated into NPs using DSPE-mPEG5000. M-NPs were treated at a concentration of 10 μM to achieve a cell survival rate of over 84%, indicating negligible dark toxicity of the cells. Importantly, as the strength of the laser irradiation increased, cell viability decreased significantly. M-NPs promoted cell death in the late stage of cell apoptosis via a synergistic PDT/PTT mechanism. Among them, M3-NPs exhibited excellent anti-cancer properties and could ablate tumors without recurrence.

PDT is successful for local tumor ablation; however, it is ineffective for eradicating distant tumors and infiltrating cancer cells, which can easily lead to tumor recurrence. In contrast, the combination of PDT with chemotherapy has proved extremely good outcomes in cancer treatment, most likely due to chemotherapy medications' capacity to disseminate to more distant cancer cells after primary tumor ablation, limiting tumor recurrence and lowering the administered doses. To combine chemotherapy and PDT, Chen et al. developed a Pt(II) metallacage using 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TPP), cis(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2 (cPt) and disodium terephthalate (DSTP) as building blocks (Fig. 28b).223 The formation of metallacages effectively suppressed intermolecular π–π stacking of TPPs, thereby enhancing luminescence and 1O2 quantum yields, and facilitating NIR luminescence imaging and PDT. MNPs formed by mPEG-b-PEBP and RGD-PEG-b-PEBP wrapped around the metallacage, allowed for longer blood circulation and enhanced aggregation at tumor locations. This is critical for improving anti-cancer activity and lowering side effects on normal tissues. In addition, the diagnostic agent 64Cu@MNPs (or Mn@MNPs) possesses tri-modal imaging capabilities through chelated 64Cu or Mn ions, allowing accurate tumor diagnosis and real-time monitoring of MNP delivery, biodistribution, and excretion. MNPs demonstrated remarkable anti-metastatic and anti-tumor properties in various models, including U87MG, drug-resistant A2780cis, and in situ tumors. Furthermore, a single dosage of MNPs resulted in tumor ablation and prevented recurrence. Gene microarray analysis further supported the effectiveness of different treatment methods in achieving tumor resection.
In addition to the above platinum-based building blocks that can be used as chemotherapeutic agents, they are also believed to be good radiosensitizers due to their improved photoelectric effects and Compton scattering. It significantly enhances the anticancer effect of radio-chemotherapy on drug-resistant cells by enhancing the DNA damage caused by radiation-generated ROS and inhibiting the DNA repair induced by chemotherapy. Hence, in 2022, Mao et al. reported the synthesis of a NIR discrete metallacycle with radio-chemotherapeutic properties using a perylene bisimidefluorophore (PPy) and a tetraphenylethylene-based di-Pt(II)acceptor (TPE-Pt) as building blocks (Fig. 28c).217 To improve solubility and stability in the organism, the metallacycle was encapsulated with an amphiphilic diblock copolymer with glutathione (GSH) responsiveness, allowing for intracellular release and enhanced anticancer effects. TPE-Pt served as both a chemotherapeutic agent and a radiosensitizer, which can improve treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The PPy fluorescent dye acted as a FRET receptor and can be used for luminescence imaging to monitor the biodistribution of metallacycle. The results of the study showed that combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy could effectively inhibit tumor growth and significantly prolong the survival of cisplatin-resistant A2780cis tumor-bearing mice with negligible side effects. Moreover, tri-modal combination therapy of metallacycles had been successfully applied in anti-tumor applications.
In 2022, Zhang et al. prepared a dispersive Pt(II) metallacycle (SCY) containing NIR heptamethine cyanine (Fig. 28d).230 To improve solubility and stability, SCY was wrapped in DSPE-mPEG to form nanoparticles (P@SCY). As P@SCY was taken up by cancer cells, the platinum acceptor segment can migrate to the nucleus and bind to DNA, leading to chemotoxicity. The positively charged cyanine moiety can target mitochondria and generate ROS and thermal heat, thereby enhancing the phototherapeutic effect. P@SCY exhibited significant tri-modal combination therapeutic effects on HepG2 cells, MCF-7 cells and 4T1 cells. P@SCY was effective in eliminating tumor tissue from the 4T1 tumor model with minimal toxic side effects. In addition, the combination of immunotherapy and other therapeutic modalities can further enhance the therapeutic effect. Li et al. reported a core–shell upconversion nanoparticle@porphyrinic MOFs (UCSs) consisting of a single UCNP as the core and porphyrin MOFs as the shell for NIR light-excited combinational photodynamic/chemo-/immunotherapy.263 The UCNP core transfers the energy generated under NIR light excitation to the porphyrins in the MOF shell, facilitating the efficient production of 1O2. Taking advantage of the porous structure of MOFs, a hypoxia-activated prodrug (terapamide, TPZ) was loaded into the UCSs-MOF shell, enabling the combination of PDT and chemotherapy to effectively improve anticancer therapy. Furthermore, chemotherapy and PDT combined with α-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade not only eliminate the primary tumor but also harness the systemically generated immune response to suppress further tumor growth.
5.4 Imaging-guided therapy
It is of great significance to realize early detection and precise treatment of cancer.311,312 Imaging-guided therapy can achieve high precision and efficiency in the integration of imaging and therapy, lowering side effects.313 As compared to visible light, NIR luminescence imaging can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity.314 Therefore, diagnostic agents with NIR imaging and therapeutic functions are the key link in realizing image-guided therapy. Compared with other diagnostic agents, NIR metal agents have outstanding advantages in imaging-guided therapy systems because it is easy to realize multi-functions including imaging, chemotherapy, and phototherapy characteristics at the same time through structural regulation. In 2019, our research group encapsulated Pt(II) metallacycles and fluorescent molecules in DSPE-mPEG5000 (1,2 bisstearyl Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate ethanolamine-N [methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-5000]) to synthesize an NIR luminescence image-guided chemotherapy agent (Fig. 29a).219 The prepared agent possessed excellent photostability and passive targeting ability. The agent accurately identified the lesion site of cancer and selectively delivered the chemotherapy drug Pt(II) metallacycle to the tumor site by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. In vivo studies had shown that it can effectively inhibit tumor growth with minimal side effects.

Ruthenium drugs are becoming potential substitutes for platinum drugs due to the resistance of platinum drugs. Moreover, imaging agents and chemotherapy drugs have been wrapped in amphiphilic materials, resulting in dose mismatch and difficulty to achieve accurate diagnosis and treatment. To address this issue, our research group synthesized a Ru(II) metallacycle Ru1100 with an emission wavelength greater than 1000 nm by employing the NIR-II fluorophore as metallacycle's ligand (Fig. 29b).224 Ru1100 penetrated deep in tissues up to 7 mm with excellent chemotherapy, photodynamic and photothermal properties. In vitro studie revealed that Ru1100 can overcome cisplatin resistance and has good anticancer activity against several cancer cell lines. Anticancer mechanism investigation revealed that Ru1100 triggered apoptosis of cancer cells by blocking cell G2/M and damaging lysosomes. In vivo studies had shown that Ru1100 coated with DSPE-PEG5000 achieves NIR-II luminescence image-guided chemo-phototherapy without significant side effects. In addition, our group also used a similar Ru(II) metallacycle in the NIR-II region for the diagnosis and treatment of pathogens (Fig. 29c).240 The metallacycle worked well against many bacteria and was less toxic to normal cells. Importantly, the complex successfully achieved precise NIR-II luminescence image-guided photo-triggered therapy for Staphylococcus aureus infection in a mouse model.
Nevertheless, because the majority of metallacycles experience luminescence quenching in the state of aggregation, precise tumor identification is challenging. Wang et al. reported a NIR-II metallacage with AIE characteristics to address this issue (Fig. 29d).62 The metallacage inherited the good photothermal properties of the ligands. In addition, the ROS-generating capacity of the metallacage was much stronger than that of ligands themselves due to the enhanced intersystem cross-over and cage structure. In vivo studies had shown that biocompatible metallacages made from amphiphilic material can simultaneously result in accurate diagnosis and ablation of tumors through NIR-II luminescence/photothermal imaging guided bimodal therapy (PTT/PDT).
Due to the large cavity structure of MOFs, it is possible to pack more imaging and therapeutic agents into the cavity, which provides a convenient way for the development of clinical integration of MOF agents. Wang et al. developed a MOF-based PTT-GT platform (siRNA@PT-ZIF-8) by combining siRNA, an NIR IR780 derivative (IR780-1), and 2-methylimidazole by a one-pot method (Fig. 29e).315 SiRNA@PT-ZIF-8 integrated photothermal, PA and FL imaging to achieve spatiotemporal control on PTT/GT. This design overcame some of the drawbacks of free genes or PTA by realizing selective tumor microenvironment responsiveness as well as the demand-based release of therapeutic agents. This nanoplatform provided a new vision for cancer treatment.
Although NIR metal agents have made great achievements in optical imaging biosensing, and optical therapy, their potential applications in new directions of biomedicine are still worthy of further exploration. We believe that in the future, metal agents can be developed from the following aspects. First, metal agents are employed for NIR-II lifetime imaging in vivo. This technique allows for quantitative measurement of the biomolecular microenvironment, as the results are not influenced by luminescent molecule concentration, light scattering, or light intensity absorption. Furthermore, this approach overcomes the issue of endogenous fluorescence background signals, leading to a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo imaging.316,317 Although luminescence lifetime imaging using various metal agents has been extensively studied at the cellular level, there is a lack of research on in vivo imaging of NIR-II luminescence lifetimes. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to fully understand the potential of NIR-II luminescence lifetime imaging for in vivo applications. Second, NIR metal agents are utilized in the study of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which has shown great potential in both preclinical and clinical settings due to its ability to penetrate deeply and effectively ablate deep tumors.87 Although several metal agents, including ruthenium,318 iridium,319 and rhenium complexes,320,321 have been reported for SDT, the number of metal agents used for SDT remains relatively low compared to those used for photodynamic therapy. In addition, the structure–activity relationship of sonosensitizers is still unclear. Research has indicated that in addition to imaging and phototherapeutic properties, some metal agents can not only have imaging and phototherapeutic properties, but can also catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen or hydroxyl radicals,322 which can be very effective in improving the SDT effect. The structure of the metal agent is easy to modify, which is beneficial to study the structure–activity relationship of the sonosensitizer. Finally, NIR metal agents are used to study the pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a regulated form of pro-inflammatory cell death that is characterized by the release of cytokines, damage, and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as cell lysis.323 Pyroptosis-induced inflammation has been found to enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blocking (ICB). Unfortunately, the majority of current pyroptosis inducers are chemical agents. There is a lack of reported NIR metal agents capable of inducing pyroptosis.324 In particular, how to detect the level of pyroptosis signal changes in vivo with NIR luminous metal agents is worth further study. Previous studies have shown that pyroptosis is associated with the development of infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other illnesses. Therefore, studying pyroptosis signals in the context of related diseases is crucial for their prevention and treatment. Finally, NIR metal agents are used to diagnose the plant disease. In the process of growth and development, plants are affected by various adverse factors, resulting in plant diseases. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of plant diseases is of great practical significance for food quality security and sustainable production capacity. Fluorescence imaging has shown great potential in the diagnosis of plant diseases. However, green plants are affected by the endogenous fluorescence signals of chlorophyll and other pigments in plant leaves during fluorescence imaging, resulting in poor imaging quality. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop some NIR metal agents, especially in the NIR-II region, for the diagnosis of plant diseases.
6. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, we comprehensively reviewed the recent advances in NIR metal agents excluding MMCs, MOCs and MOFs as well as their biomedical applications. Extending the excitation wavelength of metal agents into the NIR region results in deeper tissue penetration depth for diagnosis and treatment, and higher maximum permissible exposure of laser irradiation of photons, compared with that in the UV-vis region. For constructing NIR fluorescent metal agents, especially those with fluorescent wavelengths located in the NIR-II biowindow, the negligible self-fluorescence, absorption and scattering of tissues allow NIR fluorescence imaging with high temporal and spatial resolution. Each NIR metal agent's potential growth path is discussed in depth below.
6.1 MMCs
The pursuit has been to develop longer wavelength MMCs, that increase diagnostic accuracy significantly. A common strategy for developing long-wavelength MMCs is to extend π-conjugated systems, replace hydrogen with polarizable heteroatoms or introduce electron-absorbing substituents. Another part of the strategy is the introduction of NIR-excited/emitted ligands or introduce lanthanide metals. Other strategies include utilizing metal–metal interactions such as platinum complexes, the introduction of strong field ligands such as chromium complexes, and J-aggregation. In addition to the previously described single-photon excited MMCs, the design of two-photon excited MMCs is beneficial for extending the excitation wavelength. The two-photon absorption capacity can be effectively improved by adjusting the size, charge and functional groups to increase their GM values.325 Utilizing the aforementioned strategy, a vast number of NIR MMCs have been successfully developed, yielding outstanding results in the field of biomedicine. Yet, there are several issues that require more investigation.
(1) MOCs, being the first metal agents produced, have led to significant advances in clinical and preclinical diagnosis and treatment, such as DPTA-Ga3+, cisplatin and TLD-1433 for PET imaging and chemotherapy. As a result, NIR MMCs, especially in the NIR-II region, are predicted to be the most promising choice for clinical applications. Recently, an Er(III) molecule complex with a luminescence wavelength greater than 1500 nm has been described, indicating therapeutic translational promise.176 Hence, the long-time metabolic, residual and toxic consequences of NIR MMCs need to be evaluated. Moreover, NIR MMCs must be tested in in vivo large animal models that can display clinical features.
(2) Activated molecular probes considerably improve the accuracy of early disease detection owing to their high sensitivity and specificity.326 Over the past decade, activable molecular probes have mainly focused on small fluorescent molecules that do not contain metals, and there are only very few examples of MMC-based activable probes for diagnostics and therapies. Compared with pure organic small molecule probes, MMCs have the advantages of better water solubility and light stability, longer luminescence lifetime and 1O2 lifetime. Therefore, the development of activable NIR MMCs will be extremely advantageous in enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of focal locations.
(3) Despite significant advances in precision medicine using NIR MMCs, there is presently a lack of ways to monitor therapy impact in situ. Ye et al. reported a continuous stimulus-triggered in situ self-assembly and disassembly system to test a fluorescent small molecule cisplatin prodrug for cancer treatment.327 This system greatly improves cancer detection and treatment accuracy. This method, however, has only been deployed to evaluate the efficacy of cisplatin medication therapy, and a vast number of NIR MOCs are yet to be applied. As a result, the development of a novel in situ self-assessment method is critical for improving the diagnosis and treatment of NIR MMCs.
(4) Although NIR-II metal agents have made great achievements in precision diagnosis and treatment, the lack of clinically available NIR-II fluorescence equipment has been hindering their clinical practice. So far, NIR-II confocal fluorescence microscopy has not been developed, which limits the visualization of subcellular organelles. In addition, due to the complexity and dynamic changes in the biological environment, a single-channel NIR-II imaging system is insufficient in accurately presenting the overall outline of biological physiological and pathological changes.328 As a result, a real-time multi-channel NIR-II imaging system is required to monitor multiple biological events simultaneously, providing a powerful means to further reveal the occurrence and development of diseases. The development of a NIR-II fluorescence-integrated multimodal tomography imaging system is crucial for obtaining comprehensive disease data. This system provides powerful tools to parse complex physiological processes and obtain precise functional information about living organisms. Metal agents can integrate metal ions for MRI or PET imaging with NIR-II imaging, which guarantees the combination of multiple imaging methods.329 This advancement has the potential to greatly improve disease diagnosis and treatment.
6.2 MOCs
MOCs have been frequently employed in optics, molecular sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. In particular, great achievements have been made in the construction of MOCs in the NIR region for imaging and therapy in recent years. For example, the NIR MOCs are constructed by utilizing photosensitizers that emit strong NIR luminescence emission or produce strong ROS (e.g. porphyrins, BODIPY, perylene diimide fluorophores, and D–A–D fluorophores) as ligands.62,64,224,330 In terms of constructing NIR-I MOCs, a combination of multiple imaging modalities (such as PET, MRI, and PAI) allows for more precise tumor treatment,223 while for NIR-II MOCs, our group used amphiphilic materials (e.g., DSPE-mPEG and F127) to wrap NIR-II fluorophores and MOCs to form nanoparticles or to the use of NIR-II fluorophores as ligands of MOCs to form supramolecules, resulting in more accurate diagnosis and treatment.221,246 This prevents the MOCs and fluorophores from escaping from amphiphilic materials and dispersing in the cell, rendering luminescence signals to detect the location of MOCs. Notwithstanding the fact that NIR MOCs have achieved significant advances in the biological applications of precise diagnosis and therapy. Nonetheless, numerous issues still exist and must be solved as soon as possible.
(1) At present, only a few MOCs have been reported in the NIR-II region, and the development of NIR MOCs is hampered by the limited types of organic ligands and metal ions available. The development of NIR MOCs was primarily centered on the usage of BODIPY and D–A–D skeletons as ligands and Pt and Ru as metal centers. In addition, fluorophores with strong NIR absorption/emission generally have longer or larger conjugate planes, especially since the solubility of the introduced pyridine group in organic solvents is considerably reduced, making MOC synthesis more difficult. Although many terpyridine-based MOCs composed of other types of metal ions (e.g., Zn, Fe, Cd, and Co) have recently been reported, most of the terpyridine-based MOCs are located in visible light region, which limits their further biomedical applications.331–333 Therefore, it is critical to enrich the molecular library of NIR MOCs and further screen MOCs with excellent performance. In particular, the successful development of NIR-IIa/IIb absorption/emission (NIR-IIa, 1300–1400 nm; NIR-IIb, 1500–1700 nm) MOCs would represent a qualitative leap in precision diagnosis and treatment.
(2) The water solubility and stability of NIR MOCs are critical to their biological effectiveness. Most NIR MOCs contain large and hydrophobic conjugated planes, resulting in poor water solubility and stability under physiological conditions, particularly when exposed to NIR light. The current common solution is to encapsulate NIR MOCs using amphiphilic materials such as DSPE-mPEG and F127 to improve their in vivo stability and biosafety, which has hampered research into the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and excretion of individual MOCs. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop NIR MOCs with good water solubility and high stability. To address water solubility issues, NIR MOCs capable of bio-orthogonal reactions can be constructed to introduce water-soluble groups via click chemistry. To increase the stability of individual MOCs, various covalent or non-covalent interactions might be inserted within the MOCs. Furthermore, while the current focus of research on the physiological stability of MOCs is primarily on Pt-based MOCs, Ru-based MOCs, and Pd-based MOCs, exploring MOCs of other metals with better stability holds great potential.
(3) The responsive luminescence probe may respond to specific pathological stimuli and improve the detection signal-to-noise ratio, allowing biomarkers to analyze the pathological process at the molecular level and be semi-quantifiable in real-time.334 Unfortunately, at the moment, MOCs' reaction to biomolecules is restricted to the detection of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, and bioamines, among other things.335 While the detection of several essential bio-signaling molecules (SO2, NO, H2O, ClO4−, ONOO−, etc.) has not been realized. This is particularly important for achieving more accurate diagnosis and treatment of MOCs. As a result, the development of responsive NIR MOCs is beneficial to the advancement of precision medicine. Moreover, multi-response MOCs may be built by combining many diverse response ligands into one via coordination-driven self-assembly, which will increase diagnostic accuracy even further.
(4) MOCs have been found to have higher cellular absorption capability and selectivity between malignant and normal cells due to their numerous positive charges, adequate lipophilicity, and unique supramolecular structure. In addition, MOCs were mainly accumulated in lysosomes and were also found to be localized in the nucleus.223,243 Yet, the details of MOC mechanisms in complex physiological contexts have not been investigated. For example, whether localization of MOCs in mitochondria or intranets lead to a different death mechanism from that of lysosomes. In addition, which macromolecules interact with MOCs in living organisms remains to be investigated further.
6.3 MOFs
MOFs are widely employed in biomedicine due to their distinctive three-dimensional porous structure, large internal surface area, high loading capacity and variety of metal nodes.253,336,337 Despite tremendous advances in the development of NIR MOFs and precision diagnosis and treatment, the biological use of MOFs in the NIR region still confronts substantial hurdles.
(1) Although various NIR MOFs have been described, the major strategies for constructing NIR MOFs include loading NIR fluorophores such as cyanine and D–A–D type fluorophores into MOFs cavities or employing lanthanide metals as their metal nodes.257,265,268 This leads to problems such as insufficient loading of the fluorophore, easy fluorophore shedding, and expensive lanthanide metal prices. As a result, employing NIR fluorophores as a ligand to construct NIR MOFs is a relatively ideal method, particularly using NIR-II fluorophore as an organic ligand for NIR-II MOFs construction. Nevertheless, the synthesis difficulties are substantially exacerbated due to the large conjugated structure and poor solubility of the NIR-II fluorophores, which might be adopted as the direction of future research efforts.
(2) The majority of currently available MOFs lack tumor targeting, and MOFs with strong targeting play an important role in enhancing imaging treatment and therapeutic impact. Although several materials have been employed to improve MOF targeting, few efforts have been made to investigate the effects of different surface coating strategies on MOF performance and targeting. It is necessary to improve the targeting performance of MOFs for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
(3) The toxicity of MOFs is the most pressing issue in fundamental and clinical research. Nevertheless, many current investigations on the toxicity of MOFs focus primarily on short-term in vivo or acute toxicity trials, with long-term toxicity of MOFs being infrequently described. Hence, large-scale in vivo studies and long-term monitoring of MOF tissue accumulation are urgently needed. Furthermore, using metal ions (such as Fe, Ca, Zn, etc.) with better biocompatibility as metal nodes of NIR MOFs can significantly reduce the toxicity of MOFs.
