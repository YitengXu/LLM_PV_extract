    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 12th June 2021AbstractA series of ruthenium photosensitizers incorporating a β-diketonate non-innocent ligand were synthesized, characterized, and implemented in dye-sensitized solar cells. Electrochemical studies exhibited well behaved reversible oxidations and reductions for all β-diketonate complexes. The acac− and Ph2acac− based photosensitizers possess limited delocalization across the ligand π*-manifold, which is significant for exhibition of respectable power conversion efficiencies in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) device. As the π-orbital network was extended on the flavone and curcumin inspired NILs, increased molar absorptivity was observed, however this ultimately proved detrimental to DSC performance consistent with exhibition of negligible photocurrent.
Introduction
When optimizing dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) performance, it is key to implement a photosensitizer that fits the specific energy requirements of the DSC device. For example, in a n-type DSC device, the photosensitizer should have a LUMO at a more negative potential than the conduction band of the n-type (typically TiO2) semiconductor, facilitating a thermodynamically viable excited-state oxidation for efficient charge injection.1 Concurrently, the HOMO level should have a positive potential capable of exergonic reduction by the redox mediator ensuring competitive dye regeneration to prevent charge recombination. Many such photosensitizers have been developed using ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, often inspired by Grätzel's N3 dye commonly used as a benchmark in DSC studies.2 While there are legitimate environmental concerns with the application of rare earth metals in DSCs when so many efficient organic photosensitisers now exist,3 the exploration of new metal–ligand combinations and their impact on device performance is still of major fundamental interest, not just for DSCs but also in the growing field of photo-electrosynthesis cells.4 This is due to the diverse photochemical and redox properties of Ru(II) based photosensitizers, which often include a strong and panchromatic visible absorption, long excited-state lifetimes, redox stability, and efficient electron transfer at TiO2.5 The photophysical and redox properties of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have recently gained more attention due to non-innocent ligand (NIL) systems that promote metal-to-ligand π-bonding and provide an additional handle for the tuning of electronic properties.6–11 Such NILs possess π-donating orbitals of similar energy to the traditionally non-bonding Ru(dπ) orbitals.12 Symmetry allowing, when these orbitals are close enough in energy, metal–ligand frontier orbital mixing can occur resulting in hybrid Ru(dπ)–ligand(π) molecular orbitals. This changes the electronic and photophysical properties of the traditional “innocent” coordination complexes. For example, [Ru(bpy)3]2+, where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, is characterized by a strong singlet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (1MLCT) visible absorption (λmax = 454 nm, ε = 14600 M−1 cm−1), metastable triplet 3MLCT excited state (τ = 855 ns) and reversible redox chemistry.13 This is due to localized Ru(d) (E°′ = +0.89 V vs. Fc+/0) and bpy(π*) (E°′ = −1.73 V vs. Fc+/0) orbitals that show independent redox behavior.14,15 However, when one bpy ligand is replaced by either two isothiocyanate ligands, e.g. [Ru(NCS)2(bpy)2], or a bidentate β-diketonate ligand such as acetylacetonate (acac), e.g. [Ru(acac)(bpy)2]+, significant electronic and optical changes are observed.16,17 Firstly, the symmetry of the complex is changed from D3 (often simplified as pseudo-Oh when ignoring bridging bipyridy C–C bonds) to pseudo-C2v reducing the degeneracy of the valence 5d orbitals. Secondly, the anionic NCS− and acac− ligands are non-innocent X-type σ- and π-electron donors, promoting hybridization and resulting in new hybrid Ru(dπ)–ligand(π) molecular orbitals, which may contribute to symmetry allowed (metal–ligand)-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLLCT) electronic transitions. Thirdly, the introduction of a non-innocent ligand raises the HOMO energy reducing the HOMO–LUMO optical band gap and red-shifting their absorption spectra. These unique properties imparted by a NIL at the Ru centre are also of great interest for promoting electronic communication in polymetallic systems, as recently reported for an α-diketonate 2,2′-pyridyl bridging ligand.18 The beauty of the non-innocent ligand effect is that it allows for efficient and simultaneous tuning of photochemical and redox properties of a metal complex, especially useful in designing photosensitizers for DSC applications. A disadvantage of this approach however is the often shorter excited-state lifetime of this class of complex resulting in non-emissive excited states. This may be overcome by the presence of excess reductant in a DSC device as we recently reported for the N-carboxyamidoquinolate non-innocent ligand system in a ruthenium based photosensitizer.11 The β-diketonate acetylacetonate (acac−) ligand is an interesting candidate as the electronic nature of substituents on the diketonate backbone can further tune the complex electronic properties to achieve desired optical and redox characteristics of the photosensitizer. [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ complexes, where dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, were first studied by Takahashi et al. in 2000.19 The three β-diketonate ligands, acetylacetonate (acac−), 3-methyl-2,4-pentanedionate (Meacac−), and 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedionate (Ph2acac−), were all reported to red-shift the absorption spectrum and showed a shoulder at about 600 nm contrasting to the absorption spectrum of the reference N3 photosensitizer. A DSC power conversion efficiency (PCE) of η = 6.0% was observed for [Ru(acac)(dcbpy)2]+, surpassing the PCE of N3 (η = 5.7%) in the same study. Similarly, Islam et al. designed two [Ru(NCS)3(tctpy)]− black-dye analogues (where tctpy = 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) by replacing two of the thiocyanate ligands with 1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dionato and 1,1,1-trifluoroeicosane-2,4-dionato.20 The latter complex incorporated a long hydrocarbon chain which insulated the TiO2-photosensitizer interface from charge-recombination with the oxidized electrolyte redox-mediator. The observed photocurrents for the latter two complexes were comparable to that of the black dye.21 Sugihara et al. also studied [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ complexes, incorporating dipivaloylmethane instead of two thiocyanate ligands.22 They showed that [Ru(dipivaloylmethanato)(dcbpy)2]+ has a higher molar extinction coefficient than the [Ru(acac)(dcbpy)2]+ complex at 600 nm resulting in a PCE of η = 6.9%, an improvement of 0.4% relative to the N3 dye. This study aims to expand the family of Ru(II)-based β-diketonate complexes by investigating the non-innocent character of β-diketonate ligands inspired by the naturally occurring flavonoid and curcumin pigments by means of photophysical, electrochemical, computational and photoelectrochemical analysis. These ligands are known for their antioxidant bioactivity and their vibrant yellow colours due to intense visible π–π* electronic transitions.23,24 Indeed, a series of 5-hydroxyflavone derived [Ru(β-diketonate)(DIP)2]+ complexes (where DIP = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) were recently reported to impair cellular respiration and glycolysis leading to apoptosis in MCF-7 human melanoma breast cancer cell lines.25 Similarly, the [Ru(curcumin)(bpy)(dppz)]+ complex was recently reported to induce cell apoptosis via DNA intercalation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signal inhibition in the A549 lung cancer cell lines.26 The narrative of this article is focussed primarily on the fundamental photophysical and redox properties of homogenous [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2]+ systems to understand the impact of flavone and curcumin inspired NILs on their electronic properties. This is followed by the presentation of preliminary DSC studies using their [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ counterparts. The molecular structures of all complexes here investigated are summarized in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The ligands used in complexes 4+–8+ and 4a+–8a+ were chosen due to their π-extended electronic structures relative to the acac− ligand (3+ and 3a+). The o-orthobenzophenone (HOBP, 5+ and 5a+) and 5-hydroxyflavone (HOFlav, 6+ and 6a+) free acids are commercially available. The natural free acid curcumin is also commercially available but typically only as a mixture of curcuminoids with variable hydroxyl and methoxy substitution at the terminal aryl ring. As such, the Ph2curcumin (7+ and 7a+) and natural curcumin (8+ and 8a+) free acids were prepared in high purity according to a literature method by Qiu et al.27 The ligand precursors were complexed to the ruthenium(II) bis(2,2-bipyridyl) core in methanol in the presence of one equivalent of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Scheme 1). [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2][PF6] salts were isolated by aqueous NH4PF6 metathesis resulting in dark reddish brown precipitates. The analogous 4,4′-dicarboxylic-2,2′-bipyridyl [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ photosensitizers were synthesized by complexation of the same free acid ligand precursors with [RuCl2(dcbpy)2] in methanol with a stoichiometric amount of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide taking into consideration the lower pKa of the four carboxylic acid functional groups on the ancillary dcbpy ligands (Scheme 1). Simultaneous carboxylate acidification and counteranion metathesis with HPF6 precipitated the [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ cations as their PF6− salts.

Computational studies
Theoretical analysis of the [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2]+ frontier orbitals was completed to aid in the assignment and discussion of all relevant electronic transitions and redox couples. All calculations were conducted using the B3LYP functional with the 6-31g(d,p) (C, H, N, O) and LANL08 (Ru) basis sets in an acetonitrile polarizable continuum solvent model. Theoretical analysis helps to estimate the extent of ruthenium(dπ)–β-diketonate(π) mixing at the frontier molecular orbital level. Furthermore, the influence of such mixing on frontier orbital energies and their contribution to the electronic transitions can also be interrogated by this approach. Introduction of a π-donating β-diketonate ligand at the Ru(II) centre alters the D3 π-bonding symmetry of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ destabilizing the HOMO level. In particular, mixing of Ru(dπ) and β-diketonate(π) orbitals results in a number of filled bonding/anti-bonding derivative frontier molecular orbitals due to the π-donating properties of the β-diketonate ligand (Fig. 2).

The latter diagram illustrates the bonding and anti-bonding Ru(dπ)–β-diketonate(π) hybrid molecular orbitals (highlighted in red) responsible for destabilization of the HOMO level relative to the pseudo-Oh hexamine system. 
Percentage contributions derived from Mulliken population analysis for each Ru centre, NIL and bpy ligands for a selection of relevant frontier orbitals is provided in the ESI‡ along with their calculated energies (Table ESI-1, ESI‡). For brevity this data is not discussed here at length. However, it is worth noting that the Ru(dπ)–β-diketonate(π) interaction is far more complex than assumed in Fig. 2 and is consistently evident for complexes 3+–8+ across the entire populated valence shell from the HOMO level through to the HOMO−6 levels. This percentage population analysis is summarized in Fig. 3 solely for the HOMO level of complexes 12+–8+ where the extent of Ru(dπ)–β-diketonate(π) mixing is clearly evident and quite significant for the OBP− (5+), OFlav− (6+) and curcuminoid (8+) ligands.

The frontier molecular orbital energies for 12+–8+ are provided in Fig. 4. The differences in band gap and orbital energy levels are consistent with UV/Vis and electrochemical data (vide infra). In particular, the larger HOMO–LUMO band gap for [Ru(bpy)3]2+ of 3.48 eV is significantly narrowed by the π-donating non-innocent β-diketonate ligands resulting in HOMO–LUMO band gaps ranging from 2.87 eV for 6+ to 3.14 eV for 4+.

UV/Vis electronic absorption spectra and TDDFT
The visible electronic absorption properties of a DSC photosensitizer are critical in determining device effectiveness.1 As the likelihood of excited-state dye molecules (S*) increases, more electrons are available for charge injection to the TiO2 semiconductor conduction band with the potential to contribute to the observed photocurrent. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) quantifies the absorptive qualities of a dye and allows comparison of solar light harvesting capabilities between multiple complexes. For DSC applications, a higher ε for wavelengths in the UV/Vis region are generally favourable to the overall PCE, assuming redox alignment of the device components are sufficient. The UV/Vis absorption properties of 12+–8+ were studied in acetonitrile at room temperature and are presented in Fig. 5. As noted earlier, the introduction of a bis-chelating π-donating β-diketonate ligand reduces the pseudo-Oh symmetry of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex to pseudo-C2v for [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2]+ and breaks the degeneracy of the frontier Ru(d) orbitals reducing the HOMO–LUMO band gap. As a result, the characteristic 454 nm 1MLCT absorption band of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is split into two bands of similar intensity at higher and lower energies. A detailed summary of absorption maxima and molar extinction coefficients is presented in Table 1.

Assignment of the multiple underlying electronic transitions responsible for these absorption bands by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) analysis illustrates the complex electronic structure of [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2]+ systems. A full collection of computed TDDFT spectra, electronic transition assignments, with relevant molecular orbital surfaces, is provided in the ESI,‡ for all complexes here studied. In the interest of brevity, a selection of these spectra, and important conclusions derived therefrom, are discussed here. The lowest energy absorption maxima for complexes 3+, 4+, 7+ and 8+ containing symmetric β-diketonate ligands occur in the range 498–518 nm. For complexes 3+, 4+ and 7+ this absorption has a majority contribution from the HOMO−2 → LUMO/LUMO+1 electronic transition, and is best described as singlet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT). This is essentially a conventional Ru(d) → bpy(π*) electronic transition. In contrast, the natural curcuminoid complex 8+ is more difficult to define, especially as the LUMO level is a mix of bpy(π*) and curcumin(π*) emphasizing how complex 8+ inherits significant light-harvesting properties from the notable π → π* absorption of the natural curcumin pigment.23 The lowest energy absorption maximum of 8+ has major contributions from the HOMO−2 → LUMO/LUMO+1 and HOMO−3 → LUMO electronic transitions. Each of the HOMO−2, HOMO−3, LUMO and LUMO+2 orbitals have a significant contribution from the π-backbone of the natural curcumin ligand due to its electron rich hydroxyl and methoxy groups. Thus, the lowest energy maximum absorption band for 8+ is best described as a [Ru(dπ)–curcumin(π)] → [bpy(π*)/curcumin(π*)] singlet (metal–ligand)-to-ligand (1MLLCT) electronic transition (Fig. 6). It is worth noting that both curcuminoid complexes 7+ and 8+ display exceptionally high molar extinction coefficients at 377 and 398 nm, respectively. These high molar extinction coefficients are correlated to strong oscillator strength HOMO−3 → LUMO (7+), and HOMO−2/HOMO−3 → LUMO+2 (8+) electronic transitions, respectively, all originating from a NIL derived bonding [Ru(dπ)–curcuminoid(π)] orbital.

Complexes 5+ and 6+, containing the asymmetric OBP− and OFlav− β-diketonate ligands, exhibit low energy absorption maxima at 495 and 512 nm, respectively. These absorption bands have significant contribution from the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 electronic transition and are best characterized as localized 1MLCT transitions. The higher energy absorption band maxima for complexes 5+ and 6+ also consist of a variety of electronic transitions, similar to symmetric complexes 3+ and 4+. Once again, these electronic transitions are a mix of 1MLCT transitions, originating from the predominantly Ru-based HOMO−1 or HOMO−2 levels, combined with 1MLLCT electronic transitions originating from the hybrid Ru(dπ)/β-diketonate(π) HOMO−3 level.
Unique to complexes 4+, 5+ and 6+ is a small intermediate peak between the highest and lowest energy maxima in the visible region at 419, 420 and 433 nm, respectively (Fig. 5). This peak is the result of both 1MLCT (HOMO−2 → LUMO+2) and 1MLLCT (HOMO → L+3) based electronic transitions. The 1MLCT transition is described as Ru(d) → NIL(π*) where the destination π* orbital is distributed throughout the non-innocent Ph2acac−, OBP− and OFlav− ligands. In contrast, the 1MLLCT transition is a result of resonance between the filled Ru–NIL antibonding and bpy π* anti-bonding orbitals, i.e. [Ru(dπ*)–NIL(π*)] → bpy(π*). An exemplar overlay of experimental and TDDFT spectra is provided in Fig. 7 for the flavonoid complex 6+. This intermittent peak is particularly promising for DSC applications as it improves absorption in a region that is typically a local minimum for traditional ruthenium polypyridyl dye sensitizers such as N3.

Electrochemistry
Redox potentials for all complexes 12+–8+ were measured by cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6] acetonitrile supporting electrolyte with a standard three electrode set-up. Observed redox potentials are summarized in Table 2 with the corresponding cyclic voltammograms presented in Fig. 8. All voltammograms are referenced versus the ferricenium/ferrocene internal standard (Fc+/0). All complexes exhibit a reversible one-electron oxidation event. Systematic of the NIL-effect, the hybrid Ru(dπ)–β-diketonate(π) singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) formed upon one-electron oxidation consists of a radical cation that can be expressed as canonical forms with resonance between Ru(III) and [β-diketonate]˙+ electronic states (Scheme 2).

 Scheme 2  Resonance forms of [Ru(β-diketonate)(bpy)2]2+ that results in ambiguous oxidation state due to non-innocent bonding interaction. 
This reversible one-electron oxidation event occurs across a potential range from +0.13 V (6+) to +0.28 V (4+) depending upon the peripheral structure of the β-diketonate ligand. Ultimately all β-diketonate complexes 3+–8+ exhibit a large cathodic shift compared to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (E°′ = +0.89 V) consistent with the hypothesis that substitution of bpy with a π-donating β-diketonate ligand destabilizes the HOMO level relative to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as confirmed by DFT calculations (vide supra), i.e. this is not simply a coulombic effect of the anionic β-diketonate ligands here employed. Increasing π-conjugation from 4+ to 7+ (Ph2acac vs. Ph2curcumin) results in a slight cathodic shift from +0.28 V to +0.22 V. The oxidation potential is further shifted to +0.18 V when compared to 8+ due to the electron donating hydroxyl and methoxy groups of the curcumin ligand. Complexes 6+ and 7+ also show a similar trend due to the increased conjugation on going from OBP− to OFlav−. The first reduction potentials for complexes 3+–8+ are observed in the range −1.82 V (7+) to −1.94 V (3+). One-electron reduction is assigned to population of a bpy(π*) orbital for complexes 1+–6+. For the curcuminoid complexes, however, extended π-conjugation of the β-diketonate backbone lowers the energy of their π* molecular orbitals as determined by computational analysis. As such the first reduction of 7+ is assigned to population of the lowest energy Ph2curcuminoid π* molecular orbital. This effect is slightly offset due to the electron donating methoxy and hydroxyl groups of the natural curcuminoid derived ligand, hence its first-reduction is assigned to population of the LUMO of 8+ which is a mixture of bpy(π*)/curcumin(π*). Unfortunately, this shift in LUMO electron density onto the curcuminoid π* manifold appears to have a negative impact on its charge-injection efficiency in a DSC device (vide infra). Both the second reductions of 7+ and 8+ are irreversible with 8+ exhibiting a sharp rise in current indicative of electrode deposition during the voltammetry scan. As only one-electron reduced species are produced in a DSC this behaviour is anticipated to be non-consequential for device performance.
DSC studies
The related [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ complexes 3a+–8a+ were synthesized in a similar manner for application as photosensitizers in a DSC device (Scheme 1). The four carboxylate groups present on the reference N3 dye and β-diketonate dyes 3a+–8a+ covalently anchor each complex to the n-TiO2 semiconductor interface to allow for an optimum absorption cross section and light harvesting efficiency in a mesoporous electrode. DSC devices were fabricated using n-TiO2 working electrodes and an iodide based redox mediator electrolyte solution. The low 3.25% PCE of the reference N3-based DSC presented below is a consequence of the shallow 4 μm layer of active TiO2, however, we wish to emphasize the aim of this study was not to develop high-performance DSCs but to make a valid comparison of all photosensitizer PCEs in consistently fabricated devices from standard-established materials. A collection of current density–voltage (J–V) curves is presented in Fig. 9 with a quantitative summary of photovoltaic performance for all photosensitizers presented in Table 3.

Devices fabricated with 3a+ and 4a+ exhibited PCEs of η = 2.78% and η = 2.41% respectively, comparable to the N3 reference device which performed slightly better at a PCE of η = 3.25%. With the VOC and FF for these three devices being very similar, their difference in PCE are primarily attributed to the lower JSC observed for 3a+ (6.81 mA cm−2) and 4a+ (5.64 mA cm−2) relative to N3 (8.00 mA cm−2). DSC devices fabricated with 5a+–8a+ showed negligible PCEs with η < 1%. Although the VOC for 5a+–8a+ are reasonable at ∼0.5 V compared to ∼0.6 V for 3a+, 4a+, and N3, the JSC response for 5a+–8a+ were much lower ranging just from 0.56–1.57 mA cm−2. This reduced JSC and thus poor PCE can be attributed to a reduced driving force for dye regeneration by the iodide redox mediator. It is also plausible that the poor JSC exhibited by 7a+ and 8a+ be attributed to location of the excited state electron density on the curcuminoid ligands which is situated away from the working electrode surface preventing efficient charge injection into the n-TiO2 conduction band. While these preliminary DSC studies are disappointing, due to their favourable absorptive qualities and sufficient driving force for charge injection to TiO2, implementation of 4a+–8a+ with alternative redox mediators,28 and alternative positioning of the carboxy anchors onto the β-diketonate ligands may provide for improved DSC performance and will be investigated in future studies.
Conclusions
A series of ruthenium photosensitizers incorporating a β-diketonate non-innocent ligand were synthesized, characterized, and implemented in dye-sensitized solar cells. Electrochemical studies exhibited well behaved reversible oxidations for all β-diketonate complexes 3+–8+ with potentials ranging from +0.13 V (6+) to +0.28 V (4+). DSCs fabricated with the acac− (3a+) and Ph2acac− (4a+) ligands, possessing limited LUMO delocalization across the ligand π*-manifold, exhibited respectable PCEs of η = 2.78% and η = 2.41% compared to a PCE of η = 3.25% achieved for the reference N3 dye. As the π-orbital network was extended on the flavone and curcumin inspired NILs, increased molar absorptivity was observed, however this ultimately proved detrimental to DSC performance with photosensitizers 4a+–8a+ exhibiting negligible photocurrent. Nevertheless, their strong light-harvesting properties combined with favorable driving forces for charge injection to TiO2 suggests that implementation of 4a+–8a+ with alternative redox mediators,28 and alternative positioning of the carboxy anchors onto the β-diketonate ligands, may provide for improved device performance in future studies.
Experimental section
Physical measurements
Electronic absorption spectra were recorded in acetonitrile using an Agilent 8453 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Voltammetry of the complexes was measured using 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6] acetonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. The electrolyte was recrystallized thrice from absolute ethanol and dried under vacuum in a desiccator for a minimum of 24 hours prior to use. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a CH 620 potentiostat with a three-electrode configuration. A glassy carbon disk working electrode (3 mm diameter), a non-aqueous Ag+ wire reference electrode in the same supporting electrolyte separated by a vycor frit, and a Pt wire counter electrode were used for all measurements. Recorded potentials were referenced using the ferrocene/ferricenium couple (Fc+/0, 0.40 V vs. SCE)29 as an internal standard.
Computational details
All calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP functional as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program package.30 The LANL08 basis set31 was used for Ru and 6-31G(d,p) is used for other elements.32,33 The optimization calculations were carried out using the polarizable continuum model (PCM) with the dielectric constant of acetonitrile.34 A vibrational frequency analysis coupling with PCM model was carried out in order to confirm the minimum-energy geometry in solution, followed by Time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT).35
Dye-sensitized solar cell studies
A 0.36 cm2 TiO2 photoanode was fabricated by the doctor-blade method on conductive FTO glass substrates (Pilkington TEC 7) using a single 4 μm transparent layer of Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide T/SP as a substrate for dye assembly followed by a single 4 μm layer of Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide R/SP to reflect transmitted light. The electrodes were sintered for 30 min at 450 °C after each deposition. Prior to dye sensitization, working electrodes were heated to 100 °C for 30 min and immersed at 70 °C into a room temperature 1 mM methanol solution of dye. Electrodes were left in solution for 24 hours and then rinsed with neat methanol. Working electrodes were assembled with a pre-drilled FTO/Pt counter electrode (Solaronix part # 74201) and sealed together with a 60 μm thick Surlyn® spacer (Solaronix part # 74301). Commercial Iodolyte HI-30 electrolyte solution (Solaronix part # 35411) was introduced through the pre-drilled counter electrode by vacuum back-filling. For photovoltaic (J–V) measurements the assembled DSCs were connected to a CH 760D potentiostat in linear sweep voltammetry mode. A Newport Oriel 100 W Xe arc lamp was used with an AM 1.5 global filter to simulate the solar spectrum. Light intensity was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel model 818-UV/DB photodiode with a Newport Oriel 843-R-USB power meter.
Synthetic details
[RuCl3·nH2O], tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (0.1 M in MeOH), ammonium hexafluorophosphate, hexafluorophosphoric acid (55% w/v), and ligands 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), 2,2-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (dcbpy), acetylacetone (acacH), benzophenone (HOBP), 5-hydroxyflavone (HOFlav) were all sourced commercially and used as received. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was sourced commercially and recrystallized thrice from hot ethanol prior to use. All solvents were of spectroscopic grade and used as received. (1E,6E)-1,7-Bisphenyl-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (Ph2curc),27 (1E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (curcumin),27 [RuCl2(bpy)2],36 [RuCl2(dcbpy)2],25 [Ru(NCS)2(bpy)2],37 and [Ru(NCS)2(dcbpy)2]2 were prepared according to literature methods. [Ru(acac)(bpy)2][PF6],38 [Ru(acac)(dcbpy)2][PF6]16,19 and [Ru(Ph2acac)(dcbpy)2][PF6]19 were prepared following the general synthetic procedures described below and their analytical data was consistent with that previously reported. Poor solubility and signal-to-noise issues were persistent in the 1H NMR spectra for all [Ru(β-diketonate)(dcbpy)2]+ complexes thus their purity was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
General synthetic method for complexes 3+–8+ and 3a+–8a+
A 10 mL microwave vial was charged with 3 mL of methanol, 0.2 mmol of [Ru(bpy)2Cl2] (3+–8+) or [Ru(dcbpy)2Cl2] (3a+–8a+), 0.2 mmol of the appropriate β-diketonate ligand, and 0.2 mmol (3+–8+) or 1.0 mmol (3a+–8a+) of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (1.0 M in MeOH). The resulting reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 20 minutes with stirring in a CEM Discovery microwave reactor resulting in a dark red solution. Methanol was reduced (<1 mL) via a rotary evaporator and the crude solution dissolved in deionized water. The crude aqueous reaction mixtures were first inflicted to gravity filtration to remove any unreacted ligand. Subsequent dropwise addition of aqueous 1.0 M NH4PF6 (3+–8+) or 1.0 M HPF6 (3a+–8a+, to pH 4) resulted in precipitation of a dark red solid which was filter on a fine frit glass sintered funnel. Recrystallization from acetone/diethyl ether (3+–8+) or MeOH:acetone (1:10 v/v)/diethyl ether (3a+–8a+) allowed filtration of analytically pure dark red solids.
