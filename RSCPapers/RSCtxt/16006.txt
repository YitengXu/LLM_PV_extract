    , Accepted 29th April 2019First published on 29th April 2019AbstractNatural systems have marvelously utilized copper complexes featuring sulfur-coordinating ligands, known as blue copper proteins, as efficient electron-transfer mediators in biological processes. Copper complexes with sulfur-coordinating ligands have been attempted as redox mediators in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the performance of which is not yet satisfactory and still remains less well explored. Herein, we report the application of new copper complexes bearing a tetradentate polythioether ligand, [(S4)Cu]2+/+ (12+/+, S4 = 1,4,8,11-tetrathiocyclotetradecane), as a redox mediator in DSCs in comparison with its N4-tetradentate counterpart [(N4)Cu]2+/+ (22+/+, N4 = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). Impressively, the changes of coordination atoms from N to S positively shift the formal redox potential of the copper complexes by 600 mV, leading to a remarkably high photovoltage approaching 1.0 V. This is one of the highest photovoltage values reported thus far for DSCs based on copper redox mediators.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been drastically studied as viable renewable energy candidates over the past two decades, due to their simple fabrication, low-cost, aesthetic design features, outstanding performance for indoor applications, and so forth.1,2 The redox mediator is an indispensable component in DSCs for achieving high performance, which plays an essential role in effective dye regeneration and charge transport between the photoanode, typically TiO2 attached with sensitizers, and the counter electrode.3,4 Recently, Cu(II/I) complexes have attracted growing interest as redox mediators and hole-transport materials in DSCs, owing to some of their appealing characteristics, including minimized driving force for dye regeneration, low toxicity, high earth reserves of the copper metal, and so forth.5–18
Of particular interest is the fact that the redox potentials of copper and other transition-metal complexes can be fine-tuned through the modification of ligands. A more positive redox potential of a redox mediator is crucial because the maximum open-circuit voltage (Voc) of DSCs is determined by the potential gap between the redox potential of the redox mediator and the quasi-Fermi energy level of TiO2.4,14 Increasing the Voc is an important research endeavor for further improvement of the overall efficiency of DSCs. Very recently, Zhang et al. significantly improved the Voc of DSCs through manipulating a sensitizer with a lower-lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level (1.15 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and a copper redox couple with a more positive redox potential (0.87 V versus NHE).19 In comparison to the state-of-the-art redox mediator cobalt(III/II) tris(bipyridyl) ([Co(bpy)3]3+/2+) with a more negative potential (0.56 V versus NHE), copper complexes remarkably attenuated the dye regeneration overpotential, which led to a considerably high photovoltage up to 1.1 V with an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.6% relative to 0.93 V Voc and 10.3% PCE for the cobalt counterpart.
Natural systems have marvelously utilized copper complexes, known as blue copper proteins, as efficient electron-transfer mediators in biological processes.5,20,21 In those type I blue copper proteins, the Cu ion is coordinated to two imine nitrogen atoms from histidine residues and to two sulfur atoms (mercaptide and thioether), one from a cysteine residue and the other from a methionine residue.20,21 The presence of highly polarizable sulfur-coordinating ligands can, in principle, positively shift the redox potential of Cu complexes. To our knowledge, reports on the use of sulfur-coordinating ligands in Cu-based redox mediators for DSCs have been rather scarce so far. In 2005, Fukuzumi and co-workers first introduced blue copper model complexes, [(−)-sparteine-N,N′](maleonitriledithiolato-S,S′)copper ([Cu(SP)(mmt)])0/−, as a redox mediator in DSCs.5 Because of the relatively negative potential (∼0.53 V versus NHE), a modest Voc of 0.66 V was achieved with a PCE of only 1.3%. Recently, Hupp et al. introduced a tetradentate bipyridyl dithiaoctane-based ligand coded as PDTO into Cu(II/I) complexes.9 It was found that the Cu(II) form was prone to the substitution reaction with the most frequently used additive 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), largely due to the soft nature of the coordination environment related to the weaker coordination ability between S and Cu as compared to that of N and Cu. Nevertheless, a high Voc of 0.88 V was achieved for the PDTO-based copper complexes, strongly associated with their relatively positive redox potential (0.83 V versus NHE).
Herein, we report a new class of copper complexes containing a tetradentate polythioether ligand, [(S4)Cu]2+/+ (12+/+, S4 = 1,4,8,11-tetrathiocyclotetradecane), as a redox mediator in DSCs, in comparison with its N4-tetradentate counterpart [(N4)Cu]2+/+ (22+/+, N4 = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). Our motivation is to study the influence of the changes of coordination atoms in copper redox mediators on their intrinsic properties and thus on the photovoltaic performance of DSC devices.

Device fabrication
The DSC devices were fabricated as reported previously.14,16 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glasses (Pilkington, TEC 15) were first cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol for 30 min, respectively, followed by a UV/O3 treatment (30 min). Then, the substrates were immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution and kept at 70 °C in an oven for 30 min, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. DSC devices were constructed with a double layer TiO2 film consisting of an ∼6 μm transparent layer and an ∼4 μm scattering layer. The transparent layer was fabricated by screen-printing of TiO2 18NR-T paste three times, every time dried at 130 °C for 5 min, and the scattering layer was fabricated by screen-printing of TiO2 TPP200 paste one time. After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 films were treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min again. Then the resulting TiO2 films were immersed in Y123 dye solution (0.1 mM) in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (1:1, v/v) for 16 h. The unattached dyes were rinsed with ethanol and acetonitrile. The Pt counter electrodes were purchased from Heptachroma, and used as received. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and counter electrode were assembled using a 25 μm Surlyn film. The liquid electrolyte was injected into the interlayer through a predrilled hole, which was then sealed with a Surlyn film and a glass cover. The active area of the DSC devices was 0.16 cm2. The photocurrent density–voltage measurements were performed with a black mask (1 mm wider than the active area).
Measurements
Mass spectra were recorded with HP 1100 HPL/ESI-DAD-MS and Waters/Micromass LC/Q-TOF-MS instruments. Elemental analyses were performed with a Thermoquest-Flash EA 1112 elemental analyzer. UV-vis absorption measurements were carried out on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. The test optical path length was 1 cm. The photovoltaic characteristics were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 Source-measure unit with an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator (Model: 94023A, Newport USA). Nanosecond transient absorption spectra (TAS) were recorded with an Edinburgh LP920 transient absorption spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm and the probe wavelength was 720 nm. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a Hypermonolight system (SM-25, Japan), and a standard silicon solar cell was used for calibration before tests.
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex II CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.071073 Å) at 296 K in the ω–2θ scan mode. Data processing was accomplished with the SAINT processing program.22 Intensity data were corrected for absorption using the SADABS program.23 All structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 against full-matrix least-squares methods by using the SHELXTL 97 program package.24 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were located by geometrical calculation. Crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and angles for [(S4)CuII(OH2)](BF4)2 and [(N4)CuII(OH2)](BF4)2 are given in Tables S1 and S2† (CCDC-1855255 and CCDC-1446600).
All electrochemical measurements were performed with a model CHI660E electrochemical workstation (CH instruments). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in a three-electrode cell under argon. The working electrode was a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (0.071 cm2), and the reference electrode and the counter electrode were both platinum wires. A solution of 0.1 M nBu4NPF6 (Fluka, electrochemical grade) in CH3CN was used as a supporting electrolyte, which was degassed by bubbling with argon for 15 min before measurement. The ferricinium/ferrocene (Fc+/0) couple was used as an internal reference (E(Fc+/0) = 0.64 V vs. NHE).
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected on a Bruker electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (A200) with a microwave frequency of 9.326 GHz. During measurement, the modulation frequency, modulation amplitude, and power were set to be 100 kHz, 2 G, and 1 mW, respectively. The samples were dissolved in CH3CN solution prior to the solution EPR measurements at room temperature. The EPR spectra were analyzed with Bruker WinEPR Processing and simulated with WinEPR SimFonia.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a Zennium analyzer system (Model: IM6, Zahner, German) in the dark under bias potentials with a modulation of 15 mV in the frequency range from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Z-view software. The semicircle in the mid-frequency range (1 to 103 Hz) represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The electron lifetime (τe) of DSCs was derived using the equation: τe = RctCμ, where Cμ is the capacitance of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. The charge-extraction measurement was performed using a toolbox (Dyenamo AB, Sweden). The solar cells were kept under open-circuit conditions and illuminated with a modulated light source. The light on time and the measurement time were both 2 s. The solar cells were switched to short-circuit conditions immediately after the light was off, and the current in the circuit was monitored and integrated.
Results and discussion
The details of the synthesis and characterization of copper complexes are described in the Experimental section. Briefly, complexes 12+/+ and 22+/+ were synthesized by the reaction of Cu(BF4)2·6H2O/Cu(BF4)·4CH3CN with the equivalent of S4 or N4 ligands in acetonitrile at room temperature under nitrogen.25,26
The molecular and crystal structures of 12+ and 22+ are shown in Fig. 1. The crystallographic data, selected bond lengths and angles are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Both 12+ and 22+ have a distorted square pyramidal geometry with the tetradentate ligand in the basal square plane and an aqua molecule at the apical site (Fig. 1). The most noticeable difference in the structures of the two Cu(II) complexes is that the lengths of Cu–S bonds in 12+ are 0.223–0.235 Å longer than those of Cu–N bonds in 22+ (Table S2†), owing to the larger atomic radius of S as compared to N.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of S4, 1+, and 12+ are shown in Fig. S1.† There is no obvious absorption peak in the region of 300 to 800 nm for S4 and 1+, because S4 is an aliphatic compound without any conjugated units. The intense absorption peak for 12+ at λmax = 393 nm (ε = 8600 M−1 cm−1) is attributed to sulfur-to-copper(II) charge transfer.9 The absorption at λmax = 560 nm (ε = 1830 M−1 cm−1) arises from the d–d electron transition of Cu(II).
The electrochemical properties of 12+ and 22+ were studied by cyclic voltammetry experiments using a three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 2a, the complexes 12+ and 22+ display reversible redox peaks at E1/2 = 0.91 and 0.31 V versus NHE, respectively, which are assigned to the Cu(II/I) couples rather than the redox peaks of ligands (Fig. S2†). All potentials mentioned in this paper are relative to the NHE unless otherwise stated. Strikingly, the redox potential of 12+ is positively shifted by 600 mV as compared to that of 22+, strongly associated with the considerably longer lengths of Cu–S bonds with respect to those of Cu–N bonds (Table S2†). The coordination bond in 12+ is thereby weakened, so the Cu(II) can be easily reduced to Cu(I) because of the low electron density of the central metal.16 These results emphasize that the redox potentials of copper complexes can be fine-tuned towards more positive values through the substitution of the type of coordination atoms in ligands. The redox potential difference observed for these two complexes also implies that higher photovoltage is predicted to be achieved for 12+/+, provided that the dye regeneration remains efficient. This will be discussed in the following section.

Hupp and co-workers previously found that the coordination changes of the Cu(II) species with sulfur-coordinating ligands are due to the presence of TBP.9 The same phenomenon was also observed in our system as exhibited in Fig. 2c and d from the CV measurements. Hence, the exploration of a stable alternative to replace TBP is essential in order to make copper redox mediators with sulfur-coordinating ligands work efficiently. In this regard, we evaluated the influence of another pyridine-based additive 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DBP) on the electrochemical properties of 1+ and 12+. Strikingly, no obvious changes are detected after addition of DBP as shown in Fig. 2c and d. The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S3†) and high-resolution mass spectra (Fig. S4†) further prove that DBP cannot coordinate to the copper center in 12+, because two bulky tert-butyl groups in the ortho positions of DBP can effectively prevent the coordination of pyridine to Cu(II). More strong evidence of the copper ligand changes was obtained by room temperature solution EPR spectroscopy. Cu(II) is EPR sensitive due to the fact that it is a 2/3 spin nucleus. The standard sample of Cu(BF4)2 salt shows a featureless paramagnetic EPR signal due to the ligand free of copper (Fig. 3), which can be simulated with g = 2.180 and splitting constant a = 45 G (Fig S5†). However, sample 12+ shows a well resolved isotropic 4 line EPR spectrum (Fig. 3). Simulation shows that it has a splitting constant of 75 G and a g-value of 2.053 (Fig. S5†), which is consistent with the stronger ligand field (introduced by the coordination of S4 to Cu2+) in 12+ than that of free Cu2+ salt. With the increase of the addition amount of TBP, it was found that the EPR signal gradually changed, as shown in Fig. 3 for a typical EPR spectrum after addition of 5 equivalents of TBP. This spectrum is due to the coordination of TBP to Cu(II), because it can be roughly simulated by assuming the superposition of Cu(II) (a = 72 G, g = 2.125) and TBP radicals (4N = 12.5 G and g = 2.048) (Fig. S5†). When the same 5 equivalents of DBP were added to 12+, there was no change of the EPR signal, indicating no significant change of the Cu(II) coordination environment. A similar ligand substitution phenomenon was also observed by Hupp and co-workers in their previous study.9 These results reflect that DBP is a suitable alternative to the most commonly used TBP. It could be envisaged that DBP may have a similar function to TBP in terms of the modification of the TiO2 surface,4,27 while not influencing the coordination stability of the Cu(II) complex bearing sulfur-coordinating ligands.
 Fig. 3  Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra (room temperature) of Cu(BF4)2 (50 mmol), 12+ (50 mmol), 12+ (50 mmol) with 5 eq. TBP and 12+ (50 mmol) with 5 eq. DBP. All of the samples were prepared in acetonitrile. 
In order to check whether these two redox mediators can effectively regenerate the oxidized dye Y123 (Fig. S6†), in particular for complex 12+/+ with a low driving force of only 160 mV (Fig. 2b), nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. For the inert electrolyte (0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 0.5 M DBP in acetonitrile), the decay of the absorbance signal, originating from the recombination between the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the oxidized dye molecule,16 gives a half-time (t1/2) of 17.04 μs. In the presence of 12+/+ and 22+/+, the decay of the signal is considerably accelerated, reflecting that the redox mediators regenerate the oxidized dye molecules. The regeneration half-times for 12+/+ and 22+/+ are determined to be 1.84 and 1.78 μs, respectively. The dye regeneration yield (φreg) can be calculated using eqn (1): (1)
 Fig. 4  Nanosecond laser transient absorption spectroscopy measurements of Y123 on mesoporous TiO2 with an inert electrolyte (0.1 M Li-TFSI and 0.5 M DBP in acetonitrile), and a 12+/+ or 22+/+ based electrolyte (0.1 M 1+ or 0.2 M 2+, 0.1 M Li-TFSI and 0.5 M DBP in acetonitrile). The excitation wavelength was 532 nm and probe wavelength was 720 nm. 
The φreg of the 12+/+ redox system is calculated to be 89%, which is analogous to the corresponding value of the 22+/+ redox system (90%), although 12+/+ has a smaller driving force of 160 mV with respect to 22+/+ (760 mV) as depicted in Fig. 2b. From the TAS results, one can infer that 12+/+ and 22+/+ redox systems can work efficiently in DSCs.
Two new electrolytes based on 12+/+ (E1) and 22+/+ (E2) redox mediators were further examined in DSCs, in conjunction with a high-absorption-coefficient organic sensitizer Y123 and a Pt counter electrode. Note that a lower concentration of 1+ (0.1 M) was used due to the low solubility of this complex in acetonitrile. Chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) (Fig. S7†) was applied in the electrolytes because of its effect on improving device performance,28 and DBP was employed to substitute TBP as aforementioned. The details of the solar cell fabrication are described in the Experimental section. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing DSCs based on E1 and E2 measured under illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) and in the dark are presented in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1.

Remarkably, DSCs constructed with E1 afford a considerably high Voc of 0.98 V, which is one of the highest Voc values reported so far for DSCs containing copper complex-based redox mediators. Some representative photovoltaic performances of DSCs consisting of copper complex-based electrolytes are summarized in Table S3.† By stark contrast, a much lower Voc of merely 0.56 V is found for devices with E2. As mentioned above, Voc is determined by the potential gap between the quasi-Fermi energy level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox mediator. Thus, the 420 mV gain in Voc for E1 should be largely due to its much more positive redox potential. The significant enhancement of Voc of DSCs containing E1 leads to a much improved overall PCE of 6.9%, which is more than double as compared to that of devices with E2 (2.9%). These results successfully demonstrate that fine-tuning the type of coordination atoms in the ligands of copper complexes is an effective strategy to positively shift the redox potential of the redox mediator, thus enhancing the Voc and ultimately the overall efficiency.
We further scrutinized the impact of DBP on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs based on complex 12+/+. The composition of electrolyte E3 is analogous to that of E1 but without DBP. The J–V curves of the devices based on E3 were measured and the data are shown in Fig. 5a and Table 1. As compared to E1, lower Voc (0.62 V) and short-circuit current density (Jsc = 7.6 mA cm−2) are observed, resulting in a rather low PCE of only 3.2% for devices with E3. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSCs based on these two redox electrolytes are shown in Fig. 5b. In contrast to E3, the device with E1 displays higher IPCE values over the entire region measured, yielding a maximum value of 85% at 520 nm. For both the electrolytes, the drop of IPCE values at 390 and 550 nm should be ascribed to the absorption of 12+ in these regions, which is competitive to the absorption of the sensitizer Y123 (Fig. S1†) and thus would lower the photocurrent density. The devices using TBP as an additive in the electrolyte (E3 with 0.5 M TBP) were also measured to compare the different effects of TBP and DBP, and the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S8.† The J–V curve of the device with TBP is abnormal with a low PCE of 2.0%, most likely due to the destruction of the structures of copper complexes by TBP as aforementioned.
Charge extraction measurements were performed to further explore the effect of DBP in DSCs as shown in Fig. 5c, which reveals that the presence of DBP in E1 results in an ∼150 mV conduction band (CB) shift of TiO2 towards more negative potentials. This observation is consistent with previous results regarding Lewis base additives, which can deprotonate the TiO2 surface and shift the CB edge of TiO2 negatively.24,29Fig. 5d shows the electron lifetime as a function of bias potentials derived from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. S9† and fitting results are summarized in Table S4.†30 Apparently, the electron lifetimes for E1 are dramatically higher (a factor of ∼20) than those of devices with E3. The CV curves of electrolytes E1 and E3 were also studied as shown in Fig. S10.† No significant difference is observed upon addition of DBP into the electrolyte. The Voc of DSCs is determined by the potential gap between the redox potential of the redox couple in the electrolyte and the quasi-Fermi energy level (EF,n) of TiO2, which is governed by the following two factors: (a) the position of the conduction band edge of TiO2 (CB), and (b) the number of electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 under open-circuit conditions.31 Therefore, the dramatic enhancement of Voc (360 mV) for devices with E1 mainly arises from the collective effect of negative shift of the CB of TiO2 and longer electron lifetimes.
For further improvement of the performance of the devices containing electrolyte E1, we additionally added CDCA to the dye solution. It has been reported that the presence of CDCA can suppress charge recombination between the electrons in the TiO2 and oxidized species in the electrolyte at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.32 As expected, the devices employing CDCA in the dye solution indeed show a much enhanced overall PCE of 8.4%, with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 11.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.72, as shown in Fig. S11† and Table 1. The EIS results (Fig. S12†) further demonstrate that the recombination resistances of the devices with CDCA in the dye solution are considerably larger, which indicates more effective retardation of the charge recombination losses in the presence of CDCA at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, linked to an improved charge-collection efficiency and thus photocurrent density. The devices using electrolyte E2 were also tested by addition of CDCA into the dye solution, which further improves the PCE from 2.9% to 3.7% as exhibited in Fig. S11† and Table 1. For comparison purposes, we also tested the performance of the state-of-the-art Cu(II/I) complexes Cu(tmby)2+/+TFSI2/1 (tmby = 4,4′,6,6′-tetramethyl-2,2′-bipyridine) with the same concentrations of the Cu species (0.1 M Cu(I) and 0.025 M Cu(II)) as E1. The best device based on Cu(tmby)2+/+TFSI2/1 shows a PCE of 8.7% (Fig. S11 and Table S5†), which is similar to that of the devices containing E1. The best device based on Cu(tmby)2+/+TFSI2/1 with the optimal conditions (0.2 M Cu(I) and 0.05 M Cu(II)) as reported gives an overall efficiency of 9.7% (Fig. S11 and Table S5†), which is on par with the value achieved previously (10.3%).10
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported the application of a new copper complexes 12+/+ bearing a tetradentate S4 ligand as a redox mediator in DSCs, and compared its intrinsic properties and photovoltaic performance with respect to the analogous N4 complexes 22+/+. The redox potential of the copper complexes was fine-tuned towards a more positive value by 600 mV through the substitution of coordination atoms of N with S. Remarkably, complexes 12+/+ were capable of regenerating the oxidized dye molecules as efficiently as its N4 counterpart 22+/+, with a high yield at a smaller driving force of 160 mV. As a consequence, a substantially high photovoltage approaching 1.0 V was achieved for devices containing complexes 12+/+, which is one of the highest values reported thus far for DSCs based on copper redox mediators. Specifically, DBP was identified as an effective additive for copper redox mediators with sulfur-coordinating ligands to enhance the performance while without destroying the coordination environment of copper complexes. The encouraging results presented in this work not only demonstrate that copper complexes featuring sulfur-coordinating ligands can be efficient redox mediators in DSCs, but also provide a fundamental strategy for further boosting the photovoltage and therefore the overall efficiency of DSCs. Future work will focus on molecular engineering of sulfur-coordinating ligands through the incorporation of conjugated moieties, with an aim to increase the solubility of copper complexes and simultaneously positively shift the redox potential to further reduce the dye regeneration overpotential in line with the previous successful example.19
