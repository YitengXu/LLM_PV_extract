    , Accepted 27th November 2013First published on 22nd January 2014AbstractZinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) derivatives with asymmetric (Zn-tri-PcNc-2) or symmetric (Zn-tetrad-Nc) structure, which possess wide spectral response in the visible/near-IR light region, are synthesized and utilized as a sensitizer of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with 0.5 wt% Pt-loading for photocatalytic H2 production. The experimental results indicate that Zn-tri-PcNc-2 exhibits much better photosensitization on g-C3N4 than Zn-tetrad-Nc under visible/near-IR light although Zn-tetrad-Nc possesses wider and stronger optical absorption property than Zn-tri-PcNc-2. Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibits an average H2 production rate of 132 μmol h−1, which is much better than that (26.1 μmol h−1) of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under visible-light (λ ≥ 500 nm) irradiation. Moreover, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 also shows much higher apparent quantum yield (AQY) than Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under red/near-IR light irradiation. Especially, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibits impressively higher AQY (1.07%) than that (0.22%) of the Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under 700 nm monochromatic light irradiation. The much better photoactivity of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 than Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 is caused by the asymmetric structure of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, which can result in the electronic orbital directionality of its excited state, much faster photogenerated electron transfer to g-C3N4, and higher red/near-IR light utilization efficiency as compared to Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4. The present results provide an important insight into the effects of molecular structure and optical absorption property of phthalocyanine derivatives on the photoactivity of the dye-sensitized semiconductor, and also guide us to further improve the solar energy conversion efficiency by optimizing the molecular structure and effectively utilizing the visible/near-IR light of sunlight.
Introduction
In the past decades, enormous efforts have been focused on artificial photosynthesis for H2 production over semiconductors, which could contribute to a sustainable energy supply and mitigate the increasing energy shortage due to its potential application in the direct production of clean hydrogen energy by using water and inexhaustible solar energy.1–4 Up till now, various semiconductors or their composite materials have been used as photocatalysts in order to solve the major problems (such as low visible-light utilization and quantum efficiency) of the promising but challenging technique.5–9 Recently, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) as a novel polymer semiconductor have attracted numerous attentions due to its specific planar structure, physicochemical property and appropriate energy band positions for photosplitting water.10–12 However, g-C3N4 still has a bandgap as large as 2.70 eV with an absorption edge just at ∼450 nm, which restricts the visible-light utilization. Although many efforts such as doping with a non-metallic element and co-polymerization of two or more precursors have been made to modify the physical and electronic structure of g-C3N4, the visible-light-responsive ability and photoactivity still need further improvement.13,14
Among the various strategies developed for visible-light harvesting, dye sensitization is an efficient method to extend the spectral response region of semiconductors.9,15 Typically, xanthene dyes (such as Eosin Y and Rhodamine B) and Ru-complexes are the most commonly used sensitizers in dye-sensitized semiconductors for H2 production.9,15–19 However, the above dyes usually just absorb the light shorter than 600 nm with a spectral response region centered at 450–550 nm. Moreover, Ru-complexes have relatively low molar extinction coefficients, which also influences the light utilization efficiency. Although Ru-complexes (especially N719) and TiO2 have governed the development of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in the past decades,20 recent breakthroughs in porphyrin and phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives as dyes of DSSCs made them become a strong challenger to the dominant Ru-complex dyes.21–24 This can be attributed to the intense absorption capability (with extremely high molar extinction coefficient) of porphyrin and Pc derivatives in UV/blue (Soret-band) and red/near-IR (Q-band) regions.15 Generally, Pcs can be combined with semiconductors to efficiently utilize the red/near-IR light of the solar radiation, but there have been few efforts focused on this purpose up until now.19,25 Recently, tin–porphyrin was used to sensitize TiO2 for photocatalytic H2 production, but its maximal absorption band is just centered at 550 nm.19 Moreover, magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc) was also used as a sensitizer of Pt/g-C3N4 for H2 evolution, however, it only showed rather low photoactivity and apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 0.07% at ∼660 nm.25 Therefore, the development of an efficient near-IR responsive catalyst is still a challenging topic.
More recently, a series of ZnPc derivatives have been synthesized and utilized as sensitizers in DSSCs with considerable photovoltaic conversion efficiency in our group,26 and a highly asymmetric ZnPc derivative (Zn-tri-PcNc) was also used to sensitize TiO2 for H2 production, which showed a considerable photoactivity and ca. 0.2% AQY at 700 nm monochromatic light.27 It is still too low to be satisfactory, and therefore further investigation is urgent for the Pc-sensitized system so as to more efficiently utilize the visible/near-IR light of sunlight.27 In order to further investigate the effects of the symmetry, the number and the position of carboxyl groups in ZnPcs on the photoactivity in terms of the electronic orbital directionality of the excited state dye, herein, a novel highly asymmetric ZnPc derivative (Zn-tri-PcNc-2) is designed and synthesized, and used as sensitizer of Pt/g-C3N4 so as to more efficiently utilize the visible/near-IR light of solar radiation. For comparison, a symmetric zinc naphthalocyanine (ZnNc) derivative (Zn-tetrad-Nc) with four peripheral carboxyl groups is also used as a dye of Pt/g-C3N4. Their molecular structures are shown in Scheme 1. Among those, Zn-tri-PcNc-2 have highly asymmetric tribenzonaphtho-condensed tetraazaporphyrine (PcNc) with two carboxyl groups at one naphtha-part position and electron releasing groups (tBu) at the other three benzo-condensed positions, which is different from the previously reported Zn-tri-PcNc containing only one carboxyl group at the naphtha-part.26,27 The above ZnPcs as a dye to sensitize Pt/g-C3N4 show broad light absorption from 500 to 850 nm with efficient visible/near-IR-light-induced H2 production. Moreover, the symmetry and the position of the carboxyl group in ZnPcs strongly influence the photoactivity in terms of the electronic orbital directionality of the excited state dye. The present results show the promising application of Pc derivatives in a photocatalytic system for more efficiently utilizing solar radiation with wavelength longer than 600 nm or even 700 nm, which has never been reached by those mostly used xanthenes and Ru-complexes.9

2. Materials preparation
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesized according to our previous report.28 Typically, 5 g urea was kept in a closed crucible and calcinated at 580 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and then the yellow-colored product was washed by nitric acid (0.1 M) and distilled water, and then dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain the product (g-C3N4). The above g-C3N4 (0.2 g) was dispersed in 40 mL water and 10 mL methanol in an ultrasonic bath, and then the suspension was irradiated by a 500 W high pressure Hg-lamp for 3 h under stirring after adding 0.067 mL H2PtCl6 solution (0.077 M). The product was separated by centrifugation and washed with water, and then dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain 0.5 wt% Pt-load g-C3N4 (Pt/g-C3N4).27,28
Zn-tri-PcNc-2 sensitized Pt/g-C3N4 (Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4) was prepared by an impregnation method. Typically, Pt/g-C3N4 (0.1 g) was mixed with 3 mL Zn-tri-PcNc-2 solution (0.17 mM) under stirring for 12 h and then the product was filtrated through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and dried at room temperature overnight. There was no signal of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 existence in the filtrate of the suspension after sensitization procedure; therefore the Zn-tri-PcNc-2 adsorbed amount on the catalyst is calculated to be 5 μmol g−1. Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 was prepared by the same method with the same dye adsorbed amount.
3. Materials characterization
The crystal phases of the sample were analyzed using a Bruker D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on a Kratos XSAM 800 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope equipped with Mg Kα radiation operated at 200 W. Liquid N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 at 77 K after the sample was degassed at 60 °C.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRPS) were obtained on FES 920 fluorescence spectro-photometer (Edinburgh Instruments) with excitation wavelength of 377 nm and detection wavelength of 707 nm for Zn-tri-PcNc-2 or 777 nm for Zn-tetrad-Nc. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were determined by Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectro-photometer. Transient photocurrent is investigated on CHI 618C electrochemical analyzer with three-electrode system, where Pt wire, Pt plate and Ag/AgCl as work, counter and reference electrode, respectively. And the electrodes are immersed into a suspension containing 10 mg g-C3N4, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 or Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4, 1.0 M NaOH and 5 mg methyl viologen (MV) as electron media, which was continuously purged by N2 to remove O2 before light irradiation.29,30
4. Photocatalytic property tests
The H2 production reaction was carried out in a typical photo-catalytic system.7,27 Typically, the photoreaction system contains 1 g L−1 catalyst in 10 mL water and 88 mg ascorbic acid (AA, 50 mM) as electron donor. Long-wavelength pass filter (λ ≥ 500 nm) or band pass filter (for example, λ = 700 ± 10 nm) are equipped on a 300 W Xe-lamp to get corresponding light irradiation. The dye turnover number (TON) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) are calculated according to the following equations:7,27 (1) (2)
Results and discussion
1. Absorption spectral property analyses
UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of g-C3N4, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, UV-vis absorption spectra of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc solution are also listed in Fig. 1. As can be seen from Table 1, both Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc show intense red/near-IR light absorption (Q-band) centered at 697 and 766 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, Zn-tetrad-Nc exhibits more efficient red/near-IR light absorption due to its higher molar extinction coefficient (104000 L mol−1 cm−1) and wider Q-band absorption as compared to Zn-tri-PcNc-2 with a molar extinction coefficient of 49500 L mol−1 cm−1. The above data indicate that Zn-tetrad-Nc possesses a wider and stronger optical absorption property than Zn-tri-PcNc-2. After adsorbing on Pt/g-C3N4, intense red/near-IR absorption band similar to the corresponding dye solution can also be observed. Moreover, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 show much broader red/near-IR light absorption from 500 to 850 nm than the pristine g-C3N4, which just absorbs light with wavelength shorter than 450 nm due to the rather large bandgap (∼2.70 eV). Simultaneously, the maximal absorption wavelengths of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibit about ∼10 nm red-shift as compared to Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc solution, which may be caused by their similar planar structures (Scheme 1) and the efficient interaction between Pc derivative and g-C3N4.

2. Crystal phase and microstructure analyses
To further investigate the interaction between ZnPcs and g-C3N4 and the effects of Pt-loading and ZnPc-sensitization on the crystal phase and microstructure of g-C3N4, the physicochemical characterizations of those products are conducted and shown in Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†). As can be seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†), the bare g-C3N4 shows two specific pronounced diffraction peaks of (100) and (002) planes at 2θ = ∼13° and ∼27° as reported in the previous literature,10,28 and the XRD patterns of those g-C3N4 with Pt-loading and ZnPc-sensitization show neither any peak position shift nor new peak appearance, which might be due to the low Pt- and ZnPcs-loading amount and their high dispersity on g-C3N4. Nevertheless, the existence of Pt element in those Pt-loaded g-C3N4 and its ZnPcs-sensitized products can be confirmed by the survey XPS spectra (Fig. S2a, ESI†), and the high resolution spectra (Fig. S2b, ESI†) of Pt show the binding energy peaks at ∼73.0 and 76.2 eV, which are almost equal to the Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 binding energy of Pt metal, suggesting Pt existing as a metallic form in the Pt/g-C3N4 and ZnPcs-sensitized products.28
Similar to the bare g-C3N4, those Pt-loaded g-C3N4 and its ZnPcs-sensitized products contain two strong C1s and N1s peaks of g-C3N4 as well as weak O1s peak at ∼533 eV, which could be ascribable to the adsorbed H2O or CO2 and C–O stemming from the incompletely reacted oxygen-containing intermediates during the synthetic process of g-C3N4.29 Since Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows no Zn binding energy peaks in the region of 1020–1050 eV, and the high resolution XPS spectra (Fig. S2b–d, ESI†) of Pt4f, O1s, C1s and N1s for those products with ZnPcs-loading are very similar to that of Pt/g-C3N4, it can be concluded that there is limited chemical interaction existing between those ZnPcs and g-C3N4, which may be difficult to be detected by XPS spectrum.
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curves shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) also indicate that the physicochemical properties of g-C3N4 are not significantly changed by the Pt-loading or ZnPc-sensitizations. As can be seen, all samples show type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis loops, which are associated with slit-shaped porous structures existing in the flake-like g-C3N4.28,29 Except for the pore volume slightly increasing from 0.28 cm3 g−1 to 0.34 cm3 g−1 after Pt-loading as shown in Table S1 (ESI†), which may be caused by the UV light irradiation and photoreduction procedure for Pt-loading, the surface areas and pore size distributions of g-C3N4 before and after Pt-loading and ZnPc-sensitization do not change obviously. The above results indicate the physicochemical properties of g-C3N4 are not significantly changed after Pt-loading and ZnPc-sensitization.
Since there are –COOH groups in the ZnPcs and terminal –NH groups in g-C3N4,28 it is possible that the formation of a chemical interaction between Zn-tri-PcNc and g-C3N4via a condensation reaction between the terminal –NH groups in g-C3N4 and –COOH groups in ZnPcs during the chemical adsorption process, just like the situation in the ZnPcs-sensitized TiO2. Nevertheless, π–π staking interaction between Zn-tri-PcNc and g-C3N4 may also exist in terms of their similar planar and π-conjugated structures. This conjecture may be validiated by the changes in the photophysical property of ZnPcs and g-C3N4 shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen, both Zn-tri-PcNc-1 and Zn-tetrad-Nc loaded on g-C3N4 show red-shift of ∼10 nm in Q-band absorption as compared to their respective solutions. It may be caused by the π–π staking interaction between the large conjugated structures of g-C3N4 and ZnPc. This interaction would lead to close interfacial connections between ZnPcs/g-C3N4, which may serve as a more efficient electron migration path to promote the charge separation, and induce a synergetic effect for an improved photoactivity as compared to the ZnPcs/TiO2.
3. Electrochemical property analyses
Usually, excellent optical absorption properties does not always mean efficient photoactivity since the relative energy band levels of the dyes and g-C3N4 are also an important influencing factor. Therefore, the electrochemical behavior of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc are investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, Eox) of dye can be obtained by the CV curves and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be calculated by E* = Eox − E0–0, where E0–0 (= 1240/λintersection) is obtained by the intersection point of the normalized absorption and emission spectra as shown in Fig. 2,7,31 and therefore E* (ELUMO) of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc can be estimated to be −1.29 and −1.20 eV as shown in Table 1, respectively. Those LUMO levels are sufficiently more negative than that (−1.12 eV) of g-C3N4.10,11,28 That is, it is favorable for the photogenerated electrons of the excited dye injection into the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 on aspect of thermodynamics.

4. Fluorescence spectra analyses
The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is an effective method to investigate the electron transfer behavior between dye and semiconductor.32–34 As shown in Fig. 3, Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc exhibit intense emission bands centered at around 707 nm and 777 nm, respectively. It indicates that the strong recombination process of the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs of the excited dyes. However, obvious quenching effect can be observed when Pt/g-C3N4 is added into the dye solutions, implying the rapid electron transfer from the excited dye molecules to CB of g-C3N4 since there is no overlap between the absorption spectrum of g-C3N4 and emission spectra of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc.35 Simultaneously, the quenching proportion [QP = (I0 − I)/I0] of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 is 95.3%, much higher than that (80.6%) of Zn-tetrad-Nc by adding Pt/g-C3N4. It indicates that Zn-tri-PcNc-2 has a more effective and rapid electron transfer to g-C3N4 as compared to Zn-tetrad-Nc. This phenomenon should be caused by the highly asymmetric structure of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, which possesses effective directionality of its electronic orbital in the excited state and is favorable for the electron transfer between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4.36

Time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRPS) is an efficient method to investigate the recombination rate of the photo-generated e−–h+ pairs, and the corresponding fluorescence lifetime (τ) represents the average existence time of excited dye molecules. The effects of Pt/g-C3N4 on the fluorescence lifetime of the excited Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and Zn-tetrad-Nc are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The fluorescence lifetimes of the systems are obtained by fitting the time-resolved fluorescence decay curves with the following exponential fitting equation. Fit = A + B1 × e−t/τ1 + B1 × e−t/τ2 + B1 × e−t/τ3(3)where A, B1, B2 and B3 are constants and obtained after fitted every decay curves.

As can be seen from Table 2, the fluorescence lifetime (τ) of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 is delayed from 3.68 ns to 6.26 ns, the lifetime enhancement is 70% when Pt/g-C3N4 is added, indicating that the photogenerated carrier recombination of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 is strongly restrained due to the efficient electron transfer from the excited Zn-tri-PcNc-2 to g-C3N4. Whereas the fluorescence lifetime enhancement of Zn-tetrad-Nc after adding Pt/g-C3N4 is only 17%, which is much smaller than that of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, indicating that the photo-generated electron transfer rate between Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4 is much slower than that between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4. Although the fluorescence lifetime (τ) of Zn-tetrad-Nc (5.79 ns) in solution is much longer than that (3.68 ns) of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, the electron transfer rate between Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4 is much slower than that between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4, as mentioned above, which should be attributed to the absence of directionality of the electronic orbital in the excited Zn-tetrad-Nc with symmetric structure.36
5. Photocatalytic H2 production activity analyses
Primary results show that there is no obvious H2 evolution when there is no dye, Pt loading or sacrificial reagent, and only slight H2 evolution is observed over Pt/g-C3N4 under visible-light (λ ≥ 500 nm) irradiation. The above results indicate that all components in the present dye-sensitized Pt/g-C3N4 photocatalytic system are indispensable. Generally speaking, the photoreaction condition can significantly affect the activity of the photocatalyst. For example, the existence of the co-catalyst (mostly Pt) can significantly promote the photoactivity,17,25,30,37 and Pt-loaded sites on the semiconductor (such as TiO2, g-C3N4) surfaces play an important role in trapping the CB electrons injected from the excited dye molecules for the H2 production. In the present system, almost no H2 production is observed over Zn-tri-PcNc-2/g-C3N4, but Pt-loading on g-C3N4 can markedly enhanced its photoactivity for the H2 production. Therefore, the present system adopts the photoreaction condition similar to our previous report by considering the similarity in the photocatalytic system.27
The comparison of H2 production for Pt/g-C3N4, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under λ ≥ 500 nm light irradiation is shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3. As can be seen, Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/g-C3N4 only show very limited H2 production amount under λ ≥ 500 nm light irradiation for 4 h. Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibits a linearly increasing H2 production amount with an average H2 production rate of 132 μmol h−1 and TON of 5279 h−1, while Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 shows an average H2 production rate of 26.1 μmol h−1 with TON of 1043 h−1. Furthermore, the average AQY (0.58%) of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 is much higher than that (0.11%) of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under λ ≥ 500 nm light irradiation. The above results indicate that the photoactivity of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 is much better than that of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 though the absorption property of Zn-tetrad-Nc is much better than that of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, as shown in Fig. 1. This indicates that an excellent absorption property is not sufficient for efficient photoactivity since the charge transfer rate and the energy band levels of dye and g-C3N4 should be considered in the present system.

As mentioned above, both Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibit intense red/near-IR absorption, therefore, their photoactivity under λ = 700 or 760 nm light irradiation are further investigated and listed in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 also show impressive photoactivity under the above monochromatic light irradiation. Especially, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 shows stable photoactivity with an average H2 production rate of 19.9 μmol h−1 during 10 h irradiation of 700 nm monochromatic light, which is the center wavelength of the Q-band absorption of Zn-tri-PcNc-2, while Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 just gives an average H2 production rate of 5.3 μmol h−1. Moreover, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 still exhibits much higher photoactivity with an average H2 production rate of 18.1 μmol h−1 than that (3.9 μmol h−1) of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 during 760 nm light irradiation for 10 h, which is the center wavelength of the Q-band of Zn-tetrad-Nc. That is, Zn-tri-PcNc-2 has better photosensitization on g-C3N4 than Zn-tetrad-Nc either at 700 or 760 nm light irradiation.
 Fig. 6  Photocatalytic H2 production of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under different monochromatic light irradiation. Conditions: 1 g L−1 catalyst in 10 mL water containing 50 mM AA, 0.5 wt% Pt and 5 μmol g−1 dye. 
There are some reasons for the better photoactivity of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 than Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4, although Zn-tetrad-Nc possesses a wider and stronger absorption property than Zn-tri-PcNc-2. On the one hand, the large difference in the photogenerated electron transfer rate between the two dyes and g-C3N4 should be the direct reason as mentioned above. As can be observed from Fig. 3 and 4, and the fluorescence lifetime (τ) enhancement (70%) of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 after adding Pt/g-C3N4 is much larger than that (17%) of Zn-tetrad-Nc, indicating that the electron transfer between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4 is more effective than that of Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4. On the other hand, the asymmetric structure of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 should be the intrinsic factor. Since the directionality of the electronic orbital in the excited dye molecules is one of the essential requirements in a Pc-sensitized system,36 and the asymmetric structure design of dyes is an effective and commonly used route to create the electronic orbital directionality of the excited dye, whereas the symmetric Zn-tetrad-Nc has no directionality of electron transfer channel in its excited state. Simultaneously, the slightly more negative LUMO level of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 (−1.29 eV) than Zn-tetrad-Nc (−1.20 eV) also implies the driving force for the electron transfer between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4 is larger than that between Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4. Therefore, it can be conjectured that the asymmetric structure of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and the effective and fast electron transfer from Zn-tri-PcNc-2 to g-C3N4 should be the main reasons for the better photoactivity of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 as compared to Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 although more near-IR light can be absorbed by Zn-tetrad-Nc due to its higher molar extinction coefficient and wider Q-band absorption than Zn-tri-PcNc-2. This standpoint can be further confirmed by the transient photocurrent behaviors of the dye-sensitized g-C3N4 suspension under λ ≥ 500 nm light irradiation as shown in Fig. 7. Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibit higher photocurrent value than g-C3N4 after light on, indicating the significant photosensitization of dye molecules adsorbed on g-C3N4. Simultaneously, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 shows higher photo-current than Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4, indicating the faster electron transfer between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4 than that between Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4, which is consistent with the above photoactivity, PL and TRPS analysis results.
 Fig. 7  Transient photocurrent curves of g-C3N4, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 in suspension system under visible-light (λ ≥ 500 nm) irradiation. 
6. Quantum yield and H2 production mechanism analyses
To further investigate the effects of incident light wavelength on the photoactivity and AQY of the dye-sensitized Pt/g-C3N4, the H2 production amount and AQY under various monochromatic light (λ = 635, 660, 685, 700, 735, 760, 785, or 800 ± 10 nm) are measured and shown in Fig. 8. Both dye-sensitized catalysts exhibit impressive AQY values when the monochromatic light changing from 635 to 800 nm, and the AQY curves in the red/near-IR region show a changing tendency similar to their respective Q-band absorption. Especially, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 shows 1.13% and 1.07% AQY values under 685 and 700 nm light irradiation, respectively. Although the AQY of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 are much lower than that of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4, it still gives impressive AQY values of 0.22% and 0.26% under 700 and 785 nm light irradiation, respectively. The above results indicate that the photoactivity in the red/near-IR region is governed by the dye molecules adsorbed on g-C3N4.
 Fig. 8  Effect of incident light wavelength on the AQY values of Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 and Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4. Condition: 1 g L−1 photocatalyst in 10 mL water containing 50 mM AA, 0.5 wt% Pt-loading and 5 μmol g−1 dye-adsorbed, monochromatic light λ = 635, 660, 685, 700, 735, 760, 785 or 800 ± 10 nm. 
Although the dye-sensitized system has been developed more than 20 years since Grätzel and co-workers' report,37 the spectral response region by those mostly used Ru-complex and xanthene dyes still focused on the region of 400–600 nm and almost never be extended to >600 nm,15 except that MgPc-sensitized C3N4 was reported to produce an AQY of ∼0.07% at 660 nm.25 Fortunately, the present Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 can more efficiently utilize the solar radiation with wavelength >700 nm, and shows an extremely high maximal AQY value of 1.13% under 685 nm light irradiation, which is much higher than that (∼0.07% at 660 nm) of the MgPc-sensitized C3N4.25 A similar highly asymmetric ZnPc derivative (Zn-tri-PcNc) was used to sensitize TiO2 in our previous literature,27 but the significance and positive effect of the present work is still tremendous. For example, the previous Zn-tri-PcNc-Pt/TiO2 only exhibited an AOY value of ∼0.2% at 700 nm monochromatic light, which is much lower than that (1.07% at 700 nm) of the present work. Simultaneously, the comparison of the two works also exhibits the symmetry, the number and position of carboxyl anchoring groups in ZnPcs strongly influence the photoactivity for H2 production in terms of the directionality of electronic orbital in the excited dyes. Although the present photoactivity is still lower than those commonly used dyes just responded in 400–550 nm, it shows the promising application of phthalocyanine derivatives in photocatalytic system for more efficiently utilizing the solar radiation with wavelength >700 nm, which has never been reached by those mostly used Ru-complex and xanthenes dyes.
Based on the above results and discussion, the proposed mechanism of the present system is shown in Fig. 9. Briefly, the dye molecules adsorbed on g-C3N4 are excited by visible/near-IR light, and the photogenerated electrons injected into the CB of g-C3N4, and then trapped by the Pt particles for further participating in H2 production reaction. Simultaneously, the oxidation state of dye molecules can be regenerated by accepted electron from sacrificial reagent for further cyclic utilization. On one hand, Zn-tri-PcNc-2 exhibits much better photosensitization on g-C3N4 under visible/near-IR light irradiation (λ ≥ 500 nm or λ = 700 or 760 ± 10 nm, and so on) than Zn-tetrad-Nc as shown in Fig. 5, 6 and 8. Moreover, Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 still exhibits lower photoactivity than Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 under 760 nm light though the Q-band absorption intensity at 760 nm of Zn-tetrad-Nc is much higher than that of Zn-tri-PcNc-2. As mentioned above, the photogenerated electron transfer rate between Zn-tri-PcNc-2 and g-C3N4 is much higher than that between Zn-tetrad-Nc and g-C3N4, which could result in better red/near-IR light utilization efficiency of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 than that of Zn-tetrad-Nc. More importantly, the electron injection directionality of the excited state Zn-tri-PcNc-2 caused by its asymmetric structure should be the intrinsic factor for its better photosensitization than the symmetric Zn-tetrad-Nc.

Conclusions
Visible/near-IR light region from 500 to 850 nm is successfully utilized for solar energy conversion in the form of artificial photosynthesis for H2 production based on phthalocyanine deriative-sensitized g-C3N4. The asymmetric structure of Zn-tri-PcNc-2 can result in the directionality of its electronic orbital in the excited state, more effcient photogenerated electron transfer from excited dye state to g-C3N4, and higher red/near-IR light utilization efficiency than the symmetric Zn-tetrad-Nc, and therefore Zn-tri-PcNc-2 exhibits better photosensitization effect for H2 production on g-C3N4 than Zn-tetrad-Nc under visible/near-IR light. Typically, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibits an average H2 production rate of 132 μmol h−1, much better than that (26.1 μmol h−1) of Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under visible-light (λ ≥ 500 nm) irradiation. Moreover, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 also shows much higher apparent quantum yield than Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under red/near-IR light irradiation. Especially, Zn-tri-PcNc-2-Pt/g-C3N4 exhibits impressively higher AQY (1.07%) than that (0.22%) of the Zn-tetrad-Nc-Pt/g-C3N4 under 700 nm monochromatic light irradiation. The present results shed light on further improving the solar energy conversion efficiency of the phthalocyanine derivative-sensitized semiconductor system by optimizing the molecular structure and effectively utilizing the visible/near-IR light of sunlight.
