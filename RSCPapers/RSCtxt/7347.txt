Furthermore, the new compounds were used as ligands in aluminium complexes and their photophysical properties were studied in detail both in solution and solid state by using absorption, steady-state, and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopies. Results show especially that the aluminium complex of 11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol has the most blue-shifted emission maximum among the Alq3 derivatives to date and CIE chromaticity coordinates locate on the deep blue area (0.16, 0.12). Moreover, the fluorescence quantum yield of this compound is 3.1–3.5 times higher compared with the parent Alq3. Photophysical properties of the complex did not show major differences between the solution and the solid states. The lack of melting endotherm in DSC analysis indicates that the compound is amorphous. Based on the results, 11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol has promising features to be applied as a ligand for aluminium or other metal ions in different applications.
1. Introduction

8-Hydroxyquinoline is a bidentate ligand, which forms complexes effectively with various metal ions. Tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium (Alq3) (Fig. 1) is a fluorescent octahedral complex compound, which was used as a combined electron transport and emitter layer in organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices for the first time by Tang and VanSlyke in 1987.1 Since that, the parent Alq3 has become a standard material in OLED devices. The parent Alq3 has also found an important role in the device architectures of organic solar cells. It has been used as an effective buffer layer to prohibit undesired cathode diffusion from a metal cathode to an organic layer and to increase the lifetime of devices by preventing penetration of oxygen and moisture.2 Moreover, doping of Alq3 in either the donor or acceptor layer has been observed to improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell performance by increasing e.g. the power conversion efficiency.3 The parent Alq3 has also been shown to work as a host material in an organic solar concentrator in which Alq3 provides a polar environment for a highly polar excited state of the dye molecule thus reducing concentration quenching.4

Theoretical studies have shown that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the parent Alq3 is located mainly on the pyridyl side of the organic ligand and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on the phenoxide side.5 This observation has been a key in the development of new derivatives with tailored photophysical properties. It has been experimentally shown that emission properties can be effectively and systematically tuned by substituting either the 4-position or the 5-position of the quinoline ring.6 In very recent studies, it has been shown that an amorphous tris-(4-piperidinyl-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium (Fig. 1) works as a superior emitting material in OLED devices and tris-(5-fluoro-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium can increase device efficiency considerably when it is used as an electron transport material in the Si-anode based OLED.7
Substituting a polymerizable unit to 8-hydroxyquinoline allows the incorporation of a Alq3 derivative into the polymer backbone and emission properties of that Alq3-functionalized polymer can be tuned by alternating the substituents in the 8-hydroxyquinoline ligand (Fig. 1).8Polymers with 8-hydroxyquinoline side chains can also complex boron in addition to aluminium.9 Such boron quinolate-functionalized copolymers have shown excellent emission properties and high electron mobilities.9b A slightly different approach utilizes poly(bromo-p-tert-butylphenylborylstyrene) to complex 8-hydroxyquinoline (Fig. 1) and its derivatives.10 This methodology allows tuning the chemical, physical, and photophysical properties simply by varying the chelating 8-hydroxyquinoline ligand.
Also other highly versatile application possibilities have increased researchers' interest to apply 8-hydroxyquinoline and develop synthetic methods to produce its new derivatives. Those applications cover for example near-infrared emitting tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)lanthanide-functionalized mesoporous silica materials as well as N,N′-bis((8-hydroxy-7-quinolinyl)methyl)-1,10-diaza-18-crown-6 ether (Fig. 1) and its substituted derivatives, which can be used as fluorescent chemosensors for different divalent metal ions such as magnesium.11 Experimental research including design and synthesis of new compounds is essential in order to obtain exact knowledge about luminescence and other photophysical properties of the compounds, because theoretical methods often give just rough estimations or trends.12
In this paper, we present a novel strategy to synthesize new tetracyclic 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives by using a Pd-catalyzed direct arylation in a key reaction step (Scheme 1). These new 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives were applied as ligands for aluminium and spectroscopic properties of the resulting Alq3 derivatives were studied in detail both in solution and solid state by using absorption, steady-state, and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Especially, tris-(11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol)aluminium showed interesting properties compared with the parent Alq3: three times higher photoluminescence quantum yield and deep blue emission with CIE (Commission internationale de l'éclairage) coordinates (0.16, 0.12). This is the most blue-shifted emission among the Alq3 derivatives so far and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data indicate that the complex is amorphous. These properties make the Alq3 derivative and the synthesized ligand itself especially interesting for different applications e.g. blue emission utilizing full-color display and lighting applications.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Syntheses

4-Chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline
1 (Scheme 2) was synthesized by using a previously reported method.13 On the first reaction step, the hydroxyl group was protected with the benzyl group by reacting compound 1 with benzyl bromide. 8-(Benzyloxy)-4-chloroquinoline 2 was collected in good yield (82%) after flash chromatography.
 Scheme 2  
Reagents and conditions: (a) (i) K2CO3 (2 equiv), DMF rt, 10 min; (ii) BnBr (1.1 equiv), rt, 18 h; (b) (i) 2-bromoaniline (10 equiv) 135 °C, 17 h; (ii) NaOH (aq) (3 equiv), acetone, reflux, 10 min; (iii) Pd(OAc) (5 mol%), PCy3-HBF4 (10 mol%), anhydrous K2CO3 (2.5 equiv), DMA 160 °C, 3 h; (c) Pd–C (10 wt%), H2, ethanol, reflux, 5 h; (d) (i) 2-bromo-N-methylbenzylamine (6.25 equiv) 135 °C, 17 h; (ii) HCl (aq); (iii) NaOH (aq) (2 equiv), reflux, 15 min; (iv) TsCl (1 equiv), acetone rt, 1 h; (e) Pd(OAc) (10 mol%), PCy3-HBF4 (20 mol%), anhydrous K2CO3 (2.5 equiv), DMA 160 °C, 4 h; (f) (i) NaOH (aq) (5 equiv), ethanol, reflux, 2½ h; (ii) HCl (aq). 
In the literature, Fisher indole synthesis and ligand free Pd-catalyzed arylation have been used to construct the 11H-indol[3,2-c]quinoline skeleton.14 Both methods gave the desired products in relatively low yields. Far more efficient method has been presented lately by Maes et al.15 In their method, intermolecular amination and intramolecular arylation are carried out by using auto-tandem catalysis and product yields varying from moderate to high (52–82%). Our synthetic protocol applies the solvent free amination reaction and Pd-catalyzed direct arylation method. Amination was performed by heating compound 2 in 2-bromoaniline for 17 h. Pd-catalyzed intramolecular direct arylation was done by using Pd(OAc)2 as a palladium source for the catalysis. Air stable tricyclohexylphosphine tetrafluoroborate (PCy3-HBF4) was used as a ligand and anhydrous K2CO3 as a base. The same catalyst system has successfully been used in various direct arylation reactions earlier by Fagnou et al.16 Reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis and it was observed that the use of 5 mol% catalyst loading of Pd(OAc)2 gave total conversion of the starting material within three hours.17 As a noteworthy observation, it must be mentioned that it was necessary to protect the 8-hydroxyl group before direct arylation reaction. Product formation could not be observed when direct arylation was tried right away after amination of compound 1. The tetracyclic quinoline derivative 4-benzyloxy-11H-indol[3,2-c]quinoline 3 was collected in high yield (93%). Pd catalyzed hydrogenolysis of compound 3 was carried out by using standard Pd–C (10 wt%) in ethanol under H2 atmosphere. The procedure gave the final ligand 4 in excellent yield (94%).
Compound 5 (Scheme 2) was prepared from compound 1 by performing solvent free amination and tosylation reactions consecutively. Compound 5 was collected as a pure product in moderate yield (50%). Direct arylation of compound 5 was accomplished by using 10 mol% of Pd catalyst and compound 6 was collected in 55% yield. Finally, detosylation of compound 6 gave the desired ligand 7 in high yield (84%) by using NaOH as a deprotection agent.

          4-Hydroxy-8-tosyloxyquinoline
          18,198 (Scheme 3) is readily available and can be used as a starting material in the synthesis of ligand 11. Alkylation of compound 8 in the presence of NaH and 2-bromobenzyl bromide gave product 9 in good yield (76%). Direct arylation of compound 9 was performed by using the same method as for compound 2. Tetracyclic quinoline derivative 10 was collected in good yield (87%). Deprotection of compound 10 with NaOH gave ligand 11 in quantitative yield (>99%).
 Scheme 3  
Reagents and conditions: (a) (i) NaH (1.7 equiv), DMF rt, 5 min; (ii) 2-bromobenzyl bromide (1.5 equiv), rt, 24 h; (b) Pd(OAc) (5 mol%), PCy3-HBF4 (10 mol%), anhydrous K2CO3 (2.5 equiv), DMA 160 °C, 3 h; (c) (i) NaOH (aq) (3 equiv), ethanol/acetone, reflux, 2½ h; (ii) HCl (aq). 
Complexes 12–14 (Fig. 2) were synthesized by using a previously reported method.6a New Alq3 derivatives were isolated in good to high yields (72–92%). 1H NMR spectra show that also the new derivatives exist as their meridional isomers similarly as the parent Alq3 in solution at room temperature.20

2.2 Photophysical properties in solution
Absorption and emission (photoluminescence) spectra in the steady state for the parent Alq3 and its derivatives (12–14) in solution are shown in Fig. 3. Because of different solubility properties between the prepared complexes, compound 12 was measured in ethanol and compounds 13 and 14 in chloroform. Reference solutions of the parent Alq3 were prepared in both solvents. Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) and corresponding amplitudes (A) were obtained by using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method. Measuring the decay curves at a wide range of wavelengths provides an alternative way to determine the ratio of emitted and absorbed photons (i.e. quantum yield) for each compound. τ was assumed to be constant at each monitoring wavelength and the amplitudes were obtained from the fittings of the decay curves at each wavelength and corrected according to the detectors wavelength sensitivity. The product of τ and the corresponding amplitude was summed throughout the measured range (ΣAτ), which gives the quantum yields referred to the parent Alq3. In the time resolved experiment, transmittance (T = 1 − 10−Abs.) was not equal for all the samples at the excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Thus, this was taken into account in calculations. Measured lifetimes (Table 1) for the parent Alq3 in CHCl3 and in ethanol are comparable with the values reported in the literature.21 Absolute data, which were used in the determination of relative quantum yields, are shown in the ESI† together with the decay curves, decay associated spectra and calculation procedures.

Generally, increased degree of conjugation causes the bathochromic effect.22 However, compounds 12–14 have blue-shifted absorption maxima (i.e. hypsochromic effect) and increased molar extinction coefficients (i.e. hyperchromic effect) compared with those of Alq3. The strong electron donating group (EDG) at the 4-position of the quinoline ring seems to have a major contribution to the absorption profile instead of the extended conjugation sphere caused by the attached phenyl ring at the 3-position.
Tris-(11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol)aluminium 12 has in ethanol 3.1–3.5 times higher fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) than the parent Alq3. Fluorescence lifetime (τ) is somewhat shorter compared to that with Alq3. By using the relative fluorescence quantum yields and measured fluorescence lifetimes in Table 1, one can calculate that the radiative rate constant for 12 is 3.5 times higher than that for Alq3. In addition, taking into account the absolute fluorescence quantum yield of Alq3 in ethanol (0.11621) the absolute fluorescence quantum yield for 12 is 0.35 and the radiative fluorescence rate constants are 1.3 × 107 s−1 and 4.6 × 107 s−1 for Alq3 and 12, respectively. Simultaneously with the increased radiative fluorescence rate the non-radiative rate constant of 12 (8.3 × 107 s−1) decreased compared with Alq3 (9.8 × 107 s−1).
In terms of CIE chromaticity coordinates (0.16, 0.12), compound 12 shows deep blue emission. To the best of our knowledge, the observed 77 nm blue-shift is the largest among the Alq3 derivatives so far.23 Previously, it has been theoretically predicted that attachment of EDG on the 4-position of the quinoline ring causes rise of LUMO level leading to a wider energy gap, and thus causing the blue-shifted emission.5 LUMO also has a notable coefficient at the 3-position.24 This can be the reason for the exceptionally high blue-shift of compound 12, in which a strong electron donating nitrogen part at the 4-position is also fully conjugated to the 3-position. On the other hand, electron donating nitrogen and oxygen parts at the 4-position in compounds 13 and 14 are isolated from the phenyl part attached on the 3-position, which can be considered as an electron neutral substituent in terms of Hammett substituent constants.25 Thus the phenyl part at the 3-position is likely to increase the conjugation of the quinoline ring, but does not shift electron density from the electron donating part at the 4-position in compounds 13 and 14.
For compound 13 in chloroform, the relative fluorescence quantum yields obtained both in the steady state and by the time-resolved method are much lower than the quantum yield of the parent Alq3. Fluorescence maximum was only slightly blue-shifted and fluorescence decay was two exponential with relative amplitudes of 0.15 and 0.85, and corresponding lifetimes of 9.7 ns and 1.8 ns, respectively. Obviously, a concomitant twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) occurs which would explain the observed second decay component.22 As was calculated for compound 12, the absolute fluorescence quantum yields and radiative fluorescence rate constants can be determined for 13. In chloroform, the absolute fluorescence quantum yield for 13 is 0.03 (0.22321 for the parent Alq3 in chloroform) and the radiative fluorescence rate constants are 1.3 × 107 s−1 and 1.0 × 107 s−1 for Alq3 and 13, respectively. The non-radiative fluorescence rate constant of 13 (3.2 × 108 s−1) increased notably compared with Alq3 (4.7 × 107 s−1).
Relative to the parent Alq3, emission maximum was blue-shifted 23 nm, but CIE coordinates (0.25, 0.41) are located still on the green area. Likely, the extended conjugation due to the phenyl ring is a reason for the observed blue-shift of compound 13 which is smaller than that of piperidinyl and 4-methyl piperazinyl substituted Alq3 derivatives.7a In the case of compound 14, emission maximum was blue-shifted 44 nm compared with the parent Alq3. The observed blue-shift is the same order of magnitude than those of tris-(4-alkoxy-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium complexes (Fig. 4) reported earlier.6a
 Fig. 4  The chemical structure of 4-alkoxy substituted Alq3 derivative, tris-(4-benzyloxy-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium.6a 
The relative fluorescence quantum yield for 14 is considerably higher compared with the parent Alq3 and its unfused analogue, tris-(4-benzyloxy-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium6a (Fig. 4). The absolute fluorescence quantum yield in chloroform for 14 is 0.32 and the radiative and non-radiative fluorescence rate constants are 2.8 × 107 s−1 and 5.8 × 107s−1, respectively. Increased fluorescence quantum yield can be related to the fused tetracyclic structure of new derivatives. The C–C bond between the aryl group and the quinoline ring increases the rigidity of molecular structures, which explains the increased Φ of compounds 12 and 14. Decreased Stokes' shifts of the fused derivatives can also be related to rigid molecular structures.26
2.3 Solid state properties
Solution processing is a highly desired method because it allows low-cost manufacturing techniques for organic electronic devices in the industrial scale. It has also become the current trend in organic light emitting diode and solar cell research.27 Thus, we demonstrated deposition of the thin films of Alq3 derivatives on the quartz substrate by using the spin coating technique. The first set of films was spin coated from a diluted solution (0.1 mM) and produced very weak absorption (Fig. 5a). Therefore, concentration was increased to 1 mM and another set of films was prepared. Reference film (9.5 nm) was made from the parent Alq3 by evaporating in high vacuum, because a spin coated film of the parent Alq3 showed neither detectable absorption nor emission. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2.

Emission band features were independent of the excitation wavelength.

For an unknown reason, the thin film of compound 12 had very weak absorption (Fig. 5a and c). However, emission measurements yielded clear signals (Fig. 5b and d) corresponding to the ones observed in solutions (Fig. 3b). Compound 13 in thin film was invisible in all fluorescence measurements, despite relatively high absorbance of the layer (Fig. 5c). Fluorescence lifetimes in the solid state, when excited at 340 nm, were resolved only for the parent Alq3 and compound 12. Decays were fitted with the two-exponential model. The appearance of the fast component can be attributed to solid state interaction between the molecules, which is not taking place in dilute solutions. The two components have very similar lifetimes than what has been reported in the literature for 3 μm thick crystalline film, although the pre-exponential amplitudes were different.21
In terms of CIE coordinates, it is interesting to note that emission of the parent Alq3 was shifted to the yellowish-green area while the solid state emission of compound 12 remained on the deep blue area. For compound 12, the peak width (FWHM) values of the thin films (Table 2) are close to the one obtained in solution (Table 1) whereas FWHM values of the parent Alq3 showed major difference between the two states. For compound 14, the solid state emission spectrum was clearly broadened compared with the solution state spectrum, which indicates increased interaction between the molecules.21

DSC analyses indicate that the synthesized Alq3 derivatives 12 and 13 are amorphous. The parent Alq3 showed a sharp melting endotherm at 417 °C, which is consistent with earlier studies,28 whereas a melting endotherm could not be detected for compounds 12 and 13 (Fig. 6). The parent Alq3 showed a glass transition temperature (Tg) at 162 °C, which is lower compared with earlier reported values. Compounds 12 and 14 showed slightly lower Tg values of 142 and 153 °C, respectively, relative to Alq3. Compound 14 showed also a sharp melting endotherm at 194 °C. Compound 13 can be considered thermally more stable than the parent Alq3, because of the lack of a melting endotherm and a higher Tg of 173 °C. Generally, amorphous materials have advantage over crystalline materials in various organic electronic applications because of their good processability, homogeneity, higher quantum efficiency in the solid state and capability to form uniform films.29

            DSC thermograms of the parent Alq3 and compounds 12 and 13. 
In general, spin coating is not a well-suited processing technique for the studied solutions, because the thickness and uniformity of the resulting films could not be accurately controlled by using this method. However, results show the potential of new derivatives to form thin films and if suitable a deposition procedure is selected from the other available solution-processing methods such as spray-on deposition, ink-jet or roll-to-roll printing, the quality of films may be controlled more precisely. Especially, due to the observed deep blue emission of compound 12, as well as the increased fluorescence quantum yield, one of the most likely application possibilities for that aluminium complex is to use it as a fluorescent dopant in OLEDs. The efficiency of the full-color OLED is highly dependent on the deepness of blue emission i.e. deeper blue (smaller value of yCIE coordinate) leads to decrease of power consumption in the device.30 Forrest et al. have shown that by using a fluorescent blue emitting dopant along with phosphorescent red and green dopants can considerably increase luminance efficiency in the white light OLED (WOLED) compared with the all-phosphor doped device.31 Very recently, it has been shown that blue fluorescent binaphthalene derivatives work efficiently as host and light emitting materials in OLEDs without problems faced by blue phosphorescent materials in OLEDs.30a Lately, it has also been shown that doping the parent Alq3 in an UV-emitting polymer matrix increases fluorescence efficiency of the parent Alq3 caused by resonance energy transfer from the polymer to the parent Alq3.32

3.3 Chemical characterization

1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured by using a Bruker Avance DPX200 instrument. High resolution mass spectra were measured by using a Micromass LCT device. Thermoanalyses were carried out by using a Mettler Toledo DSC821e apparatus equipped with a TSO800GC1 Gas Control system. The heating rate was 20 °C min−1 and the nitrogen flow 50 mL min−1. Melting points are reported from the peaks and the glass transition temperatures as on-set values from the third heating scan to 350 °C after rapid cooling to 25 °C.
3.4 Photophysical measurements
Compound 12 was soluble in ethanol and compounds 13 and 14 in chloroform. These were used as solvents in optical measurements to prevent possible concentration quenching. Reference solutions of the parent Alq3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) were prepared in both solvents. Concentrations were fixed in order to find a wavelength, where the absorbances of compounds 12–14 and that of the parent Alq3 reference were the same. Thus the fluorescence quantum yield, Φ, can be determined by comparing directly the number of emitted photons (i.e. signal intensity, I) throughout the measured spectrum (I ∝ Nabs ∝ 1 − T = 1 − 10−Abs.). The relative fluorescence quantum yield, Φ = 1.0, was given to the parent Alq3 and the fused Alq3 derivatives (compounds 12–14) were referenced to that. Sample solutions were kept in a 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette during the experiments. Absorption and emission spectra were measured by using standard spectrophotometers (Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis, Fluorolog Jobin Yvon-SPEX). In each fluorescence measurement, 90° configuration was used for detection.
Films were deposited onto 12 × 36 mm quartz plates by using a programmable spin-coater (WS-400B-6NPP/LITE, Laurell Technologies Corp., 10–10000 rpm). Concentrations of the solutions (compound 12 in ethanol and compounds 13 and 14 in chloroform) before casting were 0.1 mM and 1 mM in two distinct sets. The spinning speed was 2000 rpm and the time 1 min. Substrates were cleaned prior to deposition by sonicating 1 h in CHCl3 and 1 h in sulfochromic acid followed by rinsing with MilliQ water (Millipore, resistivity >18.0 MΩ cm) and drying in vacuum at 110 °C for 1 h. A test was made to deposit a film by using thermal evaporation in a high vacuum (Edwards AUTO 306). Compounds 12–14 were placed into a ceramic jar (5 mg) and the temperature was increased from 180 to 400 °C, but the layer growth was not observed. A thin film of the parent Alq3 (9.5 nm) was produced by using thermal evaporation in a high vacuum (2–3 × 10−6 mbar) at 200 °C. Additional N2 plasma treatment (Harrick, 10 min) was applied for the plates, onto which compound 12 was deposited in order to hydrophilize the surface. In fluorescence measurements, the plates were aligned to an angle (45–60°) with respect to the excitation, which yielded the maximum signal intensity.
Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) were obtained by using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system (Piqoquant GmBH) consisting of a Picoharp 300 controller and a PDL 800-B driver. Pulsed LED (340 nm, 2.5–10 MHz) was used for excitation and a microchannel plate photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R3809U-50) for detection in 90° configuration. Time resolution of a TCSPC measurement is about 300 ps estimated from the FWHM of the instrumental response at 340 nm. Decay associated spectra (DAS) were measured by accumulating the signal for 1 min at each monitoring wavelength (10 nm steps). Pre-exponential amplitudes (A) and corresponding lifetimes (τ) were obtained by using an ordinary exponential fitting procedure. Well-known models were used in the analysis.22 Equations and fluorescence decay data together with DAS are shown in the ESI†. Absolute absorption and emission spectra are shown in the ESI† together with the decay curves, decay associated spectra and calculation procedures.
4. Conclusion
Three new tetracyclic 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives were synthesized. Readily available 4-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline 1 and 4-hydroxy-8-tosyloxyquinoline 8 were applied as starting materials in the syntheses. Aminations were performed by using solvent free amination reactions. The hydroxyl group at the 8-position of the quinoline ring was protected with the tosyl or benzyl group prior to intramolecular direct arylation reactions. Direct arylation reactions were carried out efficiently by using Pd(OAc)2 as a palladium source and air stable PCy3-HBF4 as a ligand. Deprotection of the benzyl group or the tosyl group gave the desired ligands in good to quantitative yields. Finally, aluminium complexes were prepared from the synthesized ligands and the spectroscopic properties of the complexes were studied in detail both in solution and solid state.
All new tetracyclic Alq3 derivatives have blue-shifted absorption maximum and show increased molar extinction coefficients compared with the parent Alq3. A strong EDG on the 4-position of the quinoline ring seems to affect the absorption profile more than the extended conjugation sphere. Derivatives have also blue-shifted emission and decreased Stokes' shifts compared with the parent Alq3. Evidently, decreased Stokes' shifts are related to rigid tetracyclic structures. Especially interesting observation is that the aluminium complex of 11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol 12 has 3.1–3.5 times higher fluorescence quantum yield than the parent Alq3 and the most blue-shifted emission maximum among the Alq3 derivatives to date and CIE chromaticity coordinates locating on the deep blue area (0.16, 0.12). Moreover, spectroscopic properties of compound 12 did not show major differences between the solution and the solid states. Obviously in the case of tris-(5-methyl-5,6-dihydrodibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-1-ol)aluminium 13, charge transfer is taking place in the molecule which explains partly that only the small blue-shift of emission occurs and a consequent TICT state is likely to cause the observed second decay of fluorescence. Compound 13 also has dramatically decreased the fluorescence quantum yield compared with the parent Alq3. In addition, emission could not be detected in the solid state. Tris-(6H-isochromeno[4,3-c]quinolin-1-ol)aluminium 14 has similar blue-shifted absorption and emission like its unfused analogue tris-(4-benzyloxy-8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium6a but the fluorescence quantum yield is considerably higher which can be explained by the rigid fused structure of the ligands. Compound 14 shows pronounced emission broadening in the solid state, which is attributed to the crystalline nature of the compound in the solid state. DSC analyses indicate that compounds 12 and 13 are amorphous whereas compound 14 and the parent Alq3 have sharp melting endotherms. Based on the results, 11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-ol 4 has especially promising features to be applied as a ligand for aluminium or other metal ions in different applications.

The tosyl protective group was chosen to replace the benzyl protective group in the syntheses of ligands 7 and 11 because both benzylamine and benzyl ether structures do not last Pd catalyzed hydrogenolysis. (See: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, ed. T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley & Sons, New Jersey, 4th edn, 2007, pp. 102–818.) On the other hand, the tosyl group could not be used as a protective group in the synthesis of ligand 4 because 2-bromoaniline cleaved the protective tosyl group from 4-chloro-8-tosyloxyquinoline similarly as pyrrolidine has been previously observed to cleave the tosyl group (see ref. 13).
