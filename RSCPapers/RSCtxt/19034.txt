    , Accepted 14th September 2020First published on 22nd October 2020AbstractTuning the concentration and location of defects in semiconductors has been found to be effective in modifying their photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. Herein, we present the fabrication of Ta3N5 photoanodes with reduced surface defects through the nitridation of a two-step-flame-heating-derived Ta2O5 precursor (TSFH-Ta2O5). We found that by using TSFH-Ta2O5 instead of the one-step-flame-heating-derived Ta2O5 (OSFH-Ta2O5), the concentrations of low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta2O5 and the resulting Ta3N5 photoelectrodes are reduced. Moreover, we clarified that low valence Ta species on the Ta3N5 surface led to the formation of undesirable surface states, which induces severe Fermi level pinning and aggravates charge recombination. Therefore, TSFH-Ta3N5 delivered enhanced charge separation and injection efficiencies for PEC water oxidation reaction. A photocurrent density of 6.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was obtained on TSFH-Ta3N5 after loading a Co(OH)x cocatalyst, which is among the highest values reported for planar Ta3N5 photoanodes.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting on semiconductor-based photoelectrodes is an attractive approach for converting solar energy into storable hydrogen.1–3 Among the semiconductors investigated for PEC water splitting, tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has been considered to be a promising candidate for fabricating photoanodes due to its broad solar-light absorption ranging up to 600 nm,4 appropriate band-edge positions for both water reduction and oxidation reactions,5 and desirable diffusion length of holes.6 Up to now, different approaches have been developed to fabricate and optimize Ta3N5 photoanodes and a record-high photocurrent density of 12.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under air mass (AM) 1.5 illumination has been achieved. However, there is still a huge gap between the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency actually achieved and the theoretical value due to the inefficient charge separation/transport and (or) charge injection processes, defining the imperative of further optimization.7–10
Generally, Ta3N5 photoanodes that exhibit excellent PEC performance are prepared by nitriding preformed tantalum oxide precursor films on Ta foil.7,11–15 As the physicochemical properties of oxide precursor films could affect the PEC performance of the resulting Ta3N5 photoanodes,7,11–14,16 considerable efforts have been devoted to modifying the physicochemical properties of the oxide precursor films with strategies like structural engineering, defect engineering, and interface engineering.7,12–15,17–19 Among all these strategies, the rational modulation of oxygen vacancy (low valence Ta species) in the oxide precursor film shows great potential.12,13,16,20 For example, Schmuki et al. prepared an efficient Ta3N5 photoanode by using partially reduced Ta2O5 film as a precursor and found that the low valence Ta species between the Ta3N5 nanotube and Ta substrate can improve the charge separation efficiency and consequently the PEC performance.13 Domen et al. showed that a tantalum oxide precursor (TaOδ) with appropriate oxygen concentration was preferable for transformation into a Ta3N5 film with high conductivity, which is vital for obtaining high-performance Ta3N5 photoanodes.12 In our recent work, we presented the fabrication of Ta3N5 photoanodes through the nitridation of Ta2O5 precursor film prepared by rapid and scalable one-step-flame-heating (OSFH) of Ta foil.19 We also noted that the distribution and concentration of oxygen vacancies in photoelectrodes like WO3 can be rationally tuned by employing a two-step-flame-heating (TSFH) method instead of the OSFH method.21 Therefore, we anticipate that if the Ta2O5 precursor film is prepared with a TSFH method, the oxygen vacancy (low valence Ta species) in this precursor film could be modified, which will tune the charge separation/transport and (or) charge injection on the resulting Ta3N5 photoanodes. Moreover, clarifying the pivotal roles of oxygen vacancy (low valence Ta species) in Ta3N5 photoanodes is important towards obtaining more efficient Ta3N5 photoanodes, which has not been realized.
Herein, we employed a rapid TSFH strategy to synthesize Ta2O5 precursor film on a Ta substrate towards the fabrication of a Ta3N5 photoanode. We found that in comparison with the OSFH process, the TSFH process can effectively reduce the density of low valence Ta species on the surfaces of the Ta2O5 precursor film and the resulting Ta3N5 photoelectrodes. Moreover, we clarified for the first time that the undesirable surface states stemming from the low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta3N5 aggravate charge recombination and lead to a severe Fermi level pinning effect. Therefore, the Ta3N5 photoanode prepared from the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor exhibited drastically enhanced charge separation/transport and charge injection efficiencies, and a photocurrent density of 3.55 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is obtained, which is ca. 5.5 times that obtained on a Ta3N5 photoanode prepared from the OSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor. Moreover, after loading of Co(OH)x as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, the photocurrent density was further increased to 6.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is among the highest values reported for planar Ta3N5 photoanodes.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of Ta3N5 photoelectrodes
A two-step approach (shown in Scheme 1) was employed to prepare Ta3N5 photoelectrodes. In the first step, either an OSFH method19 or a TSFH method was applied to the synthesis of Ta2O5 precursor film. The as-obtained Ta2O5 precursor film was then converted to a Ta3N5 photoanode through nitridation in the second step. Typically, Ta foil (15 × 20 mm2, 0.127 mm thick, 99.95%, Alfa Aesar) was heated in an H2–O2 flame (1273 K) for different durations and the resulting OSFH-derived Ta2O5 electrode is denoted as Ta2O5-X, where X corresponds to the flame heating duration in seconds. After Ta2O5-X was allowed to cool down in air naturally, a second flame heating treatment was applied. The resulting TSFH-derived Ta2O5 electrode was denoted as Ta2O5-X-Y, where X and Y correspond to the flame heating durations in seconds for the first and second flame heating treatments, respectively. The OSFH- or TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor electrodes were finally subjected to nitridation in flowing NH3 (125 ml min−1) at 1123 K for 15 h. The resulting Ta3N5 photoelectrodes prepared from Ta2O5-X were denoted as Ta3N5-X and those prepared from Ta2O5-X-Y were denoted as Ta3N5-X-Y.

2.2. Loading of the Co(OH)x cocatalyst
The Co(OH)x cocatalyst was loaded on Ta3N5 photoanodes via the impregnation method as we reported previously.19 The electrode was immersed into a mixed solution containing 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M CoSO4 for 15 min and finally rinsed with DI water.
2.3. Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Rigaku D/Max-2500/PC powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (operating voltage: 40 kV, operating current: 200 mA, scan rate: 5° min−1). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization experiments were performed using a Quanta 200 FEG SEM equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with monochromatized Al Kα excitation (15 kV, 10.8 mA). All the bonding energies were corrected with reference to the C 1s (284.6 eV) signal. The UV Raman spectra were obtained using a home-assembled Raman spectrograph (Jobin-Yvon T64000 triple-stage spectrograph with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1). The visible Raman analysis was performed on a home-made triple-stage spectrograph using three Princeton Instrument SP 2300 image spectrometers with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The single-frequency UV laser line at 360 nm and a visible laser at 532 nm (both from Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. China) were employed as the excitation source with an output of 30 mW and the power of the laser at the sample was measured to be 3.0 mW. The light absorption properties of the photoanodes were investigated using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550) equipped with an integrating sphere. The surface potential (CPD) and surface photovoltage (SPV) were measured using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) (Bruker Dimension Icon) under ambient conditions in the AM-KPFM mode. A Bruker SCM-PIT probe was used for the KPFM scan and the lift height of the probe was set at 20 nm during the KPFM scan. A 300 W xenon-arc lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) equipped with a monochromator was used to excite the samples and to obtain the SPV signals. The monochromatic light, together with tunable wavelength, was used to obtain SPV spectra, and the 500 nm monochromatic light was used to obtain SPVM images. The SPVM images were mapped by continuously mapping the surface potential images in the dark and under illumination. The difference between the surface potential images obtained in illuminated and dark KPFM scans at the same location was extracted as a SPVM image.
2.4. (Photo)electrochemical measurements
Unless otherwise specified, all the (photo)electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode H-type cell with a quartz window using an Ivium electrochemical workstation. The Ta3N5 photoanodes, a platinum electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The PEC performance of the Ta3N5 photoanodes was evaluated in 1.0 M NaOH (pH = 13.6) aqueous solution under AM 1.5G illumination (Newport Sol 3A, Class AAA Solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 from −0.6 to 0.5 V vs. SCE. The irradiation area of the photoanodes was defined with silicone as shown in Fig. S1.† The irradiation area is kept at ca. 0.25 cm2. The schematic setup for the PEC measurements is shown in Fig. S2.†
Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were obtained at a DC potential range with an AC potential frequency of 1 kHz under dark conditions on a PARSTAT MC-1000 workstation (Princeton Applied Research) at room temperature.
Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurements were performed on an Ivium workstation at the potential range of −0.2–1.5 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination at room temperature. The AC potential frequency range was set from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz.
All measured potentials vs. SCE were converted to potentials vs. RHE using the Nernst equation as follows: E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.059 × pH + 0.241(1)
3. Results and discussion
3.1. PEC performances of the Ta3N5 photoelectrodes
Ta3N5-X-Y photoanodes were obtained by nitriding the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor film (Ta2O5-X-Y) as illustrated in Scheme 1. For comparison, Ta3N5-X photoanodes were prepared from the OSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor film as reported previously by us.19 As Ta3N5-15-15 was found to deliver the best PEC performance among all the Ta3N5-X-Y photoanodes in our work (Fig. S3†), Ta3N5-15-15 was mainly investigated in the following studies. The PEC performance of the Ta3N5 photoanodes was evaluated in 1.0 M NaOH solution (pH = 13.6) under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) in a three-electrode system with the Ta3N5 photoanode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and platinum foil as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a, bare Ta3N5-30 delivers a photocurrent density of 0.65 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is comparable with the values reported for Ta3N5 photoanodes.11,13,19,22 Under similar conditions, bare Ta3N5-15-15 achieved a photocurrent density of 3.55 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is ca. 5.5 times that obtained on Ta3N5-30. By loading Co(OH)x as the oxygen evolution cocatalyst, the photocurrent density on Ta3N5-15-15 can be further increased to 6.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a saturated photocurrent density of 8.0 mA cm−2 can be obtained at ca. 1.4 V vs. RHE (Fig. 1b). A maximum half-cell solar-to-hydrogen (HC-STH) energy conversion efficiency of 1.12% was achieved at 0.95 V vs. RHE.

(b) The PEC performance and the corresponding half-cell solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of the Co(OH)x/Ta3N5-15-15 photoanode under chopped light illumination. (c) The charge separation efficiency and (d) charge injection efficiency of the Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 photoanodes. The efficiencies are calculated based upon the photocurrent density difference in the presence and absence of H2O2. 
To unveil the intrinsic factors for the drastically enhanced PEC performance obtained on Ta3N5-15-15 photoanodes, the Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30 photoanodes were then systematically investigated. Generally three factors including the efficiencies of light absorption, charge separation, and charge injection contribute to the PEC performance of a photoelectrode. As both Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30 photoanodes are Ta3N5 photoanodes prepared via the flame heating approach with the same total flame heating duration of 30 s, the light absorption of Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30 photoanodes should be similar. Therefore, the differences in charge separation and/or charge injection were suggested to be the main reason for the different PEC performances observed on Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30.
We then employed H2O2 as the hole scavenger to probe the charge separation and injection efficiencies. As shown in Fig. 1c, the charge separation efficiency of Ta3N5-30 increases gradually with the applied potential from 0.8 to 1.23 V vs. RHE and reaches the highest value of 33% at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Compared with Ta3N5-30, Ta3N5-15-15 delivers a drastically increased charge separation efficiency in the whole potential range, and a maximum value of 73% at 1.23 V vs. RHE is obtained. In terms of the charge injection efficiency (Fig. 1d), it increases from 4.1% to 12.5% with the increase of the applied potential from 0.8 to 1.23 V vs. RHE on Ta3N5-30. As for Ta3N5-15-15, the charge injection efficiency increases from 9% to 33%. Therefore, the significantly improved PEC performance on Ta3N5-15-15 photoanodes in comparison with that on Ta3N5-30 is ascribed to the simultaneously accelerated charge separation and charge injection processes.
To further understand the charge separation process in the Ta3N5 photoanodes, the in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technique was employed to measure the surface photovoltage (SPV) of the Ta3N5 photoanodes. In principle, positive SPV signals correspond to the accumulation of photogenerated holes on the surface under light irradiation. We first mapped the steady-state SPV distributions by using surface photovoltage microscopy (SPVM) (Fig. 2a and b).23,24 The SPVM images indicate that the concentration of holes on the Ta3N5-15-15 surface is higher than that on the Ta3N5-30 surface, which is in line with the statistical SPV mean values of Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30 (Fig. 2c). These results indicate that photogenerated holes in Ta3N5-15-15 are prone to transfer to the surface compared to those in Ta3N5-30. Surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) of the two photoanodes (Fig. 2d) indicate that the surface holes originate from super-bandgap excitation and Ta3N5-15-15 has a higher concentration of surface holes than Ta3N5-30 throughout the spectral range. Moreover, the surface potential of Ta3N5-15-15 is 120 mV lower than that of Ta3N5-30 (Fig. 2e), suggesting a larger upward band bending for Ta3N5-15-15. Based on the above characterization results, we can conclude that more efficient transfer of photogenerated holes to the surface will occur on Ta3N5-15-15 than on Ta3N5-30, which is the main reason for the drastically enhanced PEC activity observed on Ta3N5-15-15.

3.2. Physicochemical properties of the Ta3N5 photoelectrodes
To clarify the underlying reasons for the improved charge separation and injection efficiencies observed on Ta3N5-15-15, the physicochemical properties of both Ta3N5-15-15 and Ta3N5-30 were then analysed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was first conducted to characterize the morphologies of the Ta3N5 photoanodes. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, both Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 exhibit a flat film composed of intimately connected particles. Visible Raman spectra of the Ta3N5 photoanodes were then obtained using a 785 nm laser. Due to the low extinction coefficient at a wavelength of 785 nm, the collected signal provides abundant information on the bulk phase of Ta3N5. As shown in Fig. 3c, both Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 show well-defined Raman bands at around 269.3, 402.8, 497.5, 524.0, 601.5, 747.4, 868.0, and 897.8 cm−1, which can be readily assigned to the orthorhombic Ta3N5 with space group Cmcm.25,26 This indicates the successful preparation of the target Ta3N5 photoanodes on the Ta substrate from both Ta2O5-30 and Ta2O5-15-15. To further analyse the phase compositions of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15, XRD measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 3d, Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 show a number of diffraction peaks that can again be well indexed to the orthorhombic Ta3N5 (PDF# 79-1533). In addition, XRD peaks indexed to Ta4N5 (PDF# 75-0627) and TaN0.8 (PDF# 25-1279) are also observed on both Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15. These tantalum nitrides with low valence states were reported to exist as the interlayer between Ta3N5 and Ta.19 Therefore, based upon the above analysis, the physicochemical properties in the bulk phase of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 are found to be similar.

After investigating the bulk phase of the Ta3N5 photoanodes, we then turned to investigate the physicochemical properties of the Ta3N5 photoanodes on the surface. As 532 nm light can be strongly absorbed by Ta3N5, Raman spectroscopy using a 532 nm laser can be employed to acquire information on the surfaces of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15. As shown in Fig. S4,† the Raman bands assigned to Ta3N5 are weak and broad for Ta3N5-30, which should be ascribed to the poor crystallinity of Ta3N5 on the surface.7 However, the Raman bands of Ta3N5-15-15 are much stronger, indicating the improved crystallinity.
To further investigate the chemical nature of the Ta3N5 surface, XPS analysis was conducted. As shown in Fig. 3e and f, the Ta 4f5/2, Ta 4f7/2, and N 1s peaks of Ta3N5-15-15 are centred at 26.9, 25.0, and 396.4 eV, respectively, which are consistent with those for Ta3N5.27 However, a negative shift of ca. 0.1–0.2 eV is observed on the Ta 4f peaks of Ta3N5-30 when compared with Ta3N5-15-15, indicating the lower valence state of Ta species (Ta4+, Ta3+, etc.) on the surface of Ta3N5-30. Therefore, the poor crystallinity of the Ta3N5 surface should be due to the formation of Ta species with lower oxidation states, consistent with previous reports.7,28 Hence, we can conclude that by employing the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 as the precursor, the density of low valence Ta species on the surface of the resulting Ta3N5-15-15 photoanodes is decreased.
Previous studies indicated that the presence of defects including low valence Ta species, N vacancy, and O impurity can affect the band positions and therefore the PEC performance of the Ta3N5 photoanode.29,30 Hence, we sought to determine the band positions of the as-prepared Ta3N5 photoanodes. Fig. 4a shows the XPS valence band spectra of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15, which exhibit the typical valence band density-of-states characteristics of Ta3N5.31,32 The valence band maximum (VBM) of both Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 is estimated to be ca. 1.78 eV vs. the Fermi level according to the intersections in the spectra. This value is in good agreement with the reported values for Ta3N5 obtained by different techniques like ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA).5,22 Considering that the band gap of Ta3N5 is ca. 2.1 eV,5 the conduction band minimum (CBM) of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 is located at ca. −0.32 eV vs. the Fermi level (Fig. 4a). Mott–Schottky plots were then obtained to investigate the flat-band potential (Efb) within a testing potential window from −0.2 to 1.2 V vs. RHE.33 As shown in Fig. 4b, Ta3N5-30 shows two apparent flat-band potentials with the first Efb value being −0.08 V vs. RHE and the second one being 0.48 V vs. RHE. As for Ta3N5-15-15, the first flat-band potential is almost identical to that of Ta3N5-30, which is consistent with the typically reported flat-band potential for Ta3N5.5 Moreover, Ta3N5-15-15 exhibits a second flat-band potential of ca. 0.29 V vs. RHE when the applied potential is higher than 0.8 V vs. RHE. The phenomenon that a semiconductor shows two flat-band potentials in a potential region indicates the Fermi level pinning effects due to the surface states of Ta3N5 as described by Morrison et al.34,35 As the shift of the flat-band potential (Efb2 − Efb1) is related to the charging of the surface states,36 the negatively shifted potential of the second flat-band for Ta3N5-15-15 indicates that the density of surface states located at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is reduced on Ta3N5-15-15 when compared with Ta3N5-30. Noting that Ta3N5-15-15 possesses an obviously reduced density of low valence Ta species on the surface compared to Ta3N5-30, it is reasonable to suggest that those reduced surface states on Ta3N5-15-15 should originate from the low valence Ta species on the surface of the Ta3N5 photoanodes.

The inset shows the relative band positions of Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15. (b) Mott–Schottky plots of Ta3N5-30 (blue squares) and Ta3N5-15-15 (yellow circles). 
To reveal the effects of these Ta-related surface states on the PEC performance of Ta3N5 photoanodes, photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurement, which is an effective technique to analyze the interfacial charge transfer processes on photoelectrodes,36 was performed on Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of the Ta3N5-30 photoanode acquired at applied potentials of −0.2–1.5 V vs. RHE under illumination (AM 1.5G). At all potentials, two arcs are observed in each curve. Similarly, the Bode phase plots (Fig. 5b) show two main peaks centred at around 0.54–8 and 104–160 Hz under all potentials. Therefore, there are at least two time constants, or in other words, two charge transfer processes, in the PEC water oxidation. Similar spectra have been widely reported on oxide-based photoanodes like hematite,36–39 where the low frequency arc is generally assigned to the charge transfer of holes from the surface states into the electrolyte. However, as for Ta3N5, although similar spectra were observed, the contribution of surface states to the spectra is generally overlooked.40–42 It has been reported that the surface states could function not only as the charge recombination centres but also as the active sites to transfer holes into the electrolyte.36,43 However, it is difficult to distinguish which role dominates. Therefore, two equivalent circuits, proposed by Bisquert,36 which are approximations of the situation where either the first or the second role dominates, were employed for PEIS fitting (Fig. S5a and b†). According to the fitting results shown in Fig. S6,† it is more reasonable to conclude that the holes injected into the electrolyte are mainly from the valence band of Ta3N5 and the dominating role of surface states is the charge recombination centre instead of active site. Therefore, the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S5a† was used to derive the equivalent circuit parameters which will be discussed below. As for the PEIS data obtained on Ta3N5-15-15 at potentials higher than 0.9 V vs. RHE, which displays only one time constant, the classic Randles circuit (Fig. S5c†) is employed for the simulation.

The total resistance values, Rtot (Rtot = Rs + Rct,bulk or Rtot = Rs + Rct), obtained by PEIS fitting are plotted in comparison with the differential resistance (dV/dJ) calculated from the LSV curves in Fig. S7.† As shown in Fig. S5d,† these two resistance values match well with each other, confirming that the fitted parameters for Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 are reasonable. Moreover, Rs is constant and much smaller compared with Rtrapping, Rct,bulk, and Rct. This indicates good ohmic contact between the Ta3N5 film and the substrate for both Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15.19,44
The values of equivalent circuit parameters (CPE1-T, CPE2-T, Rtrapping, and Rct,bulk) extracted from PEIS fitting are shown in Fig. 6. Rct,bulk shows a valley corresponding to the peak observed in CPE1-T, indicating that the water oxidation is triggered by the accumulated photogenerated holes in the space charge layer. The photocurrent onset agrees well with the increase in CPE1-T and the decrease in Rct,bulk, which further confirm that the holes are transferred from the valence band into the electrolyte (Fig. S7†). Moreover, in comparison with Ta3N5-30, Ta3N5-15-15 shows reduced values for CPE2-T and Rct,bulk and an increased value for CPE1-T at the potential range of 0.2–1.2 V vs. RHE. With CPE2-T, the energetic distribution of the density of the surface states, g(EFn) or DOS, can be calculated using the equation36,45 CPE2-T(E) = qg(EFn)(2)

The as-obtained DOS curves of surface states for Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 are shown in Fig. 7. Ta3N5-30 exhibits at least two peaks with the first one centered before 0.2 V vs. RHE and second at 0.49 V vs. RHE. As for Ta3N5-15-15, the DOS for both peaks was obviously reduced and the DOS at potentials higher than 1.2 V vs. RHE was removed completely. In addition, the distribution of the second peak in the DOS curve of Ta3N5-15-15 is very different from that of Ta3N5-30 and the second peak shifted negatively to 0.30 V vs. RHE. Therefore, by applying the two-step strategy in the flame heating process, the DOS of surface states on Ta3N5 can be effectively modified. Considering the different surface structures between Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15, it is reasonable to suggest that these modified DOSs of surface states should be related to the low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta3N5 photoanodes. As the capacity of the surface states is included in the capacity of Helmholtz capacitance, the potentials applied on the Helmholtz layer and space charge layer would be varied when the DOS of the surface states is tuned. In other words, the decrease in CPE2-T due to the reduced DOS of surface states would lead to a higher potential applied on the space charge layer. As a result, in comparison with Ta3N5-30, a decreased charge recombination and an increased charge separation efficiency (Fig. 1c) could be obtained on Ta3N5-15-15, which lead to increased numbers of holes arriving/accumulating at the surface (increase in CPE1-T and SPV values). Moreover, the higher potential applied on the space charge layer would generate more band bending on Ta3N5-15-15 in comparison with Ta3N5-30. Consequently, Ta3N5-15-15 shows a lower value of Rct,bulk than Ta3N5-30, which explains the higher charge injection efficiency on Ta3N5-15-15 in comparison with Ta3N5-30. As a result, Ta3N5-15-15 shows much higher photocurrent density than Ta3N5-30.

3.3. Reasons for the reduced density of surface states on the Ta3N5 photoanode prepared from TSFH-derived Ta2O5
After establishing that the significantly improved PEC performance of Ta3N5-15-15 in comparison with Ta3N5-30 is ascribed to the reduced density of surface states that are related to the low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta3N5 photoanodes, we turned to investigate why the low valence Ta species can be decreased on Ta3N5-15-15. It has been reported that both the nitridation conditions and the physicochemical properties of the Ta2O5 precursor could affect the physicochemical properties of Ta3N5.12,13,19,46 During nitridation, low valence Ta species can be produced when the nitrogen vacancies and/or oxygen impurity are generated in Ta3N5, which has been confirmed theoretically and experimentally.7,28,29 Moreover, the low oxidation state of Ta in the precursor would lead to the preferable formation of low valence Ta species in Ta3N5.12 In our case, as the nitridation conditions for Ta3N5-30 and Ta3N5-15-15 are identical, it is reasonable to infer that the reduced amount of low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta3N5-15-15 in comparison with Ta3N5-30 should be related to the different physicochemical properties of the oxide precursor electrodes. Therefore, the physicochemical properties of the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor were then investigated in comparison with those of OSFH-derived Ta2O5.
XRD patterns and UV Raman spectra were first acquired to investigate the crystallinity and phase compositions of the Ta2O5 precursors. As shown in Fig. 8a, the diffraction peaks of both Ta2O5-30 and Ta2O5-15-15 exhibit similar intensity and can be readily indexed to Ta2O5 (PDF# 79-1375) and Ta (PDF# 89-5158), indicating that Ta2O5 can be formed on the Ta substrate with both OSFH and TSFH methods. Moreover, the negligible difference observed for the UV Raman spectra of Ta2O5-30 and Ta2O5-15-15 further confirmed their similar phase composition and crystallinity (Fig. 8b). SEM images (Fig. S8†) indicate that Ta2O5-30 and Ta2O5-15-15 films possess similar morphology and thickness (ca. 2.7 μm). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the physicochemical properties in the bulk of Ta2O5-30 and Ta2O5-15-15 precursor electrodes are similar.

XPS measurements were then performed to probe the chemical nature of the Ta2O5 surface. As shown in Fig. 8c and d, the Ta 4f5/2, Ta 4f7/2, and O 1s peaks of Ta2O5-15-15 are centred at 27.8, 25.9, and 530.1 eV, respectively, which is similar to those for Ta2O5.13 As for Ta2O5-30, the Ta 4f peaks shift negatively by ca. 0.15 eV in comparison with those of Ta2O5-15-15, indicating that high concentrations of Ta species with lower oxidation states are present on the surface (Ta4+, Ta3+, etc.).13 It has been reported that the low valence Ta species are generated together with the oxygen vacancy in tantalum pentoxide due to the charge balance.47 Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Ta2O5 film prepared via the TSFH approach possessed a much lower oxygen vacancy density on the surface than that prepared via the OSFH approach. This is similar to our recent report that oxygen vacancy density on the surface of TSFH-derived WO3 is much lower than that on OSFH-derived WO3. As the valence states of Ta species on the surface of the Ta3N5 photoanode are strongly related to those present in the Ta2O5 precursor,12,13 the density of low valence Ta species on the surfaces of Ta3N5 electrodes can be significantly reduced by employing the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor. Therefore, due to the suppressed formation of undesirable surface states originating from low valence Ta species, Ta3N5 prepared from the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor exhibited substantially improved PEC performance.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we presented the fabrication of an efficient Ta3N5 photoanode through the nitridation of a TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor. By employing the TSFH process instead of the OSFH process, the densities of low valence Ta species on the surfaces of the Ta2O5 precursor and the resulting Ta3N5 electrodes can be significantly reduced. We further clarified that low valence Ta species on the surface of Ta3N5 function as charge recombination centers and lead to a severe Fermi level pinning effect. Therefore, due to the suppressed formation of undesirable surface states originating from low valence Ta species, Ta3N5 prepared from the TSFH-derived Ta2O5 precursor exhibited drastically enhanced charge separation and injection efficiencies, and a high photocurrent density of 3.55 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is achieved. Furthermore, by loading Co(OH)x as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, the photocurrent density on the Ta3N5 photoanode was increased to 6.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is among the highest values reported for planar Ta3N5 photoanodes. These findings clarified the pivotal influence of low valence Ta species on the PEC performance of Ta3N5 photoanodes, which can be used as a reference to guide the preparation of more efficient photoelectrodes.
