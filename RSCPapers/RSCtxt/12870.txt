    First published on 7th April 2009AbstractThe collection and conversion of light energy into chemical energy is based on the use of molecular structures of various complexity, where the absorbed light energy is first converted into an excited state able to undergo energy or electron transfer processes and finally it is stored in a charge separated state as chemical (electrochemical) potential. A bio-mimetic approach has seen tetrapyrroles number among the most common components of these arrays. This tutorial review reports on the use of relatively new tetrapyrroles, corroles, in this field. A brief presentation of the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the corrole units relevant to the application is presented together with a discussion on the photo- and thermal stability issues, followed by an overview of the activity and improvements in the preparation of photo-active molecular arrays containing corroles.

1. Introduction
Corroles are aromatic tetrapyrrolic macrocycles bearing a direct pyrrole–pyrrole link. Since their discovery in 1964 they have attracted considerable attention, however the lack of efficient procedures for their synthesis hampered the development for 30 years.1 Only after the discovery of a one-pot procedure for the synthesis of meso-substituted corroles in 1999 did these contracted, aromatic macrocycles become more accessible.2,3 Further improvements allowed the optimization of the synthetic procedures and the obtainment of virtually any substitution patterns in corroles.4,5 In less than a decade this macrocycle and related metal complexes attracted the interest of several research groups and the number of published papers, which is now close to 400, can testify to the vigorous activity. Corroles have been studied for applications in several fields, a recent exhaustive review illustrates the potential applications.6 These macrocycles and the related metals complexes were applied in oxidation catalysis (Fe, Mn, Cr), reduction catalysis (Cr, Mn, Fe), group transfer catalysis (Rh, Fe), sensors (Co), dye-sensitized solar cells (Ga, Sn) and medicinal applications (free bases, Ga).6 Among others, investigation of metallocorroles as catalysts for the decomposition of peroxynitrites by Gross and co-workers seems to have great potential.6
Photophysical and photochemical investigations on corroles were rather scarce and have progressed only in the past few years, although some applications were directly related to the photophysical properties (in particular luminescence) of these compounds, as in pH sensing and in medicinal use. A systematic photophysical study of free-base corroles by our groups and by others allowed to point out some analogies, but also several superior properties with respect to porphyrins.7,8 These investigations, together with parallel electrochemical studies,9 put the basis for the use of free-base corroles as photo- and electro-active building blocks in the construction of photo-functional arrays. The structurally similar porphyrins, due to their excellent properties and availability, have constituted for several decades the most used components of arrays for light energy collection and conversion. However, the need to improve the performances and increase the variety of such molecular systems encouraged the use of other porphyrinoids. Among those, corroles had some success, since they possess the right properties, namely intense light absorption throughout the visible spectral range, singlet excited state lifetimes in the nanosecond range, high luminescence yields and high radiative rate constants, strong absorption features of the excited states, good photostability in most solvents and relative ease of oxidation. The past few years have witnessed several examples of multi-partite arrays based mostly on the best characterized free-base corroles and to a lesser extent also on their metal complexes. Herein, we would like to present, together with the relevant basic properties of corroles, the most significant cases of corrole-based multichromophoric arrays able to display the ability to collect and/or transfer light energy, to convert it via photoinduced electron transfer step(s) and to store it as charge separation. These systems are important for light energy conversion applications and for the production of photo-responsive molecular structures.
2. Corroles
Before 1999, the most efficient synthetic method in corrole chemistry was cyclization of biladienes,1 but recently it has been replaced with the one-pot synthesis of meso-substituted A3-corroles.2–5 Currently the most popular synthetic approaches are: (i) direct condensation of pyrrole with aldehydes leading to bilanes which undergo oxidative macrocyclization induced by p-chloranil (2,3,5,6-tetrachlorobenzoquinone) or DDQ (2,3-dicyano-4,5-dichlorobenzoquinone) and (ii) condensation of dipyrranes with aldehydes.4 Furthermore, desired bilanes can also be prepared via different approaches like condensation of dipyrrane-diols with pyrrole. Typical overall yields grew from modest 10% to 30–35% within the past decade and many simple corroles can now be prepared without the need for chromatographic separation. Most of the strategies are compatible with a large variety of substituents.
Only a few data on spectroscopic/photophysical properties are available for metalated corroles, whereas free-base corroles have been studied more extensively from the photophysical point of view. Spectroscopic features of corroles are similar to those of porphyrin with a Soret-type band at 400–420 nm (ε ca. 120000 for free-base and higher for metalated) and Q-type bands around 500–650 nm (ε ca. 10000/20000 in free base and about 20000/40000 in metalated corroles). Due to the lower symmetry of the corrole structure the Soret band can be split and Q bands have more complex patterns as compared to the corresponding porphyrins.7,8,10–13 It is worth mentioning that, whereas the molar absorption coefficients of corroles in the Soret band are much lower, the Q-bands have overall higher absorption coefficients than that of the corresponding porphyrins. This may be an advantage in the collection of natural sun-light, richer in the less energetic frequencies around 500–700 nm. The luminescence spectrum displays two vibronic bands, but the second one can be barely detectable in uncorrected spectra due to the low sensitivity of most detectors in the NIR region, and the luminescence lifetime is of the order of a few nanoseconds. Table 1 collects the photophysical properties of selected meso-substituted corroles which represent most of the photophysical characterizations to date. Early reports on free-base corroles reported a lower emission yield,10,14 but the most recent determinations agree in assigning corrole a luminescence yield higher than that of the corresponding porphyrins.7,8 In a few cases, the absorption spectra of both singlet and triplet excited states of free-base corroles have been reported and the lifetimes determined. Lifetimes for triplet states are in the usual range of 10−5–10−4 seconds. A representative example of a singlet and triplet excited state spectrum is reported for corrole 2 together with the low energy region of the ground state absorption and the normalized fluorescence, Fig. 1.7 Both singlet and triplet excited states of corroles react with oxygen, very likely leading to superoxide (O2−) and to singlet oxygen (1Δg), respectively.7Sensitization of singlet oxygen by corroles has an efficiency comparable to that of porphyrin. No phosphorescence from free-base corroles in 77 K rigid matrices was detected in the NIR region in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran14 and periodated or perbrominated solvents,7 which are known to strongly enhance intersystem crossing. However a very recent account reported the observation of a phosphorescence band peaking at 818 nm from a derivative of 3 in a 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass at 77 K.15 This band locates the energy level of the triplet excited state at ca. 1.5 eV, similar to that of the corresponding free-base porphyrin.

 Fig. 1  Ground state absorption (dot), fluorescence (dash), and singlet excited state absorption spectrum (line) of corrole 2 in toluene. In the inset, the time evolution of the triplet excited state spectrum is displayed. 
A recently performed comprehensive study on the electrochemistry of free-base meso-substituted corroles gave an in-depth picture of the mechanism for their oxidation and reduction.9 Depending on the specific pattern of the substituents, the first oxidation potential of corroles in benzonitrile lies in the range 0.38–0.86 V (vs.SCE). The one-electron oxidation of (Cor)H3 is irreversible and initially gives [(˙Cor)H3]+ but this strong acid rapidly loses a proton or reacts with another neutral (˙Cor)H3 molecule to generate (˙Cor)H2 and [(Cor)H4]+. The first reduction of (Cor)H3 (−1.02/−1.36) V vs.SCE) is also irreversible and directly or indirectly involves one of the protons on the macrocycle leading to [(Cor)H2]−. The irreversibility of the first oxidation and reduction processes is not per se a limitation for the use of these chromophores as electro-active units in photo-active arrays since the time scale of the photoinduced processes is faster and reduced and oxidized forms may be regarded as stable products on the time scale of photoinduced events. It should be stressed that meso-substituted corroles combine easy oxidation with relatively easy reduction, consequently they have great potential as active components in arrays.
As far as metalated corroles are concerned, we will only mention those of interest from the point of view of potential photophysical applications (Cu, Co, Mn, Cr, Ir, Ga and Sn). In general, multistep oxidation and reduction are observed and these processes are typically reversible. Spectroelectrochemical data reveal that the first reductions are metal centered. On the other hand the nature of the first and second oxidation processes varies from metal to metal. Below we compare electrochemical data for metals of interest focusing, for the sake of comparison, on two corrole ligands, namely: 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (tpfc) and 5,15-dimesityl-10-phenylcorrole (dimes). The data, in dichloromethane if not otherwise specified, reported as (ligand, first oxidation potential, first reduction potential vs.SCE), are as follows: CuIII (tpfc, +0.96 V, +0.17 V, PhCN),16CoIII (tpfc, +0.74 V, +0.13 V, PhCN),17MnIII (dimes, +0.45 V, −1.36 V, PhCN),18CrVO (tpfc, +1.19 V, +0.06 V),19IrIII (tpfc, +0.66 V, no reduction),20GaIII (tpfc, +0.75 V, no data)11 and SnIVCl (tpfc, +1.20 V, −0.94 V).21
Photo and thermal stability of corroles has long been debated and, as can be guessed, it is of great importance for the foreseen applications. If the free-base corrole is substituted at the 10-meso position by an aryl group, a photocatalyzed ring opening often occurs in the presence of oxygen leading to the corresponding biliverdin species.14,22 Guilard and co-workers suggested that the cleavage of the direct C–C bond occurs via formation of a dioxetane intermediate. An olive-green side-product is usually observed during the synthesis and purification of meso-substituted corroles. Since its formation from corrole is reversible, it was proposed that it might possess a radical-cation type structure.4 Very recently the first example of an autoconversion of a free-base trans-A2B-corrole into its AB2C-porphyrin analogue at room temperature was reported by Guilard and co-workers.23 Our detailed investigation proved that meso-substituted free-base corroles are stable in toluene solutions.7 Only in 1, exposure to high-power laser pulses induces substantial spectral changes presumably associated with one of the processes outlined above. Photolability is enhanced in polar solvents: in benzonitrile all probed free-base corroles (1–3) displayed degradation upon high-power laser irradiation though low power light was essentially ineffectual on 3. Overall, corroles bearing at least two electron-withdrawing substituents, in particular 3, are very stable in toluene and dichloromethane and this encouraged the use of this type of corrole in the construction of arrays. Metalated corroles are expected to be more stable than free-base ones with the notable exception of nickel corrolates which basically do not exist; however systematic reports on this issue are lacking. Though it can be summarized that corroles are, in general, less stable than porphyrins, the stability of dyads and more complex arrays turned out to be, according to our observations, better than that of the corresponding component corrole.
3. Photoactive arrays
Once the spectroscopic, electrochemical and photophysical properties of the corrole chromophores have been determined and their photo- and thermal-stability has been assessed, these chromophores emerge as potentially promising components for the construction of photoactive functional arrays. As for most of the presently used components in similar structures, the potentiality of corroles depends on their aptitude to display within the arrays either efficient energy or electron transfer processes triggered by light absorption. In the design of photoactive arrays, free-base corroles can play the role of energy acceptors more easily than that of energy donors, due to their relatively low excited state energy level (ca. 2 eV). In addition, they have been employed as electron donors rather than electron acceptors, due to the relative ease of oxidation of their macrocycle, from +0.5 V up to +0.9 V vs. SCE, depending on the substitution pattern. The role of metal corroles is more diversified and depends on the nature of the metal.
3.1 Miscellaneous systems
The first studies on photoinduced processes on dyads containing corroles, either a metal–metal bonded Rh(III) porphyrin and Sn(IV) corrole 7, or a meso bridged dyad containing a free-base porphyrin and a free-base corrole 8, demonstrated the stability problems of these compounds (Chart 1). In the former case, reported by Harvey and Guilard, experiments were conducted at 77 K in glass in order to prevent a photoinduced homolytic bond cleavage.24 In the case of 8, exposure to light at room temperature led to significant spectroscopic changes due to the corrole ring opening and formation of a porphyrin–biliverdin dyad. This instability prevented a detailed photophysical study of the system.14
 Chart 1 
The absorption spectrum of dyad 7 in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran at 77 K showed good additive properties with respect to the model components indicating a modest electronic interaction between the units in spite of the close spacing between components, 3.4 Å. The Sn corrole model component displayed luminescence bands at 565 nm, assigned to the fluorescence from the singlet, and at ca. 740 nm, assigned to phosphorescence from the triplet excited state. In agreement with the presence of a heavy ion, no fluorescence was detected from the Rh porphyrin but only phosphorescence peaking at ca. 730 nm. Dyad 7 was essentially non-luminescent, only a very weak emission identified as the Rh porphyrin phosphorescence with a shorter lifetime than that of the model could be detected. Reduction in the porphyrin lifetime is assigned to energy transfer to the corrole unit via the metal–metal bond with a rate in the range 106–108 s−1. However, evidence for the formation of the triplet localized on the Sn corrole, the lowest state of the system, which should appear as a phosphorescence at 740 nm, is lacking. This process is thermodynamically favored and it is surprising that no sensitization of the triplet state is noticed in the dyad. A reasonable explanation put forward by the authors is an enhanced intersystem crossing of the triplet excited state localized on the Sn corrole to the ground state, induced by the heavy Rh(III) ion.24
The same groups report also on a few cofacial dyads containing Zn porphyrins and mesityl substituted free-base corroles connected at the meso position by bridges of different rigidity, 9–11 (Chart 1).25 This was part of a comprehensive study of singlet–singlet energy transfer within chromophores in cofacial porphyrin-like dyads.26 Energy transfer from the zinc porphyrin excited singlet state (energy ca. 2.2 eV) to the free-base corrole unit (energy of the singlet excited state ca. 1.9 eV) was detected at room temperature. The rate was in the order of 109 s−1, much lower than that measured for similar systems containing a zinc porphyrin as the energy acceptor. According to the authors, the presence of bulky mesityl substituents at the meso position of the corroles hampers a close approach of the cofacial partners, slowing down the through space (Förster) energy transfer processes.27
In the same year, Liu and Sun reported a photo-active dyad 12 composed of a Cu(III) corrole and Ru(II) trisbipyridine, Ru(bpy)32+, connected by an amide bond (Chart 1).28 Excitation in the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band of the ruthenium complex in the dyad led to a nearly complete quenching (99%) of the typical luminescence of the complex. The determination of redox potentials evidenced the thermodynamic feasibility of several electron transfer paths upon excitation of the Ru complex, in fact the authors identified an electron transfer from the corrole to a photogenerated Ru(bpy)33+ as a possible reason for the excited state deactivation.
In the same period, a report from our laboratories was published, dealing with a room temperature perfectly stable free-base porphyrin–free-base corrole dyad 13 connected at the meso position by an amide linkage, Fig. 2.29 Though the absorption spectra of the two tetrapyrrole components were extensively overlapping, it was possible to excite either one of the chromophores at selected wavelengths, at 570 nm (corrole) and at 515 nm (porphyrin). The luminescence of the sample excited on the two different components yielded an identical luminescence spectrum, displaying a common lifetime of 6.3 ns, intermediate between that of the porphyrin (9.9 ns) and that of the corrole (3.9 ns). Only in a very narrow wavelength range, around 600–620 nm, where the emission comes only from the corrole, a lifetime of ca. 400 ps could be detected. The interpretation was that of a rapid set up of an equilibrium between the two emitting states. This was confirmed by the luminescence of the dyad in a rigid glass at 77 K: irradiation of the two units led to different spectra depending on the unit predominantly excited, and the emission was characterized by a double exponential decay with lifetimes corresponding to that of the model components. The energy levels of the excited singlet state of the component units are very similar, of the order of 1.9 eV, justifying our interpretation of equilibration at room temperature between the populations of the two excited states. Deactivation occurs through the shorter lived corrole but the porphyrin excited state acts as a reservoir of energy, extending the lifetime of the emitter, see Fig. 2. In the case of a system in equilibrium, the observed rate constants are combinations of those of the individual steps and in this case a complete kinetic analysis of the system was provided.29 The energy transfer rate from corrole excited singlet to porphyrin and the reverse energy transfer from porphyrin to corrole resulted in good agreement with the energy transfer rates calculated according to a Förster mechanism.27 This can be considered the first extended and complete study of photoinduced processes occurring in a corrole-based dyad at ambient temperature.

3.2 
          Corrole–aromatic imide arrays
The former study on the corrole–porphyrin dyad gave us full control over the synthetic strategies, the experimental methods and the conceptual frame for the study of these arrays. Therefore, we designed a series of dyads where, on paper, both energy and electron transfer could occur. This was done by connecting the corrole to a high energy chromophore, which also displayed a moderate ability to be reduced, 1,8-naphthalimide. Three different free-base corroles were selected, characterized by different oxidation potentials, in order to create systems displaying essentially the same driving force for energy transfer from the accessory chromophores to the corrole, but increasing driving force for electron transfer from the corrole to the chromophores. Two series with bridges of slightly different length were synthesized but the properties were essentially unaltered, thus only one set of compounds (14–16) is discussed here, Chart 2.30 Upon selective excitation of the corrole unit in the dyads there is no change in the luminescence compared to the pertinent model corrole, i.e. no photoinduced process takes place. Upon excitation into the higher excited state of the naphthalimide unit in the dyads at 350 nm (absorption by naphthalene imide is 50%), its luminescence is completely quenched but the corrole fluorescence is sensitized. The sensitization occurs however to different extents, depending on the redox ability of the corrole unit. Corrole 16 which can be more easily oxidized displays a very poor sensitization, ca. 15%, which increases to ca. 65% in corrole 15 and is 100% in corrole 14. This can be explained by a competitive energy/electron transfer deactivation of the excited state of the 1,8-naphthalimide as outlined in the energy level diagram in Fig. 3. In this are shown the excited state energy levels derived from the pertinent luminescence band maxima at 77 K and the energy levels of the charge separated states, derived from the redox potentials after conventional corrections. The overall quenching rates of the donor excited state are above 1011 s−1 but their nature is dictated by the increasing driving force of electron transfer from the HOMO of the corrole to the HOMO of the naphthalimide, which is partially filled in the excited state. Electron transfer is unable to compete in 14 with the faster energy transfer leading to sensitization of the corrole unit, which is therefore 100% efficient; in 15 there is a competition between the two processes (respectively 65% energy, 35% electron transfer) and in 16electron transfer prevails and is 85% efficient.

The above dyads display a rich photoreactivity, but the charge separated state (CS) following electron transfer from corrole to naphthalimide, C+-NI−, could not be characterized because of the poor spectroscopic properties. NI− has, in fact, a band at 400 nm, out of the accessible spectral range, and C+ has only a broad band with low epsilon around 700 nm, where other intermediates absorb. In order to overcome this problem and to have the possibility of studying charge separation and subsequent recombination, we synthesized and examined the dyads depicted in Chart 3, consisting of a perylene bisimide (PI) unit and a corrole unit.31 The dyads 17 and 18 differ with the use of different corroles, the former is a sterically-hindered chloro derivative with a lower oxidation potential compared to the 5,15-bis(pentafluorophenyl) derivative used in 18. Compounds 18 and 19 have the same components, but differ in the length of the bridge connecting the electron donor and acceptor, a phenyl and a biphenyl respectively. This couples to a different extent the two units and therefore affects the intramolecular reactivity. Perylene bisimide is an excellent oxidant (reduction potential is −0.52 V vs.SCE) and its reduced form has extremely intense and characteristic spectral features in the NIR spectral region, it is therefore very suitable to study charge separation. Selective excitation of the corrole units in the dyads at wavelength > 560 nm indicate a high quenching, ca. 95%, for dyads 17 and 18 compared to the pertinent model, but a much lower quenching, ca. 15%, for dyad 19. Nearly selective excitation of the perylene bisimide at 490 nm in the dyads leads to a complete quenching of this unit and a luminescence yield for the corrole which is decreased to about 20% of that of the reference corrole in 17 and 18, whereas it is sensitized by a factor of ca. four in dyad 19. The luminescence lifetime of perylene bisimide is reduced to τ≤ 10 ps for all dyads, whereas that of the corrole units is 40 ps (compared to the model lifetime of 1.7 ns) for 17 and 190 ps and 3.2 ns (compared to the model lifetime of 3.8 ns) for 18 and 19, respectively. The excitation spectra measured on the corrole emission indicate that energy transfer takes place in all dyads from the perylene bisimide to the corrole unit, but to a different extent. The fact that corrole emission, in spite of an energy transfer by the perylene bisimide excited state, appears quenched is due to an electron transfer process which depletes the state. This is confirmed by the detection of the charge separated state, C+-PI−, characterized by the typical bands of the reduced perylene bisimide anion PI− in the NIR in the three dyads.31 The formation of this state occurs in a fast step, ≤10 ps, ascribed to a HOMO–HOMO electron transfer from the corrole to the excited perylene bisimide, and in a slower one, with lifetimes coincident with that measured for corrole luminescence decay, ascribed to a LUMO–LUMO electron transfer from the excited corrole to the perylene bisimide. Charge separated states recombine to the ground state with lifetimes of 0.5 ns for 17, 2.5 ns for 18 and a noteworthy 24 ns for 19. However charge separation is rather inefficient in the latter compound and the yield is 50% for excitation in the perylene bisimide unit and only 15% for excitation in the corrole band, while both 17 and 18 display a ca. 100% efficiency of charge separation. For 19 this is the consequence of unfavorable thermodynamics, see Fig. 4, and a lower electronic coupling due to the longer bridge.

In order to improve the performance of the array, we decided to incorporate a further functionality. Starting from dyad 18, which was considered the best performing, we implemented an antenna function in order to improve the light collection ability. This was achieved with tetrad 20, Fig. 5, where the presence of two symmetric triphenylamine chromophores provides an intense absorption in the UV.32 As a consequence, 20 displays an extended absorption all over the UV-visible spectral range, see Fig. 6. The accessory chromophores transfer energy with a 100% efficiency to the corrole unit, from where an electron transfer sequence as described for the parent dyad 18 arises. This system has an even better efficiency of charge separation and a similar lifetime of the CS state compared to 18, but has the advantage of using also UV photons to pump charge separation.

A further functionality which might be included in the dyad 18 is that of an accessory electron donor D which can be located at the meso positions. If the D unit can be oxidized more easily than corrole, we can expect an electron shift from the D accessory donor to corrole after charge separation has occurred. This secondary electron transfer, which is a ground state process, would lead to the separation of charges over a more extended distance with respect to 18, with a consequent increase in CS lifetime, Fig. 7. This multi-step electron transfer strategy in the construction of arrays for charge separation is well known and can lead to extremely long lifetimes of CS.33 With a judicious choice of the added component and after delineating the synthetic strategies, this extra functionality might also be coupled in the same unit to that of light collection with an overall improvement in absorption, efficiency and charge separation lifetime. We are presently working along these lines.

          Corrole–C60 dyads
Very recently, D’Souza and Fukuzumi in collaboration with one of us reported the synthesis and photophysical properties in different solvents of the corrole–fullerene dyads connected by phenyl spacers 21 and 22 (Chart 4).15 As in the other cases described above the corrole component was used as the electron donor. Excitation into the corrole band leads to a nearly quantitative quenching of corrole luminescence in solvents of all polarity; a slightly higher efficiency was noticed in polar solvents where charge separation was characterized by a higher driving force. Luminescence quenching was characterized by rates in the order of 1011–109 s−1, similar to those previously measured for the dyads described above. However, quite surprisingly, the luminescence quenching in 21 is bi-exponential. The decay of the corrole excited state parallels the formation of the fullerene anion, which has a characteristic absorption band around 1000 nm, and provides evidence for the formation of a charge separated state with the hole localized on the corrole and the anion on C60, C+-C60−. Also in this case the corrole cation could not be detected. Charge recombination occurred in the nanosecond scale in polar solvents, and was slower in 22 than in 21 due to the decreased electronic coupling. Quite remarkably in non-polar toluene and cyclohexane the CS state displayed a lifetime in the order of several microseconds, much higher than that measured for the corresponding dyads 18 and 19 based on a perylene bisimide electron acceptor. According to the authors this is made possible not only by the high driving force of the charge recombination reaction (ca. 1.3 eV) and by the unique property of C60 which, due to its three-dimensional structure, has a low reorganization energy but also by the properties of the corrole. The fact that the triplet excited level of this chromophore is higher in energy than the CS state of the system, a situation hardly found in porphyrin–C60 dyads, prevents a deactivation of the CS state to a close triplet state and favors a ground state recombination. Because of the high driving force, the latter process is liable to the well-known “Marcus inverted behaviour” predicting a slower reaction at higher driving forces and therefore results in the long lifetime of the CS state.34 It should be stressed that in the dyads 17–20 discussed above CS recombines to the ground state, as the full recovery of bleaching bands can testify. In these dyads the driving force of the charge recombination is higher than the present one, above 1.5 eV, nonetheless the charge recombination reaction is still of some orders of magnitude faster than in 21–22. We must therefore conclude that again the unique properties of C60 can play an important role in molecular devices for charge separation.

3.4 Synthesis
Several issues merit particular consideration when contemplating the synthesis of complex corrole-containing molecular structures. From the standpoint of synthetic efficiency, in analogy to porphyrins, two general strategies are possible. The first strategy starts with the preparation of an elaborated aldehyde which would then be used in the corrole-forming reaction. The second one starts with the synthesis of the corrole followed by modifications of peripheral substituents. Given the moderate stability of corroles it is desirable to gain significant relief from the corrole manipulations. From the point of view of minimization of operations on the corroles, the first route is more attractive. On the other hand, this procedure leads to a significant loss of precious substrates. Both strategies are complementary and both have been used in the construction of dyads and triads. Our group mostly relied on the first strategy. For example the synthesis of dyad 18 started from the transformation of perylene bisanhydride into complex aldehyde 24 in five steps. An acid catalyzed condensation of this aldehyde with 5-(pentafluorophenyl)dipyrrane (25) followed by oxidation of the resulting tetrapyrrane with DDQ led to trans-A2B-corrole 18 in 17% yield (Scheme 1).31 An analogous strategy was used by us in the synthesis of dyads 14–16,30 as well as by others in the synthesis of porphyrinyl-corroles 835 and 9–1125 (Charts 1 and 2).
 Scheme 1 
The second strategy (post-functionalization of simple corroles bearing desired functional groups) seems to be slightly less popular. For example in the synthesis of dyad 21, the relatively simple corrole 27 was initially assembled via a [2 + 1] type condensation (Scheme 2). Subsequent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with fullerene easily yielded dyad 21.15 Post-functionalization of the corrole core was also used by us in the synthesis of porphyrin–corrole 13,29 (Fig. 2) as well as by others in the synthesis of 1228 (Chart 1). Multichromophoric system 20 is a special case since only the combination of both strategies proved to be successful for its synthesis.32
 Scheme 2 
The efficiency of these syntheses varies from case to case. While in most situations the total yield is below 3%, in the synthesis of dyad 21 a remarkable overall yield (8%) has been reached. It is worth noting that many dyads (9–22) contain a corrole skeleton of the trans-A2B type, since this pattern of substitution is probably the most convenient architecture for the introduction of one specific substituent at the meso positions of the macrocycle.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
Several porphyrinoids have been proposed as alternative components to porphyrins in photo-active arrays. Corrole is one of those and, because of the development of efficient procedures for their synthesis and the remarkable photophysical and electrochemical properties, this tetrapyrrole and, to a lesser extent, their metal complexes have successfully been used as moieties of multi-component arrays displaying photo-activity. Several research groups have been engaged in the development of synthetic procedures for covalently connecting these chromophores to complementary units and in determining the photo-reactivity of the resulting ensembles. Corroles have been connected to the most classical photo-active components as metal complexes, other porphyrinoids, aromatic imides and bisimides and to fullerene. In all cases, systems with excellent photo-stability and rich light-induced reactivity have been reported. In the cases examined, corroles act both as photosensitizers, i.e. they absorb light and provide the photo-active species, and as electron or energy relays since they have either the right redox potential or the excited state energy level to accept electrons or energy from the photosensitizer and, possibly, to transfer it to some other component. Our groups have developed a series of dyads and a higher homologue and have characterized the photoreactivity of these arrays. We have improved the performances by a careful design based on the knowledge of the excitation energy dissipation processes. Further improvements can be achieved and we are working in this direction.
The design of further structures with improved, or just diverse, performances upon light absorption should take into consideration the following basic principles. The possibility to tune the redox properties of the corrole, in particular that of lowering the oxidation potential, is difficult to achieve. In fact the strategy of incorporating electron donating groups around the periphery is not viable due to the well-known photo and thermal stability problems of corroles, which require electron withdrawing groups. Metalation of corroles would give access to a wide number of interesting compounds; still very little is known about the photophysics of these complexes, only Ga(III) and Al(III) corroles have received some interest to date, but they might represent a rich selection of units with diverse properties, suitable for incorporation into multi-component arrays. In principle, metal corroles may act both as photosensitizers and as electron or energy relays. In analogy to porphyrins, metalation of the corrole macrocycle is expected to decrease, in some cases, the singlet excited state lifetime to such an extent that photo-reactivity could hardly compete with the intrinsic deactivation of the state, however the resulting triplet excited states might be used as a photo-sensitizer, as is well known for other cases (e.g. transition metal complexes).
In perspective, the use of metal corroles, the preparation of more elaborate structures based both on free-base and metalated corroles, and the inclusion of these structures into real devices have great potential and may successfully contribute to the challenge of the exploitation of sunlight.
