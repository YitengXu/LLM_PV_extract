Introduction
Life as we know it today mainly exists thanks to photosynthesis, the process through which light energy is converted into a stable electrochemical potential, which is eventually stored as chemical energy through a series of ‘dark’ (light-independent) reactions by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria.1 The primary processes of photosynthesis involve photon capture (i.e., light harvesting) and energy transfer by the ‘antenna complexes’, and subsequently energy conversion in the reaction centers (RCs).1 The basic functional entity, which effectively carries out these primary steps of photosynthesis in purple photosynthetic bacteria, is the core complex RC–LH1, which consists of the light-harvesting antenna complex LH1 and the reaction center.2–4
The development of artificial photosynthetic systems using a large portion of the solar spectrum would be a major advance in energy production, and a critical breakthrough with respect to the rising concern of environmental pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels.5 The design of such systems can be guided by the key steps of natural photosynthesis such as the efficient capture of visible light photons and electron/hole separation by electron transfer to give energetic oxidizing and reducing equivalents with long lifetimes (∼1 s).1–4 However, even relatively simple bacterial photosynthetic systems are actually extremely complex, and their synthetic imitation has been a challenging task. Mimicking the natural photosynthetic process requires making synthetic models of all the important components and then linking them together into a working molecular assembly.6–14
Porphyrins, synthetic analogues of natural chlorophyll molecules used in photosynthesis, have been widely used as promising candidates for light-capturing chromophores.8–14 Porphyrins are characterized by high molar absorption coefficients, fast energy and/or electron transfer to acceptor components in the system, and a variety of redox potentials caused by meso- and/or β-substituents in the porphyrin framework and introduction of a metal.15,16 The structural complexity of light-harvesting antenna complexes (LH1 and LH2), in which various chlorophyll moieties are superbly embedded in a transmembrane protein matrix, has also prompted the design and preparation of light-harvesting multiporphyrin systems.17–29
Fullerenes, made up of alternating hexagons and pentagons of carbon atoms, hold great promise as three-dimensional electron acceptors because of the small reorganization energy associated with electron transfer reactions, which results from the π-electron systems being delocalized over the three-dimensional curved surface together with the rigid and confined structure of the aromatic π sphere.11,30 One can expect that fullerene-based donor–acceptor systems should lead to acceleration of the charge separation and deceleration of the charge recombination processes, as expected by the Marcus theory of electron transfer.11,30,31
Similar promises rest on quasi-one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, in particular single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).32,33 The structure of SWNTs basically arises from the folding of a planar graphene sheet of hexagonal carbon rings. SWNTs have a characteristic curved surface that facilitates binding of larger organic molecules such as porphyrins via noncovalent or hydrophobic interactions.34–36 Fullerenes employed as π-electron acceptors can be then replaced by SWNTs to utilize their extensive conjugated π-system. Therefore, a combination of light-harvesting multiporphyrins and fullerenes/SWNTs would seem to be ideal as photofunctional nanomaterials for the construction of artificial photosynthetic systems.
This review focuses on recent development of artificial photosynthetic systems using photofunctional nanomaterials composed of multiporphyrins and carbon-based π-electron acceptors such as fullerenes, SWNTs and a new type of nanocarbon. First, electron donor–acceptor ensembles composed of porphyrins and fullerenes are described, covering small electron donor–acceptor dyads to gigantic multi-component systems. Such photofunctional nanomaterials can then be utilized to construct efficient light energy conversion systems such as photovoltaic devices.
Covalently linked electron donor–acceptor ensembles composed of porphyrins and other π-systems
A large number of electron donor–acceptor (D–A) dyads have been designed and synthesized, and the photodynamics have been examined in order to mimic the initial step of photosynthetic charge separation.6–14,37–39 In most cases, efficient photoinduced electron transfer takes place to afford the charge-separated (CS) state in competition with the decay of the photoexcited state to the ground state. The CS lifetimes are normally less than 1 μs because of rapid charge recombination to the ground states or the low-lying triplet excited states. However, there are some cases that afford relatively long-lived CS states, and such examples are shown in Fig. 1.40–43
 Fig. 1  Examples of electron donor–acceptor dyads affording long-lived CS states: (a) zinc chlorin–C60 dyad (ZnCh–C60),40 (b) zinc imidazoporphyrin–C60 dyad (ZnImP–C60),41 (c) subphthalocyanine–ferrocene dyad (SubPc–Fc),42 and (d) zinc quinoxalinoporphyrin–gold quinoxalinoporphyrin dyad (ZnPQ–AuPQ+).43 
The common feature affording relatively long-lived CS states in Fig. 1 is a short distance between the electron donor and acceptor. For example, C60 is directly attached to the chlorin by means of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in the case of the ZnCh–C60 dyad, where the edge-to-edge distance is only 2.6 Å (Fig. 1a). 40 The photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of ZnCh to C60 occurs with a rate constant of 1.0 × 1011 s−1 to afford the CS state, which can be detected by transient absorption spectroscopy as well as by ESR spectroscopy.40 The CS state decays via back-electron-transfer (BET) to the ground state rather than to the triplet excited state, since the CS state is lower in energy (1.26 eV) than both the triplet excited state of C60 (1.50 eV) and ZnCh (1.36–1.45 eV).40 In contrast to the rapid photoinduced electron transfer, the BET is extremely slow and the CS lifetime is 230 μs at 298 K (Fig. 1a). In this case, the BET process is deep in the Marcus inverted region because of a small reorganization energy of electron transfer in ZnCh–C60 with a short linkage, where the electron transfer rate decreases with increasing the driving force.30 This is the reason why such a long CS lifetime is attained for a simple electron donor–acceptor dyad. A zinc imidazoporphyrin–C60 dyad (ZnImP–C60) with a short linkage has also a long CS lifetime (310 μs at 278 K) in PhCN (Fig. 1b).41
Besides porphyrins, phthalocyanines and subphthalocyanines (SubPcs)44 provide promising properties for development of artificial photosynthetic systems, because they absorb solar light more efficiently than porphyrins.44,45 They also have small reorganization energies of electron transfer.46–48Ferrocene (Fc) is attached to SubPcvia the B–X axial bond to synthesize SubPc–Fc dyads (Fig. 1c).42 Photoinduced electron transfer occurs efficiently from Fc to the singlet excited state of SubPc to afford a long-lived CS state (231 μs in PhCN at 298 K).42
An alternative way to reduce the reorganization energy of electron transfer is the use of a non-polar solvent, because the solvent reorganization energy is minimized in a non-polar solvent. However, the energies of the CS states in a non-polar solvent are normally higher than the triplet energies of porphyrins. When an electron donor–acceptor system containing Au(III) and Zn(II) porphyrin (ZnPQ–AuPQ+) is employed, however, it is possible to keep the energy of the electron-transfer (ET) state lower than the triplet energy even in a non-polar solvent such as in cyclohexane.43 In this case, a charge-shift type of electron transfer occurs, rather than the charge-separation type of electron transfer that occurs in neutral donor–acceptor dyads. In the case of a charge-shift type of electron transfer, the change in solvation is largely cancelled out when the free energy change of electron transfer is not changed significantly by the difference in solvents.49,50 Thus, the lifetime of the ET state (ZnPQ˙+–AuPQ) is 10 μs in cyclohexane at 298 K (Fig. 1b), whereas the lifetime of the ET states of electron donor–acceptor dyads with Au(III) porphyrins are much shorter than 1 μs in a polar solvent such as PhCN.43,51
A zinc imidazoporphyrin–C60 dyad (ZnImP–C60) with a short linkage that afforded a long-lived CS state (Fig. 1b) was extended to a triad by attaching ferrocene with a short spacer (Fc–ZnImP–C60 in Fig. 2).52 The lifetime of the final CS state (Fc+–ZnImP–C60˙−) is elongated to 630 μs, which is the longest ever reported for triads at room temperature. After excitation of the porphyrin, electron transfer to C60 occurs within 230 ps, followed by hole transfer to ferrocene after 500 ps to produce the long-lived CS state.52 The CS lifetime (630 μs) of Fc+–ZnImP–C60˙− is much longer than the lifetime (8 μs) of a similar triad linked by a longer amide linkage, Fc+–NHCO–ZnP–CONH–C60˙− (Fig. 2).38 The observed slow charge-recombination rate from the CS state of Fc–ZnImP–C60 arises from partial cancellation of two effects: the rate reduction stemming from the smaller λ value, and the rate enhancement due to increased electronic coupling V that arises from the orbital delocalization.52

The triad in Fig. 2 is further extended to make tetrad molecules.53,54 The longest lifetime of the CS state was attained for a tetrad (Fc–ZnP–ZnP–C60) in Fig. 3a.54 In the final CS state, Fc+–ZnP–ZnP–C60˙−, charges are separated by a long distance (Ree = 48.9 Å).53,54 The lifetime of the resulting CS state in frozen PhCN has been determined to be as long as 1.7 s.54 This CS lifetime is even longer than that of the natural photosynthetic reaction center. It should be noted that the CS lifetime is temperature independent, since the charge-recombination process is at the Marcus top region.53 However, it should also be noted that such an extremely long CS lifetime could only be attained in frozen media, because bimolecular charge recombination between two Fc+–ZnP–ZnP–C60˙− molecules is much faster than the unimolecular process in solution.53,54 In such bimolecular reactions, the positive and negative charges can be close due to the diffusional collision, and the rate constant of bimolecular charge recombination is close to being diffusion-limited.53

A similar result was obtained for a ferrocene–meso,meso-linked porphyrin trimer–fullerene pentad, (Fc–(ZnP)3–C60) in Fig. 3b, where the C60 and the ferrocene are tethered at both ends of (ZnP)3 (Ree = 46.9 Å).55 The lifetime of the final CS state (0.53 s at 163 K) has been attained without lowering the CS efficiency (ΦCS = 0.83).55

Electron donor–acceptor ensembles based on porphyrins with non-covalent bonding
The synthesis of multi-component artificial photosynthetic model compounds shown in Fig. 2 has been very difficult, and the final yield is very low.53–55 The use of non-covalent binding such as metal–ligand coordination, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonds and rotaxane formation would provide a simpler but more elegant way to construct electron donor–acceptor ensembles mimicking the efficient biological electron transfer systems.56–61 When a non-coordinating solvent is used, an efficient charge separation occurs in the supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes but the CS state is extremely short-lived.58–61 In contrast, the CS state could be long-lived in a coordinating solvent, but the formation of the supramolecular complex between the donor and acceptor moieties is normally prohibited by the solvent coordination. In a polar coordinating solvent such as benzonitrile, intermolecular electron transfer prevails and the radical ions produced by photoinduced electron transfer decay via the bimolecular back-electron-transfer reactions, obeying second-order kinetics.62 This is a typical dilemma for the long-lived charge separation in supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes. However, a proper choice of the axial ligand as well as the solvent has enabled the attainment of long-lived CS states in supramolecular donor–acceptor complexes. For example, a long CS lifetime (330 μs at 298 K) has recently been achieved in a coordination complex of zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) with pyridylnaphthalenediimide (PyNIm) in PhCN.63 This was extended to construct a supramolecular ferrocene–zinc porphyrin–pyridylnaphthalenediimide triad [(Fc–ZnP)–PyNIm in Fig. 4].64 The photoinduced electron transfer yields the final CS state, a ferricenium ion–zinc porphyrin–naphthalenediimide radical anion [(Fc+–ZnP)–PyNIm˙−], which is successfully detected by transient absorption spectroscopy in laser flash photolysis. The lifetime of the CS state is determined as 320 μs at 298 K, which is comparable to the longest lifetime among covalently linked triads in Fig. 3a. It should be noted that no CS state is detected in the parent dyad (Fc–ZnP).64

An alternative supramolecular approach has also been developed, in which covalently linked ferrocene–porphyrin–crown ether compounds were self-assembled with cationic alkylammonium-functionalized fullerenes.65 Upon photoexcitation, efficient forward electron transfer to the C60 moiety viacrown ether–alkylammonium cation complexation occurs, followed by hole transfer from the porphyrin radical cation to the ferrocene entity to afford the final CS state, which exhibits a relatively long lifetime (7 μs).65 Thus, the use of a coordination bond provides a convenient means of construction of multi-component structures of photosynthetic reaction center models.
Besides coordination bonds, π–π interaction has merited increasing attention because of its important role in biological systems, such as for π-stacking of double-stranded DNA.66–68 For example, a bisporphyrin has been shown to form a π-complex with fullerene, which is inserted between the two porphyrin rings.69Acridinium ion is suitable as a component of an artificial photosynthetic reaction center because of the small reorganization energy (λ) of electron transfer,50 which results in fast photoinduced electron transfer but extremely slow back-electron-transfer.51,70,71 A free-base bisporphyrin (H4DPOx) forms a π-complex with DNA intercalators,72 such as acridinium perchlorate (AcH+ClO4−) in benzonitrile (PhCN), as shown in Fig. 5.73 H4DPOx is regarded as a model compound of a bacteriochlorophyll dimer [(BChl)2], which has two cofacial porphyrin rings and a flexible spacer, diphenyl oxide. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the H4DPOx to the AcH+ moiety occurred efficiently in the π-complex to form the ET state (H4DPOx˙+–AcH˙ in Fig. 5).73 The lifetime of the ET state was determined to be 18 μs in PhCN at 298 K, and the quantum yield of the ET state was 90%.73 The ET state lifetime exhibited large temperature dependence. As a result, a remarkably long-lived ET state has been attained at low temperature, and virtually no decay of the ET state was observed at 77 K.

Such an extremely long-lived ET state is indeed detected by steady-state UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and also by the color change shown in Fig. 5.
Formation of much larger scale of donor–acceptor ensembles is also made possible by π–π interaction between multi-porphyrin compounds—such as the porphyrin–peptide hexadecamer [P(H2P)16]—and SWNTs, as shown in Fig. 6.74 Considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring potential applications of carbon nanotubes since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.32,75 However, current preparative methods for SWNTs generate only heterogeneous nanotube mixtures that can vary in length, diameter, and electronic properties (semiconducting, semimetallic and metallic). Supramolecular formation occurs through π–π interaction between porphyrins and nanotubes together with wrapping of the peptidic backbone in P(H2P)16, and this makes it possible to extract the large-diameter nanotubes (ca. 1.3 nm) as revealed by ultraviolet–visible–near infrared and Raman spectroscopy as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.74 Because unmodified SWNTs are significantly hydrophobic and readily aggregate, sample homogeneity is one key issue. This has prevented a wide range of fundamental researches on next-generation nanoelectronic applications of SWNTs.75–78 The supramolecular approach shown in Fig. 6 enables not only the achievement of non-destructive and diameter-selective SWNT extraction methods, but also the development of an efficient light-energy conversion system (vide infra).74

Laser photoexcitation of the P(H2P)16/SWNTs nanohybrid in DMF results in the appearance of a transient absorption at 450 nm together with a broad absorption band in the 500–800 nm region, which exhibits a number of bleaching bands (Fig. 7a).74 Taking into account the fact that the bleaching bands agree with the absorption bands due to P(H2P)16/SWNTs (inset of Fig. 7a) and no transient absorption is observed upon photoexcitation of P(H2P)16, the observed transient absorption spectrum is assigned to the CS state of P(H2P)16/SWNT, produced by photoinduced electron transfer from the excited states of P(H2P)16 to SWNTs.
 Fig. 7  (a) Transient absorption spectra of P(H2P)16/SWNT (●) and P(H2P)16 (○) in DMF at 298 K taken at 6 μs after laser excitation at 440 and 427 nm, respectively.74 Top spectrum: UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra of P(H2P)16/SWNT. (b) First-order plots at 480 nm with different laser powers (7, 3, and 1 mJ, respectively).74 
The decay of the CS state of P(H2P)16/SWNTs obeys first-order kinetics (Fig. 7b) and the CS lifetime is determined to be 370 μs, which is significantly shorter than the reported triplet lifetimes of porphyrin peptide oligomers.79 Formation of such nanohybrids affording the long-lived CS state opens a new strategy toward the extraction of large-diameter SWNTs without destruction of the π-conjugated system within SWNTs, and development of efficient light energy conversion.
The control of the diameter and size of carbon nanotubes has recently been made possible using cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) that consist of truncated conical graphene layers with a hollow tubular morphology, composed of cup-shaped carbon units with diameters ranging from 50 to 150 nm and lengths of up to 200 μm.80 In addition, the availability of reactive edges on the outer and inner surface of cup-shaped carbons to chemical functionalization or surface modification will open up new ways to utilize them in electronic, catalytic, and photovoltaic applications.81 CSCNTs were efficiently destacked by electron-transfer reduction with sodium naphthalenide to produce individual cup-shaped structures with controlled diameter and size, as shown in Fig. 8a and b.82,83 Addition of 1-iodododecane then leads to functionalized cup-shaped nanocarbons, which are stable in air and are highly dispersible in nonpolar solvents for long periods of time (Fig. 8c).82
 Fig. 8  Scheme and TEM images of (a) electron-transfer reduction of cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), giving (b) reduced individual cup-shaped nanocarbons and (c) dodecylated cup-shaped nanocarbons with controlled diameter and size.82 
Photoinduced electron-transfer reduction of CSCNTs also results in highly dispersible cup-shaped nanocarbons with size homogeneity.83 The next step toward functional devices is to devise strategies enabling the fitting of such components into a working molecular assembly. A variety of donor–acceptor nanohybrids formed between porphyrins and conventional carbon nanotubes have so far been reported for light-to-energy conversion.35,36,84,85 The development of carbon-based nanomaterials with uniform size combined with porphyrins is now in progress.

Porphyrin nanochannels including guest electron donors
The π–π interaction also plays an important role in the assembly of porphyrins for the development of photofunctional materials based on the self-assembly of porphyrin compounds. A variety of porphyrin nanostructures have so far been reported, including nanorods exhibiting photoconductivity,86 and surface fabrication of electrodes toward the development of photovoltaic cells.87 Shelnutt and coworkers developed a porphyrin nanotube that can form platinum nanoparticles on the surface for the catalysis of photochemical H2 evolution.88
The self-assembly of porphyrin compounds has also attracted much attention in relation to the development of functional materials composed of electron donors and acceptors. The construction of porphyrin-based porous materials provides large channels, which can contain guest electron-donor or -acceptor molecules.89 Molecular recognition in the course of guest inclusion has been reported by Suslick and coworkers.89 They have prepared zeolite-like porous materials by self-assembly of metalloporphyrins and metal clusters, demonstrating molecular recognition based on the shape and size of guest molecules.89
Construction of multi-component supramolecular assemblies provides novel structures and integrated functionality that cannot be achieved by each building block alone. We have developed novel porphyrin supramolecules by using dodecaphenylporphyrin (H2DPP),90 which exhibits a saddle-distorted structure that can be recognized as a curved surface.91 Supramolecules based on self-assembly of saddle-distorted DPP-derivatives due to intermolecular interactions can give isolated inner spaces for the protection of the guest molecules from external lethal attack. This structural motif can contribute to the stabilization of unstable and metastable species in the cavity, and the observation of unprecedented characteristics of molecules. Such a strategy makes it possible to access the novel functionality of porphyrin-based multi-component materials, at a molecular level as single crystals (vide infra).92
A novel porphyrin nanochannel (PNC; Fig. 9) was constructed using the hydrochloric acid salt of H2DPP, [H4DPP]Cl2, as a building block.93,94 All the PNC supramolecular architectures can be obtained as single crystals in the monoclinic space groupC2/c by recrystallization of [H4DPP]Cl2 with or without guest molecules from CHCl3 and CH3CN by vapor diffusion of CH3CN at room temperature.93,94
 Fig. 9  A novel porphyrin nanochannel (PNC) constructed using the hydrochloric acid salt of H2DPP, [H4DPP]Cl2, as a building block.93,94 
In the absence of guest molecules, the self-assembly of [H4DPP]Cl2 gave a PNC including water, chloroform, and acetonitrile molecules, formulated as [H4DPP]Cl2·0.5(H2O)4·0.5(CHCl3)·(CH3CN)2.93,94 This is referred to as “PNC–water”, and the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 10. The formation of PNC–water indicates that the supramolecular structure is the global minimum of the enthalpy-driven self-assembly of [H4DPP]Cl2. The unit {[H4DPP]Cl2·(CH3CN)2} is the fundamental component of PNC, which can be recognized as a skeletal unit, since other porphyrin nanochannels containing various guest molecules consist of the same structural essence, accompanying the guest inclusion to form [H4DPP]Cl2·(guest)·(CH3CN)2, as mentioned below. In the guest-included PNC, the site where the water molecules and chloroform molecule are included in PNC–water is occupied by other guest molecules such as hydroquinone. Two identical channels run in the crystallographic [110] and [10] directions with a 71° angle between them. The size of the channel was estimated to be 0.7 × 1.0 nm with an ellipsoidal cross-section. The size of the guest-inclusion site was estimated to be 10 × 9 × 5 Å3, indicating that planar molecules such as aromatic molecules would be appropriate as guest molecules.
 Fig. 10  Crystal structure of PNC–water (gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; light green, chloride).94 The framework of the DPP moiety is shown in gray. 
The guest inclusion occurs at the guest inclusion site of the PNC structure. Vapor diffusion of CH3CN into solutions of PNC–water and 20 equivalents of guest molecules in CHCl3 and CH3CN gave porphyrin nanochannels formulated as [H4DPP]Cl2·(guest)·(CH3CN)2 in good yields. In the presence of hydroquinone derivatives (o-, m-, p-dihydroxybenzenes (hydroquinones), tetrafluorohydroquinone, tetrachlorohydroquinone), the PNC–water structure underwent guest exchange (water molecules to a series of guest molecules) in the course of recrystallization. The crystal structure of PNC including p-tetrafluorohydroquinone (H2QF4) is depicted in Fig. 11.94 The H2QF4 molecule is included at the guest inclusion site, instead of the water molecules and CHCl3, by non-covalent interactions with H4DPP2+ involving π–π interactions with the phenyl group at the β-position of pyrrole and an OH–π interaction with the pyrrole nitrogen.
 Fig. 11  Crystal structure of PNC–H2QF4 (gray, carbon; blue, nitrogen; red, oxygen; yellow, fluorine; light green, chloride).94 The framework of the DPP moiety is shown in gray. 
The guest inclusion into the PNC is regulated by electronic characteristics and steric effects of the molecules. Firstly, the guest molecule should have an electron-donating character. Hydroquinone derivatives and quinone derivatives are almost the same in size; however, only hydroquinone derivatives can be included into the PNC: the PNC–water structure is recovered without guest inclusion in the presence of the corresponding quinone derivatives as guest molecules under the same conditions. Secondly, the steric effects are represented by the inclusion behavior for perhalogenated hydroquinones: tetrafluorohydroquinone and tetrachlorohydroquinone can be included into the channels; however, tetrabromohydroquinone is not included.94
The other aspect of steric effects in guest inclusion is kinetic molecular recognition. Three isomers of xylene (o-, m-, and p-xylenes) can be included into the channels in separate crystallizations. When an equimolar mixture of the three isomers was employed as the guest, the recrystallization of [H4DPP]Cl2 from CHCl3–CH3CN in the presence of a large excess of the mixture gave crystals of PNC–xylene derivatives.94 The ratio of xylenes included into the PNC was determined to be 1 : 1 : 5 ortho:meta:para by 1H NMR spectroscopy.94 Thus, the PNC superstructure exhibits selective inclusion due primarily to the electronic characteristics and secondly to the shape and size of the guest molecules.
In general, neutral porphyrin compounds including free bases and metal complexes have been recognized to act as electron donors in photoinduced electron transfer.14–16 In contrast, cationic porphyrin complexes have been reported to act as electron acceptors.95,96 The H4DPP2+ moiety in the porphyrin nanochannel is positively charged and, therefore, hard to oxidize. In such a case, photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the guest molecules with electron-donating character to the singlet excited state of [H4DPP]Cl2 in the skeleton unit as an electron acceptor.94 The resulting radical cations were detected by ESR, as shown in Fig. 12 together with the computer simulation spectra with the hyperfine coupling constants (hfc) of the radical cations.94 It should be noted that the configuration of both OH groups of H2Q is fixed to be trans in the PNC guest inclusion site due to the hydrogen bonding with the acetonitrile molecules (vide supra). It has been reported that H2Q+˙ undergoes cis–transisomerization in solution, exhibiting the ESR spectra of this mixture below −20 °C in CH3NO2.97 In addition, the radical cations of hydroquinone and catechol have been known to be strong acids, with pKa = −0.8 and −1.65, respectively.98 In the case of PNC–H2Q (Fig. 12a), there are three sets of hfc values due to two equivalent protons (4.6, 3.6, and 1.6 G). These hfc values agree better with those calculated for the trans isomer of H2Q+˙ (4.6, 2.7 and 1.5 G) than those for the cis isomer (4.6, 2.4, and 1.8 G).99 The largest hfc value (4.6 G) is assigned to the OH proton, and the difference between the two CH protons for the trans isomer is significantly larger than that for the cis isomer. In the case of PNC–H2QF4, the difference between the two aF values of H2QF4+˙ becomes more pronounced for the trans isomer (Fig. 12b). A similar trend is also observed for PNC–H2QCl4 (Fig. 12c), where there is large difference between the two aCl values of H2QCl4+˙, although the large linewidth does not allow the accurate determination of the smaller aCl value. Thus, the ESR signals due to H2Q+˙ and its derivatives indicate that the configuration of the radical cations is fixed to be trans as the neutral form in the PNC crystal structure. In the case of PNC–Cat (Cat = o-hydroquinone, i.e., catechol) (Fig. 12d), the ESR signal is assigned to the catechol radical cation based on the comparison between the observed and calculated hfc values. The hydroquinone and catechol radical cations survive over a couple of hours at room temperature without deprotonation after cutting off the light. The observation of radical cations of guest molecules in Fig. 12 clearly indicates the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer from guest molecules to the singlet excite state of H4DPP2+ in the PNC–guest crystals, as shown in Scheme 1. In any case, electron transfer from the guest molecules to the triplet excited state, 3(H4DPP2+)*, is energetically unlikely to occur.94 The reduced cation radical, H4DPP+˙, undergoes fast disproportionation on the basis of electron hopping in the solid state due to close contact with other H4DPP2+ ions via intermolecular π–π interactions to give the original H4DPP2+ and the two-electron-reduced species, H4DPP (Scheme 1).94 In addition, H4DPP+˙ undergoes back-electron-transfer (charge recombination) to form 3(H4DPP2+)*, the energy of which is lower than that of the CS state (Scheme 1).94

Supramolecular solar cells of nano-composites between porphyrins and fullerenes
Supramolecular assemblies of porphyrins and π-conjugated molecules, which undergo efficient photoinduced electron transfer described above, provide excellent components to construct supramolecular solar cells. New approaches for production of efficient and low-cost organic solar cells is desired because of increasing attention toward solar energy conversion to develop inexpensive renewable energy sources.100–102 Typical examples of supramolecular solar cells are described in this section.
The first example is a supramolecular solar cell prepared using self-organization of π-complexes between porphyrin (donor) and fullerene (acceptor) units by clusterization with gold nanoparticles on nanostructured SnO2electrodes, as shown in Fig. 13a. Porphyrin alkanethiolate monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (H2PCnMPC: n is the number of methylene groups in the spacer) with a spherical shape (Fig. 13b) are prepared starting from porphyrin–alkanethiol.103–105 Given the values of the elemental analysis of H2PC11MPC (H: 4.88%; C: 44.77%; N: 3.10%), there are 57 porphyrin alkanethiolate chains on the gold surface for H2PC11MPC.105 The distance between two adjacent porphyrins (to accommodate C60 by π–π interactions) can be controlled by changing the number of methylene groups in the spacer, the best distance (17.3 Å) being obtained when n = 15.106 The diameter of the gold core in H2PC15MPC was determined as 2.1 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 12b).106 These nanoparticles form π-complexes with C60 and are clusterized in a acetonitrile–toluene solvent mixture. The composite clusters were easily deposited onto the OTE/SnO2electrode by electrophoretic deposition to prepare the OTE/SnO2/(H2PCnMPC+C60)melectrode, as shown in Fig. 14.105,106 Upon application of a DC electric field of 200 V between the OTE/SnO2 and OTE electrodes (Fig. 14), which were immersed together in a mixed acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1, v/v) solution containing (H2PCnMPC+C60)mclusters, the mixed clusters were readily deposited on the SnO2 nanocrystallites.

The photoelectrochemical performance of the OTE/SnO2/(H2PCnMPC+C60)melectrode was examined in acetonitrile containing NaI (0.5 M) and I2 (0.01 M) as redox electrolyte using a Pt gauge counter-electrode.105,106 The effect of the alkanethiolate chain length on the incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) is shown in Fig. 15A. The action spectra indicate that the higher IPCE and the broader photoresponse are attained with longer H2PCnMPC chain lengths. The OTE/SnO2 /(H2PC15MPC+C60)m ([H2P] = 0.19 mmol dm−3, [C60] = 0.38 mmol dm−3) electrode exhibits a maximum IPCE value (54%) and a very broad photoresponse (up to ∼1000 nm) which extends to the near-IR region. As mentioned above, a long methylene spacer (as in H2PC15MPC) provides the most appropriate space for fullerene molecules to be inserted between two neighboring porphyrin rings, leading to more efficient photocurrent generation.

The power conversion efficiency (η) of the photoelectrochemical cell of the OTE/SnO2/(H2PC15MPC+C60)melectrode was determined by varying the load resistance (Fig. 15B).106 A drop in the photovoltage and an increase in the photocurrent are observed with decreasing the load resistance. Power conversion efficiency, η, is determined by the following equation, η = FF × Isc × Voc/Winwhere the fill factor is defined as FF = [IV]max/IscVoc, where Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, and Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent.107 The OTE/SnO2/(H2PC15MPC+C60)m system has a much larger FF of 0.43, a Voc of 380 mV, an Isc of 1.0 mA cm−2, and a η value of 1.5% at a Win of 11.2 mW cm−2, as compared with the reference system [OTE/SnO2/(H2P-ref+C60)m].106
A similar supramolecular solar cell was developed using porphyrin–peptide oligomers [porphyrin functionalized α-polypeptides: P(H2P)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)] and C60 assembled on a nanostructured SnO2electrode using an electrophoretic deposition method.108,109Porphyrin oligomers with polypeptidic backbone (polylysine), which form π-complexes with carbon nanotubes (vide supra), provide ideal space to form π-complex assemblies with C60 as shown schematically in Fig. 16.108,109 Remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible and near-infrared regions is seen with increasing the number of porphyrin units in α-polypeptide structures.108,109 Formation of supramolecular clusters of porphyrins and fullerenes prepared in 3 : 1 acetonitrile–toluene has been confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and absorption spectroscopy.108,109 The highly colored composite clusters of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and fullerenes have been assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method. A high power conversion efficiency η of ∼1.6% and a maximum IPCE value (48%) were attained using composite clusters of free base and porphyrin–peptide hexadecamers [P(H2P)16] with fullerenes, as shown in Fig. 17 (A and B, respectively).109 The IPCE values increase with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit in the (P(H2P)n+C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) system. This suggests that efficient photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin unit to C60 in the supramolecular complex with increasing the number of porphyrins in the polypeptide unit. Femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence measurements of porphyrin–fullerene composite films confirmed improved electron-transfer properties with increasing number of porphyrins in the polypeptide unit.109 When P(H2P)16 was replaced by P(ZnP)16, a larger IPCE value was obtained for (P(ZnP)16+C60)m (56%) than for (P(H2P)16+C60)m (48%).109

Photocurrent generation in this system (Scheme 2) is initiated by photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of free base porphyrin (1H2P*/H2P+ = −0.7 V vs.NHE)30 or zinc porphyrin (1ZnP*/ZnP+ = −1.0 V vs.NHE) in the porphyrin–peptide oligomer to C60 (C60/C60− = −0.2 V vs.NHE) in the porphyrin–C60 complex, rather than direct electron injection to the conduction band of SnO2 (0 V vs.NHE) system.109 The reduced C60 injects electrons into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, whereas the oxidized porphyrin (H2P/H2P˙+ = 1.2 V or ZnP/ZnP+ = 1.0 V vs.NHE) undergoes the electron-transfer reduction with the iodide (I3−/I− = 0.5 V vs.NHE) in the electrolyte system.109 The driving force of electron transfer from 1ZnP* to C60 (0.8 eV) is significantly larger than that of electron transfer from 1H2P* to C60 (0.5 eV). The larger IPCE value of (P(ZnP)16+C60)m (56%) that that of (P(H2P)16+C60)m (48%) may be ascribed to the difference in the driving force of electron transfer.

It should be emphasized that the power conversion efficiency (η) of the (P(H2P)16+C60)m-modified electrode reaches 1.6%, which is 40 times higher than that for the porphyrin monomer (P(H2P)1+C60)m-modified electrode (0.043%). Thus, an organizational approach between porphyrins and fullerenes with polypeptide structures is quite promising, and may make it possible to further improve the light energy conversion properties by using a larger number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit.
Supramolecular solar cells have also been constructed using molecular clusters of porphyrin dendrimers (DnPn in Fig. 18) and C60 units assembled on SnO2electrodes.110Porphyrin dendrimers also form supramolecular complexes with C60 in toluene, and they are clusterized in an acetonitrile–toluene solvent mixture.110 The OTE/SnO2/(D4P4+C60)m system exhibits a maximum IPCE value of 15%, as well as a broad photoresponse that extends well into the infrared (up to 1000 nm). However, the IPCE value decreases with increasing dendrimer generation: the OTE/SnO2/(D16P16+C60)m system shows an even smaller IPCE value than the reference system [OTE/SnO2/(H2P-ref+C60)m].110 In the case of D16P16, the more crowded dendrimer structure may not be suitable for efficient π-complex formation of the porphyrin moieties with C60 due to the lack of space to accommodate C60insertion between two adjacent porphyrin rings. This indicates that the distance between two adjacent porphyrin rings is an essential factor in construction of efficient light energy conversion systems using supramolecular multi-porphyrin nanomaterials.

Concluding remarks
As demonstrated in this review, the combination of porphyrins and carbon-based π-electron acceptors such as fullerenes provides excellent photofunctional molecules and materials, in terms of their electron-transfer properties, for the development of artificial photosynthetic systems. The small electron transfer reorganization energies of these π-compounds are essential for the design of artificial photosynthetic systems composed of functional π-compounds with fast charge separation but extremely slow charge recombination that can be successfully used to construct efficient light energy conversion systems such as photovoltaic devices. There are two essential factors in efficient photocurrent generation. One is fast charge separation between electron donors and electron acceptor, and the other is the resulting hole transport and electron transport in the thin film. Three-dimensional steric control in the supramolecular π-complexes between porphyrins and fullerenes in particular contributes to both the efficient formation of charge separation and the hole and electron transport in the thin film. The further development of photofunctional materials composed of multiporphyrins and carbon-based π-electron acceptors involving π–π interactions will certainly provide a promising perspective for the development of efficient light energy conversion systems.
