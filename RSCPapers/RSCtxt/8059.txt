, Accepted 3rd August 2015First published on 10th August 2015AbstractAn organic dye with a pyridyl group as an anchor unit (NI4) adsorbs exclusively at the Lewis acid sites of TiO2 surface, although its adsorbability is very weak compared with that of a similar dye with a carboxyl group anchoring to Brønsted acid sites (NI2). In the present study, photovoltaic features of two similar dyes, NI2 and NI4, are thoroughly investigated by changing dye loadings on TiO2 surface and the intensity of the illuminated light. A remarkable finding is that photocurrents and photovoltages observed under intense illumination are larger for NI4 than for NI2, suggesting that the adsorbability of dye onto a TiO2 surface is not necessarily a principal factor leading to a high electron injection probability from dye to TiO2. Plausible reasons for the difference in photovoltaic features between NI2- and NI4-DSSCs are discussed on the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage measurements.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using nanocrystalline TiO2 powder and photosensitizing dyes have been studied intensively due to their possible low cost of fabrication and reasonably high power conversion efficiencies.1–6 A number of studies have been devoted to the design and synthesis of efficient photosensitizing dyes, and in most of the studies, electron-accepting carboxylic or cyanoacrylic acids have been exclusively employed as an anchor unit on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 particles.7–10 In contrast to this, we have found that a pyridyl group also acts as an anchoring and electron-withdrawing unit in photosensitizing dyes.11–15 This finding is of great importance from the viewpoint that a possible use of a pyridyl anchor can relieve a restriction that has been imposed on the design and synthesis of organic photosensitizers for a long time. In our subsequent study, details of the adsorption behaviors of an organic dye having a pyridyl anchor (NI4) on a TiO2 surface were carefully studied.16 Analysis of adsorption isotherms for dyes on TiO2 showed that the adsorption equilibrium constant of NI4 is two orders of magnitude smaller than that for a similar dye having a carboxyl anchor (NI2). In addition, elaborate FT-IR studies with NI4 powder and NI4 adsorbed on TiO2 revealed that a pyridyl dye, NI4, adsorbs on Lewis acid sites of TiO2 in contrast to Brønsted acid sites for a carboxyl dye, NI2. Coadsorption experiments with a TEMPO radical (4CT: 4-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) and either NI2 or NI4, coupled with the measurements of average nearest-neighbor interspin distances of 4CT radicals coadsorbed on TiO2 by a spin-probe ESR technique, supported this view.16 Currently, a variety of novel anchor units replacing carboxylic (cyanoacrylic) and pyridyl groups have been proposed: cyano-benzoic acid,17 phosphinic acid,18 8-hydroxyquinoline,19 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodamine,20 hydroxyl,21 TCNE and TCNQ,22 pyridine,23 benzothienopyridine,24 and triazine.25
It is now of great interest from an academic as well as a practical viewpoint to clarify a relationship between the type of anchor unit in a photosensitizing dye and the electron injection probability from the dye to TiO2. Our preliminary study has demonstrated that the photocurrents of NI4-DSSCs are greater than those of NI2-DSSCs when comparisons are made at the same dye loadings on TiO2 surfaces,12 although the adsorbability of NI4 on TiO2 is considerably weaker than that of NI2. A similar trend was found for other pyridyl and carboxyl dyes.13 To date, however, detailed studies have not been performed to clarify the reasons for this observation, which conflicts with a traditional view that good electron communication between dye and TiO2 leads to a high electron injection probability. In the present study, photovoltaic properties of DSSCs based on two similar dyes, NI2 and NI4, are studied carefully by changing dye loadings and the intensity of illuminated light, together with the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and a transient photovoltage technique.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Two types of organic dyes, NI2 and NI4, were synthesized as described earlier12 and their chemical structures are illustrated in Fig. 1. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) was purified by distillation and used as a solvent for dye adsorption. Acetonitrile (MeCN, Tokyo Kasei) was used as a solvent for DSSCs and was refluxed over P2O5 for a couple of hours under a N2 atmosphere. 1,2-Dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPrII) was obtained from Shikoku Kasei and was used as received. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) was obtained from Nacalai Tesque. Other chemicals were used without further purification. TiO2 paste (PST-18NR) was purchased from JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 13 Ω □−1) was obtained from Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.

2.2. Fabrication of DSSCs and evaluation of dye loadings
In most experiments, two identical dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were prepared under the same experimental conditions: one was used for photovoltaic measurements and the other for the evaluation of dye loading. TiO2 paste was deposited on an FTO substrate by doctor-blading. The deposited TiO2 paste was sintered according to a temperature program (from room temperature to 450 °C for 50 min and at 450 °C for 35 min). After cooling the TiO2 electrode to 45 °C, the sintered electrode was immersed in THF solutions containing various concentrations of NI2 or NI4 to control the NI2 or NI4 loading on the TiO2 surface. Unless otherwise stated, the adsorption of NI2 and NI4 on TiO2 was made in THF solutions of 0.2 mM NI2 and 2 mM NI4, where dye loadings for NI2 and NI4 are similar to each other. In all the cases, the dye adsorption was performed for 18 hours in an incubator maintained at 25 °C. DSSCs were fabricated using one of the two as-prepared dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes, Pt-coated glass as a counter electrode, and a redox solution consisting of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.6 M DMPrII in MeCN. On the other hand, the other dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode was cautiously soaked in pure THF for several seconds and dye loading was determined by obtaining absorption spectra of a mixed solution (THF:DMSO:H2O (1 M NaOH) = 5:4:1, v/v/v), in which dye molecules deposited on TiO2 were desorbed for three hours. Time courses of absorption spectra of NI2 and NI4 in the mixed solutions are shown in Fig. S1† to demonstrate that both dyes are stable in the solutions. The thickness of the TiO2 film (0.5 × 0.5 cm2 in the photoactive area) was evaluated to be about 9 μm using a 3D-laser scanning microscope (Keyence VK-9700). A specific surface area of the sintered TiO2 electrode needed for the evaluation of dye loadings was determined by N2 adsorption experiments to be 83 m2 g−1.
2.3. Photovoltaic measurements
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were measured with a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HA-501G) under the irradiation of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 supplied by a solar simulator (Asahi Spectra HAL-302). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained under monochromatic irradiation from a tungsten–halogen lamp (150 W) and a monochromator with intensities of monochromatic lights at different wavelengths measured in advance using a thermopile (Eppley Type E6). The dependence of short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) on light intensity (P) was carefully measured, where a monochromatic light of 410 nm obtained from an interference filter (Toshiba Glass KL-41), a bandpass filter (Toshiba Glass B390), and a 500 W Xe lamp was used as a light source and the intensity was attenuated using neutral density filters. Intensities of the attenuated 410 nm light were measured using a Si photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics S1226-5BQ).
2.4. Spectroscopic measurements
Absorption and fluorescence spectra of NI2 and NI4 in solutions were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3150) and a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-4500), respectively.
2.5. Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in a MeCN/TBAP (0.1 M) solution using an air-tight electrolysis cell with a three-electrode system consisting of a Pt sphere as a working electrode, Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode, and a Pt wire as a counter electrode. CVs were recorded with a potentiostat equipped with a functional generator (Hokuto Denko HAB-151). Before electrochemical measurements were made, Ar gas was purged into the electrolyte solution to remove oxygen. Electrode potentials were referred to ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couples to evaluate HOMO and LUMO energy levels. All the electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature.
2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS measurements of DSSCs were performed with an impedance analyzer (VersaSTAT 3, PAR). To measure the impedance, a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV within the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz was applied in the dark. The observed impedance spectra were analyzed with a software (VersaStudio) to interpret the characteristics of the DSSCs.
2.7. Transient photovoltage technique
A light pulse of 0.1 ms duration generated by a light emitting diode (396 nm) was employed in transient photovoltage measurements in the DSSCs. The light pulse was incident on the FTO side of the DSSC and its intensity was controlled to keep the change of voltage within 2 mV. White bias light supplied by a halogen lamp (150 W) was also illuminated from the FTO side. The transient photovoltage decay was recorded on an oscilloscope (Iwatsu DS-4372) with an RC circuit (τ = 2.2 s) through a voltage amplifier (NF 5307).
3. Results and discussion
Spectroscopic and adsorption properties of NI2 and NI4 obtained earlier are summarized in Table 1 for reference.12,13,16 Reflecting a similarity of chemical structures, except for the anchor units between the two dye molecules, absorption and fluorescence wavelengths of the two dyes in 1,4-dioxane are similar to each other. Likewise, CV measurements of the dyes in MeCN showed that both NI2 and NI4 exhibit a reversible one-electron transfer process and their redox potentials are close to each other: 0.48 and 0.50 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for NI2 and NI4, respectively. Details of the CV measurements are given in the ESI (Fig. S2–S4†). Fig. 2 illustrates the energy level diagram for NI2- and NI4-DSSCs, evaluated with the spectroscopic and electrochemical data shown in Table 1. A small difference in the LUMO energy level is seen between NI2 and NI4. However, the LUMO energy difference of 0.11 eV may not affect the electron injection process in NI2- and NI4-DSSCs because both the LUMO levels are located sufficiently above the Ec of TiO2. Likewise, HOMO energy levels of the two dyes are close to each other and well below the Ef of the redox couple. These suggest that the combination of NI2 and NI4 used in this study can be an almost ideal example for discussing the difference between the anchor units. On the other hand, there is a marked difference in adsorbability between the dyes: 0.6 × 105 M−1 for NI2 adsorbed on Brønsted acid sites of TiO2 and 1.1 × 103 M−1 for NI4 adsorbed on Lewis acid sites.16

Fig. 3 depicts typical IPCE spectra and J–V curves of DSSCs based on NI2 and NI4, where the dye loadings on TiO2 (Cad) were 0.99 × 1013 cm−2 for NI2 and 0.92 × 1013 cm−2 for NI4. IPCE spectra measured with the same DSSCs as those used in Fig. 3b are similar in shape and the maximum IPCE value at ca. 400 nm is greater for NI2 than for NI4. It is interesting to note that in Fig. 3b, the Jsc for NI4 is higher than that for NI2, which is in agreement with our previous observation,12,13 although a larger Jsc value should be expected for NI2 because IPCE values of NI2 are greater than those obtained for NI4 over the whole wavelength range. Another salient feature to be noted here is a difference in open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) between NI4 (560 mV) and NI2 (500 mV), irrespective of there being no clear difference in J–V curves measured in the dark. This photovoltaic feature will be discussed later in detail.

To confirm the smaller IPCE but greater Jsc values for NI4 than those for NI2, detailed photovoltaic measurements for NI2- and NI4-DSSCs were conducted with Cad as a parameter. Fig. 4 summarizes changes of IPCE at 400 nm, Jsc, Voc, and energy conversion efficiency (η) with a change of Cad. As seen in Fig. 4a, IPCE values for both NI2 and NI4 increase gradually with the increase of Cad and tend to level off. Over the entire Cad range studied, IPCE values for NI2 are greater than those for NI4, which is in accordance with the IPCE spectra of Fig. 3a. Fig. 4b depicts plots of Jsc against Cad for NI2 and NI4. Similar to the plots of IPCE shown in Fig. 4a, Jsc values for both dyes increase with Cad and tend to saturate. Importantly, however, Jsc values for NI4 are obviously greater than those for NI2. This trend in Jsc is also consistent with the J–V curves shown in Fig. 3b under illumination. We also note that Jsc values reported earlier13 (filled circles in red and blue) do not deviate considerably from the experimental points obtained in this study. As shown in Fig. 4c, Voc values do not change much with Cad and they are ca. 50 mV greater for NI4 than for NI2 in the high Cad region. Moreover, the values of η calculated with the data of Jsc, Voc, and fill factor (ff, not shown here as there was no obvious difference between NI2 and NI4) as a function of Cad are illustrated in Fig. 4d, which show higher photovoltaic performances for NI4 weakly anchoring to Lewis acid sites of TiO2 than for NI2 bonding strongly to Brønsted acid sites.

We will now discuss some intriguing photovoltaic features of DSSCs based on NI2 and NI4. At first, to make the problem clearer, Jsc values are plotted against IPCE values at 400 nm, where the Jsc and IPCE data in Fig. 4a and b are used for making the plots. It is evident from Fig. 5 that the slope of the plot for NI4 is larger than that for NI2. This demonstrates that the photocurrent generation under intense illumination (Jsc, white light of 100 mW cm−2) relative to that under weak monochromatic illumination (IPCE, 400 nm light of ca. 1 μW cm−2) is efficient for NI4 compared with that for NI2. The dependencies of Jsc on the intensity of 410 nm light (P) for NI2- and NI4-DSSCs were examined over a wide range of P and the results are depicted in Fig. 6 as double logarithmic plots. Herein, Jsc values observed at the lowest intensity of 0.8 μW cm−2 are set to be equal. Both plots appear to fit straight lines with light exponents (γ in Jsc ∝ Pγ) almost close to unity over a change in P ranging from ca. 10−3 to 10 mW cm−2. On taking a closer look at the high intensity regime, shown in the inset of Fig. 6, however, we see that the data points for NI4 lie slightly above those for NI2. This indicates that the recombination loss in photocurrent generation is less enhanced by increasing the light intensity in the case of NI4 anchoring to Lewis acid sites than in the case of NI2 anchoring to Brønsted acid sites.

Inset denotes a magnified view of the main figure in a high light-intensity regime. 
Second interesting factor in the photovoltaic features of NI2- and NI4-DSSCs is the difference in Voc between NI2 and NI4, as illustrated in Fig. 3b and 4c: Voc values for NI4 are greater than those for NI2 when compared at the same Cad values. It is well known that the addition of TBP to the electrolyte solution leads to an increase in the Voc of the DSSC, which is sometimes followed by a considerable decrease in Jsc.27–29 The reason for the effect of additive TBP on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs has been discussed several times to date.30–32 Currently, the influence of TBP adsorbed on TiO2 is accounted for in terms of an upward shift of the conduction band of TiO2 due to the formation of a surface dipole layer or a suppression of dark currents by blocking the approach of I3− to the TiO2 surface. TBP, having a pyridyl group, may adsorb on Lewis acid sites of TiO2 like NI4. The influence of TBP is seemingly related to the larger Voc value for NI4 than that for NI2. However, it is worth noting that the J–V curves in the dark, as shown in Fig. 3b, do not differ considerably between NI2- and NI4-DSSCs. In addition, the adsorption of NI2 or NI4 on the TiO2 surface did not affect the J–V curves observed with the bare TiO2 electrode, although the addition of TBP to the electrolyte shifted the J–V curve by ca. 100 mV in a negative direction, as shown in Fig. 7. To further investigate properties of the TiO2 surfaces, EIS measurements of the DSSCs were carried out and the spectra were simulated, as shown typically in Fig. 8, using a simple equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 9.33 Here, Rs represents a series resistance due to the sheet resistance of the FTO substrate and the electrical contact at FTO/TiO2 interfaces, R1 is a charge transfer resistance at the Pt counter electrode, and R2 denotes a charge-transfer resistance related to the recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. CPE1 and CPE2 are constant phase elements corresponding to R1 and R2, respectively. Fig. 9 summarizes R2 values for the NI2- and NI4-DSSCs measured at various bias voltages in the dark. The R2 values for the two DSSCs decrease with the increase of the bias voltage with a negligible difference between them except at a bias voltage close to a flat-band potential of the TiO2 electrodes in contact with the I−/I3− redox solution. These findings demonstrate that the reason for NI4 to exhibit larger Voc values than NI2 is clearly different from the one for the enhancement of Voc due to the addition of TBP. Moreover, we note that near the flat-band potential of TiO2, the back reaction of electrons injected from the LUMO level of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2 with I3− in solution is less probable on the NI4-adsorbed TiO2 electrode than on the NI2-adsorbed TiO2, and this may be responsible for the difference in Voc between NI2- and NI4-DSSCs. To examine this possibility, the transient photovoltage technique was employed to evaluate an electron lifetime in the conduction band (τ) with photovoltage as a parameter.34,35 A typical photovoltage transient for the NI4-DSSC is depicted in Fig. 10a and the τ values obtained with the two dyes at different photovoltages are summarized in Fig. 10b. It is seen that the τ values for the NI2-DSSC are slightly greater than for the NI4-DSSC in the small photovoltage region, whereas they decrease with an increase of the photovoltage and the plots intercept at 250 mV. At higher photovoltages, the electron lifetimes for the NI4-DSSC are longer than for the NI2-DSSC, which is in accordance with our speculation that the back electron transfer for the NI4-DSSC is slow compared with that for the NI2-DSSC.

More elaborate studies will be needed for an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of charge-injection processes through Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. However, it is now quite clear that the adsorbability of a photosensitizing dye onto a TiO2 surface is not necessarily a principal factor for a high electron injection probability from dye to TiO2.
4. Conclusions
Photovoltaic features of DSSCs based on NI4 anchoring weakly to Lewis acid sites of a TiO2 surface are compared with those based on NI2 anchoring strongly to Brønsted acid sites by changing dye loadings on the TiO2 surface. In contrast to a conventional view, it is found that photocurrents observed under illumination of intense light are greater for NI4 than for NI2, although this is not the case under reduced illumination. The finding demonstrates that the adsorbability of a dye on a TiO2 surface is not necessarily a major factor for attaining a high injection probability of electrons from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. Another feature to be noted for NI4-DSSCs is its photovoltage, which is greater than that of NI2-DSSCs. The reason for the difference in photovoltage is ascribed to longer electron lifetimes for NI4-DSSCs than for NI2-DSSCs under intense illumination, on the basis of transient photovoltage measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
