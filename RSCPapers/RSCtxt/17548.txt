    , Accepted 1st January 2016First published on 4th January 2016AbstractNew PDT-based polymers were combined with two types of benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives to improve their crystallinity and solar cell performance. These polymers show several advantages, including strong intermolecular interactions, deep HOMO energy levels, and a dense packing structure with a short π–π stacking distance of 3.5–3.6 Å. Combinations of PDT and BT units in polymers formed highly crystalline thin films with a long-range order, even in films blended with a fullerene derivative. This suggests that the introduction of optimal acceptor units may increase the regularity of the polymers, leading to effective π–π overlaps between the polymer backbones. However, although the present polymers also formed an appropriate phase separation structure in blended films, in fabricated solar cell devices they yielded low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) not exceeding 3.8%. GI-WAXS analysis revealed that both polymers were present in a predominantly edge-on orientation. This unsuitable orientation for PSCs prevented efficient carrier transport and reduced charge collection efficiency, resulting in low Jsc and thus low PCE. On the other hand, these polymers also formed highly oriented edge-on structures on n+-Si/SiO2 substrates, which are suitable for high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs), and a fabricated FET device showed a hole mobility as high as 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
Solar cells have gained serious attention because they are the most useful, environmentally clean, and renewable energy source that can replace conventional fossil fuels. In a field with several contenders, semiconducting polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) are among the more promising candidates for next-generation solar-energy conversion because of their potential features, including light weight, flexibility and stretchability, a large area, a low cost, and low-energy manufacturing processes.1–6 In the last decade, various types of donor–acceptor (D–A) semiconducting polymers have been developed with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10% in single-junction solar cells.7–10 However, examples of such high-performance D–A polymers are somewhat limited, so the further development of new D–A polymers is a high priority.
When designing high-performance D–A polymers, the optimal combination of electron-donor and electron-acceptor units is quite important. Typically, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of D–A polymers are strongly influenced by the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.11–15 Thus one can tune the energy levels to obtain polymers with the desired strong and wide absorption range and deep HOMO energy levels. Other key factors for a high-performance PSC are crystallinity and a thin-film structure. Most high-performance polymers form highly crystalline solids with a strongly long-range-ordered structure that can transport charge carriers effectively.7,9,16–21 Moreover, such highly crystalline polymers tend to provide an optimal phase separation structure in bulk-heterojunction films, which can enhance both exciton dissociation efficiency and charge carrier mobility.22,23 Highly crystalline polymers must have a strong self-assembling tendency in the solid state.
With these factors in mind, we have focused on the development of highly extended π-electron systems and their incorporation into a polymer backbone to enhance intermolecular interactions. Recently, we have developed phenanthro[1,2-b:8,7-b′]dithiophene (PDT)24–27 as a new extended π-electron building unit, and PDT-based D–A polymers.28–30 These PDT-based polymers have strong intermolecular interactions, deep HOMO energy levels, and a dense π-stacking structure with a short π–π stacking distance of 3.5–3.6 Å, all features that are useful in PSCs. In fact, PDT-isoindigo copolymers with optimal side chains showed good solar-cell performance, with PCE over 5%29 and a good carrier transporting ability, with a hole mobility of up to 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.30 However, most PDT-based polymer films on an ITO/ZnO substrate have low crystallinity, in spite of an optimal phase separation structure, which may limit their device performance. In general, typical dyes/pigments such as diketopyrrolopyrrole or isoindigo have a strongly polarized core, which dramatically increases the intermolecular interactions of polymers.31,32 This requires a number of longer or bulkier alkyl side chains to ensure their solubility. However, the side chains often interfere with an effective π–π overlap, leading to low crystallinity.
In this study, we designed new PDT-based polymers (Scheme 1, P-PDT-(DF)BT-DT) combined with benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives to improve crystallinity and device performance. BT is one of the most widely used acceptor units for high-performance organic electronics, with a strong electron affinity and a deep HOMO energy level.7,12,15,19,21,33–47 In combination with PDT as a weak electron-donor unit, HOMO coefficients delocalize over the end of a PDT moiety, as is evident from DFT calculations on a model compound (vide infra). These target polymers can retain a deep HOMO energy level, and their HOMO orbital can enhance their intermolecular interactions. In addition, incorporation of a non-polar BT core into a PDT-based polymer backbone can improve solubility without any bulky solubilizing groups, potentially yielding high crystallinity. Moreover, adding a BT core to a PDT-based polymer backbone with C2v symmetry can increase regularity, so the alkyl side chains point in the same direction, which can enhance the effective π–π overlap to yield highly crystalline films.48,49 The BT core can easily have two fluorine atoms, yielding further enhancement of intermolecular interactions and deeper HOMO energy levels.19,21,50–53 Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of the new PDT-based polymers P1 and P2, containing BT or difluorinated BT (DFBT), and evaluate the relationship between device performance and specific structures and molecular orientations in the solid state.

Experimental
General
All the reactions were carried out under an Ar atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. Glassware was dried in an oven (130 °C) and heated under reduced pressure prior to use. Dehydrated solvents were purchased from Kanto Chemicals Co., Ltd. For thin layer chromatography (TLC) analyses throughout this work, Merck pre-coated TLC plates (silica gel60 GF254, 0.25 mm) were used. Silica gel column chromatography was carried out using Silica gel 60 N (spherical, neutral, 40–100 μm) from Kanto Chemicals Co., Ltd. The 1H and 19F{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA-600 (600 MHz) spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyser at Okayama University. Polymerization was performed with a Biotage initiator microwave reactor. Molecular weights of polymers were determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with a Senshu Scientific SSC-7120 using the polystyrene standards and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) as the eluent at 140 °C.

Monomers 3 (61.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) and 1 (113.1 mg, 0.10 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (2.3 mg, 2.0 μmol), and toluene (5 mL) were added into a reaction vessel. The vessel was sealed and refilled with argon, and was then placed in a microwave reactor and heated to 180 °C for 40 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction solution was poured into 100 mL of methanol containing 5 mL of hydrochloric acid and stirred for 12 h. The precipitate was then subjected to sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform to remove the low molecular weight fraction. The residue was extracted with chlorobenzene and precipitated in 100 mL of methanol.

Instrumentation and theoretical calculations
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out using a TG/DTA 6300 (SII Nanotechnology, Inc.) at 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Mettler Toledos DSC-1 at 10 °C min−1 for both heating and cooling steps. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded on an Electrochemical Analyser CHI-600B in acetonitrile containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAP, 0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A Pt electrode (surface area: A = 0.071 cm2, BAS), an Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag wire in 0.01 M AgNO3/0.1 M TBAP/CH3CN), and a Pt wire electrode were used as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. Samples of the polymer films were prepared by drop-cast on a working electrode from their chloroform solutions. All the potentials were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+: E1/2 = +0.08 V measured under identical conditions). Dynamic force mode atomic force microscopy was carried out using an SPA 400-DFM (SII Nano Technologies). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) analyses were carried out at SPring-8 on beamlines BL19B2 and BL46XU. The samples were irradiated at a fixed angle of the order of 0.12° through a Huber diffractometer with an X-ray energy of 12.39 keV (λ = 1 Å), and the GI-WAXS patterns were recorded on a 2D image detector (Pilatus 300 K). Films of the polymers with or without PC61BM were fabricated by spin-coating on the ZnO treated ITO substrate and octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTS) treated n+-Si/SiO2 substrate. Geometry optimizations and normal-mode calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using the Gaussian 09, Revision A.02, program package.58
Fabrication and characterization of solar cell devices
The inverted bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs were fabricated as follows. A ZnO precursor solution was prepared by hydrolysis of Zn(OAc)2.59 The ITO substrates (ITO, Geomatec Co. Ltd, thickness = 150 nm, sheet resistance <12 Ω sq−1, transmittance (λ = 550 nm) ≧ 85%) were successively washed using ultrasonication in a neutral detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min, respectively. Then the ITO substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. Pre-cleaned ITO substrates were spin-coated with 0.2 M ZnO precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then immediately baked at 200 °C for 30 min in air. After gradual cooling to room temperature, the substrates were rinsed with acetone and isopropanol. The substrates were dried and immediately transferred to a nitrogen filled glove box. A thin film of active layer was deposited by spin-coating from an anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) blended solution containing 7.5–10 mg mL−1 polymer samples with the same amount of PC61BM at 400 rpm for 30 s and 1000 rpm for 5 s. After drying the thin films, MoO3 (6 nm) as an anode interlayer and Ag (50 nm) were deposited under high vacuum (∼3 × 10−5 Pa) through the shadow mask. The active area of all devices was 0.16 cm2.
The characteristics of the solar cell devices were measured through a 4 × 4 mm photo-mask with a Keithley 2401 semiconducting analyser using a Xe lamp (Bunkokeiki OTENTO-SAN III type G2) as the light source under AM 1.5 G simulated solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 at room temperature under an inert atmosphere. The light intensity was determined by using a calibrated standard silicon solar cell (Bunkokeiki, BS-520BK). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a Bunkokeiki SM-250 hyper monolight system.
Fabrication and characterization of transistor devices
The typical bottom-gate top-contact OFET devices were fabricated as follows. All the processes, except for substrate cleaning, were performed under inert conditions. A heavily doped n-Si wafer with 200 nm-thick thermally grown SiO2 (Ci = 17.3 nF cm−2) as the dielectric layer was used as the substrate. The Si/SiO2 substrates were carefully cleaned using ultrasonication with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively. After drying the substrates, they were irradiated with UV-O3 for 20 min and then treated with octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTS) to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The active layers were deposited on the treated substrate by spin-coating from o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution (3 g L−1) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After drying or annealing at 250–300 °C for 30 min, a gold electrode (80 nm thick) was deposited through a shadow mask on the top of the active layer under reduced pressure (∼5 × 10−5 Pa). For a typical device, the source–drain channel length (L) and width (W) are 100 μm and ca. 2 mm, respectively.
The current–voltage characteristics of the OFET devices were measured at room temperature in air on a Keithley 6430 sub-femtoampere remote source meter combined with a Keithley 2400 measure-source unit. Field-effect mobilities in the saturation regime were calculated by using the following equation:ID = (WCi/2L)μ(VG − Vth)2where Ci is the capacitance of the SiO2 insulator, and VG, Vth, and ID are the gate and threshold voltages and the source–drain current, respectively. The current on/off ratio (Ion/off) was determined from a minimum ID at around VG = 0–10 V and a maximum ID at VG = −60 V. The parameters of all devices were collected from more than five different devices.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and GPC analysis of the polymers

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the two target copolymers using PDT and BT derivatives. The polymerization results are summarized in Table 1. Migita–Kosugi–Stille coupling of 1 and 3 afforded P1 as a soluble product in hot chlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the obtained polymer were 37.9 kDa and 1.70, sufficient for use in organic electronic devices. In contrast, when P2 was synthesized by copolymerization of 2 with 3 under the same conditions, the obtained polymer was completely insoluble, even in hot chlorobenzene. Then we optimized the polymerization conditions to yield soluble P2. Copolymerization at low temperature with a different catalyst system yielded soluble P2 in 90% yield. The number-average molecular weight of the obtained P2 is 15.9 kDa, approximately half that of P1. These results indicate that increased coplanarity of PDT-BT polymers may enhance intermolecular interactions, but significantly decrease solubility.

Physicochemical properties
TGA and DSC measurements were performed to evaluate thermal stability (Fig. S1 and S2‡). The 5% weight loss temperatures (T5d) of the obtained polymers are 317 °C for P1 and 309 °C for P2, respectively. In addition, transition peaks such as glass transition and melting point were not observed up to 250 °C, indicating high thermal stability for both polymers.
Depicted in Fig. 1 are UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chlorobenzene and as thin films. Both P1 and P2 exhibited a broad absorption range around 700 nm with respective optical energy gaps of 1.63 and 1.65 eV as thin films. The fluorine-substituted polymer P2 had slightly blue-shifted spectra and a larger energy gap than P1, as typically seen in fluorine-containing polymers.53,60 While the spectrum of P1 in the solid state is slightly red-shifted as compared to that in solution, three shoulder peaks at 560, 601, and 651 nm disappeared and a significantly blue-shifted spectrum was observed when heated to ca. 80 °C, which reflects the complete disaggregation of the polymer. In contrast, the spectrum of P2 in solution at room temperature is almost identical to that of its thin film. In addition, two defined peaks derived from vibronic transitions remained in the hot chlorobenzene solution, implying that P2 forms large aggregates even in a very high-temperature solution. This indicates that P2 has stronger intermolecular interactions than P1.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in chlorobenzene solution and in thin films. 
To investigate the effect of fluorine atoms on the electronic structure of the polymers, we measured their cyclic voltammograms (CV) in the solid state (Fig. S3‡); extracted parameters are summarized in Table 2. Both P1 and P2 showed clear oxidation and weak reduction peaks. The estimated LUMO energy level of P2 is −3.70 eV, which is slightly lower than that of P1 (−3.66 eV). This might represent an enhancement of its electron affinity due to the introduction of fluorine, but both polymers have sufficiently low LUMO energy levels for charge separation and electron transfer without any energy loss. The HOMO energy level of P2 (−5.42 eV) was also deeper than that of P1 (−5.28 eV), owing to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the two fluorine atoms. Therefore, a P2-based PSC would be expected to show a higher Voc, because Voc generally depends on the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor polymer and the LUMO of fullerene derivatives.61

The molecular orbital distribution and dihedral angle of the polymers were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G(d) using their dimer structure as the model compound (Fig. 2). The LUMO orbital of both polymers is well localized on the benzothiadiazole moiety, while the HOMO coefficient of both polymers is delocalized over the polymer backbone. This tendency is typical of D–A polymers with weak donor and strong acceptor moieties.62 Both HOMO and LUMO coefficients are also delocalized on fluorine atoms, which may stabilize HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In fact, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the model compound in P2 (−5.14 and −2.74 eV) are lower than those of P1 (−5.02 and −2.67 eV), which is consistent with the results of CV measurements. Because of steric crowding between the sulfur atoms of PDT and the alkyl side chains on the thiophene spacer, the dihedral angle between PDT and thiophene in both polymers is 23–24°. On the other hand, the fluorinated polymer P2 has a smaller dihedral angle (0.3°) between thiophene and benzothiadiazole units than P1 (4.6°), owing to the substitution of relatively small fluorine atoms and the influence of an F⋯S interaction.50 This higher coplanarity of P2 can enhance the intermolecular π-orbital overlap adjacent to the polymer backbone. Thus, P2 should display stronger intermolecular interactions, which is in good agreement with UV-vis absorption measurements.

Characteristics of inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cells
To investigate the solar cell performance of the polymers, inverted bulk-heterojunction solar cell devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/(P1 or P2:PC61BM)/MoO3 (6 nm)/Ag (50 nm) were fabricated and characterized. Fig. 3a shows typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5 G simulated solar irradiation of the fabricated solar cells at 1 sun (100 mW cm−2), and their best photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table 3. The P1-based inverted cell exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.48%, with a Jsc of 7.35 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.71 V, and an FF of 0.67. On the other hand, the P2-based cell showed a slightly higher PCE of 3.79% with a Jsc of 7.96 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V, and an FF of 0.59, though the P2 had a lower molecular weight. In general, solar cell performance depends strongly on the molecular weight of the polymer, and a cell using low molecular-weight polymers often shows poor photovoltaic properties.41,63–65 As expected from the deep HOMO energy levels estimated by CV measurements, the P2-based cell showed a higher Voc than that of the P1-based cell. From the EQE spectra in Fig. 3b, although the EQE values of both polymer-based cells around 500–700 nm were almost the same (∼45%), the EQE in the shorter wavelength region of P2 was about 10% higher than that of P1, resulting in a higher Jsc. Although P2 thin films have weak absorption at around 400 nm relative to the P1 thin film, the higher EQE of the P2-based cell in the shorter wavelength region may contribute to higher photocurrent conversion from PC61BM, likely owing to the difference of their morphologies. These results indicate that the substitution of fluorine atoms for hydrogens can enhance the photovoltaic performance of a PDT-based polymer system. However, the solar cell performance of these PDT-based polymers is still lower than that of previously reported PDT-IID copolymers.29 The main reason for their lower performance is the relatively low Jsc (∼8 mA cm−2) in these polymer-based cells compared with typical high-performance D–A polymers,11–15 and approximately 50% of incident light did not contribute to the photocurrent conversion, as is evident from their EQE spectra.

To gain an insight into the effect of the polymers’ morphology, we investigated the surface morphology of the two polymers in films blended with PC61BM by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. Topological images of both P1 and P2 blended films showed a uniform structure with a texture displaying small spherical shapes on the surface. The P2/PC61BM film, with a root-mean-square unevenness of 2.87 nm, is rougher than the P1/PC61BM film (RMS = 0.88 nm), but both films have well-separated structures (domain size: 10–40 nm) with an optimal interpenetrating network. This appropriate micro-phase separation structure is likely to enable efficient charge separation and carrier transport,22,23,66 which will not limit their PCE.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) analysis of polymer/PC61BM blended films
To understand the detailed molecular orientation and packing structure of these two polymers, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) analysis was performed (Fig. 5).67 The P1/PC61BM film fabricated on an ITO/ZnO substrate exhibited three orders of (h00) diffraction at 0.304 Å−1 on the qz axis as spots, which corresponds to the lamellar structure of the polymers. In addition, ring-shaped (010) diffraction was observed from P1 blended films at 1.73 Å−1 along both the qz and qxy axes. These diffractions indicate that P1 formed predominantly with an edge-on orientation, but the randomly oriented crystallite derived from the π–π stacking structure also coexisted. In contrast, the P2/PC61BM film on the ITO/ZnO substrate showed intense (h00) diffraction up to the fourth order at 0.310 Å−1 on the qz axis, and obvious (010) diffraction at 1.78 Å−1 on the qxy axis, although its diffraction peaks were slightly disordered. Furthermore, its interlayer distances in the lamellar (dlm = 20.3 Å) and π–π stacking structures (dπ = 3.53 Å) as estimated from diffraction became shorter than those of P1 (dlm = 20.7 Å and dπ = 3.63 Å). This indicates that the introduction of fluorine atoms can enhance the crystallinity and suppress the disordering of molecular orientation. This may be due to strong intermolecular interactions induced by the strong dipole along the C–F bonds and the increased coplanarity of the polymer main chain. Among a number of synthesized PDT-based polymers,28–30P2 has the highest crystallinity in blended films on an ITO/ZnO substrate. This indicates that we can improve the crystallinity of PDT-based polymers by incorporating optimal acceptor units into the polymer backbone.

However, the predominantly edge-on orientation of both P1 and P2 is not suitable for solar cells.68–70 In the case of P1, the solar cell showed a high FF of 0.67 owing to the existence of a face-on crystallite along the π–π stacking direction in P1 films, but its FF and Jsc decreased significantly in thick films. In contrast, the FF of P2-based cells was relatively low (0.59) even with thin films. Therefore, the highly oriented edge-on structure of these polymers, in particular, P2 may prevent efficient carrier transport and reduce charge collection efficiency, resulting in low Jsc and thus low PCE.
Characteristics of field-effect transistor devices
Since both PDT-based polymers adopted an unsuitable orientation for solar cells, we could not obtain high-performance PSCs. However, such a highly ordered edge-on orientation, with long-range order, is promising for high-performance organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). To evaluate their potential as OFET materials, we fabricated and characterized typical bottom-gate top-contact OFETs with a 2 mm channel width (W) and a channel length (L) of 100 μm. n-Octadecyltriethoxysilane (ODTS) was used as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). The highest device performances were obtained by thermal annealing at 250 °C for P1 and 300 °C for P2. Fig. 6 shows the best transfer and output curves, and the extracted device parameters are summarized in Table 4. Both OFET devices showed typical p-channel FET characteristics with a relatively low threshold voltage (Vth) of around −10 V. These devices also showed high on/off ratios up to 106 under ambient conditions, indicating high air-stability owing to their deep HOMO energy levels. Like the PSC, the P2-based OFET showed much higher performance than P1, with a hole mobility as high as 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1. AFM images of these polymer films on an ODTS-treated n+-Si/SiO2 substrate were quite different (Fig. S4‡). The copolymer P2 formed large crystalline grains and showed significant roughness (RMS 6.24 nm), while P1 had a relatively smooth surface (RMS 0.81 nm). The continuous structure and large crystalline grains in P2 films can provide an efficient channel and promote carrier transport. Therefore, P2-based OFETs exhibited higher hole mobility than P1-based ones.

GI-WAXS analysis of polymer films on n+-Si/SiO2 substrate
GI-WAXS was used to refine our understanding of the molecular arrangements of P1 and P2 (Fig. 7). In P1 films on the ODTS-treated n+-Si/SiO2 substrate, intense (h00) diffraction up to the fourth order was observed on the qz axis and (010) diffraction on the qxy axis. Both diffractions appeared in opposite directions as very short arcs, indicating that face-on and edge-on arrangements coexisted in the P1 film. The edge-on content was over 98%, roughly calculated from the intensities of the (100) diffraction in each direction, clearly showing a preferential edge-on orientation. In contrast, the P2 film also exhibited fourth-order lamellar diffraction on the qz axis and obvious π–π stacking diffraction, but no peaks derived from face-on orientation were observed. In addition, the lamellar distance (dlm) and π–π stacking distance (dπ) were 20.3 Å and 3.53 Å, shorter than in P1. The good ordering and dense packing structure of P2 provide effective carrier transport, resulting in higher hole mobility than in P1. However, weak and arc-like peaks were observed in the (h00) diffraction, which suggests that the P2 film was contaminated with some slightly disordered crystallite. This may be due to the low molecular weight of P2, which typically affects the crystallinity and orientation mode of semiconducting polymers.63 If we can improve the molecular weight of P2, we believe that developing a higher performance OFET device will be possible.

Conclusions
We have synthesized new PDT-based semiconducting polymers that include benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives. As in previous reports on PDT-based polymers, P1 and P2 have strong intermolecular interactions and sufficiently deep HOMO energy levels for high-performance PSCs. In particular, fluorine-substituted P2 showed very strong aggregation behavior, but this feature limited its solubility, leading to a low molecular weight. When a BT unit with C2v symmetry was incorporated into the polymer backbone, the present polymers formed a highly crystalline structure with a short π-stacking distance (3.53 Å) and well-ordered structure, even in films blended with PC61BM. We demonstrated that the introduction of an optimal acceptor moiety can increase the regularity of PDT-based polymers and enhance their π-orbital overlap with a neighboring polymer's main chain, leading to high crystallinity. However, the present polymer-based inverted PSCs showed a low PCE not exceeding 3.8% due to their low Jsc (∼8 mA cm−2), though they formed appropriate micro-phase separation structures. Their low solar cell performance is largely attributable to their molecular orientation in blended films. GI-WAXS analysis showed both polymers forming well-ordered crystallites in a predominantly edge-on manner, which is not a suitable orientation for high-performance PSCs, resulting in low Jsc and PCE.
On the other hand, a P2-based OFET device showed a high hole mobility of up to 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 owing to its optimal structure for OFETs. Its highly crystalline and dense packing structure can promote efficient carrier transport in OFET devices. However, a slightly disordered structure also coexisted in P2 films on n+-Si/SiO2 substrates, caused by its low molecular weight, which may limit P2-based OFET performance. Therefore, further improvement in polymer structures is required for high-performance electronic devices. For example, the introduction of a longer branched alkyl chain at a different branching point may increase the solubility of the polymers without changing their molecular orientation or decreasing their crystallinity.71 For PSCs, increasing the side chain attachment density on the polymer backbone is an effective strategy to create a face-on orientation.70 Thus, further modification of PDT-containing polymers is currently in progress.
