    , Accepted 19th February 2020First published on 20th February 2020AbstractMixed-dimensional binary heterostructures, especially 0D/2D heterostructures, have attracted significant attention due to their unique physical properties. In this contribution, 0D bismuth quantum dots (Bi QDs, VA) are immobilized onto 2D Te nanosheets (Te NSs, VIA) to prepare Bi QDs/Te NSs binary heterostructures (Bi/Te) through a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method. The results from both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the enhanced photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te-based photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type photodetectors (PDs). The as-prepared PDs exhibit a high photocurrent of 18.21 μA cm−2, significantly higher than those of previously reported pristine Bi QD and Te NS-based PDs. The PDs are further demonstrated to have excellent self-power capability and long-term stability over 30 days. Additionally, the obtained 786 fs pulse output signal in the telecommunications band reveals the great potential of Bi/Te for ultrafast photonic devices. It is believed that such VA/VIA binary heterostructures provide opportunities for developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices for nano-science applications.

New concepts
Mixed-dimensional heterostructures have been considered as one of the most valuable research focuses for nano-science and nanotechnology. Lots of previous studies have demonstrated the great potential of mixed-dimensional heterostructures for constructing new generation devices with multiple functions. In this work, we introduce a mixed-dimensional (0D bismuth quantum dots/2D tellurium nanosheets) V–VIA binary heterostructure (Bi/Te) through a cost-effective and facile hydrothermal method. Nondegenerate transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the enhanced photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te and the effective separation of photoexcited electrons/holes in Bi/Te, suggesting the advantages of Bi/Te for optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, Bi/Te was applied for photoelectrochemical-type photodetection and was embedded in erbium-doped fiber ring resonators as a saturable absorber (SA) of ultrashort pulsed lasers. The excellent photo-response behaviors, long-term stability, and short pulse width of the mode-locked pulse demonstrate that Bi/Te is a promising material for fabricating optoelectronic devices. The integration of 0D/2D Bi/Te binary heterostructures and their studies provide a new concept and fundamental information to construct multifunctional optoelectronic devices with elements from groups VA and VIA.

Introduction
The last two decades have witnessed the breakthrough discovery of two-dimensional (2D) layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, ranging from hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),1 graphene,2 and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)3 to a number of mono-elemental 2D materials.4–8 Among them, lots of mono-elemental 2D materials from groups VA and VIA, such as black phosphorene,9,10 bismuthene,11 and tellurene,12 have been successfully prepared and demonstrated with fascinating optical and electronic properties, thus making them widely explored in logic circuits,13 field effect transistors (FETs),14,15 light-emitting diodes,16 and photodetectors (PDs).17–20 While striving to develop mono-elemental 2D materials, a variety of methods, involving element doping,21 surface chemical functionalization,22 and integration of binary heterostructures,23,24 have been adopted and provided new perspectives to improve their properties and further applications.
Heterostructures, especially the combination of materials from groups VA and VIA, have been demonstrated as a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of individual building blocks and to develop ideal multifunctional electronic and optoelectronic devices.25,26 For example, roll to roll 1D heterostructures of tellurium nanotubes (VIA) and selenium (VIA) were fabricated by Zhang et al., and the as-prepared PDs show enhanced photo-response behaviors and stability.27 All 2D heterostructures composed of black arsenic (VA) and phosphorus (VA) have been demonstrated as an efficient donor for excitonic solar cells (XSCs) due to the high carrier mobility of 14000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1%.28 However, it remains a challenge to fabricate binary heterostructures with elements from VA and VIA. In addition, the carrier concentration, doping type, stoichiometry of each component, and preparation on a large scale are required to be further explored.29
Alternatively, mixed-dimensional heterostructures, especially 0D (quantum dots, QDs)/2D (nanosheets, NSs) heterostructures, have attracted considerable attention and have been widely explored in optoelectronic devices.30,31 QDs usually serve as electron donors and sensitizers, while 2D NSs are promising candidates for optoelectronic devices.32 QDs exhibit small size (<10 nm), large surface area, short effective charge-transfer length, high extinction coefficients, size-tunable optoelectronics, and excellent photochemical stability, which endow them with special optical and electronic properties and make them reliable for many research fields.33–36 The integration of 0D QDs with 2D NSs to prepare 0D/2D heterostructures can reduce the disadvantages of QDs and improve the performance of optoelectronic devices to some extent.37 For instance, loading QDs on NSs can make QDs well dispersed on the surface of NSs, thereby preventing the QDs from self-aggregating.38 Furthermore, the accelerated charge transfer, produced by NSs, can effectively quench the generated photoluminescence phenomenon from QDs, thus inhibiting the recombination of photo-induced carriers.31,39 The built-in electric field, newly emerged at the interface of QDs and NSs, can boost the transmission and separation of photo-induced electron/hole pairs, which can further enhance the optoelectronic performance.40–42 It is expected that 0D/2D heterostructures can fully utilize the merits of each component to obtain a pronounced performance.
In this contribution, bismuth QDs (Bi QDs, VA)/tellurium NSs (Te NSs, VIA) binary heterostructures (Bi/Te) were achieved through a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method and applied for photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type photodetection and telecommunications band mode-locked lasers. Benefiting from the synergistic effects induced by the coupling between Bi QDs and Te NSs, such as the enhanced optical absorption and the created built-in electric field, the performance of the Bi/Te-based PD is significantly improved. The carrier dynamics of Bi/Te, studied by nondegenerate transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, reveal the potential of Bi/Te in fast response optoelectronic devices. The results from both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the enhanced photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te and the effective separation of photoexcited electrons/holes, which can greatly improve the performance of optoelectronic devices. The highest photocurrent (Pph) value of 18.21 μA cm−2 can be obtained from Bi/Te-based PDs, which is 18 and 136 times higher than those of pristine Bi QD43 and Te NS-based PDs.44 Besides, the as-prepared PDs also show excellent photodetection capability with a remarkable Pph of 7.99 μA cm−2 and a fast response time of 0.02 s at a bias potential of 0 V, indicating the great potential for self-power optoelectronic applications. The obvious ON/OFF signals of the PDs, after being immersed in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte for 30 days, demonstrate the preeminent long-term stability of Bi/Te. In addition, Bi/Te was further embedded in erbium-doped fiber (EDF) ring resonators as a saturable absorber (SA) of ultrashort pulsed lasers, and a 786 fs pulse output signal was obtained at 1.5 μm, revealing that Bi/Te is a promising material for ultrafast photonic devices. We deem that this strategy of fabricating mixed-dimensional V–VIA binary heterostructures provides a new way to prepare multifunctional nanocomposites for new generation optoelectronic applications in the future.
Results and discussion
The details of the preparation of Te NSs and Bi/Te binary heterostructures can be found in the Experimental section (ESI†). Fig. 1a and b show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Te NSs. It can be seen that the Te NSs show a large surface area (over 2 μm × 10 μm), which is an ideal substrate for loading Bi QDs (<10 nm). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been performed to measure the thickness of the synthesized Te NSs as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the thickness of the Te NSs ranges from 12.8 to 22.3 nm, and the aspect ratio of length/thickness for Te NSs ranges from 1500 to 5500. Fig. 1c shows the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of Te NSs, and the lattice spacing is calculated to be 0.19 nm, corresponding to the (200) plane of Te (PDF card no. 36-1452). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1d) demonstrates the good crystallinity of Te NSs. Fig. 1e and f exhibit the as-prepared Bi/Te under different magnifications, and it can be seen that a large number of Bi QDs show a granular structure and are well distributed on the surface of Te NSs with diameters ranging from 3 to 6 nm. Fig. 1g shows the HR-TEM image of Bi/Te, and typical lattice spacings of 0.19 nm and 0.33 nm are identified, which can be assigned to the (113) and (012) planes of Bi (PDF card no. 44-1246). The captured SAED pattern in Fig. 1h further reveals the existence of Bi QDs. The high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM, Fig. 1i) and the mapping images of a single Bi/Te (Fig. 1j–l) indicate the successful preparation of Bi/Te with the outer Bi QDs and inner Te NSs, and the detailed information from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) obtained from area #1 is listed in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

The optical absorption of Bi/Te was investigated using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Fig. 2a). It can be seen that the optical absorption of Bi/Te is obviously enhanced from 300 to 800 nm in comparison with those of pristine Bi QDs and Te NSs. Raman spectra were further recorded to study the changes after the loading of Bi QDs on Te NSs as shown in Fig. 2b. For pristine Te NSs, two typical vibrational modes located at 121 and 141 cm−1 can be detected, which can be assigned to the A1 and E2 peaks of Te NSs.45 For the prepared Bi/Te, two additional peaks can be detected at 68.9 and 95.3 cm−1 which can be attributed to the first-order Raman modes Eg and A1g of Bi QDs and is consistent with a previously reported work.46 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied to examine the structure of Bi/Te as shown in Fig. 2c. Typical characteristic diffraction peaks of [101], [012], and [104] for Bi (PDF card no. 44-1246) and peaks of [101], [110], and [201] for Te (PDF card no. 36-1452) can be detected, indicating the successful preparation of Bi/Te. Fig. 2d shows the survey X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of Bi/Te, and the presence of impurities of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, located at 285, 400, and 532 eV, respectively, can be explained by the original materials used in the fabrication processes. The regions of Te 3d and Bi 4f are fitted and shown in Fig. 2e and f; two obvious peaks with binding energies of around 572.9 and 583.2 eV can be observed, which are assigned to Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2, respectively.47 Only two peaks with binding energies of 157.1 (Bi 4f7/2) and 162.8 eV (Bi 4f5/2) can be detected in Fig. 2f, which is similar to a previously reported work.48 No additional peaks of TeO2 and Bi2O3 can be found in both the XRD pattern and XPS spectra. Additionally, Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the O 1s region and no additional peak for metal oxides (TeO2 or Bi2O3) can be found, indicating that the fresh Bi/Te is made up of elemental Te and Bi, and the vdW forces are mainly established between Bi QDs and Te NSs. After the Bi/Te was placed in an ambient environment for 7 days, as shown in Fig. S3b–d (ESI†), the typical peak of metal oxides could be detected in the O 1s spectrum, and the TeO2 and Bi2O3 peaks could also be observed, suggesting oxygen contamination.

It is known that an ultrafast carrier dynamics analysis of 2D materials provides important parameter values that determine their potential for applications in optoelectronic devices. In traditional optoelectronic devices, the response speed of the devices is mainly determined by the lifetime.49,50 Promoting the separation of electron–hole pairs and long diffusion length is very important to improve the performance of the device.51,52 Herein, a femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectrometer was used to further investigate the excitation and cooling dynamics of Bi/Te and the details of the experiments can be found in the Experimental section (ESI†). Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the colorful TA spectrum in which a broadband photoinduced absorption (PIA) signal of Bi/Te can be observed. As shown in Fig. 2g, the TA spectra of Bi/Te with delay times of 20 ps, 350 ps and 1 ns were recorded. The positive TA signal was caused by the excited state absorption, and the initial ultra-fast positive signal can be attributed to the response of the solvent. It can be seen that the TA signal can reach its maximum value in a time of about 20 ps, and such extended rise time can be attributed to the interaction of the TA signal between Bi QDs and Te NSs. The carrier dynamics of excitation and cooling at 550 nm, 650 nm and 700 nm are shown in Fig. 2h. A two-exponential function was used to fit the cooling dynamics curve at 550 nm, and the time constant was calculated to be 255 ps. As presented in Fig. 2i, kinetic curves were collected over dozens of picoseconds (0–30 ps), and a longer rise time was detected. The superior TA response of Bi/Te indicates its great potential in optoelectronic devices.
Furthermore, DFT calculations were performed to explore the detailed electronic structure and enhanced optical properties of Bi/Te. The relaxed configuration of Bi/Te is presented in Fig. 3a. A 7 × 5 × 1 supercell of the Te NSs (105 Te atoms), with a Bi QD (66 Bi atoms) located on its surface, is adopted to model the structure of Bi/Te. The partial density of states (PDOS) and wave function squares of the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) states of pristine Te monolayer and Bi/Te are shown in Fig. 3b and c. For pristine Te NS, both VBM and CBM are mainly contributed by the Te 5p orbitals and are distributed over the entire Te NSs (Fig. 3c). In Bi/Te, the Bi states and Te states are strongly hybridized (see Fig. 3b), with both VBM and CBM (see Fig. 3c for their distribution across the heterostructure) mainly dominated by Bi 6p and Te 5p orbitals. The optical transition between Bi states and Te states across the Bi/Te heterostructure could significantly contribute to the optoelectronic process, as well as the transition between different Bi states. As shown in Fig. 3d, in comparison to pristine Te, the optical absorption coefficient of the Bi/Te heterostructure increases in the whole region from the infrared region, passing the visible region, to the ultraviolet region, especially in the ultraviolet region where the absorption intensity of Bi/Te exhibits a big enhancement. Furthermore, in comparison with pristine Te, the Bi/Te heterostructure can effectively separate photoexcited electrons and holes and improve the performance of photoelectronic devices. Particularly, in light of the strong hybridization of the delocalized Te states with the extended Bi states (see Fig. 3b and c), the hole (electron) wave function could temporarily distribute around the Bi QD avoiding recombination with the electron (hole) in the Te NS, and then spread into the Te NS after the electron (hole) moves away. This breathing-like process could help avoid electron–hole recombination and significantly increase the photocurrent. The distribution of the VBM and CBM states in the Bi/Te heterostructure (Fig. 3c) also suggests that the chemical reactions involving loss (from VBM) or gain (to CBM) of electrons would prefer to proceed from the interface of the Bi QD and Te sheet energetically. It is known that the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional usually underestimates the band gap.53 However, the band gap value of Bi quantum dots could be sensitive to their sizes since Bi is a band-inverted metallic material,54–56 analogous to HgTe nanostructures.57 It is out of the scope of the current paper to systematically study the dependence of the band gap of Bi quantum dots on their sizes. To demonstrate the sensitive size dependence of band gaps of Bi/Te nanostructures and the error by the PBE approach in bandgap calculations, we performed PBE-HSE0658,59 as well as PBE calculations of density of states for a small Bi/Te structure with 16 Bi atoms and 36 Te atoms. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the band gaps from PBE-HSE06 and PBE are 0.348 eV and 0.133 eV, respectively. It is interesting that the PBE band gap of the smaller Bi/Te structure (0.133 eV) is much smaller than that of the larger Bi/Te structure in Fig. 3b (0.673 eV). The calculated optical absorption coefficients are also affected by the potential errors on band gaps. Despite of the intriguing band gaps of Bi/Te structures, we identify analogous features for the smaller (16 Bi atoms and 36 Te atoms) and larger (62 Bi atoms and 144 Te atoms) structures from PBE-HSE06 and PBE calculations, i.e. semiconducting properties and strong hybridization between Te states and Bi states at band edges. However, the HSE06 calculations for large nanostructures are too time consuming. Hence, we use the PBE calculations to infer the basic optoelectronic properties of the Te–Bi heterostructures, focusing on the hybridization state of 2D Te and 0D Bi and the semiconducting feature, but not the actual band gap values. In addition, Fig. S6 (ESI†) illustrates the band alignment of 2D Te and Bi, indicating the formation of a type II hetero-junction between Te and Bi layers with the same thickness as adopted in our mixed-dimensional heterostructure calculations. The redistribution of the intrinsic carriers in Te and Bi of the type II heterostructure will lead to a common Fermi level and a built-in electric field. The photo-generated electron/hole pairs could change the carrier distribution and the built-in electric field dynamically. Under illumination, photoexcited electrons and holes will diffuse in opposite directions. With the continuous transportation of electrons and holes, immanent positive and negative charges are fixed around the interfaces, which can generate the extra built-in electric field at the interface.60 The built-in electric field can promote photoinduced electron–hole pair separation and suppress the rapid recombination of carriers. In type II hetero-junction-based devices, the photocurrent can flow and recirculate multiple times in their lifetimes, resulting in an enhancement of photo-response behaviors. It is also worth noting that Bi atoms are exposed to the external environments in the Bi/Te structure, which provides more possibilities of electronic structure modulation of the Bi/Te heterostructure by surface functionalization or by external fields. Therefore, the obtained calculations demonstrate that the formation of Bi/Te heterostructures could effectively enhance their photo-response behaviors, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results discussed below.

The Bi/Te was further used as the working electrode in a PEC-type photodetection system to study the photo-response behaviors. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test of Bi/Te in the dark and under simulated light (SL, 300–800 nm, level IV). It can be seen that the current shows an increasing trend with the increased bias potential and no obvious peaks can be found from 0 to 1.0 V, suggesting that the Bi/Te can remain stable under the applied bias potential (0 to 0.6 V) in this work. The photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te-based PDs were first examined in 0.5 M HCl, KCl, and KOH electrolytes with a bias potential of 0.6 V (Fig. S8a, ESI†). The as-prepared PD shows higher performance in the KOH electrolyte than that in the HCl and KCl electrolytes, thus we mainly focused on the photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te-based PDs in the KOH electrolyte with different concentrations in this work. In addition, pristine Bi QD and Te NS-based PDs were further adopted as references to observe the enhanced performance after the formation of Bi/Te as shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†). The values of Pph, photoresponsivity (Rph), and specific detectivity (D*, Jones or cm Hz1/2 W−1) can be obtained according to the equations below, which are the main parameters to evaluate the performance of PDs.44,61 Pph = (Ilight − Idark)/S(1) Rph = Pph/Pλ(2) D* = Rph × S1/2/(2q × Idark)1/2(3)where Ilight and Idark mean the current with and without light, respectively; Pλ is the light power density; S is the effective area of Bi/Te under illumination; and q is the electron charge constant with a value of 1.60 × 10−19 C. The detailed values of Pph, Rph, and D* under different experimental conditions are calculated according to eqn (1)–(3) and are listed in Table 1. It can be noted that the Bi/Te-based PD shows a Pph of 17.79 μA cm−2 at level IV with a bias potential of 0.6 V in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte, which is about 6 and 32 times as high as that of Bi QD (2.93 μA cm−2) and Te NS (0.55 μA cm−2)-based PDs, suggesting that the preparation of Bi/Te is a promising way to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices in PEC-type photodetection systems. As demonstrated by the experiments and DFT calculations above, Bi/Te shows higher optical absorption than both Bi QDs and Te NSs, which can generate more holes and electrons under the same conditions and lead to enhanced photo-response behaviors. Besides, the generated built-in electric field, emerged at the interface of Bi QDs and Te NSs, can efficiently facilitate the transmission and separation of photo-induced electron/hole pairs and restrain the carriers from recombination, which can also lead to an obvious enhancement of Pph.62,63

Fig. 4a and b show the photo-response behaviors of the PDs in 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. The different Pλ values are labelled as levels I, II, III, IV, and V in each case, and the details of Pλ are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be found that the Bi/Te-based PDs show better performance in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte at a bias potential of 0.6 V. The Pph increases from 0.1 to 0.5 M KOH electrolyte, which can be ascribed to the increased conductive ions in the electrolyte and the decreased interfacial resistance as shown in Fig. 4c.64 However, in spite of the lower surface resistance obtained in higher concentration KOH electrolytes (1.0 M), the prolonged measurement can cause Bi/Te to peel off from the coated ITO glass and lead to an undesired negative electrochemical correlation, thus resulting in the decrease of Pph from 0.5 to 1.0 M KOH electrolytes.44,65Fig. 4d shows the curve of Pph as a function of Pλ under different experimental conditions in this work. It can be seen that the Pph shows an obvious increasing trend with the continuously increased Pλ in each case, for example, the Pph increases from 3.46 μA cm−2 (level I) to 5.80 (level II), 8.15 (level III), 9.32 (level IV), and 9.95 μA cm−2 (level V) in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte at a bias potential of 0.3 V, respectively, and the highest Pph is calculated to be 18.21 μA cm−2 at level V at a bias potential of 0.6 V, which is 18 and 136 times higher than those of pristine Bi QD43 and Te NS-based PDs.44 Besides, the PD also shows remarkable photodetection capability at a bias potential of 0 V, and the Pph can reach up to 7.99 μA cm−2 under SL at level IV, indicating that Bi/Te-based PDs have self-power capability. The Rph of Bi/Te-based PDs is calculated to be 150.75 μA W−1, which is much higher than those of Bi QD (24.83 μA W−1) and Te NS (4.66 μA W−1)-based PDs. Additionally, the highest D* of Bi/Te-based PDs is calculated to be 5.19 × 109 Jones in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte with a bias potential of 0.6 V under SL according to eqn (3), which significantly outperforms Bi QD (2.46 × 108 Jones) and Te NS-based (4.31 × 107 Jones) PEC-type PDs under the same conditions. The comparison of Bi/Te with the state-of-the-art performance of PEC-type photodetectors based on low-dimensional materials is presented in Table S2 (ESI†) to better evaluate the performance of the Bi/Te-based PDs. It can be seen that the prepared Bi/Te-based PD shows higher Rph and D* than most of the previously reported PEC-type PDs, such as BP, Te, Se, Bi, Sb, SnS, and Te@Se-based PDs, revealing that the preparation of the Bi/Te binary heterostructure is a promising way to enhance the performance of PEC-type photodetectors.

According to the aforementioned results, we further explored the self-power capability of the Bi/Te-based PDs. Fig. 5a–c show the self-power photo-response behaviors of the Bi/Te-based PDs in 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M KOH electrolytes with a bias potential of 0 V under different wavelengths (350, 365, 380, 400, 475, 550, and 650 nm), respectively. The details of the photo-response behavior at level VI, intercepted from Fig. 5a–c, are shown in Fig. 5d–f. It can be seen that obvious ON/OFF signals can be found in each case. Fig. 5g shows the curves of Pph as a function of different wavelengths adopted in this work; it can be seen that the Pph decreases with the wavelength gradually red-shifting from 350 to 650 nm, for example, 1.93 μA cm−2 under 350 nm, 1.35 μA cm−2 under 365 nm, 0.94 μA cm−2 under 380 nm, 0.77 μA cm−2 under 400 nm, 0.45 μA cm−2 under 475 nm, 0.157 μA cm−2 under 550 nm, and 0.09 μA cm−2 under 365 nm in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte, which is consistent with the results above and can be explained by the reduced optical absorption. The same phenomena can also be found in the PDs in 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M KOH with the bias potentials of 0.3 and 0.6 V (Fig. S9, ESI†), respectively. The values of D* of the self-power PDs are calculated and the curves of Rph with different wavelengths are exhibited in Fig. 5h. It can be seen that the Rph shows a decreasing trend with the red-shift of wavelength in each case, and the highest Rph can reach up to 887.09 μA W−1 under 350 nm, indicating the advantages of Bi/Te-based PDs in the ultraviolet region. To better understand the performance of the PDs, the photo-response behaviors under 350 nm of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M KOH electrolytes were studied. As shown in Fig. 5i, the Pph shows a gradually increasing trend with continuously increased Pλ at 350 nm, which is in good agreement with the results above (Fig. 4d). The curves of Rph as a function of different Pλ values at 350 nm (Fig. 5i) show that the Rph displays a decreasing trend with increased Pλ, for example, 2352.94 μA W−1 (level I), 1715.69 μA W−1 (level II), 1114.46 μA W−1 (level III), 887.09 μA W−1 (level IV), and 810.51 μA W−1 (level V), suggesting that the Bi/Te-based PDs have more potential at lower Pλ. The response (tres) and recovery (trec) time of the PDs in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte with the bias potentials of 0, 0.3, and 0.6 V were measured to further evaluate the performance of the PDs (Fig. S10, ESI†). Taking the tres/trec at level IV under 380 nm as an example, the tres/trec are detected to be 0.03/0.02 s, 0.02/0.03 s and 0.02/0.02 s for the PDs with the bias potentials of 0, 0.3, and 0.6 V, respectively, which are even faster than those of some reported FET-type PDs,40,66,67 suggesting the great potential of Bi/Te for ultrafast optoelectronic devices.

Long-term stability is essential for practical applications of optoelectronic devices. Fig. S11a (ESI†) shows the long-term stability tests of the fresh PD and over 30 days for 20000 s in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte with a bias potential of 0 V under SL, respectively. The Pph first becomes smaller and reaches an equilibrium state with repeatable ON/OFF signals as the testing continues, and the reduced Pph can be explained by the wetting process of the PDs in the electrolyte. The selected area of the ON/OFF signals from 15000 to 16000 s was used to further examine the long-term stability of PDs (Fig. S11b, ESI†). Compared with the fresh PD, the Pph of the PD after 30 days is reduced by about 21.13%. This reduction is mainly caused by the Bi/Te falling off from the coated ITO glass. Although the Pph of PD has been reduced to some extent, the performance shown by the PD is completely acceptable, indicating the excellent long-term stability of Bi/Te for optoelectronic devices.
In view of the application of ultrashort pulse lasers in many fields, for example, biomedical surgery,68,69 micromachining,70 and optical communication,71 the SA based on Bi/Te and microfibers was integrated into an EDF ring resonator to obtain 786 fs pulse output at the telecommunications band. The schematic diagram of the laser platform is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). By increasing the pump power and careful tuning of the polarization controller, a stable mode-locked state is obtained at 300 mW, for which the average output power of the EDF laser was measured to be 2.76 mW. Fig. 6a shows the pulse sequence of the EDF laser at different time scales. After a simple measurement, the pulse interval of 197 ns is obtained. The inset of Fig. 6a shows the mode-locked pulse sequence with a time scale of 1 μs per div; the uniform pulse intensity shows that the mode-locked operation based on the Bi/Te SA exhibits excellent stability. As shown in Fig. 6b, in the output spectrum of the laser, the clear Kelly sidebands indicate that the mode-locked pulse is very stable in the soliton pulse regime. The center wavelength and 3 dB bandwidth of the ring fiber laser are 1559.5 and 3.34 nm, respectively. The time stability of the laser ring cavity was also evaluated. The 6-hour spectral continuous detection is shown in Fig. 6c. It can be seen that there is almost no change in the spectral profile over time, indicating that the laser based on the Bi/Te SA has the potential for long-term use. As presented in Fig. 6d, the repetition frequency of the EDF ring resonator is 5.07 MHz, which is consistent with the 39.5 m ring cavity length and round-trip time in the laser system. The high signal-to-noise ratio and broadband radio frequency (RF) spectrum demonstrate the excellent stability of the laser once again. By using an autocorrelator, the pulse width of the mode-locked pulse is measured to be as short as 786 fs (Fig. 6e), which suggests that the Bi/Te SA can be used as an excellent mode locker to generate femtosecond pulses. The time–bandwidth product of the mode-locked operation is calculated to be ∼0.324, which is very close to the theoretical conversion limit of 0.315 for sech2 pulses. Fig. 6f exhibits the linear dependence of the output power and pump power with a slope efficiency of 1.11%, and the maximum output power of the mode-locked laser is about 4.61 mW. To further understand the light–matter interaction effect of the Bi/Te SA, the nonlinear optical response of Bi/Te modified microfibers was measured. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the Bi/Te SA shows an obvious saturated absorption response under the input of 300 fs laser pulse with a wavelength of 1555 nm and a repetition rate of 98.4 MHz. By using the typical single-photon absorption model72 to fit the experimental data, a saturation power of 7.48 mW and modulation depth of 11.2% are obtained. The above results show that Bi/Te has a broad application prospect in advanced multifunctional photonic devices such as modulators, switches, thresholders and photodiodes due to its superior performance in ultrafast photonics.

Conclusions
In summary, mixed-dimensional 0D Bi QDs/2D Te NSs binary heterostructures were successfully fabricated through hydrothermal methods. The results from both experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the Bi/Te exhibits excellent photo-response behaviors for PEC-type photodetection. The high Pph (18.21 μA cm−2), Rph (2352.94 μA W−1), D* (5.19 × 109 Jones), fast response speed (0.02/0.02 s), self-power capability and the pronounced long-term stability of the Bi/Te-based PDs can be detected. Moreover, a 786 fs pulse output signal in the telecommunications band can be obtained in Bi/Te-embedded EDF ring resonators. We believed that this work paves a new way to construct multifunctional optoelectronic and photonic devices from nano-materials with elements from groups VA and VIA.

New concepts
Mixed-dimensional heterostructures have been considered as one of the most valuable research focuses for nano-science and nanotechnology. Lots of previous studies have demonstrated the great potential of mixed-dimensional heterostructures for constructing new generation devices with multiple functions. In this work, we introduce a mixed-dimensional (0D bismuth quantum dots/2D tellurium nanosheets) V–VIA binary heterostructure (Bi/Te) through a cost-effective and facile hydrothermal method. Nondegenerate transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the enhanced photo-response behaviors of Bi/Te and the effective separation of photoexcited electrons/holes in Bi/Te, suggesting the advantages of Bi/Te for optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, Bi/Te was applied for photoelectrochemical-type photodetection and was embedded in erbium-doped fiber ring resonators as a saturable absorber (SA) of ultrashort pulsed lasers. The excellent photo-response behaviors, long-term stability, and short pulse width of the mode-locked pulse demonstrate that Bi/Te is a promising material for fabricating optoelectronic devices. The integration of 0D/2D Bi/Te binary heterostructures and their studies provide a new concept and fundamental information to construct multifunctional optoelectronic devices with elements from groups VA and VIA.
