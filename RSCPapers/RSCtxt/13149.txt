    , Accepted 16th November 2012First published on 16th November 2012AbstractPolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were investigated for the first time in vanadium redox flow battery (VFB) applications. Surprisingly, PVDF ultrafiltration membranes with hydrophobic pore walls and relatively large pore sizes of several tens of nanometers proved able to separate vanadium ions and protons efficiently, thus being suitable as a VFB separator. The ion selectivity of this new type of VFB membrane could be tuned readily by controlling the membrane morphology via changes in the composition of the membrane casting solution, and the casting thickness. The results showed that the PVDF membranes offered good performances and excellent stability in VFB applications, where it could, performance-wise, truly substitute Nafion in VFB applications, but at a much lower cost.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy sources have become the central topic of our time due to environmental concerns, fossil fuel shortage and energy security issues.1 However, the random and intermittent nature of renewable sources, like wind and solar power, makes them challenging to be used and dispatched through the grid. Electric energy storage (EES) offers a well-established approach for improving the reliability of the power.2 Among different EES techniques, vanadium redox flow batteries (VFBs) are very suitable for large sale energy storage due to their advantages of security, high efficiency and flexibility.3,4
A VFB single cell normally includes two pumps, a battery cell and two electrolyte tanks containing VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples in sulfuric acid solution.5 The electrolyte is pumped through the battery during the charge and discharge, with the conversion between the electrical and the chemical energy being realized by changing the oxidation state of the vanadium ions.6
As the key component of a VFB, the membrane separator isolates the electrolytes, while still allowing the transfer of protons to complete the electrical circuit. Ideal VFB membranes are expected to be cheap, show good chemical stability, high proton conductivity and low permeability of vanadium ions.7–9 Perfluorinated cation exchange membranes (CEMs), such as Dupont's Nafion® series, are the most commonly used membranes in VFBs due to their excellent stability and proton conductivity. However, their high cost and relatively low ion selectivity hinder the further commercialization of VFBs.10–12 Non-perfluoronated polymers, like sulfonated or quaternary ammoniated polyaromatic polymers, have received wide attention as alternative materials, due to their low cost and tuned ion conductivity. However, their chemical stability still needs to be further improved.13 Recently, porous uncharged nanofiltration membranes were successfully introduced into VFBs by our group, based on the idea of realizing V/H selectivity via the exclusion of the larger V-ions from the well-tuned pores.4,14 This totally new concept successfully overcomes the restriction caused by ion exchange groups from traditional ion exchange membranes. The NF membranes separated vanadium (V(II), V(III), V(IV), and V(V)) from protons due to their difference in radius, charge density and specific interactions with electrolyte and membranes.
Previous research has mainly focused on hydrophilic polymers to facilitate water transfer and decrease the internal resistance of the VFB. However, it is hard to find hydrophilic polymers with sufficient chemical stability in VFBs. For hydrophobic polymers, generally possessing a higher chemical stability, membranes with high selectivity (hence with quite small pores) intrinsically also have high resistance to mass transfer. Therefore, the optimization of the membrane morphologies to realize their application in VFBs is a critical and urgent need.
Hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has attracted great attention in membrane applications, due to its outstanding thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, combined with its high hydrophobicity.15 PVDF membranes have been widely applied in ultrafiltration, microfiltration as well as membrane distillation.16 The repulsion between water molecules and the hydrophobic surface limits water diffusion through the PVDF membranes, therefore, realizing the ion separation. Thus it could be possible to separate vanadium ions from the electrolytes with PVDF membranes. Considering the excellent stability of PVDF membranes, to realize their application in VFBs will create a huge contribution to this field.
In this paper, PVDF porous membranes with different morphologies will be fabricated and investigated for the first time in VFB applications. Their performance will be studied in detail and a transport mechanism will be proposed. This work will thus provide a totally new type of porous membrane for VFBs, not containing any ion exchange groups, but still showing excellent stability and performance in VFBs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Membrane preparation
The PVDF (Shanghai 3F New Materials Company Ltd, FR904) membranes were fabricated from a DMAC solution via phase inversion. The solution was cast on a glass plate and then solidified in a water bath. The membrane morphology was tuned via adjusting the parameters, like solution concentration and thickness of the cast layer.
2.2. Characterization

2.2.1. Membrane morphology. 
The morphology of the membrane’s cross-section and surface was investigated by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL 6360LV) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Philip XL-30-ESEM-FEG), respectively. The membrane cross-sections were obtained by breaking the membranes in liquid nitrogen. All the samples were gold coated before SEM-analysis.


2.2.2. Ion permeability. 
The permeabilities of the H+ and VO2+ ions were tested in a diffusion cell, as described earlier.4 The diffusion cells were separated by a membrane. The left cell was filled with deionized water, while the right cell was filled with electrolyte (1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 solution). Both sides were stirred to avoid concentration polarization. The concentration of protons in the left cell was determined with a Sartorius pH meter, while the VO2+ concentration was measured using a UV-vis spectrometer.
The ion permeability can be obtained by Fick’s diffusion law from eqn (1):17 (1)Where VB is the solution volume in the left reservoir, A and L are the effective area and thickness of the membrane, respectively, P is the permeability of the ions, CA is the ion concentration in the right reservoir, while CB(t) refers to the ion concentration in the left reservoir as a function of time.


2.3.3. Contact angle. 
The water contact angle test was determined by the sessile drop method (JC2001A, POWEREACH®, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technic Apparatus Co. Ltd., China). For every experiment, 10 μL deionized water was dropped on the membrane surface with a syringe.


2.3.4. VFB performance. 
The VFB single cell was fabricated by sandwiching a membrane between two carbon felt electrodes, clamped by two graphite polar plates. The area of the electrode was kept at 9 cm2. All these components were fixed between two stainless plates. 30 mL of 1.5 M V2+/V3+ in 3.0 M H2SO4 and of 1.5 M VO2+/VO2+ in 3.0 M H2SO4 solutions served as electrolytes at the negative and positive sides respectively. The charge and discharge tests were carried out by an Arbin BT2000 with different current densities. The cut-off voltage for the charge and discharge process was set between 1.65 V and 0.8 V.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Membrane morphology
PVDF porous membranes with different morphologies were fabricated via the phase inversion method by tuning the polymer solution concentration. Membranes prepared from solutions with concentrations of 18%, 21% and 23 wt% PVDF in DMAC, and cast with wet thicknesses that result in final thicknesses of the dried membranes being around 100 μm (referred to as M-18-100, M-21-100 and M-23-100) were selected to investigate their performance in VFBs. Their cross-section and surface morphology, determined via SEM, are shown in Fig. 1
 Fig. 1  The cross-section morphology of the PVDF porous membranes (a: M-16-100, b: M-21-100, c: M-23-100, scale bar 20 μm), as well as a view of the top surface of the membrane (d: M-23-100, scale bar 1 μm). 
The cross-sections of the membranes were highly asymmetric, consisting of three clearly distinguishable regions. Near the top surface, a thin (submicron) and dense skin layer can be observed, with a sponge-like morphology at the bottom and a zone containing macrovoids (finger-like structures) in between. With the concentration of the membrane casting solution increasing, the bottom layer changes from an open sponge-like structure to a denser structure with more closed spheres. As a semicrystalline polymer, the phase separation of PVDF is more complicated than that of other traditional amorphous polymers, like polysulfone or polyimide. Normally two mechanisms, namely liquid–liquid demixing and crystallization, will determine the final morphology of the PVDF membranes.18,19 As reported by Akbari et al.,19 the totally crystallinity increases with the PVDF concentration, since the mass exchange rate in the more viscous casting solutions is slower than in the lower concentration case, allowing crystallization to commence much earlier to yield higher crystallinity. This possibly induces the formation of spherical particles, which can provide obstacles for ion transportation.20 Moreover, the relatively slow phase inversion process could induce membranes with smaller and less interconnected pores. Taking M23-100 as an example, the surface morphology recorded by SEM in Fig. 1d showed typical ultrafiltration features with pore sizes around 50 nm.
3.2. Ion permeability

Fig. 2 shows the plot of the vanadium and proton concentration in the acceptor phase of the dialysis set-up vs. time. The slopes of the lines clearly indicate that the membranes exhibited a much higher permeation rate for protons than for vanadium ions. With increasing PVDF concentration in the casting solutions, both the vanadium ion and the proton permeabilities decrease, which agrees well with the anticipated decreasing pore size distribution of the resulting membranes.21 To our surprise, compared with the earlier reported hydrophilic PAN-H nanofiltration membranes with much smaller pore sizes, the vanadium ion permeability is much lower through the more open PVDF (5 × 10−6Vs. 8.7 × 10−7 cm2 min−1), however, their proton diffusion rate is quite similar (1.96 × 10−5Vs. 1.13 × 10−5 cm2 min−1).14 The reason is possibly due to its hydrophobic nature, as will be discussed later.

Fig. 3 shows the charge and discharge curves of VFBs assembled with different membranes at current densities of 80 mA cm−2, while specific battery efficiencies are listed in Table 1. The coulombic efficiency (CE) increased from 45% to 90% when the concentration of the casting solution increased from 16% to 23%, while the energy efficiency (EE) jumped from 40% to 76.8%. As an index to measure electric capacity conversion, CE intimately relates to the vanadium cross-mixing rate during cycle tests. With increasing polymer concentration in the membrane casting solutions, denser membranes were formed. The decreased vanadium permeability or improved ion selectivity is mainly responsible for the increased CE.22,23 At the same time, with decreasing pore size, the transferring force for ions increases or the ion conductivity will decrease, which results in lower voltage energy (VE). In this system, the M-16-100 pores are too large to retain any ions, while they showed a VE similar to the one of M-21-100. EE is a crucial parameter to assess the feasibility of an energy storage technology, especially in large scale applications. For the reported PVDF system, the EE of the membranes increases with increasing concentration due to their improved ion selectivity. Unfortunately, a viscosity that was too high did not allow membrane casting from the solutions with a PVDF concentration exceeding 23 wt%.

3.3. Influence of membrane thickness
To further optimize the membrane fabrication conditions and to better understand the transport properties of ions in PVDF, PVDF membranes with different thicknesses (65 μm, 100 μm and 125 μm, referred as to M-23-65, M-23-100 and M-23-125) were prepared from 23 wt% PVDF solutions and investigated for their performance in a VFB. The cross-sections in Fig. 4 showed similar structures with finger-like pores in between a thin skin layer, with a cellular bulk morphology underneath. However, with increasing membrane thickness, the bottom layer starts to form finger-like pores. For example, the membranes with a thickness of 65 μm show a typical spongy structure all over the bottom part of the membrane, while some finger-like pores appear when the membrane thickness increases to 125 μm. Similarly, with the membranes prepared from casting solutions with different concentrations, an increased thickness slows down the phase inversion process at the bottom side of the membrane.19 The magnified sponge structures of the membranes with different thicknesses clearly indicate that with increasing thickness, some spherical particles, generally referred to as nodules,18 become formed, most probably induced by some crystallization of the PVDF. Moreover, a sandwich-like structure with two skin layers was found for the membrane with a thickness of 125 μm, which possibly creates an additional ion selectivity in the VFB.
 Fig. 4  Morphology of PVDF membranes cast with different thicknesses (dry thickness: a, a′ = 65 μm; b, b′ = 100 μm; c, c′ = 125 μm). 
The permeability of vanadium ions and protons through the membranes with different thicknesses is listed in Table 2. The permeabilities of both the H+ and VO2+ ions decrease with increasing membrane thickness, while the separation factors between V/H remain at a similar level, which indicates that the pore size exclusion plays the most important role in determining ion selectivity. Since all permeabilities are standardized by thickness, the vanadium ion resistance capacity of PVDF thus becomes better with increasing membrane thickness. On the other hand, a thickness that is too high will lead to an area resistance which is also too high. An optimized membrane thickness should thus exist to balance ion selectivity and proton conductivity. To our surprise, porous PVDF with quite large pores in the nanometer range thus even showed lower vanadium ions permeabilities than dense Nafion 117 membranes.24,25 A possible reason can be the high surface tension of hydrated vanadium ions on the pore walls of the hydrophobic PVDF membranes.26 Moreover, the longer tortuous path with the thicker PVDF porous membranes could increase the resistance of vanadium ion transport through the membranes as well. The much smaller protons should suffer less from these surface and tortuosity effects.

3.4. VFB single cell performance

Fig. 5 shows the VFB performance of PVDF porous membranes with different thicknesses. As expected, the CE increases from 87.1% to 95.0% as the membrane thickness increases from 65 to 125 μm due to the increased vanadium resistance capacity. While the VE decreased due to the increased internal resistance to protons, the EE increased a little as the thickness went up to 125 μm. The overall optimized VFB performance of PVDF membranes is realized by the M-23-125 sample, holding a CE of 95% and an EE of 78.6%, which is comparable with that of currently used Nafion 115.4
 Fig. 5  The performance of a VFB containing PVDF membranes with different thicknesses. 
The single VFB performance, assembled with the M-23-125 membrane, is shown in Fig. 5b under different current densities. The CE increases from 90.3% to 95%, while the VE decreases from 90% to 82.7% as the current density varies from 40 mA cm−2 to 80 mA cm−2. The tendency is quite similar with other reported porous membrane separators.4 Normally, longer times are required to finish each charge–discharge cycle at lower current densities. Thus, the total amount of cross-mixed vanadium ions increases, leading to a higher capacity loss and a lower CE. The decreased VE could be due to the high overpotential and ohmic resistance at high current density.
3.5. Membrane stability
To further investigate the stability of the PVDF porous membranes under VFB operating conditions, the charge–discharge cycle test at 80 mA cm−2 was carried out on the VFB assembled with M-23-125. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the CE remained around 95% after running for more than 1000 cycles, suggesting the excellent chemical stability of the PVDF porous membranes for VFB applications. SEM was carried out on the membranes before and after the cycle test (See ESI† Fig. S1). Similar morphologies were found after the cycling test, confirming the excellent stability of PVDF membranes under VFB operating conditions.

3.6. Tentative transport mechanism
In order to shed light on the transport mechanism of ions through the porous PVDF membranes, the role of the pore wall hydrophobicity was investigated. PVDF porous membranes were treated with a potassium hydroxide/ethanol solution to increase their hydrophilicity by dehydrofluorination.27 After treatment, the water contact angle of the PVDF porous membranes (M-23-125/KOH) indeed decreased from 78° to 69.5° (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The permeability of H+ and VO2+ ions of M-23-125/KOH is much higher than of the original M-23-125 (Table 1S ESI†). As a result, the CE of the VFB assembled with M-23-125/KOH decreased from 95% to 83% after this hydrophilic treatment (Fig. S3 ESI†). These results thus confirm the important role played by the hydrophobic nature of the membrane to resist permeation of vanadium ions through the membranes due to the high surface tension. As shown in Fig. 7, the hydrophobic nature of the PVDF pore walls could prevent hydrated vanadium ions from entering the membranes due to the high surface tension between the membrane surface and hydration water. Similar effects will occur deeper inside the membrane whenever a permeating, hydrated vanadium ion has to pass a pore restriction, many of which can be expected from a membrane prepared via phase inversion. The much smaller protons require a much smaller critical pore radius to experience exclusion by a hydrophobic pore wall. As the hydrophilicity of the PVDF pore increased, the vanadium ions can permeate through the membranes much easier, especially considering the large pores that are present on the surface, due to their good compatibility with the water wetted membrane surface.

4. Conclusions
PVDF ultrafiltration membranes prepared via the process of phase inversion were proven to be excellent VFB separators. Surprisingly, the PVDF membranes can thus effectively separate vanadium ions from protons, even though all hydrated ions have much smaller radii than the pores of the membranes. This remarkable effect could be ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of the membrane pore walls and the presence of pore constrictions. The membranes showed increasing ion selectivity with decreasing pore sizes, and as a result, higher CEs in VFB applications. An optimized performance with a CE of 95% and an EE of 78.6% could be obtained via adjusting the membrane thickness. These numbers are comparable with performances obtained using the Nafion benchmark, but at much lower cost. Moreover, the PVDF membranes showed a stable performance after more than 1000 cycles in a charge–discharge test, indicating excellent VFB stability. This paper truly provides a totally new kind of membrane to substitute Nafion in VFB applications, which combines excellent performance with a lower cost.
