    , Accepted 1st February 2017First published on 2nd February 2017AbstractPhotoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution from water using CdTe photocathodes prepared by close spaced sublimation was investigated. A CdTe thin film deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glass plate acted as the photocathode. Surface modification of this photocathode with Pt resulted in an increase in the cathodic photocurrent from only 0.01 to 0.14 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE. Further surface modification with an approximately 80 nm-thick CdS layer dramatically increased both the cathodic photocurrent and the onset potential, from 0.14 to 6.0 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE and from 0.2 to 0.6 VRHE, respectively, under simulated sunlight. The CdTe photocathode showed stoichiometric hydrogen evolution from water, with a half-cell solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.9% at approximately 0.2 VRHE.
1. Introduction
The energy demands of modern society are mainly provided by exhaustible fossil resources, including petroleum, coal and natural gas.1,2 These same resources are also utilized as raw materials for the synthesis of many essential bulk chemicals, such as ammonia, which plays a vital role as a fertilizer in food production.3,4 One means of obtaining a sustainable supply of energy and essential chemicals is to substitute renewable sources of energy and raw materials for fossil resources. Hydrogen produced from water utilizing renewable energy is a promising next-generation fuel, and can also serve as a raw material for certain indispensable chemicals, such as ammonia.5–7
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water can directly generate hydrogen utilizing solar energy in a relatively simple process.8–10 In order to utilize solar energy efficiently, it is advantageous to use a photoelectrode material with a narrow bandgap and a long absorption edge wavelength.5–14 However, there are other firm requirements for these photoelectrode materials, including a valence band maximum (VBM) deeper than the oxygen evolution potential and a conduction band minimum (CBM) shallower than the hydrogen evolution potential.8,9 Thus, in the case of a PEC cell based on single step photoexcitation, there are difficulties associated with using narrow bandgap materials as photoelectrodes for water splitting. Within a PEC cell, n-type and p-type semiconductor electrodes can act as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively.8,10,14 This combination of a photocathode and a photoanode allows the use of narrow bandgap materials having long absorption edges by summing the driving forces of these photoelectrodes.15,16 That is, the combination of these electrodes can relax the strict requirements referred to above. The utilization of a significant portion of the sunlight spectrum through the application of photoelectrodes with long absorption edges in a PEC cell is essential to generating hydrogen and oxygen from water with a desirable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Thus, many semiconducting materials, including oxides, (oxy)nitrides and (oxy)chalcogenides, have been intensively investigated as photoelectrodes.13–28
Cadmium telluride (CdTe) has a number of very attractive properties as a photocathode material for PEC water splitting, such as p-type semiconductor characteristics, a long absorption edge of 830 nm combined with preferable band edge potentials for hydrogen evolution from water, and a high photoabsorption coefficient of 104 cm−1 below 800 nm.29,30 Furthermore, polycrystalline CdTe thin films have been employed as absorbing materials in photovoltaic cells, suggesting that CdTe may exhibit preferable semiconducting properties when acting as a photocathode in the polycrystalline state.29 Because of this, there have reports regarding PEC and photocatalytic applications of CdTe.31,32,40–45 Firstly, Ohashi et al. reported PEC water splitting using single crystal wafer of p-type CdTe.40 Bockris et al. studied the properties of CdTe-based photocathodes, including Pourbaix diagram and the flat-band potentials in some electrolytes.41 Takahashi et al. reported a significant increase in the cathodic photocurrent following surface modification with Pt.42 Lichterman et al. examined a photoanode fabricated from a single-crystal wafer of n-type CdTe. The photoanode, when coated with TiO2 and Ni, showed stable and stoichiometric oxygen evolution from water.32 To date, however, there have been no reports regarding CdTe photocathodes with multilayer structures, such as a p–n junction at the solid–liquid interface. Furthermore, the faradaic efficiency of CdTe photocathodes during hydrogen evolution from water under simulated sunlight has not yet been determined. In the present study, the PEC properties of CdTe photocathodes and the effects of multilayer structures based on CdS were investigated in detail. Polycrystalline CdTe thin films deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass plates (CdTe/FTO) using a close spaced sublimation (CSS) method were examined as photocathodes for hydrogen evolution from water.29,30 To facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction and the separation of photoexcited charges, the photocathode surface was modified with Pt20,21,33–35 and CdS,20,21,33–38 an n-type semiconductor. A CdTe/FTO electrode modified with both Pt and CdS (Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO) showed a significant cathodic photocurrent during hydrogen evolution from water, in conjunction with a faradaic efficiency of approximately 100% under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G).
2. Experimental
FTO-coated glass, Mo-coated soda-lime glass (Mo/SLG) and Ti-coated SLG (Ti/SLG) plates were employed as substrates for CdTe thin films. The Mo/SLG and Ti/SLG substrates were prepared by depositing Ti and Mo, respectively, on SLG plates using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with an Ar partial pressure of 0.2 Pa, an RF power of 200 W, a substrate temperature of 300 °C and a deposition time of 45 min. The PEC properties of the CdTe-based photocathodes prepared on these substrates were subsequently examined, with the results shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the ESI.† It was concluded that the FTO-coated glass plate was the optimum substrate for CdTe photocathode preparation. It should be noted that, among the substrates, only FTO should form preferable ohmic contact with CdTe.
As noted, CSS was employed to deposit the CdTe thin films (see ESI† for additional details). To form these films, a quantity of CdTe (99.9999% purity) was placed in an alumina crucible and evaporated thermally, with the CdTe deposition rate controlled by adjusting the power applied to the heater. The deposition chamber was evacuated with a rotary pump, after which the partial pressure of Ar in the chamber was adjusted to 1.5 Pa, applying an Ar flow rate of 20 sccm. Prior to film deposition, each substrate was annealed at 550 °C under an Ar partial pressure of 1.5 Pa for 1 h to remove any surface contamination.
To facilitate charge separation at the solid–liquid interface, a thin n-type semiconducting layer of CdS was applied to each photocathode surface. These CdS layers were formed on the CdTe thin films by chemical bath deposition (CBD).33 An aqueous solution containing Cd(CH3COO)2 (Kanto, 98.0%), SC(NH2)2 (Kanto, 98.0%) and ammonia (Wako) at concentrations of 25 mM, 375 mM and 14 wt%, respectively, was used as the chemical bath. During the CBD process, the bath temperature was gradually increased from 20 to 65 °C over approximately 8 min. The resulting sample was then annealed in air at 300 °C for 1 h. Prior to the PEC measurements, an approximately 2 nm-thick Pt layer was deposited on the surfaces of some specimens as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction from water, using vacuum evaporation. Pt wire (Nilaco, 99.98%) put on a tungsten filament (Nilaco, LF-105W) was evaporated with applied current of 45 A and with back ground pressure of <4 × 10−3 Pa. The top-view SEM images of Pt/CdTe/FTO and Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO and the optical transmittance spectrum of the 2 nm thick Pt layer deposited on FTO substrate are shown in Fig. S10 and S12, respectively, in the ESI.†
The PEC properties of the CdTe thin film photoelectrodes were characterized using a PEC cell with a three-electrode configuration. In this arrangement, the specimen under consideration, Ag/AgCl in a saturated aqueous KCl solution, and a Pt wire connected to a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko, HSV-100) served as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The light illumination was performed from front side of the samples. Typically, a 0.5 M aqueous KH2PO4 solution adjusted to a pH of 8 by the addition of KOH was employed as the electrolyte, and a light source was used to generate simulated sunlight. Each of the PEC measurements was performed under an Ar atmosphere, and the measured potentials were converted to the RHE scale based on the Nernst equation. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined under monochromatic light from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator (CT-10, JASCO). The photon flux of the monochromatic light was determined using a calibrated Si photodiode (S2281-01, Hamamatsu). The amounts of evolved H2 and O2 were measured in a batch system equipped with a micro gas chromatograph (GC, Agilent, 3000A).
Morphological and compositional analyses of the samples were performed simultaneously using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi, S-4700 and S-8200) in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Horiba, EMAX-7000 and Horiba, EX-370). The structural and optical properties of the CdTe thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Cu Kα line, and by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS; V-670, Jasco). The electronic structure of the CdTe was studied using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA; AC-3, Riken Keiki).
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Characterizations of CdTe films
SEM images were obtained from CdTe films prepared on FTO substrates by CSS employing a substrate temperature of 400 °C for 3–24 min, to confirm their morphological properties. Cross-sectional SEM images of the films are shown in Fig. 1A–E. These images demonstrate that the thickness of the CdTe layer increased linearly with deposition time, going from approximately 500 nm to 5.2 μm. The relationship between the deposition time and the CdTe film thickness is summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† It was also found that the deposited films were composed of columnar grains, and that the diameters of these columns increased with film thickness. It should be noted that the specific structures of these CdTe films were helpful with regard to achieving lower series resistance values and to enhancing the diffusion of photo-excited carriers to the reaction sites. Top view images of these films are presented in Fig. 1F–J, and show that the film surfaces consisted of polygonal grains, with the grain size clearly increasing with film thickness.

The structural properties of the CdTe films were further investigated by acquiring XRD patterns. The XRD pattern for a 2 μm-thick CdTe/FTO film prepared at a substrate temperature of 400 °C is shown in Fig. 2, and demonstrates that the CdTe film did not contain any impurity phases except for excessive Te and surface oxides and was oriented in the (111) direction, in agreement with previous reports.39 The XRD patterns for all the CdTe/FTO specimens, having various thicknesses, are provided in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† These patterns demonstrate that none of the CdTe layers produced in this study contained impurity phases. We note that the broad peak at 2θ = 40–50° is originated by an oxidized surface layer composed of TeOx and CdxTeOy and excessive elemental Te.46 EDX analysis showed that the CdTe samples contain 6% excessive Te, typically.

UV-vis transmission spectra and PESA data were obtained to assess the bandgap and the band edge potentials for the CdTe layers. From the UV-vis spectra in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† it is evident that the CdTe had an absorption edge at approximately 830 nm, which is consistent with previously reported values.29 It should be noted that the transmittance of light below 800 nm was negligible in the case of samples having a CdTe layer thicker than 2 μm, indicating that the CdTe layer thickness required for sufficient light absorption was 2 μm. The effects of the CdTe layer thickness on the PEC properties are discussed in detail in Section 3.3. PESA data were used to assess the band edge potentials, and the VBM potential of the CdTe was determined to be 0.63 VNHE (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†).
3.2 PEC properties of surface modified CdTe photocathodes
Current–potential plots obtained from CdTe/FTO, Pt-deposited CdTe/FTO (Pt/CdTe/FTO) and Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO specimens under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight are presented in Fig. 3. Each of these photocathodes had a 2 μm-thick CdTe layer prepared at a deposition temperature of 400 °C. The CdTe/FTO exhibited an obvious cathodic response, indicating p-type conductivity, although the photocurrent generated by this photocathode was quite small. Introducing Pt to the CdTe/FTO as a hydrogen evolution catalyst increased the photocurrent from just 0.01 to 0.14 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE. This enhancement of the photocurrent is similar to that reported for other photocathodes during hydrogen evolution from water.19–21,33–35 The significant difference between the photocurrent onset potential and the flat-band potential of Pt/CdTe/FTO can likely be attributed to insufficient charge separation. To enhance the charge separation of photo-excited carriers, surface modification using an approximately 80 nm-thick CdS layer was examined, a technique that has been previously reported.20,21,33–35 This modification resulted in increases in the photocurrent and onset potential values, from 0.14 to 6.0 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE and from 0.2 to 0.6 VRHE, respectively. The half-cell solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (HC-STH) estimated from the current–potential plot of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode had a maximum value of 0.9% at approximately 0.2 VRHE. The IPCE values determined under monochromatic light are plotted in Fig. 4, and show that the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO exhibited a photo-response at wavelengths shorter than approximately 900 nm, with a maximum IPCE of 30% in the range of 550 to 620 nm. The significantly lower IPCE values below 520 nm are attributed to the photo-absorption of the CdS layer, which has an absorption edge of 520 nm. This result indicates that photoexcited carriers in the CdS layer were not utilized for reactions because of the too small grains of the layer, as demonstrated by the grains found in the SEM image in Fig. S4B in the ESI.† This result is in agreement with previous reports regarding various photocathodes modified with CdS layers via CBD.20,21,33–35 It should be noted that SEM-EDX analyses revealed that stacked CdS, CdTe and FTO layers were successfully formed and that an 8 min CBD process resulted in the deposition of an approximately 80 nm-thick CdS layer (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†).

Current–potential plots obtained under intermittent simulated sunlight from Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO specimens fabricated using various CBD time spans are shown in Fig. 5. Both the cathodic photocurrent and the onset potential were evidently increased as the CBD time span was prolonged up to 8 min, because of enhanced band bending due to the p–n junction formation at the solid–liquid interface. Both the photocurrent and onset potential decreased as the CBD time was increased beyond 8 min, an effect that is partly attributed to the increased light absorption of the CdS layer below 520 nm, as seen in the IPCE data. Another possible reason is that a thinner depletion layer was formed in the CdTe layer as the result of an overly thick CdS coating. This depletion layer, primarily occupied by a defective CdS layer, prevented the utilization of photo-excited carriers in the CdTe. The p–n junction would have been able to enhance charge separation and suppress surface recombination because of the thicker depletion layer formed at the solid–liquid interface and the greater depth of the VBM of the CdS layer. For these reasons, the optimal thickness of the CdS coating appears to be approximately 80 nm. It should be noted that the formation of p–n junction was confirmed by Mott–Schottky plots. (see Fig. S8 in the ESI†).

To assist in understanding the enhanced photocurrents and onset potentials, band diagrams for the electrolyte/CdTe and electrolyte/CdS/CdTe interfaces are shown in Fig. 6. These were calculated as described in the ESI.† CdS is expected to form a p–n junction with CdTe, and the presence of this junction should improve the charge separation as the depletion layer increases in thickness from 250 to 330 nm, based on the calculation results shown in Fig. 6. The deep VBM of CdS also enhances charge separation by suppressing the diffusion of holes to the photocathode surface. Such preferable properties of CdS/CdTe contact may contribute to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution found in surface modified CdS/CdTe nanoparticles.45

3.3 Effects of the CdTe layer thickness on the PEC properties of Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO
As discussed above, a CdTe layer with a thickness of 2 μm is sufficient as a light absorber. However, the structural properties of the CdTe layer deposited on the FTO substrate can also vary significantly with film thickness, as shown in Fig. 1. Here, it is helpful to discuss the optimal CdTe layer thickness in the case of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode. Current–potential plots for Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO specimens having different CdTe layer thicknesses, as generated under simulated sunlight, are shown in Fig. 7A. Each of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathodes showed a clear photoresponse below 0.6 VRHE. In contrast, the photocurrent values summarized in Fig. 7B appear to have been affected by the thickness of the CdTe layer; the photocurrents at 0.1 VRHE were approximately 6 and 4.3 mA cm−2 for the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathodes with CdTe thicknesses of less than 3.8 and equal to 5.2 μm, respectively. The photocurrents at 0.4 VRHE were more sensitive to the thickness of the CdTe layer than those at 0.1 VRHE, and the photocathode with a CdTe thickness of 2 μm exhibited the largest cathodic photocurrent. Considering the UV-vis data discussed above, the increases in the cathodic photocurrent associated with increases in the CdTe layer thickness below 2 μm are attributed to the absorption of greater quantities of photons by the CdTe. In addition, the decrease in photocurrent with increasing CdTe layer thickness above 2 μm is due to increases in the undesirable series resistance, since overly thick CdTe layers do not provide sufficient hole transfer to the backside electrode. However, these CdTe films were composed of columnar grains, which is helpful, and it should be noted that relatively small grains (with sizes on the submicron level) were present at the interface between the CdTe layer and the FTO substrate. Small grains such as these are believed to be partly responsible for the reduced cathodic photocurrents observed below 2 μm. We can therefore conclude that the optimal CdTe layer thickness in a Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode is on the order of 2 μm. This empirically determined value is consistent with the results of characterization of the optical absorption and structural properties of these photocathodes.

3.4 Durability of Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO
The time course of the photocurrent generated by a Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO specimen at 0 VRHE under simulated sunlight is shown in Fig. 8. The photocurrent was approximately 5.6 mA cm−2 immediately after the beginning of irradiation, but gradually increased over the course of one hour to approximately 7.3 mA cm−2, after which it began to slowly decrease. During these measurements, both the irradiation and stirring were intentionally interrupted. Stopping the stirring was found to reduce the cathodic photocurrent from approximately 6.2 to 3.1 mA cm−2, indicating that mass transport factors, including the adhesion of evolved hydrogen bubbles to the photocathode, can limit the photocurrent from the Pt/CdS/CdTe. In fact, the attachment of bubbles to the photocathode can clearly be seen in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† To further assess the causes of this decrease in the photocurrent, the surface morphology of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO were analyzed using SEM. As shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† the surface morphology of the photocathode was obviously changed after the durability test, due to corrosion of the CdS layer. It should be noted that the partial corrosion of excessive CdS which decrease cathodic photocurrent can be the reason of initial increase of photocurrent. The XPS analysis revealed that CdTe layer was exposed after the durability test because of the partial removal of Pt and CdS. However, there were the difficulty of surface composition analysis due to the existence of the surface Pt layer and small ionization cross-section of 2p and 2s electrons of sulfur. (see Fig. S11 in the ESI†) Fig. 9 presents the results of a gas product analysis by GC to confirm the faradaic efficiency. Note that, during these trials, there was a lag time of approximately 10 min for H2 and O2 detection because of the time required to homogenize the gas phase in the measurement system. Following a 60 min PEC reaction, stable evolution of consistent amounts of H2 was found, suggesting that the faradaic efficiency of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode during hydrogen evolution from water was close to 100%. The amounts of evolved oxygen were also measured simultaneously for reference purposes and were also consistent with the expected amounts, based on the current–time curve acquired simultaneously. The stoichiometric water splitting observed during this work confirms approximately 100% faradaic efficiency.

4. Conclusions
The PEC properties of CdTe photocathodes prepared by CSS and the effects of surface modifications of these photocathodes were investigated. CdTe-based photocathode with FTO substrate showed larger cathodic photocurrent than those with Mo/SLG and Ti/SLG substrates because of larger work function of FTO than those of Mo and Ti. Structural characterization revealed that the CdTe films deposited on the FTO substrates were composed of columnar grains, while UV-vis spectra demonstrated that a CdTe film with a thickness of approximately 2 μm was sufficient for the purposes of photo-absorption. The CdTe/FTO specimens exhibited a definite cathodic response, indicating p-type conductivity, and surface modification with Pt resulted in an increase in the photocurrent from 0.01 to 0.14 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE. However, there was an obvious divergence between the photocurrent onset potential and the flat-band potential. Further surface modification with an 80 nm-thick CdS layer led to clear increases in both the photocurrent and onset potential, from 0.14 to 6.0 mA cm−2 at 0.1 VRHE and from 0.2 to 0.6 VRHE, respectively. The maximum HC-STH value, as estimated from the current–potential curve produced by the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode, was 0.9% at around 0.2 VRHE. IPCE data showed that the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO produced a photo-response when exposed to wavelengths shorter than approximately 900 nm, with a maximum IPCE of 30% in the region of 550 to 620 nm. From these data, the optimal CdTe layer thickness in the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode was determined to be 2 μm, and this value is consistent with the UV-vis results. The analysis of gas products determined that the faradaic efficiency of the Pt/CdS/CdTe/FTO photocathode during hydrogen evolution from water was virtually 100%, although this photocathode showed a gradual decrease in photocurrent at 0 VRHE throughout the current–time measurements.
From these results, we conclude that CdTe is a potential candidate as a photocathode material for hydrogen evolution from water. The advantages of this material include ease of preparation, a long absorption edge and stoichiometric water splitting. Major challenges that must be addressed in future include stabilization of the photocathode in addition to problems with mass transfer.
