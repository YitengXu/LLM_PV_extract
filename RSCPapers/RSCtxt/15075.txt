    , Accepted 30th July 2019First published on 1st August 2019AbstractFullerenes have become one of the most interesting families of molecules to be used in perovskite solar cells. A wide range of derivatives have been designed and applied in these types of devices due to their ability to passivate defects. However, the relevance of these functionalisations in the device performance is not clear yet, as there might be perovskite–fullerene interactions yet to be figured out. In this work a new set of spectroscopic techniques is proposed for the identification of perovskite:fullerene complexes that could be generated in solution, focusing on the non-covalent interactions taking part. The obtained results allow understanding the importance of suitable chemical modification of fullerenes and the implications that the functional group has in the thin film scenario. In this sense, a new fullerene with an optimised structure, FU11, is synthesised and applied in blend films with perovskite, achieving an efficiency of up to 18.3% and universality for different cell configurations. Furthermore, a clear correlation can be observed between the ability of the fullerene to coordinate the perovskite and the final solar cell performance.
Introduction
The big growth that the photovoltaic (PV) field has experienced in the last few years is certainly unquestionable, and the impact of the discovery of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) on this cannot be taken for granted. These photovoltaic devices have experienced a quick development from their initial efficiency of 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 1) to their current efficiency of 24.2% in 2018.2 This outstanding progress is due to their high versatility for processing and chemical compatibility with a broad range of compounds, such as carbon nanomaterials as semiconductors for hole-transporting layers (HTLs) or electron-transporting layers (ETLs).3 In particular, fullerenes have been prominent in the development of this technology due to their unique physicochemical properties.4–8 Extensively applied as charge-transporting materials,9–20 mainly as electron-selective ones, and additives in perovskite layers,21–28 these carbon allotropes have provided plenty of benefits to these types of PV devices. Improvements in the fill factor (FF),25–27 stability21,23,25,26,30 and hysteresis suppression22–25,31–33 have supported different roles of fullerenes in perovskite devices. One of their fundamental properties is the ability of passivating trap states as they can bind uncoordinated atoms at the grain boundaries, as it has been widely claimed by several research groups.14–19,25,26,29 Their chemical nature (e.g. symmetry, non-polarity, and spherical shape) has also made them perfect candidates as frames for the growth of perovskite crystals, leading to improved morphologies and increased grain sizes.34 In fact, due to their high chemical versatility, a wide range of fullerene derivatives could be successfully produced and applied in PSCs, leading to devices with improved performance.22–28 Nevertheless, if fullerenes are to be used in future protocols for PSC design, structurally optimised fullerene derivatives would be required, and therefore there is still plenty of room for improvement in understanding perovskite:fullerene systems and the relevance of the nature of fullerene.
Further insights into the physicochemical implications of fullerenes in perovskites would allow designing new generation fullerenes with advanced properties, and shed light on current issues like the origin of FF increase or hysteresis suppression. In this sense, there is a need for further understanding the characteristics of perovskite–fullerene blends. A simple and straightforward approach that could shed light on this subject would be the study of these systems from their solution state to the device scenario with spectroscopic techniques, taking a look at all the interactions playing a role in solution and their effects on the layer and device physicochemical properties. In this respect, various spectroscopic techniques have already been applied separately for the study of certain perovskite formulations, but not yet with fullerenes. In particular, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been extensively used for the evaluation of the bonds that are being broken and established in perovskite complex formation between the different precursors.35–41 Not only that but 1H-NMR was also applied in the work by Yavari and co-workers for understanding the chemical role of carbon nanoparticles in perovskite solutions.42
Regarding fullerenes, their electronegative nature is particularly relevant for understand how they would behave in a blend together with a perovskite. In fact, this characteristic was found to be critical in explaining one of the most recent findings in perovskite:fullerene systems by Gharibzadeh and colleagues, who proved the injection of electrons from the perovskite to C70 on the picoseconds scale.43 With the addition of a molecule which is able to accept electrons like this fullerene, they managed to decrease the trap density of the perovskite layer, which led to a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7% for ETL-free devices. This chemical nature strongly influences their chemical compatibility and thus the species which they will preferentially bind, with reported studies being completely coherent with this. In this sense, several studies have proved the establishment of intermolecular bonds between arenes and anions through anion–π interactions44–49 and, more particularly, between fullerenes and halides.22,33,50,51 This finding suggests that fullerenes would show certain preference towards halide-rich sites in the perovskite film and, in this line, Xu and co-workers found out the passivating role of [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for Pb–I antisites in the perovskite layer while studying anion–π interactions.22 Taking into account the ability of fullerenes to interact with perovskites, studying these interactions and how to modulate them would open up a wide range of possibilities for the design, synthesis and application of new fullerenes with an optimised structure for the enhancement of certain properties such as defect passivation.
Herein, we report evidence on the formation of specific interactions between fullerenes and perovskite precursors. To prove this fact, a novel combination of spectroscopic techniques was used on perovskite precursor solutions doped with fullerenes of different structural natures. NMR and IR spectra provided insightful data on the atoms involved in the new complex formed. The alterations generated by the insertion of fullerenes were later linked to microstructural properties (i.e. characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM)) of the perovskite layer. To further confirm the benefits of fullerene addition to PSCs, devices of various configurations were fabricated, all of them suggesting the FF as the main source of improvement in the performance. Furthermore, based on the chemical knowledge on perovskite:fullerene mixtures, a novel fullerene was synthesised, which led to PSCs with improved performance with PCE values of up to 18.3%.
Results and discussion
Considering the currently open questions around the influence of perovskite–fullerene interactions on the device performance, we decided to study the relevance of structural characteristics of fullerenes in this by different spectroscopic methods. Therefore, we focused the analysis on certain selected fullerenes for a suitable comparison. In particular, we decided to study the specific cases of IS2, a fullerene functionalised with an isoxazoline group, and non-functionalised C60 and C70. This molecule, particularly appealing as it provided the highest efficiencies for ETL-free devices,28 holds a characteristic functionalisation that could help understand the possible working mechanisms. Since IS2 contains fluorine atoms, we decided to perform 19F-NMR experiments in 4:1 dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF:DMSO). As can be seen in Fig. 1a, the five fluorine atoms of this material show only three different signals (FA at 161.0 ppm, FB at 138.9 ppm and FC at 150.0 ppm), where the fluorine atoms in the ortho and meta positions, FA and FB, integrate for two fluorine atoms due to their magnetic equivalence. Nevertheless, when the same experiment was carried out in the presence of a MA0.15FA0.85PbBr0.15I0.85 (MAFA perovskite, where MA and FA stand for methylammonium and formamidinium, respectively) perovskite solution, the three signals were split into five, changing the relative values of what they integrate for. Since the aim was to see any possible effect of any perovskite amine on IS2, MAFA and not MAPbI3 (MAPI) perovskite was used for this experiment. In the first case where IS2 alone is in solution, both sides of the aromatic ring are magnetically equivalent, explaining the integration for each of the fluorine atoms. However, the presence of perovskite precursors in solution suppresses this equivalency and new signals are found. The origin of these could be due to the fact that a new chemical species is being formed, in which the shift and multiplicity of the NMR signals is therefore altered. One possible explanation could be the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N or O atoms of the IS2 isoxazoline, which could act as Lewis bases, and perovskite amine or lead iodide (Fig. 1b). Due to the existence of a new non-coordinative bond through the isoxazoline moiety, the atoms in the aromatic ring would experience stronger electronic repulsions coming from the coordinating perovskite precursors. Therefore, the magnetic environment of fluorine atoms is changed, and so their chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the fluorine atom in the para position FC at 150.0 ppm is the less affected one in the aromatic ring, as it would be the furthest one in space from this potential coordinative bond.

These results point out the presence of some kind of interaction between the fullerene and perovskite precursors, but not specific bond formations. In order to tackle this issue, we thought of trying the same experiment but with each perovskite precursor individually (i.e., IS2:FAI and IS2:PbI2). The 19F-NMR spectra in Fig. S1† show that the 3 signals remained unchanged for all of these solutions. This finding suggests that IS2 might not be forming any complex with each precursor separately, as it might only participate in the complete perovskite complex.
Hence, these results suggest that IS2 might be able to coordinate perovskites in some way, probably because of to the isoxazoline group. In order to confirm the potential of this functionalisation, the preparation of a novel fullerene would be necessary. The idea was to combine the most successful molecules in ETL-free PSCs, C70 (ref. 21) and IS2,28 hoping for a synergistic structural effect. The resulting fullerene FU11 is a C70-cored IS2 analogue, thus holding the same isoxazoline group. FU11 was synthesised and fully characterised (ESI, Fig. S2–S6†). The first thought was to analyze FU11 by means of 19F-NMR, but in this case it was not feasible, since fluorine signals could not be properly resolved (Fig. S7†). This can be explained by the fact that C70 derivatives are not a unique molecule but a mixture of various regioisomers, showing different NMR patterns. Thus its suitable detection and assignment by 19F-NMR is more complicated than in the case of IS2. This is an issue to deal with when working with C70 derivatives, widely reported in the literature.52–54
With the new fullerene FU11 synthesised, spectroscopic analysis could be carried out considering both fullerene core- and functional group-related structural changes. Trying to find some kind of evidence on the bonds being formed between fullerenes and the perovskite, solutions of 1.2 M MAPI in DMSO with C60, C70, IS2 and FU11 were analyzed by means of FTIR spectroscopy. This also represents the first study of perovskite complexes in solution by means of FTIR, as every study done so far involved the preparation of perovskite powders in which the interactions with fullerene derivatives may be significantly different. Due to the wide-absorption range of the solvent (DMSO) in IR, the N–H stretching vibration was the only character that could be studied, which typically appears in the 3500–3000 cm−1 region. As it can be seen in Fig. 2a, the band for MAPI:C60 and MAPI:C70 remained in a comparable situation to the original pristine MAPI at 3145 cm−1, but for IS2 the band widened and shifted to higher wavenumber values (3164 cm−1). For the FU11 signal the shift was quite moderate, but it also experienced widening. This is a sign of the formation of H-bonds, potentially coming from fullerene–MA interactions. However, the shift of the N–H stretching vibration to higher energy values means that the N–H bond is stronger, which could mean that the potential H-bond between IS2 or FU11 and the amine would be weaker than the original one in the perovskite. Nevertheless, both shift and widening of the N–H signal point out the existence of IS2–perovskite interactions that do not occur in the rest of the fullerenes. Additionally, these two phenomena (i.e. shift and widening) were not observed when studying lead-free MAI solutions in the presence of these fullerenes (Fig. 2b). The spectra were identical for every MAI and MAI:fullerene solution, stressing that fullerenes and methylammonium do not establish any interaction when PbI2 is not in solution, even for the case of isoxazoline fullerenes. Overall, these results point towards the same direction as the ones obtained by 19F-NMR spectroscopy in Fig. 1 and S8,† as an interaction between IS2 or FU11 and the perovskite can be observed, but only in the presence of the full perovskite complex. Additionally, FTIR shows for the first time the formation of H-bonds between the functionalised fullerenes and perovskite amines, which might act as Lewis bases.

In order to further study the perovskite amine precursor, 1H-NMR experiments were carried out on the perovskite solution together with the studied fullerenes. Fig. S9† shows how protons at 8.9 ppm belonging to FA were deshielded and split into higher multiplicities, independent of the fullerene nature. This splitting could only be seen for the protons belonging to FA and not MA, due to the structure of the first one. FA protons can be differentiated in the shift value as there are two amine moieties in the same molecule, while MA contains only one, and the protonated form has resonance structures that hinder the free rotation of C–N bonds. Following the same line as the previous experiments, when solutions without PbI2 were measured (i.e. FAI:fullerenes), the effect of fullerenes vanished once again, showing unaffected FA protons in every case (Fig. S10†). However, C60 and C70 lack any functionalisation that would allow them to establish any H-bond with perovskite amine groups. Therefore, fullerenes might have some influence on perovskite amine groups in an indirect way, probably through the establishment of anion–π coordinative bonds between the fullerene cage and the iodide from PbI2 in the perovskite complex. As pointed out earlier, this kind of bond has been characterised in the literature for very diverse arene-anion systems,44–49 including fullerenes.22,33,50,51
In order to test the strength of the complexes that might be forming between the perovskite and different fullerenes, we decided to add a small fraction of toluene to the mixtures with perovskite:fullerene complexes. This is a solvent with high affinity to other non-polar molecules such as fullerenes; therefore we could expect toluene molecules to solvate fullerenes and, in turn, the complex to be broken, while monitoring all these changes by NMR. In this sense, the MAFA:fullerene solutions shown in Fig. S9† were analyzed again by 1H-NMR after the addition of a ¼ volume fraction of toluene-d8. As shown in Fig. 2c, for the non-substituted fullerenes C60 and C70 the splitting of the protons of FAI which the fullerene causes was no longer seen, whilst it remained for isoxazoline fullerenes IS2 and FU11. These results point to the formation of a stronger complex with the perovskite when the fullerene has a second binding group such as isoxazoline, as it does not disassemble when an aromatic co-solvent is added. In fact, all acquired spectroscopic data coherently point out the ability of functionalised fullerenes to form two-sided complexes with perovskites, suggesting that non-functionalised C60 and C70 participate in the perovskite complex just through anion–π bonds with PbI2 (Fig. 2d), whilst the ones with Lewis base functional groups (IS2) can also establish H-bonds with perovskite amines (Fig. 2e), leading to stronger complexes. It must be stressed that Fig. 2d and e are a tentative structural representation of the interactions under study and do not claim an exact perovskite–fullerene complex structure.
The layers were characterised by means of AFM in order to investigate the morphological properties, and in this sense the new fullerene FU11 was compared to its non-functionalised analogue C70. Even if at the initial measurement stages the two fullerene thin films are essentially similar (Fig. S11†), the surface chemistry-sensitive phase images reveal a strong time-evolution divergence depending of the fullerene type, as shown in Fig. 3. For the C70-containing perovskite films, the gradual increase of the phase signal can be correlated with the C70 diffusion to the surface (Fig. 3a).55 In contrast, this effect is absent in layers containing FU11, which remain stable over time (Fig. 3b). Similar measurements in far apart regions of the same sample lead to a completely reproducible behaviour: that is, a similar initial state and C70 diffusion towards the surface with time. Hence, we conclude that C70 diffusion is induced by the AFM itself and is probably due to the local surface heating by the AFM red laser used in beam deflection detection. A potential C70 migration from the film bulk to the surface which does not happen for FU11 might be related to the strength with which each of these fullerenes binds to the perovskite. While FU11 could have two binding spots to the perovskite in its structure as proposed previously, this is not the case for C70, for which the complex with the perovskite might not be strong enough and therefore migrates through the layer. This would mean that the strength with which the perovskite and fullerene interact in solution might also be transferred to the film scenario, and therefore fullerenes with more affinity to perovskites would potentially be able to, for example, passivate defects through more tight non-covalent bonds or complexes that may help the perovskite to crystallize into a higher quality layer. In addition to morphological properties and out of the aim of this particular work, further characterization of these layers by photoluminescence (PL) techniques would give important information about the effect of the strength of perovskite complexes on charge extraction. In previously reported studies, time-resolved PL data pointed out a picosecond-scale electron transfer from the perovskite to C70,43 which could be expected to be even faster for blend films formed from stronger perovskite–fullerene complexes, i.e. using FU11.

These layers were applied in the fabrication of devices with diverse configurations. In Table 1 the average and maximum values are shown and the distribution of PV parameter values for each of the device configurations is available in Fig. S12–S14.† First, MAPI layers containing C70 and FU11 were compared to the pristine perovskite in ETL-free devices on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTL and Au as the top contact. The whole structure can be seen in the cross-sectional micrograph acquired by means of field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) in Fig. 4a. As proven in the literature, the use of fullerenes such as C70 inside the perovskite layer greatly improves the quality of films that otherwise would show a high density of pinholes when deposited directly on FTO.21 In our case, the use of C70 helped achieve better PCE values, an effect that was enhanced when applying FU11. This outcome was tried to be reproduced in n-i-p devices with compact and mesoporous TiO2 (c- and mp-TiO2, respectively) as the ETL (Fig. 4b), but there was not such an improvement but a slight increase in the maximum PCE. Nevertheless, the improvement in the FF was particularly impressive, achieving excellent values of up to 81.8% with the use of FU11 (Fig. S13†), which is in agreement with most perovskite:fullerene blend applications in the literature.25,26,29 Finally, these fullerenes were tested in p-i-n devices, precisely on ITO/PTAA (indium tin oxide/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,5,6-trimentlyphenyl)amine]) substrates with C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Cu as the top contact (Fig. 4c). The cells improved with both fullerenes and moderately with C70-containing films, but with FU11, a narrow distribution of excellent PCE values was obtained. A device with a record PCE value of 18.3% was obtained, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.32 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1061 mV and a FF of 77.3%. These results, which mainly come from the improvement of the FF, might suggest that FU11 has an enhanced ability to passivate defects in the perovskite layer. The enhanced ability of FU11 could be related to the stronger complex that we have earlier proposed which it forms with the perovskite. The possibility of FU11 binding tightly to perovskite precursors might also favor binding potential defects in the perovskite at the grain boundaries. In this sense, the way in which the fullerene interacts with the perovskite in the precursor solution might have great importance, as it might influence the efficiency with which it can improve the film characteristics in terms of defect suppression. The present work indeed paves the way for further research towards deeper understanding of perovskite:fullerene systems and their relevance in defect density. As proven for C70 that fullerenes can increase the recombination resistance, the use of functionalized molecules would have the same or stronger effect, due to their probable enhanced potential to passivate defects.

Fullerene FU11 worked particularly well in p-i-n devices and showed the highest efficiency values among the different device architectures. We studied the microstructural properties of MAPI:FU11 layers on PTAA and, as shown in Fig. 5a in the top-view and cross-sectional (in the inset) micrographs, a flat layer with good morphology was achieved, with a large grain size distribution of 100–300 nm. Fig. 5b shows the J–V curve of the best device for each type of MAPI film, showing again the improvement that the fullerenes bring to p-i-n configurations. Small hysteresis could be observed, which was unchanged for every type of MAPI film. The maximum power point tracking as seen in Fig. 5c revealed a stabilised 18.3% PCE after 2 min at 1 sun illumination, being a stable value identical to the original value. In Fig. 5d we present the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best cell. The Jsc value that we could integrate from it was 22.22 mA cm−2, which is in perfect agreement with the Jsc value of 22.32 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V curve.

Conclusion
As a summary, by using a novel combination of spectroscopic techniques we provided further insights into the working mechanism in which a fullerene participates in a perovskite complex in solution, and how its functionalisation affects the outcome in the layer and device properties. Fullerenes that showed the ability to form stronger complexes with perovskites might be able to passivate defects in the perovskite film more effectively. With this purpose in mind, a novel, optimised fullerene was designed, which led to highly improved devices with a main enhancement in the FF. This strategy was furthermore proven to be universal for many types of devices of different configurations. Deepening the understanding of the working mechanisms of fullerenes and the relevance of their chemical nature in solution allowed controlling the system from the solution state to device fabrication, going through film properties. This would in turn pave the way for designing structurally advanced fullerenes, aimed at a particular behavior in the perovskite solution. In this sense, taking advantage of the knowledge gained with this study, a new fullerene with an optimised structure, FU11, could be synthesised and applied in blend films with perovskites, achieving efficiencies of up to 18.3% and universality for different cell configurations. Although there is still a lot to understand about these carbon nanomaterials for perovskite applications, this work sheds light on the next steps for the efficient application of these molecules towards future standard protocols.

Synthesis and materials
Chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Reactions under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere were performed in flame-dried glassware with dry solvents. For flash chromatography, silica gel (40–60 μm) from Acros was used. FU10 (2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzaldehyde oxime) was synthesised according to a literature procedure.28 Specific details about FU11 synthesis (Scheme S1) can be found in the ESI.†
Characterisation
The morphological properties of the films were analyzed with an ULTRA plus ZEISS FE-SEM. FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 6700, recording 32 scans with a resolution of 2 cm−1 using a liquid cell of 0.1 mm path length with AgCl windows. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 (1H: 300.2 MHz, 13C: 75.5 MHz, 19F: 376.4 MHz) at room temperature. The chemical shift (δ) is quoted in ppm relative to the internal standard tetramethylsilane (TMS). Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker-ULTRAFLEX III (MALDI-TOF) in the facilities of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Fullerene-containing perovskite thin films for AFM measurement were transferred from vacuum darkness conditions to a humidity controlled AFM chamber to avoid degradation. AFM measurements were carried out under a N2 controlled atmosphere (RH < 10%) at room temperature using a Nanotec S.L microscope operated in tapping mode with silicon tips (OMCL-C240TS-R3, nominal k = 3 N m−1 and f = 70 kHz). Freely available WSxM software has been used for image acquisition and processing.56
ETL-free device fabrication
Glass/FTO samples were cleaned by the following procedure: the samples were sonicated in distilled water with soap for 5 min, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, dried, and sonicated in acetone and 2-propanol for 15 min in each solvent. All the spin-coating layer deposition steps were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere. The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 7.71 mmol of MAI and 2.57 mmol of PbCl2 (molar ratio 3:1) in 3 mL of DMF and stirring overnight. Prior to deposition, the perovskite solution was saturated with the corresponding fullerene. The resulting solution was spin coated on the substrates following a two-step protocol, which consisted of a first step of 500 rpm for 5 s followed by a second step of 2000 rpm for 45 s. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 2 h. On top of the perovskite layer, the spiro-OMeTAD hole-selective contact was deposited from a solution that contained spiro-OMeTAD (108.4 mg) in chlorobenzene (953.4 μL), LiTFSI solution in MeCN (17.17 μL, 520 mg mL−1), and tert-butylpyridine (29.4 μL). The HTL was deposited by spin coating the solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were left in a desiccator overnight. Finally, an array of round Au back contacts (∼0.07 cm2) was deposited by thermal evaporation at more than 5 × 10−6 torr with a NANO38 (Kurt J. Lesker) apparatus with a shadow mask.
ETL-free device characterisation
The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured under a xenon arc lamp simulator equipped with an AM1.5G spectral filter (Sun 2000, ABET Technologies). The intensity was adjusted to provide 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) by using a calibrated silicon solar cell. Unless otherwise mentioned, the J–V characteristics were recorded by scanning the potential from higher than the Voc to zero at approximately 300 mV s−1. Before the measurement, a voltage of approximately 1.2 V was applied to the devices for 1 min.
n-i-p device fabrication
10 Ω sq−1 glass/FTO is cleaned by sonication in 2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 min. After rinsing with water, the substrates are further sonicated with ethanol for another 30 min and, after drying, with acetone for the same amount of time. After a 15 min UV–O3 treatment, a TiO2 compact layer is deposited on FTO via spin-coating from a 2 M TiCl4 solution in H2O. After a 5000 rpm/20 s spin-coating program, the substrates are sintered at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, a mesoporous TiO2 layer is deposited by spin coating for 10 s at 4000 rpm with a ramp of 2000 rpm s−1, using a 30 nm particle paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol to achieve a 150–200 nm thick layer. After the spin coating, the substrates are sintered with a heating ramp up to 450 °C, at which they are left for 30 min under a dry air flow. Li-doping of mesoporous TiO2 is achieved by spin coating a 10 mg mL−1 solution of LiTFSI in acetonitrile at 3000 rpm for 10 s. The substrate with Li-doped mesoporous TiO2 is completed with a second sintering process, the same as before. After cooling down to 150 °C the substrates are immediately transferred to a nitrogen atmosphere glove box for deposition of the perovskite films. The perovskite films are deposited from a freshly prepared precursor solution, containing PbI2:MAI, 1:1 mol/mol, 1.2 M in anhydrous DMSO, either pure or fullerene-saturated. The perovskite solution is spin coated following a two step-program at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s respectively. During the second step, 150 μL of chlorobenzene are dripped onto the spinning substrate 5 s prior to the end of the program. The substrates are then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min.
After perovskite annealing the substrates are allowed to cool down for a few minutes and 50 μL spiro-OMeTAD solution (70 mmol in chlorobenzene) are spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The HTM solution is doped with TBP (3.3 mol mol−1 with respect to spiro-OMeTAD), LiTFSI (1.8 M in acetonitrile, 0.5 mol mol−1 with respect to spiro-OMeTAD) and FK209 (0.25 M in acetonitrile, 0.03 mol mol−1 with respect to spiro). Finally, an 80 nm gold top electrode is thermally evaporated using a Quorum Q150T, under around 5 × 10−5 mbar, through an appropriate shadow mask (0.25 cm2 pixel).
n-i-p device characterisation
The solar cell performances were measured using a Solixon A-20 solar simulator. The current–voltage characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The employed voltage scan rate was 10 mV s−1 and no device preconditioning was applied before starting the measurement, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for long time. The cells were masked with a black metal mask (0.16 cm2) to estimate the active area and reduce the influence of scattered light.
p-i-n device fabrication
Glass/ITO samples were cleaned by the following procedure: the samples were sonicated in distilled water with soap for 5 min, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, dried, and sonicated in acetone and 2-propanol for 15 min in each solvent. After that, directly before HTM deposition, the substrates were treated in a UV–O3 cleaner for 15 min.
All the spin-coating layer deposition steps were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere. PTAA (2 mg mL−1 in toluene) was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 30 s) and annealed for 10 min at 100 °C on glass/ITO substrates. A 1.2 M MAPI perovskite solution was obtained by preparing a 1.5 M nominal MAI solution in DMF:DMSO (6:1 volume ratio) as the stock solution and adding the corresponding volume to PbI2. For perovskite:fullerene blend film preparation, DMF:DMSO mixtures for the MAI stock solution contained the corresponding fullerene in 0.05 mg mL−1 concentration. A volume of 100 mL of perovskite solution was spread on the substrate in a one step spin-coating process (4000 rpm for 35 s). A volume of 500 mL of ethyl acetate was dripped on the substrate 20 s after the start of the spin-coating process. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h. The substrates were covered by thermally evaporated layers of C60 (380 °C, 0.15 A s−1) and BCP (140 °C, 0.15 A s−1), with a thickness of 23 nm and 8 nm, respectively. Finally, an 80 nm thick Cu metal frame was evaporated as a top contact, defining an active area of 0.144 cm2.
p-i-n device characterisation
The current–voltage characteristics under 1 sun equivalent illumination were recorded using an Oriel LCS-100 class ABB solar simulator in a N2-filled glovebox, calibrated with a silicon reference cell from Fraunhofer ISE. The J–V curve was acquired with a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate and a voltage step of 10 mV. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 850 nm with a step of 10 nm using a home-built small-spot EQE system. A Stanford Research SR830 lock-in amplifier is used to measure the electrical response of the device under test and evaluated in TracQ-Basic software.
