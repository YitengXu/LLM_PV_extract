    , Accepted 12th October 2017First published on 13th October 2017AbstractThe performance of mobile soft robots is usually characterized by their locomotion/velocity efficiency, whereas the energy efficiency is a more intrinsic and fundamental criterion for the performance evaluation of independent or integrated soft robots. In this work, a general framework is established to evaluate the energy efficiency of mobile soft robots by considering the efficiency of the energy source, actuator and locomotion, and some insights for improving the efficiency of soft robotic systems are presented. Proposed as the ratio of the desired locomotion kinetic energy to the input mechanical energy, the energy efficiency of locomotion is found to play a critical role in determining the overall energy efficiency of soft robots. Four key factors related to the locomotion energy efficiency are identified, that is, the locomotion modes, material properties, geometric sizes, and actuation states. It is found that the energy efficiency of most mobile soft robots reported in the literature is surprisingly low (mostly below 0.1%), due to the inefficient mechanical energy that essentially does not contribute to the desired locomotion. A comparison of the locomotion energy efficiency for several representative locomotion modes in the literature is presented, showing a descending ranking as: jumping ≫ fish-like swimming > snake-like slithering > rolling > rising/turning over > inchworm-like inching > quadruped gait > earthworm-like squirming. Besides, considering the same locomotion mode, soft robots with lower stiffness, higher density and larger size tend to have higher locomotion energy efficiency. Moreover, a periodic pulse actuation instead of a continuous actuation mode may significantly reduce the input mechanical energy, thus improving the locomotion energy efficiency, especially when the pulse actuation matches the resonant states of the soft robots. The results presented herein indicate a large and necessary space for improving the locomotion energy efficiency, which is of practical significance for the future development and application of soft robots.
1. Introduction
Inspired by nature's soft biological systems, a growing number of technologies for soft robots (materials, fabrication, actuation, control, etc.) have been developed in recent years.1–10 Traditional (hard) robots are mostly composed of rigid parts and joints with limited capabilities in complex natural environments, and have poor compliance with the human body.6,8,9 In contrast, the long history of evolution has given bacteria, animals, and even some plants (e.g., the Venus flytrap11) the capacity of softness, flexibility, and adaptive deformation abilities. Some existing living animals that can be traced back to several hundred million years ago (e.g., the nautilus12) highlight their superior adaptability to the varying natural environments.
Soft organisms are ubiquitously favored by nature. Even animals with stiff exoskeletons or endoskeletons are mainly composed of soft tissues and liquid. For example, adult insects have a large quantity of inside soft tissue dominating their locomotion, and almost their entire body is soft during the larval stage. In another instance, the skeleton of an adult human being takes only about one-tenth of the body mass.5 The remarkable advantages of softness have inspired a lot of research interest in soft robotics in recent years. Due to the development of the synthesis, fabrication, actuation and control of soft materials and structures, many advanced bio-inspired robots have been proposed, including, for example, octopus-like robots,13–15 caterpillar/inchworm/earthworm-like robots,16–35 quadruped-like robots,36,37 fish/jellyfish-like robots,38–41 and snake-like robots.42–44 Taking the advantages of soft materials, soft robots are designed to have large deformation abilities, high flexibility, good impact resistance, low contact stress, unprecedented adaptation, high sensitivity, and friendly human–robot interfaces.6 Therefore, soft robots hold great potential in the applications of artificial organs, minimally invasive surgery, military reconnaissance, search-and-rescue operations, space exploration, etc.
Despite these promises, the development of mobile soft robots is still facing some challenges. One of them is the balance between the softness and load bearing capacity of the soft robots. A soft robot must bear its own weight. Careful attention should be paid to the size and weight of the whole or part of the soft robot.5 Another concern is the integration of soft robots which, to wirelessly implement their functions in practice, should be integrated with power sources, sensors, actuators, computation components, etc. Despite some efforts to scratch the surface of integrated soft robot prototypes,37,38,41,44,45 the power sources or actuators used in current soft robots are often too big, heavy or costly to be integrated.5–7,9 The commonly used actuators in soft robots are dielectric elastomers, shape memory alloys (SMAs), and pneumatic or hydraulic actuators.5 Dielectric elastomeric actuators require very high voltage (>10 V μm−1), the energy conversion efficiency of SMA-driven actuators is quite low (<1%), and pneumatic and hydraulic actuators are limited by their heavy electric valve system and air/fluid compressor.
For integrated soft robotic systems, the energy efficiency evaluation of the whole system (including the power source, sensor, actuator, body, etc.) is one of the most important factors to be explored. As an important performance assessment, the energy efficiency of the entire soft robotic system has not yet received sufficient attention. Previous works on soft robots mainly focused on the kinetic locomotion efficiency (e.g., the locomotion speed).13,17,22–25,27,29,31,33–35,39–44,46–48 Only a few works mentioned the energy efficiency. The energy consumption of an earthworm-inspired soft robot with SMA actuation was measured.24,30 Seok et al.32 analyzed the average power consumption of the earthworm-like soft robot and the energy balance was discussed in a recent work on a soft robotic fish.38 Furthermore, the energy transfer efficiency of a rolling robot called GoQBot18 was evaluated considering three locomotion modes, i.e. crawling, inching and rolling. However, up to now a general framework to evaluate the energy efficiency of a whole mobile soft robotic system has not been proposed and there still lacks an energy efficiency map for the different locomotion modes.
In general, the energy efficiency is a comprehensive measure of soft robots that can characterize their dynamic performance, continuous servicing ability, manufacturing cost, operation cost, structural integration quality, sustainability, reliability, etc. For wireless soft robots, the energy efficiency is especially important as it directly determines how long the robots can work in practical applications. Besides, the energy efficiency is also a good indicator that can guide the design and optimization of soft robots. An optimal energy efficiency may be achieved through properly selecting the actuator, power source, material, structure, locomotion mode, and so on. Compared to the locomotion efficiency (i.e. the locomotion speed), the energy efficiency is a more intrinsic and fundamental criterion for soft robot performance evaluation. This work aims to construct a general energy efficiency evaluation framework of soft robots and present an energy efficiency map for the representative existing mobile soft robot prototypes and designs.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, an energy efficiency evaluation framework for soft robots is developed, which is used to evaluate some typical soft robots from the literature in Section 3. The effects of the locomotion modes, material properties, geometric sizes and actuating states on the locomotion energy efficiency are also discussed in this section. Some insights for improving the energy efficiency of soft robotic systems are presented in Section 4. Brief concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
2. Framework for the assessment of the energy efficiency of mobile soft robots
Soft robots can be generally divided into two functional types: mobile soft robots and soft manipulators. The current paper focuses on the first type. The energy efficiency is usually defined as the ratio between the effective output work and the total input energy in traditional hard mechanical systems. In a closed system, the energy efficiency is always less than 100%. Here, we borrow this concept to develop a general energy efficiency framework for soft robotic systems.
For the practical application of soft robots, they may include a power source, actuator, computation components, sensors, feedback components, and potential energy harvesting components. Therefore, the general energy efficiency framework of whole soft robotic systems should include the energy efficiency of these major components, as shown in the energy balance map in Fig. 1. The power source is an energy storage or conversion machine supplying energy to the whole system. The actuator obtains energy from the power source and converts it into mechanical energy. The sensors and feedback components are responsible for sensing, control and communication. The energy harvesting components may provide additional energy to supplement the whole system.

2.1 Energy efficiency of the power source
Referring to Fig. 1, the total energy, E0, stored in the power source has two parts, i.e. the energy loss during the energy supplying process (Eloss-1), and the energy that is transferred to the rest of the system (Ein). The energy efficiency of the power source can be expressed as (1)
Two types of power source can be treated to have 100% energy efficiency. First, the energy in the power source can be fully used to drive the actuator, such as for a gasoline driven actuator (heat engine) where the required gasoline can be simply stored in a tank and fully transported to the actuator with no energy loss. Second, when the actuator is directly driven by an external energy source, the energy supply for the robot can be considered as inexhaustible. Apart from these two types, the energy efficiency of commonly used electrical power sources, which first convert other types of energy into electrical energy and then drive the actuators, is listed in Table 1.

2.2 Energy efficiency of the actuator
A major part of the input energy from the power source (Ein) and the harvested energy from the environment (Eh) is used to drive the actuators. Letting Etr denote the energy inputted to the sensors, feedback systems, and computing systems, the total energy input for the actuator is Ein + Eh − Etr. Thus, the energy efficiency of the actuator can be expressed as (2)where Em and Eloss-2 are the output mechanical energy and energy loss of the actuator, respectively. The energy efficiency of some commonly used mechanical actuators is listed in Table 2.

2.3 Energy efficiency of locomotion

2.3.1 A general description. 
For a mobile soft robot, its locomotion is driven by the deformation of the soft robot body. However, a large amount of the mechanical energy of the soft robot body (i.e. the output mechanical energy of the actuator) does not transfer to the desired locomotion energy. Therefore, the locomotion energy efficiency plays an important role in determining the energy efficiency of soft robotic systems. When discussing the energy balance of the locomotion, previous works focused on the friction dissipation and material damping, but the ineffective energy transformation between the deformation energy of soft robot body and the desired locomotion energy has rarely been studied.42 In this work, we focus on the locomotion energy efficiency of soft robots and several strategies are proposed to improve the locomotion energy efficiency.
During the locomotion of soft robots, the motion in one locomotion cycle (assuming the locomotion of the soft robot is periodic) is usually accompanied by body deformation, relative movement of internal components, and/or movement of the center of gravity. A large amount of the deformation, kinetic and gravitational energy of the soft robot may not transfer to the kinetic energy of the desired locomotion (Eloco). If these energies cannot transfer between each other, they will be dissipated in one cycle (Eloss-4). Taking the inchworm-like soft robot as an example, forward locomotion is achieved by the bending of the soft robot body. However, the bending deformation energy in one cycle cannot be reused in the next cycle, so that is dissipated. Another energy loss, Eloss-3, is the mechanical energy dissipation by friction and material damping. Thus, the total mechanical energy output of the actuator consists of Em = Eloco + Eloss-4 + Eloss-3(3)
The mechanical locomotion energy efficiency, ηloco, is defined as (4)
Besides, the energy harvesting efficiency of the robot is defined as (5)
It is noted that, because of the energy harvesting, the nominal energy efficiency (η) may be greater than 100%. The energy consumption ratio of the non-mechanical components, such as the sensors and feedback and controlling systems, is defined as (6)
Finally, the total energy efficiency η of the soft robotic system is deduced as (7)ηsource, ηactuator, and ηloco all range from 0% to 100%. The energy consumption of the non-mechanical components (sensors, controlling system, etc.), Etr, usually takes a very little amount of E0, thus ηtr → 0. Besides, energy harvesting is rarely considered in current soft robotic systems. Thus the total energy efficiency can be reduced to η = ηsourceηactuatorηloco·100%.(8)


2.3.2 Work of the actuators. 
Soft robots are usually actuated by so-called “artificial muscles” which refer to materials or devices that can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate under external stimuli (e.g., voltage, current, pressure or temperature). Similar to biological muscles, “artificial muscles” have four types of working state,55,56i.e. motor, brake, spring and strut. The motor-like working state is a relatively slow loading process during which the actuator does positive work WM (the shaded area under the curve OAB in Fig. 2(a) or the up-stairs process in Fig. 2(c)). The brake-like working state corresponds to an unloading process during which the actuator does negative work WB to the soft robots (the value of the shaded area under the curve BA′O in Fig. 2(a) or the down-stairs process in Fig. 2(c)). The net work of the above two processes WM + WB (WB < 0) contributes to the locomotion. It should be noted that when there is no energy harvesting mechanism in the biological muscles or artificial muscles, the actuators consume energy in the brake-like working process even if they do negative work to the whole system. For example, people still consume energy when they go down stairs. Therefore, the total output work of the actuators in a motor/brake cycle is between WM and WM + |WB|. In the spring-like working state, the soft robot body works in resonant mode, and the actuators do positive work which partly contributes to the locomotion (the shaded area in Fig. 2(b) or the pendulum movements in Fig. 2(c)). In this working state, the kinetic and potential energy of the soft robot body are in a dynamic balance, while the effective locomotion energy and friction and damping dissipation are supplied by the output work of the actuators. In principle, this system should exhibit high energy efficiency. In fact, the running of quadruped animals or jumping of kangaroos usually benefits from the advantage of such a working state.56,57 However, as the actuation frequency of current soft robots is usually at a very low level, the actuators of most soft robots still work at the motor/brake-like states. Besides, the actuators may have another working state, i.e. the strut-like holding state, which keeps a deformation for a certain time, such as grasping or positioning for soft grasping robots.

2.3.3 Effective locomotion energy. 
As previously mentioned, a considerable amount of the mechanical energy of soft robots (deformation energy, gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy induced by motion in undesired directions, etc.) doesn’t transfer to the locomotion kinetic energy. For example, for snake-like slithering locomotion, only a small part of the mechanical energy from the actuator (Em in Fig. 1) is converted into forward locomotion kinetic energy (Eloco), while the remaining part of Em is converted into the slithering deformation energy of the soft body. Though the deformation energy is essential for realizing the motion of soft robots, a large part of the strain energy doesn’t transfer to the forward (locomotive) kinetic energy, so that is dissipated (Eloss-4). A soft robot with repeated deformation, but without the desired locomotion, has zero locomotion energy efficiency.
As soft robot actuators based on the artificial muscle mechanism are usually actuated in a periodic or cyclic manner, the locomotion of the soft robots studied herein is also periodic. The output mechanical energy of the soft robot actuators is partly transferred to the locomotion kinetic energy. The effective locomotion energy is defined as (9)where M is the total mass of the robot and  is the average translational velocity of the mass center in the desired locomotion direction. Taking the rolling robot (GoQBot) as an example, the effective locomotion energy is the translational kinetic energy, and the rotational kinetic energy around its mass center should be excluded. Taking GoQBot as an example, according to the definition of effective locomotion energy,  is about 0.66 m s−1 (the average velocity of the mass center during one “push-off” (t > 250 ms), see Fig. 7(b) of ref. 18), and M = 6.2 g, thus Eloco = 0.5 × 6.2 × 0.662 mJ = 1.35 mJ. Based on the definition of the effective locomotion energy and other energy components in this work (e.g., E0, Em, Eloss-4, Eloss-3, etc.), the energy efficiency of the whole soft robotic system can be deduced.

3. Energy efficiency evaluation of mobile soft robots
Based on the energy efficiency framework developed above, we present an overview of the energy efficiency of mobile soft robots in the literature, by considering the effects of the locomotion modes, power source and actuator types, body material properties, actuator working states and size of soft robots.
3.1 Effect of the locomotion modes
The nature-inspired locomotion modes have a variety of forms, such as aquatic locomotion (e.g., fish swimming and benthic locomotion of echinoderm), aquatic surface locomotion (e.g., water striders and basilisk lizards), aerial locomotion (e.g., banded flying snakes, flying fish, birds, and spiders), subterranean locomotion (e.g., moles, tilefish, mole crickets, and earthworms), arboreal locomotion (e.g., monkeys, geckos, and arboreal snails), and terrestrial locomotion (e.g., kangaroos, lions, and the multi-legged millipede). Many types of soft robot with different locomotion modes have been developed recently. Besides, an animal's locomotion mode may be remarkably changed during its life-cycle or living environment changes (e.g., frogs and diving birds). In this work, we classify the soft robots into nine typical locomotion modes to simplify the theoretical analysis, and for each locomotion mode the energy efficiency of several representative soft robots in the literature is studied (Table 3 and Fig. 3). In addition, it should be pointed out that the energy efficiency of the mobile soft robots is determined not only by the locomotion modes, but also by their materials, geometric sizes, actuation types, etc. Actually, partial effects of these parameters are already built into Table 3 and Fig. 3. Hence, improving the energy efficiency of mobile soft robots should properly optimize the parameters of the locomotion mode, material, geometric size, actuation type and so on.

a The data of soft robots from ref. 27, 42 and 61 is calculated based on numerical simulation and assuming pneumatic actuation (ηactuator = 40%) with an external compressed gas source (ηsource = 100%). The Ein value of these models is evaluated based on the simulation results. Especially, considering the motor/brake-like working state (Section 2.3.2), the spatial integration of the temporal maximum total energy density of the soft robot body in one locomotion cycle (including the kinetic energy, strain energy, gravitational potential energy, and friction and viscous dissipation) is a conservative estimation of Ein. The strain energy of these soft robots is calculated as the bending deformation energy of the soft robot body , where E, I, κmax and s are the Young's modulus, cross-sectional moment of inertia, maximum curvature at point s in one locomotion cycle, and natural coordinate along the beam axis, respectively.

 Fig. 3  The energy efficiency of soft robots with different locomotion modes. Two hard component based quasi-soft robots are also considered for comparison. The data for models extracted from ref. 27, 42 and 61 is calculated based on numerical simulation (see notes of Table 3) and assuming pneumatic actuation (ηactuator = 40%) with a separated compressed gas source (ηsource = 100%). 
To get a full view of the energy efficiency analysis, the energy balance of the multi-gait soft robot presented by Shepherd et al.36,37 is analyzed in detail as an example. The multi-gait soft robot is actuated pneumatically. According to the flow rate of the compressed air, pressure and time (data from ref. 37), the output work of the mini air compressors is (214 kPa–1 atm) × 2 L min−1 × 1.6 h = 21.6 kJ, and the output work of the lithium–polymer battery (ignoring the energy lost in the battery, i.e. ηsource ≈ 100%) is approximately 3.7 V × 3200 mA h = 42.6 kJ. Thus the energy efficiency of the actuator is ηactuator = 21.6 kJ/42.6 kJ = 50.7%. Next, we calculate ηloco. According to ref. 22, the total mass of the multi-gait soft robot is 2.2 kg/(44%) = 5 kg, and the average moving speed of the center of mass is 18.0 m h−1. Consequently, the locomotion kinetic energy (Eloco) of the quadruped gait is 0.5 × 5 kg × (18.0 m h−1)2 = 62.5 μJ. The output power of the mini air compressors is (214 kPa–1 atm) × 2 L min−1 = 3.76 W, and the cycle time of the quadruped gaits is 23 s (Fig. 3 in ref. 36). The output work of the mini air compressors (Em) in one cycle can be calculated as 3.76 W × 23 s = 86.5 J. Thus, the locomotion energy efficiency is ηloco = Eloco/Em = 0.000072%. Finally, the energy efficiency of the multi-gait soft robotic system can be obtained as η = ηsourceηactuatorηloco = 0.000037%, which is surprisingly low, and the locomotion energy efficiency is dominant in determining the energy efficiency of the multi-gait soft robot.
For other locomotion modes of soft robots, their energy efficiency can be deduced with a similar analysis and the results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 3. Two hard component based quasi-soft robots17,21,58,59 and a stiff jumping robot60 are also included in Fig. 3. Here, we assume the efficiency of the pneumatic actuation is ηactuator = 40% with an external compressed gas source ηsource = 100%. The energy efficiency of the soft robots in ref. 27, 42 and 61 is calculated based on numerical simulations.
It can be seen from Table 3 and Fig. 3 that the energy efficiency of most soft robots is extremely low, except for the jumping locomotion which benefits from the large reaction force from the ground. Apart from the jumping locomotion, the fish-like swimming locomotion and snake-like slithering locomotion have the highest energy efficiency. Besides, the energy efficiencies of the creeping locomotion and inchworm-like locomotion are larger than that of the quadruped gait locomotion. The extremely low energy efficiency of the quadruped gait locomotion and earthworm-like squirming locomotion may be due to the large amount of body deformation energy and frictional energy dissipation (similar to their biological counterparts63). In general, an energy efficiency order for the nine typical locomotion modes is: jumping ≫ fish-like swimming > snake-like slithering > rolling > creeping > rising/turning over > inchworm-like inching > quadruped gait > earthworm-like squirming. Note that the energy efficiency of the different locomotion modes ranges across several orders of magnitude, indicating the significance of the effect of the locomotion modes on the energy efficiency.
Comparing Tables 1–3, ηsource·ηactuator is much larger than the total energy efficiency η. For most current soft robots, the low total energy efficiency is caused by the low locomotion energy efficiency (i.e. ηloco in eqn (8)). Further analysis indicates that Eloss-4 caused by the ineffective energy transfer between the deformation energy of the soft robot body and the desired locomotion energy is the major energy loss which accompanies the whole locomotion process. It can be verified that if the deformation energy of a soft robot body is treated as the locomotion energy, i.e. Eloss-4 is ignored (e.g., ref. 18), the total energy efficiency would be at a magnitude of 10−1 for most types of soft robot listed in Table 3. However, we don’t think such a treatment is reasonable, since a major part of the deformation energy doesn’t contribute to the desired locomotion. The ineffective energy transfer of the mechanical energy to the locomotion kinetic energy seems to be an intrinsic defect for mobile soft robots, as they are usually driven by the deformation of the whole body. However, there is a large space for energy efficiency improvement. Proper design of the locomotion mode and soft robot structure may substantially reduce Eloss-4 and significantly improve the energy efficiency of soft robots (a similar idea of locomotion mode optimization to improve the energy efficiency of the stiff robot can be found in ref. 64).
3.2 Effect of the material properties and geometrical sizes
The body softness of soft robots can significantly affect their function and performance. However, this was rarely studied in previous works. Body softness is related to the Young's modulus, density and geometrical size of soft robots. Indeed, the Young's modulus of the soft materials used in soft robots may vary in a relative wide range (<1 GPa6) and the size of soft robots can be from micro-scale to macro-scale. Through a set of soft robots with different Young's modulus, density, and geometrical sizes which have been developed, the quantitative relation of these factors to the energy efficiency is studied in this section. We intend to explore the effects of each individual factor on the energy efficiency. Taking the snake-like slithering locomotion soft robot as an example,42 finite element method simulations via the ABAQUS65 software were carried out to study the effects of the Young's modulus, density and size of soft robots on the energy efficiency.
We first consider a standard model of the snake-like slithering locomotion soft robot in ref. 42 with dimensions of 1 × 0.05 × 0.05 m3, wriggling motion period of 4 s, and maximum bending curvature of 4 m−1. The energy efficiency of the standard model ηsourceηactuator·0.001% based on the numerical simulation is set as the reference value. The material Young's modulus, density, and geometrical size are varied separately from the standard model to study the effects of each individual factor on the energy efficiency. The material properties and geometrical size of the soft robot as well as its locomotion speed and energy efficiency are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  The effect of typical material properties and geometric scale on the energy efficiency of the soft robot. The data is calculated based on a numerical simulation and considering pneumatic actuation (ηactuator = 40%) with a separated compressed gas source (ηsource = 100%). The material properties are listed in Table 4. The standard model refers to ref. 42 considering the dimensions as 1 × 0.05 × 0.05 m3, wriggling motion period as 4 s (twice the locomotion cycle), and maximum bending curvature as 4 m−1. The 1/3 scale model has dimensions 1/3 × 0.05/3 × 0.05/3 m3. 
It is found that the slithering locomotion soft robots with higher Young's modulus or lower density have larger locomotion velocity42 but lower energy efficiency. FEM simulations (Table 4 and Fig. 4) indicate that the locomotion speed change ratio is much smaller than that of the material properties. For the same locomotion mode and deformation, the strain (kinetic) energy is generally proportional to the Young's modulus (density). Therefore, a high Young's modulus causes large strain energy, and thus increases the deformation energy requirements and introduces more locomotion energy loss (Eloss-4); on the other hand, a lower density has lower kinetic energy for the same locomotion velocity, and thus decreases the effective locomotion energy (Eloco). Note that the density also includes the loading of the soft mobile robots. In general, a soft robot with full loading (e.g. camera or storage box) has a higher energy efficiency than that without load. However, for practical soft mobile robots, a balance between the locomotion speed and energy efficiency should be made.
As to the size effect, a 1/3 scaled model was studied with dimensions of 1/3 × 0.05/3 × 0.05/3 m3, and the material properties remained the same as the standard model. It was found that the locomotion speed of the 1/3 scaled model is approximately 1/3 of that of the standard model. The energy efficiency of the 1/3 scaled model decreases to about 1/10 of that of the standard one.
To figure out the underlying mechanism of the size effect on the energy efficiency, the 1/3 scaled model was converted to the full size model based on the similarity principle, i.e. the Young's modulus and density of the soft robot were changed as shown in the last column of Table 4. The similarity model has the same energy efficiency as that of the 1/3 scaled model. Thus, the size effect on the energy efficiency can be integrated into the effect of the material properties.
We further use the parameter  to describe the combined effects of the Young's modulus E and density ρ on the energy efficiency, as shown in Fig. 5. The effect of the material properties on the energy efficiency is very complicated as the soft mobile robots usually experience highly nonlinear contact behavior.42 It is hard to derive an analytical relation of the relative energy efficiency to the Young's modulus and density. Based on the FEM simulation results, an exponential decay law is adopted to describe the combined effects of the material properties on the energy efficiency, (10)where A is the maximum ideal relative energy efficiency, α (s m−1) is an attenuation index, and δ is the geometric scale factor. For the snake-like slithering locomotion soft robot, A = 6.6, α = 0.0057 s m−1, and δ = 1 for the full size model or 1/3 for the 1/3 scaled model. Eqn (10) gives a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the material properties on the energy efficiency of the soft robot. Based on Eqn (10), the upper limit of the maximum ideal relative energy efficiency is 660%. The index α has the dimension of strain/velocity, and can be considered as a ratio of the deformation level to the mobility. A small α indicates that the locomotion mode has a relative large locomotion speed under a small deformation level. In summary, it can be claimed that α is determined by the locomotion mode, while A is determined by the reference valve, i.e. the relative energy efficiency of the selected standard model is 100%. It should be noted that if E/ρ or 1/δ is too low, the soft robots may lose their functionality, as deformation caused by gravity may play an important role and the soft robots cannot even bear their own weight. Thus, for a pair of A and α, the range of E/ρ or 1/δ should be limited to guarantee similar locomotion modes. If E/ρ or 1/δ is too small, the locomotion mode is significantly changed, so that A and α should be redefined, and the original maximum ideal potential relative energy efficiency is hard to be achieved.
 Fig. 5  The exponential relationship between the relative energy efficiency of a snake-like soft robot42 and the corresponding typical material properties considering the same model scale. The model parameters refer to the statements in Fig. 4. The parameters for the 1/3 scale model are calculated based on the similarity principle (the last column of Table 4). The maximum ideal relative energy efficiency could be up to 660%. 
In fact, we have found the exponential relationship is a general law and applicable to other types of soft robot with different locomotion modes. For example, for the inchworm-like soft robot,27 its energy efficiency also follows the exponential relationship with different values of A and α (Fig. 6). In Fig. 6, the density and Young's modulus are the same as those listed in Table 4. The Poisson ratio is 0.3 for all cases.
 Fig. 6  The exponential relationship between the relative energy efficiency of an inchworm-like soft robot27 and the corresponding typical material properties considering the same model scale. The density and Young's modulus of the inchworm-like soft robot are the same as the ones listed in Table 4. The Poisson ratio is 0.3 for all cases. The maximum ideal relative energy efficiency could be up to 2770%. 
At the end of this section, it should be noted that for the practical applications of soft robots, many factors will be considered and the optimal design should be the balance of the energy efficiency, locomotion speed, functionality, etc. For example, a lower modulus has a better energy efficiency, but causes a lower locomotion speed. In addition, the size of a soft robot could also have significant effects on its functionality and application. When the size of soft robots goes down to micro- or nano-scale, the soft robot can be actuated by external fields or environments, such as light, humidity, temperature, electric/magnetic fields et al.40,48,66–68 Therefore, micro- or nano-scale soft robots can obtain an energy supply from their working environments and the shortcoming of the low energy efficiency of soft robots may be overcome.
3.3 Effect of the actuation state on the energy efficiency of soft robots
As shown in Fig. 3, the fish-like swimming soft robot40 exhibits a relatively high energy efficiency, which may be partly attributed to its periodic pulse excitation. To realize the pulse excitation, the actuator outputs a pulse force in every loading cycle, so that the soft robot body works in its resonant mode. The energy loss Eloss-4 is decreased for soft robots working at resonant mode (benefiting from the spring-like working state, Section 2.3.2) and thus the total energy efficiency is increased. In fact, for some deformation based hard mechanical actuators (e.g. ultrasonic motors), the frequency of the driving signal is also near the resonant frequency of the deforming body to obtain high energy efficiency. We emphasize that such an energy-saving driving mechanism may also be applicable to soft robots. Soft robots can work in their resonant mode with high energy efficiency if the locomotion mode and pulse actuation match each other. To fully utilize the resonant mode, the deformation mode of the soft body should be designed as one of its natural vibration modes, and the frequency of the pulse actuation is suggested to be the corresponding natural frequency.
In order to study the effect of actuation states on the energy efficiency of soft robots, two simulation cases (the continuous actuation state and pulse actuation state) are carried out for the inchworm-like inching soft robot.27 The results are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The locomotion speeds of the two cases are similar, but the energy input of the pulse actuation is much smaller than that of the continuous actuation state. Here, the input energy is proportional to the increase of the bending energy (proportional to the square of the curvature, see note a of Table 3) during the actuation period. On the other hand, the increase of the curvature is proportional to the increase of the temperature.27 Thus, the energy inputs of the examples in Fig. 7 can be calculated based on the temperature change (the temperature change in Fig. 7(b) is much smaller than that of Fig. 7(a)). Based on our calculation, the model with pulse actuation (Fig. 7(b)) has a much higher energy efficiency (relatively 215% higher) compared to the continuous actuation state. A detailed analysis about the effect of actuation states on the energy efficiency of soft robots will be presented in our future works.
 Fig. 7  The locomotion characteristics of an inchworm-like soft robot27 with (a) continuous and (b) pulse driven signal (the first natural frequency of the soft mobile robot is about 1 Hz). The locomotion velocities of the two cases are close to each other but the energy inputs are very different. 
4. Improving the energy efficiency for mobile soft robotic systems
Locomotion of a mobile soft robot results from the soft body deformation, as well as the interactions of the soft body deformation with the surrounding environment. For most of the soft robots presented in the literature, unfortunately, a large part of the body deformation may not result in a valid interaction with the environment. During locomotion, little deformation energy contributes to the locomotion. Therefore, increasing the energy efficiency of soft robotic systems is mostly dependent on the reduction of the unnecessary deformation energy and the improvement of the body–environment interaction. Though soft robots have a natural advantage of deformation, it does not mean that a larger deformation is better. To realize shape reconfiguration for the purpose of locomotion, in most cases, it is not necessary for the whole soft body to deform. The walking legs of human beings, for example, only involve significant bending of the knee-joint while other parts remain undeformed, compared to the whole-body bending of the quadruped soft robot. We believe that a similar mechanism can be used in soft robots where instead of deforming the whole body, body components linked by soft and deformable materials are sufficient for locomotion. During locomotion, only the soft linkers deform and in this way the deformation energy is reduced.
Interaction with the environment is critical for locomotion. The swimming robot, showing higher energy efficiency, benefits from a better interaction than that of the robots on ground. By interacting with water, every segment of the soft body may generate driving force during undulatory swimming. For some fast-moving locomotion modes, running for example, a firm interaction with the ground is essential. In this case, rigidity of the soft body is required to generate a large force in a short time by pushing against the ground for fast movement. Again, the whole body doesn’t have to be soft; with proper structural design, a composite of soft and rigid materials may work better; such strategy is widely found in the “bone-muscle” systems of higher animals.
Proper selection of the soft robot materials and sizes is an additional way to improve their energy efficiency in the comprehensive design of a soft robotic system. After satisfying the prior requirements, e.g. the functionality, size limit, and weight limit, the energy efficiency can be further improved by increasing the softness, density (including workload) and geometric sizes of the soft body.
Finally, resonant response has additional advantages in improving the energy efficiency because of the dynamic balance between kinetic and potential energy. Particularly, the wave-like deformation is expected to be partially contributed by wave propagation (the widely used ultrasonic motor is a typical example that the resonant actuation can learn from).
5. Conclusions
For wireless soft robots, it is necessary to integrate all of the functional components (e.g. the power sources, sensors, actuators, control system, etc.) together. To achieve good performance and sustainability, the energy efficiency of whole soft robotic systems should be systematically studied. A general framework is established to evaluate the energy efficiency of whole soft robotic systems by considering the energy efficiency of the energy source, actuator and locomotion. A large amount of the mechanical energy outputted by the actuator does not transfer to the desired locomotion kinetic energy, so the locomotion energy efficiency plays an important role in determining the total energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of soft robots in the literature (experimental prototypes or simulation/theoretical models) were studied, which shows that the energy efficiency for most soft robots is very low (below 0.1%). In contrary, hard machines usually have a higher efficiency. For example the energy efficiency of cars is larger than 14%.69
In general, the locomotion energy efficiency is significantly influenced by the locomotion modes with the order of jumping ≫ fish-like swimming > snake-like slithering > rolling > rising/turning over > inchworm-like inching > quadruped gait > earthworm-like squirming. Their energy efficiencies range from 10% (jumping), to 0.1% (swimming), and to less than 0.001% for the quadruped gait and earthworm-like squirming. Besides, the effects of material properties, i.e. Young's modulus and density, and geometrical size on the energy efficiency can be described by an exponential law with a unified parameter . Pulsing the actuator to make the soft robots work in their resonant mode is also helpful to improve the energy efficiency. Due to the designability of soft robots, there is a large space for energy efficiency improvement. However, for the practical application of soft robots, a balance among the energy efficiency, locomotion speed, functionality, etc. should be made. These findings provide useful insights to improve or optimize soft robot performance, and the energy efficiency evaluation framework developed in this work is expected to guide future soft robot experiments, integration, and application.

 	Fig. 3  The energy efficiency of soft robots with different locomotion modes. Two hard component based quasi-soft robots are also considered for comparison. The data for models extracted from ref. 27, 42 and 61 is calculated based on numerical simulation (see notes of Table 3) and assuming pneumatic actuation (ηactuator = 40%) with a separated compressed gas source (ηsource = 100%).

 	Fig. 4  The effect of typical material properties and geometric scale on the energy efficiency of the soft robot. The data is calculated based on a numerical simulation and considering pneumatic actuation (ηactuator = 40%) with a separated compressed gas source (ηsource = 100%). The material properties are listed in Table 4. The standard model refers to ref. 42 considering the dimensions as 1 × 0.05 × 0.05 m3, wriggling motion period as 4 s (twice the locomotion cycle), and maximum bending curvature as 4 m−1. The 1/3 scale model has dimensions 1/3 × 0.05/3 × 0.05/3 m3.

 	Fig. 5  The exponential relationship between the relative energy efficiency of a snake-like soft robot42 and the corresponding typical material properties considering the same model scale. The model parameters refer to the statements in Fig. 4. The parameters for the 1/3 scale model are calculated based on the similarity principle (the last column of Table 4). The maximum ideal relative energy efficiency could be up to 660%.	 

 	Fig. 6  The exponential relationship between the relative energy efficiency of an inchworm-like soft robot27 and the corresponding typical material properties considering the same model scale. The density and Young's modulus of the inchworm-like soft robot are the same as the ones listed in Table 4. The Poisson ratio is 0.3 for all cases. The maximum ideal relative energy efficiency could be up to 2770%.	 

 	Fig. 7  The locomotion characteristics of an inchworm-like soft robot27 with (a) continuous and (b) pulse driven signal (the first natural frequency of the soft mobile robot is about 1 Hz). The locomotion velocities of the two cases are close to each other but the energy inputs are very different.
