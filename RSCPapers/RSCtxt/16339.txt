    , Accepted 15th June 2018First published on 20th June 2018AbstractA hybrid solar cell (HSC) based on a solution-processable binary blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD) with a dendritic TiO2/Sb2S3 nanorod composite film was successfully fabricated for the first time. The sparse dendritic TiO2 structure was beneficial for the growth of Sb2S3 nanorods in the adjacent dendritic TiO2 structure. Owing to the well-matched energy levels of TiO2, Sb2S3, P3HT, and spiro-OMeTAD, electrons were effectively separated and transported. The HSC assembled of TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD/Au composite films achieved a highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.53%, and the corresponding stability was investigated over one month.
1. Introduction
Hybrid solar cells (HSCs) have seen much development in the last few years. The cost, efficiency, and durability of each component in HSCs are important factors when considering solar use. Solar cells based on crystalline silicon are highly efficient, but are expensive owing to the high temperatures and doping processes required for their fabrication.1 Innovation is needed to combine relatively low-cost production technologies (organic solar cells) with relatively high conversion efficiencies (inorganic solar cells) to decrease the cost of solar electricity to compete with conventional electricity production and help resolve the increasing energy crisis. Therefore, HSCs have attracted extensive attention in the development of low cost, highly efficient, and stable photovoltaic devices.2,3
In HSC devices, an organic polymer functions as the electron donor to harvest sunlight, generate excitons, and transport holes.2 Owing to its physical properties and hole-transport mechanism, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) is among the most versatile organic compounds for applications in photovoltaics and other devices.4,5 As a semiconducting conjugated polymer, P3HT possesses useful optoelectronic properties, such as a high mobility, good chemical stability, and a low optical band gap.6–8 Furthermore, as a hole-transporting material (HTM), P3HT is an important organic p-type semiconductor in HSCs. Liu et al. have studied the solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid solar cells based on ZnO/Sb2S3/P3HT heterojunctions, in which P3HT incorporation resulted in a PCE of 2.9%.9 Furthermore, organic p-type semiconductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has also been used as an effective hole transporting material in solid-state solar cells.10 Efficient electronic regeneration and high pore filling capabilities in the mesoporous nanostructure make spiro-OMeTAD a better hole transporter than other highly conductive organic polymers.11 Recent research has shown that a spiro-OMeTAD HTM layer with a thickness of >400 nm can guarantee a higher open-circuit voltage and hinder charge recombination.12 An amorphous nature, good conductivity with dopants, and high melting point make spiro-OMeTAD an adaptable HTM.13 However, the use of a P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system as a hole conductor for HSCs has yet to be reported.
Inorganic semiconductors also serve as electron acceptors and electron transporters in HSC devices.2 For HSC fabrication, the semiconductor sensitization process offers several advantages, including excellent optical properties, which can be tuned by controlling the semiconductor dimensions, a large intrinsic dipole moment, and a high extinction coefficient.14–17 TiO2 is an important semiconductor material with a wide band gap of 3.0–3.2 eV.18–20 Owing to their insufficient surface areas and considerable free space, normal 1D nanostructured photoanodes, including nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, and nanofibers, restrict the PCE.21 The low electron diffusion coefficient of TiO2 particles and the high electron recombination between the grain boundaries limit the performance of solar cells. However, the dendritic TiO2 structure exhibits beneficial properties, including enhanced light scattering, high surface areas, and fast charge transport in a single nanostructured assembly.18 To explore a new electron transport layer for solid-state hybrid solar cells, we selected dendritic TiO2 with a direct electron conduction pathway. Sb2S3, with a band gap of 1.7–1.8 eV,22,23 has good photoelectric properties, a high refractive index, a broad spectral response range, and a suitable valence band position.24–26 Sb2S3 has an ideal band edge position with TiO2, such that photogenerated charge carriers can be easily transported through the junction.27 As a weak polar ferroelectric semiconductor, Sb2S3 is a very promising photovoltaic material. A dendritic TiO2 hybrid grown mixed with Sb2S3 nanorods has yet to be reported. In this study, we have investigated the performances of solid-state HSCs of Sb2S3 nanorod hybrids grown with dendritic TiO2 in which a P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system acts as the hole conductor.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of dendritic TiO2 structure
The dendritic TiO2 structure was prepared using a hydrothermal method.21,28 Firstly, diethylene glycol (DEG) was added to potassium titanium oxalate (PTO) solution at 50 °C. The mixture was then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 6 h. The as-prepared samples were then immersed in a HCl aqueous solution (0.48 M) for 2 h, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried in air at room temperature. Subsequent calcination (500 °C, 1 h) was conducted to remove the organic compounds and increase the TiO2 crystallinity to obtain a dendritic TiO2 structure.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2/Sb2S3 composite films
The Sb2S3 precursor solution was prepared in a glove box. SbCl3 and TU were dissolved in methanol in a 1:1.8 ratio with the SbCl3 concentration maintained at 1 mol L−1. After stirring for 30 min, a yellow transparent solution was obtained. The Sb2S3 precursor solution was spin-coated on dendritic TiO2 at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The as-coated sample was then thermally decomposed at 200 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 min until the sample color changed from transparent to orange. The temperature was then increased to 300 °C and maintained for 30 min until the sample color changed from orange to dark brown.
2.3 Fabrication of organic–inorganic HSCs
P3HT was dissolved in a spin-coating solution of spiro-OMeTAD at 90 °C. The P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system was spin-coated onto the TiO2/Sb2S3 composite films at 3000 rpm to produce close interactions with Sb2S3. Thermal annealing was then performed at 90 °C for 20 min on a hot plate. Finally, the Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The HSCs fabricated with TiO2/P3HT:spiro-OmeTAD, TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT, TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD, and TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD were labelled as HSCTP:S, HSCTSP, HSCTSS, and HSCTSP:S, respectively. A schematic illustration of this experimental process is shown in Fig. 1.

2.4 Photovoltaic measurements and characterization
The morphology of the TiO2 dendritic structure was investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S4800-I, 10.0 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM-2100). The crystal structures of the films were characterized using a Rigaku Dmax 2500 X-ray diffractometer. The optical absorption of the electrodes was measured using a Hitachi UV-Vis NIR spectrophotometer (U-3900). The photocurrent intensity measurements of the electrodes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the solar cells were conducted using a Galvanostat Model 263A photoelectrochemical test system (PerkinElmer, Inc.). Steady-state fluorescence spectra of the electrodes were measured using a F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi Corporation). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were measured using a SOL300-23A solar light simulator (US light Technology Co., Ltd).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a and e) show SEM images of the dendritic TiO2 structure. A uniform and sparse TiO2 dendritic structure was formed vertical to the FTO substrate, which might be beneficial for fast electron transport. Fig. 2(b) shows the magnified SEM image of the dendritic TiO2 structure, which proved that the middle trunk was a nanotube. Fig. 2(e) shows that the thickness of the dendritic TiO2 structure was 5 μm. The space consisting of an array of dendritic TiO2 provided favorable conditions for subsequent growth of Sb2S3 nanorods and HTM coating. Further details of the dendritic TiO2 structure can be seen in Fig. 2(h), which shows a (101) crystal plane with a lattice spacing of 3.55 Å that corresponds with the XRD analysis results. Furthermore, (200), (105), and (204) crystal planes were also found in Fig. 3 (curve a), indicating that the hierarchical TiO2 was anatase.28,29Fig. 2(c and d) show SEM images of TiO2/Sb2S3 composite films at low and high magnifications, with bundles of Sb2S3 nanorods emerging in the adjacent dendritic TiO2. Further details of the Sb2S3 nanorods can be seen in Fig. 2(g), which shows a Sb2S3 nanorod with a diameter of 68 nm. Fig. 2(h) shows the crystal planes of Sb2S3, including (110) and (310) planes with lattice spacings of 7.98 and 3.56 Å, respectively. XRD analysis was conducted to discern the crystallinity of Sb2S3. The XRD pattern of the TiO2/Sb2S3 composite films after calcination is shown in Fig. 3 (curve b), which is indexed to an orthorhombic Sb2S3 structure corresponding to PDF#42-1393. A cross-sectional SEM image of the whole device is shown in Fig. 2(f). The thickness of the Au electrode was 400 nm. HTM with a thickness of 300 nm had infiltrated well into the TiO2/Sb2S3 composite films.

The optimized performance of the HSCs was attributed to three major factors, namely, increased absorption, accelerated charge transfer due to reinforced interfacial contact, and good band alignment at the interface between TiO2, Sb2S3, and HTMs.30 For further clarification, UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra were recorded for the dendritic TiO2 structure (T), TiO2/Sb2S3 (TS), TiO2/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD (TP:S), TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD (TSP:S), TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT (TSP), and TiO2/Sb2S3/spiro-OMeTAD (TSS) electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4. The absorption band of Sb2S3 was 770 nm with a band gap of 1.61 eV. Comparing curves a and b showed that the addition of Sb2S3 further increased the absorption intensity and range. Compared with curve b, curve e shows that P3HT possesses a strong absorption intensity from 450 to 600 nm. Compared with curve b, curve f shows that spiro-OMeTAD possessed a strong absorption intensity from 330 to 400 nm. As shown by curve d, the TSP:S electrode combined the advantages of P3HT and spiro-OMeTAD, possessing a wide light absorption range covering almost the entire visible region. Meanwhile, the thickness of the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD thin film inevitably influenced the visible light adsorption of Sb2S3. The photon must pass through the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD thin film coated on the TS electrode to be absorbed by Sb2S3. Furthermore, the number of photons adsorbed by Sb2S3 was decreased significantly due to resistance caused by the thickness of the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD thin film. Therefore, the adsorption intensity of curve d was lower than that of curve b from 550 to 750 nm. Nevertheless, the total adsorption intensity of TSP:S was markedly promoted, with the maximum adsorption intensity of the TSP:S electrode found to be double that of the TiO2 electrode. The combined action of these substances provided a good foundation for investigating the photoelectric properties.

The illustration shows a partial enlargement of the TS electrode. 
The photocurrent intensities of the TiO2 electrode (T) and TiO2/Sb2S3 electrode (TS) were measured under a positive applied voltage of 0.2 V. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the TiO2 electrode with a narrow photoresponse ranging from 330 to 400 nm exhibited its highest photocurrent at 360 nm. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the TiO2/Sb2S3 electrode with a large photoresponse ranging from 320 to 800 nm possessed its highest photocurrent at 500 nm. Fig. 5(c) shows the current decay curve of the TS electrode at 500 nm. The current decay curve of the TS electrode curve contained an initial sharp spike followed by a wide platform.31 This current was generated due to separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Time-dependent photocurrent decay appeared immediately and continued until the steady state was reached. This steady state was the equilibrium between the maximum photocurrent and the recombination of current carriers.32 Furthermore, the photocurrent intensity of the TiO2/Sb2S3 electrode was stronger than that of the TiO2 electrode. Therefore, the addition of Sb2S3 widened the photoresponse range and enhanced the photocurrent intensity.

Fig. 6 shows steady-state PL emission spectra of electrodes including TSP, TSS, TP:S, and TSP:S. Curve a shows that P3HT has a strong fluorescence intensity at 654 nm and an extremely weak fluorescence intensity at 454 nm. Curve b indicates that spiro-OMeTAD has a strong fluorescence intensity at 453 nm. Curve d shows that the TSP:S electrode exhibits weaker fluorescence at 453 and 664 nm. By comparison with curves a and b, curve d shows that fast charge transfer causes an increase in fluorescence quenching and reduction in emission intensity. Therefore, the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system plays a key role in transferring holes and reducing charge recombination. Compared with curves c and d, a reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed after the introduction of Sb2S3, indicating more effective charge separation and transfer in the TSP:S electrode. A pivotal challenge that limits the choice of donor–acceptor combinations is the ability to simultaneously achieve close contact, guarantee effective charge separation at the interface, and complete phase segregation to promote a percolation path for charge carrier transport to the electrodes.33 Under the concentration gradient, excitons diffused at the interface between Sb2S3 and HTM, where a p–n heterojunction could be formed to enhance the charge separation efficiency.34 Due to the excellent combination strategy, TSP:S HSCs may exhibit better photoelectric properties than TSP, TSS, and TP:S HSCs.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful tool for studying the charge-transfer and transport processes occurring inside devices and for the characterization of cell materials and components.35Fig. 7(a) shows Nyquist plots of HSCTP:S, HSCTSP, HSCTSS, and HSCTSP:S at an applied bias voltage of 0 V. Fig. 7(b) shows Nyquist plots of HSCTSP:S at six different applied bias voltages. The corresponding data are shown in Table 1. According to the biases, the HSCs are denoted HSCTP:S-0, HSCTSP-0, HSCTSS-0, HSCTSP:S-0, HSCTSP:S-0.1, HSCTSP:S-0.2, HSCTSP:S-0.3, HSCTSP:S-0.4, and HSCTSP:S-0.5, respectively. Fig. 7(e) shows the corresponding equivalent circuit of HSCTSP:S. Previous studies have shown that, at a low applied bias, high and middle frequency arcs appear, but are usually overlapped. Furthermore, the low frequency arc is always difficult to observe.36 The illustration in Fig. 7(b) shows a small arc in the high-frequency region. This arc was independent of the applied bias, implying that it did not depend on the Fermi level position and can be attributed to the parallel association of the capacitance (CPE1) of the cells and the charge transfer resistance (R1) at the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD/Au interface. The large arc in the middle frequency region was attributed to the parallel combination of the recombination resistance (R2) of electrons in TiO2 with that of holes in P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD or accepting states in Sb2S3, and the capacitance of electrons in TiO2 (CPE2). The right-hand arc at a low frequency was attributed to charge transfer at the FTO/TiO2 interface, corresponding to the parallel combination of C1–R3. Series resistance (Rs) is the system resistance caused by the contacts and wires.2,37–39 The size of the arc in the middle frequency range decreased as the applied bias voltage increased, as shown in Fig. 7(b), due to the decrease in resistance with increasing electron density.30Fig. 7(c) shows the Bode plots of HSCTSP:S at six different applied bias voltages. According to literature reports, the frequency value of the phase angle peak is approximately equal to the reciprocal of τr:40  As shown in Fig. 7(d) and Table 2, the electron lifetime decreased as the applied bias voltage increased. The high electron lifetime in the HSCTSP:S could be directly related to high electron transport inside the TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD electrode. Compared with HSCTSP and HSCTSS, HSCTSP:S possessed a higher recombination resistance at the same applied bias voltage. Therefore, the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system performed better than pure P3HT or pure spiro-OMeTAD.

Fig. 8(a) shows the J–V curves of different HSCs, while Fig. 8(b) shows a magnified image of HSCTP:S. The photovoltaic characteristic parameters of HSCs are shown in Table 3. HSCTP:S showed the lowest PCE among the HSCs. After spin-coating with Sb2S3, the HSCs achieved good performances with improved photovoltaic characteristic parameters. Furthermore, HSCTSPS, in which spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated onto the TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT composite film, exhibited a PCE of 0.58%. The PCE of HSCTSPS was higher than those of HSCTSP and HSCTSS. However, as spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT used the same solvent, the later spin coating of spiro-OMeTAD resulted in P3HT dissolution. Furthermore, during the spin coating process of spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT were spin coated outside of the composite films. Therefore, the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system was an innovative design. Compared with HSCTSP, HSCTSS, and HSCTSPS, the PCE of HSCTSP:S was up to 1.50%. Fig. 8(c) shows the stability test of the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE) over time for HSCTSP:S stored in air. Initially, the Jsc and PCE values decreased, while FF slightly increased, with increasing storage time. After that, the Jsc and PCE values increased slightly. Fig. 8(c) shows that, after one month, the Voc showed the opposite behavior with increasing time, with a longer time resulting in a lower Voc. As the length of time increased, the Voc showed only subtle changes, essentially remaining stable. As for the increased Jsc, the Voc was observed to decrease because more electron recombination was able to occur as time passed.41 On the sixth day, the best HSCTSP:S, denoted HSCTSP:S-6, achieved a PCE of 1.53%, a Voc of 487 mV, a Jsc of 6.78 mA cm−2, and a FF of 46%. After one month, the HSCTSP:S denoted HSCTSP:S-31 exhibited a PCE of 1.26%, a Voc of 448 mV, a Jsc of 6.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 46%. Previous reports have shown that formula for calculating PCE can be represented as:42  where Psolar is the incident solar radiation. The FF and Jsc changed slightly, while the Voc decreased significantly due to decreased electronic recombination.41 Therefore, the PCE was mainly affected by changes in Voc. Owing to the large change in Voc, the PCE and, therefore, device performance were decreased. The overall PCE showed only a slight decrease (17.6% degradation), indicating the excellent stability of solar cells based on Sb2S3 and P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 8(d) illustrates the principle of charge-transfer processes in HSCTSP:S. The energy level positions of TiO2, Sb2S3, P3HT, and spiro-OMeTAD were obtained from previous studies.11,43 Owing to the p–n heterojunction likely formed at the interface between Sb2S3 and P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD, the photogenerated carriers were effectively separated. Owing to the well-matched energy levels of TiO2, Sb2S3, P3HT, and spiro-OMeTAD, the electrons can be effectively separated and transported. Therefore, there was a marked increase in the PCE of HSCTSP:S.

Fortunately, the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system achieved relatively good results. However, we are constantly pursuing further improvements in PCE, which might be obtained by optimizing the thickness of the electron transport layer, enhancing the interface contact, regulating the P3HT concentration in the blending system, and any other available strategy. Some materials and PCEs of different solar cells reported in recent years are shown in Table 4. The solar cells with considerable PCEs use only one type of polymer. Based on the performance of HSCTSP:S, these reported solar cells might achieve improved PCEs through combination with the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system. Consequently, the strategy of the P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system might indicate a new development in solar cell technology.

4. Conclusion
A P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system was used as a hole conductor in solid-state hybrid solar cells with dendritic TiO2/Sb2S3 nanorods. The interface between Sb2S3 and P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD improved charge separation and transportation, as shown by the decrease in fluorescence intensity. Owing to the well-matched energy levels of these materials, HSCTSP:S, assembled from TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD composite films, showed excellent stability and a best energy conversion efficiency of 1.53%. The P3HT:spiro-OMeTAD blending system strategy is a potential new development in solar cell technology.
