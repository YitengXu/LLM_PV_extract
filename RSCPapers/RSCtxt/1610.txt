    , Accepted 22nd November 2021First published on 22nd November 2021AbstractLight-harvesting, which involves the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy by natural systems such as plants, bacteria, is one of the most universal routine activities in nature. Thus far, various artificial light-harvesting systems (LHSs) have been fabricated toward solar energy utilization through mimicking natural photosynthesis in simplified and altered ways. Macrocycles are supramolecular hosts with unique cavities, in which specific guest molecules can be recognized based on non-covalent interactions. They have been widely employed in constructing LHSs due to their ability to form supramolecular assembly and dynamic molecular activity. In this review, we mainly focus on some representative examples reported by our group and other groups. Specifically, the fabrication of LHSs and their related discussions, such as a high donor/acceptor ratio, driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies and energy transfer mechanisms using different water-soluble macrocycles such as cyclodextrins (CD), pillararenes (PA), calixarenes (CA), cucurbiturils (CB), and other macrocycles will be included. In addition, how the resulting supramolecular self-assembled LHSs could be potentially utilized for photocatalysis, sensing, and imaging is also explained in detail. Challenges and developing trends for photochemical solar energy conversion will also be presented.

Introduction
Harnessing solar energy is of great significance in alleviating the worldwide energy crisis. Considerable efforts have been devoted by scientists to tapping the virtually inexhaustible supply of solar power.1–5 In the biological system, green plants capture sunlight by a pigment–protein complex containing a great number of closely packed chlorophyll molecules.6,7 The light-absorbing chromophores are responsible for funneling and converting the excitation energy to chemical energy. Inspired but not constrained by Nature, a myriad of artificial light-harvesting systems (LHSs) has been constructed to understand the key aspects of the natural photosynthetic process and develop clean and renewable energy.8,9 One commonly employed approach is to mimic the natural light-harvesting process through a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, in which energy transfers from donors to acceptors. In the design of LHSs, three key elements need to be considered: (1) the donors should be closely packed, (2) a high donor to acceptor ratio should be guaranteed, and (3) the excitation energy is transferred with high efficiency.10,11
Previously, most of the artificial LHSs (such as dendrimers,12 polymers,13 organic gels,14 porphyrin arrays,15 and organic–inorganic hybrid16) were fabricated in organic solvents instead of the aqueous media, such as those in nature. As the donor chromophores are usually hydrophobic and exhibit undesired aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect driven by π–π stacking in the aqueous environment. Dendrimers,17 micelles,18 or vesicles19 could be employed for designing LHSs to overcome ACQ problems, as organic chromophores could be trapped in their branched space or lamellar structures. However, due to the loading of limited chromophores, these systems often suffer from a low donor to acceptor ratio, which limit their further applications including photocatalysis, imaging, and cancer theranostic. It remains challenging to construct highly efficient aqueous LHSs. Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) compounds provide an alternative in this regard. The concept of AIE was first proposed by Tang et al.20 Molecules with AIE properties could emit more intense fluorescence in their aggregates in aqueous media, therefore, they are ideal energy-harvesting antennas and frequently utilized in designing LHSs.21,22
On the other side, great progress has been made to design and fabricate highly efficient LHSs based on supramolecular macrocycles in recent years.23–29 The biggest advantages of introducing macrocycles in designing LHSs are to endow the system with multiple non-covalent interactions, thus avoiding tedious synthesis and allowing for supramolecular assembly and dynamic control during the light-harvesting process. Although there has been significant progress in this field, no review on LHSs in an aqueous environment has been reported so far. We have published one minireview on the related topics, but it was not comprehensive and did not focus on the aqueous media.30 Recently, Yang's group summarized supramolecular LHSs with an emphasis on aggregation-induced emission properties.31 In this feature article, we summarize the latest findings in macrocycle-assisted supramolecular assembly for the applications of light-harvesting in aqueous solutions. The discussion will be divided based on different water-soluble hosts-cyclodextrins (CD), pillararenes (PA), calixarenes (CA), cucurbiturils (CB), and other macrocycles. For comparison, Table 1 lists various LHSs, which are constructed by using different hosts, selected donors and acceptors. Their energy transfer (ET) efficiencies and antenna effect (AE) are also highlighted.

Cyclodextrins based LHSs
The toroidal shape of CDs (α-, β-, and γ-CD) has unique features, such as variable cavity size related to the number of glucose units, biodegradability, and biocompatibility.32–35 CD can accommodate various guests through hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions, etc.36,37 Especially, CD provides a rigid environment to the guest moiety, thus greatly inhibiting the molecular rotation of guests and non-radiative decays. In addition, it improves the AIE properties of LHSs by decreasing the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of AIE guests, which facilitates the construction of LHSs in an aqueous medium.38 Also, the fluorescence intensity of the LHSs can be tuned by CDs with varied cavity sizes.
The natural photosynthetic antenna structures of green bacteria are called chlorosome, which contains light-harvesting supramolecular nanotubes.39 Inspired by this property, Zhou et al. prepared a chlorosome-like LHS by using the following three steps.40 Firstly, dandelion-like supramolecular polymer (DSP) was constructed by non-covalent host–guest interactions between β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-endcapped hyperbranched poly(3-ethyl-3-oxetanemethanol) (HBPO)-star-poly(ethyleneglycol)) (PEG) and adamantane-functionalized triple dodecyl linear chains (AD-tC12). Secondly, this DSP self-assembled into bilayer nanotubes (d = 2.1 nm) in water by sequential vesicle aggregation and fusion process (Fig. 1). Finally, the obtained hydrophobic HBPO layer containing nanotubes was used as a template to incorporate hydrophobic 4-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) donor into the β-CD-endcapped hyperbranched multi-arm polymeric cores. Subsequently, a hydrophilic rhodamine B (RB) acceptor was decorated on the surface of the nanotube via the host–guest complex. This LHS ([NBD]/[RB] (1:1.8)) showed 90% ET efficacy by preventing π–π stacking between the NBD donors and offered appropriate distance between donors and acceptors within the Förster radius. Therefore, the inclusion of acceptors on the nanotube surfaces is vital for the successful FRET process in this LHS.

As previously mentioned, AIE molecules with strong AIE properties could avoid ACQ effects. Hence, Liu et al. constructed an LHS with an ultrahigh antenna effect by suitable selection of sulfato-β-CD-oligo(phenylenevinylene) AIE guest complex (SCD-OPV-I) as a donor and Nile red (NiR) dye as an acceptor.41 Initially, the SCD-OPV-I complex was fabricated via electrostatic interactions between anionic SCD and cationic OPV-I. Then multilayer sphere nanoparticles (d = 50 to 150 nm) were produced with remarkably high fluorescence by decreasing the CAC of OPV-I in the presence of SCD (Fig. 2). After that, NiR dye was loaded into the SCD-OPV-I nanoparticles (donor/acceptor = 125:1) to form LHS in an aqueous solution. This SCD-OPV-I/NiR triad system exhibited 72% ET efficiency from SCD-OPV-I to NiR and 32.5 of AE.

An alternative approach was developed by De Yoreo and Chen et al. based on amphiphilic lipid-like peptoid bearing β-CD headgroup (Pep-CD). In this system, hierarchical self-assembly led to the formation of one-dimensional (1D) cylindrical micelles, 2D membranes, and 3D intertwined ribbons in an aqueous solution and on different substrates (mica and SiO2) under varied pH conditions.42 The hydrophobic NBD donors were encapsulated inside the core, thus avoiding π–π stacking from each other (Fig. 3a). After that, RB was accommodated on the empty CD cavity via host–guest interactions. The calculated distance from NBD to the CD surface is around 2.5 nm, which matches with the Förster radius for an efficient FRET process. This co-assembly produced 61% ET efficiency, thus could be observed from decreased donor emission (526 nm) whilst obviously increasing acceptor intensity (580 nm, Fig. 3b). These findings expanded the application of peptoid-based materials due to the high information content of the diverse biomimetic side chains.

In 2019, Xing and Yan et al. developed a salicylaldehyde azine@γ-cyclodextrin (BSA@γ-CD) based [2]pseudorotaxane via host–guest interactions between γ-CD and bolaamphiphilie BSA.43BSA@γ-CD produced a 10-folds emission enhancement (525 nm) via restricted rotation of the N–N bond in BSA and displayed a noticeable AIE effect. This BSA@γ-CD complex was further self-assembled into spherical aggregates (d = 20 nm) in water (Fig. 4). The fabricated aggregates could be used as an energy donor and subsequently, sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) was introduced as an energy acceptor to fabricate LHS with calculated ET efficiency and AE as 41.7% and 84.5, respectively (donor/acceptor = 116:1). Compared to the system without CD, both AE and ET were greatly improved.

Similarly, Wang and Tang et al. prepared a bola-type supra-amphiphile DAdDMA@2β-CD through host–guest interaction between DAdDMA (AIE guest) and 2β-CD (host) and studied their various self-assembled nanostructures from leaf-like lamellar structure to nanofibers via different solvent composition and/or temperature variations.44 The obtained leaf-like core–shell lamellar structure (size = 500 nm) (donor) could mimic LHS (Fig. 5) by the incorporation of RB modified β-CD acceptor. Thus, it could achieve strong green to red fluorescence changes with high ET (94.2%) from DMA to RB in the self-assembled structures. To further prove the mechanism, the lifetime decay of DAdDMA@2β-CD showed 1.436 ns, which was decreased to 0.633 ns after adding RB-β-CD (mole ratio = 35%), corroborating the effective ET process in the self-assembled LHS.

In artificial LHS, monomer emission to excimer emission via π–π stacking or in the aggregated state was an unexplored phenomenon. Consequently, Liu et al. constructed a photocontrolled LHS with aggregation-induced excimer emission (AIEE) by using PYC12@COONa-γ-CD assembly, NiR/Eosin Y (EsY), and photoresponsive diarylethene derivative (DAE).38 Briefly, aggregation of PYC12 (π–π stacking) could be induced by COONa-γ-CDvia electrostatic interactions, and thus resulting in the formation of spherical nanoparticles (d = 100–300 nm) with large red-shifted AIEE (490 nm) as an energy donor (Fig. 6). In addition, NiR or EsY acted as an acceptor, was loaded into the PYC12@COONa-γ-CD donor assembly, thus producing efficient ET efficiency (83% for NiR and 80.2% for EsY) and moderate AE (15.8 for NiR and 25.4 for EsY) with a high donor to acceptor ratio (160:1 (NiR) and 250:1 (EsY)). Notably, multicolor and white-light emissions were observed in gels and solutions, respectively, by fine-tuning the donor to acceptor ratios. The ET efficiency of LHS was photocontrolled by photoresponsive DAE (2nd acceptor) loaded PYC12@COONa-γ-CD/NiR triad assembly (ET = 76%). This photocontrolled excimer emission/quenching process was derived via reversible DAE cyclization/cycloreversion in the presence of light irradiation (UV/visible).

Recently, Xing and Wang et al. fabricated four LHSs (HFD@Cy5, HFD/α-CD@Cy5, HFD/β-CD@Cy5, and HFD/γ-CD@Cy5) from hydroxyflavone derivative (HFD), CD-derivatives, and sulfo-cyanine5 carboxylic acid (Cy5).45 Amphiphilic HFD or HFD/α-CD donors could self-assemble with Cy5 acceptor to give spherical aggregates (about 100 nm) via hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions and π–π stacking. Another two donor assemblies such as HFD/β-CD (1:1) and HFD/γ-CD (2:1), respectively were formed via host–guest interactions and further self-assembled with Cy5, thus also producing similar spherical aggregates with varied sizes (from 60 to 300 nm) (Fig. 7). ET and AE for these four LHSs (donor/acceptor ratio = 58:1) were shown in the order of HFD/β-CD (54.6%, 16.6) > HFD (34.2%, 14.6) ≈ HFD/α-CD (34.8%, 15.1) > HFD/γ-CD (24.5%, 12.8), due to the fact that tightly assembled smaller aggregates were beneficial for high ET process than that of larger aggregates.

Pillar[n]arenes based LHSs
Pillararenes, which were first introduced in 2008 by the Ogoshi group, are developed into a new class of versatile supramolecular hosts due to their easy synthesis and functionalization.46,47 Among their many applications,48–52 LHSs represent one of the hottest research topics. In 2016, Diao et al. reported a stimulus-responsive light-harvesting complex based on the water-soluble pillar[5[arene (WP5)-induced co-assembly of β-carotene (β-CAR) and chlorophyll (Chl-b).53 First, accommodation of β-CAR into the cavity of WP5 induced the construction of a substructure in water via self-assembly. Chl-b was then introduced as a co-assembly factor to construct a light-harvesting complex (LHC) (Fig. 8). However, no ET and AE were reported. This synthesized suprastructure exhibits some photocatalytic activity when exposed to light, which can be exploited for photoreduction of nitrophenol and solar conversion in living organisms.

Recently, Liu et al. developed an efficient artificial light-harvesting system with sequential energy transfer based on supramolecular assembly (Fig. 9).54 Pyridinium-modified tetraphenylethene (Py-TPE) derivative was encapsulated within WP5, causing aggregation-induced blue emission due to supramolecular nanoparticle formation (Py-TPE/WP5). Then sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) could be loaded into the hydrophobic layer of the Py-TPE/WP5 supramolecular assembly acting as the first energy acceptor, and achieve a highly efficient energy transfer in an aqueous solution at a donor/acceptor ratio of 150:1. Subsequently, the second energy transfer process occurred from Py-TPE/WP5/SR101 to aluminum phthalocyanine (AlPcS4) accompanied by fluorescence changes from blue to near-infrared (NIR) emission, and the Stokes shift reached 340 nm.
 Fig. 9  Construction of a light-harvesting system with sequential energy transfer in the aqueous solution. 
In 2018, our group reported two light-harvesting systems in aqueous media, which were fabricated by supramolecular self-assembly based on water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6), azine derivative of salicylaldehyde (G), and two kinds of fluorescent dyes, NiR or EsY (Fig. 10).55 Upon adding WP6 to the aqueous solution of G, a stable WP6-G inclusion complex was formed and it further self-assembled into spherical nanoparticles, which remarkably enhanced the AIE effect of G. Fluorescent dye NiR or EsY acting as the acceptor was successfully loaded into the hydrophobic interior of WP6-G assemblies, efficient FRET process occurred from WP6-G assemblies to NiR or EsY with brilliant antenna effects (25.4 for WP6-G-NiR while 28.0 for WP6-G-EsY) at high donor/acceptor ratio (150:1 for WP6-G-NiR and 200:1 for WP6-G-EsY).
 Fig. 10  Representation of the self-assembly of pillar[6]arene-based aqueous light-harvesting systems. Reproduced from ref. 55 with permission from John Wiley &Sons. 
Next, we further explored a water-soluble artificial light-harvesting system with a sequential energy transfer process, which was fabricated through supramolecular self-assembly of water-soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), bola-type tetraphenylethlene-modified dialkylammonium derivatives (TPEDA), and fluorescent dyes, NiR and EsY (Fig. 11).56 First, a stable WP5-TPEDA complex was formed on the basis of host–guest interactions, and it further self-assembled into supramolecular nanoparticles. Strong fluorescence was observed due to lowered critical aggregation concentration and strengthened the AIE effect of TPEDA. Then, EsY was entrapped into the hydrophobic core of the formed WP5-TPEDA nanoparticles. The first step energy transfer could take place from WP5-TPEDA nanoparticles to EsY with an ET efficiency of 74.39% and AE of 11.5 at the molar ratio of donor/acceptor = 200:1.

Furthermore, the second step energy-transfer process could be realized by the simultaneous encapsulation of NiR with an ET efficiency of 56.28% and AE of 3.5 at the molar ratio of donor/acceptor I/acceptor II = 200:1:1. The harvested energy of the system with a two-step energy transfer process could be further employed for dehalogenation of α-bromoacetophenone in water with an excellent yield of up to 96% compared with the control group using organic dyes alone. Similar results were recently reported by us using bola-type bis(4-phenyl)acrylonitrile (60.9% and 89.4% FRET efficiency for the two-step transfer)57 and salicylaldehyde-azine derivatives (AE = 32.5).58 These LHSs demonstrated great potentials in mimicking the natural photosynthesis system.
Calix[n[arenes based LHSs
Amphiphilic calixarenes can form self-assembly structures, which could control the spatial distribution of chromophores at distinct sites (cavity for encapsulation and hydrophobic environment for entrapment).59–63 Based on the above fact, Guo et al. developed the de novo design of LHS from amphiphilic calix[5]arene (AmC5A), 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (1,8-ANS) and 4,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBT).64 Initially, AmC5A was aggregated to form a large-sized vesicular structure (d = 79 nm, wall thickness = 5.1 nm) in water. The 1,8-ANS donor and DBT acceptor were encapsulated by AmC5Avia the host–guest complexation and bilayer entrapment, respectively (Fig. 12). The resulting LHS showed high ET efficiency (85% at 10:1 (D:A) ratio) and AE (4.5 at 50:1 (D:A) ratio). These results were achieved due to the formation of ordered amphiphilic assemblies and stable aggregation in the LHS. To improve ET efficiency, LHS was transferred from water to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer to achieve more compact aggregation via closer packing of ionic heads. Based on the above approach, ET efficiency and AE of AmC5A@1,8-ANS/DBT assembly was increased to be 97% and 6.6, respectively. Notably, when the donor-to-acceptor ratio was increased to 25:1, a pure white-light emission (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) = 0.31, 0.34) with broad-spectrum could be observed in the buffer than in the water. Moreover, AmC5A@1,8-ANS/DBT assembly-derived multicolor fluorescent inks were fabricated for encryption coding by tuning their molar ratios.

Recently, NIR emissive fluorescent probes for targeted imaging in live cells, especially in the Golgi apparatus have played a vital role due to their deep tissue penetration, slight photo-damage, and less intrusion with autofluorescence. Keeping these considerations in mind, Li and Yang et al. developed a NIR emissive supramolecular LHS via the co-assembly of dodecyl-modified sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD), naphthyl-1,8-diphenyl pyridinium derivative (NPS), and Nile blue (NiB) in aqueous and PBS buffer media.65 In detail, the NPS donor was co-assembled with SC4ADvia electrostatic and amphiphilic interactions in a suitable mixing ratio. This supramolecular co-assembly could further form AIE (550 nm) nanoparticles (d = 120 nm) and serve as a basic platform for the construction of LHS (Fig. 13). In addition, NiB acceptor was loaded into the NPS-SC4AD assembly, thus producing strong NIR emissive (675 nm) nanoparticles based on the FRET process in water due to the non-inclusion interactions between NPS and SC4AD, and V-shaped NPS to avoid the π–π stacking with NiB. In this LHS, moderate AE (32.9) and ET (50.4%) was obtained at a 333:1 molar ratio of NPS/NiB in an aqueous solution, which was further improved to 33.1 (AE) and 60.8% (ET) in PBS buffer at a molar ratio of 250:1 (NPS/NiB). These results were compared with the control experiment, in which sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDOBS) was used instead of SC4AD to construct NPS-SDOBS-NiB assemblies. The fabricated control LHS showed less efficiency than that of the NPS-SC4AD-NiB system. Moreover, NPS-SC4AD-NiB based supramolecular LHS with NIR emission was used for target imaging in Golgi apparatus with the aid of Golgi staining reagent (NBD C6-ceramide) in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cells). To prove the mechanism, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) biomarker was selected to interact with NPS-SC4AD-NiB assemblies, thus could increase the NiB emission followed by decreasing the donor emission. These results corroborated that NPS-SC4AD-NiB based NIR emissive LHS could provide vital evidence for precise imaging in the Golgi apparatus.

Later, Liu et al. demonstrated a type of LHS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by the utilization of SC4A-C6, tetraphenylehtylene derivative (TPE-4Py), and coumarin-based cyanine (SP), and this assembly was further applied for sulfite sensing in living cells.66 Briefly, SC4A-C6 and TPE-4Py were involved in the self-assembly process via electrostatic interactions to form ordered aggregates (d = 10 nm) with the AIE effect. This SC4A-C6/TPE-4Py donor assembly was further loaded with the SP acceptor to afford the LHS with color changing from light yellow to bright orange-red fluorescence, indicating an efficient FRET process (Fig. 14). This SC4A-C6/TPE-4Py/SP triad system showed good ET (75.2%) and AE (28.1) properties at a 56:1 molar ratio of donor/acceptor. Moreover, the fabricated LHS containing SP molecule could be used for naked-eye detection of HSO3− at a nanomolar concentration (21 nM) via Michael's addition reaction between SP and HSO3−, thus blocking the energy transfer from SC4A-C6/TPE-4Py to SP. The sensing mechanism was further verified by cell imaging studies, i.e., red fluorescence vanished followed by the recovery of yellow fluorescence.

Cucurbiturils based LHSs
Cucurbiturils (CB[n]) are pumpkin-shaped hosts linked by glycoluril subunits with methylene bridges. The carbonyl-lined portals and their hydrophobic cavity render CB[n]s excellent binding with a variety of guest species, which led to the discovery of various interesting applications.67–71 Park et al. demonstrated a novel eco-friendly light-harvesting supramolecular block copolymers in water by CB[8] host and different cyanostilbene guests (named as B, G, Y, and R) emitting blue, green, yellow, and red fluorescence, respectively (Fig. 15).72 First, supramolecular homopolymers (SHPs) were fabricated through complexation between CB[8] and single color guest emitter, followed by light-harvesting supramolecular block copolymers generated by mixing blue (donor) and red-emitting (acceptor) SHPs according to the dynamic host–guest exchange interaction. Owing to the donor/acceptor proximity and parallel orientation of their transition dipoles secured in the assembled structure, this system is quite stable in water and shows great light-harvesting performance with enhanced exciton mobility and high quantum yield.

Recently, Zhang and Liu's group constructed a gel state LHS, which was formed by host–guest interactions between CB[8] and a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) containing polymer (Fig. 16).73 The polymer was synthesized by copolymerization of acrylamide (AM), 4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl) phenyl acrylate (vTPE), and 1-benzyl-3-vinylimidazolium guest. Due to the AIE effect of TPE, it showed high fluorescence emission in water, then an AIE supramolecular hydrogel was fabricated after adding the CB[8] host. Upon the addition of the EsY acceptor, energy transfer from AIE hydrogel to EsY was observed with a fluorescence intensity diminishing at 475 nm and an emission increasing at 518 nm. Furthermore, the rheological properties of the hydrogel indicated that the new light-harvesting system has potentials in various applications such as photocatalysis, light-emitting devices, and optical sensors. Similar results using CBs were previously reported by Xing et al. using TPE containing supramolecular hyperbranched polymers74 and amphiphilic anthracene-based assembled nanostructures75 in the aqueous solution.

LHSs constructed by other macrocycles
Cyclophane-type macrocycles play a significant role in the construction of supramolecular materials/superstructures and could be utilized for the development of photofunctional systems.76–80 Taking this into account, Cao et al. synthesized a TPE-based tetracationic dicyclophane by a one-step SN2 reaction and studied the AIE (ϕ = 97.7%, λem = 580 nm) effect of their self-assembled nanospheres.81 These well-ordered crystalline nanospheres displayed crossed lattice fringes (distance = 3.32 Å) with hexagonal order from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. After that, NiR acceptor was dispersed into the nanospheres to form ordered co-assembly (Fig. 17), which produced an efficient FRET process with 77.5% of ET and 14.3 of AE at a donor/acceptor ratio of 1:4.5.

Cyclic peptides have strong ability to form multiple hydrogen bonds between the circular rings of peptide units, which is the main driving force for the formation of nanotubular self-assemblies with high stability. In addition, hydrophilic polymers bearing cyclic peptide groups could increase the water solubility, and avoid lateral aggregation. Inspired by those aspects, Perrier et al. constructed an efficient LHS with a two-step sequential FRET mechanism based on cyclic peptide-polymeric conjugates (CYR-CP-PEG, NTI-CP-PEG, Cy3-CP-PEG) self-assembled nanotubes (d = 8 nm).82 As shown in Fig. 18, cyclic peptide-polymer conjugates containing three fluorophores (pyrene, naphthalene monoimide, and cyanine 3), were synthesized, respectively. Initially, CYR-CP-PEG and NTI-CP-PEG could assemble into supramolecular nanotubes through slipped stacking of fluorophores, and such a system produced the first step of the FRET process (ET = 88.1%, AE = 10.4 at 100:8 (CYR-CP-PEG:NTI-CP-PEG) ratio). After that, adding Cy3-CP-PEG into the above-coassembled nanotubes, a two-step sequential FRET process (1st ET from pyrene to naphthalene and 2nd ET from naphthalene to cyanine) was successfully achieved (ET = 95%, 100:8:8 (CYR-CP-PEG:NTI-CP-PEG:Cy3-CP-PEG) ratio with a high quantum yield (about 30%). Furthermore, multicolor emission (blue to orange) was achieved by tuning the ratios of three conjugates. Notably, a pure white-light emission (CIE = 0.321, 0.336) was observed at a 100:1:2 ratio of CYR-CP-PEG:NTI-CP-PEG:3:Cy3-CP-PEG (1st and 2nd ET = 37% and 67.9%). Overall, this nanotubular system showed good performance at low concentration (<1 μM) and high stability even at high temperatures (80 °C).

Conclusions
This feature article has summarized the recent advances in the preparation of artificial light-harvesting systems in aqueous solutions. Macrocycles play a prominent role in forming these supramolecular systems based on the non-covalent assembly process. Although great progress has been made over the past few years, there are still challenges remaining in this field, the reported light-harvesting capacity and energy transfer efficiency remain a fraction of that of the natural counterparts. The following points need to be deliberated for the development of excellent artificial LHSs in the future. (1) For potential applications, the high stability of artificial LHSs is very important. Therefore, the fruitful combination of a covalent system followed by non-covalent self-assembly could be a suitable substitute to overcome this issue. (2) Until now, artificial LHSs were constructed by various non-covalent interactions such as host–guest complexation, hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, and hydrophobic interactions. So far, π–π interaction-based LHSs have rarely been explored and thus could provide a broad spectral emission and avoid the ACQ effect. For instance, Wang et al.83 constructed a ternary co-assembled LHS with triplet energy transfer in an aqueous medium by the compartmentalization approach. (3) Multi-layered artificial LHSs and their directional excitation energy transport-related investigation are not well-explored to date. To understand the excitonic properties of a hierarchically layered supramolecular LHS, various experimental and extensive theoretical models can be paired with ultrafast coherent 2D spectroscopy (exciton–exciton-interaction two-dimensional (EEI2D) spectroscopy). These results may provide a new avenue for the fundamental understanding of the excitonic properties of supramolecular assemblies, thus aiding in the robust design of next-generation optoelectronic devices.
During a short period, artificial LHSs have been stepping into a wide range of potential applications, including optical sensors, solar cells, photocatalysis, optoelectronic devices, theranostics, and bioimaging. Therefore, much cutting-edge research will be expected in the next decade by using these materials in supramolecular and materials chemistry fields.
