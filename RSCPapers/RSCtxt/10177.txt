    , Accepted 29th July 2021First published on 29th July 2021AbstractThe cyano-group (–CN) is an electron-withdrawing group, which has been widely used to construct high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Benefiting from these FREAs, the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently exceeded 18%. However, malononitrile is a highly toxic substance used to introduce –CN during the synthesis of these FREAs. Therefore, the synthesis processes of most high-performance FREAs are typically harmful to the environment. Our previous work demonstrated that the electron-withdrawing ability of –CN is necessary for FREAs. Thus, the use of other electron-withdrawing groups instead of –CN to design environmentally friendly FREAs is feasible. We utilized seven electron-withdrawing groups, namely, –CNH, –NO, –CHO, –CO–CH3, –CO–OH, –CO–Cl, and –CO–Br, to replace –CN in the commonly used acceptor Y6 to design new FREAs (Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr). Multi-scale theoretical calculation methods were used to investigate the photoelectronic properties of these new FREAs, including energy level, absorption spectrum, exciton binding energy, and electron mobility. The results showed that Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3 and Y6-COOH are unsuitable for use as acceptor materials because of their high frontier molecular orbital energy level and weak electron affinity. The strong absorption intensity and weak exciton binding energy of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr indicated that they can absorb more solar energy than Y6 and excitons are easier to separate into free charges. The electron mobility of Y6-CHO (3.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found to be approximately 28 times that of Y6-COCl (1.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and Y6-COBr (1.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The possible synthetic routes to Y6-CHO are environmentally friendly. Therefore, –CHO is the most suitable electron-withdrawing group for constructing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs. This work can provide a new molecular design perspective in experimental science for developing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable research attention in the past few decades due to their advantages of light weight, flexibility, solution processability and low cost.1–4 The bulk-heterojunction OSC is a widely used device structure that typically consists of a photoactive layer of electron donors and acceptors sandwiched between two electrodes. The photoelectronic properties of donors and acceptors play an important role in improving the performance of OSCs. A few years ago, the development of donors had been intensively investigated.5,6 During that time, fullerenes and their derivatives were used as acceptors.2 As fullerenes and their derivatives exhibit narrow and weak absorption of sunlight and poor adjustability of energy levels, the power conversion efficiency of fullerene-based OSCs is limited to 12%.7–10
Compared with fullerenes and their derivatives, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit variable energy levels, strong absorption of sunlight, and flexible synthetic methods.11–14 These NFAs, especially fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The development of FREAs has rapidly increased the power conversion efficiency of OSCs from 6% to 18%.15–19 FREAs typically exhibit a classic acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure, that consists of an electron-rich core (D) with two electron-deficient terminal groups (A). 1,1-Dicyanomethylene-3-indanone and its derivatives (methylated or fluorinated) are widely used electron-deficient terminal groups.14,20,21 These terminal groups generally contain two cyano-groups (–CN), and a highly toxic substance called malononitrile must be used during the synthesis process. The toxicity of malononitrile is higher than that of HCN, which is one of the most hazardous species of cyanide compounds, as malononitrile could be completely converted to HCN in the mammalian tissue metabolism.22,23 Therefore, the environmentally harmful synthesis process of currently used high-performance FREAs limits their commercial applications. Our previous work demonstrated that the electron-withdrawing ability of –CN determines the ability of FREAs to accept electrons.24 Therefore, the use of other electron-withdrawing groups instead of –CN is feasible in the construction of environmentally friendly FREAs.
In this work, we used seven electron-withdrawing groups, namely, –CNH, –NO, –CHO, –CO–CH3, –CO–OH, –CO–Cl, and –CO–Br, to replace –CN in the commonly used acceptor Y621 for the design of new FREAs (Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr). Quantum chemical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations were applied to investigate the photoelectronic properties of new FREAs, including energy level, electron affinity, predicted open circuit voltage, absorption spectrum, exciton binding energy, and electron mobility. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy and electron affinity indicate the ability of materials to accept electrons. Both indicators demonstrated that Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3, and Y6-COOH are unsuitable as acceptor materials. The spectral analysis showed that Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr exhibit stronger absorption intensity and weaker exciton binding energy than Y6, thereby indicating that they can absorb more solar energy than Y6 and excitons are easier to separate into free charges. Meanwhile, the electron mobility of Y6-CHO was found to be about 28 times that of Y6-COCl and Y6-COBr. The comprehensive analysis of photoelectric properties showed that –CHO is a suitable electron-withdrawing group for constructing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs. This result can provide a new molecular design perspective for experimental science to develop high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs.
Computational method
All quantum chemical calculations were carried out using the ORCA Revision 4.1.0 program.25 Geometry optimization of the ground, anion and cation states of all materials investigated in this work was carried out at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level with geometrical counterpoise correction to remove artificial overbinding effects from the basis set superposition error.26 Frontier molecular orbital energy levels, adiabatic electron affinity (AEA), adiabatic ionization energy (AIP), and electron reorganization energies (λ−) were calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level. Since the PBE0 hybrid functional can estimate the reasonable absorption spectrum of most organic materials using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT),27 we used the PBE0/def2-SVPD calculation level to investigate the absorption spectra and excited states of all materials in this work. In order to account for the major parts of dispersion force contribution to the energy, the atom-pairwise dispersion correction (D3ZERO)28 was used during this calculation. To match the actual situation of the absorption spectrum measured in the experiment, the conductor-like polarizable continuum model29 was used to simulate the effect of chloroform in the TD-DFT calculations. During these quantum chemical calculations, the alkyl chains were omitted to reduce the calculation cost.
MD simulations were used to construct amorphous thin films, which are formed through the mixture of electron donor material (PBDB-TF)30 and electron acceptor material (Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, or Y6-COBr) to construct a bulk-heterojunction model in this work. In the MD processing, alkyl chains were introduced into the donor and acceptor materials due to their influence on molecular packing. MD simulations were carried out using the GROMACS program with general amber force field (GAFF).31 The restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) atomic charge calculated using the Multiwfn 3.7 package32 was used for the GAFF. The MD simulation process was as follows: (1) PBDB-TF (193) and electron acceptor (400) molecules (6-CHO, Y6-COCl, or Y6-COBr) were randomly placed in a large box (20 nm × 20 nm × 20 nm) to generate the initial models. (2) The initial models were subjected to 50000 steps of steep descent to remove undesired forces and structural distortion. (3) 420 K and 100 bar conditions were simulated at 200 ps to fill the empty space with molecules in the NPT ensemble quickly. (4) Then, models in the NPT ensemble were annealed between 420 and 300 K six times in 1.2 ns. (5) Finally, the models were maintained at a temperature of 300 K for 20 ns to achieve completely converged results. Hence, we obtained amorphous bulk-heterojunction films, which were used as the initial structure for MC calculations to estimate electron mobility.
The electron mobility of amorphous bulk-heterojunction thin films was estimated through a multiscale simulation process based on quantum chemical calculations, MD simulations, and MC calculations. The MC calculations were carried out as described in our previous work.33–35 The adjacent molecular pairs (the shortest interatomic distance is less than 0.5 nm) were constructed for each molecule under periodic conditions based on the model of amorphous films obtained from the MD simulations. The center-of-mass (COM) of each molecule was utilized as the hopping point in the MC simulations. During the hopping process, we first randomly selected one molecule (i) as the initial charge center. Then, the charge hops between the center molecule i and its adjacent molecule (j) with a probability of Pij = kij/Σkij, where kij is defined as the electron hopping rate between the molecules i and j. The hopping time was defined as 1/kij, and the hopping distance was taken to be the molecular COM(i)–COM(j) distance. Finally, we used the hopping coordinate and time to build the relationship between the square diffusion displacement and the diffusion time to estimate the charge diffusion coefficient. The electron transfer integral between adjacent molecules was calculated using the B3LYP/3-21G method in this work.
Results and discussion
A highly toxic substance called malononitrile that contains –CN groups must be used during the synthesis process of high-performance FREAs. It has been well-known that the electron-withdrawing –CN groups determine the electron-accepting capabilities of the FREAs that contain the groups.24 Therefore, electron withdrawing groups, –CNH, –NO, –CHO, –CO–CH3, –CO–OH, –CO–Cl, and –CO–Br, were used to replace the –CN groups in Y6 to construct various FREAs (Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr). The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1.

Electronic properties
Energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) for the donor or acceptor dominate the exciton separation, charge transportation and open circuit voltage of OSCs.14 Thus, we investigated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of newly designed FREAs. A comparison of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these newly designed FREAs and the widely used electron acceptor Y6 is shown in Fig. 2. LUMO energy levels of Y6-CNH (−3.48 eV), Y6-COCH3 (−3.27 eV), and Y6-COOH (−3.36 eV) are significantly higher than that of Y6 (−3.88 eV). AEA of Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3, and Y6-COOH are 2.78, 2.54, and 2.73 eV, respectively. These are significantly smaller than that of Y6 (3.12 eV), which may be due to the fact that –CH3 and –OH are pi-donors, and adding H to –CN to make –CNH is actually a reduction process. All these lead to poorer electron accepting capability. These results indicated that Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3, and Y6-COOH exhibit weak electron accepting ability and can’t be used as electron acceptor materials. Compared with these materials, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr exhibited similar LUMO energy levels to Y6, with a difference of less than 0.1 eV, and larger AEA than that of Y6, as shown in Table 1. Hence, these materials are suitable for use as electron acceptor materials. The lowest LUMO energy levels (−4.05 eV) and the largest AEA (3.36 eV) of Y6-NO demonstrated the strongest electron accepting ability in these materials. The spatial distribution of LUMOs for Y6, Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr is illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). LUMOs are delocalized from the core to end groups of all FREAs. Notably, the high degree of delocalization of LUMOs can increase the intermolecular LUMO–LUMO overlap for adequate electron transport. Thus, the overlap of intermolecular LUMOs remains unaffected when –CNH, –NO, –CHO, –CO–CH3, –CO–OH, –CO–Cl, or –CO–Br is used instead of –CN. To deeply investigate the electronic properties of these newly designed FREAs, the molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) was evaluated as shown in Fig. 3. Positive ESP values are distributed on most of the backbone surfaces of Y6, Y6-COCl, Y6-COBr, Y6-CHO, Y6-NO, and Y6-CNH, which indicates that they will show the ability to accept electrons. The maximum ESP values distributed along the backbone of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, Y6-COBr, and Y6-NO are 6.75–13.19 kcal mol−1, 8.21–14.23 kcal mol−1, 9.35–15.26 kcal mol−1, and 5.59–12.75 kcal mol−1, respectively. They are similar to that of Y6 (8.30–14.47 kcal mol−1), indicating that Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, Y6-COBr, and Y6-NO exhibit similar electron-accepting ability. λ− of Y6 was calculated to be 0.14 eV, which is smaller than that of the designed new FREAs. This result will affect the electron mobility of these materials combined with intermolecular transmission channels. All electronic properties are summarized in Table 1.

Open circuit voltage
Open circuit voltage (VOC) is an important parameter that influences the power conversion efficiency of OSCs and can be estimated through the equation reported by Scharber et al.36 in 2006 as follows: (1)where e is the electron charge, and EDonor(HOMO) and EAcceptor(LUMO) are the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor, respectively. We used PBDB-TF as the donor in this study to estimate VOC of OSCs on the basis of Y6 and newly designed FREAs. First, we calculated the spatial distribution and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO for one, two, and three repeating units of PBDB-TF, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The spatial distribution of HOMO and LUMO grows along the backbone when the repeating unit increases from one to two. Changes in the spatial distribution of HOMO and LUMO are unclear when the repeating unit increases from two to three. This finding indicated that the spatial distribution of HOMO and LUMO will only delocalize on two repeating units although the number of repeating units continues to increase. HOMO and LUMO energy levels gradually increase and decrease, respectively, with the increase of repeating units from one to three. Although the energy level changes when the repeating unit increases, the trend of change gradually decreases. We fit the data of HOMO and LUMO energy levels for one, two, and three repeating units with an inversely proportional function to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymer PBDB-TF, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The results showed that HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymer PBDB-TF are −5.04 and −3.05 eV, respectively.
Based on eqn (1), we predicted VOC of OSCs on the basis of PBDB-TF:FREAs (Y6, Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr), as shown in Table 2. The predicted VOC of PBDB-TF:Y6 is 0.86 eV, which is consistent with the experimental result (0.84 eV).30 This finding demonstrated the accuracy of this calculation method. When combined with PBDB-TF as the donor material, although Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3, and Y6-COOH show a large VOC (>1.0 eV), they have small electron affinity. Thus, these materials are still unsuitable as high-performance electron acceptor materials. Compared with Y6, Y6-NO exhibits a larger electron affinity, but it shows significantly lower VOC (0.69 eV), so it is also unsuitable as a high-performance electron acceptor material. The predicted VOC of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are 0.90, 0.92, and 0.85 eV, respectively, which are similar or slightly larger than that of Y6. Based on the results of electronic properties and VOC, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are appropriate high-performance FREAs.

Electronic absorption spectra
Sufficient absorption capacity in the visible-NIR spectrum is an essential property of high-performance FREAs. Therefore, we utilized TD-DFT to investigate the electronic absorption spectra of Y6 and the newly designed FREAs (Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr). We compared the calculated absorption spectrum and the experimental result of Y6 in solution21 to verify the accuracy of the calculation method used here, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The consistency between the shape and absorption peak of calculated results and the experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of PBE0/def2-SVPD. Estimated absorption spectra shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†) were generated using Multiwfn32 in combination with the Gaussian broadening function and a fixed full width at half maximum (0.2 eV). Compared with the absorption peaks of Y6, the absorption peaks of Y6-CNH, Y6-COCH3 and Y6-COOH exhibit a blue shift, while those of Y6-COCl, Y6-COBr, Y6-CHO, and Y6-NO gradually shift to red. We calculated the integrated intensity of the absorption spectra to identify the absorption intensity further, as shown in Fig. S5b (ESI†). Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr clearly exhibit stronger integrated absorption intensity than Y6. VOC of Y6-NO indicates its unsuitability as a high-performance FREA. Therefore, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are appropriate for use as high-performance FREAs, considering their electronic properties, VOC, or absorption strength.
To further investigate the electronic absorption spectra of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr in comparison with that of Y6, the analysis of oscillator strength (f), wavelength (λ), and electrons and holes of the typical electronic excited state was carried out as shown in Fig. 4. The holes and electrons generated during the process of single-electron excitation were defined by Tian Lu.37 As described in Fig. 4a, the absorption spectrum of Y6 was mainly dominated by the S0 → S1 transition (700 nm) with an f of 2.08. Fig. 4b-d show that the absorption spectra of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr exhibit a similar phenomenon to that of Y6 and are all dominated by the S0 → S1 transition, with absorption peaks at 742, 719, and 735 nm and an f of 1.80, 2.00, and 1.99, respectively. The electron–hole analysis for the S0 → S1 excitation of Y6, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr is illustrated in Fig. 4. Electrons transition from the central group to the terminal group during the S0 → S1 excitation of all these materials. The molecular orbital (MO) contribution of these excited states is mainly dominated by the transition from HOMO to LUMO (≥95%). The detailed results are summarized in Table 3.

To quantitatively characterize the electron and hole distributions of the S0 → S1 excitation for Y6, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl and Y6-COBr, the total magnitude of charge transfer length (D), overlapping extent of electrons and holes (Sr), and hole–electron Coulomb attraction (EC) were obtained using Multiwfn. The significantly larger D of Y6-CHO (1.50 Å), Y6-COCl (1.53 Å) and Y6-COBr (1.54 Å) than that of Y6 (1.38 Å) indicated their larger charge transfer length for S0 → S1 excitation. This finding is consistent with the results of Sr, which is 0.63 for Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr and 0.65 for Y6. Meanwhile, the Coulomb attraction between the hole and the electron produced during the S0 → S1 excitation is calculated as follows: (2)where ρhole(r1) and ρelectron(r2) represent the hole and electron density at r1 and r2, respectively. The calculated EC values are 1.93, 1.98, and 1.97 eV for Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr, respectively, which are smaller than that of Y6 (2.55 eV). This finding indicated that excitons are easily separated into free charges in these newly designed materials. We calculated the exciton binding energy (Eb) for verification. Eb is defined as the difference between the fundamental and optical gaps38 and is calculated as follows: Eb = Eg − Eopt,(3)where Eg is the fundamental gap, which can be calculated based on the difference between ionization potential and electron affinity, and Eopt is the optical gap, defined as the vertical excitation energy from the ground state to the first dipole-allowed excited state. The calculated results are listed in Table 3. Eb values of Y6-CHO (1.63 eV), Y6-COCl (1.53 eV), and Y6-COBr (1.49 eV) are smaller than that of Y6 (1.72 eV). This finding is consistent with the results of EC. Hence, the easy separation of excitons into free charges in Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr can facilitate the separation of excitons to generate additional free charges. Therefore, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are the most appropriate high-performance FREAs when the electron affinity, VOC, absorption intensity, and Eb are considered.
Electron mobility
Once the excitons are separated into free charges, the mobility of holes and electrons will play a crucial role in the performance of OSCs. High electron mobility is an essential requirement for high-performance FREAs. We utilized a multiscale simulation method developed in our earlier studies33–35 to identify the electron mobility of possible high-performance FREAs (Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr).
The electron diffusion process was simulated using the MC method to obtain the electron-diffusion coefficient. The electron-diffusion coefficient was determined by the slope of the squared diffusion displacement and diffusion time. The squared diffusion displacement of five typical simulations and averages of 2000 simulations versus simulation times for Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are shown in Fig. 5. The squared diffusion displacement of the average value of 2000 simulations shows a satisfactory linear relationship with diffusion time and was used to estimate the electron-diffusion coefficient. Based on the Einstein formula, the electron mobility of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr was estimated to be 3.53 × 10−4, 1.24 × 10−5, and 1.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, Y6-CHO is the best candidate for developing high-performance FREAs because it exhibited the highest electron mobility among these materials.
The proportion of molecules of the largest network is defined as the proportion of molecules which can hop to adjacent molecules with an electronic transfer integral larger than the threshold electronic transfer integral VT. It is depicted in Fig. 6a to identify the key factors affecting the electron mobility of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr. The results showed that the proportion of the largest network of Y6-COCl and Y6-COBr is larger than that of Y6-CHO in any range of VT, thereby indicating that the electron mobility of Y6-COCl and Y6-COBr should be larger than that of Y6. This finding is contradictory to the result of the electron mobility obtained. Therefore, the key factor that affects the electron mobility of Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr is not the electronic transfer integral. In addition to the electronic transfer integral, the reorganization energy is another key factor that can affect the electron mobility, as described by the Marcus formula as follows: (4)where kij is the charge hopping rate, ħ is reduced Planck's constant, Vij is the transfer integral between ith and jth molecules, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and is set to 300 K in this work, λ denotes the reorganization energy, and ΔGij is the relevant change of total Gibbs free energy. In the self-exchange reaction, ΔGij equals zero.39 The charge hopping rate is evidently inversely proportional to the reorganization energy. The electron reorganization energies of Y6-COCl and Y6-COBr are 0.51 and 0.56 eV, respectively, which are significantly larger than that of Y6-CHO (0.23 eV). Combined with the results of our previous study,24 we found that the electron mobility is mainly dominated by the electronic transfer integral when λ− is smaller than 0.3 eV; otherwise, the electron mobility is determined by λ−. As shown in Fig. 6b, the root mean square error (RMSD) values between the optimized geometry of ground and anion states for Y6-CHO, Y6-CHOCl, and Y6-COBr are 0.300, 0.521, and 0.544, respectively. λ− continues to increase as the RMSD between ground and anion states increases. This indicates that when the molecule gains an electron, a larger structural change will consume larger energy, and thus cause an increase of λ−. This demonstrates the importance of maintaining the structure of molecules after gaining electrons to reduce λ− effectively and improve the electron mobility.

Possible synthetic routes
To demonstrate whether the synthesis process of Y6-CHO is environmentally friendly, we designed possible synthetic routes to Y6-CHO, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Compound 1 can be obtained commercially. Synthetic route (1) refers to the route reported by Cha.40 Compound 3 and synthetic route (2) refer to the work reported by Zou.21 In these two synthetic routes, no toxic substance is used. This indicates that Y6-CHO is the most suitable for obtaining high-performance as well as environmentally friendly FREAs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we utilized seven electron-withdrawing groups (–CNH, –NO, –CHO, –CO–CH3, –CO–OH, –CO–Cl, and –CO–Br) to replace –CN in the commonly used acceptor Y6 for designing seven new materials (Y6-CNH, Y6-NO, Y6-CHO, Y6-COCH3, Y6-COOH, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr). The results of orbital energy, electron affinity, predicted VOC, light absorption intensity, and exciton binding energy indicate that Y6-CHO, Y6-COCl, and Y6-COBr are appropriate candidates for developing high-performance FREAs. The electron mobility of Y6-CHO (3.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is approximately 28 times that of Y6-COCl (1.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and Y6-COBr (1.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the possible synthetic route to Y6-CHO is environmentally friendly. Therefore, Y6-CHO is the best candidate for developing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs among the seven materials originally designed. Our results suggested that replacing the toxic –CN group with –CHO is a feasible method for constructing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs. This approach can assist experimental scientists in synthesizing high-performance environmentally friendly FREAs.
