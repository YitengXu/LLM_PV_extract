    First published on 26th March 2018AbstractFunctionalized nanoporous carbon materials have attracted the colossal interest of the materials science fraternity owing to their intriguing physical and chemical properties including a well-ordered porous structure, exemplary high specific surface areas, electronic and ionic conductivity, excellent accessibility to active sites, and enhanced mass transport and diffusion. These properties make them a special and unique choice for various applications in divergent fields such as energy storage batteries, supercapacitors, energy conversion fuel cells, adsorption/separation of bulky molecules, heterogeneous catalysts, catalyst supports, photocatalysis, carbon capture, gas storage, biomolecule detection, vapour sensing and drug delivery. Because of the anisotropic and synergistic effects arising from the heteroatom doping at the nanoscale, these novel materials show high potential especially in electrochemical applications such as batteries, supercapacitors and electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications and water electrolysis. In order to gain the optimal benefit, it is necessary to implement tailor made functionalities in the porous carbon surfaces as well as in the carbon skeleton through the comprehensive experimentation. These most appealing nanoporous carbon materials can be synthesized through the carbonization of high carbon containing molecular precursors by using soft or hard templating or non-templating pathways. This review encompasses the approaches and the wide range of methodologies that have been employed over the last five years in the preparation and functionalisation of nanoporous carbon materials via incorporation of metals, non-metal heteroatoms, multiple heteroatoms, and various surface functional groups that mostly dictate their place in a wide range of practical applications.

1. Introduction
The design of carbon materials with ordered porous structure is one of the hot topics in the area of materials chemistry. The high specific surface area, large pore volume, well-ordered and controllable porous structure, unique morphologies of carbons and their excellent chemical, mechanical and thermal stability make them attractive for various applications including energy storage and conversion, catalysis and sensing.1–4 Generally, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and ordered nanoporous (micro and mesoporous) carbons have been widely applied for energy and environmental applications including as adsorbents for the purification of water and capture of greenhouse gases.5,6 However, the complex synthesis methods required for the fabrication of carbon nanotubes or fullerenes place a hurdle in the path of exploiting their full potential in various applications. On the other hand, the preparation of highly ordered nanoporous carbons is quite simple and the properties of these materials are much better than those of other carbon materials owing to their ordered porous structure. Most importantly, the well-ordered porous structures support the addition of new functionalities including organic or inorganic or biomaterials inside the porous channels or on the surface of the carbon walls, which significantly enhance their performances in various applications.
Highly ordered nanoporous carbon materials have been traditionally used for many years in a large number of practical applications including catalysis, energy storage and conversion, adsorption and separation and biomedical engineering. The first report on the preparation of highly ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-1) via the nanocasting approach led to a new class of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs), with large specific surface areas and tunable pore diameters between 2 and 50 nm.1,7 This invention has led to the discovery of many useful porous materials including carbons, polymers, metal oxides, silicas and metals which are considered as potential game changers for various current technologies.1,7 The structure of these nanoporous materials can be controlled by varying the structure of the templates used for the synthesis. For example, several mesoporous silica materials with different structures including MCM-48, SBA-1, SBA-15, SBA-16, KIT-6 and KIT-5 have been used as templates for the fabrication of mesoporous carbon materials (CMK-x) with different mesoporous structures.8–12 A similar nano-hard templating approach was also used by Hyeon et al. for the preparation of ordered porous carbon using phenolic resin as the source of carbon.13,14 OMCs having surface areas of more than 2000 m2 g−1, a higher pore volume of up to 3.0 cm3 g−1 and tuneable pore diameters along with high conductivity can be achieved through a nano-hard templating approach using mesoporous silica hard-templates. Because of their excellent textural characteristics, physical properties and chemical stability, OMCs have been productively utilized in carbocatalysis, adsorption and separation of toxic molecules, gas storage, selective sensing, energy conversion fuel and solar cells, batteries, super(ultra)capacitors, and biomedical devices.4,15–17 The properties and the performance of these OMCs can be controlled by modification of the porous structure with organic or inorganic moieties. For example, the introduction of foreign atoms such as B, N, O, S and P in the carbon framework can tune not only the specific surface area and electronic properties of the materials but also their performance in catalysis or sensing. These factors are critical for various applications including semiconductors, field emission devices, optical and electronic devices and fuel cells. Therefore, research on the development of ordered nanoporous carbons with different functional groups is actively progressing for energy and electrocatalytic applications. Several review articles have been reported on the preparation of pure mesoporous carbons and their applications.4,18–21 However, review papers on the recent development in the preparation, functionalization and applications of nanoporous carbon materials are quite limited.21 For instance, much progress has been made recently in the conversion of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) into highly dispersed metal/metal oxide functionalized nanoporous carbons without any external sacrificial templates for energy related applications.21–23
In this review, we give an overview of the latest advances in the synthesis, structural characteristics, physicochemical properties and application of pristine and functionalized OMCs (Table 1). Much emphasis will be given on the relatively new and exciting discoveries of nanoporous carbon materials with different organic or inorganic functional moieties such as B, N, O, S and P, amines, complexes and hybrid OMCs incorporated with metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides and graphene. We also address how these added functionalities may affect the final performance of the materials in various applications including sensing, drug delivery, carbon capture, energy storage and conversion and adsorption and separation (Fig. 1). New developments in the improvement of the properties and performance of a variety of functionalized nanoporous carbons reported during the last five years are also described in detail with the aim of demonstrating the uniqueness and the real academic and market potential of these materials. Finally, new directions and the development of these nanostructures and the extension of the application of these materials to various fields are described in the conclusion and future prospects section.

2. Synthesis methods
OMCs and heteroatom doped OMCs are generally prepared by using templating strategies. Two well-established templating techniques such as hard and soft templating methods are employed for the synthesis of OMCs and heteroatom doped OMCs. In the soft-templating method, the ordered mesoporous framework structure is achieved by the cooperative assembly of amphiphilic surfactant molecules and precursor moieties. In this case, mesoporosity is generated upon removing the surfactants through the calcination process at high temperatures. The nanocasting method is rather a conventional templating process, but the scale of production is of a nanoscale order. In the nano templating approach, highly ordered inorganic mesoporous solid materials are used to replicate their structure into nanoporous carbon materials with well-ordered mesoporosity. There are several review articles outlining the details of these synthetic processes including history, different synthetic strategies, and the formation mechanism for obtaining ordered nanoporous carbons.2,4,7,15 However, in the present review, we will discuss the recently reported synthesis methods and templating strategies applicable to OMCs from the last five years.
2.1 Hard templating method for OMCs
The hard templating approach is considered as one of the most straightforward ways for synthesizing OMCs.7 Ordered mesoporosity in carbon materials can be easily introduced by the nanocasting technique using mesoporous inorganic materials such as mesoporous silica and zeolites as hard templates. Various mesoporous carbons with different textural properties have been prepared by using different porous templates through this simple technique and the details of the materials and the structural parameters are given in Table 1. Although many materials have been prepared, the control of structure and morphology of the materials has been gaining significant attention owing to the correlation with their final textural parameters. To control the morphology of the final OMCs, it is necessary to control the morphology of the template materials. Schuster et al. reported that spherical OMC nanoparticles with bimodal pore size distribution having mean pore sizes centred at 6 and 3.1 nm and having 300 nm kinetic diameter can be prepared via the nano templating approach by using the phenol and formaldehyde mixture precursor and spherical silica as a hard template.24 The material showed a high specific surface area of 2445 m2 g−1 and the highest inner pore volumes up to 2.32 cm3 g−1. In this case, the shape of silica hard templates has been achieved by using 400 nm PMMA spheres with a close packed opal structure. This unique structure has been replicated into the final nanoporous carbon samples. The typical spherically ordered opal structures of OMCs with large domains of nanoparticles are shown in the TEM images and DLS measurements. Seo et al. demonstrated the preparation of OMCs by using furfuryl alcohol (FA) as a carbon source and phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid impregnated acidified mesoporous silica as a precursor.25 This work was aimed at preventing the generation of external carbon by selecting a moderately weak acid that would slowly catalyze the polymerization of FA. However, the obtained OMCs exhibited a lower surface area than OMCs prepared by using unmodified mesoporous silicas.
The hard templating approach can also be used to prepare nanoporous carbon in the form of monoliths. Hierarchically porous carbon monoliths (HPCMs) with both ordered hexagonal mesoporosity and three-dimensionally connected macroporosity, and controlled morphologies have been synthesized via a simple nanocasting pathway by using hierarchically macro/mesoporous silica with tunable morphologies as a hard template and the FA and trimethyl benzene (TMB) mixture as a carbon source. These monoliths exhibit high pore volumes (1.6 cm3 g−1) and specific surface areas (1354 m2 g−1) and a strong hydrophobicity due to the nature of the precursor used in the synthesis.26 These results reveal that the selection of the precursors is the key to control the surface characteristics of the final carbon materials.
OMCs with various surface areas of 1361 to 3840 m2 g−1 and tunable micropores have been prepared by using zeolite Y and zeolite EMC-2 as sacrificial hard templates and FA as the precursor.27,28 Although FA was used as the precursor for zeolite templated porous carbons, the pores of the zeolites are too small to accommodate bulky molecular precursors. Ryoo et al. have tackled this problem by using ethanol as a carbon source and hierarchically meso-/microporous zeolite beta as a template for the synthesis of hierarchically nanoporous carbons with mesopore–micropore hierarchy.29 The hierarchically porous carbons exhibited a high BET surface area of 2220 m2 g−1, a large micropore volume of 0.62 cm3 g−1 and a mesopore volume of 1.48 cm3 g−1. The authors concluded that the ethanol precursor is more suitable for hierarchical carbon synthesis, as compared with propylene or acetylene gas precursors, which is mainly because of the formation of water vapour due to the decomposition of ethanol during the heat treatment. It is also assumed that this process assisted in delaying the deposition of carbons at the exterior. Nueangnoraj et al. reported on the formation of cross linked fullerene like three dimensional graphene based ordered microporous carbon with a surface area of 2100 m2 g−1 in the confined nanochannels of zeolite Y by using acetylene gas through a pulsed chemical vapour deposition technique.30
Mokaya et al. introduced an elegant approach to synthesise porous carbons with an ultra high surface area of 3332 m2 g−1 and a specific pore volume of 1.66 cm3 g−1 through the simple impregnation of zeolite13X with FA followed by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of ethylene gas.31 This unique double filling approach introduced graphene sheets with a large number of edges within the nanochannels, which are responsible for enhancing the specific surface area of the final carbons. The same group also demonstrated a pressure assisted strategy to create microporosity within the porous carbons derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) templates.32–34 This simple compaction technique can be used as an effective method to either increase or decrease the textural properties of the activated ZIF-templated carbons as it has the potential to create new micropores or decrease the size of the large mesopores into micropores. The properties of the OMCs can also be significantly altered with the external agents such as metal oxides.
Ryoo and his co-workers realized this wonderful opportunity and demonstrated a ground breaking lanthanum-catalysed zeolite templated synthesis process of microporous 3D graphene-like carbon materials using ethylene as a carbon precursor, which have two times higher conductivity than that of CMK-3 (Fig. 2).35 This is an energy efficient synthesis process as it requires a carbonization temperature of only 600 °C, whereas the conventional microporous graphene synthesis requires a temperature in the range of 900 to 1000 °C. Noteworthily, microporous carbon deposition in lanthanum modified zeolite Y occurs more than 20 times faster than in an acidic HY zeolite. Acetylene gas can also be used instead of ethylene to construct carbon frameworks by using modified zeolites. As acetylene gas is more reactive than ethylene, carbon deposition can be accomplished even at lower temperatures as low as 340 °C.35 If the realized microporous carbon materials possess a poorly ordered porous structure, they can be converted to highly ordered materials after heat treatment of 900 °C.36 The same group has also developed a large scale (70 g batch) synthesis of 3D graphene-like ordered microporous carbon with 2770 m2 g−1 BET surface area and 1.32 cm3 g−1 pore volume by using the cost effective calcium modified zeolite X template and ethylene gas under the same conditions.37 These zeolite templated carbons (ZTCs) have a higher particle density and a higher surface area (around 3000 m2 g−1) than CMK-3. The gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of ZTCs are the highest among all the carbon materials, and therefore they exhibit a superior capacity for energy storage. These approaches demonstrated that the preparation strategy is the key to control the final properties of the OMC which ultimately determine their performances in various applications. Although these materials have interesting properties, the main issue that places a hurdle in the path of their commercialization is the removal of the mesoporous silica and zeolite hard templates by highly toxic HF. Therefore, the researchers found eco and environmentally friendly soft templating approaches to prepare OMCs without compromising the textural parameters.

2.2 Soft templating method for OMCs
The soft-templating approach has been widely applied for the synthesis of various mesoporous materials including zeolites, silica, inorganic metal oxides and mesoporous carbons.38–44 Preparation procedures for silica, zeolites and metal oxides have been well established.45,46 However, the direct synthesis of OMCs by the soft-templating approach is not straightforward. Various factors including the functionalization of templates with polymeric units, hydrogen bonding between the template and the precursors, organic–organic composites, organic–organic self-assembly, and hydrogen bonding induced organic–organic self-assembly have been optimized to obtain OMCs with excellent textural parameters.15,41,47
Among these strategies, the direct synthesis of OMCs using organic–organic self-assembly involving the combination of polymerizable precursors and block copolymer templates is expected to be more flexible than other soft templating methods and the traditional hard templating nanocasting methods.47 Li et al. reported a series of hexagonally ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC-Ts) by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature of the resorcinol and formaldehyde mixture via a soft templating and catalytic graphitization approach by using the Pluronic F127, EO106PO70EO20 triblock copolymer as the template and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as a catalyst.50 The structure of OMC-Ts has a two-dimensional hexagonal (p6mm) mesostructure with tubule like morphology. The OMC-700 sample synthesized at 700 °C showed a high specific surface area of 808 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.55 cm3 g−1 with a uniform mean pore size of 4.8 nm.
Sterk et al. described a soft-templating synthesis procedure to prepare OMCs with BET surface area up to 780 m2 g−1 using triblock copolymer F127 and phenolic resin precursors in the presence of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). In this case, silver nitrate was added in the synthesis mixture to increase the microporosity as well the metal nanoparticles in the porous channels of OMCs.51 Monolithic mesoporous carbons were also prepared from resorcinol–formaldehyde resin through a simple autoclaving method using citric acid as a catalyst and triblock copolymer F127 as a structure directing agent. The obtained mesoporous carbons have a hexagonal pore system, a uniform pore size of ∼5.0 nm and a high BET surface area of ∼758 m2 g−1.52 A similar strategy was also adopted to prepare highly ordered OMC films with controllable mesostructures and highly accessible surfaces. A simple direct carbonization of phenolic resin and the conventional Pluronic F127 and EO106PO70EO20 triblock copolymer as a template afforded the highly ordered OMC films (Fig. 3).53 The structure of the films can be controlled by adjusting the amount of the surfactant in the synthesis mixture. The unique concept of mesostructural transformation of cage-type to tubular frameworks via anisotropic shrinkage upon increasing the carbonization temperature was also demonstrated.40 Anisotropic shrinkage upon increasing the carbonization temperature has been observed for thin film samples and the process changes the space group of the obtained films. On the other hand, only unit cell parameters were reduced for the powder samples upon alteration of carbonization temperature while keeping the original space groups by isotropic shrinkage with condensation of the framework. This unique approach involving a simple adjustment of the preparation conditions, the amount of Pluronic F127, and the carbonization temperature is found to be an effective tool for controlling the structure of OMC films.

3. Heteroatom doped OMCs
Heteroatom doping is the replacement of some of the carbon atoms in the uniform graphitic carbon structure with other foreign atoms which significantly changes the electronic, electrical and surface charge properties of the final materials. The introduction of heteroatoms such as boron, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus into the OMCs could cause electron modulation due to their different electronegativity. This also tunes their charge distribution, optoelectronic properties and/or defect induced chemical functionalities, which are useful for many technological applications.115,116 Heteroatom-doped OMCs can be prepared either by in situ doping during the preparation of nanoporous carbon materials or through post-treatment of preformed carbon nanomaterials with heteroatom-containing precursors.117 The post treatment procedure often leads to only surface functionalization without altering their bulk properties whereas the in situ doping of heteroatoms can help to homogeneously incorporate the heteroatoms into the entire nanoporous carbon matrix.
3.1 Nitrogen doped OMCs
Nitrogen is one of the neighbour elements next to carbon in the periodic table and it has an atomic radius similar to that of carbon but has different electronic configuration and electronegativity.117 Thus, nitrogen doping into the OMCs could change their electronic structures while minimizing the lattice mismatch, leading to unique electronic properties. Great efforts have been paid to introduce nitrogen atoms into OMCs as the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the nanoporous carbon matrix can significantly enhance their conducting, field emission, catalytic, and energy storage properties.118–132

3.1.1 Hard templating approach. 
The precursors containing N atoms including polymeric compounds, acetonitrile, urea, aromatic or aliphatic amines are generally used in combination with the hard-templating method for the incorporation of nitrogen in the carbon framework of OMCs.133,134 Recently, Vinu et al. demonstrated the synthesis of highly ordered nitrogen-containing mesoporous carbon (NMC-G) with well-ordered mesopores and various pore diameters and also high basicity using a low-cost, naturally occurring gelatin biomolecule as a single-molecule precursor and 2D hexagonal SBA-15 with different pore diameters prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures as the hard template (Fig. 4).54,55

The realized NMC-G materials have excellent textural properties such as high specific surface areas (764–804 m2 g−1), huge pore volumes (1.14–1.40 cm3 g−1), and mesoporous diameters (3.54–4.89 nm). Recently, Huang et al. made a ground-breaking discovery of the synthesis of self-supported N-doped ordered mesoporous few-layer carbon (OMFLC-N) superstructures catalysed by Ni catalyst through chemical vapour deposition using simple and environmentally friendly precursors such as FA and dicyandiamide (DCDA) and mesoporous SBA-15 silica as the template.56 The OMFLC-N sample exhibited a high conductivity (360 S cm−1) with mesoscopically ordered few-layers and also possessed the largest surface area (1580 m2 g−1), a high total pore volume (2.20 cm3 g−1), the smallest average pore width (2.25 nm), and the most prominent pores smaller than 2 nm. A graphene-like structure with ≤5 layers and minimum number of defects in OMFLC-N were verified by Raman spectroscopy. The introduction of transition metal ions helps in the formation of a highly graphitic structure along the walls whereas N doping changes the electronic structure of the formed carbons. The combination of these factors significantly enhances the conductivity of the final materials.
Natural honey which contains 80–85% carbohydrates, 15–17% water, 0.3% proteins, 0.2% ashes and minor quantities of amino acids and vitamins has also been utilized as the source of nitrogen and carbon for the fabrication of nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOMCs). Guo et al. and Xiao et al. have independently demonstrated the synthesis of NOMCs by the nanocasting method using SBA-15 as the template and natural honey as the source of nitrogen and carbon (Fig. 5). The structure of NOMCs exhibited a two-dimensional hexagonal mesoporous framework, composed of ordered nitrogen doped carbon nano rods. The BET specific surface areas of NOMCs were in the range of 600 to 1100 m2 g−1 but varied significantly with the change of carbonization temperature. It should be noted that the pore size of NOMCs is 4.0 nm, which is less than half of the mesoporous silica template SBA-15 (9.1 nm) but similar to the wall thickness, revealing the transformation of silica walls into pores and the pores of the templates into N-doped carbon walls.57,58 A NOMC nanofiber array was prepared by the combination of a soft templating method and a hard-templating approach using a well-mixed solution of calcined crab shells, Pluronic F127, dicyandiamide (DCDA) and resole.59 NOMC nanofiber arrays possessed four resolved SAXS scattering peaks, which were indexed as the 100, 110, 200, and 210 planes of a 2D hexagonal mesostructure with the space group of p6m. The obtained NOMC nanofiber material also exhibited a high surface area (1030 m2 g−1) and a large pore volume (2.35 cm3 g−1), with uniform mesopores of ca. 15.0 nm which was much larger than that of CMK-3s, OMFLC-N, and NOMCs.1,56–58 These reports clearly reveal that the natural biomasses are unique and low cost sources for the in situ introduction of nitrogen atoms in the carbon framework of OMCs which could offer exciting electronic properties.

Although natural biomasses used for heteroatom doped nanoporous carbons are cost effective, the control of the degree of polymerization is highly difficult. This has been addressed by the judicious choice of easily polymerisable precursors. A facile synthesis route has been developed to prepare nitrogen-doped ordered nanoporous carbons (NONCs) by Wu et al. based on in situ polydopamine coating onto the SBA-15 pore surface.60 The dopamine was quickly self-polymerized onto the pore wall of SBA-15, forming polydopamine/silica nanocomposites in the presence of Tris-buffer solution. The carbonization of the polydopamine/silica nanocomposite in N2 and then removal of the silica template eventually led to the formation of NONC material with a BET surface area of 1013 m2 g−1. However, these materials suffered from poor crystallinity which suppresses the conductivity of the materials. This was overcome by the discovery of Yuan et al., who reported the synthesis of nitrogenated graphitic ordered mesoporous carbon (G-OMC) by using mesoporous nickel oxide as a template as well as the catalyst and dopamine as a precursor. The results revealed that G-OMC materials had a higher degree of graphitization compared to those prepared from dopamine and pure SBA-15 as the template, which was mainly because of the catalytic graphitization induced by the nickel oxide catalyst. The ID/IG value of the G-OMC was 0.69, which was much less than the ID/IG value of CMK-3 (0.84), revealing the high graphitic nature of G-OMC.61
For many applications, not only the conductivity but also the amount of nitrogen doping in the carbon framework is also crucial as it sometimes dictates the final performance of the materials. For instance, Park et al. demonstrated the synthesis of mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon with tunable nitrogen content by the simple adjustment of the amount of the precursor, (1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2-yl) methanol (MPM), which is structurally similar to FA, using 3D body centred cubic KIT-6 as a template. The nitrogen content of the resulting carbon was controlled in the range of 0–10 at% and all prepared samples had well-ordered mesopores with diameters of 3.4–4.0 nm and BET specific surface areas of 780–1150 m2 g−1.62
Nitrogen atoms have also been doped with OMCs with different morphologies using different techniques. For example, monodispersed nitrogen-doped hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (N-HMCSs) have been synthesized using a novel “dissolution-capture” method wherein the polystyrene/polyacrylonitrile composite nanospheres (PS@PAN) were used as the carbon and nitrogen resource, which were uniformly coated by a layer of mesoporous silica. After organic solvent treatment, the PS@PAN were dissolved and then captured in the confined nanospace of the mesoporous silica shell. The N-HMCSs with a surface area and pore volume of 807 m2 g−1 and 0.87 cm3 g−1 were produced after carbonization followed by the removal of the template through HF etching.63,64 The orientation of the formed carbon nanorods can be controlled by the simple modification of the surface of the sacrificial template. Wang et al. reported an in situ source-template-interface reaction route to prepare a 3D N-doped hierarchically porous carbon monolith (NHPCM) composed of branched mesoporous rods by the nanocasting method with the amine functionalized hierarchically porous silica monolith (NHPSM) scavenger and FA as the carbon source.65 It has been demonstrated that this unique approach helped to anchor a high density of N atoms on the surface of the NHPCM as a simple solid–solid interface reaction between the carbon precursors and amine functionalized NHPSM favoured the doping on the surface. Asefa et al. also described the NOMC synthesis by using the amine group functionalized mesoporous silica SBA-15 but glucose was used instead of FA as a carbon precursor.66 By varying the nature of the solvents (polar or non-polar) used for grafting amines on the surface of the templates, the amount of N doping on the final NOMC was controlled.
Liang and Tsiakaras et al. reported a novel impregnation method, namely vaporization-capillary condensation process, to synthesize NOMC via the nano hard templating method using SBA-15 as the template and pyrrole as the precursor in the presence of FeCl3 catalyst. This new impregnation method yielded a much larger surface area (661 m2 g−1) and pore volume than the wet incipient method (292 m2 g−1).67,68 With the adjustment of the pore diameter of the SBA-15 template and the carbonization temperature, the textural parameters and nitrogen content of NOMCs prepared from the pyrrole precursor were controlled, respectively.69 NOMCs have also been synthesized by using a mixture of D(+)-glucose and D-glucosamine hydrochloride as carbon precursors and SBA-15 as the template. The as-prepared products showed large pore volumes (0.59–0.97 cm3 g−1), high surface areas (352.72–1152.67 m2 g−1) and rational nitrogen content (ca. 2.5–3.9 wt%).70 In another study, Sanchez et al. demonstrated the NOMC synthesis by using SBA-15 and two aromatic polyaramids, namely m-aminobenzoic acid (MABA) and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), as the precursors for C and N.71 NOMCs with different morphologies and a nitrogen content of 3.5–3.7 at% were also prepared by Yu et al. through the pyrolysis of iron phthalocyanine infiltrated in SBA-15 with different mesochannel lengths. The BET surface area was found to be decreased with increasing mesopore channel length of the SBA-15 template.74 Transition metal containing precursors not only act as the source of porous carbons, but also as catalysts in improving the graphitic nature and conductivity of the resulting materials.
Aniline, pyrrole and phenanthroline were also independently used as nitrogenated carbon precursors to synthesize NOMCs by the nanocasting method with SBA-15 template. The NOMC materials derived from pyrrole (C-PY-900: 765 m2 g−1) and phenanthroline (C-Phen-900: 746 m2 g−1) exhibited higher specific surface areas compared to the aniline analogue but the nitrogen content of these samples was almost constant (3.1–3.3 at%) for the three carbon sources, except for a slight difference in the nitrogen configuration.135 NOMC catalyst was directly synthesized using SBA-15 as a hard template, sucrose as a carbon source and urea as a nitrogen source. A 3.6 wt% nitrogen doping in the NOMC was achieved with more than 70% of the nitrogen incorporated as quaternary nitrogen species.136 This is one of the best ways of controlling the nature of the nitrogen species on the wall structure of the NOMCs.
Nitrogen doping was also tried in porous carbons with different pore diameters. Chen et al. reported on the synthesis of nitrogen-doped micro-mesoporous carbon material with a surface area of 789–1367 m2 g−1 by employing urea–formaldehyde resin as carbon and nitrogen sources, zinc chloride as a porogen and SBA-15 as a hard template.137 Nitrogen doped three dimensionally ordered microporous carbon (N-ZTC) was also synthesized by using aqueous acetonitrile as a nitrogen-containing carbon source and zeolite beta as a template. The obtained materials possess a nitrogen content of approximately 4 wt% and a large surface area and pore volume of 1860 m2 g−1 and 1.4 cm3 g−1, respectively.138 Ling et al. reported on the hard-templating synthesis of pristine and functionalized CMK-3 materials having BET surface areas in the range of 1152 to 1760 m2 g−1 with various functionalities, including micropore development, nitrogen doping by using SBA-15 as the mesopore template, and silicate oligomer as the micropore template, low-molecular-weight phenolic resins as the carbon precursors and nitrogen-rich hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM) as a nitrogen precursor.139
Ahn et al. synthesized a series of ladder type nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (CPANs), which were found to have high stability, by using SBA-15 and in situ polymerization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) inside the mesochannels of the template at different carbonization temperatures. Among the materials prepared, CPAN-800, synthesized at the carbonization temperature of 800 °C, was found to be the best one with many desirable properties such as high specific surface area (1182 m2 g−1) and pore volume (1.54 cm3 g−1), a moderate nitrogen content of 9.52%, and a highly ordered mesoporous structure with uniform pore sizes of 4.34 nm.140 Zhao et al. adopted a similar strategy but used a low molecular weight phenolic resin (resol) as a carbon source and a high nitrogen-containing cyanamide as the nitrogen dopant. The prepared NOMCs exhibited a high surface area of 1741 m2 g−1 and nitrogen content up to 15 wt% by the nanocasting approach. It was also demonstrated that the BET surface area (1397–1741 m2 g−1), pore size (3.6–4.1 nm) and pore volume (1.05–1.81 cm3 g−1) were easily tailored by controlling the cyanamide-to-resol mass ratio or the carbonization temperature in the range of 600–900 °C.78 Yang et al. used a silica gel template with a 3D continuous skeleton and PAN in DMF solution for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NNCM) with a tunable pore volume (1.22 to 2.11 cm3 g−1) but a fixed pore size in order to control the coating density for miniaturized energy devices. This was achieved by the simple adjustment of the quantity of PAN in DMF in the mesochannels of the 3D template.79 3D NOMCs having a BET surface area up to 1131 m2 g−1 have been prepared by using three dimensionally ordered silica as the template and FA and oxalic acid as the carbon source and an acid catalyst, respectively, under ammonia pyrolysis.141
Nitrogen doped hierarchically porous carbon materials (HPC-Ns) have been successfully synthesized by Shi et al. by applying a simple N-doping procedure using the FA, oxalic acid and urea mixture in ethanol solution as a carbon and nitrogen precursor and hierarchically macro/mesoporous silica as a template. The synthesized HPC-N samples demonstrated 3D connected ordered mesoporosity with an extremely large specific surface area (2473 m2 g−1) and relatively high content of pyridinic N.72 It was clear that when the nitrogen precursor was combined with an organic polar solvent, the specific surface area was significantly enhanced.
3D interconnected nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbons (NHPC-3D) were also prepared via a hard-templating method with colloidal silica spheres (80 nm) and dopamine as the template and precursor, respectively. One of the interesting features of this study was the use of dopamine as the nitrogen precursor and the utilization of large sized colloidal silica nanoparticles as templates. Dopamine has several advantages such as self and low temperature polymerization, easy interaction with the surface of any templates and the final total carbon yield after carbonization. In addition, the templates with large nanoparticles offered a 3D structure with macropores. The obtained NHPC-3D also exhibited a high surface area of 1056 m2 g−1, a large pore volume of 2.56 cm3 g−1, and a high nitrogen content of 8.2 wt%, which also revealed the presence of a large quantity of micropores in the samples.73 Huo et al. also used the dopamine precursor and the mesoporous silica hollow sphere template to prepare nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (NMCHSs) with a specific surface area of 411.6 m2 g−1.75 Tang et al. developed an innovative method based on sublimation and capillary condensation assisted nanocasting for the fabrication of Fe and N dual-doped mesoporous carbon catalyst with 988 m2 g−1 BET surface area and 0.87 cm3 g−1 pore volume. Easily sublimable iron phthalocyanine was used as the source of iron, nitrogen and carbon, while mesoporous silica SBA-15 was used as the hard template.142
Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (NMCS) were prepared by a nanocasting route using benzoxazine resins as the precursor of nitrogen and carbon, and ordered mesoporous silica spheres as the hard template. The prepared NMCS exhibited amorphous spherical nanoparticles with worm-like mesoporous channels, and the specific surface area, pore volume and nitrogen contents were 634 m2 g−1, 0.91 cm3 g−1 and 3.50 (wt%), respectively.143 Nitrogen-doped hierarchically mesoporous/microporous carbon (NMMC) was also prepared by using the nitrogen-doped mesoporous titanium-carbide/carbon composite, followed by removal of carbides with chlorination. The obtained NMMC gave a high surface area of 1344 m2 g−1 and exhibited micropores that were drilled on the mesopore walls with the size of 0.70, 0.97 and 1.61 nm.76
Although the solvents play an important role in controlling the pore filling which is critical not only for controlling the nitrogen content but also the structural order of the materials sometimes they significantly increase the total cost of the production of the materials. Gao et al. described the synthesis of NOMCs with improved yields of up to 25% by direct heating of amino acids inside the porous channels of SBA-15 without using any solvent and metal catalysts. The diverse types of amino acids, their variable interactions with SBA-15 and different pyrolytic behaviours led to nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons with tunable surface areas (700–1400 m2 g−1), pore volumes (0.9–2.5 cm3 g−1), and pore sizes (4.3–10 nm).77
Nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (meso-BMP) was synthesized by Hasche et al. with the pyrolysis of high nitrogen (17 wt%) containing N-butyl-3-methylpyridinium dicyanamide (BMP-dca) and commercial silica nanoparticles (Ludox HS40) as a template. The N2 adsorption derived BET surface area of the meso-BMP was around 320 m2 g−1 and the total pore volume derived from the NLDFT method was 0.749 cm3 g−1.80 NOMC with a 2D hexagonal symmetry structure was synthesized via a facile solid–solid grinding/templating route, in which the ionic liquids (ILs) 1-cyanoethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and SBA-15 were employed as the precursor and hard template, respectively. The as-synthesized NOMC featured a uniform mesoporous size (3.5 nm), rope-like morphology (0.4–1 μm in length) and a high surface area (803 m2 g−1) with a nitrogen content of 5.5 at%.82 Mesoporous nitrogen doped carbon with surface area up to 325 m2 g−1 was produced through the nano hard template method using resorcinol, melamine, and formaldehyde as the carbon precursors catalyzed by the alkaline medium and mesoporous silica as a hard template.144–147 It was believed that nitrogen doping sometimes results in the collapse of the pore structure of the final porous carbons or creates a lot of defects. Stein et al. used an elegant approach in which a novel ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMI-DCA), based precursor which not only acts as a nitrogen source but also provides structural stabilization was used. In this approach, silica spheres were used as templates which generated NOMC with a high specific surface area and a large pore volume of 1393 m2 g−1 and 4.5 cm3 g−1, respectively.81,148,149 Ionic liquid based precursors are found to be the best sources for stabilising the porous structures of NOMC which resulted in a high specific pore volume owing to their good affinity and adhesion on silica surfaces.150–155
Most of these fabricated materials were made in the form of powder, which may not be useful for making devices for electrochemical sensing applications. Therefore, researchers turned their attention to fabricate these NOMCs in the form of films. For instance, free-standing nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon films were prepared by Peng et al. by carbonization of gelatin/HKUST-1 composite films, which were fabricated from gelatin/copper hydroxide nanostrand composite films. Gelatin was the source of both carbon and nitrogen whereas the copper hydroxides offered porosity. The formation of HKUST-1 crystals expanded the gelatin matrix and produced porous structures which were retained during the carbonization process.156


3.1.2 Soft templating approach. 
As hard templating procedures require the removal of the inorganic materials using toxic acids or strong bases, there has been significant attention to the development of NOMCs using methods other than hard templating. Soft-templating is considered as one of the viable options to avoid the complex and toxic procedure involved in hard templating. In the soft-templating synthesis of NOMCs, two key issues should be kept in mind for the generation of ordered mesoporous frameworks. The first and the most important point to consider before using the soft templating approach is the interaction between the structure directing agents and the nitrogenated precursor as it is a key parameter which supports the formation of highly ordered structures. The other factor is the condensation/polymerization kinetics of intermolecular precursor species. It has been realized that phenolic resins as the carbon source, nitrogen precursors, and polyethylene oxide (PEO)-containing block copolymers as structure directing soft templates, are a good combination for the direct self-assembly synthesis of NOMCs. For example, Liu et al. reported a one-pot route to prepare NOMCs having Ia3d and p6m symmetry with BET surface areas in the range of 500 to 870 m2 g−1 in an aqueous medium by dissolving resorcinol, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and Pluronic F127 in dilute aqueous ammonia. It is worth mentioning that the symmetry of NOMCs changed from Ia3d to P6m upon increasing the carbonization temperature and also by the simple introduction of trimethylbenzene (TMB) during the synthesis.83–85,157
Direct synthesis of NOMCs with a high nitrogen content through the soft templating approach remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of nitrogen precursors capable of co-polymerizing with phenolic resins without deterioration of the order of mesostructural arrangement and a significant diminishment of nitrogen content during carbonization. Dai et al. reported on the direct synthesis of NOMCs through the self-assembly of phenolic resins and a Pluronic block copolymer via the soft-template method under pyrolysis of ammonia.86 This approach did not require any nitrogen-containing carbon precursors or post-treatment, but had the advantage of the preferential reaction and/or replacement of oxygen with nitrogen species, generated by decomposition of ammonia at elevated temperatures, in oxygen-rich polymers during pyrolysis. This method used different steps including carbonization, nitrogen functionalization, and activation in a simple one step process and generated NOMCs with a uniform pore size, a large surface area (up to 1400 m2 g−1), and a high nitrogen content (up to 9.3 at%). The nitrogen atoms are mostly bound in the form of pyridinic and pyrrolic forms.
The evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process has also been tried for the preparation of NOMCs. Zhao et al. made tremendous contribution to the direct synthesis of NOMCs and established different methods for producing the same. Recently, this group has reported a controllable one-pot method to synthesize NOMC with a high N content up to 13.1 wt% by using F127, resol and dicyandiamide as a soft template, a carbon source, and a nitrogen source, respectively. It was assumed that the resol molecules not only assisted in the coordination of the template and the nitrogen precursors through simple hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions but also provided stability to the final NOMCs. The obtained NOMCs possess tunable mesostructures (p6m and Im3m symmetry) and pore size (3.1–17.6 nm) and high surface areas of 494–586 m2 g−1.87 Later, NOMCs were prepared via a two-step approach by using the resorcinol (R), formaldehyde (F) and dicyandiamide (DCD) mixture as the precursor. In this approach, dicyandiamide, formaldehyde and resorcinol were pre-polymerized in the presence of Na2CO3 base catalyst to produce DCD-RF resol. The DCD-RF resol was mixed with a solution of triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 followed by the addition of 2 M aqueous HCl solution to facilitate self-assembly and condensation in the second step.88–90 Soluble precursors such as urea–phenol–formaldehyde resin have been used as the nitrogen source for the preparation of NOMC spheres with a mean diameter of 240 nm and Im3m symmetry through a simple co-assembly with the polymeric surfactants under highly acidic conditions (Fig. 6). By adjusting the ratio of urea to phenol, the nitrogen content of the NOMCs was controlled.91–93

An aqueous cooperative assembly route has also been employed for the fabrication of NOMC with body centred cubic Im3m symmetry using resorcinol and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) precursors and copolymer F127 as the soft template.158 Xue et al. and Choi et al. separately reported on a co-assembly approach based on Pluronic F127 mediated micelles to convert non-porous melamine and phenolic resin to a highly ordered mesoporous polymeric network (space group: Imm) with a high nitrogen content of 18 at% (Fig. 7).94,95 An amino-acid based cooperative assembly route has been introduced by Liu et al. In this process, basic amino acids such as L-lysine and L-arginine, as polymerization catalysts, and two phenol derivatives, resorcinol and 3-aminophenol, were used as carbon and nitrogen sources and block copolymers F127 and P123 as the soft templates. The NOMCs exhibited a BET surface area up to 256 m2 g−1 with cubic Im3m and hexagonal p6m symmetry depending on the template used in the synthesis process.159

Yang et al. prepared nitrogen-doped carbon aerogels (NCAs) by direct chemical synthesis by using an organic sol–gel process with different mole ratio of tripolycyanamide (T) and resorcinol (R). Then, the organic aerogels were pyrolyzed to obtain NCAs. The N2 adsorption isotherms of the NCAs exhibit a typical type IV isotherm with an obvious hysteresis loop at high relative pressure, which indicates that the prepared material has a mean pore diameter of 12.6 nm.160 The pore diameter of the NCAs was controlled by tuning the concentration of the N precursors with a concomitant increase of the mesoporous fraction. Mesoporous carbon aerogels with 0–4% nitrogen content and a surface area of 798 m2 g−1 were also prepared from 3D resorcinol (R)–melamine (M)–formaldehyde (F) aerogels by tuning the M/R ratio during the polymerization process.161
The dual soft templating technique, the combination of inorganic and organic templates, has been recently receiving much attention for the synthesis of NOMCs with tunable morphologies and pore diameters. Qiao et al. demonstrated the synthesis of a series of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (NMCs) via a facile dual soft-templating procedure using a resorcinol–formaldehyde resin and melamine as carbon and nitrogen precursors, and a mixture of Pluronic F127 and fluorocarbon (FC4) surfactants at different carbonization temperatures. The surface area (307–483 m2 g−1), pore volume (0.3–0.4 cm3 g−1), conductivity, and nitrogen-doping (25–5.5 wt%) concentration of the synthesized NMC were tuned by adjusting the nitrogen content and pyrolysis temperature.99 Porogens combined with the Ni metal catalyst and melamine were added to control the graphitic nature and the porosity of the nitrogen doped porous graphitic carbon (NPGC) with a high surface area of 1027 m2 g−1 and a nitrogen content of 7.7 wt%.96 On the other hand, Xia et al. used resol and dicyandiamide as the carbon and nitrogen precursor together with the porogen TEOS to increase the specific surface area and the pore size of the NOMC to 1374 m2 g−1 and 7.4 nm, respectively.97
Polyhedraloligosilsesquioxanes (POSS) were also used as the carbon source and assembled into hierarchically porous carbon structures by a block copolymer-assisted method using Pluronic P123 and F127 as the soft templates. The structure of the materials was tuned from hexagonal to cubic by changing the nature of the templates. The prepared NOMCs from POSS exhibited a specific surface area of over 2000 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 1.19 cm3 g−1.162 Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon microfibers (NMCMFs) having a surface area of 230 m2 g−1 were prepared via an evaporation-induced tri-consistent assembly of a triblock copolymer F127, resols and prehydrolyzed tetraethoxysilane on natural silk followed by pyrolysis.163 Nitrogen-doped hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (NHCSs) were also prepared from 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and hexamethylenetetramine as precursors and a mixture of Pluronic P123 and sodium oleate as a template, followed by thermal treatment at 650 °C in an ammonia atmosphere and subsequent high temperature annealing at 800–1000 °C in nitrogen.102 Instead of POSS, TiO2 nanostructures were also used as inorganic templates in order to ease the synthesis process and obtain the hierarchically micro/mesoporous framework. Nitrogen-doped hierarchically micro/mesoporous carbon nets were fabricated via supramolecular assemblies of the block copolymer P123 with the assistance of dicyandiamide and TiO2 nanostructures. The as-obtained carbon nets had the combination of both micro and mesopores that gave a specific surface area of approximately 2144 m2 g−1 and a high-level nitrogen doping with a nitrogen content of approximately 8.25 wt%.164
The microwave technique which is considered as an eco-friendly and energy saving approach for the preparation of nanomaterials has been used for the synthesis of NOMCs. Hung et al. used this technique and prepared NOMCs with a high specific surface area of 794 m2 g−1 from carbon–silicate (C–Si) composites via the co-condensation method using a melamine–formaldehyde resin oligomer as the precursor and the P123 triblock copolymer surfactant and sodium silicate as the soft and hard template, respectively.101 Although the technique proposed was eco-friendly, it was found to be not suitable to obtain NOMCs with excellent textural parameters which are needed for enhancing the performance of these materials in many applications including energy storage and conversion.
NOMC with a cubic Im3m symmetry and rhombic dodecahedral single-crystal morphology was also prepared via the organic–organic self-assembly of triblock copolymer F127, 3-aminophenol, and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) in aqueous base solution and it had a specific surface area up to 1159 m2 g−1.100 Guo et al. demonstrated the preparation of nitrogen-doped mesoporous network-like carbon (NMNC) via hydrothermal reaction of glucose solution followed by pyrolysis under an ammonia atmosphere without using any external template. In this work, the self-polymerization reaction of glucose molecules in aqueous solution occurred under hydrothermal conditions at 200 °C. During this step, carbonaceous spheres were produced via aromatization and carbonization of glucose, due to the abundant functional groups (such as –OH, –CHO, –COOH, etc.) on their surfaces. These spheres colluded to form colloidal network-like carbonaceous spheres through intermolecular dehydration and cross-linking with the dehydration reaction among the carbonaceous spheres. The obtained NMNC sample synthesized at 1000 °C (NMNC-1000) exhibited an extremely high specific surface area (2588 m2 g−1), well defined spherical shape morphology and a mesoporous structure which are critical for mass transport and electrochemical applications.98 This elegant approach presents a unique way of improving the specific surface area and the functional groups of porous carbon materials. It can be expected that different combinations of carbon precursors with inorganic metal or metal oxides will offer a new family of porous carbon nanostructures.

3.2 B doped ordered mesoporous carbons
Boron is one of the interesting elements which can not only change the electronic and electrical properties of carbon nanostructures but also the thermal stability under nitrogen or air after substitution in the graphitic framework. Boron-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (B-OMCs) were prepared using an in situ approach via organic–inorganic co-assembly, in which boron-modified phenolic resins were used as the carbon precursor, tetraethyl orthosilicate was used as the inorganic precursor and a reverse amphiphilic triblock copolymer (PO97EO186PO97) was used as the soft template. B-OMCs with BET surface areas of 1040 to 1255 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.55 cm3 g−1 were also prepared by co-impregnation and carbonization of sucrose and 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid into the SBA-15 silica template.103,104 The EISA method has also been used for the preparation of B-OMCs in which resorcinol and boric acid were used as the precursors and Pluronic F127 as the soft template by combining the soft-templating and hydrothermal techniques.106 The content of boron was easily tuned by the simple adjustment of the boric acid to resorcinol ratio. Dense, continuous and amorphous boron-containing ordered mesoporous carbon (CB) films were also synthesized by using resols as a precursor for carbon, boric acid as a heteroatom precursor, and amphiphilic triblock copolymer F127 as a template. In this case, the evaporation-induced triconstituent co-assembly method was used to obtain highly uniform films which were found to have high chemical inertness. This unique property of these films made them attractive for corrosion resistance applications.105
3.3 P doped ordered mesoporous carbons
Phosphorus belongs to group V in the periodic table and has the same number of valence electrons as the nitrogen atom. Although it has lower electronegativity than the N atom, it exhibits almost similar chemical and electronic properties. However, phosphorus has a larger atomic radius and higher electron releasing ability than nitrogen, which make it an excellent choice as dopant for carbon materials. Yu et al. reported on the first synthesis of micron sized phosphorus-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (POMCs) with different lengths through the nanocasting method using SBA-15 mesoporous silica with different sizes as the template and triphenylphosphine and phenol as the phosphorus and carbon sources, respectively. The realized POMCs exhibited a high BET specific surface area of 1182 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 1.87 cm3 g−1 with a mean pore diameter centred at 3.4 nm.107 The content of P in POMCs can be varied by tuning the amount of triphenylphosphine. The amount of P in the carbon nanostructures also controls the micropores in the samples. The specific surface area of the POMCs can be increased to 1338.8 m2 g−1 by a simple adjustment of the P content as it creates a lot of micropores in the walls (Fig. 8).108 Through a careful adjustment of P in the synthesis mixture, porous carbons with different pore parameters and tunable electronic properties could be obtained.

4. Binary atom doped OMC
4.1 N and S co-doped ordered mesoporous carbons
Incorporation of dual heteroatoms in the OMCs provides unique chemical and electronic properties due to the creation of defects and uneven charge distribution in the carbon framework structure. This will also change the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the surface of the framework. In this section, we will show the methods used for different types of OMCs with dual heteroatom dopants and their effect on the structure and properties of the materials. Guan et al. reported sulfur and nitrogen doped ordered mesoporous carbons (SN-OMCs) by using SBA-15 as a scavenger under CVD conditions with ferrocene, pyrimidine and thiophene precursors. After etching away the iron and the SBA-15 silica template, the resulting SN-OMC material featured a distinctive bimodal mesoporous structure with a high BET specific surface area (∼1100 m2 g−1) and uniform distribution of sulfur and nitrogen dopants.109 Different mixed precursors such as pyrrole–sulfuric acid and polythiophene–polypyrrole (PPy) were also used for the preparation of SN-OMC which had a well-ordered porous structure and tunable N and S contents.110 Instead of dual precursors, a single molecular precursor that contains both S and N was also used for the synthesis of SN-OMC. For example, SN-OMCs were synthesized by the nano-casting method using a novel fluidic precursor, acrylonitrile telomer (ANT), and mesoporous silica SBA-15 as a hard template. SN-OMC contained both nitrogen and sulfur atom dopants with 4 and 0.6 at% and also a high specific surface area of 1012 m2 g−1.165 The one step nanocasting technique in which diphenylthiocarbazone was used as a precursor of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen and SBA-15 was used as a nano hard template was also developed for the synthesis of SN-OMC.112 Sulfur-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC-S) with 1.5 wt% sulphur and a BET surface area up to 1261 m2 g−1 was prepared by using SBA-15 as the template and different amounts of sucrose and benzyl disulphide as the carbon and sulfur sources, respectively (Fig. 9).113

4.2 N and O co-doped ordered mesoporous carbons
Polyamides have been used as precursors for the synthesis of nitrogen- and oxygen-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOOMCs) by applying 3-aminobenzoic acid (MABA) and SBA-15 mesoporous silica as a precursor and template through the liquid infiltration and thermal polymerization method. The obtained NOOMCs showed a specific surface area up to 1084 m2 g−1 with a narrow pore size distribution and a mean pore diameter centred at 4.0 nm and nitrogen and oxygen contents as large as 6 and 6.4–11.5 wt%, respectively.166,167 A mixture of molten fructose and urea, which are low cost and environmental friendly precursors, has also been used for the fabrication of NOOMCs with a 3D porous structure using mesoporous silica KIT-6 as a template. The obtained NOOMCs exhibited enhanced surface polarity and a high specific surface area and pore volume of 1197 m2 g−1 and 1.16 cm3 g−1 and heteroatom (O, N) contents of up to 19.1 wt%. However, the content of the dopants can be varied by tuning the quantity of the precursors.168
4.3 Ordered mesoporous carbons with B, P and/or N doping
The combination of P and B doping is another interesting dual dopant which afforded interesting structural and chemical properties. The hydrothermal doping strategy has been applied for the doping of boron and phosphorus into OMCs (HTBP) via a facile aqueous self-assembly using resorcinol as the carbon source, and boric acid and phosphoric acid as the heteroatom source. In this method, Pluronic F127 was employed as the soft template structure-directing agent. By varying the hydrothermal synthesis temperature, the concentration of B and P introduced in the OMCs can be controlled from 0.8 to 1.6 wt% and from 2.3 to 3.6 wt%, respectively.52 This was due to the different interaction of B and P with C precursors at a high hydrothermal temperature. Triple heteroatom doping was also carried out on the OMCs. N, B, and P-doped ordered mesoporous carbons with a surface area up to 550 m2 g−1 were prepared by applying SBA-15 as a nano hard template and a mixture of aniline, triphenylborane and triphenylphosphine as precursors through the nano templating approach.169 First nitrogen was introduced into the carbon matrix using aniline at 900 °C using Fe as a catalyst but the B and P atoms were incorporated into the N doped carbon matrix during the carbonization step.
4.4 Ordered mesoporous carbons with N and P doping
N and P co-doped 3D cubic ordered mesoporous carbons (NP-OMCs) with bimodal mesoporosity and a surface area of 1968 m2 g−1 were prepared using saccharide as a carbon source along with urea and phytic acid (PA) as precursors for N, P and carbon, respectively, and cubic ordered Ia3d mesoporous silica KIT-6 as a hard template.170 2D N and P doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NP-OMCs) were also prepared by using sucrose, cyanamide and phosphoric acid mixtures and SBA-15 as the template. The prepared materials had a high BET surface area (1300 m2 g−1) and a large total pore volume of 1.64 cm3 g−1.171
5. Functionalised nanoporous carbon
The functionalization of the porous structures with organic molecules or inorganic metal or metal oxide nanoparticles can introduce new properties to the parent materials. This will expand the application potential of the OMCs in various fields including adsorption, separation, sensing, energy storage and conversion, and catalysis. The highly ordered porous structure with uniform pores and high specific surface area will provide enough space for the decoration of the surface with different functionalities which will enhance the properties that will be helpful for various applications. However, the fabrication of these functionalities inside the mesochannels without any agglomeration is quite challenging as the uniform distribution of these functionalities is the key to elevate the performance of these materials in several specific applications. Several reports have been published in the literature on metal, metal oxide, alloy, metal complex, graphene, metal chalcogenide, and amine or amine complex, and protein functionalized OMCs. In this section, we will highlight the different methods used for the immobilization of these functionalities in OMCs and how these functionalities create new properties in the final materials.
5.1 Metal nanoparticle immobilized nanoporous carbons
Li et al. described the immobilization of ultra-small size Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) of 3.0 to 5.0 nm in size having a uniform shape and without agglomeration in OMCs. In this method, nitrogen doped OMCs were used in order to provide anchoring support that would avoid the agglomeration of the small sized PdNPs. The incorporation of PdNPs in the OMC-N was performed in a two-step process, immobilization followed by reduction using an aqueous solution of NaBH4. The OMC-N used in this study had 8.6 wt% nitrogen which was introduced by post-synthesis treatment either with NH3 or melamine over FDU type OMC materials.172 Pd supported CMK-3 (Pd/CMK-3) and N-doped CMK-3 (Pd/N-CMK-3) materials were also prepared by impregnating CMK-3 powder with aqueous solutions of 1,10-phenanthroline and H2PdCl4 in two steps via the ultrasound-assisted impregnation strategy followed by reduction using 30 vol% H2/N2 carrier gas at 200 °C.173 The N2 sorption analysis of Pd/CMK-3 and Pd/NCMK-3 showed typical type IV isotherms with clear hysteresis loops of H1-type, indicating that the mesoporous structure and the relatively uniform mesopores of CMK-3 were still preserved in Pd/CMK-3 and Pd/N-CMK-3 samples. Mesoporous carbon (MC-8) and nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (NMC-8) which were prepared based on Zr–SBA-15 as the template were also used as supports to get the Pd NPs of 4.0 and 2.5 nm. NMC-8 and MC-8 supports with surface areas of 1054 m2 g−1 and 1489 m2 g−1 were prepared by carbonization of a mixture of xylene/furfuryl alcohol/oxalic acid with and without ammonia gas nitridation and the hard template method using large pore Zr–SBA-15. Zr atoms were introduced into the template to obtain large pore size in the template which would be beneficial for the decoration of highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles which were prepared by a wet-chemical reduction method.174
As the post-synthetic approach was considered as a time consuming process, Ye et al. used a one-step co-calcination approach to prepare Pd NPs budded on NOMC (Pd/N-MCN) by using phenol, formaldehyde, melamine, and PdCl2 as precursors for C, N and Pd and F127 through the soft templating method.175 The in situ synthesis approach was also adopted for the preparation of Pd NPs supported on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (Pd/N-C) by direct pyrolysis of the palladium dimethylglyoximate complex at 400 °C under 10% hydrogen gas.176 However, the obtained Pd/N-C exhibited a relatively low surface area and pore volume of 124.1 m2 g−1 and 0.158 cm3 g−1, respectively. An in situ spray-drying method followed by the calcination route was used to fabricate 3.8 to 4.5 nm sized Pt nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon microspheres (Pt/CN). This study showed that the size of the Pt NPs and N-doping into conventional carbon black were simultaneously controlled via the spray-drying method and also by adjusting the precursor pH using ammonium hydroxide.177 A nano-Sn/mesoporous carbon parasitic composite was prepared by Duan et al. using immobilization of Sn2+ solution and followed by H2 gas assisted reduction.178 Mesoporous carbon used to anchor Sn nanoparticles has an open porous structure with less than 10 nm filmy pore walls, and the pore diameter is about 30–70 nm, which has been prepared using sucrose as the carbon source and the CaCO3 template. The open porous structure of mesoporous carbon was highly favourable for the filling of tin nanoparticles of 10–30 nm which were uniformly distributed in the pores of the carbon matrix.
Cobalt and iron doped NOMCs (C–N–Co and C–N–Fe) with tunable nitrogen content (up to 9.5%) were prepared from the direct carbonization of vitamin B12 and the polyaniline–Fe (PANI–Fe) complex,179 respectively, and silica nanoparticles, SBA-15, and montmorillonite were used as templates. The specific surface areas of these C–N–Co samples obtained by using silica nanoparticles, SBA-15, and montmorillonite were 568, 387, and 239 m2 g−1, respectively. These values were much higher than that of VB12/C (134 m2 g−1). The mesopore size distributions of the above samples were centred at 12.0, 3.5, and 4.5 nm, respectively, according to the BJH model.180 Mesoporous C–N–Fe material was also prepared by using poly(4-vinylpyridine) and iron chloride as the precursors and SBA-15 as a template.181
The combination of metal and heteroatom doping provides much better chemical and electrical properties compared to that of OMCs doped with either heteroatom or metal nanoparticles. A series of Fe–Nx doped ordered hierarchically micro- and mesoporous carbon (Fe–N-GC) materials were prepared through the nanomoulding synthesis procedures by direct pyrolysis of the various nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as 2,2-bipyridine, p-aminotoluene, p-nitroaniline, and 2-amino pyridine, respectively, and iron chlorides in the confined mesoporous channels of SBA-15 (Fig. 10).182 Fe–N-GC had a high specific surface area of up to 929 m2 g−1, which was composed of a mesopore surface area of 499 m2 g−1 and a micropore surface area of 430 m2 g−1, corresponding to their narrow mesopore size distributions centred at 6.3 nm and micropore size centred at 0.37 nm. Li et al. used the “task-specific” approach by using ferrocene-based ionic liquid [FcN][NTf2] (Fe-IL) as a metal-containing feedstock with a nitrogen-enriched ionic liquid [MCNIm][N(CN)2] (N-IL) as a compatible nitrogen content modulator and SBA-15 template to prepare mesoporous iron–nitrogen-doped carbon (FeX@NOMC).183 FeX@NOMC had a nitrogen content up to 11.9 wt% and a highly ordered mesoporous structure, a high surface area (411–506 m2 g−1), and high pore volumes (0.71–1.05 cm3 g−1) and pore size distribution was highly uniform centred at 5.6 nm.

Ordered hierarchically porous carbon co-doped with N and Fe (Fe–NOHPC) was prepared by Deng et al. through an EISA process followed by carbonization under ammonia by using resol, F127 and FeSO4 as the carbon precursor, soft template and iron source, respectively.184 Fe–NOHPC possessed N and Fe concentrations of 3.54 and 0.18 at%, with an ordered hierarchically porous structure, a high surface area (1172.5 m2 g−1) and a pore volume of 1.03 cm3 g−1. Ahn et al. reported on the preparation of well dispersed Fe nanoparticles within N-doped mesoporous carbon nanofibers (Fe–NMCNF) with a surface area and pore volume up to 468.9 m2 g−1 and 0.95 cm3 g−1 from a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and iron(II) phthalocyanine mixture using electrospinning followed by reduction of H2 gas.185
Cobalt nanoparticles of 6.7 to 12.8 nm in size were immobilized on the OMC-N materials through the excessive wetness impregnation method using the Co(NO3)2 precursor by an auto reduction process without using any external reductant. The size of the Co nanoparticles was reduced from 12.8 to 6.7 nm with an increase in the nitrogen content in the NOMC samples from 5.8 to 10.4 wt%. However, the size of the particles was increased to 19.4 nm when OMC without any N dopant was used, confirming the anchoring role of N functionalities in OMCs.186 The soft-templating method was also used for the in situ preparation of Co nanoparticles in NOMCs. 3D cobalt–nitrogen-doped ordered macro-/mesoporous carbons (Co–N-OMMCs) with 9.64 wt% nitrogen and 1.52 wt% Co were prepared from a mixture of resol/dicyandiamide (DCDA)/Co(NO3)2 through a dual-templating approach using opal colloidal silica spheres as a macroporous mold and triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as a mesoporous template. In the synthesis process, an aqueous/ethanolic solution containing resol, DCDA, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and F127 was infiltrated into the void spaces of the silica opal template, and the mesostructure was formed during an EISA process.187 The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of Co–N-OMMCs samples were of type IV with a high specific surface area and a total pore volume of 679 m2 g−1 and 1.71 cm3 g−1, respectively, with an average pore size centred at 11.2 nm. Direct polymerization of a reverse copolymer PPO–PEO–PPO/[Ni(H2O)6](NO3)2/phenolic resin self-assembled in ethanol medium yielded highly decorated Ni nanoparticles in the OMCs. During the pyrolysis process, Ni2+ was reduced into metallic Ni nanoparticles which were uniformly distributed on the surface of OMCs.
5.2 Alloy nanoparticle incorporated nanoporous carbons
The combination of metals can introduce unique electrical and electronic properties as it tunes the electronic structure of the nanoparticles. In addition, alloy systems have also been employed in many catalytic systems owing to their ability to lower the activation barrier. Most importantly, the concept of alloying can also significantly reduce the cost of the materials. By decorating these alloy systems on highly ordered support systems, the active specific surface area or the properties of the alloy nanoparticles can be significantly altered. In this section, we will summarise the different methods employed for the fabrication of various alloy or bimetallic doped OMCs and how these nanoparticles affect the properties of the final materials.
Maiyalagan et al. reported on the deposition of Pt–Ru alloy nanoparticles of 3.8 nm size with a Pt/Ru atomic ratio of 1:1 and 20 wt% metal loading (Pt–Ru) in the highly ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-8 by using the sodium borohydride based wet chemical reduction method.188 The noble metals were co-doped with transition metal nanoparticles inside the mesochannels of OMCs in order to reduce the total cost of these catalytic systems. Wang et al. described the synthesis of PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles with a molar ratio of Pt:Co of about 1:1.1 supported on the NOMC framework with ultrafine dispersion and uniform particle size distribution (ca. 1.5 nm) through the wet impregnation method followed by reduction at 500 °C in a flow of 5% H2 in Ar.189 The surface area, pore volume and pore size of PtCo/NOMC were 507 m2 g−1, 0.41 cm3 g−1 and 6.5 nm, respectively. NiFe alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in the mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon sphere (MNCS) were also synthesized using direct thermal pyrolysis of nickel hexacyanoferrate at 500 °C without using any external template (Fig. 11).190 Pd3Cu alloy nanoparticles were also encapsulated inside the mesochannels of NOMCs using PdCl2 and cupric acetate as precursors for Pd and Cu, and sodium citrate as a reducing agent via the wet chemistry method.191

5.3 Metal oxide and metal chalcogenide functionalized nanoporous carbons
Metal oxide nanoparticles have been widely used in various applications. However, the textural properties of these oxides are the limiting factors which affect the final performance of the materials in different applications. On the other hand, metal chalcogenides are unique semiconducting materials and they complement semi metallic graphene. They are widely employed in electronic and optoelectronic applications owing to their small energy band gap. By functionalizing these metal chalcogenide or metal oxide nanostructures inside the mesochannels of OMCs, new advanced porous materials with improved properties can be realized. Shen et al. reported on the synthesis of the mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C nanocomposite by post functionalization of acid treated CMK-3 through the sintering of lithium acetate and tetra butyl titanate precursors at 750 °C for 6 h in a nitrogen atmosphere.192 The small Li4Ti5O11 nanocrystals were nicely interconnected in the mesochannels of OMCs which significantly increased the ionic and electronic conductivity of the composite system. These factors are critical for energy storage applications, especially in batteries. A significant reduction of the specific surface area from 1138 m2 g−1 to 127 m2 g−1 confirmed the formation of these Li4Ti5O12 nanocrystals inside the mesochannels of OMCs.
Meso-porous C–TiO2 nanocomposites with anatase TiO2 whose contents ranged from 40 wt% to 87 wt% were prepared through the EISA strategy by using TiCl4 and/or Ti(OC4H9)4 as titanium sources, phenolic resin as the carbon source, and triblock copolymer F127 or P123 as the structure-directing agent.193 Nitrogen-doped urchin-like Fe3O4@C–N composites were prepared by a simple hydrothermal carbonization of hydroxyferric oxide (α-FeOOH) coated with polydopamine (PDA) at 400 °C under an Ar atmosphere.194 Cobalt oxide particles of 30–50 nm encapsulated in nitrogen co-doped carbon (Co–N/C) bi-catalysts were prepared via a one-pot approach by using dopamine hydrochloride (DA) and formaldehyde (F) as nitrogen containing carbon sources, P123 as a soft template and cobalt acetate as a precursor for Co.195 Iron sulphides (Fe1−xS) embedded in nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon spheres (Fe1−xS/N, S-MGCSs) were synthesized via a two-step pyrolysis followed by the acid leaching process. The preparation of Fe1−xS/N, S-MGCSs involved the coordination of Fe2+ with PDA followed by carbonization and leaching of iron oxides and finally vulcanization under thiourea. The prepared Fe1−xS/N, S-MGCS materials had a specific surface area and pore volume up to 371.4 m2 g−1 and 0.41 cm3 g−1, respectively.196
N-Doped mesoporous carbon capped with MoO2 nanobelts (MoO2@NC) was prepared by in situ thermal reduction of MoO3 nanobelts and the one-step annealing of polypyrrole precursor.197 Sun et al. described a facile melt-impregnation method for the confinement of Se2S6 ultra small nanocrystals in the nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (Se2S6/NMCs).198 In the synthesis of Se2S6/NMCs, selenium and sulphur melts are miscible with each other at 500 °C and then infiltrated into the mesopores of NMCs. The composite Se2S6/NMCs had a considerable amount of mesoporosity with a specific surface area of 159 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.8 cm3 g−1.
5.4 Graphene functionalised nanoporous carbon
Graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon layers with a crystalline honeycomb lattice and with the layers connected by relatively weak forces, has gained substantial importance due to the open porous structure accrued from the stacking. Graphene tends to exhibit exclusive physical and chemical properties due to the ease of stacking to form graphite and it can be rolled to form nanotubes or spherical fullerenes. Although graphene is a fascinating material with an effective surface area, the undeveloped porous structure limits the opportunity of developing graphene into a useful multi-dimensional flexible material. Recently, various constructive ideas have been executed to build graphene with nanoporous structures and to utilize the surface defects originated from imperfections of the crystal lattice for immobilisation and anchoring of various nanoparticles or for fabricating hybrid graphene materials. Noteworthily, the chemically synthesised graphene through coupling reactions is usually said to be nanographene and nanoporous graphene which is the hot topic in the development of new generation materials.
Despite graphene being one of the highest surface area materials, graphene derived materials possess a very low surface area when compared with the single layer graphene especially due to the π stacking exhibited by the graphene sheets. Therefore, it is wise to create porosity in graphene based materials to increase the specific surface area, and so far there have been four effective ways to achieve this, namely the exfoliation technique, templating methods, stacking/aggregation and reduction of graphene oxide to form the core or hydrogels and finally integrating graphene using spacers. In this section, we will focus on the functionalization of graphene on the mesoporous channels of OMCs.
Porous and non-porous carbon nanofibers (PCNF and CNF) were prepared and used as spacers to synthesise high surface area 2D graphene (G) prepared at 900 °C.199 In the typical synthesis, graphite powder was chemically modified through acidification in two steps to get oxidized graphite and on exfoliation and lyophilisation through the ultra-sonication process, the graphene oxide (GO) powder was obtained. The resulting GO powder was mixed with PCNF and CNF to obtain G-PCNF and G-CNF. The 2D graphene sheets were further functionalised by Pt to form Pt/G-PCNF and Pt/G-CNF through magnetic stirring and the Pt was reduced by refluxing, following the polyol reduction method. The difference between the porous and non-porous 2D graphene materials was demonstrated through the FESEM, where the G/PCNF showed a mesoporous structure and the rough surface of the porous material provided more active sites for the catalyst deposition. Like spacers, other bridging molecules were also used to bridge the graphene sheets. For example, the synthesis of porous carbon nanosheets by using asparagine, which is an amino acid and is used as a bridging molecule to connect the GO, and the electrostatically connected GO, which served as the structure directing agent to form porous nanosheets, was reported.200 The GO was also exfoliated into discrete sheets through ultrasound and the individual sheets were then converted into the 3D graphene composite (GN) by depositing Au nanoparticles and reduced by using PEG. The thus-prepared 3D-AuNPsGN had increased active surface area for electrochemical sensing of antibodies.201
It is well known that the multilayer graphene (MLG) has higher mechanical strength and at the same time has lesser properties compared to that of single layer graphene. With the objective of allowing a wide range of applications of MLGs, the MLG was combined with porous carbon (PC) through a CVD process to form hybrid MLG/PC core–shell films, where their structure was controlled by nickel gauze which was used as the template and their pore sizes were controlled by the CVD reaction time and by tuning the methane feeding rate. Since the hybrid MLG has both the characteristics of graphene and porous carbon, the film was able to maintain an intact structure of the material with MLG shell and PC core.306 Since the PC materials have shown tremendous advantage owing to their excellent structural and textural properties, Hongbo et al. prepared hybrid films by combining graphene with PC microspheres.202 They followed three conventional steps, namely reduction, leavening and compression, to fabricate the hybrid flexible porous film. The porous carbon microspheres moved between the pore walls of the flexible graphene nanosheet (GNS), prevented the stacking of the GNS and kept the open porous system in confinement facilitating electrochemical performance.
Although porous carbons are fascinating, they relatively have poor electrical conductivity. For example, CMK-3 has a poor electrical conductivity and cyclability compared to graphene. To combine the bright side of porous carbon (CMK-3) and graphene, in 2015 Nan et al. synthesised graphene based 2D porous carbon which was used as a support for the functionalization of Pt nanoparticles.203 In the following year, the same group demonstrated the functionalization of graphene based mesoporous carbon with Pd and SnO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 12. They used the SBA-15 silica template and graphene to prepare graphene mesoporous carbon (G-mC).204 By following the electroless plating method, Pd/SnO2 were introduced to the G-mC to form G-mC–Pd/SnO2. The metal functionalised porous graphene exhibited a decrease in the surface area and pore volume, suggesting that the Pd/SnO2 were located inside the pores of G-mC. This was confirmed by TEM images that show only a few large Pd and SnO2 nanoparticles found outside the surface of CMK-3. It was found that the particle size of the G-mC was close to the particle size of the Pd/SnO2 nanoparticles and was conductive compared to the CMK-3–Pd/SnO2.

Graphene oxide was also coated on the polyacrylonitrile derived porous carbon (PAN) that is rich in nitrogen and oxygen species. By heating the coated PAN (PAN/GO) followed by activation and washing with acid produced the final product. The oxygen present in the final product inhibited the graphene layer stacking and provided strong interactions between the sheets.205 A simplified strategy of synthesising graphene/porous carbon was reported earlier in 2015, where the CNT was coated with activated porous carbon (CNT@AC) and was used as a spacer dispatched in-between the graphene sheets (RGO/CNT@AC). The coated CNTs played a vital role in inhibiting the restacking of the graphene layers displaying a better electrochemical performance compared to that of pure CNT/graphene.206 The specific surface area was lower and the porous structure of the coated CNT was not controlled through this method. In another study, the restacking of graphene nanosheets was inhibited by adding highly ordered porous carbons prepared from SiO2 colloidal crystals with high specific surface area as a spacer. This simple approach not only helped to increase the specific surface area but also facilitated the diffusion of electrons in the hybrid nanostructures. Their fabrication process involved ultra-sonication of the PC and graphene oxide (GO) suspensions and after the hydrothermal process at 180 °C, graphene/porous carbon hydrogels were obtained. Interestingly these aerogels exhibited enhanced rate performance when compared with the individual GN and PC.305 Similar to the previous report, the pore structure of the graphene materials was simply controlled by assembling the graphene into a three-dimensional structure by hydrothermal treatment. The colloidal suspension was hydrothermally treated at 150 °C to produce a black graphene hydrogel. This was further impregnated with melted sulphur which was uniformly anchored to the graphene sheets. The porous structure thus produced was used as a model to study the influence of pores on electrochemical performances.207 The graphene treated with PC was also doped with nitrogen and activated by adding KOH via in situ polymerisation and was used as an anode.208 N-Doping was also done through the in situ carbonisation technique where glucose was mixed with GO to form RGO–HTC carbon on a large scale and was activated using NH3 to form nano-sandwich N-doped carbon materials (NNCMs)209 as shown in Fig. 13. Among the various NNCMs synthesised at 850, 900, 950 and 1050 °C, NNCMs prepared at 1050 °C exhibited a high surface of about 1959 m2 g−1.

5.5 Fullerene based porous carbons
Fullerenes are the purest form of carbons connected by hexagonal and pentagonal rings. The structure of fullerene differs from each other based on their number of carbon atoms or the number of hexagons and pentagons in the fullerene ring. The major difference between graphene and fullerene is that, the fullerenes have very high thermal and mechanical stability but have a very poor surface area and electrical conductivity. In contrast to fullerenes, graphene has very poor stability but has a high surface area and high electrical conductivity. However, the high symmetrical structure of fullerenes is unique compared to any other existing carbon materials so far, which provides opportunities to the scientific world to explore their structural properties for various applications. At the same time, the rigid structure of fullerenes could only be modified organically but due to its high thermal and mechanical stability, it is not very easy to fabricate it into a nanoporous fullerene structure. The rare reports on fullerene nanoporous carbons are discussed in this section.
Considering the effect of templating methods, Duncan et al. tried to self-assemble the fullerene by immobilising the fullerenes on the graphite surface, where the pores were generated by 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid to form a fullerene monolayer.210 Inspired by the concept of the self-assembling process, the single crystal C60 (FNR) and single crystal C60-nanotubes (FNT) were synthesised through the liquid–liquid interfacial precipitation technique. These nanostructures can be transformed into nanoporous carbon (HT-FNR and HT-FNT) with random graphitic nature after the high temperature and pressure treatment. Finally, to understand the structural transformation, theoretical calculations were applied. It was proved that high temperatures and pressures favor the formation and breaking of the interfullerene bonds which is the key for the transformation of 0D fullerene nanostructures into 2D graphitic nanostructures.211 The exfoliated graphite was used as a carbon adsorbent and the polycrystalline C60 powder was mixed along to be adsorbed by the exfoliated graphite. The adsorbed C60 on thermal treatment evaporated and the remaining particles were cold pressed.212 The porous carbon based on fullerene and graphite was studied for electrical, optical and various other properties. As one step further in the development of fullerene based porous carbon, Tan et al.213 activated the fullerene using KOH and doped the fullerene based porous carbon by nitrogen to form N–aC60 through thermal annealing as shown in Fig. 14A. Interestingly the surface area of the activated fullerene based porous carbon was 1457 m2 g−1 while that of the N-doped fullerene based porous carbon was 1274 m2 g−1. The nanoporous fullerene is a new area and the discussion on the fullerene based porous carbon signifies that a wide knowledge is necessary to understand the bonding nature between the self-assembled fullerenes. In addition, the polymerization between the solvent and the fullerene precursors and the formation of ordered porous structure in fullerene are yet unknown. Very recently, a striking report by Vinu et al. proved the successful fabrication of highly ordered mesoporous fullerene (Fig. 14B), with crystalline walls using nano-hard templating approach wherein 2D mesoporous silica, SBA-15 is used as a template and highly concentrated C60 solution in chlorinated naphthalene as a fullerene precursor. This simple strategy consists of the combination of several steps including high temperature collision of fullerenes in a nano-confined matrix, polymerization, cross-linking of fullerenes with the aromatic molecules and nanotemplating. It has been demonstrated that chlorinated naphthalene plays a key role here as it not only contributes the tight packing of the pores of the template but also helps to cross-link the C60 molecule at a high temperature. The prepared material showed excellent energy storage and conversion properties. This discovery is going to make a huge impact on the field of fullerene. We believe that this research would attract many researchers to work in this new area of research as they would be useful for a wide range of applications in the near future.214

5.6 Amine functionalised nanoporous carbon
Nanoporous carbons are unique due to their high surface area and large pore volume with highly ordered porous structure. Regardless of their excellent features, the strong hydrophobic nature of their surface highly hinders them from various applications like sensing, separation, physisorption and chemisorption, catalysis, etc. The hydrophobicity of these carbons can be tuned by functionalisation, especially with organic groups rather than using metal or metal oxides for functionalisation. In the following, the functionalization using amines is discussed, since amines have relatively high affinity to bond with carbon. So far, two main strategies such as grafting and impregnation have been adopted for introducing amines to the porous materials.
CMK-3 was functionalised by more than one amine group likely 1,2-diaminopropane, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane and o-phenylenediamine through C–N cross-coupling reaction. The aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic amines formed amide bonds on the surface of the CMK-3 material offering the catalytic sites to produce carbonyl compounds, without any destruction of the long-range ordering of the CMK-3 material.215 To increase the heterogenicity of the carbon, Zakova et al. used five different sources of amine to work on amine–amide combinations. The carbon nanoparticles (CNP) were modified with amides to manifest COOH groups and refluxed with SOCl2 to yield –COCl groups to start the reaction of CNP with amines.216 Although the XPS and Raman spectra confirmed the modification of the CNP surface with the expected bonding, the N2 adsorption–desorption showed a tremendous decrease in the surface area after the grafting process.217 Amine grafting was also carried out in porous polymeric networks,218 carbonaceous nanomaterials,219 porous carbon monoliths220 and MCM-41.
Among these amine functionalised materials, MCM-41 invigorated with carbon nanoparticles fetched bimodal porous structure to the resultant amine functionalised MCM-41 carbon material. The advantage of the bimodal porous structure to amine functionalisation is the increase in the adsorption phenomena.221 The trendy way of fabricating amine functionalised porous polymers222 and organic polymers223 which did not require any activation process was also reported. However, the cost was comparatively higher that limits the large-scale production.
5.7 Nanoporous carbon with metal nanoparticles from metal complexes
Metal complexes, generally known as coordination compounds, are complexes that form intermolecular bonds between the metal acting as an electron accepter and the ligand acting as an electron donor. The ligands are also termed as mono, di, tri, or poly-dentate depending on the number of electrons they donate. For instance, if the ligand donates more than one pair of electrons, the bonding between the metal ion and the ligand will be more stable. The ability of the porous carbons to allow the accessibility of small ions or metals due to their open channels makes them excellent candidates to fabricate nanoporous carbons with metal complexes.224
Copper(II) acetate225 and copper(II)/silver(I) carboxylates were immobilised in the nanoporous carbons and their combination was used to study the dihydrogen complexion.226 Foley et al. also reported the preparation of simple complexes of copper and silver loaded nanoporous carbon which showed highly selective adsorption of 1–3 mol of hydrogen per metal center. It was assumed that the cooperative interactions between hydrogen, the nanoporous structure, and the highly dispersed metal centers of the complexes in the mesochannels supported the enhancement of hydrogen adsorption.225 It was also reported that highly ordered nanoporous carbons with metal nanoparticles were prepared through a simple carbonization of the magnesium polyacrylate complex227 and benzoate metal complexes228 and exhibited a high specific surface area of ca 1050 m2 g−1. However, the surface area of the materials was significantly enhanced (1466.4 m2 g−1) when the composite was activated using KOH. By using the same carbonisation method, the cobalt ion absorbed polyaniline (PANI) was converted into the Co–C–N complex, which showed excellent electrocatalytic activity.73 The metal complex derived porous carbon was also functionalised with selenium and the selenium interacted with the metal complex porous framework through Se–O and C–O bonds.94
5.8 Protein functionalised nanoporous carbon
Biomolecules are organic molecules derived from living tissues composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen. Among the four class of biomolecules, namely carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, the proteins are of great interest due to their polymeric structure since they are natural heteropolymers containing the carboxyl group and the amino group connected by peptide bonds. But, the common drawback of proteins is their denaturation,229 physical instability and side reactions caused by the hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the importance of trapping the proteins for useful applications has been realized since centuries and various methods have been developed to serve the purpose. However, the approaches adopted so far to immobilise the proteins can be split into three categories, namely, immobilisation through covalent bonds, immobilisation through non-covalent bonds which includes hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and van der Waals interactions and finally encapsulation. Immobilisation can also be described as an adsorption process where a molecule can be entrapped or adsorbed on to a support through the three types of interactions mentioned above.
The nanoporous carbon can serve as an excellent substrate for the immobilisation of proteins230,231 owing to its high surface area, narrow pore size distribution and tuneable pore sizes that can be suitable for the proteins to entangle into the pores. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the nanoporous carbon protects the immobilised protein from solubility and various other factors like mechanical and thermal instability and can even cease the denaturation of proteins.232 The commercially available microporous carbon with small mesopores (Norit DLC super 50) was investigated for adsorption of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to inhibit the peptides233 and food protein234 and was monitored through the N2 adsorption desorption process. Likewise, two different types of aprotinin namely bovine serum albumin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor were adsorbed in an open structured hydrophobic carbon aerogel (C1) consisting of mesopores and their adsorption capacity was compared with that of the commercially available hydrophilic nanoporous carbon (C2) having higher surface area than C1. Interestingly, the C1 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for both the proteins. This clearly shows that the mesoporous carbon has a superior capacity over other porous carbons due to its pore size and allows the migration of the proteins inside the porous channels due to the hydrophobic nature of the carbon compared with the commercially available hydrophilic carbon which favors the agglomeration of proteins.235,236
Apart from immobilisation, proteins were also used as carbon precursors to fabricate 3D porous carbon237,238 and activated nanoporous carbon with a high surface area and different functional groups such as sulphur239 or metal oxides like MnO2240 to impose electrical conductivity. Since the proteins can be denatured easily by physical factors like pH, high temperature and acidic conditions, instead of proteins being used as carbon source, alternatively protein themselves were used as templates to fabricate mesoporous nanocrystals as shown in Fig. 15, wherein the mesoporous NaTiO2 (MNTP NC) was coated with BSA and was dispersed in the oxidised multiwalled carbon nanotube solution (MWCNTs). Finally, the MWCNT and MNTP NC were assembled through electrostatic interaction and thermally annealed to form MNTP/MWCNT film.241 This film exhibited a surface area of only 88.7 m2 g−1 with the typical type IV isotherm and it was found to be composed of 63 wt% MNTP and 30 wt% MWCNT.

In another report, the interaction of plasma or the blood proteins with graphitic carbon modified SBA-15 was also investigated and it was concluded that the graphitic domains influence the interactions of complex protein–nanoparticles.242 From the above reports on protein assisted templating methods, it could be noticed that the bare protein needs a templating substrate which otherwise would result in the collapse of the protein. Moreover, the proteins being used as a carbon precursor also have the major drawback of denaturation during the carbonisation process. As an alternate way, the hydrothermal method was employed to carbonise egg-protein using graphene nanosheets which play the role of template as well as catalyst. By this method, the protein can be avoided from any physical or chemical damage through the strong bonding between the GO and protein, which was further activated using KOH to yield a heteroatom doped highly porous carbon material.243
6. Applications of functionalized nanoporous carbon materials
As nanoporous carbons with different functional groups can offer interesting chemical and physical properties, these materials were effectively utilized for various applications.150,244,245 Many investigations have focused on the usage of functionalized nanoporous carbon materials for a range of potential applications including conventional Li-ion and post Li batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), fuel cell supports, hydrogen storage, CO2 capture and field emission devices. This is mainly due to the fact that these fascinating materials can offer highly ordered porous structures, high specific surface areas, large pore volumes and a uniform pore size distribution. In this section, we will address the importance of the functionalization of nanoporous carbons and how these functionalities and excellent properties can elevate the application possibilities in various fields.
6.1 Nanoporous carbon for sensing
The application of carbon based materials for sensing has been widely studied and the demand for selective sensing is changing day-by-day for various reasons including environmental monitoring and safety, medical diagnostics, etc. A majority of sensing materials exhibit high sensitivity, but high selectivity is the key and a new component that is now added as a trend to the sensing materials. The non-porous materials like graphene, carbon nanotubes and porous materials like activated carbon, etc. fall under the high sensitivity materials. On the other hand, the functionalized nanoporous materials can offer both high sensitivity and selectivity towards sensing which is discussed below.
The nanoporous carbon can be used for selective sensing by various methodologies like functionalising NC with metal or metal oxides, surface modification and doping, to sense the toxic gases, heavy metals, biomolecules, etc. The selective sensing of NH3 gas was performed by heteroatom doping by Travlou et al. where the interaction of NH3 with humidity (H2O) played a major role in sensing through hydrogen bonding and transport of proton through ionic conductivity.246 A similar sensing mechanism was followed to sense NH3 gas using the polymer derived nanoporous carbon. It was found that the weak interaction between the surface functional groups of nanoporous carbon and ammonia caused the protonation of NH3 to NH4+ that resulted in the electrochemical performance towards gas sensing.247 Travlou et al. also demonstrated that the doping of nanoporous carbon with N, S or O makes a great influence on their final sensing performance for toxic gases including ammonia and H2S as the functionalization has the ability to control the electronic and transport properties of the nanoporous carbons. It was reported that the reversible sensing of ammonia with a high selectivity can be achieved over the heteroatoms functionalized nanoporous carbons owing to their ability to generate superoxide ions that change the electrical signals due to the formation of charge carriers.248 The sensing of heavy metal ions249 and toxic chemicals like hydrogen peroxide250 was also studied by using nitrogen doped porous carbon and nanoporous carbon fibres. The ordered nanoporous carbon was also fabricated in a film form by Jia et al., who were successful in creating a high surface area with tunable pore sizes. These porous films exhibited enough space for the immobilisation of glucose oxidase that exhibited an excellent bio sensing performance at a detection limit of 1.5 mM,251 as shown in Fig. 16. The nanoporous carbon films with nickel for selectively sensing glucose were also demonstrated.252 Nanoporous carbon was also functionalized with copper to have an active surface area that showed enhanced sensitivity for the detection of biochemicals.253 Nanoporous carbons were also employed as sensors for selectively detecting various biomolecules like DNA bases, acids like ascorbic acid and uric acid, and NADH.254,255

6.2 Nanoporous carbon for drug delivery
The effective drug carrier/drug vehicle is the most demanding component in drug delivery applications. The addition of the specific targeting in the drug delivery system is also an important factor for deciding on the efficacy of the drug delivery system. Many carriers like nanoporous silica, polymers, micelles, nanotubes, nanoporous carbon, etc. have been employed for this purpose. However, the biocompatibility of these materials is still under research and recently the nanoporous carbon or the functionalised nanoporous carbons are of interest in the field of drug delivery.
Clarithromycin, a drug normally used for the treatment of tonsillitis, sinusitis and pharyngitis, causes side effects like swelling of mucosal tissues. In order to reduce the side effects of clarithromycin, the nanoporous carbon functionalised with amine groups was used as a carrier molecule (Fig. 17). It was reported that the amine modified nanoporous carbon was completely biocompatible.256 The nanoporous carbon derived from MOF was also examined through cytotoxicity assay and the narrow pore size distribution was found to be suitable for the controlled release of cisplatin.257 The dissolution and the poor solubility of the valsartan drug in water was also addressed by Zhang et al., who used porous carbon monoliths possessing ordered macropores and uniform mesopores of about 5.2 nm as a drug carrier.258 It has been reported that the material exhibited a higher release rate compared with the pure valsartan.

6.3 Nanoporous carbon for catalysis
The increasing demand in the consumption of fossil fuels has almost depleted the fossil fuel sources; hence renewable energy sources must be found and developed to prevent the environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels and to mitigate greenhouse gasses. As an alternate source, many renewable energy sources are emerging and being developed with the aim of replacing the depleting sources. Among them, the hydrogen fuel is a blooming area in catalysis due to its non-toxic nature, fast recharging ability and high stability. To produce hydrogen, two well-known pathways have been used, namely dehydrogenation and dehydration. However, the latter pathway gives out the toxic carbon monoxide (CO), which is highly dangerous to the environment and immense control should be taken during the production of hydrogen. The main problem persisting in the field of catalysis is the separation of the product and the reusability of catalysts. Hence, it is necessary to fabricate efficient heterogeneous catalysts which are highly cooperative with the reaction temperature and the pH of the reaction medium.
The synthesis of nanoporous carbon deposited with Pd nanoparticles to synthesise heterogeneous catalysts with the strategy of sodium hydroxide assisted reduction was reported by Zhu et al. Sodium hydroxide was used here for the reason of uniform dispersion of the metal on the surface of the nanoporous carbon and the reduction assisted by sodium hydroxide resulted in the generation of hydrogen from formic acid decomposition without the CO side reaction. Interestingly, the turnover frequency (TOF) was 2623 h−1 with 100% hydrogen selectivity,259 as shown in Fig. 18. The N-doped nanoporous carbon was also surface functionalised with the AgPd zeolite framework for the decomposition of formic acid and the TOF reported was 936 h−1 at 353 K.260 These two reports clearly showed the advantage of nanoporous carbon over the zeolite framework decorated with nanoporous carbon. Oxidation had a key role in the surface modification of the nanoporous carbons. Velasco et al. demonstrated that the oxygen functional groups on the surface of nanoporous carbons can enhance the photoelectrochemical conversion of light inside the pores. The enhancement in the photoactivity is due to the surface active oxygen groups which favor the splitting of the exciton in the nanoconfined space and its efficient use in photochemical reactions.261

6.4 Nanoporous carbon in adsorption and separation
Adsorption is the most conventional application of nanoporous carbon compared to various other applications of nanoporous carbon owing to its high surface area and tunable and uniform pore size distribution. Despite the advantage of the nanoporosity, apparently, the purification process which is otherwise called separation remains a difficult task so far. Hence, there is a clear need for developing advanced nanostructures for the efficient adsorption and separation applications.
The neonicotinoid insecticides extracted from water and fatmelon samples by the magnetic MOF derived nanoporous carbon was reported by Hao et al.262 In their typical synthesis, the magnetic nanoporous carbon was prepared by one step direct carbonisation of ZIF-67 and the embedded Co nanoparticles offered the magnetic property to the material which could demonstrate the adsorption and removal of insecticides through liquid chromatography. Mesoporous carbon derived from MOF was also reported later for the separation of CO2 and CH4 from the mixture.263 On the other hand, the magnetic mesoporous carbon (Ni–CMK-3) was also reported for the adsorption and removal of sulfur from oil264 and the pure CMK-3 with a high surface area of 1268 m2 g−1 was employed for the adsorption and recovery of 2-phenylethanol which is a rose oil component.265 Following the use of mesoporous carbon in adsorption and separation, Ma et al. functionalised nanoporous carbon with highly uniform MgO nanoparticles through the EISA process for the separation of methanol. The largest adsorption capacity of 11.90 mmol g−1 was observed.266 Perreault et al. functionalised and grafted mesoporous carbon with diglycolyl chloride (DGCI) and N,N1-bis-chloropropyl diglycolamide (CI-PDGA) to form CMK-8–DGO and CMK-8–PDGA. These two grafted CMK-3 materials were used as adsorbents to study the adsorption of lanthanides. Although both the components showed a type IV isotherm, at lower pH the CMK-8–DGO exhibited excellent reusability of Ln (Fig. 19).267

An interesting report on the role of different pore structures in the adsorption and separation of CO2 from the mixture of CO2 and hydrogen was presented by Kumar et al. The molecular stimulation studies clearly showed that adsorption and separation were quite sensitive to the pore structure and the composition of nanoporous carbon nanostructures. It was found that the porous carbon with a tube like structure was the best for the highly selective adsorption of CO2 molecules from the CO2 and hydrogen mixture. Although nanoporous carbons with slit, foam like and random porous structure showed adsorption the selectivity was much inferior to that of porous carbon with tube like structures.268
6.5 Nanoporous carbon for batteries
Modified nanoporous carbon materials have been extensively utilized as electrode materials in the lithium ion and post Li-ion batteries such as Li–S, Na-ion and Na–S batteries owing to their superior textural properties together with high conductivity and stability. Duan et al. reported on the usage of Sn nanoparticle incorporated mesoporous carbon as an anode material for Li-ion batteries.178 The charge/discharge voltage curves observed for nano-Sn/mesoporous carbon showed a typical sloping voltage profile associated with lithium alloying–dealloying with nano-sized Sn in the sample. The initial columbic efficiency was 60%, which was calculated according to the discharge capacity of 1246 mA h g−1 and charge capacity of 747 mA h g−1. The columbic efficiency increases to 85% during the 2nd cycle, to 90% in the 3rd cycle, and to above 97% after 7 cycles. Urchin-like Fe3O4@C–N composites displayed an excellent electrochemical performance with a reversible specific capacity of 800 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 500 mA h g−1 in the 0.01–3 V voltage range at room temperature.194 This significant electrochemical performance of urchin-like Fe3O4@C–N composites was attributed to the unique urchin-like structure and the N-doped mesoporous carbon shell.
Shen et al. have used mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C nanocomposites as an anode material in Li ion batteries. The cyclic voltammetry curve of the mesoporous Li4Ti5O12/C electrode at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 and at a potential window of 1.0–2.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) showed a pair of well-defined redox peaks at 1.65/1.50 V, which was attributed to the redox reaction of Ti4+/Ti3+, respectively.192 These features revealed that the nanocomposite electrode had fast lithium ion insertion and extraction kinetics that was attributed to the highly ordered mesoporous structure with enhanced electrical conductivity. The Li4Ti5O12/C nanocomposite possessed superior cycling stability performance of more than 1000 cycles at the discharge capacity of 103.1 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 20C with only 5.6% capacity loss (Fig. 20E and F). Tan et al. reported that the N-doped mesoporous carbon-capped MoO2 nanobelts (MoO2@NC) electrode delivered high first-cycle discharge and charge capacities of 942.3 and 690.7 mA h g−1, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 73.3%. In the second cycle, the CE of the anode sample increased to 94.6%, indicating a good lithium ion insertion/extraction performance during the cycling process. The discharge capacity of the MoO2@NC electrode remained at 692.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current of 0.5 A g−1.197

Sun et al. also demonstrated that the Se2S6/NMC electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1195 mA h g−1, which was almost close to the theoretical capacity of 1226 mA h g−1 for Se2S6. They also registered excellent cycling stability and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96.5% as well as a high reversible capacity of 883 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and 780 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 250 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 20C and D).198 HNMC material prepared from honey showed a superior performance towards the Li ion battery with a reversible capacity of 1359 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and excellent rate capability and cycling stability of 722 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 20A and B). The same material demonstrated the initial discharge and charge capacities of 977 and 427 mA h g−1, respectively, for the Na ion battery.58
Liang et al. have investigated the performance of the mesoporous nanocomposite by using N-OMC/SiO2 as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the N-OMC/SiO2 nanocomposite electrode were measured to be as high as 3900 and 1996 mA h g−1, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency of 51%. The discharge capacity retained a large value of 740 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which was about two times higher than the theoretical value of graphite.93 TiO2 supported on nitrogen-doped carbon foams (NCFs) were also used as a free-standing and flexible electrode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). When TiO2–NCF was directly used as a flexible electrode in a LIB, a capacity of 188 mA h g−1 was achieved at a current density of 200 mA g−1 under a potential window of 1.0–3.0 V, and a specific capacity of 149 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g−1 was maintained.269 The addition of sulphur into the NOMCs can help these nanostructures to be used in Li–S battery applications. Qu et al. reported on the preparation of the sulfur–HNMC composite with 53.3 wt% sulphur by a melt-diffusion method for high rate capability and long cycling stability cathode materials in Li–S batteries.270 The S–HNMC composite cathode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1209 mA h g−1 and retained as high as 600 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1C. Chen et al. reported on the usage of the NM–CMK-3/S composite with 50 wt% sulfur in the Li–S battery, which showed a high initial capacity of ca. 950 mA h g−1, 100% Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention ratio of 80% (750 mA h g−1) after 100 cycles with a decay of only 0.2% per cycle.139 The high performance was attributed to the presence of microporosity and nitrogen contents which provided synergetic effects. These results explained the importance of having nitrogen on the surface of the carbon walls for energy storage applications.
Balach et al. described a high initial discharge capacity of 1364 mA h g−1 at 0.2C for the NOMC/S composite with 50 wt% sulfur. The composite material also showed extremely high cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 566 mA h g−1 and a negligible degradation rate of 0.037% after 1200 cycles at 0.5C.145 Liu et al. demonstrated that the S/CPAN-800 composite was an excellent material for Li–S cells, which delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1585 mA h g−1 and an enhanced capacity retention of 862 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of around 100%. These results greatly outperformed the S/CMK-3 composite cell without nitrogen doping, which maintained only 400 mA h g−1 capacity at 0.1C after 100 cycles.271 The enhanced performance was attributed to nitrogen doping combined with sulphur, which significantly improved the wettability of the electrolyte and the conductivity of the electrode. These results reveal the importance of doping of dual heteroatoms in the carbon framework structure of NOMCs.
6.6 Nanoporous carbon for carbon capture and storage
Global warming leading to drastic climatic changes due to the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere added through various anthropogenic sources is inevitably one of the major environment crises of our times.272,273 There is an urgent need for developing materials and technologies to combat the dangerous emissions of CO2 from industrial sectors such as power generation plants, cement production, petrochemical production, aluminium, steel and plastic manufacturing industries, etc. Carbon based materials, especially ordered mesoporous carbon-based adsorbents with highly developed textural parameters, are regarded as a potential solution to tackle the problem of industrial CO2 emission. Two key parameters required for efficient CO2 capture by an adsorbent include high specific surface area and the presence of nitrogen containing functional groups on the surface of carbon.274 Several reports can be found in the literature for increasing the surface area of different kinds of carbons using chemical activation.275,276 However, this procedure might not be suitable for ordered carbons as it may result in deformation of the order and affect the properties of the carbon. A few ordered mesoporous carbons are discussed below to ascertain the role they can play in capturing CO2.
Wang et al. synthesized ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 through the hard templating procedure using SBA-15 as a template for CO2 capture.277 They reported a surface area of 1115 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.11 cm3 g−1 and the material adsorbed 42 mmol g−1 of CO2 under high-pressure conditions (36 bar). It is to be noted this much high CO2 uptake was observed using CMK-3 preabsorbed with water that decreased to 18.5 mmol g−1 with dry CMK-3. The heat of adsorption was observed to be 55 kJ mol−1, which indicates strong physisorption between CMK-3 and CO2.
As previously discussed, the textural properties of the OMCs were significantly improved after the activation with KOH. Especially, the quantity of the micropores can be significantly enhanced after the activation. Bao et al. reported that the presence of ultra micropores of size <0.5 nm is a critical factor for enhancing the CO2 adsorption and CO2/N2 selectivity of the nitrogen doped hierarchical carbon derived from polypyrrole.278 They compared the CO2 adsorption statistics for N-doped carbons made at 500 °C and 800 °C and even though the latter had a significantly high surface area, it still showed a relatively smaller amount of CO2 adsorption, which defies the common theory that high surface area leads to high CO2 adsorption. Eventually, a low temperature carbonization to protect the widening of ultra micropores and retention of nitrogen containing functional groups was concluded as one of the most critical parameters for a high CO2 adsorption.
6.7 Electrocatalysis
Heteroatom and non-precious foreign element doped carbon nanomaterials are considered as the low cost and highly efficient electrocatalytic alternatives to the commercial platinum (Pt) based electrocatalysts. Among the doped carbon nanomaterials, nanoporous carbon materials modified with B, N, S, P and non-precious elements are more attractive electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this section, we will summarize the role of structure, morphology and the single or dual heteroatom doping in the OMCs in affecting the final electrocatalytic performance of these materials.

6.7.1 Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). 
ORR is a key process in the fuel cells (FCs) for generating electricity by electrochemical reduction of oxygen and oxidation of hydrogen by production of water as the by-product. The most suitable electrocatalyst for ORR is the platinum (Pt) based electrodes. However, the scarcity and the high cost of Pt are the primary barriers to commercialize the Pt based electrocatalyst for fuel cells. Apart from the high cost, the Pt-based electrode also suffers from susceptibility to fuel crossover and CO poisoning under electrochemical conditions. Therefore, numerous efforts have been devoted to seeking alternative non-platinum ORR electrocatalysts for FCs with a low cost and a high ORR activity. In this part, we review the latest advances in the fabrication of electrocatalysts based on the doped and functionalized nanoporous carbon materials. Choi et al. demonstrated that the additional doping of B and/or P in the nitrogen doped nanoporous carbon can enhance the asymmetry of atomic spin density and improve the ORR catalytic activity.279 The ORR activity of the B,N-doped and P,N-doped nanoporous carbon was 1.2 and 2.1 times higher than that of N-doped nanoporous carbons at 0.6 V (vs. RHE) in acidic media. The nanoporous nitrogen doped carbon catalyst incorporated with both B and P (BPNDC) showed the best ORR activity of 2.3 times higher than NDC at 0.6 V (vs. RHE), which records −6.0 mA mg−1 of mass activity (Fig. 21A and B).279,280

NOMC prepared from honey and glucose/ammonia precursors exhibited a significantly lower potential at −0.23 V as well as a sharply increased peak current towards the ORR. The apparent number of electrons involved in ORR for NOMC-800 prepared at 800 °C is close to 4-electrons, according to the Koutecky–Levich equation. This indicates that the oxygen reduction follows mainly the four-electron pathway either by reducing oxygen directly to OH− ions or by reducing it to hydrogen peroxide which is subsequently further reduced to OH− ions.57,98,161
NOMCs synthesized via a facile dual soft-templating procedure showed the most positive onset potential (−0.11 V) and the highest reaction current density at a certain overpotential, suggesting the fastest reaction kinetics via close to four electron reaction pathway with higher limiting current density.90,99,101 NOMC materials prepared from pyrrole or aminopyridine and Fe catalyst outperformed the Pt counterpart and the performance was significantly improved by increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 800 to 1000 °C.67,281 Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (NMCNs) fabricated from the thermal treatment of polyaniline enwrapped cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) nanosheets followed by the subsequent acid etching manifested an excellent ORR performance with an onset potential of −0.119 V, a half-wave potential of −0.182 V and a limiting current density of 5.06 mA cm−2. These values were comparable to the commercial Pt/C (−0.164 V and 5 mA cm−2).282
A nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon containing a network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) also showed an excellent ORR activity, with 59 mV more positive onset potential and 30 mV more positive half-wave potential than a Pt/C catalyst, and also much longer durability and stronger tolerance to methanol crossover than a Pt/C catalyst.283 Highly ordered N-doped mesoporous carbon/graphene frameworks (N-MCF/N-MGF) prepared by using the super lattice of self-assembled Fe3O4 nanoparticles as template showed a 47 mV positive shift in the half-wave potential and higher current densities compared with the Pt/C (2.24 and 0.74 mA cm−2), demonstrating their superior ORR activity compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst.284
Park et al. showed the ORR catalytic activity of NOMC materials, which demonstrated high selectivity toward H2O2 over 90%. At 0.1 V, NOMC exhibited a ring current of 0.148 mA, which corresponds to H2O2 formation at a rate of 3.06 pmol s−1.62 Chen et al. also observed a well-defined oxygen reduction peak at 0.68 V (vs. RHE) in the CV curve under O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution for NHPCM prepared by using a N-doped hierarchically porous silica monolith template and furfuryl alcohol as the carbon source. The number of electrons involved in ORR for NHPCM is in the range of 3.7 to 3.9 indicating that an intrinsic four-electron pathway is the dominant mechanism. No significant change was observed in the ORR current density of the NHPCM electrode after MeOH was added into the electrochemical cell, suggesting that it has remarkably improved ability to avoid the crossover effects.65
Sulfur doped OMCs such as OMC-S-1, OMC-S-2 and OMC-S-3 having sulphur contents in the range of 1.4 to 1.5 wt% exhibited higher currents of 238.0, 282.3 and 376.4 μA, during the ORR, which are higher than that of the unmodified OMC electrode. The number of electrons calculated for ORR on OMC-S-3 were 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.8 at different potentials, which indicates that OMC-S-3 typically provides a four-electron transfer pathway for ORR.113 Yang et al. observed an ORR peak at −0.19 V for P doped well-ordered mesoporous carbon (POMC), which confirmed the excellent electrocatalytic activity of POMC for oxygen reduction.
POMC also exhibited high catalytic activity for ORR with an extraordinary selectivity for oxygen to evade the crossover effects of methanol and thereby outperformed the commercial Pt/VC electrode. For the Pt/VC catalyst, a very strong peak at −0.18 and −0.21 V was observed for methanol oxidation in the CV curve, whereas the cathodic ORR peak vanished. In contrast, no noticeable change was observed in the oxygen-reduction current on the POMC electrode.107,285 Boron doped ordered mesoporous carbons (BOMCs) were also employed for ORR. These catalysts exhibited a substantial ORR cathodic peak at around −0.27 V. The maximum peak current density on BOMCs was −1.46 mA cm−2, whereas unmodified OMCs and Pt/C registered maximum peak current densities of −0.84 and −0.97 mA cm−2, respectively.103 The BOMC electrode showed a significant onset potential shift towards the positive side to −0.16 V with the limiting diffusion current density at −0.80 V, which is about 1.7 times stronger than that of undoped OMC catalysts. The number of electrons that participated in the ORR for the BOMC electrode at −0.50 V was found to be 3.86 and this increased to 4 at more negative potentials, indicating that oxygen reduction follows mainly the four-electron pathway either by reducing oxygen directly to OH− ions or by reducing it to peroxide which is subsequently further reduced to OH− ions. S and N dual doped ordered mesoporous carbon (SN-OMC) materials were also successfully employed for ORR applications. It was found that the dual doping helped to enhance the ORR electrocatalytic activity (−0.186 V) in alkaline media with desirable current density, methanol tolerance and long-term stability. The number of electrons involved for SN-OMC during the ORR ranges from 3.93 to 3.95, very close to 4.0, indicating that it favoured a four-electron ORR process.111,112
The ORR onset-potential (1.01 V), E1/2 value (0.86 V), and current density (9.6 mA cm−2) of the Fe–N-GC electrode prepared by heating 2,2-bipyridine and Fe chelates at 900 °C with 0.2 mg cm−2 loading were higher and larger than the values obtained on the commercial Pt/C-JM electrode with 20 μgPt cm2 loading and the previously reported NPMCs with 0.3–0.4 mg cm−2 loading in 0.1 M KOH solution. These results indicated its superior catalytic activity in alkaline medium (Fig. 21C and D).181,182 Ultra fine Fe2N nanocrystals incorporated in mesoporous nitrogen doped graphitic carbon spheres (Fe2N/MNGCS) were also utilized for ORR applications. The catalysts demonstrated a half-wave potential of 0.881 V vs. RHE, high selectivity towards the 4e− oxygen reduction process, excellent long-term stability with 95.2% of the initial current retention after 60000 s of continuous operation and good tolerance against the methanol crossover effect (94.9% of the current remained prior to 4.0 M methanol injection in alkaline media). This performance was much superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst.286 Pt nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped porous carbon microspheres (Pt/CN) demonstrated ultrahigh ORR activity at a pH of 8.4 with a mass activity and specific activity of 564 mA mg−1 Pt and 834 mA cm−2 Pt, respectively, which may have been due to the presence of an appropriate amount of N atoms doped into the nanoporous carbon matrix.177 Pt nanoparticles on N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon–Co composites (Pt/Co–N-OMC) displayed the mixed kinetic diffusion current between 0.48 and 0.75 V with the highest onset potential at ∼0.72 V in an oxygen saturated 0.5 mol l−1 H2SO4 electrolyte at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and they also exhibited the highest limiting current and onset potential.287
Hollow graphitic carbon spheres with Fe–N-doped mesoporous shells (FeNCSs) prepared via in situ polymerization exhibited very superior ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.886 V in 0.1 M KOH, 15 mV more positive than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts.288 Liang et al. elucidated the four-electron reduction performance of oxygen in 0.5 M H2SO4 at room temperature by using cobalt–nitrogen-doped (C–N–Co) and iron–nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon (C–N–Fe), prepared from vitamin B12 (VB12) and the polyaniline–Fe (PANI–Fe) complex. Among all of the catalysts, C–N–Co fabricated from VB12 and silica nanoparticles exhibited a remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.79 V, which is only ∼58 mV deviation from Pt/C, and further demonstrated the high selectivity of the four electron pathway, and excellent electrochemical stability up to 10000 cycles.180
Mesoporous Fe10@NOMC catalyst prepared from a ferrocene-based ionic liquid was also utilized for ORR. The results showed that the catalyst exhibited a comparable onset potential and half-wave potential (0 V vs. MMO) for the Pt/C and close values to the Fe/Fe3C–melamine/N-KB composite but superior long-term stability compared to 20 wt% Pt/C in identical test conditions for ORR with the four-electron transfer pathway under alkaline conditions. The Fe10@NOMC catalyst showed perfect ORR selectivity in a methanol containing electrolyte, whereas a significantly high methanol oxidation current was detected for the Pt/C catalyst under the same conditions.183 Fe3O4 embedded into nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (Fe3O4/NMCS) with an iron content of 3.35 wt% was used as a robust catalyst for the ORR in alkaline media. It showed excellent electrochemical performance in terms of a more positive onset potential of 1.036 V vs. RHE, a half-wave potential of 0.861 V and much better methanol tolerance and long-term durability, in comparison with that of 20% Pt/C.289
Three-dimensionally (3D) ordered mesoporous Fe–N/C fabricated from the soft templating approach manifested high onset potential (1.018 V), half-wave potential (0.812 V) and limited-diffusion current density (5.98 mA cm−2) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The number of transferred electrons (n) was calculated to be 4.08–4.20 between 0.40 and 0.60 V for mesoporous Fe–N/C, confirming the dominant 4e− oxygen reduction mechanism.290 Cobalt–nitrogen-doped three-dimensionally (3D) ordered macro-/mesoporous carbons (Co–N-OMMCs) prepared from the dual-templating synthesis approach exhibited a highly positive ORR half-wave potential of ∼0.83 V vs. RHE, which is only ∼0.01 V deviation from the Pt/C catalyst (∼0.84 V vs. RHE). The catalysts also provided a higher diffusion-limited current density than commercial Pt/C, indicating a large quantity of exposed active sites on the Co–N-OMMC. The number of electrons involved in the ORR for Co–N-OMMC was calculated to be 3.9 at 0.5 V vs. RHE, revealing that the Co–N-OMMC favoured a 4e− oxygen reduction process and O2 was reduced to OH−, which is the same with Pt/C catalyst. The chronoamperogram of Co–N-OMMC showed negligible performance attenuation even after 25 h of continuous operation at 0.5 V vs. RHE, in contrast to a sharp activity loss of commercial Pt/C, demonstrating the high stability of Co–N-OMMC for ORR.187

6.8 Nanoporous carbon for supercapacitance
Supercapacitors, which are also known as electrochemical capacitors, provide a high power density (>10 kW kg−1), a fast charge/discharge process (within seconds) and long cycling life (>105 cycles).291,292 Nanoporous carbon based materials are considered as attractive electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their extremely high specific surface areas, large pore volumes and pore diameters, in combination with the simple synthesis processing, non-toxicity and high chemical stability. There have been quite a number of review articles reported on this topic.291–293 Therefore, in this review, recent developments in the utilization of these nanostructures for supercapacitor applications for the past five years are reviewed. In 2015, Lin et al. successfully used N-doped mesoporous few-layer carbon with a large surface area of 1900 m2 g−1 for supercapacitor applications. It was reported that the materials showed the highest ever specific capacitance of 810 F g−1 and 710 F g−1 and volumetric capacity of 560 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 and 2 M Li2SO4 electrolyte using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode.56 The electrochemical cell withstood the capacity for 50000 cycles between 0 and 1.2 V. The device also demonstrated the highest specific energy of 23.0 W h kg−1 and a specific power density of 18.5 kW kg−1 based on the device weight in a 2 M Li2SO4 electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that OMFLC-N has the lowest equivalent series resistance of ∼0.8 ohms, better than that of OMFLC without N doping and CMK-3 (Fig. 22). Wei et al. reported on the supercapacitor device fabrication by using rich nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon, which showed the specific capacitances of 262 F g−1 (in H2SO4) and 227 F g−1 (in KOH) at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and 244 F g−1 (in H2SO4) and 213 F g−1 (in KOH) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, which are much better than that for the mesoporous carbon FDU-15 without any nitrogen content (110–130 F g−1).87 These results revealed that the coating of nitrogen doped carbon on the surface of the support was much more effective than the bulk NOMSs in the supercapacitor applications.

The nitrogen doped hierarchically porous carbon nets exhibited a high specific capacitance of 537.3 F g−1 and 306.3 F cm−3 at 0.5 A g−1 current density in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The material also presented an outstanding cycling stability with 98.8% retention of their initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1.164 NOMC prepared from phenol–urea–formaldehyde exhibited a specific capacitance of 225 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and it showed good electrochemical stability even after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g−1.92
Microporosity has been introduced in the NOMCs via activation and other techniques to enhance the specific capacitance of the materials. Liu et al. reported on the enhanced supercapacitor performance of activated NOMC electrode materials with a mass loading of ∼3 mg cm−2 which yielded a high specific capacitance of 186 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1 and a good capacitance retention of 75% at a high discharge current density of 20 A g−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte. Increasing the mass loading to ∼12 mg cm−2 gave rise to only a 10% capacitance decay at 20 A g−1.159 Almeida et al. demonstrated that the NMC-T material showed a specific capacitance of 190.2 F g−1 and retained 73% of its capacitance when the current density was increased from 0.5 to 8.0 A g−1. In addition, the specific capacitance of NMC-T materials was retained up to 98% of their stored charges or initial capacitance after 1000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2.0 A g−1.66 NOMCs prepared via the aqueous cooperative assembly route demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 186 F g−1 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1 and a good capacitance retention of 75% at a high discharge current density of 20 A g−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte.159
Nitrogen-doped micro-mesoporous carbon material exhibited a reversible specific capacitance of 226.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte and 75.5% of its initial capacity could be retained after 2000 cyclic tests.137 A maximum capacitance of 237 F g−1 was reached for the NOMC prepared by using an ionic liquid precursor at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. The specific energy of a cell made from two identical NOMC electrodes was more than 83 W h kg−1 (unpackaged) for 1100 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, which corresponds to a specific energy of 25 W h kg−1 in a commercial-style, packaged device, which typically contains 30 wt% active material.81
Hierarchically mesoporous carbons with different boron contents (from 0.42 to 2.37 wt%) showed a specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 in H2SO4 aqueous solution at a current density of 1 A g−1.106 Sun et al. described an advanced supercapacitor material based on nitrogen doped porous graphitic carbon (NPGC), which showed an excellent capacitive behaviour with a specific capacitance of 293 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, long-term cycling stability at about 5000 cycles, and high coulombic efficiency in a KOH electrolyte.96 Tang et al. implemented a supercapacitor device by using NHPC-3D having 8.2 wt% nitrogen functionalities as the active electrode material, which exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 252 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The device also showed a high capacitance retention of 75.7% with a specific capacitance of 190 F g−1 at a higher current density of 20 A g−1.73 A NOMC material demonstrated a reversible specific capacitance of 308 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 in an aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte with 58% capacity retention of 131 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1.97 Song et al. depicted that the NMMC electrode has a high specific capacitance of 325 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 in an aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte.76 Xu et al. demonstrated that a microsphere-like nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon/nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxide (NMC/NiCo-LDHs-M) composite displayed a high specific capacitance of 272.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an outstanding electrochemical capacitance retention of 87.2% of initial capacitance even after 10000 cycles.101
OMCs derived from zeolite based templates have been employed as electrodes for supercapacitor applications owing to their better specific surface area and small pores. Kyotani et al. studied the supercapacitance performance of zeolite templated B and N doped ordered microporous carbon (N-ZTC) materials by using zeolite Y as a template. Among the materials prepared, N-ZTC demonstrated a high capacitance of 180 F g−1 in a 1 M TEABF4/PC electrolyte.294 Amoros et al. reported on the fabrication of thin films of zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) on a carbon current collector by the combination of chemical and electrochemical synthesis protocols.295 FAU nanozeolites were deposited by an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique from colloidal suspensions on porous carbon discs. Binderless continuous thin films of ZTC were materialized by subjecting the resulting composites to chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of acetylene gas followed by HF washing. The prepared thin ZTC layers show area capacitance values over 12 mF cm−2, which is one of the best value for electrodes in microcapacitors. The functional groups on these microporous carbons play a huge role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the ZTCs. For example, Kyotani et al. also reported on the large pseudocapacitance (330 F g−1) of electrochemically oxygen functionalized zeolite template carbon (ZTC) in an organic electrolyte.296 The formation of anion and cation radicals of oxygen functionalities offers pseudocapacitance which is responsible for the enhancement of the total specific capacitance of the functionalized ZTC. These results provide clear evidence that the functionalization of the ZTC is one of the key elements and can be used for tuning the electrochemical performance of ZTC.
Linnemann et al. demonstrated simplifying the supercapacitor electrode fabrication process through the electrodeposition of the carbonized metal organic framework (MOF) based films on the current collector.297 The MOF films are well attached to the metal substrate during the carbonization process under an argon atmosphere forming highly electrochemically active Co3O4/C and Mn3O4/C hybrid materials. At the 50th cycle, the integral capacitance of the Mn3O4/C bilayered system was 160 F g−1 referring to Mn, 116 F g−1 referring to Mn3O4 and 102 F g−1 referring to MnO2 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. This value is superior to the Mn3O4/graphene material reported by Lee et al.298
Fransaer et al. reported on the preparation of mesoporous layered Ni–Co mixed metal oxide–carbon composite electrodes on the Ni foam by using Ni–Co mixed metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with the above mentioned method.299 This electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 2098 mF cm−2 and a superior rate performance of 93% from 1 to 20 mA cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. These are the best methods for the fabrication of efficient supercapacitor electrodes using MOF derived carbons which do not require any additional processing steps or templates.
N- and O functional groups containing nanoporous carbon derived from the zeolite template showed a large pseudo-capacitance of 312.4 F g−1 in a H2SO4 electrolyte and it can operate at 1.2 V in H2SO4 with a good durability beyond 4000 cycles.300 Wang et al. demonstrated that the NOMC materials can have the specific capacitances of 76 F g−1 and 21 F g−1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, which was measured by the galvanic charge and discharge process.86 The diffusive resistances (RD) of NOMC electrodes are 0.7 and 1.3 ohm, respectively. The specific capacitance of nitrogen and sulphur doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NSOMC) reached 180 F g−1 in KOH aqueous solution at a current density of 1 A g−1, with approximately 39.5% enhancement over CMK-3, despite the fact that the specific surface area of NSOMC is only about 70% of the CMK-3.110 NOMC material with a nitrogen content of 6.7 wt% showed a high capacitance of 264 F g−1 in a 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a good rate capability with a capacitance retention of 226 F g−1 at 10 A g−1. The NOMC electrode also delivered an excellent cycling stability without capacitance fading over 10000 cycles.59 Ling et al. demonstrated that NOMC prepared by using the PDA precursor exhibited a high specific capacitance of 538 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. NOMC material delivered a large capacitance of 186 F g−1 at a high current density of 3 A g−1. The NONC supercapacitor electrode retained more than 93% of the initial capacitance even after 5000 cycles, exhibiting excellent cycling stability.60 A graphitic ordered mesoporous carbon (G-OMC) prepared from DA and NiO template showed a specific capacitance of 183 F g−1 and 68 μF cm−2 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1.61 Although the N and NiO functionalities were there in the samples, they registered poor specific capacitance which might be attributed to the low specific surface area of the prepared samples.
Nitrogen- and sulfur-codoped 3D cubic ordered mesoporous carbon (KNOMC) with controlled dopant content (10.0–4.6% for nitrogen and 0.94–0.75% for sulfur) demonstrated a specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in a 2 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. However, the specific capacitance decreased quickly during the first 10 cycles, but the specific capacitance remained at almost 100.0% during the 20–1000th cycles. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance reached 247 F g−1.301 NOMCs with a high surface area of 1741 m2 g−1 and nitrogen content up to 15 wt% exhibited a specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a good rate capability of 175 F g−1 at 20 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 77.4% in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.78 These results revealed that the optimum amount of N and S together with the excellent surface area and structural order is the key to obtain high specific capacitance for the samples.
Nitrogen and phosphorus dual doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NPOMC) demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 220 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, a good rate capability of 178 F g−1 at 16 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 81% and an excellent cycling stability of 91% in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.171 This value was lower than the N and S doped or N and O doped NOMCs. Hierarchically nitrogen doped ordered mesoporous carbons (HNMC) synthesized from polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes (POSS) demonstrated a nearly ideal rectangular shaped CV in a wide voltage window from −2 to 2 V. These HNMC materials showed a gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitance of 163 F g−1 and 106 F cm−3 at a current density of 0.25 A g−1 in an ionic liquid electrolyte and also showed a slow capacitance decay with the increase of discharge rates, in particular, at 20 A g−1. They also showed a high capacity of 141 F g−1 with 89% capacitance retention.162 Binder free supercapacitor electrodes based on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon microfibers (NMCMFs) exhibited a specific capacity of 189 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, an excellent rate capability of 107 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1 and durability (maintained over 96% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles) in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.163 All these results revealed that optimized doping and the structural control of OMCs are the key to fabricate the best electrode system for energy storage applications. Ultimately, this information could be used for the design of the best energy storage system with a considerable cost reduction by adopting necessary low-cost modification of OMCs.
6.9 Carbon nanomaterial based pathogen sensors
Carboxyl modified carbon dots prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of citric acid combined with amine based aptamer formed a very effective CD–aptamer complex which provided a very fast and sensitive fluorescent detection of Salmonella typhimurium. The limit of bacterial detection was 50 CFU ml−1 while a linear relation was found between the concentration of bacteria and fluorescence intensity in the range of 103 to 105 CFU ml−1. This conjugated probe was also tested for real samples of eggshell and tap water and the results were very similar to the conventional plate count method which suggests the potential application of these systems for detection of Salmonella typhimurium in real situations.302
Simultaneous detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Salmonella typhimurium was also possible using a combination of green (gQD) and red quantum (rQD) dots with carbon nanoparticles. With the attachment of a specific aptamer, the respective QDs-CNP assembly was able to measure the FRET fluorescence changes from the interaction of target bacteria within a linear range of 50 to 106 CFU ml−1 and the detection limit was 25 and 35 CFU ml−1 for each bacterium respectively. The detection capability of the sensor platform using the plate count method showed consistency when compared to shrimp and chicken as real solid samples for analysis.303
A GQDs–AuNPs FRET biosensor was developed for S. aureus specific gene sequence detection by immobilising the capture probe on GQDs and conjugation of reporter probes on AuNPs. Then, the hybridization of target S. aureus oligos within a conc. range of 100 nM to 400 nM packed between the GQD and AuNP layers formed a sandwich structure which triggered the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. One of the interesting features of this work was that the detection limit of this biosensor was 1 nM for S. aureus specific gene detection, which clearly demonstrated the good selectivity. In a single and double mismatched oligos system at 200 nM, the sensor recorded a quencher efficiency of 93% for target oligos and 22–37% for mismatched oligos which indicated the specificity of the sensor. This simple technology could be used for the whole genome detection of S. aureus which would open the platform for the detection of foodborne pathogens. This would significantly support the food safety and environmental screening.304
7. Conclusion and future prospects
Despite the fact that a tremendous amount of progress has been made in the fabrication of nanoporous carbons with contemporary structures and unique morphologies, exciting opportunities have still persisted for their functionalization in developing multifunctional properties for divergent specific applications. The integration of different heteroatoms into the nanoporous carbon framework together provided us a new class of materials exhibiting many unmatched properties. By controlling both chemistry and geometry of these functionalized hybrid nanoporous carbon based materials using different templates or micelles, these functional materials have already had applications in a wide variety of different technological and scientific fields. Various strategies have been applied for the fabrication of nanoporous carbon materials with exemplary textural parameters starting from the basic synthesis methods, such as templating techniques, to the advanced surfactant mediating approaches.
In this review, we have reviewed and discussed the recent significant breakthroughs in the synthesis and control of the structure, morphology and functionalities of ordered nanoporous carbon materials. We have also shown how the structures and morphological control affect the final textural properties of the materials, and their roles in the final performance of the materials in various applications including adsorption, carbon capture, energy storage batteries and supercapacitors, electrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis have been discussed in detail. We have also imparted the exhaustive analysis of the structure–function correlation of functionalized nanoporous carbon materials and considered their diverse preparation methods including mono or binary and even ternary doping methods by using different heteroatoms (B, N, O, S, and P) and foreign elements (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) containing natural and synthetic carbonaceous precursors, surface modifications and functionalization with organic and inorganic molecules and nanostructures.
With these developed robust and reliable doping, functionalization and templating strategies, a broad range of nanoporous functionalized carbon materials with pore cavity sizes in the range of 2–50 nm and with various dimensions (1D, 2D and 3D) can be readily and selectively fabricated for promising advanced technological applications. The prepared functionalized nanoporous carbon materials have been effectively used mainly in electrochemical energy conversion and storage device fabrication technologies. Their involvement in electrochemical energy storage applications, including Li-ion batteries, post Li-ion batteries including Li–S, Li–air and Na-ion batteries, and supercapacitors, was presented in detail. Recent discoveries in energy conversion applications such as electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on functionalized nanoporous carbon materials were also introduced in detail. By finely tuning the textural parameters, morphology and doping concentrations of the nanoporous carbon materials at different length scales, their performance in adsorption, carbon capture, sensing, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion can be significantly enhanced.
Before inception of the block copolymer assisted soft template synthesis method for the preparation of highly ordered mesoporous carbon materials, the pre-prepared inorganic porous material mediated hard template nanocasting approach was considered as the only method that can be used for the successful fabrication of mesoporous carbon with well-defined pores. The soft-template method relies on supramolecular micelle assemblies, which enhances the polymerization processes of carbon molecular precursors. The soft templating method is thermodynamically driven, and therefore depends on the chemical interactions between supramolecular templates and carbon molecular precursors. Because of their facile synthesis and processing characteristics, soft templating synthesis processes governed by the block copolymer templates have dominated and created new possibilities for the synthesis of mesoporous carbons overcoming the intrinsic limitations imposed by the hard template method.
In this review, we have thoroughly conferred the recent research developments and trends in both hard templating and soft templating techniques for the synthesis of highly ordered nanoporous carbons without any dopants and also functionalized nanoporous carbons with mono, binary and ternary heteroatom doping and foreign elements. Heteroatom doping, functionalization and morphological control of nanoporous carbon materials are highly dependent on the processing conditions. These modification processes also play a key role in controlling the textural parameters such as specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the functionalized nanoporous carbon materials. Precise control of these parameters is important as they dictate the efficiency of the nanoporous carbon materials in many applications.
In the last few decades, there has been a tremendous amount of research and development activities devoted to the discovery of new materials and technology for energy generation, storage and conversion, owing to the development of alternative, economical and sustainable energy resources to meet the ever growing global energy demand and environmental impact on the heavy dependence of traditional fossil fuel based energy resources, which poses serious challenges to human health, energy security, and environmental protection. As presented in this review, the fuel cell technology offers a viable approach to generate electricity from the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen by production of water as the by-product, and virtually no pollution. The slow ORR kinetics on the cathode side is a key step limiting the energy conversion efficiency of a fuel cell and requires a substantial amount of the catalyst. Traditionally, platinum (Pt) has been regarded as the best ORR catalyst. However, the Pt-based electrode suffers from multiple drawbacks such as high cost, scarcity, and susceptibility to fuel crossover, time-dependent drift and CO poisoning under electrochemical conditions. Along with the intensive research efforts in reducing or replacing the Pt-based electrode in fuel cells, heteroatom and non-precious metal doped nanoporous carbon materials have been discovered as a new class of electrocatalysts for ORR, which could dramatically reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of fuel cells. The functionalized nanoporous carbon materials successfully catalyze the O2 molecule via 4 electron reduction pathways at the same or lower potentials than golden standard Pt based catalysts under both acidic and basic conditions. The nanoporous carbon materials also possessed excellent long-term stability with almost 100% retention of the initial current even after several hours of continuous operation. They also showed a good tolerance against the methanol crossover effect. The enhanced catalytic performance of the functionalized nanoporous carbon materials has been attributed to the electron-accepting/donating abilities of the heteroatoms or functional elements present in the nanoporous carbon framework, which create a net charge on adjacent carbon atoms to facilitate the O2 adsorption and net charge transfer for ORR.
Another great opportunity for functionalized nanoporous carbon materials lies in the efficient storage of energy generated by fuel cell technology, which is a win–win situation for these fascinating materials. The use of functionalized nanoporous carbon materials has generated much excitement in the field of energy storage systems, including supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries and post Li-ion batteries. As it was clearly explained in this review, the functionalized nanoporous carbon architectures can be introduced with heteroatoms, redox functional groups, functional elements, metals, metal oxides, conducting polymers and alloy based materials to enhance both electron and ion transport in the active materials for improvement of energy storage capability and stability of the batteries and supercapacitor devices. Apart from the energy conversion and storage devices including fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors, the future challenge is to design and develop functionalized nanoporous carbon materials having a suitable band structure, with inbuilt functional moieties including organic or inorganic nanostructures in the mesochannels of electrodes. These electrodes should be able to split the water molecules under electrochemical conditions for the facile production of hydrogen and oxygen which can be connected to fuel cell technology that offers a viable approach to electricity generation directly from water without any pollution.
Although the functionalised nanoporous carbons offer excellent performances in the energy oriented applications, it is still required to achieve a cost-effective way for the large-scale production of cheap electrode materials and electrocatalysts which are both highly stable and reliable. These are the major limitations for these exciting materials. Therefore, the future challenge is to synthesize highly pure functionalized nanoporous carbon materials without any contamination in a more economical way without using harsh conditions and expensive reagents but with low-cost biodegradable carbon or nitrogen precursors. As discussed above in this review, the functionalized nanoporous carbon materials having high specific areas were found to be the best materials for CO2 adsorption. The future mega challenge for materials scientists is to utilize both the in-built electronic and absorption properties of the functionalized nanoporous carbons to convert the adsorbed CO2 into fuels and chemicals by using water as the hydrogen source through electrocatalysis. The proof-of-concept studies will certainly stimulate more research in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.
Nowadays, functionalized nanoporous carbon materials are fascinating even in the biomedical fields. Their biocompatibility for tissue engineering and theragnostic applications such as bio sensing, drug delivery, gene therapy, bio imaging, phototherapy and hybrid theragnostic is highly challenging by which one can understand that numerous research efforts are needed in these areas to develop and invent novel functionalised nanoporous materials in the future.
Irreversible agglomeration of nanoporous carbon layers and uncontrollable doping of heteroatoms at the molecular level during their preparation through the high temperature pyrolysis methods are important challenges and are yet to be addressed. Although the heteroatom doping has made remarkable progress, its facile synthetic routes are still being developed with the multiple heteroatom doping in nanoporous carbon frameworks. Further, process simplification is needed to lower the consumption of consumables and energy as well as decrease waste generation. Moreover, the low yield of ordered nanoporous carbon materials provided by the current synthesis methods also remains an issue from the perspective of their potential use in industrial processes. By irreversible acidic and basic moiety functionalization of nanoporous carbons with known and desired functional groups, it is possible to control the anchoring of heteroatoms on their surface in a desirable way. Surface functionalization of nanoporous carbons also improves their solubility and stability and reduces the agglomeration, which can help them with improved performance towards selective sensing of hazardous heavy metals, pathogens and toxins. It is quite surprising that in recent days the interest towards the application of functionalised nanoporous carbon for drug delivery has been increasing, mainly due to the functionalisation methods that have the ability to enhance the compatibility of nanoporous carbon materials. These methodologies allow immobilisation of DNA, proteins, enzymes and drugs that can be finally involved in the in vivo drug delivery. However, the practical applications of these materials are still under investigation and very few studies have offered a proof of concept. Therefore, a wide spectrum of research is deliberately needed for the biomedical applications.
The research articles reviewed in this review article illustrate the fabrication of nanoporous carbons and the great interest towards their properties and applications. Carbons have already made a revolution in the world and the nanoporous carbon materials are their fascinating parts and the present trend in the ocean of carbon is the functionalisation of nanoporous carbon which is now making history through small modifications and an outstanding improvement in the world. There is no doubt that a lot of opportunities are hidden and the researchers should explore more on utilizing the amazing potential of these functionalized ordered nanoporous carbons in the above suggested applications covering the energy, environment and health sectors. We are confident that the information presented in this review would definitely support advances in the research and development of ordered nanoporous carbon materials.
