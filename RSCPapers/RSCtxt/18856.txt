    , Accepted 18th February 2022First published on 21st February 2022AbstractAll-inorganic perovskites (such as CsPbI3) are emerging as new candidates for photovoltaic applications. Unfortunately, this class of materials present two important weaknesses in their way to commercialization: poor stability and toxicity. This paper explores the possibility of lessening both stability and toxicity related problems, as well as obtaining improved photovoltaic efficiencies through the propitious fine-tuning of the chemical composition. Therefore, a systematic ab initio study of the family of all-inorganic perovskites with the general formula RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0–0.125 and b = 0–1) is here presented. Our results provide a complete description on the connections between the chemical composition, crystal structure, intrinsic stability, electronic properties, and absorption features, pointing out that all-inorganic RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0.125 and 1 > b > 0.5) perovskites would be adequate candidates for photovoltaic applications with improved stability and reduced Pb concentration.
Introduction
Perovskites became a mandatory line of research in any laboratory with interests in photovoltaic energy for a few years now, with more than 3000 research articles per year since 2017 (data from the Web of Science with the keyword perovskite solar cell). Thanks to all the research devoted to these materials that the promising 3% efficiency presented barely 15 years ago turned into a really impressing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% (29.5% when used in tandem configuration with Si cells) in record time.1–6 These high efficiencies were initially reported for the organic–inorganic hybrid methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite. During the last years, the vast majority of the efficiency records for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been obtained for MAPI and formamidinium lead iodide (FAPI) perovskites or their mixtures. Thanks to their outstanding properties, such as a very adequate direct bandgap,7,8 a high absorption coefficient,9,10 superior ambipolar charge mobility and long charge diffusion length11–13 and a small exciton binding energy,14–16 perovskites are attracting great interest, leading the way for the new generation of solar cells, cheaper and at least as efficient as the present leader technology, silicon solar cells. Nevertheless, besides all their strengths, organic–inorganic perovskites, particularly MAPI and FAPI, also present some important weaknesses, two of which are especially crucial in their way to commercialization: their poor stability and toxicity.17–19 Both stability and toxicity related problems can be solved through the adequate modification of the chemical composition.
There are several mechanisms by which perovskites generally suffer instability problems. The most common of them are hydration, oxidation, polymorphic transition and direct decomposition.20–23 Besides intrinsic instability of the corresponding compound, these mechanisms can be induced by different agents including UV light, heat, oxygen and moisture. As a result of all these issues, perovskites present the highest lifetimes of 10000/1000 h in storage/under illumination in tests,24 far below necessities to compete against silicon technology, which is used in devices that last for 25 years or even more.19 This way, those mechanisms of degradation need to be addressed in depth without delay. Looking at top-performers MAPI and FAPI, one of their main problems is the weak bond between the organic cations and the PbI6 octahedra.17,25 The different degrees of freedom of rotational and translational motion of the organic cation provoke ion migration or phase transitions that modify the properties of the compounds.26–29 Organic cations are also the most affected under moisture conditions due to their high hygroscopicity.30 For this reason, latest trends point towards substitution of the organic molecules with inorganic cations, trying to solve these problems.31–35 In particular, the partial introduction of Cs substituting methylammonium or the corresponding organic molecules was initially studied, resulting in slightly better stabilities.36,37 Most recently, the focus has turned towards total replacement of the organic molecule, leading to fully inorganic perovskites,38 with CsPbI3 gathering much attention.39–42 Unfortunately, all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite presents spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite black α-phase to the light-inactive yellow δ-phase, mainly because of distortions of the structure caused by the small size of the cesium atoms to hold the PbI6 octahedra.43,44 In order to overcome this issue, partial compositions of different halides have been extendedly studied,39,45–49 with different compromise solutions between stability and suitable bandgaps for photovoltaic applications, considering that smaller halides result in compounds with larger bandgaps. Among those solutions outstands the CsPbI2Br perovskite, which exhibits an adequate bandgap but also phase stability at room temperature, thanks to a lower phase transition temperature with the bromine addition.45,50–54 In this line of using chemical composition as a tool to solve stability problems, many other options, aside from those previously mentioned, have been studied and tested, with a myriad of different elements at different levels of concentration.43,55–63 Among them, the presence of small rubidium concentrations (around 0.05–0.1) has been proposed to improve the stability of cesium perovskites, passivating grain boundaries and hardly changing bandgap values.64–67
Toxicity problems are linked to the presence of lead atoms. Replacing this element seems a logic solution.68–75 However, lead s and p-states comprise and shape the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum in perovskites,76 therefore being responsible for the high PCE values, because of which it is difficult to get rid of this element without jeopardizing efficiency. Structural variations of the simple perovskite, like double perovskites or even more complex structures have been suggested as an alternative to lead-based perovskites; however, they present indirect bandgaps and very low mobilities of charge carriers, leading to PCEs not exceeding 3%.69,77–79 Better results in terms of PCE have been presented with tin perovskites, more similar to lead perovskites than other options although with little worse stability, mainly because of issues related to Sn2+ oxidation.80,81 Fighting with this issue, it has been reported that Rb introduction can also help in reducing significantly formation of Sn4+ vacancies.66 For the case of pure tin perovskites PCEs of 14% have been reached (10% for all-inorganic perovskites), while for mixed lead-tin the rise is up to 21% for the moment.82–85
Following lines of design for new all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with improved efficiency and stability and lower lead-related toxicity issues, compounds with different Pb/Sn ratios, as well as Rb-doped compounds, i.e., RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0–0.125; b = 0–1), are explored by Density Functional Theory (DFT).86,87 The usefulness of a computational analysis through the DFT method is noticeable, acting as a roadmap of properties for experimentalists, which has much more difficulties in covering wide spaces of chemical composition with different concentration rates, in terms of resources, time and cost of both.68 Information on intrinsic stability and accurate description of the electronic structure, and sun-light absorption features are presented.
Computational details
The step-by-step procedure to conduct this analysis consists of three levels of DFT86,87 and beyond DFT calculations. First of all, a structure optimization of all the compounds, to relax atomic forces and total energies within a tolerance of 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, has been performed, followed by a static calculation of the electronic structure with a very dense grid of k-points to fully describe the reciprocal space. For the structural relaxation step, the PBEsol functional,88 with higher accuracies presented for this task when used in solids, has been used in all the cases, while the standard PBE functional89 has been chosen for the obtention of electronic structure in static calculations. Regarding k-point meshes, Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack grids90 of 8 × 8 × 8 and 12 × 12 × 12 points have been applied to these steps, respectively.
Due to the widely known underestimation of the bandgap values of the GGA level of theory, a subsequent step or level of calculation is required to obtain accurate electronic structures and their dependent properties, like the bandgaps and the dielectric constants. With this purpose, beyond DFT level calculations using the Hubbard model for the electron correlation, widely known as the DFT+U method,91,92 have been performed. Other approximations, like different GW calculations based on many body perturbation theory,93 the hybrid HSE06 functional94 or a combination of both of them have also been tested. In fact, as reported in previous works on the matter, GW presents very precise results when used on top of PBE relaxed structures when compared to experimental values of inorganic perovskites,95,96 excluding finite-temperature calculations to account for thermal effects, which are far more expensive in terms of computational cost and for that reason out of the scope of this work. Nevertheless, all those methods dramatically fail when used on top of structures relaxed with PBEsol (which in turn are more precise than those obtained with PBE), especially for those compounds that show metallic or almost metallic nature when calculated with PBE. Inclusion of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect97 in the calculations has also been tested and properly discussed in the results section of this work. All the calculations proposed here have been performed with the projector-augmented wave scheme as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).98–100
All-inorganic RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br perovskites with different partial concentrations of the IV-group cations (a = 0.0 and 0.125; b = 0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, and 1.0) have been studied in this work. The model system of RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br perovskites was built starting from the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of CsPbI3 with 40 atoms. Additionally, the effect of lower Rb concentrations (a = 0.0625) on the bandgap has been also studied using bigger 4 × 2 × 2 supercells with 80 atoms. Only cubic perovskite structures have been considered for this work, as those with solar application considering non-perovskite phases exhibit larger bandgaps with no interest for this work.101,102 Configuration of the IV-group and Rb atoms for the different concentrations has been defined by looking for the highest space group symmetries, using the combinatorial methodology implemented in the SOD (Site Occupancy Disorder) program.103
Results and discussion
The study of all-inorganic RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br perovskites is divided into three sections aimed at assessing their main structural and electronic features as a function of the chemical composition. Firstly, in an analysis of the most important structural parameters, distortions and intrinsic stabilities are given. The second section is devoted to selecting an adequate DFT method, which should provide accurate electronic band structures and absorption properties bearing in mind a good compromise between accuracy and computational effort. Finally, electronic structure properties and absorption coefficients are assessed.
Structural and thermodynamic parameters
A detailed structural analysis to assess the structure distortion (i.e., changes in the unit cell structures when Cs and/or Pb are atoms are replaced in relation to the pristine compound, CsPbI2Br) can throw relevant information on intrinsic stability. Lattice constants, bond distances, inner angles of PbI6 octahedra – or BX6, generalized for different chemical compositions – and Goldschmidt's tolerance factor offer an overview of the perovskite cubic phase predominance over other structures like orthorhombic, the crystal quality or intrinsic stability, paying special attention to tilting or rotation of the octahedra, which we already know leads to deterioration of conductivity properties among others.26,28 Also, total energies from static calculations allow for obtaining formation enthalpies, considering at least fundamental elements, binary compounds from typical decomposition pathways and pure ternary perovskites to account for phase segregation.
To gain some insight into the structure of all-inorganic perovskites, the CsPbX3 perovskite structure is depicted in Fig. 1, paying special attention to the bond-generated octahedral configuration (BX6 and XCs4B2), whose proportions and dimensions are related to the structural stability. As seen for CsPbI2Br, the pseudo-cubic structure comes from the combination of two halogens in the X position, where bromines occupy opposite corners in the octahedra along one same direction with a consequent shortening of that lattice vector. First of all, the size and shape of the pseudo-cubic cells corresponding to the perovskite structure for the different compositions are presented in Fig. 2, where the main lattice constant and shape factor are depicted. The ratio between that shortened vector modulus and that of the other identical two is what here called the shape factor, which measures deviation from that perfect cubic shape. In all the studied cases, those two non-shortened lattice vectors remain equal even after relaxation. Also, orthogonality between lattice vectors of the unit cell is perfectly preserved, with the only exceptions of Rb-doped compounds with partial concentrations of Pb and Sn other than 0.5 (Rb0.125Cs0.875SnbPb1−bI2Br with b = 0.125, 0.25, 0.75, or 0.875), where maximum deviations of 0.23° are observed. This way unit cell angles are not considered as a relevant parameter here. From Fig. 2, it can be observed that the lattice constant decreases linearly in coherence with the size of the divalent cations with the concentration of tin and lead. On the contrary, for the compounds with rubidium a significant reduction of the unit cell size is observed, except for the quaternary cases (b = 0 or b = 1), in which no substantial effect is noticed. That reduction is more acute in comparison to compounds without rubidium for higher concentrations of lead.

 Fig. 2  Lattice constant (blue lines) and shape factor (purple lines) variations as a function of the chemical composition. Continuous lines correspond to CsSnbPb1−bI2Br compounds, while dashed lines correspond to Rb0.125Cs0.875SnbPb1−bI2Br. 
Meanwhile, shape factor hardly changes with b concentration for compounds without rubidium and for those with rubidium an additional shortening occurs in the same compounds where a reduction of the lattice parameter occurs, leading to smaller volumes of the cells in comparison. The same trend occurs again with introduction of tin softening that reduction, as we can see comparing the volumes of the compounds with the same b concentration with and without rubidium, where volume ratios of 0.9688 and 0.9813 are observed for b equal to 0.125 and 0.875 respectively, and intermediate values following the trend too.
In those compounds where both Cs and Pb ions are partially replaced, the variety of distance values between the same kind of two ions (Cs–X, Rb–X, Pb–X, and Sn–X, where X = I or Br) due to different surrounding environments is a good indicator of the crystal structure distortion. Fig. 3 presents average distances between different ions for all the compounds, as well as standard deviations from those mean values. Both AX (Fig. 3a) and BX (Fig. 3b) distances confirm that there are no distortions of the perovskite structure besides the shortening along the Br string direction for compounds without rubidium. Note that both CsPbI2Br and CsSnI2Br present a well-defined perovskite structure, with the exception of the shortened lattice vector on the Br string direction. Introduction of low rates of Rb (1/8 of total monovalent cations) is not enough to distort PbI4Br2 octahedra and the cells are this way able to dilute the effect of the small size of the Rb atom and preserve its shape. This fact can be noticed mainly from zero standard deviations among different distances presented. Pure tin and lead structures with rubidium present almost identical distances to their equivalents without rubidium, which means no substantial distortions either, as confirmed from lattice parameters and inner angles. For all these compounds the larger standard deviation is 0.01 Å, which represents a variation below 0.4% of the total bond distance. Regarding the remaining distorted structures (those with rubidium and b = 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.875), great differences between Cs–X and Rb–X are good evidence of unbalanced structures, apart from larger standard deviations from mean distances than the previous cases. Compounds with b concentrations equal to 0.125 and 0.875 are those with more accused distortions, especially for Sn–Br, Cs–I and mostly for Cs–Br distances, where standard deviations of 0.26 and 0.38 Å respectively are reached, more than 25 times higher than those for the intermediate structures with b equal to 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. A fact that is worth noticing is that despite the smaller size of the distorted cells, the BX6 octahedra increase their size in these distorted structures, as can be seen in their longer BX distances. This could be one possible reason for deviations from trends in their optical properties that will be explained later.
 Fig. 3  Average bond distances of the different cations and anions in the cell, including standard deviations grouped in (a) AX distances and (b) BX distances. 
In Fig. 4 the different angles defined by X–B–X bonds are presented. For simplicity, only deviations from original right and straight angles are shown and just for the perovskites with rubidium, as those without it present no deviations at all from the orthogonal directions. This way four different angles are presented: Br–B–Br which ideally forms 180° angles, Br–B–I defining 90° angles and theoretically coplanar I–B–I angles divided in straight and right angles. We opted for presenting deviations from right angles in absolute values, to avoid compensation for means of zero, and consequently deviations from straight angles are presented in positive for convenience when looking at the graph. One more time, structures without rubidium present perfectly ideal values of 90° and 180° for every inner angle, while for Rb0.125Cs0.875SnI2Br and Rb0.125Cs0.875PbI2Br maximum deviations of 0.3° take place. In contrast, quinary compounds (Rb0.125Cs0.875SnbPb1−bI2Br for b = 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 0.875) present maximum deviations up to 6° for the two more distorted compounds (those with a 1 to 7 proportion of divalent cations) and up to 2° for the other three compounds, which is still a quite high value. To emphasize distortion in those first two compounds is enough to look at the enormous variability, represented by the standard deviation, among all the angles which basically means that almost every octahedron is different from the next one. The minimum and maximum standard deviations for those two compounds are 0.86° and 2.70°, with the maximum for the other three compounds being 0.78°.

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is widely used to assess the stability within this cubic phase and the possibility of a phase transition because of structure distortion,104,105 which is defined as (1)where rA, rB and rX correspond to the elemental radii of the ions occupying the corresponding position in the perovskite structure as previously named, considering weighted radii when needed because of mixed cations or anions (i.e., rX = 1/3·rBr + 2/3·rI, rA = a·rRb + (1 − a)·rCs and rB = b·rSn + (1 − b)·rPb).
As stated in the scientific literature,105 those compounds with Goldschmidt values between 0.8 and 1 are plausible to exist in perovskite form, thanks to a well-balanced size of their atoms which allows for holding the BX6 octahedra without important distortions that subsequently lead to a phase transition. As expected, Goldschmidt parameter shows linear variations with composition, as it is defined exclusively by the radii of the atoms occupying different positions in the perovskite structure, weighted when more than one element occupies equivalent positions. Values of all the compounds studied here fall within that range, with the minimum and maximum values being 0.850 and 0.887, corresponding to Rb0.125Cs0.875PbI2Br and CsSnI2Br respectively (see Fig. 5).

Finally, the intrinsic stability of studied compounds has been also assessed from a thermodynamic perspective through their formation enthalpies. Both formation enthalpies compared to fundamental elements (ΔHf) and binary compounds (ΔHd), according to the standard route from minimal energy binary compounds, have been defined as follows: (2) (3)where Etot[M] and μ0i stand for the total energy of M (M = RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br, CsBr, RbBr, PbI2, and SnI2) and chemical potential of constituent element i (i = Rb, Cs, Pb, Sn, I, and Br), i.e., the total energy per atom in its corresponding bulk phase, respectively.

Fig. 5a and b display ΔHs and ΔHd, respectively, in both cases contrasted to Goldschmidt tolerance factor displayed in the right axis. Fundamental element enthalpies are below −1 eV per atom for all the compounds. In general, negative ΔHf values determine the range of chemical potential within which the studied material would be thermodynamically stable, being negative values an essential although not sufficient on itself requirement for synthesizability of the materials. In this case, this metastability criteria is accomplished by far, proving the stability of the perovskite structure and the suitability of the elements chosen, being compounds with lead those with lowest values. Except for CsPbI2Br and CsSnI2Br, the substitutional doping with Rb leads to slightly lower ΔHf values. Another limit to be considered for the compounds to be stable would be also negative values of ΔHd. In this case, the same linear trend as the one observed for the Goldschmidt parameter is also observed for all the studied perovskites without rubidium, while for those with Rb linearity disappears because of the distortion of the structure. Introduction of Sn improves the stability versus these binary compounds as indicated by lower values. This way, the maximum value is observed for Rb0.125Cs0.875PbI2Br with 11.69 meV per atom and the minimum of −34.31 meV per atom is for CsSnI2Br, slightly lower than that of Rb0.125Cs0.875Sn0.875Pb0.125I2Br. Positive values indicate certain leaning to decomposition through that pathway, although as we previously commented all the compounds fall within the metastability limit and those with positive values are reasonably below 15 meV per atoms, which is not higher enough to discard them for synthesizability. When comparing compounds with and without Rb, higher formation enthalpies are observed for pure tin and pure lead compounds where there is no significant distortion of the structure, but when distortion takes place the opposite happens. This way, it's very interesting to see that distorted structures, as previously catalogued, are counterintuitively those with more negative values and therefore those with less probabilities to decompose this way. Paying attention to the comparison between both parameters, Fig. 5b shows clearly that Goldschmidt parameter results in a very good descriptor of thermodynamic stability, as trends of both parameters perfectly match for non-distorted compounds, but fail at the time of describing those structures farthest from the canonical perovskite structure.
DFT methods for electronic structures
One of the most important properties when evaluating the photovoltaic potential of a material is its bandgap, because it is the main parameter which defines its absorptivity of the solar light, which in turn determines PCE together with mobility and recombination. Besides bandgap values, the type of bandgap, direct or indirect, has also a direct impact on absorption, mobility and recombination, being this way of huge importance. For the case of all the compounds studied within this work, bandgaps are in all cases direct, thus increasing absorption.
To obtain precise bandgaps of all the studied compounds, considering underestimation associated with GGA calculations, different methods have been tested as previously commented (see the Computational details section). Those methods have been preliminarily tested in quaternary compounds CsPbI2Br and CsSnI2Br, from which we have experimental bandgap values,54,72 as well as for CsSn0.5Pb0.5I2Br, to check also a compound with mixed cations in the B position. Bandgap values of these compounds and for the different methods tested are presented in Table 1. All the tested methods fail to overcome the initial underestimation from PBE. As seen in Table 1 for CsSnI2Br, the initial guess from the PBE functional shows a metallic behaviour which cannot be corrected in any subsequent calculation with GW approximation nor the hybrid functional with an error of at least 0.97 eV. Despite not knowing previous values for CsSn0.5Pb0.5I2Br, a bandgap somewhere between the values of the other two compounds should be expected, as although could not be linear the introduction of tin depicts a descent trend in the gap. Nevertheless, the highest value obtained is 0.16 eV lower than the experimental value of CsSnI2Br. In the case of CsPbI2Br an acceptable underestimation of 0.05 eV is achieved with the GW0 calculation, even though it could not be considered very precise to obtain accurate optical absorption spectra. The inclusion of the SOC would also tend to reduce bandgaps even more when separating degenerate states in the valence band.106–108 Thus, its inclusion has been discarded. This way PBE+U turns out to be the only available solution to obtain accurate electronic structure results.

Finally for PBE+U, different U values have also been checked to obtain experimental bandgaps of the previous test compounds, but also of ternary perovskites with the anions (I and Br) and cations (Pb and Sn) studied here (see Fig. 6). Taking as a frame of reference the two compounds with only one divalent cation and with the relative concentration of halides studied here, CsPbI2Br and CsSnI2Br, experimental values of the bandgap have been achieved with values of 5.6 and 11 eV applied to p-type orbitals of Pb and Sn respectively, and thus those have been chosen for the rest of the compounds with I2Br concentration in the anion positions.
 Fig. 6  Calculated bandgap using PBE+U (continuous lines) and PBE+U+SOC (dashed lines) for CsPbI3 (blue), CsPbBr3 (green), CsSnI3 (yellow), CsSnBr3 (red), CsPbI2Br (cyan) and CsSnI2Br (orange). Horizontal dotted lines stand for experimental bandgap values (taken from ref. 32, 54, 72 and 111–113); diamonds signal final values used for each compound. 

SOC effect inclusion. 
As stated before, PBE+U turned out to be the only available solution to present accurate electronic structure results. However, due to the presence of heavy atoms (Pb), electronic structure calculations with SOC should be carried out, i.e., PBE+U+SOC. This method was tested for ternary compounds (CsBX3, B = Pb and Sn; X = I and Br), quaternary (CsBI2Br) and those with mixed cations at the B position (CsSn0.5Pb0.5I2Br). For comparison purposes and seeking to compensate for the narrowing effect of SOC inclusion in the bandgap value, higher values of U have been used to obtain the same bandgap values as when SOC is not applied. This way, U values increase to 15.2 and 14.2 eV for Pb and Sn atoms, respectively, when the SOC effect is added (in comparison with the 5.6 and 11 eV in the absence of SOC). Bandgap value trends with some of the U-values tested for the different compounds are presented in Fig. 6.
Band structures of the reference compounds are depicted in Fig. 7, with a comparison side to side between calculations with and without the SOC effect. In those comparisons, the effect of SOC on the VB and CB of the compounds can be clearly seen. In all of them, p-type states of the cation, located near the CB minima, split in two branches pushing all but one states to higher energies. That way the CB is even less dense in the cases of the SOC effect included, which will be seen also in the absorption spectra in the form of a decrease of the absorption coefficient. On the contrary, VB states are a bit more compressed than without SOC, mitigating to some extent that effect, which is perfectly noticeable in compounds with higher concentration of Pb and slighter in those with more Sn.
 Fig. 7  Electronic band structures calculated using PBE+U (blue) and PBE+U+SOC (orange). U values of 5.6/11 eV for Pb/Sn without SOC and 15.2/14.2 when SOC is used. The zero of energy was set at the Fermi level energy. Horizontal dashed lines corresponded to conduction band minimum (red) and valence band maximum (green) energies calculated at the Γ-point. 
As seen, accurate bandgap values can be easily achieved through an adequate selection of U values over p-type states of the B cation, regardless if SOC is included or not. In addition, the effects of SOC have been also checked for absorption coefficients. Fig. 8 shows a comparison of the calculated absorption coefficients with and without the SOC methodology. As can be seen, since the bandgap is accurately obtained by fine-tuning U values, the absorption coefficient yields a similar profile for both PBE+U and PBE+U+SOC methods, wherein the absorption edge starts to increase from the bandgap value. The main difference upon SOC inclusion is noted for the total absorption, which has been quantified through the area under the curve (AUC), that defines the integral of a curve that describes the absorption as a function of the energy. Fig. 8b displays AUC values calculated with PBE+U and PBE+U+SOC methods. As seen in Fig. 8b, the substitution of Pb by Sn leads to higher AUC values. If comparing differences between results with and without SOC for the compounds with lead and for the compounds with tin, it can be seen that SOC has a bigger impact for those compounds with B = Pb. Nonetheless, both PBE+U and PBE+U+SOC methods yield the same trend as a function of the chemical composition. Being one of the goals of this work to offer alternatives to lead for perovskite, as we increase the concentration of Sn in the compounds the use of SOC will have less and less meaning. Therefore, PBE+U is an adequate method to yield accurate bandgap values and related properties, such as absorption coefficients. With all these results and taking into account the increase of resources demanded by SOC included calculations, around 3 times more memory and 5–10 times in terms of computing hours according to our results, the decision to not include the SOC effect in our calculations was made, also considering that a respectable number of compounds are being studied.

Electronic structure analysis and absorption properties

Fig. 9 depicts bandgap values for RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br perovskites studied here. Its similarity to previously presented figures like those for formation enthalpy vs. binary precursors (Fig. 5b) and lattice parameter (Fig. 2) can be seen clearly, meaning a strong correlation of these bandgap values with structure distortion as well. An almost linear trend is observed for non rubidium-doped perovskites with a decrease with tin introduction from 1.90 eV for CsPbI2Br to 1.36 eV for CsSnI2Br. Bandgap is once again not affected by rubidium introduction in those compounds where the perovskite structure is not distorted much because of it. On the contrary a prominent increase of the bandgap is observed when introducing Rb in those cases where a distortion of the structure is produced, even more pronounced for those two structures previously catalogued as highly distorted.
 Fig. 9  Bandgaps values for CsSnbPb1−bI2Br (red), Rb0.125Cs0.875SnbPb1−bI2Br (blue) and Rb0.0625Cs0.9375SnbPb1−bI2Br (green) compounds calculated using PBE+U (U = 5.6/11 eV for Pb/Sn atoms). 
To go deeper in this question additional calculations have been performed on bigger 80 atom cells with a monovalent cation Rb/Cs ratio of 0.0625/0.9375. The bandgaps of those compounds have been obtained using exactly the same methodology and U values as for the compounds previously analysed, whether with or without rubidium. The resulting values of the bandgap, with deviations in the bandgap value below the 0.33% in comparison to the corresponding compounds without Rb, confirm that distortion because of Rb, and not introduction of Rb electronic levels, is the main cause of bandgap changes.
Next, the electronic configuration of all the studied compounds will be addressed, to get some chemical knowledge on the effect of the different atom substitutions accomplished. The projected density of states (PDOS) is displayed in Fig. 10. For the sake of simplicity, especially considering that direct bandgaps are shown by all the compounds, electronic band structures are given in the ESI (Fig. S1.1–S1.14†). From PDOS graphs presented in Fig. 10 we can see, as it is already commonly known about perovskites, that CB minima in all the compounds are mainly defined by lead/tin states, while VB maxima are a combination of the same divalent cation and the halide anion orbitals. Specifically, p-type orbitals of Pb/Sn constitute the CB and hybridization of s-type orbitals of Pb/Sn and p-type ones of I/Br constitutes the VB. This way halide valence electrons also play a major role in the bandgap width, defining the position of the VB, although not much the shape of the bands. Monovalent cations, like Cs or Rb here, have on the contrary no direct effect on those border levels, as anticipated by previous analysis. Both CB and VB aren't very dense, a fact that can be seen even clearer in the band structures, with extreme levels being quite uneven in energy along the main k-point directions.
 Fig. 10  Density of states for RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br calculated with PBE+U (U = 5.6/11 eV for Pb/Sn atoms). The zero of energy was set at the Fermi level energy. 
Comparing the different compounds and paying attention to the effect of the different type of cation substitutions, we can see how plots for pure Sn and Pb compounds with and without Rb are practically identical, while when distortion is introduced as previously explained some differences can be noticed. In this line, compounds with Rb present the main peak of states in the VB, generated by the halogen orbitals, a bit closer to the VB maxima than the case of the compounds without it. That difference is around 0.2–0.3 eV for the different ratios of Pb/Sn. This fact could make those compounds present stronger absorption spectra than their analogous compounds without Rb, because of the additional electrons with higher chances of being promoted to the CB. Looking to Pb/Sn substitution, higher densities of states can be observed in the CB minima level corresponding to Pb atoms (p-type orbitals) than to Sn in the compounds with a complementary ratio of Pb/Sn. This detail could suggest that Pb compounds shall present higher absorption rates at energies close to that of the bandgap width than Sn compounds, but that difference is not very pronounced and the arbitrary units of the density of states don't help to elucidate the importance of the fact. This way, no significant difference beside the displacement of the bands resulting in the bandgap width change should be remarked.
Going beyond the electronic configuration of these compounds, one of the main parameters targeted in solar cell devices is absorption. The absorption coefficient of all these compounds has been obtained by means of their dielectric constant, according to the Kramers–Kronig relationship.109 Spectra for the whole series of b concentration without rubidium are presented in Fig. 11a, while those of their analogous compounds with 0.125 concentration of rubidium are displayed in Fig. 11b.
 Fig. 11  Absorption coefficients of a) CsSnbPb1−bI2Br and b) RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0.125) perovskites. 
From these figures, the influence of distortion can be seen too. Very linear shifting in bandgap energy can be seen here from higher lead concentration compounds to higher tin compounds for the case without Rb, agreeing with the results from the previous section. Compounds with Rb don't follow that linear trend because of the distortion, with b = 0.125 being the one with the lowest absorption because of its higher gap. It is also seen that tin compounds present a higher absorption, meaning a greater increase of the slope in the graph, for higher energies than lead compounds in both cases with and without Rb. From Fig. 11 it is observed that compounds with and without rubidium where no distortion occurs present identical spectra, which could be intuited from PDOS graphs but clearly seen now. To quantify the absorption for every compound AUC for each of them is presented in Fig. 12, where we can see lower AUC values for distorted Rb compounds because of the higher bandgap values. RbaCs1−aPbI2Br (a = 0, 0.125) yields AUC ≃ 11 × 104 eV cm−1. It also represents clearly the improvement in the absorption properties of the compounds as the Sn concentration grows, compared to Pb compounds. A difference of almost 2 × 104 eV cm−1 can be noticed between the pure tin compounds and the pure lead ones in that sense. In coherence with the effects of Cs replacement by Rb on the bandgap, except for pure Pb and Sn perovskites, AUC decreases to ≃2 × 104 eV cm−1 upon Rb doping.
 Fig. 12  Area under the curve (AUC) for the absorption coefficients. 
Based on the calculated bandgaps and absorption coefficients, the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of the studied compounds has been calculated, according to Yu and Zunger's method.110 SLME has been obtained for a fixed ambient temperature (293 K) and at different values of thickness of the absorber layer ranging from few nanometers to almost a micrometer. The results are presented in Fig. 13, where it can be seen that maximum values of SLME change mostly with the bandgap of the compound, owning those with lowest bandgaps the highest SLME. That way pure tin compounds present a maximum SLME of 30.17%, while a minimum value of 17.76% is for Rb0.125Cs0.875Sn0.125Pb0.875I2Br. Very similar band structures for all the compounds lead to differences in the absorption spectra besides the absorption edge defined by the bandgap that are not big enough to have an important impact on the SLME.

As said, the Pb dominated direct bandgap transition is the key for an improved light absorption and therefore improved PCE values. Thus, RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0.125, 0.5 ≤ b < 1) would be an adequate chemical composition to obtain AUC and SLME values higher than those obtained for CsPbI2Br, i.e., improved sun-light absorption with a reduced Pb concentration (which would allow a Pb-dominated transition) as well as an improved intrinsic stability due to Rb presence.
Conclusions
Suitability of all-inorganic perovskites with the general formula RbaCs1−aSnbPb1−bI2Br (a = 0–0.125 and b = 0–1) to be used as photovoltaic materials with improved intrinsic stability and sun light-absorption properties has been studied here by accurate ab initio methods. This way, a detailed picture of the variation of key properties related to structural distortion, thermodynamic formation enthalpies, electronic structure, and sun-light absorption as a function of the chemical composition is provided. We hope that all this information could guide experimental laboratories in the search of new all-inorganic perovskites with the desired properties, as well as with a reduced Pb-concentration. The main conclusions extracted from the results presented above are emphasized as follows:
• For mixed Sn–Pb perovskites, introduction of Rb leads to a distortion in the structure due to the smaller size of the Rb cation compared to the Cs one, which doesn't occur in the pure Sn and Pb perovskites. Higher rates of structural distortion lead to more negative formation enthalpies, meaning higher intrinsic stability. This could be an interesting effect looking at the well-known problems of stability of perovskites, if controlled and fine-tuned propitiously upon chemical composition.
• To study cation substitution effects on the electronic structure and absorption features, several ab initio methods (PBE, PBE+U, HSE06, GW, and spin–orbit coupling effects) have been assessed bearing in mind a good compromise between accuracy and computational efforts. Thus, we prove that PBE+U is a very cost-effective method to describe correctly the optical properties of these perovskites, especially Sn based compounds.
• For CsSnbPb1−bI2Br perovskites, replacement of Pb by Sn leads to lower bandgap values. Lower bandgaps of Sn based perovskites are responsible for their improved sun-light absorption features, as we saw with AUC up to 2 × 104 eV cm−1 higher than that of pure Pb perovskite. For pure Pb and Sn perovskites (i.e., CsPbI2Br and CsSnI2Br), introduction of Rb in the perovskite structure has no direct effect on the band gap of the compound. Nonetheless, Rb concentration rates higher than 6.25% (among monovalent cations) lead to a significant increase of the material band gap.
In summary, this paper reports an intensive analysis aiming to quantify distortions in all-inorganic perovskites with chemical composition, linked to changes in stability- and absorption-related properties. Thus, our results evidence that all-inorganic Rb0.125Cs0.875SnbPb1−bI2Br (0.5 < b < 1) perovskites with Rb doping and reduced Pb concentration would be excellent candidates to be used in high-efficiency photovoltaic devices, as active materials with improved stability, reduced toxicity and enhanced sun-light absorption features.
