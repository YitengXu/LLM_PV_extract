    , Accepted 2nd November 2015First published on 4th November 2015AbstractA cost-effective and solution processable hole transport material (HTM), TPDI (5,10,15-triphenyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole), was synthesized and explored as a hole selective contact material in low temperature (100 °C) and printable processed carbon counter electrode based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. This material demonstrated excellent thermal stability, high hole mobility and appropriate energy level alignment with CH3NH3PbI3 and carbon, which make it a potentially excellent alternative interfacial material for PSCs. By interfacial engineering with doped TPDI, the energy barrier at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface was efficiently eliminated. Dramatically enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.5% was afforded, which is comparable to or even better than that of the reference device with 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as HTM under equivalent conditions. Besides, TPDI can also function well in its pristine form although the efficiency (13.6%) obtained is slightly lower than that with the device containing doped TPDI as the HTM. Moreover, these newly integrated noble metal-free, vacuum-free and cost effective PSCs exhibited excellent durability during the long term stability measurements for 30 days. The remarkable performance as well as dramatically reduced fabrication cost demonstrated by integrating TPDI as the HTM and cost effective commercial carbon as the cathode revealed their great potential in the scalable and practical application of PSCs.
1. Introduction
Driven by the increasing energy demands and concerns about global warming, the exploration of clean, inexpensive and renewable sources as alternatives to conventional fossil energy has attracted worldwide attention. And the emerging photovoltaic technologies, which convert solar energy to electricity, has been considered as one of the best approaches to meet the requirements.1–3 Very recently, benefiting from the appealing advantages of intense light absorption (absorption coefficient over 104 cm−1), small binding energy (20–50 meV at room temperature), and long charge carrier diffusion length and lifetime (>1000 nm and >100 ns),4–7 hybrid organometal halide perovskites have gained considerable research attention. Highlighted by the simple structure, low production costs as well as the superb photovoltaic performances, the organometal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are propelled to the forefront of next-generation printable photovoltaics.8–16 Although very impressive performance with certified cell efficiency exceeding 20% has been achieved, advancing PSC technology towards commercial applications still requires delicate choice of materials for the whole device.17–21 The expensive hole transport materials (HTMs) and noble metal cathode materials deployed in PSCs hold back the large scale applications of PSC technologies to a great extent.
In most of the highly efficient PSCs, HTMs play an important role in facilitating charge separation and collection, which dominate the photovoltaic characteristics. It is well acknowledged that HTMs with appropriate energy level alignments and good hole transport properties favor minimization of loss in electrical potential and charge recombination, thereby alleviating the interfacial energy barriers to optimize device performances.22,23 Therefore, the development of low-cost and efficient HTMs for PSCs is highly desirable. To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly-(triarylamine) (PTAA) have ubiquitously been used as HTMs in high-efficiency PSCs.24,25 Unfortunately, the tedious synthesis and high cost of spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA may be major obstacles to the commercialization of PSCs. In this light, many HTMs based on small molecules,26–32 polymers33,34 and inorganic salts35–38 have been intensively developed as potential alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA. Among these materials, small molecules hold appealing advantages over polymer materials due to the low cost of the raw materials, easy synthesis routes and purification as well as the small batch-to-batch variations, which are compatible with large scale manufacturing. In this regard, exploration of much more cost-effective but still efficient small molecule-based HTMs is much desirable for further advancement of hybrid PSCs from the perspective of scalable production of PSCs.
Triazatruxene (TAT), in which three indole units are combined by one benzene ring, can be considered as an extended delocalized π-system. Owing to its unique discotic π-extended and electron-rich aromatic structure, this C3 symmetric fused indole trimer has been widely used to produce electroactive discotic liquid crystalline materials (high stability),39,40 organic-light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),41 and two-photon absorption (TPA) materials.42 It also usually serves as a building block for the construction of largely conjugated HTM molecules for organic solar cells due to its superb hole transport ability.43,44 These appealing advantages make it a promising core moiety for the construction of alternative HTMs for highly efficient PSCs. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, investigation and application of TAT-based HTMs in PSCs have seldom been reported.
In addition, cathode materials, such as Au or Ag, may be another barrier in the development of PSCs. These noble metal materials are usually very expensive as raw materials, fabricated under high-energy consuming vacuum conditions, and easily corroded by halogen ions to induce instability of the whole photovoltage device. To tackle these issues, some novel hole-collecting materials have been developed for PSCs.45–50 Among these materials, investigation on carbon materials has revealed their great potential for photovoltaic application. Featuring a suitable Fermi level (−5.0 eV), earth abundance, low cost, good electrical conductivity, printable-processability and superior environmental stability, carbon based PSCs appear to be quite compatible with the present industrial large scale and low-cost production.47 To date, however, high temperature (>400 °C) sintering is usually necessary in the fabricating procedures of carbon cathodes, which is not conducive to practical applications of PSCs.51 In previous work, low temperature (100 °C) processed carbon, possessing all of the aforementioned advantages of carbon materials, was introduced as the cathode material for PSCs to avoid the high energy consumption in the sintering process and demonstrated high stability.52 However, the interfacial energy barriers at the perovskite/carbon interfaces impede the charge-collecting efficiency of carbon and cause undesirable charge accumulation, thereby restricting the optimization of performances. Therefore, interfacial engineering is urgently required to minimize potential loss and facilitate charge collection. However, to the best of our knowledge, interfacial optimization in these carbon cathode based PSCs has been neglected.
Inspired by the TAT derivatives' proven strong intramolecular charge transfer characteristic, easily tunable energy levels, facile preparations, high thermal stability, as well as compatibility with electrodes, and motivated by the advantages of low temperature processed carbon, this study communicates a strategy to eliminate the energy barrier issues that occur at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface. Herein, we report a kind of noble metal-free, vacuum-free, cost-effective, very stable and highly efficient PSCs integrating a novel HTM 5,10,15-triphenyl-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole (TPDI) (as shown in Fig. 1c) and a low temperature printable carbon cathode. TPDI exhibited excellent thermal stability, good solubility, high hole mobility as well as compatible energy alignment with CH3NH3PbI3 and the carbon cathode. And this well assembled architecture was found out to be suitable in an interfacial contact regime and efficient in charge separation and hole collection. The PSCs containing doped TPDI as HTM demonstrated an efficiency of 15.5%, which is even better than that of the reference device with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM under equivalent conditions. Meanwhile, TPDI can also function well in its pristine form and gives an efficiency of 13.6%. The photoluminescence (PL) analysis revealed its outstanding performance in facilitating charge separation and transportation, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement uncovered its excellent property in preventing charge recombination. Moreover, dramatically improved stability was also demonstrated in 30 days stability tests. To date, this is the first trial in engineering the interfaces of carbon-based PSCs with an organic selective contactor. Meanwhile, the work presented here provides an approach for realizing noble metal-free, vacuum-free, low-cost, printable, stable and highly efficient perovskite solar cells to address scalability issues encountered in harvesting solar energy.

2. Results and discussions
2.1. Optical, electronic, and thermal characterizations of TPDI
The TAT core based HTM termed TPDI was synthesized through a simple process with low cost by adoption of a relevant literature method.44 The synthesis route of TPDI and experimental details are depicted in the ESI (see Scheme S1†). The TPDI was fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectroscopy. To obtain an HTM with high thermal stability to be compatible with the low temperature (100 °C) sintered carbon cathode, the TPDI was designed to possess a high glass transition temperature (Tg) value by reducing the alkyl chain and attaching phenyl rings to ensure the morphological stability of HTM when undergoing the sintering process. Furthermore, the resultant TPDI exhibits good solubility in commonly used organic solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, chloroform and dichloromethane, which is compatible with the simple solution processable spin-coating technology.
The ultraviolet to visible (UV-vis) absorption spectrum and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum of TPDI in chloroform are depicted in Fig. 1a. As shown in the UV-vis spectrum, the absorption band of TPDI is mainly located in the UV range and peaks at 314 nm, which should be attributed to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated π-electron system. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum of TPDI shows maximum emission at 394 nm. The optical band gap of TPDI was determined from the onset of the absorption spectrum at 3.31 eV. The literature data of spiro-OMeTAD are summarized in Table 1 for comparison. We can find that both the absorption and emission spectra of TPDI are blue shifted relative to spiro-OMeTAD.54

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also carried out to gain insight into the structure–property relationship of TPDI. From the calculated results shown in Fig. 1c, the optimized structure of TPDI demonstrated a planar configuration with three twisted benzene rings attached to the TAT core. This planar configuration guaranteed good π–π stacking in the film state. In addition, the electron distribution in the HOMO level revealed that most of the electrons were located on the planar TAT core, thereby good charge transportation could be expected. Moreover, once excited by sunlight to the LUMO level, electrons transfer to phenyl rings, indicating that the TPDI can facilitate effective charge separation at HOMO and LUMO.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of TPDI in dilute chloroform solutions containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte in a three-electrode system. The CV plot shown in Fig. 2a reveals that TPDI undergoes single reversible one-electron oxidation processes with a half potential at +0.51 V vs. Fc/Fc+. Therefore, the HOMO energy level can be calculated on the basis of the following equation: EHOMO = −4.8 − (Eox − E1/2(Fc/Fc+)), where Eox is the onset oxide potential (vs. E1/2(Fc/Fc+)).55 Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of TPDI is estimated to be −5.31 eV, being slightly higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.07 eV).53 The HOMO level of TPDI could well match with the valence band (VB) of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV) and the carbon cathode (−5.0 eV), which is energetically favorable for hole transportation from the perovskite to the HTM layer and hole collection from TPDI to carbon (see Fig. 1b). Furthermore, since the Voc of the solar cell is mainly governed by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the electron acceptor (mesoporous-TiO2) and the HOMO level of the HTM as well as electron–hole recombination rate, TPDI could be expected to afford a higher Voc than spiro-OMeTAD. Besides, the LUMO level of TPDI (−2.00 eV) is higher than the conduction band (CB) of CH3NH3PbI3, which could block the electron transportation from CH3NH3PbI3 to the carbon cathode and hence suppress carrier recombination.56

The hole mobility of TPDI was evaluated by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement under dark conditions, and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. S1.† It is found that the hole mobility (μ) of TPDI is calculated to be 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is two orders of magnitude greater than that of spiro-OMeTAD (4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).53 This high hole mobility could be ascribed to the good π–π stacking of TPDI in the film state and the proven high charge-carrier mobility of the TAT core.57 Besides, the high mobility guaranteed efficient charge transportation and minimized energy loss in terms of the electric potential.
The thermal properties of TPDI were investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and the corresponding data are displayed in Fig. 2b. We can find that the thermal stability of TPDI is excellent. The melting temperature (Tm) appears at 352 °C and decomposition temperature (Td) ranges up to 420 °C, respectively. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of TPDI did not appear even after repeating the experiment several times. These results revealed the good morphological stability and thermal stability of TPDI, which are favorable for practical application in scalable production.
2.2. Photovoltaic cell assembly with TPDI
The PSC devices were fabricated following the layout given in Fig. 3a, and the relative energy levels of different layers are shown in Fig. 1b. Detailed device fabrication procedures are described in the ESI.† UV-vis absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were deployed to characterize the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 films. As shown in Fig. S2a,† the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 film gave a broad and strong absorption band over the whole visible range, indicating efficient light absorption of the as-prepared perovskite films. The X-ray diffraction peak positions for CH3NH3PbI3 demonstrated in Fig. S2b† agree well with the known patterns for the CH3NH3PbI3 tetragonal perovskite structure. The strong reflections at 14.08, 28.41, 31.85, 40.3 and 43.19 degree originate from the lattice plane in the (110), (220), (310), (224) and (330) directions, respectively.58 In addition, the absence of the characteristic peak of PbI2 at 12.65 degree in the present perovskite film suggests complete conversion of PbI2.15

High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) was employed to analyze the film qualities of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 3c, CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits uniform morphology and full surface coverage with an average grain size of ∼300 nm. The cross-sectional image of a typical device with doped TPDI as a hole conductor shown in Fig. 3b confirms that the device configuration is a well-defined layer-by-layer structure. The overlayer of TPDI is seen to uniformly cap the perovskite layer (see Fig. S3a and S3b†). The thickness of mp-TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3, doped TPDI layer and carbon cathode are determined to be 300 nm, 500 nm, 150 nm, and 10 μm, respectively. Here, the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is thick enough to guarantee efficient light absorption and charge carrier extraction due to its long carrier diffusion length and good charge transport properties.
2.3. Photovoltaic performances with different HTMs
The photovoltaic performance of the PSC based on the HTM TPDI was analyzed by photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and incident to photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The solar cells were fabricated comprising fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/TPDI/carbon in the presence of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (t-BP) as additives in the HTM layer. For comparison, PSC devices without HTMs and with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM were also fabricated under the same conditions. It is worth mentioning that all devices based on various HTMs were fabricated with the same low temperature processed printable carbon as the cathode material. Fig. 4 presents the J–V curves of PSCs utilizing different HTMs and the photovoltaic parameters measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 2. The device without any HTM demonstrates a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.1 mA cm−2, an open circuit (Voc) of 0.93 V, a fill factor (FF) of 67.2%, and results in an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, which is consistent with previous reports.52 With the introduction of doped TPDI as the HTM, the performance of PSCs was dramatically enhanced and displayed a Jsc of 20.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.03 V and FF of 74.9%, yielding a remarkable PCE of 15.5%, which is also one of the highest efficiencies obtained to date for carbon counter electrode based perovskite solar cells. Under similar conditions, the device containing spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM produced a Jsc of 20.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.02 V, and a FF of 72.9%, corresponding to a comparable PCE of 15.1%. We can come to the conclusion that the performances of low temperature processed carbon based PSCs can be considerably boosted by introducing appropriate HTMs, which eliminate the energy barrier and accelerate charge separation and hole collection. Moreover, the higher Voc of the TPDI based device should be partially ascribed to the deeper HOMO level of TPDI than spiro-OMeTAD, and the higher FF may be related to the smaller serial resistance and larger shunt resistance of TPDI based devices than those of spiro-OMeTAD, which are derived from the greater hole mobility and conductivity of TPDI as well as better capability in preventing charge recombination resulting from the higher LUMO level than spiro-OMeTAD (see Table 2).

Motivated by the idea of further reducing the manufacturing cost, the pristine form of TPDI without any p-type dopant was also applied to fabricate PSC devices. The corresponding J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 4 and related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best cell containing pristine TPDI as the HTM affords a Voc of 1.03 V, Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.8%, leading to a PCE of 13.6% under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. This exciting result revealed its great potential application in dopant-free PSCs. Meanwhile, the spiro-OMeTAD based device exhibited poor performance, especially in terms of Jsc and FF, and resulted in a PCE of 10.8%. This inferior performance of the pristine spiro-OMeTAD based device was reconfirmed by the larger serial resistance and smaller shunt resistance than TPDI (see Table 2). Besides, the poor performance may stem from the relative poor ability of pristine spiro-OMeTAD in charge transportation, and its intrinsic low mobility and conductivity. This observation is in line with the recent report indicating the poor performance of spiro-OMeTAD in the absence of a p-type dopant.32 Moreover, the effects induced by different thicknesses of the carbon CE on the photovoltaic performance were also investigated and the results are summarized in Fig. S4 and Table S1,† from which we find that the conductivity of the 10 μm thick carbon CE is good enough for hole collection and transportation.
To get an insight into the significant role played by HTMs, incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs with and without HTMs were recorded and are shown in Fig. 5. It was quite distinct that the introduction of both TPDI and spiro-OMeTAD HTMs gave a significant improvement of the IPCE in the whole visible region between 400 and 800 nm due to the more effective charge collection/extraction. The effective charge extraction decreases the carrier density within the bulk perovskite material which eventually brings down the rate of recombination. Resulting from the insufficient capacity in facilitating charge separation and collection, the pristine HTMs demonstrated lower IPCE values, thereby inducing a smaller Jsc. Moreover, integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectra of doped and pristine TPDI-based PSCs shown in Fig. S5† yielded integrated Jsc values of 19.9 mA cm−2 and 18.6 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the Jsc values obtained from J–V measurements as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2.

The hysteresis behavior of doped TPDI based PSCs in J–V curves has also been evaluated and the results are summarized in Fig. S6 and Table S2.† A tiny difference in J–V curves was observed, and a PCE of 14.8% was achieved by averaging the forward and backward I–V curves.
2.4. Dynamic photoluminescence spectroscopy
So far we have demonstrated that hole extraction and transport are strongly dependent on the HTMs. To take a look into the charge extraction, we measured charge generation of the perovskite film via steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay characterizations. The normalized steady-state PL spectra of glass/CH3NH3PbI3, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/doped-TPDI, glass/CH3NH3PbI3/pristine-TPDI, and glass/CH3NH3PbI3/doped-spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 6a and S7.† Under the same experimental conditions, all samples exhibit a PL peak at 775 nm arising from the perovskite, which is consistent with the reported results.5 Interfacing the perovskite with different HTMs, significant quenching effects (over 90% of the original PL was quenched) were observed, indicating efficient charge transfer at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/HTM. In addition, it is noticeable that the doped TPDI demonstrated the strongest quenching effects, which reveals its excellent capability in hole extraction owing to the high interfacial film quality arising from the excellent π–π stacking induced by the TAT core and the high mobility of TPDI. Meanwhile, doped spiro-OMeTAD exhibits a slightly higher quenching effect than pristine TPDI. In order to evaluate the hole extraction rate, TRPL decay was further performed via monitoring the peak emission at 775 nm, and the related data are collected in Fig. 6b. By fitting the data with the two-component exponential decay (the dominating lifetime was used for comparison), we find that the neat CH3NH3PbI3 film exhibits the longest PL lifetime of 94 ns, which is in good agreement with a previous report.4,5 The PL lifetimes are substantially shortened to 4.7 ns, 5.5 ns and 6.1 ns, when the perovskite film is in contact with doped TPDI, doped spiro-OMeTAD and pristine TPDI, respectively. A smaller lifetime indicates a faster hole-diffusion process and more efficient hole-extraction at the CH3NH3PbI3/TPDI interface. These high hole-extraction and transport rates contribute significantly to the high Jsc value for PSCs with TPDI as the HTM, basically, in line with the experimental results of J–V and IPCE measurements.

2.5. Dynamic impedance spectroscopy
Carrier recombination is considered as one of the major loss channels in photovoltaic cells. To probe the corresponding influence induced by HTMs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted on the completed devices under working conditions. Representative impedance spectra of PSC devices by employing doped/pristine TPDI and doped spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs were recorded at different applied voltages over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz under simulated AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The Nyquist plots shown in Fig. S8† were fitted following a previously reported equivalent circuit and the corresponding results are summarized in Fig. 7.59 The Nyquist results demonstrated two arcs separated in frequency. The higher frequency features of the impedance spectra revealed the events of hole transport where the holes were injected from the HTMs to the carbon cathode, whereas, the remaining spectra in the lower frequency region contain information on charge recombination.46,60,61 The value of hole transport resistance (RCT) represented in Fig. 7 shows a lower RCT for doped TPDI than for doped spiro-OMeTAD, indicating a better capability in facilitating hole transportation from doped TPDI to the carbon cathode. The higher RCT for pristine TPDI than for doped spiro-OMeTAD should be attributed to the relatively low conductivity of TPDI compared to the doped form of spiro-OMeTAD. In contrast, the larger recombination resistance (RREC) of the device with doped TPDI than with doped-spiro-OMeTAD at the same forward bias voltage suggests that TPDI as the HTM is superior to spiro-OMeTAD in preventing charge recombination. The larger RREC is supposed to favor the improvement of the photovoltaic performance, which is reflected as higher Voc and FF listed in Fig. 4 and Table 2.

2.6. Reproducibility and stability of PSCs with TPDI as the HTM
In addition, the reproducibility of the cells' performance based on TPDI was evaluated by testing the photovoltaic parameters of a same batch of ten devices. The statistics of the device performance characteristics of solar cells with doped TPDI and pristine TPDI as HTMs are presented in Tables S3 and S4.† The resulting device performances yielded average efficiency of 14.7% and 13.0% for doped and pristine TPDI based solar cells, respectively. In addition, the standard deviation of PCE for the cells with doped and pristine form of TPDI is 0.49% and 0.29%, respectively. These results indicate good reproducibility in our study.
Finally, the stability of PSC devices incorporating TPDI (doped and pristine) as the HTM and low temperature processed carbon as the cathode was investigated. The stabilities of ten devices for each HTM were monitored without encapsulation under ambient conditions (average relative humidity 42 ± 12%, average temperature 26 ± 5 °C), and illuminated by natural light from 8:00 am to 18:00 pm in an outdoor environment every day. Fig. 8 displays the changes in photovoltaic performances during the long-term stability tests for the corresponding PSCs, from which we can conclude that both sets of devices demonstrated excellent stability. Specifically, after aging under natural sunlight for 30 days, the efficiency of doped-TPDI degraded from the initial 14.9% to 12.3%, giving 17.4% reduction, which is mainly due to the reduction in Jsc and FF. The underlying reasons for this reduction in Jsc and FF for the doped TPDI based PSC could be ascribed to the deliquescent behavior of LiTFSI and the proved detriment of the perovskite structure by t-BP induced by the doping technology in device fabricating procedures, which is confirmed by a previous report.30 In contrast, the pristine TPDI presented a smaller reduction of 4.6% with a PCE change from 13.0% to 12.4%. The better stability of pristine TPDI than its doped form may be attributed to the good molecular stability and hydrophobic behavior of TPDI. Besides, the low temperature processed carbon cathode with proven high stability and chemical inertness functioned as a water-retaining layer to protect the perovskite layer from being destroyed by ambient moisture. Both the pristine TPDI and the carbon cathode played significant roles in guaranteeing the high stability of PSCs in our study. Meanwhile, stability comparison between the TPDI and spiro-OMeTAD based perovskite films and devices was also carried out and the corresponding results are summarized in Fig. S9 and S10† respectively. The results indicate that the TPDI based samples have better resistivity to the environment moisture than spiro-OMeTAD. As shown in the photographs in Fig. S9,† the spiro-OMeTAD based samples gradually degraded to pale yellow of PbI2, while the TPDI based sample retained its original dark brown color even after 30 days aging test. Moreover, the aging test of the spiro-OMeTAD based device demonstrated faster efficiency degradation than TPDI based devices even with the protection of the water retaining layer of the carbon counter electrode.

The cells were stored in an ambient atmosphere, exposed to natural light outdoor every day, and measured under one sun illumination (average relative humidity 42 ± 12%, average temperature 26 ± 5 °C). 
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a kind of noble metal-free, vacuum-free, cost effective, extremely stable and highly efficient PSCs by incorporating a novel HTM, TPDI, and low temperature processed carbon as the cathode. This newly explored HTM, TPDI, can be synthesized by a simple and facile route with low cost. Detailed studies revealed its good solubility, excellent thermal stability, high hole mobility and suitable energy level alignment with CH3NH3PbI3 and the carbon cathode. The photovoltaic characteristics of TPDI based PSCs were systematically compared with those of spiro-OMeTAD based ones. TPDI can work well both in doped and pristine forms and optimized PCEs of 15.5% and 13.6% were achieved, respectively, which are comparable to or even better than those of the devices employing doped or pristine spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM under equivalent conditions. Besides, steady state PL quenching, TRPL decay, and EIS studies revealed the excellent capability in facilitating charge separation, accelerating hole transportation and preventing charge recombination of TPDI, respectively. Moreover, TPDI based PSCs exhibited excellent durability during the long term stability measurements for 30 days. Our results provide compelling evidences for the first time that organic small molecule HTMs have great potential for application in highly efficient carbon cathode based PSCs. Meanwhile, the simple solution process in spin-coating HTMs as well as convenient low temperature printing process in depositing the carbon cathode simplified the fabrication processes and reduced the manufacturing cost considerably. This work presented an approach to realize scalable and industrial production of PSCs with low cost and high efficiency.
