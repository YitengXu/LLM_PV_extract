    , Accepted 7th January 2021First published on 7th January 2021AbstractCu could reduce CO2 into considerable amounts of hydrocarbons, the relative low efficiency and poor selectivity of which should be improved. Engineering the surface strain is a powerful method to improve the catalytic performance, however, generally clouded by the ensemble effect and ligand effect. In this research, we show how the elastic strain in Cu nanofilms varies the activity and selectivity of CO2RR by virtue of the two-way shape memory effect of the NiTi substrate. For a 32 nm Cu overlayer, tensile strain improved the total CO2RR faradaic efficiency from 65.02% to 76.48% and favored CH4 generation. For a 5 nm Cu overlayer, strain impacted both HER and CO2RR activities, where compressive strain induced more available active sites for CO2 adsorption and resulted in 27% higher faradaic efficiency toward the CO2RR. Based on DFT calculations and the derived positive correlation between free energy change and the energy barrier, the mechanism of strain-controlled electrocatalytic performance was also revealed.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals and fuels in aqueous solutions, especially if driven by renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, is an attractive strategy to not only mitigate the excess CO2 levels in the atmosphere but also to store renewable energy.1–3 Copper is the only monometallic electrocatalyst capable of reducing CO2 into considerable amounts of hydrocarbons at present,4 yet its low efficiency and poor selectivity are problems to be solved in order to make this process technologically viable.5 To enhance the reaction efficiency, rational design of highly active and robust Cu-based (Cu–M) electrocatalysts to strengthen the adsorption and activation of inert CO2 is important, which can be boosted by the fundamental understanding of the correlations between structure and properties.6 To this end, numerous studies have focused on the understanding of the size,7 facets,8 morphology,9 and alloying effects10 in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. To increase the reaction selectivity, no effective and universal methods have been reported; instead, case studies have shown the importance of initial oxidation states11–13 (including residual subsurface oxygen and unconverted Cu+ states) and high curvature morphologies13–15 for the improved selectivity.
Surface strain, which is commonly generated by the lattice mismatch between different kinds of compositions in surface alloys, core–shell structures or overlayer systems, is present extensively in heterogeneous catalysts. Engineering the surface strain has shown to be a powerful method to improve the catalytic activity of materials, since the electronic structure could be effectively modified by the elastic strain. Strain-engineered electrocatalysts have been reported in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),16 hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),17 formic acid oxidation (FAOR),18 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).19 Few studies has involved the strain effect in the design of Cu-based (CuM) electrocatalysts for CO2RR; yet, several studies have shown implicitly that surface strain could also be used as an vital knob to tune the catalytic performance in CO2RR. For example, Cu overlayers of various thicknesses on polycrystalline Pt have shown thickness-dependent activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction;20 Au@Cu core–shell nanoparticles have shown thickness-dependent activity and selectivity with higher selectivity towards C2H4 formation for 7–8 layer Cu;21 CuAg surface alloys have been found to be more selective for multi-carbon carbonyl-containing products.22 However, for all the previous studies illustrated above, the effect of strain on Cu is clouded by the ensemble effect and ligand effect. The ensemble effect (or synergistic effect) is derived from the presence of Cu and M atoms (e.g., Ag for CuAg surface alloys) on the surface of the catalyst, where Cu and M have different mechanistic functionalities. The ligand effect arises when the electronic structure of Cu is modified by a neighbouring M atom. These two effects require the M atom to be on the surface or in the first (or second) subsurface layer.23 By contrast, the strain effect can alter the electronic structure and induce catalytic performance improvement of Cu even when M atoms are buried at depths greater than 5 nm.16,24 Considering that M atoms on the surface or in the first few subsurface layers are easily etched away during electrochemical cycling or place-exchanged with Cu during the morphology reconstruction process, the role of the strain effect is more significant than the other two effects for CO2 electroreduction under real service conditions.
Generally, lattice mismatch between the overlayer and substrate was used to induce strain, in which only tensile or compressive strain could be applied. In this paper, both tensile and compressive strains were successfully applied to Cu overlayers by virtue of the two-way shape memory effect (SME) of the NiTi substrate. All the Cu/NiTi samples under different strain states (pristine unstrained, compressively strained, and tensilely strained) studied here are composed of the polycrystalline Cu nanofilm and NiTi substrate; thus, ligand effects, if present (no ensemble effect here as NiTi has no CO2RR activity), would be almost excluded when considering the strain effects of Cu toward CO2 electroreduction. Thus, this simple and universal method could induce elastic strain to catalytic overlayers and enable the independent strain effect on the activity and selectivity to be revealed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 SMA preparation and characterization
The polycrystalline NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) ingot with a composition of Ti-50.0 at% Ni was prepared by vacuum induction melting and then forged into a ribbon with a thickness of 20 mm. The ribbon was further rolled into a 1 mm-thick sheet. After annealing at 600 °C for 20 min, the NiTi sheet was tensile deformed to 13.3% and then unloaded at room temperature for the training of the two-way shape memory effect. Thermal dilatation measurement was carried out to characterize the two-way SME of the NiTi SMA using a Netzsch DIL 402EP dilatometer. The pre-deformed NiTi with 25 mm × 2 mm × 1 mm in size was used, and the heating rate was controlled at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −100 °C to 200 °C. The specimens 10 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm in size were cut from the pre-deformed NiTi sheet using a wire-cut electrical discharge machine. The NiTi sheet was then cleaned and polished until the surface roughness reached the nanometer scale by using both rough grinding (choosing abrasive paper from 600 grit to 3000 grit in sequence) and elaborated polishing (using 5 μm, 1 μm, 0.05 μm and 0.02 μm alumina suspension in sequence as the polishing agent).
2.2 Cu overlayer deposition
Copper overlayers were prepared by careful electrodeposition in 250 mM CuSO4 + 50 mM H2SO4 aqueous solution purged with argon at −0.295 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.015 V vs. RHE) for 3 s and 20 s, respectively. The thickness d of the deposited layer was calculated using eqn (1) below, the deposited charge Q of which was estimated by integration of the I–t signal of chronoamperometry. The density of copper (ρ = 8.92 g cm−3), the molar mass of copper (MCu = 63.55 g mol−1), the elementary charge (z = 2) and the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C mol−1) were also used. After deposition, the electrode was taken out and rinsed gently with deionized water. The calculated thickness of 3 s and 20 s deposited copper layers were about 5 nm and 32 nm, respectively, as indicated in Table S1 in the ESI.† The calculated copper thickness is likely an average value due to the possibility of three-dimensional cluster growth. The surface morphology of the electrodeposited Cu nanofilm was homogeneous and completely covering, as shown in Fig. S1 of ESI.† (1)
2.3 Crystal structure and strain state determination
Grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) with Co K-alpha radiation was employed to analyze the crystal structure of the Cu/NiTi sample. The technique parameters are set as ω = 190°, φ = 0°, χ = 55°. Jade software was used for peak identification and analysis. The elastic strain states of Cu were revealed by comparing its strongest peak position, and the strain value was calculated by eqn (2), where d0 indicated the corresponding d-spacing value of the pristine Cu calculated from Bragg's law after Gaussian fit of the peak. (2)
2.4 Electrochemical active surface area measurements
Electrochemical capacitance of the samples was determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 7 different scan rates in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3, pH 6.8, as the electrolyte. Non-faradaic responses were measured in potential ranges of 0.10 V around the open circuit potential (OCP). All currents in this region were assigned to double-layer charging. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance CDL could be calculated according to eqn (3) as: CDL = I/ν(3)where I is the charging current and ν is the scan rate. The reported value of 28 μF (ref. 25) was used for Cs as the specific capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface of polycrystalline Cu; thus, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined by using eqn (4): ECSA = CDL/Cs(4)
2.5 Electrocatalytic measurements
CO2 electroreduction was performed in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (pH 6.8) at ambient temperature in a two compartment H-type cell separated by an ion exchange membrane (Nafion 117). The electrolyte solution was purified by pre-electrolysis with a Pt-black electrode before use. A standard three-electrode system was used employing a Cu/NiTi working electrode with a size of 10 × 4 mm2 (geometric area was limited with silicon glue), a Pt mesh counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (1 M) reference electrode. All electrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, CH Instrument). All the potentials given in this paper have been converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and corrected for IR drop. The potential conversion formula was ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.235 V + 0.059 × pH. The technique of constant-potential electrolysis was applied, and the obtained chronoamperometry data were corrected for IR drop automatically by the potentiostat. The allowed compensation level was set to be 90% of the measured solution resistance for avoiding over-compensation. The reaction was performed with 20 cm3 min−1 of CO2 (purity 99.9%) continuously flowing into the electrolyte. Gas-phase products were quantitatively determined using a gas chromatograph (FULI 9790II, China) that was connected to the outlet of the H-type electrochemical cell in real time. The gas chromatography columns led directly to a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. The liquid products were measured after electrolysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu 2010H, Japan) equipped with a SUPELCOGEL™ C-610H column (Sigma Aldrich, USA).
The faradaic efficiency (FE) of certain reaction products was calculated using eqn (5), where e is the number of electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant, Q is the charge obtained by integration of the I–t signal of chronoamperometry, and n is the total amount of product in moles. For gaseous products, n was calculated according to eqn (6), where γ (vol%) is the volume concentration at a given sampling time, G (cm3 min−1) is the gas flow rate, t (min) is electrolysis time, and P = 1.01 × 105 Pa, R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1, T = 293.15 K. (5) (6)
2.6 Computational method
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), employing the projected augmented wave (PAW) method.26 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional27 was used to describe the exchange and correlation effect. For all the cases, the cutoff energy was set to be 450 eV, and the convergence criterion of energy was 10−6 eV. 9 × 9 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids were set to perform the density of states (DOS) calculations. Cu slabs were constructed as five layers with a 3 × 3 supercell with the bottom two layers frozen. A 15 Å vacuum layer was applied in the z-direction of the slab models, preventing the vertical interactions between slabs. The elastic strain state was realized isotropically to the Cu (111) slab by increasing (for tensile strain state) or decreasing (for compressive strain state) its lattice spacing d0 to the specific value d′ according to the strain magnitude ε, as d′ = (1 + ε) × d0.
Binding energies (BEs) of the important adsorbates (*COOH, *CO and *CHO) were computed using total energies of the 1/2 H2 molecule, 1/2 graphene, and (H2O–H2) to reference each H, C, and O atom, respectively.28 The free energy change ΔGreac associated with a step in the CO2RR mechanism was obtained using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE),29 as shown in eqn (7): ΔGreac = ΔEreac + ΔEzpe + Δ∫CpdT − TΔS + ΔGU(7)ΔEreac is the reaction energy including the solvation effects and ΔEzpe, ∫CpdT, and TΔS are the net zero-point energy, heat capacity, and entropic corrections, respectively. The term ΔGU = n × e × U introduces the dependence on the electrical potential U with respect to the RHE, and in this paper, U = 0 V.
3. Results
3.1 Cu overlayer deposition and obtaining three elastic strain states
The pre-treatment of the NiTi SMA substrate for obtaining the two-way shape memory effect was conducted following similar procedures as reported in our previous work.30 The NiTi sheet was first tensile deformed to 13.3% in its martensitic state at room temperature (engineering stress–strain curve is shown as Fig. S2 in the ESI†), during which process NiTi martensite elastic deformed, reoriented and further plastic deformed.31 Taking advantage of the two-way SME of the NiTi substrate, the Cu nanofilm deposited on NiTi is likely to be tensilely elastic-strained and compressively elastic-strained if the overlayer-substrate interfacial bonding is strong enough. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the electrodeposited Cu nanofilm on the pristine NiTi substrate is represented as the P (pristine unstrained) state, since the lattice mismatch of Cu and NiTi was relaxed from the interface to the surface layer by layer. Next, the P state sample was heated to 200 °C and returned to room temperature in a vacuum to produce the CS (compressively strained) state by means of contraction of the NiTi substrate. Similarly, the NiTi substrate was heated to 200 °C followed by returning to room temperature in a vacuum; then, a Cu nanofilm was deposited and further cooled to a temperature ≤−100 °C and finally returned to room temperature to produce the TS (tensilely strained) state. In a word, P, CS, and TS states of the Cu nanofilm were obtained respectively by virtue of the two-way SME of NiTi upon different thermal cycling treatments. As shown in Fig. 1b, large length changes of NiTi occur during its thermal-induced reversible phase transformation, which contributed to the largest contraction of 7.5% upon heating and the largest expansion of 3.5% in the cooling process, respectively.

(a) Schematic procedures for Cu/NiTi sample preparation and strain-inducing methods; (b) thermal dilatation measurement of NiTi after 13.3% pre-strained treatment, in which P, TS and CS indicate the pristine, tensilely strained and compressively strained states of Cu overlayers deposited on NiTi; (c) GIXRD pattern of a 32 nm Cu/NiTi substrate sample under P, TS and CS states, and the enlargement of the Cu (111) diffraction peak was also shown inserted. 
Cu overlayers remained completely covering on the substrate without cracks or exfoliation after thermomechanical treatments. The ECSA of different strain state Cu varied in the sequence CS Cu > P Cu > TS Cu (see more details in Fig. S3, S4 and Table S2 in the ESI†). The crystal structure of 32 nm Cu overlayers on the NiTi substrate under three strained states upon the aforementioned treatments is characterized by grazing-incident X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. 1c, diffraction peaks from the NiTi substrate and Cu nanofilm were both detected. Besides NiTi monoclinic martensitic diffraction peaks, four obvious peaks belonged to the cubic structured Cu and their positions varied upon different strain states. Gaussian fits were employed to determine the peak positions, and as illustrated by the enlarged view of the Cu (111) peak (at around 50.7°) in Fig. 1c, the peak position of TS Cu shifted toward low angles compared to that of P state Cu; this implies a larger d-spacing and a larger lattice parameter of TS Cu according to Bragg's law and vice versa for high angle-shifted CS Cu. Computed by eqn (2), 7.5% contraction of the NiTi substrate resulted in 1.02% compressive strain of 32 nm Cu and 3.5% expansion of the NiTi substrate resulted in 0.58% tensile strain. In short, tensile elastic strain and compressive elastic strain were successfully exerted to a 32 nm Cu overlayer, although the strain value was not as large as expected. Three speculations accounting for similar phenomena including partial stress (strain) relaxation, relatively low load transfer, and intrinsic elastic strain limit of the polycrystalline Cu nanofilm were discussed in detail in our previous work.30
3.2 CO2RR activity and selectivity of 32 nm pristine Cu
As CO2RR activity and production distribution of the Cu electrocatalyst were largely related to the electrode potential,32 Cu electrode crystalline structure,33 surface morphology,34 Cu overlayer thickness,20 electrolyte,35 pH and CO2 concentration,36 and CO2 electroreduction performance of 32 nm pristine state Cu were studied at first. Amperometric i–t curves at specific potentials from −0.8 V to −1.4 V vs. RHE with 0.1 V interval were obtained in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution with continuous bubbling of CO2 at a flow rate of 20 cm3 min−1 for 60 minutes, where i is assumed to be the geometric current density. Gaseous products were real-time analyzed by gas chromatography every 10 minutes during bulk electrocatalysis. Liquid products were measured after electrolysis using HPLC.
At the beginning, potential-dependent CO2RR activity and selectivity of 32 nm pristine Cu after 60 minutes bulk electrocatalysis were studied. As shown in Fig. 2a (also in Table S3 in the ESI†), total current density correlated exponentially with the overpotentials, and Fig. 2b indicates a parabolic relationship between the current density toward CO2RR and the applied overpotentials, reaching a maximum cathodic current density of −18.97 mA cm−2 at −1.2 V. As shown in Fig. 2c (also in Table S3 and Fig. S5 in the ESI†), major CO2RR products of the 32 nm Cu nanofilm were ranked generally as CH4 > C2H4, CO > HCOO−, C2H5OH, and other products including ethane, n-propanol and acetate were only present in a trace amount and were not expatiated here. Also, over 30% FE (31.65–72.53%) of H2 in the potential range of −0.8 V to −1.4 V indicated that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 2H2O* + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−) was a competitive reaction of CO2 electroreduction reaction. Total FE of electrocatalysis fell within the range of 91.02% to 98.66% (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†), which proved the activity and efficiency of the prepared Cu-nanofilm/NiTi substrate electrode as the electrocatalyst.

(a) Total current density depending on the the cathodic potential; (b) current density for CO2 electroreduction depending on the cathodic potential; (c) faradaic efficiencies of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, formate, ethylene and ethanol at different potentials; (d) CH4/C2H4 FE ratio as a function of potential. Error bars in (a)–(c) represent the standard deviations of three independent measurements. 
As shown in Fig. 2c, generation of CH4 started from −0.9 V, and its FE exhibited a volcano-like trend against the applied potential, which increased from 3.43% to 42.76% first as the potential swept negatively from −0.9 V to −1.2 V followed by a gradual decrease to 7.80% at −1.4 V. Similarly, electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 started from −0.8 V, and the FE of C2H4 also exhibited a volcano-like trend against the potential and reached a peak value of 18.41% at −1.1 V. CO and formate were selectively produced at lower overpotentials, and the FE of CO and formate presented a relatively high value of 25.18% and 17.67% at −0.8 V and monotonically decreased along with increase in overpotentials. For the side product of hydrogen, its minimum and sub-minimum FE values were 31.65% (at −1.1 V) and 32.18% (at −1.2 V) respectively; considering that the largest current density toward CO2RR and the largest FE of CH4 were obtained at −1.2 V, a cathodic potential of −1.2 V was chosen for chronoamperometry when studying the elastic strain effects on the activity and selectivity of CO2RR in the following Section 3.3.
The potential-dependent CH4/C2H4 FE ratio during CO2RR is shown in Fig. 2d. Under the potential of −0.8 V and −0.9 V, the CH4/C2H4 ratio was less than 1.0, which indicated that C2H4 was the most favorable CO2RR product at lower overpotentials, while more CH4 was generated at higher overpotentials and changed to be the most favorable CO2RR product in the potential of −1.0 V to −1.4 V. The CH4/C2H4 FE ratio increased from 1.17 at −1.0 V to the maximum of 3.32 at −1.2 V and then decreased to 1.44 when the applied potential swept more negatively until −1.4 V. A similar product selectivity and CH4/C2H4 FE ratio have been reported for thin Cu overlayers on Pt20 and Cu films on a Cu disc electrode.37 It implies that CO2RR product selectivity of the Cu film-metallic substrate mainly depends on the properties of Cu films (composition, structure, film thickness, elastic strain state etc.), and the substrate material influenced little if the integrity and coverage of Cu films remain unchanged during reaction.
Time-dependent reaction activity and product selectivity of 32 nm pristine Cu overlayers on NiTi were then studied during 1 hour measurement. According to the results shown in Fig. 3a, a higher total current density would be obtained at a more negative potential, and all the chronoamperometry i–t curves remained almost constant during the whole reaction process, the noise-like small peaks of which arose from CO2 bubbles or gaseous product bubbles during electrocatalysis. As indicated in Fig. 3b, product distribution kept unchanged with time, and no severe deactivation was observed; while C2H4 formation still declined slightly, H2 evolution rose slowly and CH4 generation increased to a maximum in the first half hour, and then, all products remained nearly constant in the last half hour. Similar weak deactivation has been previously reported and was ascribed to the impurity of heavy metals (e.g. Fe2+ and Zn2+) originally contained in the electrolyte even after pre-electrocatalysis treatment, deposited on the Cu electrode during CO2RR.38 Given the fact that time-dependent product distribution and FE remained neatly constant in the last half hour of reaction, experimental data of Cu overlayers under different strain states after 60 minutes of bulk electrolysis were chosen and compared, aiming to clarify the elastic strain effects on the activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction on Cu.

3.3 CO2RR activity and selectivity of 32 nm strained Cu
By virtue of the two-way SME of the NiTi SMA substrate, P state, TS state and CS state 32 nm Cu overlayers were successfully obtained at room temperature. Similar electrochemical measurements were employed to discover the strain effect on the CO2 electroreduction performance. The strain and surface morphology of Cu overlayers remained almost invariant after the reaction as shown in Fig. S6 and S7 of the ESI.† Also, Cu nanofilms remained the integrity and complete coverage on the substrate. The faradaic efficiencies, current densities for CO2RR, partial current densities toward two main CO2RR products CH4 and C2H4 are presented in Fig. 4 (also shown in Table S4 of the ESI†). Fig. 4a clearly indicated that tensile strain contributed to higher faradaic efficiency for CO2RR as 76.48% at −1.2 V compared to 65.02% FE for the pristine Cu. For C1 products, tensile strained 32 nm Cu overlayers exhibited 50.64% FE for CH4 generation, 5.78% FE for CO and 3.85% FE for HCOO−, all of which were higher than those of the counterparts for the pristine 32 nm Cu overlayer as 42.76% FE for CH4, 5.02% for CO, and 2.03% for HCOO−. Comparatively, compressive strain reduced CO2RR activity to 52.97% FE and resulted in lower FE with only 32.92% FE for CH4, 4.11% for CO and 1.42% for HCOO−. Strain effects on C2 product selectivity were relatively weak, as shown in Fig. 4a. P, TS and CS Cu presented a similar C2H5OH FE and less-varied C2H4 FE. The most favorable product during CO2 electroreduction was CH4 regardless of elastic strain states. At −1.2 V, the CH4/C2H4 FE ratio was, however, slightly adjusted by strain as 3.61 for TS, 3.32 for P, and 2.68 for CS, and the strain effect on the CH4/C2H4 FE ratio was mainly attributed to the strain-induced activity variations on CH4.

(a) Faradaic efficiencies toward methane, ethylene, carbon monoxide, formate and ethanol at −1.2 V. (b) ECSA normalized current density for CO2 electroreduction at −1.0 V, −1.1 V and −1.2 V. (c) ECSA normalized partial current density toward CH4 at −1.0 V, −1.1 V and −1.2 V. (d) ECSA normalized partial current density toward C2H4 at −1.0 V, −1.1 V and −1.2 V. Data in (b)–(d) show ±σ, the standard deviations of three independent measurements. 
In addition, for the P, TS and CS Cu, ECSA normalized current density j for CO2RR and ECSA normalized partial current densities toward CH4 (iCH4) and C2H4 (iC2H4) with the standard deviation as a function of potential are shown in Fig. 4b–d, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, for each potential, TS Cu (highlighted in red) exhibited the largest current density for CO2RR as 12.56 mA cm−2, which was 37% higher than that of the P Cu (9.14 mA cm−2) and double the value for CS Cu (5.70 mA cm−2) at −1.2 V. Fig. 4c indicates strong strain effects on CH4 selectivity, wherein tensile strain contributed to 38% enhancement of iCH4 and compressive strain caused 41% reduction of iCH4. Fig. 4d showed relatively weak strain effects on C2H4 selectivity of 32 nm Cu overlayers as P, TS and CS Cu exhibited similar iC2H4, and it seems that iC2H4 was mainly varied by the cathodic potential of electrocatalysis.
It was concluded that cathodic potential and strain effects co-modulated the CO2RR activity of 32 nm Cu overlayers; C2 product (C2H4 and C2H5OH) selectivity was strain-insensitive, while C1 product (CH4, CO and HCOO−) selectivity was largely affected by strain effects, in which tensile strain enhanced partial current density of CH4 by about 38% compared to that of the pristine one.
3.4 Strain effects on the CO2RR activity and selectivity of 5 nm Cu
Since elastic strain was transferred from the NiTi substrate to the Cu overlayer, an interfacial Cu monolayer should have the largest elastic strain and the strain in each layer of Cu decreased progressively with an increase in film thickness. Thus, larger elastic strain and stronger strain effects on CO2RR were expected to be present in thinner Cu overlayers. The same electrochemical measurements were carried out on a 5 nm Cu nanofilm deposited on the same predeformed NiTi SMA substrate and then underwent the same thermal cycles to obtain P, TS, and CS 5 nm Cu overlayers.
GIXRD profiles of 5 nm Cu/NiTi samples under three strain states are shown in Fig. S8 of the ESI.† The crystalline structure of 5 nm Cu overlayers was similar to that of 32 nm Cu, which contained Cu (111) (as the strongest peak), (200), (220) and (311) diffraction peaks on GIXRD profiles. According to the variation of Cu (111) peak positions under different strain states, TS 5 nm Cu exhibited 0.83% tensile strain and CS 5 nm Cu exhibited 1.46% compressive strain, both of which were larger than the strains applied to 32 nm Cu. The ECSA of 5 nm Cu/NiTi samples is presented in Table S2 of the ESI,† indicating that 5 nm Cu overlayers were quite smooth with a roughness factor around 1. The ECSAs of P, CS and TS 5 nm Cu samples were 0.40 cm2, 0.47 cm2, 0.38 cm2 respectively.
Potential-dependent CO2RR activity and selectivity of pristine 5 nm Cu after 60 minutes of bulk electrocatalysis were studied at first; as indicated in Table S5 and Fig. S9 in the ESI,† total geometric current density exponentially increased as the potential swept negatively and was larger than the total geometric current density of the pristine 32 nm Cu at the corresponding potential. The main CO2RR products were ranked as methane > ethylene > carbon monoxide > formate, and ethanol and acetate were present in trace amounts and thus were not analyzed here. It should be noted that the HER as a competing reaction of CO2RR had more than 70% FE. This lower selectivity of 5 nm Cu overlayers toward hydrocarbons was consistent with a study by R. Reske et al. on thin Cu overlayers on the polycrystalline Pt substrate.20
Next, the strain effect on the CO2RR performance of 5 nm Cu overlayers on the NiTi substrate was studied. Unexpectedly, an opposite strain effect on the CO2RR activity of 5 nm Cu was obtained compared with that for 32 nm Cu overlayers as discussed ahead. For the pristine 5 nm Cu, as showed in Fig. 5a, the total FE for CO2RR of P, TS and CS Cu at −1.2 V was only 16.70%, 13.56% and 21.20% respectively. Faradaic efficiencies of CS Cu toward four main CO2RR products were all larger than those for the P Cu, while TS Cu showed the lowest CO2RR activity among them. The left subfigure in Fig. 5b indicates that TS Cu had an enhanced HER activity compared to that of the P Cu, the faradaic efficiency toward hydrogen evolution of which reached 83.08% at −1.2 V. In addition, the ECSA normalized partial current density for the HER of the TS Cu was also larger that of the P Cu and reached 34.34 mA cm−2 at −1.2 V, since the total current density of the TS Cu exceeds that of the P Cu (data listed in Table S6 of the ESI†). Considering such a high FE and partial current density of 5 nm Cu overlayers toward the HER, the strain effect seemed to have a greater impact on the HER instead of CO2RR. Seen from Fig. 5c, the faradaic efficiencies toward CH4 and C2H4 of 5 nm Cu in the potential from −1.0 V to −1.2 V were both ranked as CS Cu > P Cu > TS Cu, and FE of CH4 increased and FE of C2H4 reduced along with more negative potentials. The CH4/C2H4 FE ratio of P, TS and CS Cu was quite similar at each potential, as shown in Fig. 5d, which suggested that the strain effect on the CO2RR selectivity of 5 nm Cu seemed to be inefficient.

Data in (b) and (c) show ±σ, the standard deviations of three independent measurements. 
It was manifested that TS 5 nm Cu had the largest FE for hydrogen evolution and the lowest FE for CO2 electroreduction, while CS 5 nm Cu had the lowest FE for the HER and the highest FE for CO2RR within the entire potential range. As described by d-band theory,39,40 compressive strain resulted in the weaker adsorption of key intermediates during CO2RR and larger activation energy would be necessary to reduce CO2 electrochemically, which was in contrast to what was observed here for 5 nm Cu. In addition, similar opposite strain effects on CO2RR activity for two more thicknesses of Cu overlayers as 20 nm and 7 nm are shown in Table S7 and Fig. S10 of the ESI.† To reconcile this apparent inconsistency, one must consider the HER as the competitive reaction of CO2RR, especially when bearing in mind that over 70% FE for the HER of P 5 nm Cu compared to only around 30% FE for HER of P 32 nm Cu in the same potential range of −1.0 V to −1.2 V. Thus, the elastic strain effect for the HER on 5 nm Cu dominated the apparent activity and selectivity of the entire electrochemical reaction and should be primarily discussed.
According to the previously reported conclusions about elastic strain influence on the HER by the P. R. Guduru group,41 the strain effect of metals on the opposite sides of the volcano peak was reversed, i.e., compressive strain increased the catalytic activity of metals to the left of the volcano peak (e.g., Pt and Ni) and reduced that of the metals to the right (e.g., Cu and Au). Our findings of HER activity of the CS 5 nm Cu agreed well with the conclusion of Guduru's group. Taking advantage of their theoretical calculations for simple explanation here, the first step of the HER (H + * → H*) for Cu (111) was uphill as the potential-limiting step and compressive strain weakened H binding and thus rendered higher activation energy for the 1st uphill step of H* formation. Tensile strain strengthened H binding and affected oppositely. As a result, HER activity (expressed by both FE and partial current density) toward hydrogen evolution was ranked as TS Cu > P Cu > CS Cu.
Returning to the discussion of the strain effect on CO2RR of 5 nm Cu, first, we assumed that the total active sites on the Cu surface for the HER and CO2RR were the same since both reactions happened simultaneously and the vast majority of active sites were responsible for the intense HER as 2H2O* + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−. Compressive strain weakened H binding and reduced HER activity; thus, more available active sites were ready to adsorb CO2 and initiate CO2RR, which contributed to higher FE toward CO2 electroreduction than the pristine counterpart.
4. Discussion
By virtue of the two-way shape memory effect (SME) of the NiTi substrate, P, TS, and CS 32 nm Cu and 5 nm Cu overlayers were obtained, the CO2RR activities and selectivities of which were experimentally revealed in the third Results section. Further exploration of the strain effect on CO2RR performance for 32 nm Cu overlayers is needed now, since the strain effect for 5 nm is Cu intertwined with the strain-dependent HER as the intense competing reaction. Elastic strain effects for 32 nm Cu were straightforward as follows: for CO2RR activity, 0.58% tensile strain improved total activity from the pristine 65.02% FE to 74.48% FE at −1.2 V, while 1.02% compressive strain decreased it to only 52.97% FE; for CO2RR activity, FE and partial current densities toward the main products were in the order CH4 > C2H4 > CO > HCOO−, C2H5OH, and such an order kept unchanged with strain states, although the CH4/C2H4 product ratio was slightly adjusted by strain as 3.61 for TS, 3.32 for P, and 2.68 for CS at −1.2 V. Also, the strong strain effect could be seen on CH4 selectivity, wherein tensile strain contributed to 38% enhancement of iCH4 and compressive strain caused 41% reduction of iCH4. Strain effects on C2 product selectivity were relatively weak, because P, TS and CS Cu presented a similar FE toward C2H4 and C2H5OH generation.
Regarding such strain effects on CO2RR activity and selectivity, it is timely to declare the mechanism of strain effects. A typical electrocatalytic reaction generally contains several successive steps, e.g., the reaction mechanism of CO2 electroreduction to CH4 and CO considered in this work is depicted in Fig. 6a. The free energy profile at U = 0 V vs. RHE on the pristine Cu (111) is shown in Fig. 6b, free energies of which were derived from the work of Janik et al.42 It was revealed that CO2 protonation to COOH* and CO* protonation to CHO* were associated with positive free energy changes (ΔGreac). It is known that electrocatalytic activity mainly depends on the potential-limiting step (dictating the required overpotential) or rate-determining step (RDS, dictating the kinetic rate). Based on the free energy profile in Fig. 6b, the potential-limiting step for CO2 electroreduction to CH4 was CO* protonation to CHO* that is highlighted in red with the largest uphill ΔGreac. The rate-determining step was the step with the largest activation energy. Kinetic rates depend exponentially on energies (i.e., rate ∼ exp(−Q/kT)); however, it is still a challenge to evaluate the transition state and compute the potential-dependent kinetic barrier.43 Instead, a positive correlation between the free energy change ΔG and the kinetic energy barrier Q for both a single electron transfer step (O + e−1 ⇌ R) and a general electroreduction reaction (A* + H+ + e− ⇌ AH*) could be derived (see details in the ESI†).

(a) Proposed mechanistic pathway, where the asterisk represents an active site on the surface. (b) Free energy profile at 0 V, based on free energies of the elementary steps from ref. 40, where * represented an active site on the surface. The potential-limiting step was highlighted in red. 
First-principles calculations were used to study the adsorption energy of key intermediates over three elastic strain states of Cu (111) models. Experimental lattice constants for P Cu (111), 0.58% TS Cu (111) and −1.02% CS Cu (111) slab models were used. Then the adsorption energies of key intermediates including COOH*, CO* and CHO* on each slab were computed (results are shown in Table S8 of the ESI†). As indicated in Fig. 7, for COOH* and CHO*, their adsorption strength linearly increased by about 0.055 eV from −1.02% to 0.58% strain, showing strain-sensitive adsorption, while for CO*, the variation was relatively small (<0.01 eV), suggesting its strain-insensitivity. The different behaviors could be explained by examining their adsorption configurations.44 Shown by the inserted subfigures in Fig. 7, COOH* and CHO* were tilted on the surface with both C and O atoms bonded to the surface Cu atoms, whereas CO* vertically adsorb at a face-centered cubic site through the C atom. Naturally, a larger strain-dependent adsorption could be expected for COOH* and CHO* intermediates.

Insets: adsorption configurations (side view) of intermediates on the pristine Cu (111) surface, where red, white, gray and orange balls represented O, H, C, and Cu atoms, respectively. 
Nørskov's “d-band model” has successfully related the adsorption properties of key intermediates to the electronic structure of the catalyst.45 Based on the calculated d-band center (Table S8 in the ESI†), elastic strain tuned the electronic structure of Cu and led to the movement of the d-band center; expressed more accurately, tensile strain in the Cu lattice contributed to the decreasing overlap of the Cu d-band and an up-shifting of the d-band center (close to the Fermi level). This up-shifting increased surface bonding with adsorbates, and for the strain-sensitive intermediates like COOH* and CHO*, the increased adsorption energies were more obvious, while compressive strain showed the opposite effect. Thus, in the case of CO2 electroreduction to CH4, we focus on the potential-limiting step as CO* protonation to CHO*. As shown schematically in Fig. 8a, tensile strain lowered the initial state free energy of CO* + H2O from IS of the pristine Cu to IS′ of the tensilely strained Cu, and tensile strain also moved the final state free energy of CHO* from FS of the pristine Cu to the lower FS′ of the tensilely strained Cu. Free energy change ΔG expressed by FS − IS for the pristine Cu is shown in black and the corresponding ΔG′ for the tensilely strained Cu is illustrated in red. Since CHO* was strain-sensitive and CO* was strain-insensitive as indicated in Fig. 7, ΔG′ was smaller than ΔG. That is, tensile strain in Cu overlayers brought about a smaller free energy change of ΔG′. ΔG and Q were positively correlated; thus tensile strain contributed to a smaller energy barrier. Thus, the TS′ energy of tensilely strained Cu should move down to obtain a smaller Q′ than the kinetic barrier counterpart Q for the pristine Cu.

(a) Schematic free energies of the initial state IS of CO* + H2O, the transition state TS, and the final state FS of CHO* for the pristine Cu (drawn in black) and the tensilely strained Cu (drawn in red). (b) Thermodynamic free energy changes ΔG and CH4 partial current density iCH4 at −1.2 V for kinetics for the P, TS, and CS 32 nm Cu, respectively. 
Taking experimental strain-dependent CH4 partial current density iCH4 of 32 nm Cu overlayers in CO2RR at −1.2 V for the kinetics and strain-dependent free energy changes ΔG at such potential for thermodynamics, as shown in Fig. 8b, iCH4 and ΔG were negatively correlated, which was reasonable since i and Q were in a negative exponent relationship according to the Butler–Volmer equation and Q and ΔG were positively correlated. Thus, TS Cu with a smallest negative ΔG (at 0 V) for the potential-limiting step of CO* protonation to CHO* contributed to the highest CO2RR kinetic activity and selectivity toward CH4, which was consistent with the experimental results.
5. Conclusion
In this study, by virtue of the two-way SME of the NiTi substrate, the sole strain effect could be separated from the ligand effect and the activity and selectivity of CO2RR could be adjusted. After two different thermomechanical treatments, confirmed by GIXRD analysis, compressive strain and tensile strain were successfully applied to Cu overlayers respectively. For 32 nm Cu overlayers, tensile strain improved CO2RR activity by around 37% and favored CH4 generation, while compressive strain had an opposite effect. DFT calculation has proved an up-shifting of the d-band center of Cu and larger adsorption strength of key intermediates induced by tensile strain. The free energy profile based on a possible reaction mechanism of CO2 electroreduction to CH4, as the example, was used to clarify the mechanism of the strain effect on the CO2RR performance. For 5 nm Cu overlayers, in contrast, compressive strain contributed to 27% higher FE toward CO2 electroreduction activity due to the combined strain effect on both HER (primary) and CO2RR (secondary). Based on the derived positive correlation between free energy change and the energy barrier, the mechanism of strain effects was inferred as follows: elastic strain changed adsorption energy of key intermediates during CO2RR arising from the strain-induced d-band center movement, which resulted in the mutative free energy changes in the potential-limiting step and the corresponding positive-correlated energy barrier changes. A relatively smaller energy barrier corresponded to a higher CO2RR activity and more favorable selectivity to the corresponding products.

(a) Proposed mechanistic pathway, where the asterisk represents an active site on the surface. (b) Free energy profile at 0 V, based on free energies of the elementary steps from ref. 40, where * represented an active site on the surface. The potential-limiting step was highlighted in red.	 

 	Fig. 7  Adsorption energies of key intermediates (COOH*, CO* and CHO*) versus elastic strain in CO2RR on the strained Cu (111) surface. Insets: adsorption configurations (side view) of intermediates on the pristine Cu (111) surface, where red, white, gray and orange balls represented O, H, C, and Cu atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 8  Schematic diagram of the reaction energy pathway for the potential-limiting step of CH4 generation as CO* protonation to CHO* and its strain-dependent free energy changes and partial current density changes at −1.2 V. (a) Schematic free energies of the initial state IS of CO* + H2O, the transition state TS, and the final state FS of CHO* for the pristine Cu (drawn in black) and the tensilely strained Cu (drawn in red). (b) Thermodynamic free energy changes ΔG and CH4 partial current density iCH4 at −1.2 V for kinetics for the P, TS, and CS 32 nm Cu, respectively.
