    , Accepted 11th September 2018First published on 11th September 2018AbstractWe provide in-depth insight into the role of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive in wide bandgap CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) films which results in altering the kinetics of crystal growth. A detailed experimental investigation based on structural change, electronic states and chemical analysis is carried out to determine the possible mechanism which provides the control to tune the chemical environment of the perovskite film. We experimentally verify the proposed model where iodine being a soft Lewis base has a tendency to chelate with a soft Lewis acid (lead, Pb). I–Pb chelation is evident in optical and structural studies of MAPbBr3 thin films. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies demonstrate that the electronic states of perovskite thin films can be modulated with a fractional concentration of DIO in the perovskite precursor solution. Chemical analysis using high resolution XPS of perovskite films shows the lower binding energies of bromine (Br 3d) and lead (Pb 4f) with DIO additive films, and confirmed the replacement of Br− with I− in agreement with UPS, optical and structural studies. A prominent appearance of an additional hump next to the Pb 4f peak in the film without the DIO additive is due to metallic lead's presence in the film, which acts as a bulk trap in the perovskite film. Hence, incorporation of DIO into the perovskite precursor solution reduces the recombination centers, which enhances the performance of perovskite solar cells and light emitting diodes.
1. Introduction
In recent years, hybrid perovskite (MAPbX3; MA = CH3NH3; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) materials have emerged as a promising candidate as an active layer in the regime of solar cells and have led to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) higher than 20%.1–3 MAPbI3 emerges as of wide interest in the field of perovskite photovoltaics (PVs) because of its small exciton binding energy (∼25 meV),4 high optical absorption, high carrier mobility and large diffusion length (LD ∼ 100 nm) of the holes and electrons.5LD can be up to 1 μm in chlorine (Cl−)–iodine (I−) mixed halide hybrid perovskites (MAPbI3−xClx).6 The tunable optical band gap of perovskites from UV-visible to NIR (near infra-red) makes them a potential candidate for light emitting diodes (LEDs), tandem solar cells and tunable lasers over the visible range.7 More recently, our group and others have shown high performance green and red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs).8,9 In the literature, there are various processing techniques including one-step solution deposition,10,11 two-step sequential deposition,12,13 vapor assisted solution deposition,14 vacuum deposition and atomic layer deposition2 used to improve the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite thin films. The perovskite film morphology and crystallinity can be affected by nucleation and growth rates of the deposited thin film. As per the literature, partial substitution of Cl− with I− prolongs the crystallization process. The evidence of this prolonged crystallization is the requirement of 2 to 3 hours annealing time for mixed halide perovskites films.15 However, pure iodine perovskites require only less than 30 minute annealing.16
Leung et al. used hydroiodic acid (HI) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as additives to alter the crystal growth kinetics and improve the perovskite thin film quality.17 Song et al. demonstrate that the perovskite crystallinity could be improved by incorporating a 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive in the perovskite solution.18 Heo et al. retarded the nucleation time during the spin-coating process by inclusion of HBr aqueous solution in MAPbBr3/DMF solution.19 Jen and his co-workers developed a method to enhance the crystallization of the MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite by using 1,8-diidooctane (DIO) as an additive to the perovskite precursor solution.20 In another report, they show the role of the alkyl chain length by incorporating DIO, 1,4-diidobutane (DIB) and 1,10-diiododecance (DID) in order to improve the film quality.21 Most of their work was confined to device performance related studies, without providing good details on the influence of DIO on the perovskite itself. The role of DIO to affect the optical, structural, and charge transport properties, and chemical and electronic states of the MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite is not explained in good detail so far in the literature. Interestingly, the use of DIO is not only limited to the MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite but it can be also extended to other Pb based perovskites such as MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3−xIx, which contain another halide ion having higher electronegativity than I− (coming from DIO) and hard Lewis base behaviour. This approach is extremely useful for tuning of the bandgap in the desired region of the electromagnetic spectrum for display and tandem solar cell applications with resolution to known phase segregation issue.22
In this study, we report on changes in the structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties of mainly wide bandgap MAPbBr3 based perovskite thin films with the addition of different concentrations of DIO into the perovskite precursor solution. Here, we present insight into the perovskite film formation with and without (w/o) the DIO additive supported by detailed chemical and electronic state analysis (using photoelectron spectroscopy). We show that there is a favorable chemical environment to improve the film morphology by addition of DIO in the perovskite solution, which prolongs the time for film formation. We emphasize that the focus of this paper is to investigate the role of the additive in the optoelectronic properties and chemical analysis of MAPbBr3 films and connect it to device results in terms of efficiency. We have also analyzed the effect of the DIO additive on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx systems to compliment the study done on MAPbBr3.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and synthesis
PbCl2, PbI2, PbBr2, bathocuproine (BCP) and 1-8 diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. PEDOT:PSS and PC61BM were purchased from Clevios and Solenne BV, respectively. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by reacting 24 mL of methylamine (CH3NH2, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol) and 10 mL of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water) in a round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 hours with stirring. The raw precipitate was recovered by removing the solvent in a rotary evaporator at 50 °C. The raw product was washed with diethyl ether, dried in vacuum at 50 °C and dissolved in minimum possible absolute ethanol. The pure MAI recrystallized by adding diethyl ether. The recrystallized precipitate is filtered and dried in vacuum for 24 h. Similarly, methylammonium bromide (MABr) was synthesized by reacting methylamine 33 wt% in absolute ethanol (Sigma Aldrich) solution and hydrobromic acid (HBr) 47 wt% in aqueous solution (Merck) at an equal (1:1) molar ratio. The rest of the process is the same as for the synthesis of MAI.
2.2 Solution preparation
The perovskite precursor solution of MAPbI3−xClx was prepared by mixing MAI and PbCl2 in a 3:1 ratio in 40 wt% DMF and stirred overnight at room temperature. The MAPbI3 solution was prepared by mixing MAI and PbI2 in a 1:1 ratio in 40 wt% DMF and stirred overnight at room temperature. The MAPbBr3 solution was prepared by mixing 112 mg of MABr, 367 mg of PbBr2, and 78 mg of DMSO in 0.6 mL DMF and stirred overnight at room temperature. Different weight percentages of DIO are added to the perovskite precursor solution for DIO additive perovskite thin films and it is kept stirring at room temperature overnight in the case of the MAPbBr3 solution. However, for MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3, solutions were kept at 70 °C for 15 min before use. 15 mg PC61BM is dissolved in 1 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and kept at room temperature for 12 hours with stirring. 1 mg BCP is dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol and kept at 70 °C for 15 min before use.
2.3 Device fabrication
ITO coated glasses were cleaned with soap, deionized (DI) water, acetone, methanol, and isopropanol. Oxygen plasma treatment was carried out on the cleaned ITO coated glasses for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO surface under 5000 rpm for 45 s and then annealed at 120 °C for 20 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution of MAPbI3−xClx was spin-coated above the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 45 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 2 hours in a nitrogen filled glove box. The MAPbBr3 precursor solution was spin-coated in two steps: 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene is dropped on the film. After that, films are annealed at 100 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen filled glove box. PC61BM in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s and we leave the samples for 5 min at the working bench. After that BCP solution was spin-coated over the perovskite/PC61BM layer. Finally, the devices were transferred to a vacuum chamber for silver (Ag) electrode evaporation of thickness 150 nm. The device area is 4.5 mm2. Different concentrations of DIO were added to the perovskite precursor solution to study the effect of the solvent additive on MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbBr3 based perovskite solar cells and light emitting diodes.
2.4 Thin films and device characterization
All the photovoltaic measurements were carried out in ambient atmosphere. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit and AM 1.5G solar simulator after calibrating through a reference solar cell provided by ABET. Light-intensity dependent measurements were carried out under the same solar simulator using neutral density (ND) filters. All the J–V measurements were performed using a scan speed of 40 mV per s. EQE and IQE measurements were carried out to measure the photo-response as a function of wavelength using a Bentham quantum efficiency system (Bentham/PVE300).
The XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku smart lab diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). θ–2θ scans have been carried out from 5–50° with a resolution limit up to 0.001°. The structural and morphological analysis was done using a Rigaku lab spectrometer X-ray diffraction machine using Cu Kα = 1.54 Å and FESEM, respectively. Optical studies were carried out using a spectrometer (PerkinElmer LAMBDA 950) and photoluminescence (PL) spectrometer (Horiba FluoroMax 4). Steady-state PL measurement was done on thin-film in vacuum at a pressure of 10−5 mbar in a custom-made chamber. The excitation energy and wavelength were 60 nJ and 355 nm, respectively. For transient PL, a gated i-CCD (i-CCD, Andor iStar) coupled with a Shemrok spectrometer was used for detection with an excitation laser (3rd harmonic Nd:YAG with an emission wavelength of 355 nm) pulse width of 840 ps with a 1 kHz repetition rate. Steady-state current–voltage–light characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit, Keithley 2000 digital multimeter and a calibrated Si photodiode (OSI semiconductors, RS components). Surface chemical element analysis was carried out using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, KRATOS) with an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. Electronic states are derived from ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, KRATOS) with a He(I) source (21.22 eV). The chamber pressure was below 5.0 × 10−9 Torr for XPS and UPS measurements.
3. Results
3.1 Morphological study

Fig. 1a represents the crystal structure of MAPbBr3. The device structure (ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/MAPbBr3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag) with the corresponding energy level diagram of each layer used in the device is shown in Fig. 1b. DIO contains iodine (I−), which dissociates during thermal annealing and generates extra iodine. As a soft Lewis base, I− interacts with Pb2+ (a soft Lewis acid) by replacing another borderline/hard Lewis base (bromine (Br−)/chlorine (Cl−)). A schematic diagram of the ion replacement process is shown in Fig. 1c. Since the interaction between a soft Lewis acid and a soft Lewis base is more than that between a soft Lewis acid and a borderline/hard Lewis base, thus, extra I− coming from DIO can replace Br−/Cl− and chelate with Pb2+ during crystal growth.23 Images of MAPbBr3 based perovskite precursor solutions and thin films made from those solutions show a distinct colour difference (Fig. S1, ESI†); the color of the solution changes from transparent (pure MAPbBr3) to light yellow (MAPbBr3 with extra I−) with the addition of DIO. The color of perovskite films also changes from yellow to orange with increased concentration of DIO in the precursor solution. It clearly indicates that a solute–solvent interaction occurs at the solution stage itself. So, DIO (I−) may chelate with the Pb2+ in the solution or during the crystal growth.

In order to understand the importance of DIO concentration in the perovskite film formation, we examined the effect of different concentrations of DIO on the morphological, structural and opto-electronic properties of perovskite thin films. Fig. 2 represents the microstructures of MAPbBr3 with different concentrations of DIO deposited over PEDOT:PSS/glass substrates. We observe that the morphology of the w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 based perovskite thin film is compact and smooth but domains are very small. However, the morphology of 1 wt% DIO additive based perovskite film is also compact and smooth but having a slightly increased domain size (Fig. 2b). With 2 wt% DIO additive, the crystal size of the MAPbBr3 film becomes larger than the w/o DIO and 1 wt% DIO additive films along with good number of small domains (Fig. 2c). A further increase in the concentration of DIO to 5 wt% results in even more larger grains with some small perovskite nanocrystals (Fig. 2d). The crystal grain size growth observed with increasing concentration of DIO is consistent with a typical Ostwald ripening process. The concentration of dissolved mass is always higher for smaller grains than the bigger grains. Hence, there will be mass transfer occurring from smaller to bigger grains, which leads to continuous growth of bigger grains until the inverse flux of the dissolved components from the small grains stops.24 However, there is clear evidence of relatively poor morphology for the 2 wt% and 5 wt% DIO additive perovskite films (Fig. 2c and d). To further test whether the observed perovskite crystal grain size growth is because of the Ostwald ripening phenomenon, we examined the effect of DIO on different perovskite systems. Fig. S2 (ESI†) represents the microstructures of different wt% DIO additive MAPbI3−xClx perovskite-based systems. We observed an improved (compact and smooth) morphology with bigger domains in the 1 wt% DIO additive thin film of MAPbI3−xClx. The trend of increasing domain size with respect to increasing DIO concentration is similar to MAPbBr3 based films. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the microstructure of MAPbI3 thin films with (1 wt%) and w/o DIO additive. The domain size is increased with addition of DIO but domains are not connected to each other. These results will be further analysed in the discussion section in terms of nucleation site vs. growth kinetics due to the added DIO concentration. Fig. S4 (ESI†) represents the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the different concentration of DIO additive MAPbBr3 films, which were found to be pretty flat and smooth. We note that the thickness of the perovskite films decreases with the increase in the DIO concentration in the perovskite precursor solution. Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†) represent the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite films with different concentrations of DIO in the perovskite precursor solution, respectively. It is observed that 1 wt% DIO additive films are smoother than all other films in both cases, which is consistent with SEM images (Fig. 2). The composition of perovskite thin films with different concentrations of DIO is determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In MAPbI3−xClx films, the I:Cl ratio is found to be higher in the DIO perovskite film (180:1) than in the film w/o DIO additive (47:1). The same trend is observed in MAPbBr3 based DIO additive films. The I:Br ratio increases with the increase in the DIO concentration in the perovskite precursor solution.

3.2 Chemical analysis
Apart from EDS measurement (Table S1, ESI†), the atomic percentage of different elements present in different perovskite films is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The XPS survey scans of with (1 wt%) and w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 films coated over ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates are shown in Fig. 3a. We note that I 3d is present in the XPS survey scan of the DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite film, which confirms the incorporation of I− by addition of small amount of DIO in the perovskite precursor solution. The surface morphology of the pure perovskite film is changing with the addition of DIO; which can be due to the change in the chemical environment of the DIO additive perovskite films. In order to investigate the chemical states of perovskite films, we performed high resolution (HR) XPS on with and w/o DIO additive based perovskite films. To eliminate the surface charging effect, we use core level C 1s (C–H bond = 284.6 eV) as a reference to calibrate the energy position of other spectra (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The presence of I 3d in with DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite films is clearly seen in HRXPS spectra (Fig. S7b, ESI†). We observed from Table S1 (ESI†) that the atomic weight percent of I 3d is increasing and Br 3d is decreasing with the increase in DIO concentration. This indicates that with the increase in the DIO concentration, more iodine ions are incorporated in the perovskite structure by replacing bromine. This is also evident by the chemical shift of I 3d core level spectra towards lower binding energy for DIO additive based perovskite films.25,26Fig. 3b and c show the HRXPS spectra of Br 3d and Pb 4f of with (1 wt%) and w/o DIO additive perovskite films, respectively. The core level spectra of Br 3d and Pb 4f consist of doublet components due to spin–orbit splitting. Br 3d splits into Br 3d5/2 (68.02 eV) and Br 3d3/2 (69.05 eV), and the components are separated by 1.03 eV (Fig. 3b). Similarly, the core level spectra of Pb 4f split into Pb 4f7/2 (138.23 eV) and Pb 4f5/2 (143.11 eV). The separation between the doublets of Pb 4f is 4.88 eV (Fig. 3c), which is in good agreement with the literature.27 Along with this, we observed that there is a chemical shift of 0.17 eV for Br 3d and 0.26 eV for Pb 4f towards lower binding energy in the DIO additive perovskite film. In the core level spectra of Pb 4f, the pristine solution based thin film has an additional Pb feature at a binding energy 1.8 eV lower than the main doublet.28,29 Interestingly, we do not observe any significant additional metallic Pb feature in the DIO additive (1 wt%, 2 wt% and 5 wt%) perovskite films (Fig. S7d, ESI†). Fig. S7c and d (ESI†) represent the HRXPS Br 3d and Pb 4f core level spectra for different concentrations of DIO in the perovskite precursor solution. We observe that the core level photoemission lines of Br 3d and Pb 4f shift towards lower binding energy by increasing the concentration of DIO.

In order to study the chemical shift in more depth, we perform HRXPS on MAPbI3−xClx, and MAPbI3 thin films. We observe that there are no chemical shifts in I 3d and Pb 4f core level spectra of the DIO additive MAPbI3 based thin film with respect to the w/o DIO additive film and it is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Fig. S9a (ESI†) shows the XPS full scan spectra of both with (1 wt%) and w/o DIO additive MAPbI3−xClx films coated over ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates. The HRXPS core level photoemission line of C 1s has been normalized for better visibility and it is shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†). The ratio of iodine to lead is nearly the same (3.22:1) in both the cases which is consistent with the EDS result (Table S1, ESI†) and earlier reports.30 We observed that there is a chemical shift of 0.5 eV for I 3d (Fig. S9c, ESI†) and 0.6 eV for Pb 4f (Fig. S9d, ESI†) towards lower binding energy in DIO added perovskite films. Since there is a small amount of Cl present in the case of the MAPbI3−xClx thin film (Fig. S9e and f, ESI†), we can expect a chemical shift in the core level spectra of the with DIO additive film. In the core level spectra of Pb 4f, the pristine solution based thin film has an additional Pb feature at a binding energy 1.8 eV lower than the main doublet. However, we do not observe any additional Pb feature in the DIO additive perovskite film. We shall discuss the chemical shift and the additional Pb feature in the discussion part.
3.3 Electronic state study
We investigated the electronic states of with and w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 based perovskite films deposited on PEDOT:PSS/glass substrates using ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 4 represents the evolution of UPS spectra as a function of different concentrations of DIO additive in the perovskite precursor solution. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Fermi level of the pure MAPbBr3 film is 4.96 eV, which is in good agreement with the literature.31 Sargent et al. shows an investigation on the MAPbBr3−xClx based perovskite system, where incorporation of Cl− into the MAPbBr3 film can tune the electronic states.32 By adding 1 wt% DIO in the perovskite precursor solution, we found that the Fermi level shifts above the Fermi level of the pure MAPbBr3 by 0.15 eV. On increasing the concentration of DIO from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, we observed a continuous upward shift in the Fermi level of DIO additive perovskite films with respect to the Fermi level of the w/o DIO additive perovskite film. This results in a transition from a p-type pure MAPbBr3 based perovskite film to an n-type DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite film. An upward shift in the valence band maximum (VBM) position of DIO additive MAPbBr3 based films is also observed with respect to the pure perovskite film. In the case of 1 wt% DIO additive film, the shift in the VBM is very small (0.03 eV) and there is no change in the conduction band minimum (CBM) position. However, on increasing the concentration of DIO beyond 1 wt% in the perovskite precursor solution, we observed a significant shift in the VBM and CBM positions. Thus, we can tune the electronic states of the pure perovskite film by addition of different concentrations of DIO. These results will be useful to understand structural, UV-vis and PL spectral studies on these films.

3.4 Structural and optical studies
The evidence of enhanced crystallization is observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of with and w/o DIO additive based perovskite films (Fig. S10a, ESI†). Fig. 5a represents the XRD (100) peak of MAPbBr3 based with and w/o DIO additive films with different concentrations of DIO in the perovskite precursor solution on PEDOT:PSS/glass substrates in the range of 14.8° to 15.3°. We observe from Fig. 5a, that the first order diffraction peak shifts toward the lower angle of diffraction (2θ) with an increase in the concentration of DIO. It is relatively lower for the 1 wt% DIO additive film, however, pretty evident for 2 wt% and 5 wt% additive DIO based films, which is consistent with UPS studies. The second and third order XRD peak positions of MAPbBr3 with different concentrations of DIO are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The shift in XRD peak position toward lower angle suggests the replacement of the smaller atom (Br) by the bigger atom (I). The (110) peak location in the MAPbI3−xClx based film decreases slightly but noticeably from ∼14.12° to 14.10° with addition of 1 wt% DIO (Fig. S10b, ESI†). However, we do not observe any significant shift in the XRD peak position of the film made with the DIO additive in comparison to the w/o DIO additive MAPbI3 based perovskite system (Fig. S10c, ESI†).

Fig. 5b represents the optical absorption of MAPbBr3 perovskite films with different concentrations of DIO. With increasing DIO concentration, the UV-vis absorption shows a systematic red shift (decrease in the bandgap (Eg)) in the absorption edge for the DIO additive MAPbBr3 films. The red shift in the absorption edge suggests the incorporation of I− in the pure MAPbBr3 perovskite film to form MAPbBr3−xIx. The bandgap of the perovskite films with different concentrations of DIO is estimated using the relation(αE)2 = A(E − Eg)where, α and E are the absorption coefficient and photon energy, respectively (Fig. S11a, ESI†). Apart from that, we also observe a decrement in the exciton feature with an increase in DIO concentration.4,33 We also observe that the optical density of the films decreases with an increase in the DIO concentration, which suggests that the increase in the DIO concentration make films thinner than the w/o DIO additive perovskite film, which is consistent with the SEM cross-section data (Fig. S4, ESI†). So, the change in the color of the perovskite films (Fig. S1, ESI†) is mainly because of chelation of I− with Pb2+, consistent with UPS, XRD and red-shifted absorption edge based studies. The effect of morphology on the shape of the UV-vis spectrum is also evident in Fig. 5b, where a compact film shows enhanced absorption at higher energies as compared to films with voids, as discussed in the literature.34
The same trend of red shift is also evident in steady-state photoluminescence (PL) study of MAPbBr3 based films. The PL peak position is red shifted with an increase in DIO concentration and it is shown in Fig. 5c. The PL shift with DIO concentration is significant for 2 wt% and 5 wt% additive cases, as compared to the 1 wt% additive DIO film, again in agreement with UPS, XRD and UV-vis studies. Fig. 5d shows the time-resolved PL spectra of with (1 wt%) and w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite films. The PL lifetime of both films was fitted using a mono-exponential decay function. The lifetime of the DIO additive based perovskite film is longer by a factor of two than that of the w/o DIO additive perovskite film.
3.5 Photovoltaic performance
On the basis of the above studies, we have fabricated MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite solar cells with a p–i–n device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PC61BM/BCP/Ag). Fig. 6a shows the light J–V characteristics of with and w/o DIO additive MAPbI3−xClx perovskite solar cells. Dark J–V characteristics for three devices are shown in Fig. S13a (ESI†). The devices made with 1 wt% DIO additive have an improved PCE of 14.70% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.04 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.62 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.53%, which is higher than previous reports for similar processing conditions of MAPbI3−xClx with DIO in p–i–n devices.35,36 In contrast, the devices made from pristine precursor solution showed a PCE of 10.53% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 17.71 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.59%. We observed a significant decrease in the PCE by increasing the DIO concentration to 2 wt%, which suggests that 1 wt% DIO is the optimized concentration for fabrication of better perovskite solar cells. The average PCE values over 16 devices in a single batch process are listed in Table 1. The increase in Jsc for DIO added devices is estimated using external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency measurement (IQE) studies (Fig. 6b). The EQE of the devices with the DIO additive is higher than that of the device w/o the DIO additive. This is consistent with the enhancement in Jsc of DIO additive devices. We also calculated the Jsc by integrating the EQE spectrum with the AM 1.5 spectrum and obtained a value of 16.22 mA cm−2, 19.66 mA cm−2 and 18.96 mA cm−2 for 0 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt% DIO additive solar cells, respectively. The small difference (less than 10%) in the current density calculated from J–V and EQE measurements is due to edge effects from the small cells having an active area of 4.5 mm2.37Fig. 6b also shows the IQE spectrum which is calculated from the EQE and the reflective absorption spectrum. The increased collection efficiency at longer wavelength for the 1 wt% DIO added solar cell suggests that the carrier mobility is larger for the DIO added solar cell. This is a consequence of the larger grain size in the DIO added films. The Jsc from IQE is 19.19 mA cm−2, 21.92 mA cm−2 and 21.33 mA cm−2 for w/o, with 1 wt%, and 2 wt% DIO additive devices, respectively, validating the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curve.

In order to understand the charge recombination process in MAPbI3−xClx perovskite based PV devices, light-intensity dependent J–V characteristics of solar cells was measured. Fig. 6c represents the variation of Voc with the incident light intensity on with (1 wt% DIO) and w/o DIO additive devices. The slope calculated from the Vocversus logarithmic light-intensity plot provides the ideality factor “η” which gives information about the charge carrier recombination processes in the open-circuit condition.38 In the case of the MAPbI3−xClx w/o DIO additive PV device, the slope of Vocvs. ln(intensity) gives a value of 1.69(kT/q) (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature and q is elementary charge). It indicates (η = 1.69) Schokley–Read–Hall (SRH) type trap assisted recombination occurring in the control device. However, for the DIO additive MAPbI3−xClx perovskite based device, we observed a value of 1.05(kT/q). It indicates that recombination takes place within the bulk (occurrence of bimolecular recombination). Fig. 6d demonstrates the power law dependence of Jsc with respect to the incident light intensity. The DIO additive device shows α = 1.01, which is close to unity, similar to the control device with α = 0.96 with a slight deviation.
We have also fabricated MAPbBr3 based perovskite solar cells and light emitting diodes with p–i–n device structure (similar to MAPbI3−xClx). Fig. 7a shows light J–V characteristics of with and w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells. A similar trend in all photovoltaic parameters is observed as it is found in MAPbI3−xClx based perovskite solar cells and listed in Table 1. The increase in Jsc for the DIO added device is estimated using EQE and is shown in Fig. 7b. It is worth to notice the red shift in the EQE spectra of DIO additive cells with respect to w/o DIO additive perovskite solar cells. This also gives evidence of replacement of Br− with I− by adding different concentrations of DIO in the pure MAPbBr3 based perovskite solution, which is consistent with absorption, steady-state PL, XRD, and chemical analysis.

Fig. 7c represents the variation of Voc with incident light intensity on both devices. In the w/o DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite based device, we observed two different slopes, i.e., two ideality factors in different intensity ranges. For I > 50 mw cm−2, the value of η ∼ 1.67 indicates (η = 1.67) SRH type trap-assisted recombination. At lower intensity, n is very large. Such large values of η can arise at low intensity when the current flows through internal shunts.39 However, for the DIO additive MAPbBr3 perovskite-based device, we observed a value of 1.75(kT/q) throughout all the intensities. It also indicates a SRH type of trap-assisted recombination process in this device as well. Fig. 7d demonstrates the power law dependence of Jsc with respect to the incident light intensity. The DIO additive device shows α = 1.03, which is close to unity. The control device shows a deviation with α = 0.89.
4. Discussion
Based on the above findings, the improved morphology and enhanced crystallisation is depend upon the higher boiling point of the solvent additive and its tendency to increase the solubility of the perovskite in the host solution. And later on, during thermal annealing, smaller domains (due to the presence of DIO, whose boiling point is higher than the host solvent DMF) fuse to form a compact film with large domains (Fig. 2).40 Such obvious crystal grain size growth observed with addition of DIO is consistent with a typical Ostwald ripening process, which is discussed in ESI† (Fig. S12). Whereas, w/o DIO films have more nucleation sites with fast crystal growth, providing relatively smaller domains (as seen in morphological studies, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†) and voids (as observed as leakage current in LEDs@1 V bias, Fig. S14, ESI†).
The additional metallic Pb0 4f feature (Fig. 3c) at a binding energy 1.8 eV lower than the main doublet (Pb 4f5/2 & Pb 4f7/2) is found to be significant in the w/o DIO thin film only, which acts as a recombination center.28,29 This indicates that the with DIO thin film has fewer recombination centers than the pristine thin film, which facilitates better charge transport in with DIO perovskite based solar cells with higher FF (Fig. 6 and 7). In addition, there is a chemical shift in the core level XPS spectra of Br 3d and Pb 4f towards lower binding energy in the with DIO film (Fig. 3b and c) due to different electronegativity background/surroundings,25,26 since I is less electronegative than Br. Thus, we can expect a chemical shift in the photoelectron lines of Pb 4f and Br 3d towards lower binding energy.
We observed a reduced ionization potential via upward shift of the VBM of the MAPbBr3 perovskite film with an increase in DIO concentration, which basically reduces the hole injection-barrier at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. The VBM of the perovskite is mainly composed of mixed Pb 6s-orbitals and halide np-orbitals (n is the principle quantum number).41 Thus, the VBM position of the perovskite is dominated by halide p-orbitals. However, the CBM is mainly composed of Pb 6p orbitals. The VBM position depends on the choice of halide: Cl to Br to I, because the valence atomic orbitals change from 3p to 4p to 5p, respectively. I is the largest atom among all the above three mentioned halides, having a higher n value and thus lower binding energy. This can be understood by the UPS result, in which incorporation of I−via DIO in the MAPbBr3 perovskite film causes an upward shift in the VBM position from the pure perovskite to the 5 wt% DIO additive perovskite film (Fig. 4). Along with XPS and UPS results, XRD (Fig. 5a), absorption (Fig. 5b), and steady state PL (Fig. 5c) results also support the incorporation of I− in the MAPbBr3 perovskite film. Thus, all the above findings confirm replacement of the hard Lewis base (Br−) by a soft Lewis base (I−), which basically prolonged the film evolution time. Along with that, the Ostwald ripening phenomenon helps in formation of bigger domain crystallites. Further, we fabricated perovskite solar cells from MAPbBr3 (Fig. 7) (also for MAPbI3−xClx (Fig. S6, ESI†)) based perovskite films and PeLEDs using MAPbBr3 perovskite films (Fig. S14, ESI†). We obtained improved performance of both perovskite solar cells and PeLEDs by addition of 1 wt% DIO into the precursor solution. These enhanced performances of optoelectronic devices are attributed to the improved quality of thin films by the DIO additive. We note that thin-film morphology is an important aspect for device performance, however, a lot of optimization is also needed on charge extraction layers to get high efficiency devices. These two are well known separate issues in the perovskite device community. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows the device performance of MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbBr3 based perovskite solar cells without BCP as an interlayer between PC61BM and Ag. We observe that the trend in the increase of photovoltaic parameters with addition of DIO is similar in both cases i.e. with or without using BCP as an interlayer (Fig. 6, 7 and Fig. S15, ESI†). However, the interlayer helps in improving the charge extraction property and thus improving the overall PCE. Hence, these device results with two different structures clearly suggest that 1% DIO solvent additive improves the thin-film's optoelectronic properties to achieve higher efficiency devices.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have described a comparative study of the perovskite thin films fabricated from wide bandgap MAPbBr3 with and w/o DIO as an additive to the perovskite precursor solution. The DIO plays an important role in providing extra iodine, which participates in the perovskite formation via an ion exchange process and thus, it alters the kinetics of crystalline film formation by making the film more iodine-rich with less metallic Pb. The core level XPS photoemission lines of Br 3d and Pb 4f show a chemical shift towards lower binding energy due to the surrounding chemical environment being less electronegative. The EDS results also validate the iodine-rich film by addition of DIO into the perovskite precursor solution. Along with that, steady-state PL, UV-vis, XRD, XPS and UPS results also confirm the exchange of Br− by I−. Herein, we show that the addition of DIO in the pristine solution can significantly improve the film quality, reduces the density of metallic lead, i.e., non-radiative recombination centers, and leakage currents and improves charge transport, which leads to more efficient and reproducible photovoltaics and PeLED devices.
