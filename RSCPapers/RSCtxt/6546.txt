    , Accepted 5th January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractChalcogenides have attracted great attention in the past few decades because of their excellent processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. Particularly, AgBiS2 has been the frontier of the photovoltaic field in the past few years. AgBiS2 possesses fascinating merits, such as a high absorption coefficient, suitable bandgap, decent charge transport properties and superior material stability. However, most of the efficient AgBiS2-based devices are fabricated with AgBiS2 quantum dots, which require long fabrication time and complicated synthetic steps. Moreover, most of the reports focused on photovoltaic devices, and AgBiS2-based photodetectors have not been reported yet. Based on the challenges listed above, we developed AgBiS2 photodetectors based on a molecular precursor method with a p–i–n device structure. These photodetectors exhibited broadband spectral response with decent detectivity and fast response time of 700 ns. In addition, these devices also demonstrated outstanding air, light and water stability.
Introduction
In the past few decades, chalcogenides1–3 have been a hot spot in the photovoltaic field because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and facile processability, i.e., vacuum deposition or solution processing. However, most reported high power conversion efficiency (PCE) solar cells based on chalcogenides contained toxic (e.g., lead4 and cadmium5–7) or rare (e.g., tellurium or indium8–10) elements, which runs counter to the concept of environmental protection and reducing fabrication cost. Recently, silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2), which is composed of non-toxic and earth-abundant elements, has emerged as a promising candidate in the optoelectronic field thanks to its fascinating merits, such as a high absorption coefficient,11,12 decent charge transport properties,13 excellent stability and low cost. In 2016, AgBiS2 quantum dot (QD)-based solar cells were first reported with a high PCE of 6.3%.14 After that, more and more groups got involved in the field of AgBiS2.13,15–21 However, all of the high PCE solar cells were reported based on AgBiS2 QDs. For instance, Hu et al.15 reported an improved amine-based synthesis route to obtain AgBiS2 QDs in 2018. Based on this method, the authors achieved a PCE of 4.3% with ZnO and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) as electron and hole charge transport layers, respectively. In 2019, based on the method reported previously, Oh et al.21 investigated the water stability of AgBiS2 QD solar cells. The devices exhibited a PCE of 5.71% after water treatment, which was almost the same as that of the control devices.
However, AgBiS2 QDs require long preparation time and complicated synthetic steps. Furthermore, QDs are normally stabilized with organic ligands, which need to be exchanged and washed many times, and the repeatability of QD-based devices is also an issue which needs to be addressed. Hence, exploring a non-QD-based solution-processed method for preparing AgBiS2 films is very necessary. In 2018, Pai et al.17 deposited AgBiS2 films by spray pyrolysis of bismuth(III) tris(4-methylbenzodithioate) toluene solutions containing silver(I) acetate and 1-octanethiol directly, and achieved a PCE of 1.62%. Almost at the same time, Gu et al.16 proposed a new method to form AgBiS2 films by a single molecular precursor ink, exhibiting potential application prospects in optoelectronic devices. In 2019, based on a similar method, Wu et al.20 fabricated AgBiS2 solar cells and achieved a PCE of 1.4%. More recently, Embden et al. developed a similar molecular precursor method and probed the light sensitivity with lateral electrodes.19
According to the reported papers, it could be found that most of the high PCE AgBiS2 solar cells were fabricated based on QDs. The devices based on the precursor method exhibited much lower PCEs (<2%). One of the possible reasons for this is that the molecular precursors could be very reactive with the ZnO layer underneath. Correlating the composition of molecular precursors with device fabrication to further improve the performance of these devices is very challenging. In addition, all reported works on AgBiS2 devices are based on a conventional n–i–p structure, and the research on the inverted p–i–n structure is quite lagging. On the other hand, some of the reports have demonstrated photocurrent response under modulated incident light, which are the prototypes of AgBiS2-based photodetectors. However, no appropriate AgBiS2 photodetector is reported, especially one with a photodiode architecture, and the performance metrics of the photodetectors have not been fully investigated and characterized. Hence, in this paper, based on the aforementioned challenges, we try to fabricate AgBiS2 photodetectors and optimize the device performance based on the precursor method. The composition of the precursor and the annealing process of the spin-coated films are carefully tuned, and the relationship between materials’ preparation and device performance is investigated. Moreover, all the devices are fabricated with an inverted device architecture, that is, AgBiS2 precursors are deposited on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layers, which may not react with the precursors like oxides.
Experimental methods
Materials
AgBiS2 precursor solution was obtained via directly dissolving 0.6 mmol AgNO3 (Yonghua Chemical Technology, AR) and 0.6 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Aladdin, 99.99%) in 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Alfa Aesar, 99.9%). The precursor was rigorously stirred until it became clear and transparent and filtered before use. PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus (Clevios P VP. Al 4083), which was diluted with DI water with a ratio of 4:1, and filtered before using. Bathocuproine (BCP, >99%), C60 (99.9%) and C70 (>99%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp., Aladdin and Luminescence Technology Corp., respectively.
Device fabrication
All devices were fabricated based on commercial patterned indium doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates (Meijingyuan Glass). Before using, ITO was cleaned with hot detergent solution, and then washed in ultrasonic cleaner with DI water, acetone and alcohol, in sequence. Next, the clean ITO was treated with O3 plasma for 15 min to remove the residual organics and improve the surface hydrophilicity. Then, the filtered PEDOT:PSS solution was deposited on the ITO substrates via spin coating at 4000 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min and 150 °C for 20 min, respectively. AgBiS2 precursors were deposited on the top of PEDOT:PSS at a speed of 4000 rpm for 90 s. Then, a multi-step annealing procedure was carried out for AgBiS2 films at temperatures of 100 °C, 120 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C for 30 min, respectively. All of the above procedures were carried out in air. Finally, 30 nm C60 or 60 nm C70, 3 nm BCP and 60 nm Cu were evaporated as an electron transport layer, a hole blocking layer and a counter electrode, respectively, to complete the device fabrication.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at 1.5418 Å, scanning from 20° to 70°. The surface morphology was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy on JEOL7100F. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used to measure the J–V curves both in the dark and under illumination, and whole J–V curves were achieved under the light source of an AAA solar simulator (SAN-EI, XES-50S2). Frequency response was tested with a 630 nm LED (Thorlabs) modulated with an arbitrary wave function generator (Agilent, 33612A), and the temporal response of these devices was recorded with a digital storage oscilloscope (LeCroy Waverunner 8254).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a demonstrates the formation of AgBiS2 crystals via a solution precursor method. AgNO3 and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were dissolved in DMSO and reacted with thiourea. AgBiS2 crystals with a typical rock salt structure were obtained after thermal annealing. The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1a, where sulfur atoms form an fcc lattice and mixture silver/bismuth cations take up the octahedral interstices.18 This crystal structure could lead to a tunable bandgap by replacing the metal or sulfur atoms with kin atoms. Fig. 1b schematically displays the fabrication process of AgBiS2 films in air, including the preparation of precursors, spin-coating and thermal annealing. We observed that the spin-coated films turned from transparent to black during the annealing process, and the annealing temperature and time play important roles in the quality of the AgBiS2 films. In this paper, we used multi-step annealing to provide a mild reaction and release the solvent and gaseous products slowly. Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the typical SEM images of the AgBiS2 films prepared at various initial temperatures. We also notice that the thiourea/metal (Tu/M) ratio can significantly affect the conversion speed from precursors to AgBiS2 films. Fig. S2a (ESI†) displays the optical photos of the AgBiS2 precursor films placed on a hot plate with various Tu/M ratios. It is obvious that the films with large Tu/M ratios turned to a dark color quickly even at a low initial temperature of 100 °C. We used multi-step annealing and increased the temperature to 200 °C and kept it for another 30 min. Fig. S2b (ESI†) presents the photos of the obtained AgBiS2 films. With the optimized annealing process, we obtained AgBiS2 films with a small grain size and less pinholes. To assess the crystallinity, we have characterized the AgBiS2 films with XRD and the typical XRD spectrum is as shown in Fig. 1c. Three main peaks at 27°, 32° and 45° are indexed, corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) plane characteristic peaks of cubic AgBiS2 crystals, which indicate that AgBiS2 crystals were successfully formed with good crystallinity. In addition, we also tested the material stability of the obtained AgBiS2 films. These films were stored in air with relatively high humidity and they maintained the same color. We further inserted these films in water for 10 min, and compared the XRD and absorption spectra with or without water treatment as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Interestingly, we observed negligible change both for absorption and XRD patterns, indicating remarkable stability of these films in air and even in water.

Having obtained decent AgBiS2 films, we turn to the device fabrication of AgBiS2 photodetectors. Fig. 2a displays the typical inverted p–i–n device structure, where AgBiS2 films were sandwiched between a fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) and PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer (HTL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of AgBiS2 devices with an inverted p–i–n structure. The proposed energy level diagram17 is provided in Fig. 2b. To evaluate the quality of the photodiodes and easily compare with the reported photovoltaic performance, photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were tested under simulated one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). As mentioned above, the annealing temperature has a crucial influence on the quality of the AgBiS2 films. In this work, a multi-step annealing process was introduced to slow down the conversion of AgBiS2 films, obtaining improved morphology and crystallinity. These results could be reflected by the device performance (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). We fabricated the devices with various initial annealing temperatures and found that the AgBiS2 films annealed at high initial annealing temperature were almost shorted with a large leakage current. By reducing the initial annealing temperature, the short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be effectively boosted, thanks to the improved thin film quality. On the other hand, we also investigated the influence of Tu/M ratios on the device performance. The results indicate that relatively high PCE was achieved when the Tu/M ratio was kept at 1 as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Hence, all the following devices were fabricated based on the optimized Tu/M ratio of 1. We have to note that humidity also affects the AgBiS2 film formation and device performance quite a lot as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It is beneficial, when the AgBiS2 films are prepared in a moderate humidity level (30–60% RH). However, too high humidity (>60% RH) would definitely ruin the uniformity and deteriorate the quality of the AgBiS2 films. We also prepared AgBiS2 films and devices in a glovebox (H2O < 0.1 ppm) or low humidity (<30% RH) environment, and found that the precursor films cannot fully convert to AgBiS2 crystals. A certain amount of water may facilitate the hydrolysis of thiourea, and release enough sulfide ions to react with Ag+ and Bi3+ ions.

With further optimization, we achieved a champion device (device area = 0.1 cm2), and displayed the J–V curve and EQE spectrum as shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. From the J–V curve, we got the highest Voc of 280 mV and the best Jsc of 16.85 mA/cm2. The fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be calculated as 43.3% and 2.04%. Table 1 presents a comparison of the published AgBiS2 solar cells with this work. Compared with QD-based devices, there are still large gaps on FF and Voc, which are greatly affected by the morphology.22–24 Hence, there is still a lot of space to further improve the PCE of AgBiS2 solar cells based on the precursor method. Apparently, we achieved the highest PCE via the solution precursor method. We have to note that this result was achieved with a multi-step annealing process at a relatively low annealing temperature (200 °C) in air, and this is the first report of AgBiS2 devices with a p–i–n inverted device architecture.

Having optimized the photodiodes and photovoltaic performance, we can easily adapt AgBiS2 films to detect visible light as silicon. However, AgBiS2-based photodetectors have not been systematically studied. In the next section, we focus on the potential application of AgBiS2 thin films on photodetection. With similar photodiode device architecture of the above-mentioned AgBiS2 devices, we replaced the C60 layer with a thicker C70 electron transport layer, which can fully cover the pin-holes of the AgBiS2 thin layer and minimize the dark leakage current and noise. The typical J–V curves in the dark and under one sun irradiation are shown in Fig. 3a. The dark current at a bias voltage of 0.1 V was less than 1 μA cm−2, and it increased slightly with the increase of the bias voltage. Compared with other advanced photodetectors,25–31 the dark current of the AgBiS2 photodetectors is relatively high, which could be attributed to the following two factors: i.e., pin holes and ultra-thin active layer (∼40 nm). According to previous reports, thick junctions can effectively reduce the dark current.26,27,32 However, we introduced the thick junction concept to the AgBiS2 photoactive layer, which resulted in a considerable decrease of photocurrent as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). We also tested the noise density and EQE spectra of AgBiS2 photodetectors as shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†), respectively. Special responsivity (R) is a key parameter for photodetectors, which can be calculated based on the EQE by the following equation: (1)where q is the elementary charge, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light and λ is the wavelength of the incident light. As depicted in Fig. 3b, AgBiS2 photodetectors exhibited a broadband response covering the whole range from visible to NIR, and the maximum responsivity reached 0.18 A W−1 around 780 nm. Based on the noise density and responsivity, specific detectivity (D*) can be determined easily by the following equation: (2)where A is the device area and In is the noise current. Specific detectivity is another key parameter of photodetectors, which represents the detection limit as a photodetector. In this paper, the detectivity of AgBiS2 photodetectors exceeded 109 Jones in the whole range from 400 nm to 1100 nm, which was mainly limited by the device leakage and a relatively large noise current. Next, we tested the frequency response of the AgBiS2 photodetectors. It was found that the frequency response was not field dependent, since the active layer was thin. As shown in Fig. 3c, the measured f−3dB reached >1 MHz at −0.1 V with a small device area of 0.02 cm2. We also recorded the fast temporal response of the AgBiS2 photodetectors under a modulated 630 nm LED. Fig. 3d displays the fast photocurrent transient with a remarkable rise time of 700 ns, which can benefit from the thin active layer and excellent charge transport properties.

To further evaluate the application value, a series of stability characterizations of AgBiS2-based devices were tested, including light stability, long-term air stability and water stability. We have to note that all the devices were tested and stored in air without encapsulation. Fig. 4a shows the normalized photocurrent under continuous simulated one sun irradiation for two hours. It can be seen that there is almost no change in photocurrent, indicating outstanding light stability. Meanwhile, the normalized photocurrent of devices stored in air with a humidity level of around 50% RH is recorded in Fig. 4b. Obviously, after storing in air for 29 days, the devices exhibited a slight change in terms of photocurrent, showing decent long-term air stability. Lastly, we tested the device performance in water. Surprisingly, these devices maintained the open-circuit voltage (tested by a multimeter) value for at least one minute when they were inserted in water (Fig. S10, ESI†). It suggests exceptional water stability, which is in line with the reported water-resistance21 and the material stability in water.

Conclusions
In summary, we prepared AgBiS2 films using a facile precursor method, and investigated the influence of a multi-step annealing process and Tu/M ratios on the formation of decent AgBiS2 films. The material properties, such as morphology, crystallinity and water stability are fully characterized. For the first time, we fabricated inverted p–i–n structured AgBiS2 photodiodes via a non-QD method. With careful optimization, we achieved a record PCE of 2.04%. It is a considerable improvement compared with other reported devices based on the precursor method. We further evaluated the photodetectors, and the performance metrics of the AgBiS2 photodetectors were first properly characterized. We achieved a relatively high responsivity of 0.18 A W−1 and a flat detectivity spectrum in the whole range from 400 nm to 1100 nm, which was limited by the large noise. Interestingly, these devices demonstrated a quick response of ∼700 ns, benefiting from decent charge transport. In addition, these devices also exhibited superior light, air and water stability, which is very promising for real applications.
