    , Accepted 21st January 2020First published on 22nd January 2020AbstractOpen-circuit voltage (VOC) is a key factor for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). At present, increasing attention has been devoted towards modifying π bridges in single-porphyrin small molecule donors with an A–π–D–π–A configuration to reduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and improve the VOC of devices. However, how to screen the π bridges is a key issue. In this work, nine π bridges were screened by the HOMO level gradient-distribution strategy of fragments (electron-donating donor (D), π bridges, and electron-withdrawing acceptor (A)), where fragments meeting the requirements were combined into five novel small molecule donors. Meanwhile, in order to test whether the strategy is beneficial to increasing VOC, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was selected as the acceptor material. The energy levels of all molecules were compared and the photoelectric properties (i.e., energy gap, energy driving force, reorganization energy, intermolecular charge transfer rate, charge recombination rate, and VOC) of the five small molecules were studied. The results showed that the HOMO levels of porphyrin donors could be significantly lowered via this strategy, and VOC was raised without losing the short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the devices. Meanwhile, the designed five small molecules could be used as donor candidates to improve the performance of OSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages such as environmental friendliness, light weight and flexibility.1,2 Small molecule materials are often used as donors in the active layer of OSCs owing to the outstanding features of simple synthesis, well-defined chemical structures and ease of purification.3–5 Porphyrins and their derivatives have a wide optical absorption range, high molar absorption coefficient and unique charge transport properties, which become the “star unit” in small molecule donor materials.6–8 Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of small molecule OSCs based on dimeric porphyrins exceeds 10%,9 while single porphyrins with smaller structures and easy synthesis have lower efficiency.10,11 Therefore, researchers designed novel single-porphyrin small molecule donor materials to improve the device efficiency. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) is a key factor for improving PCE.12 Reducing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is the best way to increase the VOC when donor molecules are designed due to a linear relationship between them.2,13 At present, designing single-porphyrin small molecule donors with lower HOMO energy levels to raise the VOC without losing short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) has become the focus of research.
In order to better modify the energy levels, porphyrin molecules with an A–π–D–π–A configuration have been designed.11,14,15 There are two advantages of this configuration: (1) the push–pull electron effect between the electron-donating (D) and electron-withdrawing acceptor (A) fragments, which could facilitate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT);16 (2) the HOMO levels of single-porphyrin small molecules could be efficiently adjusted by introducing conjugated π-bridges acting as connectors between D and A, which is a promising way to enhance the VOC of devices.17 In the A–π–D–π–A configuration, zinc porphyrins combined with an alkyne were selected as the D unit. The introduction of zinc atoms not only maintained the planar structure of porphyrins, but also resulted in axial ligation with additives such as pyridine, which was beneficial to improve solubility;18 alkyne insertion in the structure enhanced the planarity of the molecule and improved the ICT while enhancing the conjugation and reducing the band gap (Eg).8 Rhodanine with strong electron-withdrawing ability was often used as the A unit.19,20 The different units such as thiophene,21 thienylvinylene,22 3,3″-dihexyl-terthiophene,23 and 3,5-di(dodecyloxyl)phenyl24 were often selected as π bridges to improve the performance of the devices. However, the maximum PCE of porphyrin molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration was only 8.8% with zinc porphyrin as the central unit due to low VOC.25 Therefore, it is necessary to design novel molecules with high VOC. For the analysis of small molecules or polymers with a D–A or A–D–A configuration, it was found that the HOMO levels of molecules were determined by the D unit and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were determined by the A unit.26–28 In the molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration, the HOMO levels of D should also be higher than that of A.29,30 However, the distribution position of the HOMO energy levels of π bridges still lacks systematic analysis. There are two distribution ways for π bridges (Fig. S2b, ESI†); which one is more conducive for improving the device performance? When molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration were explored, the π bridges and D fragments often served as the electron-donating moieties.31 Therefore, the HOMO levels of the molecules might be directly affected by the π bridges when the same fragment is selected as D. Thus, an assumption was proposed that sequentially decreasing the HOMO energy levels of the D, π and A fragments would be beneficial for increasing VOC. It is named as “energy level gradient-distribution strategy” and it is expected to be used for constructing novel porphyrin small molecule donors.
In order to confirm this assumption, novel porphyrin small molecule donors with the A–π–D–π–A configuration were designed. The nine high-mobility building blocks were used for π bridges screening via the energy level gradient-distribution strategy32–36 (Fig. 1). Here, we focused on the thiophene-based π-bridges because they are the most typical building blocks in the donor materials of OSCs.37 Linking the thiophene-based π-bridges could promote close packing of molecules by the intermolecular π–π interactions;38 the sulfur atoms of thiophene could induce intramolecular non-covalent interactions via S⋯S, which improved the conjugation, enhanced the planarity and also led to denser packing.39 The above-mentioned factors would facilitate hole transport and enhance device efficiency.40 The results showed that the molecules satisfying the design strategy had lower HOMO energy levels, which could significantly improve the VOC of the devices and achieve the purpose of π bridges screening. At the same time, so as to testify the strategy was applied to increase the VOC without losing JSC and FF, the photoelectric properties of five molecules that meet this strategy were studied. The [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was selected as the acceptor to construct a donor/acceptor interface. The results demonstrated that the designed five small molecules could be used as candidates to improve the performance of single-porphyrin OSCs due to their strong absorption in both the UV-visible and near-infrared regions, larger intermolecular charge transfer rate (kinter-CT) and smaller charge recombination rate (kinter-CR) (the ratios are greater than or equal to 1012) as well as large VOC over 1.0 V.

2. Computational methods
2.1 Model
To save computational cost, the alkyl chains of side chains were replaced by methyl groups, which had already been confirmed to have little influence on the photoelectric properties of the materials.41 The B3LYP,42,43 M06,44 M06-2X,45 PBE046 and PBE3847 functionals with 6-31G** basis set were selected to optimize 5-bis(2,5-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dithienyl-2-yl-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′-ylethynyl)-10,20-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-thienyl)-porphyrin zinc(II) (DPPEZnP-THE) and compared with the experimental data.48 The molecular geometry was optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were employed to simulate absorption spectra and obtain excited-state energies. The results showed that the M06/6-31G** method was more suitable for optimizing ground state geometry of porphyrin small molecule donors (Table S1, ESI†). As for the simulation of absorption spectra, TD-B3LYP/6-31G** gave more reasonable estimates compared to other methods (Fig. S1, ESI†).
For donor/acceptor complexes, the interaction between electron-rich 6:6 bonds at the surface of fullerene and geometric centre of metalloporphyrin were stronger and the distance was 2.8 Å.49–51 Considering dispersion correction, the CAM-B3LYP-D3/6-31G** method was used to optimize the ground state geometry of the donor/PC61BM interface. The excited characteristics were characterized by the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G** method because the long-range correlation functional CAM-B3LYP was more suitable to describe the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor during excitation. The charge density difference (CDD) graph and natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis were implemented by Multiwfn 3.6.52,53 All of the above calculations were executed by using the Gaussian 09 software package.54
2.2 Marcus rate expression
In order to estimate kinter-CT and kinter-CR at the interface of the study system, a Marcus semi-classical model was applied. It is expressed as follows:55–57 (1)

V
DA represents the electron coupling value between acceptor and donor molecules: the two processes from charge transfer (VCT) and charge recombination (VCR) were calculated separately in Q-chem 4.0 software;58λ represents the reorganization energy, including the external reorganization energy (λext) affected by changing the external environment and the internal reorganization energy (λint) from the change in equilibrium geometry when the donor and acceptor lose and gain electrons during charge transfer. ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, T refers to the temperature, which is 300 K, h is the Planck constant, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The specific calculation details about VDA, λ, and ΔG are exhibited in ESI,† (S2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The selection of π bridges
The chemical structures for all the building blocks of the porphyrin molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration are shown in Fig. 1, which include the metal zinc porphyrin in combination with an alkyne as the D fragment, rhodanine as the A fragment and nine different fragments as π bridges. The FMO energy levels of the building blocks were calculated to clarify the rationality of the design strategy of energy level gradient-distribution. As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMO levels of the D fragments and nine π bridges are higher than the A fragments, indicating that they act as electron-donating moieties in the molecules. The HOMO levels of the nine π bridges increased in the order π-6 < π-1 < π-3 < π-5 < π-4 < π-2 < π-7 < π-8 < π-9, thereby indicating that the electron-donating ability of π bridges gradually enhanced. Fig. 2 shows that the HOMO levels of other π bridges can form gradient distribution with D and A except for the π-7, π-8, and π-9 fragments of the molecule. The HOMO levels of π-7–π-9 were higher than that for the D fragments, which might not be beneficial for the hole transfer of molecule skeletons and could simultaneously result in lower VOC (S.3.1, ESI†). Therefore, the fragments π-1–π-6 were screened by this strategy for designing novel single-porphyrin molecules.

In order to further testify that the molecules screened via the gradient-distribution strategy had lower HOMO levels and larger VOC, the FMO energy levels of all molecules (constructed by π-1–π-9) were calculated and presented in Fig. 3. The results showed that the HOMO and LUMO levels of the molecules 7–9 were higher than that of 1–6, and the VOC values were lower than 1.0 V when PC61BM was used as the acceptor (Table S2, ESI†). The VOC values of 1–6 were greater than 1.0 V. Among these, 1, 4 and 6 had lower HOMO levels and larger VOC. This supported the hypothesis that using the gradient-distribution strategy could help reduce the HOMO levels of molecules and increase the VOC of devices. However, the PCE of OSCs is proportional to JSC, FF and VOC. The key to improve device efficiency is to ensure no loss of JSC and FF while increasing the VOC of devices by using the energy level gradient-distribution strategy. The photoelectric properties of 1–6 with high VOC needed to be explored. Furthermore, the energy level matching of the donor and acceptor molecules is a key factor for improving the efficiency of devices. The difference in the LUMO energy levels of PC61BM and donor molecules was calculated. Among them, the energy driving force (ΔEL–L) of 6 was only 0.06 eV (Table S2, ESI†). Slight ΔEL–L might not be conducive to obtain effective charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface. Therefore, the optical and electronic properties of 1–5 were analysed in this work (Fig. S2, ESI†). The structures of the five donors were optimized (shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). All molecules with planar conformations could facilitate ICT, enhance intermolecular π–π packing and increase carrier mobility, in turn improving FF. In order to further demonstrate the advantages of the molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration, molecules having an A–D–A structure were constructed (named as X-1) and compared with 1–5. The X-1 molecule had a large twisted structure, and the twist angle was 53° (Fig. S4a, ESI†), indicating that the introduction of π bridges could significantly enhance the planarity of molecules.
 Fig. 3  HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 1–9 constructed with different π bridges were calculated. 
3.2 Absorption spectra
It is well-known that the absorption spectrum of a donor material should match the solar spectrum as much as possible, which is beneficial to increase JSC.59 Therefore, the absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4 and the excitation information is listed in Table 1. The results showed that all molecules had similar absorption characteristics; the Soret bands were between 400 and 550 nm, and the strongest absorption was located in the Q band from the HOMO → LUMO transition of the S1 state. Among these, 3 exhibited a slight red-shift relative to the other molecules. The absorption range of five molecules covered the entire UV-visible region and even spread to the near-infrared region, which was conducive to the absorption of sunlight, thereby improving JSC. To clarify the origin of the strongest absorption of 1–5, the FMOs are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The orbital distributions of the HOMO levels of the five molecules were fully delocalized on the D fragments and π bridges that showed π character. This also showed that the D and π bridges acted as the electron-donating groups of molecules. It was obvious that the orbital distribution of all molecules exhibited π–π* transition features of the D fragment and π bridge. Moreover, some similar ICT characteristics from the D and π to A fragments could obtain outstanding light absorption, which was conducive for improving JSC. The absorption spectra of X-1 were also compared with those of 1–5 (Fig. S4c, ESI†). X-1 had narrower and weaker absorption than 1–5. The effective capture of solar photons could not be achieved, which might result in smaller JSC. Thus, the other photoelectric properties of X-1 were not further analyzed.

3.3 Natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis
NTO analysis is used to study the properties of electronic excitations. The NTO method aims to separately perform unitary transformation for occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) and virtual MOs, so that only one or very few numbers of orbital pairs have dominant contributions. An NTO pair consists of an occupied NTO and a virtual NTO sharing the same eigenvalue. The eigenvalue of an NTO pair multiplied by 100 is just its percentage contribution to the electron excitation.53
The occupied and virtual NTOs are also deemed as “holes” and “particles”, respectively. The NTO orbitals of the hole and particle pairs for the five molecules are shown in Fig. 5. The holes of the five molecules in the S1 state were mainly concentrated on the D fragments and π bridges and part of the A fragment, while particles were delocalized on the entire molecule. The five molecules had planar structures and the introduction of an alkyne increased the conjugation and led to the holes or particles having strong delocalization on the whole backbone. Hence, S0 → S1 of the five molecules was mainly the π–π* transition with a little contribution of the charge transfer transition from π bridges to A fragments, which was dominated by local excitation. This again showed that in this work, both D and π bridges acted as the electron-donating groups and A acted as the electron-withdrawing fragment for molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration.

3.4 Intermolecular charge transfer rate and recombination
Choosing the right interface model is the premise for analysing intermolecular charge transfer; the porphyrin/fullerene interface model is shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†), which allows for a better interaction between the donor and acceptor materials. Based on the established interface model, kinter-CT and kinter-CR were calculated by using the Marcus semi-classical model; the relevant parameters are listed in Table 2. The CDD maps were used to find the pure charge transfer (CT) excited state of the interface, that is, all holes were delocalized on the donor and all electrons were delocalized on the acceptor (Fig. S6, ESI†). It can be seen from Table 2 that compared with the other two molecules, 1, 3 and 4 have larger VCT, which might be caused by the strong intermolecular interaction and the larger orbital overlap between the donor and acceptor.60 On the contrary, the VCR values of 1, 3, and 4 were smaller due to the weaker orbital overlap between the acceptor and donor.61 This would lead to smaller kinter-CR and larger kinter-CT due to the positive correlation between V and k. All molecules had small and similar λint values, which proved the existence of rigid structures and small geometric relaxation from the ground state to the excited state among the five donors. According to eqn (1), the value of k is the largest when ΔG + λ = 0,62 and the value of k would increase on decreasing |ΔG| when ΔG + λ < 0. A good donor material should have large |ΔGCR| and small |ΔGCT| to ensure efficient charge transfer and smaller charge recombination. For the eqn (1) and (2) in the ESI,† the difference in ΔG was mainly affected by the HOMO levels of the donor when the same acceptor was selected. The lower HOMO levels of 1 and 4 led to higher |ΔGCR|, which would significantly decrease kinter-CR at the 1/PC61BM and 4/PC61BM interfaces. The calculated ΔGCT value of 5/PC61BM was −0.42 eV. Thus, the kinter-CT value of 5/PC61BM was the smallest compared with that of the other complexes because |ΔGCT| was the largest. Increasing kinter-CT and reducing kinter-CR would be beneficial to improve JSC.63,64 The results showed that the kinter-CT values of 1–5/PC61BM were higher than 1013, and the kinter-CR values were lower than 100, indicating that the devices were composed of five donor molecules and PC61BM would have large JSC. To highlight the differences, the ratio of kinter-CT/kinter-CR was calculated. The values of 1/PC61BM, 3/PC61BM and 4/PC61BM were higher than 1015 and were larger than that of other complexes, which might result in more effective charge transfer and higher JSC. Herein, 1, 3 and 4 as donors might obtain more excellent performance.

4. Conclusion
The purpose of this work was to provide a strategy for improving the VOC of porphyrin small molecule donors with the A–π–D–π–A configuration. Therefore, we tried to use the energy level gradient-distribution strategy to screen nine π bridges and construct five novel donor molecules. In order to confirm the strategy, the FMO energy levels of all molecules composed of nine π bridges were compared. It was found that using this strategy could reduce the HOMO energy levels of the molecules. When PC61BM was selected as the acceptor material, the VOC of devices could be improved. The photoelectric properties of the five molecules were determined, which revealed that the VOC could be increased without losing JSC and FF by using the gradient-distribution screening strategy. The five molecules could function as candidates for high-performance OSCs. We hope that this simple design strategy could provide theoretical guidance for the selection of π bridges in designing porphyrin donors.
5. Outlook
PCE is an important index to evaluate the performance of OSCs. The order of PCEs was predicted by analysing the photoelectric properties of five molecules. The absorption range of the five molecules covered the UV-visible region and even extended to the near-infrared region, which was conducive to capture more photons. All molecules with planar conformations could enhance intermolecular π–π packing and increase carrier mobility, exhibiting similar ICT characteristics and sufficient ΔEL–L to facilitate the effective dissociation of excitons. Among them, 1, 3 and 4 might obtain higher JSC (especially 1) due to the wider absorption as well as the larger value of kinter-CT/kinter-CR at the interface. Moreover, 1 and 4 also had large VOC. Therefore, the order of PCEs of the five molecules is predicted to be 1 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 5. According to the above-mentioned sorting, when molecules with the A–π–D–π–A configuration are designed, selecting π-1 and π-4 as π bridges are more beneficial to improve the device performance.
