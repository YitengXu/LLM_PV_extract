    , Accepted 22nd September 2021First published on 25th September 2021AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have expanded into a burgeoning topic in materials science and engineering. Their success mostly stems from the versatility of their structure that can be diversely designed by precise control over the assembly. We conduct a critical review on the design and synthesis of MIL-101 MOFs, assessing the viability and applications of their diversified structures. Previous reviews are limited to the MIL-101(Cr). On the contrary, this study presents the synthesis strategies, the merits, and the limitations of the different MIL-101 metal analogues, including Fe, Al, V, Ti, Sc, and Mn. Furthermore, we review the literature on the multivariate type of MIL-101 (MTV-MIL-101), whereby pairwise combinations of metals are involved in the framework. We discuss how the synthesis parameters such as temperature, medium pH, and ratios of precursors intimately influence the final product characteristics. This study moreover presents the effects of changes in these parameters on the final framework structure. For instance, other polymorphs like MIL-88, MIL-53, MOF-235, MIL-47, and MIL-67 were detected in the final product. Finally, the recent applications of MIL-101 in adsorption, catalysis, photocatalysis, membrane preparation, sensor design, and drug delivery are presented and discussed.Mahmoud Y. ZorainyMahmoud Y.

1. Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous crystalline compounds comprising an infinite array of repeating small building units. These units include metal ions or clusters connected to polydentate organic ligands through covalent or iono-covalent bonds forming multidimensional networks. They were designated by the international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) as a subclass of coordination polymers (CPs) that contain “potential voids”.1,2 Nevertheless, MOFs are also referred to as structures varying from 0D (also called metal–organic polyhedra “MOPs”), 1D, 2D, and up to 3D frameworks. These are considered as having large, accessible cages of regular shapes. They possess remarkably high surface area and pore volumes, and they are capable of trapping different molecules within these cavities. These materials were proven to have substantial benefits in a wide range of applications, including gas storage, separation, and heterogeneous catalysis.3
Prior to discussing recent advances related to MIL-101 as a particular MOF structure, some general features of MOFs will be recalled in order to illustrate the reasons to select MIL-101 as the object of this review. Describing MOFs as crystalline materials does not necessarily imply the solid, robust structure of their ordinary powder form. Amorphous metal–organic frameworks (aMOFs) in which the crystallinity of the basic building blocks is maintained over short distances are possible, whereas the long-range periodic order has been of major interest in this discipline.4 Controlling the degree of periodicity to middle- and short-ranged networks has given rise to glass and liquid CPs (4th generation).5,6 Furthermore, soft, flexible, or dynamic MOFs are also a new subclass of these materials (3rd generation). In this subclass, a reversible flexing (crystal-to-crystal transformation) of the framework takes place under the effect of external chemical/physical stimuli such as guest encapsulation/elimination, temperature, pressure, light, or electric field.7 In addition, by taking the time evolution into account as another dimension while studying these dynamic networks, 4D-MOFs have been defined.8 Advances in synthesis and characterization led to a plethora of different MOFs, which led to a wide range of applications like sensing, drug delivery,9 and many more.10
In 3D-MOFs of permanent porosity (2nd generation), the robustness of these structures imparts constant lattice parameters and a preserved pore volume as long as the structure is kept intact, and no guest molecules are included. Over the past decades, Férey's group has profoundly investigated the different topologies and synthesis procedures of such porous materials belonging to this type.11–21 Among their notable contributions is the MIL-101 chromium(III) terephthalate MOF that held the world's record of the highest surface area and largest pore volume of SBET ≈ 4230 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir ≈ 5900 m2 g−1) and Vpore ≈ 2.15 cm3 g−1 for years until the advent of other MOFs of comparable or even exceeding values (Table 1).16 Nevertheless, with this outstanding progress, obtaining the theoretical simulated surface area is still elusive. For instance, the structures based on the infinite benzene rings (poly-p-phenylene) have a theoretical surface area ≥10577 m2 g−1 (Fig. 1).22

It is believed that high surface areas can be obtained by introducing larger linkers within the structure through the involvement of more benzene-ring-containing linkers (e.g., the tritopic 1,3,5-tris(4′-carboxy[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)benzene “H3BBC” and ditopic 1,4-bis-p-carboxyphenyl buta-1,3-diene “H2BCPBD” linkers, in case of DUT-60).26 Other simulations revealed a new ceiling, surpassing this surface area limit regarding MOFs (≈14600 m2 g−1) that would be attainable by replacing the linkers of repeating phenyls with the more “area-efficient” acetylene extended ones (as in the case of NU-109 and NU-110).25 However, while approaching this limit, these MOFs become highly susceptible to collapse upon activation (solvent molecules removal from the pores) unless supercritical fluid extraction is involved. In such a method, the pores of the material are evacuated, and the included solvent molecules are removed from the material matrix by using a flow of supercritical fluid (usually carbon dioxide) as the extracting solvent. The supercritical solvent is them evacuated from the pores without formation of an interphase meniscus which would impose constraints on the pore walls.27–29 Nevertheless, only a few MOFs with these highly extended linkers were reported because of their sophisticated syntheses that in turn would make them costly materials.25,30
Among all MOFs, MIL-101 MOFs are distinguished with both a rigid architecture and high porosity. Furthermore, they show higher chemical and hydrothermal stabilities than other MOFs. The incorporation of different metal ions in the lattice structure of MIL-101 MOFs revealed different properties that could be useful in a variety of applications. MIL-101(Cr) synthesis and applications were reviewed elsewhere,31 whereas other metal MIL-101 analogues were not covered in previous reviews so far. Considering the toxic nature of chromium, limiting the utilization of MIL-101 in practical applications, further attention should be paid to other metal MIL-101 frameworks.
Herein, we review the MIL-101 isomorphs prepared from other metal ions besides chromium, including their functionalized forms and chemical and thermal stability. Mixed-metal structures of two or more metal types are also reviewed. The chromium-type MOF design history and most recent advancements in their synthesis and modifications will be briefly presented.
2. Design of MIL-101 metal–organic framework
Férey et al. confirmed the concept of a priori design and tailoring of MOFs through targeted chemistry14 and computational modeling,32 which predicted the existence of one of the most remarkable MOFs; MIL 101(Cr).16 MIL stands for Materiau de l'Institut Lavoisier. This MOF shows excellent stability against air, water, and acids, along with extremely high surface area and pore volume (SBET ≥ 4000 m2 g−1, Vpore ≥ 2.0 cm3 g−1).16
As designed, the unit cell of MIL-101 consists of metal-(III) trimers (Fig. 2) crosslinked by terephthalic acid [1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (H2BDC)] to give a super tetrahedron (ST), marked as the secondary building unit (SBU) of this MOF (Fig. 2b). Each trimer includes three octahedra with the metal atom to be in the center of every octahedron (Fig. 2a); two of them have a water molecule bonded to it, while the third one is bonded to a halide or hydroxide ion, depending on the preparation conditions (Fig. 2(i)). Each octahedron is connected laterally to another one by the carboxylic groups of two BDC molecules on both sides, yielding four connections with the other two and a total of six bidentate carboxylic linkers in each trimer (Fig. 2(ii and iii)). All octahedra are connected through the same μ3-oxo atom found on the one vertex directed towards the center of the trimer (Fig. 2a(i)).

(e) Mobil Thirty-Nine (MTN) topology. (i) The elaborated form of the MOF basic trimer. (ii) A single SBU/linkers unit connection. (iii) The corner-sharing connection of STs within the MOF. Adapted from ref. 31, 33 and 34 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The trimers occupy the four vertices of the SBU tetrahedron, whereas the organic ligands represent the six edges of the super tetrahedron to give a microporous structure (∼8.6 Å free aperture) as depicted in (Fig. 2b). The connection of the SBUs propagates through the vertices (Fig. 2(iii)) to give two types of mesoporous cages delimited by 20 and 28 STs, respectively (Fig. 2c and d). The smaller cages enclose ∼29 Å-diameter pores of pentagonal-shaped windows of ∼12 Å aperture size. In comparison, the larger cages possess internal diameters of ∼34 Å that exhibit hexagonal-shaped windows of ∼14.5 Å × 16 Å openings.
Thus, two mesoporous cages are contained within this structure with a ratio of 2:1 and accessible pore volumes of ∼12700 Å3 and ∼20600 Å3, respectively. The resulting crystalline solid is a 3D corner-shared network with an augmented mobil thirty-nine (MTN) zeotype architecture (Fig. 2e), showing a cubic system cell with a volume of 702000 Å3.
Other Cr-based MOFs viz., MIL-88, and MIL-89 were reported by Serre et al. whereby the chromium trimers were condensed with various ditopic carboxylate linkers (fumaric and muconic acid, respectively).14 Unlike MIL-101, the conventional ab initio structural determination methods have been successfully implemented to solve the structures of these already-synthesized MOFs from their powder patterns. On the contrary, the same procedures did not apply to the crystal structure determination of MIL-101. Its powder diffraction pattern was ruled out for being too complex in spite of its high crystallinity.32
The computational approach was undertaken to predict the MIL-101 structure based on the experimental data of the chemical composition and dimensionality.32 Its chemical formula was found to be Cr3F·(H2O)2·O·[(O2·C)–C6H4–(CO2)]3 revealing a metal-to-ligand ratio of 1:1.16 Furthermore, a notably high surface area (around 4000 m2 g−1, BET) was obtained by nitrogen sorption measurement techniques suggesting a 3D structure.16,32
Following this strategy, several candidates of 3- to 6-ring connections were produced through the direct-space assembly of the building units using the automated assembly of secondary building units (AASBU) method. In this method, numerous combinations of pre-defined SBUs are explored concerning auto-assembly in the 3D space.32 The nodes were considered as rigid bodies and the linkers “or struts” as flexible ones. They were modeled as (MxLy)inorg and (CnLm)org, where M, C, and L represent the metal centers, carbon skeleton, and the ligand atoms (oxygen atoms of the connecting carboxylate groups), respectively. The Lorg … Linorg were chosen as the “sticky-atoms” pairs responsible for holding the linkers and the nodes together as well as the propagation of the assembly, where Lorg and Linorg are defined as equally possible linkage points with a high priority of overlapping.
Applying a series of simulated Monte Carlo annealing and energy-minimization steps has limited the number of candidates to two candidates (the 5- and 6-ring assemblies), which were compatible with the periodicity and symmetry of these infinite arrangements. These connections were derived from similar networks in other MOFs and zeolites, complying with the geometrical constraints. The assembly of the supertetrahedra is believed to propagate through the “corner-sharing” route conserving the 5-rings and 6-rings constructions into the MTN zeotype architecture of space group Fdm. The calculated powder pattern obtained from these simulations was compared to the pattern achieved experimentally to verify the matching of both structures. Hence, the MIL-101 framework was confirmed to follow these connections and assemblies, resulting in the development of pentagonal and hexagonal cages within the structure and occupying the MTN topology (Fig. 2).
3. Synthesis, activation, and characterization of MIL-101(Cr)
The preparation route and reaction conditions are crucial to the growth of the targeted structure. The conventional synthesizing of MOFs usually involves solvothermal/hydrothermal procedures. However, other methods were developed to fulfill other requirements, such as controlling the crystal size, obtaining defect-free crystals, facilitating and accelerating the growth, and increasing the production yield. Among these innovative and faster methods are the microwave-assisted,35,36 sonochemical,36–38 mechanochemical,39–41 and electrochemical methods.42,43
Other methods were developed to achieve specific purposes at the expense of preparation time. For instance, the solvent evaporation and vapor diffusion methods require very long preparation times that may reach several weeks or months to avoid elevated reaction temperature.44,45 Other routes may include ionic liquids, microfluidic synthesis, and dry-gel conversion techniques.46
3.1 Conventional solvothermal/hydrothermal synthesis
G. Férey reported for the first time the synthesis of the MIL-101(Cr) metal–organic framework employing the conventional hydrothermal technique.16 Briefly, chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O) was dissolved in water, and an equivalent amount of terephthalic acid and hydrofluoric acid were added following the chemical formula stated in (Fig. 2(ii) and Table 2). Since the chromium salt is highly soluble in water and the BDC ligand is sparingly soluble, a dark blue suspension was obtained. The suspension was then transferred into a hydrothermal bomb and kept for 8 h at 220 °C, yielding a light sea-green-colored suspension containing the targeted crystals (Fig. 3). The resulting products were octahedral particles of the MIL-101 metal–organic framework (Fig. 4) along with some other needle-shaped ones resulting from the unreacted and recrystallized BDC linker.

The products were then filtered to separate the recrystallized H2BDC particles and collect the fine MOF crystals. Usually, after the MOF synthesis and separation, an activation process takes place, in which the undesirable molecules of the solvent, linker, and side-products within the pores are removed. In the case of MIL-101, it was activated by a solvothermal treatment using ethanol at 100 °C for 20 h to evacuate the free acid molecules clogging the pores.
The activated powder showed a high crystallinity product with a calculated low-density of 0.62 g cm−3. Nitrogen sorption measurements showed a large surface area and pore volume of SBET ≈ 4230 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir ≈ 5900 m2 g−1) and Vpore ≈ 2.1 cm3 g−1. Besides, a characteristic type-I isotherm was given with two secondary uptakes at P/P0 = 0.1 and 0.2, representing the two microporous windows in agreement with simulations. It is worth noting that the activated sample revealed a 20% higher surface area compared to the “as-synthesized” one, confirming that activation is a mandatory step.
This MOF shows good thermal and chemical stabilities in the air, retaining its chemical identity for months, whereby the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the structure was kept intact at temperatures up to 275 °C.16 Moreover, further structural and morphological analyses were performed and reported separately.49 Depending on electron diffraction (ED), high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), imaging was done at low magnification due to the sensitivity of the crystals to the electron beam.49 TEM allowed getting images of the octahedral-shaped crystals of MIL-101 at different orientations (Fig. 5).49

At this point, a brief overview of recent advances in the synthesis and functionalization of MIL-101(Cr) will be reported. For a thorough presentation of this topic, the reader is referred to the review of Ahn et al.31 MIL-101(Cr) was found to be obtainable over a wide range of parameters. Nevertheless, the synthesis process is still considered sensitive to the applied reaction conditions. Consequently, modifications to the reported procedures, even what has been deemed a “minute change”, may result in some inconsistency. In some cases, the hydrothermal bomb's size, which is not usually reported, can cause variations in the results. It was therefore found useful to highlight the prominent boundaries (limitations) of the reaction parameters that directly affect the properties of the produced MIL-101(Cr). Table 2 summarizes some of the recent advances in the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr).
In attempts to get higher quality crystals at shorter reaction time and lower temperature, different synthesis parameters were investigated including, the type of chromium salt, reactants molar ratios, dilution, acidic/basic medium, additives, temperature, and time of reaction. These works can be summarized as follows:
- Regarding the synthesis:
(i) (Type of salt): it was found that chromium chloride hexahydrate (CrCl3·6H2O) and chromium trioxide (chromium(VI) oxide, CrO3) can replace the nitrate salt as the starting metal ions source to prepare MIL-101(Cr) and its functionalized derivatives.50–54
(ii) (Molar ratio): the usual practice of using the stoichiometric equimolar ratio of reactants has been questioned as the optimal ratio in acidic media. Some reports have found such an equivalent ratio to be the perfect match,55 whereas others suggested a slightly higher ratio of Cr to BDC would yield better results.56,57 On the other hand, attempts based on a double linker to metal ratio reported better properties.58 Hence, the ideal ratio is still a matter of discussion.
(iii) (Dilution): the amount of water added to the reaction mixture or the degree of dilution can definitely drive the formation of the MIL-101 structure or one of its framework isomers.59 The MIL-101 phase was found to be favored when using higher water content at low acidity.59 In addition, the amount of added water controls the size of the produced crystals, whereby doubling the amount of water would decrease the particle size almost to half of its initial value.50,56,57
(iv) (Acidic/basic medium): controlling the pH of the reaction medium is crucial to the crystallization, growth, and purity of MOFs.60 Originally, MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized under the influence of HF.16 However, other syntheses involving acidic media focused on the achievement of the same stable structure without incorporating hydrofluoric acid (HF-free) as a highly toxic, eco-hostile, and corrosive chemical. The impact of using other less hazardous inorganic acids as mineralizers was also investigated. Nitric acid (HNO3), as well as hydrochloric acid (HCl), seem to be more promising alternatives, whereby a comparable particle size was achieved but with a 20% higher surface area61 and 70% better yield.62
(v) On the other side, syntheses investigating the influence of basic conditions were explored. Initial dissolution of the salt and the linker would result in a low pH (2.6–3.3). By adding different inorganic and organic alkalis, the reaction would be adjusted for a more basic medium.50 Under such conditions, the dissolution and deprotonation extent of the BDC linker would increase, motivating the coordination between the metal ion and the carboxylic ligand.60 Increasing the pH (4.0–5.0) through NaOH addition was found to decrease the particle size and the surface area as well.50,63 However, incorporating tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH, pH = 6.0–6.5) would recover a 100% pure MIL-101(Cr) phase as it prevents the recrystallization of BDC.55 Moreover, synthesis using TMAOH would provide an equivalent surface area and a high yield of 88% at a lower reaction temperature.
(vi) (Additives): organic monocarboxylic acids, like acetic acid, stearic acid, and benzoic acid with some of its derivatives, were reported to replace HF in the reaction medium and successfully producing the MIL-101 phase at a slightly lower reaction temperature.33,64,65 When present, monocarboxylic acids act as modulators for the reaction. They contribute to the structure formation as competitive linkers, regulating nucleation and growth rates and controlling the particle sizes of the produced MIL-101.66 Replacing up to 30%(mol.) of the introduced BDC with a monocarboxylic acid can result in smaller particles with half the size of the unmodulated samples.65 Moreover, monocarboxylic acid molecules can also function as phase-selector, offering kinetic control to the self-assembly of the MOF.66 At lower concentrations of monocarboxylic modulators, the reaction is directed to forming the MIL-101 framework. Increasing the concentration would shift the reaction towards the production of another framework isomer.66,67
(vii) Acid/additive-free synthesis was examined as a more environment-friendly process, in which the MIL-101 was synthesized without the incorporation of acids or any other additive, just the three main components: the metal ion source, the linker, and the solvent. These trials were reported to be successful; however, excessive washing and activation treatments are required to evacuate the MOF pores.50,55,58,63,68,69
(viii) (Temperature and time): the synthesis temperature and time are considered the most critical parameters when it comes to MOF synthesis. Both parameters greatly influence driving the reaction towards different products, whereby various Cr-BDC networks would result and coexist depending on these two factors.70 Hence, achieving pure crystals of a single phase at a lower reaction temperature and a shorter reaction time has been the leading research trigger for energy-saving purposes. Hydrothermal synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) based on other reaction conditions (discussed above) can extend the reaction time from 4 h up to 120 h, at temperatures between 180–220 °C.54,65 However, the temperature and time of reaction are mainly dependent on the source of energy applied, the efficiency of energy delivery, and its interactions. Thus, other synthesis methods and techniques were developed for better results, as will be presented in the following subsections.
- For post-synthesis treatment (activation process):
(viii) Alkaline media were found to help the dissolution of the organic acid linker during the post-synthesis purification step (activation) to eliminate the recrystallized linker from the MOF pores.71 Inorganic hydroxides were shown not to be as effective as the organic amines and amides, which brought the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as one of the most used solvents in the activation process, especially when using ultrasound waves.63,71
(ix) Also, for the activation, fluoride-containing salts like ammonium fluoride (NH4F) are effective when applied in a consecutive sequence of washing steps by hot water, ethanol, and an aqueous solution of NH4F, whereby the surface area was significantly enhanced by almost 50%.72,73 Such alkaline halide exchange solutions are believed to be essential for removing any organic and inorganic species trapped within the pores. Moreover, the fluoride anion is also believed to provide the nuclei formation and promote crystallinity and crystal growth.72,74
- Scaling up:
(x) Departing from the usual laboratory scale, Janiak et al. scaled up the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) by performing it in a 3 L autoclave.33 Upon scaling up, they investigated the changes in the effect of various parameters, including different acidic modulator/additive types and concentrations, washing procedure, stirring, and reaction temperature and time on the resulting products. They could obtain more than 100 g MIL-101 per batch with a yield of 70% and a surface area of SBET = 4000 m2 g−1 in a large-scale fluoride-free process.33
- Mixed-solvothermal synthesis:
Based on previous results, especially on conducting the reaction in basic media and aiming at the achievement of the MOF synthesis at a lower reaction temperature, Tan et al. reported the growth of MIL-101(Cr) crystals in a mixed-solvent environment.75 DMF was added to the aqueous reaction medium to improve the dispersion of the H2BDC linker. As a cosolvent, DMF was chosen for its high miscibility in water, besides its ability to dissolve the organic linker creating a homogeneous mixture. Different ratios of DMF/H2O were studied, and MIL-101 was reported to be achievable in the range of 0–0.5, and a ratio of 0.2 resulted in uniform crystals of average particle size of 200 nm. Synthesis at this ratio effectively lowered the reaction temperature to (140–180 °C) compared to 220 °C for conventional synthesis. However, the highest crystallinity was obtained at 160 °C. The sample also exhibited the highest surface area, pore size, and adsorption properties compared to the other HF and HF-free samples prepared in the same study (Table 2). A yield of around 50% is usually achieved in similar preparations. Nevertheless, in this study, a remarkable yield of 83% was reached at a lower temperature. All these advantages would make this method a less energy-consuming route and a further step towards the industrial production of MOFs.
3.2 Microwave-assisted synthesis
Microwave-assisted synthesis is considered one of the most promising non-conventional techniques for MOF production as it critically reduces the overall processing time and provides tight control of energy consumption. Besides, the yield is often comparable to that of the traditional methods.50,63 Microwave technology allows fine-tuning of various MOF properties, including particle size, morphology, and phase selectivity.36,81
Microwave as an alternative synthesis route was recently found to produce MOFs that are not achievable by any other route owing to the selective heating of the reaction components. The heat production in microwave systems is volumetric as the reaction medium itself is internally heated by the rotation of the dipoles in the molecules composing the system, compared to the conventional heating methods, in which energy is delivered by conduction, convection, and radiation.35,81 This approach enables the utilization of higher reaction temperatures (superheating of the solvents) with low energy consumption and reaction time (by the direct “in-core” heating). Furthermore, it allows particle size control with a narrower crystal size distribution thanks to the separate control of crystal nucleation and growth rates. Microwave synthesis also distinguishes for the higher yields and purer-phase materials owing to gradientless temperature fields and faster heating rate.82,83
MIL-101(Cr) was first synthesized utilizing microwave irradiation by Jhung et al., following the same procedure as in the hydrothermal method, namely using an equimolar solution of precursors in the presence of HF at a slightly lower reaction temperature (210 °C instead of 220 °C).77 The preparation took place at a constant power of 600 W and different reaction times. Increasing the time over 60 min resulted in the formation of a different phase. Heating via microwave showed a great ability to control the dimensions of the produced crystals in the nanoscale range (40–90 nm for short crystallization times of a few minutes) while maintaining their monodispersed size. The optimized crystals obtained at the reaction time of 40 min were of a surface area of 3200 m2 g−1 (BET) and pore volume of 2.3 cm3 g−1.
Many other attempts were further made to enhance the properties of the resulting MIL-101 crystals and study the interaction of different synthesis parameters with microwaves.50,63,72,78,84–88 Moreover, phase selectivity of the microwave-assisted synthesis over the conventional method was established by Khan et al., whereby the MIL-101 phase was favored over any other Cr-BDC phases at the optimized heating route.70,89 In such a study, MIL-101 crystals were still produced at reaction times exceeding 1 h (up to 3 or 4 h), which contradicts the findings of Jhung et al. discussed earlier.70,77 However, the preparation was initiated from a chloride salt of chromium instead of the usual nitrate. The irradiation took place at a constant power of 400 W, which is lower than that used previously, indicating the high dependence of the resulting particles on the process conditions. In addition, it was found that the phase transformation occurs at extended reaction times due to the degradation of the MIL-101 structure under these conditions.
In general, adopting MOFs in the industry is still limited because of the problems facing their large-scale production. Despite being of obvious potential interest for large-scale MOF production, microwave synthesis industrial deployment faces some resistance as the process is not yet fully understood. Thomas-Hillman and Laybourn et al. discussed the knowledge gaps in this production technology.89 They clearly stated the importance of studying the penetration depth, in addition to any other available information like the dielectric properties, frequency of the electromagnetic waves, and the power-energy dissipation. Incorporating these points in future studies would help in comprehending the interactions of the operating parameters in the long run.
In another study, Soltanolkottabi et al. followed a combination of both synthesis methods (microwave and hydrothermal) to control the morphology of the resulting MOF and study the effect of microwaves versus the conventional heating on particle size.79 Reaction initiation (nucleation) took place rapidly under microwaves, and then the resulting nuclei were transferred into an electrically heated oven, where crystal growth can proceed separately. Following the same procedures of nucleation and propagation based on the heating method, they were able to produce nanoparticles in the range of (60–155 nm) while controlling the final particle shape. They also found an optimized water content (degree of dilution) to attain a higher nucleation rate. In this work, they tackled the higher dissolution of the BDC linker and the conflicting trend of reducing the concentration of reactants on nucleation and growth rates. However, they pointed out the contradiction with Jhung et al. expressed by the smaller particle sizes at higher pH that was not observed in their case.77
3.3 Mechanochemical synthesis
Among other non-conventional synthesis techniques, the mechanochemical method is considered the most eco-friendly process, as the reaction takes place at room temperature without the involvement of any solvent (solvent-less technique). Reaction initiates through the cleavage of the intramolecular bonds as a result of applying external mechanical forces (i.e., grinding) followed by chemical transformations leading to the production of the desired MOF.90 As a solvent-free method, it was proven to be advantageous over other techniques as no liquid wastes are produced after the reaction (except for water as a side-product), thus saves many post-treatment steps of purification. Besides, short reaction times, in terms of minutes, are required for this process.91 Nevertheless, despite the growing interest and successful investigations of this method, it is still limited for its different variables that can affect the properties of the obtained results.
To this end, Leng et al. synthesized a MOF through a semi-mechanochemical process.80 In their study, chromium nitrate salt was ground and mixed with the H2BDC linker for 30 min at room temperature; then, the resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. The solid-phase reaction took place at 220 °C for 4 h (Table 2). Among their worthy findings, good MOF crystals of a slightly lower surface area and pore volume compared to other solvent-included ones were obtained. However, it turns out that the resultant solids were nitrated-MOF crystals (MIL-101-NO2) instead of the targeted MIL-101(Cr), which somehow explains the slight drop in the mentioned properties. They also reported that such results are not achievable by any other chromium-type precursor (oxide or chloride). Moreover, different reactant ratios were studied along with different reaction times and implied that the MIL-101 crystals are still achievable with a ratio of Cr/BDC higher than or equal to 0.7, but not 2.0, and a reaction time of more than 2 h until 40 h. Nevertheless, the best reaction conditions were determined to be of reactants ratio of 1.5 (Cr/BDC) and a reaction time of 4 h. Longer times would result in more nitro-groups bonded to the structure and thus a lower surface area structure.
In the mechanochemical synthesis, owing to the solid–solid reaction taking place under grinding, the degree of the product crystallinity, the density of crystal defects, and the resulting particle size would be a matter of discussion. In the above-cited method of Leng et al., MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized hydrothermally with and without the addition of HF for comparison purposes.80 The SEM images of the hydrothermally-synthesized samples revealed the formation of the recognizable octahedral crystals of the MIL-101 framework with an average particle size around 300–500 nm (Fig. 6b and c). Smaller crystals are still observed, maintaining the same octahedral shape. By contrast, the product of the mechanochemical synthesis did not show any definite crystal shape (Fig. 6a). It was rather an aggregate of smaller particles of irregular granular shape, expressing a particle size much smaller than 200 nm (reaching 40 nm). However, such results were from the microscope data analysis, and no other particle size analysis technique was implemented to confirm these findings.

On the other hand, the SEM images can definitely confirm that the degree of crystal deformation in the samples synthesized hydrothermally is much lower than that of the materials produced by the mechanochemical technique (Fig. 6).80 In the hydrothermal synthesis, the dissolution of the precursors prior to reaction, results in the free metal ions hydration spheres formation, and the used solvent facilitates the movement of these ions. Hence, the nucleation and growth of the MIL-101 crystals can proceed, resulting in the definite octahedral shape. In the mechanochemical method, however, the metal ions are bound to the initial metal-salt crystals, and in a solvent-free (neat-grinding) technique, the interactions of these metal ions with organic linkers will be limited to those in direct contact.40,92 As a result, the mechanochemically-produced MIL-101 crystals would show higher ill-formation than those of the hydrothermal route.80
With the high defect density resulting from this neat grinding mechanochemical technique, the products were expected to show lower crystallinity compared to hydrothermal samples. However, the given XRD diffraction patterns showed a fairly good crystallinity agreeing with the simulated one.80 Thus, the MOF structure is still formed on the molecular scale. Nevertheless, the XRD pattern showed broader peaks corresponding to smaller crystal domains.
Research on mechanochemical synthesis is still very trending, especially with the recent liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) technique, in which a minimal amount of solvent is introduced with the reaction mixture to increase the mobility of the reactants on the molecular scale.40 This leads to accelerated reactions in shorter times.92 Furthermore, the use of different liquids that can dissolve and coordinate with the metal precursor (e.g., DMF, ethanol, or water) was found to influence the formation of specific topologies, hence considered as structure-directing agents.93
4. Isomorphic MIL-101 frameworks
Based on the above-mentioned properties of MIL-101, several promising approaches were reported to produce the same structural morphology, but with different compositions, a characteristic referred to as “isomorphism”.94 Simply, the term implies equal forms, which technically points out the existence of some compounds with the same crystalline structure. Isomorphous MOFs share an identical space group, and so they deserve the same general empirical formula based on nodes and linkers.95
Re-building an isostructural MIL-101 framework, but with different trivalent metal ions rather than chromium, or other ditopic ligands than the BDC, has been studied, aiming for new and hopefully better chemical and physical properties. Nevertheless, the term isomorphic is usually adopted in the field of MOFs to refer to those recreated MOFs having different equivalent metal centers. However, those built from the H2BDC linkers of different functional groups (Fig. 7) – despite being of the same morphology – are rather designated as functionalized MIL-101.31,54 Herein, we introduce the MIL-101 isomorphs and their functionalized forms only, excluding the chromium as its functionalized structures were covered elsewhere.31
 Fig. 7  Examples of the functional groups on the terephthalic acid linker reported for chromium-type MIL-101 metal–organic frameworks.31,54 
4.1 MIL-101(Fe), iron isomorph
The most popular candidate elements are those around Cr in the first transition series (3d-series, Z = 21–30), as they possess stable trivalent ions of comparable size and chemistry. Starting with iron, the very early study by Bauer et al. resulted in the successful production of amino-functionalized MIL-101(Fe) (NH2-MIL-101(Fe)).96 This study aimed at investigating the effect of different preparation conditions on three isoreticular MOFs based on comparable trivalent metal ions and BDC bi-dentate linkers, one of which is MIL-101(Fe). Furthermore, the transformation of the MIL-101 structure to other equivalent forms of totally different crystal structures was studied, expressing a phenomenon known as “polymorphism”, which will be discussed in the next section. It is worth mentioning that this study is the pioneering one for the synthesis of iron MOFs. In this study, the amino-functionalized MIL-101(Fe) was prepared from a 2:1 molar solution, in which ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) was mixed with 2-amino terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC), then dissolved in DMF (Table 3). Heating in a stainless-steel autoclave at 110 °C for 24 h resulted in a dark-brown suspension of the targeted product (Fig. 8a).

 Fig. 8  Hydrothermal synthesis of the iron isomorph expressing color changes at different stages. (a) Amino-functionalized MIL-101(Fe) (b) unfunctionalized MIL-101(Fe). 
On the other hand, Taylor-Pashow et al. first synthesized MIL-101(Fe) as a pure phase, whereby the whole same structure was obtained with the ferric ions replacing the chromium cations.97 It was prepared from an “equimolar” solution of ferric chloride hexahydrate and H2BDC linker dissolved in DMF (Table 3). The solution was held for 10 min at 150 °C in a microwave oven. The particles were centrifuged and washed with DMF and ethanol to remove any unreacted components. In that case, the activation process was not essential as the synthesis was initialized from a solution, not a suspension like in the chromium case. This method resulted in Fe-MOF of particle size around 200 nm and a yield of 20%. The surface area was reported to be in the range of ∼4000 m2 g−1 (Langmuir).97
In the same study, partly amino-functionalized MIL-101 (NH2-MIL-101(Fe)) was also prepared by replacing a portion of the terephthalic acid with 2-amino terephthalic acid in a one-pot synthesis. The preparation was reported to be successful when the percentage of the amino-functionalized linker was less than 20%. Higher percentages would result in a different MOF morphology. Combining the advantages of this remarkable structure, along with an ion safer than chromium, encouraged more investigations on the Fe-based MOFs. Besides, the addition of amino groups to the MIL-101(Fe) structure was intended to increase the attachment of some biological guest molecules covalently. Due to their biodegradability, both the MIL-101(Fe) and its amine-functionalized counterparts were efficient platforms for delivering imaging contrast agents and slow release of drugs and prodrugs.97
In other studies, Kholdeeva et al. prepared a MIL-101(Fe) framework based on the previous procedures of Taylor-Pashow; however, solvothermally in a Teflon-lined stainless steel bomb.98,99 In agreement with Bauer's findings, the MIL-101(Fe) was prepared from a “2:1 molar ratio” solution in DMF at 110 °C for 20 h (Table 3). The initial clear orange solution of the precursors turns into an orange suspension after the synthesis. Then, upon washing with hot ethanol, filtration, and drying, the powder of MIL-101(Fe) of the same color was obtained (Fig. 8b). The products had a BET-specific surface area (SSA) in the range of 3200–3400 m2 g−1. The ferric analogue of the MIL-101 framework showed superior catalytic activity in the solvent-free allylic oxidation of alkenes with molecular oxygen.
MIL-101(Fe) is considered the second most studied MIL-101 analogue after chromium. However, its synthesis is far more challenging than that of the chromium isomorph as the reaction is more sensitive to slight variations in any of the synthesis parameters, and it can be easily converted to another MOF type. Moreover, a single pure phase is not usually produced, as a mixture of two or more phases may be obtained.96,100,101 For instance, Metzler-Nolte et al. reported the production of dissimilar structure despite following the same procedure of Taylor-Pashow.97,100 Nevertheless, by diluting the initial solution, the MIL-101 phase became the major phase.100 The presence of some crystals of the other phase was still noticeable, even at higher dilution. On the other hand, doubling the metal ions concentration, in line with Bauer's findings, would favor a purer phase of MIL-101, even at a higher temperature of 150 °C instead of 110 °C.96,100
Synthesis of the iron analogue and its functionalized derivatives have also been reported from iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and iron(III) perchlorate hydrate (Fe(OCl4)3·nH2O) as metal ion sources.102,103 The attempt of using acetic acid as a monocarboxylic acid modulator was furthermore reported to be successful, and the produced MIL-101(Fe) had a surface area around (SBET = 2670 m2 g−1) and pore volume of (Vpore = 0.75 cm3 g−1).104 Variations in synthesis conditions with the successful achievement of MIL-101(Fe) and many of its functionalized forms are listed in Table 3. The stability of the iron isomorph in moist air and water has been doubted, and it was sometimes mentioned that it would not last for long in such conditions and may degrade quickly.105,106 Comparatively, some Fe-BDC MOFs were reported to have very low stability in water, while others that occupy the same structure were of higher stability.100,107,108 However, this point was not studied in depth so far. Furthermore, the synthesis of such compounds was found to be highly sensitive to the reaction solvent. Nevertheless, studies focusing on the pristine unfunctionalized form (MIL-101(Fe)) are not plentiful. On the other hand, phase transition in the synthesis of the amino-functionalized form (NH2-MIL-101(Fe)) is more often reported in literature.101
Horcajada, Serre et al. were able to incorporate a series of functionalized BDC linkers, whereby pristine, 2-amino, 2-bromo, 2-chloro, 2-trifluoromethyl, and 2,5-dimethyl functionalized-MIL-101(Fe) were successfully obtained.102 In parallel, a set of elongated ditopic carboxylates (2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate “NDC” and 4,4′-biphenyl dicarboxylate “BPDC”) was used to replace the BDC linker into the main framework for extra-large pore apertures (Fig. 9). All structures were reported to be achieved solvothermally at temperatures around 100 °C and 150 °C and reaction time from 2 h to 16 h, except for the amino- and trifluoromethyl-functionalized ones which were obtainable via microwave at a holding time of 5 min (Table 3).

The XRD patterns of all powders confirmed the formation of the MIL-101 structure. The surface area measurements did not however meet expectations, as the measured values were in the range of hundreds (except NH2- and Cl-MIL-101(Fe)) compared to the predicted thousands of m2 g−1. Such differences in the measured surface area were ascribed to the instability of the obtained products in some solvents, in which the conservation of the formed structure was highly dependent on the preserving solvent. Dissociation and single-crystal to single-crystal transformation might take place depending on the nature of this solvent. Most of the products were found to be stable for months in ethanol, DMF, and toluene, whereas in solvents like water and tetrahydrofuran (THF), degradation or phase transformation may take place in hours.
The studies targeting the synthesis and application of the iron isomorph have been rapidly increasing lately, and usually, only one of the above-mentioned synthesis procedures is adopted in these investigations.
4.2 MIL-101(Al), aluminum isomorph
Notwithstanding aluminum not being a transition metal, it has shown the ability to develop the trimeric μ3-oxo cluster, well-known for the 3d-block elements.110,111 Hence, it was reported to have a great potential to form similar MOFs based on the trivalent metal ions, like chromium and iron.112–117 Pure unfunctionalized MIL-101(Al) was however never obtained through direct synthesis up to now; only functionalized forms of this isomorph have been obtained.
The amino-functionalized MIL-101(Al) was first observed in Ahnfeldt et al. investigations about some other type of Al-MOF. The MIL-101 configuration coincidentally resulted within their experimental procedure to prepare another targeted MOF.118 Throughout the followed set of experiments, two types of aluminum salts (nitrate and chloride) were employed in different combinations with the NH2-BDC linker, and a set of protic and aprotic solvents (DMF, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile). The NH2-MIL-101(Al) structure was only formulated when the chloride salt and DMF were used, in addition to a precursor molar ratio of 1:1 or greater in favor of the metal salt. Any other combination would result in a different MOF or none at all. Moreover, a reaction temperature of 125 °C over a duration of 5 h was not sufficient to produce any single MOF phase. A mixture of different phases was always obtained even under these conditions of precursor ratio and solvents.
Serra-Crespo et al. were the first to report the successful synthesis and isolation of the amino-functionalized MIL-101(Al) structure both solvothermally and via microwave in direct-synthesis procedures.119 In such a procedure, aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O) was used as the metal precursor, 2-amino terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) as the linker, and DMF as the solvent (Table 4). Then, the solution was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in an oven at 130 °C for 72 h or 6 h under microwave irradiation. The resulting yellow powder was filtered under vacuum and washed with acetone (Fig. 10). The produced MOF was activated in boiling methanol overnight (nearly 12 h) to remove any undesired species trapped within the pores. The final product was stored at a temperature of 100 °C to prevent moisture capture.

 Fig. 10  Synthesis of the amino-functionalized aluminum isomorph expressing color change between the different steps. 
In contrast, all attempts to obtain MIL-101(Al) in its pure unfunctionalized phase following the exact same steps and reaction conditions resulted in the formation of another Al-MOF of different structure and properties (MIL-53(Al), see Fig. 10). Besides, using the chloride source of aluminum instead of nitrate was emphasized as any attempts at using the nitrate source always failed.120–122 The reported surface area for the activated NH2-MIL-101(Al) was 2100 m2 g−1 (BET), and the pore volume was 0.77 cm3 g−1.119 This Al-framework showed good thermal stability in the air, whereby no signs of decomposition were observed until above 375 °C. However, MeOH and DMF were released around 65 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The amino-functionalized MILs of Cr and Fe usually show a lower decomposition temperature than the pristine structure due to the degradation of the amino group before the linker itself.96,123,124 Hence, introducing Al within the structure of the MIL-101 metal–organic framework would result in a more thermally stable compound compared to the MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-101(Fe), but only if MIL-101(Al) is obtained as a pure phase.
The application of NH2-MIL-101(Al) in the separation of carbon dioxide from a CO2/CH4 mixture showed a higher affinity for adsorbing carbon dioxide rather than methane and nitrogen gases.119 In addition, its performance as a basic catalyst in the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate in DMF at 40 °C was tested.119 The yield of ethyl(E)-α-cyanocinnamate as the main targeted product of the condensation reached 80% over a reaction time of 3 h with a selectivity close to 100%. Attempts to synthesize the pristine and functionalized derivatives of the MIL-101(Al) analogue are reported in Table 4.
In the same manner, Hartmann and Fischer synthesized the amino-functionalized MIL-101(Al) to use as a basic catalyst for the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malononitrile and with ethyl cyanoacetate to produce benzylidene malononitrile and ethyl α-cyanocinnamate, respectively. A selectivity of 99% and a yield of over 90% were achieved in a timeframe of 3 h. However, they were capable of preparing the NH2-MIL-101(Al) framework following a much simpler strategy at a lower reaction temperature and much smaller time (almost one-third).105
In a typical process, a 2:1 molar ratio solution was prepared in a 100 mL round bottom flask, in which the NH2-BDC linker was dissolved in DMF. The solution was then heated to 110 °C under stirring in an oil bath. Equal portions of the hexahydrated chloride salt of aluminum were added to the hot solution over a period of 2 h. The mixture was kept under reflux for a reaction duration of 19 h. The yellow solid powders formed after cooling down were collected and separated by filtration, then washed with DMF and ethanol. Thereafter, it was activated by Soxhlet extraction with ethanol over 24 h. A higher SSA of 3099 m2 g−1 (BET) and pore volume of 1.53 cm3 g−1 were obtained. In addition, the Al-based structure proved remarkable stability over the Fe-based one in moist air over an extended period, reaching 96 h, with no change in neither the porosity nor the crystallinity.94
Putting more effort into understanding the reasons behind this successful achievement of the NH2-MIL-101(Al) MOF, Goesten and Stavitski investigated the formation of this topology through small- and wide-angle scattering (SAXS/WAXS) studies.127,128 Their studies confirmed that the reaction kinetics is highly dependent on the type of solvent involved, whereby the reaction could be shifted towards the production of NH2-MIL-101(Al) with the use of DMF as the reaction solvent solely. The presence of H2O in small amounts would result in a different assembly and another form of Al-MOFs.127 Higher concentrations of aluminum precursor, with its high moisture content, can provide sufficient water molecules that hinder the formation of the MIL-101 topology.127,128 The same group continued their studies through in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT). They established that the synthesis of the MIL-101(Al) framework requires not only using metal chloride precursor and DMF as the solvent but also NH2-BDC as the linker.129
In their study, electronic structure DFT calculations were performed on an appropriate charge-neutral structure motif containing three Al centers equivalent to the trinuclear metal clusters found in Al-MOFs. The calculations showed that the development of the trimeric μ3-oxo cluster is a kinetically favored step and that the MIL-101 is not the thermodynamically stable phase regardless of the linker type (Fig. 11). However, computations based on replacing the aqua ligands at the unsaturated sites of the metal trimer with DMF, in the case of MIL-101(Al) (Fig. 11, left), revealed a significant decrease in the energy gap to +8 kJ mol−1. Despite this small energy difference, the successful synthesis of the pristine unfunctionalized Al analogue physically is not reported yet. Moreover, a lower energy barrier of −6 kJ mol−1 was determined in the case of the amino-functionalized linker, NH2-MIL-101(Al) (Fig. 11, right). Such a decrease in the activation energy explains the possible achievement of MIL-101's node experimentally when DMF was employed as the reaction solvent instead of water.119,127–129 This agreement between the computational calculations and the experimental data elaborates the pivotal role of DMF as a promoter and stabilizer in combination with NH2-BDC linker for the μ3-O-centered cluster existence in the medium. Accordingly, in all compared species, it is shown that the energy barrier for the formation of the MOF lattice is systematically lower when the Al cluster is complexed with DMF rather than water (88 vs. 112 kcal “unfunctionalized,” and 86 vs. 124 kcal “amino-functionalized”).

Liquid-state NMR experiments were also used to look into the coordination chemistry around the metal ion and trace the large chemical complex structures of Al–DMF during the synthesis. The results revealed that the coordination between Al and DMF occurs initially. The dissociation of this complex starts upon heating the medium to 130 °C. At this temperature, the dissociated (free) aluminum ions bond with the less-favorable BDC linker molecules, and an HCl–DMF complex starts forming. Signals of NH2-MIL-101(Al) and the produced water molecules were detected after 30 min at 130 °C. In line with the DFT studies, the reaction of the chloride ion with water and DMF to produce the HCl–DMF complex was not developing due to the hydroxide ion (OH−) not being any more stabilized in the coordination sphere of Al3+. The binding of the produced hydroxido ligand to the third unsaturated site of the trimer is a key step to finalize the desired topology of MIL-101(Al). This report provided a reliable explanation for the topology dependence on the solvent and the reaction precursors. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was moreover suggested as an alternative solvent for this synthesis due to its ability to form complexes with HCl. What makes this interesting is the ability to investigate the chemistry of aluminum coordination as a p-block element apart from the transition d-block elements.130,131
Since the parent member of this isomorph (MIL-101(Al)) was reported not to be possible to obtain by the conventional methods, Chmielewski et al. reported the successful synthesis of the missing metastable MIL-101(Al) via an indirect technique, whereby the deamination of the amino-functionalized derivative took place through post-synthetic modification.125 First, NH2-MIL-101(Al) was synthesized as reported, then treated with tert-butyl nitrite (t-BuONO) at room temperature for 60 min, followed by heating in methanol. This process resulted in the full conversion of all amino groups. However, heating in methanol was found to contaminate the products extensively. Fortunately, conducting the same procedures at a temperature of −20 °C suppressed the formation of such contaminants. Therefore, the ideal conditions for small-scale experiments are treating the functionalized MOF at −20 °C, followed by adding methanol after 1 h at the same temperature for 18 h. Finally, the products were washed and heated with methanol at 60 °C for 4 h.
The complete deamination of the products was established by 1H NMR, ATR-FTIR, and nitrogen sorption.125 The non-functionalized MIL-101(Al) showed a single peak at 7.87 ppm in the 1H NMR also found in the spectrum of the H2BDC linker. Besides, the vibrational peaks of the amino group at 1621 cm−1 and 1339 cm−1 were disappeared in the ATR-IR spectrum. Moreover, the processed products revealed a slightly higher surface area of 2445 m2 g−1 compared to the 2303 m2 g−1 value of its functionalized form. For larger-scale processes, methanol was not found as much effective as at a small scale, whereas dichloromethane was proven to be an appropriate alternative. An almost 100% conversion was attained when starting with 50–100 mg MOF and following the same procedures but using dichloromethane instead of methanol.
Buragohain et al. synthesized the amino-functionalized structure along with seven other derivatives, namely (methyl-, nitro-, oxymethyl-, difluoro-, dimethyl-, dioxymethyl-, and naphthalene-) dicarboxylate-linked frameworks as depicted in Fig. 12.126 However, in their method, aluminum perchlorate was used instead of the chloride salt, while N,N-diethyl formamide (DEF) was the primary solvent. The solvothermal synthesis included the mixing and dissolution of the intended linker with an equimolar amount of aluminum perchlorate nonahydrate (Al(ClO4)3·9H2O) in DEF. The mixture was heated to 130 °C for 3 to 12 h depending on the used linker. However, this method failed to prepare the pristine fluoro-MIL-101(Al) and chloro-MIL-101(Al). Exploring other synthesis methods, they were able to reproduce four of these derivatives (–CH3, –OCH3, –C6H4, –(OCH3)2) by the microwave-assisted route. Using microwaves, these derivatives were prepared at a higher temperature of 170 °C, but with a shorter reaction time of 10 min. The measured BET surface area of the collected powders varied from 1328 to 2398 m2 g−1, showing the highest area for the methyl-functionalized and the least for the difluoro (Table 4).

Investigations on possible applications of the Al analogue have been increasing, whereby applying such material in catalysis, gas adsorption, and many others was found to be promising. Attempts at achieving the pristine type are still ongoing through the bimetallic incorporation.
4.3 MIL-101(V), vanadium isomorph
Back to transition metals and seeking new assorted properties, vanadium was also employed in the synthesis of the MIL-101 framework by Biswas et al.132 MIL-101(V) was predicted to be obtainable since the construction of other types of vanadium-MOF possessing the same trimeric oxo-centered [V3(μ3-O)(H2O)3]7+ building units has been reported.13,133,134 In this feature, Biswas et al. synthesized the vanadium isomorph by incorporating the chloride salt of vanadium, H2BDC, and DMF in a 2:1 molar ratio solution at 150 °C for 24 h (Table 5). First, a mixture of VCl3 and the linker was weighed in a nitrogen-filled glove box due to the sensitivity of the vanadium salt to ambient air. Thereafter, they were dissolved in DMF inside a 10 mL Pyrex tube, followed by heating to the specified temperature. After 24 h, a dark-green powder was collected. Likewise, the amino-functionalized analogue was prepared using the same procedures, except for replacing the BDC linker with NH2-BDC to obtain a bright-green powder. Both products showed a moderate crystallinity that required a second step of thermal activation. MIL-101(V) and NH2-MIL-101(V) were activated at 130 °C and 100 °C for 12 h, respectively. Activation took place under vacuum, and the activated products were kept in an inert atmosphere due to their sensitivity be air and moisture as they could be decomposed within a few hours in the ambient temperature.

It is worth mentioning that with the high crystallinity of the activated MIL-101(V), its XRD pattern showed additional peaks imputed to an impure phase. On the other hand, all the attempts to collect the patterns for the functionalized form failed due to its lower stability compared to the pristine one. The N2 sorption measurements revealed a specific surface area of 2118 m2 g−1 (BET) and 3032 m2 g−1 (Langmuir) for MIL-101(V), whereas the amino-functionalized framework recorded a lower surface area of 1623 m2 g−1 (BET). The lower SSA of the vanadium isomorph to that of chromium was ascribed to the occlusion of some species within the pores, as the usual activation process in a solvent was not applicable in this case. Besides, the presence of a secondary phase may reduce the overall surface area. The thermal studies showed moderate thermal stability of both frameworks up to 320 °C for MIL-101(V) and 240 °C for NH2-MIL-101(V) in a helium atmosphere, producing residuals of V2O5. The CO2 uptake for these products was also measured and found to be higher compared to other V-MOFs suggesting the gas storage to be a convenient application for such compounds.
In a recent comparative study, Xu et al. prepared similar MIL-101(V) and NH2-MIL-101(V) through a favorable solvothermal procedure, whereby purer-phase products were fabricated at a lower temperature.135 In this procedure, a 2:1 molar ratio solution of the vanadium chloride (VCl3) metal precursor along with the linkers (H2BDC or NH2-BDC) were completely dissolved in DMF (Table 5). The solution was then sonicated and heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave to a temperature of 120 °C (a lower temp. than the 150 °C previously reported) for an equivalent reaction time of 24 h. The products were subjected to spontaneous cooling, filtered, and washed by DMF and ethanol. Finally, the product was dried in a nitrogen flow for 12 h. A typical XRD pattern similar to that simulated for the original chromium structure was acquired with no signs of any interfering impure phases. The measured BET-specific surface areas of the products were 2623 m2 g−1 for the MIL-101(V) and 2340 m2 g−1 for the NH2-MIL-101(V), which is the highest for any reported vanadium metal–organic framework. Such enhancement in the synthesis method was reflected in a better CO2 uptake for both products than Biswas's approach.132,135
Despite being air- and water-sensitive, the vanadium analogue and its functionalized derivatives are still studied for many available applications like gas adsorption, catalysis, and guest-encapsulation for catalytic and electrochemical purposes (Table 5).132,135–137 Moreover, they are considered amongst the structures having the highest surface area of all vanadium MOFs so far.132,134
4.4 MIL-101(Ti), titanium isomorph
Other studies reported the titanium isomorphs of the MIL-101 MOF as potential adsorbents for gas storage and separation applications (Table 6). Long et al. were the first to report and discuss the synthesis and processing of the MIL-101(Ti), whereby the synthesis was performed in an anaerobic and moisture-free atmosphere to avoid the instability of the framework in ambient conditions.139,140 An equimolar solution was prepared in an N2-filled glovebox, in which the anhydrous chloride salt of titanium(III) (TiCl3) and the H2BDC linker were placed in a Schlenk flask connected to a vacuum line system. Then, a 10:1 anhydrous DMF/ethanol volumetric solution was transferred into the flask by the cannula-transfer technique. The obtained solution was held at 120 °C, under stirring and inert conditions, for 18 h to yield a dark-purple powder of the titanium MOF analogue. The resulted powders were washed with anhydrous DMF and dried under vacuum. Different activation methods were tried, but the highest SSA was attained by solvent exchange with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) followed by drying under vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h.

Activation at these specified conditions could induce some coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUS), otherwise denoted as open metal sites (OMS), to the titanium(III)-oxo cluster, causing distortion at these sites (Fig. 13b). This activated analogue was of a BET-specific surface area of 2970 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir = 4440 m2 g−1) and a pore volume of 1.50 cm3 g−1. Adsorption capabilities of the unfunctionalized MIL-101(Ti) were measured against different gases such as N2, H2, CO, and CO2. However, it revealed no remarkable adsorption to any of them as designed, and only weak physisorption was observed.

In another attempt based on the very high affinity of the Ti3+ sites to coordinate with oxygen, adsorption against oxygen was measured. It showed irreversible chemical adsorption of the O2 molecules to the metal sites. Those oxygen molecules were tightly bonded to the framework causing a slight reduction in the measured SSA. All attempts to release these molecules, and regenerate the original framework, were in vain. Thorough investigations via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), IR, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopies, and magnetic susceptibility confirmed the charge-transfer reactions between the species. Such reactions caused overall framework oxidation and Ti4+ superoxide and peroxide formation within the structure (Fig. 13c and d). Closer examinations showed that the Ti(IV)-peroxide species prevail over time on account of the superoxide, while the primary Ti(III)-oxo species remain after the exposure to oxygen.
In another study, Antonio et al. obtained the MIL-101 structure electrochemically.141 More challenging, they were able to utilize this route to synthesize the intended MOF from dissolved metal ions instead of a metallic anode. MIL-101(Ti) was synthesized from the commercially available titanium tetrachloride liquid precursor (TiCl4) rather than the expensive and air-sensitive titanium trichloride salt (TiCl3). In such an electrosynthetic strategy, TiCl4 and H2BDC were dissolved in anhydrous DMF/ethanol 10:1-solution, and 0.1 M TBAPF6 as a supporting electrolyte into the cathodic compartment. The Ti4+ ions were completely reduced to the trivalent cation over a nickel foam working electrode at an applied potential of E = −1.2 V for 4 h versus Ag/AgNO3. These conditions generated a bright blue/purple Ti3+ containing electrolyte, which was heated at a typical temperature of 120 °C under N2 atmosphere for 18 h to provide the targeted MIL-101(Ti) framework. The measured BET surface area for this electrochemically-synthesized titanium analogue was found to be 3285 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir = 4360 m2 g−1), which was almost identical to that previously reported.139
Taking a step further, and thanks to this method, they were able to prepare the isoreticular MIL-101(Ti) metal–organic framework (MIL-101(Ti)-BPDC), whereby the BDC linker was replaced by the ditopic linker 4,4′-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC). The same procedures were followed except that a 2:1 molar ratio solution was used, resulting in bigger STs and a larger overall structure (Fig. 14). In comparison, the MIL-101(Ti)-BPDC was also prepared solvothermally.
 Fig. 14  Electrochemically- and solvothermally-synthesized isomorphic MIL-101(Ti) and isoreticular MIL-101(Ti)-BPDC. Red numbers indicate the size of the large cages in the corresponding structure, and the green ones represent the smaller cages.102,141,142 Adapted with permission from ref. 102, 141 and 142. 
The solvothermally-prepared isoreticular framework exhibited a BET surface area of 2139 m2 g−1 and pore size of 1.32 cm3 g−1. On the other side, the electrochemically synthesized one was of a higher surface area of 3263 m2 g−1 and pore size of 2.20 cm3 g−1. The MIL-101(Ti)-BPDC also showed an irreversible binding behavior similar to that of MIL-101(Ti), whereby oxidation of the Ti(III) sites into Ti(IV) superoxides and peroxides was observed.139
Finding other reports that include the synthesis, or the application of the MIL-101(Ti) framework, was elusive. So, to the best of our knowledge, these are the only reports of the titanium isomorph.
4.5 MIL-101(Sc), scandium isomorph
Scandium, as the lightest rare-earth/transition metal with a very stable (+3) oxidation state, was also examined to develop the μ3-oxo-centered trimer as the main building block of the MIL-101 framework. This trinuclear SBU was already detected in some scandium 2D MOFs.143,144 The 3D MIL-101(Sc) isomorph was firstly reported by Mowat et al., presenting the different scandium 3D MOFs with the ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers.145 Throughout a series of experiments, the MIL-101(Sc) analogue resulted from the reaction of the hydrated scandium nitrate salt (Sc(NO3)3·3H2O) with the H2BDC linker in a solvothermal reaction. The precursors were dissolved in DMF then heated at 100 °C for 24–48 h. At these conditions, the MIL-101 phase was obtained; however, it was highly contaminated with another type of Sc-MOFs. Thermal applications showed that the structure, along with the included contamination, breaks down between 400–500 °C. Nevertheless, and despite being a major phase, MIL-101(Sc) did not show an equivalent large pore size as observed for other metal isomorphs. A pore size of 0.16 cm3 g−1 was measured, indicating unfree pores resulted from the interfering phase.
Meanwhile, MIL-101(Sc) was reported to be fully synthesized mediating solvothermal conditions.146 In this study, hydrated scandium nitrate was mixed with H2BDC and dissolved in anhydrous DMF at ambient temperature. The use of anhydrous DMF was reported to be crucial since the presence of small amounts of water has resulted in other Sc-MOF structures. After complete dissolution of the components, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 90 °C for 24 h to yield a white powder of MIL-101(Sc). The resulting powders were then filtered, washed with DMF, activated in ethanol at 100 °C for 16 h. The recorded BET surface area of the activated MIL-101(Sc) was about 3490 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir = 4970 m2 g−1) with pore sizes of 1.55 and 2.21 nm. TGA analysis showed some agreement with the previous study, whereby the structure collapses within the temperature range of 340–540 °C, leaving a residual of Sc2O3 behind. Unfortunately, no other attempts using the same preparation procedures were reported to produce the MIL-101(Sc) framework.
Nevertheless, in another approach of Mitchell et al., MIL-101(Sc) was synthesized from an aqueous chloride salt (ScCl3) solution.147 On the other side, terephthalic acid was dissolved in a DMF/ethanol mixture. Solutions were mixed, transferred to Teflon-lined autoclave, and heated to 80 °C for 24 h. The resulted white powder of the scandium isomorph was then collected, washed with DMF, and finally dried. Exposure to moist air or drying at a high temperature reaching 100–120 °C may cause a remarkable loss in crystallinity. Consequently, evacuation of the pores took place at ambient or slightly elevated temperature of 60 °C under vacuum. The nitrogen adsorption measurements showed that the highest surface area was around 640 m2 g−1 (BET) and a pore volume of 0.33 cm3 g−1, which is remarkably low compared to the expected values of any MIL-101 framework.
In a recent study, the same procedures were followed, but no data about the properties of the achieved MIL-101 structure were mentioned.148 The catalytic performance of MIL-101(Sc) among other various MOFs of different divalent and trivalent metal centers was measured in multiple reactions as Lewis-acid active catalysts.147,148 Scandium-containing MOFs showed a noticeable activity; however, the MIL-101 framework did not exhibit the best effectiveness owing to its instability at the reaction conditions and the low surface area in comparison with the chromium analogue. Besides, it was evidenced that such activity was not induced by the surface metal sites, and the reactants may be adsorbed inside the pores to react with the available open metal sites. The low catalytic activity of the MIL-101(Sc) framework in that study was expected as a result of its low thermal stability as well as its use in its as-synthesized form, whereby the structure was not fully activated, and the pores were still occupied with the solvent molecules, yielding low surface area.
4.6 General features
Based on what was stated above regarding the different analogues of the MIL-101 framework, they all seem to show some common features resulting from their common crystallographic structure. However, being built from different trivalent metal ions induces some inner differences among these isomorphs. Some of these features are discussed below.

4.6.1 Crystallinity and lattice parameters. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is the main characterization technique to confirm the formation of the targeted MOF structure and identify its phase purity. Their high crystallinity results in high-intensity peaks. The calculated pattern derived from the original simulation of the chromium-type MIL-101 framework showed a high density of miller indices at higher 2θ angles and a lower density at lower ones. On the contrary, and in agreement with the powder pattern collected experimentally, the pattern revealed high-intensity peaks at small angles of 2θ range = 0–20°, and almost no other noticeable peaks at higher angles (Fig. 15).

MIL-101 isomorphs comprise different trivalent metal ions, replacing Cr in the same crystal structure yielding similar patterns consistent with the simulated one, as confirmed experimentally.16,97,99,132,139,146 Different bond lengths would however owing to the various metal ions having different covalent radii.149 Different lattice parameters, inducing slight shifts and intensity variations in the XRD patterns are observed (Table 7). Linker functionalization would also result in comparable XRD patterns.96,105,119,135 Nevertheless, functionalization will have substantial effects on other properties like the pore size, chemical, and thermal stability, as will be discussed below. Mixed-metal and mixed-linker MIL-101 will also follow the same trend.

4.6.2 Nitrogen adsorption and textural properties. 
As discussed above, MIL-101(Cr) gives a characteristic type-I isotherm with two secondary uptakes between P/P0 = 0.1 and 0.2, representing micropore filling (Fig. 16).16 Despite having a high surface area, MIL-101(Cr) is usually found to have lower measured values than first reported by Férey in the original publication.31 As illustrated in the previous sections, various synthesis parameters, along with the synthesis activation technique used, can cause a noticeable decrease in the measured surface area and pore volume due to the inclusion of some side products, linker or solvent residuals in the pores. Commonly, a specific surface area in the range of SBET = 2300–3500 cm3 g−1 is found to be acceptable, based on the previous studies (Table 2).31 Other MIL-101 analogues and their functionalized derivatives also give the typical MIL-101 isotherm and an equivalent surface area (Tables 3–6). Structures built from functionalized linkers show a much lower surface area than pristine because of the volume occupied by the functionalizing group.153
 Fig. 16  Representative N2 adsorption isotherm reported for MIL-101(Cr), with the secondary uptake corresponding to pore filling.16,63 
Generally, in resembling materials of similar isotherm, the Langmuir model, corresponding to monolayer adsorption, is used to interpret the data for relative pressure points P/P0 < 0.4 (usually in the range of 0.05 to 0.35).154–156 Particularly, in the case of MIL-101, for P/P0 in the range 0.05 to 0.2, models agree well with experimental data.16 However, since the gas-adsorption in MOFs having large accessible cages takes place through weak interactions (physisorption), the multilayer adsorption is more reliable. Hence, the surface area based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model is mostly preferred.3


4.6.3 Structural stability. 
Another important feature to be discussed would be the stability of the MIL-101 structure. The term “stability” usually refers to the ability of a MOF to avoid irreversible chemical and physical changes upon exposure to various operating conditions.157 At the early stages of MOFs discovery, synthesizing frameworks with a very high surface area and pore volume was the main research interest. However, designing more stable structures that would withstand harsh operation conditions became the core of many recent studies. Generally, in MOFs, each type is assigned for some recommended applications based on its given properties. These properties emerge from its chemical composition and crystal structure. For a specific application, the stability of a MOF's structure is important for applications whereby the framework should remain unchanged, preserving its original properties during the whole course of the process.157 Hence, the stability of a MOF should include both its thermal and chemical stability.
Thermal stability. 
Thermal stability indicates the structural resistance to degradation at relatively high temperatures. However, the available techniques to evaluate this type of stability on MOFs are still limited, and TGA is the most used approach of assessment.158 For MIL-101, routine measurements are conducted at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 600 °C or 800 °C. A typical TGA plot (Fig. 17) would show three distinctive stages as follows:
 Fig. 17  A typical TGA plot for the MIL-101 framework, expressing different weight loss stages within each temperature range. (a = solvent evaporation, b = framework decomposition, c = metal-oxide formation).16,160 
- First, a small weight loss is observed at low temperatures (up to 150 °C), corresponding to the desolvation of the framework, whereby evaporation of the solvent molecules within the pores takes place along with the removal of the water molecules (immobilized liquid moieties) bound at the vertices of the metal trimers (Fig. 17a).16,159 The size and the temperature of this step rely on the type of solvents used during synthesis and activation.158 By the end of the first stage, a plateau region should be witnessed, in which the solvent-free evacuated framework remains standing with some open metal sites.158
- At higher temperatures, an extensive steep weight loss should be recognized equivalent to the departure of the remaining OH−/X− ions, detachment of the organic linker, followed by the decomposition of the whole framework (Fig. 17b).16,159 This sharp step represents the main degradation stage of the framework, whereby 45% or higher weight loss is detected at this point.16,63,77
- Finally, a second plateau comes after, indicating the constant weight of the residuals, which are mainly the left-behind metal oxide clusters (Fig. 17c). At this temperature, the metal oxide crystals reorganize to occupy their most stable form. Usually, about 20–30% of the original weight remains after the structure decomposition, corresponding to the persisting bulk mass of the metal oxide. In the case of measurements undergoing higher temperatures (up to 1000 °C), a tertiary weight-loss step may exist, marking the fusion and decomposition of the metal oxide.63
The original chromium-type MIL-101 was initially stated to show moderate thermal stability up to 275 °C in air.16,77,161 Nevertheless, the reported decomposition temperature may slightly vary from one study to another depending on the synthesis method, activation procedures, and preservation conditions. Also, experimentally, the type of gas used during analysis (air, nitrogen, or argon), the heating rate, and the purge gas flow rates may take part in these variations. Thus, later studies sometimes report higher decomposition temperatures between 300–350 °C.162–165
Critically identifying the decomposition temperature of a MOF based on TGA data solely will probably provide less accurate results. Besides, TGA focuses on the framework deterioration disregarding any changes in the crystallographic structure that might occur before degradation. Utilizing high-temperature XRD (HTXRD), close tracking of the crystal disintegration, and any probable phase transformation can provide more information about the different events during breakdown. HTXRD investigations on MIL-101(Cr) showed some minor alterations to the prominent diffraction peaks around 4° and 8.7° during the temperature rise to 200 °C, which was interpreted to the loss of water and solvent molecules. At higher temperatures, the structure crystallinity was still maintained until a sudden drop of all peaks between 350 °C and 375 °C, corresponding to the framework destruction. Hence, the actual decomposition temperature of MIL-101(Cr) might be higher than those reported previously in the TGA studies.63
Since MOF is built through coordination of a metal cluster and an organic linker, its thermal stability is related to factors affecting both components and their interaction. For the metal cluster, the type of the SBU formed as well as the oxidation state of the included metal ions, bond strength, and preferred coordination number would significantly determine its degree of interaction with the organic linker, affecting the framework thermal withstanding. On the other hand, the nature of the organic linker (aliphatic/aromatic) and the type of its donor heteroatoms are also contributing.
All the metal centers in pristine MIL-101 isomorphs hold the same bonding with the organic linker, secondary building unit, and the same oxidation state. Most of them are 3d-transition elements, sharing comparable chemical and physical properties. Nevertheless, they differ internally depending on the stability of their ions' oxidation state, covalent radius, and local coordination environment. Hence, all MIL-101 isomorphs follow the same degradation sequence at elevated temperatures, but their decomposition temperature would slightly differ depending on the metal type present. Technically, MIL-101(Cr) and its various analogues show framework degradation temperature within the range of 250 °C to 400 °C. Air- and water-sensitive analogues like MIL-101(V) follow the same trend, showing a decomposition temperature under inert gas between [320 °C (TGA) and 400 °C (TDXRPD)].132
Functionalized MIL-101s would start decomposing over a broader temperature range, depending on the functional group on the organic linker.65 Amino-functionalized frameworks were found to show lower decomposition temperatures than unfunctionalized ones, regardless of the metal type.65,132 In spite of their lack of certainty, these trends would allow the prediction of the decomposition temperatures for some functionalized and non-functionalized structures. For example, NH2-MIL-101(Al) was reported to show structural degradation around 375 °C (TGA) under air.119,151 Considering this trend, pristine MIL-101(Al) would be of higher thermal stability than its amino-functionalized form, thus higher than all other analogues. Related studies on similar MOFs confirmed this trend.166 Thermal studies on the deaminated NH2-MIL-101(Al) are still required to either confirm or reject such a hypothesis.125 Keeping in mind that a loss of crystallinity was recorded for NH2-MIL-101(Al) over 300 °C under air, using time-resolved XRD, this loss may result from a low chemical stability at high temperature.
Chemical and hydrothermal stability. 
Chemical stability is another important criterion to take into account when selecting a MOF for a particular application. In similar contexts, chemical stability implies the durability of a given MOF for a considerable period of time against the ambient atmosphere. This concept goes beyond the reactivity of the MOF with the surrounding moisture to include its structural changes when it comes in full contact with water. Real-life applications may also require stability against more aggressive environments. For example, MOFs in drug delivery shall have chemical stability in aqueous solutions of different pH. In other applications, like catalysis, both chemical and thermal stability are essential for the framework to survive the reaction with limited degradation.
Owing to their highly crystalline structures, PXRD is the primary characterization technique used to assess the chemical stability of MOFs. Comparing the resulting patterns before and after the exposure to the environment under study gives a basic idea of the degree of the framework deterioration. Nevertheless, quantification based on XRD results is not sufficient to judge the framework's stability. Partial degradation may happen, so that other techniques should be involved to get realistic conclusions. Gas sorption measurements would be an adequate and complementary method in this regard. Inert gas adsorption can reflect the decay in surface area of the inner pore walls and the overall loss in porosity. Also, water adsorption is another efficient way to study the chemical interactions between the water molecules and the MOF pores, and therefore its stability in water.
Among the 100000 entries registered under the MOF subset in the Cambridge structural database (CSD), only a few are considered of potential use in industrial applications as a result of their reasonable chemical stability. These “stable” MOFs hold their structural integrity under oxidative atmosphere. MIL-101 is usually mentioned among those chemically stable MOFs. However, the chromium-based structure is the one referred to in most cases. MIL-101(Cr) was originally reported to show considerable chemical and solvothermal stability over months.16 The structure was found to remain intact in air and many organic solvents under these prolonged periods. These initial stability investigations were not detailed enough so that more recent experimental and computational studies were conducted in order to define the stability limits of this framework.
Relying on XRD data and N2 adsorption measurements, the chemical stability of MIL-101(Cr) in the air was further confirmed.72 In some cases, slight diminishing of some XRD peaks intensity was recognized at long exposure times, reaching one year.56 MIL-101(Cr) was also found to show remarkable solvothermal stability when subjected to various organic solvents at boiling temperatures for 8 h.56,72,167 No change in the peak intensity or structural porosity was noticed in the case of exposure to boiling water over a week, indicating the high hydrothermal stability of the structure.72,167,168 Water stability of MIL-101(Cr) was verified by utilizing water adsorption.107,168 The framework was reported to be hydrophilic, expressing a heat of adsorption (45.13 kJ mol−1) close to the molar enthalpy of evaporation for water (40.69 kJ mol−1), suggesting that adsorption takes place at first as a monolayer around the metal centers. Other layers are then formed by coordination to the monolayer through hydrogen bonding, resulting in water clusters inside the pores.107
In another interesting study, Low et al. investigated the hydrothermal stability of MIL-101(Cr) experimentally in a high throughput experiment, in which the resistance of a MOF to hydrolysis by water was investigated at high temperatures.169 Samples were tested for a duration of 2 h in a 48-quartz cell high throughput unit, whereby steaming at different water partial pressures was introduced to each row, and each column was treated at a different temperature (Fig. 18). Results showed that MIL-101(Cr) has high hydrothermal stability reaching a limit of 50% steam at 325 °C.169 Steamed samples showed severe deterioration in their morphology and overall physical properties. An evident drop in the framework's surface area along with most of its XRD peaks decrease confirmed these results.
 Fig. 18  The high throughput test employed to evaluate the hydrothermal stability of MIL-101(Cr). Temp. range = 85–325 °C, steaming percentage = 0–50%. A color change from green to brown was observed for all samples at high temperatures (≥250 °C). (A1) 20% steam. (B1) 30% steam. (C1) 0% steam. (D1) 10% steam. (E1) 40% steam. (F1) 50% steam.

A recognizable color change could be noticed for all samples conditioned over the temperature range of 250 °C to 300 °C, in which the known sea-green color of MIL-101(Cr) turned brownish.169 The color gradient was sensible in the direction of temperature increase (right to left) across all steaming levels and not the direction of higher steaming levels for each temperature (Fig. 18). Hence, it seems that the framework itself was resistant to hydrolysis regardless of the amount of steam applied. However, approaching temperatures close to decomposition temperature catalyzed such a reaction on all levels, whereby partial decomposition of the structure or detachment of the linker facilitated the interaction and bondage of the metal center to the introduced water molecules.
Nevertheless, the limitation of these experimental investigations lies in two points. First, and most importantly, the XRD patterns presented for MIL-101(Cr) showed a sharp diffraction peak around 10.8°, together with other peaks of lower intensities around 18° and 25°. Some of these peaks were defined by the authors as associated to a linker impurity.169 However, close reviewing of this pattern would show a great similarity with that of MIL-88B (a framework isomer to MIL-101(Cr), see Section 5).14,17 MIL-88B crystals can also be witnessed in the SEM images, with their distinct hexagonal crystals different from the octagonal MIL-101 ones.100,169 Hence, the samples were rather a mixture of two phases (i.e., MIL-101 and MIL-88B) than a single pure MIL-101 phase. MIL-88B shares the same trimeric SBU as that in MIL-101. MIL-88, however, has a different crystal structure with a higher decomposition temperature and different chemical stability.14,17 The presence of the MIL-88 phase within the samples may have induced a different response in the applied tests.
Second, in the conducted experiments, all samples were loaded to the cells, activated overnight under a nitrogen flow, then heated to the specified temperature assigned to each column before the steam introduction.169 As a result, the samples heated to high temperatures (250–325 °C) were forced to go through partial decomposition first before reacting with steam, ignoring the synergistic effect of the two factors taking place simultaneously. The decomposition temperature of the samples was not measured or identified before the run. Consequently, the intensity decrease in the measured diffraction peaks for the steamed MIL-101 sample at 300 °C could have resulted from the thermal decomposition of the sample only aside from the influence of the steam.16
Finally, the color change observed does not necessarily mean the hydrolysis of the framework, especially as it also occurred in samples with 0% steaming (Fig. 18(C1)).169 This change may refer to the amorphization of the MIL-101 framework or, most probably, the phase transformation to the MIL-88 structure as the peaks belonging to this phase have become more pronounced. Also, a similar phenomenon was detected during the microwave-assisted synthesis of MIL-101(Cr) at high reaction times reaching 240 min and 360 min. The resulting powders turned from green to brown, revealing the presence of the MIL-88B crystals.170
In the same publication, computational calculations based on quantum mechanics and molecular modeling of the MIL-101(Cr) trimeric cluster compared to other SBUs were performed.169 The model followed a stepwise reaction, in which the water molecule approaches the metal cluster at the point of connection of the metal center and the ligand (Fig. 19a). The water molecule then causes the bond breakage between the metal center and the carboxylate linker, leaving the cluster with an open metal site (Fig. 19b). Hydrolysis takes place, and the oxygen atom of the water molecule bonds with the metal cluster and redirects its protons towards the oxygen atom of the carboxylate group (Fig. 19c). In the last stage, the carboxylate ligand changes from η2 to η1 coordination state, and hydrogen bonds become effective between the metal cluster, bonded water molecules, and the dissociated carboxylate ligand.

These calculations introduced the basic concepts in predicting the chemical stability of existing MOFs and for designing new chemically stable structures. Similar to thermal stability, the chemical stability of a given MOF would depend on the type of the metal ions, their valency, preferred oxidation state, and degree of coordination within an SBU.169 Likewise, the type of hetero atoms found in the linker and its affinity to form complexes with the metal ions also contribute to the overall chemical stability.169 In this context, the metal type, preferred oxidation state, and bond strength between the metal center and the ligand atoms are considered the most influential factors in this case.
All MIL-101 isomorphs share the same oxidation state, trimeric SBU, topology, and organic linker (H2BDC). They are all built from comparable transition metals, showing a trivalent oxidation state, whereas this may not be the most stable state for all these elements. According to Low's findings, the bond strength in the equivalent metal oxides can give a rough estimation concerning the chemical stability of the studied MOFs.169 Following this concept, the metal–oxygen bond strength in Cr2O3 is higher than that of Fe2O3 (447 kJ mol−1vs. 400.4 kJ mol−1, respectively).169 So, MIL-101(Cr) is to be more chemically stable than its iron analogue (i.e., MIL-101(Fe)), which agrees with the actual situation.105,106,151 Al2O3 has a much higher bond strength (513.9 kJ mol−1).169 This would allow expecting pristine MIL-101(Al) to show higher chemical stability than the chromium and iron analogues. However, this information is not yet available for the unfunctionalized MIL-101(Al). Even though MIL-101(Al) was synthesized through PSM, its chemical stability is not well studied so far.125 On the contrary, the amino-functionalized aluminum isomorph (NH2-MIL-101(Al)) has shown lower stability than MIL-101(Cr), but in this case, the functional group might be contributing to overall stability.105,106,151
V2O3 has a bond strength of 499.5 kJ mol−1, compared to Cr2O3, MIL-101(V) would be predicted to express higher chemically stability than MIL-101(Cr). MIL-101(V) was, however reported to be sensitive to moist air and water. Its structure would decompose within a few hours when exposed to humid air.132 Trivalent vanadium ion (V3+) is not the most stable oxidation state for most vanadium compounds.166 Based on the TGA studies concerning V-MOFs, different vanadium oxides with different oxidation states of the vanadium ion may appear in the original structure.11,171 V2O5 is the given residual in the case of the MIL-101(V) framework.132,135 The M–O bond strength in the stable oxide was suggested to provide closer results. Hence, V2O5 with a bond strength of 382.7 kJ mol−1 (lower than Cr2O3) can explain this instability.166
MIL-101(Ti) was also reported to be an air-sensitive MOF that is easily oxidized when exposed to ambient atmosphere.139 Nevertheless, the bond strength of all titanium oxides is higher than Cr2O3 (e.g., T2O3 = 535.75 kJ mol−1).169 Hence, the mere energy of the metal–oxygen bond is not uniquely correlated to the stability of all these analogues. The oxidation state of the metal ion in the cluster is also to be considered, since the (+3) oxidation state is not always the most stable state for several of these elements. Hence, the possible change in oxidation state is also playing an effective role in determining the chemical stability of a MOF. MIL-101(Sc) might be a counterexample for being unstable despite having a very stable (+3) oxidation state.147 Some studies regarding the effect of different metal ions on the chemical stability of a particular MOF structure also suggested considering the inertness and lability of the metal ion.166,172 The chemical stability of isotypic MOFs was proved to correlate well with an increase in inertness or a decrease in lability of the central metal ion.166
In another study, Leus et al. systematically investigated and compared the chemical and hydrothermal stability of a series of famous MOFs known to be stable, including MIL-101(Cr) and NH2-MIL-101(Al).106 The hydrothermal stability test was conducted through exposure to saturated steam at 200 °C for 5 h. The chemical stability against air, water, acidic (HCl, pH = 0 and 4), basic (NaOH, pH = 12), and oxidizing (5%wt H2O2) media was studied considering both short-term (3 days) and long-term exposure (60 days) at room temperature. Stability evaluation was made through XRD and surface area measurements. Once again, MIL-101(Cr) showed remarkable overall hydrothermal and chemical stability, except under oxidizing environment for longer exposure times. XRD results revealed no phase transformation, and the structure was kept intact, preserving its high crystallinity in most cases. In addition, surface area measurements showed no signs of internal decomposition of the framework. The measured surface area was almost similar to (if not exceeding) that of the as-synthesized sample. Moreover, MIL-101(Cr) samples tested in different acidic or basic media expressed a close to 30% increase in surface area. Under these conditions, the dissolution of the free linker becomes more accelerated, which would facilitate the evacuation of the MOF pores, resulting in a higher SSA. In the presence of peroxides (H2O2 test, oxidizing environment), the chemical endurance of the structure is still maintained in the short term. However, extended exposure to this hostile environment would force the MOF transformation to the thermodynamically stable phase, MIL-53 (a framework isomer to MIL-101(Cr), see Section 5).
In contrast, NH2-MIL-101(Al) did not show equivalent stability, and in most tests, transformation to the MIL-53 phase is to arise. Short-term exposure to water would drastically reduce the framework crystallinity indicating internal fragmentation of the structure, causing about 50% decrease in the measured surface area.106 Nevertheless, a complete phase transformation to the more stable MIL-53 structure was identified in contact with the ambient atmosphere and after the steaming test. Also, the amino-functionalized framework was found to show similar chemical change when subjected to acidic or basic media. In highly acidic media (pH = 0), complete dissolution of the structure was detected over both the short and long terms, with no signs of any phase transformation. Hence, the amino-functionalized aluminum analogue was reported to have very low chemical and hydrothermal stability.106

4.7 Case study: MIL-101(Mn), manganese isomorph
So far, five out of the ten elements in the first row of the d-block transition metals were used to prepare the MIL-101 framework viz., scandium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, and iron. Manganese, as the midst element among chromium and iron, is believed to be able to form the MIL-101 structure under appropriate conditions. Especially since Mn was reported in the synthesis of MIL-100 metal–organic framework, which is an equivalent MOF discovered after MIL-101. It is however built from the same metal trimer and the tritopic linked benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (H3BTC or trimesic acid) (Fig. 20), exhibiting the same MTN topology.173,174 Also, Mn was recently involved in the synthesis of the MIL-88B, which is a framework isomer built from trivalent metal ions and the H2BDC linker.175

Recently, Songolzadeh et al. reported the synthesis of the MIL-101(Mn) isomorph along with other analogues (i.e., MIL-101(V) and MIL-101(Cr)) for the adsorption and separation of quinoline.176 All MOFs were prepared solvothermally from their metal oxide (chromium trioxide “CrO3”, vanadium pentoxide “V2O5”, and manganese(III) oxide “Mn2O3”) at different precursors ratios of (0.33, 0.67, and 1.00) with respect to the BDC linker. A wide range of reaction temperatures (120 °C, 150 °C, and 180 °C) and times (10, 15, and 20 h) were selected to synthesize these isomorphs. In a typical synthesis, the metal oxide was mixed with an appropriate amount of linker according to the assigned ratios and then dissolved in DMF. Heating to the desired temperature for a certain time took then place in a Teflon-lined autoclave. Finally, the collected powders were filtered, washed with DMF, water, and acetone before drying at 160 °C under vacuum.
Some contradictions were however noticed in the results, leaving some doubts over the fact that MIL-101(Mn) was achieved. Firstly, according to the paper, all MOFs were obtained over the whole range of applied temperature, which somehow contradicts the above-mentioned results, implying that the MIL-101(Cr) was not obtainable at a low synthesis temperature of 120 °C and with DMF as a solvent.75 Using DMF as the only solvent (water-free medium), as was done in this work, is known to result in a different product but not in the MIL-101 structure.75 In addition, equivalent MOFs are usually prepared from equimolar solutions, and sometimes even with metal precursor being in excess, but in this work the optimal molar ratio was for an excess linker. No discussion about the stability or sensitivity of the obtained MOFs in the air (especially the vanadium and manganese analogues) was reported.132,135,173
Most importantly, the collected and displayed XRD pattern for the MIL-101(Mn) showed many diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 10–80 degrees with no referring to smaller angles. This is totally contrasting to the simulated pattern of the MIL-101(Cr), with most of the high-intensity peaks being at small angles and almost no peaks over this range, as shown in Fig. 15 and 21. Substituting the chromium atom with manganese (or any other metal) in the same given computational crystal model results in the same pattern but with different intensities. Hence, achieving this MOF structure with different metal types should give a comparable pattern but not as different as observed.

Furthermore, despite the high surface area (SBET = 4204 m2 g−1) and the large pore size (35 Å) reported for this Mn-analogue, the measured N2 isotherm was clearly identified by the authors as a type-II isotherm. Nevertheless, the presented isotherm was almost linear. On the contrary, the reported isotherms of the original MIL-101(Cr) or any of its isomorphs (pristine and functionalized) were consistently found to exhibit a type-I isotherm with two secondary uptakes at the relative pressure of 0.05 and 0.2 (Fig. 16 and 22). Hence, it is likely that the compound achieved in this work is not of MIL-101 structure.

Accordingly, since the mentioned work is the only publication reporting the synthesis of the manganese analogue MIL-101 framework, it is believed that MIL-101(Mn) is not yet a demonstrated materials and that further work is still needed to establish a synthesis procedure of this new MOF.
5. Polymorphism of MIL-101
As a matter of fact, the MIL-101 framework is not the only MOF that is built from the trinuclear metal cluster and ditopic organic linker. In addition to isomorphism, polymorphism, or framework isomerism, is another commonly-known phenomenon in the field of MOFs.138 Polymorphism is defined as “the ability of a compound to crystallize in more than one distinct crystal structure”, whereas it denotes diverse arrangements of rigid molecules in the solid-state.177,178 Many MOFs of different structures come out from the reaction of the same initial precursors based on the reaction conditions. The interaction of such precursors leads to different SBUs with various connections to produce MOFs of multiple morphologies. This structure variation reflects many different physical and chemical properties.
The trigonal prismatic metal cluster of the MIL-101 framework along with the H2BDC linker was reported to face polymorphism, whereby different assemblies were observed, resulting in different MOF topologies. Just before MIL-101 was reported, another 3D MOF, built from the same trinuclear oxo-centered chromium cluster and the dicarboxylate linker, was obtained, namely, MIL-88 (Fig. 23A).12 In this feature, MIL-88B was used to denote the structure built from the terephthalate linker since the structure of the MIL-88 was reported to be obtainable from many dicarboxylates such as fumaric acid (MIL-88A), 1,4-BDC (MIL-88B), 2,6-NDC (MIL-88C), and 4,4′-BPDC (MIL-88D).14,17 The XRD studies illustrated a structural formula of [MIII3O·(BDC)3·F/OH·(8H2O)·solvent], and a distinct diffraction pattern different from that of the MIL-101 (Fig. 24a and b).17 Compared to the MTN topology of the MIL-101 framework, MIL-88 was reported to occupy the less transitive topology of the acs net with the P2c space group (Fig. 23A and B), making it the default structure and the thermodynamic isomer for many trivalent metal ions like Sc,143–145 V,138 Mn,175 Cr, and Fe.14,17,179 Besides, the MIL-88 framework was found to exhibit channels rather than the cages of the MIL-101 structure (Fig. 23A and B). However, other investigations proved that the structure of the MIL-88 MOF is flexible, in which the size of its channels changes depending on the surrounding medium (solvent), represented as the framework “breathing” (Fig. 23A).100,179,180 This renowned difference between the framework rigidity of the MIL-101 structure and the flexibility within the MIL-88 structure has played a vital role in redirecting studies for different applications.

(Calculated patterns reproduced via Mercury/CSD simulated files: “OCUNAC”, “YEDKOI”, “DANWOF”, “MINVOU01/IDIWIB”, “MINVUA01/IDIWOH”, respectively). 
MOF-235 is another framework isomer to MIL-101 that is frequently reported as a formed intermediate during the synthesis of other structures using the same precursors.127,129,181 Further, MOF-235 was found to result from the assembly of the trivalent metal trimer and the H2BDC linker, giving the formula of [[M3O·(1,4-BDC)3·(DMF)3]·[FeCl4]·(DMF)3].182 Therefore, by comparing the structures of MOF-235 and MIL-88, and aside from the type of solvent included, it could be stated that both structures are identical, underlying the exact P2c topology. Nevertheless, the MOF-235 structure has an overall cationic character balanced by the tetrahalide metal [MIIIX4]− counterion, located in its hexagonal pores (Fig. 23C).182 Moreover, MOF-235, with its metal halide inclusion, is usually obtained through quenching and mostly in the cases whereby a metal trichloride is used initially in the synthesis.181 The XRD pattern for MOF-235 is shown in Fig. 24c.182
On the other hand, MIL-53 is another member of this three-dimensional MOF family that is routinely produced during the synthesis of MIL-101, MIL-88, and MOF-235. It is formed by the reaction of the BDC linker with the metal(III) octahedron but not in the shape of the trinuclear μ3O-trimer. However, in this structure, the metal octahedra are connected to form infinite metal chain clusters through a corner-sharing assembly (Fig. 23D).12 Despite not being a framework isomer to MIL-101, it is essential to include such a structure since it is closely related to these isomers.127,138 The activated MIL-53(ht) has the chemical formula of MIII(OH)·(BDC), whereby the OH represents the ligand by which the metal octahedra are linked to form the trans-chain cluster.12 Like the MIL-88 isomer, the MIL-53 framework was found to have channel-shaped pores that exhibit the same flexibility and breathing behavior for different adsorbates (Fig. 23D).183,184 This framework flexibility would cause some variations in the resulting diffraction pattern depending on the solvent; however, the XRD patterns for MIL-53(as) and MIL-53(ht) are shown in Fig. 24d and e.
MIL-47 is a framework isomer for MIL-53, in which they share the same linker, structure, and topology. However, MIL-47 is made out of tetravalent metal ions (particularly vanadium) rather than the trivalent of the MIL-53 (Fig. 23d).11 They were both reported to occupy the sra topology with the space group of Pnam. In contrast, MIL-47 was found to express a relatively rigid structure compared to MIL-53, keeping the same space group at different stages.11,134 Nevertheless, MIL-53 was proved to show some structural changes between its as-synthesized state (space group Imcm) and its dried one (that is identical to MIL-47 “Pnam”). MIL-53 was synthesized using different transition metals of stable +3 oxidation state (Sc, Cr, and Fe)12,145,187 besides others of the p-block (Al, Ga, and In).184,188,189 On the other hand, MIL-47 was basically built from V, and recent investigations were made to incorporate Mn.11,13,190 The diffraction patterns of the as-synthesized MIL-47(VIII) and the calcinated MIL-47(VIV) are shown in Fig. 24d and e. Other polymorphs may include MIL-68 and CAU-1 (CAU = Christian-Albrechts University).118,148,191
This close relation between these frameworks (MIL-101, MIL-88, MOF-235, MIL-53, and MIL-47) was investigated and illustrated in different studies.138,192–194 Generally, they were prepared from the same precursors, but the growth of a specific structure was dependent on the accompanying reaction conditions, kinetics, and thermodynamics. As mentioned earlier, Stavitski and Goesten were able to track these different structural transformations for Al-based MOFs using various characterization and computational techniques (Fig. 11).127–129 NH2-MIL-53(Al) was found to be the default thermodynamic phase at high temperatures. On the other hand, NH2-MOF-235(Al), as a transient phase, would be formed instantaneously at low temperatures in the presence of DMF within the medium (Fig. 25). However, at anhydrous conditions (DMF only), the NH2-MOF-235(Al) intermediate transforms into NH2-MIL-101(Al) at higher temperatures.129 Increasing the temperature would force the dissociation and further transformation into the MIL-53 structure.127

In this account, Carson et al. studied similar issues on vanadium.138 Experimental investigations suggested that such transformations are imputed to the reaction time, temperature, solvent, and pH, as the thermodynamic state directed by these conditions affects the growing structure. The thermodynamic studies revealed that MIL-101(V) is the kinetically favored product obtained by the reaction of VCl3 with the BDC linker in ethanol at 120 °C for 48 h (Table 5 and Fig. 26). MIL-88(V), as the thermodynamic isomer, was produced under the same reaction procedures and conditions but in the presence of HCl. At higher temperatures, the MOFs may be dissociated into their building blocks regardless of the presence of HCl. Furthermore, the vanadium sites may be oxidized, and finally, re-assemble into the thermodynamic phase of MIL-47. Moreover, changing the solvent to water may not influence the MOF structure except for the MIL-47 framework.

Bauer et al. came out with comparable results in their study concerning the NH2-MIL-101(Fe) analogue, whereby the initial precursors' molar ratio and scaling up were found to have a great impact on the product.96 Besides, reactions underwent solvothermally in different solvents and several pHs, which led to remarkable results. Using acetonitrile as the main solvent, NH2-MIL-88(Fe) was the only obtainable MOF at a high pH or elevated temperature. Otherwise, a totally amorphous product was produced. Methanol would also direct the reaction into the MIL-88 phase at lower temperatures regardless of the pH. However, at a higher temperature, either an amorphous or unidentified phase of Fe-BDC was detected. Synthesis in DMF enables the growth of the MIL-101 as the favorable major phase, especially at a low temperature of 110 °C and a precursors' molar ratio of 2:1 metal ion to linker. However, raising the pH may promote the growth of the MIL-88 phase. Finally, water shifts the reaction to the thermodynamically favored MIL-53 phase, and at some points, the three phases co-existed.
In a similar study, Horcajada et al. investigated the phase-selectivity of the amino-functionalized derivative of the iron isomorph but in a microwave-assisted synthesis.101 In agreement with Bauer's findings, synthesis in water promoted the growth of thermodynamic MIL-53 phase, whereas synthesis in alcohol (ethanol) fostered the MIL-88 phase. However, NH2-MIL-101(Fe) could be obtained in both solvents with a very limited adjustment. Furthermore, the syntheses using DMF as the main solvent were the prevalent ones, which were more likely to produce the MIL-101 phase. The experiments involved HCl as a mineralizer failed to result in this kinetic phase, except with water, but in those cases, it was always a mixture of MIL-101 and MIL-53 phases.96,101
6. Heterogeneity and multivariate (MTV) MIL-101
Based on the different building units of the MOFs, the attempts of involving more than one linker or SBU in the same structure have gain concern in a quest for complexity and heterogeneity. Complexity refers to the formation of new complex structures due to the implication of more than one network topology in one formulation, producing a totally distinct network. In contrast, heterogeneity implies the growth of the same structural type of the parent MOF (i.e., topology) but with comparable building units, preserving identical backbone.3 Heterogeneous MOFs, also called multivariate (MTV) MOFs, are obtained by either the multi-metal or the multi-linker approach. In the multi-metal approach, various metal ions that form the same SBU are employed with the same linker. On the contrary, the multi-linker approach involves the introduction of a single-metal-type SBU to linkers of the same structure but with different functional groups. Hence, MTV-MOFs are isostructural and metrically identical MOFs of distinct chemical compositions. Herein, likewise the previous context, we will review the mixed-metal MTV-MIL-101, the mixed-linker, and the interfering with Bhattacharjee's functionalization.31,54,97
Mixed-metal MIL-101 can be obtained either through direct synthesis or post-synthetic modifications (PSM). PSM is the most widely used method for functionalization of a pre-synthesized MOF, as it provides a facile route and powerful tool for MOF manipulation without risking any interference with the formulation of the targeted MOF. Moreover, it allows direct access to structures that are not achievable by the direct route. The PSM, which permits the addition and exchange of one of the main framework constituents, is classified as PSM of strong interactions. Therefore, it is considered as the second-chance or the backdoor of modifying the inherent structural properties. Furthermore, it was proven to be an efficient alternative for introducing heterogeneity into MOFs and the achievement of MTVs that are elusive to obtain by one-pot synthesis. Therefore, it is considered an economically and ecologically recommended procedure for large-scale synthesis with minimum waste.
6.1 MTV-MIL-101s through PSM
As a proof of concept, Szilágyi et al. obtained MIL-101(Cr/Fe), (Cr/Al), and (Cr/Fe/Al) via post-synthetic solvent-assisted cation substitution (SACS) method.195 First, MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized according to Férey's original recipe. Then 100 mg of MIL-101(Cr) was cation-exchanged through refluxing with 5 mg of AlCl3 or 10 mg of FeCl3 solution in 100 mL of deionized water at 100 °C for 72 h. Metal-ion substitution was confirmed through Mössbauer spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy utilizing the Kubelka–Munk function for all Fe-containing samples (Fig. 27). Besides, the amount of the metal replaced was observed by ICP-OES, whereby it was almost around 5% or less in MIL-101(Cr/Fe) and MIL-101(Cr/Fe/Al) for iron and reached 10% or more in MIL-101(Cr/Al) and MIL-101(Cr/Fe/Al) for aluminum.

XRD was employed to study the structural integrity. All samples showed the same pattern of pristine MIL-101(Cr). Furthermore, BET surface area measurements revealed a drop in the surface area from 2230 m2 g−1 of MIL-101(Cr) to 1830 m2 g−1 and 1838 m2 g−1 for (Cr/Fe) and (Cr/Fe/Al), respectively. However, MIL-101(Cr/Al) showed a slight increase in SSA to 2644 m2 g−1. Application of these different mixed-metal MIL-101 samples in the adsorption of H2 was carried out at cryogenics and ambient temperature. Nevertheless, they all did not show a noticeable enhancement compared to the original MIL-101(Cr). However, due to the changes taking place in the electronic environment, such compounds are highly suggested for catalytic application as active Lewis acids.
6.2 MTV-MIL-101s by direct synthesis
In addition to Szilágyi's study that validated the cation-exchange in MIL-101(Cr) via PSM, other reports followed their footprints to support the metal-sites substitution.196 However, others believed that post-synthetic ligand and metal-ion exchange (PSE) processes in MIL-101(Cr) are not achievable due to the kinetic inertness of the Cr(III) ion, and it can be only prepared through direct synthesis techniques.197,198

6.2.1 MIL-101(Cr/Fe). 
Vu et al. synthesized MIL-101(Cr) via the conventional hydrothermal method, with 25% of the Cr atoms superseded by Fe.198 MIL-101(Cr/Fe) was prepared by the addition of 16 g of chromium and iron salts (3:1 wt%) and 6.56 g (3.95 mmol) H2BDC to a 200 mL aqueous HF solution. The mixture was then stirred for 3 h and heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 220 °C for 9 h. The product was then collected, washed with hot ethanol, and finally dried. It is worth mentioning that using higher percentages of incorporating iron into the MIL-101(Cr) framework failed to obtain the targeted structure. The XRD pattern for MIL-101(Cr/Fe) was found to be identical to the simulated pattern of MIL-101(Cr) with no other peaks of the metal oxides, MIL-88, or MIL-53. In addition, the produced MIL-101(Cr/Fe) particles were uniform and of an average size of 1 μm. Besides, Fe was detected to be homogeneously distributed over the whole sample.
The measured BET surface area for MIL-101(Cr/Fe) was around 2997 m2 g−1, which was lower than that of MIL-101(Cr) prepared by the same procedures. Furthermore, the total pore volume and the pore size of the iron-substituted framework were 0.9958 cm3 g−1 and 2.01 nm, while that for pristine Cr were 1.7526 cm3 g−1 and 1.99 nm, respectively. Thus, by incorporating Fe into the structure, MIL-101(Cr/Fe) was clearly efficient as a heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst for the degradation of reactive organic dyes. A photo-induced reaction by the surface iron atoms in the presence of H2O2 was able to decompose the dye within 90 min with high reusability and limited iron leaching.
Later on, Bureekaew et al. studied the influence of Fe(III) ions as a metal-cationic competitor for MIL-101(Cr) formation in a hydrothermal synthesis.199 However, in their study, synthesis was carried out in an HF-free environment, in which samples of MIL-101(Cr/Fe) with different iron to chromium percentages were formulated. Samples were prepared as follows: first, MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized using the typical preparation steps, whereby equal amounts (5 mmol) of H2BDC and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were mixed in 24 mL of deionized water and placed into a Teflon-lined autoclave. Thereafter, it was heated in an oven at 220 °C for 8 h. Finally, the products were washed with DMF, and activated by ethanol at 80 °C for 24 h. Seeking different percentages of MIL-101(Cr/Fe), a portion of the 5 mmol chromium salt was replaced by an equivalent amount of ferric nitrate nonahydrate. Five percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, and 33.3 mol% Fe) were assigned along with 100% Fe in a quest for comparison of the final products.
The XRD patterns of the samples with Fe ≤ 15% were comparable with that of MIL-101(Cr), while that of 25% exhibited a mixed pattern of MIL-101 and MIL-88. However, a higher percentage of Fe = 33.3% was totally corresponding to the MIL-88. Moreover, the pattern of the 100% sample was not matching with any of these samples or other known phases. This finding may be attributed to the synthesis of most Fe-MOFs in DMF. Accordingly, the mixed-metal medium was the reason behind these formations and polymorphs. Nevertheless, SEM analyses revealed the presence of a small amount of the MIL-88 phase within the sample of Fe = 15%, which was not detected by the XRD. This phase is distinguished by its long hexagonal rods (red arrows in Fig. 28d) rather than the octahedral-shaped particles of MIL-101. Besides, in the three samples showing pure MIL-101 phase (0%, 5%, and 10% Fe), relatively larger particles from 100 nm (0% Fe sample) to 600 nm (10% Fe sample) were observed.

Unexpectedly, this 15% Fe sample, with the small MIL-88 contamination, showed the highest BET surface area of 2864 m2 g−1 compared to other samples and the pristine MIL-101(Cr). In contrast, a drastic reduction in the surface area in the range of hundreds was measured for other samples due to the domination of the MIL-88 phase. This reduction may also be imputed to the framework flexibility and the presence of small amounts of Fe2O3. Interestingly, elemental analysis for the samples with the identified MIL-101 phase (5%, 10%, and 15% Fe) showed higher actual percentages of iron incorporation within the structure than the initially targeted. The actual percentages were found to be around 17.5, 24.0, and 31.5, respectively. Obviously, the presence of ferric ions within the reaction medium induces not only the formation of different structural morphologies but also influences the formation of iron-MOFs. Surprisingly, under such conditions, the formation of the MIL-101 is more favored from the iron species rather than the chromium.
Digging deeper, Bureekaew's group continued their investigations on the mixed-metal synthesis of MIL-101 at higher percentages of incorporated Fe. However, they employed the microwave route instead of the conventional procedure.170 Since MIL-101 was found to be the kinetically favored phase, microwave heating was chosen for its ability to heat the system rapidly and homogeneously at the molecular scale. By overcoming the heat transfer issue of the hydrothermal route, the phase transformation into the MIL-101 can be controlled. Therefore, MIL-101(Cr/Fe) of a constant Fe molar percentage (33.3% mol) was prepared at different reaction times of 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. In typical procedures, 1 mmol of H2BDC was mixed with 1 mmol of the combined metal precursors (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O “66.7% mol Cr” + Fe(NO3)3·9H2O “33.3% mol Fe”) and dissolved in deionized water into a microwave vial. The reaction mixture was then heated to 200 °C at a constant power of 300 W for the assigned time intervals. After the reaction, the products were centrifuged, washed with DMF and ethanol, and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature.
The same procedures were applied to prepare the single metal-type MIL-101(Cr) at a similar timespan. At first glance, the XRD analysis showed that all samples of both single- and mixed-metal basis exhibited the pattern of the MIL-101 framework, emphasizing that fast heating via microwave radiation drives the reaction to that kinetic phase. However, at these reaction conditions, all samples of MIL-101(Cr) exhibited broader peaks corresponding to their smaller particles (∼40 nm). On the other side, samples of MIL-101(Cr/Fe) were of larger particle sizes (∼150–200 nm), and hence, their patterns were of sharper peaks. Closer looking into all these patterns showed no implications of any accompanied phases, except for the mixed-metal sample at a very long reaction time (240 min), which showed other peaks belonging to the MIL-53 “thermodynamic” phase. With its known structure flexibility, the presence of the MIL-53 particles within the 240 min MIL-101(Cr/Fe) sample has reduced the measured specific surface area to SBET = 1100 m2 g−1 (SLangmuir = 1477 m2 g−1) and the pore volume to 0.46 cm3 g−1. Unlike the hydrothermal synthesis, the initial assessment did not show any signs of the MIL-88 polymorph, but the more stable MIL-53 phase existed. Regardless, further investigations via SEM and TEM showed some traces of the hexagonal-shaped rods of MIL-88 resided in MIL-101(Cr) samples at 240 min. MIL-88 traces also appeared in most MIL-101(Cr/Fe) samples starting from 10 min and up to 240 min. Besides, the orthorhombic phase of MIL-53 did not only exist in the mixed-metal system at a longer duration of 240 min, but also traces were detected at 120 min. It is worth mentioning that pure phase MIL-88 or MIL-53 were not obtained in the single-and mixed-metal systems with increasing the reaction time to 360 min (for Cr) and 720 min (for Cr/Fe), and still mixtures of these polymorphs are collected.170
In the mixed-metal system, the amount of iron influences the formation of different building blocks. Besides, the iron content in the final products is dependant on the reaction time (Fig. 29). At shorter reaction times, Fe ions are consumed in the formation of the MIL-101 framework, and it keeps decreasing steadily up to 60 min, whereby Cr ions get more involved in the structure formation, and the MIL-88 starts to grow. At 120 min, the concentration of Fe with respect to Cr increases again, which seems to be the point when the MIL-101 particles dissociate, and the MIL-53 structure manifests. In addition, at shorter time ranges, the presence of Fe as an efficient cationic competitor was believed to urge the formation of the trinuclear oxo-centered metal cluster in a faster manner than Cr, leading to the formation of a cluster with two parts Fe and one part Cr. In this sense, and despite having an apparent well-defined shape, particles of the short-time-heated MIL-101(Cr/Fe) samples were found to comprise an interiorly distorted structure, in which the Fe–O bonds in the M3O cluster were shorter in length than that of Cr–O, causing this deformity (Fig. 30).

In a recent study to obtain a mixed-metal structure by a hydrothermal procedure, Fe was incorporated with Cr to prepare a MIL-101 framework for some catalytic applications.200 Unlike Vu's,198 different iron sources were adopted along with chromium nitrate as the metal precursors in an HF-free synthesis. Furthermore, higher percentages of Fe were targeted compared to those obtained elsewhere.199 First, iron nitrate was tried, but at a high temperature of 220 °C for 8 h, it ended up with a mixture of MIL-101 and MIL-88 polymorphs, even in the presence of an organic mineralizing agent like acetic acid (AcOH) at low concentrations. Replacing the iron nitrate by Fe0 has significantly reduced but did not completely prevent the formation of the MIL-88 phase regardless of introducing AcOH. On the other hand, synthesis in a basic medium of TMAOH was also investigated to enhance the solubility of the H2BDC linker, which may promote the growth of the MIL-101 structure. Therefore, the synthesis in a lower temperature medium of TMAOH may obtain a pure-phase of MIL-101(Cr/Fe). However, the purity of the product was dependant on the concentration of TMAOH, whereby lower concentrations than 0.06 M led to traces of MIL-53, while higher concentrations may form an amorphous structure.
In their study, MIL-101(Cr/Fe), with two different percentages, was prepared (∼15% & 20% mol Fe) in TMAOH solution. The synthesis took place in an autoclave at a reaction temperature of 150 °C for 48 h. Then, the products were activated by a KF (0.1 M) solution for 1 h. The XRD analyses were in line with the simulated pattern of MIL-101(Cr), revealing a pure MIL-101 phase. Furthermore, EDS and ICP-OES analyses confirmed equivalent amounts of Fe to that initially added to reaction medium (MIL-101(Cr/Fe) of 15% & 20% mol Fe). Moreover, the comparable particle size of both samples was observed (around 100 nm). The surface areas for the samples were SBET = 2700 m2 g−1 and 3040 m2 g−1 for the (20% mol Fe) and (15% mol Fe), respectively. However, similar pore sizes were observed, including the two types of pore sizes equal to 19 nm and 25 nm. It is worth mentioning that the thermal stability for both samples remained unchanged, regardless of the Fe content, whereby a structural degradation was detected around 300 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. Furthermore, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy confirmed the incorporation of the iron atoms in the lattice structure of the MIL-101 framework. Application of the mixed-metal MIL-101 MOF as a Lewis acid catalyst was evaluated in the Prins addition reaction of β-pinene and formaldehyde to produce Nopol [2-(7,7-dimethyl-4-bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-enyl)-ethanol]. The reaction at 80 °C in the presence of acetonitrile and MIL-101(Cr/Fe) exhibited an improved catalytic activity than MIL-101(Cr) and enhanced the chemical stability compared to MIL-101(Fe).


6.2.2 MIL-101(Fe/Al). 
Finally, aside from all the attempts to synthesize the mixed-metal MIL-101 structure of chromium and iron basis, other attempts to achieve MIL-101(Fe/Al) were also reported.201,202 In one attempt, pristine MIL-101(Fe/Al) was prepared solvothermally, whereby three molar ratios (1:1, 2:1, and 4:1) were explored.201 The reaction took place at 110 °C for 20 h in DMF as the main reaction solvent. The nitrogen sorption measurements showed a high BET surface area of all MTV samples in the range of ∼1300 m2 g−1 except for MIL-101(Fe) (SBET = 374 m2 g−1), which is too low compared to that usually obtained. The thermal stability studies displayed a higher decomposition temperature with increasing the Al content in the structure. On the other hand, the SEM images showed octahedral-shaped particles for pristine MIL-101(Fe) but totally different morphologies for all MIL-101(Fe/Al) samples. Furthermore, in some of these images, the long hexagonal-shaped particle of MIL-88 can be witnessed. Furthermore, the authors claimed the achievement of the pristine MIL-101(Al) framework along with the MIL-101(Fe/Al) samples. However, the intense peaks presented in the XRD patterns around 5°, 8.5°, 10°, 15°, 18°, and 21° for the MIL-101(Al) sample and all other MIL-101(Fe/Al) suggest the formation of the MIL-53 structure instead of the MIL-101 topology.
In another attempt to achieve the MIL-101 structure from Fe and Al, amino-functionalized MIL-101(Al/Fe) was synthesized via a rapid-reflux method.202 First, NH2-MIL-101(Al) and NH2-MIL-101(Fe) were prepared following the previously reported methods,203 then small amounts of Fe were to replace Al in the same procedures. The added amounts of Fe were around (5%, 6.67%, 10%, and 20%). The authors reported that the obtained crystals were of a size range around 30 nm, and the XRD patterns measured for all samples showed a great agreement with the simulated one. Besides, the TGA curves revealed an equivalent dissociation behavior for all samples before 300 °C, similar to that usually reported for MIL-101(Cr) and its analogues. In addition, ATR-FTIR, EPR, and elemental mapping via EDX confirmed the incorporation of both Al and Fe into the lattice structure. However, the authors mentioned that the produced crystals were not of the same octahedral shape as that of the monometallic basis. Moreover, the N2 sorption measurements exhibited a type-IV isotherm for all bimetallic samples, which is different from the type-I isotherm measured for the monometallic ones.
Hence, with all these investigations in the achievement of the mixed-metal type MIL-101 framework, it seems that the Cr/Fe studies are of higher progress than that of Fe/Al. However, such investigations on the Fe/Al-type MOF, despite being out of accuracy, seem to be inspiring and encouraging for more profound studies on this type.

7. Recent applications
The remarkable advances in tuning the characteristics of MIL-101 MOFs by grafting different functional groups and/or incorporation with co-materials in composites have widened the applications of MIL-101 in different disciplines. The improved characteristics reported in the recent literature include porous architecture, surface area, absorption spectra, adsorption selectivity, and thermal stability.16,31 In the present work, repetition and overlapping with the previous studies were avoided by limiting this review to recent MIL-101 applications. To this end, we performed a network analysis for the MIL-101 reports published in 2019 or later by VOS viewer© (Fig. 31) to sort out the most prevalent applications issued over this period (only recognized by Web of Science©). Modified surface area, porous structure, and light absorption range attracted interest towards environmental applications of MIL-101 MOFs in water and air pollution control, including but not limited to adsorption in gas and liquid environments,204 photocatalysis,205 and membrane separations.206 MIL-101 MOFs were moreover found to effectively affect the characteristics of several materials, which encouraged their utilization in other sectors such as pharmaceutical industry, analytical and sensing materials. For the sake of brevity, this review was focused on the five applications shown in Fig. 32.

7.1 Pollutant adsorption
In general, the high surface area and special pore structure of MOFs incite to explore their adsorbability for different pollutants in water. Recently, MIL-101 MOFs with different metal analogues were frequently employed either in composites or as pristine materials for the removal of toxic metals or organic pollutants. Despite the toxicity of chromium, MIL-101(Cr) based MOFs were the most ubiquitous in recent literature. None of the reviewed studies, however, investigated the possible leaching of chromium in water or other solvents. Several studies claimed the stability of MIL-101(Cr) in water, but this claimed stability was only supported by the TGA analysis without monitoring the chromium content in the reactors.207,208 Pristine MIL-101 analogues were frequently used in earlier studies revealing promising results.31,209 In more recent studies, novel composites and/or functionalized MIL-101 MOFs were employed to enhance the adsorption capacity through different mechanisms, as illustrated in Table 8. Zuo et al. used functionalized MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H for removal of three fluoroquinolone antibiotics and compared its performance to the MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and pristine MIL-101(Cr).210 For instance, the adsorption capacity was improved from 274 to 434 mg g−1 for the removal of ofloxacin, whereas it was reduced to 28 mg g−1 by using MIL-101(Cr)-NH2. The improved adsorption by MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H was attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged ionized sulfonate group and the protonated piperazinyl group in the ofloxacin molecule. On the contrary, the aminated MIL-101(Cr) acquired positive charges from the protonation of nitrogen atoms in the NH2 group, which induced repulsive forces with the ofloxacin resulting in a reduced adsorption capacity. Nevertheless, MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 showed high adsorption capacity for other pollutants such as bisphenol, whereby the adsorption capacity reached 400 mg g−1 for several cycles of reuse. This high capacity was due to the π–π interaction with MIL-101 and the H-bonding with NH2.211 In another study, three anionic dyes were adsorbed with high capacity to MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 and compared to pristine MIL-101.212 A remarkable improvement in the adsorption capacity (about 117%) was obtained upon amination of MIL-101, which was imputed to the H-bonding between the anionic molecules and NH2. Furthermore, MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 was used for the removal of hexavalent chromium of a concentration of 140 mg L−1 with an adsorption capacity of 44 mg g−1.213 Aminated MIL-101(Al) has also shown a higher adsorption capacity than aminated MIL-53 for removal of methotrexate, which has been imputed not only to the surface area but the higher positive zeta potential with the appropriate polar amino functional groups.214 MIL-101(Cr) was also functionalized by the amidoxime group to improve the selective adsorption of hexavalent uranium.215 Doping with metal ions the lattice structure of MIL-101 is another strategy to enhance the adsorbability of MIL-101 through the electrostatic interactions between the adsorbent and adsorbate. For instance, copper and cobalt were doped in MIL-101(Cr) for enhanced adsorption of tetracycline to the bimetallic MOF.216 It is worth noting that in most cases of functionalization or metal doping in MIL-101 structure, the surface area was reduced. However, the adsorption capacity was improved due to electrostatic interactions which facilitate the diffusion of the targeted molecules on the surface of MOF and into the pores.209

The adsorption capacity of MIL-101 was also improved by incorporating other materials in composites. Adding different porous materials may provide additional functional groups that contribute to the adsorption of complicated molecules and/or increase the surface area. For instance, the surface area of MIL-101(Cr) increased from 2980 to 3450 m2 g−1 by introducing graphite oxide with 6.0% wt.208 Furthermore, the addition of graphite oxide improved the stability and reusability as it kept 89% and 86% of its efficiency for adsorption of methyl orange and reactive blue 198 in five consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles, respectively. In another study, Fe3O4 was loaded on MIL-101(Fe) using 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-Dopa) as an environmentally friendly binder.217 The composite showed a very high adsorption capacity for removal of methyl red and malachite green (1250 and 853 mg g−1 respectively), besides it could be easily collected for reuse due to its magnetic properties and remarkable stability by keeping more than 95% of its efficiency in five consecutive cycles. Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) was also merged with MIL-101(Cr) for the removal of tetracycline but with no comparison with pristine MIL-101.218 The composite was further used for Fenton-like oxidation of tetracycline to reduce the required dose of the adsorbent. In a different approach, Wang et al. reported the incorporation of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate (BTP) with MIL-101(Cr) for removal of acetochlor from water.219 The composite showed a high adsorption capacity due to the H bonding and π–π interaction. A toxicity assessment study showed no acute toxicity of the composite towards two species of microorganisms. In another interesting study, polyethylene glycol was incorporated with MIL-101(Cr) to act as a hydrophobic barrier that hinders the water molecules from diffusion into the MIL-101 pores while allowing the toluene molecules to diffuse into the pores with less competition.219 The adsorption capacity of toluene of the composite was improved by about 31% compared to pristine MIL-101(Cr).
It can be noticed from Table 8 that the thermodynamic equilibria of adsorption of MIL-101 followed the Langmuir isotherm in most cases. This finding indicates that most MIL-101 based MOFs and their composites and derivatives possess homogeneous monolayer of active sites, and the adsorption occurs as a monolayer on the surface.209,215
7.2 Catalysis
Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) is the electrocatalytic reaction occurring at the cathode of a PEM fuel cell. Replacing the Pt by a non-precious metal would significantly diminish the cost of this technology. One possible strategy in doing so, is to pyrolyze a MOF material in order to generate a graphitic carbon mass loaded with a finely dispersed transition metal (usually Fe) located in a C/N environment.224,225 Recently, MIL-101 was proposed as the MOF precursor in this catalyst preparation. In ref. 226, a composite of MIL-101(Fe) and polypyrrole was carbonized yielding an active ORR catalyst (see Table 9). Some good ORR performances were also obtained in ref. 227, in which a carbon black loaded with MIL-101(Fe) was pyrolyzed in the presence of melamine. A similar concept was applied in ref. 228 and 229, where a MIL-101(Fe) was blended with polyaniline (PAni) and pyrolyzed at 800–1000 °C.

The same idea of pyrolyzing a MOF precursor was implemented in ref. 230 to generate a highly dispersed Fe phosphide on a N-grafted carbonaceous support. The precursor was a P-loaded NH2-MIL-101(Fe) and the resulting material was shown to be a good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst for water splitting. Also related to water splitting, a photocatalyst active in both water oxidation and water reduction was proposed in ref. 231. However, in the latter work, the semiconducting properties and porous structure of MIL-101(Fe) were modified at synthesis by partially substituting the H2BDC ligand with vanillin. The effect was to introduce some mesoporosity and some partial mixed valence Fe3+/Fe2+. The latter effect was enhanced by the presence of some Fe3O4 added to this catalyst.
A different problem was tackled using MIL-101(Cr) in ref. 232. Replacing noble metals in ORR and OER electrocatalysts (oxygen evolution reaction) by cheaper materials like α-MnO2 in rechargeable aqueous lithium–air batteries, would also be commercially significant. In this work, it was shown that embedding α-MnO2 in MIL-101(Cr) enhanced the activity and stability of this material as an ORR and OER electrocatalyst in basic media. Also, taking advantage of the semiconducting properties of MIL-101, a photo-electrocatalyst of water oxidation was designed in ref. 233 whereby a cobalt phosphotungstate (CoPOM) was immobilized in finely dispersed form in the pore structure of MIL-101(Cr). Similarly, in ref. 234, vanadium phosphomolybdate inserted in MIL-101(Cr) yielded an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxidation of ascorbic acid.
Besides its use as a precursor for an electrocatalyst, MIL-101 was also used as a catalyst or catalyst support. In ref. 200, for example, a 21% substitution of Fe3+ in MIL-101(Cr) was shown to enhance the inherent Lewis acidity of MIL-101(Cr), which resulted in an increase of reaction rate in the Prins condensation of β-pinene with benzaldehyde. Similar substitution of 25% Fe into a MIL-101(Cr/Fe) MTV yielded an active and reusable photo-Fenton oxidation catalyst.198
Catalytic activity may also be generated by functionalizing a MOF linker. In ref. 235, a grafted ferrocene group was generated by the reaction of ferrocene carboxaldehyde with NH2-MIL-101(Fe). The resulting material was shown active in oxidation by potassium persulfate of bisphenol-A in aqueous solution. Similarly, strong sulfonic acid centers were generated by reacting NH2-MIL-101(Cr) with propane sultone.236 The product, a RSO3-NH-MIL-101(Cr), was found very active in the synthesis of a variety of quinoxalines by condensation of a 1,2-diamine with 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds.
In ref. 237, three catalysts were generated by first anchoring RuCl3 in NH2-MIL-101(Cr) through coordination to the nitrogen atom. Two of them were obtained by further reacting the amine group of RuCl3@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) with salicylaldehyde (RuCl3@MIL-101(Cr)sal.) or with diphenyl phosphine benzaldehyde (RuCl3@MIL-101(Cr)DPPB). All three catalysts were found active in the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid.
The mere encapsulation of phosphotungstic acid in MIL-101(Cr) was shown possible in ref. 238. The resulting PTA@MIL-101(Cr) was an active and reusable catalyst in a whole series of Biginelli condensation reactions.
The concept of generating a composite material by simultaneous synthesis of MIL-101 with some iron oxidic compound was implemented in ref. 239 and 240. In ref. 240, a Fe3O4-MIL-101(Fe) was used as a catalyst for Fenton-type oxidation of rhodamine B by H2O2. The effect of MIL-101 was through its Lewis acid properties, keeping the reaction medium neutral. In ref. 239, a CoFe2O4 mixed oxide was compounded with MIL-101(Cr) and used as a catalyst for sonocatalytic oxidation of rhodamine B by H2O2.
The most frequently reported use of MIL-101 in catalysis seems however to be as a support for finely dispersed metal particles. This is not only related to the MOF textural properties and stability of the MIL-101 crystal structure. All these would make it comparable to zeolites in terms of stabilization of highly dispersed nanoparticles. In addition, MOFs allow controlling the chemical environment of the dispersed metal. For example, in ref. 241, Pd particles were created in a sulfonic acid functionalized MIL-101(Cr). The material was intended as a catalyst for the hydroxygenation of vanillin in aqueous solution. The sulfonic acid groups made the solid hydrophilic, which significantly enhanced the reaction rate and selectivity to the secondary product 2-methoxy-4-methyl phenol.
The reaction of CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid is of current interest as providing a way for the chemical storage of hydrogen in the liquid phase.242 In ref. 243, a good catalyst for this reaction was obtained by grafting triethylene diamine (TEDA) in NH2-MIL-101(Cr) and dispersing PdAg alloy nanoparticles in the resulting solid. A similar concept was applied in ref. 244 to develop a catalyst for the reverse reaction producing hydrogen from formic acid. In that work, a diamine such as ethylene diamine was also coordinated to the Cr ions of MIL-101(Cr) and Pd nanoparticles were then inserted in the ED@MIL-101(Cr). For this same reverse reaction, the work in ref. 245 demonstrated that a high TOF (848 h−1) can also be reached using an optimized alloy composition Ag20Pd80 in a simple AgPd@MIL-101(Cr).
Other hydrogen-generating reactions were dealt with in ref. 246 (aqueous hydrazine, RhNi@MIL-100(Cr)), and ref. 247 (methylamine borane, Cu@MIL-100(Cr)). A technique of in situ reduction of a silver salt by sodium borohydride in MIL-101(Fe) was proposed in ref. 248 to generate silver nanoclusters in MIL-101(Fe). The produced AgNC@MIL-101(Fe) was shown to be active in 4-nitroaniline hydrogenation. It was also said to be fluorescent and magnetically separable.
Selective hydrogenation reactions of α,β unsaturated aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde or furfural require heterogeneous catalysts bearing Lewis acid sites such as the Cr(III) of MIL-101(Cr) for adsorption of these aldehydes. In ref. 249, a remarkably selective catalyst was obtained by adjusting the composition of Pt–Co nanoparticles dispersed in a MIL-101(Cr). Additional Lewis acid sites were shown to be formed at the interface between the MOF and the metal particle leading to high TOF in addition to unsaturated alcohol selectivity.
In ref. 250, an epoxidation catalyst was designed by dispersion Au nanoparticles in a NH2-MIL-101(Cr) support. This solid was found active, selective, and reusable (four times) in the epoxidation of styrene by using tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidizing agent.
The carboxylation of terminal alkynes, such as phenyl acetylene by CO2 forming propiolic acids, would be a fine addition to the various methods of CO2 valorization in Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) strategies. In ref. 251, Pd–Cu nanoalloys were dispersed in the framework of MIL-101(Cr). The optimum alloy composition was established to be Pd0.62Cu0.8. The catalyst was found to be active, selective, and reusable in the carboxylation of a variety of terminal alkyne compounds.
The problem of converting a powdered MOF into a form of catalyst usable in a large-scale reactor, is very seldom dealt with in literature. The authors of ref. 252 used a technique developed by Gascon et al.253 by which particles of MIL-101(Cr) were coated on an alumina pellet. They used this material as a catalyst for methanation of CO2 after inserting Ni particles in the MOF porous structure. This catalyst was shown to be active and selective up to 320 °C.
7.3 Photocatalysis
Photocatalytic reactions show advantages compared to other advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially in the sector of water treatment, due to their high efficiency with minimum solid waste (i.e., sludge production and possible utilization of solar energy).257 Theoretically, photocatalysts are not consumed during the photocatalytic reaction, and they are expected to work infinitely if employed under appropriate conditions. However, the accumulation of surrounding molecules adsorbed on their surface detracts their photocatalytic performance after some periods of operation.258 Despite the abundant literature on metal oxides and carbonaceous photocatalysts, many of these reveal significant limitations such as a limited absorption of visible light, fast recombination of opposite charge carriers, and fast surface accumulation due to the low surface area, which limit the reusability.259–262 MIL-101 MOFs could overcome some of the concerns associated with the conventional photocatalysts due to their low bandgap and high surface area. As illustrated in Table 10, most pristine MIL-101 MOFs and their modified forms showed bandgaps lower than 2.9 eV which allows to slightly harvest more energy from the visible light spectra compared to the benchmark photocatalyst TiO2, which has a bandgap ≈ 3.2 eV.263 To confirm activity under visible light, many researchers used xenon (Xe) lamps with a cut-off filter for UV light, so the MOF particles were illuminated by only visible light.264,265 However, pristine MIL-101 MOFs revealed fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes inhibiting their photocatalytic activity.266 To overcome these limitations, MIL-101 was coupled with other semiconductors in different heterojunctions so the electrons can move from the organic linkers and metal nodes to the merged semiconductor reducing the recombination rate.267,268 In most of the reported MIL-101 heterojunctions, both levels of the valence and conduction bands of MIL-101 were either higher than the corresponding levels of the cocatalysts or both were lower than the corresponding levels of the cocatalysts, which generated a reduced bandgap of the heterojunction in the form of staggered band as shown in Fig. 33.205,266,267,269–274 For instance, Abdpour et al. synthesized a composite of NH2-MIL-101(Cr) and CuS with conduction bands of −0.50 and −0.65 eV (vs. NHE) and valence bands of +2.10, +1.15 eV (vs. NHE) respectively.269 This band structure formed what is known by a Z-scheme charge separation mechanism whereby the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of NH2-MIL-101(Cr) interact with the holes in the valence band of CuS, leading to higher redox capacity and more efficient electron–hole separation. It can be noticed that the positions of the MIL-101 band in different studies were not the same (Fig. 33), which may be related to the percentage of the metal element in MIL-101. For instance, Vu et al. reported a Cr mass ratio of 17.8% in their pristine MIL-101(Cr) determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),198 whereas Chang et al. reported a Cr mass ratio of 25.5% for a similar MOF.204 The graphical approximation and assumptions in Mott–Schottky and Tauc diagrams may also lead to further variations in the determination of the band structure.

Furthermore, the porous structure of MIL-101 is appropriate to host other metal oxides as co-catalysts which can act as electron mediators or acceptors helping to facilitate the separation of charges and reduce the overall bandgap.267 For instance, Zhang et al. modified MIL-101(Fe) with TiO2 for enhancing the degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants under visible light.267 The composite showed a smaller arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) than both TiO2 and pristine MIL-101(Fe), which indicated the improved electron–hole separation. In another study, CdS nanoparticles were introduced to MIL-101(Cr) to enhance the reduction of CO2 to CO under visible light.275 The composite possessed a reduced bandgap (2.28 eV) and higher sensitivity to visible light than the pristine MIL-101(Cr). In addition, the transient photocurrent responses in multiple on–off cycles of visible light indicated clearly higher photocurrent intensity than the pristine components confirming the efficiency of transfer and separation of charges. This finding corresponds to the significantly enhanced CO production yield observed when the composite was illuminated. Li et al. introduced AgBr and CuFe2O4 to MIL-101(Cr) for efficient reduction of nitrate to nitrogen under UV irradiation.276 The different valence and conduction potentials of the three incorporated materials formed a useful direct dual Z-scheme that facilitates the transfer of electrons. The long electron path in this dual Z-scheme provided a higher opportunity for the nitrate conversion into nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium. The stability of the composite was confirmed by the stable conversion of nitrate in four consecutive cycles. In a different approach, NaGdF4:Yb,Er nanoparticles were attached to MIL-101(Cr) to exploit the natural luminance of the lanthanide metals in tuning the absorbed light into more harvestable wavelengths.277 The composite could completely degrade rhodamine B, whereas less than 50% of the initial rhodamine B concentration was removed by pristine MIL-101(Cr).
Carbonaceous co-catalysts were also anchored to the porous MIL-101 MOFs to improve their photocatalytic activity. For instance, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was introduced to MIL-101(Fe) for the reduction of Cr(VI) and oxidation of bisphenol-A.278 In this study, the photocatalytic performance of the composite was higher than those of solely MIL-101(Fe) and g-C3N4, which was attributed to the direct Z-scheme formed by the different band alignments of both components. Furthermore, the composite revealed a reduced bandgap (2.28 eV) which improved the absorption of visible light. In a different study, a similar composite was used as a photocatalyst for the activation of persulfate under visible light.272 The electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the composites and pristine components indicated that MIL-101(Fe) was mainly responsible for producing sulfate radicals, whereas g-C3N4 generated superoxide radicals and catalyzed the generation of sulfate radicals. Trapping experiments using different scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ascertained the same finding as to the ESR analysis. A similar approach was adopted to utilize MIL-101(Fe)-g-C3N4/NH2 in photocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction under visible light.279 Unlike the conventional photocatalysts, it can be noticed that superoxide radicals and holes were the main significant ROS in most MIL-101 photocatalytic reactions, whereas hydroxyl radicals were rarely found to be the dominant species, except for some composites where the co-catalysts were anchored to the porous structure of MIL-101. This finding indicates that MIL-101 could be a useful alternative photocatalyst for applications that require special ROS generation.
7.4 Membrane filtration
In general, MOFs are of special interest as a dispersed phase in designing mixed matrix membranes (MMM). This is because they can be synthesized in functional form with intrinsic porosity. With other microporous materials such as for example zeolites, the post-synthesis grafting of functional groups on the particles external surface, which is necessary to secure interaction with the polymeric continuous phase, is likely to result in pore blockage.284,285
The controllable pore size and structure, along with the high surface area rich in metal sites, made the MIL-101 MOFs promising for fabrication or modifications of MMMs. Notwithstanding the limited number of publications reporting the employment of MIL-101 MOFs in membrane technology, the applications and roles of MIL-101 in these reports are of high diversity. Sharma et al. prepared a composite membrane of MIL-101(Cr)-sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) to utilize the unsaturated Cr sites and the acidic functional groups (–SO3H) in the selective electrodialytic removal of bi-valent lead.286 Interestingly, the fabricated membrane showed high permeability for monovalent (Na+) and bi-valent (Zn2+, and Ni2+) ions, whereas it was impervious for the Pb2+ ions under the optimum electrodialytic conditions. In addition, the thermal, mechanical, oxidative, and hydrolytic stabilities of the composite membrane were significantly higher than those of pristine sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) (SPES) membrane. In another study, Fang et al. introduced MIL-101(Cr) nanoparticles to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) hybrid membranes to enhance the gas permeance and the selective separation of hydrocarbons.287 The propylene permeance was improved by more than 50% and the diffusion rate was faster by 236% compared to pristine PDMS membranes. The unique surface area and pore architecture of MIL-101 also led to propylene sorption selectivity over nitrogen. Rajati et al. fabricated a mixed matrix membrane of MIL-101(Cr) microparticles, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and a commercially available polyimide designated as “Matrimid”.288 The product comparison with a neat Matrimid membrane revealed an improvement in CO2 permeability by 29% and increased selectivity over methane by 23%. Song et al. modified the poly ether-block-amide (Pebax 1657) membrane with MIL-101 and NH2-MIL-101 under different temperatures.289 They found that the modified membranes could be more effective for the separation of CO2/N2 at sub-ambient temperature. Besides, the selectivity of CO2 was improved at −20 °C by 96.5% and 145.1% compared to ambient temperature. In a similar approach, Rodrigues et al. fabricated mixed membranes of UiO-66 (Zr) or MIL-101 (Cr) and polyurethane for O2/N2 and CO2/N2 gas separation.290 The modified MIL-101 (Cr)/polyurethane membrane showed the highest CO2/N2 separation, whereas the selectivity and permeability of O2/N2 were not enhanced. Furthermore, the mixed matrix membranes showed better thermal stability than the pristine polyurethane membrane.
MIL-101 was also used to facilitate the water permeability in desalination membranes. For instance, Song et al. fabricated a reverse osmosis membrane by the polymerization of MIL-101(Cr) polyhedral particles on graphene oxide sheets.291 By such modification, the water flux was improved from 20.5 to 38.0 L m−2 L−1, with a slight improvement of NaCl rejection. In another study, MIL-101 was merged into poly-ether-block-amide (PEBA) polymer to obtain an effective mixed matrix membrane for the selective ethyl acetate pervaporation.292 The modified membrane showed a separation factor of 208 and a normalized flux of 52 kg μm m−2 h−1, which were better than the MIL-101 free membrane by 206% and 130%, respectively. In another interesting study, Khdhayyer et al. fabricated different mixed matrix membranes using a polymer of intrinsic micro-porosity with different structures of MIL-101(Cr) to study the effects of particle size, functional groups, and different precursors.293 The permeability, diffusivity, and selectivity of He, H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO2 through the different membranes revealed that the aminated and ethylene diamine MIL-101 enhanced the permeability of O2 and N2, but did not improve the performance for the CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation. Incorporating MIL-101 of nano-scale particles led to a remarkable increase in the permeability of all gases without significant change in the selectivity. For a different objective, Ni et al. anchored a composite of CdS/MIL-101 on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane to employ it in an anammox membrane bioreactor.206 The produced mixed membrane was illuminated by visible light to establish the effect of the composite on biofouling. In the long-term operation, the modified membranes maintained their performance for 26 d compared to 10–14 d for pristine membranes. Furthermore, the analysis of the biofilms on the fouled membranes indicated an improved degradation of organic foulants and inactivation of bacteria. Other antibacterial tests exhibited the ability of the composite for the destruction of the cell walls of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
7.5 Sensitive detection
The unique porous structure of MOFs, their extreme surface area, and the abundance of functional groups make them ideal candidates for the detection of different analytes. These features lead to significant diffusion of the analytes into the pores allowing several reactions with the functional groups.294 The detection of analytes by MOFs could be attained either by inserting them in chemically modified electrodes or by modulation of luminescence of a probe. A luminescence detection system includes an excitation source, a luminescent MOF probe, a detector and signal output.295 Notwithstanding the luminescence detection is a low-cost technology that is distinguished with easy operation and low detection limits, it suffers from limited selectivity and multiple analyte detection. The chemical detection by MOFs is dependent on the accumulation of the targeted analyte on the surface and pores of a MOF electrode which can be more selective.294
MIL-101 as one of the predominant MOFs has been reported in many applications of detectors and sensors as a pristine material or mixed with other materials. For instance, Yang et al. prepared a fluorescent composite sensor from amino carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and MIL-101-SO3H nanoparticles for detecting 2,4-dinitrophenol.296 In this system, the MIL-101-SO3H encapsulated the CQDs by hydrogen bonding between the SO3H and NO2 groups. It also acted as a selective adsorbent to capture the targeted analyte. The composite exhibited a remarkable selectivity towards the 2,4-dinitrophenol with a detection limit of 0.041 μM. Mousavi et al. also used amino-CQDs with MIL-101(Fe) to fabricate a hybrid fluorescent probe sensor for the detection of 6-mercaptopurine.297 In their approach, the interaction between the MIL-101(Fe) functional groups and 6-mercaptopurine was converted into detectable fluorescence signals. The produced sensor displayed high selectivity toward 6-mercaptopurine in the presence of a variety of organic and inorganic interfering substances. Moreover, it showed detection and quantification limits of 55.7 and 202.06 ng L−1, respectively.
In a similar approach, a quartz crystal microbalance was coated by MIL-101(Cr) by the drop-casting method for the sensitive detection of formaldehyde.298 The detector showed high sensitivity to formaldehyde with a detection limit of 1.79 ppm. Interestingly, the sensor revealed remarkable selectivity to formaldehyde against a variety of volatile organic compounds, including acetone, methanol, and ethanol, which was attributed to the hydrogen bonding between formaldehyde molecules and carboxylate groups in MIL-101(Cr). The same system was reported in another study for detecting various volatile organics such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-hexane, acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and pyridine in an N2 environment.299 The system showed higher sensitivity to pyridine, than chloroform, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran in this order, whereas it revealed moderate response for other studied substances. The limits of detection of these substances varied according to the sensitivity to each analyte. For instance, they were 1.60, 3.06, 8.86, 14.17, and 18.40 ppm for pyridine, isopropanol, ethanol, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran, respectively.
In a different approach, Guo et al. proposed an innovative sensitive fluorescence sensor using MIL-101(Fe) loaded with nanozyme for the detection of choline and acetylcholine.300 Their method was dependent on the reaction of acetylcholinesterase to hydrolyze acetylcholine into chlorine which further reacts with choline oxidase to form H2O2. The MIL-101(Fe) nanozyme as a catalyst decomposes H2O2 in hydroxyl radicals forming highly fluorescent 2-hydroxy terephthalic acid as a product of the oxidation of organic ligand terephthalic acid in the MIL-101(Fe) structure. Through this mechanism, chlorine and acetylcholine could be sensed with detection limits of 20.0 nM and 8.9 nM, respectively. In another study, Zhang et al. developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of microcystin-LR in aquatic solutions.301 The sensor comprised MIL-101(Cr) and Au nanoparticles, which revealed high catalytic oxidation potential to ascorbic acid. The developed sensor showed a detection limit of 0.02 ng mL−1 with a linear relationship in the range of 0.05 ng mL−1 to 75 μg mL−1. Gan et al. developed a voltammetric sensor of MIL-101(Cr) modified by consecutive acid etching in a quest for better hierarchical hollow cages.302 The produced hollow sensor showed a remarkable voltammetric response for the detection of nitrofurazone in food samples with a linear relation in the range of 0.03 to 55 μM and a detection limit of 10 nM. For a different objective, Zhang et al. developed a MIL-101(Cr) sensor for humidity sensing properties.303 The sensor covered a humidity range of (33% to 95%) with a response time of 17 s and a recovery time of 90 s. With further advancements in MIL-101 synthesis and modifications to obtain different tailor-made designs, a significant potential for developing more MIL-101 sensors for various applications is predicted.
7.6 Drug delivery
In addition to the aforementioned applications, MIL-101 was recently employed in various products and systems to exploit its unique characteristics in the improvement of various functions. For instance, MIL-101 was recently used in drug delivery for tuning the properties of some pharmaceuticals through interaction with the metal or organic linker. MIL-101 allows large drug loading and encapsulation of different pharmaceuticals.304 Almasi et al. synthesized MIL-101(Fe)-NH2 and modified it with ethylenediamine and 1,2-bis(3-aminopropylamino)ethane to study its performance in the delivery of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory naproxen.305 The naproxen delivery from the synthesized amine MIL-101 was observed in simulated body fluids. In another study, Gordon et al. utilized different MOFs including MIL-101 for prolonging the administration of acetaminophen, progesterone, and stavudine.304 The adsorption of drugs into the caves and pores of MIL-101 led to prolonged release time reached 5 days, which is very beneficial in some medical applications. Cabrera-García et al. developed amine-functionalized MIL-101(Fe) and MIL-100(Fe) as platforms for the delivery of camptothecin.306 The delivery by MIL-101(Fe) revealed enhanced cell internalization at positive zeta-potential and improved intracellular release by the endosomolytic activity. MIL-101 MOFs was not reported to be toxic or dangerous when administered orally. On the contrary, Liu et al. found that there is no acute oral toxicity or 28 day oral toxicity of MIL-101(Cr) nanoparticles on mice.307 The results indicated that a dose of 2000 mg per kg body weight did not reveal any mortality or changes in feed consumption, body weight, organ weight, or behavior. Furthermore, the histopathology assessment revealed no acute or subacute toxicity after oral administration for 28 days.307
8. Conclusions
To sum up, MIL-101 framework is still one of the highly researched MOFs so far for combining many sought for features of interest in several applications. For instance, MIL-101 MOFs possess: (i) mesoporous rigid structure. (ii) Notably high surface area. (iii) Remarkable chemical stability in numerous organic solvents, acids, and hydrogen peroxide. (iv) Moderate thermal stability up to 300 °C. Hence, numerous research groups are now investigating this framework. However, the reproducibility of the achieved properties, which depend on the synthesis conditions and the preparation method, is still being doubted, and research is ongoing to gain a complete comprehension of its chemistry. As discussed in this review, MIL-101(Cr) was originally synthesized hydrothermally in acidic medium, using HF. Synthesis in a fluoride-free environment has shown HNO3 to be the second-best choice. Acid-free synthesis was also reported. Nevertheless, synthesis in a basic medium using TMAO resulted in a completely pure product with a yield of 88%. Later, other synthesis techniques, such as the microwave-assisted technique, the mechanochemical method, the dry-gel route, along with a combination of these, have been explored. The hydrothermal one is still the most utilized technique.
Further studies explored exceptional structures with different trivalent ions and various functionalized linkers, to widen the MIL-101 field of application. This review also presented the other analogues to the chromium framework that involved Fe, Al, V, Ti, Sc, and Mn. Most of them were prepared using the corresponding metal chloride and DMF as the reaction solvent. The iron isomorph, as the second most studied analogue after chromium, has found a wider range of applications, especially in the biomedical field, for being made using a safer ion. However, the iron-type structure showed lower stability than the chromium-type. On the other hand, the direct preparation of aluminum isomorph was limited to the amino-functionalized derivative, whereas the other forms could be obtained indirectly via the deamination of the amino-functionalized structure. The vanadium and titanium analogues were more sensitive to air and moisture. The isostructural isomorphs of scandium and manganese need more investigation as there is no clear information about their preparation, activation, and applications.
Furthermore, other framework isomers or polymorphs were obtained by deviation from the mainly targeted structure MIL-101. MOFs like MIL-88, MIL-53, MOF-235, MIL-47, and MIL-67 with totally diverse characteristics were found to grow from the same precursors of the trivalent metal ion and the ditopic linker. The growth of these unintended products was dependant on time and additives. Structures and highlights of these different MOFs were discussed concisely.
Finally, multivariate frameworks (MTV-MOFs) of a mixed-metal source to obtain the MIL-101 structure with synergistically enhanced properties were presented. Post-synthetic modification and direct synthesis as the main techniques to reach such a goal were discussed and the known attempts were reviewed. The chromium and iron-based MIL-101 have recorded far more progress than any other, and their structure was obtained by various methods and under different conditions. However, MTV-MIL-101s synthesized from iron and aluminum are still under investigation, and they were reported in a limited number of publications. It seems that there is much more to study about the improvement of these interesting MOFs and their applications.
Adsorption, catalysis, photocatalysis, membranes technology, detecting sensors, and drug delivery are the most reported fields of application of MIL-101 in the recent literature. Most of the MIL-101 adsorbents were modified by functional groups to improve the adsorbability and the selectivity towards specific adsorbates. Pyrolyzing MIL-101, either pure or in combination with other materials, was found useful in producing various carbon-based electrocatalysts. The MIL-101 photocatalysts showed improved photocatalytic activity due to their low bandgaps. Besides, the high surface area led to better stability and reusability for longer cycles. Some MIL-101 photocatalysts were merged in composites with metal oxides to improve their performance by Z-scheme bandgaps. MIL-101 was incorporated in the membrane industry to exploit the controllable pore size for the regulation of liquid or gas flow. Furthermore, the utilization of functionalized MIL-101 allowed the design of highly selective membranes. The functionalization of MIL-101 was useful in the design of sensors and probes due to the improved selectivity of the targeted analytes. MIL-101 was employed in drug delivery as a metal or organic linker and for encapsulation of several drugs.
