    , Accepted 6th July 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractWe developed triple bonded π-conjugated zinc-phthalocyanine dimers (ZnPc-t-DPP-t-ZnPc 1, ZnPc-t-t-ZnPc 2, ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3) through molecular engineering, and these dimers were then employed as hole selective layers for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The designed dimers showed band alignment with a mixed cation perovskite, and efficient charge extraction capability, thus allowing subsequent improvement in the performance of the PSCs. The fabricated PSC with the dimer ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3 surpasses the PSC performance based on the state-of-the-art Sprio-OMeTAD. ZnPc dimers displayed improved long-term stability under stress conditions.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskites are being considered a new paradigm for sustainable energy harvesting owing to their potentially attractive optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficients and long carrier diffusion lengths, tolerance to defects, and the possibility of processing from solutions at low temperatures.1–3 Their application in photovoltaics (PVs) further promises flexibility, light weight, and efficient performances. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) comparably matches that of mature silicon-based cells (27.6%), measuring power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.7%.4,5 Nevertheless, the vital challenge for PSCs to be commercially exploited is the lack of long-term stability against moisture, heat, and prolonged light soaking resulting in ion migration and segregation.6 The charge-selective layers play a decisive role in achieving the performance of PSCs.7–9 In PSCs the photoactive perovskite layer is sandwiched between the hole transporting material (HTM) and the electron transporting material (ETM).10–13 Based on the stacking of each layer, the PSC architecture can be of mesoscopic (n-i-p) and inverted planar (p-i-n) configuration. The highest PCE (>25%) was measured in the n-i-p structure device while p-i-n (planar) PSCs hold the merit of easy fabrication and versatility in terms of energy band engineering. The use of an HTM is essential for promoting efficient charge extraction and transport, and suppression of photoinduced carrier recombination. Arguably, the HTMs play a vital role in the stability of PSCs to isolate and protect the active layer from moisture. Based on inorganic or organic nature, various types of HTMs have been developed and can be divided into polymer or small molecules.10 The widely used and state-of-the-art HTMs are the small molecule 2,2′,7,-7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and the polymer poly-(triarylamine) (PTAA) that delivered high PCEs but are cost-uncompetitive and induce instability over time.14,15
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are known to be robust semiconducting materials with remarkable optoelectronic properties, such as intense absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as chemical versatility.16–19 Such merits led to the application of Pcs in multiple technologies, including photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy against cancer, as active materials in organic solar cells and gas sensors, etc.20,21 Pcs have been employed as HTM layers in PSCs;17,22,23 a nickel phthalocyanine based dopant-free HTM exhibited efficient performance in PSCs,24 while PSCs with zinc phthalocyanines as HTMs yielded a PCE of 17.5%.25 Notably, PSCs with Pcs as the HTM are usually more stable against deterioration than the reference devices.26–28 Pc dimers are known to be used in the application of controllable molecular switches, and their large delocalization and high charge mobility favor them to be a new class of semiconductor materials.29,30
Zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) dimers31 are competitive HTMs, to balance the trade of stability and performance.32ZnPc-DPP-ZnPc (Fig. 1) resulted in the best PCE when applied as a dopant-free HTM in n-i-p type PSCs, reaching 16.8% PCE, and also showed improved stability as compared to Spiro-OMeTAD based devices. It is worth highlighting that planar molecular structures favors the mobility of charges in the solid state.32 Rather, such structures can aggregate forming extensive crystalline domains that results in incomplete coverage and overly thick layers. Three-dimensional (3D) structures can solve this issue since less intense intermolecular interactions lead to more uniform layers. A well-designed 3D molecule will result in a layer of controlled thickness with adequate charge mobility. Here, the study of three diethynyl conjugated ZnPc dimers as HTMs is presented (ZnPc-t-DPP-t-ZnPc 1, ZnPc-t-t-ZnPc 2, and ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3, Fig. 1). For the ease of reading, from here on, we have referred the ZnPc dimers ZnPc-t-DPP-t-ZnPc 1, ZnPc-t-t-ZnPc 2, and ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3 as ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, respectively. Diketopyrolopyrole (DPP) is a well-known electron-deficient building block and its potential as an active material due to its higher carrier mobility and surface morphology has been documented.33 A strong π–π stacking is induced in the solid-state due to the planar molecular core and a strong supramolecular interaction is favored. Additionally, the alkyl substituents also help in fine-tuning intermolecular packing structures and therefore render tunable charge transport properties. Moreover, the larger polarizability of the sulfur atoms of the thiophene heterocycle stabilizes the molecular system and valence band of the frontier molecular orbitals and the two oxygen atoms in the fused ring enhance the molecular dipole, constructing an internal electrical field to facilitate the charge transport.24 Additionally, the more polarizable sulfur atoms can induce effective mobility that is desirable to achieve higher current density. ZnPc 1 represents a simple modification of ZnPc-DPP-ZnPc that involves binding DPP to the ZnPc rings through triple bonds to distinguish the impact of a higher degree of self-organization (π–π aggregation) for device application. The inclusion of triple bonds along the π-linker in the ZnPc dimers allows co-planarity in the molecular core structure of the HTMs.34ZnPc 2 is a simplified structure with two contiguous triple bonds as linkers of both ZnPc macrocycles. In this context, to obtain a 3D structure, we designed a new dimer containing 2′,7′-diethynylfluorene as the linker element (ZnPc 3). Spirobifluorene based building blocks have been extensively investigated in the synthesis of organic semiconductors for organic electronics, and owing to the existence of the sp3 hybridised atoms at the junction of the π-conjugated system, fluorene-based molecules offer advantages such as high glass transition temperature (Tg), morphological stability and excellent solubility.

2. Results and discussion
The three ZnPc dimers were the products of Sonogashira coupling reaction. Dimer ZnPc 1 was synthesized as per our previous report33 from iodophthalocyanine 4 with diethynyl-DPP 5 with 30% yield (Scheme 1a). To improve the yield of ZnPc 1, we carried out the synthesis from ethynylphthalocyanine 6 and dibrominated DPP 7 (Scheme 1b). However, using this route we obtained ZnPc 1 in only an 8% yield due to the appearance of high homocoupling products. ZnPc 2 was synthesized according to the literature.35ZnPc 3 was also initially synthesized from ethynylphthalocyanine 6 and the corresponding dibromo derivative 8 in 15% yield (Scheme 1c), although the performance was improved up to 54% by coupling iodophthalocyanine 4 and diethynylspirofluorene 9 (Scheme 1d). ZnPc-t-DPP-t-ZnPc 1 and ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3 were fully characterized by 1H NMR, UV-vis, and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry; ZnPc-t-Spiro-t-ZnPc 3 was characterized by 1H NMR and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).

The three dimers are readily soluble in THF; although ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3 are less soluble in common organic solvents, ZnPc 2 is nearly soluble in solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and dichloromethane at room temperature.
Spectroscopic and electrochemistry and structural studies
The UV-vis absorption of the ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 were studied in THF solution and in thin film form (Fig. 2a and b, Table 1). The absorption spectra of Pcs exhibit two typical characteristic band, which are usually the B-bands located at around 250–350 nm in the ultraviolet region, and the Q-band that appears at a higher wavelength region at around 500–750 nm. Notably, Pcs are highly conjugated molecules, and thus the absorption maxima corresponding to the Q-bands appear at longer wavelengths, 709 nm, 703 nm, and 690 nm for ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 respectively. The bathochromic shifts of the phthalocyanines can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. It can be deduced from the absorption spectra that the Q-bands of the dimers appear to split into two by the existence of several regioisomers with a non-symmetric character that induces π–π* excitation between the bonding and the antibonding molecular orbitals.36ZnPc 1 has a lower molar extinction coefficient, and probably it tends to stack more than the other dimers even in dilute solutions. The absorption spectra of the thin films display large broadening of the Q-bands which reflects the strong molecular interactions.

To investigate the potential application of ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 as HTMs in PSCs, we determined the energy alignment with the help of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The solution of phthalocyanines was prepared in THF and measured to deduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 2c and Table 1). The redox couple ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) was used as the external standard, and 4.8 eV below the vacuum was used as the reference level. HOMO values of the ZnPc dimers were favorable to extract holes from the perovskite active layer and similar for the three derivatives (−4.89 eV, −5.00 eV, and −4.87 eV for ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, respectively). The hole extraction ability of the developed HTMs was noted to be worthy of device integration. According to the calculated LUMO values, ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 (−3.16 eV, −3.67 eV, and −3.64 eV, respectively) could effectively block electrons. The energy bands diagram of ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 are in alignment with the perovskite used (Fig. 2d).
To evaluate the influence of the optical properties of ZnPc dimers as HTMs on the perovskite layer, the absorption was measured (Fig. 3a). We noted higher absorption intensity peaks of the perovskite films with ZnPcs as the over-layer as compared to only perovskite layer. Metal phthalocyanines also show light absorption properties in the near-infrared (NIR) region. The higher absorption for ZnPc dimers in the range of 550–800 nm could be assumed to be due to the Q-band transition and hence its addition as an HTM layer on the top of the perovskite influenced the optical absorption of the perovskite/HTM thin films in the region 550–780 nm.

We performed the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement for the perovskite and with ZnPc dimers as HTMs, the Pc coated perovskites shows quenching, indicating the effectiveness of HTMs in hole extraction (Fig. 3b). The π–π stacking present in the Pcs with the peripheral groups allows the favorable interface with the perovskite layer that favors PL quenching. ZnPc 3 showed the maximum PL quenching behavior, followed by ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 2.
The lower surface roughness and uniform film coverage of an HTM play a role in enhancing the PV performances in PSCs, and we recorded the surface microstructure of the perovskite (Fig. S3, ESI†) and with Pcs under undoped conditions (Fig. 4a–c). The Pcs exhibit a uniform capping layer deposition with fewer pinholes in the undoped state on perovskites. However, under the doped state (Fig. S4, ESI†), the microstructure of ZnPc 1 aggregates on the top of the perovskite layer with less uniformity, resulting in incomplete coverage, while ZnPc 2 and ZnPc 3 showed a similar pattern in morphology and uniformity in the surface coverage.

We measured the surface properties induced by Pcs by goniometry measurements. The contact angle values for only perovskite (Fig. S5, ESI†), and with undoped ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 were found to be 75°, and 96°, 93°, and 95° (inset Fig. 4a–c); while under the doping conditions, we noted reduced contact angle values to 78°, 79°, and 81° (Fig. S6, ESI†) for ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, respectively. The use of a hygroscopic dopants compromises the surface properties under the doped state.
Electrical properties and device performance
We conducted the space-charge-limit-current (SCLC) measurement to measure the hole mobility (μ) with the device architecture FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. The hole mobility (Fig. 5a) was calculated using J–V curves by fitting to the Mott–Gurney law (J = 9εε0μV2app/8L3). The doped ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 showed hole mobilities of 2.83 × 10−5, 1.50 × 10−5, and 4.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while that of doped Spiro-OMeTAD was found to be 1.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. ZnPc 3 showed better hole extracting and transporting behavior, corresponding to molecular conjugation and π–π stacking. We probed the charge transport properties of ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 by measuring the linear current vs. voltage (I–V) profile (Fig. 5b) of the device (FTO/HTM/Au) under dark conditions. The calculated conductivities were found to be 1.05, 0.51, and 1.23 μS cm−1 for ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, respectively. Further, to evaluate the Pcs as HTMs in PSCs we fabricated n-i-p devices as FTO/bl-meso TiO2/(MAPbBr3)0.15(FAPbI3)0.85/HTM/Au (Fig. 5c). The short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) measured under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm2, of the PSCs with Pc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, and Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM are presented (Fig. 5d) and tabulated (Table 2). We noted that the optimized concentration is 15 mM for ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 as HTMs for PSCs. The Pcs were doped with tert-butyl pyridine (t-BP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Li-TFSI). The PSC based on ZnPc 3 as the HTM demonstrated a PCE of 18.32% (Voc of 1039 mV, Jsc of 23.63 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.62%), outperforming the performance of the Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC with a PCE of 17.42% (Voc 1059 mV, Jsc 22.84 mA cm−2, FF 71.97%). The competitive performance of ZnPc 3 is in agreement with our electro-optical characterization. ZnPc 1 (PCE 16.49%) and ZnPc 2 (PCE 12.82%) comparatively showed lower performance.

The plausible reason for the lower performance could be the lower solubility in the preferred solvent or the molecular aggregation that hinders the effective energetic coupling of the layers, resulting in lower device PCE. We ascribed the improved current density (Jsc) of ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3 to the effective hole extraction at the interfaces, as noted from the PL spectra and higher carrier concentration. In addition, the presence of DPP as a linker in the dimer ZnPc 1 and a fluorene-mediated linker in dimer ZnPc 3 contributes to the charge extraction and carrier mobility and enhancement in Jsc. The PSC statistics with ZnPcs including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are presented (Fig. S7 a–d, ESI†).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD and dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 were recorded (Fig. 5e). The IPCE spectra display a broad response from 300 to 800 nm, showing a plateau between 400 and 700 nm with a value of >80% for Spiro-OMeTAD and with Pc dimers ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3; however, ZnPc 2 showed a lower IPCE response, correlating with J–V measurements.
We further fabricated n-i-p type PSCs to evaluate the performances of undoped ZnPc dimers (ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3) and doped Spiro-OMeTAD as a control. The PV parameters for undoped ZnPc dimers are illustrated in Table 2 and the statistical device performance is depicted (Fig. S8, ESI†). Arguably, doped Spiro-OMeTAD showed higher performance than the undoped ZnPc dimers (Fig. 5f), and notably, the undoped ZnPc dimers with ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3 yielded a PCE of 14.71% and 14.03%, respectively, and that of ZnPc 2 was 11.17%. The ZnPc dimers also showed competitive performance in their pristine form i.e., undoped state, and by further optimization and design-principle rule, it can outperform doped Spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs. Expectedly, in the doped state, we noted an increase in the PCE values as compared to its undoped state. We hypothesized that the improved PV performances of the doped HTMs could be due to the higher carrier concentration, and lowering of the valence band (VB) of the ZnPc dimers that aligns with the valence band of the perovskite layer and improves the charge carrier extraction. The steady-state power output of PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 is investigated to verify the J value at the maximum power point. We noted that the Pcs exhibited stabilized current during the 300 s time exposure (Fig. 5g). Additionally, we probed PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc 3 for operational stability through the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the un-encapsulated PSCs under ambient conditions and to nearly under 1 sun illumination for ∼95 h, at a relative humidity of 50–60% at 800 mV (Fig. 5h). The Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC showed lower stability and retained nearly 32% of its initial J value, while the PSCs based on ZnPc 3 performed better and displayed a nearly linear response, retaining around >80% of its initial J value after >90 h. We evaluated the storage stability of the PSCs, and the ZnPc dimers showed improved stability when the PCE was measured periodically (PSCs stored in a dry box) for a month. The normalized PCE of the unencapsulated PSCs with the ZnPc dimers in comparison to Spiro-OMeTAD is displayed (Fig. 6a).
 Fig. 6  (a) Device stability of PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 under ambient moisture conditions and under dark conditions, and (b) Nyquist plots for the Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 measured with an applied voltage of 950 mV under dark conditions. 
Noticeably, both ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3 showed higher stability and retained the initial PCE after >300 h. ZnPc 2 also showed comparable performance to ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 3, retaining almost 80% of the initial PCE. In contrast, the Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC showed a decrease in its initial PCE to about 70% and degrades rapidly compared to the ZnPc dimers (visual examination). This suggests that the surface properties induced by the ZnPc dimers favorably prolong the PSC lifetime, which is also evidenced by the higher contact angle values, and act as an effective shield for the perovskite layer against moisture.
We carried out Mott–Schottky analysis of the PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 (Fig. S9, ESI†). The extracted built-in-potentials (Vbis) of Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 are 1031 mV, 833 mV, 1014 mV, and 914 mV, respectively,2 following the Voc trend. We noted increased recombination resistance for the ZnPc 3 based PSC as compared to ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and Spiro-OMeTAD by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement37 made under dark conditions (Fig. 6b). The equivalent circuit used is depicted in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The Rrecom values of Spiro-OMeTAD, ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3 based PSCs were calculated to be 1306 Ω, 981.1 Ω, 634.2 Ω and 1679 Ω, respectively. The EIS studies suggest that the improved interfacial charge extraction, maximum obtained for ZnPc 3, subsequently impacts the performance of the PSCs, resulting in lower charge recombination at the perovskite/hole selective layer interfaces.
3. Experimental
Materials
Lead iodide (99.9%) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) and employed as such. Lead bromide was procured from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylammonium bromide (MABr) was purchased from Dyesol. Solvents such as dimethylsufoxide (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), isopropanol (IPA), ethanol, and chlorobenzene were purchased from Acros and used as such.
Phthalocyanine synthesis
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Merck) and TCI and were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Zinc 2-iodo-6,16,23-tri-tert-butyl-phthalocyaninate was synthesized as described in the literature.33 Column chromatography was performed with SiO2 (40–63 μm). ZnPc-t-DPP-t-ZnPc 128 and ZnPc-t-t-ZnPc 230 were prepared using the methodology described already.

1H NMR data were obtained with a Bruker AC300 with chemical shifts referenced to residual TMS at 25 °C. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Microflex LRF20 instrument using dithranol as a matrix. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate tetrahydrofuran solution as a support electrolyte, a graphite working electrode, an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, and a platinum counter electrode using a potentiostat/galvanostat μAutolab Type III. The ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard for all measurements, and 4.8 eV under vacuum was established as the reference level. The HOMO and LUMO levels were estimated using the onset values of reduction and oxidation potentials. UV-Vis spectra were recorded with a Helios Gamma spectrophotometer and the extinction coefficients were calculated using the Lambert–Beer Law. IR spectra were recorded in a KBr matrix with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 3 FT-IR/NIR/FIR spectrophotometer.
Synthesis of ZnPc 1
Pd2(dba)3 (19.6 mg, 0.0214 mmol), CuI (15 mg, 0.0787 mmol) and PPh3 (45 mg, 0.171 mmol) were mixed in a 25 mL flask under an inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, two separate solutions of ethynylZnPc 6 (55 mg, 0.0714 mmol) and Br2DPP 7 (13.5 mg, 0.02856 mmol) in THF (10 mL) were prepared and degasified in two different flasks. Then the Br2DPP solution, Et3N (5 mL) and the ethynylZnPc solution were added to the reaction flask in this order. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and allowed to stir in darkness for 24 hours. The crude was washed with 1 M HCl solution and brine and extracted with DCM. The purification was carried out in a chromatography column with DCM/MeOH 100:1 as the eluent affording 18 mg (8%) of a dark green powder. 1H-NMR: (300 MHz, THF-d8, 25 °C): δ = 9.77–7.89 (m, 28H), 4.60–4.32 (m, 4H), 2.15–1.83 (m, 54H), 1.69–1.59 (m, 16H), 1.19 (s, 12H) ppm.

Route 1. 
Pd2(dba)3 (19.6 mg, 0.0214 mmol), CuI (15 mg, 0.0787 mmol) and PPh3 (45 mg, 0.171 mmol) were mixed in a 25 mL flask under an inert atmosphere. Meanwhile two separate solutions of ethynylZnPc 6 (55 mg, 0.0714 mmol) and 2,7-dibromo-9,9′-spiro[9H-fluorene] (8) (13.5 mg, 0.02856 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) were prepared and degasified in two different flasks. Then the solution that contained the spiro, Et3N (5 mL), and ZnPc solution were added to the reaction flask in this order. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and allowed to stir in darkness for 24 hours. The crude product was washed with 1 M HCl and brine and extracted with DCM. The purification was carried out in a chromatography column with hexane/THF 1:1 as an eluent affording 8 mg (15%) of a green powder.

Zinc 2-iodo-6,16,23-tri-tert-butyl-phthalocyaninate (4) (35 mg, 0.04 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (2.8 mg, 4 × 10−3 mmol) and CuI (0.4 mg, 2 × 10−3 mmol) were dissolved in freshly distilled Et3N (0.8 mL) and 0.2 mL of dry THF under an inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, a separate solution of 2′,7′-diethynyl-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] (9) (29.2 mg, 0.04 mmol) in dry and degasified THF (1 mL) was prepared. The latter solution was added to the former one in two equal portions, leaving 2 h between each addition. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h.

Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (TEC 7) was used as a substrate and was cleaned in sequence before use. Ultrasonication (2% Hellmanex water solution for 30 minutes) followed by rinsing with deionized water, acetone, and then isopropanol (IPA) was used and finally, the substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 30 minutes for the removal of organic residue on the surface. A TiO2 compact layer was deposited on this substrate by spray pyrolysis at 500 °C using a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol (1:19), and the substrates were annealed at 500 °C for a further 30 minutes and allowed to cool down. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on top of this through a spin coating process (30 s at 4000 rpm), and for this, TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) was diluted to 1:8 in ethanol. The TiO2 coated substrates were annealed first at 125 °C, followed by 500 °C using a programmable ramp during four-step heating, and were finally maintained at 500 °C for 30 min to acquire the anatase phase. On attaining room temperature, the substrates were treated under UV-ozone for 30 minutes and transferred to an argon-filled glove-box for perovskite layer deposition. The precursor solution for preparing the mixed perovskite (MAPbBr3)0.15(FAPbI3)0.85 was prepared by dissolving FAI (1 M), PbI2 (1.2 M), MABr (0.2 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in anhydrous DMF: DMSO 4:1 (v:v). The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step sequence at 1000 and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively. During the second step, 110 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped as an antisolvent approach on the substrate 5 s before the end of the spinning process. The perovskite-coated substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 1 h in a glovebox. On reaching room temperature, Spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM) and ZnPc dimers (ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3, 15 mM each) as hole selective layers were deposited by dissolving in chlorobenzene. Spiro-OMeTAD and ZnPc dimers were doped by adding bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) in molar ratios of 0.5 and 3.3, respectively. 40 μL of HTM solutions were spin-coated atop the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s in an argon-filled glove box. The device fabrication was completed by evaporating an Au layer of 70 nm as a cathode under a low vacuum (10−6 torr). All solutions were prepared inside an argon-filled glove box with controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (O2 < 10 ppm, H2O < 2 ppm).
Thin-film characterization
The thin films were prepared on a quartz substrate by spin coating for optical characterization, (MAPbBr3)0.15(FAPbI3)0.85 with the same concentrations of HTLs employed in PSCs used. X-Ray diffractograms were recorded using a D8 Advance diffractometer from Bruker (Bragg–Bretanto geometry, with an X-ray tube Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 angstrom). A scan of 5–10° was selected with an acquisition time of 1° min−1. The absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis-IR spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis spectrophotometer). Photoluminescence (PL) steady-state measurements were recorded with a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Instrument LS55).
Device characterization
The device photovoltaic parameters were measured by utilizing current density–voltage (J–V) curves, registered with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm2 illumination from a 450 W AAA solar simulator (ORIEL, 94023 A). An NREL certified monocrystalline silicon solar cell was used for calibration. A black metal mask (0.09 cm2) was used over the active area to reduce the influence of scattered light. The devices were measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and a pre-sweep delay of 10 s. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out using a 150 W xenon lamp attached to a Bentham PVE300 motorized 1/4m monochromator as the light source.
4. Conclusions
The position of diethynyl π-conjugated linkers on phthalocyanine rings was tuned to synthesize different ZnPc dimers (ZnPc 1, ZnPc 2, and ZnPc 3). Amendment of the phthalocyanine dimers with triple bonds and the π-linkers in ZnPc dimers leads to co-planarity in the molecular structure of the core, resulting in competing enhancements of charge extraction and carrier mobility at the perovskite/phthalocyanine interface. Suggested by the investigation of the impact of the substituent groups in the ZnPc dimers on the hole transport capability and microstructure in thin films, the fabricated perovskite solar cells with the dimer ZnPc 3 surpasses the performance of Spiro-OMeTAD. The reported performance supersedes previous reports for both ZnPc-based and phthalocyanine-dimer-based hole selective layers in PSCs. Notably, a very thin layer is used which in turn will consume low materials and reduce the cost. Using impedance spectroscopy, we quantified the performance of the dimers and noted reduced non-radiative recombination at the interface and improved charge transfer kinetics. The ZnPc dimers are shown to be hydrophobic and protect the perovskite layer, thereby contributing to enhancing the PSC stability.
