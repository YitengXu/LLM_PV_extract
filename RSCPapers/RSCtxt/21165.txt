    , Accepted 3rd February 2018First published on 5th February 2018AbstractCurrently the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells is still lower than that of normal structured devices, due to the imperfect band alignment between the perovskite and hole transport layer (NiO). Herein, we found that the presence of oxygen during film preparation could lower the Fermi level of NiO and decrease the energy mismatch between the perovskite and NiO. The decreased mismatch benefited the VOC of the devices as well as the charge transfer between NiO and the perovskite. In addition, the utilization of Cs–MA–FA mixed ion-based perovskites as absorbers could increase the light response range and improve the thermal and moisture stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Finally, we achieved a stable performance output of 19.2% for inverted planar perovskite solar cells without any hysteresis.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have emerged as a strong rival for next generation thin film technology. The efficiency rapidly increased from 3.9% in 2009 to the current 22.7%, benefiting from several key advantages of perovskites, including high optical absorption, defect tolerance nature, long carrier diffusion lengths, etc.1–4
Planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including normal structure (n–i–p) and inverted structure (p–i–n), have attracted a lot of attention due to their simple device structure, decreased heterojunction interface, and thus reduced leakage channels.5,6 Normal structured PSCs usually show high efficiency, but were typically troubled with the hysteresis effect, resulting in unreliable power conversion efficiency.7,8 In addition, the hygroscopicity and low glass transition temperature (125 °C) of spiro-OMeTAD, the commonly used hole-transport material, inevitably hinders the moisture and thermal stabilities of the device.9,10
Inverted structure PSCs, in contrast, show negligible hysteresis and good stability, benefiting from the use of fullerene derivatives to passivate perovskites.11,12 However, due to the inferior perovskite crystallinity and the imperfect band alignment between the perovskite and hole transport layer, the performance of inverted PSCs was still lower than normal PSCs in most of the reported studies.13–15
Perovskite crystallization and film formation could be addressed by solvent engineering, solvent annealing, or additive treatment.16,17 The pendent problem is to solve the imperfect interfacial band alignment and carrier extraction ability between perovskite and hole (electron) transport layers. Nickel oxide has been widely used as the hole transport layer in inverted PSCs.18,19 However, the offset between the valence band of NiO and that of perovskite ranges from 0.15 to 0.4 eV.20,21 It is a prerequisite to rationally lower the valence band (VB) level of NiO as close as possible to that of the perovskite, for high voltages and efficient hole extractions. As a p-type semiconductor, NiO usually has an oxygen excess accommodated by nickel vacancies.22 Therefore the content of oxygen in the film would theoretically affect the band level of NiO and the performance of inverted devices. However, there is still no report about the influence of oxygen content in NiO on perovskite solar cells.
Herein, we found that the presence of oxygen during film preparation could lower the Fermi level of NiO and decrease the energy mismatch between the perovskite and NiO. The underlying mechanism is that oxygen vacancies would lift the Fermi level, and thus suppressing oxygen vacancies is necessary to ensure the appropriate Fermi level and VB of NiO. The decreased mismatch benefited the VOC of the devices as well as the charge transfer between NiO and the perovskite. In addition, we utilized Cs–MA–FA mixed ions as absorbers to increase the light response range and improve the thermal and moisture stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Finally, we achieved a stable performance output of 19.2% for inverted planar perovskite solar cells without any hysteresis, which is among the highest efficiencies for inverted perovskite solar cells.23,24
Discussion
In this work, we adopted Mg and Li doped NiO (NiMgLiO) as hole transport layers, since previous studies show that Li doping is effective to improve the p-conductivity and Mg doping is to compensate the undesirable positive shift of the VB level.13 During the fabrication of perovskite films, we spin coated perovskite precursors onto NiMgLiO films in different atmospheres (nitrogen or dry air). The devices in different atmospheres exhibited remarkable differences especially in terms of open-circuit voltage. In order to exclude the influence of atmosphere on the perovskite films, we tracked the transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite on glass prepared under different atmospheres, as shown in Fig. S1.† As shown in the transient PL spectra, the perovskite film (MAPbI3) exhibited two components, with the shorter one attributed to the surface recombination, while the longer one is from recombination in the bulk.25 By averaging the two parts, we obtained the lifetimes of 12.9 and 11.45 ns after annealing in dry air and nitrogen, respectively, indicating similar trap densities for these two films. In addition, the UV-vis absorption illustrated the same absorption edges, evidencing the same electronic structure. Thereby, we thought the influence of atmosphere on the perovskite is negligible.
Based on the above results, we turned to studying the impact of atmosphere on NiMgLiO films. As shown in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ni 2p3/2 (Fig. 1a), there were four curves that fit well with the experimental results. The peaks at 853.6 and 855.3 eV were from Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively, while the peaks at higher binding energy (860.6 and 864.8 eV) were from the satellite peaks for Ni2+ and Ni3+. We can obtain the compositional ratio of Ni3+ to Ni2+ by integrating the representing area for Ni3+ and Ni2+. It could be seen that in the presence of dry air, the content of Ni3+ could be significantly increased. The Tauc plot, which was derived from the UV-vis absorption spectra, was used to obtain band gap information.26 As shown in Fig. 1b, both the samples annealed in nitrogen and dry air showed a direct band gap of 3.66 eV. Then we measured ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) for the two films. The distance from the valence band to the Fermi level is the same (0.4 eV), indicating the p-type property of NiMgLiO. There are some differences of the Fermi level for these two films, with the EF for samples in dry air being 4.75 eV and EF for those in nitrogen being 4.6 eV (Fig. 1e). As a result, for the sample prepared in dry air, the distance between the valence band of NiMgLiO and perovskite is smaller, which would be beneficial for the charge transfer. The transient PL spectra were used to verify the charge transfer rate, as shown in Fig. 1f. For both the samples, the lifetime of the perovskite was much shorter than that on the glass substrate, which was due to the hole transfer between the perovskite and NiMgLiO and the thus decreased radiation recombination. The spectra also showed two components of lifetime. The average lifetime for the sample prepared in dry air is shorter (2.2 ns) than that in nitrogen (3.1 ns), indicating the more effective charge transfer between NiMgLiO and MAPbI3.27

Then we studied the electrical properties of the films and devices. As shown in Fig. 2a, capacitance versus voltage Mott–Schottky analysis was conducted to study the built-in potential between NiMgLiO and the perovskite.28 The device structure is shown in the inset. As documented in previous references, gold and perovskite could form a good ohmic contact. A PN junction forms between p-type NiMgLiO and the n-type perovskite.

At low bias, C−2 tends to reach a steady state related to the geometric capacitance which has become fully depleted of the majority carrier and can be viewed as a classical dielectric. The linear region at high forward bias can be fitted to a plot of C−2versus bias voltage (C−2 = (2/qεN)(VBI − V)). Extrapolation of the linear fit line to the intercept on the bias axis directly yields VBI for the device. Once VBI has been obtained, the depletion width w = (2εVBI/qN)1/2 corresponding to zero applied bias can be extracted. The dielectric constant of the perovskite was determined to be 49 from the low bias region (Fig. S3†). The built-in potential was 0.932 V and 0.850 V for devices prepared in air and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively. Such enhancement is consistent with the negative shift of the VB level for NiMgLiO through annealing in air. The depletion width in the perovskite was calculated to be 82 nm (air) and 81 nm (N2), echoing previous studies.
SCLC studies demonstrate that perovskite film prepared in air has a slightly lower trap density (3.08 × 1015 cm−3) than that prepared in nitrogen (4.41 × 1015 cm−3), which may be due to the oxygen coordination effect for under-coordinated Pb atoms. Such a slight change of trap density could not affect the band structures of the perovskite. Finally, we fabricated MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells to verify the influence of the band shift of the NiMgLiO layer. The devices prepared under different conditions showed similar photocurrents and fill factors but remarkably different VOC. The average VOC from 12 devices shows a strong correlation with the working conditions, with dry air producing a VOC of 1.07 V and nitrogen producing 0.98 V. The enhancement (0.09 V) is in agreement with the increment (0.082 V) of VBI derived from Mott–Schottky analysis. The slightly wider VOC range for the nitrogen atmosphere may come from the different degrees of oxygen vacancies formed during film fabrications. Thereby, the role of oxygen during perovskite preparation has been well resolved.
Then we also extended such a method to formamidinium (FA)-based perovskite solar cells, which has been acknowledged by their broader light absorption and high efficiencies of over 20% on normal structured devices.29 Here we used Cs0.05FAxMA0.95−xPbI3 as the absorbers, where the amount of FA and MA was determined through N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. S4†). The presence of Cs is beneficial for the stabilization of the black α-phase FA perovskite. As FA content increased, the band gap can be decreased from 1.60 eV to 1.55 eV, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. However, when the FA content is higher than 25%, there was protuberance in the film (Fig. 3f), which was probably from the existence of a yellow δ-phase FA perovskite.30 Then we chose Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 as the suitable absorber. It should be noted that the existence of Cs and FA molecules also helps the thermal stability of the film. As shown in Fig. 3d, there were obvious pinholes in the MAPbI3 film, which was from the thermal degradation of MA molecules. In contrast, there was no pinhole in perovskite film with Cs and FA doping. The average grain size of the MAPbI3 film is 244 ± 93 nm and that of Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 is 227 ± 82 nm. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. 3c), we also found the presence of PbI2 in the film, which could help the suppression of trap states in perovskites.

We compared the device performance from Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 to MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 4a. The hysteresis effect is negligible in the assembled solar cells (FTO/NiMgLiO/perovskite/PCBM/Ag). Because of the broader light absorption, Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 exhibited a higher photocurrent of 22.53 mA cm−2 from the reverse scan, compared to MAPbI3 (21.75 mA cm−2). Also, the fill factor of the Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 device (0.79) is also higher than that of MAPbI3 (0.75). Such a change was caused by the better thermal stability of Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 and thus suppressed pinholes after thermal annealing. Statistic summaries for devices from different batches show a similar trend (Fig. 4e and S5†).

The stabilized power output (SPO) is generally used to characterize the device stability towards an electrical field by measuring the power output over time until reaching a steady value.31 As shown in Fig. 4c and d, Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 exhibited a SPO power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.15% and a photocurrent of 21.04 mA cm−2, while MAPbI3 exhibited a PCE of 17.14% and a photocurrent of 19.96 mA cm−2. We could clearly see the response of each device from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4b). The integrated photocurrents were also consistent with the measured steady photocurrents. As shown in Fig. 4f, the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 film exhibited a clear planar structure, constructed with a thin layer of NiMgLiO and a 530 nm thick perovskite layer.
Finally, we studied the moisture and thermal stability of the assembled perovskite solar cells, as shown in Fig. 5. For moisture stability, we stored the device outside under dark conditions, with a humidity of ∼55% and temperature of 25 °C. For MAPbI3. The device performance degraded to 30% after 15 days. In contrast, there was almost no change for the Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 device. The data were averaged from 8 devices. For thermal stability, we chose two devices and continuously tracked their stabilized PCE after a certain period of thermal treatment (85 °C, humidity ∼25%, and unencapsulated). It was found that MAPbI3 degraded very quickly to less than 60% of its initial value within 250 minutes. However, the Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 device can retain above 90% of its original performance after the same durability test. Such good stability was due to the entropic gains from A-site mixing and the intrinsic high decomposition temperature of FA and Cs-based perovskites.29,32 It should be noted that there was a slight efficiency increase for both of these two devices around 25–50 min, which may come from the improved contact between perovskites and electron transport layers (PCBM).

Conclusions
Overall, we revealed the influence of oxygen on nickel oxide film and as-fabricated perovskite solar cells. The presence of oxygen during film formation could suppress the formation of oxygen vacancies and the lift of the Fermi levels. Thereby the charge transfer between nickel oxide and the perovskite, as well as the offset between the VB of nickel oxide and the perovskite, could be greatly improved. Such changes then finally enable the high open voltage of the fabricated perovskite solar cells. In addition, by utilizing FA–MA–Cs mixed perovskites, the light response range of the devices could be widened, and the thermal and moisture stabilities were also significantly enhanced. This work presents a simple strategy and also highlights the importance of band engineering for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
Experimental details
Band gap calculations
For band gap calculations, we firstly obtained the film absorption spectra with a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer in diffusion reflectance mode. Then, the Tauc plot was used to derive band gap values. Since perovskites have direct allowed transitions, we used the following equations for calculation:(αhν)2 ∝ hν − Egwhere α is the absorption coefficient, which is derived from the absorption spectra; h is Planck's constant, ν is the light frequency, and Eg is the band gap. The Tauc plot has a distinct linear regime which denotes the onset of absorption. Then extrapolating this linear region to the abscissa yields the optical band gap.
Solar cell fabrications
The clean FTO glasses were used as the substrate for NiMgLiO deposition. The precursor for NiMgLiO was prepared according to the previous reference.13 In brief, 822.1 mg nickel acetylacetonate, 128.4 mg magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 13.2 mg lithium acetate were dissolved in 200 mL of acetonitrile/ethanol (volume ratio of 95:5) solutions. The film was fabricated by spray coating with FTO as the substrate at 500 °C. 30 mL of the above solutions was sprayed using a home-made spray device, with one cycle for 5 seconds (2 seconds for spray, 3 seconds for waiting) and 70 cycles in total. After another 20 min annealing at 500 °C in air, the NiO film was fabricated.
MAPbI3 perovskite films were fabricated through the following method. Firstly, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 and MAI in a mixed solvent (γ-butyrolactone:DMSO = 7:3 vol%), with the concentration set to 0.96 M. Then the solutions were coated onto the NiMgLiO film by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1500 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 0.3 mL chlorobenzene was poured onto the substrate. Then the film was annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. Cs0.05FA0.15MA0.8PbI3 films were fabricated using a mixture of CsI, FAI, MAI, and PbI2 in an ideal ratio as the mixed solvent. The concentration was optimized to be 1.2 M. Then the films were annealed at 90 °C for 10 min.
Then 15 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution of PCBM was spin-coated onto the perovskite at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by spin-coating of isopropanol solution with saturated BCP at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 120 nm Ag electrode was thermally evaporated on top of the device under high vacuum (<10−4 Pa). The active area of the device was 0.16 cm2 with a mask of 0.09 cm2.
