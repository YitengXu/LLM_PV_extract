    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 5th January 2017AbstractA PTB7-based cationic narrow band-gap polyelectrolyte, named PTB7-NBr, has been designed and synthesized as a cathode interfacial material for polymer solar cells. PTB7-NBr exhibits excellent cathode interfacial modification in solar cells with PTB7 and PTB7-Th as donor polymer and a high PCE of 9.24% was achieved.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most attractive and widely studied technologies in photovoltaic cells; this is mainly because they are flexible, lightweight, versatile and readily fabricated using solution processes.1–3 To elevate the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, many narrow band gap conjugated polymers (NBGCPs) have been developed as donor materials.4–7 NBGCPs could match the solar optical spectrum better, which is essential for high efficiency PSCs with large short-current densities (Jsc).8 Among NBGCPs, poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7) and its derivatives, which are based on the copolymerization of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene units, are among the most well-known species.9–14 These polymers exhibit low band gaps of about 1.6 eV with relatively low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and good hole mobility. All these properties endow PTB7-based NBGCPs with excellent photovoltaic behaviors.
In addition to exploiting new photoactive materials, developing interfacial materials is another efficient method to improve the PCE of PSCs.15–17 Due to their orthogonal solvent processability and work function modifications of electrodes, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are widely used in cathode interlayers (CILs) for PSCs.18–20 Although highly efficient PSCs with CPEs as CILs have been achieved, few categories of backbones have been reported.21–23 Most CPE backbones are derived from polyfluorenes.13,24–36 For example, PFN was developed by Cao's group and was applied in an inverted PSC to obtain a high PCE of 9.2%.13 Very recently, a bifunctional interlayer material, PFS, was developed by Hou's group.37 Interestingly, PFS can function both as cathode and anode interlayers in PSCs; a PCE of 9.48% was achieved for these devices. Also, Zhang et al. first reported a PTB7-based self-assembled CIL for PSCs; the PCE increased from 4.3% to 7.1%.38
Combining the virtues of NBGCPs and CPEs prompted us to develop new CILs named narrow band-gap conjugated polyelectrolytes (NBGCPEs).39–41 Several groups have reported limited research on NBGCPEs in PSCs as interfacial materials.22,42,43 In 2013, Bazan, Heeger et al. reported an anionic NBGCPE with a backbone containing alternating donor/acceptor units. Due to self-doping, the anionic NBGCPE was found to be a good anode interfacial modification both in PSCs and organic small molecular solar cells.43 Strangely, their previous research indicated that cationic NBGCPEs with the same backbones as anionic NBGCPEs were n-type semiconductors.40 In 2015, Chen's group also reported a NBGCPE based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) backbone.22 The good electron mobility of the DPP-based NBGCPE endowed the inverted device with low sensitivity to the thickness of the CIL. However, the PCE (8.0%) requires further improvement. In a word, research regarding NBGCPEs is very limited, and their application in PSCs remains to be explored.
In this communication, we designed and synthesized a novel NBGCPE, named PTB7-NBr (Scheme 1), with the same backbone as PTB7. PTB7-NBr possesses cationic quaternary ammonium pendants with a conjugated D–A type backbone. Although PTB7-NBr exhibits similar UV-vis absorption spectra to its neutral derivative, PTB7, its energy levels and solubility are different because of the cationic pendants. More importantly, PTB7-NBr is demonstrated to be an excellent cathode modification for PTB7 and poly[4,8-bis((5-ethylhexyl)thienyl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) devices; a maximum PCE of 9.24% was achieved. As far as we know, this is the first report of PSCs with NBGCPE CIL and donor materials possessing the same backbones. The narrow band-gap CIL could form a fine film because of its similar structure to the photoactive materials, thus inducing remarkable performance.
 Scheme 1  The device architecture and chemical structures of the cathode material and donor materials. 
The NBGCPE PTB7-NBr was synthesized by a post-functionalization route, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The neutral precursor polymer PTB7-N was synthesized according to the synthetic method of PTB7,44 which involves copolymerizing thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomer and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene monomer by Stille coupling. Somewhat unusually, the alkoxy residues of the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomer were replaced by tertiary amine substituents. Quaternization of PTB-N by bromoethane afforded the cationic polymer PTB7-NBr in high yield. PTB7-N is soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran, while PTB7-NBr is soluble in polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, methanol and water.
Prior to the device fabrication, the band gap and energy levels of PTB7-NBr were first investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 1a, PTB7-NBr exhibited an intense absorption from 400 to 700 nm both in solution and in film; this is similar to the well-known donor polymer, PTB7.9 Although the band gaps of PTB7-NBr and PTB7 are similar, their HOMO levels vary greatly. It is obvious from the CV spectra shown in Fig. 1b that PTB7-NBr was oxidized more easily, with a higher HOMO level of −5.12 eV, than PTB7, which has a HOMO level of −5.35 eV. Because PTB7-NBr and PTB-7 possess the same backbone, the higher HOMO level of PTB7-NBr should be ascribed to the ionic side chains. Other studies have proved that ions of conjugated polyelectrolytes can dope the backbones of other organic molecules;41,45 therefore, we deduced that doping with bromide could be the reason for the higher HOMO level of PTB7-NBr compared to PTB7. The lower oxidation potential of the PTB7 + HTAB film, which is similar to the PTB7-NBr film, further suggested that the higher HOMO level of PTB7-NBr compared to PTB7 can be ascribed to bromide doping in the side chain.

In general, cationic CPEs are used in CILs; thus, we then fabricated conventional architecture devices with PTB7-NBr as the CIL. First, we employed PTB7 as a donor material, with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/CIL/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the conventional devices with various thicknesses of PTB7-NBr are shown in Fig. 2a. The PTB7-NBr films were deposited from methanol solution, and the thickness of PTB7-NBr was determined by both the profilometer and absorption spectra results (Fig. S1, ESI†). The device with a 3 nm-thick layer of PTB7-NBr exhibited the best performance. Literature studies have revealed that alcohol can effectively remove residual additives and improve device performance.46 In order to investigate the interfacial modification of PTB7-NBr and rule out the influence of solvent, devices without solvent treatment and with solvent treatment alone were also fabricated to carry out a contrastive analysis with the PTB7-NBr device. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the devices fabricated without solvent treatment and with methanol treatment both exhibited poor performance, although the device fabricated with methanol treatment had a slightly higher PCE. After depositing 3 nm of PTB7-NBr, the device exhibited excellent performance, with a PCE of 8.00%, a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 16.21 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.66%. It is obvious that the insertion of PTB7-NBr induced a comprehensive improvement in the performance of the device. This indicated that the NBGCPE PTB7-NBr is an excellent CIL material for PSCs with PTB7 donor systems; therefore, the development of CIL materials with the same backbone as the donor materials is feasible.

To further enhance the performance of PSCs with PTB7-NBr as the CIL and to investigate its general application in other photoactive layer systems, we also fabricated devices with PTB7-Th as the donor material and PTB7-NBr as the CIL. Compared to PTB7, PTB7-Th has a similar backbone but different side chains. PTB7-Th, which has a two-dimensional conjugated side chain, induced greatly improved photovoltaic properties.47 As shown in Fig. 2c and Table 1, the device with PTB7-Th:PC71BM as the photoactive layer and PTB7-NBr as the CIL exhibited outstanding performance, with a PCE of 9.24%, a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 16.49 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.37%. Also, we compared the performances of devices with PTB7-NBr as the CIL fabricated with and without solvent treatment. For the PTB7-Th device, we chose CF3CH2OH as the solvent to dissolve PTB7-NBr because of its better wetting properties and device performance (Table S1, ESI†). Once again, compared to the device with only solvent (CF3CH2OH) treatment and without CIL, the device with PTB7-NBr as the CIL exhibited simultaneous enhancement in all device parameters. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PTB7-NBr device and CF3CH2OH are presented in Fig. 2d. The EQE values of the PTB7-NBr device are all higher than those of the CF3CH2OH device, which corresponds to the higher Jsc of the PTB7-NBr device. The device performance with device stability and larger size were also investigated (Table S2 and Fig. S4, ESI†). After being stored in a glove box for about five days, the PTB7-NBr device maintained about 90% of its original PCE. With an active area of 1 × 1 cm2, the PTB7-NBr device exhibited an optimal PCE of 6.49%.
The remarkable performance of the PTB7-NBr devices indicated that PTB7-NBr is a suitable cathode interfacial modification. To further clarify its functions, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was first used to measure the work functions of the cathode electrode (Al) with and without PTB7-NBr (Fig. 3a). For the bare Al cathode, the work function calculated from the secondary electron cutoff region was 4.38 eV, which is consistent with the literature.48 After spin-coating a thin layer of PTB7-NBr, the work function of Al decreased to 3.38 eV. The lower work function of Al with PTB7-NBr agreed well with the increased Voc of the PTB7-NBr devices. The lower work function of Al with PTB7-NBr implied the presence of an interfacial dipole upon incorporation of the PTB7-NBr interlayer.49 According to the literature, an interfacial dipole between the photoactive layer and the cathode would result in more efficient electron extraction from the photoactive layer to the cathode.48–50

Electron-only devices with a ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/CIL/Al structure were then fabricated to evaluate the influence of PTB7-NBr on the electron transport of the devices. The J–V curves were measured by the space charge limited current model (SCLC) according to the Mott-Gurney equation.51 As shown in Fig. 3b, the apparent electron mobility was determined to be 2.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CF3CH2OH-treated device and 6.84 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the device without solvent treatment. Although the solvent treatment also enhanced the apparent electron mobility, with a thin layer of PTB7-NBr as the CIL, the apparent electron mobility was further enhanced to 6.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 3 times greater than that of the CF3CH2OH-treated device. This higher electron mobility contributed to the increased Jsc and FF of the PTB7-NBr device.
Finally, the morphology of the photoactive layer with and without PTB7-NBr was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). By simply spin-coating the solvent, the photoactive layer exhibited a smooth and homogenous nanostructure (Fig. S5, ESI†). The deposition of PTB7-NBr on the photoactive layer also resulted in a homogenous nanostructure; however, the surface was smoother. In the PTB7:PC71BM devices, the roughness root mean squares (RMSs) decreased from 1.60 nm to 1.54 nm; in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM devices, the RMSs decreased from 2.18 nm to 1.76 nm. The smoother surface of the photoactive layer with a thin layer of PTB7-NBr can be ascribed to two factors: first, PTB7-NBr is a polymeric material, which usually possess good film-forming-properties. Second, PTB7-NBr has a similar structure (same backbone as PTB7 and PTB7-Th) to the donor materials, which endows PTB7-NBr with perfect adhesion on the photoactive layer without accumulation. A smooth and uniform CIL film on the photoactive layer can enhance charge transfer and reduce charge recombination at the interface. The fine morphology of PTB7-NBr CIL on the photoactive layer suggested that narrow band-gap CILs with the same backbone as the donor polymer could be beneficial to the compatibility of the CIL and the photoactive layer.
In summary, a novel PTB7-based NBGCPE, PTB7-NBr, was synthesized and applied in PSCs as a cathode interlayer. PTB7-NBr was found to provide excellent cathode interfacial modifications on photoactive layers with PTB7 or PTB7-Th as the donor material. PTB7-NBr can remarkably reduce the work function of the cathode and enhance electron transport across the device, resulting in simultaneous enhancement of the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the device. Also, the good film-forming property of PTB7-NBr facilitates charge transfer across the CIL to the electrode. The device with PTB7-Th as the donor material and PTB7-NBr as the CIL exhibited an optimal PCE of 9.24%. This is the first report of PSCs with NBGCPE CILs possessing the same backbone as the narrow band-gap donor polymer. More importantly, devices with NBGCPE CILs on different donor polymer systems but with the same backbone as the donor polymers presented good performance. These results demonstrate that the development of NBGCPEs with the same backbone as the donor materials is a smart strategy for cathode interfacial materials.
