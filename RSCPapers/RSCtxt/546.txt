1. Introduction
Heterogeneous catalysis, generally known as a “foundation pillar” of green chemistry,1 plays a crucial role chemical industry. In view of global environmental pollution in the 21st century, solar-driven heterogeneous photocatalysis has received growing attention.2 Indeed, decades of research have been directed on heterogeneous photocatalysis that is becoming a promising technology toward energy production and environmental remediation. In this regard, the discovery and development of visible light-responsive photocatalysts is essential, taking into account that a substantial fraction (ca. 44%) of the whole solar spectrum is visible light. In recent years, considerable advances have been achieved in photocatalysts to degrade organic pollutants in aqueous media (e.g., azo dyes) and in air (e.g., VOCs), transform organics (e.g., selective oxidation of alcohols and selective reduction of nitrobenzenes), and generate hydrogen fuel by water splitting under ambient conditions. The powerful combination of heterogeneous photocatalysis and clean, abundant and renewable sunlight is not only a new thrust in solving energy and environmental problems, but one of ultimate goals for the sustainability of global development.3
Since Fujishima and Honda discovered photocatalytic splitting of water on titanium dioxide (TiO2) electrodes under ultraviolet light (UV) in 1972,4 tremendous endeavours have been made in solar-to-fuel conversion and environmental catalysis. As a prototype photocatalyst, TiO2 has received the greatest attention due to its strong photo oxidization power and excellent stability against photo- and chemical-corrosion.5 Nevertheless, TiO2 with an inherent band gap of 3.0–3.2 eV can only absorb UV, which accounts for a small fraction (ca. 4%) of the solar spectrum. One of approaches is to develop visible light-responsive alternatives, such as WO3,6 α-Fe2O3,7 CdS,8 CaIn2O4,9 BaBiO3,10 Bi2SbVO7,11 and graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts.12 However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs within these photocatalytic materials results in low photonic efficiency and thus limits their practical applications.2a,c,13 On the other hand, there have been modifications of TiO2 by doping metallic and non-metallic species,14 loading metal nanoparticles (NPs),5c,15 forming heterostructures,16 and tuning morphology.17 Particularly important is loading noble metal NPs (e.g., Au, Ag) in that these NPs can absorb visible light via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to enhance photocatalytic activity.2f,5b,15a,18 In simple terms, SPR is collective oscillations of conduction band electrons in a metal particle driven by the electromagnetic field of incident light.19 Significant progress has been made on the synthesis and assembly of plasmonic nanostructures.20 Such plasmonic nanostructures present unique physico-chemical properties that are useful in a range of applications such as biotechnology,21 near-field optics,22 catalytic sensors,23 solar cells,24 water splitting,25 single-molecule spectroscopy,26 surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,26b,27 among others. In plasmonic photocatalysis, noble metal NPs are often coupled with certain substrates that can offer relatively high surface area as well as active sites. As a result, noble metal NPs and the substrates work in a cooperative way to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Although extensive studies of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis on Au/TiO2 have been carried out, the generalizable mechanism responsible for surface plasmon resonance and associated photoreactivity is not rigorously established. Tatsuma and Tian28 proposed that in the case of Au/TiO2, excited photoelectrons on Au NPs by surface plasmon resonance can transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 and the photogenerated charge carriers were thus efficiently separated. In contrast, Cronin et al.29 reported that enhanced electric field induced by surface plasmon resonance rather than electron transfer plays a key role in photocatalysis. Zhu et al.18b suggested that plasmon resonance on Au NPs disturbs the electron occupancy of 6sp electrons and part of energetic electrons initiate radical formation and subsequent photocatalysis. Obviously, the role of surface plasmon resonance-mediated energetic electrons, charge separation, and the enhanced electromagnetic fields in photocatalysis is still a matter of debate.
In line with the scenario that many important findings have been reported on noble metal-based plasmonic photocatalysts during the past few years, we believe that a timely and comprehensive review on this subject can benefit further development in the area of plasmonic photocatalysis. Here, we exclusively focus on the most recent advances in the synthesis and photocatalytic properties of noble metal-based plasmonic composites under visible light. In this context, we intend to exclude discussing particular reactions controlled by either laser-induced plasmonic heating30 or electron transfer via interband transitions on noble metal NPs under UV.18b,31
2. Basic principles of surface plasmon resonance
Plasmon resonance induced by gold and silver colloids has been used to enhance the reflection of stained glass since the Middle Ages.32,33 Gustav Mie34 first established the well-known Mie's theory to solve Maxwell's equations relevant to optical absorption and scattering that has been a central theme in “plasmonics”. In plasmonics, nanostructured materials are employed to precisely manipulate and control light on nanoscale. Thus, plasmonics is inherently linked with nanoscience and nanotechnology. There are classical books35 and review articles20a,24a,32,33,36 that most comprehensively describe the fundamentals of SPR resulting from light–metal interactions. Herein we only provide a brief introduction that is closely relevant to supported or embedded noble metal NPs discussed in this review. When a spherical metal nanoparticle is illuminated by light with the wavelength much larger than the size of this particle, the charge density is redistributed. A coulombic restoring force is then established and the charge density coherently oscillates like a harmonic oscillator in phase with the incident light, called SPR (Fig. 1). SPR is also called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The resulting electric field highly confined in the proximity of the particle can be dramatically enhanced, up to 100–10000 times larger than that of the incident field.20b The extinction cross-section is the sum of absorption and scattering cross-sections and is an important parameter when characterizing SPR. Fig. 2 shows the extinction cross-section for various metal NPs with 10 nm in size. It is noted that Au and Ag NPs are capable of absorbing and scattering photons with a relative high excitation cross-section in the visible regime.36b In addition, these two metals are chemically inert in addition to processing a high charge carrier density.37 Thus, both Au and Ag NPs are frequently used as an essential part of plasmonic composites. In general, the resonance frequency is strongly influenced by the particle size, shape, interparticle interactions and local dielectric environment, among others.59Fig. 3 shows the change of resonance wavelength for suspended Ag nanocubes as a function of edge length.38 The centroid of resonance wavelength is significantly red-shifted when increasing the nanocube edge length from 36 to 172 nm. Quantitative analysis of dipole plasmon resonance, quadrupole plasmon resonance, extinction cross-sections and associated electromagnetic fields for spherical particles based on numerical methods is discussed in detail elsewhere.33,36c

3. Preparation of plasmonic photocatalysts
There are a diverse set of synthetic methods for preparation of plasmonic photocatalysts. Examples are deposition–precipitation (DP),15a,31f,39 photoreduction,40 ion-exchange,41 impregnation,30a,42 chemical reduction,31b,43 physical vapour deposition,29,44 hydrothermal,45 and encapsulation.31a,46 In general, to fabricate plasmonic photocatalysts, noble metal NPs and/or thin films are anchored on substrates such as metal oxides (e.g., TiO2,29,43c,46c N–TiO2,43a,43c Fe2O3, 46d–46f ZrO2,18b SiO2,18b CeO2,40d Al2O3,43b KNbO3 (ref. 15a)), zeolite Y,18b silver halides (e.g., AgCl,41c,42c AgBr,47 AgI39e), graphene oxide,39f,48 among others. Herein, the most frequently used approaches such as deposition–precipitation, photoreduction, ion-exchange, and encapsulation are discussed.
3.1. Deposition–precipitation
Among a variety of synthetic methods for preparing plasmonic photocatalysts coupled with Ag, Au and Ag–AgX (X = Cl, Br, I), the most frequently adapted one is deposition–precipitation, followed by washing and further reduction.15a,31f,39a–d In general, depositing noble metal NPs with relatively small size (e.g., less than 5 nm) and narrow size distribution onto support materials can be achieved via deposition–precipitation. The Au precursor often comes from aqueous solutions containing Au3+. The particle size and associated loading amount of noble metals can be tuned by changing the solution pH and calcination temperature etc.39a Moreover, pH value, concentration of HAuCl4 concentration and temperature determine the speciation of Au3+.5c For instance, when pH is larger than 4, AuCl4− hydrolysis occurs and forms gold complex [Au(OH)xCl4−x]−. With increasing pH, the hydrolysis of gold complex is accelerated. By adding the solutions like NaOH, NH3·H2O, Na2CO3 and urea etc., the pH is adjusted with respect to the isoelectric point of support materials. When the solution pH finally matches with the isoelectric point of the support, most noble NPs and hydroxyl groups can be deposited on the support surface. It is generally accepted that the gold species deposited on different supports varies and pH plays a key role in this process. Nevertheless, support materials with a relatively low isoelectric point such as SiO2, tungstate and active carbon are not ideal for loading noble metal NPs through deposition–precipitation. In a typical synthesis process, support materials with relatively high specific surface area and a precipitant are immersed into aqueous solutions, e.g., hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) for certain time. Afterward, the as-obtained products are thoroughly washed with hot deionized water to remove Cl− completely. Finally, these products are thermally treated in air or hydrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 200–400 °C to reduce Au3+ to metallic Au0. The procedure for the preparation of TiO2 supported gold NPs is illustrated in Fig. 4.

Recently, potassium niobate (KNbO3) supported gold NPs were prepared using deposition–precipitation in our laboratory.15a KNbO3 is a perovskite (i.e., ternary metal oxides denoted as ABO3) with low toxicity and high stability under light illumination. A representative TEM image (Fig. 5) shows that Au NPs with an average size of 5.8 nm are well dispersed on the surface of KNbO3 nanowires.

In the case of Ag containing hybrids like Ag/AgBr/TiO2,47,49 Ag/AgI/Al2O3 (ref. 39e) and Ag/AgBr/Al2O3,50 the formation of silver halides on support materials can be achieved via deposition–precipitation, in which a pair of precursors are often used. For instance, AgBr49 is formed on the TiO2 surface through the interaction between cationic Ag+ and anionic Br−, released by silver nitrate (AgNO3) and cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTAB), respectively. Successive UV illumination on AgBr can reduce Ag+ to metallic Ag and thus generate Ag/AgBr/TiO2.
3.2. Photoreduction
In the synthesis of plasmonic photocatalysts, photoreduction-assisted deposition of supported noble metal NPs under light irradiation is often employed. Semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, WO3, CdS, and Bi2WO4, etc.) process unique electronic structure composed of a filled valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB). When a semiconductor is illuminated by a photon with energy of hv exceeds its band gap energy (Eg), an electron in the VB is excited into the CB, leaving a positive hole in the VB. The photoexcited electrons can interact with specific precursors containing ionic metal species to generate metallic NPs on the support materials and the holes are captured by a sacrificial scavenger. Photoreduction is also called photodeposition and often integrated with other synthesis methods like deposition–precipitation,39e impregnation42c and ion exchange.41b Synthesis of Ag/AgBr/BiOBr hybrid photocatalyst with a combination of ion exchange and photoreduction is shown in Fig. 6. Noble metal NPs like Au and Ag supported on a variety of substrates are often prepared via photoreduction.40b–d

One of the advantages of photoreduction is the relatively high deposition ratio of noble metals. For instance, Kowalska et al.51 prepared Au/TiO2 under UV with all the gold species deposited and Kominami et al.40c,d,52 prepared Au/CeO2 with deposition ratio larger than 99.9% under light (λ > 300 nm). Moreover, further calcination is not needed so as to avoid aggregation of particles and a number of metals can be deposited on the same support by either simultaneous or successive reduction. Perhaps the disadvantage of photoreduction method is reproducibility.
3.3. Ion exchange
Ion exchange41 is often utilized to synthesize photocatalysts when the solubility of products of exchange reaction is lower than the reactants. Such method is generally integrated with a reduction process including calcination and in situ photoreduction, aiming to form metallic species. For instance, novel Ag/AgBr/BiOBr hybrid41b was prepared through in situ ion exchange between BiOBr microspheres and Ag+ out of AgNO3 in the presence of ethylene glycol, shown in eqn (1). BiOBr + Ag+ → AgBr + BiO+(1)
The as-prepared AgBr NPs were then reduced to form metallic Ag0 under visible light and Ag/AgBr NPs with a size of 20–50 nm were well dispersed on BiOBr microspheres. In contrast, direct precipitation of AgBr without the assistance of BiOBr can cause severe aggregation of AgBr particles. Ion exchange facilitates the synthesis of noble metal NPs with relatively uniform size and good dispersion on the supports. A series of plasmonic composites such as Ag@Ag(Br,I)41a and Ag@AgCl41c,d with high photocatalytic performance and stability were prepared by Huang et al. through ion exchange coupled with photoreduction. Recently, we have prepared Ag8W4O16@AgCl-nanparticle core–shell nanorods53 and H2WO4·H2O/Ag/AgCl nanoplates54via ion exchange. In case of Ag8W4O16/AgCl-nanoparticle core–shell nanorods,53Fig. 7(a) shows that AgCl NPs in a size range of 5–15 nm are dispersed on the surface of Ag8W4O16. The corresponding ion exchange reaction between Cl− and WO42− in the presence of NaCl solution is illustrated in Fig. 7(b). The formation of metallic Ag can be ascribed to the decomposition Ag8W4O16 that is photosensitive and instable. In general, the synthesis of plasmonic photocatalysts through ion exchange reaction is only applicable to specific material systems like silver halides.

3.4. Encapsulation
Assembly of noble metal NPs inside a photocatalyst matrix leads to sophisticated hybrid photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic activity as well as stability. Inert silica (SiO2) is often used as a shell, with NPs of noble metals like Au were embedded, denoted as Au@SiO2. Au@SiO2 is then encapsulated/embedded in the matrix of photocatalyst composites. In broad terms, composite photocatalysts containing encapsulated/embedded noble metal NPs are either single or multiple core–shell structures. On one hand, encapsulation enables homogeneous loading of noble metals and avoids severe agglomeration. On the other hand, encapsulation can prevent active species like metallic Ag from oxidation. Thus, Ag acts as a core with a passive layer of SiO2. In this case, SPR in the encapsulated/embedded noble metal NPs is not influenced by the passive layer. TiO2/Ag@SiO2,31a CdS@SiO2/Au@SiO2,46a Ru(bpy)3]2+/Ag@SiO2,46b TiO2/SiO2@Au,46c and Au–α-Fe2O3 composites46d–f were prepared involving encapsulation. To fabricate photocatalyst composites containing encapsulated/embedded noble metal NPs, a number of techniques such as physical vapor deposition, spin-coating etc., are often utilized. For instance, for the fabrication of sandwich-structured TiO2/Ag@SiO2,31a Ag NPs were embedded in SiO2 by sputtering to form Ag@SiO2. Then TiO2 film was spin-coated onto Ag@SiO2 to form TiO2/Ag@SiO2 composite.

Fig. 8 shows the cross-section TEM image of the as-fabricated composite with isolated Ag NPs. Recently, sophisticated photocatalysts containing embedded nanostructures were prepared via colloidal synthesis, aiming at a high degree control of photocatalyst synthesis.46a,c Torimoto et al.46a prepared a novel hybrid composed of SiO2 coated Au NPs (Au@SiO2) that was further enclosed by SiO2 coated CdS NPs (CdS@SiO2) through hydrolysis of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS)-modified CdS particles. Similarly, sandwich-structured TiO2/SiO2@Au46c was synthesized using a combination of sol–gel and calcinations, illustrated in Fig. 9. The sol–gel process facilitates the control of the deposition of Au NPs. In addition, Au NPs contact intimately with SiO2 matrix to avoid aggregation. And the close contact between Au NPs and TiO2 matrix allows the transportation of photogenerated electrons and the efficient charge separation will promote LSPR-mediated photocatalysis. Although sophisticated plasmonic composites can be prepared involving encapsulation, the synthesis process is probably elaborate.

4.1. Mineralization of organic pollutants
In recent years, significant attention has been directed toward abatement of harmful species in aqueous media. For instance, organic dyes are often used in printing, textile, and photographic industries. A sizable fraction of dyes is lost in the dying process and released into the effluent water streams. In China, each year there is about 1.6 × 109 m3 of dye-containing wastewater. In general, dye pollutants are difficult to be biodegraded or oxidized with chemicals. Therefore, it is necessary to employ appropriate photocatalysts to degrade dyes in aqueous solutions. Appreciable efforts have been made to develop nanostructured materials to degrade organic pollutants (e.g., azo dyes) under visible light.2a,2f,17a,55
Recently, a series of Ag containing photocatalysts were prepared in our laboratory.15d,42a,45a,53,54 These photocatalysts present various architectures, such as Ag–TiO2 thin films,15d Ag–TiO2 hollow spheres,45a H2WO4·H2O/Ag/AgCl nanoplates,54 Ag8W4O16@AgCl-nanoparticle core–shell nanorods,53 Ag2O/Bi2WO6 NPs,42a Ag/AgCl/TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs),42c with enhanced photoreactivity as well as stability toward degradation of various azo dyes such as rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light illumination. For example, Yu et al.42c prepared a novel plasmonic photocatalyst by immersing self-organized TiO2 NTs into AgNO3 solution several times, followed by photoreduction to form metallic Ag particles via in situ reduction of Ag+. The as-prepared Ag/AgCl/TiO2 displayed high activity and stability toward degradation and mineralization of MO, as shown in Fig. 10(a)–(d). The underlying mechanism shown in Fig. 10(e). The work function of Ag is larger than that of TiO2 and Schottky junction is formed at the Ag/TiO2 interface, and the resulting electric field in the space charge layer of TiO2 could promote transport of SPR excited electrons from Ag NPs to the conduction band of TiO2.56 These electrons result in the production of reactive species like O2−˙, ˙OOH and ˙OH. On the other hand, Ag+ can donate holes to oxidize Cl− ions and form Cl0 atoms, which are reactive radical species enabling the degradation and mineralization of dye molecules to carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and other species. Through this route, metallic Ag0 can be regenerated and Ag/AgCl/TiO2 thus gains stability. The detailed photocatalytic process is listed in the following. AgNPs + hν → AgNPs*(2) AgNPs* + TiO2 → AgNPs+˙ + TiO2(e)(3) TiO2(e) + O2 → TiO2 + O2−˙(4) O2−˙ + H+ → ˙OOH(5) ˙OOH + TiO2(e) + H+ → H2O2 + TiO2(6) H2O2 + TiO2(e) → ˙OH + OH− + TiO2(7) AgNPs+˙ + Cl− → AgNPs + Cl0(8) Organic pollutant + Cl0 (or other species like ˙OH, O2−˙ and H2O2) →→ degraded or mineralized products(9)

The proposed mechanism was further confirmed by monitoring hydroxyl radical (˙OH) formation and transient photocurrent response.
Novel hybrid photocatalysts based on silver halides were also reported in other laboratories.41b–d,57 Using an in situ ion exchange reaction between BiOBr microspheres and AgNO3 followed by photoreduction, Cheng et al.41b synthesized visible-responsive Ag/AgBr/BiOBr hybrid photocatalyst. It was found that the reaction rate constant for MO decomposition on Ag/AgBr/BiOBr is 0.396 min−1, much higher than that of Ag/AgBr (0.024 min−1) and N-P25 (0.007 min−1).41b The proposed underlying mechanism involves SPR-induced excitation of Ag NPs under visible light, electron transfer from Ag NPs to the conduction band of AgBr and BiOBr. These electrons are consequently trapped by O2 to form reactive oxygen species like O2−˙. The resulting positively charged Ag+ can oxidize organic molecules. Moreover, h+ and active oxygen species produced by the excitation of AgBr and BiOBr can degrade azo dyes as well.
Recently, there has been growing interest in graphene based-semiconductor photocatalysts.12a Graphene is a single two-dimensional layer of graphite which possesses high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1), superior electron mobility at room temperature (∼200000 cm2 V−1 s−1) and extremely high specific surface area (∼2600 m2 g−1).12a Graphene-derived graphene oxide (GO) has been exploited as a new class of photocatalyst supports.39f,48 Compared to conventional powdered active carbon, the basal planes and edges of GO are decorated with various oxygen-containing groups, such as hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl, carboxyl, etc. These functional groups can facilitate the solubility of GO in solvents and thus the synthesis of GO-based composites. Zhang et al.39f prepared AgCl@Ag grafted on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets via a two-step method, i.e., photoreduction of AgCl/graphene oxide hybrid followed by deposition–precipitation reaction of AgNO3 and GO precursors. The reaction rate constant of AgCl@Ag/RGO toward the degradation of RhB was enhanced 4-fold compared to that of bare Ag@AgCl. Upon visible light irradiation, Ag NPs generate electron–hole pairs through SPR, and the resulting electrons were quickly transferred to RGO and positively charged hole oxidize the RhB molecules on the surface of AgCl. Therefore, the high photocatalytic performance of AgCl@Ag/RGO is ascribed to the interaction of Ag NPs with RGO as well as excellent electron transfer capability of RGO that facilitates efficient charge separation. Moreover, the quick and successive transfer of photogenerated electrons inhibits the reaction of electrons with AgCl, consequently enhances the stability of AgCl@Ag/RGO catalyst. This study illustrates the modification of visible-light responsive photocatalyst systems with novel support materials like RGO sheet can greatly enhance the photocatalytic performance.
In addition to azo dyes, mineralization of other organic compounds in aqueous media by photocatalysis is one active field. Mineralization of organic acids (formic acid, oxalic acid, and acetic acid) by Au NPs supported on cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2) was investigated by Kominami et al.40c,d The underlying mechanism was proposed as following. First, Au NPs adsorb photons through the SPR effect. Second, photogenerated electron transfer occurs from Au NPs to CeO2. The resulting positive charge of Au NPs can oxidize organic compounds, while O2 molecules accept the electrons from CeO2 to form peroxide radical anion O2−˙ that is a crucial precursor for the generation of active species enabling the mineralization of organic acids. The observed photocatalytic performance was shown to depend on the metal oxide substrates. This trend can be rationalized that the potential of conduction band of CeO2 is lower than that of ZrO2 and TiO2, thus the transfer of photogenerated electrons is facilitated. Therefore, Au/CeO2 exhibited better photocatalytic performance than Au/ZrO2 and Au/TiO2. The apparent activation energy for mineralization of formic acid by Au/CeO2 was measured to be 2.4 kJ mol−1, which is much smaller than that of thermocatalytic reactions. In addition, the action spectrum was in good agreement with the photoabsorption spectrum. Thus, distinct from thermocatalysis, SPR-mediated photoabsorption on Au NPs was proposed as the rate-determining step of the mineralization process.
Removal of indoor gaseous pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by plasmonic photocatalysis were also reported.45b,47 VOCs include formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), benzene (C6H6), acetone (CH3COCH3), aromatic compounds, among others. Removal of these harmful pollutants is indispensable for public health. SPR-mediated photocatalysis enables oxidation of VOCs under ambient conditions using molecular O2 in air.
4.2. Organic synthesis
Organic synthesis plays a crucial role in modern chemical industry. For example, one of the most important reactions is selective oxidations of alcohols, aiming to produce carbonyl compounds (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) that are important precursors for the synthesis of drugs, vitamins and fragrances. However, selective oxidations often take place at relatively high temperature and pressure with the assistance of stoichiometric inorganic oxidants such as Cr(VI)-based reagents, which are notorious from a green chemistry point of view.58 Thus, searching environmentally benign catalytic processes under mild conditions is a new strategy in the synthesis of fine chemicals and intermediates.59 In contrast to thermocatalysis with unselective autooxidation processes, high selectivity can be achieved under ambient conditions in photocatalysis.

4.2.1 Selective oxidation reactions. 
In photocatalysis based on plasmon resonance, selective oxidation can be achieved in many types of reactions, such as thiol to disulfide,18a methanol and ethanol to formic acid and acetic acid,28 2-propanol to acetone,51a benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes,52 benzene to phenol,42b and styrene derivatives to oxygenated products.46b Very recently, Tanaka et al.52 reported the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes over 1 wt% Au/CeO2 under illumination of a green light emitting diode (LED) (λ = 530 nm). Table 2 lists the conversion and associated selectivity. The selectivity of all reactions is remarkably higher than 99%. To probe whether the reactions result from photocatalysis or not, absorption spectrum of 1 wt% Au/CeO2 was measured with barium sulfate as a reference. Fig. 11 shows that the calculated apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was in agreement with the photoabsorption (1-reflection), suggesting that SPR-mediated photocatalysis rather than thermocatalysis is responsible for the catalytic reactions. This work exemplifies the advantage of photocatalysis via SPR in the selective oxidation of alcohols in terms of high selectivity and mild reaction conditions.

Production of ethylene oxide through selective oxidation of ethylene (i.e., epoxidation) is one of the most important chemical processes. Recently, ethylene epoxidation by Ag nanocubes (edge length 60 nm, 20 wt%) supported on α-Al2O3 under visible light with an intensity comparable to sunlight was examined with combined experiments and theoretical calculations.43bFig. 12(a) shows that the rate of ethylene epoxidation is about 4 times as high as that of the dark reaction. Moreover, SPR-driven ethylene epoxidation occurs at 450 K under 1 atm, which is much lower than that of commercial reactions operating at relatively high temperature and high pressure with associated catalyst sintering.43b The underlying mechanism was rationalized through isotopic labelling experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Fig. 12(b) shows that energetic electrons produced by SPR on Ag nanocubes can populate adsorbed O2 antibonding orbitals to form a transient negative-ion state and thus facilitate O2 dissociation process, which is the rate determining step in the epoxidation. Further quantitative analysis reveals that neither heating nor direct excitation of adsorbates by visible light is responsible for the experimental observations. This study first demonstrates the applicability of visible-light responsive plasmonic photocatalysis toward industrial catalytic reactions. In addition, the results of this study illustrate the powerful combination of experiments and theoretical calculations for in-depth analysis of plasmonic photocatalysis and obtained insights potentially generate new concepts guiding the rational design and modification of industrial catalysts.

4.2.2 Selective reduction reactions. 
In addition to selective oxidation reactions, noble metal NPs excited by SPR can also promote reduction reactions of organic compounds with high selectivity under mild conditions.31b For example, Zhu et al.31b reported that 3 wt% Au/ZrO2 showed high performance toward reducing nitrobenzenes to form azobenzene compounds. Table 3 shows the experimental results.

The overall photocatalytic reaction is described as the following (10)
First of all, oxidation of isopropyl alcohol leads to the formation of H–AuNP species, which play a pivotal role in the above reduction reaction. Keeping in mind that KOH in the reaction mixture can assist the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from isopropyl alcohol. The next key step is the cleavage of the N–O bonds. Upon visible light illumination, the excited electrons on Au NPs induced by SPR interact strongly with the electrophilic nitro groups of nitrobenzene molecules, and thus facilitate the cleavage of the N–O bonds by H–AuNP species on the AuNPs. The resulting HO–AuNP species was subsequently decomposed to generate oxygen molecules and H–AuNP species. In general, azobenzene is formed as an intermediate in the thermal hydrogenation of nitrobenzene. Nevertheless, azobenzene is extremely unstable under thermal reaction conditions and is thus rapidly reduced to aniline. This study highlights the possibility of directly transforming an unstable intermediate in a thermal reaction to one desirable product via a photocatalytic process.

4.3. Water splitting
Combustion of fossil fuels inevitably releases anthropogenic CO2 into atmosphere. To date, elevated atmospheric CO2 has led to global climate change and ocean acidification. Hydrogen plays a dispensable role in clean and renewable energy infrastructures and potentially alleviates our dependence on fossil fuels. Currently, hydrogen is predominantly produced by reforming natural gas and petroleum at relatively high temperature and high pressure. Finding an alternative approach in hydrogen production is highly desirable.60 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda reported the pioneering work in photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen generation on n-type TiO2 semiconductor electrode.4 Since then, considerable advances have been made in solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion via photocatalysis.16b,39a,43a,46a,e,61
Torimoto et al.46a prepared a novel hybrid composed of two core–shell nanostructures (CdS@SiO2‖Au@SiO2), as shown in Fig. 13(a and b). For Au@SiO2, the thickness of amorphous SiO2 shell can be tuned in a range of 0.3–73 nm. For CdS@SiO2, the thickness of the amorphous SiO2 shell is ca. 0.3 nm. In this nanoarchitecture, the role of the Au core (19 nm in size) is light capture and local electric field enhancement via LSPR. Fig. 13(c) shows that compared to CdS@SiO2, CdS@SiO2‖Au@SiO2 shows higher performance for H2 generation. And the photocatalytic activity for CdS@SiO2‖Au@SiO2 with SiO2 shell thickness in 17 nm is higher than that of CdS@SiO2‖Au@SiO2 with SiO2 shell thickness in 2.8 nm, suggesting that the photocatalytic activity of CdS particles is dependent on the distance between CdS and Au. Furthermore, increasing the size of Au core can enlarge the optimal distance between CdS and Au, which works in a cooperative way for photocatalyzing water splitting. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 13(d). Since the SiO2 layer can prevent direct electron transfer between CdS and Au, the resulting enhanced electric field solely interacts with adjacent CdS cores with an intrinsic bandgap of 2.40 eV. As a result, photogenerated electrons in CdS particles were transferred to co-catalyst Rh particles toward H+ reduction for H2 production. This study illustrates the unique role of LSPR-induced electric field in enhancing photocatalysis.

Very recently, Yang and co-workers46e reported plasmon-enhanced photocurrent for solar water splitting on hematite/gold composite. Au nanopillars with a size of 300 nm were patterned in square arrays with an interparticle distance of 700 nm. Fe2O3 electrodes in the form of thin films were coated on these periodic Au nanopillars via nanoimprinting. The morphology of this type of composite is shown in Fig. 14(a). Fig. 14(b) shows the behavior of photoresponse for the as-fabricated sample in comparison with planar sample counterpart under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (∼100 mW cm−2). It is suggested that the photocurrent enhancement is primarily due to the optical absorption resulting from SPR and photonic-mode light trapping. The proposed mechanism is further verified by numerical simulations based on finite difference time domain (FDTD). Furthermore, by changing the thickness of Fe2O3 adlayer from 50 to 140 nm, the wavelength of enhanced photocurrent was red-shifted and a net photocurrent enhancement can be achieved up to 50%.

The above two examples highlight the importance of particular nanoarchitectures when considering the design of high performance photocatalysts on nanoscale. In addition, the results from these studies are potentially applicable to other types of nanocomposites with unique properties in sunlight-driven water splitting based on SPR.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, it is clear that great advances have been made regarding SPR-mediated photocatalytic performance by noble metal-based composites under visible light. A variety of methodologies such as deposition–precipitation, photoreduction, ion exchange, and encapsulation have been utilized for fabricating a wealth of plasmonic composites. Among mechanistic discussions, SPR-mediated electron excitation and transfer is a major principle. Furthermore, these composite photocatalysts show promising applications in a range of fields such as wastewater treatment, air clean-up, organic synthesis, solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion, among others. Harvesting solar energy using high-performance plasmonic photocatalysts is becoming an exciting research area with an ultimate goal toward the sustainable development of global energy and environment.
In spite of significant advances on SPR-based photocatalysis, the extent of relevant work undertaken is still much less compared to that of conventional thermocatalysis and more systematic studies are needed. Novel approaches for the synthesis and assembly of sophisticated plasmonic nanoarchitectures are highly desirable. Particularly important is to prepare monodispersed noble metal particles with controllable interparticle distance on the substrates. Over the past decade, there have been great advances in shape control of low-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., nanodots, nanorods, and nanosheets) with entirely new physico-chemical properties via a “bottom-up” approach.7b,65 For example, in case of one-dimensional anisotropic nanostructures, it is possible to enhance the photoreactivity by tuning the direction and path of photogenerated charge carriers through quantum confinement to minimize the e−–h+ recombination.66 Combination of monodispersed noble metallic NPs with well-defined low-dimensional substrates is one approach to facilitate the study of SPR and its role in photocatalysis. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations based on DFT can provide insights into the electronic structure of plasmonic photocatalyst, various electron transfer processes and associated photocatalytic properties. Such information can enhance our in-depth understanding of surface plasmon resonance-mediated photocatalysis as well as provide the basis for rational design of novel plasmonic photocatalysts with improved reactivity, selectivity and stability. The notable challenge lies in the improvement of photoreactivity under “real world” broadband sunlight with optimal photonic efficiency.
We envision that the development of surface plasmon resonance-mediated photocatalysis is expected to impact both fundamental and applied energy and the environment in the forthcoming years. In addition, results obtained on plasmon-mediated photocatalysis not only are the key to enabling new protocols and technological breakthroughs toward industrial prototyping on a large scale, but potentially have broad implications that cross other disciplines, such as biotechnology, near-field optics, single-molecule spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Although plasmonic noble metal NPs are very promising in photocatalysis, their widespread applications make it possible for human beings and the environment to come into contact with them. Therefore, the safety should be evaluated under the international guidelines and relevant study is urgent.
