    , Accepted 11th January 2023First published on 20th January 2023AbstractA series of titanium dioxide–nitrogen doped graphene quantum dot (TiO2–NGQD) composite photocatalysts were synthesized through a simple hydrothermal reaction with varied NGQD content. Through a proposed Z-Scheme heterojunction, the composites were able to achieve increased photocurrent generation and photocatalytic degradation of phenol under both full spectrum and visible only illumination. The prepared composites were able to switch from anodic to cathodic photocurrent by changing the light source from full spectrum to visible wavelengths. The photocatalytic capabilities of the composites were tested by degrading phenol and this was monitored via nuclear magnetic resonance. All composites outperformed the commercial standard P25 TiO2 under both full spectrum and visible irradiation, with the 8 wt% NGQD composite showing a visible improvement of over 600% compared to P25. With the ability to manipulate the generation of majority charge carriers, TiO2–NGQDs have significant potential not only in photocatalysis, but in far reaching applications such as energy harvesting and water splitting.
1 Introduction
Photocatalytic materials have a broad range of potential applications in a green economy, including their use in H2 generation,1 self-cleaning surfaces,2 and as photo-active materials used for pollution remediation in air and water.3 These applications are possible due to the photocatalytic material's ability to convert light into chemical and electrical energy where incoming light equal to or greater than the band gap of the material excites an electron–hole pair within it. Photogenerated electrons (ecb−) and holes (hvb+) travel through the conduction and valence bands, respectively, to the catalyst surface where they can interact with adsorbed species: either O2 or H2O to form reactive oxygen species (ROS), or directly with surface bound analytes to undergo redox reactions.4 Photocatalysis holds a distinct advantage over traditional water treatment techniques as they offer a thermally stable, renewable, and broad destruction range of chemical contaminants.5,6 While this technology is promising, and despite reports of photocatalytic wastewater treatment existing in the literature for nearly 40 years, there is little current adoption of the technology by industrial or municipal agencies.7
Of the commercially available photocatalysts, none have garnered more attention than titanium dioxide (TiO2) due to its mineral abundance, chemical and physical stability, and favorable band positions for redox reactions.8 The most popular, and ‘gold-standard’ photocatalyst is P25 TiO2, a commercially available mixture of anatase and rutile polymorphs with bandgaps of 3.2 eV and 3.0 eV, respectively.9 One downside of this material is the large bandgap, which confines the light absorption that initiates the photocatalysis to UV wavelengths thus severely limiting its efficiency and utilization, especially for applications that rely on excitation with the solar spectrum. TiO2 nanoparticles composed of a single phase (i.e. 100% rutile or 100% anatase) are even less effective, because they often experience issues with charge carrier recombination,10 significantly reducing their photocatalytic efficiency and therefore their potential for commercial utilization.
Different strategies have been proposed for solving these shortcomings including; energy band modification,11,12 morphology control,13,14 and installation of heterojunctions.15,16 Generating heterojunctions by combining two dissimilar materials is a promising solution as it can limit electron–hole recombination by providing favorable charge separation pathways.17 In TiO2, this can be achieved by using grains of differing morphology, as is the case for P25 TiO2, or between TiO2 and a different material.18 Graphene has been used in this capacity in the past due to its favorable band position for charge transfer and high charge carrier mobility.19–21 Traditionally these heterojunctions have formed “Type II” interfaces, however this reduces the oxidative and reductive potential of the composite as the electrons and holes transfer to their lowest energy states. Z-Scheme heterojunctions retard this pathway to lower energy for both holes and electrons and allow for the highest reduction and oxidation potential of the two materials to be utilized, which significantly increases their photocatalytic effectiveness.22,23
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have received recent attention due to applications as bioimaging labels,24 catalysts,25 and sensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells.26 Recently, several studies have proposed the use of GQDs/TiO2 composite materials, which show enhanced photocatalytic efficiencies over their pure TiO2 counterparts under UV illumination.27–29 However, these composites still offer little in the way of visible absorbance. In addition, they require large GQD loadings to work, which can have overall negative effects on photocatalytic efficiency.
Heteroatom doping of graphene, notably with nitrogen due to its similar ionic radius, has been shown to enhance its absorbance in the visible region. Our group has recently reported on new advances in NGQD materials; specifically, by conducting a post synthesis oxidation we were able to increase the crystallinity, stability, and visible absorbance of the NGQDs,30 which are all advantageous for photocatalytic material design.
In this paper we investigate how these oxidized NGQDs nanoparticles can be used to create TiO2–NGQD composite structures using a highly scalable and low temperature green synthesis route. By varying the amount of NGQDs present in the composite, we investigate how the visible absorbance can be increased and explore the effect that NGQD content has on charge separation and the photocatalytic degradation of phenol.
2 Methods
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were used as received and without further purification. Phenol (Anachemia, ≥99.0%), Titanium Isopropoxide (TiOP, Aldrich, 97%), Maleic Acid (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.0%), P25 TiO2 (Aeroxide® TiO2, Nippon Aerosil), D2O (Sigma Aldrich, ≥99.0%) were purchased and used without modification.
2.2 Oxidized NGQD synthesis
Oxidized NGQDs (“NGQDs”) were synthesized according to a previous report.31 Briefly, citric acid and urea were mixed in a 3:1 molar ratio in 40 mL of DI water in a Teflon lined hydrothermal vessel and heated at 160 °C for 20 h. Dry NGQD powder was redispersed into a solution of 5% H2O2 wt% and stirred for 24 h. The solution was subsequently dried and NGQDs were collected.
2.3 Synthesis of TiO2–NGQD composites
TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified hydrothermal treatment. Varying amounts of NGQDs (0, 10, 20, 40 mg) were dispersed in 40 mL of 0.15 M HCl. 2 mL of TiOP was dispersed in 8 mL of absolute ethanol and added dropwise to the acidic NGQD solution under vigorous stirring. The solution was left stirring overnight until it became transparent, after which it was transferred to a clean 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 160 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 15000g for 10 min; the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed thrice with absolute ethanol before being dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The resulting solid was ground using mortar and pestle. The produced powders are identified by the mass of NGQD added as weight percent of TiO2; these are referred to as “TiO2” (0 w% NGQD), “2% NGQD” (2 wt% NGQD), “4% NGQD” (4 wt% NGQD), “8% NGQD” (8 wt% NGQD).
2.4 Characterization instruments
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken using a diffractometer (Miniflex 600, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation in the range of 15–75° 2θ at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were taken using the JEOL 2010F electron microscope equipped with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted using the ESCALAB 250XI (ThermoFisher Scientific).
2.5 Chronoamperotometry method
Electrodes were prepared using the tape casting doctor blade method32 on pre-cleaned Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. TiO2–NGQD powder was added to a small volume of absolute ethanol to make a slurry which was then coated onto the ITO surface. The films were dried at 200 °C for 5 min and imaged for normalization purposes. Photocurrent responses were measured using an Autolab PGSTAT204 utilizing a three electrode setup consisting of the TiO2–NGQD coated ITO as a working electrode, a platinum sheet counter electrode, and a standard calomel electrode as reference. The working electrodes were back illuminated by a 150 W Xe Lamp (Lamp: Abet LS 150; Bulb: Ushino UXL-S150MO) under 0 V bias in a 100 mM Na2SO4 electrolyte solution with constant stirring. A 400 nm longpass filter was placed between light source and sample for studies of visible light photocurrent response.
2.6 Terephthalic acid radical capture test
10 mg of solid catalyst was added to a borosilicate glass vial and to that 4.15 mL of saturated (1 mM) terephthalic acid solution and 850 μL of 100 mM para-benzoquinone solution were added. The reaction solution was sonicated for 10 min to disperse the catalyst and then stirred vigorously in the absence of light to establish the adsorption equilibrium. The reaction was then exposed to 150 W Xe irradiation at a distance of 20 cm for 30 min. At 10 min intervals, a 500 μL aliquot was taken from the center of the reaction solution. To this aliquot, 50 μL of 1 N NaOH was added to enhance 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid fluorescence and aid in catalyst removal by centrifugation (1 min, 15000g). The fluorescence was analysed with λex = 315 nm, and λem = 380–500 nm. Fluorescence spectra were smoothed using Savitzky–Golay algorithm with 3 points and polynomial order 2.
2.7 Photocatalytic methods
10 mg of catalyst was weighed into a borosilicate glass container with 5 mL of D2O and sonicated for 10 minutes to ensure that any catalyst aggregations were broken up. 3 mL of phenol solution was added to make a final concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 (5.3 mM) phenol. The solution was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes in the dark for the adsorption/desorption equilibrium to be reached. The solutions were then exposed to 150 W Xe lamp (Lamp: Abet LS 150; Bulb: Ushino UXL-S150MO) irradiation with an intensity of 3800 lm and at a distance of 12 cm while being stirred vigorously. A 400 nm longpass filter was applied for visible light trials. 300 μL aliquots were taken from the center of the reaction solution at various time points throughout the reaction. 30 μL of a 50 mg mL−1 maleic acid was added to a 300 μL sample aliquot and analysed by 1H NMR (500 MHz Agilent DD2 NMR Spectrometer). Maleic acid is used as an internal standard for quantitative NMR experiments. NMR spectra were obtained using 46 scans and delay time of 29 s. This chosen delay time was 3× T1 for all phenol and maleic acid protons ensuring integration was quantitative.
The calculated photocatalytic reaction rate constants were obtained by using the Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetic model: (1)where C is the concentration of the reactant, K is an equilibrium constant of adsorption, and k is the rate constant. In the regime wherein KC >1, the rate becomes 0th order:33 Rate = k′obs(2)k′obs represents the observed rate constant of the photocatalytic removal of phenol. This linear approximation fits well all samples that showed photocatalytic behaviour in this study.
3 Results & discussion
3.1 TiO2–NGQD characterization
Powder XRD measurements were conducted to verify the crystal structure of the TiO2–NGQD composites and the results are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  XRD spectra of NGQDs and TiO2–NGQD composites with 0%, 2%, 4% and 8% NGQD content (wt%). TiO2 crystal phases are labelled (A: Anatase and B: Brookite). 
The hydrothermally prepared TiO2–NGQD composites are predominantly composed of the anatase phase. Each of the prepared composites shows a large anatase (101) peak at 25.5° along with other characteristic peaks at larger values. Several minute and closely spaced peaks typically observed in anatase spectra (e.g. 112 triplet at 37°; 105 and 211 at 54°) are unresolved due to the small size of the synthesized nanomaterials leading to significant line broadening. The Scherrer equation was applied to the (101) peak at 25.5° to estimate the crystallite size of the nanoparticles, which was found to be 5.5 nm and did not vary significantly with NGQD content and suggests the NGQDs did not impact the overall crystallinity of the TiO2. A small peak at 31° corresponding to (121) brookite facet can be observed in samples with low amounts of NGQDs. It is most evident in hydrothermally prepared TiO2 with no added NGQD and vanishes as NGQD content increases. This suggests that the introduction of NGQDs can interact with TIOP during the hydrothermal decomposition and crystallization process to affect the final crystal structure of the prepared TiO2. The XRD spectra of NGQDs (Fig. 1, black curve) shows a broad peak at approximately 26° typical of the (002) interlayer spacing of graphene.34 This feature is not seen in composite spectra in Fig. 1 due to the low NGQD mass and weak crystallinity compared to that of TiO2.
High resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was used to study the size, morphology and crystallinity of the composites, and Fig. 2 shows a typical image. The inset is a zoomed-out micrograph showing TiO2 nanoparticles of cylindrical shape that are 5–10 nm in length; this size was unaffected by the increased amount of NGQDs. NGQDs are difficult to discern in low resolution images because their single layer graphitic structure gives a much lower contrast compared with the TiO2 nanoparticles, which are visible as dark particles in the inset on Fig. 2. From the HR-TEM, TiO2 nanoparticles can be identified by the predominantly (101) anatase surface with a measured lattice spacing of 3.3 Å, while NGQDs are identified by the lattice spacing of 2.2 Å corresponding to the (1120) direction of the graphitic lattice.35 HR-TEM images also reveal a close physical interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and NGQDs that suggests the formation of heterojunctions, which would improve charge transfer upon illumination. Based on the estimated sizes of TiO2 (Fig. 2) and NGQDs,30 there is an approximately equal number of TiO2 and NGQD nanoparticles at 2% NGQD wt%. At this ratio, each TiO2 nanoparticle is likely bound to 1 NGQD; at lower ratios, ‘free’ unbound TiO2 is present and at higher NGQD wt%'s, we expect several NGQD particles to be bound to a single TiO2.

Red line indicates lattice fringes of the 101 anatase phase of the TiO2 nanoparticle, blue line indicates the (1120) lattice fringe of the NGQD nanoparticle. The NGQD particles are harder to resolve due to their monolayer structure, but their close proximity to the TiO2 nanoparticles suggests that a composite structure has been formed. Inset: Low resolution TEM image illustrating approximate size of TiO2 nanoparticles, single layer NGQDs aren't visible due to low contrast. 
As NGQD content increased, the prepared composite became visually darker, transitioning from off-white for pure TiO2, through tan to a dark brown which was observed at 8% NGQD (Fig. 3, insert). The diffuse spectra for P25 TiO2 (Fig. 3 black line) is shown as reference with an absorption edge at roughly 400 nm compared to that of pure TiO2 which is slightly lower in wave-length due to its predominantly anatase structure vs. the anatase and rutile polymorph of P25.

As the NGQD content increases, a significant gain in visible light absorbance is achieved; even 1% NGQD content (wt%) extends the absorption edge well into visible wavelengths, with further visible absorbance increases being achieved with increased NGQD amounts. The optical bandgaps of the materials were calculated via a Tauc plot of the Kubelka–Munk function derived from the diffuse spectra in Fig. 3 following the method outlined in Patel et al.36 An example of the generated Tauc plot is shown in Fig. S5.† The optical bandgap for P25 was calculated to be 3.1 eV and the pure TiO2 (0% NGQD) was calculated as 3.25 eV, which is in good agreement with reported literature values for P25 and anatase TiO2.37 The optical bandgaps for the composite materials are 2.88 eV, 2.49 eV, and 2.19 eV for 2% NGQD, 4% NGQD and 8% NGQD, respectively.
XPS analysis was utilized to confirm that the NGQDs and TiO2 are chemically bonded. The full survey scan, high-resolution Ti 2p and O 1s spectra of the composites with 0, 2 and 8 wt% NGQDs are shown in Fig. 4. The survey scan (Fig. 4) indicates that the samples are composed of titanium, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, the latter of which only becomes visible at 8% NGQD content. Examining the high-resolution Ti 2p spectra (Fig. 4) for pure TiO2 the peaks at 458.12 eV and 463.8 eV are assigned to the Ti4+ state in TiO2 for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 levels, respectively.38 A 0.5 eV positive shift is present in both 2% NGQD and 8% NGQD samples with peaks at approximately 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV. This positive shift has been attributed to the strong interaction between graphitic structures and TiO2 which is caused by electron transfer between the TiO2 and NGQDs, leading to the formation of Ti–O–C bonds (and a heterojunction) between the two materials.9 These Ti–O–C bonds are crucial to ensuring efficient charge separation and electron transfer after photogenerated electron hole pairs are created. The binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for 2% and 8% NGQD content is identical, possibly due to the bond formation between TiO2 and NGQDs already being close to a maximum at 2% NGQD content.
 Fig. 4  XPS survey spectra (a). High resolution of Ti 2p (b) states and O 1s (c) for: 0, 2, 8 wt% NGQD. 
The O 1s high resolution scan is shown in Fig. 4, with peaks at 529.37 eV and 531.41 eV for the pure TiO2 sample assigned to the Ti–O–Ti and Ti–OH bonds respectively.9 A similar 0.5 eV shift is also observed in the Ti–O–Ti bond for both 2% and 8% NGQD content. However, the Ti–OH bond, which would be expected at 531.9 eV (accounting for the positive shift), is no longer present. This disappearance is likely due to the binding of the NGQDs to the surface of the TiO2, converting the Ti–OH bonds to Ti–O–C at approximately 530.9 eV.39–41 The intensity of this peak increases in the 8% NGQD sample as more of the TiO2 surface is likely to be bonding with NGQDs. The positive shift observed in the high-resolution Ti 2p and O 1s spectra for TiO2–NGQD composites compared with pure TiO2 can be attributed to a transfer of electron density once the composite is formed.42 The positive shift observed in the HR-XPS coupled with information on the Fermi levels of the material suggest that the TiO2–NGQD heterojunction forms a direct Z-Scheme hierarchy43 (shown schematically in Fig. 5) which has several implications for the photogenerated charge transfer dynamics occurring in this system.
 Fig. 5  Proposed direct Z-Scheme hierarchy of TiO2–NGQD composites. An internal electric field is formed during Fermi alignment which leaves the NGQDs and TiO2 with a positive and negative charge, respectively. This internal electric field allows excited electrons in the TiO2 to combine with holes generated in the NGQD, leaving highly reductive electrons (NGQD) and holes (TiO2) to participate in ROS generation. Superoxide and hydroxyl radical potentials vs. NHE are shown on right axis.44 
UPS measurements (Fig. S1†) of the prepared TiO2–NGQD composites suggest that the composite formed here has similar band positions to a previous report by Murali et al.45 which suggests that the Fermi level in NGQDs is higher than that in TiO2. Upon composite formation, even in the absence of light, a migration of electrons from NGQD to TiO2 occurs until the Fermi levels are aligned. This inter-junction transfer generates a positive charge within the NGQD, a negative charge within TiO2 and an internal electric field between the two materials. This internal electric field acts to retard the migration of photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of the NGQDs to the conduction band of TiO2. Upon exposure with ultrabandgap radiation (with respect to TiO2), electron hole pairs are generated independently within TiO2 and NGQDs. Electrons from TiO2 and holes in NGQDs can recombine through the aforementioned low resistance interface, resulting in reductive electrons in the conduction band of the NGQDs and oxidizing holes in the valence band of TiO2. This band hierarchy is preferable for photocatalytic activity as the resulting hole species retain the oxidizing power of the TiO2 valence band and are capable of generating highly oxidative ROS species, notably hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). Similarly, the electrons left in the conduction band of the NGQDs are highly reductive and can be utilized for reducing organics directly, or generating ROS species, notably the superoxide radical (˙O2−).
3.2 Terephthalic acid radical capture
To provide further evidence of a Z-Scheme mechanism, a radical trapping assay with terephthalic acid was performed. Terephthalic acid is known to readily react with hydroxyl radicals to form an intermediate, 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid, which can be monitored using fluorescence (parent terephthalic acid does not fluoresce).46 By monitoring fluorescence generation as a function of reaction time, we can infer the generation and presence of hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals can be produced either from holes in the valence band or superoxide generated from electrons in the conduction band. To discredit the superoxide pathway, a superoxide scavenger, para-benzoquinone was used, therefore all 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid fluorescence observed is mediated via h+VB. This provides further evidence of a Z-Scheme mechanism from the following logic. In a Z-Scheme, the oxidation potential of TiO2 and reduction potential of the NGQD are preserved, whereas in traditional Type II schemes, they would be lost in favor of the weaker NGQD oxidation potential and TiO2 reduction potential. Based on UPS measurements, NGQD oxidation potential is too weak to produce the hydroxyl radical (Fig. 5). Therefore, observing 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid and inferring the hydroxyl radical is only possible if the TiO2 oxidation potential is conserved which would happen in a Z-Scheme mechanism and not in a traditional type II scheme.
The fluorescence spectra as a function of reaction time are shown for a variety of catalytic systems. The photolysis control showed no fluorescence across the reaction time suggesting that the 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid was not formed (Fig. S2a†). An NGQD control sample was performed (No TiO2 present) which saw a moderate fluorescence signal regardless of reaction time (Fig. S2b†) including before illumination (time 0 min) which indicates the fluorescence observed in the presence of pure NGQD is likely due to the optoelectronic properties of the dots themselves. This was further confirmed by running the NGQD Blank (Fig. S2b† purple and gold) which did not contain any terephthalic acid. The fluorescence was lower during the control runs (Fig. S2b† Time 0–30 min) due to fluorescent quenching by benzoquinone. Both TiO2 samples originally showed no fluorescence as none of the terephthalic acid had been converted prior to illumination (Fig. 6 black line). After 10 min a peak corresponding to fluorescence of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid appeared in both samples. From this, we can infer that hydroxyl radicals are being generated by h+VB in the valence band of TiO2 and a Z-Scheme architecture is present. The signal increased at later timepoints for 2% NGQD but remained relatively constant for the pure TiO2 sample.

3.3 Photocurrent response
The photocatalytic potential of nanomaterials is often linked to their electrochemical response under illumination, which can provide insight into the charge recombination and electronic behavior of the material.47,48Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent response of the TiO2–NGQD thin films under UV + visible illumination. As expected, each of the TiO2–NGQD composites produced a current upon illumination with the full Xe spectrum and virtually no current when the illumination was removed. The presence of NGQDs improved the photocurrent response of the TiO2, presumably due to enhancing charge separation and decreasing recombination through the proposed Z-Scheme mechanism. The maximum response is seen at low NGQD content (2 wt%) and decreases as NGQD content increases. We interpret this to mean that at low NGQD content (2% NGQD wt%) the beneficial effect of the Z-Scheme charge separation is dominant, resulting in the highest photocurrent response. As NGQD content increases, light absorption by the NGQDs has a detrimental effect on the effective excitation of the TiO2 nanoparticles, which leads to an overall decrease in photocurrent response.31 As NGQD content increases, an increase in the number NGQDs present on the surface of the TiO2 may decrease the interaction between the electrolyte and the TiO2, further decreasing the overall response. All samples exhibited an anodic photocurrent (electrons as majority charge carrier) response when illuminated with UV light. The pure TiO2 and 2% NGQD samples both show an initial spike that can be attributed to the generation of electron/hole pairs at the surface–electrolyte interface; their subsequent recombination results in a decay as steady state is reached. For both the 4% NGQD and 8% NGQD samples there is no sharp initial anodic peak; instead, an increase in current is observed until equilibrium is reached near the end of the illumination window. This suggests that the recombination rate in these composites is delayed or hindered, which has been previously attributed to Ti3+ surface states that act to trap generated electrons.49,50 This delay in photocurrent response was most pronounced in the 8% NGQD sample; however, no indication of Ti3+ binding energies can be seen in the high-resolution Ti XPS scan in Fig. 4. Despite not observing Ti3+via XPS, our photocatalytic results (discussed below) do indicate the presence of mid-gap absorption occurring in TiO2, which is attributed to Ti3+ states generated during solvation and are likely due to oxygen vacancies near the surface.51 Another possible explanation is that this delay is caused by slightly thicker coatings (by visible inspection) on the ITO surface for the 4% NGQD and 8% NGQD samples, which would require charges to migrate further to the electrolyte interface increasing odds of charge recombination.52
 Fig. 7  Chronoamperometry plots for TiO2–NGQD composites when exposed to full spectrum Xe irradiation (20 seconds of illumination followed by 20 seconds of no illumination). 

Fig. 8 shows the photocurrent response of TiO2–NGQD thin films under visible (>400 nm) light irradiation. Pure TiO2 shows no response under visible light, which is consistent with the fact that both anatase and brookite crystal phases have bandgaps greater than the energy of irradiation (hν < 3.1 eV). The presence of NGQDs initiates a photocurrent response, and an increase in the NGQD content increases the visible photocurrent response, which is expected since there is an increase in the amount of material capable of absorbing visible light. The negative photocurrent of all composites is indicative of a cathodic response, which would indicate that the majority charge carriers have changed from electrons, which is the situation when under UV + visible illumination, to holes in this experiment, which is done with only visible illumination. The switching from cathodic to anodic photocurrent response on a single sample is more clearly shown in Fig. S3.† We attribute the change in conductance to charge transfer between ITO substrate and excited NGQD, then directly to electrolyte, and bypassing TiO2 nanoparticles. Due to the valence band positions of the components and the internal electric field provided by the Z-Scheme it is unfavorable for the holes to migrate from NGQDs to TiO2, therefore acting as an electron acceptor from the electrode and exhibiting the measured cathodic response.10 The ability of TiO2–NGQD coatings to switch majority carrier based on the wavelength of illumination warrants their consideration in a number of applications, such as optoelectronics or photo-conversion, where its tunability can be capitalized on. In these applications, NGQD content can be further optimized to meet the desired performance.

3.4 Photocatalytic degradation of phenol
To investigate the effect that NGQD content had on the photocatalytic performance of TiO2, the photodegradation of phenol was investigated. Phenol was chosen as a model contaminant for this study due to its relatively simple structure lending itself well to NMR analysis, its abundant occurrence; it is also known as an anthropogenic contaminant that persists in water. The photocatalytic efficiency for the removal of phenol by the TiO2–NGQD composites was obtained by monitoring the disappearance of phenol peaks by 1H NMR (Fig. S4†) after irradiation with the full Xe spectrum (Fig. 9) and with visible (>400 nm) light only (Fig. 10). This technique was chosen due to the simplicity it provides: the analysis is quick, the measurement is unequivocal, and the colloidal catalyst does not need to be removed from the sample solution prior to measurements.53 However, because the catalyst was not removed, the amount of phenol adsorbed onto the catalyst cannot be determined. The calculated photocatalytic degradation rate for the TiO2–NGQD composites is shown in Table 1.

3.4.1 Photodegradation of phenol using full spectrum Xe light source. 
The photodegradation profile for phenol utilizing the full Xe spectrum (UV + visible wavelengths) is shown in Fig. 9. The pure TiO2 degrades phenol at a rate similar to that by P25 TiO2, which was expected because it is the anatase phase of the TiO2 that is responsible for the majority of the photocatalytic efficiency in UV wavelengths. The introduction of NGQDs increased the degradation efficiency, albeit with an inflection point between 2% and 4% NGQD content and largely matched the trend observed in the photocurrent response that is shown in Fig. 7. The 2% NGQD sample exhibited both the largest photocurrent response and the most efficient photocatalysis under full spectrum illumination, resulting in the ideal NGQD content being 2% by mass of TiO2.
The 2% NGQD appears to maximize the benefits of the proposed Z-Scheme mechanism: both the TiO2 and NGQD components of the composite are being excited under the full spectrum Xe irradiation (UV + visible) therefore enhancing the Z-Scheme charge separation. Both the highly oxidative holes left in the TiO2 and the reductive electrons in the NGQD can then generate ROS, which leads to the subsequent degradation of phenol. At higher NGQD contents, we observe that the photocatalytic efficiency begins to decrease. There are two potential reasons for this result:
(i) NGQDs, which can also absorb UV light, compete with TiO2 for light absorption but do not fully participate in ˙OH radical generation due to valence band position or (ii) NGQDs cover surface sites on TiO2, hindering phenol's ability to approach, thus limiting the potential reaction between them and the photogenerated ROS.


3.4.2 Photodegradation of phenol under visible light (>400 nm). 
The photodegradation of phenol under visible irradiation (>400 nm) was subsequently tested (Fig. 10) to further investigate the NGQDs impact due to their broadband visible absorbance and to better determine photocatalyst performance under solar irradiation and outdoor applications. Under visible light, an increase of NGQD content was found to increase the photocatalytic efficiency of the composites, which is consistent with the trend observed in the visible photocurrent response shown in Fig. 8. For the pure TiO2 however, a reasonable photocatalytic efficiency was observed but without a corresponding visible photocurrent. We attribute this difference in behavior to the presence of shallow trap states formed on the surface of the TiO2, which allowed for visible wavelengths to be absorbed. These Ti3+ trap states are likely due to oxygen vacancies that are generated during the photocatalytic reaction and are therefore not visible during XPS evaluation.51 They also would show a minimal impact in the photocurrent measurement that is carried out for a thin film, where the effective surface area is negligible compared to that of nano-colloids dispersed in solution. The measured efficiency of Ti3+ induced photocatalysis is low compared to ultra-bandgap irradiation (4.1 vs. 13.1 μg ml−1 h−1, as seen in Table 1) however it still contributes a significant amount through the direct Z-Scheme where it acts to separate charges generated by the NGQDs.
The increased rate observed with increasing NGQDs loading in the nanocomposites is expected, and consistent with the NGQDs being largely responsible for the generation of charge carriers and the increasing trend in p-type conductance with increased NGQD content. However, there is negligible rate difference found between 8% NGQD and 4% NGQD samples; this suggests that the addition of NGQDs start to provide diminishing returns to photocatalytic performance under visible light at approximately 4% by weight. Note that the NGQDs on their own exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity, as seen in the flattened gold curve in Fig. 10, which indicate that charge transfer dynamics within the composite still play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance under visible light. This result also suggests that the charge carriers generated by midgap Ti3+ play a key role in producing ROS. The lack of catalytic activity by the pure NGQDs, and reliance of the composite on TiO2 generated holes is not surprising since NGQDs lack the oxidative power to oxidize phenol or to generate ˙OH radicals (Fig. 5). The change in optimal NGQD content for the removal of phenol under visible compared to full spectrum irradiation has implications for catalytic design. In photodegradation scenarios with mainly visible light, such as applications utilizing solar irradiation, maximizing NGQD content ensures the most efficient charge generation. In contrast, with the addition of UV wavelengths, composites with decreased NGQD amounts perform better because the NGQD can serve to sterically impede TiO2 surface sites. However, if the NGQD proportion is too low, the beneficial charge separation provided by NGQDs is lost, and thus there is an inflection point in the usefulness of NGQDs for increasing the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite. Based on the data in Fig. 9 using full spectrum light, this inflection point occurs between 2% and 4% NGQD content by weight (or approximately when the ratio of NGQDs to TiO2 nanoparticles is 1:1).

4 Conclusions
In summary, we show that a composite material of TiO2 and NGQDs could be formed through a simple hydrothermal reaction. Through this synthesis method, NGQDs were chemically bonded to anatase TiO2 through a Ti–O–C bond as indicated by a 0.5 eV shift in the Ti 2p XPS. Charge separation within the individual materials of the composite was improved via a Z-Scheme hierarchy which led to a 70% increase in the photodegradation of phenol compared to pure TiO2. Increasing the NGQD content in the composite resulted in the increase in visible light absorbance and subsequently increased photocatalytic degradation rates of phenol by over 600%. While increasing NGQD loading always improved performance under visible irradiation, a loading of approximately 2% NGQD by weight TiO2 was found to be optimal for applications involving UV light. The photocurrent response showed a significant enhancement of charge separation gained through the Z-Scheme mechanism, with anodic or cathodic operation being possible from the same sample depending on irradiation source. With the ability to control the generation of majority charge carriers, TiO2–NGQDs have significant potential not only in photocatalysis, but also in far reaching applications such as energy harvesting and water splitting.
