    , Accepted 20th June 2022First published on 22nd June 2022AbstractZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterostructure nanoparticles were prepared via a facile ultrasonic method and characterized using various techniques. The photocatalytic activity of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles was investigated for the degradation of organic pollutants (methyl orange and bisphenol A) under visible-light irradiation. An enhanced photocatalytic efficiency was observed within 75 minutes compared with the individual constituents. A mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The cytotoxicity of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles was tested against the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), the human colorectal cancer cell line (HCT116) and the normal human foreskin fibroblast cell line (HFF). More cytotoxicity was observed against the fibroblast cell line. The antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were also examined against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and the yeast Candida albicans. It was observed that MDR-PA was more susceptible to ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles than MRSA and Candida albicans. Furthermore, the effect of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles on biofilm formation by MDR-PA, MRSA and Candida albicans was also studied. The results indicated that the inhibition of biofilm production by MDR-PA was higher than for MRSA and yeast under similar conditions.
1 Introduction
Environmental pollution is a worldwide issue affecting the lives of humans and aquatic species. The presence of organic pollutants such as dyes, pesticides, personal care products and pharmaceuticals in water is an emergent challenge. Due to rapid increases in populations and industries, environmental toxic waste is also increasing rapidly and is becoming a universal problem. These wastes contain high concentrations of toxic substances that have deleterious effects on the health of living organisms. Currently, photocatalysis offers a promising approach to the numerous waste-water remediation challenges and represents an effective strategy that is eco-friendly, non-toxic, and stable for pollution control.1–7 Thus, researchers worldwide are trying to find suitable photocatalysts that are capable of decomposing a wide variety of organic pollutants.
Semiconductor photocatalysts have been proposed and used for the management of organic pollutants in water. For example, TiO2 is used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants, although its practical applications remain restricted due to its broad band gap, poor recovery, poor quantum efficiency and fast recombination of the photogenerated electron pairs.8,9 These issues can be resolved by designing visible-light-active photocatalysts or via a combination of different materials to build a heterojunction/heterostructure.7,10
Recently, spinel nanostructured materials have attracted much attention due to their wide applications.11–13 They are an alternative to noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, easy availability and enhanced activities.14,15 In particular, the spinel ZnCo2O4 has received enormous attention due to its narrow band gap, non-toxicity, Earth abundance and low cost. Furthermore, bimetallic cobalt oxides such as ZnCo2O4 exhibit good electron conductivity, photoelectrochemical stability and have a richer redox activity than monometallic transition metal oxides such as Co3O4 and ZnO.16,17 Recently, Zhang et al.18 reported that a 10%-ZnCo2O4/g-C3N4 mixture has a superior performance in H2 generation compared with ZnO and Co3O4 supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4).
This enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated carriers. Therefore, ZnCo2O4 has been extensively used in lithium-ion batteries, energy storage, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.19–22 To improve the photocatalytic activity and photo-efficiency of ZnCo2O4, it is usually combined with other semiconductors such as Bi2O3,22 SnO2,23 ZnO,24 TiO2,25 and ZrO2.26
Ag3PO4 is another photoactive material that has received much consideration because of its remarkable photocatalytic activity for solar-energy-conversion applications, which is due to its suitable band gap, strong oxidizing properties, enhanced electron–hole separation and high quantum efficiency.27–32 Ag3PO4 also exhibits a strong photocatalytic oxidation performance due to the built-in electric coupling between PO43− and Ag+ ions, which is conductive to charge transmission.33,34
Motivated by these desirable properties, we have decided to combine these two polar materials and we incorporated Ag3PO4 into ZnCo2O4 to enhance the overall photocatalytic activity. Thus, herein we report the sonochemical synthesis and subsequent characterization of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterostructure nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared nanocomposite was investigated for the degradation of methyl orange and bisphenol A (BPA) under visible-light irradiation. Both are organic pollutants of high health concern: the former is a mutagenic agent and the latter is known to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Computational studies were carried out to understand the mechanism for this enhanced photoactivity. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite were also explored in its assessment as a possible agent in biomedical applications.
2 Experimental and computational details
Synthesis of ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles
Zinc nitrate and cobalt nitrate (1 and 2 mmol, respectively) were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water in a beaker under stirring for 10 minutes. Then, 6 mmol of urea and 5 mmol of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) were added and stirring was continued further. The mixture was then sonicated for 45 min, in a 10 s pulse-on/off mode under a sonication frequency of 20 Hz. The obtained product was centrifuged, washed with water/ethanol and dried overnight.
Synthesis of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite
0.3 g of ZnCo2O4 was dispersed in 30 mL of water by ultra-sonication. Then, 0.5 g of silver nitrate (AgNO3) was added to it and sonication was continued for 10–15 minutes, followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4). The mixture was sonicated for a further 40 minutes. The product was centrifuged, washed and dried. The estimated molar ratio of Ag3PO4/ZnCo2O4 is about 2.426.
Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku) was used to determine the crystal structure of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. A scanning electron microscope (SEM; TESCAN) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used to study the elemental composition and mapping. A field-emission electron microscope (FE-TEM; JEOL) was utilized to observe the morphology and size. The FTIR spectra of the products were recorded using a PerkinElmer infrared spectrometer. UV-visible diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRS) of the nanoparticles were obtained using a JASCO-V-750 spectrophotometer. The surface areas of all the nanoparticles were analyzed using a surface analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 PLUS). Before analysis, the nanoparticles were degassed at 180 °C.
Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activities were investigated against the organic pollutants methyl orange and bisphenol A. 10 mg of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 or ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 were added to 50 mL of methyl orange solution (10 mg L−1) or 100 mg in the case of bisphenol A. In order to ensure proper equilibration between the photocatalysts and the organic pollutants, the mixture was stirred in the dark for half an hour under ambient conditions. After equilibration, the mixture was irradiated using a xenon lamp as the source of visible light. At regular intervals, aliquots were drawn and centrifuged to remove the nanoparticles. The concentration decay of the organic pollutants was monitored in real time by recording their absorbance signal using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (JASCO V-750).
Cytotoxicity study of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
The cytotoxicity of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles was assessed against MCF-7, HCT116 and HFF cell lines (American Type Culture Collection ATCC®), which were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humid chamber. After trypsinization with trypsin–EDTA 0.25%, cells were incubated for 5 minutes at 5% CO2 humidity, then neutralized with DMEM culture medium and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. After 3–6 passages, the cells were plated in 96-well plates at 104 cells per well and maintained in DMEM for 24 h. The cells were individually exposed to various concentrations of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles (0.0625–1.0 mg mL−1) and incubated for 24 h.
The viability assay was checked thrice by adding MTT solution (10 μL) into each well including untreated cells as a positive control. The reaction was performed for 4 h at 37 °C. Afterwards, dimethyl sulfoxide (100 μL) was added and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a SYNERGY Neo2 multi-mode reader (Biotek), and the cell viability was computed asCell viability (%) = (Abssample/Abscontrol) × 100.
Anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-biofilm evaluation
The anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-biofilm properties of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were studied against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans. The bacteriostatic, bactericidal and fungicidal potential of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles was investigated using a standard microbroth dilution procedure.35 Briefly, a 20 μL freshly grown culture of each tested organism (0.5 Macfarland) was inoculated in 180 μL of BHI broth containing various concentrations of nanoparticles for 24 h at 37 °C. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), and the bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) were also determined.36
Inhibition of biofilm formation
The biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Candida albicans after exposure to the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles was quantitatively examined using a standard 96-well plate crystal violet assay.37 In brief, 20 μL of a fresh bacterial culture (MRSA, MDR-PA or C. albicans) was inoculated with 180 μL of various concentrations (250 to 31.25 μg mL−1) of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles for 24 h. After incubation, the suspension was discarded and gently washed with PBS and dried. Thereafter, the biofilm was stained with crystal violet, then washed with PBS and dried. After solubilizing the stained biofilm in ethanol, the optical density was recorded at 595 nm36 to determine the extent of biofilm inhibition.
Computational details
First-principles calculations were computed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudo-potential method38 as implemented in the VASP code39–42 (version 5.3.5). The maximum kinetic energy cutoff was 400 eV. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional43 was used as the starting point in our density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is well known that straight generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals generally underestimate the band gaps, particularly in transition metal oxides (as the ones investigated here). Therefore, accurate electronic properties were computed at the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) level44 for Ag3PO4 using a 1/3 fraction of the Hartree–Fock exchange as recently suggested by Reunchan et al.45 For ZnCo2O4, we ran PBE+U calculations according to Dudarev's approach46 by adding a Hubbard correction term of 2 eV to the Co 3d orbitals to open the electronic band gap. This approach was recently advocated by Huang et al.47 who showed that ZnCo2O4 is not a heavily correlated system and features a direct band gap of about 1.3 eV, smaller than other reported experimental and theoretical values. The Ag ([Kr] 4d10 5s1), P ([Ne] 3s2 3p3), Zn ([Ar] 3d10 4s2), Co ([Ar] 3d8 4s1), and O (1s2 2s2 2p6) valence and semicore electrons were explicitly considered in our calculations. We used a converged 8 × 8 × 8 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack48k-point grid, which yields a total of 35 irreducible k-points for both Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4. Convergence of the electronic self-consistency field (SCF) cycle was reached whenever the change in the total energy between two consecutive steps was below 10−7 eV. We used a spin-paired mode and a 0.01 eV electronic smearing in all calculations.
The semiconductors were modeled using the Cartesian coordinates derived from their respective experimental bulk lattice constants. Ag3PO4 (a = 6.026 Å, space group #218, P3n, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) No. 14000) is a cubic crystal consisting of tetrahedral phosphate (PO43−) and AgO4 units (Fig. 1a). The main bond lengths (in Å) are P–O (1.545), Ag–Ag (3.013), and Ag–O (2.382). The unit cell consists of two formula units (a total of 16 atoms) in a volume of 218.82 Å3, which yields a mass density of 6.35 g cm−3.

The ZnCo2O4 crystal (a = 8.09462 Å, space group #227, Fdm) is a normal cubic spinel consisting of ZnO4 tetrahedra and CoO6 octahedral units (Fig. 1b) with the following main bond lengths (in Å): Co–O (1.931), Zn–O (1.921), Co–Co (2.862), and Zn–Zn (3.505). The primitive cell comprises 8 formula units of type AB2O4, which gives a total of 56 atoms in a volume of 530.38 Å3, and a mass density of 6.19 g cm−3.
To investigate the possible impact of the geometry on the electronic band structure, we optimized without any constraint the unit cell and internal coordinates of the Ag3PO4 crystal at its experimental coordinates. Long-range van der Waals interactions were included as recommended by Lipsky et al.49via Grimme's-D3 semiempirical method with Becke–Jonson damping.50,51 The relaxed geometry is found to be in excellent agreement with the initial experimental structure. After optimization, the lattice constant was slightly contracted to 5.955 Å, which is less than 1.2% of variation relative to the experimental value (6.026 Å), and hence the variation in the internal coordinates is small. The changes in the band structure were also minimal. Therefore, all computational results presented here were calculated using the experimental crystal structures as no previous electronic structure calculations were reported on these particular geometries. The Cartesian coordinates of these crystal structures are given in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
Characterization of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
The XRD patterns for ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 are shown in Fig. 1 (top). The peaks at 18.94°, 31.17°, 34.42°, 36.75°, 38.43°, 44.72°, 47.61°, 55.53°, 59.24°, 65.12°, 67.92°, and 78.32° could be indexed to the faces (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (422), (511), (440), (531), and (622), respectively, of ZnCo2O4 [ICDD card no. 00-023-1390], confirming the presence of a cubic structure. The diffraction peaks at 21.14°, 29.95°, 33.55°, 36.84°, 42.74°, 48.05°, 52.94°, 53.28°, 55.26°, 57.86°, 61.89°, 66.07°, 70.54°, 72.55°, 74.51°, and 77.95° are also well matched with the faces (110), (200), (210), (211), (220), (310), (222), (320), (321), (400), (330), (420), (421), (332), and (422), respectively, of Ag3PO4 [ICDD card no. 00-006-0505], indicating cubic structure. The XRD pattern of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 shows a combination of the diffraction peaks of the ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4 constituents. Furthermore, sharp diffraction peaks indicate the crystalline nature of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterostructures. In addition, no other diffraction peaks are observed, which confirms the purity of the product. A polyhedral representation of these crystal structures is given in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Fig. S0 (ESI†) shows the simulated XRD patterns of the geometries used in our calculations, and excellent agreement with our experimental XRD spectra is found.
The microstructure, morphology and size of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite were probed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, HRTEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fig. 2a and b show the TEM images of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, which clearly indicate a flake-like structure with average diameters of 10–50 nm. Fig. 2d shows the Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4. Furthermore, different lattice strips can be observed in the nanocomposite. The SEM image presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the microstructure of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4.

As shown in the HRTEM image in Fig. 2c, the lattice fringes of 0.287 nm and 0.268 nm correspond to the (220) and (210) faces of ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis indicates the expected presence of Zn, Co, Ag, P and O in the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, elemental mapping was conducted to further describe the atomic distribution and combination of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite and are presented in the Fig. 3. The results indicated the purity and successful synthesis of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 photocatalyst.

FTIR analysis of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 was also carried out to retrieve information about the bonding, functional groups and molecular structure of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. The absorption bands of ZnCo2O4 at 559.65 and 660.91 cm−1 (green line) can be attributed to the Co–O and Zn–O metal oxide vibrations, respectively.52,53 The spectrum of Ag3PO4 (red line) shows prominent peaks at 543.65 cm−1 (due to the O–P–O bending normal mode) and at 940.87 cm−1 (assigned to the antisymmetric stretching of the four P–O bonds).54 These are in good agreement with our preliminary ab initio phonon calculations of Ag3PO4 at the Γ point, which show infrared-active bands at 517.02 cm−1 and 951.85 cm−1, respectively. The ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 peak positions (black line) are located in the same vicinity for both pure ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4, indicating that the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are composed of pure ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4, which is consistent with our XRD and EDX findings (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 4  (a) FTIR spectra, and (b) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. 
BET analysis of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 was performed to record the surface area and pore size distribution via N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. 4b shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and indicates that ZnCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 exhibit a type III isotherm with hysteresis loops. Fig. 4b also shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm for Ag3PO4, and it is clear that Ag3PO4 shows N2 adsorption–desorption due to its non-porous structure. The BET surface area of ZnCo2O4 further indicates that the nanoparticles are mesoporous.55 ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 showed surface area values of 26.07 m2 g−1, 2.68 m2 g−1 and 6.29 m2 g−1, respectively, while the pore volumes were 21.34 cm3 g−1, 0.0006 cm3 g−1 and 0.042 cm3 g−1. The results indicate that in the nanocomposite (ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4), the surface area and pore volume are decreased. This could be ascribed to the high dispersion of Ag3PO4 on the ZnCo2O4 surface as well as its embedment into the inner channels of ZnCo2O4 (Fig. 4b). Therefore, ZnCo2O4 is providing more surface area to accommodate Ag3PO4, which is able to absorb more methyl orange or bisphenol A and provide more active sites for the reaction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

Fig. 5a shows the UV-visible diffuse-reflectance spectrum (DRS) of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 composite recorded in the range of 200–800 nm. It can be observed that all materials exhibited absorbance in the visible range. The band gap can be calculated using the Tauc formula56(αhν)2/n = A(hν − Eg),where α is the absorption coefficient of the semiconductor, h is Plank's constant, ν is the light frequency, A is an energy-independent proportionality constant that is characteristic of the material, and Eg is the optical band gap. The exponent n determines the nature of the optical transition, with values of n = 4 and n = 1 indicating indirect and direct allowed absorptions, respectively. The indirect and direct transition band gaps were determined via Tauc plots of (αhν)0.5 and (αhν)2, respectively, vs. hν (Fig. 5b–d). The optical band gap (Eg) values for ZnCo2O4 (direct allowed transition), Ag3PO4 (indirect allowed transition) and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 (direct transition) were 1.60, 2.30 and 1.64 eV, respectively. From Fig. 5a, we note that the spectrum of the nanocomposite (black line) resembles the spectrum of our pure ZnCo2O4 sample (red line), even though it is the minor component in the mixture. Therefore, it makes sense to perform a Tauc plot of the nanocomposite using (αhν)2 on the vertical axis (Fig. 5d). We attribute this observation to the spatial heterogeneity of the mixture and that we probably measured the optical absorbance in regions heavily dominated by the ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles rather than by the Ag3PO4 nanoparticles.

Calculated band structure for Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4 crystals

Fig. 6a shows the calculated band structure for the Ag3PO4 crystal at the hybrid HSE06 level with a 1/3 fraction of exact exchange. This value was recommended by Reunchan et al.45 since the standard 1/4 fraction of Hartree–Fock exchange underestimates the band gap down to 1.80 eV (Fig. S2c, ESI†), which is smaller than what is found experimentally (∼2.3–2.4 eV).
 Fig. 6  Calculated electronic properties of the crystals at their experimental geometries. Band structures computed at the (a) HSE06 level for Ag3PO4 and at the (b) PBE+U level for ZnCo2O4. The bottom and top horizontal red lines mark the energy positions of the VBM and CBM levels, respectively. The total and projected electronic density of states (DOS) for Ag3PO4 (c) and ZnCo2O4 (d). All energies are in eV units and are relative to the Fermi level. Isosurface representations of the CBM and VBM are also shown. Colour code: Ag and Zn, grey spheres; Co and P, green spheres; O atoms, red spheres. 
The reciprocal-space fractional coordinates for the main high-symmetry k-points in the band structure for Ag3PO4 are Γ = (0, 0, 0), M = (1/2, 1/2, 0), X = (0, 1/2, 0), and R = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The k-path was taken along the RMGR trajectory. Fig. 6a shows that the Ag3PO4 crystal is an indirect band gap p-type semiconductor with the valence band maximum (VBM) positions at the M point while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at Γ point in the Brillouin zone. Our calculated indirect and direct band gaps are 2.36 eV and 2.50 eV, respectively, with the latter occurring at the Γ point. Our value of 2.36 eV is consistent with the indirect allowed optical band gap extracted from our experimental Tauc plot (2.30 eV, Fig. 5c) as well as with the value of 2.36 eV of Yi et al.57 and the 2.37 eV value recently reported by Lu et al.58 at 1 GPa of pressure. Our value is also very close to the 2.38 eV value from PBE+U plane-wave calculations of Lipsky et al.49 The PBE band structure (Fig. S1a, ESI†) shows indirect and direct band gaps of 0.21 eV and 0.33 eV, respectively, located at the same k-point positions as our hybrid DFT calculations but significantly underestimated relative to our experimental and HSE06 values. The electronic density of states (DOS) in Fig. 6c shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) consists of the mixing of O-2p (pink) with Ag-3d (blue) atomic orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mostly made of Ag-4s (red) and O-2p atomic orbitals.

Fig. 6b shows the calculated band structure for ZnCo2O4 computed along the k-point path WLΓXWK, where Γ = (0, 0, 0), L = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), X = (1/2, 0, 1/2), W = (1/2, 1/4, 3/4), and K = (3/8, 3/8, 3/4) are the high-symmetry k-points. At the PBE+U level of theory, ZnCo2O4 is a nearly direct band gap p-type semiconductor, with the VBM and CBM located around the Γ point. Our calculated band gap of 1.56 eV agrees with the direct allowed optical band gap extracted from our Tauc plot (1.60 eV, Fig. 5b). However, Zhang et al.18 estimated an optical band gap of 1.30 eV from UV-vis diffuse-reflection spectroscopy (DRS) measurements of pure ZnCo2O4. We note that higher band gaps have been reported in the literature from experiments (2.26 eV,59 and 2.63 eV60) and HSE06 calculations (3.72 eV),61 GW (3.99 eV),62 and TB-mBJ (3.355 eV).63 However, Huang et al.64 recently showed that ZnCo2O4 has a direct band gap of about 1.3 eV although its optical transition is weak (dipole forbidden theoretically) and instead a stronger absorption occurs at 2.9 eV, which explains the high transparency of this material in the visible region. The VBM features a rather flat dispersion leading to heavy holes and therefore a poor hole mobility. However, the CBM is highly dispersive leading to mobile electrons which, together with the narrower band gap of ZnCo2O4 compared to Ag3PO4, explains the enhanced photocatalysis of the heterostructure. The DOS plots (Fig. 6d) show that the VBM mostly consists of the mixing of O-2p (red) with Co-3d (cyan) atomic orbitals, while CBM is mostly dominated by Co-3d (cyan). The GGA-PBE band structure (Fig. S2b, ESI†) shows a direct band gap of 0.93 eV at the Γ point that agrees well with the 0.99 eV value of Amini et al.62 and again underestimates the gaps computed via PBE+U calculations.
The charge densities of the CBM and VBM states for Ag3PO4 (corresponding to the Γ and M k-points, respectively, see Fig. 6a) are shown in Fig. 6c. The isosurface representation of the VBM shows the strong participation of 2p-O and 4d-Ag atomic orbitals, while the CBM state consists mostly of the mixing of 2s-O with the 4d and 5s orbitals of Ag (grey spheres). The participation of delocalized 5s-Ag and the strong dispersion of CB (Fig. 6a) are responsible for the light effective mass and large mobility of electrons. For both states, there is almost no participation of the P atoms (green spheres), in agreement with the DOS calculation (Fig. 6c). The single Kohn–Sham state charge densities of the CBM and VBM (isosurface 0.015 a.u.) at the Γ point for ZnCo2O4 are shown in Fig. 6d. The VBM consists of the participation of 3d-Co and 2s-O atomic orbitals, with minimal involvement of the Zn atoms (grey spheres). The CBM features again the involvement of 3d-Co and O atomic orbitals, with again negligible participation of the Zn orbitals.
The atomic charges were computed using the Bader analysis code of Henkelman and co-workers.65–67 For Ag3PO4, the calculated Bader charges (in units of the electron charge) are Ag (0.70), P (3.72), and O (−1.45). Therefore, both P–O and Ag–O bonds have marked ionic character (more significant for the P–O bonds) due to the large differences in electronegativity between these elements. According to the Pauling scale, the electronegativities increase in the following order: Ag (1.93) < P (2.19) < O (3.44). For ZnCo2O4, we obtained the following Bader charges (in units of electron charge): Zn (1.27), Co (1.29), and O (−0.96). Since Zn and Co have similar electronegativity values (1.65 and 1.88, respectively, according to the Pauling scale) they have a similar charge and both transfer a similar electron density to the O atoms.
Photocatalytic activity the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
The photocatalytic activity of ZnCo2O4, Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 was investigated experimentally for the degradation of methyl orange and bisphenol A under visible-light irradiation. The results are presented in Fig. 7 and 8, which show that the degradation of these pollutants in the absence of the photocatalyst is almost negligible, indicating that their degradation occurs only in the presence of the photocatalyst. As compared with the unmixed ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles, the degradation rate was significantly faster and higher in the presence of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction photocatalyst. The high photocatalytic activity of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 could be attributed to the synergistic redox properties of the heterojunction, resulting in a fast and efficient separation of electron–hole pairs and the suppression of electron–hole pair recombination.3,68

 Fig. 8  Photocatalytic activities of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles for the irreversible degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) over 75 minutes (a). Comparison of rate constants (b). 
The degradation kinetics of methyl orange and bisphenol A were quantitatively analyzed to determine the decay rate constants under ambient conditions. It was observed that the reaction kinetics follow a first-order relationshipln(C0/C) = kt,where, respectively, C0 and C are the initial and time-dependent concentrations of the pollutants upon irradiation, t is the time (here, in minutes) and k is the (pseudo) first-order rate constant (in minutes−1). The rate constant values are shown in Fig. 7b and 8b, where it can be seen that ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 exhibits the highest rate constant compared with bare ZnCo2O4 or Ag3PO4 in the degradation of methyl orange and bisphenol A.
Furthermore, to detect the presence of reactive species generated during the photocatalysis process, experiments were conducted with scavenging agents (p-benzoquinone, isopropanol and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, EDTA) in the presence of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 under the same experimental conditions and using methyl orange (Fig. 7c). It was noticed that when the radical quencher p-benzoquinone was introduced into the reaction, it causes a decline in the photocatalytic activity, suggesting that superoxide radicals (˙O2−) play a significant role in the photocatalytic redox process. Similarly, when isopropanol was used in the reaction, the photocatalytic activity of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 was further decreased, indicating that hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) or related species play an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange. The photocatalytic efficiency was slightly decreased in the presence of EDTA, indicating the reduced participation of holes (h+) in the photocatalysis.69,70
Mechanism of the photocatalytic activity

Fig. 9 shows the energy band alignment according to the Mulliken method.71 Using this approach, the potential/energy relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) of the valence band (VB) is given by E(VB) = χ − E(e) + (Eg/2) and the conduction band (CB) is E(CB) = E(VB) − Eg, where χ is the Mulliken absolute electronegativity of the compound and E(e) is the energy of a free electron (∼4.50 eV, relative to NHE). Eg is the calculated DFT electronic band gap, which in our case is 2.36 eV (Fig. 6a) and 1.56 eV (Fig. 6b) for Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4, respectively. Using the Mulliken electronegativities of the elements (i.e., the arithmetic mean of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity) from Pearson72 and a geometric mean of these values, we obtained χ = 5.96 for both Ag3PO4 and ZnCo2O4 materials. Thus, for Ag3PO4, we obtained the values of 2.64 V and 0.28 V for the VB and CB edge potentials relative to NHE, respectively, which match perfectly the values reported by Tseng et al.73 Moreover, Lipsky et al. reported almost identical values (2.65 and 0.27 V, respectively) from PBE+U plane-wave calculations. Our values are also in agreement with those of Reunchan et al. (2.59 and 0.24 V),44 Santos et al. (2.6 and 0.31 V),74 Liu et al. (2.67 and 0.24 V),75 and Ma et al. (2.705 and 0.215 V).76 For ZnCo2O4, we obtained values of 2.24 V and 0.68 V for the VB and CB edge potentials, respectively. Recently, Zhang et al.18 reported the values of 0.85 eV for the VB and −0.45 eV for the CB potentials of pure ZnCo2O4.
 Fig. 9  Mulliken band-energy alignment for the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanocomposite heterojunction and proposed mechanism for its photocatalytic activity. The VB and CB edge potentials (in V) are indicated. The standard reduction potential for O2 to give water (1.23 V vs. NHE) is also marked on the scheme. 
Using the above results we can now propose a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic activity of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterojunction. Fig. 9 shows the mechanism of the charge transfer between the ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. Upon exposure to light, electron–hole (e–h) pairs are generated in both ZnCo2O4 and Ag3PO4 polar materials. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of Ag3PO4 quickly migrate downhill to the CB of ZnCo2O4. This charge migration is facilitated by the large dispersion of the Ag3PO4 CB (Fig. 6a), which results in mobile electrons.
Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in the VB of Ag3PO4 move uphill to the VB of ZnCo2O4. As a result, the recombination of e–h pairs in Ag3PO4 is suppressed and the overall photocatalytic activity is enhanced. Moreover, if the recombination rate of e–h pairs in ZnCo2O4 is kinetically slow, it leads to an accumulation of charge carriers on its surface which can then readily engage in redox reactions. For example, Fig. 9 shows that in principle both semiconductor VBs can spontaneously reduce diatomic oxygen gas to produce liquid water according to 1/2O2 (g) + 2H+ (aq) + 2e− → H2O (l), which has a reduction potential of 1.23 V vs. NHE. However, the CB potentials are not low enough to reduce protons and release H2 gas (2H+ (aq) + 2e− → H2 (g); 0.0 V vs. NHE), and nor can they reduce dissolved O2 to produce the superoxide ion ˙O2− in solution (O2 (aq) + e− → ˙O2− (aq); −0.18 V). The reduction of O2 gas to aqueous superoxide ions is even more difficult. The reductant power of the CBs is not low enough to reduce liquid water to yield H2 gas and hydroxyl ions in solution (H2O (l) + 2e− → H2 (g) + 2 OH− (aq); −0.83 V). Meanwhile, the holes at the surface of Ag3PO4 can easily oxidize adsorbed molecules with oxidation potentials less than 2.64 V vs. NHE. For example, hydroxyl ions can be oxidized to generate hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals (−OH/˙OH; −2.02 V), which can then degrade methyl orange or bisphenol A.2,77 The VB edge potential of Ag3PO4 is positive enough to oxidize water and produce hydroxyl radicals (H2O (l) → ˙OH (aq) + H+ (aq) + e−; 2.38 V vs. SHE).
Cytotoxicity study of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
The MTT assay78,79 was employed to study the cytotoxicity of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles. MCF-7, HCT116 and HFF cells were treated with various concentrations (0.0625–1.0 mg mL−1) of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles for 24 h as described in the Experimental section. In all cases, the results revealed a high cytotoxic activity for ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles toward MCF-7, HCT116 and HFF cells, even at low concentrations (0.0625 mg mL−1, see Fig. 10–12). The microscope images of MCF-7, HCT116 and HFF cells treated with ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 10–12. It has been noticed that the cells show remarkable changes in morphology compared to the control. However, it was not possible to calculate the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) due to the strong cytotoxicity of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles even after dilution.

Antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles
The standard microbroth dilution method was employed to test the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and C. albicans. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles against MDR-PA, MRSA and C. albicans were 0.75, 1 and 1.25 mg mL−1, respectively. Furthermore, it was noticed that the MBC value of MDR-PA (3 mg mL−1) was lower than MRSA (4 mg mL−1). In the case of C. albicans, the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) value was 5 mg mL−1 (Fig. 13). These results indicate that MDR-PA was more vulnerable to ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles than MRSA and C. albicans. This might be due to differences in the cell wall composition.

Inhibition of biofilm formation
The effects of the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles on the biofilm formation of MDR-PA, MRSA and C. albicans are shown in Fig. 14. The biofilm production of MDR-PA was inhibited by 79.8, 86.2, 86.4, and 87.2%, when exposed to 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg mL−1 of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4, respectively. However, under similar conditions, the biofilm inhibition of Gram-positive MRSA was slightly lower than for Gram-negative bacteria, and it was found that the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles inhibit the biofilm formation of MRSA by 49.2, 75.87, 76.74 and 78.84%, respectively, at ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 doses of 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg mL−1. The effect of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 on the biofilm formation of C. albicans was almost similar to that of Gram-negative bacteria and it was inhibited by 79.02, 81.08, 82.39 and 83.91% at 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg mL−1 of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4, respectively. Fig. 14 clearly shows that ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles inhibit biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner.

4 Conclusions
ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterostructure nanoparticles were prepared via facile ultrasonic methods and fully characterized using several methods including XRD, EDX, TEM, BET analysis, IR, and UV-Vis. The nanocomposite demonstrated an efficient photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of organic pollutants (methyl orange and bisphenol A) under visible-light irradiation. Using extensive density functional theory calculations (DFT) we proposed a mechanism to explain this enhanced photocatalytic activity. Moreover, ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 showed cytotoxicity against the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), human colon colorectal cells (HCT116) and a normal human foreskin fibroblast cell line (HFF). MDR-PA was more susceptible to ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles than MRSA and yeast (C. albicans). The biofilm-formation results indicate that the inhibition of biofilm production by multidrug resistant bacteria P. aeruginosa was higher than MRSA and C. albicans under similar conditions. Therefore, the ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 heterostructure represents a promising and versatile photocatalytic material for the decomposition of organic pollutants and pathogens, with possible applications in water remediation and medical uses as a disinfecting agent. Future studies will include determining the optimal ratio of ZnCo2O4/Ag3PO4 for maximum photocatalytic efficiency.
