    , Accepted 6th August 2020First published on 7th August 2020AbstractManganese ion doped CsPbX3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) demonstrate high absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light and efficient orange emission with a large Stokes shift, and are almost transparent to visible light, which are ideal photon energy converters for solar cells. In this work, Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs were synthesized by incorporating a long-chain ammonium ligand dodecyl dimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), in which the DDAC ligand not only played the role of replacing the surface ligands of QDs, but also enhanced the efficiency and stability of Mn2+ ion doped QDs. The as-prepared QD sample displayed a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 91% and served as a photon energy converter for silicon solar cells (SSCs). The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of SSCs increased from 19.64% to 20.65% with a relative enhancement of 5.14%. This work displays a method to tune the efficiency of QDs by modifying the surface ligands and an efficient photon energy converter for SSCs, which is of great importance for practical applications.
Introduction
Silicon solar cells (SSCs) are the most efficient and mature photoelectric transformation devices, which have been widely used all over the world.1–3 The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of most commercial SSCs ranges from 10 to 25.6% with a photoelectric response from 300 to 1000 nm, which is far from the 31% maximum theoretical efficiency of SSCs under AM 1.5G illumination.4,5 The limitation of photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) for SSCs can be attributed to the low spectral response in the ultraviolet (UV) region (300–400 nm).6,7 Tandem solar cells, such as perovskite/silicon solar cells and polymer/perovskite solar cells, have been considered as the effective solution to solve this problem.8,9 However, the fabrication technology of tandem solar cells is complicated and expensive.10 Photon energy conversion, which can convert UV light to visible or infrared light by efficient luminescent materials, is considered as an effective approach due to the simple structure, low-cost fabrication, ambient operation, and long-term stability.11 A good photon energy converter requires to display high light absorption in the UV wavelength, high quantum yield, extraordinary transparency in the visible region, and a large Stokes shift to reduce the self-reabsorption losses.
All-inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have attracted a lot of research interest, owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, including tunable photoluminescence outputs and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs);12 Especially, CsPbCl3 quantum dots (QDs) with a wide band gap larger than 3 eV appear to be an ideal photon energy converter for SSCs.8 However, the instability and the low efficiency of CsPbCl3 QDs limit their application as a photon energy converter. And, the relatively small Stokes shift of CsPbCl3 QDs brings about significant self-reabsorption loss. The response of SSCs at 402 nm is also relatively low, which is unfavorable for photon energy conversion. Therefore, a photon energy converter with a large Stokes shift is necessary. Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs have been developed and show broadband emission at 600 nm, enhanced PLQY and enhanced structural stability.
Mn2+ ion doped CsPbX3 with a dual-color emission was first fabricated by Klimov's group by a hot-injection method, with a maximum PLQY of 27% for QDs containing 9.6% Mn (relative to Pb), leading to an overall yellow-orange color of the emission.13 And a strong Mn2+ ion luminescence was realized later,14 in which excitons were strongly coupled with Mn2+ ions and efficient energy transfer happened between them. Moreover, the cation ratio of Mn2+ to Pb2+ could be driven by the halide anion exchange at room temperature,15 and the effect of Mn2+ ion doping on excitonic properties was studied.16 Over the past few years, most of the research on enhancing the photoluminescence of Mn2+ ion intensity is just by increasing the concentration of Mn2+, which may produce more impurities due to the unfitted ionic radius. Furthermore, the strong Mn2+–Mn2+ interactions will cause a decrease of PLQY at a higher concentration of Mn2+ ions.17 Such Mn2+ ion clusters induce the formation of defects in the QD host, which can enhance the electron capture ability and lead to non-radiative recombination.
For the quantum dot materials with a large surface to volume ratio, the modification of the surface ligands is also an effective method to tune the stability and optical properties. Pan et al. realized highly stable CsPbX3 QD films capped with shorter ligands to enhance the performances of perovskite QD-LEDs.18 Incorporating a trioctylphosphine oxide branched capping ligand into the traditional oleic acid/oleylamine system has been demonstrated to achieve excellent optoelectronic properties and enhance the stability greatly.19 Furthermore, Sargent's group provided a strategy that utilized tetraoctylammonium halides for the preparation of OA-capped CsPbX3 perovskite QDs, enhancing the colloidal stability of the solution.20
In the current work, Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs were synthesized via a modified hot-injection method, PbCl2, together with DDAC power were dissolved in OA, OAm and ODE. The as-prepared samples show multi-color emissions, which are contributed by both QD hosts and the doped Mn2+ ions. It is found that the introduction of DDAC could substitute a portion of OA and OAm ligands with the DDAC ligand, which can not only improve the intensity of exciton emission and Mn2+ ion emission, but also greatly enhance the stability of QDs. The introduction of DDAC can passivate the Cl vacancy defects and promote the formation of stable QDs. Ultimately, an optimum PLQY of 91% was obtained with 10% excitonic emission and 81% Mn2+ ion emission. The as-prepared ligand-modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 film served as the photon energy converter to enhance the PCE of SSCs. The PCE of SSCs increased from 19.64% to 20.65% with 5.14% relative enhancement.
Results and discussion
Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs with the cubic phase were synthesized following a modified hot-injection method. In the preparation, PbCl2, MnCl2, and DDAC were dissolved in a mixture of oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OAm) and octadecene (ODE), then cesium oleate was injected swiftly, and the reaction solution was kept 30 s for growing the perovskite QDs. The ligand exchange mechanism is shown in Scheme 1. Differing from the typical synthesis of perovskite QDs in the OA and OAm system, the DDAC was used as the additional long-chain ammonium ligand to participate in the formation of perovskite QDs (see the Experimental Section in the ESI† for details). As shown in Fig. 1a, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs added with different DDAC stoichiometry (0–0.3 mmol) were characterized, which showed the narrow size distribution and the pure cubic morphology. With the amount of the DDAC ligand added increasing, the average particle sizes of QDs increased from 11.1 ± 0.5 nm to 11.2 ± 0.5 nm. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images for non-DDAC and 0.2 mmol DDAC added samples are shown in Fig. 1b. The interplanar distances of the (110) crystal plane for Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs without and with 0.3 mmol DDAC added are both 0.42 nm, indicating that the introduction of DDAC does not change the perovskite lattice structure. The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the as-prepared samples in Fig. 1c show four main peaks at around 15.8°, 22.4°, 31.9° and 39.3°, corresponding to the (100), (110), (200) and (211) crystal planes, respectively, confirming the formation of a perovskite cubic structure (PDF# 75-0408). The (110) crystal plane diffraction peaks slightly shift toward the small-angle side with increasing the content of the DDAC ligand, owing to the increase of the particle size of QDs. No other obvious phase pattern exists, proving that the crystal structure of Mn2+ ion doped QDs has not been significantly affected by the addition of the DDAC ligand.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to detect the presence of ligands of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs with no DDAC and with 0.2 mmol DDAC added. As shown in Fig. 2a, the non-DDAC QD sample shows two distinct absorption bands at 2850 and 2920 cm−1, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of –CH2 and –CH3 groups, respectively, which come from the OA and OAm ligands.21 And the 0.2 mmol DDAC added QD sample has similar characteristic absorption vibration peaks, but they are weaker. Two characteristic peaks at 1635 and 908 cm−1 can also be seen in the two samples, which can be assigned to the asymmetric –NH3+ of OAm. Moreover, the FTIR spectra for the non-DDAC QD sample shows an N–H stretching mode at 3321 cm−1, indicating the presence of OAm on the QD surface. However, the characteristic bands of N–H in OAm disappear in the FTIR spectra of the QD sample with the addition of 0.2 mmol DDAC. Therefore, we infer that a ligand substitution process may be caused by DDAC, which can change the surface properties of QDs. As the DDA+ has large steric hindrance due to the branched structure, a portion of cations will be attached on the surface of the QDs, which leads to a Cl−-rich surface.22,23 Then the Cl vacancy defects can be passivated, which could increase the PL efficiency and stability of the Mn2+ doped QDs.

(c and d) High-resolution XPS analysis corresponding to N and Mn elements for Mn2+ ion doped QDs with no DDAC and Mn2+ ion doped QDs with 0.2 mmol concentration of DDAC, respectively. 
To further verify our supposition, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectra of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs without and with the addition of 0.2 mmol DDAC were recorded and are plotted in Fig. 2b–d and Fig. S1.† They indicate the presence of constituent elements of Mn, C and N in non-DDAC and 0.2 mmol DDAC samples. The HR-XPS spectra of N element for the two QD samples are presented in Fig. 2c. For the non-DDAC QD sample, the HR-XPS spectra center at 402.2 eV and 405.4 eV, representing an amine group (–NH2) and a protonated amine group (–NH3+), respectively.24,25 In contrast, for the 0.2 mmol DDAC added QD sample, only a single peak in the HR-XPS spectra centered at 401.8 eV can be seen, which is attributed to the tert-ammonium cations from the DDAC ligand. This means that the –NH3+ group components containing N element on the surface of perovskite QDs were substituted by the DDA+ ligand in the DDAC-modified QDs. Moreover, in the HR-XPS spectra, the intensity of Cl element shows an obvious enhancement after the addition of 0.2 mmol DDAC, indicating that more Cl− ions have been introduced, which can passivate the chlorine vacancy defects.
In order to probe the influence of DDAC on the optical properties of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs, the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the as-prepared purified colloidal solution samples are measured, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The introduction of DDAC ligands has a slight effect on the shape and position of the spectra. In Fig. 3a, the UV-absorption peak shifts toward red with increasing the stoichiometry of DDAC, due to the gradually increased bandgap from 3.01 eV in the non-DDAC sample to 3.08 eV in QDs with 0.3 mmol DDAC added (Fig. S2†). This can be attributed to the changes in the crystal structure or some atomic doping effect.26 Under 365 nm UV light excitation, the PL emission spectra (Fig. 3b) for the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs capped with DDAC exhibit a dual-color emission, which can be assigned to the exciton recombination radiation and Mn2+ ion emission, respectively. The excitation spectra were selectively monitored at the peak position of Mn2+ ions (602 nm), which matches closely with the excitonic absorption of the CsPbCl3 QD host (Fig. S3†), confirming that the emissions of Mn2+ ions are sensitized mainly by the CsPbCl3 QD host. As shown in Fig. 3b, the optical properties of the as-prepared Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QD samples are strongly related to the concentration of the DDAC ligand. The excitonic emission peak shifts to lower energy with increasing the DDAC concentration, and an obvious decrease in the intensity of excitonic emission was observed compared with the non-DDAC sample. Furthermore, another PL peak centered at 602 nm can be observed, which is associated with the intrinsic electronic transitions: 4T1 → 6A1 for Mn2+ ion broadband emission.14,27 With increasing the amount of DDAC from 0 to 0.2 mmol, the intensity of Mn2+ emission increases, which can be attributed to the passivation of the defects by the introduction of DDAC. It is known that the defects in CsPbCl3 QDs are related to Cl− vacancies, which act as nonradiative recombination centers, inducing a low excitonic emission efficiency. The DDAC introduced more Cl− ions and thus formed a Cl-rich environment, and reduced the density of Cl vacancies, which inhibited the defect-related nonradiative recombination. In addition, the intensity ratio of Mn2+ ions to exciton emission changes from 5:1 to 11:1 for Mn2+ ion doped QDs and the Mn2+ ion doped QDs with 0.2 mmol DDAC added, respectively. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was employed to quantify the Mn2+ ion doping content, as shown in Fig. S3.† With increasing the content of DDAC, the doping concentration of Mn2+ ion changes little. The intensity of Mn2+ emission shows a decreasing trend beyond the 0.3 mmol DDAC concentration, which can be attributed to that the over substitution of DDA+ ligands may induce an unexpected change of the perovskite structure.16,28,29Fig. 3c presents the PL decay curves of Mn2+ ions for all the as-prepared QD samples. Each curve can be described by the single exponential decay function. The PL of Mn2+ ions decays slower with increasing the amount of DDAC from 0 to 0.3 mmol, which can be attributed to the decreased nonradiative recombination by the defect passivation.30 To further investigate the influence of DDAC on Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs, radiative transition rate (Rr) and non-radiative transition rate (Rnr) were calculated (Table 1). With increasing the content of DDAC from 0 to 0.2 mmol, the Rr increases from 0.061 to 0.126 ns−1, whereas the Rnr decreases from 0.035 to 0.013 ns−1, indicating that DDAC promotes the radiation recombination rate and inhibits the non-radiation recombination rate. And the defect density of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs modified with different contents of DDAC has been calculated according to following equation: (1)where ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity of the QDs, respectively, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the elementary electronic charge, and L is the thickness of the obtained QD film.31 In Fig. 3d, the initial trap density of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs is around 5.85 × 1016 cm−3, and the value quickly decreases to 1.28 × 1016 cm−3 for the QDs modified with 0.2 mmol DDAC, which suggests that the defect density has been substantially decreased upon the incorporation of DDAC.

The optical performances for the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs are further evaluated by the measurement of PLQY, as shown in Fig. 3e, in which the Mn2+ ion transition, exciton transition of the perovskite host and their overall emissions as a function of DDAC concentration were demonstrated. The overall PLQY of Mn2+ ion emissions increases firstly and then reaches the optimum at 0.2 mmol of DDAC, and starts to decrease with further increasing the concentration of DDAC. The optimum PLQY of Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs is up to 91% at 0.2 mmol concentration of DDAC, with 10% excitonic emission and 81% Mn2+ ion emission, which is the most efficient up to now among the various Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QD materials obtained using different synthesis methods (Table S1†). The mixed halide perovskite Mn2+ ion doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 QDs were further synthesized by the fast anion-exchange reaction method.32 In the preparation, PbBr2 was mixed with ODE as the bromine source, then the bromine source was added into the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QD solution, and a part of Br− replaced Cl− and formed the Mn2+ ion doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 QDs. Their PL emission spectra are shown in Fig. S5.† The excitonic peaks shift toward red due to varied optical band gaps by the introduction of bromine ions. The peak intensity ratio of excitons to Mn2+ ions increases as the content of Br− increases. This method could be used to tune the spectral range by mixing perovskite QDs with halide source solution.
As shown by the PL decay curve spectra in Fig. S5,† the average decay lifetime of exciton recombination gradually increases after introducing DDAC, proving that DDAC inhibits the nonradiative recombination in the perovskite host through the passivation of defects. Furthermore, the PL stability of the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs without and with 0.2 mmol of DDAC added is compared under the same atmospheric conditions (Fig. 3f). The PL intensity of pure CsPbCl3 QDs decreased by 30% after aging for 50 days, whereas that of the non-DDAC Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs decreased by 30% after aging for 60 days; moreover, it took 80 days for the QDs with the addition of 0.2 mmol DDAC to result in the same decrease of initial PL intensity. The stability has a great improvement in the DDAC added QD sample owing to the following two reasons. (i) DDA+ with two long hydrocarbon chains is known to form more stable monolayers because of a good match between the molecule cross section and the typical densities of negatively charged surface sites. (ii) DDAC introduced more Cl− ions to reduce the Cl vacancies. The properties of the as-prepared QD films are evaluated for device fabrication (Fig. S6†). The Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QD film maintains similar optical performances to its corresponding QDs, and only exhibits a little decrease of PLQY in the film owing to the aggregation of the particles in the film,33 which indicates that the QD film is suitable for fabricating photoelectric devices.
The efficient ligand-modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs were explored as a downconverter to enhance the performance of the commercial crystalline silicon solar cells (SSCs). A good downconverter layer needs to display high light absorption in the UV wavelength, high quantum yield, extraordinary transparency in the visible region, and a large Stokes shift to reduce the self-reabsorption losses. The Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs have a wide band gap of about 3 eV and emit at 602 nm, which are the ideal candidate. The absorption spectra of the Mn2+ ion doped QD film with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. S8,† which display an increasing absorption intensity with increasing thickness. However, there is an equilibrium between the absorption of UV light and transmittance to visible and NIR light. The Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs were self-assembled on the surface of the SSCs (area: 2 cm × 2 cm) via liquid-phase deposition (inset schematic of Fig. 4a). The optical transmittance of the ligand modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 film (250 nm thickness) is above 95% in the visible region (Fig. 4a). The increase of short-circuit current (ΔIsc) in the SSCs induced by the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 film can be estimated by the transmittance spectrum and IPCE, as the following equation, (2)where q is the electron charge, F(λ) is the incident photon flux density (AM 1.5, ASTM G173) at wavelength λ, and IPCE (602 nm) is the IPCE response around 602 nm. As the emission of Mn2+ ions is broadband, the IPCE in this region floats around 93 to 96%. A(λ) is the absorption coefficient of QDs. T(film) is the transmittance of the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 film after considering the absorption of PQDs and the sub band gap scattering, which varies from 95% to 98%. The calculated ΔIsc in theory is 2.72–2.92 mA cm−2. Fig. 4b shows the I–V curves of the SSCs coated with different perovskite films. The PCE of the SSC in our experiment is 19.64%, with a short-circuit current of 39.83 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage of 0.636 V. The performance of perovskite QD-coated samples with thicknesses of 120, 250 and 390 nm increases to different contents. For the SSCs with 250 nm perovskite QDs, the PCE reaches 20.65%, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.633 V and a short-circuit current of 41.89 mA cm−2 (Table 2), which is enhanced by 5.14% relatively. The increase of short-circuit current (ΔIsc) is 2.06 mA cm−2, which is lower than the theoretical results. This can be mainly attributed to the insufficient absorption of the converted light by SSCs and nonoptimal thickness. Assuming that the 250 nm thickness is the optimum condition, the absorption percentage of the converted light for SSCs is about 70.5 to 75.7%. The statistical distributions of the PCE of 10 SSCs with 250 nm perovskite QDs were measured randomly as shown in Fig. 4c. The PCEs of SSCs distributed in the range of 19.20–19.65% and increased to 20.30–20.65% with a 250 nm downconverter.

To analyze the mechanism of the enhancement of PCEs, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve (Fig. 4d) shows a considerable improvement of the photoelectric responses ranging from 300 to 410 nm after coating with the Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 film, which can be attributed to the effective photon energy conversion from UV to visible by the perovskite film. The short-circuit current (Isc) under solar illumination can be predicted by convolution of the IPCE spectra with the photon flux density distribution for 1 sun as the following equation, (3)where q is the electron charge, F(λ) is the incident photon flux density (AM 1.5, ASTM G173) at wavelength λ, and IPCE (λ) is the IPCE response at λ. In the IPCE experiment, the λ ranges from 300 to 1100 nm. The Isc at λ was integrated from 300 nm to λ nm. The calculated Isc was 39.67 and 41.71 mA cm−2 for the original SSC and the perovskite film coated SSC respectively, which agreed well with the I–V results.
The long-term stability of the original SSC and ligand modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 coated SSC was also studied (Fig. S9 and S10†). It can be seen that PCEs of the SSC started to decrease after 30 days. After 60 days, the PCE of the SSC still remained at 20.1%. Fig. S9b† shows the variation of ΔPCE as a function of time, which reveals the contribution of the perovskite converter. ΔPCE is defined as the increase of PCE after introducing the perovskite converter compared to that of the pristine SSC. The variation trend of ΔPCE agrees well with the PL stability in Fig. 3f. Therefore, though the SSC without photon energy converter was stable, the long-term stability can be further enhanced after the modification of ligands (Fig. 3f). The analysis of Jsc, Voc and FF as a function of time in Fig. S10† showed that the variation trend of Jsc was similar to that of PCE in Fig. S9a,† whereas the Voc and FF floated a little and did not display a decreasing trend. This indicates that the decrease of the PCE can be mainly attributed to the degradation of the perovskite converter by reacting with water and oxygen in the air.
Conclusion
In this work, DDAC ligand-modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs were synthesized, in which a portion of OA and OAm ligands were replaced by the DDA+. Owing to the introduction of the DDAC ligand, the PLQY of Mn2+ ions and structural stability were considerably enhanced. The introduction of DDAC can passivate the surface defects by reducing the density of Cl vacancies. Meanwhile, DDA+ with two long hydrocarbon chains promotes the formation of stable QDs because of a good match between the molecule cross section and the typical densities of negatively charged surface sites. The efficient ligand-modified Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 QDs were explored as a downconverter to enhance the performance of the commercial crystalline SSCs, in which the PCE was increased from 19.64 to 20.65% with 5.14% relative enhancement. The enhancement of PCE was mainly induced by the increase of the photoelectric current, which resulted from the conversion of UV light to visible by the Mn2+ doped perovskite converter. This work provides a strategy for the synthesis of highly efficient and long-term stability Mn2+ ion doped CsPbCl3 perovskite QDs and their application as a photon energy converter for SSCs, which is of great importance for practical applications.
