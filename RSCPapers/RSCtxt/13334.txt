    , Accepted 29th June 2015First published on 29th June 2015AbstractOctahedral and cubic NiS2 nanocrystals enclosed by {111} and {100} planes were separately used as counter electrodes (CEs) incorporated into Pt-free dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSC assembled by NiS2 octahedrons exhibited a conversion efficiency of 5.98%, better than that by NiS2 cubes (5.43%). DFT calculations indicate that the better catalytic effect could be ascribed to higher surface energy, more active sites, and more suitable adsorption energy of {111} planes compared with the {100} planes.
Although the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a type of clean, low-cost and easily-fabricated cell, has been developed in labs for decades, its commercialization still necessitates further improvements.1,2 As an important component of the DSSC, the counter electrode (CE) mediates the regeneration of the sensitizer after electron injection, playing a key role in catalysing the reduction of the electrolyte.3,4 The conventional Pt CEs have remarkably high conductivity and efficient catalysis in the reduction of I3− to I−. However, their high cost and limited reserves restrict the extensive commercial application of DSSCs.5–7 Thus, much effort has been devoted to develop highly-efficient, low-cost and naturally abundant non-Pt catalysts. Recently, metal sulphide electrodes such as Co9S8, FeS2, SnS2 and MoS2 have shown potential applications to replace Pt CEs.8–11 Compared to other semiconductor materials, nickel sulphides including various compounds such as NiS, Ni3S2 and NiS2 have superior electrocatalytic activity and excellent electrical conductivity.12–14 For example, the nanocomposites of NiS2 NPs and reduced graphene oxide sheets (NiS2@RGO) used as CEs of DSSCs showed higher conversion efficiency than Pt.15 It has been verified that the NiS2 shows obvious catalytic properties towards I3−/I−.14,15
Semiconductor nano- or microcrystals with different facets usually exhibit different catalytic activities and photovoltaic performance due to their particular surface atomic arrangement and unsaturated dangling bonds. For example, serving as CEs in DSSCs, Bi2S3 microflowers assembled by one-dimensional sheets grown along the 〈130〉 direction showed better electrical conductivity and conversion efficiency than those with 1D sheets along the 〈211〉 axis.16 Although various sulphide nanomaterials were used as CEs in DSSCs, the influence of different surfaces of the NiS2 polyhedrons on the properties of DSSCs was rarely studied. Herein, we report a simple hydrothermal method for the synthesis of uniform NiS2 octahedrons and cubes with similar sizes (the details of the experiment are seen in the ESI†). Using these two kinds of nanocrystals as CEs, the influence of different exposed facets on the performance was carefully studied and we found that the NiS2 octahedrons composed of outer surfaces of (111) showed better performance than cubes enclosed by (100) facets.
The morphology of the octahedrons and cubes are shown in Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the polyhedrons in Fig. S1 (ESI†) showed that they were in good agreement with the component of NiS2 (JCPDS No. 11-0099). As shown in Fig. 1a and d, uniform NiS2 octahedrons and cubes with an average size of ∼250 nm were well dispersed. Typical TEM images for NiS2 octahedrons and cubes are shown in Fig. 1b and e. Their corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 1c and f suggested a good single-crystal characteristic of the NiS2 and confirmed their crystal facets of (111) and (100). The similar patterns of FeS2, which had the same space group as NiS2, had been reported by other researchers.17,18 The extra diffraction spots marked by red circles in SAED patterns, such as (1 −1 0), (1 0 −1) and (0 1 −1) in Fig. S2a (ESI†) and (0 1 0) in Fig. S2b (ESI†), came from the secondary diffraction of the crystals (detailed analysis is seen in the ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Characterization by SEM, TEM, and SAED of NiS2 octahedrons (a–c) and cubes (d–f). SAED patterns (c and f) were obtained from the corresponding particles with the electron beam along the [111] and [001] directions as marked in Fig. 1b and e, respectively. 
To investigate the performance of different CEs, cyclic voltammetry (CV), J–V characteristics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 2a–d. The detailed photovoltaic and EIS parameters are summarized in Table 1. As an electrocatalyst for DSSCs, its catalytic activity was crucially important for improving the performance of the cell. To characterize the electrocatalytic activity of various catalysts, CV curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The left pair could be assigned to the redox reaction of I3−/I− and the right one assigned to the reaction of I2/I3−.8,19 The peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between the left pair was inversely correlated with the rate of the I3−/I− redox reaction.20,21 The Epp value and the peak current were considered as two important parameters to determine the catalytic performances of different CEs. Higher peak current and a lower Epp value indicated a better electrocatalytic capability toward the I3−/I− redox reduction for DSSCs.4,21 As shown in Fig. 2a, the octahedrons exhibited higher peak current density (∼1.40 mA cm−2) and lower Epp (∼0.55 V) compared to the cubes (∼1.22 mA cm−2, ∼0.64 V), showing better electrocatalytic activity.

Fig. 2b shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs with NiS2 octahedrons, cubes and Pt CEs. All DSSCs had similar open circuit voltage (VOC, ∼715 mV), and the reason was that these DSSCs had the same photoanode and the electrolyte. The NiS2 octahedron CE revealed higher short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC = 13.55 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF = 0.62) than that of the cube CE (12.62 mA cm−2, 0.60), resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE). The enhanced JSC values originated from high catalytic activity for I3− reduction demonstrated by high peak current and low Epp from CV measurement.7 The improvement of FF could be attributable to the lower Rs and Rct from the EIS tests.22,23 The DSSC based on octahedrons produced a PCE of 5.98% (up to 91% of Pt), higher than that of cubes (5.43%). The better performance of the octahedrons could be ascribed to the {111}NiS2 planes, having higher surface energy, more suitable adsorption energy, and more catalytic active sites than the {100} planes, which was confirmed by theoretical calculations later.
The EIS analysis was performed using symmetric cells fabricated by two identical CEs with the structure of the CE/electrolyte/CE. The Nyquist plots of DSSCs with symmetric CEs are shown in Fig. 2c. The ohmic series resistance (Rs) could be obtained from the high-frequency intercept on the real axis containing the sheet resistance of the counter electrode and the electrolyte. The Rs of the NiS2 octahedron CE was 13.14 Ω cm2, smaller than that of the cubes (14.98 Ω cm2), which revealed better electrical conductivity of the octahedron CE. The semicircle in the high frequency region occurred from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), which was a measure of electron exchange between the counter electrode and the electrolyte, changing inversely with the catalytic activity of different CEs on the reduction of triiodide.21 The Rct of the NiS2 octahedron CE (9.86 Ω cm2) was smaller than that of the cubes (13.17 Ω cm2), revealing that the octahedrons with {111} facets had better catalytic activity than cubes with {100} facets.21,24 The low frequency corresponded to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte.25 Constant phase element (CPE) values were obtained from the EIS spectrum, and the NiS2 octahedron CE exhibited larger capacitance (C, 39.15 μF) than that of the NiS2 cube CE (29.44 μF) indicating a higher surface area of the electrodes, which was responsible for higher PCE.24,26 The resistance results revealed that the octahedrons had better electrical conductivity and catalytic properties compared with the cubes. Besides, the resistivity of NiS2 polyhedrons was also investigated by a four-probe resistivity tester. The results indicated that NiS2 octahedrons (0.31 Ω cm) exhibited better electrical conductivity than cubes (0.35 Ω cm) in line with the EIS analysis (Table S1, ESI†).

Fig. 2d shows the Tafel polarization curves. The intersection of the cathodic branch and the equilibrium potential line (black solid line) could be considered as the exchange current density (logJ0), which could also be calculated by the equation, J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction, F is the Faraday's constant and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance extracted from the EIS spectra (Fig. 2c) (calculated values shown in Table S2, ESI†).27 The J0 values of the different CEs calculated from the equation are nearly the same as those calculated from Tafel polarization curves. Apparently, Fig. 2d shows a higher J0 value for octahedrons than that for cubes, indicating that the octahedron CE exhibited better electrochemical performance in the catalytic reduction of I3−.
The catalytic properties of NiS2 samples are controlled by five steps including diffusion (Step 1 and 5), catalysis (Step 3), and adsorption/desorption (Step 2 and 4) as shown in Fig. 3a. As I3− ions are bulkier than I− ions with lower concentration in the iodide-based liquid electrolyte, Step 1 of the I3− diffusion towards the catalyst (CE) becomes the control factor of the diffusion.28 As for the adsorption/desorption process, they are apparently controlled by the adsorption energy of NiS2 polyhedrons. Step 3 shows the catalytic reduction of I3− to I− ions on NiS2 facets relating to their surface energy. As our intention is to study the influence of the different surfaces of polyhedron CEs, we focus on Steps 3, 4, and 5 concerning surfaces of polyhedrons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to disclose deeply the difference of the {111} and {100} facets by calculating their surface energy and adsorption energy. The crystal structure of NiS2 is illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It has a space group symmetry of Pa, with Ni atoms occupying the sites in the face-centered cubic sublattice while the sulfur dimers centering at about the anion positions.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic of the catalytic process on CEs including five steps. Perspective views of the crystal structures for surface energy (b) and adsorption energy calculations (c) on NiS2 with the (111) and the (100) planes. The top layers showed the exposed Ni atoms in (111) and (100) planes. Ni–I bond distances, d(Ni–I), were 2.56 Å away from the (111) and 2.52 Å from the (100) plane. 

Fig. 3b shows the model used to calculate the surface energy for the {111} and {100} facets of NiS2. The calculations showed that the surface energy for the {111} facet was estimated to be 1.94 J m−2, which was higher than that for the {100}NiS2 (∼1.58 J m−2). We could also find the {111} facet of FeS2 (the same crystal structure as NiS2) had higher surface energy than the {100} facet.29 The result indicated that the {111} facets were more active and had better catalysis (faster Step 3) than the {100} facets.
The adsorption energies of iodine atom (EIad) simulation models are shown in Fig. 3c (the calculations are seen in Fig. S6, ESI†). For triiodide reduction reaction, too high EIad limited the overall activity due to the difficulty in iodine removal, while too weak adsorption hindered iodine molecular dissociation.1 The adsorption energy at the CH3CN/electrode interface ranging from ∼0.33 to 1.20 eV was thought to be a good descriptor for the iodine reduction activity.30,31 The {111} and {100} facets were estimated to be 0.98 eV and 1.49 eV of EIad, respectively. The suitable EIad of the {111} facets increases the adsorption/desorption rate, and thus leads to faster electron transfer, resulting in higher conversion efficiency of the octahedron CE. Besides, the {111} facet has more exposed Ni atoms than the {100} facet in the models as marked by red arrows in Fig. S4b and S5b. As proved by other reports, nickel has catalytic properties towards I3−/I−,32 which might also be the active elements in the nickel sulfides for catalyzing I3−/I−. To sum up, the {111}NiS2 facet with higher surface energy and more suitable adsorption energy shows better catalytic properties towards I3−/I− compared with the {100}NiS2 facet. Therefore, the octahedron CE provides faster electron transfer and improved electrochemical properties for the DSSCs than the cube CE.
In summary, octahedral and cubic NiS2 nanocrystals with exposed {111} and {100} surfaces have been successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Studies of their electrocatalytic properties reveal that the as-prepared NiS2 nanocrystals exhibit an interesting facet-dependent effect as CEs in DSSCs. The octahedral NiS2 exhibits a conversion efficiency of 5.98% higher than that assembled with cubic NiS2 (5.43%). DFT calculations of surface energy suggest that the {111}NiS2 facets exhibit higher surface energy and more active sites than the {100} facets. It would improve the reduction rate of I3− to I− in the catalytic process. Calculations of adsorption energy suggest that the {111} facets present more suitable adsorption energy than the {100} facets with better I3− adsorption and I− removal. The models show that the {111}NiS2 facets have more exposed Ni atoms than the {100}NiS2 facets, which might provide improved catalytic active sites towards I3−/I−. The facet-dependent effect would provide a probable route to improve the properties of non-Pt CEs in DSSCs by designing nanostructures with optimal crystal planes.
