    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have demonstrated greater potential for application in large-scale energy storage devices than lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to the natural abundance, low cost and environmental benignity of sodium resources. However, the low energy density and poor cycling life limit their commercial applications. The development of high-performance anode materials is one of the key issues for SIBs. Compared with carbonaceous materials, metallic Sn-, Sb- and SnSb alloy-based anodes have developed rapidly due to their high theoretical capacity, high electrical conductivity and safe reaction potential. The major challenge for them is the large volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Numerous efforts have been devoted to solving this problem. This review summarizes recent progress on this cutting-edge topic. A range of Sn-, Sb- and SnSb-based anode materials have been introduced with respect to size control and nanostructure design. It is found that the use of ultra-small nanoparticles, elaborate interface design, heterogeneous element (N, S etc.) doping, multi-dimensional integration etc. are efficient strategies to enhance the electrochemical performance of these anode materials. The ingenious nanostructures and their synthesis methods reported in this review may provide new insights to the rational design of novel anode materials for practical application in advanced energy storage devices in the near future.
1. Introduction
1.1 Overview on SIBs
Energy- and environment-related issues are the most serious issues facing the society today.1 The large-scale applications of new energies, such as solar, wind, and tidal energy, are urgently needed. However, these clean energies have the problem of being intermittent and seasonal.2 Therefore, it is critical to develop safe, stable, and cost-effective large-scale energy storage devices.3,4 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been commercialized on a large scale for all aspects of our lives, such as portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. However, the scarcity and uneven distribution of lithium resources result in high cost of LIBs.5,6 As the same main group element in the periodic table, sodium has similar physical and chemical properties to lithium.7 The electrochemical reaction mechanism of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is similar to that of LIBs. At the same time, due to the abundant and widely distributed sodium resources, the cost of sodium carbonate is much lower than that of lithium carbonate.8,9 Hence, SIBs have greater potential for application in large-scale energy storage devices than LIBs.
1.2 Development of SIB anode materials
Finding anode materials capable of hosting Na+ is a major problem faced by the SIB research community.7,10–15 According to the reaction mechanism, SIB anode materials can be divided into three types: intercalation mechanism, including carbonaceous materials16,17 and titanium-based materials;18 conversion mechanism, including metal oxides,19,20 sulfides21,22 and selenides;23,24 and alloying mechanism, including phosphorus (P),25,26 tin (Sn),27,28 antimony (Sb),29,30 bismuth (Bi),13etc. Each type of these materials has intrinsic challenges. For example, carbonaceous materials are limited by low theoretical capacities, which is not conducive to the development of SIBs with high energy density. Moreover, the low reaction potential of carbonaceous materials tends to produce sodium dendrites, which can easily lead to safety problems.12 Metal oxides and sulfides have large intrinsic resistance and high reaction potential, which are unfavorable to the construction of SIBs with high power density.10,31
1.3 Advantages and challenges of Sn- and Sb-based anodes for SIBs
Among the above anode materials, Sn and Sb have attracted much attention since (1) metallic Sn and Sb have high theoretical capacities; (2) the reaction potentials of Sn and Sb are suitable and safe; and (3) metallic Sn and Sb have good electrical conductivity.32–35Table 1 summarizes the densities, costs, theoretical capacities and reaction potentials of metallic Sn and Sb anode materials as well as the commercial SIB anode material, namely hard carbon (HC). Compared with HC, the prices of Sb and Sn are relatively high due to their low crust contents (0.004% and 0.0001% for Sn and Sb, respectively). On the basis of the high gravimetric and volumetric theoretical capacities, and safe reaction potentials to inhibit the formation of sodium dendrites, Sn- and Sb-based materials can be considered as efficient anodes for SIBs. However, the large volume expansions (Sn: 420% and Sb: 390%) after full sodiation lead to severe capacity decay during long cycles.6,13 This has become the most intractable problem for the practical application of metallic Sn- and Sb-based anodes in SIBs. The current solutions can be summarized into two kinds: (i) material nanocrystallization, where ultra-small metallic Sn, Sb or SnSb nanoparticles shorten the diffusion distance of Na+ and their volumetric stress can be easily dispersed by the composite substrate; and (ii) nanostructure design, where sufficient space is reserved for volume changes of active materials and the Na+ diffusion kinetics is enhanced via designing unique nanostructures, such as a hollow structure, porous structure, core–shell structure, etc., thereby improving the cycling stability and rate performance of the electrodes. This review focuses on the size control and nanostructure design of metallic Sn-, Sb- and SnSb-based alloy anode materials with the alloying mechanism for application in SIBs. Note that the oxides, sulfides and selenides of Sn and Sb anodes for SIBs with the conversion mechanism are not considered since they have been discussed in previous reviews in detail.35,40,41 For example, Li et al.40 outlined the sodiation-induced phase transformations and associated performances in a range of Sn-based systems, including metallic Sn and its alloys, tin oxides, tin sulfides, and tin phosphides. He et al.41 summarized the progress of Sb-based materials for application in LIBs and SIBs, including metallic Sb and its alloys, antimony oxides, antimony sulfides and antimony selenides.

2. Metallic Sn-based anodes for SIBs
As a promising anode material for SIBs, Sn has a high theoretical capacity (847 mA h g−1) after full sodiation. The mechanism of sodium storage in metallic Sn-based anodes has been thoroughly studied. From the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve42 in Fig. 1a, the sodiation of Sn is a multi-step alloying process as following: Sn → NaSn3 (0.36 V) → NaSn (0.19 V) → Na9Sn4 (0.08 V) → Na15Sn4 (0.035 V). The desodiation process is as follows: Na15Sn4 (0.14 V) → NaSn (0.25 V) → NaSn3 (0.53 V) → Sn (0.58 V). The above multi-step reaction has been confirmed by Palaniselvam et al.43 with in situ XRD diffraction. As shown in Fig. 1b, the intermediate products in the sodiation/desodiation process were all amorphous phases. Other advanced techniques, such as mass spectrometry, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), density functional theory (DFT) simulation, etc., have also been applied for the mechanism study. For example, Farbod et al.44 used time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron energy loss spectroscopy to study the sodiation of Sn thin films. They directly observed that after full sodiation in a half-cell, the Sn film segregated to the film-support due to the huge volume change. Stratford et al.45 investigated the alloying mechanism of Sn anodes in SIBs by a combined pair distribution function analysis, DFT simulation, and solid-state NMR approach. The NMR results revealed the possibility of further sodium storage within the Na15Sn4 structure for the first time. They also found that an off-stoichiometry phase of Na15+xSn4 was formed toward the end of discharge. It has been demonstrated that the huge volume expansion of Sn after sodiation to Na15Sn4 leads to rapid capacity attenuation.40,42–45 To address this issue, various metallic Sn electrodes have been explored in terms of size control and nanostructure design.

2.1 Size control for metallic Sn-based anodes
Combining a carbon matrix with Sn nanoparticles is an effective approach to buffer the volume expansion and to prevent the agglomeration of Sn.28,43,46–52 For example, Chen et al.46 synthesized Sn nanodots (∼2 nm) embedded in porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (Sn NDs@PNC nanofibers) via electrospinning (Fig. 2a and b). The ultra-small Sn nanodots reduced the overall stress of the electrode and improved the utilization rate of the active material under high current density, showing excellent rate performance (450 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 2c). Here, the porous N-doped carbon nanofibers were beneficial for buffering volume changes and preventing Sn agglomeration. To further study the mechanism of the size effect, Chen et al. in situ analysed a single Sn nanoparticle during the sodiation and desodiation process with atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2d).53 After the first sodiation process, the volume expansion of the Sn nanoparticle is 427%, close to the theoretical volume change (420%). After the first desodiation, the Sn nanoparticle retained an irreversible volume expansion of 207%. In addition, they found that all Sn nanoparticles with different sizes had a similar volume expansion of about 420% (70 nm, 422%; 240 nm, 430%) after the first sodiation to Na15Sn4 while the volume change of the large particle (240 nm, 520%) is much larger than the small one (70 nm, about 422%) after 5 cycles (Fig. 2e and f). This indicates that decreasing the particle size can enhance the cycling stability of Sn electrodes. Niederberger et al. synthesized Sn nanodots (∼3.2 nm) uniformly distributed in a three-dimensional (3D) sheet-like N-doped carbon (SNC) foam derived from a low-cost SnO2/polyacrylamide composite hydrogel, as shown in Fig. 3a and b.51 The Sn@SNC foams integrated the intriguing merits of Sn nanodots and the SNC framework. The SNC framework provided a flexible buffer for the volume change, enhanced the electrode conductivity and prevented Sn nanodots from aggregation. More importantly, the hierarchically porous structure of the Sn@SNC foams ensured the stability and rapid diffusion of Na+ in the electrode. Even at mass loadings up to 20 mg cm−2, the foam electrode still had a high reversible areal capacity of 1.0 mA h cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2 over 700 cycles.

Graphene has been widely used as a substrate to support nanoparticles due to its high conductivity, flexibility and large specific surface area.54–56 Luo et al. designed and prepared a flexible hierarchical conductive network (Fig. 3c and d), which constructs Sn quantum dots encapsulated in 1D N,S co-doped carbon nanofibers (NS-CNFs) sheathed within 2D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) scrolls (Fig. 3e).50 The 1D NS-CNFs could prevent the aggregation of Sn QDs while the 2D RGO could improve the conductivity of the electrode and enlarge the contact area with electrolyte. As a freestanding anode for SIBs, the 3D Sn/NS-CNFs@RGO flexible electrodes exhibited amazing cycling stability (373 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1) and rate performance (189 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1). Palaniselvam et al. have fabricated a Sn–C composite material by ball milling and annealing (Fig. 3f), which combined Sn and N-doped graphene nanoplatelets (SnNGnP), exhibiting excellent cycling stability (290 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1).43 They used rate-dependent measurements, in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ electrochemical dilatometry to study the asymmetric storage behaviour of Sn. It is found that the composite electrodes showed only a 14% expansion during sodiation compared with bare Sn (420%).
2.2 Nanostructure design for metallic Sn-based anodes
Well-designed nanostructures can significantly enhance the electrochemical properties of electrode materials.14,57–59 Recently, metallic Sn-based anodes with various nanostructures have shown excellent electrochemical performances in SIBs, such as hollow structures,60 nanoporous structures,61 core–shell structures,47,62,63etc. For instance, Mao et al. synthesized pipe-wire TiO2–Sn@carbon nanofibers (TiO2–Sn@CNFs) via electrospinning and atomic layer deposition, as shown in Fig. 4a.62 The Sn-wire was well protected by the carbon nanofiber to buffer the volume expansion. The TiO2 pipe coated the carbon nanofiber, which reduced the contact surface with electrolyte and thus prevented Sn from pulverization (Fig. 4b). As a result, the pipe-wire TiO2–Sn@CNFs showed an enhanced cycling performance with a retained capacity of 413 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 400 cycles in SIBs (Fig. 4c).

2D layer structures have attracted wide attention due to their large specific surface area and short ion diffusion path. Kim et al. prepared multi-layered 2D Sn nanodendrites (Fig. 4d and e) by electrodeposition.61 They used coumarin to force the Sn crystals to grow layer-by-layer along a certain direction, forming a unique multi-layered 2D nanoarchitecture. As an anode material for SIBs, the Sn nanodendrites showed a high discharge capacity of 783.88 mA h g−1 and superior cycling performance with 96.6% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 4f).
Hollow structures have been widely used to solve the volume expansion problem of electrode materials.19,64,65 The void space provides sufficient buffer for sodiation/desodiation. Liu et al. synthesized highly porous Ni3Sn2 intermetallic microcages (Fig. 4g and h) through a template-free Ostwald ripening-based solvothermal route.60 The hollow microcages and inactive phase Ni provided buffer and support for the volume expansion of Sn. At the same time, the Ni converted from sodiation of Ni3Sn2 enhanced the electron migration rate. As an anode for SIBs (Fig. 4i), the Ni3Sn2 porous microcages exhibited excellent cycling stability (270 mA h g−1 at 1C after 300 cycles).
Some preparation methods and electrochemical properties of metallic Sn-based anodes for SIBs are listed in Table 2. Obviously, not only the combination of ultra-small Sn nanoparticles and carbon substrates but also the nanostructure design of metallic Sn-based materials can effectively improve the stability and rate performance of electrodes. These genius ideas have provided great inspiration for the practical application of metallic Sn-based anodes for SIBs in the near future.

3. Metallic Sb-based anodes for SIBs
Metallic Sb-based anodes for SIBs have been widely researched due to the high theoretical capacity of Sb (660 mA h g−1).67–107 Thanks to the puckered layered structure and suitable inter-lamellar spacing, Sb can effectively accommodate the insertion of Na+.41 The reaction mechanism of Sb anodes for SIBs has been explored by researchers.67,108–110 For example, Darwiche et al. first introduced a simple process via an in situ XRD test (Fig. 5a).67 The sodiation process was cSb → aNaxSb → Na3Sbhex/cNa3Sbcub → cNa3Sbhex and the desodiation process was cNa3Sbhex → aSb (c: crystalline, a: amorphous). Fig. 5b shows the corresponding CV curves, where the sodiation peaks were observed at 0.72, 0.55, and 0.50 V while the desodiation peaks were located at 0.8 V with a strong intensity and 0.9 V with a weak intensity.67 DFT simulation has also been employed to scrutinize the sodiation mechanism of Sb anodes. For example, Baggetto et al.109 studied the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics of pure Sb and found that the reaction of Sb with Na yields larger hysteresis and/or non-relaxed overpotentials than the reaction with Li, which is likely caused by the formation of amorphous phases in the case of Na. In addition, Choi et al.110 combined first-principles calculations and voltammetric measurements to identify multiple and continuous phase transition behaviour of Sb anodes during the cycling processes in SIBs. They found that the inflowing Na+ changed the structures of NaxSb and generated various stable and metastable NaxSb phases. After the sodiation process, Na3Sb is formed, resulting in a volume expansion of up to 390%.82 Hence, the cycling stability of pure metallic Sb anodes is not satisfactory.

3.1 Size control for metallic Sb-based anodes
Dispersing Sb nanoparticles on carbonaceous substrates69,70,72,73,75,78,81,83,85–89,96,101,105–107 can effectively prevent the self-agglomeration and adequately buffer the volume change of Sb during the sodiation/desodiation processes. Wu et al. embedded 0D Sb nanodots in inter-connected 2D carbon nanosheets (Sb-NDs/CNs) with a top-down strategy.96 They exfoliated H3Sb3P2O14 nanosheets from the laminar structure of K3Sb3P2O14 with an ion exchange method. Then, the Sn nanodots embedded in the carbon nanosheets were synthesized directly from this template (Fig. 6a). The carbon nanosheets constructed a 3D conductive network (Fig. 6b), which provides more Na+ adsorption sites thanks to a large specific surface area. In addition, the carbon nanosheets prevented the self-agglomeration of Sn nanodots (Fig. 6c) and maintained a short Na+ diffusion channel. Therefore, the Sb-NDs/CN electrodes exhibited excellent rate performance (271 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1) and cycling stability (380 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 after 250 cycles).

Nitrogen doping is an efficient strategy to enhance the connection between nanoparticles and carbonaceous substrates. Xu et al. synthesized Sb nanoparticles embedded in ionic liquid-derived N-enriched carbon (Sb@NC) via pyrolysis of an SbCl3/Emim-dca mixture (Fig. 6d), which combined uniformly dispersed Sb nanoparticles and a strong chemical coupling effect (Fig. 6e).86 As the anode material in SIBs, Sb@NC showed a superior rate performance of 237 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 and an improved cycling stability of 328 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 300 cycles. Moreover, an Sb@NC//Na3V2(PO4)3/C full cell exhibited a high rate performance (139 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6f). This method has also been extended to prepare other N-doped carbon materials. For example, Fang et al.88 used an ionic liquid Emim-dca nitrogen source to fabricate N-doped RGO-bonded Sb nanoparticles (Sb/N-RGO) by ball-milling and subsequent pyrolysis (Fig. 6g and h), which created a strong bond between Sb nanoparticles and pyrrolic N in N-doped RGO. As a result, Sb/N-RGO exhibited excellent cycling stability (473.2 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 500 cycles) and rate performance (304.8 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). Wu et al. achieved the controllable preparation of the composite of nanostructured Sb and a N-doped carbon matrix via simply annealing the mixture of Sb(Ac)3, glucose and NH4Cl.107 By adjusting the annealing temperature and the ratio of NH4Cl to glucose (Fig. 6i), the optimized holey Sb@G0.25N0.25-950 (glucose/NH4Cl = 0.25/0.25, the annealing temperature was 950 °C, as shown in Fig. 6j and k) was obtained, in which the holey architecture addressed the restacking and accommodated the volume expansion of Sb. As the anode material for SIBs, the Sb@G0.25N0.25-950 electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability (419 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 87.4%).
The carbon skeleton generated by the pyrolysis of a metal organic framework (MOF) can fully retain its original loose and porous structure, which is very conducive to the dispersion of nanoparticles.111,112 Jing et al. designed and prepared a novel necklace-like hybrid material via electrospinning and in situ substitution (Fig. 7a), in which ultra-small Sb nanoparticles (mean size of 6.82 nm) were encapsulated in a unique N-doped carbon nanonecklace (Fig. 7b–d), denoted as Sb/N-CNN.101 They enhanced the crystallization of Sb nanoparticles by annealing the samples and found that the Sb/N-CNN annealed at 300 °C showed much better electrochemical performance than the unannealed sample. As the anode material for SIBs, the Sb/N-CNN electrode showed superior rate performance (314 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 7e) and the best cycling stability (401 mA h g−1 after 6000 cycles at 1 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 7f) among Sb-based anodes. This should be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the carbon nanocages effectively dispersed Sb nanoparticles and prevented their agglomeration; (2) the carbon nanocages were connected via electrospinning, improving the cycling stability and conductivity of the electrodes; and (3) the N-doped porous carbon nanofibers and nanocages were beneficial for electrolyte diffusion and provided more active sites for Na+ insertion/extraction.

3.2 Nanostructure design for metallic Sb-based anodes
Yolk–shell structures have been widely used to design novel electrode materials with improved electrochemical properties due to the outer protective shell and inner space. Song et al. prepared a yolk–shell structured Sb@C anode (Fig. 8a) for SIBs and investigated the sodiation process by using in situ TEM (Fig. 8b).82 It was found that Sb particles were completely wrapped by the carbon shell and thus the volume expansion occurred within the yolk–shell structure during the sodiation process. As shown in Fig. 8c, the yolk–shell Sb@C anode showed a high specific capacity (554 mA h g−1), and good rate performance (315 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1) and cyclability properties (capacity retention of 92% after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1). Moreover, Lou et al. reported an Sb@C coaxial nanotube, which combined the advantages of hollow and 1D structures.76 As an anode material for SIBs, such a hybrid exhibited excellent cycling stability (230 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles) and rate performance (310 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1).

Nanoporous structures have been demonstrated to address the volume change issue of electrode materials and thus to enhance the electrochemical performance of SIBs. Ma et al. obtained a mesoporous Sb2O3@Sb nanocomposite by one-step dealloying the precursor alloy Mg90Sb10 (Fig. 9a).91 They chose tartaric acid to control the corrosion rate and to inhibit the diffusion of Sb atoms, which formed an ultrafine mesoporous structure (the ligament size is about 10 nm). In this process, the highly active Sb ligament surface was oxidized to form an Sb2O3 layer (Fig. 9b). The mesoporous Sb2O3@Sb nanocomposite showed a high specific capacity (659 mA h g−1), high rate performance (200 mA h g−1 at 29.7 A g−1) and good cycling stability (658 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 9c) as an anode for SIBs. Moreover, Wu et al. mixed Si with Sb2O3 and carbon for high-energy ball milling (Fig. 9d).94 Sb/SiOx/C was formed in this process due to the solid-state reduction reaction between Sb2O3 and Si, which was reported for the first time. Finally, a micrometer-sized nanoporous Sb/C (MNP-Sb/C) composite was obtained by etching SiOx with HF. The MNP-Sb/C anode exhibited high gravimetric and volumetric capacities (436 mA h g−1 and 427 mA h cm−3, respectively), high rate performance (384 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1), and cycling stability (nearly no capacity decay after 200 cycles at 300 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 9e).

Self-supported nanostructures allow the electrode to be free of conductive agents and binders, thus increasing the energy density of the battery. Li et al. constructed a self-supported Sb array on Cu foil via a template-free electrodeposition followed by annealing (Fig. 9f).104 The 3D Sb prism array had enough space to buffer the volume expansion of Sb during the sodiation process (Fig. 9g). Furthermore, the annealing treatment consolidated the structural integrity between Sb and Cu, which ensured the stability of the electrode. As a result, the self-supported Sb array electrode exhibited a reversible capacity of 578 mA h g−1 and retained 531 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.33 A g−1. Such a template-free route showed potential application in designing electrode architectures.
2D materials led by graphene have been widely used in SIBs due to their large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity. For example, Hu et al. prepared an Sb/RGO paper, which showed an amazing cycling stability (467 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 100 cycles) and excellent rate capacity (237 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) as the anode for SIBs.75 Recently, Wang et al. reported a non-graphene 2D composite, 2D Sb@TiO2−x nanoplate, in which ultra-small Sb nanocrystals (sub-10 nm) were coated by amorphous TiO2−x layers (Fig. 9h–j).103 The synergistic effects between Sb and TiO2−x and the designed layer structure contributed to the excellent electrochemical performances of the 2D Sb@TiO2−x nanoplate anode for SIBs: a high specific capacity (568 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), good rate capability (429 mA h g−1 at 3.2 A g−1) and cycling stability (capacity retention of 95.2% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1).

Table 3 summarizes some preparation methods and electrochemical properties of metallic Sb-based anodes for SIBs. Through the unremitting efforts of researchers, the study of metallic Sb-based anodes has made great progress in the aspects of substrate support, size control, porous, hollow or core–shell structures, etc., which has laid a solid foundation for commercial applications.

4. SnSb-based anodes for SIBs
The SnSb alloy has also attracted considerable attention and has shown superior electrochemical performances in SIBs. Xiao et al. first reported the SnSb alloy as an anode for SIBs.114 They suggested that the sodiation/desodiation of SnSb should be a reversible sequential electrochemical reaction: SnSb ↔ Na3Sb + Sn ↔ Na3Sb + Na15Sn4. The coexisting Sn- and Sb-rich phases would self-support one another, which enhanced the stability of the electrode. This mechanism has been thoroughly studied by using different characterization techniques.115–118 For example, Buriak et al. confirmed the phase transformation of the β-SnSb anode for SIBs by using in situ TEM.116 As shown in Fig. 10a, during the sodiation process, the Na3Sb phase and Na15Sn4 phase were formed in sequence. During the desodiation process, the Na15Sn4 phase was desodiated before the Na3Sb phase. Finally, Sb alloyed with the desodiated Sn and returned to nanocrystalline β-SnSb. They measured the volume expansion as a function of the (de)sodiation time, which indicated that the final volume change of β-SnSb was 210%, much smaller than that of pure Sn and Sb (Fig. 10b and c). As a result, the β-SnSb alloy anode showed better cycling stability than the pure phase. However, with increasing cycles, the segregation of the crystalline Sn phase resulted in capacity decay.

4.1 Size control for SnSb-based anodes
SnSb nanocrystals have been synthesized, which exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs.119,120 He et al. synthesized pure monodisperse SnSb nanocrystals (SnSb NCs) via the reduction reaction between Sn NCs and SbCl3 in oleylamine (Fig. 11a).119 The SnSb NC anode showed a capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at 0.66 A g−1 after 100 cycles and 230 mA h g−1 at 13.2 A g−1. However, the pure SnSb alloy without external protection tends to agglomerate and to shed during long cycling. In addition, SnSb NCs (Fig. 11b) were also prepared via an inexpensive colloidal synthesis by Walter et al.,120 and they exhibited outstanding cycling stability with only 5% capacity loss over 100 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.

Insets are SEM and TEM images of the 3D SnSb@N-PG electrode after 4000 cycles.124 Copyright 2018, Wiley. 
In order to improve the stability and rate performances of the SnSb electrode, a hybrid consisting of ultra-small SnSb nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix has been widely studied. Ji et al.121 reported a RGO–SnSb nanocomposite prepared through a hydrothermal method and subsequent thermal reduction treatments (Fig. 11c), in which the SnSb nano-alloy was firmly embedded on the surface of RGO (RGO–SnSb), effectively buffering the volume changes and preventing particle agglomeration. As an anode for SIBs, RGO–SnSb exhibited good rate performance (80 mA h g−1 at 15 A g−1) and cycling stability (361 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.1 A g−1). In addition, the NaCl-template method has also been utilized to prepare ultrafine nanoparticles/porous carbon hybrids.19,122–124 For example, Wang et al. prepared 3D SnSb@SnOx/SbOx@C, in which the amorphous SnOx/SbOx shell enhanced the interfacial interaction between SnSb and the carbon network (Fig. 11d).123 As a result, the hybrid anode for SIBs showed improved rate performance (244.3 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1) and cycling stability with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1. Moreover, Qin et al. fabricated a SnSb-in-plane nano-confined 3D N-doped porous graphene network (3D SnSb@N-PG, as shown in Fig. 11e) as an anode for SIBs through a top-down NaCl-template method combined with the industrialized spray drying method with the space-confined catalysis effect.124 The N-doped porous graphene networks not only buffered the huge volume change of SnSb nanocrystals during sodiation/desodiation, but also enhanced the conductivity of the overall electrode. Furthermore, the ultra-small SnSb nanocrystals (10–15 nm) provided a short Na+ diffusion path. The 3D SnSb@N-PG anode for SIBs exhibited excellent cycling stability (Fig. 11f) at a high current density (190 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 after 4000 cycles with a capacity retention of nearly 100%).
4.2 Nanostructure design for SnSb-based anodes
Recently, various ingenious nanostructures have been designed to enhance the electrochemical properties of SnSb anodes for SIBs.125–130 Zhang et al. reported the porous nickel scaffold@SnSb (PNS@SnSb, as shown in Fig. 12a).126 The PNS was prepared by an electroplating and subsequent template-removal method and the SnSb alloy was electrodeposited on the surface of the PNS. The hollow structure of the PNS@SnSb hybrid provided large void space to effectively disperse the volumetric stress of SnSb during the sodiation/desodiation process. The tight bonding between the outboard SnSb film and the inboard PNS prevented the self-agglomeration of SnSb. As an anode for SIBs, PNS@SnSb exhibited an enhanced cycling stability (275 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles).

Dealloying is an effective method for preparing nanoporous structures. Ma et al. reported a bimetallic single-phase nanoporous SnSb alloy (NP-SnSb) with a bicontinuous ligament-channel structure by chemically dealloying the rapidly solidified precursor alloy Mg90Sn5Sb5 (Fig. 12b and c).128 The porous structure with nano-sized ligaments and the alloying effect of SnSb ensured excellent cycling stability (506.6 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 without significant capacity attenuation) and superior rate performance (458.2 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) of the NP-SnSb alloy anode for SIBs. Moreover, a NP-SnSb//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell also exhibited excellent electrochemical performances (Fig. 12d and e). At a current density of 2 A g−1, the full cell delivered a discharge capacity of 386.4 mA h g−1. After 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, the full cell retained a capacity of 388.6 mA h g−1. Similarly, Choi et al. reported a porous carbon-free SnSb (PCF–SnSb) anode for SIBs via melt-spinning followed by a chemical-etching process with the precursor Si/SnSb (Fig. 12f).127 The PCF-SnSb anode exhibited a reversible capacity of 481 mA h g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 80% and cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 99% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1. In addition, Madhavi et al. prepared a micro-structurally engineered ternary Fe0.1-SnSb alloy via rapid solidification (Fig. 12g and h).129 In this process, nanocrystalline domains were formed, which mitigated the volumetric stress during the sodiation/desodiation process. The ternary anode for SIBs showed a high capacity of 500 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 120 cycles. Compared with the hollow and nanoporous structures, the microstructurally engineered ternary Fe0.1-SnSb alloy had a higher volume energy density.
The preparation methods and electrochemical properties of SnSb-based anodes for SIBs are summarized in Table 4. It is clear that the strategies of size control and nanostructure design are effective for improving the electrochemical performances of the SnSb alloy-based anodes.

In addition, some intermetallic Sn- and Sb-based anode materials (the compounds consisting of electrochemically inactive elements such as Ni,60,71,133 Fe,134,135 Co,136 Zn,137,138 Cu,66,139–141 Mo,30etc., with active elements Sn and Sb) for SIBs have also attracted extensive attention. The sodiation/desodiation processes of MSn and MSb anodes in SIBs can be expressed as the following:34,35,142 MSn + 3.75Na+ + 3.75e− ↔ M + Na3.75Sn; MSb + 3Na+ + 3e− ↔ M + Na3Sb, where the inactive elements M can enhance the electrical conductivity and buffer the volume changes of the active materials. For example, Jackson et al.137 prepared a Zn4Sb3 alloy film by electrodeposition and low-temperature annealing. As an anode for SIBs, Zn4Sb3 displayed good cycling stability (a capacity retention of 90% after 250 cycles at 0.2C). Kim et al.141 dispersed Cu6Sn5 alloy nanoparticles in TiC and a C conductive matrix. As an anode for SIBs, the Cu6Sn5–TiC–C composite exhibited long cycling life with a capacity retention of ∼94% after 250 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and excellent rate performance with a capacity retention of 82% at 5 A g−1. They also prepared an FeSb–TiC–C composite with a similar method.135 As an anode for SIBs, such a composite exhibited a capacity of 210 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and superior rate performance with a capacity retention of ∼80% even at 10 A g−1. Baggetto et al.30 fabricated Mo3Sb7 thin films by magnetron sputtering, which exhibited superior rate performance (280 mA h g−1 at 30C) as an anode for SIBs. Hence, the Sn- and Sb-based intermetallics with inactive elements can effectively improve electrical conductivity and cycling stability, which is beneficial for preparing SIBs with excellent rate performance and cycling stability.
5. Electrolytes for SIBs
As an important part of SIBs, electrolyte plays a vital role in determining the electrochemical performances of SIBs. Stability, ionic conductivity and electronic insulation are the key factors for electrolytes.142–144 Non-aqueous liquid electrolytes containing sodium salts (NaPF6, NaClO4, NaCF3SO3, etc.) and alkylene carbonate-based solvents [ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), etc.] have been widely used in SIBs. However, the electrolytes in SIBs with metallic Sn-, Sb-based anodes should ensure the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, which can withstand large volume changes of the active materials. Ji et al.131 discussed the effect of the fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive in the electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in EC/DEC) on the formation of a SEI in SIBs with SnSb/porous carbon nanofibers as an anode. It was found that the FEC effectively suppressed the decomposition of the electrolyte, improved the mechanical and chemical properties of the SEI film, and stabilized the SEI film during the cycling process, which significantly improved the cycling stability of the battery. Lu et al.145 compared FEC-free and FEC-containing (5 wt%) electrolytes (1 M NaClO4 in EC/DEC) in SIBs with SiC–Sb–C as an anode. The FEC-free electrolyte formed a thick and unstable SEI film composed of Na2CO3, ROCO2Na, RONa (R: alkyl groups), etc. The FEC-containing electrolyte formed a dense and thin SEI film composed of fluorine-containing salts (such as NaF, F-ROCO2Na, FRONa, etc.), which suppressed the decomposition of the EC and DEC. As a result, the SIBs with the FEC-containing (5 wt%) electrolyte exhibited much better cycling stability.
Recently, ether-based electrolytes have also been utilized to improve the electrochemical performance of SIBs.146–149 Huang et al.149 reported an ether-based electrolyte (NaBF4/diglyme) for SIBs with a Sn anode. They found that such an electrolyte derived a thinner and more elastic SEI film with higher ionic diffusivity and higher stiffness than the EC/DMC-derived one. Thus, the diglyme electrolyte showed much better coulombic efficiencies, rate performances and cycling stability in the full cell Sn//Na3V2(PO4)3 than the NaBF4/EC/DMC electrolyte.
In conclusion, great progress has been made in the development of electrolytes for SIBs. However, further study is needed to tackle the cost and safety issues. An appropriate balance among the electrochemical performance, cost and safety is critical.
6. Sodium-ion full cells
The testing of sodium-ion full cells is a key step for the commercialization of electrode materials. Alloy-based electrodes need to be matched with suitable cathode materials in order to fully utilize their capability of sodium storage in full cells. The olivine NaFePO4 cathodes have been widely studied due to the excellent cycling stability of LiFePO4 in LIBs.150–152 Hasa et al.151 used LiFePO4 directly in a full cell with a Sn–C anode and a NaClO4-containing electrolyte. During the cycling processes, LiFePO4 transformed to NaFePO4via a Li–Na conversion reaction. The NaFePO4//Sn–C full cell exhibited high reversible capacities of 145 mA h g−1 at 15.4 mA g−1 (0.1C) and 93 mA h g−1 at 154 mA g−1.
Sodium super-ionic conductors (NASICON) have also been widely used as cathode materials to match with Sn, Sb and SnSb-based anodes in sodium-ion full cells.153–158 As a NASICON-type cathode, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has a rhombohedral structure with a flat voltage plateau at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na and a relatively high reversible capacity of 118 mA h g−1.153 Zhang et al.154 prepared a full cell with an Sb/C anode and NVP/RGO cathode, which shows good rate performance with a capacity of 43 mA h g−1 at 2.34 A g−1 (based on the mass of the cathode active materials). Wang et al.77 reported a full cell Sb@TiO2−x//Na3V2(PO4)3–C with an energy density of 151 W h kg−1 at 21 W kg−1 and 61 W h kg−1 at 1.83 kW kg−1. The NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathodes have also been applied in sodium-ion full cells. Guo et al.155 synthesized a Na3V2(PO4)2O2F nano-tetraprism (NVPF-NTP) cathode, which exhibited excellent rate performance (84.1 mA h g−1 at 40C), outstanding cycling stability (an initial capacity of 117.6 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of up to 88.5% after 1000 cycles at 1C), and superior low-temperature performance (a capacity retention of up to 76.4% with two evident discharge plateaus at −25 °C and 0.2C). The full cell Sb-CNT//NVPF-NTP exhibited a high capacity of 120.3 mA h g−1 at 1C and 64.9 mA h g−1 at 20C. Recently, Chen et al.156 reported an anode containing yolk–shell structured Sb@C nanoconfined N,S co-doped 3D porous carbon microspheres (Sb@NS-3DPCMSs). Coupled with the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C cathode, the full cell Na3V2(PO4)2O2F/C//Sb@NS-3DPCMSs exhibited a high capacity of 170 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1.
In addition, P2-type mixed-transition-metal layered frameworks have been considered as some of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs owing to their high capacity and good cycling stability.104,133,159 Li et al.104 assembled full cells with an Sb prism anode and Na0.67(Ni0.23Mg0.1Mn0.67)O2 cathode, showing specific energy densities of 197 W h kg−1 at 0.2C and 128 W h kg−1 at 5C with a power density of 1280 W kg−1 (based on the total mass of the cathode and anode active materials). Furthermore, Liang et al.133 reported a full cell consisting of a P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 cathode and 3D Sb–Ni nanoarrays as an anode. The full cell exhibited a high energy density of approximately 100 W h kg−1 (based on the total mass of the cathode and anode active materials) and superior rate performance of 434.2 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 (based on the mass of the anode active materials).
In conclusion, great progress has been made in recent years in the research on sodium-ion full cells composed of metallic Sn-, Sb- and SnSb-based anodes and various cathode materials. However, the commercial application of the full cells is still limited by the low initial coulombic efficiency, unstable cycling performance, and poor rate properties. Some critical issues, such as cost control, electrolyte composition, and the capacity matching of anodes and cathodes, etc., need to be addressed.
7. Summary and prospects
In this review, we summarized recent progress of metallic Sn- and Sb-based anodes for SIBs, which have the merits of high theoretical capacity, high conductivity and safe reaction potential. Compared with other anode materials, the major challenge is the rapid capacity decay caused by the large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation process. Here, we systematically introduced the sodium storage mechanism of Sn, Sb and SnSb alloys, and summarized the development in the aspects of size control and nanostructure design. On the one hand, the ultra-small nanoparticles combined with appropriate substrates can effectively buffer the volume change during the sodiation/desodiation process, prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles, and provide short Na+ diffusion paths, which are beneficial for improving the rate properties and cycling stability of SIBs. On the other hand, well-constructed nanostructures, such as hollow, nanoporous or yolk–shell structures, can offer large space for the volume change during the charging/discharging process and provide rapid Na+ diffusion pathways, also enhancing the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs.
Although these methods have achieved great progress, the development of novel anode materials for application in SIBs is still on the way. The synthesis of ultra-small metal nanoparticles and nanostructures is currently at the laboratory level. It is an urgent issue to optimize the process and to reduce the cost of industrial preparation. Therefore, how to prepare an anode material for SIBs with superior integrated performance (high specific capacity, high rate performance and long cycling life) and industrial potential (easy fabrication and low cost) is still a huge challenge. In addition, the high performances of most materials are obtained only in the half-cell test. When they were assembled as full cells for testing, a series of problems were exposed: (1) ultra-small metal nanoparticles with large specific surface area would lead to the formation of extra SEI films, reducing the initial coulombic efficiency and wasting limited Na+ in the full cells; (2) many nanostructures, such as hollow or nanoporous structures, suffer from low packing density, which seriously reduces the volume energy density of the full cells; (3) the design and fabrication of high-performance cathode materials and the good matching of the anode/cathode materials in the full cells are highly desirable. With the rapid progress of SIBs, a better understanding of the mechanisms which underpin the excellent electrochemical properties of Sn- or Sb-based anodes from both theoretical and experimental aspects can be achieved and the aforementioned challenges may be solved. For example, DFT simulation can provide theoretical models for elucidating the electrochemical reaction mechanism, the transport mechanism of Na+/electrons in the electrode, electrolyte and their interfaces, and the formation mechanism of the SEI film. The real-time detection of the electrochemical reactions by in situ characterization techniques (in situ XRD, XPS, TEM, Raman, etc.) can directly reflect the phase and volume change of the electrode materials during charge and discharge, and thereby the dominant factors that affect the electrochemical properties of SIBs can be obtained. Combining the above two methods, a DFT-aided material design, an accurate composition control, the optimization of preparation and heat-treatment process, and also the elaborate interface design may be achieved, which are beneficial for excellent integrated electrochemical performance. In this regard, we proposed a “4S” strategy, i.e., selection, structure, system and synergism. Selecting the electrode materials with high theoretical capacity and low cost is crucial for SIBs. At the same time, the nanocrystallization of active materials can provide more Na+ active sites. Hollow or porous structures play an important role in buffering large volume changes during the sodiation/desodiation process and accelerating electrolyte diffusion. Constructing a multi-dimensional and integrated system is beneficial for decreasing internal resistance and maintaining structural stability of the electrode. The synergistic effects of the above factors would bring about superior electrochemical performances. Following this strategy, we have designed a variety of high-performance anode materials.19,23,64,101,160 The proposed 4S strategy and this review may provide a reference for researchers to find simpler, more efficient and controllable solutions to commercialize metallic Sn- and Sb-based anode materials for application in SIBs in the near future.
