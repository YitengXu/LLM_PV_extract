    , Accepted 24th June 2015First published on 24th June 2015AbstractTo achieve power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic devices, we designed and synthesized a new DPP-based alternating terpolymer, PDPPPyT, containing DPP as an electron accepting unit and pyrene and thiophene as electron donating units. The donor–acceptor alternating copolymers PDPPPy and PDPPT were also prepared as control materials. The optical properties and the highest occupied molecular orbital of PDPPPyT were found to be between those of the PDPPPy and PDPPT copolymers. GI-XRD analysis indicated that the PDPPPy and PDPPT copolymers had a typical edge-on orientation on the substrate, whereas the PDPPPyT terpolymer showed face-on orientation in pristine and annealed films. Although PDPPPyT has two different donating units, pyrene and thiophene, in the repeating unit, the corresponding TFT exhibited a high hole mobility of ∼0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1. A PSC made of PDPPPyT and PC71BM displayed power conversion efficiency values of around 4.0%, which is higher than those of PDPPPy- and PDPPT-based PSCs. This improved performance was attributed to the more efficient light-harvesting properties of PDPPPyT in the solar spectrum. These results unambiguously demonstrated that this new synthetic strategy for regular conjugated terpolymers could be used to tune the molecular energy levels and optical properties to obtain high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
The synthesis of organic conjugated polymers is facile, and great flexibility in structural design can be obtained. As these polymers exhibit high light harvesting efficiency, thin films are sufficient for the fabrication of high-performing organic solar cells. Therefore, these polymers have attracted much attention for the development of new materials and future energy resources owing to the low cost of manufacturing and highly flexible devices obtained.1–4
Recently, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been fabricated with various donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated copolymers with relatively small bandgap energies.5,6 In terms of molecular design, various donor and acceptor moieties have been introduced in newly synthesized conjugated polymers. As the intrinsic molecular energy levels, absorption properties, crystallinity, and solubility in organic solvents can affect the performance of PSCs significantly, many chemically modified polymer structures have been proposed, resulting in a marked improvement of PSC performance.7–9
Among the promising polymers, D–A alternating copolymers have been further expanded to include regular and irregular (i.e. random) terpolymers that bear three different monomeric units in a single repeating group on the polymer backbone.10–15 By simply blending two different polymers with different energy levels, intermolecular polymer interactions induce the formation of exciplexes, which do not optimize the desired energy levels but generate new energy levels with a narrower bandgap energy.
In a previous report, Kim et al. combined the electron-deficient units diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) with thienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) to give a series of random terpolymers.16 In addition, Jo et al. successfully exhibited broad and intense light absorption, as well as low lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, using DPP and isoindigo as electron acceptors.7 Corresponding random terpolymers with (6,6)-phenyl C71-butylic acid methyl ester (PC71BM) showed high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Although the random conjugated terpolymers were easily synthesized by mixing the monomeric units, these polymers cannot lead to an accurate understanding of compositional effects owing to the random arrangement of the monomer units, which could result in poor reproducibility of the polymer backbone.
Compared with random terpolymers, regular terpolymers with an accurate chemical composition can be achieved using more complicated synthetic procedures.17–20 Janssen et al. demonstrated a synthetic method for regular terpolymers using DPP as an electron-withdrawing unit, alternated with electron-donating terthiophene (3T) and thiophene-phenyl-thiophene (TPT).17 They also obtained terpolymers by introducing two electron-deficient units, DPP and benzothiadiazole (BT), with dithienopyrrole (DTP) as the electron donor.20 Depending on the electronic properties of the various monomer structures, the corresponding polymers have different characteristics that feature unique inter- or intra-molecular interactions and finely tunable molecular energy levels, optical properties, and physical properties. Interestingly, these regular terpolymers were also found to exhibit enhanced PCE values.
Although regular terpolymers typically exhibit attractive physical properties and improved photovoltaic (PV) performance, a limited number of studies have investigated their physical and electronic/optoelectronic performance.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a new regular alternating terpolymer, PDPPPyT, bearing pyrene and thiophene in the repeating groups. The physical, optical, and electrochemical properties of this polymer were investigated, as well as the effect of structural modifications on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of thin film transistors (TFTs) and PSCs, respectively. The pyrene–DPP segment was expected to promote crystallinity and induce a low-lying HOMO level, whereas the thiophene–DPP segment enhanced carrier mobility. Compared with D–A binary alternating copolymers, the PDPPPyT terpolymer showed face-on orientation of the polymer chains on the substrate. Although PDPPPyT has two different donating units which can hamper the molecular stacking behaviour, its TFT showed a high charge carrier mobility of 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable to that of PDPPPy and PDPPT. In particular, the PDPPPyT-based PV cell with PC71BM exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.0%, which is much higher than that of PDPPPy and PDPPT-based PV cells.

2.3. Instruments and measurements

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury NMR 400 MHz spectrometer using deuterated chloroform (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). The molecular weights of the synthesized polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters GPC, Waters 515 pump, Waters 410 RI, 2 × PLgel Mixed-B) using polystyrene standards and chloroform (CHCl3) as the eluent (T = 35 °C) at the Korean Polymer Testing and Research Institute (Seoul, Korea). An elemental analyzer (Flash 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was employed to measure the contents of C, H, N, and S. The thermal properties of the three polymers were studied under a nitrogen atmosphere on a Mettler 821e differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The redox properties of the three polymers were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (EA161, eDAQ, scan rate = 20 mV s−1). The absorption spectra of the samples as thin films and in solution (CHCl3) were recorded on a HP 8453 photodiode array-type UV-Vis absorption spectrometer (λ = 190–1100 nm). The polymer thin films were coated on a Pt plate using a CHCl3 solution. The electrolyte solution was 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in distilled acetonitrile. Ag/AgCl and Pt wire (0.5 mm in diameter) electrodes were used as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively.
Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) measurements were performed at the 9A (U-SAXS) beamline (energy = 11.26 keV, pixel size = 79.6 μm, wavelength = 1.101 Å, 2θ = 0°–20°) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured with a Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI Inc.) operated at 300 kV accelerating voltage. Samples for TEM were prepared by dropping the blending solution on a carbon-coated copper grid.
2.4. Fabrication of organic thin film transistors
To study the charge transport properties of the polymers, the bottom-gate top-contact device geometry was employed to characterize the TFT performance. TFT devices were fabricated using n-doped Si/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates, where n-doped Si and SiO2 were used as the gate electrode and gate insulator, respectively. The substrate was cleaned by following the literature method and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h, and then treated with UV/ozone for 20 min.38n-Octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment was performed on the SiO2 gate dielectrics to form a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer on the SiO2/Si substrate before the deposition of the polymer semiconductors.
The polymer layer was prepared on the OTS-SiO2/Si substrates by spin-coating a 4 mg mL−1 chloroform solution under air atmosphere at 2000 rpm for 30 s. To anneal the TFTs, the samples were placed on a hotplate in air for 10 min. Finally, source and drain electrodes were prepared by thermal evaporation of gold (∼80 nm) with a channel width of 1500 μm and a length of 100 μm. The field-effect mobility upon saturation (μ) was calculated from the equation: IDS = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − Vth)2, where W/L is the channel width/length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate insulator layer, and VG and Vth are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively. Mobility data were obtained from more than 20 TFT devices and averaged.
2.5. Fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass was cleaned using the literature method.3 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Heraeus Clevios P VP Al4083) was spin coated onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The PEDOT:PSS layer was heated at 155 °C for 20 min. A mixture of polymer and PC71BM (1:2 wt ratio) was dissolved in a solution that consisted of anhydrous chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (4:1 v/v). A 1.0 nm layer of lithium fluoride (LiF) was vacuum deposited on top of the photoactive layer and then covered with 100 nm of aluminium (Al). The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. A 300 W Xe lamp with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used as the light source. An AM 1.5 filter (Oriel) and a neutral density filter were used to reduce the light intensity, and a calibrated broadband optical power meter (Spectra Physics, Model 404) was used to measure the incident light intensity.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Design, polymerization, and characterization
To investigate the physical and electronic properties of a DPP-based alternating regular terpolymer, we chose pyrene and thiophene units as electron donating groups. According to our previous study, DPP and pyrene-based D–A copolymers exhibit high crystallinity owing to the planar and symmetric pyrene moieties. In addition, the polymer has an absorption wavelength range below 800 nm and exhibits a low-lying HOMO level. However, the solubility and electronic performance of this copolymer are relatively low compared with DPP-based copolymers containing thiophene moieties.4,25–31 Thiophene containing copolymers show high solubility, crystallinity, and good electronic performance. Additionally, the absorption range is expanded to wavelengths greater than 900 nm, which indicates a low optical bandgap.23,32,33
Using the above-mentioned design concept, we successfully synthesized an alternating regular terpolymer, PDPPPyT, to combine the properties of the two alternating copolymers PDPPPy and PDPPT. The synthetic procedures for all these polymers are shown in Scheme 1. PDPPPy was synthesized through Suzuki coupling polymerization of compounds 2 and 6. PDPPT was prepared through a Stille coupling of compound 6 and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene.

PDPPPyT was synthesized according to the following synthetic procedures. 3-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (1) was synthesized by bromination of 2,5-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione with NBS. Compound 2 was reacted with compound 1 to yield 6,6′-(5,5′-(pyrene-2,7-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2,5-bis(2-decyltetra decyl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione) (3) through a Suzuki coupling reaction. Another bromination was carried out to give compound 4 in a 77% yield. Using 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, the final polymerization to obtain PDPPPyT was conducted with compound 4 through Suzuki polymerization.
All three polymers were purified via Soxhlet extraction to afford solid products. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) measured by GPC were 94.8, 197, and 46.6 kDa for PDPPPy, PDPPPyT, and PDPPT, respectively, at 35 °C. The thermal properties of the polymers were characterized by DSC (Fig. S4†).
Compared with PDPPPy, PDPPPyT exhibited better solubility in chloroform and halogenated aromatic solvents, such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, which is attributed to the addition of a thiophene-based DPP monomer.
3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in solution and film states are shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. PDPPPy exhibited absorption maximum wavelengths (λmaxs) at 704 nm in solution and 712 nm in the film state. PDPPT showed more red-shifted absorption because of greater electron donation from the thiophene unit than from the pyrene unit.33 Interestingly, the absorption spectrum of PDPPPyT was located between those of PDPPPy and PDPPT. The addition of the thiophene–DPP monomeric unit into the DPP–pyrene repeating groups effectively modulated the molecular energy levels and bandgap energy. Tuning of the molecular energy levels was successfully achieved by synthesizing a terpolymer bearing two different donor units and one acceptor unit in the repeating group.

The thin films of PDPPPy and PDPPT exhibited slightly red shifted λmax values owing to enhanced intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains, whereas PDPPPyT showed very similar spectra in solution and in the film state.8,34,35 This result suggests that the chains of PDPPPyT were pre-organized owing to strong intra- and intermolecular interactions in solution. The optical bandgap energies of the three polymers were calculated from the cut-off of absorption in the film state as 1.65, 1.50, and 1.30 eV for PDPPPy, PDPPPyT, and PDPPT, respectively. Thus, the regular terpolymer displayed an intermediate bandgap by combining the DPP acceptor and two different donors. The electrochemical properties of the polymer thin films were measured by CV to evaluate the molecular electronic energy levels; the results are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO levels of the polymers were calculated from the on-set oxidation potential and were −5.27 and −5.16 eV for PDPPPy and PDPPT, respectively. The HOMO of the PDPPPyT terpolymer was located at −5.21 eV, which is between the HOMO of PDPPPy and the HOMO of PDPPT. This result indicates that the addition of thiophene–DPP into the PDPPPy backbone could enhance the election donating ability of the terpolymer. Therefore, PDPPPyT displayed a higher lying HOMO level and a smaller optical bandgap than PDPPPy (Fig. 2).

GI-XRD was employed to investigate the crystalline properties and specific polymer chain arrangements on the substrate, which could provide a better understanding of the relationship between the conjugated repeating group and film morphology. All measured XRD parameters are displayed in Tables S1–S3.†
As shown in Fig. 3, PDPPPy showed (h00) diffraction patterns, which are attributed to periodic lamellar stacking of the polymer chains in the out-of-plane profiles. PDPPPy showed fourth-ordered (h00) diffraction peaks (Fig. 3), which resulted in the formation of crystalline lamellar structures on the substrate. As expected, the degree of crystallinity was enhanced by thermal annealing of the film. The (h00) diffraction intensities in the qz direction increased to show more uniform, ordered polymer crystallites in the film state. The (010) diffraction peak of PDPPPy in the qxy direction was also clearly observed, indicating that the edge-on orientation of the polymer chains is predominant over the face-on orientation. Compared with PDPPPy, the PDPPT film was shown to be less crystalline and the face-on orientation was relatively dominant in the pristine film. However, high crystallinity and edge-on orientation of PDPPT were observed in the thermally annealed film over 200 °C. Interestingly, the face-on orientation of the polymer chains in PDPPPyT was unambiguously observed before and after thermal annealing, supported by the existence of the (010) diffraction peak along the qz direction.

VDS = −100 V. 
From the (010) diffraction, the π–π stacking distances of all the polymers were calculated to be 3.75–3.81 Å, which are acceptable values compared to DPP-based polymers in the literature.36 From the GI-XRD results, the π–π stacking distance of the regular terpolymer bearing two different donating units is quite similar to that of the two copolymers with a single donating unit.
3.3. Characterization of TFT device performance
The effects of the thiophene–DPP unit in the repeating group of PDPPPyT on the charge transport properties were investigated by fabricating TFTs. We fabricated top-contact and bottom-gate TFTs by spin-coating polymer solutions onto OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates, and the device properties of the as-spun and thermally annealed polymer films were characterized. The fabricated TFT devices were characterized under ambient conditions, and all devices exhibited typical p-type transistor behaviour characterized by field effect current generation across the source and drain electrodes on applying negative gate voltage (VG). Although PDPPPy exhibited highly ordered lamellar structures with dense π–π stacking, PDPPPy and PDPPPyT displayed similar carrier mobilities in the corresponding TFT devices, as shown in Fig. 3d and e and Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the hole mobilities of the pristine film-based TFTs were almost identical for PDPPPy and PDPPPyT (0.13 and 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). The hole mobility of PDPPT was 0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine film and 1.77 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the film annealed at 200 °C, which are significantly higher values than those for PDPPPy. Interestingly, even after thermal annealing, the mobility values in PDPPPy and PDPPPyT showed similar increments and were almost the same. Although PDPPPyT showed less crystallinity and face-on orientation of the polymer chains, the corresponding TFTs displayed comparable charge transport capabilities, which might be ascribed to the presence of thiophene–DPP units in the polymer backbone.

3.4. PSC performance of the blend films with PC71BM
To optimize the performance of the copolymer-based solar cells, various devices were fabricated with the three polymers. The structural effects of using a regular terpolymer on PSC performance were investigated by fabricating bulk heterojunction devices with a standard ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al configuration. To control all potential variables, the solar cell photoactive layers were fabricated using the same blend ratio (polymer:PC71BM = 1:2) and a solution concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The device performance was measured under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G.

Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PDPPPy, PDPPPyT, and PDPPT-based PSCs with/without the solvent additive, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The overall device performance is summarized in Table 3. As was expected from the CV results PDPPPy and PDPPT-based PSCs had open-circuit voltage (Voc) values of 0.78 and 0.72 V, respectively. Interestingly, the Voc value of PDPPPyT, which contains both pyrene–DPP and thiophene–DPP units, is 0.76 V, which falls between the values of the D–A polymers. However, all these devices exhibited low PCE values (1.13%, 0.74%, and 0.83% for PDPPPy, PDPPPyT, and PDPPT, respectively), which are due to the low short circuit current (Jsc) values. This might be attributed to poor nanophase segregation and poor exciton diffusion behaviour.

When a solvent additive, DIO, was added to the blend solution, the PCE values of all the PSC devices changed significantly. The device with PDPPPyT and 3 vol% DIO had a higher PCE value (∼4.0%) than the devices based on PDPPPy (3.28%) and PDPPT (2.16%).
To support the result of the improved photovoltaic performance, the internal morphology of the active PSC layer was recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5, the polymer:PC71BM blended films without DIO have coarse dispersive domains. This morphology can be a factor in hampering exciton diffusion, giving rise to low Jsc values and poor PCE values. The internal structure of the film after adding DIO was significantly different. The large crystallites and phase-separated domains disappeared and a very fine morphology was observed, resulting in favourable exciton diffusion and dissociated charge transport. Among the films, that of PDPPPyT showed a much finer and denser texture and nanophase separation between the polymer and PC71BM crystallites, which could result in a high PCE with a high Jsc value.6,7,37

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSC devices are displayed in Fig. 4b. PDPPPy and PDPPPyT exhibited highly efficient light-harvesting behaviour, ranging from λ = 300 to 900 nm. In particular, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the PDPPPyT device showed much larger EQE in the 800–900 nm range. This is the crucial factor resulting in a higher Jsc value in the corresponding PSC. It can be conjectured that the nanophase-separation between the polymer and PC71BM crystallites was achieved to a moderate extent by molecular mixing.
4. Conclusions
We designed and synthesized a new regular terpolymer, PDPPPyT, with pyrene and thiophene as electron donating units in the repeating group. As a control, the PDPPPy and PDPPT copolymers were also synthesized, and the electronic and optoelectronic properties were compared. Compared with the D–A copolymers, the regular terpolymer thin film showed face-on orientation of the polymer chains on the substrate. Although PDPPPyT has two different donating units and a face-on orientational character, the corresponding TFT showed a high charge carrier mobility of 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, the PDPPPyT-based PSC device integrated with PC71BM and 3 vol% DIO exhibited the highest PCE of 4.0%. The structure of the regular terpolymer played an important role in tuning the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and absorption spectrum, and in steering the solid-state morphology of the blend matrix with PC71BM to obtain an efficient PCE value.
