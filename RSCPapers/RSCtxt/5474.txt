With increasing deployment of intermittent renewable energy, there is a recognised need for scalable options for grid-scale, long-term, high energy density, energy storage. Grid-scale energy storage combined with carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) potentially provides a high level of flexibility and reliability. However, previous power-to-gas (P2G) studies have only examined the use of synthetic natural gas (SNG) derived from electrolytic hydrogen and either biomass- or industrially-derived CO2 for this application; making the whole power-to-power (P2P) value chain low carbon at best. Instead, our work assesses the techno-economic feasibility of using direct air capture to develop truly carbon-neutral P2P pathways. After assessing nine net-zero emission configurations using existing technologies, we found that using SNG as an energy storage carrier may be the least expensive route despite being more complex than power-to-hydrogen (P2H). P2H is currently held back by the high cost of H2 storage and the low volumetric density of H2 relative to SNG. Thus, bringing down the cost of H2 storage and building more salt caverns will be imperative for P2H, whereas reducing the cost of carbon capture should be a key priority for accelerating the deployment of power-to-methane (P2M) technologies.
Introduction
One of the biggest challenges of the 21st century is climate change. With an ever-increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere, officially exceeding 400 ppm in 2016,4 there is a real urgency to curb these emissions and prevent further global temperature rises. Meeting international targets, such as avoiding the 1.5–2 °C scenarios5 will require implementing energy systems with zero-emissions by the mid-point of the century.6 To decarbonise the electricity sector, which makes up 42% of global CO2 emissions,7 there has been an increasing deployment of renewable energy technologies, especially wind and solar power. Unfortunately, these technologies lack the dispatchable characteristics of fossil fuel-fired power plants, and depend on the regional climate.9 Their intermittent behaviour means they have low capacity factors, and hence large installed capacities are required.10,11 To overcome this challenge, there has been a lot of interest in developing compatible energy storage technologies to store the excess electricity generated during peak solar and wind conditions to balance the grid when supply is low.2,11–14
Several options have been proposed for energy storage, including pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), fly wheels, compressed air energy storage (CAES), and batteries. However, chemical energy storage of H2 and CH4/synthetic natural gas (SNG) is the only option that offers sufficient storage capacity and long enough discharge times to meet grid-scale energy demands. At 100 bar, CH4 caverns can store ∼1000 kW h Nm−3, while compressed air has a significantly lower energy density of 0.4–20 kW h Nm−3 and pumped hydro can only store 0.5–1.3 kW h Nm−3 (Fig. 1).15 Furthermore, gas storage is less geologically limited compared to PHES, which requires large elevated bodies of water. However, gas storage is only viable in regions with aboveground/underground geological storage, e.g., oil and gas reservoirs, aquifers, salt cavity formations.16

In light of this, there has been increasing interest in power-to-gas (P2G) and power-to-liquid (P2L) technologies which convert electricity into an energy carrier, which typically contains hydrogen.21,22 Although P2L technologies seem promising, this study focuses on P2G technology configurations. P2G comprises of renewable power conversion to H2via electrolysis, with the option of combining it with CO2 to create synthetic CH4.24 For the lifecycle of this process to be considered “green”, it is imperative to have a sustainable carbon source. Carbon dioxide can be sourced from industrial processes, biomass or from the air. However, utilisation of CO2 from industrial sources will unavoidably result in CO2 leakage to the atmosphere and relies upon the continued extraction of fossil fuels,27 therefore, at best resulting in a partial decarbonisation outcome. On the other hand, biomass is a limited resource and its sustainability is heavily dependent on its supply chain emissions.28,29 Given these issues, we should use CO2 captured from the air – a more sustainable source. This can be achieved using direct air capture (DAC) technologies. Converting the electrolytic H2 to CH4/SNG can be advantageous as natural gas storage infrastructure already exists.31,32 This is feasible because the Wobbe index, an indicator of the interchangeability of fuel gases, for methanation-derived SNG is essentially identical to that of natural gas. In contrast, H2 storage methods and pure H2-fired turbines are relatively newer concepts, and are currently more expensive than natural gas technology equivalents.34
Traditionally, research on these renewable P2G scenarios has only examined processes which either just produce H2 (ref. 36) or CH4/SNG, using CO2 obtained from biomass or industrial sources.8,37–40 However, such studies have yet to present a whole-systems analysis of the integrated process, comparing multiple pathways and different energy carriers/vectors. Although independent sources such as biomass conversion and industrial processes may be more flexible, the air represents a sustainable, reliable source of CO2, which upon final product combustion, forms a complete “closed carbon loop”. Currently, several DAC technologies are close to deployment and it will be interesting to see whether they can play a key role in power-to-power (P2P) systems (i.e., electrical energy to chemical energy to electrical energy). To this end, this study evaluates the techno-economic potential of various carbon neutral P2P processes, which use either H2 or CH4/SNG as the energy storage vector.
Methodology
Process description
For our study, we investigated nine net carbon-neutral P2P scenarios (Case 1–9), which only use water and air as the non-energy feedstocks (illustrated in Fig. 2). A myriad of technologies could be used to represent each of the different sub-components/sub-processes in these scenarios (e.g., H2 production from biological processes, alkaline electrolysers, or solid oxide electrolysers; and H2/CH4 to electricity via CCGT or fuel cells). Rather than evaluating every possible combination, relatively well-understood technology archetypes were chosen to represent each sub-component (e.g., DAC, CCGT). As combustion power generation is considered, it was possible to assess the impact of having a post-combustion capture (PCC) unit to recycle CO2, operating synergistically with DAC.
 Fig. 2  Net zero carbon power-to-power (P2P) scenarios (Case 1–9) for grid-scale energy storage, which only use water and air as the non-energy feedstocks. Renewable power is used to remove CO2 from air (i.e., direct air capture, DAC) while also producing hydrogen. In some cases, H2 is combined with CO2, and converted into CH4 using SMR or ATR. The H2/SNG is stored as chemical energy, before being converted to electrical energy (either HTCC or CCGT). For some cases, CO2 is recovered from flue gas or the SMR/ATR process with post-combustion capture (PCC) and recycled. 
The nine net zero carbon P2P scenarios are (Fig. 2):
• Case 1 represents our reference “Power-to-Hydrogen” (P2H) process whereby hydrogen is produced through water electrolysis using renewable energy. The H2 is stored in a salt cavern underground and then withdrawn and combusted in a H2-fired gas turbine combined cycle (denoted HTCC).
• Case 2 represents production, storage and combustion of SNG using electrolytically-derived H2 and CO2 captured from the air via DAC as the inputs. Note that we do not assume 100% conversion of CO2 to CH4. Instead, we obtain a mixture that is rich in CH4 but also contains CO and CO2, hence we call it SNG. This option represents a carbon-neutral cyclic process in which the CO2 is recycled between the process chain and the air feed into the DAC unit.
• Case 3 is similar to Case 2 but 90% of the CO2 emitted from combustion of SNG is captured and recycled back into the methanation reactor. The other 10% is recycled via the feed air into DAC.
• Cases 4 and 5 mirror the processes described in Cases 2 and 3 but the sequence is reversed for the storage and methanation steps. In these scenarios, H2 is stored instead of SNG and the methanation plant is downstream of the H2 storage. Here, the main differences will be the costs attributed to gas storage and the combustion plant (i.e., hydrogen vs. SNG).
• Cases 6 and 7 evaluate alternative routes for recycling carbon. The stored SNG, is reformed back into H2 for combustion in a HTCC. The CO2 produced from burning SNG to heat the reformer is either recycled via the air feed into DAC (Case 6), or recycled to the methanation reactor (Case 7).
• Case 8 and 9 are similar to Case 6 and 7 but convert the CH4 to H2 using autothermal reforming (ATR) rather than steam methane reforming (SMR).
To estimate the cost and performance of each pathway, we assume the final power output of 500 MWe for each single chain of processes. We size and cost a single combustion plant, electrolyser, and salt cavern for each 500 MWe chain. For Cases 2–9, we assume a single DAC plant, methanation plant, and reforming plant. This means that a 5 GWe system would need 10 of each component.
Methodology and assumptions
To assess the techno-economic potential of each pathway, we first modelled each option using Aspen Plus to obtain mass and energy balances. In Aspen Plus, the Redlich–Kwong–Soave equation of state was chosen as the property method and the IAPWS-95 free-water method was used. A parametric costing technique using literature data was then employed to estimate the costs. The capital/investment costs were estimated by scaling quotations found in the literature using the six-tenths rule (eqn (1)). For a fair comparison, all costs were converted into GBP and adjusted using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI index) to the year 2017. Data taken from sources which do not quote a cost year were assumed to be based on prices two years prior to the date of publication. (1)where C1 = capital cost of project with capacity X1, C2 = capital cost of project with capacity X2 and n is taken to be 0.6. The six-tenths rule offers a rule-of-thumb estimate but may not be a perfect assumption. To better understand the impact of costs, a sensitivity analysis was carried out over the investment costs for each sub-process (e.g., DAC, HTCC) to determine its impact on the final LCOE.

Fig. 3 illustrates the range of literature values for the investment costs of each process when scaled to the same capacity (also presented in Table SI1 of the ESI†). The scarcity/abundance and distribution of cost data is discussed in the subsequent sections. Owing to the skew in data, the median was used for comparison instead of the geometric mean to give a better estimate of the probable cost associated with each technology. The assumptions used for determining the operating costs and utility prices can be found in the ESI (Tables SI2 and SI3†).
 Fig. 3  Scaled investments costs for each of the main processes using the sixth-tenths rule based on literature data. All technologies (excluding DAC) are scaled to a 1 TW hLHV capacity, assuming 8760 hours of operation a year. DAC is scaled to 1 MtCO2 capture. The red box plot shows the median (middle) with 25th and 75th quartile range. See Table S1† for references. 
Water electrolysis
The investment costs for electrolysis have been taken from a number of sources but the majority of estimates have been from small- to medium-sized electrolysers (<200 MW). The only cost estimate for large-scale electrolysers (1.5 GWHHV) was found in the H21 Leeds City Gate project report.43 It is worth noting that the economies of scale are limited for electrolysis systems as the rate of H2 production is linearly dependant on the cell area. Only the cost of auxiliaries reduces with scale.8 Technology cost reduction can also occur as a result of cost learning effects. These learning rates are specific to individual technologies due to various factors, e.g., modular system vs. large process, market-push, government support, information transfer rate.44 The sensitivity analysis is used to demonstrate how reduction (or increase) in capital cost of individual components/technologies can impact the LCOE.
Alkaline electrolysers (AEL) are currently the cheapest and most reliable technology, whereas polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers are easily switched on/off and are more suitable for deployment at H2 refuelling stations.45,46 It is likely that PEM electrolysers will be more promising in the future as they have a better dynamic response and a more compact design.47 Solid oxide electrolysers (SOECs) are still in their development phase but are attractive owing to their low electricity consumption and potential synergy with the exothermic methanation process. In these configurations, the heat produced by the methanation reactor can be used to run the electrolyser.48 However, as they are now, SOECs are estimated to be twice as expensive as AELs.8 For our analysis, we only consider AELs since it is well-established and its cost data is more readily obtainable. AELs are typically made up of two electrodes immersed in a liquid electrolyte containing 25–30% KOH solution. For all electrolysis technologies, water is reduced to H2 and OH− (eqn (2)) at a negatively charged cathode, while the O2− is oxidised back into O2 (eqn (3)) at the positively charged anode. Cathode: 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(2) (3) (4)
Since only the H2 production rate is required to estimate the cost of an electrolyser, we modelled it as a black box separator (eqn (4)), assuming perfect separation of water into H2 and O2. Depending on the case scenario, the H2 is either combusted, stored or converted to CH4, whereas the O2 is used in the downstream combustion processes. For this high-level analysis, the cost of transporting O2 was not considered. To estimate the operating costs, only water and electricity are considered as inputs. To calculate the electrolyser electricity consumption, an electrolyser efficiency of 70% efficiency (LHV) was assumed.43
Direct air capture (DAC)
Currently, there are a few DAC technologies that are being demonstrated and each one differs significantly from the other. Some of the main market leaders in DAC technology are Carbon Engineering, Global Thermostat, and Climeworks.49 Since these technologies strip CO2 from the air, which has a very low concentration of CO2 (∼300 times less than coal-based flue gas),50 very large process units are likely to be required. Combined with the high energy requirements to draw in CO2, regenerate the capture sorbents and compress the CO2, this can result in very high costs of capture.50,51 Ishimoto et al.52 carried out a literature review on the cost of these technologies and found a range of 10–1000 USD per tCO2 for the levelised cost of CO2 capture. This range may reflect the fact that DAC technologies are very different. However, based on existing knowledge of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes, the higher range of costs likely represents more reliable calculated costs.
For our analysis, we take the costs reported by Keith et al.3 for the Carbon Engineering process (Fig. 4). Their estimates for an Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) plant was taken as a lower bound estimate for our costs, while the estimated investment cost for a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) plant was used as our upper limit. The reason we based our calculation on this process is due to the fact that the cost data and assumptions have been made transparent and is reasonably comprehensive in Keith et al.,3 making it a reliable starting point for DAC costing. In this process, potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used as a solvent to strip CO2 from the air. After this reaction, the carbonate (K2CO3), which is produced is fed into a kiln and calcined at 900–1000 °C into CaO. The CaO undergoes a hydration reaction to form Ca(OH)2, which is used to regenerate the KOH solvent when reacted with K2CO3. For simplicity, the DAC process was also modelled as a black box separator, assuming 74.5% (ref. 3) CO2 capture. The costs of raw materials are calculated using the solvent requirements detailed by Keith et al.3 The solvent and sorbent purge rates were assumed to be 1 and 3%, respectively, and their costs were determined based on market prices.53,54 Since only renewably-produced electricity is considered in our study, we assume that all heat requirements are satisfied by converting H2 or CH4 (depending on which gas is stored) to electricity and assuming 80% for the boiler efficiency.55

Methanation
There are two main routes to producing synthetic CH4, chemical-catalytic and biological methanation. Chemical routes are more readily scalable but require expensive catalysts (Ru, Rh or Ni)56 and high temperatures and pressures for operation. In contrast, biological routes operate at milder operating conditions (i.e., ambient temperature and pressure), however, are much more difficult to control. Moreover, biological routes only exist at small scale.57,58 For our study, we only consider the chemical option as it is more suitable for large-scale applications59 and has already reached commercial scale.60 Chemical methanation is carried out via the Sabatier reaction, which is essentially the reverse of steam methane reforming. Both CO and CO2 can be converted to CH4 (eqn (5) and (6)):61 CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O ΔH0r = −206 kJ mol−1(5) CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O ΔH0r = −165 kJ mol−1(6)
The Sabatier reaction is a highly exothermic, reversible reaction, hence, low temperatures are preferred. High pressures will also help increase conversion owing to Le Chatelier's principle. Although the Sabatier process has had over 100 years of research and process development, there has been ongoing reactor design optimisation to improve their temperature control and drive down costs. Research in this area has only really been intensified in the past couple of decades owing to its potential for CO2 utilisation and key role in P2G processes.61–64 Although methanation reactors are available commercially, most are used for converting CO rather than CO2.61,64 Of the CO2 methanation plants that do exist, the largest one (6 MWe) belongs to Audi AG and began operation in 2013.60 This plant uses H2 produced from solar-powered electrolysis and CO2 from biogas to generate a mixture of H2 and SNG (e-gas) which can be fed into Germany's natural gas network.65 However, owing to the lack of experience at scale and previous motivation, detailed cost calculations for CO2 methanation are rare.66 Moreover, most studies report the combined cost of electrolysis with methanation without stating their individual contribution to the overall cost.2,67–69
In this work, the methanation reactor was modelled with, an RGibbs (thermodynamic equilibrium) reactor, assuming an operating temperature and pressure of 300 °C and 20 bar, respectively. The inlet H2/CO2 ratio was set to 4 to maximise CO2 conversion.8 Excessively high operating temperatures (>400 °C) would lead to methane decomposition, more expensive construction material, and catalyst sintering. Conversely, temperatures that are too low (<200 °C) would lead to nickel carbonyl formation and poor catalytic activity.2 The steam in the reactor effluent stream is knocked out in a flash drum, assuming perfect water separation. Since the reactor effluent is ∼90% CH4 rather than pure CH4, the LHV of the mixture was assumed to be the same as natural gas (47 MJ kg−1)70 for our calculations.
Underground gas storage
Seasonal energy storage requires facilities with capacities in the TW h order of magnitude.71 To meet this requirement, underground storage in the form of depleted oil and gas reservoirs, aquifers and salt caverns are commonly used.72 Oil and gas reservoirs typically have the largest capacity but also require a greater proportion of cushion gas and therefore have a smaller working gas volume in practice. In contrast, salt caverns have the smallest capacity but also have the highest working gas-to-cushion gas ratio.73 The working gas volume refers to the gas that can be injected and withdrawn while the cushion gas refers to gas that must be kept within the storage site to ensure structural stability.74 Salt caverns are also more gas tight, and their small size allows higher cycling rates (approximately 1–3 times a month).75
One of the advantages of storing CH4/SNG over H2, is that CH4 has a lower compressibility factor (0.94 vs. 1.05 at 100 bar and 92 °C).71 This means that a higher working gas volume can be stored under identical cavern operating conditions (volume and pressure). In addition, a lower compressibility factor means the maximum injection and withdrawal rates are higher. Another advantage of storing CH4/SNG is that it has a higher volumetric energy density than H2. Under the same pressure (or depth of cavern), CH4/SNG can store approximately three times more energy per unit volume. On the other hand, H2 has a lower viscosity so there are less dynamic pressure losses during injection and withdrawal. Another consideration that must be made when designing the storage operating facility is the operating pressure. Owing to the low density of H2, the operating facility must run at relatively higher pressure because the static head difference between the well head and the cavern is very small.76 In addition, the small molecular size of H2 means more work must be done to compress H2 before storage.77 These effects combined make H2 storage the more expensive option (per unit of energy stored).
In this study, we assume the gases are stored in salt caverns operated at 105 bar and ∼50 °C, and sized so that only one cavern is required per electrolyser unit.18 The scaling of costs is based directly on the total volume that can be stored and for this, we take and scaled values from literature, which are given as a combined cost that already accounts for costs of surface facilities and cushion gas. Note that the surface facilities can make up more than half the total investment cost.17
Combustion of stored gas to produce power
Combustion of natural gas with CCGTs/CCGT-CCS is very well understood so there is a wide range of cost data available.78 On the other hand, research into H2 combustion for power generation has predominantly focused on integrated gas combined cycles (IGCCs), which run on syngas (mixture of H2 and CO) rather than pure H2.79,80 The Fusina power station (Italy) is the first demonstration-scale pure hydrogen-fired gas turbine combined cycle (HTCC), starting operation in 2010 and is operated by ENEL. This plant has an output capacity of 16 MW and the project costed 53 M EUR2017.81 Given that this is currently the only realistic cost estimate for a pure H2-fired plant, this figure was used for our calculations. By gaining more experience in construction and operation of these H2-fired power plants at scale, the costs will likely come down and approach that of conventional CCGTs. From a technological point of view, HTCC will be expected to cost only 5–10% more than a regular CCGT.43 The main difference between a HTCC and a regular CCGT will be the method for controlling NOx emissions. In a natural gas-fired CCGT, the fuel is premixed with air at a higher-than-stoichiometric ratio to minimise NOx formation but for H2, which has a wider range of flammability limits, this is unsafe.82 Instead, the H2 fuel gas must be diluted with an inert gas such as CO2, N2 or steam. Moderation of the flame temperature with steam injection can help reduce NOx formation. Moreover, conventional post-combustion NOx removal technologies such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be used to further remove NOx to better comply with emission regulations.43 A report by Uniper Technologies83 suggests that the additional water in the flue gas from H2 production (by SMR) can reduce the turbine efficiency by 2%, whereas Chiesa et al.82 showed that the LHV efficiency can be ±1% depending on the setup.
For our analysis, we model the power production as a simplified combined cycle. Synthetic nature gas, H2 and O2 (from the electrolyser) are compressed and then combusted in a furnace, which is modelled with an RGibbs reactor. The hot flue gas exiting the reactor is expanded through a turbine to produce power. The flue gas leaving the turbine is then used to heat a steam cycle and power a steam turbine. We assumed an overall LHV efficiency of 60% for the unabated CCGT plants to be in line with the performance of modern gas turbines.84,85 The CCGT-CCS units were modelled in the same way as the CCGT plants but with an additional black box separator to simulate the post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) unit. The overall efficiency of the CCGT-CCS was assumed to reduce by 10% (54% LHV efficiency) to account for the energy requirements of the PCC unit. This is in line with the 11% relative efficiency used in the GCCSI report,86 the 12% suggested by John Wood Group PLC87,88 and the 5–10% reduction in efficiency discussed by Bui et al.89
Methane to hydrogen
The most conventional way to convert CH4 back into H2 is through SMR. In a typical SMR plant, CH4 is reacted with steam over a bed of Ni catalyst inside a reformer. The reactor effluent is then passed through a shift reactor to improve the H2 yield, and then through a pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) unit to separate the product H2. One of the key design criteria is the steam/carbon (S/C) ratio entering the reformer. Using higher ratios can reduce methane slip (unreacted methane) but at the cost of using more energy. Typically a S/C ratio between 2.5 and 4 is used.33 Steam reforming involves a number of reactions (key reactions are highlighted in eqn (7)–(9)) and is overall highly endothermic. This means that the reaction favours high operating temperatures. To supply this heat, fresh CH4 is mixed with a small portion of the PSA tail gas and combusted in the furnace, in which the reactor tubes are immersed.90 CH4(g) + 2H2O(g) ↔ 4H2(g) + CO2(g) ΔH298 = 165 kJ mol−1(7) CH4(g) + H2O(g) ↔ 3H2(g) + CO(g) ΔH298 = 206 kJ mol−1(8) CO(g) + H2O(g) ↔ CO2(g) + H2(g) ΔH298 = −41.2 kJ mol−1(9)
Aside from SMR, it is also possible to transform CH4 to H2 using ATR. Here, the heat is generated inside the reactor using O2 to oxidise the CH4 in the SNG mixture. This process is described by eqn (10) and (11).91,92 One of the advantages of ATR is that the ratio of H2 to CO in the product syngas can be controlled. The ATR process is only preferred when either a low H2/CO ratio is desired or pure oxygen can be obtained cheaply.93 2CH4(g) + O2(g) + CO2(g) → 3H2(g) + 3CO(g) + H2O(g) ΔH298 = −30.7 kJ mol−1(10) 4CH4(g) + O2(g) + 2H2O(g) → 10H2(g) + 4CO(g) ΔH298 = 340 kJ mol−1(11)
The reformer for SMR and ATR processes was modelled in Aspen Plus with an RGibbs reactor using the conditions presented in Table 1. The PSA unit was assumed to have a H2 recovery of 90% and can deliver pure H2.94 Similar to the methanation reactor, this process model was used to give an estimate of the flow rates and utilities consumption so the reactor was not modelled in more detail. The assumptions we made for the operating conditions of each process are summarised in Table 1.

Results and discussion
Investment costs

Fig. 5a shows the mass flow rates leaving the key sub-processes in our Aspen Plus models (stream table in the ESI, Table SI4†). By substituting and then converting the units of these values into eqn (1) for the capacity, X2, it was possible to estimate the capital cost (C2). Fig. 5b shows the overall investment costs required to build net carbon neutral P2P infrastructure, based on Cases 1–9, which can store and deliver 10% of the UK's total annual electricity generation (∼36 days of storage or 33.59 TW h per year95).

Case 1: the results suggest that the simplest process chain may not be the least expensive (12–49 Bn GBP2017). It appears to be disadvantaged by the cost of H2 storage. H2 has a lower volumetric energy density compared to natural gas so more/deeper caverns must be built to store the same amount of energy. Although storing natural gas in salt caverns is common practice, storing H2 underground is relatively new so the reported cost estimates are higher than those for CH4 storage. Currently, there are only a few examples of H2 being stored around the world such as the Clemens Terminal in Texas (∼0.1 TW h) and Teeside in the UK (3.5 GW h).71 Once H2 salt cavern development accelerates with the help of demonstration projects such as H21 (ref. 25) and Hynet in the UK,96 this cost will likely come down, approaching values close to natural gas caverns. At this point, the main difference will be in the cost of construction material, compression units (H2 compression is more energy intensive) and the cost of the cushion gas (higher market price of H2). However, until then, converting the H2 to CH4 before storage (Case 2, 3, 6–9) is much more economically attractive.
Case 2 vs. Case 3: the largest cost associated with Case 2 is attributed to the DAC unit. Unfortunately, there is a lack of detailed information for the various DAC technologies. Thus, it was difficult to select the most compatible DAC process (in terms of operating conditions, etc.) for our proposed process chains. Surprisingly, off-setting part of the DAC requirements by adding a PCC unit downstream of the CCGT to capture and recycle CO2 from SNG combustion (Case 3) resulted in very marginal cost savings (going from 9–30 Bn GBP2017 to 7–29 Bn GBP2017). This can be explained by a cascading vs. trade-off effect. Although DAC is more expensive than PCC on a cost-per-CO2 captured basis, the energy penalty imposed by PCC has a cascading effect that results in the need for more fuel to be burnt to give the same net power output (i.e., more H2 needs to be produced and therefore a bigger electrolyser is required). This effect is reflected in the difference in water requirements between each scenario for DAC-only (Cases 2, 4, 6, 8) and DAC & PCC (Cases 3, 5, 7, 9) in Fig. 5a, and demonstrated by their corresponding round-trip efficiency in Table 2. Although Case 3 appears to be slightly less expensive than Case 2, it has a more complex design. For Case 3 to work, the methanation plant may need to be constructed on the same site as the CCGT-CCS plant to facilitate the recycling of CO2. While, on the other hand, Case 2 is more flexible and potentially easier to operate.

Case 4 vs. Case 5: the difference between Cases 2/3 and 4/5 is the sequence of the individual processes in the P2P chain and the form in which energy is stored. In cases 2/3, SNG is produced and then stored, whereas Cases 4/5 stores H2, which is then withdrawn before being converted to SNG. In both cases, SNG is combusted in a CCGT to produce power. Comparison of Fig. 5a and b shows that despite the identical mass flows, it is more economical to store energy as SNG rather than H2 owing to the current high costs of H2 storage.
Case 6 vs. Case 7: converting SNG back into H2 through steam reforming (Cases 6) is, as expected, more expensive than combusting SNG directly. This is owed to the additional unit operations and low chemical-to-chemical energy efficiency of the reforming process. The overall endothermic nature of the reforming process means additional SNG must be burned to supply the heat for the process. This in turn, means more H2 must be produced by the electrolyser. Switching out the SMR plant with one equipped with CCS (Case 7) and offsetting some of the contribution made by DAC can markedly reduce the capital cost (from 17–50 Bn GBP2017 down to 11–46 Bn GBP2017).
Case 8 vs. Case 9: replacing the SMR plant (Case 6) with an ATR plant (Cases 8) resulted in marginally lower costs owing to ATR being the cheaper technology. Although additional SNG (and air) was not required for external heating in an ATR plant, more SNG is needed in the reformer. Interestingly, adding a PCC unit onto the back of the ATR process (Case 9) makes it the most expensive reforming option (18–52 Bn GBP2017). SMR plants require external combustion of SNG, which releases CO2 that is immediately available for capture. In contrast, SNG oxidation and reforming takes place in the same vessel for ATR. Consequently, all of the CO2 that is formed will take part in the water-gas-shift/reforming reactions, resulting in an effluent stream that has a relatively low concentration of CO2 and is uneconomical to recycle.
H2vs. CH4 storage
The results clearly demonstrate that the selection of storage medium is very important. Owing to its greater energy density, it is much cheaper to store a unit of energy as SNG rather than H2. At the time of writing, the UK has ∼12 TW h of salt cavern storage in operation with an additional 43 TW h planned.97 Assuming each cavern has a physical size of 300000 m3 with 70% working gas volume, this is equivalent to approximately 57 (existing) and 260 (existing and planned) SNG caverns, respectively. If the UK switches all its caverns to H2 (including those planned), then an additional 380 caverns of the same dimensions/depth will be needed to store ∼10% of the UK's annual electricity generation (∼33 TW h). Fig. 6 shows that if the UK wanted to store 100% of its annual electricity generation with SNG, it will need ∼1600 medium depth caverns (105 bar), whereas storing H2 would require ∼6400 caverns (assuming the same working pressure). Note that these cavern pressures are representative of the UK's Teeside, Cheshire Basin and East Yorkshire storage sites.17

Round-trip efficiency
One of the key performance indicators for these P2P pathways is their overall round-trip efficiency (Table 2). To calculate these, the individual efficiencies (Table 1) for electrolysis and the combustion processes were taken straight from literature, while the efficiency of methanation, reforming DAC and gas storage were calculated. Methanation and reforming efficiency losses were calculated using mass and energy balances conducted with Aspen Plus. For DAC, we scaled the energy consumption of the fans, pumps, calciner, slaker, air separation unit (ASU) and auxiliary equipment that were reported by Keith et al.3 For gas storage, we used Aspen Plus to model the surface process facility (a set of compressors with inter-stage cooling, and expanders with inter-stage heating), assuming 80% isentropic98,99 and 95% mechanical efficiency100,101 for the compressors and expanders, respectively. The gas was assumed to be compressed to 105 bar and then expanded 10 bar above the pressure required for the subsequent processing step. The number of compression stages were calculated so that the inter-stage temperature of the compressed gas was kept below 200 °C, accommodating for the flash point temperature of modern compressor oils.102 The inter-stage and final cooling temperature was taken to be 20 °C. The net power requirements (including heating/cooling) to compress the gas for storage and then re-expand it for use is given in Table 2.
From the results, it is clear that Case 1 (power-to-H2 power) is the most efficient route since it has the fewest unit operations (Fig. 1). All other processes require an electrolysis step but have more unit operations, so their round-trip efficiencies are intrinsically lower. In Cases 2–9, DAC consumes additional electrical energy while chemical energy is lost through the methanation and reforming processes. Owing to the aforementioned cascading and trade-off effect, recycling CO2 to relieve some of the burden on DAC did not have a significant effect on the round-trip efficiency. Although using PCC reduces the DAC power requirement from 340 MW to 37 MW (per 500 MW final power output), the energy penalty imposed by the PCC system (10% reduction in overall efficiency) means that more power needs to be supplied to the electrolyser (1640 MW vs. 1480 MW). Interestingly, the energy required to inject and deliver the gas only contributes ∼1 to 2% to the total electricity requirements regardless of whether the gas to be compressed is SNG or H2. The losses in efficiency are highlighted in the Sankey diagram (Fig. 7). For our calculations, we assume HTCCs to be just as efficient as CCGTs (60% LHV). However, if HTCCs were found to only have 39% LHV efficiency (or lower), then power-to-CH4-to-power will end up being more efficient.

Levelised cost of electricity
Using the calculated capital costs and operating costs (OpEX), it was also possible to determine a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). This metric is essentially the cost to build and operate a power-generating asset divided by the total electricity generated by the asset over its lifetime.103,104 The LCOE is normally quoted as a price per kW h of product.
Here, r is the discount rate, t is the lifetime of the assets, OIC is the overnight investment cost, and Elgen is the electricity generated. For our pathways, we assume that the cost of excess of electricity is not free of charge, and costs 0.09 GBP2017/kW h, also each component of the P2P runs at full load for 8760 hours a year. (12)
To be comparable with literature data, a discount rate of 8% was chosen. This value is representative of assets with a high systematic risk exposure.2Fig. 8 shows that just producing H2 (Case 1) has the lowest LCOE (0.36–0.69 GBP2017/kW h) but is more expensive than most battery storage options, compressed air energy storage (CAES) and pumped hydroelectricity storage (PHES). This LCOE value falls in closely with the 0.332 EUR2013/kW h calculated by Ferrero et al.103 for their H2-to-storage-to-fuel cell system (they assumed a discount rate of 5%). Although these LCOE values seem high, it is worth noting that the LCOE for battery systems in Fig. 8 are for applications at a much smaller scale (8 h of storage). For 2000 h of storage, battery storage and CAES are predicted (for year 2030) to be >1 GBP2017/kW h, whereas pumped hydro will be >0.4 GBP2017/kW h.105 Interestingly, recycling CO2 for methane production (Case 3) is the most economically-promising option (with LCOE at 0.32–0.52 GBP2017/kW h).

Sensitivity analysis
To quantify the impact of our various modelling assumptions on the LCOE, we ran a series of sensitivity analyses (presented in Fig. 9a–i and SI1 and SI2 of the ESI†). The sensitivity analysis used the median value estimates of investment costs (in Fig. 3) as the base case scenario, which corresponds to 0% change in investment cost in Fig. 9a–i.

Synergy between electrolyser and methanation plant
As discussed previously, there may be beneficial synergies when coupling high-temperature SOEC electrolysis with methanation, which could reduce methanation plant size and costs. A sensitivity analysis on the cost of electrolysis shows that a two-fold increase in electrolyser costs (as expected for SOECs) will increase the LCOE by roughly 2–5% (Fig. 9a). However, a reduction in the size of the methanation plant, and therefore investment cost, has a negligible effect on the LCOE of the system (Fig. 9c). These observations suggest that there may not be any economic incentives to opt for the more expensive electrolysis route (e.g., SOEC) if the goal is to downsize the methanation plant. This observation is in line with the findings by Parra and Patel106 who observed a minimal gain in LCOE when improving the electrolyser technology at the MW scale. Due to the relatively low electricity cost, the operating cost of electrolysers are small. Moreover, as shown, capital cost reduction of the electrolyser had a minimal effect on LCOE. Therefore, from a systems perspective, improving the efficiency or reducing cost of the electrolyser alone is negligible to the overall system (in terms of LCOE and round-trip efficiency).107
Cost of DAC
In this paper, we have evaluated the Carbon Engineering DAC process as this was the only technology evaluated in detail (at the time of writing).3 The results may change if a different DAC technology was considered, e.g., that of Climeworks. To gain insight into how a different process may influence the overall findings, we ran a sensitivity analysis on the investment cost of DAC. From Fig. 9b, we can see that if we used DAC costs similar to those in the APS report (1600 M GBP2017, which corresponds to a 117% cost increase),50 the LCOE may increase by 4–20%. The LCOE for Case 3 increases from 0.32–0.52 GBP2017/kW h to 0.34–0.54 GBP2017/kW h, while the LCOE for Case 2 rises from 0.40–0.58 GBP2017/kW h to 0.46–0.66 GBP2017/kW h, which suggests Case 2 is a much less economically attractive P2P option (compared to Case 3). Naturally, an increase in the cost of DAC will favour the majority of scenarios in which CO2 is recycled with PCC (Cases 3, 5, 7). Case 9 has no advantage as the quantity of CO2 recycled is not significant.
Considerations for methanation plant
One of the key assumptions for the proposed P2P processes was that the quality of SNG produced from the methanation plant was good enough to replace natural gas. As aforementioned, the suitability of replacing natural gas with SNG can be measured by the Wobbe Index.2 In a non-equilibrium system, the final conversion of CO2 to SNG will depend on the reactor dimensions and choice of catalyst. The Ni catalysts used in CO2 methanation are generally close to 100% selectivity108–110 but a low CH4 yield or lack of hydrocarbons in the SNG mix will result in a lower calorific value, and by extension, a lower Wobbe Index. Götz et al.8 illustrated that 98% conversion of CO2 would give >90% CH4, also the presence of inert gases or hyperstoichiometic H2/CO2 ratios make it impossible to obtain high CH4 yields. Moreover, the reduction of CO2 to CH4 is an eight-electron reaction, and thus, has a very high kinetic barrier.111 Buchholz et al.2 carried out more detailed reactor simulations and suggested that at least two reactors in series would be required to obtain a SNG mixture with an adequate Wobbe index. Consequently, there is significant research activity around the development of more efficient and cheaper catalysts. However, Fig. 9c shows that the investment cost of methanation has very little impact on the final LCOE of the power-to-methane system, especially compared to the cost of acquiring the carbon (i.e., DAC, CCS). A 100% increase/decrease in the investment cost for DAC can lead to a 4–20% change in the LCOE for Cases 2–9 (Fig. 9b), whereas the same change in the investment costs for methanation and storage only shifts the LCOE by 1%. These findings suggests that reducing the cost of DAC technologies, rather than catalyst improvement, should be the key priority for P2G research and development.
Impact of H2 storage and combustion costs
Having identified that the cost data of pure-H2 power plants was limited and that the cost of H2 storage is the main hindrance for P2H, we ran a sensitivity analysis on their investment costs. We found that the cost of H2 storage had the greatest influence on the LCOE (Fig. 9d). However, the cost of H2 combustion in HTCC (Fig. 9f) had a smaller, albeit non-negligible impact, significantly more than the cost of electrolysis. If the H2 cavern costs were to reduce down to the same price as CH4 caverns (92% reduction), then the LCOE for Case 1 would drop to 0.29–0.40 GBP2017/kW h, while a decrease in H2 turbine costs to match that of CCGTs (∼37% reduction in cost) will result in a LCOE of 0.35–0.69 GBP2017/kW h. Combining these cost reductions (i.e., of both H2 storage and HTCC) will give a LCOE of 0.28–0.39 GBP2017/kW h. Given that the technology required is similar to that for methane, significant cost reductions in H2 storage and H2 electricity generation through learning as more technology is deployed is potentially achievable.
Use of O2 from electrolysis for electrification
One potential cost saving lies with the utilisation of the oxygen stream leaving the electrolyser for the combustion of storage gas (CH4 or H2) during the electrification step. In our calculations, the O2 was assumed to be used for this purpose. Advantages of this approach include: (i) increase to flue gas CO2 content (reducing burden on PCC); (ii) decrease in flue gas volume (less N2), reducing capital cost of downstream equipment (e.g., blowers, columns), and (iii) decrease in emissions of NOX and SOX, reducing capital and operating costs of pollution control.112,113 To determine the extent to which O2-firing influences LCOE, we ran a sensitivity analysis on the air requirements of the turbine and reformer furnace. Fig. 9i shows that using air rather than excess O2 from electrolysis only results in a 1–2% increase in LCOE. However, in our cost estimations for the reformers, we did not reduce the literature-derived investment costs to account for the eliminated need of an ASU. Instead, we demonstrate its effect by conducting a sensitivity analysis on the cost of the auto-reforming plant (Fig. 9h, ATR/ATR-CCS). The results show that a cost reduction of ∼30% (the approximate contribution of an ASU114) for the reformer plant will only result in a 1% change in LCOE, and would thus, have a negligible effect on the results.
Conclusions
We have proposed several novel technology configurations for carbon-neutral, grid-scale energy storage. Net-zero carbon emissions is achieved by: (i) using DAC to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, offsetting CO2 emissions from other process units, and/or (ii) replacing carbon-based fuel (e.g., CH4) with H2 to meet process energy requirements. Since these scenarios are composed of relatively well-understood sub-components, we would contend that these technologies are deployable today, and are consistent with a deep decarbonisation of our energy system. Carbon-neutral energy storage will be an essential component in energy systems to both decarbonise and maintain grid flexibility.
From the nine options, it was found that the simplest pathway, Case 1 (P2H), was not necessarily the most economic pathway. Our findings suggest that Case 1 is disadvantaged by the high costs of H2 storage. Instead, converting H2 to CH4/SNG for storage is currently more economical, with an investment cost of 7–29 Bn GBP2017 (median estimate of 13 Bn GBP2017) for storing 33.59 TW h of electrical energy and a corresponding LCOE of 0.32–0.52 GBP2017/kW h. If, however, the cost of H2 storage was to come down along with the cost of H2 combustion to match that of natural gas processes, then the LCOE will likely reduce to 0.28–0.39 GBP2017/kW h. Although these costs are still higher than battery energy storage and PHES, the storage of CH4/SNG/H2 offers much greater storage capacities and longer discharge times.
For our analysis, we were only interested in a carbon-neutral energy storage infrastructure so only considered air as our sustainable CO2 source. Since DAC technologies can be expensive owing to their high energy requirements,3 it was logical to examine whether off-setting some of the DAC requirements by capturing and recycling the CO2 from the combustion gases could improve the overall economics. However, we found that, despite the uncertainty associated with DAC costs, recycling CO2 in this way only resulted in marginal cost savings at best. The addition of a PCC imposes an energy penalty on the combustion plant that must be offset by increasing the size of the electrolyser to produce more H2. This increase in electricity requirement essentially negates any electricity savings owed to downsizing the DAC plant. Consequently, Case 2, which is less complex, may be the best of the nine options. It is almost identical in cost to Case 3 but does not have as much complexity. In any case, the P2M scenarios (Cases 2, 3, 6–9) are currently more attractive than P2H (Cases 1, 4, 5). Not only do they benefit from the current natural gas infrastructure, but they also require less storage volume and by extension less caverns. In fact, the cost of H2 storage is so prohibiting that it may even be more economical to convert SNG back to H2 for electrification (Cases 6–9) compared to just producing, storing and using H2.
Although each sub-component of the P2P chain already exists at the demonstration/commercial scale, our sensitivity analysis suggests that the economic viability of grid-scale energy storage is still significantly hindered by CO2 capture costs (i.e., DAC and CCGT-CCS) and H2 storage costs. Reducing the costs associated with these two technologies should be the focus of future research. Introducing a net-zero GHG emissions target or lowering the capital costs of electrolysis will help drive the development of these P2P process chain, whereas improving the methanation process may have little impact. The next steps will be to techno-economically examine: the integration of DAC into other power-to-X processes such as liquid energy carriers (e.g., formic acid production19), using fuel cells for electricity generation, and incorporating power-to-X technologies into energy system models such as the Electricity Systems Optimisation (ESO) framework10–12,44,115 to determine their value to the future energy mix.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Comparison of the discharge time (hours), storage capacity (kW h–TW h) and energy density (kW h Nm−3) of key energy storage technologies. Adapted figure from Schaaf et al.1 CAES = compressed air energy storage, PHES = pumped hydro energy storage, P2G = power-to-gas.	 

 	Fig. 2  Net zero carbon power-to-power (P2P) scenarios (Case 1–9) for grid-scale energy storage, which only use water and air as the non-energy feedstocks. Renewable power is used to remove CO2 from air (i.e., direct air capture, DAC) while also producing hydrogen. In some cases, H2 is combined with CO2, and converted into CH4 using SMR or ATR. The H2/SNG is stored as chemical energy, before being converted to electrical energy (either HTCC or CCGT). For some cases, CO2 is recovered from flue gas or the SMR/ATR process with post-combustion capture (PCC) and recycled.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 3  Scaled investments costs for each of the main processes using the sixth-tenths rule based on literature data. All technologies (excluding DAC) are scaled to a 1 TW hLHV capacity, assuming 8760 hours of operation a year. DAC is scaled to 1 MtCO2 capture. The red box plot shows the median (middle) with 25th and 75th quartile range. See Table S1† for references.
