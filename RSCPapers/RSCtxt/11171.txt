    , Accepted 12th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractAn optical simulation is adopted to examine the effects of the pore channels with different sizes and architectures on the ability of light absorption in photocatalysts. The simulation results are utilized to guide the synthesis of a novel porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) material in bead form, using millimeter-scale porous SiO2 beads as a template. The obtained g-C3N4 beads possess a unique porous architecture with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels at 30–90 nm in size, which is identical to the simulation result. Compared with pristine g-C3N4, the prepared material exhibits significantly enhanced visible light-induced catalytic performances for H2 evolution (8 times), photoreduction of nitrobenzene (3 times) and degradations of rhodamine B (4 times), methyl orange (2 times) and phenol (3 times). The unique pores and skeleton structures not only promote light penetration inside the material and light absorption at the edge of pore channels, but also improve mass transfer and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, this optical simulation approach could be adopted to guide the synthesis of other porous photocatalysts, and to verify their light absorption and infiltration properties in photocatalysis.
Introduction
With the growth of industrialization and population, the requirements for new energy sources and the environmental contaminations caused by organic pollutants are becoming overwhelming problems.1 Photocatalysis, being a “green” technology using solar power, has been widely applied in the fields of wastewater purification, oxidative decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), organic synthesis, H2 and O2 generation and photoelectrocatalysis.2–9 To make better use of solar energy, photocatalysts with response under visible light (45% of the sunlight wavelength) irradiation have attracted more and more attention.10–14 Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a kind of polymeric semiconductor with the advantages of facile synthesis, chemical stability and visible light responsiveness,15 is introduced as a metal-free photocatalyst that fulfils the basic requirements for photodegradation of organic pollutants and photocatalytic H2 and O2 generation.16–27 However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine g-C3N4 (PCN) is limited by intrinsic drawbacks originating from its relatively low surface area, narrow absorption range, low utilization ratio of visible light, fast recombination of photogenerated active charges and poor mass transport.28 Porous g-C3N4 with a higher specific surface area, in contrast, can overcome these shortcomings, and is particularly favorable for enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.29,30 Typically, hard- and soft-templating methods have been adopted to successfully prepare porous g-C3N4 with various morphologies and pore architectures.31,32 For instance, by using SBA-15 as a hard template, ordered mesoporous g-C3N4 has been successfully prepared;28 hierarchical mesoporous CN spheres with a high N content (17.8 wt%) were obtained by using spherical mesostructured cellular silica foams;33 12 nm silica particles were adopted to synthesize anti-opal g-C3N4;29 a nano-hard templating approach through a simple self-condensation of 3-AT inside the confined mesopores of KIT-6 silica without any oxidizing agent was employed to synthesize highly ordered N-rich mesoporous carbon nitrides.34 All of these porous g-C3N4 materials prepared using a hard template possessed high BET surface areas and thus improved catalytic performance. Soft templates such as gas bubbles, ionic liquids, block copolymers, and non-ionic surfactants were also adopted in the preparation of porous g-C3N4.35–40 However, the employment of general hard templates would lead to a low efficiency of pore utilization, and the impregnation amount of precursors (melamine, dicyandiamide and so on) into the meso or microporous templates would be difficult to reach a high degree.31 The porous g-C3N4 synthesized by soft templates would possess a high carbon content,41,42 which would cause a “shielding effect” and thus reduces light absorption and masks the active sites of the catalyst.43 Due to limitations in the preparation strategies, however, most of the studies focused on synthesizing mesoporous g-C3N4 materials with a tunable pore size <10 nm, which are sometimes hard to synthesize, and there have been fewer studies on preparing porous g-C3N4 with macropores and/or large-sized mesopores, especially with 3D interconnected and continuous pore channels. Compared with the large defect cavities that are normally not connected to construct a 3D pore channel, continuous channels with open “doors” to the surface are expected to be favourable for mass transfer and light absorption. Especially, the macropores and larger mesopores in such materials can clearly improve the catalytic performances via enhancing the mass transfer and light absorption, as observed on TiO2 materials containing macropores.44–46 Therefore, it is of significant interest to develop novel porous g-C3N4 materials with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels.
Generally, a photocatalytic reaction in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst consists of three steps. (1) The light is absorbed, and the energy is converted and stored in the active particles in the catalyst. (2) The active particles, i.e. photogenerated electrons and holes, are transported onto the surface of the catalyst. (3) The active particles come into contact and then react with the adsorbed reactants.47,48 Until now, the development of strategies to prepare various new porous photocatalysts and insights into their photocatalysis mechanism have been mostly based on the above-mentioned procedures, particularly focusing on the latter two steps. However, there has been little consideration of the effect of pore size and pore architecture on the light absorption ability. For a better understanding of the mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis and further guiding the fabrication of novel porous photocatalysts, it is necessary to explore the effects of pore size and pore architecture in porous solid materials on their light transfer and absorption ability. Recently, the energy absorption characteristics inside composite beads of TiO2/C were analysed using Mie analysis and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the results help one to understand how the photocatalytic performances and absorbed energy are increased by nanoparticles in the skeleton.49
In this work, this optical simulation strategy was introduced to guide the synthesis of a novel porous g-C3N4 material with a unique pore architecture. The effect of pore size and pore channel on the energy absorption ability was revealed via the FDTD method, and the obtained results were further applied to the synthesis of porous g-C3N4 beads with large mesopores and/or macropores and 3D interconnected and continuous pore channels (labelled as MCNs). To ensure the construction of the unique pore architecture, a hard-template directing approach was utilized here. The obtained beads proved to possess higher activity than pristine g-C3N4 in H2 generation as well as dye and phenol degradation under visible light. The increase was reasonably ascribed to the enhanced light absorption, higher specific surface area, improved mass transport, and slower recombination of photogenerated active particles. All these advantages stem from the 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels and thin skeletons.

Preparation of porous millimeter-scale SiO2 beads
Porous millimeter-scale SiO2 in bead form was synthesized by a modified method on the basis of the literature.50,51 In a typical run shown in Scheme 1a, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 2 mL with 40% mass fraction) was added to distilled water (8 mL) at 40 °C, after clarification, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 5 mL, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) was injected into the solution. Then, Amberlite IRA-900 resin beads (1.9 g, chloride form, Alfa Aesar, Scheme 1b, Fig. S1a†) were added to the solution as soon as clarification ends. After mildly stirring for 20 h at 40 °C, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated for 1 day at 60 °C. Then, the beads were separated, washed, dried at 60 °C, and calcined at 550 °C. Finally, the white beads (Scheme 1c, Fig. S1b†) were obtained by calcining the yellow beads in a muffle furnance for 360 min at 550 °C with a heating rate of 1.5 °C min−1.

Preparation of meso/macroporous g-C3N4 photocatalysts
Meso/macroporous g-C3N4 (MCN) in bead form was synthesized by heating dicyandiamide (DCDA) under N2 flow following Scheme 1a, Process 1. In a typical run, porous SiO2 beads (1.0 g) were added into DCDA (4 g, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) aqueous solution (20 mL). The mixture was stirred for 1 day at 25 °C, after being separated and dried at 60 °C, the white beads were sintered at a certain temperature X (X refers to 530 °C, 550 °C, 560 °C, 570 °C, 580 °C and 600 °C) accurately under N2 flow for 120 min with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. The SiO2 part in composite beads was eliminated by washing with 15% NH4HF2 aqueous solution, yielding MCN-X (X refers to 530 °C, 550 °C, 560 °C, 570 °C, 580 °C and 600 °C) beads (Scheme 1d, Fig. S1c†). Pristine g-C3N4 (denoted as PCN) was synthesized by the following method: 4 g of DCDA was heated in a tube furnace under a gentle N2 flow at a certain temperature Y (Y refers to 550 °C, 560 °C, 570 °C, 580 °C) for 120 min with a heating rate of 15 °C min−1.
The reverse impregnation experiment
The reverse impregnation was carried out as follows (Scheme 1a, Process 2): intact MCN beads were mixed with TPAOH aqueous solution and TEOS. After being stirred at 40 °C for 20 h, the mixture was transferred to an autoclave and heated for 1 day at 60 °C. Then, the beads were separated, washed, dried at 60 °C, and calcined at 550 °C. Finally, white intact beads were obtained (Scheme 1e, Fig. S1d†). The procedure is quite the same for the preparation of porous millimeter-scale SiO2 beads (vide supra) by using intact MCN beads instead of Amberlite IRA-900 resin beads.
Characterization
The N2 adsorption–desorption measurement was conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system at −196 °C. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model was adopted to calculate the pore-size distribution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Hitachi S-4800 and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images on a Topcon 002B. Optical microscope (OM) images were recorded on the Caikang X7L-2400. A Perkin Elmer 100 spectrometer was utilized to obtain the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with a PHI 5700 ESCA system equipped with an Al Kα radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The contents and molar ratios of C, H, N, and O elements were measured by using a Elemental Analyzer VARIO Micro Cube. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted to evaluate the thermal stability of MCN-560 on a NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter instrument, which was tested over a temperature range from room temperature to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 under an O2 atmosphere. A Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation was used to measure X-ray Diffraction (XRD). A Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 spectrophotometer was used to record the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Electrochemical performances were measured on a CHI electrochemical station (Model 660D) in the dark using a three-electrode system, and intermittent transient visible light irradiation was employed to generate photocurrent, an Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl) was adopted as the reference electrode and a Pt plate as the counter electrode, the active area of the working electrode (rotating disk electrode, RDE) is confined to 0.19625 cm2. The working electrode was prepared through dropping the ink that was fabricated by ultrasonically dispersing an appropriate amount of active materials in a 5 wt% Nafion alcoholic solution for at least 1 h on a glassy carbon disk of the RDE. The active material was regulated at 0.2 mg cm−2. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution without an additive (pH = 6.8). A 300 W Xe lamp was employed as the light source with a UV-cut off filter (λ > 400 nm). An AC voltage magnitude of 5 mV was adopted to record Mott–Schottky plots, the potential ranges from −1.8 to 0 V and the frequency is 100 Hz. The photocurrent response was measured under visible light at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Meanwhile, an AC voltage magnitude with a frequency range of 10−1 to 105 Hz was employed to carry out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A PerkinElmer LS-55 was utilized to record the photoluminescence (PL) under liquid nitrogen with 375 nm as the excitation wavelength.52 An Edinburgh FLS920 Fluorescence spectrometer was used to measure time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration during the catalysis was analysed on an Analytik Jena AG Multi N/C 2100 TOC analyzer.
Photocatalytic reactions
The activity of photocatalysts was estimated via H2 generation and RhB and MO solution degradations under visible light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation. The photocatalytic H2 evolution was performed in a closed glass system with carrying gas channels. The photocatalyst (0.1 g) was dispersed in triethanolamine (TEOA, as a sacrificial agent) aqueous solution (300 mL, 10 vol%), Pt (3 wt%) was employed as a co-catalyst generated from H2PtCl6·6H2O. Different dosages of catalysts were further employed to evaluate the catalysts. After sonication for 5 min, the suspension system was evacuated to remove O2 and inflated with N2. A 300 W Xe lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm) was chosen as the light source. The H2 yield was examined and calculated on a TCD in an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph (GC). A series of band-pass filters (λ = 380, 420, 450, 500, 550 nm) were used to obtain monochromatic light, and the lens incident light intensity is ca. 33 mW cm−2. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was calculated using the formula, (1)
The incident light intensity was detected using a LabMax TOP coherent power meter with a PM10 probe. For the degradation of organic dyes, typically, the photocatalyst (50 mg) was dispersed in RhB or MO solution (50 mL, 10 mg L−1) under stirring at room temperature. Different dosages of catalysts and different concentrations of dyes were further adopted to evaluate the catalysts. As for the phenol degradation and nitrobenzene (NB) reduction, 100 mg catalyst was added to the phenol aqueous solution (50 mL, 10 mg L−1) or NB in methanol solution (50 mL, 1 g L−1). The light source was the same as that for H2 generation and the reactor was a cylindrical flask with a circulating cooling water cell (thickness 5.0 cm) to remove IR beams thus to eliminate the impact of temperature. Considering the adsorption, the dispersion was kept in the dark for 1 h to reach adsorption and desorption equilibrium adequately between photocatalysts and dyes before irradiation. 1 mL of solution was collected at a constant interval (10 min for RhB, 20 min for MO and 30 min for phenol and NB solution respectively) during irradiation. The content of RhB, MO and phenol was analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer, and GC-MS was employed for the detection of the intermediate products of phenol degradation. In the case of NB reduction, the content of NB and products was analyzed using an Agilent 7890 GC. The pH of the investigated RhB or MO was around 6.9 which would not disturb the light absorption and not promote the self-degradation of dyes.53 The efficiency (%) of degradation was calculated by using the following formula, (2)C0 was the original concentration and Ctest was the remaining concentration of irradiation at each time interval. The conversion of nitrobenzene, yield and selectivity of aniline were calculated in accordance with the following equations, (3) (4) (5)where C0 is the concentration of NB in the original solution; CNB is the concentration of NB in the solution after irradiation for 4 h; Caniline is the concentration of aniline in the solution after irradiation for 4 h.
Results and discussion
Optical simulation of porous g-C3N4
Generally, the photocatalytic activity is determined by the efficiency of light absorption, the generation and recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and the contact frequency of active particles and reactants.13 To guide the synthesis and understand the effect of pore architecture on light absorption, the FDTD method was employed to conduct a series of optical simulations. The parameters were set according to the concept that pore channels with different sizes may possess different abilities in light absorption. In common mesoporous g-C3N4, the diameter of the pore channel is about 2–10 nm.31 Therefore, we designed the diameter of the pore channels in porous g-C3N4 beads with large mesopores and macropores and 3D continuous pore channel (MCN) materials ranging from 0 to 120 nm, and the average thickness of the pore walls was set to 20 nm. Next, the optical constants (refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) of g-C3N4 need to be determined. Although there are no definite reports on the optical constants of g-C3N4, those of α-CN can be employed as a substitute.54 We can ensure that the relative refractive index of the substrate in pore channels (vacuum or air) to the C3N4 matrix is always smaller than 1, so it is just a case of the relative refractive index being smaller than 1. In this paper, the FDTD simulations were all performed by using FDTD Solutions, a commercial software developed by Lumerical Solutions.
The relationship between the distribution of the electrical field and the diameter of the pore channel was studied. The calculation model used in this part is shown in Fig. 1a. The wavelength of incident light was set as 410 nm, which is typical in the visible light region. For the pore wall thickness s = 20 nm and the pore diameter d = 5–120 nm, the optical characteristics of porous g-C3N4 were analysed. In FDTD calculation, the depth of all pores was set as 400 nm. More detailed parameters are shown in Table S1.† The electrical field distribution along the z direction is shown in Fig. 1b. Clearly, the electrical field intensity is the highest at the entrance of the pore channel and decreases gradually along the light transport direction (z direction in Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Calculation model of MCN materials. (b) Distribution of the electrical field along the z axis. The arrows show the direction of light propagation. Panels marked (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V) and (VI) correspond to the pore sizes of d = 5, 10, 50, 80, 100 and 120 nm, respectively. All units are in nm. 
To better understand the different decay rates along the z direction in these cases, the distribution of the electrical field in the x–y plane at the entrance of the pore channel and 50, 90, and 170 nm away from the entrance along the z direction are shown in Fig. 2a, S2a, S2b, and 2b, respectively. The electrical field intensity in g-C3N4 with a smaller pore channel (or without pores) decreases faster along the pore depth than that with a larger pore channel, even when the thickness of the pore wall is the same. This indicates that the continuous meso/macropore channels greatly facilitate light penetration into the solid materials and that the larger pore channels have deeper optical penetration. When the diameter of the pore channel is small (d = 5 and 10 nm), the distribution of electrical field intensity inside the pore channel is homogeneous. However, when d becomes larger (50, 80, 100 and 120 nm), the electrical field at the edge of the pore channel is obviously stronger than at any other region. It is concluded that g-C3N4 with a large pore size and continuous channels can absorb more energy than that with a smaller one, leading to the generation of more active particles. Therefore, it is of great interest to synthesize porous g-C3N4 with continuous pore channels and an appropriate pore size.

Synthesis and morphology analysis of MCN materials
Based on the simulation results of light absorption efficiency, a novel approach was proposed to synthesize g-C3N4 with large mesopores and macropores and 3D interconnected and continuous channels (MCN, see Scheme 1a and the Experimental section). In this work, anion-exchanged resin beads (Scheme 1b and S1a†) with moderately high porosity were used as a hard-template to construct the unique pore architecture. First, the negatively charged silicate species formed in alkaline medium exchanged with anions in the porous resin. After calcination, porous SiO2 beads (Scheme 1c and Fig. S1b†) with large mesopores and macropores were obtained. Such porous SiO2 beads were subsequently applied as the template to construct the MCN materials (Scheme 1d and Fig. S1c†): DCDA molecules diffused into the pores of SiO2 beads, and a composite of g-C3N4/SiO2 was formed after thermal treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere. At this stage, the composite consisted of two 3D interconnected networks: a g-C3N4 part and an inorganic SiO2 part. After removal of the SiO2 part by washing with NH4HF2 aqueous solution, the final product MCN with simultaneously created large mesopores and macropores was obtained. It is worth noting here that the large mesopores and macropores in the resultant g-C3N4 should be 3D, interconnected and continuous because they are replicated from a SiO2 matrix network. Clearly, the replication strategy is key for the synthesis of such g-C3N4 with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels.
The porous SiO2 beads possess a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (Table S2†) and an obvious type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loops (Fig. S3a†). Meanwhile, the pore size distribution (PSD) shows pores at ∼20 nm in the silica beads (Fig. S3b†). All MCN samples consist of macroscopic pale yellow beads (Fig. S1c†), and their N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are type IV with H3 hysteresis loops at relative pressures of higher than 0.9 (Fig. 3a and S4a†), pointing to the presence of large meso/macropore channels connected by smaller windows.55 The pore size distribution (Fig. 3b) of the MCN calcined at 560 °C (MCN-560) mainly ranges from ca. 30–90 nm and was centered at ca. 54 nm. As expected, MCN-560 possesses a much larger BET specific surface area (58 m2 g−1) than that of PCN calcined at 560 °C (PCN-560, 8 m2 g−1). At various calcination temperatures, the BET surface area of MCN materials all remained as high as around 50 m2 g−1 (Table S2†) with the pore size (Fig. S4b†) at about ca. 50 nm. Therefore, the thermal condensation temperature may not significantly affect the BET specific surface area and the pore size, when using porous SiO2 beads as templates.
 Fig. 3  (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and (b) the corresponding pore size distribution curves of MCN-560 and PCN-560 respectively. 
Besides, observations from optical microscopy and SEM indicate that the MCN-560 beads retained the same bead size (about 0.5 mm, Fig. 4a and b) as that of the resin beads (Fig. S5a†) and silica beads (Fig. S5c and S5d†). A large number of large sponge-like mesopores (>20 nm) and macropores are present in the interior of MCN-560 (SEM in Fig. 4c, TEM in Fig. 4d and e, red arrows). In contrast, PCN-560 contains an irregular monolithic bulk (SEM in Fig. 4f, TEM in Fig. 4g and h) composed of large and smooth layered sheets without any pores or channels. It is worth noting that the size of the skeleton in MCN-560 is similar to the pore size of the silica beads, which is strong evidence for the limited growth of g-C3N4 in the porous structures of silica beads. Furthermore, the porous structures provide enough contact areas to accelerate the interfacial charge transfer, and the thin skeletons shorten the distance and time for internal charge transfer, which could help to improve the photocatalytic activity.

To confirm whether the meso/macropore channels in MCN-560 are 3D interconnected and continuous or not, a reverse impregnation experiment was carried out. If the meso/macropore channels are not continuous, then only silica nanoparticles could be achieved. However, by using MCN-560 as the template (Scheme 1a, Process 2), only intact SiO2 beads (Scheme 1e) were obtained. As presented in Fig. S5f and S5g,† the size of the reverse SiO2 beads is similar to that of the SiO2 bead template (Fig. S5c and S5d†) prepared from the resin (Fig. S5a†), and all samples contain open “doors” on the surface (Fig. S5b, S5e, and S5h†) and channels inside (Fig. S6†). This clearly confirms that the meso/macropore channels are 3D interconnected and continuous.
Given the 3D interconnected and continuous pore system opening onto the surface and thin skeletons, MCN-560 may have effectively enhanced light absorption, light penetration depending on the diffraction,45,56 and mass transfer (especially for bulky molecules). This kind of MCN material with a 20 nm pore wall and about 50 nm pore channels agrees with the structural constructions in the simulation very well.
Characteristics of MCN materials
After the treatment with NH4HF2 aqueous solution, SiO2 was eliminated completely as proven by the disappearance of the FT-IR peak at 1100 cm−1 assigned to the Si–O–Si stretching vibration band in MCN-560 (Fig. 5a). The peaks ranging from 3000 to 3300 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of N–H bonds and a minimal portion of O–H bonds,57 whose intensities are comparable with those of PCN-560 may imply a higher content of –NH2 or –C–NH in the porous matrix.58 It has been reported that –CN–, –NH2, or –C–NH groups enhance the wettability,59,60 and thus MCN-560 has the potential for improved mass transfer and adsorption of reactants on the solid surface in aqueous solutions. Other peaks located in the range of 1200–1650 and at 804 cm−1 are associated with C–N aromatic heterocycles and the triazine unit, respectively.61 The other MCN materials display similar characteristic peaks as those of MCN-560 (Fig. S7†).

XPS and elemental analysis were further performed to determine the skeleton structure. The total spectrum (Fig. S8a†) and Si 2p (Fig. S8b†) spectrum together with the total content of C, N, O, and H in MCN-560 (Table S3†) confirm the absence of residual SiO2. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. S8c†) is deconvoluted into two peaks of 284.9 and 288.0 eV and assigned to sp2 C–C bonds and sp2 N–CN bonds,62,63 respectively; and the latter constructs the main skeleton of g-C3N4. The N 1s spectrum (Fig. S8d†) shows three peaks centered at 398.9 (pyridinic-N), 400.5 (pyrrolic-N), and 404.4 eV (pyridinic-N-oxide)64,65 corresponding to N sp2-bonded to C, N atoms trigonally bonded to two sp2 C and one sp3 C or to all sp2 C in the C–N network, and the oxidized nitride (N+O−) respectively. The presence of the oxidized nitride, although at a relatively low content, plays an important role in conductivity,66 which might help to inhibit the recombination of the active particles created during the photocatalysis. Between 550 and 580 °C, the C/N and N/H molar ratios in MCN materials stay almost constant (ca. 0.66 and 3, respectively). As observed in some previous reports,61,67,68 the MCN materials possess the chemical formula C2N3H and are composed of the repetitive unit displayed in Fig. 5b. Furthermore, the special ratios indicate the presence of a quantity of terminal H atoms in C–N–H and C–NH2 species.69 All of this strongly indicates that the utilization of porous silica beads affects the polymerization of the g-C3N4 matrix, by partially confining the growth via large-mesopore channels in the silica beads. The C/N ratio in MCN-530 is lower due to the low degree of polymerization, and the ratio increases slightly in MCN-600 owing to the decomposition of g-C3N4. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis in Fig. 5c displays a sharp weight decrease at around 540 °C caused by the decomposition of MCN-560. At around 710 °C and higher, the weight is close to 0% and points to the absence of residual silica, and a slight shift to higher temperature illustrates the better thermal stability of MCN-560.70,71
Compared with SiO2 and the as-synthesized SiO2/MCN-560 composite, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak at around 22° disappears in MCN-560 (Fig. 5d), indicating that the SiO2 parts have been eliminated. Both PCN-560 and MCN-560 have two distinct diffraction peaks at around 13.1° and 27.3°, corresponding to the (100) plane of g-C3N4 (due to the in-plane structural packing motif) and (002) plane (associated with the interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic system, JCPDS 87-1526), respectively.72 The (002) peak of MCN-560 slightly shifts from 27.3° to 27.7° compared with PCN-560, indicating that the interplanar crystal spacing in MCN-560 is smaller (d(MCN-560) = 0.322 nm vs. d(PCN-560) = 0.326 nm), which is due to the nano-confinement effect.61,71,73 In other words, the slight shift is reasonably attributed to the confined growth of the g-C3N4 matrix in the mesoporous channels in porous SiO2 beads. Such a phenomenon can also be observed in other MCN materials prepared at different temperatures (Fig. S9a and S9b†), which indicates that the utilization of a porous silica bead template does have a significant effect on the matrix growth of g-C3N4. Besides, the peak at 13.1° is somewhat broadened in MCN-560, which is also a sign of the confined growth of the g-C3N4 matrix (since reflexes at a lower angle correspond to a larger d value and are therefore more affected by geometric confinement).
Optical characteristics of MCN materials
Compared with PCN-560, the sharp and typical semiconductor absorption band thresholds of MCN-560 are shifted from the intrinsic value of ca. 435 to ca. 460 nm, according to the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Fig. 6a). Such a red shift illustrates that the light response range and light absorption ability of MCN-560 are strengthened, and implies that the quantum confinement effect existing in many small sized mesoporous g-C3N4 materials contributes non-significantly.73 This result leads to the decrease of the band gap, as shown in Fig. 6b, the band gap of MCN-560 (2.64 eV) is larger than that of PCN-560 (2.78 eV). Similar to MCN-560, other MCN materials prepared at different temperatures also displayed a red shift in their absorption band thresholds and possess larger band gaps compared with the corresponding PCN materials (Fig. S10 and Table S4†). The shrunken band gap of MCN materials, together with their large surface area and pore volume, is beneficial to the light absorption, mass transfer and active particle transport. Therefore, these materials could have a remarkably higher catalytic performance in theory.

The photocatalytic ability of a semiconductor originates in the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which transfer from the interior to the surface of the catalyst and participate in redox reactions with reactants on the surface. Obviously, the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductors is significantly influenced by the generation and transport of light-induced active charge particles.13 The current density rises to a stable high value when the light is turned on, and drops to a low value once the light is shut down (Fig. 6c), a phenomenon that can be repeated continuously. Notably, it also shows that the photocurrent generated from MCN-560 is much higher than that from PCN-560, indicating that the presence of meso/macropore channels and a thin skeleton effectively promotes the charge transfer to the interface, and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated particles. Fig. 6d shows the Nyquist plots of MCN-560 and PCN-560 in electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) at high frequencies. The diameter in the plots corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) caused by faradaic reactions and electric double layer capacitance (Cdl) at the electrode/electrolyte interface.74 An obviously reduced EIS semicircle was obtained for MCN-560 compared with PCN-560. This and the oxidized nitride detected by XPS point to the faster interfacial charge transfer, in good agreement with the photocurrent results.
MCN-560 shows much lower intensity in photoluminescence (PL) spectra compared with PCN-560 (Fig. 6e). Therefore, the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes could be effectively inhibited. The other MCN materials display similar PL characteristics (Fig. S11†). The inhibited recombination of active charge carries could be further confirmed by the measurement of their lifetime (Fig. 6f). As observed in Table S5,† the medium lifetime is 5.71 ns for PCN-560 and 5.95 ns for MCN-560, with the corresponding percentage of charge carriers being 64.87% and 71.68%, respectively. Clearly, more charge carriers with longer lifetime are present in MCN-560 than in PCN-560, helping to reduce the probability of recombination of photoelectrons and holes and to increase the accessibility of the charge carriers to reactants.75,76 The enhanced separation efficiency and the lengthened lifetime can be attributed to the 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels and the slender skeletons in MCN-560, which accelerate the movement of the active charge carriers to the surface to take part in the reactions.
In this work, the factors that may be beneficial for the photocatalytic performance include: (1) the mass transfer improved by the interconnected and continuous pore channels and enlarged BET surface area; (2) the light absorption ability enhanced by the meso/macropore channels; (3) the broadened visible light response ranges proved by UV-Vis DRS; (4) exciton dissociation and accelerated transfer to the surface of catalysts evidenced by the photocurrent. All of the factors above together with the survival time of active charge carriers improve the catalytic performances of MCN-560.77
Catalytic performance under visible light
The photocatalytic performances for H2 evolution were examined under visible light to evaluate the catalytic activity. The yield of H2 evolution with MCN-560 as the photocatalyst is far higher than that with PCN-560 at each irradiation interval (Fig. 7a). The H2 evolution rate over PCN-560 is 7 μmol h−1, which is significantly increased (by 8 times) to 53 μmol h−1 over MCN-560 (Fig. 7b). Meanwhile, no obvious decrease in the H2 evolution rate was observed with MCN-560 after four continuous cycle reactions, implying its good stability during the H2 evolution (Fig. 8a). The amount of generated H2 can reach 325 μmol after a single run of 7 h and about 1300 μmol after 4 runs (28 h). The turnover frequency (TOF) is 6.1 and 6.0 h−1, respectively. Based on the relatively weaker incident light intensity, the AQY for MCN-560 under a 420 nm ± 15 nm wavelength can reach ca. 2.9% and 0.4% at 550 nm ± 15 nm (Fig. 8b). As shown in Fig. S12,† a control experiment was carried out to ensure the dosage of photocatalyst. Clearly, the results represented by the unit of μmol h−1 exhibit that the ratio of the increment from 80 to 100 mg is lower than 70 to 80 mg and elucidate together that 80 mg of MCN-560 might be the most suitable dosage, and the H2 evolution rate is not always increasing with the increment in the amount of photocatalysts added.

 Fig. 8  (a) Cyclic test of photocatalytic H2 evolution on MCN-560 and (b) AQY for MCN-560 under different monochromatic lights irradiation. 
Rhodamine B degradation was also investigated to further test the photocatalytic activities. A dark reaction was carried out for 60 min to reach adsorption–desorption equilibrium (Fig. S13†). The RhB degradation on PCN-560 was 23.2% after 60 min, whereas it was 97.4% on MCN-560 (Fig. 9a). To evaluate the role of the 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels in degradation, the as-synthesized SiO2/MCN-560 composite was adopted as a reference, on which only 8.6% of the dye was degraded (equivalent to the used weight of g-C3N4 in MCN-560) after 60 min (Fig. 9a). This clearly reveals that the meso/macropore channels in MCN-560 play a vital role in the improved photodegradation performance. The excellent degradation results of MCN-560 can be further proven by the fact that almost the same degradation efficiency (97.1%) was observed when the dosage of catalyst was reduced by 40% (30 versus 50 mg, Fig. S14a†). Similarly, MCN-560 can easily degrade RhB solutions at much higher concentrations (Fig. S14b,† 140 min for 50 mg L−1 and 180 min for 100 mg L−1). Similar trends of photodegradation with MCN-560 and PCN-560 were also observed for the degradation of methyl orange (MO, Fig. 9b), confirming that the positive effect of the meso/macropore channels in MCN-560 is not limited to a certain dye. Notably, a sudden drop appears in both RhB and MO degradation. A possible reason for such a “sudden drop” could be ascribed to the “sudden enhanced adsorption” of the dye molecules on MCN materials via the meso/macropores. However, by considering that dark adsorption of dyes for 1 h was carried out prior to the light irradiation, the “sudden enhanced adsorption” of the dye molecules should be ignored in such cases. Another possible reason for the “sudden drop” might be related with the rising temperature inside the pore channels due to light absorption and the light energy accumulation inside the depth of pore channels, which could result in accelerating the degradation rate at that point.

To further elucidate the superior catalytic performance of MCN-560 under visible light rather than self-sensitization of dyes, phenol and nitrobenzene (NB) were employed to be degraded and reduced respectively. As shown in Fig. S15,† after being fully adsorbed in the dark, phenol was gradually degraded into intermediate products (hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, catechol etc.) and into CO2 and H2O finally under visible light irradiation. At 180 min, 36.3% of phenol was degraded over PCN-560; in contrast, 87.2% of phenol was degraded over MCN-560. As for NB photoreduction (Fig. S16†), the conversion of NB to aniline is 32% over PCN-560 while it is 98% over MCN-560, and the dark adsorption, yield and selectivity also increased by a large margin. The degradation and reduction results of both the above contaminants with no self-sensitization illustrate that the introduction of 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels into bulk g-C3N4 would improve the photocatalytic performance.
On the basis of its structural and optical characteristics, the excellent photocatalytic performance of MCN-560 compared with PCN-560 should be partially attributed to the fast mass transfer stemming from 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels, larger pore volumes, higher BET specific surface areas, and the highly efficient separation of active charge carriers originating from the meso/macropores and thin skeletons. The improved light absorption ability of MCN-560 is also an important factor. The simulation predicts that pores with large size would be an optimal structure to absorb more light energy, and from the characterization results of N2 sorption, SEM, and TEM, it can be seen that the pore sizes of MCN-560 are mainly between 30 and 90 nm, which well fits the desired pore size distribution (5–120 nm) utilized for the simulation of energy absorption characteristics (vide supra); therefore, MCN-560 can be reasonably expected to absorb more light energy. One can conclude that three factors, i.e. light absorption ability, mass transfer, and separation efficiency of active charge carriers synergistically promote the photocatalytic performance over MCN-560.
To evaluate the recyclability of the catalysts, MCN-560 was separated from the reaction suspension and washed with ethanol at room temperature. Fig. S17† shows no obvious decrease in catalytic efficiency after four successive catalytic cycles, suggesting that MCN-560 possesses high recyclability and structural stability in visible light-induced degradation. The highly stable structure and pore architecture can also be proven by XRD, FT-IR, UV-Vis, PL, and N2 adsorption–desorption analyses of recycled MCN-560 (Fig. S18†).
The total organic carbon (TOC) is an important and necessary parameter to determine the completeness of the dye and phenol mineralization into H2O and CO2. In the case of MCN-560, 90%, 82% and 84% of the TOC of RhB, MO and phenol were removed after 70 min, 160 min and 180 min of photocatalysis respectively (Fig. S19†), revealing that MCN-560 is a good mineralization catalyst instead of simply decolorizing the dye.
Among other MCN materials prepared at different sintering temperatures (Fig. S20†), MCN-550, MCN-570, and MCN-580 possess similar H2 evolution and degradation capacities as MCN-560, confirming the importance of meso/macropore channels for catalysis. However, MCN-530 and MCN-600 exhibited relatively lower yields of H2 and degradation efficiencies, caused by the low polymerization degree in MCN-530 and more pronounced decomposition in MCN-600 leading to the “shielding effect” disturbing the light absorption and covering the active sites, respectively. An n–π* transition, which originated from the distortion of the carbon nitride layers,77–79 would appear at a higher sintering temperature while not at 550 °C;80 however, the “confinement growth effect” prevails over the “delamination effect”, leading to an ordered g-C3N4 layer, and considering the characterization results above, the sintering temperature may not remarkably affect the polymerization of g-C3N4 with a porous silica template, as long as the temperature is within a certain range.
Some control experiments were conducted to illustrate the universality of this novel method to synthesize g-C3N4 beads with meso/macropore channels, by changing the precursor from dicyandiamide to other precursors such as urea, thiourea, ammonium thiocyanide, and guanidine hydrochloride. Bead samples with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels were successfully obtained, as proven by the characterization results of XRD, FTIR, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S21 and Table S6†). In the photocatalytic reactions, the other g-C3N4 samples clearly showed similar performances for H2 evolution and degradation of RhB (Fig. S22 and S23†), indicating that this novel strategy is indeed general for preparing porous g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic ability.
Possible reaction mechanisms
The first-order kinetic equation was adopted to depict the RhB, MO and phenol degradation: (6)where C0 is the original dye concentration and Ctest is that after irradiation time t, and k is the rate constant (min−1). Different from the first-order kinetics over PCN-560, MCN-560 displayed pseudo-first-order kinetics for RhB, MO and phenol degradation (Fig. S24 and S15c†), which corresponds to the “sudden drop” in their degradation curves.
More experiments were conducted to understand the mechanism of the degradation. Normally, in a photocatalytic reaction, superoxide (O2˙ or HOO˙) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are the active species,23,81 and they are generated according to the following equations MCN-560 + hν → MCN-560 (hvb + ecb)(7)
The photogenerated holes are used for oxidation82 hvb + OH− → ˙OH(8)and the photogenerated electrons for reduction83 O2 + e → O2˙(9) O2˙ + e + 2H+ → H2O2(10) H2O2 + e → ˙OH + OH−(11)
The electron–hole mechanism can explain the action of MCN-560 well. As shown in Fig. S25,† the self-degradation of RhB and MO has been examined under visible light to show that there is no degradation in the absence of photocatalysts. More control experiments were carried out to further investigate the mechanism of RhB and MO degradation in solution over MCN-560, by using tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) as an effective ˙OH scavenger84 and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a hole scavenger.17 TBA did not significantly change the degradation rate of RhB, while an obvious rate decrease occurred in the presence of TEOA (Fig. S26a†). Clearly, photogenerated holes are the key for RhB degradation over MCN-560 materials; that is, RhB is degraded over MCN-560 through a photooxidation route: RhB + h → oxidation products(12)
Unlike the RhB degradation process, MO degradation over MCN-560 is more complicated. When TBA was added to the MO photodegradation system, the catalytic efficiency exhibited a sharp decrease, and only 25% of MO was degraded after 3 h. A less prominent decrease in the reaction rate was observed after adding TEOA into the system (Fig. S26b†). Accordingly, we predict that the reaction mechanism consists of a major and a minor process occurring at the same time. The major process is the electron reduction, and the minor process is hole oxidation, as explained by the following equations.
Major process: O2 + e + MO → reduction products(13)
Minor process: MO + h → oxidation products(14)
The statement above can easily explain the improved catalytic efficiency in MCN-560 (Fig. 10). When meso/macropore channels are introduced into g-C3N4, visible light can penetrate the material more easily and with more photons absorbed at the edge of meso/macropore channels. Thus, more active particles are generated. These meso/macropore channels also permit dye molecules to easily diffuse into the interior of the photocatalysts, improving the accessibility between the dye and the photogenerated electrons and holes on the inner surface of the pore channels. Furthermore, the thin skeleton in the MCN materials helps to limit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes by shortening the distance and time for internal charge transfer. Hence, H2 is generated by the electron reduction, and RhB is completely mineralized by hole oxidation. In contrast, MO is degraded mainly by the electron reduction mechanism.

Conclusions
An optical simulation was adopted for the first time to evaluate the effects of pore architecture on the ability of photocatalysts to absorb energy, and the results were further employed to guide the synthesis of novel g-C3N4 beads with 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels. A unique porous matrix was constructed during the polymerization by replicating the porous SiO2 structure. Moreover, the use of a template could somewhat reduce the influence of temperature in condensation. Compared with PCN materials, the prepared MCN materials exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities in H2 evolution, dye and phenol degradation and NB reduction under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance should be attributed to the 3D interconnected and continuous meso/macropore channels and thin skeletons. On one hand, these structural characteristics promote light absorption at the edge of the pore channels and light penetration in the channels. On the other hand, they accelerate the mass transfer and improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. In summary, such an optical simulation approach could be adopted to guide the synthesis and verify the light absorption and penetration ability of multi-porous catalysts.
