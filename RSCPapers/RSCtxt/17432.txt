    , Accepted 11th April 2022First published on 12th April 2022AbstractStrain is ubiquitous in perovskite based photovoltaic cells, but can be hardly well released in most perovskite films, which usually has an adverse effect on devices' performance and lifetime. Here, a molecular buffer interface that enabled strain-free hybrid perovskite films is demonstrated via a sequential deposition method. A quaternary ammonium iodide buffer layer can effectively release the in-plane tensile stress of PbI2via its flexibility and weak interaction, which enlarges the PbI2 layer spacing and favors the subsequent perovskite phase conversion. Drift-diffusion simulations further suggest optimized interfacial band edges after the removal of residual PbI2, which enhances the charge extraction of solar cell devices. The optimized perovskite solar cell device attains an efficiency of 22.14% with a high fill factor of 0.846 and good long-term stability.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite has attracted enormous attention due to its tuned bandgap,1 excellent light absorption ability,2 low fabrication cost,3 and all-solution manufacturing process.4 Perovskite has been successfully applied in photovoltaics,5,6 light-emitting diodes,7,8 photodetectors,9 and radiation detection.10 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increased from 3.8% to 25.7% within just a few years with the development of deposition techniques and materials science.11–14 Nowadays, highly crystalline and pinhole-free perovskite films can be readily coated by a dozen of methods, such as spin coating,15 doctor blading,16 slot die coating,17etc. However, all of these methods need a post-annealing procedure, in which process the mismatched thermal expansion coefficients of perovskite and substrates usually cause unfavorable structural deformation and residual strain at the interface. Such residual strain accelerates the degradation of perovskite films and impairs the operating stability of devices,18 which is one of the main factors hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
The thermal expansion coefficients of perovskite are about one order of magnitude higher than those of most commonly used rigid substrates and charge transport materials.19 Zhao et al.20 have shown that the cooling down of perovskites on these substrates results in an in-plane tensile strain of about 0.47% by one-step spin-coating, two-step spin-coating, and doctor blade-coating methods. Such tensile strain contributes to ion migration and defect formation that is identified to be determinantal to the structural stability and performance of perovskite devices. The existence of strain may also bring about cracks in films, accelerating the degradation of perovskite films. Wu et al.21 introduced polystyrene as a buffer layer in PSCs. Due to its low glass transition temperature, the phase transition of the buffer layer can effectively release the residual stress. Materials such as perovskite single crystals,22 2D materials,23,24 and flexible interfaced materials25–27 were demonstrated to tailor global strain. However, the current study of strain engineering is mostly focused on one-step deposited perovskite films, while the sequential deposition method may be easy to achieve strain-free devices because of the good tunability of solid-to-solid structural conversion.28 The understanding of strain evolution in this process is still lacking, which is crucial for further improvement. In addition, the solid–solid reaction between PbI2 and methylammonium iodide stacking layers often leaves remnant PbI2 crystals at the bottom interface, leading to unfavorable band alignment29 and irreversible degradation.30
In this work, we demonstrated that strain-free hybrid perovskite films can be realized by using a molecular buffer interface via the sequential deposition method. We revealed that the quaternary ammonium iodide buffer layer can reduce the residual strain between the substrate and PbI2 film, and then totally release their strain after phase conversion. Strain release also improves the layer spacing of PbI2 films and accelerates the conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. And the buffer layer can passivate the interface defect and improve devices' stability. The champion strain-free MAPbI3 device exhibits a PCE of 22.14% with a high fill factor of 0.846.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/NiOx/tetrapentylammonium iodide (TPAI)/MAPbI3/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag in this work. Three kinds of quaternary ammonium iodides, including tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), TPAI, and tetrahexylammonium iodide (THAI) were used for the surface functionalization. The cationic ammonium cations are likely to anchor at the NiOx surface, while the alkyl groups are located outside and the terminal I ion may coordinate with the Pb atom31 (Fig. 1b). The existence of the TPAI molecules at the surface was confirmed by contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 1c and S1†). The I 3d5/2 peak at 618.2 eV and N 1s peak at 402.2 eV were observed in the TPAI sample, which are absent in the untreated (pristine) film. By washing the treated surface with dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solution, the hydrophobic surface was retained, implying that the TPAI molecules are strongly adsorbed on the NiOx surface (Fig. S2†). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of NiOx films (Fig. S3†) show similar surface topography after the surface treatment.

(g) XRD patterns of PbI2 and perovskite films grown on pristine and TPAI treated NiOx films. 
MAPbI3 films were then prepared by a two-step sequential deposition method, which involves the spin-coating of PbI2 and MAI layers in sequence.32 By recording the high-resolution XPS N 1s spectra (Fig. 1d), we found that the TPAI molecules were absent in the PbI2 films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1g reveal that (001) lattice spacing of pristine and TPAI PbI2 layers is 6.92 Å and 6.94 Å, respectively. As the layered PbI2 crystals are typically stacked on the substrates, the pristine sample should be tensile strained along the in-plane direction, and exhibited a reduced lattice spacing. The smaller interlayer spacing of PbI2 is thought to impede the insertion of MAI species, and therefore give rise to remanent PbI2.33 In contrast, the strain-releasing PbI2 layers prepared at the TPAI interface can be mostly converted into the perovskite phase. SEM images in Fig. 1e and f further reveal PbI2 flakes with a thickness of about 30–80 nm at the bottom interface for the pristine perovskite sample, whereas the TPAI perovskite sample has a large grain size and a well-contacted underlying interface.
To explore the evolution of interfacial strain during sequential deposition, depth-dependent grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were employed to characterize the residual stress distribution of both PbI2 and perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2a, b, d and e, we selected the grazing incidence angles of 0.2°, 0.5°, 1.0° and 1.5° to collect the local lattice spacing at different depths. The d-spacing values of PbI2 (001) plane and MAPbI3 (110) plane were calculated according to Bragg's Law, and the results are shown in Fig. 2c and f. Upon the increase of incidence angles, the PbI2 (001) and MAPbI3 (110) diffraction peaks of pristine films shift to lower angles obviously, suggestive of the presence of in-plane tensile strain.20 In our work, the expansion coefficient of MAPbI3 is 6.1 × 10−5 K−1, which is 4.2 times larger than that of NiOx (1.38 × 10−5 K−1).19,34 When the perovskite film cools down after thermal annealing, the contraction of MAPbI3 in contact with NiOx is limited, resulting in depth-dependent deformation. In comparison, the flexible nature of quaternary ammonium molecules enables much reduced deformation of PbI2 layers on the TPAI buffer film (Fig. 2g). After the phase conversion, strain-free perovskite films can be obtained without notable shifts in the depth-dependent GIXRD patterns (Fig. 2d). TPAI molecules have four long alkyl chains with good structural flexibility that can release the strain of PbI2 layers by changing their configurations.35 Additionally, the relatively weak coordination between TPAI and PbI2 layers may cause local slip at the interface.31 These changes enable larger lattice spacing of PbI2 layers and favor the solid-to-solid transformation of perovskite phases.

To explore the influence of the PbI2 layers, numerical simulations were performed with a p–i–n device structure of NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM. The specific parameters used in the numerical simulation are shown in Table S1.† The energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 3a and b. The existence of PbI2 leads to the unnatural bending of the energy band around the interface between MAPbI3 and NiOx at open-circuit voltage (VOC), and thus the quasi-Fermi levels of holes cannot be balanced, which induces the loss of VOC.36 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the pristine model demonstrate that the current density begins to decrease rapidly at about 0.8 V, and finally, there is a VOC loss of about 0.1 V (Fig. 3c, Table S2†).

The carrier distribution of two models is given in Fig. 3d at a voltage of 1.0 V. PbI2 acts as an obstacle of hole extraction at the perovskite–NiOx interface, and thus increases the minority carrier density on both sides of the absorber layer. Therefore, a plethora of carriers cannot be effectively transmitted, extracted or collected, resulting in the increase of SRH recombination in the bulk absorber layer37 (Fig. 3e). Fig. 3f shows that PbI2 causes the increasing trend of recombination currents moving in the direction of lower voltage. The interface recombination current of the PbI2 model is significantly higher than that of the reference model at a voltage of 1.0 V (∼17×). Since the recombination rate largely depends on the minority carrier density at the interface, the interface recombination is enhanced, leading to a poor VOC and FF.37
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to investigate the energy levels of NiOx films with and without the TPAI buffer layer (Fig. S4†). The energy level diagram of PSCs is shown in Fig. 4a, where the energy levels of FTO, MAPbI3, PCBM, BCP, and Ag were acknowledged values from previous reports.5 The valence band maximum (VBM) of samples was calculated according to the following formula: VBM = 21.21 eV − (Ecut-off − Eon-set), where Ecut-off and Eon-set represent the cut-off and on-set energy boundaries. The VBM of pristine and TPAI NiOx films is 5.24 eV and 5.35 eV, respectively, in which the VBM of the NiOx film with the TPAI buffer layer is closer to that of MAPbI3 (5.40 eV). The better interfacial band alignment is beneficial for carrier extraction and device performance.38

Charge carrier kinetics at the NiOx/MAPbI3 interface was investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) spectroscopy. A 365 nm excitation pulse laser was used to irradiate the samples on the glass side. Both perovskite films have similar light absorbance at the excitation wavelength (Fig. S5†). As shown in Fig. 4b, the decay curves of both samples are composed of slow and fast components. The slow component of the decay process is attributed to carrier recombination, while the fast component of the decay process originated from charge extraction by selective contacts.39 The fast decay lifetime of pristine and TPAI samples were estimated to be 11.3 ns and 4.4 ns, respectively, indicating efficient hole extraction by using the TPAI buffer layer. Due to the enhanced hole extraction, the TPC decay (Fig. 4c) of the TPAI sample (0.48 μs) was faster than that of the pristine one (0.63 μs). As shown in Fig. 4d, the carrier lifetime of the TPAI device was determined to be 4.88 μs, which is much longer than that of the pristine device (1.54 μs). The combined carrier transits and PL lifetimes of the TPAI device should be derived from the elimination of residual PbI2 and optimized band alignment at the interface.
To investigate the effect of the TPAI modification layer on photovoltaic performance, a series of solar cells were fabricated. Under standard AM 1.5 G illumination, the J–V curves of devices were recorded. The devices based on pristine and TPAI exhibited an average PCE of 17.89% and 21.84%, respectively (Table S3†). We found that JSC is not strongly affected at the values between 22 and 23 mA cm−2 for all samples. VOC is significantly influenced by changing the kind of buffer layer. The device based on the TPAI buffer layer attains the highest VOC of 1.146 V; in contrast, the highest VOC of the pristine is only 1.116 V. Thus, the champion device of pristine attained a PCE of 18.92% with a FF of 0.744, and the champion device of TPAI delivered a PCE of 22.14% with a higher FF of 0.846 (Fig. 5a). Next, to confirm the reliability of devices' performance, we tested the steady-state photocurrent output of PSCs at the maximum power point (MPP) upon 300 s illumination (Fig. 5b). For pristine and TPAI devices, under bias voltages of 0.90 V and 0.97 V, steady-state photocurrent outputs are 20.82 mA cm−2 and 22.61 mA cm−2, and the corresponding steady-state efficiencies are 18.74% and 21.93%, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 5c, which have no obvious difference between devices of pristine and TPAI. The integrated JSC of pristine and TPAI devices is 22.53 and 22.72 mA cm−2, corresponding well to the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. The photovoltaic parameters based on 20 devices are summarized in Fig. 5d and S7,† which indicates the positive effects and good reproducibility of TPAI devices. And the pristine and TPAI devices exhibited negligible hysteresis (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the branched alkyl chain may affect device performance.40 We found a similar positive impact of quaternary ammonium iodide molecules with different chain lengths on device photovoltaics (Fig. S8, Table S3†).

(c) EQE spectra and integrated JSC curves of PSCs with pristine and TPAI treated NiOx films. (d) PCE distribution of PSCs with pristine and different alkyl ammonium iodide treated NiOx films. 
In order to access the carrier recombination of PSCs, VOC was measured under different light intensities (Fig. 6a). The ideal factor for pristine and TPAI samples is estimated to be 1.820 and 1.297, respectively, which indicate suppressed nonradiative recombination in TPAI devices.41 Then, we carried out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure the charge behavior within PSCs (Fig. 6b). The low-frequency zone of Nyquist plots is originated from the recombination resistance (Rrec) of interfaces between layers.42 The device of TPAI has a bigger Rrec value than the pristine, implying that TPAI molecules can increase the Rrec, and then enhance charge transport at the interface. Fig. S9† shows the Mott–Schottky plots of devices through capacitance−voltage (C–V) measurements, in which the TPAI device has a higher built-in potential (Vbi) of 0.88 V than the corresponding value of 0.8 V for the pristine device, where increasing Vbi was critical for VOC enhancement.43

Space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements were performed on hole-only devices with the structure of FTO/NiOx/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. As shown in Fig. S10,† all J–V curves show three regions, involving ohmic, trap-filled limited, and child regions. For the devices of TPAI and pristine, the VTFL was 0.11 V and 0.29 V, and the hole trap densities were evaluated to be 0.56 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.46 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. Thermal admittance spectroscopy was also performed to analyze the hole trap densities of PSCs.44Fig. 6c shows the trap density of states (tDOS) of TPAI and pristine devices. The TPAI device exhibits a smaller tDOS in the whole trap depth region, particularly at the density of shallower trap states (0.3–0.4 eV). Previous studies have proved that the defects at buried interface and grain boundaries are mainly shallower trap states.45,46 Then, we investigated the effect of quaternary ammonium iodide molecules on the long-term stability of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6d, after 1200 hours, the pristine and TPAI devices retained 84.6% and 90.2% of the initial efficiency, respectively. Therefore, we demonstrated that the TPAI buffer layer can help reduce the residual strain, remove the residual PbI2, passivate the interface and improve devices' stability.
Conclusions
In summary, a molecular buffer layer for strain release and residual PbI2 removal is demonstrated for sequentially deposited hybrid perovskite films. A quaternary ammonium iodide buffer interlayer can release the tensile in-plane strain of the PbI2 layer, and subsequently enable full conversion to strain-free perovskite films. Drift-diffusion simulations revealed the importance of the residual PbI2 removal in improving the charge collection of the as-fabricated devices. Such a buffer layer also exhibits an excellent passivation effect of the interfacial trapping states. Consequently, the optimized perovskite solar cell device reaches an efficiency of 22.14% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 0.846. Our stability tests have also shown the enhanced environmental endurance of solar cells with the TPAI buffer layer. This work provides a new avenue towards the fabrication of strain-free hybrid perovskite opto-electrical devices.
