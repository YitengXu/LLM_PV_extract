    , Accepted 9th March 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractThe in situ optical properties and electrocatalytic performance of representative catalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) have been considered together to evaluate system-level effects that accompany the integration of OER catalysts into a solar-fuel device driven by a tandem-junction light absorber with a photoanode top cell, i.e., a design that requires incident light to be transmitted through the OER catalyst before reaching a semiconducting light absorber. The relationship between the overpotential and optical transmission of the catalysts determined the attainable efficiencies for integrated solar-fuel devices as well as the optimal band gaps for the photoanode in such devices. The systems investigated generally showed: (1) the OER catalysts dissolved in acid, and were less stable in buffered near-neutral pH electrolytes than in strongly alkaline electrolytes; (2) higher overpotentials were required to drive the OER at a specified current density when the catalysts were operated in contact with near-neutral pH electrolytes than strong alkaline electrolytes; (3) for some of the OER catalysts, the electrocatalytic activity and in situ absorption spectra depended strongly on the preparation method; (4) increasing the loading of the electrocatalyst reduced the overpotential and the optical transmission; (5) for the catalysts studied, the optical transmission and overpotential were generally correlated, and the trend lines did not cross, indicating that based on these factors alone, the optimal approach is to use lower loadings of highly active catalysts, rather than to use a less active but more transparent catalysts; (6) for a solar-fuel device driven by semiconductors operating at the Shockley–Queisser limit and using a continuous film of a given OER catalyst in the path of incident light, the efficiency decrease due to the reduced optical transmittance that accompanies increased OER catalyst loading can be substantially greater than any efficiency increase that might be gained through the reduction in catalytic overpotential by increasing the catalyst loading; and (7) HER catalysts possessed the same performance trade-off when the light is incident through the HER catalysts as is observed for OER catalysts when the light is incident from the OER side.

Broader context
In integrated photoelectrochemical solar-fuel generators, either the fuel-forming catalyst or the oxygen-evolving catalyst is placed in the path of incident sunlight. The optical spectrum that reaches the underlying semiconducting light absorbers can thus be modified substantially by the presence of the required electrocatalyst. Electrocatalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction are typically electrochromic under operational conditions, and the electrochromic spectrum varies with catalyst loading, materials, and preparation methods. Understanding the combined electrocatalytic, optical, and chemical properties of electrocatalysts, the interplay between the optical absorption and catalytic overpotential of the material, and the compatibility of the electrocatalyst with an integrated solar-fuel generator system is therefore important for the design and optimization of integrated solar-fuel generators.

I. Introduction
Integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) or photovoltaic-biased solar-fuel generators, and solar-fuel systems composed of discrete photovoltaic (PV) devices connected electrically in series with electrolyzers (PV-E), share a need for light absorbers to separate charge, electrocatalysts to effect the desired fuel-forming half-reactions involved in water splitting or sustainable CO2 reduction, and a physical or chemical means to allow for the efficient separation and collection of the reaction products.1 Regardless of whether a solar-fuel generator is a photoelectrochemical cell or a PV-biased electrosynthetic cell,2 consolidation of the light-absorbing and electrosynthetic functions into a single integrated unit imposes constraints upon the chemical, optical and electrochemical properties of the materials relative to materials that are optimal for use in a discrete PV-E system.
In discrete PV-E systems, electrocatalysts with high activities (i.e., low overpotentials, η, at current densities of 0.2–2 A cm−2, depending on the electrolyzer type3) are required to minimize the dominant area-related balance-of-system costs that are characteristic of commercial electrolyzers. To minimize deleterious resistive losses as well as pH gradients during operation, and to facilitate robust separation and beneficial collection of the product gases in an inherently safe system, electrolyzers are operated either in strongly alkaline or acidic media, with solid polymer electrolytes preferred for operation in acidic environments due to the ability to hold back pressure differentials and thereby facilitate collection of H2(g) under pressure.3,4 In an electrolyzer, the electrocatalyst generally can be deposited onto a stable, conductive, inexpensive substrate that can be chosen to be chemically compatible with the intended operating environment. Hence, high catalyst stability and activity under extreme pH conditions are mandatory,5,6 while the optical transmission and interfacial reactivity upon deposition of the electrocatalysts onto substrates are relatively unimportant criteria for materials being considered for use in an electrolyzer.
Fully integrated PEC and PV-biased solar-fuel generators typically require catalysts to operate at lower current densities (∼10 mA cm−2) than PV-E systems, but add the requirement that the electrocatalysts be compatible with placement onto a tandem-junction light absorber. In the PEC and PV-biased cases, either the fuel-forming catalyst or the oxygen-evolving catalyst is placed in the path of incident sunlight, depending upon whether the photoanode or photocathode is the top junction of the tandem absorber.7 Therefore, in the case of integrated systems, the optical transmission of the electrocatalyst is important, as is the interfacial reactivity associated with the deposition of the electrocatalyst onto a semiconducting light absorber (with or without an intervening protective coating). Scheme 1 illustrates a PV-E design and three integrated PEC designs employing various strategies to minimize the absorption of light by the electrocatalyst. The entire assembly must be stable in, and chemically compatible with, the electrolytes and the electrode potentials associated with the redox half-reaction facilitated by the electrocatalyst: the oxidation of water to O2(g) (oxygen-evolution reaction, OER); the reduction of water to H2(g) (hydrogen-evolution reaction, HER); or the reduction of water and carbon dioxide to carbon-containing fuels (carbon dioxide reduction, CO2R).
 Scheme 1  (a) A discrete photovoltaic plus electrolyzer setup (PV-E), and integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar-fuel generators with (b) a continuous, transparent catalyst film covering the top light absorber, (c) an array of catalyst islands covering the top light absorber, and (d) a microwire design with catalysts deposited at the base of the microwires, out of the path of the light. Protective layers and antireflective layers are not shown. 
Recently, benchmarking protocols have been used to evaluate the activity and stability of several HER and OER electrocatalysts, but these protocols do not consider the optical properties of the catalysts.5,6 For integrated solar-fuel systems, the optical properties of the catalysts are critical to the performance of a device, and the activity and stability of an electrocatalyst film are not independent of the optical properties of the catalysts. Films of electrocatalysts for the OER – including metals such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ir; metal oxides; mixed metal oxides;8 and metal complexes deposited from buffered solutions9,10 – typically are optically absorbing and electrochromic, and thus can attenuate the power of, or alter the spectrum of, illumination incident on an underlying light absorber.11 Such materials exhibit differing levels of stability and catalytic activity for the OER, with the stability and activity dependent on the pH of the electrolyte.12 Herein, we consider both the electrocatalytic activities and in situ optical properties of several well-known OER electrocatalysts to evaluate system-level effects that accompany the integration of catalysts into solar-fuel systems that place the OER electrocatalysts in the path of incident illumination, i.e., a tandem-junction light absorber with a photoanode as the top junction. Specifically, we have evaluated in strongly alkaline, strongly acidic, and buffered aqueous media, the characteristics of NiOx and IrOx films produced by reactive sputtering, CoOx films produced by atomic-layer deposition or by anodic electrodeposition from solutions with and without phosphate ions, as well as NixFe1−x(OH)y films produced by cathodic electroprecipitation. For comparison purposes, we have also evaluated the optical properties and activities of two canonical electrocatalysts of the HER, Pt and NixMoy films produced by sputtering.
II. Experimental
Detailed experimental procedures are provided in the ESI.†
A. Catalyst deposition
Thin films of Pt and Ni–Mo were deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates using a DC magnetron sputtering system. The film thickness was controlled by varying the sputtering time. Samples of Pt films were prepared in thicknesses of 2 nm, 5 nm, and 60 nm; samples of Ni–Mo films were 2 nm, 10 nm, or 20 nm thick. Thin films of NiOx and IrOx were deposited onto FTO–glass substrates via reactive RF sputtering using a high-vacuum magnetron sputtering system. NiOx films were prepared with thicknesses of 7 nm, 35 nm, and 70 nm, as measured by profilometry, whereas films of IrOx were 10 nm, 60 nm, and >100 nm thick.
CoOx films, CoOx,ed, were deposited anodically at a current density of 76 μA cm−2 onto FTO-coated glass electrodes from an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, at neutral pH. The thickness of the films was varied by varying the total charge density passed during deposition, either 5 mC cm−2 or 120 mC cm−2.
Cobalt phosphate films, Co–Pi, were deposited anodically at a current density of 0.10 mA cm−2 onto FTO–glass electrodes from an aqueous solution containing potassium phosphate and cobalt nitrate, Co(NO3)2.13 The deposition was continued until 5–120 mC cm−2 had been passed, depending on the desired thickness for the film.
Ni(OH)2 films were electrodeposited cathodically onto FTO–glass electrodes from an aqueous solution containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O. Films of NixFe1−x(OH)y were deposited cathodically from an aqueous solution containing Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and FeSO4·7H2O, with Fe accounting for 25% of the metal content. Depositions were conducted for 2–10 s using a current density of −10 mA cm−2, resulting in film thicknesses of 7–40 nm.
CoOx films, CoOx,ALD, were deposited onto FTO–glass substrates via atomic-layer deposition (ALD) using bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt(II) and ozone. The number of ALD cycles (60–1000) was varied to produce film thicknesses of 2–50 nm.
B. Preparation of electrodes
Silver paste was used to attach a Cu wire to the front side of each of the FTO–glass substrates. The Cu wire was threaded through a glass tube, and the FTO–glass substrate was attached and sealed to the end of the glass tube using opaque gray epoxy (Hysol 9460). The exposed area of each electrode, as defined by the edge of the applied epoxy, was imaged using a high-resolution optical scanner and measured using ImageJ software. Exposed areas for the FTO-coated glass substrates were 0.3–0.4 cm2, unless specified otherwise.
C. Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), current interruption for resistance correction, and in situ electrochromism data were obtained using a Biologic MPG-2-44 potentiostat (Bio-Logic Science Instruments). CVs were recorded at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. Current interruption at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was used to determine the uncompensated resistance in the electrochemical cells. 85% corrections for uncompensated resistance were performed when measuring the kinetic overpotentials of the electrocatalysts, and were critical when large-area FTO-coated glass substrates were used in the optical transmittance measurements. Corrections for uncompensated resistance reduce errors in experimental measurements by reducing the effects of cell-specific voltage drops arising from electrode shapes, cell geometry, and solution conductance.14
For electrochemical measurements in 1.0 M KOH(aq), including photoelectrochemical measurements, spectral response behavior, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a Hg/HgO reference electrode was used, and a carbon cloth in a fritted glass tube was used as the counter electrode. The Hg/HgO reference electrode had a potential of 0.926 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE.
For electrochemical measurements in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) or 1.0 M K–Bi(aq), a saturated calomel electrode, SCE, was used as the reference electrode and a fritted Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode. For HER catalysts, the solutions were purged with high purity H2(g) for 30 min prior to measurements of electrocatalytic activity for the HER, and the H2(g) flow was maintained during such measurements. For measurements of electrocatalytic activity for the OER, solutions were pre-saturated using high purity O2(g), and the O2(g) flow was maintained during such measurements.
The cathodic charge density, Qc, in the pseudocapacitive region was measured using the same equipment as for other electrochemical measurements, and was directly related to the electrochemically accessible reaction sites and thus assumed to be proportional to the active surface areas of the catalysts.11
D. 
          In situ optical measurements

In situ measurements of the optical transmittance of OER-catalyst-coated FTO–glass substrates were performed using a custom Teflon cell (Fig. S1, ESI†). Samples were placed between two quartz windows in the cell, with the counter and reference electrodes out of the optical path. Light from a Xe arc lamp (Newport 67005 and 69911) was passed through a monochromator (Newport Oriel Instrument CS230) and was directed at normal incidence onto both the sample and a calibrated Si photodiode (Thorlab Fs-100ca). The responsivity of the photodiode was provided by the manufacturer, and the photodiode was isolated from the corrosive electrolyte by a quartz window. The electrochromism of the sample was determined by monitoring the transmittance at a fixed illumination wavelength (550 nm) as measured with a Si photodiode (Thorlab Fs-100cal), while scanning the applied potential in the range of 0.0–1.0 V versus Hg/HgO, or while holding the current density at 10 mA cm−2. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows an optical photograph of a typical epoxy-sealed electrode, illustrating that the opaque, filled epoxy has very little optical transmission over the visible spectrum. In addition, the exposed areas of the sealed electrodes (0.3–0.4 cm2) were greater than the illuminated area (0.09 cm2) and also were larger than the area of the Si photodiode detector (0.03 cm2) in the compression cell (Fig. S1b, ESI†). When collecting multiple spectra on the same electrode at different locations, the monochromated light beam was kept away from the sample edges to minimize any issues related to the scattering or absorption associated with the physical edge or epoxy-sealed edges or regions of the electrodes. A peristaltic pump was used to circulate the electrolyte at a high circulation rate over the sample surface, to minimize the accumulation of bubbles and thus to minimize the scattering of light by bubbles formed on the electrode surface. The transmittance was defined by the ratio between the transmission of catalyst-coated FTO substrates and the transmission of the bare FTO substrate.
HER catalysts are typically metallic and do not exhibit electrochromism under reductive conditions, so the optical transmittances of the HER catalysts were measured ex situ without applied cathodic bias.
The integrated total optical transmittance was calculated using eqn (1): (1)where T is the total integrated optical transmittance, h is Planck's constant (6.63 × 10−34 J s), c is the speed of light (2.998 × 108 m s−1), q is the unsigned elementary charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), T is the transmittance at each wavelength, P is the irradiance in W m−2 nm−1, and λ is the light wavelength in nm.
E. Calculations of optimal band-gap combinations and solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies
The solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies along with the optimal band-gap combinations for solar water-splitting cells driven by tandem light absorbers were evaluated using an established current–voltage model which assumes that the characteristics of the light absorbers can be determined using detailed-balance calculations that account for the Shockley–Queisser limit on the photovoltage of each absorber. Detailed descriptions of the equations and associated models have been provided previously.15,16
The optimal band gap of the top junction was calculated by minimizing eqn (2): (2)where T is the transmittance at each wavelength and is also a function of t, the catalyst thickness. Due to nonuniform film thicknesses, the faradaic charge passed was used to quantify the catalyst loading for the electrodeposited films (Fig. S2, ESI†). λ0 = 1240/Eg,top, Eg,top is the band gap of the top cell in eV, and Φext is the external quantum yield (unity throughout the whole spectra studied in this work). After being filtered by the catalysts, 100% absorption of incident light (ideal antireflection) and 100% Φext were assumed (ideal conversion of photons to electrons). Solar irradiance data at the global tilt were adopted from the NREL website.17 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the solar irradiance after passing through a water layer at various thicknesses. When the water layer thickness is >1 cm, a substantial loss is produced at wavelengths >900 nm. A water layer with a thickness of 1 cm was thus assumed in this calculation, to properly include the losses in the long wavelengths.18 Water was considered as the incident medium because the water layer thickness is greater than the wavelength of illumination. A total of 20 Ohm resistance loss in the membrane as well as the electrolyte was used in the calculations. As representative values, Pt HER catalysts were assumed to have a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec−1 and an exchange current density of 1 mA cm−2.19
To consider the non-radiative recombination losses in the tandem junction design, the voltage loss in each junction was described by the external radiative efficiency (ERE) in eqn (3). ERE values were based on the state-of-the-art performance of photovoltaic materials,20 assuming that the ERE in each junction is independent of the integration process: (3)where ERE is the external radiative efficiency, J0,non is the non-radiative recombination current density, and J0 is the radiative recombination current density.
The solar-to-hydrogen energy-conversion efficiency, ηSTH, was calculated using eqn (4): (4)where λ0,opt = 1240/Eg,top,opt, with Eg,top,opt the optimum band gap of the top junction in eV.

A. Effects of loading and catalyst-deposition methods on catalytic activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction

1. CoOx films in 1.0 M KOH(aq). 

Fig. 1a–c compares the effect of catalyst loading, as reflected by the catalytically active surface area or film thickness, on the current density versus potential (J–E) behavior of CoOx catalysts in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq), for each of the deposition methods used: electrodeposition (CoOx,ed), electrodeposition from a phosphate-containing solution (Co–Pi), and atomic-layer deposition (CoOx,ALD). For the CoOx,ed film, increasing the loading by passing more total charge density during electrodeposition (Qd) resulted in an increase in the active surface area as determined from the cathodic charge density (Qc) measured in the pseudocapacitive region (Fig. S4, ESI†), consistent with the observed increase in catalytic activity per geometric surface area with catalyst loading. A 20-fold increase in the active surface area reduced the overpotential required to produce a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10mAcm−2) by ∼67 mV. As the loading of CoOx,ed was increased, η10mAcm−2 decreased from 0.417 ± 0.005 V to 0.35 ± 0.003 V, with at least three electrodes measured at each loading level. The Tafel slope of 46 ± 4 mV dec−1 remained constant suggesting that the rate-limiting step did not change as the loading of CoOx,ed increased (Fig. S5, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Effect of catalyst loading on the geometric current density versus potential behavior of oxygen-evolution catalysts prepared using different synthetic techniques. (a) CoOx,ed (1.1, 4.8, 58.5, and 127.9 mC cm−2), (b) Co–Pi (10, 60, and 120 mC cm−2), (c) CoOx,ALD (3, 10, and 50 nm), (d) NixFe1−x(OH)y (−20, −50, and −100 mC cm−2), (e) NiOx,sp (7, 35, 75 nm), and (f) IrOx (3, 6, and 20 nm). (a–e) were measured in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) and (f) was measured in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). The figures-of-merit for the loadings are the measured film thicknesses (ALD and sputtered films) or catalytically active surface area (electrodeposited films) as reflected by the cathodic charge density measured in the pseudocapacitive region of the J–E scans. 
In contrast to the CoOx,ed films, the catalytic activity (current density per geometric area) of Co–Pi films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) was essentially unchanged by increases in catalyst loading. Films with the highest catalyst loading exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 0.383 ± 0.005 V (Fig. S6, ESI†). When operated in 1.0 M KOH(aq), Co–Pi films exhibited very similar electrocatalytic behavior to CoOx,ed films that had comparable active surface areas. The Co–Pi and CoOx,ed films also showed mutually similar redox behavior, and both exhibited distinctive redox peaks at ∼1.1 V versus RHE (Fig. S4, ESI†). The heights of the redox peaks decreased during 10 potential scans in 1.0 M KOH(aq) (Fig. S7, ESI†).
The catalytic activity of CoOx,ALD films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) was also essentially unchanged as the catalyst loading increased (Fig. S8, ESI†), although the J–E data shifted slightly to positive potentials with increased loading, presumably due to higher uncompensated resistance in the thicker films.21 ALD produced dense, compact films with low roughness22 and with active surface areas (Fig. S4c, ESI†) that were small relative to the higher porosity and roughness exhibited by the electrodeposited CoOx films. The distinctive redox peaks observed at ∼1.1 V versus RHE for CoOx,ed and Co–Pi films were not observed for CoOx,ALD films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq).


2. NiOx and NixFe1−x(OH)y films in 1.0 M KOH(aq). 
The NiOx films that were sputter-deposited using the specific conditions described herein did not show a substantial loading-dependent activity, with η10mAcm−2 = 0.334 ± 0.005 mV in 1.0 M KOH(aq) (Fig. S9, ESI†), consistent with previous studies suggesting a loading- or thickness-independent active surface area in conjunction with an electrochemically inert bulk film, and incorporation of Fe on the surface of the catalyst which may contribute to the activation of both Ni and Co-based catalysts in KOH(aq) (Fig. S10, ESI†).12,23–31
Films of NixFe1−x(OH)y prepared by cathodic electrodeposition showed a loading-dependent catalytic activity (Fig. S11a, ESI†) similar to that observed for CoOx,ed (Fig. S4, ESI†). At the highest loading (100 mC cm−2) studied in this work, cathodically electrodeposited NixFe1−x(OH)y films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq), exhibited a slight degradation (Fig. S12, ESI†) and stabilized with η10mAcm−2 = 0.286 ± 0.003 V (Fig. S13a, ESI†), comparable to published results.24 The potentials observed for the Ni3+/2+ redox peaks from the sputtered films were different from those observed for the electrodeposited NixFe1−x(OH)y and Ni(OH)2 films without addition of Fe in the deposition solution (Fig. S13, ESI†), presumably due to the difference in the phase and potentially different active reaction centers.25

B. Effects of pH on catalytic activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction

Fig. 2 shows the representative J–E behavior of FTO–glass substrates coated with high loadings of Ni and Co-based OER catalysts in contact with 1.0 M KOH (pH = 13.6), 1.0 M K–Bi (pH = 9.3), or 1.0 M H2SO4 (pH = 0). All of the OER catalysts studied in this work showed an increase in overpotential (by 140–226 mV) as the pH of the electrolyte decreased from 13.6 to 9.3.
 Fig. 2  Effects of pH on the OER activity of catalyst films at the highest loadings tested in (a) 1.0 M KOH(aq), (b) 1.0 M K–Bi(aq), and (c) 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). CoOx,ed (127.9 mC cm−2), Co–Pi (120 mC cm−2), CoOx,ALD (50 nm), NixFe1−x(OH)y (−100 mC cm−2), NiOx,sp (75 nm), and IrOx (20 nm). 
In the course of preparing the catalysts and measuring their activities, the catalytic activity of the CoOx,ed and NixFe1−x(OH)y samples decreased in contact with 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) when the potential was cycled in the range of 0.7 V to 1.91 V vs. RHE (Fig. S13, ESI†). Complete loss of catalytic activity was observed for CoOx,ALD samples in contact with 1.0 M K–Bi after 10 potential cycles in the same range. Ni-based OER catalysts operated in contact with an aqueous bicarbonate-buffered KOH solution (pH = 9.5) and cycled in the range of 0.7 V to 1.91 V vs. RHE were unstable at all loadings (Fig. S14, ESI†), showing complete loss of catalytic activity within 10 potential scans, but were more stable in the K–Bi solution. The value of η10mAcm−2 for NiOx,sp in the bicarbonate-buffered KOH solution was ∼0.2 V greater than η10mAcm−2 for NiOx,sp in contact with the borate-buffered KOH solution, suggesting a possible influence of borate ions on the binding energies of reactants, products, and/or intermediates of the OER.
In 1.0 M H2SO4(aq), all of the non-noble-metal-based OER catalysts rapidly lost their catalytic response for water oxidation, consistent with the facile dissolution of such metals under oxidizing conditions in strongly acidic electrolytes. IrOx prepared from reactive sputtering and operated in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 0.524 ± 0.015 V at the highest loading levels studied, and thus displayed lower electrocatalytic activity than reported in the literature for IrOx films that were synthesized as nanoparticles or as supported catalysts,32 which can yield η10mAcm−2 of ∼0.420 V in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). IrOx,sp films also showed a slight loss of activity upon scanning of the electrode potential, with η10mAcm−2 increasing from 1.75 to 1.81 V versus RHE over 10 cyclic voltammetric cycles over the potential range of 1.23 to 1.83 V vs. RHE. The electrocatalytic activity of IrOx films was only measured in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq).
C. Compatibility of deposition methods with semiconducting substrates
During electrodeposition of Co–Pi onto freshly HF-etched p+-Si substrates held at a fixed deposition potential, the current decreased from 0.45 mA cm−2 to near zero within 20 s (Fig. S15, ESI†). Likewise, when electrodeposition of Co–Pi was performed on Si substrates using a fixed current density, within 20 s the required applied potential exceeded 6 V. These results are consistent with rapid oxidation of p+-Si under the conditions required for electrodeposition. Similar behavior was observed for anodic electrodeposition of CoOx onto p+-Si substrates. The catalytic activity of electrodeposited Co–Pi and CoOx,ed could therefore not be evaluated on p+-Si substrates. All other deposition methods were compatible with Si substrates, in the strictly limited sense that the catalyst could be deposited onto the substrate without losing the electronic connection to the substrate.
D. Optical transmittance of oxygen-evolution catalysts under operational conditions

Fig. 3 shows the optical transmittance spectra for various loadings of OER catalyst films on FTO–glass substrates. Transmittance data were obtained for as-prepared films (dashed lines) as well as for films that were biased, after iR correction, to a potential sufficient to produce a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. An efficient tandem junction operating at the Shockley–Queisser limit could theoretically provide a current density of >20 mA cm−2, with an efficiency of >24%.15 A recent study using an InGaP2/GaAs tandem junction reported a photocurrent density of >8 mA cm−2.33 The actual current density will be within a factor of two of the 10 mA cm−2 value used as a representative value in this work, and at which electrocatalysts for solar-fuel generators have been benchmarked previously.5 In addition, most of the catalysts showed saturation of electrochromism in this current density range (Fig. S16, ESI†). Therefore, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was used in this work to characterize the optical transmittance of the electrocatalysts under working conditions.
 Fig. 3  Comparison of optical transmittance spectra of as-deposited films (dashed curves) and for films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) (a–e) or 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) (f) while passing a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER (solid curves). Spectra were averaged over scans taken at 3 different spots on the sample. (a) CoOx,ed, (b) Co–Pi, (c) CoOx,ALD, (d) NixFe1−x(OH)y, (e) NiOx,sp, and (f) IrOx. The blue, green and orange curves depict the transmission spectra of the electrocatalysts at high, medium and low loading, respectively. 
Compared to the other catalysts evaluated in this study, as-deposited CoOx,ed and Co–Pi films showed substantial absorption at wavelengths, λ, <600 nm, but remained transparent for λ > 800 nm. Two transition regions, one at λ ∼ 500 nm and the other at λ ∼ 800 nm, attributable to absorption by Co(II) and Co(III) respectively, were apparent in the transmittance spectra for Co-based OER catalysts.34 When operated at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 while in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq), substantial electrochromic darkening of the CoOx,ed film was observed for λ > 500 nm. The electrochromic darkening of the Co–Pi films was less pronounced relative to the darkening of the CoOx,ed films, and the relatively lower darkening can be attributed to the relatively smaller catalytically active surface areas of the Co–Pi films. CoOx,ALD films exhibited negligible electrochromism under working conditions in 1.0 M KOH(aq), in accordance with previous results.35
As-prepared NixFe1−x(OH)y films were optically transparent and exhibited an apparent optical transmittance, T > 100%, potentially caused by the matched refractive index which smoothed the transition from the refractive index of water to that of FTO-coated glass as a blank reference.36 Under operational conditions in 1.0 M KOH(aq), the as-deposited porous NixFe1−x(OH)y films with the lowest loading used in this study were highly transparent to visible light (transmittance, T ≥ 90%). Electrochromic coloration of NixFe1−x(OH)y primarily occurred in the visible region at wavelengths <800 nm.
Sputtered NiOx films were highly transparent, with T ≥ 90% for the low loading across the visible spectrum and T ∼ 80% for the medium and high loading levels investigated in this study, and exhibited weak electrochromism relative to electrodeposited films, likely related to the decreased electrocatalytically active surface areas of the sputtered films.37 The electrochromism of the sputtered NiOx film did not show a strong dependence on catalyst loading. The increased reflection could also account for part of the transmission loss (Fig. S17, ESI†).
IrOx films prepared using the specific reactive sputtering deposition conditions at the relatively high temperatures used herein showed negligible electrochromism under operational conditions in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq).38

Fig. 4 compares the optical transmittance of catalyst films operating at 10 mA cm−2 in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) with the transmittance of films operating at the same current density in contact with 1.0 M K–Bi(aq). For materials that are stable in near-neutral pH electrolytes, the optical transmittance and electrochromism were both dependent on the pH of the electrolyte. Higher transmittance, and thus less darkening, was observed for CoOx,ed, Co–Pi, and NixFe1−x(OH)y in 1.0 M K–Bi compared to the behavior in 1.0 M KOH(aq). These observations are consistent with the reduction in Qc for CoOx,ed, Co–Pi, NixFe1−x(OH)y and NiOx,sp, in 1.0 M KOH(aq) relative to 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) (Table 1). Sputtered NiOx,sp showed comparable transmittances at both pH values, consistent with similar Qc values (1.74 ± 0.05 mC cm−2) in 1.0 M KOH(aq) and 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) (Fig. 4d).

Spectra were averaged over scans taken at 3 different spots on the sample. (a) CoOx,ed, (b) Co–Pi, (c) NixFe1−x(OH)y, and (d) NiOx,sp. 
E. Hydrogen-evolution catalysts
Within the thickness and potential range studied in this work, Pt films prepared by sputtering showed no dependence of their HER catalytic activity on film thickness (Fig. S18, ESI†). In contrast, the HER activity of NixMoy depended substantially on the film thickness (Fig. S19, ESI†).

Fig. 5 shows the J–E behavior of Pt and NixMoy films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq), 1.0 M K–Bi(aq), or 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). The pH of the solution, as well as the buffer species present in the solution, substantially affected the catalytic activities and stabilities of the HER catalysts examined herein. For example, Pt films exhibited η−10mAcm−2 = −0.040 ± 0.002 V in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) and η−10mAcm−2 = −0.122 V in 1.0 M KOH(aq).
 Fig. 5  Effect of pH on the catalytic activity of Pt (a) and NixMoy (b) at the highest loading for the hydrogen-evolution reaction. 

Fig. 6 compares the optical transmittance of the metallic HER catalysts. The metallic catalysts did not show substantial cathodic electrochromism under operation, and attenuated the transmittance uniformly across the spectrum from 350–1100 nm.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of optical transmittance spectra (T) for as-deposited films (dashed curves) and for films in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) while passing 10 mA cm−2 of cathodic geometric current density for the HER (solid curves). (a) Pt films (2, 5 and 70 nm) and (b) NixMoy (2, 10, and 20 nm) films. The optical transmittance spectra overlapped with the one under operational conditions, indicating negligible cathodic electrochromism. 
F. Impact of trade-offs between optical transmission and electrocatalytic overpotential on design considerations for solar-fuel devices
The iso-efficiency plots presented in Fig. 7 and Tables 2 and 3 summarize the effects of catalyst loading on the attainable solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy-conversion efficiencies, ηSTH, calculated for solar-fuel devices driven by tandem light absorbers and configured with a photoanode top cell. Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†) summarize the results of similar calculations for solar-fuel devices configured with a photocathode top cell. Increasing the loading of NixFe1−x(OH)y to obtain reduced overpotential losses degraded ηSTH due to the increased optical transmittance losses that substantially lower the photocurrents produced by the top junction in the tandem cell. Specifically, for a fixed band-gap combination of 1.70/1.12 eV, ηSTH was reduced from 19.6% to 2.6% as the OER overpotential was reduced from 348 mV to 286 mV, by increasing the loading of the NixFe1−x(OH)y OER catalyst. Optimization of the band gap of the photoanode to compensate for the change in the properties of the NixFe1−x(OH)y film could be used to reduce the severity of the decrease in ηSTH with catalyst loading. Specifically, with an optimized top cell, ηSTH decreased from 22.4% (1.79/1.12 eV) to 6.2% (1.47/1.12 eV) as the overpotential from the NixFe1−x(OH)y OER catalyst decreased from 348 mV to 286 mV.

The assumptions in the calculation are specified explicitly in the Experimental section.

Efficiencies are calculated based on a tandem cell with a fixed band-gap combination of 1.70 eV/1.12 eV (the second set of entries), and based on tandem cells with the band gap for the photoanode optimized for the properties of the NixFe1−x(OH)y catalyst film (the second set of entries). NiMo was used as the HER catalyst, with an overpotential loss of 100 mV. The current-limiting junction is highlighted as either the bottom junction (bold) or the top junction (italics)

Due to the differences between the absorption spectra for different catalyst materials, different optimum band-gap combinations were required to produce optimized ηSTH values in each device. Films that did not show substantial electrochromic darkening under OER conditions, such as NiOx,sp or Co–Pi, did not exhibit a substantial change in optimum band-gap combination as the catalyst loading was changed.
As modeled, the maximum ηSTH obtainable for solar-fuel devices that contained continuous films of OER catalysts in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) and in the path of incident light, with a fixed band-gap combination of 1.7 eV/1.12 eV, showed only minor variation for the catalysts examined, and remained in the range of 16.6% (NiOx,sp) to 20.5% (CoOx,ALD). If the band gap of the top absorber can be tuned, these small variations in attainable ηSTH become negligible, remaining in the range of 18.1% (NiOx,sp) to 23.4% (CoOx,ALD). When using the highest loading of catalysts to protect an underlying semiconductor, the attainable ηSTH values were 16% (CoOx,ALD) and 16.6% (NiOx,sp).
When operated in 1.0 M KOH(aq) and at loadings yielding T > 95%, the reactivity of all the OER catalysts considered herein is sufficient to allow the development of an efficient (ηSTH ≥ 10%) solar-driven water-splitting cell, provided that a sufficiently efficient, stable, and inexpensive tandem absorber becomes available. Indeed, solar-driven water-splitting systems that utilize protected, epitaxially grown (i.e., expensive) Group III–V tandem absorbers with photoanode top cells and Ni OER catalysts have already produced ηSTH ≥ 10%.33
IV. Discussion
A. Trends in electrocatalytic activity and stability for the OER as a function of pH, loading, and deposition methods

1. Trends in electrocatalytic activity. 
In alkaline electrolytes as well as in near-neutral pH solution, η10mAcm−2 for the OER electrocatalysts increased in the order: NixFe1−x(OH)y < NiOx < CoOx (in various forms) (Table 1). For all OER catalysts and preparation methods, η10mAcm−2 increased by at least 150 mV when the pH of the electrolyte decreased from 13.6 to 9.3, yet the ordering of the catalysts by overpotential did not change. The increase in η10mAcm−2 with a decrease in pH is consistent with the expectation that oxidation of the negatively charged hydroxide ion is more facile than oxidation of the neutral H2O species. Hence, a substantial penalty in η10mAcm−2 is incurred for the OER by operation at near-neutral pH relative to operation under alkaline conditions.


2. Effects of pH on electrocatalyst composition. 
The composition of the electrocatalyst film is affected by the pH of the electrolyte. For example, when immersed in alkaline media, phosphate-containing CoOx (Co–Pi) prepared at near-neutral pH in buffered media rapidly converted into CoOx.23 In 1.0 M KOH(aq), the difference in catalytic activity per geometric area between the various forms of CoOx evaluated herein is thus ascribable primarily to differences in the active surface areas of the different CoOx films. At near-neutral pH (1.0 M K–Bi), the increased overpotentials observed for Co–Pi films (η10mAcm−2 = 580 mV) relative to the overpotentials exhibited by CoOx,ed films in the same electrolyte (η10mAcm−2 = 540 mV) may also indicate that the presence of phosphate inhibits the OER activity of oxidized cobalt species. Relative to the behavior of NiOx or NixFe1−x(OH)y, the relatively large overpotentials for the OER exhibited by CoOx films in near-neutral pH solutions of 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) are in accordance with prior reports of the electrochemical characteristics of Co-containing OER electrocatalyst films in a variety of near-neutral pH aqueous electrolytes.39
The three chosen electrolytes are commonly used in the development of photoelectrochemical solar-fuel devices or components,9,12,40,41 hence our observations are sufficient to highlight that the results with borate-buffered solutions may differ from the results with bicarbonate-buffered solutions. The pH dependence of the electrochemical activity of some of these catalysts has been presented previously.4,39,42–44 Most of the catalysts considered herein are only stable over a limited pH range,45 and also generally change in chemical composition as the pH is varied, precluding a full evaluation of all of the catalysts under consideration over a very wide range of pH conditions.


3. Electrocatalyst stability. 
Chronopotentiometric or chronoamperometric tests are valuable and widely used to evaluate the short-term stability of electrocatalysts,5,6 but are not designed to test the full range of electrochemical conditions that will be experienced by catalysts in an integrated solar-fuel device. For example, a solar-fuel device will not operate at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at night, nor will the anode be poised constantly at a potential substantially positive of E0′(O2/H2O). The stability of the catalysts over the potential range from E0′(O2/H2O) to E0′(O2/H2O) + η10mAcm−2 will however be relevant for catalysts being considered for integration into solar-fuel devices. Potential cycling is expected to stress the stability of the electrocatalysts,6 and to accelerate structural changes and dissolution that would lead to changes in the activity and optical properties of the catalysts.46
Although the electrocatalytic activity of CoOx,ALD was effectively eliminated by scanning the electrode potential in 1.0 M K–Bi (but was stable in 1.0 M KOH), the optical transmittance of the film at near-neutral pH was maintained after the loss of catalytic activity, suggesting a stable physical presence of the film rather than peeling or chemical etching of the film in the solution. The loss of activity can be caused by the buffer ions from the electrolyte blocking the surface reaction sites. Studies of the electrocatalyst at different stages of electrolysis, as well as reversibility using surface sensitive techniques such as XPS and Raman, could shed more light on this observation. The CoOx,ALD films had the lowest number of surface active sites relative to the other OER catalysts evaluated herein, so the loss of activity due to blocking of reactive sites would be more apparent for CoOx,ALD films than for CoOx films from electrodeposition.
The difference in activity and stability of NiOx,sp between 1.0 M borate and bicarbonate buffers that have mutually similar pH values also suggests that buffer species may affect the reactivity (Fig. S14, ESI†), as well as the optical and electrocatalytic stability, of such films. This observation agrees with studies performed in electrolytes that contained various alkali ions and cations, including CO32− from atmospheric CO2 in strongly alkaline solutions.46 These results clearly underscore the need to develop testing protocols that probe the stability of electrocatalysts under the likely range of operational conditions of solar-fuel devices.


4. Effects of loading and deposition methods. 
In general, increasing the thickness of electrodeposited films reduced the overpotential on the order of several tens of mV for a given current density (based on the geometric area of the electrode), while increasing the thickness of sputtered or ALD films had negligible impact on the overpotential required to reach a given current density. This result is consistent with generally accepted observations that electrodeposition results in porous films that show an increase in catalytically active surface areas as the film is thickened, while sputtering and ALD produce compact films that do not show substantial increases in active surface areas with increased thickness. Although compact films generally demonstrated higher overpotentials than thick electrodeposited films of the same nominal composition, in some cases compact films can serve as inherently protective coatings for photoelectrodes, whereas the porous nature of electrodeposited films does not impart an inherently protective nature to such films.22,23,47–49
To facilitate direct electrodeposition onto a semiconducting photoelectrode, the semiconductor must be stable and compatible with the electrocatalyst and electrodeposition conditions. When placed in contact with aqueous solutions, especially when poised at positive potentials, most, if not all, small-band-gap semiconductors (EG < 2.0 eV) form either insoluble insulating surface oxides or dissolve due to the formation of soluble oxides. Although Si does not have an appropriate band gap for use as a top absorber in a tandem cell, Si has been used in “mini-modules” for unassisted water splitting, as have triple-junctions of amorphous-hydrogenated Si.50 Moreover, Si undergoes corrosion reactions typical of small-band-gap semiconductors, forming surface oxides under many conditions, and is thus a useful substrate for illustrating the possible incompatibility between a semiconducting substrate and an electrodeposited catalyst. For example, electrochemical anodic methods for deposition of CoOx or Co–Pi are in competition with the facile anodic oxidation of Si. Once Si oxide is formed, Si is then electrically isolated and the catalyst deposition is terminated due to the insulating nature of the oxide. In such systems, a constant current can be maintained during electrodeposition at high voltages, however the current primarily results in thickening of silicon oxides. Anodic electrodeposition of catalysts such as Co–Pi or CoOx is thus not compatible with most semiconducting substrates, unless the semiconductors are stabilized by protective coatings prior to catalyst loading.51

B. Dependence of electrocatalytic activity on optical transmission

Fig. 8 plots the overpotential required for each catalyst to drive the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 when in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq), 1.0 M K–Bi(aq), or 1.0 M KOH(aq), as a function of the total transmittance while under operating conditions. Analogous data for the two canonical HER catalysts considered in this study, Pt and NixMoy, are also included in Fig. 8.

versus integrated optical transmittance at different catalyst loadings in electrolytes with different pH values. 
The dependence of the electrocatalytic activity on the optical transmission was most pronounced for NixMoy films, which are metallic and when operated in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) showed an absolute increase of 150 mV in overpotential between films having loadings that blocked 100% of incident light relative to films that transmitted 70% of the light. Although the Pt films evaluated in this work were also metallic, at the loadings used in this study, the high activities of the films produced essentially no change in overpotential between films that blocked ∼100% of the incident light and films that transmitted 90% of the incident light.
Under operational conditions for the OER, the porous films produced by electrodeposition blocked substantially more light but also resulted in higher activities than the non-porous films that were produced by other methods. For example, CoOx,ed films at loadings yielding η10mAcm−2 = 0.35 V for the OER in 1.0 M KOH(aq) transmitted only 28% of the incident light, while CoOx,ALD films at the highest loading used in this study transmitted 96% of the incident light but required an additional overpotential of 130 mV relative to CoOx,ed. For films at loadings yielding similar transmittances and with similar coloration mechanisms, electrodeposited and compact films required similar overpotentials. For example, CoOx,ed films with thicknesses that transmitted 81% of incident light exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 0.393 V for the OER in 1.0 M KOH(aq), whereas Co–Pi films having thicknesses that transmitted 79% of the incident light exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 0.376 V. For films operated in 1.0 M KOH(aq), the relationship between the electrocatalytic activity and optical transmittance appeared relatively flat; specifically, no crossing points were observed in the trend lines for the different catalysts in KOH(aq).
The transmittance vs. overpotential trends observed for OER electrocatalysts in 1.0 M KOH(aq) appeared to also hold for OER electrocatalysts in near-neutral pH electrolytes. For example, the porous films of NixFe1−x(OH)y produced by electrodeposition exhibited lower overpotentials for the OER, but transmitted less light, than the sputtered NiOx films; NixFe1−x(OH)y at loadings yielding T = 52% exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 311 mV, while NiOx,sp films at loadings yielding T = 69% exhibited η10mAcm−2 = 358 mV (Fig. 8b). In near-neutral pH solutions, the relationship between electrocatalytic activity and optical transmittance was flat, except for a marked increase in overpotential (∼100 mV) required to increase the transmittance of NiFe1−x(OH)y and CoOx,ed films to >75% (Fig. 8b). The overpotential versus optical transmittance behavior of NixFe1−x(OH)y crossed most of the other OER catalysts in 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) (Fig. 8b). However, this observation resulted from the electrochemical instability of NixFe1−x(OH)y at low loading in a buffered near-neutral electrolyte, in which the overpotential increased from 500 mV to 640 mV after 10 potential cycles (Fig. S20, ESI†).
These results suggest that, based solely on the overpotential and optical transmittance, improving the transmission of light through a continuous film of an OER catalyst to an underlying light absorber in an integrated solar-fuel device is preferentially accomplished by using lower loadings of highly active catalysts, rather than by use of a less active but more transparent catalyst material. This observation would not be valid for a catalyst that had a less flat overpotential versus transmittance curve than the catalysts examined herein, such as transparent metal films.52 Moreover, this observation does not consider the refractive index of compact films, such as CoOx,ALD and NiOx,sp, for protection and antireflective purposes in the design of an integrated device. In some cases, interfacial reactions may produce different catalytic compositions, activity, and optical properties than those determined herein and the analysis herein does not apply to such systems.64,65
C. Impact of trade-offs between optical transmission and electrocatalytic overpotential on design considerations for solar-fuel devices
The efficiency loss due to the increased overpotential that accompanies low loadings of catalysts is small relative to the efficiency loss that results from reduced transmittance when thicker catalyst loadings are used, especially under the conditions considered herein. The optimal band gaps for a tandem-junction cell, and the ηSTH of solar-fuel cells that use the thin-film electrocatalyst design, are sensitive to changes in the absorption spectra of the catalyst. The efficiency of such a cell will therefore vary if the absorption spectra of the catalyst vary over time. Such changes in absorption can occur due to electrochromism or loss of catalysts. At the lowest catalyst loadings, and thus at the lowest optical transmittance losses, the increased overpotential losses shift the optimized band-gap combination to higher energies, requiring larger band gaps (>1.70 eV) for the top junction to compensate for the increase in overpotential losses.53
As modeled, increasing the catalyst loading decreased ηSTH, in some cases substantially, due to the sensitivity of the efficiency to the transmittance of light through the catalyst. This observation is in accord with previous work comparing the efficiency gained by improvements in catalytic overpotentials for solar-fuel devices with the efficiency that can be gained by improving the light absorbers.16 These calculations provide estimates of the maximum attainable ηSTH in an idealized best-case scenario in which efficient tandem-junction light absorbers can be made from semiconductors with band gaps that are fully tunable throughout an arbitrary energy range, to illustrate the trade-offs between the overpotential and the optical properties of the catalysts. The maximum attainable ηSTH can be substantially reduced by the increase in non-radiative recombination losses that typically accompany the preparation of the materials and interfaces of tandem-junction light absorbers. The ability of a developmental integrated water-splitting system to meet a particular ηSTH may moreover be limited by not only the transparency of the catalyst, but also by the increases in the overpotential that accompany decreased catalyst loadings.54,55
In the absence of catalysts that are truly transparent under operational conditions, approaches that decouple the optical absorption of the electrocatalyst from the absorption of the semiconductor substrate may offer advantages relative to the thin-film catalyst design. Two approaches to this strategy are illustrated in Scheme 1: (1) patterning metal catalysts as islands on the photoelectrodes, at the cost of increasing the local current density through the catalyst islands, and thus increasing the overpotential needed to achieve a particular current density for the overall electrode;53,56,57 or (2) using light absorbers with a defined microstructure and morphology, such as mesoscopic metal oxides or Si microwire arrays, that allow strategic placement of the electrocatalyst into locations that do not detract, and in fact can enhance, the absorption of incident illumination by the light-absorbing material.58,59
V. Conclusions
The solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of an integrated solar-fuel device is the product of the interplay between electrocatalysts and semiconductors in various device designs and under various operational conditions. Understanding the combined electrocatalytic, optical, and chemical properties of electrocatalysts, along with their compatibility with an integrated system, is therefore important to selecting a device design and to optimizing the device performance.
The electrocatalytic activity of a material depends on the preparation method, as well as on the pH of the electrolyte and on any buffer species present in the electrolyte. For example, overpotentials of HER catalysts at cathodic current densities of 10 mA cm−2 are lower in acidic than in alkaline electrolytes, while OER catalysts are more active in alkaline solutions than in near-neutral pH electrolytes. All of the OER electrocatalysts evaluated herein, other than IrOx, dissolved in 1.0 M H2SO4(aq), and the OER catalysts examined in this study gradually lost electrocatalytic activity in buffered near-neutral pH electrolytes. OER catalysts with higher active surface areas exhibited lower overpotentials at current densities of 10 mA cm−2 (based on projected geometric surface area) than the same materials in the form of compact thin films, but showed more pronounced electrochromism than compact films. Materials deposited using anodic electrodeposition, such as CoOx and Co–Pi, are not compatible with most of the unprotected light-absorbing semiconducting substrates, which will either form insulating oxides or dissolve under such deposition conditions.
Although the transmittance of the OER catalyst films decreased with increases in catalyst loadings that yielded lower catalytic overpotentials, a crossing point was not observed in the transmittance vs. overpotential trend lines for the catalysts examined in this study. For example, in 1.0 M KOH(aq), NixFe1−x(OH)y exhibited the lowest overpotential and ALD CoOx exhibited the highest overpotential of the catalysts examined, independent of the transmittance of the film. This observation may not extend to OER catalysts that could potentially exhibit different trade-offs between their optical and electrochemical properties, such as “transparent metal” films52 or other types of catalysts for fuel-forming reactions. The optical properties of catalysts that may be placed in the path of incident light for integrated PEC or PV-biased solar-fuel devices should therefore be evaluated alongside other metrics of catalyst suitability for use in such systems. Future efforts to benchmark the catalyst activity, and characterize the activity of new electrocatalysts for use in solar-fuel devices, should thus report not only the overpotential of the catalyst, but also the overpotential at loadings that allow optically relevant transmittance of light, e.g., T > 90%.
Modeling indicated that when the OER catalysts examined in this work are integrated as continuous films in the path of incident light into a solar-fuel device driven by semiconductors operating at the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit, the efficiency loss due to the increased overpotential of low catalyst loadings is small relative to the efficiency loss due to reduced transmittance that accompanies the use of thicker catalyst loadings. Therefore, within the scope of the catalysts examined herein, the maximum attainable ηSTH varied little (ηSTH range of only 18–23%) with the selection of OER catalysts, if a tandem light absorber with a fixed band-gap combination was used. Additionally, as modeled, the dependence of the maximum attainable ηSTH with catalyst selection can be decreased further if the band gap of the top absorber is tuned to an optimal value for that catalyst and system.

Broader context
In integrated photoelectrochemical solar-fuel generators, either the fuel-forming catalyst or the oxygen-evolving catalyst is placed in the path of incident sunlight. The optical spectrum that reaches the underlying semiconducting light absorbers can thus be modified substantially by the presence of the required electrocatalyst. Electrocatalysts for the oxygen-evolution reaction are typically electrochromic under operational conditions, and the electrochromic spectrum varies with catalyst loading, materials, and preparation methods. Understanding the combined electrocatalytic, optical, and chemical properties of electrocatalysts, the interplay between the optical absorption and catalytic overpotential of the material, and the compatibility of the electrocatalyst with an integrated solar-fuel generator system is therefore important for the design and optimization of integrated solar-fuel generators.


 	Scheme 1  (a) A discrete photovoltaic plus electrolyzer setup (PV-E), and integrated photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar-fuel generators with (b) a continuous, transparent catalyst film covering the top light absorber, (c) an array of catalyst islands covering the top light absorber, and (d) a microwire design with catalysts deposited at the base of the microwires, out of the path of the light. Protective layers and antireflective layers are not shown.

 	Fig. 1  Effect of catalyst loading on the geometric current density versus potential behavior of oxygen-evolution catalysts prepared using different synthetic techniques. (a) CoOx,ed (1.1, 4.8, 58.5, and 127.9 mC cm−2), (b) Co–Pi (10, 60, and 120 mC cm−2), (c) CoOx,ALD (3, 10, and 50 nm), (d) NixFe1−x(OH)y (−20, −50, and −100 mC cm−2), (e) NiOx,sp (7, 35, 75 nm), and (f) IrOx (3, 6, and 20 nm). (a–e) were measured in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) and (f) was measured in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). The figures-of-merit for the loadings are the measured film thicknesses (ALD and sputtered films) or catalytically active surface area (electrodeposited films) as reflected by the cathodic charge density measured in the pseudocapacitive region of the J–E scans.	 

 	Fig. 2  Effects of pH on the OER activity of catalyst films at the highest loadings tested in (a) 1.0 M KOH(aq), (b) 1.0 M K–Bi(aq), and (c) 1.0 M H2SO4(aq). CoOx,ed (127.9 mC cm−2), Co–Pi (120 mC cm−2), CoOx,ALD (50 nm), NixFe1−x(OH)y (−100 mC cm−2), NiOx,sp (75 nm), and IrOx (20 nm).	 

 	Fig. 3  Comparison of optical transmittance spectra of as-deposited films (dashed curves) and for films in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) (a–e) or 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) (f) while passing a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER (solid curves). Spectra were averaged over scans taken at 3 different spots on the sample. (a) CoOx,ed, (b) Co–Pi, (c) CoOx,ALD, (d) NixFe1−x(OH)y, (e) NiOx,sp, and (f) IrOx. The blue, green and orange curves depict the transmission spectra of the electrocatalysts at high, medium and low loading, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  Comparison of the optical transmittance spectra of films at the highest loading in contact with 1.0 M KOH(aq) (dashed line) or 1.0 M K–Bi(aq) (solid lines) while passing a geometric current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER. Spectra were averaged over scans taken at 3 different spots on the sample. (a) CoOx,ed, (b) Co–Pi, (c) NixFe1−x(OH)y, and (d) NiOx,sp.	 

 	Fig. 5  Effect of pH on the catalytic activity of Pt (a) and NixMoy (b) at the highest loading for the hydrogen-evolution reaction.	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of optical transmittance spectra (T) for as-deposited films (dashed curves) and for films in contact with 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) while passing 10 mA cm−2 of cathodic geometric current density for the HER (solid curves). (a) Pt films (2, 5 and 70 nm) and (b) NixMoy (2, 10, and 20 nm) films. The optical transmittance spectra overlapped with the one under operational conditions, indicating negligible cathodic electrochromism.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Iso-efficiency plots showing the effect of NixFe1−x(OH)y loading on the efficiency and the band-gap combination of tandem junction solar-water splitting systems operating at the Shockley–Queisser limit, with (1) low, (2) medium and (3) high loadings. (b) Iso-efficiency plots showing the effect of non-radiative recombination dark current density on the efficiency and optimum band-gap combination of tandem junction solar-water splitting systems using NixFe1−x(OH)y at low loading as an example, (1) J0B,non = J0T,non = J0, (2) J0B,non = J0T,non = 102J0, and (3) J0B,non = 102J0 and J0T,non = 106J0. The assumptions in the calculation are specified explicitly in the Experimental section.
