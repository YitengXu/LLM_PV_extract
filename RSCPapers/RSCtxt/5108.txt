In Section 4.3, “These decarbonization fractions are not commensurate with the decarbonization targets required in transport, heat and industry under many scenarios, particularly as global aspirations turn to net zero emissions in the second half of the 21st century.84 This highlights that technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration may potentially be an expensive exercise in heroic futility if all aspects of hydrogen supply chains are not addressed. No cost is currently applied to methane emissions and the costs of mitigating supply chain emissions are less well understood than emissions at the point of conversion. It has been suggested that 75% of global methane emissions from oil and gas supply chains are mitigatable, with half of these achieved at a positive net present value.85” should read as “These decarbonization fractions are not commensurate with the decarbonization targets required in transport, heat and industry under many scenarios, particularly as global aspirations turn to net zero emissions in the second half of the 21st century.126 This highlights that technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration may potentially be an expensive exercise in heroic futility if all aspects of hydrogen supply chains are not addressed.

In Section 4.3.1, “The deployment of CCS at-scale is the only method widely considered to be available to substantially mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which so far has failed to meet ambitious expectations, and continued delays of demonstration projects are causing considerable uncertainty about the role CCS will play in carbon mitigation.87 This study has shown that equipping CCS to SMR (90% capture) only effectively reduces the life cycle GHG footprint of hydrogen production by 38–76%, depending on the contribution of supply chain emissions. Additionally, the capture rates may currently be lower than 90%.39” should read as “The deployment of CCS at-scale is the only method widely considered to be available to substantially mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which so far has failed to meet ambitious expectations, and continued delays of demonstration projects are causing considerable uncertainty about the role CCS will play in carbon mitigation.112 This study has shown that equipping CCS to SMR (90% capture) only effectively reduces the life cycle GHG footprint of hydrogen production by 38–76%, depending on the contribution of supply chain emissions.

It has also been proposed that waste biomass feedstocks could be co-fired in coal gasification facilities to further reduce the net CO2 closer to zero with minimal impact on the downstream flue gas treatment unit.128 In a plant with post-combustion capture this increases the cost of electricity by 6% and has no impact on the cost of CO2 avoidance, but the cost depends strongly on the cost of biomass.128” should read as “A recent report81 suggests with anticipated improvements in agricultural practices and plant breeding, feedstocks may exceed 244 million dry tons at a farm-gate price of $60 dry ton−1.
