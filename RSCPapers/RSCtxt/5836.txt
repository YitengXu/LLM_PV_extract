    , Accepted 12th September 2011First published on 17th October 2011AbstractPolymer solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure can greatly improve the photovoltaic stability. This paper reports surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) by spin coating a thin layer of various sodium compounds. ITOs with such a treatment were used as the cathode of the inverted PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor, and MoO3/Al as the anode. Among these sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives rise to high photovoltaic performance: an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.03 mA cm−2, fill factor of 0.67, and power conversion efficiency of 3.89% under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The efficiency is significantly higher than that (0.35%) of the control devices with untreated ITO as the cathode and even slightly higher than that (3.61%) of PSCs with normal architecture. The high performance of the inverted PSCs is due to the reduction of the work function of ITO by almost 1 eV by NaOH. The reduction in the work function of ITO was also observed by other sodium compounds, and it is consistent with the association constants of the anions of the sodium compounds with proton. The mechanism for the reduction of the work function is attributed to the dipole formation and alignment of the sodium compounds on the ITO surface.
1 Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received much interest due to the low fabrication cost, light weight, high mechanical flexibility and easy tuning of the electronic structure of the active materials. They are regarded as the next-generation solar cells. Significant progress has been made on improving the photovoltaic efficiency, including synthesizing new donor and acceptor materials,1–10 controlling the morphology of the active layer,11–14 and developing novel interfacial materials.15–17 Besides the photovoltaic efficiency, the stability is also a key issue for the practical application of PSCs. The stability is affected not only by the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer but also by the two electrodes. The acidic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is coated on ITO to help the hole collection, and the active metals like Ca, which are used as the cathode for the electron collection, are detrimental to the photovoltaic stability. The stability can be greatly improved by constructing PSCs in inverted architecture, which has ITO as the cathode for the electron collection and a stable material like MoO3 as the anode for the hole collection. The challenge in building inverted PSCs lies in developing novel approaches to effectively lower the work function of ITO for the electron collection. Two strategies have been adopted to reduce the effective work function of ITO: one is to coat ITO with a layer of material with a low work function or conduction band, such as TiO x ,18–20 ZnO,21,22 or Cs2CO3,23 on ITO; and another is to lower the work function of ITO through surface modification, such as organic self-assembled monolayer24–28 and alumina.29 The lowering of the work function of ITO by surface modification is generally attributed to the formation of dipoles on the ITO surface. For example, Nüesch et al. reported that the work function of ITO is quite sensitive to acid and base.30 An acid can increase while a base can decrease the work function of ITO. Although ITOs treated with acids have been exploited as the anode in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and PSCs,31,32 there is no report on inverted PSCs with base-treated ITO as the cathode.
This work reports the modification of ITO with a thin layer of sodium compounds, including NaOH, Na2B4O7, Na3PO4, sodium acetate (NaOAc), sodium p-toluenesulfonate (TsONa), Na2SO4, NaClO4 and NaNO3. These compounds can lower the work function of ITO, and the work function lowering is consistent with the association constants of the anions with proton. Reduction in the work function of ITO by almost 1 eV was observed. Modified ITOs with a low work function can be used as the cathode of inverted PSCs. High photovoltaic performance was observed on the inverted PSCs.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and device fabrication
PCBM was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. All other chemicals, including regioregular P3HT and NaOH (reagent grade, ≥98%, pellets, anhydrous), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials and solvents were used without further purification.
The inverted PSCs, which have architecture as shown in Scheme 1(a), were fabricated through the following process. ITO glass substrates were sequentially rinsed with Decon 90 detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Each step was carried out in a Branson 1510 ultrasonic water bath for 20 min. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were treated with UV-ozone (UVO cleaner 42-220, Jelight Company Inc.) for 15 min. The typical sodium compound treatment was carried out by spin coating either a methanol or an aqueous solution of a sodium compound like NaOH on ITO at 3000 rpm for 1 min and then heating at 120 °C on a hot plate for 10 min in air. The treated ITO substrates were transferred into a glove box filled with nitrogen. The active layer was deposited by spin coating a 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution consisting of 25 mg ml−1 P3HT and 25 mg ml−1 PCBM at 500 rpm for 60 s. After drying in Petri dishes for 1 h at room temperature, the P3HT:PCBM films were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. The devices were completed by thermally depositing a 5 nm thick MoO3 layer and subsequently a 120 nm thick Al layer in a vacuum of 1 × 10−6 mbar. Each device had an area of 0.11 cm2. The PSCs were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy glue (Epotek OG112-6, Epoxy Technology Inc.) and glass sheets in the glove box. They were taken out for the electrical testing in air.

2.2 Characterizations of materials and devices
Atomic force microscopic (AFM) images were acquired using a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM with the tapping mode. FTIR spectra were collected using a Varian 3100 FT-IR spectrometer. X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were obtained with a VG ESCA 220i-XL Imaging XPS. High-resolution TEM images were captured by a FEI Titan G2 80-200 S/TEM. The cross-sectional TEM sample was prepared by cutting an optimal inverted PSC using a FEI Helios NanoLab 600 focused ion beam (FIB) microscope. Thin layers of Pt and Au were successively deposited on the sample to enhance charge and heat transfer during FIB sample preparation.
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2420 source per metre. The devices were illuminated with a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Inverted PSCs with NaOH-treated ITO

Scheme 1(a) illustrates the architecture of an inverted PSC with NaOH-modified ITO. NaOH was deposited on the ITO surface by spin coating its methanol solution and subsequently heated at 120 °C in air. Low-boiling point solvent and high spin rate were employed to obtain a uniform layer of NaOH on ITO. NaOH-treated ITO was used for the electron collection, and MoO3 was for the hole collection. The energy diagram of the inverted PSC is shown in Scheme 1(b). The work function of the NaOH-treated ITO was determined by UPS, which is discussed in Section 3.3. Fig. 1 presents the current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of an inverted PSC with ITOs modified with NaOH. The J–V curves of an inverted PSC with blank ITO as the cathode and a PSC with normal architecture glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al are shown as well for comparison. The photovoltaic performances, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 1. The inverted PSC with NaOH-modified ITO exhibited remarkably higher photovoltaic performance than the control inverted PSC with blank ITO. All the Voc, Jsc and FF values are higher for the former. In particular, the Voc value is 0.58 V for the former, while it is only 0.16 V for the latter. The different Voc values suggest that the NaOH modification effectively changes the work function of ITO.

The inverted PSC with NaOH-modified ITO has the same Voc value as the normal PSC, while it has even higher Jsc and FF values. Thus, the inverted PSC has a PCE even slightly higher than the normal PSC. The higher PCE of the inverted PSC may be related to the distribution of P3HT and PCBM in the active layer along the vertical direction. As observed by Campoy-Quiles et al., the bottom of the active layer is rich in PCBM, while the top is rich in P3HT.33 Hence, an inverted architecture can facilitate both the electron and hole collections at the two electrodes and give rise to higher PCE.
The series (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of these devices were investigated to understand the NaOH effect. They were estimated in terms of the slopes of the J–V curves at 0 and 0.75 V, respectively. The Rs of the inverted PSC is smaller than that of the control inverted PSC, and it is even smaller than that of the normal PSC. This suggests that the NaOH-modified ITO forms good electrical contact with the active layer. The Rsh value of the inverted PSC is much higher than that of the control inverted PSC, while it is comparable to that of the normal PSC (Table 1). These resistance values are consistent with the photovoltaic performances of the devices.

The photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs depends on the experimental conditions of preparing the NaOH layer. Fig. 2 presents the J–V curves of inverted PSCs with NaOH prepared from methanol solutions of different concentrations and an inverted PSC without annealing of the NaOH layer. The NaOH concentration in solution affects the photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs (Table 2). The photovoltaic performances of the inverted PSCs indicate that the optimal NaOH concentration is 0.5 wt%. When the NaOH concentration was 0.1 wt%, the corresponding inverted PSC exhibited an efficiency of only 2.18%. Compared with the PCEs of the optimal inverted PSC, this low PCE is mainly due to the low Voc (0.48 V) and FF (0.48) values. The low Voc and FF values are related to the high Rs while low Rsh of this PSC using 0.1 wt% NaOH solution. Presumably, the solution with a low NaOH concentration gives rise to a low NaOH coverage on ITO. This is confirmed by the AFM images of ITOs treated with solutions of 0.1 wt% and 1 wt% NaOH (Fig. 3). The NaOH layer prepared from the 0.1 wt% concentration only partially covers the ITO. On the other hand, the PCE decreased to 3.25% for the treatment with 1.0 wt% NaOH solution because of the lower Jsc and FF values. This could be attributed to the thick NaOH layer on ITO, which increases Rs since NaOH is an insulator. The electrons are collected after they tunnel through the NaOH layer into ITO, so that a thick insulating NaOH layer can increase Rs.34–36

The NaOH layers were formed by spin coating methanol solutions of 0.1 wt%, 0.3 wt%, 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% NaOH and subsequently annealing at 120 °C at 10 min in air. The NaOH layer of one device coated using 0.5 wt% NaOH in methanol was not annealed for comparison.

The cross-section of an inverted PSC with the NaOH layer of optimal thickness was studied by high-resolution TEM. As shown in Fig. 4, the NaOH layer covers all the ITO area and has a relatively good uniformity.

The annealing of the NaOH layer in air is also important to achieve high photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 2, the inverted PSCs without annealing of the NaOH layer exhibited poor photovoltaic performance: Jsc = 5.30 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.38 V, FF = 0.42, and PCE = 0.84%. The annealing may affect the interaction between ITO and NaOH and some NaOH may convert into Na2CO3 during annealing.37 The conversion of NaOH into Na2CO3 was detected by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). The FTIR spectrum of NaOH remarkably changed after annealing. Three IR bands at 1631, 1086 and 825 cm−1 disappear. The FTIR spectrum of annealed NaOH becomes quite similar to that of Na2CO3.

The conversion from NaOH into Na2CO3 can improve the wettability of the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and PCBM on the NaOH-modified ITO as shown in the inset of Fig. 6. Because P3HT and PCBM are hydrophobic, they can form better contact with Na2CO3 than NaOH. This conclusion is also confirmed by the decrease of the Rs value of PSC after the annealing of the NaOH layer.

(a) and (c) were carried out in air, while (b) in a glove box filled with nitrogen. The insets are the pictures of 10 μl 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of 25 mg ml−1 P3HT and 25 mg ml−1 PCBM on ITOs coated with NaOH (a) without and (b) with annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. 
But the NaOH modification cannot be simply attributed to the NaOH conversion into Na2CO3. NaOH was coated and annealed in a glove box filled with nitrogen to avoid the conversion of NaOH into Na2CO3. The photovoltaic performance of the corresponding inverted PSC is shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. The PSC performance is: Voc = 0.60 V, Jsc = 9.06 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58, and PCE = 3.12%. Compared with the optimal inverted PSC, the shunt resistance was reduced by nearly half. The lower Jsc, FF and Rsh values suggest that the formation of Na2CO3 through annealing NaOH in air can facilitate the electron collection and suppress leakage current, which might be related to the better contact at the interface between the cathode and the active layer.

Moreover, only Na2CO3 on ITO is not good enough to achieve high photovoltaic performance. A layer of Na2CO3 was formed on ITO by spin coating a methanol solution of 0.3 wt% Na2CO3 in air. Methanol solution of 0.3 wt% Na2CO3 is the optimal condition for Na2CO3 modification of ITO for inverted PSCs. The corresponding inverted PSC exhibited a PCE of 3.27% (Fig. 6 and Table 3), inferior to that of the optimal inverted PSC with ITO treated by NaOH in air. Both Jsc and FF values of the inverted PSC with Na2CO3-treated ITO are lower than the inverted PSC with NaOH-treated ITO. These results suggest that the presence of both NaOH and Na2CO3 on ITO will be important for high photovoltaic performance.
The effect of Na2CO3 was further investigated by forming a layer of Na2CO3 and NaOH mixture on ITO. A methanol solution consisting of 0.08 wt% Na2CO3 and 0.42 wt% NaOH was spin coated on ITO at 2000 rpm and subsequently heated at 120 °C in a glove box. The obtained PSC has a PCE of 3.19%, which is only slightly better than that (3.12%) with ITO spin coated with NaOH in a glove box. This can be attributed to the different structure of NaOH and Na2CO3 on ITO. Coating and subsequent annealing of NaOH in air can give rise to a layer of Na2CO3 on NaOH, while they are mixed in the layer formed by spin coating the solution of NaOH and Na2CO3.
As observed by Nüesch et al., the work function of ITO can be lowered by dipping it into a NaOH solution.30 The NaOH treatment of ITO was also carried out by dipping the ITO into a methanol solution of 0.4 wt% NaOH for 7 h. It was then rinsed with copious deionized water for 1 min followed by drying at 120 °C for 10 min in air. The J–V curve of the inverted PSC with such an ITO electrode is also presented in Fig. 5, and the photovoltaic performances are listed in Table 3. All the parameters including Voc, Jsc, and FF are lower than those of the optimal inverted PSCs. The Voc value is only 0.43 V, remarkably lower than the optimal inverted PSC with ITO spin coated with NaOH. The difference between dip coating and spin coating of NaOH on ITO is that dip coating results in only a monolayer of NaOH on the ITO surface, while spin coating gives rise to a thick film of NaOH. The differences in the photovoltaic performances of the two PSCs, especially the Voc parameter, imply that the reduction in the work function of the ITO treated with spin-coated NaOH is greater than that of dip coated NaOH.
3.2 Photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs with sodium compound-treated ITO cathodes
In order to further understand the NaOH effect on the photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs, other sodium compounds, including Na2B4O7, Na3PO4, NaOAc, TsONa, Na2SO4, NaClO4 and NaNO3, were also spin coated to modify ITOs. Fig. 7(a) and (b) present the J–V curves of these inverted PSCs. The photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 4. The photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs depends on the sodium compounds. The inverted PSCs using ITO modified with NaOH, Na2B4O7, Na3PO4 and NaOAc exhibited high photovoltaic performance. Their Voc values are close to 0.6 V, and their PCE values are more than 3.3%. Voc drops to 0.42 eV, and PCE decreases to 1.94% for the device with ITO modified with TsONa. Voc and PCE further decrease for inverted PSCs using ITOs modified with Na2SO4, NaClO4 and NaNO3.

It is interesting to find that the photovoltaic performances of these devices are generally consistent with the association of the anions (A−s) of the sodium compounds with protons, A− + H+ → HA (Table 4), that is, the photovoltaic performance is related to the dissociation constant (Ka) of the corresponding acid (HA) of the anion of a sodium compound. The sodium compounds with a positive pKa value, such as NaOH, Na2B4O7, Na3PO4 and NaOAc, give rise to a PCE of above 3% and a Voc of higher than 0.55 V. In contrast, NaNO3, NaClO4, Na2SO4 and TsONa have negative pKa values of HAs, and corresponding inverted PSCs have poor photovoltaic performance.
3.3 Mechanism for reduction of the work function of ITO by sodium compounds
The work functions of ITOs untreated and treated with various sodium compounds were studied by UPS (Fig. 8 and Table 5). The kinetic energy of the cut-off edge shifts to lower energy after the modification of ITO with a sodium compound. This indicates the reduction in the work function of ITO. The reduction of work function after the modification with sodium compounds is consistent with the pKa values of the acids corresponding to the anions and the photovoltaic performances, especially the Voc parameter (Fig. 9). The greater the pKa value, the lower the work function of the modified ITO. The work function of untreated ITO is about 4.7 eV. Sodium compounds with their anions of positive pKa values can significantly reduce the work function of ITO to 3.7 eV or below, while the work functions are in the range between 4.3 and 4.6 eV for the ITOs modified with sodium compounds which have anions of negative pKa values.

 Fig. 9  Variations of the effective work function of modified ITO and Voc values of the corresponding inverted PSCs with the pKa values of the acids corresponding to the anions of the sodium compounds. 
The consistency of the work functions of modified ITOs with the pKa values of the corresponding acids of the anions indicates that the reduction in the work function of ITO is related to the association of anions with metal cations. A greater pKa value suggests stronger interaction of the anion with proton and other cations. Anions with a great pKa value like OH−, B4O72−, PO43− and OAc− can interact more strongly with In3+ and Sn4+ of ITO. As a result of these interactions, dipole moments are formed at the interface between ITO and the layer of the sodium compound. These dipole moments account for the vacuum level shift and thus work function reduction of the modified ITO.
The association of the anions with In3+ and Sn4+ of ITO is confirmed by XPS. The samples were prepared by spin coating 1 wt% methanol or aqueous solutions of various sodium compounds on clean ITO substrates, and subsequently annealing at 120 °C for 10 min in air. Then, the ITO substrates coated with sodium compounds were immersed into DI water multiple times. Finally, they were dried in dry nitrogen flow. As shown in Fig. 10a, a treatment with Na2SO4 or NaClO4 causes almost no change in the In 3d5/2 XPS band, in comparison with untreated ITO. However, this XPS band shifts to red by 0.1 to 0.2 eV for the ITO substrates treated with Na2B4O7 and Na3PO4. Similar effects were also observed on the Sn 3d5/2 XPS band of ITO as presented in Fig. 10b. These results indicate interactions between ITO and Na2SO4 or NaClO4 different from those between ITO and Na2B4O7 or Na3PO4.
 Fig. 10  (a) In 3d5/2 and (b) Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra of untreated ITO and ITO substrates treated with Na3PO4, Na2B4O7, NaClO4 and Na2SO4. 

Fig. 11 shows the In 3d5/2 XPS band of ITO treated with Na3PO4 at two different incident angles of X-ray. The red shift at the incident angle of 60 degrees with respect to the incident angle of 0 degrees evidences that the sodium compound-induced red shift in the In 3d5/2 binding energy arises from the association of the anions and metal ions of ITO at the ITO surface.
 Fig. 11  In 3d5/2 XPS spectra of ITO treated with Na3PO4 at incident angles of 0 degree and 60 degrees. 
Our model accounting for the sodium compound-induced change in the work function of ITO is similar to that by Nüesch et al. on the alkaline effect on ITO, who proposed that OH− can associate with the metal ions of ITO.30 Besides OH−, other anions like B4O72−, PO43− and OAc− can also associate with the metal ions of ITO in our model. The association is related to the pKa values of the acids corresponding to the anions. H2SO4 and HClO4 have a remarkable negative pKa value, so that the anions do not associate with the metal ions of ITO and the corresponding sodium compounds do not affect the work function of ITO.
Our model implies the presence of Na+ and anions on the surface of ITO if a sodium compound remarkably lowers the work function of ITO. The presence of Na+ was observed for ITO substrates treated with Na3PO4 and Na2B4O7, while it was not detected for ITO substrates treated with NaClO4 and Na2SO4 (Fig. 12a). We also observed the P 2p XPS signal on the ITO substrate treated with Na3PO4 (Fig. 12b). In contrast, no S 2p XPS signal was detected on ITO treated with Na2SO4.

As mentioned above, the photovoltaic performance of inverted OPVs with NaOH-modified ITOs is sensitive to the coating conditions. The effects of these experimental conditions on the work function of ITO were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 13, modification of ITO by dip coating NaOH only reduces the work function to 4.33 eV, less significant than that by spin coating NaOH either in air or in a glove box. Dip coating produces only a monolayer of NaOH on the ITO surface, while the spin coating method deposits a thick NaOH film, which might consist of a few layers of NaOH. The more significant reduction in the work function of ITO by spin coating of NaOH suggests that NaOH molecules of not only the first layer from ITO but also the follow-up layers may orient at the surface of ITO.
 Fig. 13  Normalized UPS spectra of ITOs (a) untreated, (b) dip coated with NaOH, (c) spin coated with Na2CO3 in air, (d) spin coated with NaOH in air, and (e) spin coated with NaOH in a glove box. 
UPS was also used to study the oxygen effect on the work function of ITO during the NaOH modification. As shown in Fig. 13, spin coating of NaOH in a glove box can reduce the work function more significantly than that in air. This indicates that the conversion of NaOH into Na2CO3 is not important for the reduction of the work function of ITO. In fact, the work function of Na2CO3-treated ITO is 3.80 eV, even slightly higher than that of NaOH-treated ITO. This is probably due to the higher pKa value of CO32− than OH−. These work functions are consistent with the observations on the inverted PSCs.
4 Conclusions
In summary, the surface modification of ITO with NaOH can significantly reduce the work function. The NaOH-modified ITO can be used as the cathode of inverted PSCs for the electron collection. The photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSCs with NaOH-modified ITO is sensitive to the experimental conditions, including the NaOH concentration, annealing of the NaOH layer and oxygen during the modification. The reduction in the work function of ITO was also observed when other sodium compounds were coated to modify ITO. The work functions of modified ITOs and the photovoltaic performance of inverted PSCs are related to the pKa values of the acids corresponding to the anions of the sodium compounds. The reduction of the work function by sodium compounds is attributed to the formation of a dipole moment on the surface of ITO, which is related to the interactions between the anions of sodium compounds and the Sn4+ and In3+ cations of ITO.
