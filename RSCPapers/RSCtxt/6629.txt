    , Accepted 20th July 2015First published on 22nd July 2015AbstractHeteroatoms and porosity both have different, but definite effects on the electrochemical capacitance of carbon materials. These effects are studied in detail by using cubic ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) co-doped with N and P. 3-Dimensional (3D) mesoporous silica, KIT-6, with bicontinuous cubic Ia3d symmetry is utilized as a hard template to synthesize the cubic OMCs. Interestingly, although the porosity parameters e.g. surface area and pore volume do not change much with N doping, a significant increase of these values is observed upon P doping. Moreover, the P content does not affect the N doping characteristics on co-doping of both N and P. When tested as a supercapacitor electrode, the N-OMC, despite its much lower porosity parameters, exhibits a similar specific capacitance to that of the P-OMC. The high specific capacitance of N-OMC arises mainly from the pseudocapacitive effect of doped N species, whereas high porosity parameters are the main reason for the specific capacitance shown by P-OMC. The synergistic contribution of both effects enables the NP co-doped OMC to show the highest specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1. Moreover, excellent retention of specific capacitance with more than 90% of initial capacitance is observed for NP-OMC at a high current density of 10 A g−1 and also for 3000 charge–discharge cycles. This is mainly because of high-surface area hierarchical porous structures with uniform and ordered mesopores in the cubic OMC, which facilitate the unrestricted movement of electrolyte ions to access the active surfaces, as well as the excellent synergistic effect of co-doping of N and P. This is also supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis, which shows negligible mass transfer resistance and internal cell resistance. Overall, the synthesized cubic OMC materials are found to be highly promising as electrodes for supercapacitors and other energy-related applications.
Introduction
In recent years, electrochemical capacitors, i.e. supercapacitors, have been one of the most exciting developments in the field of electrochemical energy storage and have been a subject of tremendous research effort.1,2 The main advantage of supercapacitors hinges on their exceptionally high power density (103–104 W kg−1), which is required to deliver high energy momentarily when needed.1–3 Apart from this, supercapacitors also have long cycle life (>106 cycles), low maintenance cost, and better safety.1–4 Electrochemical energy storage in supercapacitors can be achieved by two kinds of charge storage mechanisms. One depends on reversible faradic redox reactions of electroactive species present on the surface, which is called pseudocapacitance.1,3,4 And the other is based on separation of charge in the Helmholtz double layer at the interface between the surface of a conductive electrode and an electrolyte giving rise to electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC).1,5 Carbon, in its various forms, is the most extensively examined and widely utilized electrode material in EDLCs with development focusing on achieving a high surface area and low matrix resistivity.1,2,5–7
Recently, carbon materials as the best environmentally friendly active electrode materials have been widely used in advanced energy storage and conversion devices such as Li ion batteries, supercapacitors, dye-sensitized solar cells, and fuel cells due to their versatile existing forms and outstanding thermal, electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties.2,7–12 In general, activated carbon materials are popular as supercapacitor electrodes since the capacitive charge storage takes place predominantly at the micropores.7,13 However, the small size of these micropores (pore size < 2 nm) hinders the facile movement of electrolyte ions, and thus full access to the total electrode/electrolyte interface area is not achieved.7,13 On the other hand, the presence of a large amount of mesopores can lead to high mobility of electrolyte ions to access the maximum surface area, which is evidenced by the excellent rate capability and cyclic stability of mesoporous carbon electrodes.7,14–16 Therefore, appropriate control over the mesopore/micropore volume, pore size, and pore structure as well as a suitable choice of electrolyte can ensure much better performance in terms of both power delivery and energy storage capacity.6,7,11,16,17 For this reason, template-based synthesis of porous carbons has gained wide spread attention due to the uniform well-organized pore size distribution and the possibility of tailoring the pore structure.11,13,18
In general, two different types of templates e.g. hard templates (nanostructured silica, zeolite, ZnO, and metal–organic framework) and soft templates (assembly of a surfactant, block copolymer or liquid crystal) are used to synthesize nanostructured porous carbons (NPCs) with different surface morphologies and porosities.7,14,15,17,18 These NPCs possess an exciting combination of favourable physical properties such as high surface area, tuneable pore size, and large pore volume with narrow pore size distributions, allowing facile molecular transport of reactants and products. In particular, ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) prepared using different sacrificial mesoporous silica templates have been investigated greatly because of their excellent performances as electrode materials for supercapacitors.11,18–21 However, most of such investigations focused on hexagonal-type OMC materials prepared from hexagonal mesoporous silica templates such as SBA-15 and MCM-41. KIT-6 silica is one of the exciting developments in this field, which has a large pore diameter with 3-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous cubic Ia3d symmetry, and possesses mesopore channels organized into an ordered enantiomeric framework.22,23 These unique properties can be utilized to synthesize cubic ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with not only high specific surface area and pore volume, but also a 3D open and ordered pore structure. However, still only a few reports can be found on cubic OMC materials.24–27
Recently, many studies have been conducted to improve the capacitive behaviour of carbon-based electrodes by surface modification with heteroatoms.17,28–30 The incorporation of heteroatoms such as phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S) and boron (B) on the surface of carbonaceous materials has been found to enhance the electrochemical performance.28–32 The difference in the size and electronegativity of covalently bonded heteroatoms with carbon not only introduces high energy defect sites on the surface, but also breaks the electroneutrality of host carbon through conjugation with either a lone-pair of electrons from electron-rich dopants or holes from electron-deficient dopants.33 This phenomenon changes the charge density around the carbon atoms neighbouring the heteroatom, making it either electron-rich or electron-deficient, and in this process, large numbers of active functional groups are generated. These functional groups not only help in absorption of electrolyte ions on the surface of an electrode, but also can induce a reversible pseudocapacitive reaction with the electrolyte.33,34
Particularly, N doping has been reported to enhance the capacitive performance significantly by altering the microstructure, electrical conductivity, and chemical reactivity and also by taking part in the reversible faradaic process.28,33,35–39 P and N both have the same number of valence electrons in the outer shell and often exhibit similar chemical properties.12 Moreover, P has higher electron-donating ability and stronger n-type behaviour than N, which make it an astute choice as a dopant to carbon materials.40 P-doped carbon is reported to show highly stable capacitive performance.41 Recently, P-doped carbon has been demonstrated as a fuel cell electrocatalyst due to its excellent electrochemical behaviour.8 Previous studies suggest that incorporation of P generally takes place at the edge-plane sites of the graphitic framework due to the larger atomic size (0.106 nm vs. 0.077 nm for C), whereas N doping takes place both in edge plane and basal plane sites.9,39,42 Since, it is known that the presence of heteroatoms at edge sites can enhance the capacitive performance drastically, it is conceivable that the co-substitution of N and P atoms can result in further enhancement of the energy storage due to the synergistic effect.9,31,39,42 In addition, a detailed study of co-doping with N and P can offer a systematic way to study the influence of each element on the electrochemical performance. However, 3D cubic ordered OMCs with heteroatom-doping have been rarely studied. So far, Vinu et al. and Zhang et al. have reported N-doped and N- and S-doped cubic OMCs, respectively, for supercapacitor application.34,43 To the best of our knowledge, N and P co-doped cubic OMC has never been reported for EDLC behaviour.
Several techniques such as ammoxidation, chemical vapour deposition, microwave assisted carbonization, chemical activation, plasma treatment and so on have been reported to introduce heteroatoms into carbon frameworks, but those are often tedious, costly, and time-consuming processes.8,31,32 Several N and P precursors such as N containing polymers, biomolecules, and organic phosphine have also been employed for the synthesis of doped carbon.31,33,44,45 However, most of these precursors are environmentally harmful and/or expensive. In this context, urea and phytic acid as very simple, cheap and environmentally benign molecules are considered more preferable precursors for N and P doping, respectively. Recently, a N, S and P ternary-doped graphene material was reported using thiourea and triphenylphosphine as heteroatom precursors and achieved high electrocatalytic activity as a fuel cell catalyst.9
In this work, we report a simple, yet efficient method for preparation of N and P co-doped 3D cubic ordered mesoporous carbons (NP-OMC) using saccharose as a carbon source along with urea and phytic acid (PA) as precursors for N and P as well as carbon, respectively, and cubic ordered Ia3d mesoporous silica KIT-6 as a hard template. The effect of precursors on the structural properties is carefully elucidated with the help of different characterization methods. We also demonstrate the application of these 3D cubic OMCs with controllable N and P contents as supercapacitor electrode materials. It is found that the doping of N and P affects the electrochemical activity in different ways, and co-doping of both enhances the overall electrochemical performance due to the interesting synergistic effect.
Experimental
Synthesis of the KIT-6 template
The cubic mesoporous silica template, KIT-6, was synthesized according to a previously reported method.22,23 In a typical synthesis using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), 6 g of P-123 was first dissolved in 217 g of distilled water and 11.8 g of concentrated HCl (35%). To this, 6 g of 1-butanol (Aldrich, 99.4%) and TEOS were added slowly under continuous stirring at 35 °C with a mole ratio of TEOS:P-123:HCl:H2O:BuOH = 1:0.017:1.83:195:1.31. This mixture was left under continuous stirring for 24 h at 35 °C, and then heated for 24 h at 100 °C under static conditions in a tightly closed polypropylene bottle. A white solid product obtained after hydrothermal treatment was filtered, washed with an ethanol/HCl solution mixture, and then dried at 80 °C overnight. This product was then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h at a temperature ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 to obtain surfactant-free uniformly KIT-6 ordered mesoporous silica.
Synthesis of OMC, N-OMC, P-OMC and NP co-doped OMC
The cubic 3D ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) were prepared by using saccharose as a carbon source and KIT-6 ordered mesoporous silica as a hard template. For synthesis of N-OMC, P-OMC and NP-OMC, required amounts of dopant precursors (urea and phytic acid) were used. The amounts of all the precursors are given in Table S1 of the ESI.† The precursors were added to a minimal volume of DI water and stirred to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The mixture was then vacuum-impregnated in the calcined cubic ordered Ia3d mesoporous silica KIT-6 at room temperature. The obtained mixture composite was dried at 80 °C, and the remnant solid was grinded to form a fine composite powder. This composite was then pyrolyzed at 900 °C under an inert environment in a tubular furnace (OTF-1200 MTI Corporation) at a temperature ramp rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept for 5 h. The pyrolyzed material was then washed with 1.0 M HF solution to etch out the silica template and to obtain silica-free NP-doped OMC products. Undoped OMC, N-OMC, and P-OMC were also synthesized by the same process as the NP-OMC except the precursor variation.
Physical characterization
The morphology of all the synthesized OMC samples was observed on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) JEOL FE-2010 operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained using a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with Cu-Ka (0.15406 nm) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Raman spectra data were recorded with a Renishaw spectrometer using an Ar ion laser (k = 514.5 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze surface elemental compositions of OMC samples using an ESCALAB 250 XPS System with a monochromated Al Ka (150 W) source. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of all carbon samples were measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 accelerated surface area and porosity analyzer after the carbon was degassed at 150 °C to 20 mTorr for 12 h. The specific surface areas of all the samples were determined based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from nitrogen adsorption data in the relative pressure range of 0.05 to 0.2. The micropore area and volume were calculated by using the t-plot method. The mesopore volume and pore size distribution was derived from desorption branches by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Electrochemical characterization
All the synthesized OMC materials were electrochemically characterized in an electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Biologic) using a conventional three-electrode configuration with 6.0 M aqueous KOH solution as an electrolyte. 2 mm thick nickel foam (99.8% pure, MTI Corp.) was used as a current collector. A coiled Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, Hg/Hg+ in saturated KCl solution) were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The counter electrode was cleaned with acidic piranha solution to remove any impurities. The active material was mixed with a conducting agent (graphite) and a binder (polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1, and a slurry was prepared by using 1-methyl-pyrrolidone as a solvent. The slurry was brush-coated on the Ni foam over a 1 cm2 area and dried overnight at room temperature followed by another overnight drying in an oven at 80 °C. The dried electrode was then pressed at 2.0 MPa pressure to obtain a 20 μm thick electrode. Approximately, 5 (±1) mg of active materials was loaded in each electrode. The electrochemical measurements were carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. CV and CD were recorded in the 0.0 to −1.0 V potential window. EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 mHz with a 10 mV AC amplitude around 0 V. The specific capacitance was calculated from CD measurements using the following equation:  where I is the current, t is the time of discharge, m is the mass of the active material, and V is the potential window.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a graphical representation of the synthesis procedure used in this study. All the 3D cubic ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) were synthesized using saccharose as a carbon precursor and urea and phytic acid (PA) as N and P precursors, respectively, and KIT-6 silica as a sacrificial template. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of OMC, N-OMC, P-OMC and NP-OMC samples. All the samples show the two typical broad peaks with low intensities assigned to [0 0 2] and [1 0 0] diffraction planes of turbostratic carbon, indicating that the OMC samples have low graphitization degrees.46 Interestingly, all the samples show shifting of [0 0 2] plane diffraction peaks from 26.54° of graphite to lower values of 24.2–25.0°, which means that the interlayer spacing of the [0 0 2] plane in the synthesized OMCs is expanded from usual 3.34 Å for graphite. On careful observation, it is found that this expansion of interlayer spacing is almost the same in OMC and N-OMC i.e. 3.54 Å, but it increases to 3.67 Å in P-OMC and 3.63 Å in NP-OMC. This is maybe attributed to catalytic distortion of the graphitic plane due to the use of PA as a P source and/or the larger atomic size of doped P compared with carbon.

PA with a chemical formula of C6H6 (H2PO4)6 known as inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), or phytate when in salt form, is a unique substance, which contains twelve acidic protons in six P-containing units on a single six-carbon molecule.47 PA, which is considered to be the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant tissues, is used as a P source and maybe also as a partial C source here. Due to the presence of high amounts of acidic functionalities, PA can create severe distortion in the carbon structure by gases generated at high annealing temperature, which can result in deformation of the resulting carbon structure. Fig. 2(b) shows small angle XRD profiles of synthesized OMC materials and the KIT-6 silica template. The KIT-6 silica exhibits a well-resolved hkl reflection characteristic of highly ordered 3D cubic Ia3d symmetry as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†22,23 All the OMCs except P-doped OMC exhibit a cubic structure, which is similar to that of the KIT-6 silica template. The observed deviation in P-doped OMC is probably due to the high degree of deformation in the ordered pore structure by the catalytic effect of PA.

Fig. 3(a), (b) and (d) represent the HR-TEM images of OMC, N-OMC and NP-OMC, respectively, which reveal a well-ordered mesoporous structure with a linear array of mesopores in a regular interval arrangement. The uniform nature of open and accessible pores of carbon can be clearly observed in the HR-TEM image, which is an inverse replica of the cubic Ia3d mesostructure of the KIT-6 template. N-OMC in Fig. 3(b) also clearly shows the cubic array symmetry of the connected channels as observed for OMC in Fig. 3(a). This may be due to the excellent compatibility of the N precursor (e.g. urea) with the primary carbon precursor (e.g. saccharose). In contrast, Fig. 3(c) demonstrates some distortion in the carbon framework of P-OMC, which may be ascribed to the use of PA as a P precursor.42 PA reveals the catalytic effect during pyrolysis at high temperature and introduces phosphate linkages at the graphitic edges, which results in a higher expansion or dilation of porous structures and ultimately leads to distortion of the structure with a further increase of mesopore volume. In the case of NP-OMC as shown in Fig. 3(d), less extent of distortion is observed, which is due to the reduction of the amount of PA used and the use of more compatible urea in primary carbon precursors. The EDS elemental mapping data in Fig. S2 of the ESI† show that both N and P are uniformly distributed over the NP-OMC surface.

The effect of heteroatom doping on the textural properties of prepared samples was further characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis. Fig. 4(a–h) show the nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) curves of the OMC samples. Fig. S1 of the ESI† shows nitrogen isotherms and the PSD curve of parent KIT-6 silica. All the samples exhibit a type IV adsorption isotherm with a H1 hysteresis loop, which indicates the mesoporous nature of the synthesized carbon material, which is in good agreement with HR-TEM images observed in Fig. 3. The sharp increase in the adsorption amount at the initial step of the hysteresis loop corresponding to the capillary condensation of nitrogen inside the mesopores reveals the narrow pore-size distribution of the carbon materials.27,47 Interestingly, all the isotherms reveal two capillary condensation–evaporation steps related to two mesoporous groups of different sizes located around at 4 nm and around at 11 nm as shown in Fig. 4(e–h). This indicates that some pores in the KIT-6 template are too small to form carbon bridges through them, creating additional mesopores probably with larger mesopore size besides the typical mesopores generated from dissolution of silica walls during replication.

The specific surface area and pore volumes are calculated, and the data are summarized in Table 1, where it can be observed that the specific surface areas of OMC, N-OMC, P-OMC and NP-OMC are determined to be 1127, 1275, 2282, and 1968 m2 g−1 along with total pore volumes of 1.43, 1.72, 3.07, and 2.47 cm3 g−1, respectively. It clearly shows that the introduction of heteroatoms into the carbon framework results in an increase in the specific surface area and pore volume. It is interesting to observe that when N is doped using urea, there is only a small increase in the specific surface area and pore volume by 148 m2 g−1 and 0.29 cm3 g−1, respectively. On the other hand, P doping results in a significant increase of the specific surface area and pore volume by 1155 m2 g−1 and 1.64 cm3 g−1, which are almost twice the values of undoped OMC. This observation can be attributed to the formation of the phosphate linkage on the carbon edge, which leads to expansion in pore structures. Phytic acid has ability to release phosphoric acid anions at high temperature that can function as an acid catalyst in promoting bond cleavage reactions and formation of crosslinks such as cyclization and condensation.42 It reduces tar formation and therefore renders micropores increased during pyrolysis, which significantly augments the surface area and pore volume accessible for nitrogen diffusion at 77 K. Moreover, the atomic size difference between P and C is much larger than that between N and C, which also results in expansion of the graphitic plane in the P-OMC, which is also evident from XRD results. Interestingly, all the parameters are found to decrease in the case of NP-OMC compared with P-OMC. This is probably due to the usage of less amount of phytic acid during the synthesis of NP-OMC. Here, it should be mentioned that the surface area as well as pore volume has a definite effect on electrochemical capacitance.

Fig. 5(a) shows the RAMAN spectra of OMC, N-OMC, P-OMC, and NP-OMC samples. Two distinctive peaks assigned as D and G bands are observed in all the samples. The D band corresponding to RAMAN inactive mode (A1g), becomes activated due to the occurrence of defects in the carbon lattice, whereas the G band (E2g) appears due to the stretching vibration of the C–C bond.9 The intensity ratio of D and G bands in the structure is often used to indicate the level of disorder in the sample. The introduction of heteroatoms into the carbon framework induces the edge defects on the carbon surface, which results in the D band formation. Interestingly, P-containing P-OMC and NP-OMC increase the D band intensity relative to the G band, which indicates increasing disorderedness of P-doped carbons.
 Fig. 5  (a) Raman spectra and (b) XPS survey spectra of synthesized OMC samples. 
The incorporation and bonding characteristics of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus elements were examined by XPS. The comparative survey spectra of the elements present in all the OMC samples are given in Fig. 5(b), and detailed data of spectroscopic analysis are given in Table 2. The incorporation of N and P into the carbon framework of OMCs can be clearly observed from the peaks present at 399.5 eV and 132.3 eV, respectively, in N-OMC, P-OMC, and NP-OMC, which can be assigned to N 1s and P 2p energy levels. It can be observed from Table 2 that all the OMCs possess high oxygen contents due to the presence of O in all the used precursors. It can be noted that the oxygen content increased a bit with N doping, whereas it drastically increased with P doping. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the bonding nature of N and P with the carbon framework.

Fig. 6 shows the nature of N and P bonding on the carbon surface of N-OMC, P-OMC, and NP-OMC, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6(a) and (c), for deconvolution of N 1s, four major peaks assigned to (N-1): pyridinic (∼398.4 eV), (N-2): pyrrolic (∼399.6 eV), (N-3): quaternary (∼400.4 eV), and (N-4): oxides of nitrogen (∼401.8 eV) are found in N-OMC and NP-OMC, respectively.29 Relative amounts of all the N species are found to be similar in both samples, which indicates that phytic acid does not have a significant effect on the N doping, and N and P may separately bind to the carbon framework. Negatively charged nitrogen in pyridinic and pyrrolic arrangements can deliver additional free electrons or delocalized electrons for the conduction band, which take part in pseudocapacitive faradic reactions.33,35,45 Moreover, quaternary N and pyridinic N-oxides are also important for enhancing the capacitance by creating active surfaces and helping electron transportation.38,48 As shown in Fig. 6(b) and (d), the deconvolution of P 2p spectra of P-OMC and NP-OMC shows that P is covalently bonded with C in the form of tetrahedral C3–PO at ∼132.2 eV and C–PO3 at ∼133.3 eV.49 This indicates that P is incorporated on edges of graphitic layers by bonding to one or more oxygen. This is evidenced by a drastic increase in the O content with P doping as seen in Table 2. Since this P–O linkage occurs particularly on the edges, it also increases the interlayer spacing as seen during XRD analysis. Furthermore, the surface area also increases substantially as evidenced from nitrogen adsorption–desorption data.

To evaluate the characteristics of the synthesized OMCs as electrode materials for supercapacitors and probable effect of heteroatom doping on electrochemical performance, they were tested in a three-electrode configuration in 6.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Fig. 7(a) shows the CV profiles of all the OMC samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 between 0.0 and −1.0 V vs. SCE. All the CV profiles show typical rectangular-like shapes along with some humps, which indicates the coexistence of electrical double layer capacitance and faradaic pseudocapacitance. A vertical change in the current density on altering the electrode polarity near at 0.0 and −1.0 V is also observed, indicating that the internal cell resistances of all the OMC electrodes are very low. This is due to the high amount of uniform arrays of ordered mesopores in all the OMC samples, which allow unrestricted flow of electrolyte ions to the active surfaces. With incorporation of dopant elements into the OMC samples, there is an increase in the current density observed in the order of OMC < N-OMC < P-OMC < NP-OMC, which can be attributed to the increase in the surface area and micropore volume in addition to the heteroatom effect. Cyclic voltammograms at different scan rates of 10, 25, 50, and 100 mV s−1 of all the OMC samples are also shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† Similar current density changes in proportion to scan rates are observed in the samples.

For the measurement of capacitive performance, charge–discharge (CD) was carried out by chronopotentiometry between 0.0 and −1.0 V at different current densities. Fig. 7(b) shows comparative CD curves of all the OMC samples at 1 A g−1 current density. All of the samples show linear charge–discharge profiles with negligible iR drop and almost 100% coulombic efficiency (i.e. equal charge and discharge time), which also implies very low internal resistance of the OMC electrodes. The specific capacitances calculated from discharge curves are 107, 148, 162, and 210 F g−1 for OMC, N-OMC, P-OMC, and NP-OMC, respectively. It is interesting to observe a significant increase (about 1.5 times) in specific capacitance of N-OMC compared with that of OMC, although the differences in the surface area and pore volume between them are not much significant. This increase can be attributed to the presence of N on the N-OMC surface. It is well known that pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and pyridinic N oxide are generated on the edge sites of the graphitic framework, whereas graphitic N is generated on the basal plane. It is reported recently that graphitic edge sites can deliver significantly higher capacitance than the basal planes.37,39,50 Although a high amount (more than 60%) of edge specific N species in N-OMC can contribute towards the higher capacitance, this cannot be the only reason for 1.5 times increase. It is also reported that pyridinic and pyrrolic N species can take part in surface faradaic pseudocapacitance in alkaline electrolytes through the following processes.28C*–NH2 + 2OH− ⇔ C*–NHOH + H2O + 2e−C*H–NH2 + 2OH− ⇔ C*NH + 2H2O + 2e−where C* stands for the carbon framework. This reversible redox reaction is induced by lone pairs of electrons from nitrogen atoms interacting in the electrolyte solution. Thus, pyridinic and pyrrolic N species in carbon result in attraction of ions and consequently enhance the capacitance due to their pseudocapacitive influences. This pseudocapacitance is the main contributor toward the observed capacitance increase in N-OMC compared with undoped OMC.15,35–37,39 On the other hand, the increase in the specific capacitance observed in P-OMC can be entirely attributed to the increase in the surface area and pore volume as compared with those of undoped OMC because the P atom is bonded only to the graphitic edge sites through the phosphate linkage, which cannot take part in electrochemical reactions. Thus, the high specific surface area and pore volume developed during the synthesis play a major role in increased capacitance in the P-OMC. Compared with the N-OMC, the P-OMC with an almost twice high surface area shows only a slight increase in capacitance. This may indicate that N species is more efficient in developing capacitance probably by participating in surface faradaic reactions, compared with P species. Interestingly, a huge increase in specific capacitance of NP-OMC, which is about 2 times more than that of undoped OMC, is attributed to the synergistic contributions from both pseudocapacitance and high increase in the active surface area. As discussed above, although there is a little interference toward N active sites caused by P doping and vice versa, this synergistic effect from dual doping is found to be beneficial for obtaining high specific capacitance in NP-OMC.
Rate capability is an important feature for supercapacitors since the main application of supercapacitors lies in their ability to charge instantaneously and deliver energy very fast when required, like in a flash in a digital camera, acceleration in electric vehicles and so on. Therefore, to test this feature, the charge–discharge measurements were carried out in all the OMC electrodes with increasing current density up to 10 A g−1. The corresponding change in specific capacitance with current density is given in Fig. 8(a), where it is observed that all the OMC materials show excellent retention of specific capacitance with 85–90% retention of initial capacitance for increasing current density up to 10 A g−1. This remarkable behaviour is attributed to the presence of a high amount of uniform and ordered mesopores in all the OMCs, which allows unhindered flow of the electrolyte ions to the active surface sites.5 A slight lower retention is observed in P-OMC, which is may be due to some increase in resistance or degradation of partially ionic phosphate linkages. Fig. S4 of the ESI† shows comparative CD profiles of all the OMC samples at a high current density of 10 A g−1, where the iR drop is observed to be below 25 mV for all of them. This corresponds to an internal cell resistance of below 0.5 Ω even at very high current density. These data support the excellent rate capability obtained for the OMC samples.

Supercapacitors are famous for retaining their capacitance up to a million of charge–discharge cycles. To test this feature for all the OMC electrodes, they were run for 3000 charge–discharge cycles at 1 A g−1 current density, and the corresponding results are given in Fig. 8(b). It can be observed that all of them show excellent retention of specific capacity for 3000 cycles. Among all, NP-OMC shows the best retention of 92% of the initial capacitance followed by OMC, N-OMC, and P-OMC, respectively. This behaviour can also be attributed to the high amount of ordered mesopores along with high pore volume present in the structure, which is beneficial for electrolyte transport during the charge–discharge process. It can be also observed that P-OMC shows a little less retention than N-OMC, which may be due to the probable degradation effect as discussed above.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is an important characterization tool for evaluation of the supercapacitor electrode, which can analyse the resistive behaviour of electrode materials. The representative Nyquist plots and Bode plots of all the OMC samples are given in Fig. 9. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 9(a) clearly show near to ideal vertical graphs without any high frequency resistor–capacitor loop for all the OMC electrodes, which indicates very good electrode contact throughout the electrodes.51,52 Moreover, the inset of Fig. 9(a) shows that the total internal resistances of all OMC electrodes (combination of equivalent series resistance and electrolyte distribution resistance) are below 0.4 Ω as obtained by extrapolating the vertical lines to the X axis.3,5,6,51,52 These data indicate negligible charge transfer resistance. This is mainly attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity and large amount of 3D open ordered mesopores in all the OMC electrodes, which can result in the very low internal cell resistance obtained from CV and CD data as discussed above. The Bode plots in Fig. 9(b) show the phase angle reaching almost 85° at 10 mHz AC frequency, which is very close to the phase angle of the ideal capacitor, that is, 90°. The EIS data strongly support the high rate capability and cyclic stability observed for the OMC electrodes. A large amount of 3D open ordered mesopores coupled with high electrical conductivity provides an excellent prospect for the OMC materials to act as efficient electrodes for supercapacitors and other electrochemical applications.

Conclusions
A comprehensive study was carried out for the electrochemical application of dual heteroatom-doped cubic OMCs as supercapacitor electrodes. Phosphorus and nitrogen were chosen as the dopant elements, and the hard template-based synthesis method was utilized by using a 3D cubic ordered mesoporous KIT-6 silica as a template. The resulting 3D cubic NP co-doped OMC materials showed a highly ordered uniformly arranged porous morphology. When only nitrogen is doped, a small increase in the surface area and pore volume was observed, whereas a huge increase of these values was found with P doping. It was interesting to find that the P content has almost no effect on the N doping characteristics in the case of NP-OMC. When tested as supercapacitor electrodes, all the OMC materials exhibited not only excellent capacitive performance, but also remarkable retention of capacitance at high current density as well as for long time operation. Among them, NP-doped OMC showed a high specific capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density and a markedly high retention of more than 90% not only at a high current density of 10 A g−1, but also for 3000 cycles of charge–discharge operation. All the OMC samples were found to have a high amount of mesopore volume, which enabled facile transfer of electrolyte ions through the ordered mesoporous structure to access the active surfaces. This behaviour was also supported by the EIS spectroscopic analysis, which showed negligible mass transfer resistance and internal cell resistance. Overall, the synthesized OMC materials were found to be highly promising as electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy-related applications, which need exceptionally high stability in rate and cyclic performance with high specific capacitance. Furthermore, the present process is a very simple and cost effective way for synthesis of cubic OMCs doped with different heteroatoms.
