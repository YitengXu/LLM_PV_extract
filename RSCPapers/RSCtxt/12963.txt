    , Accepted 4th October 2020First published on 5th October 2020AbstractMolecular orientation is one of the key parameters that would greatly influence the charge transportation in sandwich-type organic photovoltaic devices. Herein, two new A–π–D–π–A type acceptor molecules Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE are designed and synthesized based on a 2H-pyran derived ladder-type dipyran core (DTDPo). A branched 2-ethylhexyloxy chain is utilized to replace the linear hexyloxy one so as to improve the solubility and blend morphology. It's interesting that the dominant edge-on orientation for Ph-DTDPo-OTE could be converted to the favorite face-on packing when the alkyloxy chains are replaced by alkyl ones. The desired molecular orientations of both Ph-DTDPo-TE and PBDB-T could guarantee the efficient charge transportation. In addition, good miscibility and interpenetrated fibrils have been observed in the blend of Ph-DTDPo-TE:PBDB-T by both surficial and in-depth morphology characterization experiments. Finally, a high PCE of 12.21% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 20.83 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.14%) is achieved for Ph-DTDPo-TE, which is one of the highest values for binary OSCs based on a pyran comprising acceptor. Our research demonstrates that appropriate side chain engineering at the π-bridge is an effective strategy to regulate molecular orientations and the morphology of blend films.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received attention due to their excellent advantages such as light weight, flexibility, solution processability and roll-to-roll printability.1–4 In the past few years, the photovoltaic performance of OSCs has made a rapid improvement benefiting from the fast development for the materials of the active layers, especially by the emerging fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs).5 FREAs usually possess tunable optical absorption, adjustable energy level and synthetic simplicity.6–12 Thus, tremendous efforts have been devoted to this topic in the field of OSCs, and encouraging power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 16% and 17% have been achieved for single and tandem junction solar cells, respectively.13–16 The widely utilized strategies for molecular design are conceiving a new π-extended core, side-chain engineering, replacement of terminal groups with varied electron-withdrawing ability groups etc.10,17–22
In order to achieve high charge carrier mobility and broad absorption, large π-conjugated donor cores have been designed, which would inevitably increase the synthetic expense and complexity.23–25 With the idea of noncovalently fused ring electron acceptors (NCFREAs) put forward by our group, a series of high efficiency acceptors have been successfully developed by using the intramolecular noncovalent interactions (F⋯H, O⋯S, F⋯S etc.).26–32 Such a route avoids complicated synthesis and demonstrates a bright future in large-scale production and commercial utilization. On the other hand, it has been proven to be another effective strategy by inserting a π-spacer in between the donor and acceptor units. It can elongate the conjugated backbone, adjust the energy levels, regulate the blend film morphology, and so on.33–38
Pyran, as a nonplanar six-membered heterocyclic nonaromatic ring, can have two isomers (2H-pyran and 4H-pyran) according to different locations of the double bonds. The 2H-pyran is one widely adopted unit in OSCs and the functionalized oxygen could improve the electron donating ability when it is fused into the ladder conjugated core.39–41 It seems that such a flexible fragment will not hurt the intermolecular stacking, though a slight bend appears at the central part of the dipyran block in a previous report.42,43 In addition, a π-conjugation extended dipyran block has been developed as well and acceptors based on it have achieved excellent tandem OSCs with a PCE of 17%.16 To reduce the synthetic complexity of the elongated dipyran core, we have adopted a π-spacer with an outer position substituted hexyloxy chain in previous dipyran acceptor design. Such a confined end group would achieve a planar conformation and enhance the π–π stacking of terminals. It's interesting that the hexyloxy group at the π-spacer would shift the face-on oriented patterns to the unfavorable edge-on ones for Ph-DTDPo-OT, whose strong molecular aggregation and poor processability have been noticed during device fabrication.44
Herein, two new A–π–D–π–A FREAs have been prepared deriving from Ph-DTDPo-OT with the side chain replacement. The branched ethylhexyloxy substituted Ph-DTDPo-OTE could improve the blend morphology and reduce the severe self-aggregation. However, the edge-on orientation of Ph-DTDPo-OT in film is inherited by Ph-DTDPo-OTE as revealed by the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization. It's surprising that Ph-DTDPo-TE displays a totally different face-on molecular orientation with the alkyloxy side chains replaced by the 2-ethylhexyl ones at the π-bridge. The desired arrangement style of both Ph-DTDPo-TE and PBDB-T guarantees efficient charge transportation. In addition, good miscibility and interpenetrated fibrils have been observed in the Ph-DTDPo-TE:PBDB-T blend by both the surficial and in-depth morphology characterization experiments. Consequently, a PCE of 12.21% (Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 20.83 mA cm−2 and FF = 71.14%) is achieved by Ph-DTDPo-TE, which is one of the highest values for binary OSCs based on acceptors comprising pyran units. Such excellent photovoltaic performance demonstrates that side chain engineering at the thiophene π-bridge is an effective strategy to regulate molecular orientations and the blend morphology in pyran based FREAs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes of these three acceptors Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE are shown in Scheme 1. The starting materials Ph-DP-1 and 2 were obtained in good yields according to our previously reported procedures.29,38,44 Then, the dialdehyde intermediates 3a, 3b and 3c were synthesized via the Suzuki cross-coupling of boronic esters (Ph-DP-1) with compounds 2a, 2b and 2c in yields of 73%, 66% and 71%, respectively. Through the final end-capping reaction with the 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malono-nitrile (4), the aimed molecules Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE were synthesized in yields of 71%, 76% and 82%, respectively. The chemical structures of Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE were confirmed by 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. These three acceptors all exhibit good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of these three acceptors Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE in dilute chloroform solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and related parameters are summarized in Table 1. The three acceptors display similar absorption curves in solutions from 350 to 800 nm with maximum absorption peaks located at 695, 715 and 726 nm, respectively. Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE display slightly blue-shifted absorption behavior compared with Ph-DTDPo-TE, which may be attributed to the electron deficient characteristics of the oxygen atoms at the π-spacers in these two acceptors. In going from solutions to thin films, all molecules present broad and red-shifted spectra with absorption onsets at approximately 850 nm, which can be attributed to the formation of J-aggregation in the solid state. The planar conformation of two terminals is reinforced by the O⋯H interaction in Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE, which is beneficial to forming intermolecular aggregations, so the thin films of these two acceptors present intense absorption peaks in the long wavelength region. The optical bandgaps of Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE are estimated to be 1.46, 1.46 and 1.43 eV, respectively, according to the equation: Eg,opt = 1240/λonset.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels could provide the preliminary judgment of the compatibility of the donor and acceptor. So, these parameters of these three acceptors are determined by cyclic voltammetry according to the following equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e[(Eox/red − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8] (eV). The results are listed in Table 1 and the schematic energy diagram is shown Fig. 1c. It's clear that the side chains at the π-bridges would slightly influence the energy levels and the LUMO levels are all around −3.9 eV for these three acceptors, which would offer enough driving force (∼0.5 eV) for charge dissociation when blended with the donor PBDB-T.
In the meantime, photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments are carried out for the pre-assessment of the energy level compatibility and charge transfer efficiency between the donor and acceptor in blend films. As shown in Fig. 1d, PL quenching efficiencies of 79.8%, 85.7% and 97.3% are observed for blend films based on PBDB-T with Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, respectively, demonstrating varied charge separation behaviors at the donor/acceptor interface.28,45,46 The poor PL quenching efficiency of the PBDB-T:Ph-DTDPo-OT blend might be ascribed to its lager domain size (vide infra). The branched side chain (ethylhexyloxy or ethylhexyl) substitution at the spacer unit can enhance the solubility of acceptors and solve this problem.44
Photovoltaic properties
OSC devices with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (8.5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) are fabricated to evaluate their photovoltaic performance, in which a widely used polymer donor PBDB-T is employed. Herein, we have systematically evaluated the impacts of blend solution concentrations, donor/acceptor ratios, spin-coating rates, solvent additives, and post-treatment conditions during the device evaluation process. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2, the optimized weight ratio of donor/acceptors is 1:1 for all the three blend systems, and slightly varied additive dosages of 1-CN are adopted. Generally, the replacement of hexyloxy chain with ethylhexyl or ethylhexyloxy chains could significantly improve the Jsc and FF for Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, which may be ascribed to the enhanced solubility and improved film morphology. In addition, the smaller offset between the LUMO of Ph-DTDPo-TE and the HOMO of PBDB-T produces a relative low Voc value of 0.82 V. However, the broadened absorption spectra and the high PL quenching efficiency for Ph-DTDPo-TE together contribute to the enhanced Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2 and FF of 71.14% as expected. All the combined parameters finally achieve a high PCE of 12.21%, which is among the highest photovoltaic performance rank of the pyran based FREAs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterization is applied to the device measurement. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQE curves of the devices based on Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE show broad photo-responses ranging from 300 to 850 nm; whereas the spectral coverage of Ph-DTDPo-TE/PBDB-T was extended to 870 nm with an enhanced intensity of 80%. In addition, all the Jsc values are corrected by integrating the EQE curves, which are within 5% mismatch from the corresponding results of the J–V measurements.

The non-radiative recombination losses (ΔEnonrad) would directly influence the Voc values in OSCs. Herein, the external quantum efficiencies of electroluminescence (EQEEL) of the OSC devices are employed to evaluate the ΔEnonrad for the three acceptors. As shown in Fig. S1,† EQEEL of 9.21 × 10−4, 4.81 × 10−3 and 8.23 × 10−4% are obtained for the devices based on Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, respectively. According to the equation: ΔEnonrad = −kTln(EQEEL) (k, Boltzmann constant; T, temperature), their corresponding ΔEnonrad can be calculated to be 0.289, 0.249 and 0.293 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the energy level analysis and the measured Voc. The large non-radiative recombination losses for Ph-DTDPo-TE can also well explain its low Voc.47–49
To further investigated the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes of these dipyran acceptor based devices, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves are measured and shown in Fig. 2c. Jph is estimated according to the equation of Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current densities under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark, respectively. Veff could be calculated from Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when JL = JD and V is the applied voltage. It's clear that all devices could reach the saturated current density (Jsat) when Veff is close to 1 V as shown in Fig. 2c, indicating sufficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, which can be further evaluated by the exciton dissociation probability (Jph/Jsat) under short-circuit conditions. The Jph/Jsat ratios of the optimal devices are calculated to be 93.0%, 94.8% and 96.3% for Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, respectively. Such high values for the latter two acceptors suggest effective exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interfaces and effective charge collection by the electrode, which would result in enhanced Jsc and FF. Subsequently, the charge carrier recombination mechanisms for the blend film of the three acceptors are investigated from the relationships between the current density under different light intensities (Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is exponential factor). The value of α could provide information about the bimolecular recombination, which can be neglected in devices if the value is close to 1. From the data in Fig. 2d, α values are calculated to be 0.93, 0.95 and 0.97 for devices based on Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, respectively. The results also well explain the high FF value for the Ph-DTDPo-TE based devices, since the bimolecular recombination process can be effectively suppressed.
SCLC charge transport mobilities
To further understand the side chain effect on the photovoltaic performance, charge carrier mobilities of blend films are measured with the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method. Hole mobility (μh) is measured with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au, while electron mobility (μe) adopts an architecture of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al. The J1/2–V curves are shown in Fig. S2† and the detailed mobility results are listed in Table 3. The μh are estimated to be 0.63 × 10−4, 1.31 × 10−4 and 1.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for blend films of PBDB-T with Ph-DTDPo-OT, Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, respectively; and the corresponding μe values are determined to be 0.94 × 10−5, 4.13 × 10−5 and 1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It can be seen that the Ph-DTDPo-TE blend film displays high hole and electron mobility, which is mainly due to its face-on orientation and improved morphology (vide infra). Moreover, high and balanced charge carrier mobilities of Ph-DTDPo-TE based devices well account for their high FF from the point of charge transportation.

GIWAXS characterization
The GIWAXS characterization is employed to study the crystallinity properties and molecular orientations of these dipyran based acceptors and the microcrystalline part of conjugated polymer backbones. As shown in Fig. 3, the neat films of Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE display predominantly edge-on orientations. Quite distinct (100) lamellar diffraction peaks at 0.32 Å−1 (dspacing = 19.44 Å) and 0.31 Å−1 (dspacing = 19.88 Å) are detected in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction for Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE, respectively. In addition, both molecules demonstrate more intimate intermolecular stacking owing to the smaller (010) π–π stacking distances (3.53 Å for Ph-DTDPo-OT and 3.55 Å for Ph-DTDPo-OTE) at the in-plane (IP) direction and more ordered lamellar diffractions. It's clear that the branched side chain in Ph-DTDPo-OTE could slightly reduce the intermolecular interaction without interference to the molecular orientations. However, it's surprising that Ph-DTDPo-TE displays a totally different molecular orientation relative to the other two acceptors. The dominated edge-on orientations in neat Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE films turn into a face-on preferential stacking mode in the Ph-DTDPo-TE film, when the alkyloxy side chains are replaced by the ethylhexyl ones at the π-bridge. The neat Ph-DTDPo-TE exhibits a distinct (100) diffraction peak at 0.32 Å−1 (dspacing = 19.49 Å) in the IP direction and a broad (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.71 Å−1 (dspacing = 3.68 Å) in the OOP direction. Such an elongated π–π distance might be ascribed to the reduced terminal packing induced by the branched 2-ethylhexyl chains. Since PBDB-T is apt to generate face-on oriented crystals in many studies,21 it may precipitate first and partly induce the similar oriented crystallization of Ph-DTDPo-OT and Ph-DTDPo-OTE. However, a strengthened (010) π–π stacking is observed at 1.69 Å−1 in Fig. 3g due to the similar face-on crystalline orientation preference of both PBDB-T and Ph-DTDPo-TE, which also well explains the high photovoltaic performance of their blend film.

In addition, the crystal coherence length (CCL) is calculated to estimate the crystalline size for the components. With the linear chains in Ph-DTDPo-OT replaced by the branched alkyloxy ones in Ph-DTDPo-OTE, the CCL is reduced from 21.78 to 21.07 Å for the (010) peak and from 98.47 to 85.12 Å for the (100) peak. When ethylhexyl chains are adopted in Ph-DTDPo-TE, the CCL values are further decreased to 13.43 and 47.26 Å for the (010) and (100) peaks, respectively. All the observations well agree with the above discussion that the branched side chain at the π-spacer is an effective method to tune the crystallization behavior of the acceptors.
Morphological properties of blend films
Herein, the surface and internal morphologies of blend films are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 4a, the PBDB-T:Ph-DTDPo-OT blend film shows a quite rough surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness value of 3.35 nm. With the two hexyloxy side chains replaced by the two branched 2-ethylhexyloxy groups, the miscibility of the PBDB-T and Ph-DTDPo-OTE is increased and a reduced RMS of 2.25 nm is observed. In the case of the 2-ethylhexyl substituent, PBDB-T:Ph-DTDPo-TE blend film exhibits an even smoother surface morphology with a RMS value of 1.71 nm. From the TEM images, we can see that distinct fibrils are formed in the PBDB-T:Ph-DTDPo-TE blend film. This is probably due to the good solubility of Ph-DTDPo-TE, which allows PBDB-T to precipitate first and form nanofibrils before the precipitation of Ph-DTDPo-TE. Such an improved morphology could facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport and further contribute to the high PCE.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two new A–π–D–π–A FREAs Ph-DTDPo-OTE and Ph-DTDPo-TE, which carry different side chains at the outer position of the π bridge, are designed and synthesized. These two acceptors possess a uniform planar conformation due to the steric confinement of side chains. 2-Ethylhexyloxy substituted Ph-DTDPo-OTE possesses good solubility and forms an appropriate morphology but undesired edge-on orientation in the blend film. As for the 2-ethylhexyl substituted Ph-DTDPo-TE, it displays the desired face-on oriented molecular packing, and its blend films with PBDB-T show a smooth surface morphology with fibrillary interpenetrating networks. Finally, a PBDB-T:Ph-DTDPo-TE based device produce a PCE of 12.21% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.14%, which is one of the highest values for binary OSCs comprising dipyran based acceptors. In all, our research demonstrates that appropriate side chain engineering at the π-bridge of small molecular acceptors is an effective strategy to regulate molecular orientations and the morphology of active layers.
