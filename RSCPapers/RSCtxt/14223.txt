1. Introduction
As global energy consumption and concerns over environmental contamination continue to increase, it is imperative to develop renewable energy resources.1,2 Hydrogen (H2) is considered a candidate to replace conventional fossil fuels since it exhibits a high value of gravimetric energy compared to gasoline (i.e., 120 MJ kg−1versus 44 MJ kg−1) sustainable energy.3,4 One of the attractive options to produce H2 is water splitting, which is splitting water into oxygen (O2) and H2. Among the several technologies for practical water splitting, here, we address three applications, including photocatalytic (PC),5,6 photoelectrochemical (PEC),7–9 and electrochemical (EC)10–12 water splitting systems.
So far, various modification strategies such as nanostructuring, heterojunction ad crystal phase, and facet control have been developed to enhance the water splitting performance.4–12 Among them, crystal facet and phase engineering have been intensively studied because both strategies could tune the arrangement of surface free energy, the surface vacancies, the formation of hetero/homojunction, the effective mass of hole/electrons, and the loading of co-catalyst sites, thus affecting the key factors such as electronic band structure, and charge transfer and separation to concluding the water splitting efficiencies.
Some perspective papers have considered crystal facet/phase engineering for water splitting reaction, but comprehensive review focusing on the unique properties, preparation, and modification of crystal facet/phase engineered (photo)electrocatalysts for several water splitting is still lacking. Considering the increasing interest in crystal facet/phase engineered (photo)electrocatalysts for water splitting, providing a timely overview of the recent progress and outlooks of future directions in these fields is essential.
This review aims to highlight recent state-of-art progress of crystal facet/phase-engineered catalysts for three types of water splitting systems. First, we cover the overall principles and mechanism for three types of water splitting systems. And the advantages of facet and phase engineering, particularly modifying the intrinsic properties of catalysts and construction of the junctions, are addressed. Furthermore, we introduce research trends for water splitting systems with the categorized facet and phase engineering.
2. Principles and key factors of water splitting
Water splitting into H2 and O2 molecules is an energetically uphill reaction requiring a potential of 1.23 eV per electron. Two electrons are needed to produce a H2 molecule and four holes to produce an O2 molecule according to eqn (1) and (2):2,13,14 Water oxidation (OER): 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+(1) Proton reduction (HER): 2H + 2e− → H2(2)Overall water splitting: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2, ΔG° = 237.2 kJ mol−1
In a particulate PC system, the photocatalyst powders are dispersed in the reactor (Fig. 1a), and thus charge transfer pathway is significantly shorter (several micrometers) than usual charge collectors in the other systems (sometimes tens of meters).15,16 The PC water splitting reaction involves three steps (Fig. 1b): (i) absorption of photons, leading to the generation of electron and hole pairs in the semiconductor particles; (ii) charge separation followed by migration of these photogenerated carriers in the semiconductor particles; (iii) surface chemical reactions between these carriers with water.17 And photoactivities are expressed in H2 and O2 evolution, as shown in Fig. 1c. At the first step of photocatalysis, the maximum efficiency of a given water splitting system is determined.14 However, in practice, the efficiency of such systems is lower than the theoretical value as a result of charge recombination and the complicated and sluggish H2 and O2 evolution reactions, as well as the reverse reaction.15,18–20

The PEC water splitting system is consisted of two electrodes to produce O2 (n-type semiconductor, anode) and H2 (p-type semiconductor, cathode), as shown in Fig. 1d.3,14,16 As shown in Fig. 1e, it proceeds stepwise: (i) light-induced generation of electron–hole pairs that induce the photocurrents of n-type semiconductor material as a photoanode, resulting in the formation of electronic charge carriers (excited electrons and holes); (ii) oxidation of water at the photoanode by holes; (iii) transport of H+ ions from the photoanode to the photocathode through the electrolyte, and electron transport through the external circuit to the photocathode; (iv) reduction of hydrogen ions at the photocathode by the electrons.14 The general experimental method to evaluate the performance of PEC cells is measuring the photocurrent density and onset potential, as shown in Fig. 1f.
To drive the OER and HER in the EC water splitting cell, the minimum theoretical voltage requirement is 1.23 V (Fig. 1g).2 However, additional energy, named activation energy, is required to make the reactions proceed at appreciable rates.21,22 This additional energy manifests as a requirement for potential bias above the 1.23 V minimum. And overpotential (η) describes how much additional voltage must be applied to obtain a given current density (Fig. 1h). Consequently, developing high-active electrocatalysts to reduce the kinetic overpotential for the HER and the OER is the key to efficient water splitting, as shown in Fig. 1i.
3. Advantages of facet and phase engineering for water splitting
Strategies to expose specific facets to the surface of the (photo)electrode material can control the water splitting performances. This facet engineering is described by the Gibbs–Wulff theorem, which deals with selective nucleation and growth along with the crystal facets.23 Generally, the facet with high surface energy grows rapidly and disappears, while the facet with low energy remains stable. The essence of facet engineering is to expose certain facets by controlling the growth rate of facets through the optimization of additive and synthesis conditions. For example, the water oxidation reaction can be expedited by exposing the (010) facets with a high rate of hole transport, which is a rate-determining process in photoanode, as shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic of facet engineering and phase engineering on water splitting. 
Another strategy for effective water splitting is phase engineering to modify the crystal structures of the (photo)electrode materials. At normal pressure, the phase is dominantly dependent on temperature, and the stable phase can be known by the phase diagram. In general, we can control the phase depending on the temperature and time during the synthesis or annealing process, and stoichiometry of materials with multi valence elements as well as crystal structures change. Depending on the phase, surface adsorption sites of oxygen or hydrogen atoms changes, causing the difference in water splitting performances.24 In the case of titanium dioxide (TiO2), the anatase phase showed better photocatalytic properties than the rutile phase, as shown in Fig. 2.25
Such facet and phase engineering are attractive in that they can maximize the intrinsic properties of the material without other strategies such as nanostructure, doping, and electrolyte. Due to different atomic arrangements depending on the crystal facets, anisotropic physical properties are exhibited.26 In EC water splitting, the difference in electrical conductivity or surface molecular adsorption by the crystal facet determines the lower overpotential.27 Also, since the band edge positions and diffusion path change in the semiconductor with different facets, the PC or PEC performances can be improved by enhancing charge transport.28,29 Since the stable phase depends on the reaction potential and pH according to the Pourbaix diagram, phase engineering can increase both water splitting activity and stability.30,31 Also, in the semiconductor, the light-harvesting ability can be maximized by optimizing the annealing conditions to obtain a lower band gap phase.32,33 There are also cases in which a photoelectrode material is divided into n-type and p-type semiconductor characteristics depending on the phase.34,35 In other words, phase engineering is used to synthesize bifunctional materials that can be applied to the counter-reaction as well.
The second advantage of facet and phase engineering is that it creates synergistic effects when forming homojunction or heterojunction with existing materials. In the point of surface morphology, a more complex 3-dimensional structure maximizing the specific surface area is made by combining two materials with different structures depending on facet or phase.36,37 Also, in semiconductors, many studies have reported the formation of type II heterojunction by modifying the band structures by the facet or phase control in existing materials.38,39 As shown in Fig. 2, the separation of electrons and holes is improved at the interfaces in cascade band alignment. In electrochemical water splitting, certain steps of OER and HER occur dominantly at the nanointerfaces of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. By increasing these nanointerfaces of composites through phase engineering, the overpotential can be effectively reduced.40 The heterojunction based on phase engineering is also used to prevent photocorrosion and surface recombination of existing photoelectrode materials. With only facile heat treatment, the surface of unstable photoelectrode materials such as hematite (α-Fe2O3), tantalum nitride (Ta3N5), and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) can be transformed into corrosion resistive phases.41–43
4. Trends of facet and phase engineering for water splitting systems
4.1. PC water splitting

4.1.1. Facet engineering. 
Various crystal facets have diverse electronic structures (related to the thermodynamic behaviors of reactions) and surface reactive properties (related to the adsorption and bonding of chemical reactants) as a result of the different atom configurations; thus, elaborate facet engineering can significantly enhance the photocatalytic properties.6,44 Specifically, for overall PC water splitting, the spatial separation of reduction and oxidation reaction sites on the different facets of a semiconductor is a promising route due to efficient charge carrier separation.
TiO2, which is one of the well-known photocatalysts, shows distinct photocatalytic activities according to the different exposed facets (such as {001}, {010}, or {101}).45–47 Generally, exposed facets can be modified by selectively controlling the nucleation and growth rates in different directions during the growth of the crystals.45 Fu et al. controlled the aspect ratios of rutile TiO2 nanorods (NRs) with prism-shape via hydrothermal, as shown in Fig. 3a1.48 Rutile TiO2 NRs with middle/large aspect ratios were prepared by two-step synthesis unlike small aspect ratio of TiO2 NRs. The formation of NRs with middle/large aspect ratios depended on the different TiO2 crystal seeds formed in the first step. They calculated the percentage of exposed (110) and (111) facets, and the portion of (110) was increased up to 96% at a large aspect of TiO2 NRs. The gas evolution rates increased with a decrease in the aspect ratio of the rutile TiO2 NRs (Fig. 3a2). This result is well-matched with previous studies that (110) and (111) facets of rutile TiO2 are considered to be the reduction and oxidation facets, respectively.45,46,49 Generally, the OER has been known to be the bottleneck in the PC water splitting, and thus the high portion of oxidative (111) facets can lead to enhanced photocatalytic reactivity.

Most of the experimental studies monitored the photoactivities by different morphologies or through indirect characterizations, such as the formation of Pt (Pt4+ → Pt0; reductive) or PbO2 (Pb2+ → Pb4+, oxidative) nanoparticles on different TiO2 facets.50,51 To directly demonstrate the discrepancy of photocatalytic activity on facets, Yin et al. established in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM) setup (Fig. 3b1).52 The authors observed facet-dependent gas bubble generation in real-time and revealed {110} facet surface, which is ascribed to pseudo-photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. As shown in Fig. 3b2, bubbles are predominantly formed adjacent to the {110} side facets of the TiO2 NRs.
Besides, numerous efforts have been devoted to achieving high separation efficiency of TiO2 for imperative PC water splitting. Among the several strategies, tuning the junction structure is also a rational strategy to suppress charge recombination in semiconductors, such as heterojunctions.6,53 Gao et al. introduced the facet heterojunction (FH) strategy to facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs in rutile TiO2.54 From the first principle calculations on electronic band structures of rutile TiO2 nanosheets, the band structure of FH was verified, as shown in Fig. 3c1. Type II band alignment in the (100)/(101) FH could facilitate the charge separation. And the transport routes of electrons were mainly toward the (111) facet of the 2D nanosheet, which was the main surface site for H2 evolution from water, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c2. To demonstrate their strategy, 3D rutile TiO2 photocatalysts with ultrathin and highly crystalline TiO2 nanosheets uniformly coated on TiO2 NRs were constructed, as shown in Fig. 3c2. Photoluminescence (PL) measurement and time-resolved PL demonstrated the improved charge carrier separation and lifetimes of FH-TiO2. Furthermore, FH-TiO2 exhibited the highest H2 production rate (1.441 mmol g−1 h−1).
Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), which is another promising photocatalyst, has been studied due to its proper valence and narrow bandgap (ca. 2.4 eV) for visible light absorption.6 Recently, some investigations have demonstrated that photoreduction and oxidation can occur preferentially at different facets of BiVO4-based photocatalysts, due to the distribution of photogenerated charge carriers. Lardhi et al. investigated the impact of the four predominant (010), (110), (001), and (121) exposed facets obtained experimentally for monoclinic BiVO4 photocatalyst on its performance for water splitting reactions.55 From the hybrid density functional theory (DFT), including the spin–orbit coupling, they revealed the particular role of each facet in proton reduction was correlated with the surface Bi coordination number and their geometrical distribution. Although the electronic structure is similar for these four surfaces, their redox and transport properties revealed an anisotropic nature based on the crystal orientation and termination. The particular role of each facet in proton reduction was correlated with the surface Bi coordination number and their geometrical distribution. After combining the charge carrier transport and redox characteristics for each surface, they predicted the (001) facet as the only appropriate candidate for both HER and OER, while the (010) facet is a good candidate only for OER. The (110) and (121) facets were classified as acceptable candidates only for OER but with less potential than (001) and (010), as shown in Fig. 3d. These outcomes open up proper direction toward a careful design of facet-oriented BiVO4 samples for improved photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions.
Furthermore, various experimental studies have been processed to reveal the effect of facet-dependent BiVO4 on PC water splitting. Li et al. provided experimental evidence for the separation of electrons and holes between the {010} and {110} crystal facets of BiVO4 by using photochemical labeling.56 It was found that Ag, Au, and Pt were all solely reduced on the {010} facets, while MnOx and PbO2 were oxidized on the {110} facets (Fig. 3e). These results indicated that the photogenerated electrons and holes tend to accumulate on the {010} and {110} facets, respectively, leading to the reduction and oxidation reactions taking place on the {010} and {110} facets. They also found that the photocatalytic performance can be most greatly enhanced when the reduction/oxidation cocatalysts were selectively deposited on the corresponding reduction/oxidation reaction facets.57 In addition, Zhu et al. introduced spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy to obtain direct evidence of highly anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on different facets of a single BiVO4 photocatalyst.58 Highly anisotropic photo-induced hole distribution was observed in single BiVO4 crystals with preferentially exposed {010} facets, and the surface photovoltage signal intensity on the {011} facet was 70 times stronger than that on the {010} facet. Based on these analyses, they demonstrated the influence of the built-in electric field in the space charge region of different facets on the anisotropic photo-induced charge transfer in a single semiconductor crystal.
Even though great efforts have been devoted to improving photocatalytic activities of BiVO4, the industrial application is heavily limited by the very moderate efficiency mainly caused by the fast recombination of photo-induced charge carriers.59 Thus, besides the strategy of faceted photocatalysts, which can form an internal electric field and suppress charge recombination in crystal bulk, the other strategy of a heterostructure, in particular a Z-scheme, has also been proved successful in the separation of charge carriers for surface reaction.60–62 Wei et al. introduced Vo-ZnO/BiVO4 heterostructures with tailored facet orientation (i.e., forming double built-in electric fields) and modulated oxygen vacancies (i.e., may generate a Z-scheme potential).63 Based on the modeling and spectroscopy results, the authors proposed the underlying mechanism of facet engineered photocatalysts for water oxidation (Fig. 3f). Compared to BiVO4, ZnO possesses more negative CB and VB positions. Thus, upon visible light irradiation, electrons in the VB of BiVO4 could be excited to the CB level, while only defect excitation could be achieved for ZnO. According to the DFT, simulation and experimental validation, the energy band offset between {010} and {110} facets generated an internal electric field in faceted BiVO4. This spontaneous field potential provided a preliminary driving force for the transfer and separation of charge carriers from bulk to different surfaces after excitation, with electrons accumulated on the {010} facets and holes on the {110} facets in BiVO4. When ZnO NRs were perpendicularly assembled onto BiVO4, an additional build-in field formed in defective ZnO NRs, pushing electrons moving to the bottom of the rods and holes to the lateral sides. At the interfaces between hole-dominated {110} of BiVO4 and electron-accumulated ZnO NRs, partial photo-induced holes in {110} of BiVO4 and electrons in the ends of ZnO NRs may recombine, which was analogous to a Z-scheme mechanism. And this mechanism was supported by TRPL measurement and Kelvin probe force microscopy.
Furthermore, to obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths, and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency of overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten 10%. Taketa et al. demonstrated overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96% using the aluminum-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst.64,65 It was accomplished by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively via the photodeposition method. As illustrated in Fig. 3g, the Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst was preferentially deposited on the {100} crystal facet. On the other hand, CoOOH cocatalyst was primarily located in the 〈110〉 direction. From the simulation, they showed the electronic energy gradient and charge distribution in a semiconductor particle with a work function difference between the {110} and {100} surfaces. The Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst was reductively photodeposited on electron-attracting {100} facets and subsequently mediated electron transfer from the semiconductor to protons. Similarly, the CoOOH cocatalyst was oxidatively photodeposited on the hole-collecting {110} facets and neighboring facets and mediated hole transfer. These phenomena were central to obtaining consecutive charge transfers with minimum charge recombination for the studied cocatalyst/photocatalyst system.65
As a class of typical layered materials composed of [Bi2O2] units interleaved with double halide atom slabs, bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Br, Cl, I) have been acting as promising candidates in photocatalysis.66–69 Most importantly, the surface atom coordination of bismuth oxyhalides can be manipulated by tuning the configuration between [Bi2O2] units and halide atoms, resulting in the formation of distinct crystal facets and consequently leading to different photocatalytic performances.70 Scott et al. found that BiOBr with dominant exposed (010) facets exhibits much better photocatalytic activity for water oxidation compared with BiOBr with highly exposed (001) facets.71 A similar result was described by Hou et al., showing that BiOBr with (010) facets exhibited higher photocatalytic degradation activity than BiOBr with (001) facets under visible light illumination.72 However, a contradicted conclusion was drawn by Wong et al., showing that BiOBr with dominant (001) facets behaviors had remarkably higher photocatalytic activity than that with (010) facets.73 Furthermore, it was also reported that BiOBr with dominant (102) facets displayed higher photocatalytic degradation performance than BiOBr with (001) facets.73 Shi et al. also exemplified well-defined BiOBr nanosheets dominating with respective facets, (001) and (010), to track the reactivity of crystal facets for PC water splitting.69 The authors experimentally clarified that BiOBr-(001) has higher photocatalytic activity than BiOBr-(010) for H2 production and O2-evolving reaction (Fig. 4a1). Further, in situ photochemical probing studies verified that distinct reactivity is due to the highly exposed facets and dominated by the co-exposing facets, leading to efficient spatial separation of photogenerated charges. The spatial charge separation between different facets renders the reduction and oxidation reactions on the dominant facets separately. The co-exposing facets with different reaction rates ordain the fate of the true photoreactivity for BiOBr nanosheets. The photoreactivity is intrinsically the consequence of the balance between reduction and oxidation reactions of different exposed facets. Also, they further analyzed the band structure and electrostatic potential by DFT. Schematic illustration of photogenerated charges separation caused by surface band bending and built-in electric field of BiOBr-(010) with (010) and (102) facets are shown in Fig. 4a2. According to the difference in Fermi levels (EF) of different crystal facets, the built-in electric field strength of BiOBr-(001) was greater than that of BiOBr-(010), which may be an important reason why BiOBr-(001) has a more efficient photogenerated charges separation than BiOBr-(010).

BiOCl, which is another photocatalyst with a unique layered structure, is also considered for facet-dependent PC water splitting.74,75 Zhao et al. promoted the charge separation efficiency by the construction of facet junction with {110} and {001}, also revealed that rich {110} facet BiOCl led to high photocatalytic activities. Zhang et al. also demonstrated that the formation of {010}/{100} facet junction in BiOIO3 nanoplates allows the photogenerated e− and h+ to separate spatially.76 In the same group, BiOCl crystals with multi high-index facets were developed further to enhance the charge separation efficiency and catalytic activity.77 They prepared eighteen-faceted BiOCl composed of {001} top facets and {102} and {112} oblique facets via hydrothermal methods. Compared to conventional BiOCl square plates with exposed {001} top facets and {110} lateral facets, it showed strengthened photocatalytic performance for the production of H2 and OH since the {001}/{102}/{112} ternary facet junction induced the cascade charge flow and leaded to much higher charge separation and transfer efficiencies (Fig. 4b).
Cu2O has been widely studied as a photocatalyst for H2 production because it has a direct bandgap structure, a small band gap energy (2.0–2.2 eV), and a high adsorption spectrum.78,79 Kwon et al. introduced Cu2O particles of three different shapes with distinct surface structures; cube with (100) facets, octahedra with (111) facets, and rhombic dodecahedra with (110) facets, as shown in Fig. 4c1.78 Under water splitting reaction, the rhombic dodecahedra with (110) facets showed highest H2 production, whereas the cubes produced none (Fig. 4c2). O2 was not detected because Cu2O easily undergoes oxidation to CuO with degraded stability. To overcome the stability issue, TiIrOx overlayer conformally coated on the rhombic dodecahedral Cu2O particles, and it presented stable overall water splitting producing both H2 and O2. Also, significantly improved stability over repeated water splitting reactions was achieved compared to pristine Cu2O. The distinct photocatalytic difference of facet-dependent Cu2O was also studied by Huang et al.80 The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements indicated a higher production of hydroxyl radicals for the photo-irradiated Cu2O rhombic dodecahedra than for the octahedra, but no radicals were produced from photo-irradiated Cu2O cubes. The Cu2O {100} face may present a high energy barrier through its large band edge bending or electrostatic repulsion, preventing charge carriers from reaching this surface. Wei et al. presented another strategy, which was to modulate the exposed facets and structural defects of TiO2 to stabilize Cu2O-based photocatalyst.81 {101}-faceted TiO2 could create conducting channels for denoting electrons to Cu2O, mimicking the Z-scheme charge transfer in natural photosynthesis (Fig. 4d1). Due to the defect-enhanced charge separation and the effective scavenging of oxidative holes in Cu2O, Cu2O/TiO2 heterostructures with exposed {101} facets and oxygen vacancies exhibited 251-fold increased activity for solar water splitting, together with unpredicted photo-stability. In contrast, defect-induced isolated states in the bulk of {001}-faceted TiO2 led to the formation of type II Cu2O/TiO2 junction with moderate photoactivity and poor stability (Fig. 4d2). Here, they demonstrated the effect of the Z-scheme, exceeding that of type II heterojunction.
Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is a good choice to study facet effects for facile PC water splitting. It has a perovskite crystal structure with an indirect bandgap of 3.25 eV and a direct bandgap of 3.75 eV. Its band energy positions are similar to those of TiO2, so photocatalytic water splitting is possible.82 Mu et al. introduced a morphology tailoring strategy, which controlled exposed facets of high symmetry SrTiO3 nanocrystals from isotropic facets (6-facet SrTiO3) to anisotropic facets (18-facet SrTiO3), as shown in Fig. 4e.83 It led that the reduction and oxidation sites could be separately distributed only on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals but randomly distributed on every facet of 6-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals. Based on these findings, the selective distribution of dual-cocatalysts on the anisotropic facets of 18-facet SrTiO3 nanocrystals led to a 5-fold enhancement of apparent quantum efficiency.
Besides inorganic photocatalysts, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has also attracted great interest in photocatalytic overall water splitting.84,85 Several studies on PCN suggested that 2D planes of PCN were reactive facets due to the highly exposed surface areas and the suitable coordination environment for the incorporation of co-catalyst.86 Lin et al. developed PTI/Li+Cl− with Pt/Co as co-catalysts.87 Strikingly, all those experiments demonstrated that the prismatic side planes {100} were the major reactive facets, different from conventional wisdom on PCN nanosheets (Fig. 4f). They confirmed that the prismatic surfaces were the primary reactive facets because of two factors: the photogenerated electron–hole pairs could easily migrate along with the conjugated layers to the {100} facets, and the co-catalysts were mostly photodeposited on the {100} facets due to the more-available electrons or holes on the prismatic surfaces. The results showed that increasing the prismatic surface areas (reactive facets) can greatly enhance the performance of PTI/Li+Cl− in the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.


4.1.2. Phase engineering. 
TiO2 is classified into three crystalline phases: anatase, rutile, and brookite, according to the crystal structure (Fig. 5a1).88 Unlike brookite, a metastable phase binding to asymmetric oxygen atoms, anatase and rutile phases have been used as photoanode materials. The rutile phase has a lower band gap of 3.0 eV than the anatase phase (3.2 eV), and anatase TiO2 generally has more effective photocatalytic properties than rutile TiO2.25 Li et al. reported different tendencies of TiO2-based photocatalysts with different phases for PC overall water splitting.89 Rutile phase TiO2 showed stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric H2/O2 ratio. Unlike the rutile phase, anatase and brookite TiO2 can only produce H2 at the initial stage, but H2 and O2 were obtained simultaneously after a long time of irradiation (Fig. 5a2). From DFT calculation, EPR, and transient infrared absorption–excitation energy scanning spectroscopy (TRIRA-ESS), the authors revealed that PC overall water splitting performance on different phases was determined by kinetics and thermodynamics. Kinetically the process of photocatalysis differs in different phases of TiO2 due to the intermediates (*OH radical for anatase and brookite TiO2, peroxy species for rutile TiO2) that are formed. In addition, many trapped states are thermodynamically near the VB of anatase and brookite TiO2, which reduces the overpotential for water oxidation. These trapped states can be gradually removed by the irradiation of high-intensity UV light such that the PC overall water splitting reaction can finally take place. Zhang et al. rationally designed and tuned the built-in electric field of anatase/rutile TiO2 phase junction via fabricating controllable interfacial contact areas between two crystalline phases (Fig. 5b1).90 The experimental results indicated that photocatalytic activity strongly depended on the interfacial contact area between anatase and rutile TiO2. Increasing the interfacial contact area enhanced the driving force for spatial charge separation, allowing more electrons and holes to migrate to the surface and participate in redox reactions, but further increasing the interfacial contact area led to the decline of photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5b2). The optimized interface enabled the strength of the built-in electric field for favorable separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes.

As discussed in the previous section, scheelite monoclinic (m) BiVO4 is a well-documented photocatalyst having a suitable band gap energy (2.4 eV) for absorbing visible light.91 However, its conduction band is located at a more positive potential than the potential of water reduction, which is incapable of evolving H2.92 To drive overall water splitting under visible light irradiation, Jo et al. designed In/Mo dual doped-greenish BiVO4 (GBVOx).93 As shown in Fig. 5c, GBVOx splits water into H2 and O2 by one-step photoexcitation because it has an upshifted conduction band minimum. The DFT calculation supported that In3+/Mo6+ dual doping triggered partial phase transformation from pure m-BiVO4 to a mixture of m-BiVO4 and tetragonal BiVO4 (t-BiVO4), which sequentially led to unit cell volume growth, compressive lattice strain increase and conduction band edge uplift, thus it could produce both H2 and O2.
Black phosphorus (BP), which is an emerging 2D material, has shown great attention in PC solar energy conversion owing to its anisotropic layered structure, layer-dependent direct band gap, and superior carrier migration characteristics.94 However, rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers has degraded its photoactivities. The construction of heterojunction has been considered a solution to overcome this drawback.95,96 Liu et al. introduced in situ generated BP/RP hetero-phase junction photocatalysts to construct a direct Z-scheme system, as shown in Fig. 5d1. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of RP could readily recombine with the photogenerated holes in the VB of BP at the hetero-phase junction interface. As a result, the strong reducibility of electrons in the CB of BP and oxidizability of holes in the VB of RP were retained to drive redox reactions; thus, the photocatalytic activity of BP/RP hetero-phase junction has higher H2 production activity (0.33 mmol g−1 h−1) than pristine BP and RP under pure water condition (Fig. 5d2).97
The polymorphic molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) typically has the trigonal prismatic phase (semiconducting 2H-phase), octahedral phase (metallic 1T-phase), and distorted 1T-phase (semi-metallic 1T′-phase).98–100 Guo et al. demonstrated phase-/defect-engineered MoS2@TiO2 catalysts for plasmonic solar water splitting.101 The phase transition from 2H- to 1T-MoS2 induced by the hydrothermal treatment coupled with the surface vacancies (VS) was responsible for the enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance, leading to a superior H2 yield rate of 308 μmol h−1 cm−2, which was superior to the state-of-the-art plasmonic catalysts. Experimental studies revealed that the content of the 1T-MoS2 phase and the concentration of VS play crucial roles in improving the solar H2 evolution. (Fig. 5e).

4.2. PEC water splitting

4.2.1. Facet engineering. 
Since Fujishima and Honda discovered the photoelectrochemical system in 1972, TiO2 has been tremendously studied as a representative photoanode material.102 Defect engineering and heterojunction to enhance light harvesting of TiO2 with a large band gap of 3.2 eV have been mainly used.103,104 In addition, since TiO2 can be easily synthesized by the hydrothermal method that can make excellent crystallinity, many efforts have been made to control the crystal facet with high photoactivity.105–107 As shown in Fig. 6a, Kim et al. synthesized (101) facet-exposed TiO2 (TO101, bi-pyramidal shape), (100) facet-exposed TiO2 (TO100, rectangular shape), and (001) facet-exposed TiO2 (TO001, plate shape) by differentiating the HF solution concentrations and hydrothermal times.108 After fabrication of facet-controlled photoanodes, TO101 showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.13 mA cm−2 at 0.65 V versus the Ag/AgCl electrode, which improved 1.9 and 6.5 times compared to TO100 and TO001, respectively. This result originated from a higher electrical conductivity, interfacial resistance, and charge diffusivity of the (101) facet along the c-axis. Also, there are studies about the optimal ratio between multiple facets in TiO2 by controlling the solution concentration. Phawa et al. revealed that the increased H+ decreased crystal thickness and increase of F− transforms (101) to (010).109

Facet control of TiO2 is also utilized to fabricate heterostructure photoanodes. As shown in current density–time (J–t) curves (Fig. 6b), Lee et al. hydrothermally synthesized (001) facet dominant-TiO2 NRs and (110) facet-dominant nanoflowers (NFs) and electrodeposited BiVO4 on TiO2 NRs and NFs.110 Although TiO2 NRs show higher photoactivity than TiO2 NFs, the photocurrent of BiVO4/TiO2 NRs significantly decreases after heterojunction, while that of BiVO4/TiO2 NFs increases. This is because BiVO4 and TiO2 with (110) facets form type II band alignment, where charge separation is strengthened. Also, Yang et al. reported electrodeposited Cu2O on the (101) facets of TiO2.111 Compared to (001) facets, charge flows occurred from the (101) facets, which can give a larger driving force of hole transport to Cu2O.
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has been considered a photoanode candidate with moderate PEC performances because it has a smaller band gap of 2.7 eV compared to TiO2 and a longer hole diffusion length of 150 nm compared to BiVO4 and α-Fe2O3.9,112,113 Chemically stable WO3 has recently been spotlighted in the field of seawater splitting due to its chlorine resistance.114 Since WO3 is also mainly synthesized by the hydrothermal and solvothermal method, morphology and facet control are used to improve the PEC properties.115–117 Zheng et al. fabricated (020) facet-oriented WO3 film by using the rubbing method with hydrothermally synthesized WO3 nanoplate and converted it to (002) facet-oriented WO3 film after calcination.118 As the film was thickened, the (002) facet grew up, and the (002) facet-exposed WO3 film exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE), which was a 3.4 times enhancement of (200) facet dominant-WO3 film synthesized by spin coating. As shown in Fig. 6c, it was calculated that WO3 has high electron mobility and moderate hole mobility in the (002) facet, where the PEC performances increased as the charge recombination is suppressed.119
Based on the photoactive (002) facet, the homojunction and heterojunction were implemented. Yang et al. fabricated a homojunction photoanode with (002) facet-dominant WO3 (WO3(002)) and WO3 with multi-crystal facet (m-WO3).120 As shown in Fig. 6d1, WO3(002) has negatively shifted band positions from m-WO3, and WO3(002)/m-WO3 forms a type II homojunction. As a result, the increased charge separation caused the enhanced photocurrent density, as shown in current density–potential (J–V) Fig. 6d2. Also, Liu et al. synthesized WO3 film with different crystal facet ratios by adjusting the precursor concentrations.38 The WO3 film with the highest (002) facet ratio showed the lowest work function, resulting in the highest quasi-fermi level of BiVO4/WO3 film. Liu et al. reported seawater splitting with a facet-preferential deposition of Ag nanoparticles and ZnFe-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on the WO3 crystal film.119 As shown in Fig. 6c, ZnFe-LDHs were electrodeposited to hole-rich (002) facets to expedite OER kinetics, and Ag nanoparticles were attached to (200) facets, which have high electron mobility, to promote electron transport.
BiVO4 is one of the most promising photoanode materials due to its low band gap of 2.4 eV and suitable band edge position for OER.8 However, it also suffers from charge recombination and photocorrosion, which originated from the short charge diffusion length and sluggish OER kinetics of BiVO4.121 So, there have been many attempts to expose certain facets with few drawbacks.56,122,123 To exhibit anisotropic properties, Han et al. demonstrated the difference between (001) facet-exposed BiVO4 (p-BVO) by the laser ablation and randomly oriented BiVO4 (r-BVO) by the sol–gel method.124 As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 6e), it is confirmed that the lateral grain sizes are different. The p-BVO showed 16 times higher photoactivity than r-BVO and recorded a remarkable photocurrent density of 6.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE after Co-Pi deposition. The low electron mobility, small hole collection depth, and poor kinetics of BiVO4 were improved on the exposed (001) facets, leading to excellent intrinsic PEC properties. Based on these results, highly (001) facet-oriented BiVO4 was fabricated from epitaxial Sb doped SnO2, showing a high photoactivity.125 Also, in the theoretical study, this facet showed the lowest calculated overpotential.126
Another photoactive facet of monoclinic BiVO4 is the (040) plane since it has the lowest potential for trapping photogenerated charges.127 Kim et al. hydrothermally obtained (040) facet-engineered BiVO4 plate film, which showed superior PEC performances compared to (110) and (011) facet-dominant BiVO4.128 The (040) facet contains two unsaturated oxygen atoms and unsaturated metal atoms in the topmost layer, unlike the (001) facet with only unsaturated oxygen atoms. So, the (040) facet provides more favorable local bonding with water molecules, promoting the water oxidation kinetics. Also, to manifest anisotropic properties, (040) facet controlled-BiVO4 photoanode was synthesized by various methods such as chemical bath deposition,129 seed-assisted hydrothermal,123 and electrodeposition.130 The cocatalyst for expediting the water oxidation kinetics of BiVO4 is also deposited differently depending on the facet of BiVO4. Li et al. revealed that MnOx with high catalytic properties were selectively deposited on BiVO4 microcrystal with different facets. As shown in SEM images (Fig. 6f), MnOx was assembled on the (110) facet of BiVO4 (O-BVO) by the oxidation process and deposited on the (010) facet (R-BVO) by the reduction process. Selectively deposited MnOx cocatalyst caused the BiVO4 to form a different built-in electric field depending on the crystal facet, which was reflected in the photovoltage difference.131
In terms of light absorption, α-Fe2O3 is an ideal photoanode material because of its small band gap of 2.2 eV. However, the extremely short hole diffusion length of the few-nanometer, high density of surface states, and slow OER kinetics have been obstacles to implementing high PEC characteristics.132 There have been various approaches to expose a specific facet with higher carrier mobility in the point of crystal engineering to overcome this limitation.133,134 Grave et al. heteroepitaxially grew Nb-doped SnO2 (NTO), and then α-Fe2O3 was grown in the (001), (110), and (100) orientations on the NTO films.135 In the PEC measurement, (100) and (110) facets of α-Fe2O3 showed a low onset potential, as shown in Fig. 7a. It was found to be correlated with positive work function and negative flat band potential of (100) and (110) facets, affecting the charge transfer ability by the band structure. In the α-Fe2O3–electrolyte interfaces, the fast hole transfer in (110) facets was confirmed by the lowered charge transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis.136 Zhang et al. fabricated (110) facet-grown α-Fe2O3 mesocrystal-based photoanode.137 Based on the highly photoactive (110) facet, the photoanode yield a remarkable carrier density of ∼1020 cm−3via interfacial oxygen vacancies. Also, Kim et al. fabricated highly (110) facet-oriented worm-like α-Fe2O3 with worm-like structures, and it generated a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.32 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE with oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) modification.138 As shown in Fig. 7b, Wang et al. fabricated a homojunction photoanode of α-Fe2O3 dodecahedrons on α-Fe2O3 nanoflakes by using the self-assembly and optimized annealing.139 The (110) facet-dominant α-Fe2O3 nanoflakes acted as seeds for the growth of (112) facet-dominant Fe2O3 dodecahedrons. Based on the boosted charge transfer, the homojunction photoanode recorded a photocurrent density of 2.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE.

Ta3N5, a nitride n-type semiconductor, is one of the most promising photoanode materials for solar water splitting because of its light-absorbing capability by the small band gap of 2.1 eV. However, its relatively positive band edge position causes anodic onset potentials, and the photo-induced surface oxidation weakens stability.140–142 Also, since Ta3N5 is synthesized from TaOx by the nitridation, the substitution of oxygen for nitrogen changes the unit cell volume, forming the defects. Such defect formation makes the fabrication of single crystals and crystal facet engineering difficult. Nevertheless, Shi et al. fabricated a Ta3N5 polyhedron photoanode by covering the RbCl on the Ta2O5 precursor.143 At high temperatures, RbCl flux is ionized into Rb+ and Cl− and accelerates the growth of Ta3N5 polyhedron with (001) facets. As shown in Fig. 7c, the crystalized Ta3N5 polyhedron is confirmed in the SEM image, and the Ta3N5 crystal photoanode (Ta3N5-C) showed a much higher photocurrent than the comparative samples. Indeed, even in the first-principles calculation for band structures of tantalum (oxy)nitrides, the (001) facet was found to have the lowest band gap among low index facets.144,145 In order to maximize the light absorption and charge separation, Ta3N5 NRs are also synthesized by using glancing angle deposition and anodizing. Among them, the bottom-up synthesis method using molten salt flux is interesting in that crystal orientations of Ta3N5 are involved. Shi et al. performed the nitridation of TaOx with KI flux, and as-synthesized Ta3N5 had a nanorod shape with a preferred [001] growth orientation.146 In the same way, Hou et al. fabricated Ta3N5 NRs photoanode with (200) and (110) facets and formed a heterojunction SrTaO2N/Ta3N5 NRs by using SrCO3.147 As shown in Fig. 7d, it is confirmed that SrTaO2N with (100) facet is well-formed on Ta3N5 NRs with (200) facet. Since charge transport is active in the facet, higher charge separation efficiency was observed after the heterojunction.
Cu2O is the most representative oxide photocathode material with a small band gap of 2.1 eV and favorable band positions. Compared to other materials, crystals are easily formed through the electrodeposition and annealing process. As shown in Fig. 7e, during the synthesis process under equilibrium conditions, the crystal growth proceeds in the direction of reducing the high-energy facets.148 Also, when organic and inorganic additives are added during the process, crystals with a high energy facet dominant can be formed since adsorption to the high energy facet is inhibited. Through this mechanism, Cu2O crystals can be easily synthesized by simple solution processes.149,150 Li et al. synthesized Cu2O microcrystals photocathode with well-defined (111) facets.151 As shown in Fig. 7f, the portion of photoactive (111) facets varied according to the annealing times, and the highest photoactivity was shown at the optimal annealing time of 2 h. Also, according to various studies, (111) facet of Cu2O was found to have good photostability as well as photoactivity.152–154 In order to further improve the stability of the Cu2O photocathode, CuO is formed on the surface of Cu2O through annealing. During the surface phase transformation, the facet of Cu2O is also involved. As shown in Fig. 7g1, in the ideal case, the lattice matching between Cu2O with (111) facet and CuO with (11) facet occurs as a parallel epitaxial alignment.155 However, during the actual phase transformation, the interfaces of CuO/Cu2O heterojunction are inclined by 54.7° from the ideal direction, as shown in Fig. 7g2.
Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has emerged as a nearly ideal photocathode material because of its narrow band gap of 1.2 eV, high stability, and earth abundance.156,157 Zhou et al. synthesized [001]-oriented Sb2Se3 photocathode by the annealing control and revealed the corresponding (002) facet has the highest charge transport efficiency.158 He also revealed the crystal growth mechanism and charge transport of Sb2Se3 with different orientations.159 As shown in Fig. 7h1, the randomly-oriented nanoribbons and the nanoribbons vertically aligned to the substrate and electrolyte have a longer diffusion length and, thus, lower charge transport efficiency. In this respect, [001]-oriented Sb2Se3 is most advantageous for charge transport. As shown in the growth mechanism of [001]-oriented Sb2Se3 (Fig. 7h2), the diffusion of Se along the van der Waals gaps of the [001] direction is much faster than that of the [hk0] and [hk1] direction. In other words, since Se transport to the shortest pathway of van der Waals gaps for the fast reaction, the nanoribbons preferentially grow up to be perpendicular to the substrate. Based on this, Yang et al. synthesized a faceted Sb2Se3 photocathode and fabricated a tandem cell with a BiVO4 photoanode to record a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 1.5%.160


4.2.2. Phase engineering. 
Rather than using one phase of TiO2, many studies on heterojunction engineering take advantage of both rutile and anatase phases.36,161 In particular, since rutile TiO2 NRs with high crystallinity can be easily synthesized by the hydrothermal method, many attempts have been made to coexist nanostructure and heterojunction with anatase TiO2. Tian et al. hydrothermally synthesized rutile TiO2 NRs and made a heterojunction anatase TiO2 nanosheet/rutile TiO2 NRs using the solvothermal method.162 As shown in SEM images (Fig. 8a), it is confirmed that cactaceae-like anatase TiO2 is uniformly formed on dense rutile NRs. Zhou et al. also fabricated the anatase/rutile TiO2 heterojunction photoanode, and a high photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE was obtained after the modification of carbon quantum dots.163 The decent PEC performances are caused by the enhanced charge transport at the interface between rutile and anatase phases with different band structures.164,165

BiVO4 is also divided into three crystal phases: tetragonal scheelite, tetragonal zircon, and monoclinic scheelite.166 Among them, the monoclinic scheelite phase shows the highest photocatalytic activity. And, since phase transitions of tetragonal scheelite and zircon to monoclinic scheelite occur at 528 K and 670 K, respectively, crystallization at a temperature over 500 °C is essential to fabricate the most photoactive phase-based photoanode. However, other than the monoclinic scheelite phase-based photoanode, many studies using other phases for photoelectrodes have been conducted. Wang et al. synthesized tetragonal zircon BiVO4 by the hydrothermal method at a lower temperature (160 °C) and longer time (12 h) and revealed a p-type semiconductor.34,35 During the hydrogen evolution reaction, the p-type tetragonal zircon BiVO4 generated a higher photocurrent density than n-type BiVO4. Also, Bai et al. applied the p-type BiVO4 to another cathodic reaction, the N2 reduction reaction.34 At the low potential of −0.1 VRHE, the p-BiVO4 photocathode exhibited high performances in the NH3 evolution rate (11.6 × 10−8 mol h−1 cm−2) and Faradaic efficiency (16.2%). In addition, Liang et al. fabricated a PEC–PEC tandem cell comprising the p-type tetragonal zircon BiVO4 nanocrystal photocathode and n-type monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 nanoporous photoanode.167 As shown in Fig. 8b, BiVO4 with different phases was used as a photoanode and photocathode, respectively, and the connected tandem cell spontaneously operated only with sunlight in a bias-free condition. As shown in the two-electrode J–V curves, a STH conversion efficiency of 0.14% was obtained, which is significant in that it is based on a bifunctional photoelectrode material with different phases.
As mentioned before, since α-Fe2O3 suffers from a short charge diffusion length, the introduction of proper electron and hole transport layers is required. Through the phase engineering using the multivalence of Fe, a transition metal, the PEC characteristics of α-Fe2O3 at the interfaces can be maximized. Leduc et al. used Fe3O4 as a precursor of the photoanode, and α-Fe2O3 was synthesized by controlling chemical vapor deposition time and annealing conditions.168 As shown in Fig. 8c, it can be seen that the thickness of FeOx was controlled according to the deposition time, and the photocurrent density and onset potential were changed. Fe3O4 under the α-Fe2O3 acted as the electron transport layer, and the α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterojunction photoanode with an optimal thickness of 11 μm recorded a photocurrent density of 0.48 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Further, Ma et al. introduced β-FeOOH as the precursor.169 Under a hydrogen atmosphere at low temperatures, β-FeOOH converted to Fe3O4 while accompanying Sn4+ doping from the FTO substrate. The diffused Sn4+ ions were impregnated into α-Fe2O3 during the phase transformation of Fe3O4. The promoted PEC properties were derived from the enhanced charge transport caused by the high Sn4+ doping level.
In the phase engineering of Ta3N5, the method of forming a new phase through the addition of external elements on the surface of Ta3N5 has been mainly studied. Pihosh et al. synthesized BaTaO2N thin layer on Ta3N5 NRs with one-step ammonia thermal treatment.170 The phase transformation to BaTaO2N occurred during the nitridation on the surface of Ta3N5 dip-coated in the Ba precursor. After the OEC deposition, the core–shell BaTaO2N/Ta3N5 photoanode showed a higher photocurrent density of 4.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE than the Ta3N5 photoanode (3.1 mA cm−2), as shown in Fig. 8d. Hou et al. also fabricated SrTaO2N/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode using Sr precursor and thermal nitridation.147 Both BaTaO2N and SrTaO2N phase-transformed from Ta3N5 formed type II band alignment with Ta3N5 and reinforced the charge separation.
Since the self-reduction of Cu2O is more thermodynamically favorable than the water reduction reaction, Cu2O has been plagued by photocorrosion. As one of the most representative methods to solve the drawbacks, there have been efforts to form CuO protection layers by oxidizing the surface of Cu2O. Han et al. first implemented the CuO/Cu2O composite through the fast-annealing process with H2-O2 flame and improved the stability of the Cu2O photocathode.171 Yang et al. also transformed the surface phase of Cu2O into CuO by using the thermal treatment.172 The bilayered composite photocathode recorded a high photocurrent density of 3.15 mA cm−2 at 0.4 VRHE with a high operation time. As shown in Fig. 8e, Cu2O and CuO also formed the type II heterojunction boosting the charge transport. Furthermore, Panzeri et al. implemented the CuS/CuO/Cu2O triple heterojunction with additional surface sulfurization.173 The homogeneously covered CuS on CuO/Cu2O surface prevented the photocorrosion and improved the stability.

4.3. EC water splitting

4.3.1. Facet engineering. 
Electrocatalysts, excluding the light absorption factor in the water splitting system, have been investigated on facets with high intrinsic catalytic activity.174,175 As catalysis occurs on the exposed surface, the surface atomic structure has a significant impact on the catalytic activity and stability. Through close interaction with DFT calculations, electrocatalysts have been developed based on a better understanding of reaction mechanisms, figuring out the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surfaces. For the HER, the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) has been a universal descriptor in acidic media. Thus, the degree of hydrogen adsorption to the catalyst surface should be designed not to be too strong or too weak. In alkaline media, overcoming the large water dissociation barrier, as well as hydrogen adsorption, has a significant influence on the catalytic activity. Therefore, using a DFT-guided design, a strategy to construct dual active sites for each step is required. For the OER, since a general scaling relationship between the adsorption energy of HOO* and HO* has been identified, the difference between the free energy of HO* and O* (ΔGO* − ΔGHO*), which varies with O* adsorption energy, has been used as a conventional descriptor.176 Besides, descriptors coupled with DFT calculations such as eg orbital occupancy and electronic conductivity are being used in catalyst screening and design.177 Currently, the importance of approaches that properly employ high throughput calculation and experimental research is increasing. In facet engineering of electrocatalysts, it is also utilized as a useful technique. Exposing a facet favorable to each of the two half-reactions, HER and OER, enables the optimization of adsorption energy with intermediate species and the increase of the active site. Interestingly, Wang et al. demonstrated that nanostructured electrocatalysts increase the active sites favorable to the overall catalytic reaction compared to bulk materials via in situ electrochemical analysis.178 As such, the electrocatalyst surface has an important effect on reaction kinetics, and nanostructures with an efficiently controlled facet bring high catalytic activity. The relationship between facet and activity of various electrocatalysts has been studied, including metal nanocrystals,179 oxides,180 hydroxides,181 phosphides,182 and chalcogenides.183 As described above, surface faceting can be classified into high-index and low-index facets. Based on surface atomic geometry, the advantages of high-index and low-index facets were applied to the development of electrocatalysts, respectively.
First, the facet-dependent activity of precious metals like Pt, Pd, Ir, and Ru, which serve as benchmark catalysts, have been investigated. To reduce the amount of precious metal with high cost and scarcity while increasing their catalytic properties, the most active and stable facet of noble metal nanocrystals has been developed.184 For the high-index facets, their low-coordinated atoms, steps, and kinks can serve as abundant catalytic active sites.185–187 In the research by Xue et al., the high-index (331) faceted Ir showed high catalytic activity as located closest to the top of the volcano plot by forming optimal adsorption energy with intermediates, compared to low-index facets of (100) and (111).188 In addition, Zhu et al. reported bifunctional RuCo nanocrystals with high-index facets were reported, showing effective performance for both HER and OER.189 As shown in Fig. 9a, in the high angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image, the RuCo nanocrystals synthesized by a facile wet-chemical reaction exposed rough surfaces with abundant steps and edges. DFT calculations also revealed that these structural features forming low coordinated Ru- and Co-sites effectively lower the energy barriers for overall water splitting. On the other hand, low-index faceted nanocrystals showed high stability as well as enhanced catalytic activity with their low surface energy. In 1996, Markovic et al. compared the Pt low-index single crystal of (111), (100), and (110), and the order of HER activity increased in the sequence of (111) < (100) < (110).190 At the same time, research has been conducted to enhance the stability of noble metal catalysts by making full use of low-index facets. For instance, to suppress the high Ru dissolution rate adverse to stability, Poerwoprajitno et al. synthesized low-index faceted Ru nanocrystals.191 In the low-index faceted Ru nanocrystals, only the edge atoms were dissolved into the electrolyte, compared to the polycrystals in which most Ru atoms were easily dissolved in unstable low-coordinated sites (Fig. 9b). Also, stable OER kinetics of Ru catalyst was achieved by Au–Ru bimetallic faceted nanoparticles with controlled seeded growth. The Ru hexagonal-pyramid branches grown on Au NPs, exposing low-index facet, had not only highly active but also stable exposed surface areas (Fig. 9c).192

Furthermore, facet control on transition metal compounds has been investigated to approach practical use, reducing catalyst costs. Many attempts have been made to increase the active sites derived from the exposed facet of metal oxide and hydroxide. In cobalt oxide, spinel Co3O4 has shown that OER activity is affected by surface configurations of Co2+ and Co3+, occupied the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.193,194 Han et al. synthesized Co3O4 nanocrystals with three structures: nanocube (NC), nanotruncated octahedron (NTO), and nanopolyhedron (NP) with exposed facets of {001}, {001} + {111}, and {112} on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO).195Fig. 9d shows that Co3O4 NP with {112} facets exhibited the highest OER activities. They also confirmed that sufficient Co3+ exposed to {112} facets was responsible for the catalytic properties, compared to {001} or {111} facets containing only Co2+. Moreover, in the CoO nanocrystals with {111} facets synthesized by cation exchange, the atomic arrangement features of the exposed facet were used as a driving force to form catalytically effective defect sites. The HAADF-STEM image of Fig. 9e shows the surface of CoO NRs with {111} facets terminated by oxygen. Thus, their surface atomic structure thermodynamically helped to form oxygen vacancies on the {111} facets. As a result, oxygen vacancies on CoO {111} facets enhanced the OER characteristics.196 For manganese oxides with various crystal structures of MnO, β-MnO2, and α-Mn2O3, the correlation between crystal facets and activity has been revealed.197–199 For example, Kakizaki et al. identified that the stable Mn3+ intermediate affects OER activity in rutile β-MnO2.199 In the {101} facet, Mn2+ and Mn4+ generate charge-balanced Mn3+ states stabilizing the formation of Mn3+ intermediate, which serves as a rate-limiting step of OER (Fig. 9f). Consequently, the current density of {101} facets with high Mn3+ coverage was three-fold higher than that of {110} facets. Recently, α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals, well-known as OER catalysts among iron oxides, have been investigated. Wu et al. verified the superior performance of highly coordinated (012) faceted α-Fe2O3 synthesized by acid-etching ((012)-O).200 The corresponding Fourier transforms (FT) of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed a seven-coordinated Fe center in (012)-O. The specific coordination formed a suitable bonding with OER intermediates to lower the kinetics barrier, coincident with DFT calculations. As shown in Fig. 9g, acid-etched (012)-O had more active sites and higher specific activity than its counterparts. On the other hand, another study on α-Fe2O3 reported that the (001) facet lowered the formation energy of oxo intermediate species during the OER steps compared to (012) and (113). Thus, α-Fe2O3 (001) facet exhibited the most cathodic shift of onset potential and highest current density.201 Additionally, facet-dependency of metal hydroxide, an active site-rich phase, is also being studied.202,203 Like many two-dimensional materials, the LDHs structure is composed of the basal plane and edge plane with low coordination. Therefore, the facet-controlled synthesis for increasing catalytically active edge planes can be applied. For instance, the hierarchical structure of NiFe LDHs nanosheet-arrays-on-microplates (NiFe NSAs-MPs) was synthesized to increase the exposure of edge planes with higher OER activities (Fig. 9h). Thus, the NiFe NSAs-MPs exhibited a lower overpotential of 250 mV at 100 mA cm−2 than the basal plane-dominant NiFe LDH microsheet arrays (NiFe MSAs) of 300 mV.204
Transition metal phosphides have been attracting attention as promising HER catalysts due to the synergism that P atoms of high electronegativity serve as proton-acceptor centers and metal atoms act as hydride-acceptor centers.205 In 2005, it was first confirmed that Ni2P (001) exposed with both Ni site and P site is an active HER catalyst, comparable to [NiFe] hydrogenase. It was described that the P site of Ni2P (001) leads to moderate bonding with hydrogen by relieving the strong bonding of the Ni site.206 Subsequently, Popczun et al. synthesized Ni2P hollow nanoparticles with a highly exposed (001) facet, as shown in Fig. 10a.207 The Ni2P with (001) facets experimentally showed significant HER activity and stability in acidic media. Besides, facet-dependent HER activity of NixPy compounds has been investigated on the Ni3P,208 the most Ni-rich phosphide, Ni5P4,209 and NiP2.210 Intriguingly, an atomic site with the free energy of hydrogen adsorption closer to zero becomes a more predominant active site, which has been used to identify active sites in several faceted phosphides. For instance, Cao et al. synthesized flower-like CoP microballs with (002) facets through the facile hydrothermal method and phosphorization (Fig. 10b1).211 They calculated the free energy of hydrogen adsorption of each atomic site to reveal the inherent active sites of CoP with (002) facets (Fig. 10b2). As a result, the P site on the (002) facet had a low ΔGH* of 0.119 eV, making it the dominant active site. In addition, the ΔGH* of the P site decreased as the hydrogen coverage increased, demonstrating that many P active sites on the (002) facet increased the activity. The dependence of ΔGH* on hydrogen coverage was also confirmed in the study of ultrathin porous CoP nanosheets with a high proportion of exposed {200} facets. Also, CoP exposed with {200} facets exhibited a low overpotential of 56 mV for 10 mA cm−2 and high stability at least 20 h in acidic HER.212 Recently, high-index facet dominant CoP was synthesized, derived from 2D-Co metal–organic frameworks. The (211) facet-dominant CoP showed a lower overpotential than the low-index (011) facet dominant CoP.213

In transition metal chalcogenides, facet engineering has been adopted as a valid strategy for increasing their limited active sites.214 The active facets of chalcogenides, consisting of various metal sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, have been developed. For the Ni-based chalcogenides, Dong et al. synthesized Ni3S2 selectively exposed (003) facet.215Fig. 10c shows the atomic structure of the (003) facet containing Ni3-triangles coordinated with three Ni atoms. Furthermore, through DFT calculations, they confirmed thermodynamically favorable reaction paths for the Ni3-triangle site and S site on the (003) facet and proposed HER mechanism for the (003) facet of Ni3S2. It has been demonstrated that the Ni3-triangle sites played a pivotal role in water dissociation, thereby facilitating the Volmer step in the alkaline HER process. Also, (111) facet of Ni3S2 showed a unique asymmetric zigzag structure, exposed with an S site and three unsaturated Ni sites. Based on its abundant active sites, the Ni3S2 with (111) facet served as a highly efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER.216 In addition, high-index {10} faceted Ni3S2 has a catalytically favorable surface with many steps and terraces compared to the low-index facet (Fig. 10d1 and d2). Therefore, in virtue of the high-index facet, the first synthesized high-index faceted Ni3S2 displayed an effective performance to give almost 100% Faradaic yield toward overall water splitting.217 Following these probes, {10} faceted Ni3S2 combined with TiO2 core has also been reported as an effective bifunctional catalyst.218
In the meantime, improved stability is one of the outcomes of surface faceting in various chalcogenides. To enhance the stability, Zhang et al. applied low-index faceting as a strategy for stable NiS2 electrocatalysts.219 Also, they exploited Fe3+ to control the {001} faceted cubic shape by reducing the pH of the hydrothermal solution, simultaneously forming Fe-doped NiOOH near the surfaces to enhance OER activity (Fig. 10e1). Consequently, the Fe-doped NiS2 exposed with {001} maintained stable OER catalysis for more than 20 h as well as lowered the overpotential (Fig. 10e2). In addition to the doping, the construction of heterointerface while maintaining the active facet also enables a stable electrocatalytic reaction. SnS2/SnO2 heterostructure, which combines high active SnS2 (100) facet and chemically stable SnO2, provided an energetically favorable reaction pathway in alkaline HER. The heterointerface alleviated the energy barrier required for water dissociation compared to single SnS2 (100) and SnO2 (101), based on different electron densities. Subsequently, the active (100) facet of SnS2 boosted H2 generation (Fig. 10f). The addition of an interface-rich heterostructure to faceted SnS2 showed a low overpotential of 108 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and long-term stability of 30 h.40
Additionally, in various selenides, highly active facets and their intrinsic mechanism have been elucidated.220,221 Dang et al. synthesized the (001) faceted orthorhombic-CoSe2 (o-CoSe2) with the highest activity derived from DFT screening.222 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 10g1, Co–Co interaction by active Co atom at upper (001) facet and its mirrored Co atom is influenced by adsorbate species. Thus, the change in distance between two Co atoms shifts the d-band center, reducing the overpotential of the rate-determining step. Fig. 10g2 shows that the free energy of the reaction pathway is dependent on the Co–Co interaction on the (001) facet. It showed that the geometry and electron structure of the surface atomic arrangement determines the catalytic properties.


4.3.2. Phase engineering. 
Many studies on crystal phase-controlled electrocatalysts have broadened the understanding of the phase-dependent activity.223 Crystalline phase has various polymorphs endowing different geometric and electronic structures. Crystal phase engineering has developed a specific phase with high intrinsic activity for HER and OER. Also, through elaborate phase transformation methods, the construction of heterostructure with two different phases is one of the effective phase engineering strategies.
In oxide-based electrocatalysts, the crystal phase control was conducted by various solution processes, including hydrothermal and solvothermal, and pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Yang et al. compared the HER activity between the monoclinic and hexagonal phases of WO3.224 The two phases of WO3 were calcined at different temperatures after the hydrothermal method. Among the two phases, the monoclinic WO3 exhibited higher catalytic activity, corroborated by low charge transfer resistance and moderate hydrogen adsorption energy. Also, following the solvothermal method, γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 were synthesized by annealing at 300 °C and 400 °C for the same time, respectively. Due to the more exposed active Fe site in α-Fe2O3, the current density at 1.60 VRHE of α-Fe2O3 was approximately four times higher than that of γ-Fe2O3 (Fig. 11a).225 For the active site of MnO2 polymorphs, Meng et al., described the influence of different geometries depending on the arrangement of the MnO6 building units and tunnel size.226 As depicted in Fig. 11b, by combining edge-shared and corner-shared MnO6, α-MnO2 with a large tunnel size had the highest intrinsic activity. The geometric characteristics of α-MnO2 formed abundant active sites with OER intermediate species and accelerated charge and mass transport with tunnel structure, compared to δ-MnO2 with layered structure by edge-shared MnO6. For Ti2O3 polymorphs, Li et al. fabricated trigonal (α-Ti2O3), orthorhombic (o-Ti2O3), and cubic (γ-Ti2O3) of Ti2O3 in the epitaxial film using the PLD.227 The three polymorphs' electrochemical acidic HER activities were higher in the order of γ-Ti2O3, o-Ti2O3, and α-Ti2O3. The overpotential of γ-Ti2O3 for 10 mA cm−2 was 271 mV, approximately half that of α-Ti2O3. Given that lowered charge-transfer energy with hybridization of O 2p and Ti 3d was observed in the epitaxially stabilized polymorphic γ-Ti2O3 and o-Ti2O3, the strongest hybridization of γ-Ti2O3 facilitated reaction kinetics. They offered a detailed explanation of the relationship between electronic structure and catalytic activity on polymorphs. Notably, in perovskite electrocatalysts, the description of catalytic activity based on the electronic structure has been widely established.228Fig. 11c1 shows three different phases of perovskite structured-LaMnO3 nanosheets, orthorhombic (o-LMONs), tetragonal (t-LMONs), and hexagonal (h-LMONs), synthesized by the salt-templated method. In partial density of states (PDOS) diagrams of Fig. 11c2, the d-band center of each crystal structure has a different relative position from EF. As the d-band center is closer to Ef, the fraction of antibonding states increases, strongly binding to the adsorbate. As for the o-LMONs, the d-band center positioned in the middle of the three phases served as evidence to demonstrate high OER activity of the orthorhombic phases by forming an appropriate bonding that was neither strong nor weak with the adsorbate.229

Through phase transformation of oxide, the formation of heterostructure with two different phases also contributed to improving the electrocatalytic properties. By constructing a heterophase of spinel phase Co3O4 and rocksalt phase CoO, Liu et al. reported a stable and active OER electrocatalyst compared to a single-phase.230 The Co3O4/CoO heterophase was synthesized by annealing the electrodeposited Co(OH)2 to get Co3O4, followed by Ar-plasma etching. Based on the similarity of spacing of a unit cell between spinel and rocksalt structures along the [111] zone axis, the in situ construction of CoO was feasible by decreasing the diffusion barrier of Co2+ ion in the presence of oxygen vacancy (Fig. 11d). Along with the structural features, the heterophase interface provided the optimal adsorption energy with OER intermediate species, especially for the second step. Based on the advantages of heterophase, phase transformation was performed with various in situ construction methods. For instance, phosphorization effectively provided a heterojunction of oxide and phosphide. Controlling the temperature under PH3 and H2 vapor treatment enabled the phase change of MoO2 to MoP/MoO2 nanosheets (Fig. 11e). Related to the electrode kinetics, the MoP/MoO2 heterojunction exhibited much lower charge transfer resistance than MoP and MoO2 single-phase.231 Additionally, a heterostructure composed of α-Bi2O3 and NiBi3–NiBi alloys was formed by thermal reduction of 2D bismuth-based nanosheets. In alkaline HER, α-Bi2O3 acted as an active site for the water dissociation step, and NiBi3–NiBi alloy for the hydrogen formation step while creating appropriate adsorption energy for each step. The heterostructure of 2D α-Bi2O3 and dual alloy phases led to an effective overall reaction pathway. Further, the double-layer capacitance associated with an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was 73.96 mF cm−2, which indicates the highest density of active sites in the optimized heterostructure.232
Recent research has also focused on phase-engineered metal nitrides because of their high electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, and abundant catalytic active sites. The catalytic activity of metal nitrides, particularly in HER, has been investigated with attention to the fact that it can have various crystal structures and nitrogen contents depending on the synthesis method. In general, metal nitride-based electrocatalysts are synthesized through thermal nitridation of precursors such as metals or metal oxides using ammonia as a nitrogen source.233 Therefore, during the nitriding process, thermodynamically controlling the formation energy of the metal–nitrogen bonding is a critical factor in determining the crystal phase and nitrogen content. Among various strategies, the incorporation of transition metals such as Co, Ni, and Fe into a precursor can facilitate the phase transformation to an energetically unstable phase. For example, the synthesis of δ-WN, which is computationally predicted to have higher HER activity than β-WN, has been restricted due to its instability at high temperatures. To address this constraint, Jin et al. introduced Co metal into a W precursor to lower the energy barrier for the growth of the δ-WN phase.234 The δ-WN with the help of Co heteroatoms proved experimentally superior alkaline HER activity, consistent with the calculation results that it has adequate hydrogen adsorption energy and water dissociation energy compared to β-WN. Furthermore, transition metal-induced phase transformation can also be exploited to create thermodynamically unfavorable nitrogen-rich phases. In the case of molybdenum nitrides, a nitrogen-rich Mo5N6 was obtained with Ni metal-induced nitridation, whereas nitrogen-deficient MoN was synthesized without Ni incorporation. Since of their Pt-like electronic structure and high Mo valence state resulting from Mo–N bonding properties, the Mo5N6 electrocatalysts achieved superior HER activity and stability in a wide pH range.235 To strategically synthesize such a metastable nitride phase, the alkali metal salts-catalyzed method, especially capable of obtaining a 2D layered structure, has also been investigated.236 Molten alkali ions, such as Na+ and K+, lower the melting point of the metal precursors to form monomers and speed up the rate at which nitrogen atoms are inserted into the metal lattice. Besides, it has the benefit of allowing ion-induced 2D growth and facile composition control, potentially leading to ternary nitrogen-rich metal nitrides.237 For instance, the Na+ molten-salt environment enabled the synthesis of metastable V0.2Mo0.8N1.2 by the assembly of MoNx and VNx monomers without phase separation in the Mo5N6 with a Mo/N ratio of 1.2. The electron accumulation effect of the V alloying enhanced the hydrogen adsorption and accelerated the overall acidic HER of the synthesized V0.2Mo0.8N1.2.238 Similarly, Yu et al. succeeded in synthesizing the nitrogen-rich h-W2N3 phase by the topotactic transformation of Na2W4O13 precursor including Na+ ions at atmospheric pressure.239 It demonstrated an outstanding HER activity with a low overpotential of −98.2 mV for 10 mA cm−2 in acidic electrolytes.
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have achieved efficient catalytic properties through phase control based on diverse crystal phases and the resultant electronic structures.240 Among the metal dichalcogenides, the pyrite-marcasite and 1T–2H phases have received the most attention. In the pyrite or marcasite phase, a metal atom bonds with adjacent chalcogen atoms forming an octahedron. Initially, for the thermodynamically stable pyrite phase of various first-low transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2, M = Ni, Fe, or Co and X = S or Se), HER activity was investigated in acidic conditions.241,242 Recently, CoSe2 with the main two phases of cubic pyrite (c-CoSe2) and orthorhombic marcasite (o-CoSe2) is extensively being developed to exploit phase-derived activity.243,244 Chen et al. showed that c-CoSe2, synthesized by further heat treatment of metastable o-CoSe2 at 450 °C, performed better in alkaline HER.245 Meanwhile, in research by Zheng et al., phase-controlled o-CoSe2 exhibited HER performance under alkaline conditions.246 They synthesized o-CoSe2via P doping-induced phase transformation (Fig. 12a). Phosphorus with weaker electronegativity than selenium transformed cubic into orthorhombic by tuning the Co d orbital and rotating the bonding angle. The P doping-assisted orthorhombic phase lowered work function and increased the electron distribution near the EF to facilitate electron transfer. With optimized P content, the P-doped o-CoSe2 displayed the low overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Expanding on this, phase-mixed HER electrocatalyst with o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 has been reported. Fig. 12b, the inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) image, shows the homogeneous distribution of two phases. The phase-mixed electrocatalyst demonstrated long-term stability, operating for more than 400 h without degradation.247 Besides CoSe2, polymorphs of NiSe2 with high intrinsic activity have been investigated for both OER and HER.248 Theoretically, DFT calculations predicted more electron-occupied states near the EF level in orthorhombic NiSe2 (o-NiSe2) than cubic NiSe2 (c-NiSe2). Using a facile colloidal method, the synthesized o-NiSe2 had a lower OER overpotential of 332 mV required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than 407 mV of c-NiSe2. Fe doping to o-NiSe2 further reduced the overpotential to 279 mV.249

Furthermore, transition metal dichalcogenides have contributed to enhancing the electrochemical HER activity with the accumulated knowledge of distinctive polymorphs, 2H and 1T.250–252 In TMDs, a single layer is covalently bonded, and the interlayers stack by weak van der Waals force. The monolayer can have two polymorphs of trigonal prismatic (2H) and octahedral phases (1T), and the digits mean the number of stacking layers. Also, especially in group-VI metals, the thermodynamically stable 2H phase exhibits semiconducting properties with a bandgap of 1–2 eV, and the metastable 1T phase exhibits metallic properties.253 Therefore, to take advantage of efficient charge transport in the metallic 1T phase, varied phase engineering methods have been introduced.254 For example, Li-intercalation, a chemical exfoliation using an n-butyllithium solution, transformed into the 1T-MoS2 nanosheets by making the 2H unstable and forming octahedrally coordinated Mo atoms (Fig. 12c). For the 1T-MoS2, the EIS results showed its metallic conductivity, indicating a lower Rct of 43 Ω relative to 232 Ω of the as-grown 2H-MoS2 in acidic media of 0.5 M H2SO4.255 In addition, Mao et al. directly obtained 1T-MoSe2via a facile hydrothermal method.256 As shown in Fig. 12d, 1T-MoSe2 showed a remarkable HER performance over 2H-MoSe2, attributed to the favorable ΔGH* and high conductivity of the 1T electronic structure. And then, additional boron incorporation also facilitated HER kinetics. At the same time, 2H-TMDs have also been identified to be electrochemically active for HER by increasing edge catalytic active sites.257–259 Under this point of view, Tan et al. synthesized 1T-TMD nanodot rich in edge sites while forming a high-ratio metallic phase.260 Through a series of ball milling, Li-intercalation, and sonication process, HER activity was evaluated for various TMD nanodots, including MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, Mo0.5W0.5S2, and MoSSe. As a result of DFT calculations, ΔGH* at the active site of MoSSe had 0.19 eV closest to zero. The MoSSe achieved not only 1T phase effects with enlarged active edge sites, but also additional effects of alloying and Se-vacancy (Fig. 12e). The MoSSe nanodots exhibited the lowest overpotential of −140 mV at −10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 40 mV decade−1 in acidic conditions. Besides, the mixed-phase TMDs, in which the 2H phase can stabilize the 1T phase maintaining the high activity of the 1T phase, have been investigated.261–263 In the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Fig. 12f, the coexistence of the 1T and 2H phases in 1T/2H MoS2 was observed. The fraction of the 1T phase was controlled by the annealing temperature. The optimized 1T/2H MoS2 showed relatively stable HER electrocatalysis after cyclic voltammetry (CV) test of 1000 cycles in the acidic solution.264

5. Challenges and outlook
This review summarizes the recent studies on crystal facet and phase control for PC, PEC, and EC water splitting. As seen in the preceding research, facet and phase engineering give opportunities to effectively use the intrinsic properties of the materials based on the geometric and electronic structures. Additionally, facet and phase junctions can bring efficient charge transport in PC and PEC and dual catalytic active sites in EC.
Nevertheless, there are still several challenges to be addressed to make use of facet and phase control for efficient water splitting. First, the exact proportion of the controlled facet or phase is not provided. Previous studies have used the expression of ‘dominantly’ exposed facet and ‘high percentage’ phase. These equivocal expressions make it difficult to quantitatively compare each case. In addition, as the different morphology in each synthesis method can occur, some criteria are needed to describe the independent effects of only facet and phase. Second, the stability of the facet- and phase-controlled catalysts should be studied as well as the catalytic activity. Most studies have mainly focused on activity enhancement, overlooking stability, which means how long the inherent activity can last. Identification of stability and further analysis of the surface chemical state after the (photo)electrochemical reactions provide guidelines to understand and utilize facet and phase engineering in more depth. Third, although the effect of heterostructure itself has been proven through various junction formations, it should be more structurally optimized to maximize the junction effect and meet the expected performance. It is predicted that facet and phase control can improve the catalyst along with nanostructuring strategies. Lastly, DFT calculations should be exploited more extensively in catalyst design in order to make the best use of intrinsic properties. DFT calculations have hitherto been used to verify catalytic activity with descriptors and theoretical tools such as density of states, Bader charge, and difference charge density. In the material synthesis, if DFT calculations enhance the understanding of the formation energy, it is feasible to achieve an advantageous facet and phase design and broaden the access range for new catalyst materials. Furthermore, it is required to construct the heterostructure capable of forming the optimized active site for each reaction step based on the DFT prediction. Using the interfacial site generated by facet and phase heterojunction sheds light on the development of catalysts. Machine learning-based screening also allows DFT calculations to successfully utilize high throughput calculations in real catalyst designs, establishing them as powerful computational tools. Over the years, a comprehensive understanding of facet- and phase-dependent properties in water splitting has been acquired. Based on that, in the process of reflecting on the challenges discussed above, more advanced water splitting with facet and phase engineering can be achieved.
