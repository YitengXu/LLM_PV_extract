    , Accepted 26th April 2012First published on 26th April 2012AbstractThe tubular-shaped nanostructure of TiO2 is very interesting, and highly ordered arrays of TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) can be easily fabricated by anodization of the Ti substrate in specific electrolytes. Here in this feature article, we review synthesis methods for various TNTs including normal, alloy, and architectural forms such as bamboos, lace, and flowers. Specific nanosize architectures such as bamboo and lace types can be regulated by alternating voltage and further anodizing. In order to extend light response of TNTs to visible solar spectra, various dopings of specific elements have been discussed. The normal and modified TNTs are suggested for applications such as dye sensitized solar cells, water splitting, photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction, sensors, energy storage devices including Li ion batteries and supercapacitors, and other applications such as flexible substrate and biomaterials.

1. Introduction
The preparation of controlled nanoscale structures of TiO2 has attracted much attention because such structures can be used in many applications including mesoscopic research and actual devices. The major nanostructure for TiO2 applications is nanoparticles (NPs), which offer the key advantage of surface extension in a dense area.1–7 Other nanoscale TiO2 structures of interest include nanorods (NRs)8–13 and nanotubes (NTs). Among them, TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) attract much attention. Well-ordered and densely-packed TNTs lend numerous advantages such as increased surface area and high conductivity. A TNT system provides shortcuts for electron flow through the wall, whereas a NP system lengthens the pathways due to the random connections between particles.
Although there have been many trials to prepare TNTs by chemical precursor reactions, which are useful methods for mass production, the order and shapes of the fabricated TNTs were not easily controllable.14–18 On the other hand, a few groups have investigated template methods which lend precise control over the nanotube wall thickness.19–22 However, these methods may utilize a vacuum process or additional complicated processes which leads to long fabrication time on a limited area. Currently, potentiostatic anodization is the easiest method to prepare highly ordered TNTs with ease of control over thickness and length. Here, we mainly discuss TNTs by a potentiostatic anodization method.
TNTs are represented in Fig. 1. Their pore size and depth can be controlled as discussed in Section 2 of this paper. On the basis of their advantages, TNTs have been adopted in many applications such as energy conversion, water splitting, photocatalysts, energy storage devices such as batteries and capacitors, and sensors. In this paper, we present methods to prepare TNTs and discuss their applications.

2. Synthesis
2.1 Normal TNTs
We group the developments in TNT synthesis by anodization into three stages starting from 2001. When the first TNTs were synthesized, the electrolyte solution was based on aqueous HF. At this stage, the lengths of TNTs were only a few μm, starting from 100 nm. The next stage of TNT synthesis by anodization is characterized by the use of organic electrolytes incorporating HF or NH4F depending on their solubility, and the length of TNTs at this phase was over 100 μm. The last stage and dominant approach at present involves the use of electrolytes with ethyleneglycol (EG), and a size of up to 1000 μm has been achieved.
The first TNTs synthesized by anodization are shown in Fig. 2.23 For the synthesis, Ti foil was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.5–1.5 wt% HF. By controlling the voltages and concentration of HF the morphology of the Ti foil surface was altered. Since the reaction time did not affect the nanotube length, the maximum length of TNTs was only 250 nm at this early stage of synthesis. Since the discovery of TNTs, there have been numerous trials to improve synthetic methods and obtain more precise control over their morphology. Table 1 summarizes selected experiments with noteworthy characteristics such as length, inner diameter, applied voltage, wall thickness, and electrolyte conditions.23–37 As shown in Table 1, most TNTs in water based electrolytes were only a few hundred nm in length. Although a change in voltage affects the morphology of TNTs, the chemical composition of the electrolyte plays the most important role in determining the structure of TNTs. As seen in Table 1, all the electrolytes contain fluoride anions in the solution. The fluoride anion plays a key role in etching out the oxidized Ti foil. Acetic acid has often been used to make the TNTs mechanically robust, but it does not change their morphology. Bath temperature also affects the length of TNTs. Normally, increasing the temperature of the bath decreases the length of the TNTs. Besides, Sreekantan et al. recently reported extremely fast growth of TNTs by adding H2O2, which gives a growth rate of around 300 nm min−1.38 Another approach for controlling anodization rate was achieved by Wang et al.39 The TNT growth mechanism was considered to be the equilibrium of the electrochemical oxidation of Ti at the pore tip and the chemical etching of TiO2 by F−, and chemical etching reaction requires protons (TiO2 + 6F− + 4H+ → TiF62− + 2H2O). Therefore, they hypothesized that controlling protons in the etching process by adding Na2CO3 may accelerate formation of TiO2. Na2CO3 neutralizes protons on the surface, and this results in hastening the growth of TNTs. Actually, they showed rapid anodization of the Ti substrate at a rate of 1100 nm min−1.

2.2 Surface modified TNTs
Intrinsic TiO2 has a band gap of 3.0 (rutile) to 3.2 eV (anatase). In order to broaden the solar spectrum response, the band gap of TNTs must be adjusted to be active to visible light. For this reason, TNTs have been modified by doping methods. Doping has been successfully demonstrated by both introduction of a dopant into a chemical solution and gas treatment.40,41 Coating with additional light active materials such as CdS has also been reported.42–46
The easiest method is annealing TNTs in a hydrocarbon flame at temperature exceeding 850 °C. Carbon doped TNTs showed a band gap of 2.32 eV. Despite its convenience, this method does not yield reproducible results with high quality of doping in a large area. In addition, the crystallinity of an anatase nanostructure often changes to a rutile phase which is not desirable for some research purposes and applications. The phase transition temperature from anatase to rutile is around 550 °C. The surface temperature during the doping process by the flame method increases up to 1000 °C. In order to improve carbon doping quality, Park et al. used a CO gas flow with heating in a vessel.47 In the case of nitrogen doping, NH3 gas can be flown while TNTs are seated in a quartz glass tube with a temperature setting ranging from 300–700 °C for a few minutes to hours.
Another doping method involves chemical reaction in an anodization bath. In the case of nitrogen doping,48,49 TNT samples are immersed in 1 M NH3·H2O solution for several hours to evenly coat precursors inside pores, followed by annealing for a few hours. N-doped TNTs show band gap changes down to 2.25 eV.50
2.3 TNTs by alloy anodization
The surface characteristics can be modified by alloy anodization as well. There have been many trials to modify TNT's characteristics by employing Ti alloys with other metal composites such as Nb, Mo, V, Pd, W, Zr, Sr.51–59 Each alloy TNT has specific characteristics. For example, V2O5 in TNTs enhances ion interaction properties and electrochromic properties by high charge storage capacity,55 and Pd-TNTs show improved capability for the immobilization of myoglobin.56 Brief synthetic conditions and resulting structures are summarized in Table 2.

N-doped TNTs can be prepared by anodizing a TiN alloy (∼5 at% of N), which is prepared from high purity Ti and TiN powders by using an arc-melting apparatus.60 When the alloy is anodized by the conventional method for pure Ti, the amount of nitrogen content critically affects TNT dimensions. The higher amount of nitrogen causes the smaller diameter of nanotubes. 15 to 18% of nitrogen contents were observed for 20 nm diameter. Fig. 3 shows photocurrent spectra of TNTs via TiN alloy and pure Ti with respect to wavelength. When N-doped TNTs are applied for photochemical characterization with a setup consisting of a Xe arc lamp and 0.1 M Na2SO4 at 500 mV, its photoresponse has been extended to the visible light region.

2.4 Other types of TNTs
While most conventional methods employ constant voltage for TNT syntheses, Albu et al. modified the applied voltage program to prepare new bamboo-type TNTs (b-TNTs), as shown in Fig. 4(a).61 The alternating voltages were 120 V and 40 V for the experiment, and controlled time for each step enabled control over the shape of the b-TNTs. For example, a long spacing between bamboo rings can be obtained by increasing the reaction time at a higher voltage. When anodization time is extended significantly, the three dimensional bamboo structures become two dimensional nanolace, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Chemical etching by fluoride anions is facilitated at the thinner wall side, and the thicker ring sections remain.61

Another interesting structure is double walled TNTs (dw-TNTs),31,62 as shown in Fig. 4(c). In order to prepare the dw-TNTs, Ji et al. used alternating voltage as shown in Fig. 4(d), with an electrolyte containing 0.25% NH4F/ethylene glycol. The upper level voltage and lower level voltage can be varied as 120–80 V and 40–20 V, respectively.
Recently, various controls have been successfully extended to structures like bamboo leaves, squares, triangles, and flowers.63,64
3. Applications
3.1 Dye sensitized solar cells
One of the important applications for TNTs is DSSCs.18,24,27–30,34,65 DSSCs normally consist of a working electrode with metal oxide NPs such as TiO2 or ZnO, a counter electrode with Pt or carbon materials, and an electrolyte with redox shuttle (I−/I3−).66–69 Although various NPs have been applied for DSSC working electrodes, TiO2 is the dominant material for working electrodes. When TiO2 NPs are used, the electrodes normally undergo a sintering process for high efficiencies. Without a sintering process, NPs are not effectively connected, and electron loss back to the electrolyte occurs. Early trials for working electrodes with TNTs via molecular assembly have met with some success, although fully ordered structures on substrates were not realized. For instance, a few studies applied TNTs synthesized by a molecular assembly method on FTO glass substrates, and they observed higher current densities in a few μm thickness.18,65
When anodized TNTs are applied to DSSC working electrodes, in addition to high surface area, fast electron movement with diminished back electron transfer can be expected. This key advantage was realized by Grimes et al. for the first DSSC application by TNTs.29,30 The structure is shown in Fig. 5. To prepare the working electrode, Ti foil with a thickness of 250 μm was anodized in an electrolyte containing 0.1 M KF, 1 M NaHSO4, and 0.2 M trisodium citrate with NaOH for pH adjustment to 5.0 for 17 hours at 25 V. The experimental conditions yielded a TNT array with 6.2 μm length, 110 nm pore size, and 20 nm wall thickness. To complete the DSSC device, the TNT was treated with TiCl4, and a subsequent sintering process is required for not only TiCl4 treatment but also crystallization of the amorphous TNT array. The TiCl4 treatment increases the surface area for dye loading by more than 20%. There were concerns over dye coating problems on the TNT array due to possible air trapped in pores, but acetonitrile solvent adequately addressed this. Ethanol solvent, on the other hand, did not deliver N719 dye into TNTs pores efficiently, and thus low current density was observed. Other than this aspect, all other factors are exactly the same as in the conventional DSSC fabrication methods; for instance, 0.3 mM N719 solution and an electrolyte containing 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M N-methylbenzimidazole, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in methoxypropionitrile were employed.
 Fig. 5  The structure of dye sensitized solar cells devices (a) with TNTs as a working electrode (b). This structure requires backside illumination. Reprinted with permission of ref. 29. 
Unfortunately, the first structure was not appropriate for front side illumination because light entered from the working electrode side. This was due to the solid Ti metal substrate that TNTs were synthesized from. Note that front illumination is common in DSSCs, and only limited devices use back illumination.70–72 Back illuminated devices normally have relatively low efficiencies because photons can be scattered when they pass through the Pt coated counter electrode and electrolyte before reaching dyes on the TiO2 surface.29 Although the structure had to be realized with a back illumination structure, it showed superior electron transfer characteristics to the conventional nanoparticulate system. The efficient electron transfer is mainly due to fewer grain boundaries in the TNT system compared to a NP working electrode as well as due to a direct vectorial charge transfer route. This advantage enables the utilization of a TNT array with greater thickness for the DSSC, where normally the thickness is optimized at 12–15 μm for a nanoparticulate system with N719 dyes. Due to this technical limitation, the very first TNT arrays for DSSCs used only a 6.2 μm thick film, and the device showed an efficiency of 4.24% by back illumination with JV characteristics of 8.79 mA as Jsc, 841 mV as Voc, and 0.57 as a fill factor under 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G).
Lifetime was compared when transparent TNTs on a FTO glass substrate were prepared by Paulose et al.30 In order to obtain transparent TNTs for front illuminated devices, the thickness of the TNTs was considered on a nm scale. With anodization of a 4000 nm thick Ti film on FTO, a 3600 nm thick TNT array was obtained from an electrolyte consisting of 0.5% HF + acetic acid (7:1) at 5 °C and 12 V. Fig. 6(a) shows transparency images after each step. A DSSC with 3 μm thick TiO2 NPs is used for comparison. Fig. 6(b) shows the electron lifetimes by open circuit voltage decay measurements. As seen in the figure, short and long TNTs on Ti foil showed the longest life time, and the nanoparticulate system showed the shortest life time. When transparent short TNT is applied on FTO for front illumination, the lifetime was shorter than the foil based cell with back illumination, and longer than the nanoparticulate system with front illumination. Although electron lifetime for transparent short TNTs is located at an intermediate position irrespective of front illumination, this is due to the contact between TNTs and FTO glass.

After this successful approach, longer TNTs were applied to DSSC systems.36 TNTs longer than 200 μm were achieved by an electrolyte containing EG with minimized water content. Although long TNTs were successfully synthesized, Shankar et al. determined that 20 μm is an optimized length in terms of performance. Using 20 μm long TNTs, the efficiency was 6.89% with JV characteristics of 12.72 mA cm−2 as Jsc, 0.817 V as Voc, and 0.663 as a fill factor under 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G). Relative to the initial effort to apply TNTs to a DSSC working electrode, more than 60% improvement was attained.
In order to circumvent the problems of backside illumination for TNTs, Park et al. developed a new approach. After the growth of TNTs with 7–35 μm lengths, the film was detached to transfer it to a FTO glass substrate.33,34 This scheme is shown in Fig. 7(a). In the first step, Ti thin foil was anodized in 0.25 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O containing ethyleneglycol at 60 V. The separation of TNTs from the Ti foil was completed by dipping the sample in the 0.1 M HCl (aq) for 1 hour. The free standing TNTs film was transferred onto the FTO glass substrate, and a few drops of 100 mM Ti-isopropoxide in isopropanol were subsequently applied to improve adhesion. Then this electrode was assembled as a device with an electrolyte containing 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15). JV characteristics depending on the lengths of TNTs are shown in Fig. 7(b). The best performance was achieved with TNTs of 35 μm, and the efficiency was 7.6% with JV characteristics of 16.8 mA cm−2 as Jsc, 0.733 V as Voc, and 0.62 as a fill factor under 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G).

Another notable application was realized on a flexible substrate with an ionic liquid electrolyte by Kuang et al.28 After anodization of a Ti foil up to 14 μm, they combined the electrode with Pt coated ITO-PEN. The electrolyte for the device was an ionic liquid composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M N-butylbenzimidazole, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixture of PMII and EMIB(CN)4 (v/v, 65:35). The device exhibited a Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.709 V, and a fill factor of 0.561 with an overall efficiency of 3.58% under 1 sun conditions (AM 1.5G).
3.2 Water splitting
Another general application of TNTs is water splitting, an area that has attracted the interest of researchers for many years. As supporting characteristics, TiO2 shows strong chemical stability and photostability at low cost. Unlike the application of DSSCs described above, water splitting normally is carried out with a three electrode system with an additional reference electrode as model studies. For photoelectrolysis, a mercury arc lamp is used with optical filters to specify a wavelength adoptable to the TNT band gap, i.e., near 3.2 eV. The efficiency is calculated by the ratio of (output power)/(input power), which can be represented as follows:59η (%) = [(total power output − electrical power input)/light power input] × 100=[jp(1.23 − Vb)/Po] × 100where jp is photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and Vb is the bias voltage that is added in series with the two electrodes (between the working and counter electrode) in order to assist the water splitting reaction. Po is the incident light intensity (100 mW cm–2)
Mor et al. applied TNTs to enhance photocleavage of water by a TNT array.73 For a TNT working electrode, the inner diameter was controlled to be 22 nm by applying 10 V in an aqueous electrolyte including 0.5% HF + acetic acid (7:1 ratio). By varying the reaction temperature, the lengths of TNTs were changed from 120 nm to 224 nm. Fig. 8 shows the variation of the photocurrent density versus the measured potential for 4 different samples prepared at different temperatures. The longer TNTs showed higher efficiency due to larger catalytic area, when photogenerated carriers are diffused to an electrolyte effectively. In addition to the increased active sites by increasing lengths, the thickness of the wall also contributes to the efficiency. In a nanometer scale, a decrease in size also weakens the ability to restrict band bending effectively. Therefore, a thicker TNT (34 nm) has greater band bending than a thinner TNT (9 nm). Greater band bending induces less surface recombination, which results in higher photocurrent density. The band bending might be more important for higher photocurrent density.

Since TNTs utilize only the UV region due to their band gap, the efficiencies based on the full solar spectrum are very limited. Note that UV light is only about 4% of the total spectrum. In order to utilize visible sun spectra, a few approaches to dope TiO2 with elements such as N, C, Nb, or Co have been developed.74–82 In terms of stability and a narrower band gap, C-doped TiO2 is one of the best known candidates for water splitting applications.40,41,83–85 Park et al. reported C-doped TNTs for water splitting applications, and reported 20 times higher photocurrent density compared to a P-25 particulate film under white-light illumination.47 For the application, TNTs with high aspect ratios with length around 3 μm were synthesized. The diameter and the wall thickness were 70 nm and 20 nm, respectively. CO gas was introduced in order to dope carbon while annealing TNTs at high temperature over 500 °C up to 800 °C. As shown in Fig. 9(a), C-doped TNTs respond to visible light. Note that normal TNTs do not respond to visible light. When UV and visible light entered the samples, the photogenerated current density on C-doped TNTs was almost doubled compared to non-doped TNTs. This is mainly due to the change of the band gap of the TNTs as shown in Fig. 9(b). After carbon doping, the band gap of TNTs has been changed down to 2.2 eV.

Allam et al. initiated doping with nitriding simultaneously by employing Ti–Pd alloy samples. The samples drastically improved visible light response, shifting the absorption edge to 577 nm. The efficiency of water splitting at AM 1.5G illumination is 0.83%, which is almost 5 times greater than that obtained from TNTs alone with similar length.86
Another approach is surface modification by metals, or semiconductors such as CdS or WO3,43,44,87–92 as described in the synthesis part. CdS and WO3 are well characterized materials with band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.5 eV, respectively. TNTs with these coating materials showed efficiencies of 1–2%.43,92
3.3 Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants
Since TiO2 itself has prevalently been used for photodegradation of pollutants, ordered TNTs have been applied for the same purpose as well. When it comes to photodegradation, TNTs have advantages such as unidirectional charge transfer through the walls and large surface area. Quan et al. successfully demonstrated that TNTs showed higher kinetic constants for photoelectrochemical degradation of pentachlorophenol in aqueous solution by 86.5%. They used TNTs with 300–500 nm lengths and 30–90 nm diameters, and compared them with a TiO2 NP system prepared by a sol–gel method.93 Since this surprising result was reported, there have been many interesting applications to various pollutants such as spill oils, toluene, phenol derivatives, acetaldehyde, and cyclohexane.94–99
In order to extend response of TNTs to visible light, there have been a few interesting trials. Chai et al. prepared macroporous Sb-doped SnO2 (Mp-SnO2) films on TNTs through a block copolymer soft template method.95 The new composite, Mp-SnO2–TNTs, shows a decreased band gap of 2.93 eV. Note that the band gap of TNTs without modification is near 3.2 eV. Fig. 10 shows a red shift of the absorption band edge with noticeable increase of photocatalytic response at the visible light region. Another interesting approach utilizes polyoxophosphotungstate (POW) encapsulation in TNTs.100 The hybrid POW–TNTs electrode responds to the visible spectrum as shown in Fig. 11. They used bisphenol A (BPA) as a probe pollutant, and observed photocatalytic effect with visible light. BPA degradation ratios are 0.6%, 3.2%, and 4.0% for TNTs only, microstructured POW–TiO2, and nanostructured POW–TNTs, respectively.

Besides, there have been other approaches to improve photocatalytic ability of TNTs. He et al. applied Ag-decoration on a TNTs array.101 Metal cooperated TiO2 often improves lifetimes of holes and electrons, which results in increase of photocatalytic ability by preventing electron–hole recombination. Once free-standing TNTs were prepared, a facile wetting-thermal decomposition procedure was followed to decorate TNTs with Ag by an Ag precursor. Fig. 12(a) shows a brief sketch of well dispersed Ag NPs in TNTs, and Fig. 12(b) shows UV absorption spectra of pentachlorophenol with respect to irradiation time. The initial reading of pentachlorophenol is expressed as a blue line, and a set of red lines and a set of green lines are for Ag decorated TNTs and TNTs only, respectively. According to the figure, Ag decorated TNTs give much higher catalytic degradation ability toward pentachlorophenol.

3.4 Photocatalytic reduction of CO2
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 on TNTs is an important issue due to possible future energy crises and global warming concerns. Varghese et al. utilized N-doped TNTs for CO2 reduction.102 The scheme for the carbon dioxide conversion to hydrocarbon fuels by sunlight is represented in Fig. 13. The authors suggested three strategies for optimizing TNTs for CO2 reduction applications. Firstly, high surface areas with thin wall thickness are necessary to easily transfer charged carries to the surface. Secondly, bandgap control is very important to extend photospectral response of TNTs down to the visible region. Finally, cocatalyst NPs need to be evenly spread over the TNTs to adsorb the reactants and help the reaction. For this purpose, N-doped TNTs were prepared with Pt or Cu NPs dispersed on the top of the TNT surface. Fig. 14 shows the hydrocarbon generation rate for each structure. According to the figure, TNTs with Cu NPs give a higher generation rate for hydrocarbon fuel, and TNTs with Pt NPs give a higher generation rate for H2.

According to the experiments by Schulte et al.,103 annealing temperature of TNTs affects UV-vis spectral response. UV absorbance decreases when the annealing temperature is increased. As shown in Fig. 15, the UV-vis absorbance trend is the same as the methane production trend. For example, the 620 °C sample produces the least amount of methane, which is consistent with its UV-vis response. This mainly occurs due to phase changes from the anatase phase (considered to be more active) at low temperature to the rutile phase at high temperature.

3.5 Chemical sensors
The fifth application of interest is chemical sensors. Until now, metal oxide semiconductors have been utilized as chemical sensors due to their simple working principle, high sensitivity, and low material cost.104 Among them, TiO2 based gas sensors have been widely investigated because of their inert surface property and high sensing ability.105 Generally, the working mechanism of chemical sensors originates from a surface phenomenon, and therefore nanostructure can offer several advantages for chemical sensors.106
First, the need for highly sensitive hydrogen gas sensors is an important issue with respect to hydrogen economy, as hydrogen is being considered as a potential fuel for automotive power, energy needs of buildings, and portable electronics.107–110 Vertically aligned and highly ordered TNT arrays have been studied for use in hydrogen sensors owing to their remarkable variation of electrical resistance in the presence of hydrogen.111

Fig. 16 shows the resistance versus time response for a TiO2 nanotube array sensor at 290 °C upon exposure to 100–500 ppm H2 in high purity N2 at a temperature of around 290 °C. The sensing behavior of the sensor is consistent, recovering its original resistance after repeating the sensing experiment. To check the behavior of the sensor upon repeated hydrogen exposure, the hydrogen concentration was varied in discrete steps of 100 ppm from 0 to 500 ppm while keeping the temperature constant at 290 °C; the chamber was flushed with nitrogen after each exposure to hydrogen. The response of the 20 V prepared nanotube sensors, kept at 290 °C, is shown in Fig. 16. The behavior of the sensor is consistent, recovering its original resistance after repeated exposure to varying hydrogen gas concentrations. The fundamental mechanisms that cause a gas detection are still controversial, but essentially trapping of electrons at adsorbed H2 and band bending induced by these charged molecules are responsible for a change in resistance.
 Fig. 16  Resistance of a 20 V sample when exposed to different concentrations of hydrogen at 290 °C. The nitrogen–hydrogen mixture was passed for 1500 s; the chamber was then flushed with nitrogen for 3000 s before passing the nitrogen–hydrogen mixture again. Reprinted with permission of ref. 111. 
As a second application of TNT arrays, a gas sensor using TNT arrays was fabricated for formaldehyde (HCHO) detection at room temperature. Formaldehyde is colorless and can cause several symptoms such as watery eyes, burning sensation in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulties in breathing.112 Even though various metal oxides have been investigated for HCHO sensors, the sensitivity level is not sufficient. Recently, TNT arrays anodized in 0.27 M NH4F consisting of a mixture of de-ionized water and glycerol with a ratio of 50:50 were used for the detection of HCHO. Fig. 17 shows the response of TNT array based sensors under different concentrations of HCHO. After exposure to HCHO, the resistance of the sensor increases dramatically. All sensors showed a noticeable response to HCHO within a concentration range from 10 ppm to 50 ppm. When TNT arrays were annealed at 400 °C, the best response was observed, which means the sensitivity might be influenced by the morphology of TNT arrays. This was attributed to the fact that as the annealing temperature increases, disruption of the tubes as well as breakdown of the inlet of the tubes takes place, resulting in particle growth.113
 Fig. 17  (a) Response of the fabricated TNT array based sensors and (b) a response curve of the sensor using the TNTs annealed at 400 °C to different concentrations of formaldehyde at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) with R.H. ∼40%. Reprinted with permission of ref. 112. 
As another application of TNT arrays, TNT arrays have been investigated as electrochemical electrodes for highly sensitive UV sensors. The photocurrent values of TNT arrays in different light sources are shown in Fig. 18. The response time under illumination is less than 100 ms. The generation of photocurrent inside TNT arrays originates from the absorption of UV energy as TiO2 is a wide-gap semiconductor with band gap energy of 3.2 eV. Hence, when the TNT arrays are exposed to visible light, such as 405 nm, 436 nm, 546 nm, and 577 nm, the photocurrent is too small to be considered compared with the photocurrent density from radiation of UV light.114

Recently, the most actively used homemade explosive, utilized by terrorists, is triacetone triperoxide (TATP). Interestingly, modified TNT arrays can be used in the detection of TATP. Because Zn ions can interact with TATP, TNT arrays are exchanged with Zn2+ by using an aqueous ZnSO4 solution before use. The exchange process of the surface hydroxyl proton with zinc ions is represented below.1152Ti–OH + Zn2+ → 2Ti–OZn + 2H+Fig. 19 shows a potentiostatic I–t plot of a Zn modified TNT array detector with and without TATP vapors. There is a sharp increase in the current to 10−1 to 10−3 A. From this result, it is confirmed that TNT arrays can be useful in detection of vapors from improvised organic peroxide explosives such as TATP.115

A representative cycle of 300 s is shown in the figure. The cycle is divided into three phases. Phase (a) shows the current obtained before passing TATP vapors, phase (b) shows the current obtained throughout TATP passed and phase (c) current obtained after the removal of the TATP source from the Zn2+–TiO2 sample. An increase in negative current shows the complexation of TATP on the TNTs sensor. Removal of the TATP source brought the current back to its original value. Reprinted with permission of ref. 115. 
TNT arrays also have been applied to an electro-catalytic biosensor by modifying the electrode with glucose oxidase.116 The resultant glucose biosensor shows a high sensitivity to glucose in a range of 0 to 1.8 mM and a detection limit of 0.1 mM. Fig. 20 displays the amperometric response of the biosensor to different concentrations of glucose from 0 mM to 0.4 mM at −0.2 V vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. In this study, Pt–Au nanoparticle decorated TNT arrays were fabricated with TNT arrays as a substrate. They found that the significantly enhanced catalytic activity of Pt–Au decorated TNT arrays can be attributed to the enhanced conductivity due to the loaded Au and Pt NPs and the electrochemically catalytic activity of Pt. The biosensor exhibits a linear response to glucose in concentration ranging from 0 to 1.8 mM, with sensitivity of 0.08366 μA mM−1.

The glucose concentration is the final one. The inset shows the calibration curve for glucose concentrations between 0.1 mM and 0.8 mM. Reprinted with permission of ref. 116. 
Another important gas sensor is the oxygen sensor. With rapidly increasing demand for these sensors, TNT array based sensors have been studied. For example, oxygen composition in the air–fuel mixture in automobile engines is an important measure. Because a surface resistance controlled mechanism suits most gas sensors, TNT arrays may have potential as a good oxygen sensing material. Lu et al. investigated the isothermal response of the electrical resistance of the TNT sensor at a working temperature of 50 °C when the oxygen concentration is changed from 1.2% to 4.0% in nitrogen.117 As can be seen in Fig. 21, the sensitivity of the oxygen sensor has a good linear relationship with oxygen concentration at 50 °C. When the operating temperature was increased to 100 °C, the sensitivity of TNT array based sensors increases as shown in Fig. 22. The resistance response at a temperature of 100 °C of the sensor changed remarkably without any hysteresis.

3.6 Energy storage devices

Li-ion battery. 
With diversification of the performance of mobile devices and electric or hybrid-electric vehicles (EVs or HEVs), the demand for alternative anode materials for Li-ion batteries is rapidly increasing. Recently, TiO2 has drawn huge attention as an anode material in Li-ion batteries due to its safety, low price, chemical stability, and non-toxicity.118–123 One of the obstacles for the use of TiO2 in Li-ion batteries is its low Li-ion diffusivity and electronic conductivity, which deteriorate reversibility and high rate performances. To address these drawbacks, nanostructuring of TiO2 has been exploited by reducing the Li ion diffusion length by increasing the contact area between the active material and electrolyte. TNT arrays with various sizes have been synthesized by different groups using anodizing methods. However, the application of TNT arrays has been restricted because synthesized TNT arrays are situated on Ti foil.
Recently, another electrochemical approach to very rapidly form a high aspect ratio nanotube powder under breakdown conditions in chloride- or perchlorate-containing electrolytes was introduced.124Fig. 23 schematically illustrates the fabrication process of TNT powders obtained via potentiostatic rapid breakdown anodization. A white TNT powder was synthesized successfully, as seen in the photograph in Fig. 23. Fig. 24 shows SEM images of the side and a close-up top view of a TNT prepared in HClO4 electrolyte at 20 V. The tubes have a well-ordered structure with 20–25 μm length. From the HR-TEM image, the as-grown powder has an outer diameter of about 40 nm and an inner diameter of about 15 nm.

(I) TNT bundles are synthesized on both sides of Ti foil; (II) after anodization for more than 2 min, due to the vigorous nature and the ultrahigh speed of the reaction, the tubes formed on the Ti surface start releasing into the electrolyte; (III) the anodization process continues until the initial Ti metal foil is completely transformed into TNTs and a white precipitate has been formed; (IV) the precipitated TNTs are thoroughly washed with distilled H2O, centrifuged, filtered, and finally dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Photographs show the final appearance of TNT powder obtained by the rapid breakdown anodization method. Reprinted with permission of ref. 124.

Recently, Park et al. investigated the lithium storage performance of TNT arrays that were synthesized by a rapid breakdown anodizing method.125Fig. 25(a) shows the charge–discharge behavior at a rate of 1 C as a function of heat treatment temperature. When the TNT arrays were annealed at a temperature below 400 °C, the first capacitance was less than 200 mA h g−1 due to the relatively poor crystallinity. With increasing annealing temperature, TNT array powder shows higher first lithiation capacitance of around 255 mA h g−1 and distinct plateaus at 1.7 V (vs. Li/Li+) because the ordered crystalline structure drives a phase transition from LixTiO2 to Li0.5TiO2 with a well-established two-phase region. Fig. 25(b) shows the cycle life of the TNT array powder based anode as a function of the annealing temperature. The sample annealed at 500 °C presented the best performance (Fig. 25(c)). However, at rates above 5 C, the charge storage capacities of the TNT array powder decrease dramatically due to their poor electrical conductivity.

To overcome this drawback, Park et al. synthesized a carbon coated TNT array powder to enhance electronic conductivity.126 In Fig. 26, the charge–discharge profile of a pristine TNT powder displays a slight deviation between the first cycle and the 50th cycle. However, after carbon coating on the TNT powder, the TNT powders have almost identical potential profiles throughout all cycles. From Fig. 26(c), the positive effect of the carbon coating at high rates is clearly observed.

Supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors, another charge storage device, have been used in high power energy storage devices, such as power enhancement and primary or hybrid power sources combined with batteries and fuel cells for hybrid electric vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles.127–130 Generally, supercapacitors are classified into two categories, depending on the charge-storage mechanism. First, in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), the charge storage is correlated with the specific surface area of the active material, resulting in effective separation of charge despite the vanishingly thin (on the order of nanometers) physical separation of the layers. Supercapacitors in the other class, called redox capacitors, are based on materials with pseudocapacitance characteristics, such as conducting compounds or other metal oxide based inorganic materials.128
Recently, Kim et al. reported the EDLC type charge storage behavior of TNT arrays for the first time.121 It was found that the nanotube array itself can participate in the formation of an electric double layer. Regarding the charge storage from Li intercalation in Li-ion batteries, the specific capacitances of the TNT arrays were greatly influenced not only by their crystalline structure, but also by the electrolyte composition (Fig. 27). As can be seen in Fig. 27(a), the current densities increased linearly as a function of the voltage scan rate, and the shapes were maintained at a high CV scan rate, indicating good EDLC properties. Fig. 27(b) shows the CV characteristics of the TNT arrays in a base solution (1 M KOH). When compared with Fig. 27(a), the CV diagrams are very noisy and the current densities are very low. Fig. 28 shows the dependence of the specific capacitance of the TNT arrays on the length of the tubes. Even though the specific capacitance value is about one-fourth that of activated carbon, the TNT array based EDLC-type energy-storage device has considerable potential, because it has eight times higher density than that of activated carbon.

With respect to another type of supercapacitor, there has been extensive interest in developing pseudocapacitor electrode materials, such as manganese oxide,122–135 cobalt oxide,135,136 and nickel oxide.137,138 One possible method to obtain a pseudo-capacitive material with high specific capacitance is to hybridize pseudo-capacitive materials with TNT arrays, which have high specific surface area. Kim et al. synthesized NiO doped TNT arrays by electrochemically anodizing Ni–Ti alloy foils followed by thermal annealing.139Fig. 29 shows SEM images of anodized Ni–Ti foils at different potentials (20 V–80 V).

For all samples, the NT architecture is well retained. From an analysis of the SEM images, the average NT pore diameter, wall thickness, and intertube spacing are 38, 13, and 5 nm, respectively. Fig. 30 presents charge–discharge profiles of the NiO doped TNT array from galvanostatic measurements at a constant current density (0.4 mA cm−2). The authors estimate that the specific capacitance of the NiO–TiO2 NT electrodes was in the range of 40–100 F g−1. These are greatly improved data when compared with those of ref. 113. Fig. 30(b) shows the long-term cycling stability of the NiO–TiO2 NT electrode for the first 500 cycles. The composite electrodes display stable long-term cycling performance because of the assistance of the 1D nanostructure of TiO2.

3.7 Other applications
As an extended form of dye sensitized solar cells, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) are also successfully demonstrated. Smith and Subramanian prepared a flexible TiO2 NPs–TNT composite as a photoanode for QDSCs. CdS, a sensitizer, was coated on the electrode by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method. This device showed up to 2 mA cm−2 as a short-circuit current.140
There have been a few more trials to make TNTs for flexible substrate applications. Wang et al. invented a novel method to electrodeposit other materials through the nanopores, with the resulting composite showing high flexibility.141Fig. 31 shows a brief scheme to prepare a highly flexible TNTs–conducting polymer composite.

TNTs have been also used as a template to prepare nanopore polymer arrays as shown in Fig. 32. They used anodized TNTs with intrinsic conducting polymer, polypyrrole, in between TNTs. Selective electropolymerization of pyrrole incorporate polymerization only between the walls, and dissolution of TNTs in 5 vol% HF completes polypyrrole nanopore arrays.

Schmuki' group investigated the effectiveness of TNT arrays on cell fate behaviour. First, they controlled the diameters of TNT between 15 nm and 100 nm. They observed that adhesion, spreading, growth, and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells are critically dependent on the tube diameter.143 Moreover, they reported on the use of TNT arrays for the photocatalytic killing of cancer cells. After absorbing photon energy from the UV solar light, the cancer cells on TNT arrays reduced their shape and size and a significant amount of the dead cells were also observed.144 Because of the high band gap of TiO2, TNT arrays can only absorb the spectrum in the near-UV region which is about 4% of the solar spectrum. To increase the effectiveness of photocatalytic activity of TNT for the use in biosensor substrates, various methods for extending the absorption ability of TNT have been developed via doping it with quantum dots, such as CdS, CdSexTe1−x.145,146 The effects of unique structure of TNT arrays on vascular cells, bon cells, and blood clotting were also reported.147–149
4. Conclusion and future outlook
We have briefly summarized the anodization method to prepare highly ordered TNTs and their anticipated applications in this feature article. Depending on the experimental conditions, the physical shapes of TNTs are varied from hundreds of nm to thousands of μm. While electrons in TiO2 NPs are easily scattered and trapped due to the presence of many boundaries, TNTs show substantially improved conductivities through the vectorial direction with high surface area. Furthermore, improved electrochemical approaches have made it possible to alter the morphology of TNTs to bamboo type and nanolace structure and to enhance electrochemical characteristics by doping. Nanoscale structures provide opportunities to pass electrons or collect electrons in a specific system.
TNTs prepared by an anodization method are densely packed, and therefore utilization of the outside wall is also very limited. Modification of the nanostructure is aimed more at the inside of the wall than outside. Additionally, fine controllable tuning of pore size, diameters, and wall thickness is important, while the length of TNTs is another challenging goal. Each characteristic plays a key role in various applications in terms of conductivity, surface area, and trapping boundary sites. These variable physical characteristics can be strengths or drawbacks in practical applications. For instance, the trapping sites in crystal structures are often used as catalytic active sites for water splitting but electron loss routes for DSSCs. Therefore, fine tuning of each factor may affect the performance of applicable devices.
Finally, crystallinity must be controlled with ease. Current TNTs exploit the multicrystallinity of TNTs after a sintering process. The sintering temperature often must be high, over 500 °C. Lower temperature control may broaden TNT applications. Also, monocrystallinity will improve conductivity and lower trap sites. This article has provided the outlook for TNT applications. We believe that TNTs with controlled tuning are an exciting platform for many applications as shown in the article.

 	Fig. 23  Schematic diagram showing the fabrication process of TiO2 NT powders obtained via potentiostatic rapid breakdown anodization. (I) TNT bundles are synthesized on both sides of Ti foil; (II) after anodization for more than 2 min, due to the vigorous nature and the ultrahigh speed of the reaction, the tubes formed on the Ti surface start releasing into the electrolyte; (III) the anodization process continues until the initial Ti metal foil is completely transformed into TNTs and a white precipitate has been formed; (IV) the precipitated TNTs are thoroughly washed with distilled H2O, centrifuged, filtered, and finally dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. Photographs show the final appearance of TNT powder obtained by the rapid breakdown anodization method. Reprinted with permission of ref. 124.
