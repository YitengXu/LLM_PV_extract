    , Accepted 14th November 2013First published on 15th November 2013AbstractThe formation of heterojunctions is an efficient strategy to extend the light response range of TiO2-based catalysts to the visible light region. In addition to the bandgap edge match between the narrow bandgap semiconductors and the TiO2 substrate, a stable phase interface between the sensitiser and TiO2 is crucial for the construction of heterojunctions, since it acts as a tunnel for the efficient transfer of photogenerated charges. Herein, the coincidence site density (1/Σ) of graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanoflakes and two types of TiO2 nanofibres [anatase and TiO2(B)] was calculated by near coincidence site lattice (NCSL) theory. It was found that the coincidence site density of g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibre with an exposed (001) plane is 3 times of that of the g-C3N4 and anatase nanofibre with exposed (100) plane. This indicated that the g-C3N4 nanoflakes are more favoured to form stable heterojunctions with TiO2(B) nanofibres. As expected, a stable phase interface was formed between the plane of (22–40) of g-C3N4 and the plane (110) of TiO2(B) which had same d-spacing of 0.35 nm and the same orientation. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons could efficiently migrate to the TiO2(B) nanofibres from the g-C3N4 through the heterojunctions. So the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system exhibited better photodegradation ability for sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye than the g-C3N4/anatase system, although the photoactivity of the anatase nanofibres was much better than that of the TiO2(B) nanofibres.
1 Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted much attention due to its superior chemical stability, large surface area, high activity, commercial availability, non-toxicity and so on.1–3 It has been extensively used in photocatalysis,4,5 solar cells,6 UV shielding, paints and cosmetics.7 Among these fields, TiO2 is considered to be one of the most promising semiconductor photocatalysts for controlling environmental pollutants, especially organic pollutants in air or wastewater.8,9 However, TiO2 is only excited by UV light at wavelengths less than 387.5 nm due to its wide bandgap. Unfortunately, UV light (under 400 nm) only accounts for 3–5% in sunlight, which leads to low solar energy conversion efficiency.3,10,11 During the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to modifying TiO2, including hydrogenation modified TiO2,12,13 energy band modulation by doping with metal elements such as Fe, Cr, Co, Ni and Cu14–18 and non-metal elements such as N, C, P, B, F, and S.10,19–24 It is believed that bulk doping or matrix substitution can introduce interior electron states within the band gap and thus shift the response to the visible region. Recently, the grafting of optimal trace silica on anatase substrates can produce surface electronic states within the TiO2 band gap, and thus can significantly enhance their photocatalytic activity for decomposing organic contaminants.25 Furthermore, the construction of heterojunctions by combining TiO2 with other semiconductors with a narrow bandgap is another efficient pathway to extend the visible light response of TiO2-based catalysts. Similar to dye sensitised TiO2,26–28 the heterojunctions are responsible for an efficient photogenerated charge transfer from narrow band gap semiconductors to the TiO2 substrate, which is crucial for increasing the activity of semiconductor-based photocatalysts.29–31 Besides the bandgap match between the sensitiser and the TiO2, the phase interface between the sensitiser and the TiO2 is significant since the interface is the channel which transfers the photogenerated carriers from the sensitiser to the surface of the TiO2 substrate.32–34
Recently, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride materials (g-C3N4) have emerged as a new class of photocatalyst owing to its visible-light driven bandgap (2.69 eV) and high stability. More importantly, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the g-C3N4 is located at −1.12 eV and is more negative than the conduction band (CB) of the common wide bandgap semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, and BiPO4, which is favourable to form heterojunctions with these wide bandgap semiconductors and thus to extend their visible light response. For instance, the core/shell structured g-C3N4/BiPO4 photocatalyst displayed superior photodegradation activity for a MB dye under UV or visible light irradiation than pure C3N4 or BiPO4 catalyst, since the match of lattice and bandgap edge potential between the C3N4 and BiPO4 results in the formation of heterojunctions. In addition, g-C3N4 was mixed with TiO2 to fabricate hybrid photocatalysts via hydrothermal or thermal treatment. These hybrid photocatalysts have displayed high photoactivity for phenol degradation and water splitting. However, only anatase was usually utilised to assemble with g-C3N4 since it is the most photoactive phase among the four common TiO2 polymorphs [four polymorphs in nature: anatase (tetragonal, space group I41/amd), rutile (tetragonal, space group P42/mnm), brookite (orthorhombic, space group Pbca), and TiO2(B) (monoclinic, space group C2/m)],33 and to date no studies of heterojunctions between g-C3N4 and other TiO2 phases such as rutile, brookite, and TiO2(B) have been reported. Particularly, TiO2(B), a metastable monoclinic modification of TiO2, is less active than anatase under UV light irradiation due to the existence of numerous defects, although it possesses a narrower bandgap than the anatase phase.33
In this study, in order to search for a better TiO2 candidate to load the g-C3N4 sensitiser, the near coincidence site lattice (NCSL) theory was employed to calculate the coincidence site density of g-C3N4 nanoflakes and TiO2(B) nanofibres with exposed (001) plane and anatase nanofibres with exposed (100) plane, which could be used for guidance in the fabrication of new nanocomposite catalysts. It was found that the coincidence site density of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system is much higher than that of the system composed of g-C3N4 and anatase nanofibres with an exposed (100) plane, which means that the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system is more favoured to form stable heterojunctions. As expected, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system exhibited better photodegradation ability for sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye than the g-C3N4/anatase system under visible light irradiation, although the photoactivity of pure anatase is much better than that of the pure TiO2(B) phase.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis

Synthesis of TiO2(B) nanofibres. 
TiO2(B) nanofibres were prepared using a hydrothermal method combined with a subsequent calcination process.35–37 In the typical hydrothermal process, 5 g of anatase TiO2 powder (∼325 mesh from Aladdin) was mixed with 70 ml of 10 M NaOH solution. The suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 0.5 h and then transferred into an autoclave with a PTFE container inside. The autoclave was maintained at hydrothermal temperature of 180 °C for 48 h. The precipitate (sodium titanate nanofibres) was recovered, washed with distilled water (to remove excess NaOH), exchanged with H+ (using a 0.1 M HCl solution) to produce H2Ti3O7 nanofibres, and washed again with distilled water until pH ∼7 was reached. The H2Ti3O7 nanofibre product was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The oven-dried samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 4 h in an air atmosphere. Thus, TiO2(B) nanofibres were finally obtained. For comparison, anatase nanofibres [TiO2(A)] were prepared by calcining H2Ti3O7 nanofibres at 700 °C for 4 h.


Synthesis of g-C3N4. 
The g-C3N4 was prepared by heating melamine (Aladdin) in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, g-C3N4 of a faint yellow colour was obtained.


Fabrication of g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst. 
A typical synthesis of g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst was as follows: firstly, an appropriate amount of g-C3N4 was added into methanol (Aladdin) in a beaker and then the beaker was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to completely disperse the g-C3N4. After the ultrasonic process, the g-C3N4 particles were exfoliated to nanoflake structures. The TiO2(B) nanofibres were added into the above solution and stirred in a fume hood for 24 h. After volatilisation of the methanol, an opaque powder was obtained after drying at 100 °C. After that, the powders were collected and calcined at 300 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere to make a firm connection between g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibres. According to this method, different mass ratios of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) photocatalysts at 0.5%, 1%, 3%, and 5% were synthesised and labelled as g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-0.5, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-3, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5, respectively. For comparison, the g-C3N4/TiO2(A) nanofibre catalysts were fabricated by using the same method.


Photoelectrode preparation. 
Commercialized ITO was used in the present study. The ITO glass was of 15 mm × 10 mm in size. The ITO glass was first ultrasonically cleaned with acetone of analytical grade for 5 min, rinsed with deionized water, and then dried with a clean, dry airflow. One longitudinal edge of the conductive side was then carefully covered with insulating tape and the exposed effective area of the ITO glass was 10 mm × 10 mm. 20 mg of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) powder was mixed with 0.1 ml of deionized water and 30 μl diacetone in an agate mortar, and the mixture was carefully ground for 10 min to form a homogeneous suspension. Then, 0.025 ml of the as-prepared suspension was evenly distributed onto the exposed area of the conductive side of the ITO glass. The suspension was then evenly spread over the exposed effective area of the ITO glass. The insulating tape on the edge of the ITO glass was removed after the suspension had dried in air. Finally, the ITO glass deposited with the as-prepared suspension was heated to 300 °C for 2 h under vacuum conditions. A copper wire was connected to the conductive side of the ITO glass using conductive silver tape. The uncoated parts of the conductive side of the ITO glass were isolated with parafilm after the conductive silver tape had dried.

2.2 Characterisation
Microscopic morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI, Quanta 200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai G20). Chemical compositions were characterised by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, attached to the SEM). Crystalline structures were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, DX2700, China) operating with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate (2θ) of 2° min−1 with the accelerating voltage of 40 kV and the applied current of 30 mA, ranging from 5° to 80°. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a spectrophotometer (PE, Lambda35). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the samples were obtained using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Company, Australia) at room temperature.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurement
A three-electrode system was employed to measure the variations of the photoinduced current density with time (i–t curve) of the prepared photoelectrodes using the CHI Electrochemical Workstation (CHI 760C, Shanghai Chenhua, China). The photoelectrodes (1 cm × 1 cm), Ag/AgCl, and platinum electrode acted as the working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.5 M NaSO4. A 300 W Xe illuminator (Peking Changtuo, PLS-3XE300) with a cutoff filter to remove light of wavelengths below 420 nm was used as the visible light source. The electrodes were irradiated from the back side (ITO substrate/semiconductor interface). The i–t curves were measured at a 0 V bias potential.
2.4 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) were evaluated by photodegradation of sulforhodamine B (SRB) in a reactor with a volume of 100 ml under visible light irradiation. The irradiation source is a 108 W lamp (Philips) with a wavelength of >400 nm. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were judged by measuring the loss of SRB in aqueous solution. The initial volume and concentration of SRB was 35 ml and 25 μmol l−1, respectively. Before the light was turned on, the solution was stirred in dark for 30 minutes to ensure adsorption equilibrium between the catalyst and the dye. During the photocatalytic reaction, about 5 millilitres of samples were taken at one hour intervals and separated by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 5 min). The concentration of SRB was analysed by recording variations of the absorption band maximum in the UV-Vis spectra of SRB using a UV-3200PC spectrophotometer (Kamada, China).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Crystallographic orientation relationships between TiO2(B) and g-C3N4
The orientation relationship between TiO2(B) and g-C3N4 was investigated using near coincidence site lattice (NCSL) theory. NCSL is a super lattice at the interface between two adjacent phases and is the structure of the interface. The NCSL is a two-dimensional periodic lattice with a certain symmetry and a certain coincidence site density (1/Σ) which is proportional to the system energy. Σ is the multiplicity of the unit cell. The crystal structure parameters of TiO2(B), anatase and g-C3N4 are shown in Table S1,† where the anatase phase was provided for comparison. According to TEM experimental investigation (Fig. S1†), the exposed plane of TiO2(B) nanofibre is (001) and that of anatase is (100). The calculation of the NCSL lattice between the TiO2 nanofibre and g-C3N4 was conducted based on these crystal structure parameters (Scheme S1†) and listed in Table S2.†
Obviously, the coincidence site multiplicity (Σ) of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system is 7, which is much lower than that of the g-C3N4/anatase system.23 This means that the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system is more favoured and stable. As shown in Scheme S1C,† it can be predicted that a rotation angle of θ = 17.4° must be achieved between TiO2(B) and g-C3N4 phases if the g-C3N4 phase is able to superimpose over the super lattice of TiO2(B). Fortunately, the departure angle of plane (110) and (020) is exactly 17.4°. This is the induced angle between [010] of TiO2(B) nanofibre and [2−1−10] of the g-C3N4 phase, which suggests that a pair of planes parallel and sharing same planar spacing should exist between TiO2(B) and g-C3N4 phases. As illustrated in Scheme 1A, g-C3N4 shows a perfect two-dimensional 6-fold symmetry with hollow tunnels and a lattice parameter of a = 0.246 nm. The TiO2(B) crystal has a C-centred monoclinic structure with space group C2/m and a lattice parameter of a = 1.196 nm, b = 0.374 nm (Scheme 1B). As shown in Scheme 1C, viewed at [001] direction of TiO2(B), plane (110) is edge on and has a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm which is equal to that of plane (22–40) of g-C3N4. Apparently, a perfect planar matching exists between plane (110) of TiO2(B) and plane (22–40) of g-C3N4, which means stable heterojunctions are easily formed by annealing the g-C3N4 phase on the surface of TiO2(B) nanofibres with the exposed (001) plane.

3.2 SEM, TEM, and XRD of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres
The SEM images of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) hybrids are displayed in Fig. 1. For comparison, the images of pure g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibre are also provided. As shown in Fig. 1A, the g-C3N4 sample is composed of lamellar microscaled particles with irregular shapes before ultrasonic treatment. The pure TiO2(B) nanofibres are about 3–5 μm long and 200–300 nm wide (Fig. 1B). When the g-C3N4 was treated by ultrasound, the lamellar g-C3N4 particles could be disassembled into nanoflakes (or nanosheets).38 These nanoflakes could be annealed onto the surface of the TiO2(B) nanofibres after calcination at 300 °C. The SEM image of g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 which contains 1% g-C3N4 is presented in Fig. 1C. Apparently, when compared with the pure TiO2(B) nanofibres, the surface of the TiO2(B) nanofibres in the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 hybrid became rough due to the introduction of g-C3N4 nanoflakes. When the g-C3N4 content increases to 5% (Fig. 1D), the roughness of the TiO2(B) nanofibres in the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5 hybrid was much larger than those of the nanofibres in the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 hybrid and pure TiO2(B) nanofibres. The introduction of g-C3N4 was also verified by the EDS spectra (insets in Fig. 1). The signals of titanium and oxygen elements are from the TiO2(B) nanofibres, the signals of carbon and nitrogen elements can be probed from the spectra of g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 and g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5, indicating that the g-C3N4 has been successfully coated on the surface of TiO2(B) nanofibres through simple ultrasonic dispersion and calcination processes.

Insets: EDS spectra of the samples. The signals of gold and aluminium originated from the coating layer and the aluminium foil used for SEM observation. 

Fig. 2 displays typical TEM images of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 photocatalyst. As expected, the g-C3N4 particles converted into nanoflakes after the ultrasonic process, and these flakes were coated on the TiO2(B) nanofibres during subsequent annealing treatment at 300 °C. Fig. 2A is the TEM bright field image of TiO2(B) nanofibres attached with a small amount of g-C3N4 nanoflakes, and a higher magnification TEM bright field image in Fig. 2B shows a fragment of g-C3N4 on a single TiO2(B) nanofibre growing along [010] direction. The electron diffraction pattern (EDP) of a single TiO2(B) nanofibre was taken [001] direction (Fig. 2C). The diffraction spots could be indexed as (110), (1−10), and (020). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the joint area between g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibre is depicted in Fig. 2D. Its fast Fourier transformation (FFT) provided electron diffraction signals from g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) phases in the joint area (Fig. 2E). The corresponding inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) in Fig. 2F confirmed that the plane (22–40) of g-C3N4 was parallel to plane (110) of TiO2(B). Given that both planes have the same d-spacing of 0.35 nm and the same orientation, the g-C3N4 flakes tended to extend across the adjacent interface and grow firmly within the TiO2(B) nanofibres. This is in good agreement with the calculated results by NCSL theory.

The XRD patterns of the TiO2(B) nanofibres annealed with different mass ratio of g-C3N4 nanoflakes are presented in Fig. 3. Compared with the g-C3N4 nanoflakes, the TiO2(B) nanofibres possess higher crystallinity. So only the diffraction peaks of the TiO2(B) phase were observed from the patterns. However, the diffraction peaks of the TiO2(B) phase decrease slightly with the introduction of g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 3B, the diffraction peak of the plane (110) of TiO2(B) shifted slightly to the smaller value of the diffraction angle with the attachment of the g-C3N4 nanoflakes.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of pure TiO2(B) nanofibres and g-C3N4/TiO2(B) prepared with a different mass ratio of g-C3N4 to TiO2 (Mg-C3N4:MTiO2(B) = 0.5%, 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively). 
3.3 DRS, photoelectrochemical test and PL spectra
The optical absorption properties of the hybrid g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres were investigated by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Fig. 4A shows the DRS spectra of the hybrid g-C3N4/TiO2(B) photocatalysts. As can be seen clearly, g-C3N4 was able to absorb light with wavelength up to 450 nm. The absorption wavelength of TiO2(B) nanofibres was under 400 nm which means pure TiO2(B) could only have a response to UV light. After coupling with g-C3N4 nanoflakes, the hybrid g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres display more efficient light absorption from 400 nm to 800 nm in comparison with the pure TiO2(B) nanofibre (Fig. 4B), although trace amounts of g-C3N4 did not result in the absorption edge shift. This means that the g-C3N4 nanoflakes could act as a visible light sensitiser to drive a reaction on the surface of the TiO2(B) nanofibres. Additionally, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres inherited obvious light absorption in the UV light region from the pristine TiO2(B) nanofibres, which can make up the weak absorption of UV light by g-C3N4. This is crucial for a visible light photocatalyst to efficiently absorb and utilise UV light (3–5%) in sunlight. The photoelectrochemical test (Fig. 5) shows that after the g-C3N4 is attached to the surface of TiO2, there is a clear increase of the photogenerated current density. This further confirms that there is a strong interaction between the two phases of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) hybrid material. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres and pure g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibres are compared in Fig. S5.† The g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid nanofibres and g-C3N4 exhibit much weaker fluorescence than g-C3N4.

3.4 Photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres
The photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) samples was evaluated by degradation of sulforhodamine B (Aldrich). Fig. 6A shows the SRB photodegradation by the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) samples with different g-C3N4 content under visible light irradiation. Apparently, it can be observed that all g-C3N4/TiO2(B) photocatalysts exhibited higher photoactivity than pure g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) under visible light irradiation, particularly the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 photocatalyst. For instance, after 5 h visible light irradiation, the removal efficiency of SRB was 43.4, 56.3, 22.5, and 19.5% for g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-0.5, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-3, and g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5, respectively. The photodegradation efficiency was much higher than that of the pure g-C3N4 (16.7%) and TiO2(B) nanofibres (14.8%). To further depict the photocatalytic reaction, the kinetics of the degradation reaction was fitted to a pseudo-first-order rate law using the equation ln(C0/C) = k, where k is the apparent rate constant with determined irradiation time, C0 is the initial concentration of SRB and C is the instantaneous concentration.39 The value of the rate constant k is equal to the corresponding slope of the fitting line, as can be seen in Fig. 6B. The k value for g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 was 0.1252 h−1, which was almost 5.09, 4.96, 1.58, 3.3, and 3.4 times as high as that of pristine TiO2(B) nanofibres, pure g-C3N4 particles, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-0.5, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-3, and g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5, respectively.

For comparison, the photoactivity for the degradation of SRB by g-C3N4/anatase nanofibres was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6C, the pure anatase nanofibres [TiO2(A)] could decompose 18.7% of the SRB dye after 5 h visible light irradiation, which is higher than that of the TiO2(B) nanofibres. However, the removal efficiencies of SRB of the hybrid g-C3N4/TiO2(A) catalysts were much lower than those of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) catalysts. For example, the most active g-C3N4/TiO2(A)-1 could decompose 35.5% of the SRB dye, much lower than that of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1 (56.3%). Similar results were obtained from the apparent rate constant values of the g-C3N4/TiO2(A) catalysts (Fig. 6D). Obviously, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres possessed superior photocatalytic activity to that of the g-C3N4/TiO2(A) under visible light irradiation.
The photoactivity of the TiO2(B) nanofibres modified with an optimal quantity of g-C3N4 under UV light irradiation was also investigated by the degradation of SRB dye. As shown in Fig. S3,† the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres displayed higher photoactivity for the degradation of SRB dye under UV light irradiation than pristine TiO2(B) nanofibres and g-C3N4. The k values are 1.76, 1.83, 1.73, and 2.03 h−1 for g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-0.5, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-1, g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-3, and g-C3N4/TiO2(B)-5, respectively, higher than that of pristine TiO2(B) nanofibres (1.50) and pure g-C3N4 (0.402). Apparently, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) catalysts still maintain high photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation.
3.5 Proposed charge transfer in g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres
According to the previous study, the bandgap of g-C3N4 is 2.69 eV, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) potentials of g-C3N4 are −1.12 and 1.57 eV, respectively.40 Our recent study revealed that the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of TiO2(B) were at −0.33 and 2.72 eV, respectively.32 As shown in Fig. 7A, the g-C3N4 phase could produce photogenerated electron–hole pairs, when the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres were exposed to visible light. The electrons generated by visible light are able to transfer to the TiO2(B) nanofibres through the interface between g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibres. Given that the photogenerated holes could not transfer to the TiO2(B) phase due to the more positive VB edge of the TiO2(B) nanofibres, the overall outcome of the charge transfer was that the electrons transferred to TiO2(B) nanofibres and the holes were left in the g-C3N4 nanoflakes. The separated electrons on the CB of TiO2(B) nanofibres could be donated to an electron acceptor such as dissolved oxygen leading to the formation of O2˙−,41,42 the holes left on the VB of g-C3N4 could react with H2O directly to yield OH˙ to oxidise pollutants as well. This phenomenon could efficiently reduce recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes, and thus significantly improve the photoactivity of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres in the visible light range. However, it is difficult to form stable heterojunctions between anatase nanofibres and g-C3N4 because of the high coincidence site density of the g-C3N4/TiO2(A) system. So the photogenerated electrons cannot efficiently transfer to the anatase nanofibres through the heterojunction interface, although the HOMO of g-C3N4 is more negative than the CB edge potential of the anatase phase. This is the reason why the photoactivity of the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres is much higher than that of the g-C3N4/TiO2(A) nanofibres.
 Fig. 7  Proposed charge transfer between g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibres through the heterojunction interface under visible light irradiation (A) and UV light irradiation (B). 
If the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres are irradiated by UV light, the valence band electrons in both g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) can be excited. As depicted in Fig. 7B, besides the electron transfer from g-C3N4 to TiO2(B) phase, the photoinduced holes on the surface of TiO2(B) nanofibres could transfer easily to the g-C3N4 nanoflakes through the heterojunctions, since the VB edge potential of TiO2(B) (2.72 eV) is more positive than the LUMO of g-C3N4 (1.57 eV). The photogenerated holes and electrons would aggregate on the surface of g-C3N4 flakes and TiO2(B) nanofibres respectively. These separated electrons and holes could form reactive oxygen species with O2 or H2O, which are responsible for the degradation of dye pollutants. Therefore, compared with pure g-C3N4 and TiO2(B) nanofibres, the photoactivity of g-C3N4/TiO2(B) nanofibres was also improved under UV light irradiation. Unfortunately, the UV light photoactivity of anatase nanofibres decreased with the introduction of g-C3N4 (Fig. S2†). Firstly, the lack of heterojunctions between g-C3N4 and anatase nanofibres could not lead to the efficient separation of the photogenerated charges. On the other hand, the g-C3N4 nanoflakes might block the exposure of the anatase nanofibres to UV light, which will greatly reduce the UV light absorption by the anatase nanofibres.
4 Conclusions
In summary, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) hybrid photocatalysts were fabricated successfully with the growth of g-C3N4 nanoflakes onto the surface of TiO2(B) nanofibres with exposed (001) plane. According to the TEM investigation, the stable interfacial structure could be formed easily since the plane of (22–40) of g-C3N4 and the plane (110) of TiO2(B) had the same d-spacing of 0.35 nm and the same orientation. This is in good agreement with the results calculated by near coincidence site lattice (NCSL) theory. The stable interfacial structure ensured the g-C3N4 nanoflakes were attached firmly onto the surface of TiO2(B) nanofibres. More importantly, the visible light generated electrons from the g-C3N4 nanoflakes could efficiently transfer to the surface of the TiO2(B) nanofibres via the interfacial structure. So compared with the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) hybrid photocatalysts where the interfacial structure was difficult to construct, the g-C3N4/TiO2(B) system exhibited better ability for SRB degradation under visible light irradiation. This study proves the significance of forming stable interfacial structures in heterojunctions, which is a guide in the search for visible light driven photocatalysts with heterojunctions.
