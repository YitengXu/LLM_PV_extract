    , Accepted 8th June 2020First published on 9th June 2020AbstractThe rational design of low-dimensional heterostructures with defects is a effective way to tackle the sophisticated challenge of harvesting solar energy to generate clean fuels such as H2 and C1 products. Herein, we designed 2D/2D La2Ti2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with abundant oxygen vacancies as an efficient visible light-driven bifunctional photocatalyst for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction reactions. Through both experimental and DFT study, a defined oxygen vacancy in La2Ti2O7 was confirmed. The oxygen vacancy mediated Z-scheme mechanism verified by ESR analysis plays a significant role in the generation of clean fuels, leading to H2, CH3OH and CO generation with a much higher yield than that of defective La2Ti2O7 and g-C3N4 alone. These 2D/2D nanojunction induces a rapid electron injection from the defect sites of La2Ti2O7 nanosheets to g-C3N4 nanosheets and prolong the charge carriers' lifetime, thereby leading to high reducing power for clean fuel generation.
Introduction
Solar energy driven hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction from water and greenhouse gas utilizing semiconductor-based photocatalysts is a shining strategy to convert solar energy into high-value fuels.1–5 Potential applications of semiconductor-based photocatalysis require catalysts with a superior solar spectrum absorption range, long-term chemical stability, strong photo-redox ability and high charge-separation efficiency.6–11 Nevertheless, it seems arduous to accommodate all these munitions in a single component photocatalyst. Compared to the traditional type II heterojunction system, a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic system has also been designed to achieve enhanced solar energy absorbing capability coupled with fast charge separation efficiency and enhanced redox ability.12–16 However, a novel Z-scheme heterojunction nanocomposite acting as a bifunctional catalyst towards solar-driven H2 generation and the CO2 reduction reaction is seldom reported. Hence, it is desirable to design a Z-scheme bifunctional photocatalyst for improving the solar-to-clean energy efficiency.
Recently, perovskite semiconductor-based photocatalysts, such as SrTiO3,17 NaNbO3,18 and La2Ti2O7 (ref. 19) nanocrystals, were found to be potential catalysts for solar-driven water splitting and carbon energy conversion owing to their distinct two-dimensional (2D) layered structure and remarkable chemical stabilities. However, like the above-mentioned perovskite photocatalyst La2Ti2O7, the broad band gap (∼3.5 eV) and poor lifetime of photogenerated carriers limit light harvesting in the solar spectrum.20–24 As is well-known, surface oxygen vacancies in perovskite semiconductors can act as photoinduced charge traps and create defect levels between the bandgap, in which the photogenerated charge can transfer to the adsorbed interface of the catalyst, and thus extend the solar spectrum absorption to visible light and even NIR and prevent the recombination of photoinduced charge.25–27 Great efforts have been devoted to clarifying the functionality of oxygen vacancies in the photocatalysis field. Perfectly oxidized surface interacts weakly with molecular oxygen, but oxygen vacancies can easily charge molecular oxygen via the localized electrons, which has been confirmed by a low-temperature STM technique.28 Besides, the water dissociation reaction on the surfaces of metal oxides can also be prominently modified by oxygen vacancies, which enable water molecular dissociation at low coverage.29 Regarding photochemical reduction conversion of CO2 into solar fuels, oxygen vacancies favour the CO2 binding and subsequent activation to ˙CO2−.30 Thus, the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies into perovskite semiconductors may also contribute to the construction of a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system. The defect sites were beneficial to the seperation of the Z-scheme system charges.31–33 Although the photocatalytic applications of oxygen defective La2Ti2O7 have been extended to the visible light region, bifunctional photocatalysis based on La2Ti2O7-based catalysts towards solar-to-energy conversion is still strongly required. More recently, with abundant photoactive carriers and the peculiarity of facile synthesis, graphic carbon nitride has attracted great interest in photocatalytic applications.34–37 Various carbon nitride hybrid Z-scheme heterostructures such as CeO2/g-C3N4, CoTiO3/g-C3N4, MnO2/g-C3N4, etc. have been reported and they displayed enhanced photocatalytic performances in several solar-to-energy reactions including H2 evolution and CO2 reduction.38–41 As a result, a 2D/2D layered nanojunction hybridized with oxygen defective La2Ti2O7 nanosheets and ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets is expected to be a bifunctional catalyst towards solar-to-chemical fuel conversion.
Herein, oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 nanosheets (OVLTO) were coupled with ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets to form a Z-scheme heterostructure nanocomposite as a bifunctional photocatalyst for high efficiency H2 generation and CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. The moderate oxygen vacancies of OVLTO played dual-function roles of enhancing solar spectrum harvesting and mediating the Z-scheme charge transfer path at the 2D/2D interface. Integrated optical and photoelectrochemical analyses assisted with theoretical investigations were performed to evaluate the charge separation efficiency, and the proposed Z-scheme mechanism was verified by exploring the active species and ESR analysis in the photocatalytic process.
Results and discussion
The La2Ti2O7 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies were firstly synthesized through a controllable hydrothermal assisted solid-state reaction by adding NaBH4. Fig. S1† shows the SEM images of LTO nanosheets and OVLTO nanosheets, and it is obvious that pristine LTO is composed of regular nanosheets. Besides, the TEM image displays the typical few layer structure of pristine La2Ti2O7 nanocrystals. Solid-state reaction induced surface oxygen vacancies do not change the sheet-like structure of LTO nanocrystals. The TEM images in Fig. 1a and S2† show that LTO and OVLTO displayed a typical sheet-like morphology with diameters of 300 nm.
 Fig. 1  Characterization of the LTO and OVLTO samples: (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM image of OVLTO; (c) XRD patterns, (d) O 1s spectra, (e) ESR spectra and (f) UV-vis DRS spectra of LTO and OVLTO samples. 
The HRTEM image in Fig. 1b reveals some lattice deformation (marked by yellow circles), which should be mainly caused by the surface reconstruction and the existence of oxygen vacancies in the crystal. A surface vacancy will form once the defect concentration is high enough, resulting in a blurry lattice fringe in the HRTEM images. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns of LTO and OVLTO. The peaks at 21.13°, 28.16°, 29.85°, 32.15°, 40.01°, 46.53° and 58.01° respectively correspond to the (021), (201), (211), (041), (202), (−410) and (223) planes of La2Ti2O7 nanosheets. Fig. S3† exhibits the XPS survey spectra, La 3d spectra and Ti 2p spectra of LTO and OVLTO. The peaks in the O 1s spectra of LTO samples in Fig. 1d can be divided at 530.2 and 532.7 eV, respectively. For the OVLTO sample, besides the above peaks, a new peak at 531.4 eV for O2− in the oxygen defect of the LTO surface is found in the spectrum range, which is related to the oxygen vacancies on the surface of LTO nanosheets. In addition, the EPR spectra of OVLTO in Fig. 1e displayed a distinct signal with g = 2.004 compared with the pristine LTO nanosheet, which could be attributed to the unpaired electron trapped in the surface oxygen vacancy. As shown in Fig. 1f, the pristine LTO showed UV light region absorption with an absorption edge of ∼370 nm, which was consistent with the reported literature, but OVLTO displayed instinct visible-light absorption which indicated that OVLTO had strong solar harvesting capacity, which was well consistent with the colour changes of the oxygen vacancy defective LTO nanosheets.
The oxygen vacancy La2Ti2O7/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were fabricated by facile mixing methods assisted with ultrasonication. The morphologies of the OVLTO-15/CN sample were determined by TEM and analysis. It is obvious that the layered materials (in the red circle) in Fig. 2a are oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 nanosheets, which were covered by 2D ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets. The lattice fringe in Fig. 2b with a spacing of 0.28 nm is attributed to the (002) plane of OVLTO nanosheets. The peripheries of the lattice fringe reveal the lattice deformation, attributed to the existence of rich oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, Fig. 2b displays the distinct crystallographic plane of La2Ti2O7 nanosheets and g-C3N4, which confirms the formation of the 2D/2D heterostructure interface. The composition and microstructure of the OVLTO/CN composite were further studied by HAADF-STEM analysis in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2d–h show the distribution of La, Ti, O, C and N elements in the OVLTO/CN sample, which provides strong evidence that the OVLTO/CN heterojunction was successful constructed.

Besides, the characterization of the g-C3N4, OVLTO and OVLTO/CN samples is displayed in Fig. 3. In the pattern of g-C3N4 in Fig. 3a, two peaks clearly appeared at 13.1° and 27.4°, corresponding to the (100) and the interlayer (002) plane, respectively, for the typical crystalline structure of graphic carbon nitride. The two mean peaks of g-C3N4 appeared in all OVLTO/CN samples. Besides, the characteristic peaks of oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 (marked by black dots) were also found in the pattern of OVLTO-5/CN, OVLTO-15/CN and OVLTO-25/CN samples. The peak intensity of g-C3N4 in the composites became weak gradually, which can be due to the increasing number of La2Ti2O7 nanosheets. It is obvious in Fig. 3b that the absorption edges of the serial OVLTO/CN samples exhibit a slight redshift in the visible light region and all samples exhibit strong visible light absorption. Besides, the FT-IR spectra of all samples containing g-C3N4 in Fig. 3c show bands around 1200–1650 cm−1 due to the CN heterocycles in g-C3N4 and characteristic bands at 807 cm−1 for the vibrational mode of triazine units. Furthermore, XPS analysis of the as-prepared samples was also carried out as shown in Fig. 3d–f. From Fig. 3d, the C 1s spectrum of pristine g-C3N4 could be divided into two peaks at 284.8 and 288.4 eV, corresponding to the surface adventitious carbon and sp2 carbon atoms in NC–N groups. Besides, the N 1s spectrum of pristine g-C3N4 in Fig. 3e can be divided into four peaks at 398.8, 399.4, 401.1, and 404.4 eV, which are respectively assigned to nitrogen in sp2-hybridized nitrogen (N-(C)3), amino groups, and charging effects in heterocycles, whereas, the C 1s and N 1s spectra of OVLTO/CN show negligible differences from those of pristine g-C3N4, confirming the change of surface electron density over the interface of the heterojunction. The O 1s peak in Fig. 3f at 532.4 eV of g-C3N4 is assigned to oxygen derived from the thermal condensation process. However, the O 1s spectrum of OVLTO/CN shows three peaks at 529.6, 531.1 and 532.0 eV, which are attributed to the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancy and surface hydroxyl groups, respectively, in the La2Ti2O7 nanosheet. Fig. S4† exhibits the XPS La 3d and Ti 2p spectra of OVLTO and OVLTO/CN samples. Obvious shifts are observed in the La 3d and Ti 2p spectra, indicating the powerful combination of oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 nanosheets and ultrathin g-C3N4.

Meanwhile, the density of states (DOS) of La2Ti2O7, oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 and g-C3N4 calculated with density functional theory are displayed in Fig. 4a and b. The calculated bandgap value of the La2Ti2O7 unit cell (2.67 eV) in Fig. 4a tends to be smaller than the experimental results because of the restriction of the DFT study.42–44 Of note, the DOS of OVLTO clearly reveals that the oxygen vacancies induce the appearance of a new defect level, which makes the photogenerated electrons easily excited into the CB, thus ensuring higher solar-to-energy conversion. Moreover, it is obvious that the OVLTO model exhibits higher electron concentration at the CB edge compared with the perfect LTO unit cell, which illustrates the higher transition probability of photoinduced electrons and further boosts the solar-to-fuel conversion. From the DOS in Fig. 4b, it can be observed that monolayer g-C3N4 presents a semiconductor character within the middle of the band gap and exhibit a narrow bandgap (1.49 eV), which ensures highly efficient photon absorption under visible light irradiation. Fig. 4c shows the charge difference distribution between single layer g-C3N4 and vacancy exposed OVLTO models. The electron depletion and accumulation in the sites of surface oxygen vacancies on the OVLTO layer are obvious. The cyan and yellow regions show that the agminated electrons migrate from g-C3N4 to the vacancy-rich LTO layer when the interface forms.45–47 From Fig. 4d, the 2D electronic location function confirms the existence of a strong covalent interaction between the N atom in triazine of heterocycles and vacancy sites in the Ti–O layer of the OVLTO layer, forming a charge transfer channel from the vacancy site to g-C3N4.

The photocatalytic HER performance of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by H2 generation and CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. In Fig. 5a, pristine g-C3N4 exhibited moderate photocatalytic H2 generation (157.6 μmol) after 4 h irradiation but the pure OVLTO exhibited no H2 generation activity even when the sample was excited by visible light. However, the serial OVLTO/CN samples show enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production compared with OVLTO and g-C3N4, and OVLTO-15/CN displayed the highest hydrogen evolution (316.2 μmol) after 4 h irradiation, which is 2.01 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) at 420 nm reaches up to 3.61% over the OVLTO-15/CN sample. Such photocatalytic HER performance and corresponding AQY are comparable to some reported results of g-C3N4 based catalysts (Table S1†). Meanwhile, the optimal amount of Pt cocatalyst in hydrogen evolution was considered. From Fig. 5b, the hydrogen generation activity decreases when the loading of the Pt cocatalyst exceeds 2.0 wt% in the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocatalytic stability test of the OVLTO-15/CN sample showed that the H2 evolution performance was stable in the first two cycles. After adding 5 mL TEOA, the OVLTO-15/CN sample showed hydrogen evolution (297 μmol) which only decreased by 6.2% after five cycles. But the hydrogen generation of pristine g-C3N4 lost more than 40% after the cycle tests, which confirms that the OVLTO/CN catalyst possesses superior stability for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. In addition, the effects of the sacrificial agent (CH3OH) in the photocatalytic reaction system were also considered (Fig. S5†).

(f) Products of photocatalytic CO2 reduction in different samples. 
Besides, the solar-to-energy performance of the OVLTO/CN catalyst was also evaluated in CO2 reduction under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. From Fig. 5d and e, the products of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction are CH3OH and CO, two important products. Fig. 5d shows a comparison of the photocatalytic generation yield of CH3OH over different samples under 2 h irradiation. Continuously increased CH3OH production was observed for pristine g-C3N4, and OVLTO. Excitingly, the OVLTO-15/CN sample exhibited the highest CH3OH production (7.98 μmol g−1), which was 8.6 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and 5.7 times higher than that of OVLTO. Moreover, all the OVLTO-x/CN samples demonstrated a higher production rate than single OVLTO and g-C3N4.

Fig. 5e displays the CO evolution yields on the different photocatalysts. No noticeable CO generation is produced for OVLTO, and pure g-C3N4 shows a moderate CO production rate of 3.1 μmol g−1 after 2 h irradiation. The photocatalytic performance of the OVLTO-15/CN sample (5.3 μmol g−1) in CO production is more than 1.7 times higher in comparison to its g-C3N4 counterpart. Fig. 5f shows the yields of CH3OH and CO for samples after irradiation for 2 h. For pristine g-C3N4, the yields of CH3OH and CO after 2 h of visible light irradiation were 0.47 and 1.55 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The OVLTO sample only exhibits the yield of CH3OH, which was 0.7 μmol g−1 h−1. The different product yields indicated that the photocatalytic reactions on the other four samples followed complex and distinguishable pathways for CH3OH and CO formation. And the highest value for CH3OH and CO yields over OVLTO-15/CN reached 3.99 and 2.65 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of OVLTO-15/CN in the CO2 reduction reaction is calculated to be 0.265% at 420 nm. Moreover, OVLTO/CN composites were stable while undergoing photocatalytic CO2 conversion. The activity of CH3OH and CO formation (Fig. S6†) decreased to 91% and 89%, respectively, relative to that in the first cycle. For comparison, photocatalytic H2 generation and the CO2 reduction reaction with CN, OVLTO, OVLTO/CN, LTO, LTO/CN and P25/CN were also performed under the same conditions under visible light irradiation, respectively. As shown in Fig. S7,† the OVLTO-15/CN sample exhibited a higher solar-to-energy performance, confirming that constructing a vacancy induced 2D/2D structure significantly improved the photocatalytic energy conversion activities. The in situ FTIR spectra of OVLTO/CN were analyzed to understand the conversion process of solar-driven CO2 reduction. From Fig. S8,† the peaks at 1506, 1436, 1625 and 1261 cm−1 belong to the carbonate species. The peaks located at 1285, 1325, 1394, 1634 and 1697 cm−1 are ascribed to formate.48–51 The results indicate that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to hydrocarbon fuels on the surface of catalyst undergoes a multi-step process involving intermediate products, which finally converted into CH3OH and CO.
Furthermore, the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics of the OVLTO/CN system could be confirmed by PL, TRPL and photoelectrochemical measurements.52–54 The PL intensity in Fig. 6a is decreased drastically compared with that of pure g-C3N4, indicating faster electron transfer between OVLTO and ultrathin g-C3N4, which results in the decrease of photoinduced charge recombination. This process could be further confirmed by TRPL analysis. After fitting the above decay spectra, the corresponding percentages of lifetime are given in Table S1.† As displayed in Fig. 6b, the average fluorescence lifetime of the OVLTO-15/CN composite is 8.96 ns, which is longer than the lifetime of g-C3N4 (8.28 ns), indicating the prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers in the OVLTO-15/CN composite. This result confirms that effective charge separation can be achieved by constructing a 2D/2D heterojunction system. Besides, photoelectrochemical measurements over the g-C3N4, OVLTO and OVLTO-15/CN samples were performed. Fig. 6c displays the photocurrent response for the CN, OVLTO and OVLTO/CN samples under visible light irradiation. It can be observed that the OVLTO-15/CN composite shows remarkably higher photocurrent density than the pristine g-C3N4 and OVLTO catalysts, implying that the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers is enhanced, which is consistent with the solar-to-energy conversion performance. From the results in Fig. 6d, the OVLTO-15/CN composite exhibited the smallest semicircle radius among the all samples, indicating that the OVLTO-15/CN catalyst possesses the lowest charge transfer resistance.

To undertake the Z-scheme charge separation process, chemical trapping experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis are performed to reveal the active oxygen species to confirm the Z-scheme charge transfer path. Radical trapping experiment in Fig. S9† of photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution was conducted over the OVLTO-15/CN sample. The scavengers Na2C2O4, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) were utilized to capture h+, ˙OH and ˙O2−, respectively. The degradation rate of RhB was reduced to 90%, 49%, and 45% with the existence of Na2C2O4, BQ, and IPA, respectively, which confirms that both ˙OH and ˙O2− species were the dominant active species in the photocatalytic experiment.55–57 From the ESR-˙OH spectra in Fig. 7a, the typical signals of ESR-˙OH can be observed for the OVLTO-15/CN sample, and no obvious signal of ˙OH can be detected regardless in CN. Meanwhile, the OVLTO-15/CN sample displayed the highest signals of ˙O2− in Fig. 7b compared with the signals of OVLTO and CN. The above results indicate that the Z-scheme heterojunction is more likely to occur than conventional heterojunctions under this circumstance. To further investigate the electron transfer path between OVLTO and CN, the work functions of OVLTO and CN are calculated, since the charge transfer process is work function dependent when the two semiconductors come into contact. As shown in Fig. 7c and d, the work functions of OVLTO and CN are 5.26 and 4.11 eV, respectively. The Fermi energy of CN is higher than that of OVLTO. During the establishment the semiconductor compound of the OVLTO (002) facet and monolayer CN, electrons will transfer from CN to OVLTO until their Fermi energies reach the balance, which leads to the decrease of the electron density of CN and an increase in OVLTO, implying the formation of a built-in electric field (IEF) at the 2D/2D interface, which further confirms the generation of the Z-scheme heterostructure between OVLTO and CN. The above ESR analysis and DFT study manifest the construction of a Z-scheme heterojunction system in oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7/g-C3N4.

Based on the above results and DFT study, the Z-scheme mechanism between oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 and g-C3N4 nanosheets is illustrated in Scheme 1. From the results in Fig. S10,† the potentials of the VB of OVLTO and CN are found to be at 2.11 and 1.63 eV, respectively. Oxygen vacancies located at the 2D/2D interface of La2Ti2O7/g-C3N4 can form an ohmic contact and lower the interfacial electric resistance. After being excited by visible light, the photo-induced electrons at the oxygen vacancy defect level will transfer to the VB of g-C3N4, and then recombine with the holes though the ohmic contact. Thus, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 are available to reduce proton H+ to release H2.58,59 Meanwhile, the enriched electrons on the surface of g-C3N4 likely favour CO2 conversion for CH3OH and CO generation. Furthermore, the abundant electrons of oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7 in the CB can also be transferred to the VB of ultrathin g-C3N4, which can be photo-excited by a two-photon absorption path.

Conclusions
Oxygen vacancy induced La2Ti2O7/g-C3N4 2D/2D heterojunctions as a bifunctional Z-scheme catalyst were fabricated for achieving efficient hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction for C1 fuel production under visible light. The optimized OVLTO/CN catalyst exhibited superior performance with a hydrogen evolution rate of 316.2 μmol g−1 after 4 h, which was about 2 times that of ultrathin g-C3N4. Besides, the OVLTO-15/CN sample exhibited excellent CH3OH and CO production higher than those of single g-C3N4 and OVLTO samples. The above experimental results and DFT study together showed that the oxygen vacancy induced Z-scheme charge transfer path was significant for electron transfer and separation at the 2D/2D interface.
