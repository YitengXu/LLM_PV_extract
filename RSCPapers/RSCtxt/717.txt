    , Accepted 16th June 2018First published on 16th June 2018AbstractBiaxially-extended octithiophene-based conjugated polymers are demonstrated as effective polymeric hole-transporting layers (HTLs) to simultaneously enhance the efficiency and UV-photostability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The intense UV absorption contributed from the conjugated side-chain groups of such polymers facilitated its function of UV filtering when serving as the bottom HTL in PVSCs. Through rationally tailoring polymer backbone structure, a highly efficient (PCE: 18.34%) PVSC with much improved UV-photostability and ambient stability was successfully achieved.
In the past few years, the astonishing surge of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has turned a new page for the development of transformative photovoltaic techniques.1–4 In parallel to exploration of the fundamental properties of perovskite materials and their compositional optimization,5–8 continuous efforts at the device level have also been dedicated to simplification of the manufacturing procedures,9,10 scaling up of the device size,11–13 and the improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE)10–15 and long-term stability11,14,16,17 in order to facilitate commercialization of PVSCs.4,18
Among the device engineering interests in PVSCs, exploration of functional charge-transporting interlayers (CTLs) has played a pivotal role in enhancing both device PCE and associated stability19–22 in addition to the evolution of device architecture.23,24 It should be noted that ambient/thermal/photo-stability of PVSCs has been identified as the main bottleneck for their practical application owing to the fragility of perovskite film in response to external stresses.18 Myriads of studies have disclosed the severe degradation of perovskite films when exposed to a highly humid environment or continuous illumination, resulting in decay of device performance. Therefore, rational employment of functional CTLs together with compositional engineering of perovskite materials has been vigorously investigated to address these issues to enhance the robustness of perovskite layers in both intrinsic and extrinsic aspects.14,17
Among the versatile CTLs exploited for PVSCs thus far, organic materials have attracted intensive research interest since they not only possess low-temperature, facile solution processability and flexile structural design, but also have demonstrated promising potential to greatly improve PVSC's ambient stability owing to their hydrophobic nature.19,25 For example, for a conventional n–i–p PVSC, it has been proven that an appropriately designed organic hole-transporting layer (HTL) could form an effective and dense barrier to prevent permeation of moisture into the underlying perovskite layer, thus improving the overall moisture resistance.26,27 Similar enhancement has also been confirmed in the optimal design of the organic electron-transporting layer (ETL) for an inverted p–i–n PVSC.28,29 Moreover, when organic materials served as the bottom CTL in the device, their relatively non-polar features might promote the crystallinity of the perovskite layer above to mitigate penetration of moisture through grain boundary or defects.30,31
However, in addition to ambient stability, exploration pertaining to utilizing organic CTLs to improve photostability of PVSCs has been rarely reported.14 The inferior photostability of PVSCs under continuous illumination has been suspected to partially originate from ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the solar spectrum.32,33 Such high-energy photons seem to beget formation of associated defects inside perovskite crystals to accelerate degradation.32,33 To resolve this issue, the most straightforward method is to reduce UV-radiation intensity coupling into the perovskite layer. Therefore, simply placing a CTL with decent UV absorption at the incoming light site of the device becomes an appealing approach to hinder direct interactions between high-energy photons and perovskite layers.
Based on the above principle, a few functional layers or CTLs with decent UV absorption were recently fabricated and employed in PVSCs to enhance UV-photostability.34–38 For instance, an n-type BaSnO3 ETL with respectable UV absorption was developed to replace the regular TiO2 ETL in a conventional n–i–p PVSC and manifested clear inhibition of UV-induced decomposition of perovskite.34 Noteworthily, the PL emission of BaSnO3 was located within the absorption region of the perovskite layer, which thus realized the down-conversion of UV light to promote the light-harvesting efficiency of the device. More recently, inorganic nanophosphors [(SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+), SAED] and delafossite-type CuCrO2 ETL with broad and intense UV absorption were employed to improve UV-photostability of the derived PVSCs.37,38 Interestingly, the characteristic long-persistent luminescence of SAED endowed the derived PVSC with some capability to store solar energy after illumination.37 Despite these achievements, all the current explorations of CTLs with UV-filtering capability mainly centers on inorganic materials and the exploration of organic counterparts is still lacking, particularly those compatible to inverted p–i–n PVSCs.14
In this study, we successfully exploited low-temperature solution processable organic HTLs to improve UV-photostability of inverted PVSCs using biaxially-extended octithiophene-based conjugated polymers. It was revealed that the conjugated side-chain groups of such polymers contribute to intense UV absorption39,40 and enable UV-filtering when serving as the bottom HTL in the device. Through rationally tailoring the backbone structure of the polymers, polymeric HTLs with both high mobility and decent UV-radiation blocking capability were further developed and employed to realize an efficient (PCE: 18.34%) PVSC with much improved UV-photostability and ambient stability. Detailed characterization on the roles of these biaxially-extended octithiophene-based polymeric HTLs played in enhancing the PCE and UV-photostability of the derived devices were thoroughly performed.
Device architecture of the studied inverted PVSC and chemical structures of the biaxially-extended octithiophene-based polymers, namely, P8TTT, PII2T8T, and PII2T8TSi, are displayed in Fig. 1a. Detailed synthesis of these three polymers has been reported in our previous studies. Thermal properties such as thermogravimetric analysis (TAG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves are presented in Fig. S1† and relevant optoelectronic properties are summarized in Table S1.†39,40 According to the obtained data, all polymers exhibited high decomposition temperature (Td at 5% weight loss) at around or above 400 °C, revealing good thermal stability. Moreover, only P8TTT showed a clear glass transition temperature (Tg) at around 70 °C. It should be noted that as portrayed in Fig. 1b, due to the p-type characteristic of the backbone, P8TTT possessed a suitable HOMO level to serve as HTL for the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based PVSC.41 Furthermore, owing to the contribution from the constituent bulky side-chain group, P8TTT exhibited broad and intense absorption in the region of UV radiation (<400 nm). This interesting feature highlights the feasible design of organic CTL with UV-radiation blocking capability through side-chain engineering. However, P8TTT only possessed mediocre hole mobility of 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, as extracted from a top-contact/bottom-gate transistor (Table S1†), possibly due to weak intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) inside the backbone and unsatisfactory molecular packing arising from the bulky side-chain groups.39 The inferior charge-transport properties of P8TTT might be improved by appropriate doping, so that it can serve as an HTL in the device.

In this regard, we further tailored the backbone structure of the biaxially-extended octithiophene-based polymer with a donor–acceptor (D–A) design strategy in order to realize dopant-free HTLs, where an electron-withdrawing moiety, isoindigo with octyldodecyl(II) or siloxane-terminated alkyl chains (IISi), was used to prepare PII2T8T and PII2T8TSi, respectively.40 As shown in Fig. 1c, the ICT feature of these D–A type polymers was greatly increased, as exemplified by a new characteristic absorption peak at around ∼625 nm compared to that of P8TTT. This feature promotes the hole mobility of PII2T8T and PII2T8TSi to 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table S1†), while preserving suitable HOMO levels to serve as HTLs for the (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based PVSC (Fig. 1b).40 Notably, the broad and intense absorption in the region of UV radiation (<400 nm) contributed from the side-chain group of the constituent donor moiety was not affected by main-chain structural tailoring. Both high mobility and decent UV-radiation blocking capability of PII2T8T and PII2T8TSi thus afford promising potential for enhancing UV-photostability of the derived PVSCs (Fig. S2†).
Prior to testing the efficacy of these polymeric HTLs in PVSCs, the quality of the perovskite layer grown on top was first examined and regular PEDOT:PSS HTL was used as reference for comparison. We herein adopted the solvent-washing technique to deposit the perovskite layer.41 It is important to note that owing to the relatively non-wetting surface of these polymers for DMF compared to that of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S3a†), the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated twice before annealing for film deposition. Fig. 2a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films grown on the studied HTLs, where all samples clearly showed the characteristic peaks of the perovskite crystals.41 Since the thickness of the perovskite layer was almost the same for all the samples, higher intensity of the peaks observed in the studied polymeric HTLs might indicate better crystallinity of the perovskite compared to PEDOT:PSS, which could be attributed to their relatively non-polar nature, as exemplified by contact angle analyses, as shown in Fig. S3.†30Fig. 2b presents the top-view SEM image of the perovskite film grown on the PII2T8T layer, while the samples based on other HTLs are shown in Fig. S4.† As shown in these figures, the perovskite film smoothly covered the entire surface of the polymeric HTL with a densely-packed morphology, validating its potential for fabricating efficient PVSCs.

(b) SEM image of the perovskite film deposited on PIIT8T HTL; inserted image is at a higher magnification (scale bar: 500 nm). (c) Steady-state and (d) time-resolved PL spectra of the perovskite film and bilayered perovskite/HTL films. 
Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of the simplex perovskite film and perovskite/HTL samples were subsequently measured to understand the charge transfer efficiency at the corresponding interface. As revealed in Fig. 2c, all perovskite/HTL samples show conspicuous PL quenching and the degree of quenching followed the trend of PII2T8T > PEDOT:PSS > PII2T8TSi > P8TTT. In principle, higher degree of quenching indicates better charge transfer/dissociation efficiency at the corresponding HTL/perovskite interface.27,29,38 Thus, PII2T8T seems to enable better hole-transfer efficiency with the perovskite than PEDOT:PSS. This improvement can be possibly attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite layer grown on PII2T8T and better interface chemistry at the HTL/perovskite interface.42,43 PEDOT:PSS has been reported to result in severe surface recombination at the perovskite interface owing to its semi-metallic nature and inter-gap states.42
It should be noted that despite higher hole mobility of PII2T8TSi, it showed inferior hole transfer efficiency at the perovskite interface compared to PII2T8T. This deficiency might stem from insulating siloxane side-chain groups of PII2T8TSi, which could impede associated charge transport from perovskite layer to HTL. Fig. 2d presents corresponding time-resolved PL decay spectra of the perovskite/HTL films. Carrier lifetime was estimated by fitting with a double-exponential model, which has been widely reported in the literature.44,45 The faster decay component τ1 was generally assigned to surface recombination, while the slower decay component τ2 was attributed to recombination of free carriers in bulk perovskite.46,47 The dominant, longer component τ2 values for simplex perovskite, PEDOT:PSS/perovskite, P8TTT/perovskite, PII2T8T/perovskite, and PII2T8TSi/perovskite films were 114.51 ns, 18.24 ns, 44.27 ns, 16.93 ns, and 26.17 ns, respectively (Table S2†), in congruence with the degree of PL quenching observed in Fig. 2c. The shortened lifetime basically suggests better hole-transfer efficiency at the corresponding HTL/perovskite interface.
Based on these appealing results, we fabricated inverted PVSCs (ITO/HTL/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag) using the studied HTLs. For a fair comparison, regular PEDOT:PSS-based PVSC was fabricated as the reference device. Fig. 3a presents the best current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the as-fabricated devices measured under AM 1.5 G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2) in both reverse and forward scan directions; related photovoltaic parameters, namely, open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF), are summarized in Table 1.

As can be seen from the table, the PII2T8T-based PVSC delivered superior PCE of 18.34% (measured under reverse scan direction) with Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 21.53 mA cm−2, FF of 0.78, and negligible J–V hysteresis, outperforming the reference PEDOT:PSS-based PVSC (PCE 16.92%; Voc: 1.02 V; Jsc: 21.38 mA cm−2; FF: 0.78). The improved Voc of the PII2T8T-based device mainly contributed to the enhanced PCE, which can be inferred from its deeper-lying HOMO level (∼−5.4 eV) than that of PEDOT:PSS (∼−5.1 eV). The obtained high FF might have benefitted from the increased crystallinity of perovskite layer induced by PII2T8T and efficient charge-transfer at the PII2T8T/perovskite interface, as discussed earlier. It is important to note that the absorption characteristic at around ∼625 nm arising from the ICT feature of PII2T8T does not affect the resultant photocurrent when a thin layer thickness (∼30 nm) is used, although we indeed observed energy loss induced by parasitical absorption while using a thicker polymeric HTL. At such optimized thickness, the intense light-harvesting characteristic of the perovskite layer and the improved charge-transfer at the PII2T8T/perovskite interface seem to compensate for the expected energy loss.42,43
Unlike PII2T8T, the PII2T8TSi-based PVSC delivered lower PCE of 15.15% with Voc of 1.05 V, Jsc of 18.79 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.77. This again suggests that the bulky insulating siloxane groups of PII2T8TSi impede charge transport/transfer at the PII2T8TSi/perovskite interface. Although PII2T8TSi afforded better solubility and higher hole mobility than PII2T8T (Table S1†), this result clearly highlights the significance of side-chain engineering when designing polymeric HTLs for PVSCs. Among the studied HTLs, P8TTT-based PVSC yielded the poorest PCE, with conspicuous J–V hysteresis, which was expected as it possessed the lowest mobility among the studied HTLs.

Fig. 3b compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the studied PVSCs. As shown in the figure, both PII2T8T- and PEDOT:PSS-based devices showed high photo-response across wavelengths from 400 nm to 800 nm, validating the high photocurrent. Notably, despite the PII2T8T-based device recording lower EQE values across wavelengths from 300 nm to 400 nm, it is difficult to conclude its UV-radiation blocking at this stage and necessitates more detailed investigations that will be discussed later. It is important to note that the high-energy photon generally possesses shorter penetration depth into the film compared to photons with lower energy. This enables the thin polymeric HTL at the front side of the device to absorb a relatively large portion of UV radiation. However, photons absorbed by polymeric HTLs seem to not be efficiently down-converted to energy that can be reabsorbed by the perovskite film, which reveals there is still room for further improvement in the structure design. Fig. 3c presents the steady-state power output measurements of the studied devices, which are well congruent with the results shown in Fig. 3a. In addition to the P8TTT-based device, all devices quickly reached a stable PCE after illumination, confirming the good reliability of their corresponding performance. The detailed steady-state photocurrent and power output curves of the best PII2T8T-based device are displayed in Fig. S4.†
As mentioned in the figure, the polymeric HTL located at the front side of the device absorbs a relatively large portion of UV radiation because the high-energy photon possesses shorter penetration depth in the film compared to photons with lower energy. To scrutinize the UV-radiation blocking capability of the studied HTLs, the UV-photostability of the top-performing PII2T8T-based device was specifically examined in parallel with the reference PEDOT:PSS-based device under continuous irradiation by a 365 nm UV lamp (5 mW cm−2) at 25 °C (relative humidity: 50 ± 10%), and the corresponding J–V curves were measured at intervals under regular AM 1.5 G solar irradiance. It should be noted that both devices were unencapsulated for direct comparison.

Fig. 4a presents the UV-photostability results of both devices as a function of exposure time. As clearly shown in the figure, the PII2T8T-based device has much improved photostability, for which the PCE remained unchanged during the testing period, in contrast to the quick degradation of the reference device. Enhanced UV-photostability can also be inferred from the color change of the commensurate bilayered samples, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The color conversion from brown to yellow suggested decomposition of perovskite to PbI2. This encouraging result clearly validated the effectiveness of the PII2T8T HTL in blocking UV radiation.

Inserts are real images of perovskite films grown on different HTLs under aging. (b) Ambient stability test of the devices as a function of storage time at room temperature with relative humidity of 50 ± 10%. 
Fig. S6† presents SEM images of perovskite films grown on both PEDOT:PSS and PII2T8T HTLs before and after UV-radiation aging to better understand the degradation process. As shown in the figure, a discrete morphology of the perovskite film grown on PEDOT:PSS HTL appeared after aging, while the film grown on PII2T8T HTL preserved the homogeneous morphology after the same aging test. The discrete morphology could result from UV-radiation-induced decomposition of the perovskite film as mentioned previously.
In addition to UV-photostability, ambient stability of both devices was also examined, as shown in Fig. 4b. For this investigation, the devices were kept at room temperature with relative humidity of 50 ± 10% without illumination. The PII2T8T-based device retained over 90% of its initial PCE after 15 days, while the PCE of the reference device showed fast decay to almost zero after 10 days. The acidic and ionic nature of PEDOT:PSS HTL has been reported to engender the degradation of perovskite films.42,48 Thus, the enhancement in ambient stability might benefit from the promoted crystallinity of perovskite film induced by the PII2T8T HTL and the more inactive interactions at the HTL/perovskite interface. Fig. S7† presents the characterization of the device's ambient stability by tracking its maximum power point under working conditions after different storage times. As shown in the figure, the result is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 4b, which not only suggests the good reliability of the as-fabricated devices, but also confirms the improved stability of the PII2T8T-based devices.
Conclusions
In this study, successfully manufactured low-temperature solution processable organic HTLs with UV-radiation blocking capability to simultaneously enhance efficiency and stability of inverted PVSCs for the first time using biaxially-extended octithiophene-based conjugated polymers. We revealed that the conjugated side-chain groups of such polymers contributed to the intense UV absorption, thus facilitating the UV-filtering function when serving as the bottom HTL in devices. Through rationally tailoring the polymer backbone structure, the PII2T8T HTL with both high mobility and decent UV-radiation blocking capability was developed to yield a highly efficient (PCE: 18.34%) PVSC. Moreover, this device showed much improved UV-photostability, for which PCE remained unchanged under continuous irradiation by a 365 nm UV lamp (5 mW cm−2) at 25 °C (relative humidity: 50 ± 10%) for 200 min, in contrast to the quick degradation of the reference PEDOT:PSS-based device. The unencapsulated PII2T8T-based device also retained over 90% of its initial PCE after 15 day-storage at room temperature with relative humidity of 50 ± 10%, while the PCE of the reference device showed fast decay to almost zero after 10 days. This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of using organic CTLs to enhance UV-photostability, but also highlights the significance of side-chain engineering when designing functional organic CTLs for efficient and stable PVSCs.
