    , Accepted 21st September 2018First published on 21st September 2018AbstractDespite three-dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) having a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 22%, they are unstable under humidity, oxygen and ultraviolet light. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites exhibit high stability but have poor photovoltaic performance. To simultaneously enhance the PCE and stability of PSCs, we designed new mixed-dimensional (MD) PSCs by introducing HOCH2CH2NH3I (EAI) into (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 3D perovskite. The MD devices made with [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance with an improved PCE of 18.79% due to the outstanding crystal structure, superior surface morphology, enhanced charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. More importantly, the MD devices display markedly improved stability against humidity, heat and UV light. After exposing to about 50% relative humidity (RH) for over 1700 hours (h), the unsealed devices retain about 85% of the initial PCE. After exposing to air at 85 °C for 220 h and exposing to continuous UV irradiation for 13 h, all the unsealed devices retain PCEs of about 60% of the initial value. These results demonstrate that designing a novel MD perovskite is a significant strategy for improving both photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials have shown unprecedented progress with power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than 22%, which have become the hope of optoelectronics and next-generation thin-film solar cells.1–7
However, PSCs face a great challenge of long-term stability, which has seriously hampered their further business development.8–14 It was reported that UV light can cause an increase of oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 to enhance deep traps, resulting in degradation of the perovskite.15–18 When temperature was elevated, the research shows that a metal counter electrode and small molecules in air may diffuse into the perovskite layer and the additives in spiro-OMeTAD (such as Li+ and TBP) could also migrate into the perovskite and react with I−, leading to degradation of the perovskite and declining of the photovoltaic performance.19–22 In addition, when perovskites are exposed to high moisture environment, they may form hydrated perovskite phases, such as monohydrate (CH3NH3PbI3·H2O) and dihydrate ((CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O). Eventually, due to the interaction between water molecules and highly hygroscopic methylammonium cations resulting from the dissociation of bonds among crystal units, perovskites may decompose to PbI2.23–26
In efforts to improve stability of PSCs against UV light, heat and moisture, various methods have been proposed, including: replacing the hole transport layer (HTL) or electron transport layer (ETL), incorporating Rb+ and Cs+, coating photocurable fluoropolymers introducing the additives, and so on.27–31 Recently, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite systems have got wide attention and displayed tremendous advances due to their high moisture resistance.32–35 In 2014, Smith et al.32 reported layered PSCs based on (PhC2H5NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 with enhanced moisture stability. In 2015, Cao et al.34 found 2D homologous perovskites (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4). Subsequently, the 2D and mixed-dimensional (MD) perovskites based on (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 became the research hotspot.34–40 Until now, 2D and MD PSCs made with (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 have shown great PCE and markedly improved the light, heat and humidity stability.35,39
Although these MD PSCs exhibit high stability, the PCE is still low. Therefore, finding a new MD perovskite material which has high PCE and high outstanding stability against UV light, heat and moisture at the same time is the current challenge. In this study, we develop innovative MD perovskite materials made with [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x and use them as light-absorbing layers to fabricate solar cells. The MD perovskite devices show excellent photovoltaic performance and superior stability against humidity, heat and UV light. When the 2D perovskite content is 3%, the device achieves a champion PCE of 18.79% with great crystal structure, superior surface morphology, enhanced charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. Additionally, the MD devices with 3% 2D content exhibit outstanding stability and can retain 85%, 60% and 60% of the initial PCE after 1700 hours (h) under about 50% relative humidity (RH), over 220 h at 85 °C and 13 h under continuous UV irradiation, respectively.
Results and discussion
The MD perovskites all stem from the three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. When large ammonium salt cations are inserted into an inorganic framework to increase the interconnecting distance between organic sheets and inorganic sheets in the 〈100〉 direction, the 3D perovskite will be transformed into the MD perovskite.33Fig. 1a shows the schematic crystal structure of 3D, MD and 2D perovskites. We prepared [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x (x = 0–1) mixed-dimensional perovskite materials. When x = 0 (n = ∞), it corresponds to the 3D perovskite ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15). When x = 1 (n = 1), it represents the 2D perovskite ((EA)2PbI4). When x is other values, it forms the MD perovskite. The schematic structure and cross-sectional SEM image of the [(EA)2PbI4]0.03[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]0.97 MD perovskite device are depicted in Fig. 1b and 1c, respectively.

Fig. 2a–d display X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPb-Br3)0.15]1−x (x = 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%) thin films. XRD patterns of the 3D perovskite and MD perovskite films all exhibit typical 3D perovskite peaks locating at 14.2°, 20.0°, 24.5°, 28.4°, and 31.8° corresponding to (110), (112), (202), (220), and (310) crystal planes. The strong and sharp 3D perovskite peaks without the PbI2 peak indicate a preferential orientation of crystallites. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2a, four MD perovskite films (x = 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) all show strong diffraction peaks around 9.4–9.5° and some evenly-spaced weak peaks which correspond to the 2D perovskite phase of (002), (004), (006) etc. crystal planes. In Fig. S2,† the XRD pattern of (EA)2PbI4 also exhibits the evenly-spaced 2D perovskite characteristic peaks at 9.45°, 17.42°, 25.36° and 33.28°, which further proves the MD structure of [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x. As x increases, the 2D perovskite characteristic peaks become stronger, implying that there are more 2D perovskites in [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85–(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x. Interestingly, as x increases, the positions of MD perovskite characteristic peaks all shift to smaller angles, as shown in Fig. 2b–d. It means that the change of crystal lattice constants is resulted from the formation of more 2D perovskite structures. These results are consistent with the change of UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 2e and f. In addition, the FWHM values of the characteristic (110) peak are shown in Fig. S3.† As can be seen, when x = 3%, the MD perovskite film has the smallest FWHM value, indicating the outstanding crystal structure with superior orientation at the (110) direction.41,42

To further investigate the optical properties of the MD perovskite thin films, we tested the UV-vis absorption spectra and normalized PL spectra of [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x (x = 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%) thin films on top of the mesoporous TiO2 layer which are displayed in Fig. 2e and f. It is found that the 3D perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 films show a strong absorption peak at about 780 nm and the absorption intensities of the MD perovskite films are close to that of the 3D perovskite. Whereas, the absorption positions of the MD perovskite films show an evident blue shift, and the blue shift increases as the x increases. The absorption intensity slightly decreases as the percentage of 2D perovskites increases. In Fig. 2f, the normalized steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the 3D perovskite has an emission peak at 780 nm, corresponding to its UV-vis absorption line. PL peaks of the MD perovskite films also display a blue shift and the shift of PL peaks is consistent with the change of UV-vis absorption peaks. Herein, we also give their unnormalized PL and TRPL decay spectra in Fig. S8.† By fitting the TRPL curves with a single exponential decay function, it can be observed that their TRPL lifetimes are 3.69, 2.35, 1.76, 4.24 and 6.46 ns, respectively. Hence, it can be observed that the MD (x = 3%) perovskite film displays lower PL intensity and TRPL lifetime, which clearly reveal that the MD (x = 3%) perovskite film has higher quality with fewer defects.
The morphologies of [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x (x = 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) thin films were tested using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. 3, the top view SEM images of thin films show that the MD perovskite films have reduced surface roughness and their crystallites are more ordered, comparing with the 3D perovskite thin films. When x = 3%, the MD perovskite films have smoother surfaces without holes and larger grain sizes. However, when the percentage of the 2D perovskite (EA)2PbI4 increases up to 5% and 10%, the MD perovskite films become rough again and a few pin-holes appear on the surface. In Fig. 1c and 3f, the cross-sectional SEM images of the MD perovskite and the 3D perovskite device are shown. The MD perovskite films show more excellent grain boundaries, more regular and vertically oriented 2D crystallites than the 3D perovskite thin films do. Furthermore, the AFM images of [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x (x = 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) films are shown in Fig. S5.† It can be found that the surface roughness of the normal (x = 0) and the MD perovskite (x = 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) films are 20.8, 18.1, 15.0, 19.6 and 23.1 nm, respectively. The surface roughness of the MD perovskite (x = 3%) film is markedly lower than that of the normal perovskite, which reveals that the high-quality MD perovskite film exhibits smoother and preferable surface coverage.

The photovoltaic performance of the normal and the MD perovskite devices is investigated by fabricating mesoscopic PSCs with the structure of FTO/b-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Fig. 1b). The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the normal and the MD perovskite devices are shown in Fig. 4a and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The MD perovskite devices have excellent photovoltaic performance with an improvement in Voc, comparing with that of the 3D perovskite device. Remarkably, the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device exhibits a profound PCE of 18.79%, but a normal perovskite device has a PCE of 16.17% under the same preparation conditions. The enhancement in PCE of the MD perovskite devices is mainly resulted from two aspects. On the one hand, the MD perovskite films have outstanding film quality, resulting in reduced internal defects, faster carrier transmission, slower the recombination of electrons and holes, and improved fill factor with no significant decrease in Jsc. On the other hand, due to the blue shift of UV-vis absorption spectra, the band gaps of MD perovskites are obviously increased which results in an increased Voc, then improving the PCE.

Recently, it was reported that the 2D perovskite devices have a low hysteresis phenomenon. Bakr et al. found that the 2D perovskite films exhibit suppressed hysteresis due to their significantly reduced self-doping concentration.43 Here, we compare the hysteresis behavior of the normal with that of the MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices under reverse and forward scan directions (Fig. 4b). For different sweep directions, the PCE of the 3D perovskite device changes from 16.17% to 14.09%, while, the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device demonstrates a negligible PCE variation from 18.79% to 18.56%, indicating negligible hysteresis. For the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device, we also investigated the steady-state photocurrent and PCE at the maximum power point in Fig. S7.† The result indicates that the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device has a high steady-state photocurrent of 20.17 mA cm−2 and a high steady-state PCE of 18.36%, which is matched with the corresponding PCE of 18.79% obtained from the J–V curve.
In Fig. 4c, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs based on the normal and the MD (x = 3%) perovskites have been recorded to evaluate Jsc. The normal and the MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices all exhibit a high IPCE over 80% from 350 to 750 nm. The calculated Jsc of the normal and the MD (x = 3%) perovskites are 21.97 and 21.73 mA cm−2 respectively, which are well matched with the corresponding Jsc values obtained from the J–V curve. In Fig. 4c, the IPCE spectrum of the MD (x = 3%) perovskite has an obvious blue shift indicating the change of its optical properties. To study the reproducibility of the high-performance MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices, the statistics histogram with a Gaussian distribution of photovoltaic parameters over 30 measured devices is shown in Fig. 4d and S6.† The average Jsc, Voc and FF are 21.45 mA cm−2, 1.071 V and 72.58%, respectively. Therefore, the MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices acquire a high average PCE which has a great enhancement from 15.41% to 17.34%. These results prove that the MD perovskites can improve the device performance with high reproducibility.
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs can be affected by the carrier lifetimes. Therefore, we have detected the internal charge carrier and recombination of perovskite films using transient absorption (TA) response. The normalized TA responses of the normal and the MD (x = 1%, 3%, 5% and 10%) perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4e and S9.† The detailed fitted charge lifetimes are obtained by fitting a single exponential decay function. Clearly, the MD perovskite film displays a longer fitted combination lifetime which improves from 115 to 133 ns, indicating the improved film quality of the MD perovskite.
We also measured the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) to further understand the charge transfer and recombination behavior in the devices. Fig. 4f and S10† display the characteristic Nyquist plots of the normal and the MD (x = 1%, 3%, 5% and 10%) perovskite solar cells at V = 1.0 V in the dark. In the Nyquist plots, there is a semicircle at the high frequency and an incomplete semicircle at the low frequency, which represent the charge transport resistance (Rct) and the recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4f that the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device exhibits a smaller Rct and larger Rrec than the 3D perovskite device, indicating its enhanced charge transport and reduced recombination of the electron transporting layer and perovskite layer.
The stability of PSCs has become the mainly concerned issue for the practical application. Therefore, we carried the aging tests on the normal and the MD (x = 3%) perovskite thin films and devices. In the previous reports, MD perovskites all showed high moisture durability. Thus, we first compared the humidity stability of the 3D with that of the MD perovskites under about 50% RH (see Fig. 5a and b and detailed methods for experimental section). Fig. 5a presents the images of the normal and the MD (x = 0, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) perovskite films before and after exposure to about 50% RH. It can be observed that the 3D perovskite film begins to degrade after 400 h storage and quickly decomposes to yellow PbI2 in a short time in a moist environment. In contrast, under the same conditions, the four MD perovskite films display no evident change within 800 h and have slight degradation near their edge after 1200 h, indicating their remarkably improved humidity stability. Fig. 5b exhibits the normalized PCE variation curves of the unsealed normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices under about 50% RH. The MD perovskite device retains over 85% of the initial PCE after 1700 h due to the reduction of Jsc and FF (shown in Fig. S11†); whereas the PCE of the 3D perovskite device dramatically reduces to less than 30% of the initial value under the same conditions after 1700 h.

Normalized efficiency variation curves of the unsealed normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices (b) under about 50% RH, (c) at 85 °C and (d) under continuous UV irradiation, respectively. 
In addition, we tested heat and UV light stability of the normal and the MD perovskite devices. Fig. 5c displays the normalized PCE variation curves of the unsealed normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite devices at 85 °C (the normalized variation curves of the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S12†). After 220 h storage at 85 °C, the PCE of the MD perovskite device remains at about 60%, but the PCE of the 3D perovskite device drops to less than 60% of its original PCE within 50 h, and subsequently declines to under 10% of its initial PCE after another 170 h. These results indicate that the MD perovskite device has a much better heat stability than the 3D perovskite device dose. The UV light stability of the normal and the MD perovskite devices is summarized in Fig. 5d and S13.† After 13 h of continuous UV irradiation, the PCE of the 3D perovskite drops to 10%, whereas the MD perovskite device maintains about 60% PCE, demonstrating that the MD perovskite has improved resistance to UV light.
To further understand the improved stability of the MD perovskite, we carried out an in-depth study, as proposed in Fig. 6. As for humidity stability, we have tested the water contact angles of the normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite films. From Fig. 6a, it can be found that the MD perovskite film achieved a prominently improved water contact angle (72.9°), compared to the normal film (63.3°). Hence, the MD perovskite film with a high humidity resistance is more favorable to prevent the infiltration of water molecules, resulting in the MD perovskite representing an enhanced humidity stability.

Generally, at high temperature, the performance degradation of PSCs is mainly caused by the internal diffusion of small molecules from metal electrodes, air and spiro-OMeTAD, and the escape of organic components from perovskite materials after enduring the thermodynamic process.19–22,44,45 Here, due to the same structure of the normal and MD perovskite devices, the change of heat stability is mainly resulted from the perovskite layer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of the normal and MD perovskites are displayed in Fig. 6b. The normal perovskite begins to lose the weight at about 275.99 °C which is due to the loss of FAI/MABr, whereas the MD perovskite has a higher initial decomposition temperature at 296.69 °C, attributing to the escape of FAI/MABr/EAI. The higher initial decomposition temperature for the MD perovskite means that it needs more energy accumulation before decomposition and has a long time to undergo heat aging.44,45 That is to say, the MD perovskite is more thermally stable than the normal perovskite. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of the normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite films before and after exposing to 85 °C were performed (Fig. S14†). After the 220 h storage at 85 °C, the normal perovskite film displays almost the complete degradation with an extremely strong peak at about 12.7° of PbI2 and very weak 3D perovskite characteristic peaks. Although the MD (x = 3%) perovskite film exhibits a quite strong β-phase FAPbI3 peak at 11.7° and PbI2 peak, its 3D perovskite characteristic peaks are still very strong without any serious degradation. Therefore, the MD (x = 3%) perovskite device can maintain good photovoltaic performance. The results further prove that the MD perovskite has a better heat stability.
As for the stability under UV light, it has been reported that oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface under continuous UV irradiation will produce deep traps. Then these traps cause decomposition of the normal perovskite devices.15–18 Here, we executed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the O 1s signals for the normal and MD (x = 3%) perovskite films. In Fig. 6c, the O 1s signal of the MD perovskite film is evidently stronger, in comparison to that of the FA film which displays a trifling O 1s signal due to water and oxygen in the environment. The results indicate that there are more oxygen atoms in the MD perovskite, when oxygen vacancies are produced under UV irradiation, the oxygen atoms of EA+ in the MD perovskite gradually migrate into oxygen vacancies and fill them. Thus, deep defects are prevented and the degradation of the MD perovskite is reduced, yielding improved UV stability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have fabricated novel MD PSCs made from [(EA)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85(MA-PbBr3)0.15]1−x. By carefully adjusting the 2D perovskite content, we successfully obtained a high quality film with outstanding crystal structure, superior surface morphology, enhanced charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. Then superior MD perovskite devices with an improved PCE of 18.79% were fabricated. Meanwhile, the MD perovskite devices show superior stability under humidity, heat and UV light. The PCEs of the 3% 2D doped MD devices retain 85%, 60% and 60% of the initial value after 1700 h under about 50% RH, over 220 h at 85 °C and 13 h under continuous UV irradiation, respectively. These findings provide us the possibility of developing highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and are also conducive to the commercial applications of perovskite devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis of FAI and HOCH2CH2NH3I

FAI. 
Formamidine acetate (0.1 mol, 98%, Sinopharm) and hydriodic acid (0.1 mol, 57 wt% in water, sigma-aldrich) were reacted stoichiometrically and were stirred at 0 °C for 2 h. By rotary evaporation of the solvent at 60 °C under reduced pressure, a primrose yellow powder was obtained. Then it was recrystallized twice by dissolving in ethanol, cleaned using diethyl ether and collected by filtration. Finally, the product was completely dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.


HOCH2CH2NH3I (EAI). 
Hydroiodic acid (0.1 mol, 57 wt% in water, sigma-aldrich) reacted with ethanolamine (0.1 mol, 99%, Sinopharm) for about 2 h with constant stirring; the subsequent preparation steps are the same as above.

Device fabrication
FTO-coated glass was sonicated using detergent and ultrapure water, and then rinsed three times with ultrapure water and ethanol. By spray pyrolysis at 430 °C, a compact TiO2 layer which was composed with 0.4 mL bis(acetylacetonate) and 0.6 mL titanium diisopropoxide in 8 mL isopropanol was coated on the FTO. The TiO2 paste (30 nm, dyesol) was diluted with ethanol (TiO2:ethanol = 1:5.5 by weight), and then it was spin-coated on the compact layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After the spin coating, the substrate was slowly sintered from room temperature to 510 °C for 3 h on a flattening oven. 1.4 M (Pb2+) perovskite precursor solutions were obtained by dissolving the stoichiometrically corresponding perovskite powders (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and [(HOCH2CH2NH3)2PbI4]x[(FAPbI3)0.85–(MAPbBr3)0.15]1−x into the DMSO and DMF mixed solvent (DMF:DMSO = 4:1 by volume). Before using, the precursor solutions were stirred at 60 °C for 1 h. Then, the precursors were spin-coated on the substrate first at 1100 rpm for 11 s and second at 4600 rpm for 33 s in an air flowing glovebox with less than 20% RH. Chlorobenzene of 120 μL as an anti-solvent was drop-cast on the perovskite layer during the spin coating step 15 s before the end of the procedure. The perovskites were annealed at 105 °C for 60 min on a heating platform. The HTM solution which was composed of 73 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 4-tert-butylpyridine, and Li+ salt and cobalt(III) salt in 1 mL chlorobenzene was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s on the perovskite layer. Finally, via thermal evaporating, 60 nm of Au was deposited on the HTM layer.
Film and device characterization
XRD patterns of the perovskite and the MD perovskite films were performed on an X'Pert MPD PRO (PANalytical). The 2θ range was 5–70° at room temperature. The perovskite and the MD perovskite films morphology was recorded using a high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland) with a Schottky field emission gun. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) absorption spectra were studied using an ultraviolet-vis (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (U-3900H, HITACHI, Japan). The wavelength range was from 300 nm to 900 nm. Steady-state PL spectra were performed on a spectrofluorometer (photon technology international) and analyzed by the software Fluorescence. A standard 450 W xenon CW lamp with an exciting wavelength of 473 nm was used to excite the samples. J–V curves were collected using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mW cm−2 illumination AM 1.5G. A certified silicon solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) was used to calibrate the setup before the measurements. By masking the device using a black mask , the active area was kept at 0.09 cm2. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a dual xenon/quartz halogen light source (PV Measurements, Inc.), and tested in the DC mode with no bias light used. The wavelength range was from 300 nm to 900 nm. Transient absorption (TA) spectra were recorded on an LKS (Applied Photophysics). The probe light wavelength of the sample was 760 nm by using a laser light wavelength of 500 nm. The energy of the laser device was 150 μJ cm−2 with a repetition rate of 5 Hz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at −1.0 V using an Autolab analyzer (Metrohm, PGSTAT 302N, Switzerland) in the dark and the frequency range was from 1 Hz to1 MHz.
Aging test of films and devices
Heat aging test was done in a container at 85 °C. The container was set at less than 10% RH in the dark. A UV aging test was performed in a container with UV irradiation. The temperature of the container was maintained at 20 to 30 °C using a cooling system and the humidity was set at about 15% RH. The wavelength of the UV light source (UV-Hg-2000, Beijing Lighting Research Institute) was about 360 nm. When the sample was placed at 50 cm from the light source, the UV light source produced about 3–4 times the amount of UV light in the AM 1.5G spectrum. Humidity aging test was performed in the dark inside of a container with 40–50% RH. The temperature of the container was kept at about 20 °C.
