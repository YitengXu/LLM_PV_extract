    , Accepted 16th June 2015First published on 16th June 2015AbstractThe fabrication of pinhole-free and compact electron transport layers is crucial for achieving high power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. In this work, we report efficient perovskite solar cells using ultrathin TiO2 films (5–20 nm) as high-quality electron transport layers deposited by the atomic layer deposition technique. The as-prepared solar cells on FTO substrates show a high efficiency of 13.6%, employing the optimum 10 nm thick TiO2 layer. Furthermore, the flexible cells on PET substrates exhibit an efficiency of 7.2% with low-temperature-processed TiO2 layers at 80 °C. The effects of layer thicknesses on the cell performance are investigated to reveal the mechanism of high-performance, which is mainly attributed to high transmittance, low leakage current, and low charge transfer resistance and recombination rate. Our major findings are expected to provide a guide to design ultrathin compact electron transport layers for efficient perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have attracted intensive research attention from universities and institutes world-wide due to their facile fabrication, low cost and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 In a short span of five years, the PCEs have quickly jumped from 4% to a certified 20%,5,6 which is an amazing progress. Typical device architectures of perovskite planar solar cells are composed of five parts: conductive glass (FTO or ITO) substrate, carrier-selective electron- and hole-transport layer (ETL and HTL), organometal halide perovskite layer and metal cathode (Au or Ag). As a light-harvesting material, the organometal halide perovskite can be described as RNH3MX3 (R = CnH2n+1, M = Pb or Sn and X = Cl, Br, I or their mix).7 The most fascinating one of this family is CH3NH3PbI3, which has a suitable band gap of 1.55 eV for visible light absorption and very long exciton diffusion lengths for charge separation and transport.8 In particular, the mixed halides obtained by partial substitution with chlorine (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) have exhibited stronger optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet region, longer free charge carrier lifetimes, and higher carrier mobilities.9
ETLs play an important role in achieving high-efficiency cells, preventing holes generated in the perovskite or HTL from reaching the conductive electrode to avoid short circuit, and facilitating the flow of photogenerated electrons to the external circuit. They should meet several requirements: high transparency, good charge collection capability, suitable bandgap, and being compact and pinhole-free. TiO2 films are usually used as ETLs, which are produced by a conventional sol–gel solution or spray pyrolysis method.7,10 Unfortunately, pinholes are easily formed in TiO2 films by the above technique. The presence of pinholes in the TiO2 layers severely affects the performance of perovskite solar cells. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used for the fabrication of large-scale ultrathin, uniform and conformal layers in several types of solar cells.11–13 Recently, to reduce the quantity of pinholes, ALD was adopted to fabricate compact ETLs in perovskite solar cells, yielding high PCEs from 8.4% to 13.1%.14–17 Most of these reported solar cells have mesoscopic architecture with a porous metal-oxide framework deposited on top of ALD films, except that Lee and Jung reported a highly flexible planar cell with a 20 nm thick TiOx film.15 Moreover, few researchers are devoted to investigating the effect of TiO2 thicknesses on the performance and clarifying the enhancement mechanism, probably because there is a lack of efficient planar cells based on ALD films. Besides the ETL, the HTL is also important to efficiently extract photogenerated holes from the perovskite layer. Organic and inorganic HTL materials have been developed, including CuI, CuSCN, PANI, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD), et al.18–21 The commonly used spiro-MeOTAD must be kept in an ambient atmosphere for proper treatment or needs to be oxidized/doped by the addition of materials. Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) is a particularly appropriate choice as a HTL because it allows for the full device fabrication in an inert atmosphere, thereby protecting the humidity-sensitive perovskite. Based on pristine P3HT, MAPbI3−xClx planar cells showed an overall efficiency of 10.8%.22 It is interesting to push the efficiency to higher values using pristine P3HT without intentional doping.
Herein, we employ the ALD technique to deposit pinhole free, high transmittance, compact and ultrathin TiO2 films as ETLs on FTO substrates. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and pristine P3HT are used as the light absorbing layer and the HTL, respectively. The cells (glass/FTO/ALD-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/Ag) show a high PCE of 13.6%. It is worthy to note that this is the highest efficiency reported for pristine P3HT (without doping)-based planar cells. The underlying mechanism for their excellent performance is revealed by studying the effect of ALD TiO2 thicknesses on the cell parameters including the morphology of perovskite, transmittance, leakage current and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Finally, a flexible device on the PET substrate with a PCE of 7.2% is also demonstrated using amorphous TiO2 films deposited by ALD at a very low temperature of 80 °C.
Experimental
Formation of the electron transport layer
ALD TiO2 films were deposited in an atomic layer deposition system (ALD, Ensure NanoTech, Beijing, China). Tetra(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT, Jiangsu Nata Opto-electronic Materials Co., Ltd., China) and H2O were used as precursors to react at 80 °C, and high-purity Ar was used as the TDMAT carrier and purging gas. The thickness of the TiO2 layer was precisely controlled by adjusting the cycle number of precursors. The growth rate of ALD TiO2 films is 0.5 Å per cycle. After the deposition, the ALD coated films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 hours. The traditional TiO2 layer was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solution of 20 μL titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Alfa, 99.995%), 10 μL HCl (Alfa, 36.5–38.0%) and 4970 μL ethanol (Alfa, 90%) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 2 hours.
Preparation of CH3NH3I
CH3NH3I was prepared by mixing the HI and CH3NH2 solutions with a mole ratio of 1:1 at 0 °C for 2 hours. After the reaction, the solution was transferred to a rotary evaporator to remove water at 60 °C for 30 min. The CH3NH3I powder was washed with anhydrous ether and recrystallized in a hot ethanol solution three times. Then, the CH3NH3I powder was placed into a vacuum oven for drying at 70 °C overnight. Finally, white CH3NH3I powder was obtained.
Solar cell fabrication
The solar cells were fabricated on FTO substrates, which were washed for 30 min each with acetone, deionized water, and ethyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath. The ETL was coated onto FTO as mentioned above. The perovskite layer was prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 105 °C for 2 hours. The precursor was synthesized by dissolving CH3NH3I and PbCl2 (3:1 molar ratio, 45 wt%) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 60 °C for 12 hours, and then the above precursor solution of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. The HTL was prepared by spin-coating P3HT solution (30 mg P3HT in 1 mL chlorobenzene) at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 100 nm thick Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask (0.15 cm2 active area). All processes were performed under controlled inert gas conditions with a controlled humidity of <0.1 ppm.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi, SU8010). The phase of products was checked by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX-III-B-40KV, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were measured using a Newport solar simulator under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The absorbance and transmission spectra were detected by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302N) under light at 0 V with an alternative signal amplitude of 5 mV and in the frequency range of 1.0 Hz to 4.0 × 105 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the representative top-view SEM images of FTO glass (Fig. 1a) and TiO2 films on FTO substrates prepared by using ALD (Fig. 1b) and the traditional spin-coating (Fig. 1c) method, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a, the pure FTO glass has a highly rough surface owing to the presence of many large-sized F-doped SnO2 grains. Fig. 1b shows the surface morphology of 20 nm TiO2 coated by ALD. The surface SEM images of ALD TiO2 from 5 nm to 15 nm are illustrated in Fig. S1.† We can see that all ALD TiO2 films have nearly the same surface morphology with pure FTO and the typical roughness feature of FTO is retained after TiO2 growth. For a traditional spin-coating process, the surface of the produced TiO2 film seems much smoother than that of pure FTO (Fig. 1c). Through close observation, we can find that a large number of small pinholes exist in the TiO2 film. Fig. 1d shows the transmittance spectra of the pure FTO and TiO2 films with various thicknesses on FTO substrates obtained using different fabrication approaches. High transmittance is achieved for 5 nm and 10 nm ALD TiO2 films. The transmittance of 5 nm TiO2 is reduced only in the 350–450 nm wavelength range when compared to the pure FTO substrate. With increasing deposition thickness, the transmittance decreases successively. However, even for the 20 nm ALD TiO2 film, the transmittance is still higher than that of the TiO2 film deposited by the traditional method. The traditional TiO2 film loses about 10% light in the visible region compared to the pure FTO and 5 nm ALD TiO2. It is well known that the thicknesses of TiO2 films produced by spin-coating are usually over several hundreds of nanometers (Fig. S2†) and illuminated light would be scattered strongly by the thick film, resulting in a great loss of light energy when passing through the film. The above results indicate that ALD TiO2 films effectively reduce the light scattering and increase the utilization efficiency of illuminated light. Meanwhile, the replicated three-dimensional texture provides a more exposed surface area than flat TiO2 films, thus a more effective contact area exists between the ALD TiO2 layer and the succeeding perovskite layer.

Fig. 2a shows the typical morphology of perovskite films fabricated on ALD TiO2 layers. This film is in the reticular form rather than compact. Considering that the ALD TiO2 film has the same roughness as the FTO surface, once the precursor solution was added dropwise onto the substrate, the solution tended to gather on grooves. This means that different amounts of precursor solution would cause different nucleation rates. In addition, owing to the low solubility of perovskite in DMF and the fast crystallization rate, reticular perovskite films are always found when prepared by a one-step spin-coating process.23 To address this problem, a highly volatile and nonreactive (chlorobenzene) solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite layer to control the incipient stage of crystallization.24 After the treatment with chlorobenzene, the substrate was directly placed on a warm table. A drastic morphology change can be observed (Fig. 2b), indicating that the coverage of perovskite is largely increased although there are still some pinholes in the film. We further investigated the effect of waiting time (between the chlorobenzene treatment and the subsequent heating) on the perovskite morphology. Fig. S3† demonstrates the morphology of films with different waiting times (5, 10 and 15 s). Increasing the waiting time can further improve the surface coverage, but some nano-holes are still found. Prolonging the waiting time to 20 s, a compact film was obtained, as shown in Fig. 2c. The phase of the final perovskite film was detected by XRD (Fig. 2d). The strong peaks of (110), (220) and (330) could be exclusively indexed to CH3NH3PbI3, indicating a high quality of the perovskite crystal.

The final cell was fabricated by spin coating P3HT as a hole transport material and depositing a silver back contact. A cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite solar cell (glass/FTO/ALD-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/Ag) is shown in Fig. 3a. The effect of the ALD TiO2 layer thickness on the cell performance was studied in detail and the corresponding J–V curves of the devices were measured under AM 1.5G solar irradiation (Fig. 3b). The photovoltaic parameters, including open-circuit potential (Voc), short-current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCEs, are listed in Table 1. The devices with the 10 nm ALD TiO2 layer show the best PCE, 13.6%, with the highest Voc (979 mV), Jsc (24.3 mA cm−2) and FF (57.2%). For the device with 5 nm TiO2, there is a slight reduction in the parameters. Upon increasing the thickness of the TiO2 layer to 15 nm and 20 nm, PCEs obviously drop to 11.4% and 10.6%, respectively. The devices with the traditional TiO2 layer exhibit the lowest PCE among the five devices, 8.7%, with Voc at 925 mV and Jsc at 18.4 mA cm−2. A remarkable reduction in Jsc for the device based on the traditional TiO2 layer accounts for a large drop in the PCE, which may be attributed to the transmittance loss and the poor perovskite coverage (Fig. S4†).

In order to ensure the credibility of our results, seven batches of samples containing 35 cells were fabricated and tested under the same conditions. Fig. S5† shows the histogram plots of key parameters of these devices. It is obvious that the PCE values of each batch of cells have the same trend and the 10 nm ALD TiO2 cell exhibits the highest PCE. These data indicate the good reproducibility of devices and the robustness of the fabrication processes. The average parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCEs, are depicted in Fig. 4, and the corresponding values are summarized in Table S1.† All the parameters are highly repeatable with a low variation. The curves of these batches of cells show the same trend as the champion group (Fig. 3b), indicating the 10 nm ALD TiO2 cell indeed has the top performance among the five types. In addition, a cell based on the 10 nm ALD TiO2 layer without annealing treatment was also measured and its corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S6.† The values of Jsc and Voc are close to those of the cell with a heating process, while the FF shows an obvious decrease, thus yielding a smaller PCE (8.67%) compared to the cell with high temperature treatment. This is due to the fact that the low crystallinity of the ALD TiO2 layer is harmful for the electron transfer process. Therefore, the annealing process of the TiO2 layer would help achieve high efficiencies. Recently, several groups used P3HT as HTLs and reported efficiencies of 3.8%,25 4.5%,26 6.7%27 and 10.8%.22 Our planar cells achieve a high PCE of 13.6% using ALD TiO2 films as ETLs and pristine P3HT as HTLs.

The effect of the scanning scale on the performance of a randomly selected cell is studied, as shown in Fig. 3c. There is no obvious change in the J–V curves when using different scanning scales, suggesting the good interface quality between the ALD TiO2 layer and perovskite. This scanning-scale dependent phenomenon is usually observed in reported results.28,29Fig. 3d shows the IPCE spectrum of the 10 nm ALD TiO2 cell together with the absorption spectra of the pure perovskite layer and the composite layer of perovskite and P3HT in the wavelength range of 350 nm to 820 nm. The IPCE curve has nearly the same tendency as the absorption spectra of the composite layer of perovskite and P3HT. The IPCE in the visible region from 380–740 nm is higher than 80% and the maximum value close to 90% is achieved at about 530 nm. A rapid decline occurs at 740 nm, in accordance with the band gap of perovskite materials as shown in the absorption curve. An integrated Jsc from the IPCE spectrum is calculated to be 23.7 mA cm−2, which is very close to the measured value of 24.3 mA cm−2.30
In order to explore the origin of the performance difference of cells with different TiO2 thicknesses, the leakage current and EIS were measured. The leakage current measurement can provide us information on the intuitive charge blocking ability of devices. Fig. 5a presents leakage current densities of the as-fabricated cells with different TiO2 films. Clearly, the leakage current density of the device with 5 nm ALD TiO2 is the highest among the five cells. Increasing the TiO2 thickness to 10, 15 and 20 nm, the leakage value exhibits an obvious decrease. The leakage value of the 5 nm TiO2 device is an order of magnitude higher than the 10 nm one, and this may cause a lower PCE. The low leakage currents of 10, 15 and 20 nm ALD TiO2 devices explain the reason for better performance than the traditional TiO2 device.

EIS is a powerful characterization technique for studying the carrier transport and recombination dynamics in perovskite solar cells, from which transport parameters including transfer resistance, recombination resistance and chemical capacitance could be extracted.31 Here we have carried out EIS measurements to further investigate the effect of TiO2 layers on these devices. Fig. 5b shows the Nyquist plots of devices measured at a 0 V bias voltage under AM 1.5G illumination. The impedance spectra are basically formed by two features, two arcs at high frequency and a transmission line at low frequency. For the incomplete cell without a TiO2 layer, there is only an arc with a transmission line (Fig. S7†). Different models have been used to describe the EIS depending on device structures.32 We have used an equivalent circuit (Fig. 5c) to produce a good fit to the experimental data. The model consists of three parallel R-CPE elements connected in series, along with an additional contribution from series resistance (Rs). Considering that there is only an arc in the high frequency range for the incomplete cell without a TiO2 layer and the layers of P3HT and Ag are the same, the left arc in the high frequency range for the complete cell is usually assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) through the Ag/P3HT/perovskite electrode, and the semicircle in the middle frequency represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) at the perovskite/TiO2/FTO interface.33,34 The transmission line in the low frequency range is mainly attributed to the recombination resistance (Rrec) between the perovskite layer and the ETL or the HTL.35 The fitted parameters according to the circuit model are listed in Table 2. The series resistance (Rs) plays an important role in the final device performance, as it has a deleterious effect on the FF.36 The cells with 5 nm and 10 nm ALD TiO2 layers have small Rs of 6.91 and 8.83, respectively, and all other cells have much higher values of Rs. Thus, the values of FF are highest for the cells with 5 nm and 10 nm ALD TiO2 layers. This shows that the cell with the 10 nm TiO2 layer has the lowest Rct2. The thicker and thinner TiO2 layers can lead to higher Rct2. For Rct1, all cells have very close values. Consequently, the cells with 10 nm ALD TiO2 layers have the lowest values (543.6 Ω) of total transfer resistances Rct (Rct1 + Rct2), which indicates a higher charge transfer rate at the FTO/perovskite/TiO2/P3HT interface. Important information about the recombination in solar cells is contained in the Rrec. The cell with the 10 nm TiO2 layer has the lowest Rrec and thus the smallest recombination rate, resulting in the best value of Voc. As such, the 10 nm TiO2 layer cells have low series resistance, charger transfer resistance and recombination rate. We randomly selected five batches to measure their impedance spectra and calculated average resistance values, as illustrated in Table S2.† It is found that the 10 nm TiO2 device has the smallest average value of Rrec, lower Rs and Rct, in good agreement with the trend of the champion group shown above. Moreover, impedance spectra of the 10 nm TiO2 layer device at different bias voltages were also recorded (Fig. S8†). With increasing bias voltage, the arc radii become smaller, indicating smaller Rct.

Based on the above results, the best performance of the 10 nm ALD TiO2 device is mainly attributed to three reasons. First, the film has better light utilization efficiency, owing to its high transmittance. Secondly, the leakage current is small at the interface between the perovskite layer and the ETL. Finally, both the charge transfer resistance and the recombination rate are low. For the 5 nm TiO2 device, although the transmittance is very high, the leakage current is also high. For 10 nm and 15 nm TiO2 devices, their transmittance, transport and recombination resistances are not conducive to their cell performance.
Flexible solar cells built on lightweight substrates have attracted considerable attention for potential applications in the future.37–39 We present a bendable and efficient perovskite cell constructed on the PET substrate using the 10 nm ALD TiO2 film as the ETL, which exhibits a PCE of 7.2% (Fig. 6). The digital photograph of the cell is in the inset, indicating a flexible characteristic. The bending test was performed to verify the stability of flexible devices, and the corresponding cell parameters are listed in Table S3.† We can see that 10 cycles of bending do not cause PCEs to decrease significantly, retaining 94.4% of the initial efficiency. After 50 cycles, there is obvious performance degradation with a decrease of about 39% in efficiency compared with the original value. Considering the high efficiency and low-temperature process (80 °C), the ALD technique holds a promising future for flexible perovskite cells.

Conclusions
In summary, the ALD technique is utilized to prepare a thin and compact TiO2 film on a FTO substrate. A planar cell (glass/FTO/ALD-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/Ag) with a high PCE of 13.6% has been fabricated using the ALD TiO2 as the ETL and P3HT as the HTL. The effect of the TiO2 thickness on the cell performance was systematically investigated. The better performance of the 10 nm TiO2 device is attributed to high transmittance, small leakage current and low charge transfer resistance and recombination rate. The advantage of the ALD technique is further demonstrated by constructing a flexible cell with a PCE of 7.2% based on an amorphous TiO2 layer deposited on the PET substrate at a low temperature of 80 °C.
