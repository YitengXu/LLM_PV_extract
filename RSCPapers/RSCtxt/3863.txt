    , Accepted 31st May 2013First published on 2nd July 2013AbstractIndium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces of triple junction photovoltaic cells were functionalized with oxygen evolving catalysts (OECs) based on amorphous hydrous earth-abundant metal oxides (metal = Fe, Ni, Co), obtained by straightforward Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) in an aqueous environment. Functionalization with Fe(III) oxides gave the best results, leading to photoanodes capable of efficiently splitting water, with photocurrent densities up to 6 ± 1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination. The resulting Solar To Hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies, measured in two electrodes configuration, were in the range 3.7–5%, depending on the counter electrode that was employed. Investigations on the stability showed that these photoanodes were able to sustain 120 minutes of continuous illumination with a < 10% photocurrent loss at 0 V vs. RHE. Pristine photoanodic response of the cells could be fully restored by an additional SILAR cycle, evidencing that the observed loss is due to the detachment of the more weakly surface bound catalyst.
Introduction
Solar hydrogen generation from aqueous solutions is a very attractive field of research, allowing the production of inexhaustible renewable fuel without emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Compared to electricity, hydrogen is a valuable chemical which, in principle, can be easily stored and used when needed either in fuel cells, thermal combustion or in industrially pivotal chemical reactions.1,2
Among the different approaches to solar water splitting currently investigated in the literature (molecular level charge separators and catalysts,3–7 photoactive colloidal systems8–10), photoelectrochemical water splitting employing semiconductor electrodes is one of the most viable and efficient.11–15 The reactions taking place at the electrodes of the photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) are reported in eqn (1) and (2), where h+ and e− are, respectively, the photogenerated holes and electrons. 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+ E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE(1) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2 E0 = 0 V vs. NHE.(2)While the reduction of protons according to (2) is relatively straightforward, water oxidation is a thermodynamically and kinetically demanding reaction, requiring the loss of 4 electrons and 4 protons.16 Photoelectrochemical water oxidation can successfully occur at the surface of illuminated wide-band-gap semiconductors, like TiO2,17,18 WO319–22 and Fe2O3,23–26 by exploiting the oxidizing power of holes lying at the top of their valence bands. However, in these systems the Solar To Hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency is limited by both competitive electron–hole recombination and by the modest spectral sensitivity of these materials, resulting in a reduced amount of effectively harvestable sunlight.
In order to overcome these limitations, Nocera et al. coupled triple junction (3J) silicon-based photovoltaic cells to either electro- or photoelectrodeposited oxygen evolving catalysts (OECs), based on modified cobalt oxides (CoPi).27,28 The combination of the excellent electronic properties of silicon (optimal light harvesting, efficient charge collection) with fast water oxidation kinetics ensured by the functionalization with the OEC yielded PECs (Fig. 1a) delivering more than 3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), with STH efficiency <5%, depending on the sample and the electrolyte.29,30

The 3J cell is equivalent to the serial connection of three p–i–n photodiodes, summing up their own photovoltages. The photocurrent is limited to that generated by a single diode. Holes are transferred to the OEC through the ITO coating establishing an ohmic contact with the heavily doped p region, while electrons are transferred through the n region to the metal back contact. Charge recombination occurs at the thin p–n junctions via tunnel effect. (b) Schematization of the 3J cell used in this work. 
Following Nocera's work, we started investigating the functionalization of indium tin oxide (ITO) layers of 3J cells, provided by Xunlight® (Fig. 1b),31 with OECs based on Fe(III) compounds,20,32–34 obtained by simple Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR).35 Catalyst electrodeposition may in fact result in silicon active layer etching, when biased at positive potentials in non-acidic pH. Besides their well-known catalytic properties in oxidation reactions,36,37 Fe(III) oxides are very attractive materials, also due to their low cost, non-toxicity and environmentally benign nature. The proposed SILAR procedure exhibits several advantages over (photo)electrochemical depositions, since (1) it is fast; (2) it does not require electrochemical equipment or use of toxic chemicals; (3) it can be easily scaled up to large surfaces where defects in the ITO coating and its limited conductivity may cause voltage drops. We report here the preparation and characterization of 3J cells functionalized with OECs, performing water splitting with a STH efficiency of 5.8% at pH 11.2 under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination.
Results and discussion
The functionalization of ITO electrodes or of the ITO surfaces of 3J cells with amorphous hydrous Fe(III) oxides, generically indicated Fe2(O)3−x(OH)x·xH2O (Fe-OEC), was carried out through a number of SILAR cycles (1–10) consisting of the alternated dipping in 50 mM aqueous FeCl3 (10 s), followed by immersions in either 0.8 M NaClO or 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions (see Experimental and ESI†). Catalyst characterization was performed on ITO, as well as on powders, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the ITO surface of a 3J cell functionalized with the Fe(III) catalysts (Fe-OEC-3J) (NaOH route, Fig. 2) show the discontinuous presence of elongated catalyst islands, ca. 100 nm long and 20 nm wide (aspect ratio ca. 5), recalling rice grains. These islands are mostly not in electrical contact with each other, but this aspect is irrelevant to the good operation of the cell. In fact, hole transfer occurs from the underlying ITO surface to generate highly valent (Fe(IV) or higher) species (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†), which have enough overpotential to intercept the oxidation of both OH− and CO32− in the basic Na2CO3 electrolyte, used in the photoelectrochemical experiments. This results in the formation of either percarbonate or peroxide intermediates which finally lead to the catalytic oxygen evolution.38 The coordination of OH− and CO32− ions to Fe-OEC may ensure a higher local surface concentration of these species, enhancing the possibility of successful hole transfer. Furthermore, the elimination of H+ from surface bound H2O and OH groups16 may constitute an efficient charge compensation mechanism (proton coupled electron transfer), which favors the accumulation of oxidizing equivalents within the catalyst. A combination of these factors may explain the observed catalytic effect.

Given the small amount of Fe-OEC deposited on the ITO surface of the 3J cell, in the form of sparse nanometrically sized islands, the structural investigation was mainly performed on powder samples obtained by bulk precipitation of iron oxides according to two precipitation procedures (see Experimental).

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffractogram of the Fe(III) oxide powders obtained by reaction of FeCl3 with NaClO and NaOH. In all cases, iron oxide samples, heated in the 20–200 °C range, are essentially amorphous (Fig. S3, ESI†). The formation of a crystalline phase is induced only upon heat treatment at 300 °C of the sample precipitated from NaClO (Fig. 3b). The peaks at 2θ = 24.1, 33.2, 35.7, 40.92, 49.42, 54.08, 62.56, 64.06 are consistent with the presence of hexagonal hematite.

Raman spectra collected in the 200–1400 cm−1 region show low intensity broad bands, consistent with the mostly amorphous nature of the hydrous ferric oxide powders. In the samples obtained from the NaClO route (Fig. 4a and b), Raman signals are consistent with the presence of hematitic domains at 216 and 283 cm−1,39 and become sharper and more intense after annealing at 300 °C, indicating an increased crystallinity of the sample, in agreement with XRD results. On the other hand, samples precipitated from NaOH (Fig. 4c and d) show broad signals, which remain unchanged increasing the annealing temperatures, confirming the substantially amorphous nature of the material. The presence of a broad and weak band at ca. 650 cm−1 is indicative of the presence of nanocrystalline domains of the magnetitic phase.39,40

The infrared spectra of all Fe(III) oxide powders, obtained by precipitation from either NaClO or NaOH solutions, share similar features (Fig. S4a–f, ESI†). In the high frequency region, a main broad band is observed at around 3500 cm−1 (OH stretching). The band at ca. 1650 cm−1 can be assigned to the scissoring mode of surface bound water molecules (Fig. S5, ESI†). Starting from 1000 cm−1, a number of overlapping vibrational bands contribute to the intense absorption, which extends up to 500 cm−1. These bands bear the main contribution of Fe–O and Fe–O–Fe deformation modes (Fig. S5a–c, ESI†). In general, the observed IR frequencies could be predicted quite well using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Minimal Fe(III) oxide fragments, where two Fe(III) ions are singly or doubly bridged by oxygen atoms and are terminated with OH groups and water molecules, representing various local coordination environments of Fe(III) in the amorphous oxide materials, were considered (Fig. S5, ESI†). Each of these minimal fragments may contribute to the experimental spectrum.
XPS analyses on the precipitated powders and on Fe-OEC modified ITO surfaces (Fe-OEC-ITO) show analogous composition for all investigated samples (Tables S1–S3, ESI†), displaying a Fe2p binding energy (711.5 ± 0.5 eV) consistent with the presence of Fe(III) oxide, and unaffected by thermal treatment up to 300 °C.
Electrochemical water oxidation experiments on Fe-OEC-ITO electrodes and photoelectrochemical experiments on Fe-OEC-3J cells were performed in 0.1–0.5 M Na2CO3 electrolytes at pH > 9, without observing significant differences in current densities. pH 9 represented the threshold below which the catalyst was not stable. The Na2CO3 electrolyte was shown to perform better with respect to other electrolytes based on Na2SO4 or NaClO4 at comparable pH (Fig. S6, ESI†), for which the overpotential for water oxidation was anodically shifted at ca. 1 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The performances were also significantly better than in borate and phosphate buffers at a comparable pH (Fig. S7, ESI†). Although the anodic threshold in carbonate was similar to that observed in the borate buffer, the current density in the former was significantly higher (about twice) at every single pH within the explored range. This indicates that, besides direct water oxidation, the electrochemical oxidation of carbonate to percarbonate (C2O62−), which catalytically reacts with water to form hydrogen peroxide, should also be considered to explain the efficient oxygen evolution from the functionalized ITO.38Fig. 5 shows the anodic responses of Fe-OEC-ITO electrodes, obtained by 10 SILAR cycles in NaOH and annealed at 200 °C in order to improve consolidation of the catalyst and its adhesion to the ITO surface. In the explored pH range (9.1–12), the Fe-OEC-ITO electrodes show a considerable electroactivity towards the oxygen evolution reaction, as indicated by the onset potential (0.7 V vs. SCE) of the anodic currents, which is pH dependent, being positively shifted by ca. 70 mV per pH from 12 to 10.2. At pH 9.1, the anodic onset underwent a more pronounced shift (ca. 100 mV) and a hump appeared at about 1.3 V vs. SCE. This may reflect a change in the mechanism for oxygen evolution, but data at this pH should be taken cautiously, being at the limit of the stability of the Fe-OEC. At all the other pH values, the current increases linearly with slopes of ca. 14 mA cm−2 V−1. No purely diffusion controlled limiting currents were observed, at least at pH 10.2–12 and up to 1.5 V vs. SCE, where values of 11 and 12 mA cm−2 were observed at pH 11 and 12 respectively. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) along the ascending branch of the curve (1–1.5 V vs. SCE) (Fig. S8, ESI†) revealed, however, the presence of a small diffusive tail evident in the low frequency region of the complex plane (Nyquist) plots. Charge transfer resistances of a few ohms were observed and the main contribution to total electrode resistance actually came from the ohmic resistance of the ITO (ca. 30 Ω), which explains the linear behavior of the current density (J) vs. the applied potential (V) characteristics of these modified electrodes. It should also be noted that Fe-OEC-ITO electrodes were nearly completely transparent, with a maximum optical density of 0.04 at 400 nm, this being a key feature for photoelectrochemical applications, resulting in the minimization of light losses through the ITO contact.

Fig. 6 allows for an appreciation of the electrocatalytic properties of Fe-OEC-ITO compared to that of various CoPi modified ITO electrodes, prepared according to literature procedures (Table S4, ESI†).27,28b Compared to Fe-OEC, CoPi exhibits a lower overpotential for oxygen evolution (ca. 100 mV), but the Fe-OEC catalyst displays a much steeper slope, clearly outperforming the CoPi electrodes for overpotential (η) > 0.30–0.35 V. At an overpotential of 0.35 V, well within the reach of the photovoltage generated by a good 3J cell, the anodic current density is ca. 6 mA cm−2 and continues to increase steeply, reaching 11 mA cm−2 at η = 0.38 V. The Tafel slope of the Fe-OEC in 0.5 M Na2CO3 at pH 11.2 is 37 mV dec−1, which compares favorably with the slopes of ca. 90 mV dec−1 observed with the best CoPi obtained in our laboratories and also with the best literature value of 60 mV dec−1 reported for CoPi in phosphate buffer at pH 7.28b It is worth noting that the Tafel slope observed in the case of Fe-OEC is comparable to some of the best mixed oxide catalysts recently reported by Berlinguette et al.,41 which, however, were prepared by photochemical deposition followed by thermal annealing at 600 °C, in a procedure that cannot be readily extended to the functionalization of 3J cells at our disposal.

Inset: logarithmic Tafel plots (log J vs. η) of Fe-OEC-ITO compared to the best CoPi electrode within the explored series (CoPi4, Table S4, ESI†). 
The inspection of the dark J–V curves in the two electrodes configuration (vs. Pt) of either a modified Fe-OEC-3J or a Fe-OEC-ITO anode indeed confirms that a voltage of ca. 2 V is sufficient to drive ca. 6 mA cm−2 across the cell (Fig. S9, ESI†).
In agreement with the good catalytic performances evidenced by the voltammetric results, the plateau (0 V vs. SCE) photocurrent density generated by Fe-OEC-3J annealed at ≤100 °C was ca. 7 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G illumination, but a stable and reproducible photoanodic response, upon sequential potential cycles, could only be achieved by increasing the annealing temperature beyond 150 °C. Samples treated at temperatures in the 200–300 °C range displayed nearly superimposable curves upon repeated scans (Fig. S10a–f, ESI†). The observation that the performance (not the stability) of the catalyst was substantially independent of its preparation route and of the annealing temperature indicated that the presence of a well defined crystalline phase was not an essential requirement to obtain satisfactory catalytic activity. The electrocatalytic properties of these amorphous Fe(III) oxides reside mainly in the achievement of a good permeation by the solvent and in the capability to store multiple oxidizing equivalents, by reaching highly valent oxidation states able to initiate oxidation reactions. The short hole diffusion length, which has been known to limit the performance of hematite photoelectrodes for long range (μm) hole transport,42 is not crucial in the proposed system, both due to the nanometric thickness of Fe-OEC islands, and to the fact that holes do not need to traverse multiple layers of iron oxide before reaching the OEC/electrolyte interface, where scavenging occurs. Rather, holes may re-distribute directly at the OEC/electrolyte interface, following their transfer through the underlying ITO.
Although the Fe-OEC prepared through NaClO and NaOH routes performed similarly, we privileged the latter, since the NaOH bath was less aggressive towards the 3J cell. In this case, discoloration and pitting of the silicon based active layers during the SILAR procedure were not observed, allowing for a higher number of dipping cycles, aimed to increase the surface coverage by the catalyst. No performance improvement was however observed by increasing the number of cycles beyond 5.

Fig. 7 show the characteristic current density (J) vs. the applied potential (V) curve of a Fe-OEC-3J cell (5 SILAR cycles, NaOH route, annealed at 200 °C, red line), compared to an unmodified 3J cell (black line). Both were used as photoanodes in a conventional three electrodes cell, under AM 1.5 G illumination. It should be noted that the 3J cells, provided by Xunlight®, are capable of providing a nominal photovoltage of ca. 2.2 V, and their typical certified efficiencies are in the 6.5–7.5% range. The unmodified cell (Fig. 7, black line) is heavily limited by strong serial resistance, determined by the sluggish hole transfer to the electrolyte (RCT > 1 kΩ), which leads to a modest fill factor (<0.25) and relatively low open circuit potential (Vocca. −1 V vs. SCE), due to extensive electron–hole recombination, as indicated by the photoanodic and cathodic spikes observed along the whole potential scan under transient illumination (Fig. 7, light blue line).

Inset: photoaction spectrum of Fe-OEC-3J in a three electrodes cell, recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) at 0 V vs. SCE. 
Functionalization of the 3J cell with Fe-OEC results in a remarkable improvement of the photoanodic response due to a >30× reduction of the charge transfer resistance at the ITO/Fe-OEC/electrolyte interface, as determined using EIS. A satisfactory fit of the impedance response of the 3J photoanodes (both modified and unmodified, see Fig. 8b and c) was in fact achieved by using the electrical equivalent reported in Fig. 8a, where the two parallel RC elements (CPE describes non-ideal capacitance) account for the two distinct charge transfer loops experimentally observed.

Continuous red lines, fitting curves as a function of the applied voltage. 
Physically, the two parallel elements describe two serially connected electrochemical interfaces, one assigned to the p-silicon/ITO (Si/ITO) junction, the other to the ITO/electrolyte interface. An additional resistance (R1) accounts for the purely ohmic contributions. The addition of a mass transfer (Ws) element generally improves the quality and reliability of the fits. By far, the largest contribution to the total cell resistance is given by the charge transfer resistance RCT2, assigned to the hole transfer to the electrolyte. This is the component that most significantly varies as a function of the potential, and the one which is most dramatically reduced when the 3J cell is functionalized with Fe-OEC (e.g. from 3400 to ca. 100 Ω at −0.9 V vs. SCE, corresponding to 0 V vs. RHE, see Tables S5 and S6, ESI†). The capacitance of the interfaces of the Fe-OEC-3J photoanode at Voc is about one order of magnitude larger than that of the unmodified anode (ca. 10−3 F and 10−4 F, respectively, for the ITO/electrolyte and Si/ITO interfaces, to be compared with 1.5 × 10−4 F and 5 × 10−5 F for the same interfaces for the unmodified 3J photoanode). This is also consistent with an improved interfacial charge separation and accumulation in the Fe-OEC-3J photoanode. The Bode phase plots (Fig. 9a and b) show, for both the Fe-OEC-3J and the bare 3J photoanode, two phase peaks. The one at high frequency is assigned to the Si/ITO interface (570 Hz for Fe-OEC-3J and ca. 1500 Hz for the unmodified 3J), while the other is attributed to the ITO/electrolyte interface (ca. 10 Hz at Voc). Decreasing the reverse bias, from Voc to less negative potentials, the low frequency peaks shift to higher frequencies (450 Hz for the Fe-OEC-3J and 50–100 Hz for the bare 3J), this being consistent with the activation of the interfacial electron transfer. At the same time, the high frequency peaks shift to lower frequencies, resulting in the overlapping of the two peaks, which originate a single and progressively broader peak, as the peak frequencies of the two interfaces move in opposite directions in the frequency scale. We note that the phase peak of the Si/ITO interface of unmodified 3J is always found at low frequencies (<100 Hz), with values close to 70°, indicating behavior dominated by capacitive charging (a pure capacitance would show a phase angle of 90°). This is in agreement with the poor electrocatalytic properties of the unmodified ITO coating of the 3J cell. By contrast, Fe-OEC-3J shows a phase angle of ca. 50°, as the photocurrent starts to be driven across the interface.

The reduced charge transfer resistance causes Voc to reach −1.6 V vs. SCE, while the maximum photocurrent approaches 8 mA cm−2 in a relatively wide and flat region between 0 and −0.8 V vs. SCE (Fig. 7). Notably, the nearly rectangular shaped photoanodic transients (Fig. 7, blue line) superimpose well with the curve recorded under continuous illumination, indicating that losses by charge recombination are minimized. The broad photoaction spectrum (Fig. 7, inset), with maximum Incident Photon to Current Efficiency (IPCE) of 32% at 530 nm, confirms that a relevant fraction of incident photons is converted to electrons in the visible region, where the solar spectrum reaches its maximum intensity.
The J–V curves, collected under concentrated solar illumination (Fig. 10a), showed that the photocurrent recorded at 0 V vs. SCE varied linearly with the incident irradiance, reaching 24 mA cm−2 under 0.3 W cm−2. However, the shape of the current–potential characteristic became progressively less ideal due to voltage drops occurring in the form of ohmic drop (iRΩ) and charge transfer overpotential (iRS), where RS (serial resistance) is the sum of the charge transfer resistances at the two interfaces (electrolyte/Fe-OEC/ITO/p-silicon) of the photoanode. Losses by recombination within the space charge layer formed at the p–i–n junctions could also become possible under intense illumination.43 These effects caused a decrease of the fill factor from 0.49 to 0.25 when the illumination reached 0.3 W cm−2. As a consequence, the photoanodic current at −0.9 V vs. SCE (ca. 0 V vs. RHE) was quickly leveled at ca. 9 mA cm−2 and no efficiency gain could be obtained by increasing the solar irradiance beyond 0.2 W cm−2 (Fig. 10b). This indicates that the PEC under investigation can efficiently operate under natural solar illumination conditions, where the solar irradiance, even at low latitudes and under the most favorable conditions, is ≤0.2 W cm−2, while is not yet optimized for applications in solar concentrators.
 Fig. 10  (a) J–V curves of Fe-OEC-3J photoanode recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) under variable simulated solar irradiance: 0.1 W cm−2 (black); 0.2 W cm−2 (red); 0.3 W cm−2 (blue). (b) Photocurrent vs. incident irradiance, recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2), at 0 V vs. SCE (black squares) and at −1 V vs. SCE (red dots). 
Investigations on the stability of the photoanodic response, carried out under continuous AM 1.5 G illumination at 0.1 W cm−2 for 120 minutes, are also quite satisfactory, showing a reasonably stable photocurrent both at 0 and at −1 V vs. SCE with a relative photocurrent loss of <10%, due to detachment of the less strongly surface bound catalyst (Fig. S11a and b, ESI†), as shown by the fact that pristine photoanodic response could be fully restored by a subsequent SILAR cycle (Fig. S12, ESI†). Devising methods for enhancing catalyst adhesion are expected to further improve the stability of the photoanodic response.
At 0 V vs. RHE at pH 11.2, corresponding to ca. −0.9 V vs. SCE, the photoanode operates close to the plateau region, and the best photoanodes deliver photocurrents of ca. 6 mA cm−2, indicating that the device can efficiently split water. The vigorous evolution of oxygen bubbles from the photoanode is visibly evident (see enclosed movie) and an argon purged electrolyte solution (volume = 30 mL) can be saturated with the photoproduced oxygen after one hour of continuous illumination (Fig. S13, ESI†), during which a stable cell operation is observed.
The faradaic yield for oxygen evolution, measured by combining phosphorescence quenching and polarographic techniques (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†), was 75 ± 3%, corresponding in the best cases to a STH efficiency of 5.8%, consistent with the estimation of the hydrogen volume produced (Fig. S15, ESI†) at the cathode (faradaic yield = 81 ± 2%). Hydrogen peroxide was detected in solution at the end of the photoelectrolysis as a result of the incomplete oxidation of water or of the reduction of dissolved oxygen at the Pt cathode of the cell. It is worth noting that the measured STH efficiency value would be, to our present knowledge, the highest achieved by photoelectrochemical systems based on photoanodes built with earth-abundant materials and simple wet chemical procedures. This value however represents an ideal STH efficiency based on the assumption that the counter electrode at which hydrogen evolution is occurring is behaving as a nearly unpolarizable interface (i.e. an electrode whose potential does not shift appreciably from equilibrium when is crossed by whatever current intensity). Real electrodes always require an additional overpotential to drive a given amount of current across their interface. Although these overpotentials can be small, depending on the nature of the electrode, they are expected to limit the real STH efficiency that can be obtained from the PEC, since they would cause a negative shift of the working point of the cell along the descending branch of the J–V curve. The STH of the PEC is thus expected to be dependent on the choice of the counter electrode, and can be properly evaluated by considering the short circuit current (Jsc) measured in two electrodes configuration. The optimization of the properties of the counter electrode was beyond the scope of the present work, but in order to gain an insight into the magnitude of the overpotentials for hydrogen generation and their impact on the STH, two different platinum counter electrodes were used: a conventional platinum wire (ca. 6 cm long and with a diameter of 0.5 mm) and a large area cylindrical Pt grid (projected area ca. 25 cm2). The latter was selected in order to minimize the concentration overpotential, particularly when the electrode is covered by hydrogen gas. The current (i) vs. the applied potential (V) characteristics of the counter electrodes are reported in Fig. S16 and S17 (ESI†), while the J–V curves of two typical Fe-OEC-3J photoanodes, recorded in both two and three electrodes configurations, are reported in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  
J–V curves of two typical Fe-OEC-3J photoanodes (cell 1 and cell 2), recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) in three (black and red) and in two electrodes configuration, employing a 25 cm2 Pt grid (blue and magenta) and a Pt wire (orange and dark green). In the case of the three electrodes configuration, potentials are referred to SCE. 
With the best 3J cell reported in Fig. 11 (cell 2), the Jsc measured with the platinum wire, in a two electrodes configuration, is about 4 mA cm−2 (STH = 3.7%). This value corresponds to a current intensity of 5 mA, generated by a Fe-OEC-3J having an active area of 1.25 cm2, and is consistent with the i–V curve of the Pt wire counter electrode (Fig. S16, ESI†), which shows that a ca. −1 V vs. SCE voltage is enough to drive ca. 5 mA across such interface. By employing the large area Pt grid, the concentration overpotential is minimized and a large improvement of the Jsc is observed, reaching values of ca. 5 mA cm−2 (for cells 1 and 2, magenta and blue lines, Jsc1 = 5.4 mA cm−2; STH1 ≈ 5% and Jsc2 = 4.8 mA cm−2; STH2 ≈ 4.4%, cf.Fig. 11). These values are consistent with the current density observed near the inflection point at −0.9 V vs. SCE, showing that in this case the counter electrode operates near the equilibrium potential for hydrogen evolution. The linear sweep voltammetry, recorded under pulsed illumination (Fig. S19, ESI†), superimposes well with the curve recorded under continuous illumination, showing that all the measured current can be ascribed to a photoinduced process. It is interesting to note that the Voc obtained with the Pt grid is much higher than that observed with the Pt wire and this seems to be an obvious contradiction. However the inspection of the i–V curve of the Pt grid (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†) shows that, due to the large area of the electrode, a current of few hundreds μA can be sustained even at potentials much lower than that of hydrogen evolution, i.e. in the range between 0 and −0.5 V vs. SCE. This can be due to side reactions with dissolved oxygen (produced, for example, at the photoanode) or with other minor impurities in the electrolyte. Thus, when the current progressively decreases during the potential sweep of the PEC, the potential of the Pt grid is able to shift, according to its own i–V characteristic, adjusting to the new values required by the current density which is flowing across the cell. In other words, most of the potential drop occurs in this case at the photoanode of the PEC.
However, the use of large area Pt electrodes is an impractical choice for the realization of a PEC based on cheap materials, nonetheless it is a useful proof of principle to show that Fe-OEC-3J photoanodes can efficiently operate when coupled to counter electrodes made of suitable materials, any of which can be wired to the photoanode without requiring chemical or structural modification of this latter. For example, electrodes displaying high activity for hydrogen evolution, based on inexpensive metal sulfides,44 eventually coupled to conductive carbon nanostructures,45 were recently investigated and proposed as a viable alternative to noble metals for electrochemical proton reduction.
Although our main interest was the investigation of ITO functionalization with Fe-OEC, which, incidentally, showed the highest photoelectrochemical performance, an entirely analogous chemical procedure (dipping in the Mn+ solution, followed by reaction with NaClO) was successfully applied to the functionalization of ITO surfaces with transparent coatings of cobalt and nickel oxides, which also showed a noticeable catalytic activity towards water oxidation (Fig. S20a, b and S21a, b, ESI†). Thus, the described approach may constitute a convenient general route towards the viable realization of efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting devices based on earth-abundant materials and fabricated with fast and straightforward procedures.
Conclusions
The functionalization of ITO surfaces by exploiting fast ionic reactions in aqueous media led to the in situ formation of transparent discontinuous nanometric layers of first row transition metal (Fe, Ni, Co) oxides, exhibiting good catalytic properties towards oxygen evolution in a basic environment. Indeed, the Fe-OEC modified ITO electrodes displayed a noticeable electroactivity towards water oxidation in 0.5 M Na2CO3 solutions, with onset potential for water oxidation at ca. 0.7 V vs. SCE and a J–V slope of >10 mA cm−2 V−1. In agreement with these interesting electrocatalytic properties, the best Fe-OEC modified triple junction cells performed water splitting with promising photoanodic stability and STH conversion efficiency of the order of 4–5% in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2), among the highest achieved by photoelectrochemical systems based on photoanodes built with earth-abundant materials and simple chemical procedures. These STH values are less than one half of the record efficiency which, to our knowledge, is still held by Khaselev and Turner,46 who reached STH > 12% with an epitaxially grown multijunction cell based on GaInP2/GaAs. Another efficient system, proposed by Lewis et al.,47 displays a STH ≈ 6%, employing double junction Si microarrays in sulfuric acid medium.
Further improvements in both stability and efficiency of these photoelectrochemical cells will be pursued by devising methods for improving catalyst adhesion and enhancing the active area, by exploiting porous transparent conductive oxides or non-conductive templates. Therefore, the outlined approach may constitute a promising and convenient general route towards the viable realization of efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting cells, fabricated with photovoltaic devices functionalized with abundant and harmless catalysts through simple and easy to scale procedures.
Experimental
Materials
FeCl3 hydrate (>99%), NiCl2·6H2O (99.3%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98%), sodium hypochlorite solution (10–15%) and sodium hydroxide (98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous sodium carbonate (99.5%) was purchased by Carlo Erba. ITO coated glass was obtained by Delta Technologies. 3J cells based on amorphous silicon were obtained from Xunlight®.
Functionalization of ITO electrodes with OECs based on metal oxide
ITO coated glass slides (ca. 1 × 3 cm) were cleaned with distilled water and acetone, to remove salts and grease contaminants before functionalization with the desired compounds. Each SILAR cycle consisted of an immersion (10 s) in a freshly prepared 50 mM aqueous solution of Mn+ (Mn+ = Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+) followed by a dipping (10 s) in either 0.8 M NaClO (in the case of Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+) or 0.1 M NaOH (in the case of Fe3+). After each cycle, the electrode was rinsed with distilled water in order to remove macroscopic agglomerates and weakly surface bound material. Typically, 10 repeated SILAR cycles led to the visible (at the bare eye) formation of a dark brown deposit (in the case of Ni2+ and Co2+) and of a much less evident red-orange film in the case of Fe3+. The resulting electrodes were annealed in air either at 200 °C (Fe3+) or at 300 °C (Fe3+, Ni2+, Co2+) for 15 minutes. Following thermal annealing, the color of Ni2+-treated electrodes faded, consistent with the thermal decomposition of NiOOH to NiO,48 showing a residual brownish color. By contrast, the color of the Fe3+ and Co2+ treated electrodes was substantially unchanged.
Functionalization of the triple junction cell with OEC based on Fe(III) hydrous oxides (Fe-OEC-3J)
The ITO surface of the 3J cell was functionalized with amorphous hydrous Fe(III) oxides through SILAR cycles, using either NaClO or NaOH.

NaClO route. 
The 3J cell was immersed in a 50 mM aqueous solution of FeCl3 for 10 s, then dipped in 0.8 M NaClO solution at pH 13 (for further 10 s) and finally rinsed with water. The NaClO solution appeared to be aggressive towards the 3J cell, as evidenced by some discoloration and pitting of the active layer at the edges of the cell, where the solution could come into contact with the photoactive materials through defects in the ITO coating. Therefore, the number of SILAR cycles was limited to just 1. The resulting cell was heated at either 200 °C or 300 °C in air for 1 hour.


NaOH route. 
The 3J cell was alternately dipped in 50 mM FeCl3 and 0.1 M NaOH (pH 13) aqueous solutions five times. After each cycle, the cell was rinsed with water, then it was finally heated at either 200 °C or 300 °C in air for 1 hour.
Analogous procedures were employed for the functionalization of ITO electrodes with Fe(III) oxides and of both ITO and 3J cells with Ni(II) and Co(III) oxides (see ESI†).

Preparation of hydrous Fe(III) oxide powders
Massive precipitation of hydrous Fe(III) oxides was performed by dropping 2.5 M NaClO (or 1 M NaOH) in a saturated FeCl3 aqueous solution. The precipitate was collected by filtration on a sintered glass frit, washed with water (in order to remove the excess of salts) and dried under vacuum. The dried solids were then heated at different temperatures for 1 hour.
Analytical measurements
SEM microscopy
Morphology of the photoanodes was characterized using a field-effect scanning electron microscope FE-SEM JEOL JSM 7600f, with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and SEM ZEISS EVO 40.
XRD analyses
X-ray diffractograms were acquired using a Bruker AXS Advance diffractometer by using the Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å) and exploring an interval 10° < 2θ < 80° with a step size of 0.02° and a step time of 1 s.
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra of the samples were acquired using an Olympus BXFM microscope coupled to a LabRam HR800 spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) fitted with an air-cooled CCD detector (1024 × 256 pixels) at −70 °C. The spectrometer had a focal length of 800 mm and was equipped with two 600 and 1800 grooves per mm of gratings. Raman spectra were recorded using a He–Ne laser as an excitation source with a wavelength of 632.81 nm. The laser beam diameter was about 1 mm and the resolution of the spectrometer was about 2 cm−1. The laser power was always kept between 0.02 and 0.2 mW and the exposure time varied between 5 and 10 seconds with 10 accumulations. Spectra were recorded by placing the samples on the X-Y motorized stage and observing them with 50× objective. The spectrometer was calibrated and checked with silicon at 520 cm−1. The removal of spikes of cosmic rays and baseline correction (for fluorescence background subtraction) were performed using LabSpec 5 software.
IR spectroscopy
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 320 spectrometer, operating in transmittance mode. Iron oxide powders were dispersed in KBr pellets.
Computational methods
Quantum-mechanical calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09. Since the ferric oxides were mostly amorphous, the frequency calculation was carried out on minimal units of general formula Fe2O3 terminated with OH groups or with coordinated water molecules, corresponding to various reasonable local coordination environments of Fe in the amorphous material. These fragments were optimized at the ground state at the DFT/B3LYP level with a Lan2DZ basis set. Frequency calculations were carried out on the geometry optimized fragments by using a 6311 G+,d basis set and the B3LYP hybrid functional. The computed spectra were generally in good agreement with the experimentally measured ones.
XPS analyses
X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded using a PHI-5500–Physical electronics spectrometer, equipped with a monochromatized source with an Al anode (Kα = 1486.6 eV), operating at 200 W of applied power, 5.85 eV pass energy, and 0.05 eV energy-step. XPS spectra were collected at take-off angles of 45°. The analyzed area is around 0.5 mm2 and the sampling depth is within 10 nm. During measurements the vacuum level was around 10−9 Torr residue pressure. The spectrometer was calibrated assuming the Ag(3d 5/2) binding energy (BE) at 368.3 eV with respect to the Fermi-level and the measured full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) was 0.46 eV. In order to neutralize the surface electrostatic charge of non-conductive samples, an electron gun was used. Furthermore, the charging effect on the analysis was also corrected considering the BE value of C(1s), due to adventitious carbon, at 284.8 eV. The BEs were measured at the maximum of the peaks without any baseline subtraction.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Linear sweep voltammetries of ITO electrodes, functionalized with water oxidation catalysts (OEC-ITO), were measured in three electrodes cells (OEC-ITO/Pt/SCE) at a scan speed of 20 mV s−1 by using either an Eco Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 302/N or PGSTAT 30 electrochemical workstation. J–V curves in a two electrodes arrangement (10 mV s−1) were measured against a platinum counter electrode, either a large area Pt grid or a Pt wire. Before each measurement the Pt counter electrodes were fired on a Bunsen burner to remove any trace of impurities. Cyclic voltammetries were typically recorded at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1 in either aqueous 0.1 M Na2CO3 or in 0.1 M LiClO4 in CH3CN. All triple junction cells were protected at the edges and at the steeled back contact with solvent resistant tape (KAPTON), in order to prevent the direct contact between the electrolyte and the silicon active layer in regions were discontinuities and micro-cracks of ITO could have caused solvent leakage underneath it. The 3J cells, whose active area was typically 1.8 cm2, were clamped with a copper tape and used as photoanodes in a three electrodes electrochemical cell, equipped with reference (SCE) and counter (platinum) electrodes, in the presence of 0.5 M Na2CO3. The photoelectrodes were irradiated using an ABET solar simulator (AM 1.5 G) under an incident irradiance of 0.1 W cm−2, measured using a Molectron Powermax 500 power-meter. J–V curves were collected at a scan speed of 20 mV s−1 by scanning the reverse bias region between 0 V and the open circuit photovoltage. Shuttered J–V curves were obtained under identical conditions by using an Oriel manual shutter.
Impedance data under illumination were collected using a FRA2.v10 frequency response analyzer in the 105–0.5 Hz by applying a sinusoidal perturbation (single sine) of the amplitude of 10 mV.
Monochromatic photoaction spectra (IPCE vs. wavelength) were recorded in a three electrodes cell (Fe-OEC-3J/Pt/SCE) at 0 V vs. SCE (photoanodic plateau region) under the monochromatic illumination generated by an Applied Photophysics Monochromator (bandwidth 10 nm) coupled to a 175 W Xe lamp (Luxtel). In order to ensure the simultaneous excitation of the 3 junctions with monochromatic light, a white light bias ca. 0.02 W cm−2 was superimposed to the intense monochromatic excitation amounting to an integrated irradiance of 0.6 W cm−2 in the 390–790 nm interval. The photoanodic current was recorded at each wavelength (20 nm steps) on a PGSTAT 30 electrochemical workstation and the monochromatic excitation was pulsed in order to allow for an easy subtraction of the background due to the lower intensity white light bias. The incident monochromatic irradiance was measured with a calibrated silicon photodiode (Centronic OSD100-7Q). IPCE was calculated according to:  where J is the photocurrent density at the wavelength λ and P is the incident radiant power.
Determination of photoproduced O2 and H2, and of the STH conversion efficiency
Electrochemical cells containing a Fe-OEC-3J as a working electrode, the reference (SCE) and counter (platinum) electrodes were sealed and purged with argon. Evolved oxygen collected in the head-space was measured by chronoamperometric experiments of the duration of 1 hour (at 0 V vs. SCE) by means of a calibrated Ocean Optics (FOXY R-AF) oxygen sensor equipped with a temperature probe. A dark control run of identical duration (1 hour) determined the amount of atmospheric oxygen which diffused into the cell through imperfections of the sealing. The photoproduced oxygen was determined by subtracting the dark background.
The amount of oxygen dissolved in solution was determined using a polarographic sensor (Crison Oxi 45+) calibrated in air saturated water by following a single point procedure.
Faradaic efficiency was calculated taking into account the total charge passed during the experiment (1 hour) and the molar amount of O2 produced.
Evolved hydrogen was collected in a 1 mL pneumatic syringe and the molar amount was calculated by using the ideal gas equation at 300 K.
The Solar To Hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency was calculated according to:  where Jsc represents the short circuit photocurrent density and η is the faradaic efficiency.
The presence of peroxides was detected using a starch–iodide indicator paper (Carlo Erba).

The 3J cell is equivalent to the serial connection of three p–i–n photodiodes, summing up their own photovoltages. The photocurrent is limited to that generated by a single diode. Holes are transferred to the OEC through the ITO coating establishing an ohmic contact with the heavily doped p region, while electrons are transferred through the n region to the metal back contact. Charge recombination occurs at the thin p–n junctions via tunnel effect. (b) Schematization of the 3J cell used in this work.

Inset: photoaction spectrum of Fe-OEC-3J in a three electrodes cell, recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) at 0 V vs. SCE.	 

 	Fig. 8  Electrical equivalent of the 3J photoanode (a) and Nyquist plots of the Fe-OEC-3J (5 SILAR cycles, NaOH route) (b), compared to the unmodified 3J cell (c), recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2), under AM 1.5 G illumination. Continuous red lines, fitting curves as a function of the applied voltage.	 

 	Fig. 9  Bode phase plots of the unmodified 3J photoanode (a) compared to the Fe-OEC-3J (b), biased from Voc to the potential at which the limiting photocurrent is observed. Same photoanodes of Fig. 7, in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2).	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) J–V curves of Fe-OEC-3J photoanode recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) under variable simulated solar irradiance: 0.1 W cm−2 (black); 0.2 W cm−2 (red); 0.3 W cm−2 (blue). (b) Photocurrent vs. incident irradiance, recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2), at 0 V vs. SCE (black squares) and at −1 V vs. SCE (red dots).	 

 	Fig. 11  
J–V curves of two typical Fe-OEC-3J photoanodes (cell 1 and cell 2), recorded in 0.5 M Na2CO3 (pH 11.2) in three (black and red) and in two electrodes configuration, employing a 25 cm2 Pt grid (blue and magenta) and a Pt wire (orange and dark green). In the case of the three electrodes configuration, potentials are referred to SCE.
