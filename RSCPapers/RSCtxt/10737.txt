1. Introduction
Nowadays, as one of the most significant optoelectronic applications, X-ray detection is extensively used in various fields, including medical treatment, national security, nondestructive industrial detection, and so forth.1–9 Currently, most research attention is focused on conventional inorganic semiconductors, such as amorphous selenium,10 crystalline Si (ref. 11) and pure Ge.12 However, some severe shortcomings must still be resolved in these typical X-ray detection materials. For instance, the preparation of these materials or devices usually requires a high-temperature or high-vacuum environment, and the manufacturing processes are complex. Moreover, the imaging equipment is currently used in high doses, which poses great safety risks to human health.13–16 Considering these drawbacks, it is significant and stringent to develop new-generation highly sensitive and stable X-ray detectors to effectively reduce the risks toward human health and mitigate the difficulty of radiation protection in the use of X-rays. As an alternative to the traditional X-ray detectors, perovskite materials have aroused the attention of researchers in optoelectronic fields owing to their excellent properties, including low-cost fabrication, low trap density, high carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime. Significantly, perovskites demonstrate great application prospects for the direct photoconductive sensing of X-rays due to their excellent charge-transport properties and large X-ray attenuation coefficient. Therefore, it implies that perovskites are deemed to one of promising semiconductors for X-ray detection which are able to address the drawbacks of traditional X-ray detectors.
Three-dimensional (3D) halide hybrid perovskite semiconductors (e.g., CH3NH3PbX3, X = Br, I) have emerged as a new generation of radiation detection materials because of their outstanding properties, including high atomic number elements, large mobility and carrier lifetime, low charge trap density and low-cost solution preparation, which are suitable for X-ray detection and application in X-ray imaging. For 3D perovskites, there are some shallow hole and electron traps in the bandgap, which can capture free carriers. Fortunately, by regulating the chemical composition, the 3D perovskites can be tailored to be two-dimensional (2D) layers, one-dimensional (1D) chains and even zero-dimensional (0D) discrete units with diverse optoelectronic performances. Subsequently, structural dimension-reduced hybrid perovskites exhibit extremely interesting and attractive changes in their physical and electronic properties benefitting from their structural flexibility and tunability. For example, 2D lead halide perovskites possess unique quantum well frameworks with larger exciton binding energies originating from alternate stacking of semiconducting inorganic and insulating organic layers. Additionally, 2D perovskite single crystals have much higher structural stability, suppressed ionic migration and anisotropic charge transport compared with the analogous 3D perovskite single crystals. These benefits offer more tunability of their optoelectronic properties owing to their larger degrees of freedom in quantum and chemistry mechanics. As further structural dimensionality-reduced counterparts of 3D perovskites, 1D hybrid perovskites feature exceptional physical merits, mainly benefitting from the adaptability and adjustability of the diverse structures. Consequently, scientists in the research community have exerted great efforts to explore new kinds of 1D hybrid perovskites, to extensively open various perspectives for X-ray detection. In addition, 1D hybrid perovskites, acting as viable optoelectronic materials, manifest encouraging functions in several aspects, such as light-harvesting material and X-ray detection devices due to exciton self-trapping.17–24 Specifically, previously reported work for 1D perovskites has demonstrated that the electron, photon, or hole can spread out without restraint along the direction of the wire, and enhanced efficiency of solar cells can be realized through their exceptional directional charge-transport qualities.25–27 Recently, a 0D perovskite material-based X-ray detector was reported that also featured excellent detectable properties, such as low detectable dose rate and high sensitivity. Meanwhile, some advanced work was conducted and the corresponding performance of X-ray detectors has reached a comparative height. In this review, we aim to highlight the characteristics of different dimensional perovskites in X-ray detection and their application in X-ray imaging.
2. The application of perovskites in X-ray detectors
2.1 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites

2.1.1 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. 
Great efforts have been made towards developing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) single crystals (SCs); however, limited performance still exists owing to poor quality SCs and inappropriate synthesis. For example, the traditional method of preparation for a single crystal is inversion crystallization, which can control the shape and size of the resulting high-quality SCs.28 In addition, it has been used to manufacture SCs with excellent quality and better performance X-ray detectors.29 Xu prepared a Schottky structure X-ray detector based on a MAPbBr3 SC by using inverse low-temperature crystallization.30 The sensitivity of the device is 356 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 with a lowest detectable dose rate (LoD) of 22.1 μC Gyair s−1. Even so, the traditional inverse low-temperature crystallization preparation method for single crystals inevitably introduces impurities in the crystal growth process, leading to interfacial structural mismatch between the perovskite SC and the seed, and destroying the quality of the perovskite SC.31 In addition, the temperature should be accurately controlled to maintain the same growth rate. Subsequently, a high-quality crystal of MAPbI3 for effective X-ray detection was prepared by seed dissolution–regrowth to solve these problems.32 The researchers figured out that the impurities were caused by simultaneous dissolution and contraction in the unsaturated precursors, and removed them. At a bias of 13 V, the X-ray detector found that the sensitivity of cuboid MAPbI3 SCs was over 6000 μC Gyair−1 cm−2. Another unsolved issue for the classic low-temperature crystallization (ITC) method is the uncontrollable desired facets, and the SCs from mechanical cutting or sawing are unsuitable for use in X-ray detection.33,34 In addition, Song advanced a nonstoichiometric ion-feeding approach to create a (110) facet 3D MAPbBr3 SC (Fig. 1a and b). When used in the device structure as an X-ray detector MAPbBr3, SC has low trap density (2.3 × 109 cm−3) and an excellent μτ product (Fig. 1c).35 Moreover, Fig. 1d confirms that the sensitivity of SC MAPbBr3 in the [110] facet is as high as 3928.3 μC Gyair−1 cm−2.

2.1.2 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. 
3D perovskites can capture free carriers using the shallow electrons and hole traps in the bandgap. When a bias voltage is applied, the trapped charges can possibly be released and induce a field that drives ion migration. As a result, dark current will inevitably increase and destabilize the perovskite.36 In addition, X-ray detection properties have been recently implemented in 2D hybrid perovskites.37 The reduced structural dimensionality results in increased thermal activation energy and a limited ion migration rate, which effectively prevents the decomposition of the perovskite.37,38 Meanwhile, the stability and performance of perovskites can be improved by reducing the dimensionality of a 3D perovskite to a 2D structure through introducing organic macromolecules. It is noteworthy that organic molecules not only form hydrophobic layers in 2D perovskite structures, but also induce steric hindrance.39 Luo utilized lead-free perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 to produce (n-butylammonium)2CsAgBiBr6 with a 2D quantum-confined structure by introducing n-butylammonium organic macromolecules (Fig. 2a). The resistivity of the SC reached 1.5 × 1011 Ω cm (mainly due to the introduction of organic n-butylammonium cations), and a sensitivity of 4.2 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 was obtained at a constant deviation of 10 V (as shown in Fig. 2b and c).40 Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) interactions have very different influences on the physical properties of perovskites. Therefore, Shen suggested using diammonium cations to manipulate the distance between adjacent inorganic layers to make the structure more stable and the DJ-type (NH3C4H8NH3)PbI4 SC transfer charge more efficient; combined with the improved temperature crystallization method, centimeter-sized DJ-type (NH3C4H8NH3)PbI4 SCs were prepared. Subsequently, advanced X-ray detectors based on DJ SCs achieved a sensitivity of 242 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and an LoD of 430 nGyair s−1 (Fig. 2d).41 In addition, Zhuang prepared 2D layered (NH4)3Bi2I9 perovskite SCs with anisotropic behaviour using a simple low-temperature method.42 It is worth noting that the (NH4)3Bi2I9 SCs exhibited anisotropic behaviour of some physical properties, such as an activation energy of 0.72 eV in the parallel direction of the cleavage (0 0 1) surface versus 0.91 eV in the vertical direction. Notably, although the sensitivity of 8.2 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 in the parallel direction is much higher than that of 803 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 in the vertical direction, the detection limit is larger (namely, 210 nGyair s−1 in the parallel direction and 55 nGyair s−1 in the vertical direction). They define these differences as anisotropic dark currents, which affect the signal-to-noise ratio, further magnifying the LoD.

2.1.3 1D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. 
Various physical properties were found by researchers in 1D perovskite SCs due to the special structure.43 Tao found that the lead-free hybrid compound (N-methyl-1,3-diaminopropane)BiI5 SC has a 1D metal–halogen skeleton (Fig. 3a). Moreover, it has excellent physical properties, such as high mobility (1.42 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a low trap density of 3.6 × 1011 cm−3, which ensure that the sensitivity of the corresponding X-ray detector is 1 μC Gyair−1 cm−2,44 and the mentioned can be found in Fig. 3b and c. The performance of single-crystal devices to X-ray radiation was measured at 70 keV energy, and a clear photocurrent response was observed at different radiation dose rates (Fig. 3d).

2.1.4 0D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites. 
Recently, Zheng et al. reduced the size of a halide perovskite and prepared an X-ray detector based on a 0D halide perovskite material (MA3Bi2I9 SC, Fig. 4a). They used the seed-crystal-assisted constant-temperature evaporation method to grow hexagonal shaped MA3Bi2I9 crystals (Fig. 4b). To investigate the anisotropic electrical properties of MA3Bi2I9, they cut the crystal into a rectangle along the c-axis (Fig. 4c). An X-ray detector based on the 0D halide perovskite material was shown to have excellent detectability, stable operation, high sensitivity, and a low detectable dose rate.45 0D MA3Bi2I9 SC possesses higher ionic activation energy (0.46 eV) than 3D MAPbBr3 SC and MAPbI3 SC, and the device therefore exhibits a higher sensitivity of 10620 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 (Fig. 4d).

2.2 The application of inorganic perovskites in X-ray detectors

2.2.1 3D inorganic perovskites. 
Compared with OIHPs, inorganic perovskites have excellent stability. OIHPs have volatile and hygroscopic A-site organic cations, while inorganic perovskites rely on stable Cs+ as A-site cations.46–48 Compared with hybrid perovskites, inorganic perovskites exhibit higher activation energies for ion migration, which can decrease the dark current and improve the X-ray detector's functionality. In addition, the atomic mass of inorganic Cs+ ions is higher than that of MA+ and FA+, indicating that the organic perovskites with the same B and X ions have lower absorption capacities than the corresponding inorganic ones. Hence, the high detection sensitivity of the inorganic type means that it has potential for use as an X-ray detector material. Li prepared Cs1−xRbxPbBr3 SC by adding a small amount of Rb+ into the precursor CsPbBr3.49 XPS analysis showed that the core-level energy between Br (3d5/2) and Pb (4f7/2) was improved after partly changing Cs+ for Rb+, changing the orbital coupling between Br and Pb atoms, and affecting the effective mass of electrons and holes further for the changed band edge structure or band dispersion. Under an electric field of 20.1 V mm−1, the optimized Cs1−xRbxPbBr3-based X-ray detector indicated desirable sensitivity of 8097 μC Gyair−1 cm−2. However, lead is believed to dissolve in water and is a serious health hazard. Therefore, the preparation of lead-free perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6from non-toxic Bi or Ag elements has been extensively explored. Steele explored the photophysical properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 SC at 77 K and 300 K, and suggested that the resistivity was temperature-dependent, decreasing from 3.6 × 1012 Ω cm (77 K) to 5.5 × 1011 Ω cm (300 K) (Fig. 5a–c).50 As a result, the functionality of X-ray detectors can vary widely. The sensitivity was 988 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 at 77 K and 316 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 at 300 K. A simple model was used for showing the radiative recombination paths of decaying excited photoelectrons in Cs2AgBiBr6 SC. This improves the X-ray detectors in two ways. One is that the low temperature reduces the probability of electron–phonon scattering and prolongs the lifetime of the carriers. It also reduces the total free charge, inhibiting the charge recombination generated by X-ray. It improves the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the intensity of the dark current. However, a strict preparation process and poor repeatability lead to fluctuations in the performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 SC. Yin studied the solute concentration during the initial nucleation of Cs2AgBiBr6 SC to guide the growth of SC with favourable reproducibility.51 The sensitivity of the optimized Cs2AgBiBr6 SC-based X-ray detector improved to 1974 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 under an electric field of 50 V mm−1. Although research into Cs2AgBiBr6 SC has made great progress, its structural stability is still poor, caused by the degree of disorder between [AgX6]5− and [BiX6]3− octahedron.9 Yuan figured out that phenylethylamine bromide could inhibit/induce dislocation defects and enhance the degree of order in Cs2AgBiBr6 SC. For example, it increases carrier mobility from 2.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 55.7 cm2 V−1 s−1.52 As for Cs2AgBiBr6 SC, some new inorganic perovskites have been prepared to pursue higher X-ray properties. Zhang explored a nuclear control approach to eliminate redundant nucleated seeds to prepare high-quality centimeter-sized Cs3Bi2I9 SC.53 It is noteworthy that, without refinement, the growing microcrystals will reach adjacent microcrystals due to a large number of nucleated seeds and then merge into a continuous solid. The sensitivity of an X-ray detector based on Cs3Bi2I9 SC is 1652.3 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 under the action of a 50 V mm−1 electric field. Pan et al. found a way to prepare thick quasi-monocrystalline CsPbBr3 films by hot pressing, in which all crystals are arranged in the vertical direction without grain boundaries.54 The process of hot pressing is divided into four stages: the CsPbBr3 powder is heated to 873 K (stage 1) and held for 5 minutes to melt incompletely (stage 2). The CsPbBr3 is covered with preheated quartz to form an uneven film of CsPbBr3 (stage 3). Finally, the solid CsPbBr3 film was obtained by lowering the temperature (the fourth stage). It is important to note that cooling should be controlled well to avert induced stress and the formation of cracks or gain boundaries.55 The corresponding CsPbBr3 film achieved a record sensitivity of 55684 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 according to X-ray. Gou subsequently advanced a multiple dissolution and recrystallization approach for preparing uniform, smooth, dense and thick CsPbBr3.56 The antisolvent (1,2-dichlorobenzene) was first added to the transparent perovskite solution to gain precipitation of CsPbBr3. Multiple dissolution and recrystallization dissolved the rough form of CsPbBr3 film by adding a new perovskite solution, and the dissolved species acted with the perovskite solution to fill the recrystallization process. After repeating 20 times, the performance of the perovskite with sufficient thickness was enhanced from 1.0 × 103 to 1.7 × 103 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 with a small detectable dose rate of 0.053 μC Gyair s−1 under a small electric field (0.11 V μm−1) (Table 1).

2.2.2 2D inorganic perovskites in X-ray detectors. 
As direct X-ray detectors, inorganic perovskites have low detection limits and high sensitivity. Bismuth perovskite is expected to be used in X-ray detection. Xia recently utilized a mixture of solvents to dissolve the precursor and prepare a high-quality 2D Rb3Bi3I9 SC, which had a high resistivity of 2.3 × 109 Ω cm and a low trap density of 8.43 × 1010 cm−3 (Fig. 6a and b).57 The Rb3Bi2I9 single-crystal X-ray detector achieved a sensitivity of 42.5 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 at 1 V bias voltage, as shown in Fig. 6c. The sensitivity and LoD of the device based on Au/Rb3Bi3I9/Au structure are 159.7 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and 8.32 nGyair s−1, respectively. What needs to be highlighted is that Rb3Bi3I9 has a higher activation energy (561 meV) than MAPbBr3 (228 meV), resulting in lower ion migration, lower dark current and a lower detection limit. This work provides insights into a crystal structure that could lead to the rational design of 2D perovskites for novel radiation detectors.

2.2.3 1D inorganic perovskites in X-ray detectors. 
Recently, 3D halide perovskites were considered as X-ray detection materials due to their absorption of X-ray radiation, carrier lifetime and high mobility. However, their detection sensitivity and instability in extreme conditions and environments still require optimization. 1D inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 crystals for stable X-ray detection have been reported. The X-ray detector made of 1D inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 (Fig. 7a) has sensitivity an order of magnitude higher than for previously reported detectors using 3D halide perovskites. The high sensitivity X-ray detection of CsPbI3 crystals is attributed to their large carrier mobility-lifetime product and high resistivity. As summarized in Fig. 7b, the X-ray detection sensitivity of the 1D CsPbI3 crystal detector is at least an order of magnitude larger than those reported materials.43

2.2.4 0D inorganic perovskites in X-ray detectors. 
0D quantum dots/nanocrystals (QDs/NCs) have been described as ideal candidates for flexible or large-area panel detectors in imaging technology because the thickness is easily controlled and the solutions can be used as inks in the manufacturing process.58–61 Xu used electrostatic-assisted spray deposition for the synthesis of 0D Cs2TeI6 films with excellent physical properties at low temperatures.34 The entire process is shown in Fig. 8a. Fig. 8b shows the Cs2TeI6 film sample prepared by electrospraying and the assembled device. Considering the high resistance of perovskite (4.2 × 1010 Ω cm), the preparation method is simple and repeatable, giving large-area and homogeneous deposition. In addition, the X-ray detector based on the 0D Cs2TeI6 film has a sensitivity (19.2 μC Gyair−1 cm−2) under a small electric field (250 V cm−1). As shown in Fig. 8c, they detailedly studied the key parameters of the method, including electric field, solvents and substrate temperature, for further boosting the sensitivity of 0D Cs2TeI6 film based X-ray detector.62 It was suggested that the electric field determines the dispersion quality and droplet size of the solution, and the solvent affects the contact angle with the matrix, which is related to the morphology, growth mode and nucleation of the final film. In addition, the substrate temperature affects the evaporation rate of the solution and thus the nucleation rate during the initial stage. Liu synthesized CsPbBr3 quantum dots according to the thermal injection method to prepare a durable and sensitive X-ray detector.63 Owing to the processability of the CsPbBr3 quantum dot solution, they were able to prepare a flexible CsPbBr3 quantum dot X-ray detector using inkjet printing on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate, achieving a significant sensitivity of 17.7 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 at 0.1 V bias. When the bias voltage is applied, secondary electrons with high X-ray energy are collected at the electrode to improve the sensitivity of the detector, which may be the source of the enhancement mechanism.

3. The application of halide perovskites in X-ray imaging
For imaging, the process of low-temperature preparation is the key to depositing semiconductors on silicon thin-film transistors without damaging the transistor. Apart from temperature, a strong connection between the semiconductor and the substrate can help avoid stripping. In addition, the pixel signal needs to be uniform with no image delay. These problems are typical issues with traditional imaging materials.64,65 X-ray detectors have three imaging modes: 2D detector array, linear detector array and single detector pixel.
3.1 Single-pixel imaging
The spatial resolution of single-pixel imaging detectors is associated with many factors, including the distance between the object and the pixel size.66 In general, the pixel size is less than 10 μm in commercial imaging applications. A smaller size means better cross-talk between adjacent pixels.67,68 Moreover, the optical coupling between the substrate and the semiconductor also has a lot to do with the sharpness of the image. Wei proposed an approach to unify MAPbBr3 SC onto a silicon substrate using brominated (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane molecules as the connecting layer.69 The Si–O–C2H5 group of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane molecules tends to hydrolyze into the Si–OH group, and combine with the –OH of the Si substrate to form a strong covalent Si–O–Si bond. At the same time, the basic –NH2 reacts with HBr to form NH3Br and participates in the formation of MAPbBr3 SC. Although there is a lattice mismatch between MAPbBr3 and Si, MAPbBr3 is still formed from amorphous to crystalline state due to its soft properties. They integrated it on a Si substrate and used the Si/MAPbBr3/C60/BCP/Au structure for a single-pixel detector, identifying objects of small size (less than 80 mm) and achieving a higher resolution of 10 lp mm−1. Perovskite SCs have aroused the attention of researchers in optoelectronic fields with their excellent properties, however, they have high-cost assembly in large flat plates. Fortunately, perovskite thin films are suitable for large flat plates due to their flexibility. For example, perovskite SC is the best we can imagine for imaging photoconductors due to its processible fabrication. Perovskite SC is the best we can imagine for imaging photoconductors. However, some issues still need to be tackled. For example, assembling perovskite SC on large flat plates is challenging and costly. Fortunately, perovskite film has shown great potential for large plates due to due to their manufactured solutions. Yakunin first reported on a single pixel imager based on MAPbI3 film, which obtained images with good resolution and high enough contrast.70 Triple cation Cs0.1(FA0.83MA0.17)0.9Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 perovskite film was used by Mescher to make an X-ray detector with flexibility for single-pixel imaging.71 The flexible properties make it suitable for special imaging. Moreover, perovskite wafers are also suitable for fabricating X-ray detectors for imaging because wafer-based X-ray detector can show better imaging ability.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 9a, perovskite wafers can be used to make X-ray imaging detectors. Fig. 9b and c present an optical image and an X-ray image of a key, which could be recognized from the X-ray image. The heat-assisted approach for low-temperature processing of large-area MAPbI3 wafers was advanced by Hu.72 The raw materials were mixed by ball milling, and the mixed elements were heated at a pressure of 10 MPa to form MAPbI3 wafers of various shapes and sizes. X-ray detectors based on MAPbI3 chips can display better imaging ability because they avoid voids and have a smooth topography.

3.2 2D array imaging
Halide perovskite is usually integrated on readings by a dedicated integrated circuit (ASIC).73,74 Wang made a large-area (30 mm × 28 mm × 7 mm) MAPbBr3 SC and designed a 40 × 40 PIN photodiode array for X-ray imaging. The image contrast was obvious after the image processing algorithm was adopted. Kim made an X-ray detector for 2D array imaging based on a ITO/Pi-MAPbBr3/MAPbI3/Pi-MAPbBi3/TFT/ITO structure. When the MTF of the detector was 0.2, the spatial resolution of the detector was 3.1 lp mm−1, and the X-ray imaging effect was better. As shown in Fig. 10a, a normal spring and an abnormal spring are installed in two pens. Through non-destructive image inspection, it can be seen that both X-ray images show clear images of the internal structure (Fig. 10b and c), which can be used to distinguish the quality of the product.75 However, the spatial resolution need to be increased over three times to meet the commercial standards of medical imaging.76 Liu used MA3Bi2I9 SC to fabricate a 13 × 18-pixel detector array. Since the 0D structure of (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 SC suppresses ion migration, and has small baseline drift (5.0 × 1010 nA cm−1 s−1 V−1) and ultra-low dark current, it has excellent contrast resolution.77 Liu reported a 13 × 18-pixel detector array from MA3Bi2I9 SC. Since the 0D structure of MA3Bi2I9 SC inhibits ion migration and has an ultra-low dark current with small baseline drift, it gives excellent contrast resolution in X-ray detectors. In addition, flexible 2D pixel array detectors based on organic films are widely applied.78,79 However, there is a long way to go for perovskite films. We need to realize a certain thickness that gives good detection performance and mechanical flexibility. Recently, Zhao pioneered a solution penetration method in which perovskite crystals are packed into nylon membranes to create X-ray detectors with a bending radius of 2 mm, large area (400 cm2) and 1 mm thickness. Next, a 7 × 12-pixel array (each pixel size 200 μm) was obtained on a 3–5 mm2 device. When the MTF is 0.2, the device displays an imaging resolution of 3.5 lp mm−1. A 2D array detector with an area of 46 cm2 (pixel size 2 mm) was used to image the inside of hollow pipes or tubes thanks to its flexibility. What needs to be mentioned is that higher resolution was found in the flexible detector than the rigid flat-panel one. It might because of the different numbers of X-ray penetrated walls.80

(c) X-ray image of abnormal pen taken by X-ray detector based on perovskite.75 Reproduced from ref. 75 with permission from Wiley-VCH, copyright [2018]. 
3.3 Linear array imaging
A linear detector array consists of a single X-ray-sensitive material arranged in linear pixel lines. When taking the spatial resolution of pixel linear array detectors into consideration, it is determined by the size of the single pixels and the spaces between them. Pan applied MAPbBr3 SC and created a linear array imaging detector with 10 pixels.81 Individual copper wires of each pixel integrate with the current amplifier and the Si substrate is the common anode. We found that a copper-based ‘N’ shaped identifier had been inserted between the detector and the X-ray during the imaging process. When the sign moves in a certain direction, the switching system reads different electrical signals. Accordingly, Yang applied a method called isostatic pressing to create a large-area Cs2AgBiBr6 wafer. It also includes heteroepitaxial growth and wide bandgap semiconductor passivation of grain boundaries to inhibit suspended bonds and block ion migration. In addition, Fig. 11a shows an optical image of the HUST symbol while Fig. 11b is an X-ray image of the HUST symbol.82 They got a resolution of 4.9 lp mm−1 with MTF of 0.2, and the corresponding X-ray for the passivated BiOBr makes dark current and photocurrent uniform.

The dose rate for imaging is 138 μGyair s−1, and the scanning mode as well as the linear detector array are shown at the bottom.82 Reproduced from ref. 82 with permission from Nature Publishing Group, copyright 2019. 
Conventionally, perovskite mono-crystal thin films can be prepared with three methods, that is, the solution-based transverse crystal growth method, the vapor-phase epitaxial growth method, and the top-to-bottom growth method. Solution-processed crystallization has seen the most widespread use in preparing mono-crystal perovskites. This process consists of two steps: nucleation and the subsequent crystal growth, both of which can be controlled by the solubility–supersolubility graph. It is noteworthy that the nucleation rate, affected by the number of nuclei, is usually controlled by the level of supersaturation. Since excessive nuclei always generate crystals of small size, it is necessary to adjust the level of supersaturation so as to obtain mono-crystals of a large area. Crystal growth follows the initial nucleation process. Noteworthily, based on the anisotropic growth rates along the horizontal and vertical directions, the corresponding mono-crystal thin films can be prepared, and this can be controlled through the precursor, mineralizer, and solvent feed ratio. However, in most cases (especially 3D perovskites), the anisotropic growth rate is insufficient to the degree where the mono-crystal of a low aspect ratio emerges. Fortunately, the introduction of a geometric spatial confinement strategy effectively deals with these obstacles and makes the preparation of mono-crystal perovskite thin films possible. Through temperature inversion crystallization, temperature reduction crystallization, antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization, and slow evaporation crystallization, this strategy delivers the vapor-phase precursor to the mono-crystal substrate via carrier vapor at an appropriate temperature in the vapor-phase epitaxy, and then they react and grow into mono-crystal thin films. Vapor-phase epitaxy has been proven to be a powerful technique for developing high-quality mono-crystal thin films. This stunning epitaxial growth technique can yield ultra-thin mono-crystal thin films with low mono-layer thickness and high phase purity. Specifically, high-quality all-inorganic mono-crystal perovskite thin films are blazing a trail for the exploration of multiple optoelectronic applications with high performance and stability. Although great progress has been made with the aforementioned bottom-to-top methods in synthesizing perovskite mono-crystal thin films (e.g., the solution-based growth method and the vapor-phase epitaxial growth method), designing a general synthetic method to prepare different types of perovskite mono-crystal thin films remains a challenge. Encouragingly, the top-to-bottom strategy of slicing large crystals into thin wafers has been verified to be a reliable, controllable and flexible approach for constructing conventional semiconductor mono-crystal thin films. Therefore, Liu's team sliced bulk mono-crystal perovskites, including FAPbI3 and MAPbI3, into wafers, and they found that, compared with the mechanical exfoliation method, which involves laser cutting, inner wafer sectioning, multi-filament sectioning, etc., the diamond wire saw is a suitable method. The perovskite mono-crystal thin films synthesized through mechanical exfoliation have the advantages of single reaction phase, uniform surface, free from grain boundaries and pinholes, and so forth.
4. Summary and outlook
Perovskites for X-ray detectors have achieved some meaningful and representative work. For example, 0D perovskites with inhibited ion migration are advantageous in eliminating baseline drift. In addition, 2D perovskites with orientated crystal growth show strikingly different optoelectronic properties depending on the crystal facet, which makes them promising for bi-functional X-ray detectors. However, there are still several remaining challenges that need to be tackled for further commercial application, such as uncontrollable ionic migration, low quality and stability of perovskites, insufficient thickness and small area.
Challenges

Reproducible growth of high-quality perovskites. 
Perovskite quality has a great influence on the performance of X-ray detectors. The resistivity of perovskites is in the range of 107 Ω cm to 1012 Ω cm, which is not suitable for making X-ray detectors with high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility. It is important to note that high sensitivity is particularly important to reduce health risks by reducing the duration of X-ray exposure during routine medical examinations, which is also related to the quality of the material.


Improving stability of perovskite materials. 
Although extraordinary progress has been made with perovskite materials in recent years and they are being reconsidered for the next generation of energy, their inherent instability is a major obstacle for X-ray detectors. For organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, organic A-site cations (FA+, MA+ and their mixtures) are volatile and hygroscopicity, leading to decomposition of perovskites in extreme environments (heating, humidity, etc.). For inorganic perovskites, although they show better thermodynamic stability than hybrid perovskites, phase transformation problems still exist. Therefore, stability problem should be conquered for their further application in optoelectronic devices.
The planar structure X-ray detector is shown in Fig. 12a. The schematic diagram in Fig. 12b shows the nonlinear and heterogeneous distribution of applied electric fields in a planar detector. The electric field intensity shows greater degradation in the thicker region. Significant electric field distortion is introduced in the planar device near the collecting electrode. This results in incomplete charge collection, including photoinduced electrons and holes in a thicker region. The charge collection of the device mainly comes from the surface layer of the crystal (the X-ray photon incident surface), because the near-surface electric field is larger and the charge collection efficiency is higher. Therefore, the planar structure device can be considered as a surface-sensitive X-ray detector suitable for fast low-energy X-ray detection. For photoconductive detectors, charge collection plays an important role in X-ray detection and is determined by the mobility-lifetime product (μτ). The μτ of a single crystal can be obtained from the photoconductivity under operating conditions.

Outlook

Optimization of structural design and fabrication methods. 
The biggest obstacle to obtaining a small LoD and high sensitivity is dark current, which inevitably produces noise and affects the performance of X-ray detectors. As mentioned, LoD is defined at a SNR of 3.83 Therefore, there are two main directions: one is to directly reduce dark current and noise; the second is to improve signal strength by continuously optimizing the process to prepare high-quality perovskite SC, thin film or wafer.


Integrating low-dimension perovskite materials with 2D materials. 
NCs and quantum dots are small enough to be loaded onto two-dimensional materials to improve their physical properties. CsPbBr3 nanoparticles were integrated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to modify their carrier properties. The emission peak decreased after the introduction of rGo, indicating that there is effective carrier separation and fast carrier transport between CsPbBr3 nanoparticles and rGo.


Developing perovskite SCs and simultaneously paying more attention to the barriers of perovskite films and perovskite wafers. 
Compared with perovskite thin films and perovskite wafers, perovskite SC have no grain boundaries, better carrier properties and a lower detectable dose rate. The LoD of GAMAPbI3 SC shows great potential in the field of medical diagnosis. However, it still needs to be considered in industrial application due to its high cost, large processing area, and complex process. In addition, perovskite film with flexible property could meet some special detection, and perovskite wafers could be fabricated with sufficient thickness. Both of them could be fabricated in large areas to satisfy commercial requirements. Hence, efforts should be made to conquer their shortcomings for working together with perovskite SC.


Fabricating low-dimension perovskite materials. 
This is still a potential direction for commercial X-ray detectors even though the 2D perovskites have low density (low stopping power and low carrier performance). One reason is that reducing the dimensionality increases the activation energy, thus inhibiting inhibit uncontrolled carrier migration in halide perovskites. Low-dimensional perovskites have more symmetrical crystal structures and lower surface energies. Both methods can improve the life and performance of the device. It can increase the volume resistance, avoid noise and further improve the sensitivity of the detectors because 2D perovskites can be introduced with large organic molecules to reduce its 3D structure. Quantum dots/nano carbides can be used as inks to prepare sufficiently thick, large-area perovskite films. However, due to the introduction of organic ligands, the transport problem of QDs/nanonuclear materials remains to be solved.


Developing large atomic number perovskites and optimizing film deposition technologies. 
In the process of preparing perovskite films by spin coating, it is difficult to combine large area and thickness. Generally, the thickness of perovskite films does not reach the required value (several hundred microns thick) and cannot fully absorb X-rays. One promising solution is to increase the atomic number, since a large atomic number blocks X-rays with a large stopping force. In addition, the development of some novel and mature thin-film deposition technologies, such as groove die coating,84 is also a promising direction. Apart from these methods, altering the electronic structure of low-dimensional perovskites can further improve the quality of large-area thick films.85
2D/3D mixed perovskites and 2D/3D/2D sandwich perovskites offer state-of-the-art X-ray detection performance with high sensitivity and a low LoD.86 By exploiting a sequential deposition technique with high controllability, a high-performance X-ray detector made of a perovskite film has been developed. In addition, with the aligned interfacial energy level and improved film resistivity detector, Wu and co-workers further presented the integration of metal halide perovskite detectors with readout-integrated circuits and the associated performance metrics for flat-panel detectors. They also briefly talked about ways to minimize cross-talk and increase spatial resolution in flat-panel detectors.87
In short, direct X-ray photoelectric detectors are capable of overcoming some of the limitations and shortcomings of indirect X-ray detectors based on scintillators. Chen and co-workers briefly described the X-ray scintillation mechanism and the key parameters of scintillators. The X-ray scintillation performance of nanocrystals of metal halide perovskites and their analogues was reviewed.88 Surely, combining these technologies will lead to more efficient X-ray detection ability. Before application in X-ray detection, a tremendous amount of research work still needs to be done, despite great achievements in this area until now.
