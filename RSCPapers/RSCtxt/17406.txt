    , Accepted 28th October 2018First published on 29th October 2018AbstractIn this work, high crystallinity copper selenide thin films directly deposited onto conducting substrates were obtained through a potentiostatic electrodeposition approach. The as-deposited copper selenides involve annealing induced phase transformation from tetragonal Cu3Se2 to cubic Cu2−xSe. The annealing also leads to a remarkable morphology change from dendritic nanosheets to connected networks and separated particle shapes for the annealed (A-Cu2−xSe) and selenized (S-Cu2−xSe) samples, respectively. The copper selenide thin films were demonstrated to serve as efficient counter electrodes (CEs) in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) for electrocatalyzing polysulfide electrolyte regeneration. The CdS/CdSe QDSCs constructed with copper selenide CEs deliver considerable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), especially an optimal value of 3.89% for the A-Cu2−xSe CE-based device. The enhanced photovoltaic performance benefits from the connected network microstructure of A-Cu2−xSe films which afford a large number of reaction sites and efficient charge transport pathways. The Tafel polarization characterization further indicates that, in contrast to the commonly used Cu2S and Pt CEs, the non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe CE exhibits better electrochemical catalytic activity. This work highlights the great potential of electrodeposition for fabricating promising copper selenide CEs for high performance QDSCs.
1. Introduction
With the growing global energy crisis, the development and utilization of new energy sources is becoming increasingly urgent. Among a variety of alternative new technologies, solar cells provide one of the most promising choices for future energy generation.1 Although the current photovoltaic industry is dominated by conventional silicon-based solar cells that show power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 25%, next-generation solar cells continue to emerge with the aim of pursuing the desired features of high efficiency and stability, low-cost and abundant materials, and ease of fabrication.2,3 A variety of new-type photovoltaics, including perovskite solar cells (PSCs),3,4 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),5 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),6 and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs),7,8 have experienced rapid progress in recent years. Among all these photovoltaics, QDSCs have received particular attention due to the excellent optoelectronic properties of QDs, such as high absorption coefficient, the quantum size effect, multiple exciton generation, cost-effectiveness, ease of fabrication, and splendid stability toward an ambient environment.9–11 Up to now, numerous inorganic QDs have been developed to serve as promising sensitizers for QDSCs, including CdS,12 CdSe,13 CdTe,14 PbS,15 PbSe,16 PbTe,17 Ag2S,18 CuInSe2,19 Zn–Cu–In–Se,20etc. The Zhong group pioneered the development of high performance QDSCs and pushed the record PCE of QDSCs up to 12.75%.8 Although significant advances have been achieved towards material exploitation, configuration engineering, and performance optimization for QDSCs, further improvement of the device performance is still urgently needed considering a remarkable theoretical PCE as high as 44%.15,21
The device configuration of a typical QDSC consists of a photoanode, a redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).8 To date, the construction of QD-sensitized TiO2 or ZnO photoanodes featuring adequate light harvesting and efficient charge transport has received tremendous attention.13,21 By contrast, the studies on CEs and electrolytes are comparatively rare. As an important component to conduct electrons and catalyze the regeneration of oxidized mediators in the electrolyte to the reduced form, CEs also have a pivotal impact on the device performance.22,23 The unsatisfactory performance of the currently used CEs is one of the top concerns that restrict the further improvement of PCEs of QDSCs. An excellent CE requires high electrocatalytic activity, favorable electrical conductivity, and good stability.24,25 In pursuit of highly efficient CEs for catalyzing the regeneration of polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−)-based redox couples, a number of CE materials have been developed for QDSCs. These materials mainly fall into three categories: noble metals (Pt, Au, etc.),25 metal sulfides (Cu2S, CoS, PbS, MoS2, Cu2ZnSnS4, etc.),26 and porous carbon materials.7 It has been demonstrated that noble metal CEs usually involve a poisoning effect, i.e. the unfavorable chemisorption of sulfur species in the polysulfide electrolyte, thereby leading to a poor catalytic effect and an impeded charge transfer at the interface of CE/electrolyte.24,25 This issue brings about a poor open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) for solar cells.27 Metal sulfides such as copper sulfide (CuxS) have been widely employed as CEs and show the highest electrocatalytic activity toward reduction of oxidized polysulfide electrolyte; however, Cu2S/brass based CEs, which are normally fabricated by exposing brass foils to polysulfide solutions, suffer from the intrinsic poor electrical conductivity and continuous corrosion in conjunction with polysulfide electrolytes. This fact encourages researchers to explore alternative catalytic materials for enhanced device performance.28
Recently, copper selenides (CuxSe) have been found to show great potential for serving as CEs in QDSCs considering their higher electrocatalytic activity, better stability, and remarkably higher electrical conductivity than those of CuxS/brass based CEs.28,29 The elements S and Se belong to the same main group; in comparison with copper sulfides, copper selenides show a similar structure but higher conductivity due to the higher metallicity of Se. Copper selenides involve a number of crystallographic phases, such as monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal.30 Researchers have spent much time focusing on the construction of hierarchically designed copper selenide nanostructures for numerous photoelectric applications. To date, a series of synthesis approaches have been explored, including the hydrothermal method,31 solvent-mediated room temperature synthesis,32 template directed reactions,33 the hot injection approach,34 liquid phase deposition,35 electrochemical deposition,36etc. Among these synthesis methods, electrodeposition has the advantages of low cost, large scale, and facile fabrication.37–39 Furthermore, it has been revealed that the exploitation of non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe materials enables the further improvement of conductivity.27,40 Therefore, the engineering of well-defined Cu2−xSe electrocatalysts featuring high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity is crucial for constructing highly efficient QDSCs.
In this work, copper selenide (Cu3Se2 and Cu2−xSe) film samples have been prepared on conducting substrates through a potentiostatically electrodeposition method. The phase and morphology of the as-deposited, annealed, and selenized samples were characterized by XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, and TEM measurements. These copper selenide films have been revealed to act as alternative promising CEs that show high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the regeneration of polysulfide electrolytes. A considerable PCE of 3.89% has been reached for CdS/CdSe QDSCs constructed with annealed Cu2−xSe CEs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Electrodeposition of copper selenide films
Copper selenide precursor films were fabricated through a potentiostatic electrodeposition approach. Specifically, the electrodeposition electrolyte was first prepared by dissolving 10 mM CuSO4, 16 mM SeO2, and 0.4 M citric acid in deionized water. The pH of the electrolyte was then adjusted to about 1.8. A three-electrode system was employed in this work to conduct the electrodeposition of the films. An ultrasonically cleaned bare F-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, sheet resistance ∼15 Ω sq−1) substrate, a polished stainless steel sheet and a saturated mercurous sulfate electrode (MSE) served as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Herein electrodeposition was performed at the potential of −0.6 V vs. MSE for 40 min. The as-deposited copper selenide precursor films were further annealed or selenized in a tube furnace under an argon atmosphere at 400 °C for 30 min. In contrast to the pure annealing process, the selenization of the films was achieved by placing a reasonable amount of selenium powder near one end of the tube to afford the selenium source. The copper selenide films were achieved to serve as CEs in QDSCs.
2.2. Preparation of CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 films
CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 films were fabricated according to our previous work.13 Typically, the TiO2 paste was prepared by dispersing 0.5 g Degussa P25, 0.25 g ethyl cellulose and 1.75 g α-terpineol into 5.0 mL ethanol, followed by alternative sonicating and stirring to form a slurry mixture until the removal of a large portion of the ethanol. Then the TiO2 paste was doctor-bladed onto pre-cleaned FTO substrates to prepare TiO2 films, which were annealed in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. A further post-treatment of TiO2 films with aqueous TiCl4 solution was carried out at 70 °C for 30 min and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.
For the loading of QDs onto TiO2 films, CdS and CdSe QDs were deposited by using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) and chemical bath deposition (CBD), respectively. Specifically, for the preparation of SILAR processed CdS, TiO2 films were alternatively dipped into 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2 methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S water/methanol (v/v, 1/1) solution; each dip lasted for 1 min, followed by thorough rinsing with methanol and drying under an air flow. This process was defined as a SILAR cycle. Four cycles were utilized in this work for the deposition of CdS QDs. For the subsequent loading of CdSe QDs through CBD, the CdS-deposited TiO2 films were immersed in a mixture of 0.1 M Na2SeSO3, 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2, and 0.2 M N(CH2COONa)3 aqueous solutions with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. The CBD process was performed at 24 °C for 3 h in the dark to obtain a CdSe layer. Herein Na2SeSO3 solution was prepared in advance by dissolving selenium powder in aqueous Na2SO3 solution at 70 °C for about 1 h under vigorous stirring. All of the photoanodes were finally coated with a passivation layer of SILAR processed ZnS, which was also obtained through two SILAR cycles, where 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2 and 0.1 M Na2S solutions were used as cation and anion precursors, respectively.
2.3. Fabrication of solar cells
A typical sandwiched configuration of a QDSC was assembled from a QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and a CE separated with a Scotch tape spacer, followed by the injection of the electrolyte to conduct device measurements. The polysulfide electrolyte was obtained by dissolving 1 M S in 1 M aqueous Na2S solution. In this work, Cu2S and Pt CEs were prepared to act as control samples. Specifically, the Cu2S counter electrode was fabricated on brass foil that was pre-etched with hydrochloric acid with a mass fraction of ∼37.0% at around 75 °C for 30 min and immersed in the as-prepared polysulfide electrolyte for 5 min, leading to the formation of a layer of black Cu2S on the foil. For the preparation of a Pt CE, chloroplatinic acid solution was screen-printed onto FTO substrates, followed by further annealing at 420 °C for 30 min in a muffle furnace, resulting in the formation of Pt films on the substrates.
2.4. Characterization of materials and devices
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a diffractometer (X'Pert PRO MPD, Panalytical B. V.) to detect the phase structure of film samples by using Cu Kα irradiation. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a focal laser MicroRaman spectrometer (LabRam HR Evolution) under laser excitation at 532 nm. An electron spectrometer (ESCALAB220Xi, Thermo Scientific) was used to obtain X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. The morphology features of the film and powder samples were revealed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU8010) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A) with the light power calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with an NREL standard Si solar cell. The photoactive area of solar cells was localized at 0.196 cm2. The Tafel polarization curves of dummy cells were recorded on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-deposited, annealed and selenized copper selenide film samples. For the as-deposited precursor sample, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the tetragonal phase Cu3Se2 (JCPDS No. 47-1745).22 The lattice planes corresponding to the main peaks are labeled in the figure. The observation of sharp and narrow diffraction peaks of samples implies the highly crystalline quality of the as-deposited materials.41 The formation of Cu3Se2 materials through electrodeposition in acidic media has been proposed to involve the total electrode reactions that can be described by eqn (1): 3Cu2+ + 2SeO32− + 12H+ + 14e− → Cu3Se2 + 6H2O(1)
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the as-prepared Cu3Se2, A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe film samples, as well as standard JCPDS cards for tetragonal Cu3Se2 (No. 47-1745) to cubic Cu2−xSe (No. 06-0680). 
After the annealing and selenizing of the film samples, the crystal phase of copper selenides transforms from a tetragonal into a cubic structure, and three main peaks centered at 26.8°, 44.6° and 52.9° can be attributed to the diffraction from the (111), (220), and (311) planes of non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe (JCPDS No. 06-0680), respectively. Herein the as-obtained annealed and selenized copper selenide samples were denoted as A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe, respectively. Such a scenario of annealing induced phase conversion has also been reported.42,43 The reaction occurring through annealing is associated with the evaporation of selenium from the films (x < 0.5 in our case), which can be expressed by eqn (2): (2 − x)Cu3Se2 → 3Cu2−xSe + (1 − 2x)Se(2)
With the aim of revealing the surface oxidation states and chemical composition, XPS analysis was performed. Fig. 2a–c show the high resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p, Cu LMM and Se 3d for Cu3Se2, A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe film samples, respectively. The Cu 2p core level XPS spectra reveal two main peaks located at binding energies of 932.6 and 952.6 eV, which are assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The observed spin orbit splitting was around 20.0 eV, indicating the monovalence of Cu (Cu+).30,44 The chemical state of Cu can also be evaluated with the modified Auger parameter (a′), calculated from the sum of the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu LMM lines.45 As presented in Fig. 2b, each of the Cu LMM spectra of three film samples has a peak located at the kinetic energy of 917.8 eV. Therefore, the a′ value is estimated to be 1850.4 eV, approaching that of Cu2S.45 The observation further supports the monovalent nature (Cu+) of the copper selenide film samples. This result is also consistent with the previous reports that the oxidation state of Cu in binary CuSe and CuS is basically +1.46,47 For the as-prepared Cu3Se2 film sample, the corresponding Se 3d core level spectrum can be fitted with two couples of doublet peaks: one couple of doublet peaks at a lower energy of 54.8 eV for Se 3d3/2 and 54.0 eV for Se 3d5/2 associated with Se2− ions, and the other couple of doublet peaks at a higher energy of 55.8 eV for Se 3d3/2 and 55.0 eV for Se 3d5/2 corresponding to elemental Se. The signals of elemental Se are attributed to a certain amount of amorphous Se adsorbed onto the surface of samples.48 After being treated by annealing and selenizing processes, the A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe film samples show the removal of elemental Se, as suggested by the absence of the couple of doublet peaks at higher binding energies for elemental Se. The Se 3d XPS spectra also indicate that there did not exist other selenium species such as selenium oxide.

Raman spectroscopy is a useful non-destructive spectroscopic technique to detect the vibration energy levels of compounds and to further confirm the crystal structure and determine the phase purity of samples.49 As shown in Fig. 2d, the typical Raman spectra of three types of copper selenide film samples exhibit similar peak positions. The most prominent Raman peak locates at 256 cm−1, which corresponds to the Se–Se stretching vibration of Se2 units; this fact is in good agreement with the literature.46 The weak bands observed at around 187 cm−1 in the spectra can be assigned to the transverse optical (TO) phonon mode peaks.41

Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of copper selenide film samples. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, it is observed that the conducting substrates are fully covered by vertically grown dendrites. Each individual dendrite shows a nanosheet structure that involves the growth of secondary branches. The average size of dendrites ranges from 1 to 3 μm while the thickness of dendritic nanosheets is estimated to be around 100 nm. The cross-sectional view image shows that the as-deposited Cu3Se2 film displays a thickness of 3.2 μm. It has been revealed that such dendritic growth proceeds as the growth rate of crystals exceeds the mass transport rate of ions that feed the crystal growth in the electrodeposition electrolyte solution.48 That is, at a deposition potential of −0.6 V in our case, the consumption rate of feed ions at the film surface might be faster than the transport rate of ions. This scenario promotes the formation of morphologically unstable dendritic or branching shapes rather than the formation of a nanoparticle shape with a minimum surface energy. The vertical growth of nanosheets enlarges the active area of the catalytic reaction at the CE/electrolyte interface.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of the top-view and cross-sectional view of (a–c) Cu3Se2, (d–f) A-Cu2−xSe and (g–i) S-Cu2−xSe film samples. 
As shown in Fig. 3d–i, the surface morphology of films suffers from a remarkable change, which involves the transformation from a sheet-shape into a connected network and separated particle shapes for the A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe samples, respectively. Meanwhile, the annealing process also leads to a decrease of film thickness, down to a value of around 2.3 μm. The SEM images under high magnification reveal that lots of small nanocrystals distributed on bulk samples provide a large surface area with abundant active sites for the regeneration of polysulfide electrolytes. Moreover, in contrast to S-Cu2−xSe samples which appear to undergo excessive crystallization, the connected network microstructure of A-Cu2−xSe samples is more advantageous for electrolyte ions to access the active sites.30 Therefore, the as-prepared Cu3Se2 and Cu2−xSe samples show great potential to act as potential candidates for electrocatalytic application in QDSCs, considering that the charge transfer rate at the CE/electrolyte interface strongly depends on the amount of active sites located on the surface of CEs.25
The elemental mapping images and energy disperse X-ray (EDX) spectra of copper selenide film samples are shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that the elements Cu and Se present homogeneous distributions on the conducting substrates. The characteristic energy-dispersion peaks of Cu and Se further confirm the successful deposition of copper selenides. Furthermore, EDX analysis reveals that the atomic ratios of Cu/Se are estimated to be 1.3, 1.8 and 1.7 for Cu3Se2, A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe, respectively. The Cu/Se ratio of the as-deposited sample is close to that of 1.5 for Cu3Se2, while the A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe samples share the ratio less than the stoichiometric ratio of the Cu2Se compound, confirming the copper-deficient composition for both samples. The results show that the annealing process under an argon atmosphere results in a decrease in selenium content; compared to the purely annealing process in our experiments, the selenizing process that involves the existence of a selenium source causes a less selenium loss. This fact coincides with some previous reports.42,50 The evaporation of selenium from the films through annealing indicates the remarkable change in the surface morphologies and phase conversion from Cu2Se3 to Cu2−xSe. It has been demonstrated that, in contrast to stoichiometric Cu2Se which is unstable under air, non-stoichiometric Cu2−xSe such as Cu1.8Se exhibits better air stability, contributing to the practical electrocatalytic application of the as-achieved film samples.51,52
 Fig. 4  Elemental mapping images display the spatial element distribution of Cu and Se, and EDX spectra based on the surface of (a–c) Cu3Se2, (d–f) A-Cu2−xSe, and (g–i) S-Cu2−xSe film samples. 
More structural details of copper selenide samples are provided by TEM studies, as presented in Fig. 5. The morphology as shown in Fig. 5a clearly confirms the dendritic nanostructure of the as-deposited Cu3Se2 samples, revealing the growth of secondary branches onto trunks. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 5b) demonstrates the identification of tetragonal Cu3Se2, consistent with the results from XRD measurements. TEM images as given in Fig. 5c and d show that the A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe samples are involved in the formation of connected networks and separated particle shapes, respectively. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of the A-Cu2−xSe sample (Fig. 5e) clearly reveals lattice fringes with a spacing of around 0.20 nm that corresponds to the (220) lattice plane of cubic Cu2−xSe.53 A SAED pattern of A-Cu2−xSe (Fig. 5f) further indicates the crystalline face centered cubic (fcc) structure of Cu2−xSe along the zone axis of [02], resorting to the identification of one set of diffraction spots, as labeled in the figure.

In this work, the as-prepared copper selenide film samples were used as CEs to construct QDSCs, coupled with CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized photoanodes and aqueous polysulfide electrolytes. A schematic illustration of the sandwiched structure and working principle of a CdS/CdS QDSC is presented in Fig. 6a. Upon the illumination of incident light, photons are harvested by CdS/CdSe QDs, accompanied by the generation of electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons are rapidly injected into the conduction band of TiO2, transported through the mesoporous TiO2 film and further collected by the conducting FTO substrates. The photogenerated holes left in the valence band of QDs are scavenged by S2− ions in the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in the oxidation of S2− ions into Sn2−; meanwhile, the CE plays a critical role in redox electrolyte regeneration through catalyzing the reduction of Sn2− into S2−via receiving electrons from the external circuit and transferring them to the polysulfide electrolyte. Consequently, an electrical current is formed in the closed circuit. Besides these charge transport pathways, there also exist some charge recombination processes in photovoltaic devices, dominated by the back reaction of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 and QDs into the electrolyte.26

(b) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of CdS/CdSe QDSCs constructed with copper selenide, Cu2S and Pt CEs, measured under the illumination of One Sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). (c) Comparison of Voc and FF for different CE-based QDSCs. (d) Tafel polarization curves of dummy cells constructed with A-Cu2−xSe, Cu2S and Pt CEs. 

Fig. 6b presents the J–V curves of CdS/CdSe QDSCs constructed with different CEs, measured under One Sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) illumination. The photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are summarized in Table 1. As is shown, among three copper selenide samples, the A-Cu2−xSe CE delivers a champion PCE as high as 3.89%, coupled with a Jsc of 12.94 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.60 V and a FF of 0.50. The corresponding IPCE spectrum of the A-Cu2−xSe CE-based device (Fig. S1, ESI†) further verifies the Jsc value measured from the J–V curve. This scenario is closely associated with the surface morphology of CEs considering that the catalytic activity of CEs mainly depends on the amount of reaction sites and the charge transfer rate.24,54 Typically, the morphology of porous dendritic nanosheets for Cu3Se2 should contribute to the efficient electrocatalysis of electrolyte regeneration due to the large contact area (i.e., reaction sites) between CEs and electrolytes and favorable charge transport through the two-dimension (2D) nanosheets.29 However, the as-deposited film samples suffer from relatively poor adhesion on FTO substrates, resulting in a certain degree of film peeling in the polysulfide electrolyte. By contrast, the Cu2−xSe films processed by annealing and selenizing exhibit superior adhesivity and stability. Compared to the S-Cu2−xSe sample showing distributed particles on the films, the connected network of the Cu2−xSe sample affords a greater number of reaction sites and more efficient charge transport pathways, thereby delivering a remarkably enhanced PCE.

In this work, the commonly used Cu2S and Pt CEs were used to act as control samples. As is shown, the photovoltaic performance of A-Cu2−xSe based CdS/CdSe QDSCs is comparable to that of Cu2S-based devices (3.82%) and superior to that of Pt-based devices (1.72%). In consideration of the identical photoanodes and electrolytes used in the experiments, the results imply that the as-prepared copper selenides exhibit attractive electrocatalytic activities towards the regeneration of the polysulfide electrolyte. Particularly, the most striking difference in photovoltaic parameters between devices constructed with different CEs lies in Voc and FF, as highlighted in Fig. 6c. Copper selenide-based devices afford a much higher Voc and FF than those of Pt-based devices, probably due to the rapid charge transport at the CE/electrolyte interface that promotes the cyclic regeneration of S2−/Sn2− redox couples.25,54 These results demonstrate that Cu3Se2 and Cu2−xSe act as efficient CE materials for catalyzing the regeneration of the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSCs.

Table 2 summarizes some recent reports of copper selenide CE-based QDSCs. These studies also revealed the great catalytic capability of Cu2−xSe and Cu3Se2 CEs. As shown, most of these publications report that the preparation of copper selenides involves time-consuming and tedious steps: synthesis of copper selenide nanoparticles, processing of copper selenide pastes, and further spin coating or doctor-blading of pastes onto conducting substrates. By contrast, our electrodeposition approach is more facile and economical for the deposition of copper selenide thin films. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of electrodeposited copper selenide film samples as CEs for QDSCs.

Tafel polarization curves were also obtained to further demonstrate the electrocatalytic characteristics of different CEs for catalyzing the reduction of Sn2− ions. Fig. 6d presents the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of voltage for the regeneration of redox couples. The slopes for the anodic and cathodic branches are in the order of A-Cu2−xSe > Cu2S > Pt. Since a larger slope represents a higher exchange current density (J0),27 the J0 of A-Cu2−xSe CE extrapolated from the Tafel polarization curve is revealed to be slightly greater than that of Cu2S CE, while much greater than that of Pt CE. It is well known that a higher J0 indicates a lower activation energy required during the reduction of the oxidized mediator (Sn2−) to the reduced form (S2−) in the polysulfide electrolyte, while the value of activation energy directly determines the electrocatalytic activity of CEs.28,29 Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of A-Cu2−xSe is confirmed to be excellent compared to those of Cu2S and Pt CEs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, electrodeposited copper selenide (Cu3Se2 and Cu2−xSe) thin films with high crystallinity have been successfully fabricated and demonstrated as promising CEs for QDSCs. The as-deposited film samples involve a phase transformation from tetragonal Cu3Se2 to cubic Cu2−xSe under annealing in an argon atmosphere; the annealing also causes a film morphology change from dendritic nanosheets to connected networks and separated particle microstructures for the A-Cu2−xSe and S-Cu2−xSe samples, respectively. Benefitting from the sufficient reaction sites for the cyclic regeneration of S2−/Sn2− redox couples and the rapid charge transport at the CE/electrolyte interface, the copper selenide films show excellent electrocatalytic activity in the polysulfide electrolyte. As a result, the CdS/CdSe QDSC constructed with the A-Cu2−xSe CE yields a PCE of 3.89%, superior to that of the conventional Cu2S and Pt CE-based devices. Considering the superior electrocatalytic activity, Cu2−xSe shows great potential to supersede the commonly used Cu2S and Pt for serving as a more effective CE catalyst in QDSCs.
