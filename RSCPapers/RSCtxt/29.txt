    , Accepted 20th December 2019First published on 23rd December 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic heterostructure materials have received significant research interest for designing light harvesting devices because of their efficient charge separation. Here, we design organic and inorganic nano-heterostructures using conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) [poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT] and Au nanoparticles. We investigate the carrier relaxation processes of this heterostructure at different time scales by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. The lifetime of the singlet state (S1) of the pristine polymer shortens from 480.7 ps to 2.8 ps due to the formation of nanoparticles, and the formation of a delocalized collective state (CLS) is obtained in polymer nanoparticles whose lifetime is found to be 384.6 ps. The hot and ultrafast electron transfers occur from P3HT polymer nanoparticles to Au nanoparticles and the time constants are 253 fs and 37.7 ps, respectively, which are responsible for the efficient charge separation in such heterostructures. Such a fundamental study of relaxation processes of organic–inorganic nano heterostructures is very significant for designing light harvesting systems.
1. Introduction
Studying the complex excited state photophysical phenomenon of semiconducting polymers is an emerging area of research for efficient solar energy conversion to renewable energy.1–5 Several strategies have been developed for mimicking natural light-harvesting systems by using polymers, porphyrin arrays/assemblies, and organic–inorganic hybrid and heterostructure materials because of their reasonably high molar extinction coefficient and good photo-stability.4,6–12 It is known that π-electrons are delocalized along the chain of a conjugated polymer and the optical transition occurs from the ground state to the excited state after photo-excitation.13–16 Barbara et al. have reported a significant change in the photophysical properties of collapsed state of MEH-PPV due to interchain interactions.17 Furthermore, the impact of the aggregated state of a polymer on charge transport is described by Salleo et al.18 The influence of the extended and collapsed form of a π-conjugated polymer (poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]; MEH-PPV) on the charge carrier relaxation dynamics and the energy transfer process has been studied extensively by using ultrafast spectroscopy.5,13,19,20 Thus, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) are found to be emerging nano-materials for artificial light-harvesting systems because of their multi-chromophoric nature and high molar extinction coefficient.1,5,21–23 Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) is a widely used polymer for the preparation of solar cells, LEDs, printed electronics and many other optoelectronic devices because of its attractive properties.24–29 The polymeric chains collapse during the formation of nanoparticles in the presence of water where the chromophoric units interact through intra and/or inter chromophoric interactions which will modify the photophysical properties.5,13,14,19 At the time of PNP formation, the long hydrophobic saturated aliphatic chain will prefer to stay inside the PNPs to avoid the polar aqueous solvent. On the other hand, hydrophilic amine groups will prefer to reside at the outer side of the polymer nanoparticles as a consequence of favorable solvent interactions. Favourable interchain interactions and different chromophoric subunits with different energy levels along the polymeric backbone lead to energy migration from blue absorbing subunits to low lying red subunits after excitation.13,14,20 It is seen from our previous work that different states with different free energy minima arise during the collapse of polymeric chains of MEH-PPV into nanoparticles which causes intra/inter chain energy transfer.19 It is evident that this energy funneling occurs in the collapsed state through a delocalized collective state which is the lowest energy site of the collapsed form.30–32 Thus, the excitation energy of polymer nanoparticles is transferred from the hot S1 state to the vibrationally relaxed S1 state after photoexcitation and further funnels to the lowest energy state i.e. delocalized collective states (CLs). Global and target analysis of transient absorption spectra is indispensable to understand these complex photophysical processes which could not be analyzed using single wavelength analysis.
After exciting the polymer nanoparticles, electron–hole pairs (excitons) are generated in PNPs and the extraction of electrons is possible in the presence of a good electron acceptor with a favourable band alignment with the polymer nanoparticles. Reduced graphene oxide, C60, metal nanoparticles etc. are being used as efficient electron acceptor materials.33–36 Metal nanoparticles (especially Au nanoparticles) are known to be used as electron acceptors for efficient charge separation.37,38 Unfortunately, less emphasis has been given on understanding the change of photoinduced processes in polymer nanoparticles in the presence of metal nanoparticles. Heeger and co-workers have reported the super-quenching of cationic-conjugated polymers in the presence of gold nanoparticles due to energy transfer or electron transfer within the conjugated polymer.39 Kim et al. have reported 50–70% improvement of efficiency of poly(3-octylthiophene)/C60 photovoltaic devices doped with Au and Ag nanoparticles because of efficient charge separation.40 Attention has been paid on efficient charge separation for designing hybrid device systems.41,42 Kanai et al. have employed the first-principles DFT approach to elucidate the mechanism responsible for charge separation at the P3HT/fullerene heterojunction.43 They showed that the energy alignment of electronic states at the interface is significantly altered in the excited-state because of the transfer of charge (via an inductive change in the potential across the interface) in this nanoscale heterojunction. They also found that the electron transfer in the P3HT/fullerene heterojunction is likely to be an adiabatic transfer in the lowest excited state. Unfortunately, less attention has been paid on the relaxation processes of these nano heterostructures which eventually control the charge transfer process. In the case of polymer–metal nanoparticle heterostructures, the lower lying delocalized electronic state may play a crucial role in dictating the charge transfer process. Schreck and co-workers synthesized a squarine polymer where biphasic energy transfer (0.3 ps and 2.6 ps) occurs from a higher energy band to a lower energy band and the exciton transfer rate is found to be 30 fs−1.44 However, the energy transfer rates of the [SQB]n homopolymer are found to be between 70 fs−1 and 4 ps−1 depending on the solvent and the specific pathway.45 Therefore, ultrafast spectroscopic study along with global and target analysis would be important to understand the involvement of different states (hot S1, relaxed S1, and CLs) along with the time scale for charge generation, charge separation and charge recombination processes of polymer nanoparticles in the presence of metal nanoparticles.
In the present work, we have prepared organic–inorganic nano heterostructures using conjugated polymer nanoparticles (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)) and Au nanoparticles. The changes in photophysical relaxation processes during polymer nanoparticle formation from the extended form (in THF) and in the presence of Au nanoparticles are studied using the ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopic technique. Global and target analysis of transient absorption data of the polymer in the extended form and the collapsed form reveals the presence of a newly formed delocalized collective state in polymer nanoparticles which was absent in the extended form. Also, the changes in photo-induced processes in polymer nanoparticles (relaxation of the hot singlet state, singlet state, and delocalized collective states) in the presence of metal nanoparticles are studied. Global and target analysis of transient absorption data reveals that the charge transfer takes place from both the hot singlet excited state and collective delocalized state of P3HT polymer nanoparticles to Au NPs. Such a study of relaxation processes in nano heterostructure systems is very crucial for designing light harvesting systems.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Regio-random poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, Mn: 54000–75000, Aldrich), chloroauric acid (HAuCl4, Merck), hexadecylamine (HDA, Aldrich), trisodium citratedihydrate (Merck), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Merck), distilled tetrahydrofuran (THF, Merck), and HPLC water (Merck) were used.
2.2 Preparation of positively charged P3HT polymer nanoparticles
Positively charged P3HT polymer nanoparticles were prepared using the simple re-precipitation technique described elsewhere.21,35 Briefly, 250 μL of 1 mg mL−1 P3HT in THF, 250 μL of 1 mg mL−1 hexadecylamine (HDA) in THF and 250 μL of THF were mixed and the mixed solution was ultrasonicated to get a clear and homogeneous solution. Then, 1 mL of the mixed solution was rapidly injected into 10 mL of HPLC water under vigorously stirring conditions for 5 min. After a while, this solution was ultrasonicated for 20 min followed by filtration through 0.2 μm filter paper and thereafter THF was evaporated by partial vacuum evaporation at 70 °C for two hours. As a result, aqueous dispersed positively charged P3HT polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) were formed (zeta potential: +15 mV).
2.3 Synthesis of citrate-capped Au nanoparticles (NPs)
The Au NPs were prepared through a reduction method described elsewhere.38 The prepared solution of HAuCl4 was reduced by adding freshly prepared ice cold solution of NaBH4 in the presence of a capping ligand (trisodium citrate) under stirring. Briefly, 0.5 mL of aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (10 mM) and 0.5 mL of trisodium citrate (10 mM) were added to 19 mL of HPLC water and vigorously stirred. Then, 0.6 mL of freshly prepared ice cold aqueous solution of NaBH4 (0.1 M) was added dropwise to the vigorously stirred solution. The concentration of the synthesized Au NPs is 64 nM (detailed calculation is provided in the ESI†) and they are stable for more than one month. The synthesized Au NPs were negatively charged (zeta potential: −24 mV).
2.4 Preparation of the P3HT PNPs/Au heterostructure
For the preparation of the heterostructure, negatively charged Au NPs were added to positively charged PNPs (using hexadecylamine due to the surface attached amine groups of the saturated aliphatic chain) and the solution was stirred for 30 minutes. Then the resulting solution was kept for two hours without any disturbance. To study the photophysical changes, we prepared sets of solutions. The final volume of all the sets was 3 mL. The final concentration of Au NPs in these sets was 1.5 nM, 2.5 nM, and 5 nM, respectively. We obtained a stable nano-heterostructure solution as the negatively charged Au NPs were attached on the surface of positively charged PNPs. Further addition of Au NPs (>5 nM) made the solution unstable (the solution became turbid and the PNPs/Au NP heterostructure precipitated out).
2.5 Characterization
A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEOL 2010, 200 kV operating voltage) was used to investigate the morphological sizes of the prepared nanoparticles and their heterostructure. Room temperature optical absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) studies were carried out using a Fluoromax-P (Horiba JOBIN YVON) photoluminescence spectrophotometer.
For time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurement, the samples were excited at 375 nm using a picosecond NANO-LED IBH-375 and the fluorescence decays were collected on a Hamamatsu MCP photomultiplier.
The data was analyzed by following equation:  here, n is the number of emissive species, b is the baseline correction (“DC” offset), and αi and τi are the pre-exponential factor and the excited-state fluorescence decay time associated with the ith component. The average decay time, 〈τ〉, was calculated from the following equation.  where  and it is the contribution of the decay component. αi and τi are the pre-exponential factors and excited-state fluorescence lifetimes associated with the ith component, respectively. This value should be called an amplitude-weighted lifetime.
A femtosecond fluorescence upconversion spectrophotometer with a Halcyone ultrafast setup was used for ultrafast time resolved spectroscopic measurements. The samples were excited with 400 nm wavelength of excitation, pumped using a 800 nm femtosecond (fs) (140 fs pulse width, 80 MHz repetition rate) laser pulse (4.4 W) from a Ti:sapphire oscillator (Chameleon, Coherent) coupled to a second harmonic generator (with a BBO type I crystal). Using a nonlinear crystal (BBO type II), the emission wavelength (595 nm) and the gate pulse of the fundamental beam (800 nm) are upconverted. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the instrument response function is about 288 fs.
2.6 Transient absorption spectrophotometer
In our femtosecond transient absorption spectrophotometer (TAS) setup, a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator (Seed laser, Spectra Physics Mai-Tai SP) generates pulses of ∼80 fs duration with a wavelength of 800 nm, at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. A separate pump laser (Nd:YLF laser, 527 nm, Spectra-Physics Empower 45) provides the energy required for amplifying the seed pulse. In all TAS measurements, data were recorded at room temperature. The samples were placed in a 2 mm quartz cuvette constantly rotated with a magnetic stir-bar controlled by a magnetic stirrer from outside to prevent exposure of the same excited volume to multiple laser shots and to prevent sample degradation. The power of the pump pulse (<5 μJ cm−2) was kept low enough to avoid sample degradation and the multi-exciton effect.
2.7 TAS data analysis
We have analyzed TA data using a kinetic model (global and target analysis).46–48 We obtained (from global analysis) sequentially interconverting evolution associated difference spectra (EADS), e.g., 1 → 2 → 3…; where the arrows indicate successive mono-exponential decays of increasing time constants, which can be regarded as the lifetime of each EADS. This procedure validates a depiction of the evolution of the (excited) states of the system. For obtaining the contributions from these molecular species (because the EADS may reflect mixtures of molecular species), a target analysis was performed in which a specific kinetic scheme was applied. We obtained the spectrum signature of the “pure” excited and product state intermediates as species-associated difference spectra (SADS). Each of these states can be ascribed to a distinct intermediate of the relaxation process. Ultrafast processes (energy and/or electron transfer) are assessed based on these species along with a specific assignment of time scale for each process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
A nano-heterostructure system of P3HT polymer nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles is prepared by using our previously reported work.36 TEM images of the prepared P3HT polymer nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S1A (ESI†). We have modified the surfaces of P3HT PNPs positively through addition of hexadecylamine (amine groups attached to the saturated aliphatic chain). During nanoparticle formation, the pristine extended polymer chains coiled into a spherical collapsed form. The average particle diameter of all the polymers was found to be around 40 ± 10 nm. The average size of the Au NPs was 4 ± 1 nm (inset of Fig. S1A, ESI†). The negatively charged Au NPs are attached electrostatically to the positively charged PNPs. The TEM images of the heterostructure system after adding 5 nM Au NPs to the PNP solution are shown in Fig. S1B (ESI†). The TEM image clearly shows that Au NPs are attached on the surface of polymer nanoparticles.
3.2 Steady state spectroscopy
A broad absorption band with the peak maxima at 427 nm is observed for the P3HT polymer in THF solution which is due to strong π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone (Fig. S2, curve a, ESI†).5,49 The peak maximum is red shifted from 427 nm to 435 nm after nanoparticle formation due to interactions of the chromophoric units, which causes a lower HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Fig. S2, curve b, ESI†).5,50 More red shifting and broadening of the absorption band of polymer nanoparticles is found after addition of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S3A, ESI†). The red shifting occurs from 435 nm to 452 nm for P3HT nanoparticles after the addition of 5 nM Au NPs to PNPs (Fig. S3A, ESI†). The emission maximum is red shifted from 560 nm in THF solution of P3HT to 596 nm after the formation of P3HT polymer nanoparticles (Fig. S2, curves c and d, ESI†). The red-shifting of the optical absorption band (π–π* transition) is due to an increase in the interchain interactions during the collapse of polymer chains via π–π orbital overlap of the closely stacked chromophoric subunits.16 Again, 55% quenching of photoluminescence of PNPs is observed after the addition of 5 nM Au NPs which is due to the interfacial charge transfer between PNPs and Au NPs (Fig. S3B, ESI†). Takeshima and co-workers have reported the enhancement of fluorescence from palladium octaethylporphyrin (Pd-porphyrin) by silver nanoprisms (AgPRs).51 Interestingly, they also noticed that the fluorescence intensity is increased as the distance between the Pd-porphyrin molecules and the AgPRs is decreased from 10.5 to 1 nm, which indicates the LSP-induced fluorescence radiation process from Pd-porphyrin near the AgPRs. For metal-enhanced fluorescence, it is difficult to predict whether a particular metal structure will quench or enhance fluorescence. Based on the radiating plasmon (RP) model, Lakowicz suggested that small colloids are expected to quench fluorescence; whereas, larger colloids are expected to enhance fluorescence.52
3.3 Time resolved and femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopy
Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurement has been carried out to understand the decay dynamics of polymer nanoparticles in the presence of Au nanoparticles (details are provided in the ESI;† Fig. S3C and Table S1). Fig. S3C (ESI†) shows the decay dynamics of PNPs in the presence of Au NPs. The decay kinetics were fitted bi-exponentially with a combination of 0.335 ns (93%) and 1.1 ns (7%) for P3HT PNPs. The decay time was reduced from 0.388 ns to 0.304 ns for P3HT PNPs in the presence of 5 nM Au NPs. (Fitted decay parameters are provided in Table S1 of the ESI.†) After addition of 5 nM Au NPs, the fitted decay kinetics were composed of 0.23 ns (83%), 0.597 ns (15%) and 1.2 ns (2%) for P3HT PNPs. One new component arises in the decay dynamics with the addition of Au NPs which suggests the charge transfer process in the polymer/Au NP nano-heterostructure. Fig. S3D (ESI†) shows the ultrafast up-conversion decay after the addition of Au NPs. All the decay parameters were fitted bi-exponentially and the fitted decay parameters are given in Table S2 (ESI†). Interestingly, the faster part of the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion decay of the PNPs becomes faster after the addition of Au nanoparticles with higher contribution from 15 ps (31%) to 8 ps (73%) in P3HT PNPs and the slower part changes from 380 ps (69%) to 275 ps (27%). The significant change of the ultrafast decay dynamics indicates the fast charge transfer process from PNPs to Au nanoparticles because of the energy band level alignment of P3HT PNPs (LUMO: −3.2 eV, HOMO: −5.5 eV)53 with Au NPs (work function −5.1 eV).54 We exclude the possibility of energy transfer because there is no significant overlap between the emission of PNPs and the absorption of Au NPs.
3.4 Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption spectroscopic study has been used to understand the carrier relaxation of polymer nanoparticles (hot singlet state, singlet state, and collective delocalized states) and the relaxation processes of polymeric excited states in the presence of Au nanoparticles. For fs-TAS, we excited the samples at 400 nm and probed via a white light continuum in the range of 420–750 nm. Fig. 1 presents the profile pictures of fs-TAS data for the pristine P3HT polymer in THF, pure P3HT PNPs and PNP–Au nano-heterostructure, composed of a three dimensional heat map of ΔmOD (change of optical density) (Fig. 1A–C(i)), time-gated spectra (Fig. 1A–C(ii)) at selective delay times and time traces at selective probe wavelengths (Fig. 1A–C(iii)). The TA spectra of the P3HT polymer in THF, P3HT PNPs and PNP–Au nano-heterostructure show spectral features with a strong negative ground state bleach (GSB) and photo induced absorption (PA).15 In the case of P3HT in THF, the GSB peak is obtained at around 450 nm, the SE band at 580 nm and the broad PA bands with peak maxima are at 714 nm (Fig. 1A(i)). In the case of P3HT PNPs, the GSB peak is obtained at around 450 nm and the broad PA band with peak maxima is at 720 nm upon photo-excitation (Fig. 1B(i)). In the case of the P3HT/Au heterostructure, a GSB peak at 450 nm and a broad PA band with peak maxima at 722 nm are obtained (Fig. 1C(i)).
 Fig. 1  The fs TA profile pictures of P3HT pristine in THF (A), P3HT PNPs (B) and the P3HT PNPs/Au nano heterostructure (C) along with their heat map (i); time-gated spectra at selected delay times (ii) and time traces at selected probe wavelengths (iii), respectively, after excitation at 400 nm. The time axis is linear up to 10 ps and logarithmic thereafter. 
A comparison of GSB recovery dynamics for pristine P3HT in THF and P3HT PNPs is shown in Fig. 2A. A faster bleach recovery is observed for polymer nanoparticles than for the polymer in THF. A comparison of GSB recovery dynamics for pure P3HT PNPs and PNPs in the presence of Au NPs is shown in Fig. 2B. An increase of kinetics recovery at the corresponding bleaching position is observed in the presence of Au NPs compared to their pure counterpart. The GSB recovery profile is well fitted with three exponential components for P3HT in THF, and four exponential components for pure P3HT PNPs and the PNPs/Au heterostructure (provided in Table S3, ESI†). The three obtained time constants (τi) along with the amplitude (ai) for P3HT in THF are as follows: τ1 = 2.4 ps (48%), τ2 = 490 ps (37%), and τ3 > 8 ns (15%). These components are assigned to hot exciton cooling time, relaxation of the singlet state and to the triplet state, respectively. For P3HT NPs, we obtained four exponential components with τ1 = 0.554 ps (56%), τ2 = 4.73 ps (20%), τ3 = 445 ps (14%) and τ4 > 8 ns (10%). These components became τ1 = 0.2 ps (70%), τ2 = 3.2 ps (12%), τ3 = 295 ps (10%) and τ4 > 8 ns (8%) in the presence of Au nanoparticles. For both PNPs and heterostructure systems, the smallest component τ1 is attributed to hot exciton cooling time, τ2 corresponds to the relaxation time of the S1 state, and the τ3 component is assigned to the relaxation of the CLs state. The shortening of time constant indicates the excited state ultrafast electron transfer. The longer time component (τ4) is assigned to the triplet state.

3.4.1 Global and target analysis. 
Single wavelength kinetic fitting is not the best possible way for analyzing the photo-induced processes occurring after photo-excitation. As multiple processes occur within the same time scale, we need to analyse all these photoinduced processes with advanced spectro-temporal parameterization, namely global and target analysis methods.


3.4.2 Global analysis for the P3HT extended form (P3HT in THF). 
We applied a sequential (unbranched, unidirectional) model for analyzing the relaxation process of P3HT in THF where three components are obtained with lifetimes of 1 ps, 480 ps, and >8 ns for SHot1 (hot singlet state), S1 (singlet state), and T1 (triplet state) using their respective evolution associated difference spectra (EADS) shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The SHot1 (EADS 1) is short lived (1 ps) which is attributed to the initial excitation to the hot S1 state of the extended polymer chain residing in P3HT in THF. In Fig. S4 (ESI†), the ground state bleach (GSB) for SHot1 is observed at nearly 450 nm and the excited state absorption (ESA) is observed at 725 nm. The SHot1 state decays rapidly to the vibrationally relaxed S1 state (EADS 2) whose lifetime is found to be 480 ps. The GSB peak for the EADS 2 (S1) state is found at around 450 nm and the stimulated emission band at around 590 nm. The long lived component (>8 ns, EADS 3) is assigned to the triplet state (T1).


3.4.3 Global analysis for P3HT PNPs. 
We used a sequential (unbranched, unidirectional) model for global analysis of pure PNPs where four components are obtained with lifetimes of 349.6 fs, 2.9 ps, 393.6 ps and >8 ns for SHot1 (hot singlet state), S1 (singlet state), CLS (delocalized collective state) and T1 (triplet state), respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). The SHot1 (EADS 1) is short lived (349.6 fs) which is attributed to the initial excitation to the hot S1 state of the chromophoric subunits of the PNPs. In Fig. S5 (ESI†), the ground state bleach (GSB) for SHot1 is observed at nearly 450 nm and the excited state absorption (ESA) is observed at 720 nm. The lifetime of the SHot1 state is 349.6 fs which decays rapidly to the vibrationally relaxed S1 state (EADS 2) with a lifetime of 2.9 ps. The GSB peak for the EADS 2 (S1) state is found at around 450 nm. The EADS 3 shows a red shifted GSB at 470 nm with respect to EADS 1 and EADS 2 (GSB is at 450 nm), indicating the formation of a new state which we assign as the delocalized collective state (CLS)55,56 whose lifetime is 393.6 ps. In polymer nanoparticles, the self-collapse of the polymer chain (extended form) causes the shortening of the distance between different chromophoric segments which leads to funnelling of the excitation energy along the polymer chain to the lower lying energy states i.e. the delocalized collective state (CLS).13,14 The long lived component (>8 ns, SADS4) is assigned to the triplet state (T1).


3.4.4 Global analysis for the P3HT/Au heterostructure. 
For the global analysis of the time-gated spectra of the P3HT/Au heterostructure, the obtained lifetimes are 154 fs, 2.3 ps, 270 ps and >8 ns for the P3HT/Au heterostructure (Fig. S6, ESI†). Interestingly, we found from singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis that four components can satisfactorily fit the data. The first EADS consisted of a ground state bleach (GSB) at nearly 450 nm and the excited state absorption (ESA) at 720 nm. The EADS 1 decays to the EADS 2 within 154 fs. In the case of EADS 3, the additional bleaching signal at around 530 nm indicates the charge separation. Interestingly, there was no transient signal for the particular 5 nM Au NP solution when we excited the Au NPs at 400 nm (Fig. S7, ESI†). Thus, the additional peak at 530 nm in EADS 3 has no contribution from the bleach signal of the Au plasmon band, indicating that there is an additional charge separation process involved. The EADS 4 with >8 ns corresponds to the triplet state of the PNPs.


3.4.5 Target analysis for the P3HT pristine form (P3HT in THF). 
Further, we have performed target analysis of the TA data for the P3HT in THF (Fig. 3A). The obtained SADS with lifetimes of 1 ps, 480.7 ps, and >8 ns are (Fig. 3B) for SHot1, S1, and T1, respectively. The spectral feature of each state is almost the same as that obtained from global analysis. The SHot1 state decays rapidly to S1 in 1 ps, whereas the S1 state simultaneously decays to T1 in 9.6 ns and to the ground state in 505.9 ps. The spectral signature of the triplets of the polymeric system appears beyond the range of our instrumental detection limit. The evolution of population of the states with time is shown in Fig. 3C.

3.4.6 Target analysis of P3HT PNPs. 
Again, we have analyzed the TA data for P3HT PNPs by target analysis (Fig. 4A). The lifetimes of the obtained SADS are 345 fs, 2.8 ps, 384.6 ps and >8 ns for SHot1, S1, CLS and T1, respectively (Fig. 4B). The SHot1 state decays rapidly to S1 in 345 fs, whereas the S1 state simultaneously decays to the CLS in 3.5 ps and to the ground state in 14 ps. The CLS state decays simultaneously to the ground state in 404.8 ps and to T1 in 7.6 ns. The spectral signature of the triplets of the polymeric system occurs in the wavelength range beyond the range of our instrumental detection limit. The evolution of population of the states with time is shown in Fig. 4C. We can express the rate constants associated with each process as rate constant kx(i→j) = fraction of population conversion from state ‘i’ to ‘j’ divided by the time taken by state ‘i’. For P3HT polymer nanoparticles, ka = 2.898 ps−1 represents the rate constant for population conversion from the SHot1 state to the S1 state and kb = 0.286 ps−1 represents the rate constant for population conversion from the S1 state to the CLS state.

3.4.7 Target analysis of the P3HT/Au heterostructure. 
Finally, target analysis of TA data for the P3HT PNP–Au NP heterostructure has been performed (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B presents the kinetic model which depicts all the processes separately. The obtained SADS (Fig. 5C) have lifetimes of 146 fs, 2.4 ps, 280 ps and >8 ns. The lifetime of first SADS changes from 345 fs to 146 fs in the presence of Au nanoparticles, indicating that there is a very fast hot electron transfer process occurring from the SHot1 state of polymer nanoparticles to Au NPs. Again the lifetime of S1 does not change much (from 2.8 ps to 2.4 ps) in the presence of Au NPs, indicating that there is no ultrafast electron transfer process involved from the S1 state of polymer nanoparticles. The CLs state lifetime changes from 384.6 ps to 280 ps along with the appearance of an additional bleach peak at around 530 nm in the presence of Au NPs indicating the ultrafast electron transfer from the CLs state of polymer nanoparticles to Au NPs. We do not observe any signal from Au NPs after excitation at 400 nm (Fig. S7, ESI†). Thus, the additional bleaching peak at 530 nm is not due to Au NPs which further confirms the formation of the charge separation between Au NPs and PNPs. Feng et al. reported both the electron and hole generation processes at the donor–acceptor interfaces of PBDB-T:FDICTF and PBDB-T:FDNCTF blend films.57 From global and target analysis, they also reported that the charge transfer and the charge separated state are due to the formation of a new bleaching peak. The fourth state with >8 ns lifetime corresponds to the triplet state of the PNPs. The decay from SADS 1 to SADS 2 consisted of two simultaneous processes, one is the hot electron transfer from the SHot1 state to Au NPs and the other one is the conversion from the SHot1 state to S1. The calculated time constant for the hot electron transfer from the SHot1 state to Au NPs is found to be 253 fs (calculations of time constants are provided in the ESI†). The SADS 2 decays to the ground state within 9.6 ps and to the SADS 3 within 3.2 ps, simultaneously. Here, the downhill energy funnelling occurs from the S1 state of polymer nanoparticles to the CLs state. The decay of SADS 2 to SADS 3 also consisted of two simultaneous processes; one is the population conversion from the S1 state to the CLS state and the other one is the ultrafast electron transfer from the CLs state of polymer nanoparticles to Au NPs. The time scale associated with this ultrafast electron transfer is found to be 37.7 ps (detailed calculation is provided in the ESI†). SADS 3 decays to the ground state in 291.6 ps and to the SADS 4 in 7 ns.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the changes of the relaxation processes of P3HT polymer nanoparticles from the P3HT pristine polymer. The formation of a new delocalized collective state apart from the hot singlet state, singlet state and triplet state during polymer nanoparticle formation is evident. Again, ultrafast transient spectroscopic study reveals that the relaxation processes from the excited states of the polymer nanoparticles are modified in the presence of Au nanoparticles. Global and target analysis of transient absorption data confirms that the hot and ultrafast electron transfers occur from the SHot1 and CLs state of P3HT polymer nanoparticles to Au NPs with time constants of 253 fs and 37.7 ps, respectively. Such a fundamental photophysical study is very crucial for designing efficient heterostructure based light harvesting systems as charge separation enhances.
