    , Accepted 10th November 2022First published on 2nd December 2022AbstractAs an alternative anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), LiVO3 has shown great potential. We wished to fully reveal its potential for lithium storage. We introduced low-cost oxalic acid as a carbon source to construct a LiVO3/C core–shell structure. Employed as LIB anodes, the highly reversible specific capacity of LiVO3/C reached 776.0 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g−1. During five periods of rate testing at various current densities (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 A g−1), the average capacity of the LiVO3/C electrode was 365.8 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1, and retained a high discharge capacity of 569.0 mA h g−1 when the current was returned to 0.2 A g−1. Impressively, the LiVO3/C anode presented an unprecedented high-rate long cycling performance of 205.0 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1 after 2000 cycles. The unprecedented lithium-storage ability was attributed to the unique core–shell structure, in which all-around carbon encapsulation provided many interfaces, and enhanced the electron conductivity and structural consistency of the LiVO3/C electrode. Moreover, the adaptive reaction dynamics of the LiVO3/C electrode were documented. That is, the gradually increasing pseudocapacitance contribution and decreasing charge-transfer impedance upon cycling were the intrinsic drivers of the excellent rate performance. This work promotes further development of anode materials based on LiVO3.
Introduction
Recently, the growing energy crisis and greenhouse gas emissions have expedited the replacement of traditional fossil energy sources with renewable and green energy storage technologies, such as wind and solar.1,2 Nevertheless, due to their intermittency and diversity, a prerequisite for the implementation of wholesale energy storage systems is that they must be high-energy and high-power on density and be cost-effective.3 In particular, alkali-metal ion batteries are potential candidates for a new era of energy-storage technologies because they are portable, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly.3 Among them, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), with their long cycle life and superior energy density, are the predominant energy-storage devices.4–9 However, the capacity (372 mA h g−1) of graphite anode is restricted, so it can no longer meet the rapid development of energy-storage equipment with high energy density.10–13 Consequently, optional anode materials, which have better lithium storage, are important. With an appropriate voltage platform, relatively high specific capacity and high ionic conductivity, Li3VO4 has been recognized as a potential anode material.14–16 LiVO3 with few lithium atoms, has been deeply studied as a cathode for LIBs owing to its unidimensional structure and fast capability for ion transfer.17–29 LiVO3 also shows the potential for lithium storage as an anode, but its mechanism and related research on electrochemical behavior are in a preliminary stage, which hinders its further development.29–32 The morphology of the electrode is also regarded as an important ingredient for reaction kinetics during the cycling process, and determines its electrochemical properties.33,34 A LiVO3 hybrid electrode with novel structural characteristics and excellent performance in terms of lithium storage is an exciting approach.
Herein, we fabricated a LiVO3/C core–shell structure through a concise approach using low-cost oxalic acid as a carbon source.35,36 The all-around coated carbon of such a core–shell structure on the one hand increases the electron conductivity and configurational stability but, on the other hand, provides rich interfaces for lithium storage.11 LiVO3/C is utilized for the anode in LIBs, exhibits a high discharge capacity of 776.0 mA h g−1 through 200 cycles with a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and outstanding rate property (average capacity of 365.8 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and resumes a high discharge capacity of 569.0 mA h g−1 through five periods of rate testing from 0.2 g−1 to 5.0 A g−1). The LiVO3/C electrode delivered an unprecedented long cycling performance, remaining at 205.0 mA h g−1 with a current density of 10.0 A g−1 after even 2000 cycles. The increasing contribution of pseudocapacitance and decreasing charge-transfer impedance during cycling were the intrinsic drivers for the excellent capability of the hybrid electrode. This work provides an impetus for development and enabling optimization of the performance of the LiVO3 anode.
Experimental section
Material preparation

Synthesis of LiVO3. 
LiNO3 (0.002 mol), V2O5 (0.001 mol) and hexamethylenetetramine (0.002 mol) were dissolved in deionized water (40 mL) and stirred at room temperature until a homogeneous yellow solution was obtained. After uniform dissolution, a transparent precursor, which was packed in a 50 mL Teflon™-lined autoclave, was obtained by hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 24 h. The precursor was dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Pure LiVO3 was obtained by annealing the obtained dry precursor powder at 550 °C for 5 h with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere.


Synthesis of LiVO3/C. 
The as-synthesized LiVO3 (0.1 g) and oxalic acid (0.03 g) were mixed and ground for 30 min in an agate mortar to obtain an orange precursor powder. The LiVO3/C hybrid was obtained by annealing the precursor powder at 450 °C for 5 h with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1 in a N2 atmosphere.

Material characterization
An X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) system (Remake Ultima IV) with Cu Kα radiation was employed to identify the phase of samples. The composition of LiVO3/C was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Escalab MKII setup (hν = 1253.6 eV) with an exciting source of Mg Kα. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted using a JSM-7500F system to evaluate the morphology of samples. The morphology, microstructure, and crystallinity of products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Tecnai G2 F30 setup (FEI). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained to identify the crystal structure by TEM.
Electrochemical measurement
The anodes for electrochemical measurements were evaluated using coin-type half cells (CR2025; Panasonic). They were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with H2O and O2 concentrations <0.01 ppm. They were constituted by a working electrode, Li foil (counter electrode), a membrane comprising microporous polypropylene (Celgard 2400), and LiPF6 (1 M) dissolved in a mixed solution (1:1, v/v) of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) as the electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by blending active material (i.e., LiVO3/C and LiVO3), acetylene black (AB), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thoroughly at a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which was coated on Cu foil and cut into discs of diameter 14 mm and then dried at 120 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. A battery test system (CT3001A Land) was applied to characterize galvanostatic charge/discharge curves. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves was undertaken and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was done using an electrochemical workstation (CHI604E) with the potential ranging from 0.01 V to 3 V.
Results and discussion
The LiVO3/C hybrid was prepared by a facile two-step synthesis (Fig. 1). First, pure LiVO3 was synthesized through a hydrothermal process followed by annealing treatment in an air atmosphere. The obtained LiVO3 of high purity, good crystallinity, and certain particle size was conducive to carbon introduction and regulation of carbon content. Oxalic acid with a special coordination effect can be used as a carbon source.35,36 If oxalic acid is combined with certain transition metals, soluble complexes can be formed due to the coordination effect. In this work, oxalate (e.g., lithium oxalate) and V5+–oxalic acid complexes were formed during the grinding of LiVO3 and oxalic acid.37,38 Finally, the LiVO3/C hybrid with a core–shell construction (LiVO3 core was parcelled by a straticulate carbon shell) was obtained during carbonization in N2 (see the experimental section for detailed procedures).
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of a LiVO3/C hybrid (schematic). 
The phases of pure LiVO3 and LiVO3/C samples were analyzed according to their XRD patterns (Fig. 2(a)). The diffraction peaks located at 14.0°, 18.6°, 21.1°, 23.8°, 26.6°, 29.2°, 30.1°, 31.2°, 32.5°, 35.9°, 38.8°, 43.0°, 46.1°, 49.0°, 51.4°, 55.8°, 63.2°, and 66.2° coincided with the (110), (200), (020), (111), (021), (−311), (310), (−202), (002), (221), (311), (330), (−422), (−313), (−223), (−423), (−204), and (531) crystallographic planes of orthorhombic LiVO3 (JCPDS number: 70-1545), respectively. All of the peak positions for pure LiVO3 samples and LiVO3/C samples were in accordance with the orthorhombic LiVO3 phase, indicating that impurities were absent. Detailed information on the constituents of the LiVO3/C hybrid were presented in Raman and XPS spectra. The Raman spectrogram was measured in the range 100–1000 cm−1 (Fig. 2(b)). The most intense band at 950 cm−1 and the band at 900 cm−1 were accredited to a VO2 vibration involving the exterior oxygen atoms and backbone oxygen atoms, respectively. The bands at 521 cm−1 and 646 cm−1 were assigned to VOV vibrations. δVO2 bending vibration modes corresponded to the bands at 349 cm−1 and 387 cm−1. The another one at 212 cm−1 was attributed to δVOV modes.22,39 The characteristic peaks at around 600 eV and 1000 eV were ascribed to the stretching vibrations of V–O bonds in low-valence lithium vanadate (LiV2O5) in the Raman spectrum.40 This phenomenon was most likely caused by a reduction of a very small amount of LiVO3 by oxalic acid. Fitted higher Raman-shift spectra of the LiVO3/C hybrid are provided in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The D band corresponded to 1350 cm−1, and arose from the defects and disorders in the carbon lattice. The D′′ band at 1510 cm−1 was associated with the amorphous phase, and its intensity was inversely proportional to crystallinity. The peak centered at 1580 cm−1 corresponded to graphitic carbon. The I(D)/I(G) ratio is 0.65 (based on the area ratio).41 The existence of C, V, O, and Li elements was revealed via XPS (Fig. 2(c)). Analyses of their valence states were obtained through high-resolution XPS (Fig. 2(d)–(f)). Two pairs of peaks at 524.8/517.2 eV and 523.5/516.0 eV for V 2p corresponded to the V 2p1/2/V 2p3/2 of V5+ and V4+ spin orbits, respectively (Fig. 2(d)).29,42 With regard to the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2(e)), the peak centered at 530.1 eV corresponded to O2−, which is the oxidation state bonds with Li and V in the crystal structure. The peak at 532.0 eV was ascribed to CO bond.42–45 Three dominant energies of the C 1s peak (around 284.8, 286.3, and 288.5 eV) can be seen clearly in Fig. 2(f), and match with the C–C, C–O, and CO bonds, respectively.46–48 The structure and composition characterizations stated above indicated that LiVO3/C had been prepared successfully.

Microstructural characterization of the LiVO3/C hybrid was revealed via SEM, TEM, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The LiVO3/C hybrid comprised relatively uniform particles of size 0.3–1 μm (Fig. 3(a)). Numerous pores between stacked particles were observed. A low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3(b)) also showed pores between LiVO3/C particles, which contributed to infiltration by the electrolyte. The electrolyte wettability of electrodes was measured to test this speculation. The LiVO3/C electrode had a contact angle with the liquid electrolyte of 0° (Fig. S3, ESI†). The LiVO3 electrode had a contact angle with the liquid electrolyte of 26°. These data indicated that the electrolyte wettability of the LiVO3/C electrode was much greater than that of the LiVO3 electrode.49 A high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3(c)) revealed a gauzy, carbon layer (∼10 nm) coat on LiVO3. Hence, the LiVO3/C hybrid showed a unique core–shell structure with LiVO3 as the core and a carbon-coated layer as the shell. HRTEM (Fig. 3(d)) revealed that the carbon shell was amorphous. Also, the interlinear spacing of 0.21 nm was in accordance with the monoclinic LiVO3 (330) crystal plane. The interface between the LiVO3 core and the carbon shell could be conducive to additional lithium storage. The nitrogen-adsorption isotherms of the LiVO3/C hybrid (Fig. S2, ESI†) appeared to be typical type-IV adsorption curves, indicating the presence of interfaces in the shell core structure.13 In addition, complete coating of the carbon shell could improve electron transport and structural stability of the hybrid.50–52 The regular diffraction spots in the SAED pattern (Fig. 3(e)) indicated the monocrystalline feature of LiVO3/C. Homogeneous distribution of C, N, O, and V elements can be seen in Fig. 3(f) (scanning TEM) and Fig. 3(g) (elemental mapping). The distribution of the carbon element could be seen clearly on the outermost coating of the LiVO3/C particle. The LiVO3 particle (core) was coated by a thin carbon layer (shell). These observations indicated that the LiVO3/C hybrid with a core–shell structure had been constructed successfully.

The lithium-storage performance of samples was evaluated in half cells at 0.01–3.0 V (Fig. 4). CV profiles of the LiVO3 electrode were analysed at 0.2 mV s−1 (Fig. 4(a)). The reduction reaction of the LiVO3 electrode occurred at 0.48 V and 1.49 V in the initial cathodic scan, which corresponded to the insertion approach of Li+ and the structure of the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) film.29 Subsequently, the cathodic peaks shifted to a higher voltage region due to electrochemical activation of the electrode.29,53,54 The oxidation reaction peaks of the LiVO3 electrode were 0.90 V and 2.31 V in the anodic scan, which matched with the Li+ extraction. CV profiles (Fig. 4(d)) of the LiVO3/C electrode were very similar to those of the LiVO3 electrode except for the obvious cathodic peaks at 2.37 V and 2.44 V, which may have matched with Li+ embedding in low-valence lithium vanadate.55,56Fig. 4(b) and (e) show the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of pure LiVO3 and LiVO3/C. An incipient charge/discharge capacity of 471/636 mA h g−1 and 645/801 mA h g−1 was observed with an equivalent incipient coulombic efficiency (CE) of 74% and 80%, respectively. Formation of the SEI film gave rise to irreversible capacity loss. Fig. 4(c) and (f) show a comparison of cycling performances using a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Compared with the LiVO3 electrode (161 mA h g−1), the LiVO3/C electrode had much greater resistance to cycling and higher discharge capacity (776 mA h g−1) through 200 cycles. The slight increase in specific capacity may have been due to the electrochemical reconstruction of the electrode, which enhanced the ability for Li-ion storage and electron transfer.54,57 The higher lithium-storage capacity of the LiVO3/C electrode was attributed to the additional interfacial storage between the LiVO3 core and carbon shell, and its greater cyclic stability was attributed to the structural stability afforded by protection of the carbon shell.10,34,58–62 The capacity of the LiVO3/C electrode had a marked upward tendency during cycle testing owing to electrochemical activation of the electrode material.53,54 Moreover, the LiVO3/C hybrid presented an excellent rate performance at current densities of 0.2–5 A g−1. As the current density increased from 0.2 to 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 A g−1, the corresponding average specific capacity reached 538.7, 504.1, 476.5, 438.0, and 365.8 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 4(g)). After five periods of rate testing over 410 cycles, when the current reverted to 0.2 A g−1, the discharge capacity was restored to 569 mA h g−1. The hybrid electrode delivered unprecedented long-term cycling stability (Fig. 4(i)). The initial discharge capacity of the LiVO3/C hybrid reached 345.1 mA h g−1, and then the discharge capacity was 205.0 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1. These excellent electrochemical properties could be ascribed to the shell having full carbon coating, which improved the reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability.33,34,60,61 Compared with other LiVO3-based anode materials, the LiVO3/C hybrid showed superior electrochemical performance (Table 1).

The excellent cycling stability of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode was interpreted using reaction kinetics. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Li-ion diffusion were fitted to compare the EIS spectra of pure LiVO3 and the LiVO3/C hybrid (Fig. 5(a)). The LiVO3/C hybrid electrode had a smaller Rct (101 Ω) than that of pure LiVO3 (119 Ω) (Fig. 5(b)). Simultaneously, the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode had faster Li-ion diffusion, which was confirmed through the linear fitting of Z′ vs. ω−1/2 (Fig. 5(c)). The faster reaction dynamics of the LiVO3/C hybrid were attributed to the thin, stable carbon coating and its specific core–shell architecture. Surprisingly, its fast reaction dynamics were well maintained upon cycling. EIS of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode revealed the variation of Rct and Li-ion diffusion in different states of the electrode (Fig. 5(d)). Rct decreased gradually and tended to stabilize with an increasing number of cycles (Fig. 5(e)), which suggested continuous optimization of conductivity. Moreover, the increase in Li-ion diffusion occurred mostly in the initial few cycles and tended to be decrease subsequently (Fig. 5(f)). This phenomenon may have occurred because the coordinated electrochemical reconstruction resulted in the enhanced reaction activity of the electrode. The excellent electrochemical capability of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode manifested as adaptive, rapid reaction dynamics, which was connected to its characteristic core–shell structure.

We analyzed the kinetics of Li-ion storage of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode to further reveal its adaptive reaction kinetics and explain the reason for its excellent electrochemical performances. We evaluated the pseudocapacitive and diffusion-controlled contributions to lithium storage based on the equation of i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2, respectively.63 The pseudocapacitive charge storage of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode increased from 63.8% to 79.8% with a gradually enhancive scan rate from 0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1 (Fig. 6(a), (e), and (i)). Interestingly, the contribution ratio of the pseudocapacitance (which belonged to the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode) had a step-up tendency upon cycle measurement, reaching to 81.8%, 83.4%, and 84.0% at 1 mV s−1 after 50, 100, and 200 cycles, respectively. This phenomenon was in accordance with the change in trend of reaction kinetics of the electrode mentioned above. This phenomenon could be attributed to the many interfaces unique to the core–shell structure, which are conducive to the additional storage of lithium ions. As electrochemical activation progresses, the contribution of pseudocapacitance increases further as the number of interfaces increases. Moreover, the LiVO3/C particles stick to each other and form a porous structure, which facilitates electrolyte diffusion and charge transfer, thus delivering outstanding rate performance and long cycling life.

Conclusions
A novel LiVO3/C core–cell structure was designed through a concise hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing treatment. It possessed a uniformly coated carbon shell on LiVO3 particles (core). On the one hand, the fully coated carbon shell could improve the conductivity and structural stability of LiVO3. On the other hand, the interface between the LiVO3 core and carbon shell was conducive to Li+ storage. The specific capacity of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode was 776.0 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, which was higher that of the LiVO3 anode (161.0 mA h g−1). The average capacity was 365.8 mA h g−1 when the current density was 5 A g−1 after a rate testing of five periods. An unprecedented high-rate cycling life with high capacity retention of 205.0 mA h g−1via long cycle testing of 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1 was documented. Such excellent performances arose from the self-adaptive reaction dynamics of the LiVO3/C hybrid electrode. That is, the gradually increasing pseudocapacitance contribution and decreasing charge-transfer impedance upon cycling were the intrinsic drivers of the excellent rate performance. The outstanding properties of the LiVO3/C anode and its concise synthetic method could facilitate practical application of the LiVO3 anode in LIBs.
