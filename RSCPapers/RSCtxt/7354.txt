    , Accepted 15th May 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractSignificant enhancement in the performance of solar energy conversion devices has historically been achieved through optimized device scaling. Scaling trends will be extremely difficult to maintain unless new materials and device structures are discovered. Herein, sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular architectures were synthesized, for the first time, via galvanostatic anodization. The fabricated nanotubes are partially crystalline with high photoactivity towards water splitting and solar-to-electric conversion. Mott–Schottky, transient photocurrent and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) analyses indicate a faster electron transfer at the nanotube/electrolyte interface. The sub-100 nm tubes showed a maximum conversion efficiency of 9.3% upon their use in dye-sensitized solar cell devices. The concept of short nanotubes should be useful for the future use of the material in various applications.
Nanostructured metal oxides are highly desirable for their vast applications in biomedical fields,1,2 lithium-ion batteries,3,4 photoelectrochemical devices,5,6 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),7–9 and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs),10 among others. Therefore, diverse synthesis routes have been explored such as templating,11 ultra-sonication,12–14 spray drying or pyrolysis,15,16 laser pyrolysis, among others to fabricate such materials.17 However, these synthesis processes face limitations such as poor control over the size and shape of the structures, reproducibility issues, and running cost.11
Of particular interest, hollow TiO2 nanoarchitectures show much promise for the design of highly active nanostructured catalysts due to their low density, high strength, high active surface area, and improved light harvesting characteristics.18,19 For example, TiO2 hollow nanoparticles have shown exceptional performance upon their use as photoanode materials in DSSCs mainly because of their large surface area, enabling the adsorption of an enormous amount of dye. However, for applications such as water splitting, the small grain boundaries of the nanoparticles can be problematic as they act as recombination centers of charge carriers, resulting in a short lifetime of the electrons.20 The nanotubular architecture with its one-dimensional structure and ordered morphology, on the other hand, offers the advantage of directed electron transport and electron/hole pair separation.21,22 However, nanotubes have a lower surface area compared to nanoparticles. To have both advantages, a high surface area and directional charge transfer, the nanotubular architectures need to have lengths that are close to those of the nanoparticles. Previous studies on the effect of the nanotube length on the electron transport process showed the superiority of the electron transport process within the short TiO2 nanotubes in comparison to the long ones.23,24 Liu et al.23 showed that the electron transport process within short TiO2 nanotubes (280 nm) was much favorable in comparison to that for long nanotubes. Also, Gao et al.24 showed that the shorter the nanotubes, the higher the resulting quantum efficiency upon their use in photovoltaic devices. On another note, over the past two decades, sub-100 nm metal oxides have been assembled in high performance field-effect transistors as a gate oxide material.10,25,26 However, one of the drawbacks of MOSFETs is their high manufacturing cost. Finding a facile and cost-effective way to produce sub-100 nm architectures would make these structures useful in MOSFET applications.
Herein, we report, for the first time, the fabrication and assembly of sub-100 nm TiO2 tubes, combining the advantages of both nanoparticles (high surface area) and nanotubes (directional charge transfer), via a facile and cheap galvanostatic anodization process. We also report on the control of the growth of the photoactive {001} facet. The fabricated nanoarchitectures showed very high performance when used as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting and in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Prior to anodization, pure titanium foil samples (1 cm × 1.5 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, followed by ethanol, and then water for 20 min each. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, with the titanium foil as the working electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode. The samples were anodized in electrolytes containing 1% NH4F (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 98%) mixed with 1.1 wt% polyvinylpyrrolidone (MW ∼ 40000, Loba Chemie) and 0.75 wt% H2O in a formamide-based electrolyte using a galvanostatic anodization method for 2.5 h at 0 °C; see Fig. 1 in the ESI.† The pH of the electrolyte was controlled by the addition of 0.1 M acetic acid to the solution. Prior to anodization, the electrolyte was stirred for 1.15 h at 100 °C. After anodization, the samples were rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. The as-anodized samples were crystallized by air annealing at 200 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C for 1.5 h with heating and cooling rates of 1 °C min−1. Detailed information on the characterization tools is available in the ESI.†

Fig. 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the fabricated sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular structures before and after annealing. Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of the as-anodized TiO2 nanotubes with an average pore diameter of 20 ± 3 nm and an average length of 70 ± 10 nm. It is worth noting that previous attempts at galvanostatic anodization of titanium foil resulted in either porous nanostructures27,28 or long nanotubes (several microns).29,30 It is noteworthy to mention that, regardless of the anodization time (30–150 min), the resulting nanotubes were identical in terms of morphology, especially the tube length, see Fig. S1 in the ESI.† It is also worth noting that the nanoarchitectures are reproducible whether the anodization is carried out at room temperature or at 0 °C; yet, the current is easier to control at 0 °C.
To further investigate the morphology of the sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular structures, they were peeled off the titanium foil and examined under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The tubular shape of the as-anodized sub-100 nm structures was confirmed as shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c shows the HR-TEM image of the as-anodized nanotubes, revealing their partial crystallinity. The TEM and HR-TEM images of the nanotubes annealed at 400 °C are shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively. The inset in Fig. 1c demonstrates the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the annealed nanotubes. The lattice distance shown in Fig. 1f is 0.4 nm, corresponding to that of the anatase phase. It is worth noting that the nanotubes preserve their morphology after annealing, revealing their structural stability.
To get an insight into the mechanism of formation of the sub-100 nm tubular architectures, the titanium foil was anodized for shorter times (1–5 min). It was found that long nanotubes are first formed (Fig. 3 in the ESI†). Beneath the layer of the long nanotubes exists the layer of interest of the sub-100 nm tubes. The voltage ramping caused the layer of the long nanotubes to fall, exposing the layer of the sub-100 nm tubes.
The XRD patterns of the as-anodized and the annealed sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular arrays are shown in Fig. 2a. The diffraction pattern shows the partial crystallinity of the as-anodized nanotubes fabricated in PVP-rich electrolytes (two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.9° and 38°), while those fabricated in PVP-free electrolytes are totally amorphous. Therefore, the use of galvanostatic anodization in the presence of PVP not only enables the fabrication of sub-100 nm tubes but also induces partial crystallinity of the material. The XRD pattern of the annealed samples confirms the crystallization of the sub-100 nm TiO2 architectures in the regular anatase phase with the appearance of the characteristic diffraction peaks at 25.3°, 37.7°, 47.8°, 53.8°, and 54.9°, corresponding to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) facets, respectively.31 It is worth noting that the (004) peak intensity increases with increasing annealing temperature. Starting at 400 °C, the (004) peak intensity starts to increase more than that of the (101), see Fig. S5 in the ESI.† In conclusion, the crystallinity of the as-anodized sample is relatively low and the crystallite size is calculated to be ca. 6 nm according to the Scherrer equation from the broadening of the anatase (101) reflection. Annealing at 350 °C and 400 °C greatly enhances the crystallinity of the material; however, with an increase in the crystallite size (ca. 9 nm). To get an insight into the stability of the material upon annealing, Fig. S3 in the ESI† shows the SEM images of the annealed sub-100 nm TiO2 tubes at temperatures ranging from 350 °C to 600 °C. Annealing at temperatures below 600 °C did not seem to affect the morphology of the nanotubes. However, when annealed at 600 °C, the structure was destroyed. The protrusions emanating from the underlying titanium support are believed to be the major cause of the material degradation at this temperature.31 Raman spectroscopy is used to further characterize the as-anodized and the annealed sub-100 nm TiO2 tubes, see Fig. 2b. Based on the space group D4h for anatase and assuming site symmetries for the Ti and O atoms within the unit cell, six Raman-allowed transitions can be assigned (1A1g, 2B1g and 3Eg).32,33 It is worth noting that four Raman-active modes were observed for our material as Eg (148 cm−1), B1g (397 cm−1), A1g (516 cm−1) and Eg (636 cm−1), confirming the formation of the anatase phase upon annealing. The as-anodized sample showed two broad bands at 300–350 cm−1 and 600–650 cm−1 with one sharp peak at 479 cm−1, confirming the partial crystallinity of the as-anodized nanotubes, in accordance with the XRD results. The weak and broad bands observed at 780–790 cm−1 can be assigned as the first overtone of the B1g mode.33 According to the bond length/Raman frequency/covalency correlations,34 the following relationship between Ti–O bond lengths (R) and Raman frequency (v) shifts was reported:35 vTi–O = 722e−1.54946(R−1.809)(1)
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD, (b) Raman and (c and d) XPS spectra of the sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular architectures. 
The calculated Ti–O bond lengths (2 × 1.90, 3 × 2.03 and 2.14 Å) based on the observed Raman bands at 636, 516, and 397 cm−1 are consistent with the slightly distorted TiO68− octahedron in anatase (Ti–O bond lengths for bulk anatase are 4 × 1.9338 Å and 2 × 1.9797 Å).32 Also, based on the sharp Raman band at 148 cm−1, the calculated bond length is 2.95 Å, which is consistent with Ti–Ti bonding present in the octahedral chains.33
To further investigate the composition of the fabricated sub-100 nm TiO2 architectures, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha XPS with an Al anode. The spectra were charge referenced to O 1s at 532 eV. Fig. 2c shows the O 1s photoemission spectra, where one signal at 530.87 eV was observed that can be attributed to the lattice oxygen in TiO2.36Fig. 2d shows the Ti 2p photoemission spectra with two peaks obtained corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 photoemissions with a spin–orbit splitting of 5.8 eV, confirming that both signals correspond to Ti4+, with the Ti/O molar ratio being close to the stoichiometric proportion.36
To investigate the optical properties of the fabricated electrodes, the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of both the as-anodized and annealed sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular arrays were measured, see Fig. 3a. The spectra of the as-anodized TiO2 sample show a fundamental absorption edge in the UV region at 378 nm, typical for anatase TiO2 with a band-gap energy of ca. 3.2 eV. As the annealing temperature increases, a very slight red shift appears in the spectra, reaching 400 nm for the sample annealed at 400 °C. It is worth noting that the as-anodized sample showed another broad absorption peak extending from 400 to 800 nm, which can be attributed to the existence of defects and trapped holes.37,38 This broad peak was diminished with increasing annealing temperature, indicating that annealing improves the crystallinity and helps eliminate the defects.35,37

A preliminary proof-of-concept photoelectrochemical activity test for water photoelectrolysis using the synthesized sub-100 nm TiO2 tube arrays was carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent density versus potential in 1 M KOH solution under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) for the as-anodized as well as annealed TiO2 nanotubes. The dark current was less than 50 μA cm−2 for all samples over the displayed potential range. The maximum photocurrent exhibited by the TiO2 nanotubes annealed at 400 °C was 0.37 mA cm−2 at 0.8VNHE. It is worth noting that this photocurrent is almost 3 times higher than that reported for long nanotubes.31,39,40 The high photocurrent-to-dark current ratio implies that the majority of the photocurrent is generated only by absorbed photons with no dark-current contribution. Also, the onset potential (−0.87 and −0.85VNHE for the nanotubes annealed at 350 °C and 400 °C, respectively), the light contribution toward the minimum potential needed for the water splitting process to take place, is more negative than that reported for long nanotubes (−0.7 to −0.8VNHE).31,41 Therefore, the sub-100 nm tubes require less voltage for water oxidation than the conventional long nanotube counterparts, indicating more favorable photoelectrochemical activity. This remarkable photoelectrochemical activity can, in part, be related to the small crystallite size in the fabricated sub-100 nm tubes (6–9 nm). As the particle size decreases, the ratio of surface-to-bulk defects should increase.42 This will result in strong positive effects from surface defects that are enough to overcome the negative effects from bulk defects, leading to the observed enhancement in photocurrent.42 It is worth noting that the quantization effect cannot be considered for TiO2 particles with sizes > 3 nm.42,43
To assess the stability of the sub-100 nm TiO2 tubular structures, the transient photocurrent (J–t) test was carried out under light on/off conditions at a constant external bias of 0.8VNHE, as shown in Fig. 3c. The photocurrent of the tested electrodes decays very sharply under light-off conditions without exhibiting pronounced photocurrent tails, suggesting that the fabricated photoanodes have excellent carrier transport properties. To better understand the charge carrier collection efficiency in the sub-100 nm TiO2 tubes, incident photon-to-current collection efficiency (IPCE) experiments were performed under no applied bias. The experiments were performed in a two-electrode cell with the nanotube film as the working photoelectrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode in 1.0 M KOH solution. The IPCE was calculated using eqn (2), where λ is the wavelength of the incident light, Jph is the photocurrent density under illumination at λ and Io is the incident light intensity at λ: (2)

Fig. 3d shows the obtained IPCE curves for the as-anodized as well as the annealed sub-100 nm TiO2 tubes. The annealed samples showed higher IPCE values compared to the as-anodized samples, reaching 37% for the samples annealed at 400 °C. This can be related to the better crystallinity and the reduced defects upon annealing, in agreement with the Raman and XRD results. It is worth noting that the obtained IPCE values are among the highest reported for undoped TiO2 under no applied bias.23,31
To get more insights into the interfacial properties of the sub-100 nm tubes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were done for both the long nanotubes (1 μm) and the sub-100 nm tubes under dark conditions. The applied voltage was swept from −0.7 V to 0.6 V, while the frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1000 kHz. Fig. 4a shows the obtained Nyquist plots. The semicircle for the short titania electrode is smaller than that for the long ones, indicating a faster electron transfer at the sub-100 nm tube/electrolyte interface. This was also asserted by the Mott–Schottky analysis as depicted in the inset of Fig. 4a. The Mott–Schottky plot shows a positive slope, which is typical for n-type semiconductors, revealing a flat band potential of −0.77VSCE with a charge carrier density of 37.4 × 1018 cm−3. These values are in agreement with the values reported in the literature.44,45.

Based on the promising results upon the use of the sub-100 nm tubes in solar-to-fuel conversion, we have tested the tubes (70 ± 10 nm) in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) devices, Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c shows the J–V characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs using the sub-100 nm tubes annealed at 400 °C sensitized with the N719 dye. Table 1 lists the parameters representing the performance of the fabricated solar cells. The sub-100 nm tubes showed a maximum backside illumination efficiency of η = 7.07% (±0.2), which is very close to that of the TiO2 nanotube-based DSSCs that hold the record (7.12%).46 Treating the sub-100 nm tubes with TiCl4 (see details in the ESI†) improved the overall efficiency of the solar cell devices. For example, after treating the sub-100 nm tubes with four sequential layers of TiCl4 (as commonly used in titania nanoparticle-based solar cells47), the efficiency increased to 9.26%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported under backside illumination. This was also accompanied by an increase in the Jsc from 15.37 to 17.94 mA cm−2. The enhanced efficiency can, in part, be due to the increased specific dye loading from 95 nM cm−2 for the untreated nanotubes to 152 nM cm−2 for the 4-layer TiCl4-treated nanotubes. Also, the TiCl4 treatment was reported to strongly improve the transport properties in titania-based DSSCs through the passivation of defects47 as evidenced by the increase in Voc (Fig. 4c) and the short electron transfer time constants τc (as measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy) upon TiCl4 treatment, see Fig. 4d. Also, due to the very small thickness of the tubes, the largest amount of photogenerated charge carriers should be injected into the TiO2 closer to the back electrode. Therefore, carriers would experience a short resistance path before being collected at the back contact and thus result in the observed higher efficiency.48,49

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile and scalable method to fabricate sub-100 nm long TiO2 tubular architectures with diameters of 20 ± 3 nm. The addition of PVP to the anodization electrolyte enables the synthesis of partially crystalline nanotubes with predominant (004) facets. Annealing at high temperature resulted in a sustained growth of the (004) facet. Using the sub-100 nm titania thin films as photoanodes to photoelectrochemically split water, the obtained photocurrent and IPCE are at least twice those reported in the literature for micron-long nanotubes. The transient photocurrent, EIS and Mott–Schottky analyses of the short nanotubes indicate a faster electron transfer at the nanotube/electrolyte interface. Upon their use in DSSCs, the sub-100 nm tubes showed a power conversion efficiency as high as 9.3%. The current work confirmed the importance of using short titania nanotubes as photoanodes to ensure efficient solar water splitting and solar-to-electric conversion. We highly encourage their assembly in many other systems, especially for MOSFETs.
