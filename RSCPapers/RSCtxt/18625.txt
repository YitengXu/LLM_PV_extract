    , Accepted 29th September 2022First published on 30th September 2022AbstractFor high-performance silicon–carbon (Si–C)-based anode materials used in high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), there is an urgent need to rationally construct a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and load a high proportion of silicon content, which is closely related to the capacity and cycling stability of the electrode. Herein, composites of Fe/Fe3C-modified carbon nanofiber–coated Si nanoparticles (Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs) were synthesized via a simple electrospinning method. These composites effectively overcome the volume change effect, poor interfacial compatibility and low conductivity, delivering excellent LIB performance. Tested at 2.0 A g−1, Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs provides a high reversible capacity of 956.5 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5% even after 4000 ultra-long stable cycles. The high conductivity of the Fe/Fe3C embedded in the CNF framework can promote e− transfer and boost the Li+ diffusion kinetics in the electrode. The catalytic activity of Fe/Fe3C helps to enhance the interfacial compatibility, grow a balanced stable SEI film and promote the long-cycle stability of the electrode at room temperature.
1. Introduction
The currently used graphite anode material is close to its specific capacity limit of 372 mA h g−1, which is far from meeting the demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 5G high-power electronic products.1–4 The silicon anode, with more than 10 times the theoretical specific capacity of graphite, has become the most likely potential alternative material to meet this demand.5 However, when silicon is used as an anode material in LIBs, it faces the following three obstacles: (i) significant volume expansion, (ii) poor conductivity and (iii) poor interfacial compatibility with the electrolyte.6,7 Moreover, these obstacles directly induce a series of adverse effects, including electrode polarization, active material rupture and reconstruction, poor contact and the failure of lithium storage activity, which seriously damage LIB performance.8
In recent years, a large amount of research has been devoted to solving the problems faced by silicon–carbon (Si–C) anode materials, and remarkable progress has been achieved. Generally, carbon coating treatment,9 surface modification,10 and introducing nanostructures such as nanowires,11 nanospheres,12 and nanosheets,13 have been proved to be effective solutions. It is reported that active materials made of Si nanoparticles (NPs) smaller than the critical expansion size of 200 nm can achieve structural integrity and consistency during cycle processes and effectively avoid the pulverization of the NPs.14 However, Si NP materials cannot hinder the continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and maintain the stability of the electrode.15,16 In this regard, coating a carbon layer on the surface of Si NPs can effectively prevent the direct contact between the electrolyte and silicon material, thus improving the stability of the SEI film to a certain extent. Additionally, the carbon coating layer can further improve the conductivity of Si-based anode materials and reduce the polarization effect during cycling processes.17 Carbon materials used in combination with Si NPs can be divided into graphite, pyrolysis carbon materials and nanostructured carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanospheres, and carbon nanofibers.18 In particular, carbon nanofibers, possessing flexibility and a 3-dimensional conductive network structure, are often used to coat Si NPs to improve the LIB properties of Si–C anode materials.19,20
Unfortunately, a carbon layer simply coated on Si NPs would still possess some disadvantages, including cycling instability, incompatible interface, and non-homogeneous growth of the SEI film. The large capacity and long cycling life of LIBs depend on overcoming these crucial obstacles. Therefore, in addition to coating a carbon layer on Si NPs, surface/interface modification is the key to improve Si–C composites by reducing interfacial side reactions and forming a stable SEI film to obtain a long cycling life. Research shows that adding some non-carbon materials, such as the metal oxides (ZnO,21,22 Al2O3,23,24 and TiO2 (ref. 25 and 26)), metal nitrides (TiN (ref. 27 and 28)), metal carbides (Fe3C (ref. 29–32)) and metal particles (Fe (ref. 33) and Cu (ref. 34)), can effectively increase conductivity and optimize interfacial compatibility. Particularly, adding metal oxides helps improve the LIB performance by reducing the HF component from the decomposition of the LiPF6 electrolyte, which promotes the agglomeration of Si NPs after discharge–charge processes. Moreover, previous reports confirmed that the introduction of Fe3C with catalytic activity can increase the charge transfer and catalyze the decomposition of the SEI components.29,32,35,36 Previously, our group added Fe/Fe3C to CNFs using electrospinning technology to effectively generate stable SEI films and improve the Li+ transport kinetics, showing significantly enhanced electrochemical performance.29 By revealing the changes in the SEI films in the cycling process, He's group affirmed that Fe3C catalytic particles can realize the reversible conversion of organic and inorganic components of SEI films and provide additional lithium storage capacity.32 Based on the previous results, the introduction of Fe/Fe3C into Si–C-based anode materials should be highly expected, but this has never been reported.
In this work, we first prepare a 3-dimensional core–shell structure with Si NPs encapsulated in Fe/Fe3C-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs) that exhibits high conductivity, robust structure and fast Li+ transfer kinetics. Using Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs as an anode material for LIBs, a high reversible capacity of 956.5 mA h g−1 tested at 2.0 A g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5% even after 4000 ultra-long stable cycles can be obtained. For Si–C anodes, such an excellent result is almost comparable to the best performance reported so far. Moreover, a series of techniques, including GITT, CV, KPFM, EIS, and XPS etching analysis, were used to clearly reveal the interfacial compatibility and structural stabilization mechanism induced by this rational construct. Our results demonstrate that effective design of active materials with electrospinning technology can provide a promising pathway towards future customized high-energy/power Si–C anode materials.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), polyacrylonitrile (PAN, MW about 150000), Si nanoparticles (Si NPs), ferrous oxalate dihydrate (FeC2O4·2H2O), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), super-P, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), 1,1-difluoroethylene (PVDF) and 1 M LiPF6 (dissolved in ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and dimethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1:1) with a 5 wt% addition of fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC) were supplied by Aladdin Chem. Co., Ltd. All raw materials were used directly without further treatment.
2.2 Material fabrication
In a typical synthesis, FeC2O4·2H2O was dissolved in DMF under magnetic stirring to obtain a yellow solution, into which Si NPs were dispersed homogeneously via ultrasonication for 1.0 h. Next, PAN was slowly added to the dispersion with continuous stirring for 12 h at 60 °C. The mass ratio of PAN:Si:FeC2O4·2H2O is shown in Table S2.† Subsequently, the obtained suspension was transferred to a 10 mL injection syringe followed by electrospinning treatment. During the electrospinning process, a high-voltage power supply was used to provide a 15 kV high voltage, and the needle-to-collector distance and feed rate were maintained at 15 cm and 0.8 mL h−1, respectively. Afterwards, the sample was dried for 24 h under vacuum at 80 °C and stabilized at 260 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The stabilized sample was annealed in Ar flow at 900 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to form the Fe/Fe3C–Si@C-CNFs composites. For comparison, the composite material was prepared without Fe/Fe3C under the same conditions and is referred to as Si@CNFs.
2.3 Material characterization
The structures of the resultant products were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku SCXmini X-ray diffractometer with Cu radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) in the range of 10°–80° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. The Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw confocal Raman microspectroscope (Renishaw Co. Ltd., Gloucestershire, U.K.) with a laser excitation wavelength of 780 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, NETZSCH STA449C) was performed at a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1 from 10 to 1000 °C under air flow. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250Xi) was used to analyze the chemical bonds. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to measure the specific surface area and porosity. The morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI, SU-8010) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F).
2.4 Coin-type half-cell assembly and electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the materials were estimated using CR2025 coin-type half-cells assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. The electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% super-P, and 10 wt% CMC dissolved in deionized water to form a homogeneous slurry, which was then pasted on the current collector. The electrodes were compressed after drying at 100 °C in vacuum for 12 h. The coin cells comprise an electrode, lithium sheet, separator (polypropylene membrane, Celgard 2400) and 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte. The loading density of each electrode is 1.1 ± 0.2 mg cm−2. The preparation and assembly were performed with different proportions of silicon, carbon, and iron to serve as a comparison. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a LAND CT2001 instrument (Wuhan LAND Electronics. Ltd., China). Here, the mass to calculate the specific capacity is based on the total mass of the active materials of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs or Si@CNFs. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests at different scanning rates and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 MHz were conducted on a CHI760E electrochemical workstation.
2.5 Coin-type full-cell assembly and electrochemical measurements
Coin-type full-cells of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs‖LiCoO2 were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. First, the cathode material was mixed with super-P and PVDF binder with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 and dissolved in NMP solvent to form a homogeneous slurry, which was then pasted on Al foil. The electrodes were compressed after drying at 100 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The areal loadings of the cathode and anode active substances are ∼9.5 and ∼1.0 mg cm−2, respectively. The electrolyte is 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in EC, DMC, and DEC (1:1:1 by volume) with a 5 wt% addition of FEC. Before assembling the full-cell, the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrodes were tested at 0.1 A g−1 three times for prelithiation treatment, then used as anodes for the full-cell. An anode-to-cathode area capacity ratio of 1.1 was adopted. The full-cell was tested in a voltage range of 2.5–4.3 V using a LAND CT2001 instrument.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure
The detailed preparation of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs with a conductive network structure and flexibility is shown in Fig. 1. The interconnected Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs composite was prepared via a facile electrospinning strategy using Si NPs, FeC2O4·2H2O and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as raw materials and a carbonization process under argon protection at 900 °C. For comparison, Si@CNFs was prepared in the same way without adding FeC2O4·2H2O. The nanostructures and morphologies of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and their images at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 2 and S1–S3.†

 Fig. 2  (a–c) SEM and TEM images, (d–f) HR-TEM images, (g) SAED result and (h–l) elemental mapping images of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs. 
The SEM images at different magnifications for Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs (Fig. 2a, b, S1a and b†) compared with those of pure Si@CNFs (Fig. S1c and d†) visually illustrate the interconnected networks formed by nanofibers embedded and anchored with the Si NPs. The SEM results confirm that there is no significant change in structure and morphology after forming Fe/Fe3C. Interestingly, the interconnected networks provide channels for the rapid transfer of electrons and ions, contributing to the enhanced transport kinetics.19 To further understand the internal structure of the nanofibers, TEM was performed. The typical TEM image in Fig. 2c clearly reveals the Si NPs in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs embedded in or attached to the CNFs. Meanwhile, similar morphologies and internal structures for Si@CNFs are found in Fig. S3a and b.† Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs in Fig. 2d shows that the Si NPs have a thin coating layer containing Fe/Fe3C and pyrolytic carbon on the surface. The coating layer not only prevents the direct contact of Si NPs with the electrolyte and plays a certain buffer role for expansion and contraction but also improves the interfacial compatibility and reduces the side reactions and the components of the SEI film.35 However, Si@CNFs does not feature improved interfacial compatibility, which is attributed to the fact that there is only a thin carbon coating on the surface of the Si NPs, as shown by HR-TEM in Fig. S3c.† In addition, lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm were detected for both samples, corresponding to the (111) plane of Si, as shown in the insets of Fig. S3c† and 2e. Notably, Fig. 2f indicates the presence of Fe3C, revealing the (200) plane of Fe3C with a lattice spacing of 0.25 nm in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs.31 In addition, Fig. 2e and f show magnified views of the two areas selected in Fig. 2d and list their line profiles and FFT, as shown in Fig. S2.† Detailed crystal information of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs is presented by the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image in Fig. 2g, which shows prominent diffraction rings, corresponding to the (311), (220), and (111) planes of crystal silicon and the (112) and (200) planes of Fe3C, further confirming the existence of Si and Fe3C.37,38 It is known from Fig. S3d† that the diffraction rings of Si can also be detected in Si@CNFs. The Fe and Si components can also be measured by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as seen in Fig. S4.† To check the distribution of elements, STEM and EDS elemental mapping of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs (Fig. 3h–l) was performed. The elements of C, O, Fe, and Si are well dispersed in the fibers, suggesting that the Si NPs are well-wrapped by Fe/Fe3C and a pyrolytic carbon layer.

The XRD patterns of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs are portrayed in Fig. 3a, in which diffraction peaks reflecting silicon were detected at 28.4°, 47.3°, 56.1°, 69.1°, and 76.4° (JCPDS# 27-1402), corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (400), and (331) planes, and the diffraction peak representing the CNFs was at ∼26°.16,17 In addition, Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs shows obvious diffraction peaks of Fe3C (JCPDS# 89-2867), which is the main component in the high-temperature annealing process,39,40 and weak diffraction peaks of Fe (JCPDS# 89-7194).32 In short, it is further demonstrated that Fe/Fe3C with a modified interface is successfully doped in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs. Subsequently, from Fig. 3b, it can be seen that Si accounts for 42% in Si@CNFs and 39% in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs. In addition, the proportion of Fe atoms is 4.8% in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs, and the specific calculation process can be seen in the ESI.† In addition to the D band (∼1330 cm−1) and G band (∼1580 cm−1), silicon peaks are observed in the Raman spectra of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs, as shown in Fig. 3d, indicating the presence of carbon and silicon. Typically, the D band represents the disordered/defective carbon source produced by the sp3 hybridization of graphite, while the G band corresponds to the E2g vibrational mode of the sp2 bond on the graphite basal plane.37 As can be seen from Fig. 3c, the specific surface areas of 42.7 and 24.2 m2 g−1 obtained by the Brunner–Emmet–Teller (BET) method can be assigned to Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs, respectively. Furthermore, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c, the pore size distribution of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs is mainly between 2 and 10 nm, showing more nanopores than Si@CNFs. This phenomenon is caused by the decomposition of FeC2O4·2H2O and the formation of Fe3C, which creates more nanopores. Obviously, an appropriate increase in the specific surface area and porosity of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs can alleviate the volume change, promote ion transport, facilitate the infiltration of the electrolyte, and improve the electrochemical performance.
The chemical composition of the sample surface was tested by XPS. It is known from the full spectra of the two samples that Fe 2p is only identified in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and not in Si@CNFs, as seen in Fig. 3e and S5a.† The C 1s spectrum of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs shown in Fig. 3g can be divided into four sub-peaks, which belong to the Fe–C (∼283.6 eV), C–C (∼284.8 eV), C–O (∼286.3 eV), and CO (∼289.6 eV) bonds.27,32 Herein, Fe–C is derived from Fe3C. Nevertheless, there are no Fe–C bonds in Fig. S5b,† and only the C 1s spectrum of Si@CNFs. The Si 2p spectra for the two samples displayed in Fig. 3h and S5d,† with Si–Si, Si–C, and SiOx bonds at 99.3, 100.2, and 103.6 eV, respectively, proves the existence of abundant chemical bonds between the complexes, which provide bridges for electron transfer between Si and C.21,41 The O 1s spectrum in Fig. 3f exhibits C–O (533.2 eV) and CO bonds (532.4 eV), and a similar situation exists in Si@CNFs (Fig. S5c†).42 Furthermore, the spectrum of Fe 2p can be divided into three pairs of peaks, as shown in Fig. 3i. The peaks located between 705 and 720 eV belong to Fe 2p3/2, including satellite peaks (717 eV), Fe3+ (711.2 eV) from the Fe–O on the surface and Fe0/FeC3 (707.8 eV).57–59 Accordingly, the peaks located between 721 and 735 eV correspond to Fe 2p1/2. Therefore, the spectrum of Fe 2p proves that Fe/FeC3 exists in the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs composite.
3.2 Electrochemical performance
To evaluate the electrochemical performances of Fe/Fe3C@Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs as anode materials for LIBs, the two samples were subjected to rate cycling and performance tests at different current densities as well as cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests. According to previous reports, too little Si content in Si–C materials is not conducive to improving the overall Li+ storage capacity, while too much Si content may lead to the decline of cycling stability.16,50 Moreover, the content of interface-modifying additives in Si–C materials has a similar effect, that is, too little may not promote LIB performance and too much will reduce the capacity.29 To determine the optimal ratio, the cycling performances of electrodes with different silicon and iron contents were compared, and the details can be seen in Fig. S6a and b.† The Fe/Fe3C@Si@CNFs composite with Si and Fe contents of ∼39% and ∼4.8%, respectively, shows the best cycling performance in this work.
The first five CV curves of the Si@CNFs and Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrodes seen in Fig. S7a–d† were obtained under the test conditions of 0.2 mV s−1 and 0.01–3.0 V, which were used to explore the redox processes of the electrodes. Interestingly, the peak intensities of these two electrodes increase with increasing cycle number, which can be attributed to the gradual activation of Si.17 The primary cathodic scanning loops of both electrodes have large reduction peaks at 0.5–1.0 V and broad peaks lasting to 0.01 V, which represent the formation of the irreversible SEI film vanishing in the subsequent cycles and the process of Li+ intercalation into the active material, respectively. In the following anodic curves for both samples, peaks of the oxidation pair appear at 0.3 V and 0.5 V, corresponding to the de-Li process of Li–Si alloys.43 Moreover, a small current peak appearing at ∼0.81 V in the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode is due to the decomposition of part of the SEI film catalyzed by Fe/Fe3C.36 In addition, as shown in Fig. S8,† the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode was subjected to ex situ XRD after 10 cycles to ascertain the existence of the diffraction peak of Fe/Fe3C, which further proves the catalytic effect of Fe/Fe3C and its stability during cycling processes. It can be seen from Fig. 4a and S9† that the specific capacity of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs does not decrease significantly after 10 cycles, while Si@CNFs shows an obvious capacity loss. Accordingly, Fig. 4c shows that Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs exhibit 1402.1 and 1078.9 mA h g−1, respectively, after 50 cycles at 0.3 A g−1. The above results demonstrate that the electrode modified with Fe/Fe3C can effectively alleviate the capacity fading and improve the LIB performance. Furthermore, Fig. 4b reveals the rate capabilities of these two electrodes evaluated at different current rates from 0.3 to 5 A g−1. The electrode modified with Fe/Fe3C clearly delivers better electrochemical performance at different current densities. Even at a high current density of 5.0 A g−1, it exhibits a stable specific capacity of 991.8 mA h g−1 and when the current density rises to 0.3 A g−1, the specific capacity swiftly returns to 1373.4 mA h g−1. Unfortunately, the Si@CNFs electrode presents only 742.4 mA h g−1 under 5.0 A g−1 after 110 cycles. The charge/discharge profiles of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs electrodes at different current densities are depicted Fig. S7c and d.†
 Fig. 4  Electrochemical performances of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNF and Si@CNFs anodes for LIBs: (a) typical discharge–charge profiles tested at 0.3 A g−1; (b) rate performance; (c) cycling performance at 0.3 A g−1; (d) electrochemical performance comparison; (e) cycling performance at 1.0 A g−1; (f) cycling performance at 2.0 A g−1. 
Additionally, these two electrodes underwent long discharge/charge testing at 0.6 and 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. S6c† and 4e), which also verified that Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs has better electrochemical reversibility and structural stability. As shown in Fig. S6c,† after 400 cycles at a current density of 0.6 A g−1, the Si@CNFs electrode exhibits an adverse phenomenon of rapid capacity decay delivered with only 561.1 mA h g−1 of the remaining capacity, while Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs exhibits 1173.9 mA h g−1. Similarly, the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs electrodes exhibit first charge/discharge capacities of 1628.8/2171.7 mA h g−1 and 1577.3/2302.6 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to 75.0% and 68.5% coulombic efficiencies in the first cycling process. After 500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, as depicted in Fig. 4e, the former sample with Fe/Fe3C modification exhibits a significantly better capacity of 1134.2 mA h g−1 compared to the latter, with a capacity of only 487.1 mA h g−1, and their capacity retention rates are ∼81% and ∼42%, respectively. Rapid capacity fading is associated with the structural fracture and pulverization of active materials and the interfacial failure between the electrode and electrolyte caused by the SEI film.44 Surprisingly, as the current density increased to a high current density of 2.0 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 4f, the reversible capacity of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs remains large (956.5 mA h g−1) even after 4000 cycles, with a high coulombic efficiency of above 99.5%. After coating the Fe/Fe3C-doped carbon layer, the greatly improved cycling performance can be attributed to the fact that Fe/Fe3C doping not only boosts the electrical conductivity, which is beneficial to alleviating the polarization problem caused by the continuous cycling process, but also ameliorates the interfacial compatibility and structural stability.
To better illustrate that the obtained Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs have excellent durability and the potential for long-cycle practical application as an anode material for LIBs, a comparison of the LIB performances of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and recently reported Si-based anodes are listed in Fig. 4d and Table S3.†45–49 For Si–C anodes, the obtained performance is comparable to the best results reported in the last four years. Particularly, the 4000-cycle performance results are almost the best reported so far. For the Si@CNFs electrode, electrodes of Si@CNFs with Fe/Fe3C modification provide significantly enhanced LIB performance, including initial coulombic efficiencies, subsequent coulombic efficiencies, cycling stability and reversible capacity. However, the enhanced mechanism for LIB performance needs to be analyzed. In section 3.3, the question of whether Fe/Fe3C modification can improve the interfacial compatibility, optimize the growth of the SEI film, enhance the e− and Li+ transfer, and finally improve the LIB performance is comprehensively investigated.
3.3 Discussion of the enhanced performance mechanism
To illustrate the redox kinetic processes of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs electrodes, CV tests at different scan rates (0.2–2.0 mV s−1) were performed. It can be seen from Fig. 5a and S10a† that these curves, including the redox peaks, maintain a similar shape as the scan rate increases, demonstrating the good reversibility of the electrodes. The peak current (i) is related to the scan rate (v) as follows:37 i = avb(1) log(i) = b × log(v) + log(a)(2)where a and b are two adjustable parameters, and the value of b can be obtained from the slope of the log (v) − log (i) curve. When b is equal to 0.5 or 1, the storage type of Li+ belongs to diffusion-controlled behavior or the surface capacitance process, respectively. Correspondingly, the b values of the two electrodes are shown in Fig. 5b and S10b,† reflecting that their Li+ storage kinetics belong to the diffusion-controlled mechanism in addition to pseudocapacitive control. More precisely, the specific percentages of the diffusion-controlled and capacitive mechanisms can be quantified using the following equations: i(v) = k1v1/2 + k2v(3) i(v)/v1/2 = k1 + k2v1/2(4)where k1v1/2 and k2v denote diffusion-controlled and pseudocapacitive behavior, respectively. The values of k1 and k2 can be obtained from eqn (4). Fig. 5c shows that with an increasing scanning rate of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode, the percentage of capacitance increases gradually; the percentages of capacitance of 62%, 65%, 69%, 72%, 74% and 84% correspond to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mV s−1. Although the Si@CNFs electrode exhibits a similar increase in capacitance percentage (Fig. S10c†), the percentage is smaller at each rate than that of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode, as shown in Fig. 5d. The higher percentage of capacitance on the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode can be attributed to the following: (1) the reversible decomposition of part of the SEI film catalyzed by Fe3C supplies additional capacity in Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs;32 (2) the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs sample provides a larger specific surface area than Si@CNFs derived from the decomposition of FeC2O4·2H2O. In general, the larger pseudocapacitive percentage of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode is conducive to rapid Li-ion storage kinetics and effectively improves the rate performance.

In addition, Fig. 5e and f highlight the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) tests performed on the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs electrodes to assess their reaction kinetics. The electrodes were charged and discharged continuously at a test current density of 200 mA g−1, with a pulse time and relaxation time of 30 min. The lithium-ion diffusion efficiency (DLi) can be calculated using the following equation:51 (5)where L (cm) is the diffusion length of lithium ions (for a dense electrode, L (cm) is the electrode thickness); τ (s) is the relaxation time; 2ΔEs (V) is the steady-state potential change caused by the current pulse; and ΔEt (V) is the potential change after the iR drop is eliminated by a constant current pulse, as shown in Fig. S11.† The average DLi+ based on the second cycle of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode is 4.47 × 10−11 cm s−1, higher than that of Si@CNFs (4.79 × 10−12 cm s−1), which proves that the addition of Fe/Fe3C in the coating can facilitate the ionic diffusion of the material. Meaningfully, the KPFM, EIS and CV results of the former are better than those of the latter, confirming that the improved lithium-ion diffusion kinetics derived from Fe/Fe3C modification can afford better electrochemical performance than the pure electrodes. The results of KPFM and EIS are displayed in Fig. S12 and S13.†
To further study the influence of the SEI layer on the electrode performance, SEM and XPS were performed on the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs electrodes before and after 100 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, as shown in Fig. 6 and 7. As can be seen from the SEM images of the fresh electrodes in Fig. 6a and c, both have clearly visible nanofibers. After 100 cycles under the same test conditions, the nanofibers and silicon nanoparticles of the Si@CNFs electrode have been blurred and agglomerated, which is attributed to the expansion, contraction and disintegration of the Si active materials and the thick SEI film covering the surface, resulting in the disappearance of the nanofibers conducive to electron/ion diffusion (Fig. 6b).44 The thick SEI film on the CNF surface is caused by the continuous side reaction of the electrolyte and the accumulation of irreversible species, which gradually prevent the effective contact between the active material and the electrolyte and affect the subsequent cycling performance of LIBs. In general, the HF decomposed from the electrolyte in the cyclic reaction process etches the surface of the active material and forms an unstable Si–H thin-layer with strong affinity, which accelerates the agglomeration of the active material.23 Conversely, adding an Fe/Fe3C-modified additive catalyzes the reversible decomposition of the SEI film to the electrode and can significantly modulate the amount and components of the SEI film and ameliorate the LIB performance.32 Hence, separated nanofibers are still visible in Fig. 6d after 100 cycles for the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode. The above phenomenon is due to the relatively thin SEI film on the surface of the material, indicating that maintaining good conductive contact between the electrolyte and the material is beneficial to the stable long cycling of LIBs. A schematic diagram of the electrode modification evolution mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 6e and f.

In order to compare the SEI of the cycled Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs samples, HR-TEM was used to observe the morphology and other information of these electrodes after 300 cycles. From Fig. S14,† it can be seen that the cycled Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode vaguely shows Si particles embedded in the CNF framework, while the pure Si@CNFs electrode is evidently blurred due to aggregation, indicating that electrode agglomeration is more serious in the absence of Fe/Fe3C. In addition, comparison of the SAED patterns shows that the Si components in these two electrodes are amorphous after cycling, and that the Fe3C phase still exists in the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs sample, which is consistent with the TEM results. As is well known, P, F, and O are the constituent elements of the SEI film, and their greater abundance indicates a thicker SEI layer, which is more unfavorable to the cycling stability. From the EDS results in Fig. S15,† it can be seen that the peak intensities of P, F and O in the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode were significantly lower than those with pure Si@CNFs. Moreover, the elemental mapping results show that Si@CNFs is almost completely wrapped by the elements of P, F, and O, while Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs shows only scattered signals.60–63 These results reveal that Fe/Fe3C incorporation can inhibit the excessive formation of the SEI film, enhance the interfacial compatibility, and ultimately improve the battery performance.
XPS with different etching depths was used to reveal the changes of the SEI film after cycling and further confirm the performance-strengthening mechanism of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs. It can be seen from the C 1s spectrum in Fig. 7a and b that the main peaks of the two electrode materials are those of the C–C and C–O/CO bonds in the post-cycling test. It is worth mentioning that due to the complex composition of organic compounds in the SEI film, the sub-peaks other than the C–C bond are collectively referred to as C–O/CO bonds from the decomposition of organic matter in the electrolyte.52,53 Moreover, the C–C bond mainly comes from carbon fiber and conductive carbon. Comparing the XPS results on the surfaces of these two electrodes, the peak area percentage of the C–O/CO bond on the Si@CNFs electrode surface is larger than that of the C–C bond, indicating that a large amount of SEI film is irreversibly accumulated on the electrode surface. In contrast, the opposite phenomenon occurs in the electrode modified with Fe/Fe3C, which proves that introducing Fe/Fe3C is beneficial to the reversible decomposition of the SEI film and reduces SEI film formation. With the deepening of the etching depth, the percentage of peak area occupied by the C–O/CO bond (C 1s) of the two electrodes also decreases, that is, the SEI film composition decreases continuously, but the SEI film thickness of the pure electrode is larger than that of the electrode modified with Fe/Fe3C. Interestingly, the appearance of the LixSiy peak represents the end of the SEI film.21 According to the Si 2p spectra of both electrodes displayed in Fig. S16a and b,† it can be clearly seen that the electrode modified with Fe3C has an apparent LixSiy signal significantly earlier than the pure electrode, and the LixSiy intensity of the pure electrode is obviously weaker than that of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs, which demonstrates that Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs has a thinner SEI film than Si@CNFs. In addition, the O 1s peak intensity of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode remains basically unchanged with the deepening of etching, indicating that the SEI film on Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs is relatively stable, while the Si@CNFs electrode produced more sub-peaks from unknown side reactions (Fig. S16c and d†). Thus, ion/electron diffusion is limited by the accumulation of too many components formed in the Si@CNFs electrodes, resulting in a sharp decline in the cycling performance of the corresponding LIBs.
To further prove that the electrolyte in the electrode without Fe/Fe3C decomposes and produces more side reactions and SEI layers, the F 1s spectra were analyzed and are exhibited in Fig. 7c and d. It is revealed that Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs have organic fluorine from LixPOyFz and LixPFy and metal fluorine from Li–F and Fe–F, indicating that a dense inorganic component of the SEI film contains metal fluorine.32,54,55 Interestingly, it has been reported that metal fluorine can not only effectively prevent electron tunneling and accelerate the diffusion of Li+ in the SEI film but can also prevent the electrode from collapsing during volume expansion/contraction. However, organic fluorine is more likely to produce HF, which can corrode silicon–carbon, affecting the stable long cycling of the LIBs. For the electrode with Fe/Fe3C, the proportion of the metal fluorine intensity peak always dominates at different etching depths for F 1s. In contrast, the pure electrode was occupied by organic fluorine through most of the etching depths, which proved that the pure electrode produced more adverse factors during its cycle, including more side reactions, more electrolyte consumption, and thicker SEI film accumulation, which corrupted the subsequent long cycles of its LIBs. Finally, as can be seen from Fig. S16e and f,† LiF is the main sub-peak of the Li spectrum of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode and has better electrochemical performance than Li–O, while the Si@CNFs electrode is dominated by Li–O bonds at shallow etching depths.56 The P 2p spectra of both electrodes, mainly derived from the decomposition of LiPF6, can been seen in Fig. S16g and h.† Importantly, based on the comprehensive observation of the XPS etching and SEM, schematic illustrations of the SEI structure formed on the Si anode for Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs and Si@CNFs are displayed in Fig. 7e and f. Similar to previous reports,29,32,35 Fe3C incorporation weakens the bond between the intermediate and Fe3C, promoting the decomposition of the SEI film, and Fe can further react with the SEI film components. The incorporation of Fe/Fe3C can effectively reduce the accumulation of SEI film components and delay electrode failure. Undoubtedly, the previously discussed results demonstrate that adding Fe/Fe3C can inhibit excessive formation of the SEI film, enhance interfacial compatibility and effectively boost the cycling performance of electrodes.
3.4 Evaluations of the practical prospects
To investigate the possibility of practical application for Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs in LIBs, a simple coin-type full-cell was assembled with a LiCoO2 cathode. Fig. 8 presents the related results and information. Fig. 8a shows a schematic diagram of the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs‖LiCoO2 coin-type full-cell. Before assembling the coin-type full-cell, the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrodes were tested at 0.1 A g−1 three times for prelithiation treatment, then used as anodes for the full-cell. Subsequently, the coin-type full-cell of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs‖LiCoO2 was tested at 2.5–4.3 V, as illustrated by the charge–discharge curves (the insets of Fig. 8b and c). In addition, the specific capacity of the coin-type full-cell was calculated based on the mass of the LiCoO2 cathode. As shown in Fig. 8b, the coin-type full-cell displays reversible capacities of 135, 100, and 83 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0C (1C = 140 mA g−1), respectively. Moreover, the coin-type full-cell of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs‖LiCoO2 was tested at 0.5C to evaluate its cycling performance. It is seen in Fig. 8c that the initial charge/discharge capacity of 143.6/134.3 mA h g−1, with an initial coulombic efficiency of 93.5%, is attributed to the prelithiation process lacking the ability to suppress the irreversible reactions of both the anode and cathode. As a result, it can retain a capacity of 84 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. In fact, the capacity of the coin-type LiCoO2 half-cell also declines and remains at 98 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C, as shown in Fig. S17.† These results further prove that we need to improve the battery assembly but do not affect the exploration suggestions for the practical application of Si–C anodes provided by the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs, which can reduce the formation of the SEI film. Finally, an LED was powered by the full-cells, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8c. Undoubtedly, this research on the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs composite provides an important reference for the practical application of Si–C anodes.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs composites with an interconnected network developed by a facile electrospinning method were used as an anode material for LIBs. In these, Fe/Fe3C with interfacial modification contributes to the enhancement of interfacial compatibility, the balanced growth of a stable SEI film, and the long-term stability of the electrode. As a result, the Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs electrode delivers excellent electrochemical performance, including an outstanding cycling stability of 956.5 mA h g−1 after 4000 ultra-long stable cycles at 2.0 A g−1. Moreover, the full-cell assembled with LiCoO2 further confirms the practicability of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs. It is believed that a novel Si–C-based anode of Fe/Fe3C–Si@CNFs can provide a feasible reference to ameliorate the problem of irreversible reactions in cycling and develop high-performance and ultra-long-cycle Si–C anodes for LIBs.
