To address these issues, an anode was developed for a dual-chambered PMFC with an abiotic cathode, via casting a nanocomposite matrix comprising CdTe quantum dots (QD), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and silk-fibroin (SF) on a graphite electrode. The nanocomposite matrix supported biofilm growth of the photo-catalyst Synechococcus sp., surged the bacterial photosystems (PS I and PS II) with appropriate light (λ650–750 nm) at a broad excitation spectrum (λ350–644 nm) through fluorescence resonance energy transfer and facilitated the metabolic electron relay through direct electron transfer (DET) to the anode. The maximum current density of the PMFC obtained with the nanocomposite bioanode (1.89 A m−2) was ∼5.7 fold higher than that of the corresponding blank graphite anode. The positive effect of QD was further confirmed from the fading reversal of polarity during the circadian cycle, leading to sustained current generation in the PMFC. The GNP reduced the band gap of the nanocomposite to 2.9 eV and decreased the charge transfer resistance by ∼9 fold, thus enabling DET on the electrode, as is evident from a pair of redox peaks of the bioanode with the formal potential of −156 mV. Structural studies demonstrated the rational interactions of the hydrophobic β-sheet of the SF with the nanomaterials. An unprecedented light conversion efficiency of 4.01% for the cyanobacteria was achieved with the nanocomposite bioanode-based PMFC.
1. Introduction
The interest in cyanobacteria as fuel cell catalysts is sharply increasing, owing to many advantages being identified on their use in these electrical power generating devices.1 These photosynthetic microorganisms are widespread in nature and can grow heterotrophically as well as photo-autotrophically in a self-sustainable manner following the carbon concentrating mechanism. The application potential of these microorganisms for combined power generation and waste treatment through photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) technology is vast due to their inherent survival capacity at high salt concentrations, in the presence of organic contaminants and under adverse environmental conditions. However, to develop an efficient, practical PMFC, a few critical issues need to be addressed first, among which the harvesting of adequate light energy to boost the photosynthetic machinery of the cells under low light conditions and the approach for capturing the metabolic electrons efficiently on the electrode surface are to be reckoned first. It must be mentioned that the theoretical maximal light energy conversion efficiency (LCE) of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria is ∼11%, as only ∼50% of the incident solar energy can be assessed.2,3 The mechanisms that are relied upon for capturing the metabolic electrons are mostly limited to direct electron transfer (DET) and mediating electron transfer (MET) processes, while a third approach involving bacterial nanowires for transferring the metabolic electrons to the electrode is in a nascent stage.4 When the PMFC is destined for deployment in an open environment situation, the design approach for developing the electrode may be focused on adopting the DET mechanism, as the complementary MET based approach is often snagged with gradual leaching of the chemical mediators, which are largely hazardous in nature and are thus unwanted from the ecological perspective.4,5 To implement the concept of DET in a microbial fuel cell for the steady generation of electric current, a naturally sustained close contact between the bacterial cells and the conductive electrode is a desired condition. To meet this condition, the creation of a natural bacterial biofilm over the electrode surface has been evolved as the method of choice for generating stable current from the cellular electrons in the fuel cell setup.6 However, the biofilms are usually formed slowly and their formation is governed by the nature of the support medium being used.7 Moreover, most of the electrode materials, such as graphite and conductive metals, commonly used in the fuel cell applications are either unreceptive or non-conducive to the bacterial growth to yield biofilms.8 Hence, the rapid development of biofilm on the electrode surface has been subsumed as an important domain in the microbial fuel cell research.
The biofilm research on cyanobacteria is mostly limited to the studies on its characterization and formation in natural habitats,9,10 whereas a systematic investigation on the preparation of cyanobacterial biofilm for fuel cell application is yet to be witnessed. Our previous studies established that the silk-fibroin (SF) promotes rapid biofilm growth of marine cyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp.11 Here, we utilized this biopolymer to induce the biofilm growth of Synechococcus sp. on a graphite electrode for developing the PMFC bioanode. However, while complying the biofilm growth on the electrode surface to address the issue of DET approach, an associated obstacle of poor electrical conduction of the underlying semiconducting silk-film needs to be overcome. Furthermore, to increase the photosynthetic metabolic activity of the cells beyond the basal level in the complex milieu of biofilm, the appropriate photon energy needs to be delivered to the cells underneath, which warrants an additional strategy in designing the electrodes. Notably, the design of a microbial photo-bioreactor is a critical issue since the light scattering and mutual shading caused by the increased biomass and other materials in the reactor challenges the performance of the reactors.12,13 To circumvent these problems for generating current efficiently in PMFC, we have adopted a three-step strategy: (i) induction of biofilm formation directly on the graphite anode with the help of biocompatible SF film, (ii) exploiting the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle to transfer appropriate photon energy to the photo systems of the cyanobacteria with the aid of a suitable quantum dot, and (iii) the incorporation of highly conductive graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) to provide an electroactive biofilm surface for facilitating the relay of cellular electrons to the electrode across the semiconducting SF film. To materialize these strategies, a novel nanocomposite matrix has been developed by incorporating cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots (QD) and GNP in the SF film, and this nanocomposite matrix was employed over the graphite electrode to develop the anode for the PMFC. Notably, QDs are semiconducting nanomaterials with remarkable properties such as light absorption in a wide spectral range, sharp and tunable emission and photo-stability.14 These nanocrystals have been increasingly used in biological labeling, solar cells, etc.15 A detailed account on the development of the QD-based nano-biocomposite matrix to implement the above mentioned strategies for improving the power generation in a PMFC has been reported here.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Mercaptocarboxylic acid coated CdTe QD (3.8 nm in size, 146000 g mol−1, 40% quantum yield and absorption maximum at λ644 nm and fluorescence maximum at λ680±5 nm) and GNP (3 nm in size) were procured from M K Impex Corp. (Canada) and Graphene Laboratories Inc. (New York), respectively. Isomolded graphite electrode (GE) (0.318 cm dia × 30.48 cm length) was purchased from GraphiteStore.com (USA). Nafion 117™ was procured from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Silk fibroin (SF) (375 kDa) was extracted from Bombyx mori cocoons with a yield of 5–7% (w/v) as described previously.11 The Synechococcus sp. BDU 140432 (Synechococcus sp.) strain was procured from National Facility for Marine Cyanobacteria at Bharathidasan University (India). The growth of Synechococcus sp. (15 W m−2 of white light in circadian cycle of 12 h light/12 h dark and 28 ± 2 °C) was maintained in artificial seawater (ASN III) medium (Table S1†). All solutions were prepared in ultrapure water with resistivity >18 MΩ. The experiments were performed at room temperature (RT) unless stated otherwise. The rest of the reagents were of analytical grade.
2.2 Cell density assay
The cell density assay for Synechococcus sp. was carried out following the procedure in our previous work.11 Here, the assay was mainly performed to understand the effect of SF doped QD on the bacterial cells. Briefly, SF (3% w/v in water) and QD (0.1% w/v in water) were mixed in different ratios. A total mixture of 20 µL of SF and QD was drop-cast on a 24-well plate (NEST, USA) and dried inside a laminar hood. Sterile ASN III media (1 mL) inoculated with 200 µL of active cells (OD750 = 0.29–0.32) was added to the SF/QD coated wells. After 72 h of incubation, the wells were rinsed with water and then submerged under 1.2 mL of 0.1% aqueous crystal violet solution (CVS) for 15 min. The plates were again rinsed thoroughly with water and then dried under a laminar hood for 5 h. Once dried, 1.2 mL of 30% acetic acid was added and incubated for 15 min to solubilize the CVS. The solubilized CVS (200 µL) was transferred to a new multiwell plate and the absorbance was recorded at OD590 in a microtiter plate reader (TECAN M200 Pro, Switzerland). The mean of three independent measurements was plotted, while the error bars represent the relative standard deviation.
2.3 Interaction study between SF and QD

2.3.1 Circular dichroism (CD) analyses. 
QD in a range of 0–4 µM prepared in freshly extracted SF solution (0.5 mg mL−1) was subjected to CD analysis in a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Japan). The spectra were recorded from λ240–190 nm in a 0.1 cm path length Suprasil quartz cuvette at 18 °C, at a scan rate of 100 nm min−1. The baseline corrected spectra were analyzed for secondary structures using DICHROWEB.16


2.3.2 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). 
The calorimetry experiments were performed in a Microcal ITC200 micro-calorimeter (G. E. Healthcare, UK) at 298 K. SF (60 µL, 170 µM) in a syringe was reverse titrated into 300 µL of QD solution (1 µM) in the sample cell holder with stirring speed fixed at 250 rpm. The first drop was set to 0.4 µL, followed by 16 subsequent 2.5 µL injections. To achieve complete equilibration, the spacing time of 120 s between each injection was set. A blank ITC experiment was performed to correct for heat of dilution. Analysis of the ITC data was performed by Origin v 7.0 (OriginLab, USA). The binding affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the binding process were obtained by fitting the integrated heats of isotherm binding to the one side binding model.

2.4 Determination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
The absorbance spectra of the acceptor, Synechococcus sp. (OD750 ∼ 0.3) was recorded in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100 Bio, Varian). Aqueous SF (3% w/v) and QD (0.1% w/v) were mixed in the ratio of 2.4:0.02 (wt/wt) to make a solution of SF decorated quantum dots (SF/QD). GNP (1 mg) was mixed with 1 mL of SF/QD solution to make SF doped with QD and GNP (SF/QD/GNP). The fluorescence spectra of the donors QD, SF/QD and SF/QD/GNP solutions were recorded by an LS-55 spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA), equipped with a quartz cuvette (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm) using 5 nm slit widths.
The fluorescence quantum yields (ΦD) of the various nanocomposite materials were calculated according to the following equation: (1)where, F is the integrated fluorescence intensity, η is the refractive index of the solvent (1.33 for water), and f is the absorption factor calculated from the measured absorption (A) at excitation of λ644 nm using f = 1 − 10−A. The subscript R refers to the standard fluorophore. Rhodamine 6G (in ethanol solvent, ηR = 1.36) of known quantum yield, ΦR = 0.9517 has been used here as the standard.
Förster radius (R0) is defined as the distance at which the efficiency of energy transfer is 50%. (2)R0 depends on the ΦD of the donor in the absence of acceptor, η, and the orientation factor between donor and acceptor molecules (κ2).18 For randomly oriented dipoles κ2 = 0.66.19J is the overlap integral between the fluorescence spectrum of the donor and the molar absorption spectrum of the acceptor: (3)where, FD is the peak-normalized fluorescence intensity of the donor and εA is the molar extinction coefficient of the acceptor. The εA for chlorophyll a (Chl-a) has been used as 70.02 × 10−3 M−1 cm−1.20
Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies of the nanocomposite with and without Synechococcus sp. were carried out on a picosecond time-resolved cum steady state luminescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK, Model FSP920) using an LED source, at an excitation wavelength of λ635 nm and emission wavelength of λ680 nm.
2.5 Preparation and characterization of nanocomposite films
The size of the QD was determined under a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Japan) operated at 150 kV. The presence of QD in the SF/QD matrix was also examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Zeiss LSM 880) with excitation at λ644 nm and a red emission filter (Fig. S1A and B†).
A total of 50 µL of SF, SF/QD and SF/QD/GNP solutions were drop casted on microscopic glass slides and allowed to dry under a laminar hood overnight. The dried films were then subjected to the following characterizations.
The UV-Visible absorption characteristics in the range λ200–800 nm were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2101/3101PC) with reference to air. The optical absorption coefficient (α) was calculated from the sample thickness (X) and optical absorbance (A), by using the following relation:21 (4)
The optical absorption coefficient for non-crystalline materials has the following frequency dependence: α(hν) = B(hν − Eg)r(5)where hν is the energy of the incident photons, Eg is the value of the optical energy band gap and r is an empirical exponent index that determines the type of optical transition. In the present case, r = 2, which means an allowed indirect transition. Extrapolation of the linear part of the curve (plotting (αhν)1/2 against (hν)) to intersect the x-axis at zero absorption gives the corresponding Eg values.
Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba Jobin Vyon, LabRam HR (Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (model TTRAX III, Japan) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
2.6 Construction and operation of photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC)

2.6.1 Construction of PMFC. 
A two-chambered PMFC was fabricated using light transparent Plexiglas glass material (Fig. 1). The anodic and cathodic chambers, each with an effective volume of 100 mL, were separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) (Nafion 117). The PEM was pretreated at 80 °C for 1 h in 3% H2O2, followed by sequential washing with distilled water and 0.5 M sulfuric acid to increase the porosity.22 The membrane was then fixed between gaskets with the help of clamps. Each chamber was provided with sample inlets and wire point inputs at the top, which were sealed later on to perform the operation. The cathode chamber was fed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing 80 mM of K3[Fe(CN)6] (ferricyanide) as the electron acceptor. This hexacyanoferrate is a suitable redox material for fundamental laboratory studies of fuel cells, owing to its facile reaction rate, low over potential and ease of handling.23 The anolyte contained ASN III media with 750 mg L−1 of acetate. The anode chamber was inoculated with Synechococcus sp. (OD750 ∼ 0.4) acclimatized in an anaerobic environment. The chamber was purged with argon gas to remove oxygen and stirred periodically to avoid diffusion limitation.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the two-chambered PMFC used in the present investigation. 
Two graphite electrodes (GEs) (3.7 cm × 0.32 cm) were positioned at a distance of 1 cm on either side of PEM, to serve as the anode and cathode. Prior to use, the electrodes were rinsed with acetone, methanol and water. Alligator copper clips (Mouser Electronics, USA) were used as contact with electrodes. A total of 100 µL for each SF, SF/QD and SF/QD/GNP solution were drop casted on the anode and dried under a laminar hood for 5 h to fabricate the modified graphite anodes SF/GE, SF/QD/GE and SF/QD/GNP/GE, respectively.


2.6.2 Operation of PMFC. 
The PMFC was operated in batch mode at RT with white light intensity of 15 W m−2 and in a 12 h:12 h light–dark cycle. A data acquisition system (Agilent 34972A LXI, USA) was used to continuously record the voltage outputs of the PMFCs. For generating the polarization curve, loading in a range of 1 × 106 to 1.6 Ω, with a stabilization of 20 min at each load, was employed. The current (I) and power (P) were calculated using Ohm's law (I = U/Rex, where U (V) is the voltage, I (A) is the current, and Rex (Ω) is the external load) and were normalized to the projected surface area of the anode (3.84 cm2). All the experiments were performed in triplicate and the average is reported.
The light energy conversion efficiency (LCE) was calculated by dividing the maximum measured electrical power output (Pcell) by incident solar irradiance (15 W cm−2).24
The fill factor (Ff) of the PMFC was calculated from (6)where, Voc is the open circuit potential (OCP) and Isc is the short circuit current obtained from the polarization curve.
From the slope of the polarization curve, the internal resistance and the activation overpotential were calculated.25 The electron transfer rate (Γ) was computed using the relation (7)where I is the measured current and e is the electron charge.26


2.6.3 Characterization of PMFC electrodes. 
2.6.3.1 Electrochemical characterizations of electrodes. 
All electrochemical measurements were performed in a potentiostat (Autolab, PGSTAT 302N, Netherland) using a three-electrode system with the anode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum as the counter electrode. The electrochemical interactions between the cells of Synechococcus sp. and electrodes, and the interfacial kinetics were probed by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
For non-turnover CV analysis of the bioanode, the culture broth from the anodic chamber of the PMFC was drained off and filled with fresh buffer (PBS, pH 7). The biofilm on the anode was then allowed to starve for two days in that same buffer to deplete any residual acetate from the bacterial cells. The acetate free bioanode was then subjected to CV analysis in a potential window of −1.0 V to +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Integration of the anodic peak area in the CV provides an estimate of the charge passed upon electrolysis of the redox species within the biofilm.27 This charge (Q in coulombs) was used to estimate the surface coverage of the redox species (Se, in mol cm−2) within the biofilm per geometric projected electrode area (A = 3.84 cm2) via Se = Q/nFA, where n is the number of electrons and F is Faraday's constant.
The electrochemical surface area of the GE and modified GEs were measured in an electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M KCl and 1 mM K3FeCN6. The Randles–Sevcik equation (which assumes mass transport occurs only by diffusion), Ip = 2.69 × 105 × Sa × D1/2 × n3/2 × γ1/2 × C,(8)was employed to measure the electrochemical surface area (Sa) using D, the diffusion coefficient of K3FeCN6 in solution (6.70 × 10−6 cm s−1), n, the number of electrons (n = 1), γ, the scan rate (100 mV s−1), C, the concentration of the probe in solution and Ip, the peak current response.28
The EIS measurements were performed in a background solution of 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 (1:1) and 0.1 M KCl in PBS. The frequency range was 106 to 0.1 Hz with a potential perturbation signal of 10 mV amplitude at open circuit potential. The Randles circuit was chosen to fit the impedance outputs.29
2.6.3.2 Characterization of electrodes by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). 
The morphological characterizations of the biofilm on anodes were performed using FESEM (Zeiss, Model Sigma) at 3 kV. The samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and then dehydrated by treating the samples with increasing alcohol concentration (40–100%). Gold coating on the sample was done prior to imaging.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Development of biofilm on nanocomposite casted anode
The Synechococcus sp. biofilm propagates rapidly on SF film. The reason has been ascribed to the interplay of electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction between the bacterial cells and SF film.11 This concept has been extended here to develop biofilm on GE for use as an anodic catalyst in a PMFC. However, to efficiently harvest the catalytic power of these photosynthetic microorganisms, the LCE of the bacterial photo systems in this complex biofilm conduit needs to be increased. Additionally, the flow of electrons from the cells in biofilm to the anode has to circumvent the barrier caused by the semiconducting SF film for generating current in the PMFC. We attempted to address these issues by incorporating QD and highly conductive GNP30 into the SF film to prepare the nanocomposite matrix. The QD alone, though inhibiting the bacterial growth, increased the biofilm cell density by ∼8% at an optimum SF:QD doping ratio of 2.4:0.02, compared to the SF (Fig. S2†). Notably, the SF film enhanced the cell density of Synechococcus sp. in the biofilm by 31 ± 1.6%, compared to the blank GE. The Cd2+ ions are known to be toxic to the cells14 and hence, would prevent the biofilm formation if released from the QD. The result suggests that the SF stabilized the QD from degrading to ions when mixed at the said ratio. There was however, no significant influence of GNP on the cell density with the above ratio (2.4:0.02) of SF/QD hybrid at its working dispersion loading of 10% in the SF film. The biofilm growth on SF/GE and SF/QD/GNP/GE are clearly visible in the FESEM images (Fig. 2Aa and b).

3.2 Interactions among the nanocomposite materials and bacterial cells
XRD analysis (Fig. S3A†) indicated that the intensity of the diffraction peak at 26.2°, which is ascribed to the (002) reflection of a hexagonal graphite structure and signature peak of pure graphite powder (GNP),31 was decreased by ∼60% in the hybrid nanocomposite. This is because the attachment of SF on the surface of GNP reduced stacking of the graphene sheets to some extent.32 The Raman spectra (Fig. S2B†) of the pristine graphite is dominated by the G band (1576 cm−1) and a D band (1324 cm−1), complying with a previous report.31 The G band is related to graphitic carbon and the D band is associated with the structural defects or partially disordered structures of graphitic domains.33 The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) reflects the structural defects and disorder.31 No shift in position of the D and G bands is observed in the composite matrix. The ID/IG ratio for GNP and SF/QD/GNP were 0.35 and 0.34 respectively, signifying marginal decrease in defects.34
The absorption spectrum of Synechococcus sp. revealed prominent peaks at λ440–460 nm and λ600–700 nm, corresponding to phycobilisome and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) (Fig. S4A†). Chl-a is associated with both PSI and PSII contributing to the light energy capture and photocurrent generation.5 The excitation of the QD at λ350 nm, λ550 nm and λ644 nm generates overlapping fluorescence spectra in the range of λ600–800 nm, which endorses the suitability of the QD for the present study, due to its broad spectral excitation range and matching fluorescence spectrum with the absorption spectrum of the bacterial photosystems (Fig. S4B and C†).
The fluorescence peak position of the QD did not significantly shift when it was doped in the SF/GNP composite (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence intensity of the SF/QD/GNP (donor) (at λex 550 nm) in the presence of Synechococcus sp. (acceptor) was reduced to a sizeable level (∼22%). The peak located at λ650–700 nm corresponds to the auto-fluorescence properties of photosynthetic pigments present in cyanobacteria.5,35 However, the intensity was not quenched in the presence of a non-photosynthetic microbe, E. coli, under similar conditions and cell concentrations (OD600 = 0.3), due to the absence of photosynthetic pigments. The normalized absorbance spectra of cyanobacteria (Fig. 2C) display a peak centered at λ625–650 nm, which is the characteristic absorbance caused by the cyanobacterial photosynthetic pigments.5 The quantum yields, integral overlap and Förster radius were calculated from the spectral overlap with Synechococcus sp. as the acceptor (Fig. 2C and Table 1) and it was observed that in the nanocomposite, even as the quantum yield of the QD was decreased by 45%, the Förster radius was also significantly decreased (∼12%) in SF/QD/GNP as donor. The band gap data were discerned from the band structure plot (Fig. 2D). The SF with the highest band gap of 4.09 eV and GNP with the lowest band gap of −3 eV were finally compromised to a band gap energy of 2.9 eV in the nanocomposite matrix, which is in the desirable range of 1–3 eV for electronic and photonic applications.15 Markedly, graphene can act as an excellent relay material for the generated electrons, due to its unique linear electronic dispersion capability. The decrease in the band gap of the SF hybrid nanocomposite indicates an interaction of the QD with crystalline graphene in the composite system.21 The reduced band gap could also be correlated with the redshift (∼4 nm) of the absorption spectra of the nanocomposite system after doping with GNP (Fig. S5†). These data have confirmed a rational interaction to yield the optoelectronic hybrid nanocomposite and the establishment of FRET between QD and Synechococcus sp. cells.

FRET is extremely sensitive to the separation distance between the donor and acceptor and their extent of spectral overlap. Nonradiative exciton transfer is expected to substantially truncate the exciton lifetime of the donor.19 The fluorescence intensity decay profile with time was measured for the interaction between the nanocomposite with the Synechococcus sp. cells. Shortening of the fluorescence lifetime of QD (as donor) was detected in the presence of Synechococcus sp. (as acceptor) (Fig. 3). These observations confirmed the successful FRET between the SF/QD/GNP nanocomposite and the cyanobacterial cells.

To understand the interaction between QD and SF, CD analysis of SF with and without doping with QD was performed. Freshly extracted native SF solution (0.5 mg mL−1) exhibited α-helix 11.8%, β-sheet 16.7%, β-turn 20.2% and random coil 51.3% which nearly conformed to a previous report.36 When QD with increasing concentration was doped on SF, the β-sheet content of SF was consistently increased up to 14.6% and α-helix and random coil were decreased by 12% and 3%, respectively (Fig. 4A). The results clearly indicate the reorientation of the secondary structure of the SF protein upon its interaction with the QD, shifting towards a hydrophobic β-sheet dominant architecture. From the ITC analysis (Fig. 4B), the binding constant, Ka (LM−1) and the number of binding sites, n, between QD and SF were determined to be 1.56 × 104 ± 4.46 × 102 and 0.93, respectively. The ITC analysis further provides the thermodynamic parameters, ΔH (cal mol−1) of −6.43 × 104 ± 416, ΔS (cal mol−1 K−1) of −190 and ΔG (cal mol−1) of −7680 on the interaction between QD and SF. The negative ΔG indicates that the interaction process is spontaneous.37 These parameters denote favorable interactions leading to a rational binding between these two entities with moderate binding affinity that helped in retaining the photoemission and stability of the QD.

3.3 Performance of the nanocomposite anode in PMFC setup
The SF/QD/GNP based nanocomposite on GE as anode with Synechococcus sp. as biocatalyst and ferricyanide based abiotic cathode were assembled in a dual chambered PMFC setup (Fig. 1). The PMFC was operated under photoheterotrophic conditions using circadian cycle of 12 h light:12 h dark at 25 °C, without using any electron transfer mediator. The OCP of the PMFC with different anodes was continuously measured, and its achieving a steady state was observed in all cases, except for GE, before reaching 90 h of operation. The OCP of the GE was low and fluctuating (0.05–0.2 V) within that period. A clear effect of inclusion of SF in the GE was visible on the OCP as the steady state potential was increased to ∼0.55 V. Furthermore, when QD was included in the SF/GE to make SF/QD/GE, the steady state potential marginally declined (∼16%) to 0.46 V. However, with the inclusion of GNP to make SF/QD/GNP/GE, the OCP substantially increased and reached a stable state of ∼0.66 V. This revealed the effect of highly conductive GNP on the enhancement of the bacterial metabolic charge on the electrode surface.
The OCP of the PMFCs with different anodes, namely, GE, SF/GE, SF/QD/GE and SF/QD/GNP/GE, were reduced by (%), ∼99, 50, 37, 32, respectively, following the steady state level at 92 h of operation when a load (1000 Ω) was connected to the PMFC. Interestingly, there was a stark difference in the captured potential pattern of the PMFC between the anodes with and without QD. In the absence of QD, the potential oscillated drastically with the varying light intensities as per the light–dark cycle (Fig. 5); the cyanobacteria showed positive photo-response. During the light-cycle, the electrons generated from the photosynthesis aid in up-surging the potential; whereas, in the dark-phase, the lack of photosynthesis as well as increasing catabolic processes succumb to metabolic electron loss with linked potential drop in the PMFC.35 With the anodes containing QD, a nearly steady state potential was generated till 280 h run time of the PMFC, due to surging of the cyanobacterial photosystems with appropriate light energy, even in low light conditions. Moreover, the SF/QD/GNP/GE anode delivered the highest potential, hence, this anode was utilized for further study on the PMFC.
 Fig. 5  Steady state OCP and potential discharge profiles (V vs. time) under a load (1000 Ω) for GE, SF/GE, SF/QD/GE and SF/QD/GNP/GE anodes in PMFC. At the onset in all the cases, an active bacterial cell density of OD750 ∼ 0.4 was used in the anodic chambers. 
The power curves for the PMFC were generated with SF/QD/GNP/GE as anode (Fig. 6C). Experiments with the control (bare GE) (Fig. 6A) and SF/GE (Fig. 6B) were run for comparison to understand the role of QD and GNP composites. The maximum current and power densities of the PMFC with SF/QD/GNP/GE were 1.89 A m−2 and 0.61 W m−2, respectively, which were correspondingly ∼5.7 and ∼50.8 times higher than the values (0.33 A m−2, 0.012 W m−2) obtained to the bare GE, and ∼1.7 and ∼2.8 times higher than the values (∼1.1 A m−2, 0.22 W m−2) obtained with the SF/GE. The positive impact of QD on the differently fabricated anodes was revealed from the fading of the current reversal post illumination cycle of PMFC operation with the load connected. The currents (A) in the light:dark phases for SF/GE (3.7 × 10−4:1.88 × 10−4), SF/QD/GE (3.26 × 10−4:2.95 × 10−4) and SF/QD/GNP/GE (4.83 × 10−4:4.43 × 10−4) are shown in the parentheses and the corresponding current differences were 1.82, 0.31, and 0.4.

The results clearly demonstrate the facilitating role of QD that helped to establish FRET with the photosystems of the bacteria enabling the underlying cells in the biofilm to harvest photons, even at low light conditions, in the dark phase to generate photocurrent. The electronically coupled GNP in the nanocomposite matrix facilitated the relay of the metabolic electrons to the electrode, owing to its exceptional high charge storage and electrical properties.30
There was a substantial improvement in potential output from the control experiment to the SF/QD/GNP/GE through SF/GE based runs in the PMFC, as evident from the polarization curves. The improvement was particularly visible in the section dealing with the activation and ohmic over potentials, which implied that the nanocomposite anode promotes harvesting charge as well as facilitates charge transfer both on the anode (for electrons) and through the electrolytes (for protons). The activation polarization is mostly influenced by the processes involving the adsorption of reactant species, desorption of product species, transfer of electrons across the double layer cell membrane, and the physical nature of the electrode surface.38 The fill factor (Ff) is a significant factor that characterizes the fuel cell performance (an ideal case pertains to Ff = 1). Superior performance of the nanocomposite anode was evident with higher Ff = 0.48, compared to SF/GE (0.31) and GE (0.24). Based on the energy of the input light and output power generation in the PMFC, the LCE (%) was calculated to be 0.08 ± 0.01, 1.46 ± 0.32 and 4.01 ± 0.68 for GE, SF/GE and SF/QD/GNP/GE anodes, respectively. A maximum LCE from solar energy to bioenergy and electric power attained previously were 3.79 ± 0.76% and 2–2.5% respectively.23
3.4 Characterization of anodes and electron transfer mechanism
Various parameters involved in the PMFC, pertaining to the anode electrochemistry and kinetics that influence the performance of a fuel cell were deduced. Initially, the charge transfer behaviors of the differently fabricated anodes were examined by CV analysis using FeCN6−3 as the redox indicator (Fig. S6†). A pair of quasi-reversible peaks for the Fe−2/Fe−3 system at 0.43 V and 0.010 V was detected. In SF/GE and QD/SF/GE, the redox peak current was decreased by ∼33% and ∼23%, respectively. The marginal gain of current response upon inclusion of QD in SF/GE may be due to the ionic coating material (mercaptocarboxylic acid) on QD that likely increased the charge on the electrode surface at the operating pH value. Addition of GNP to the QD/SF/GE drastically increased the current by ∼55%. The properties of graphene material, such as high electronic conductivity (7200 S m−1) and large specific surface area (up to 2600 m2 g−1) are expected to contribute to the current increase.23
EIS was performed to understand the internal resistance for which the Randles circuit was chosen to fit the impedance outputs. On the Nyquist plots (Fig. S7Aa–d†), the ohmic resistance/solution resistance (Rohm) is indicated by the high frequency intercept with the x-axis, and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is indicated by the diameter of the semicircle.39 The relevant equivalent circuit (inset Fig. S7B†) consists of a Rohm, connected in series with a parallel combination of an electrochemical Rct and a Warburg's diffusion element (W) with a double layer constant phase capacitance (Cdl). With SF coating, Rct increased and the electroactive surface area (Sa) decreased due to the insulating properties of the biopolymer (band gap 4.09 eV). Whereas, QD and GNP imparted a positive effect on decreasing Rct and increasing Sa (Table 2). As compared to the control (GE without biofilm), almost a nine fold decrease in Rct was observed in case of the GNP embedded hybrid nanostructure without biofilm. The formation of biofilm on SF/QD/GNP/GE is conspicuous from FESEM analysis (Fig. 2Ab). The extent of biofilm coverage on the anodic surface showed direct influence on the power improvement of the PMFC. A marginally higher Rct (with biofilm) for SF/QD/GE than SF/QD/GNP/GE may be attributed to the lack of GNP in the matrix. The imaginary impedance mainly originates from the Cdl, reflecting the changes at the electrode interface as well as the adsorption/adhesion process on the electrode surface.40 The GNP appended hybrid nanocomposite displayed the highest Cdl owing to its much more accessible surface area for charge storage.41 The solution resistance had a minor change, indicating that it was not intensely affected by the chemical transformations occurring on the electrode surface. The lowest Rct of the operated nanocomposite anode manifested the underlying electroactive nature of the biofilm formed.

The CV analyses (under non-turnover conditions) of the differently fabricated anodes withdrawn from the PMFC after 280 h of run time, revealed the presence of two redox species. The corresponding formal potentials of the redox couples [(Epa + Epc)/2] were −156 mV and +225 mV (Fig. 7Aa–d). These quasi-reversible peaks (>59/n mV) were absent in the pristine nanocomposite electrode (not run in PMFC) (Fig. S7C†). The potentials at ∼−156 mV coincides well with the free flavin, while +225 mV is closer to multi-heme cytochromes (cyt).42,43 Cyanobacterial strains contain 1–4 paralogs of cytochrome c6 (cytc6), which is a small heme protein that can act as an electron transfer agent and possesses lower midpoint potential (<300 mV) in Synechococcus sp.44,45 The surface coverage by the redox species present in the biofilms followed the order GE > SF/GE > SF/QD/GE > SF/QD/GNP/GE, which is consistent with the order of the electron transfer rate (considering both light and dark phases) by different biofilms. These differences are signposts for the amount of biomass associated on different biofilms.46

The inset arrows indicate the redox peaks. Harvested cells in PBS (pH 7), OD750 ∼ 0.2 from PMFC were subjected to (B) absorbance spectra and (C) fluorescence spectra under different conditions at λex 350 nm. 
The absorbance spectrum of the bacterial cells was examined to understand the presence of cyt (Fig. 7B). Under aerobic conditions, when the cyt is in the reduced state, the culture broth displayed the characteristic Soret peak at ∼λ415 nm. Nevertheless, under the anoxic state in the PMFC, when the cyt was in the oxidized condition, the intensity of the Soret peak was decreased with a shift to ∼λ409 nm.45 In the reduced state when the cyt were excited at λ350 nm, they fluoresced with maxima at λ402–437 nm (Fig. 7C). The fluorescence intensity was reduced by 1.6 fold when the culture from PMFC was transformed into the oxidized state.47 when the aerobic culture was treated with K3Fe(CN)6 (2 mM), an analogous drop in the fluorescence intensity was perceived (Fig. 7C). Overall, the above results suggest the presence of two electroactive compounds in the biofilm that could electronically come in contact with the hybrid nanocomposite anode. These compounds are tentatively, assigned as flavins and cyt. Flavins like luteolin, have been reported to increase the photon transfer and trapping capacity in the photosynthetic system in cyanobacteria.48 In the present case, the flavin like compound with low potential of ∼−156 mV can be safely attributed to the role for directly channelizing the biocatalytic electrons to the electrode that generates the current in the PMFC. However, further investigation is warranted to understand the exact chemical nature of these compounds.
4. Conclusion
A novel silk-based nanocomposite matrix endowed with biocompatible, optoelectronic and electroactive properties suitable for bioanode fabrication for a PMFC has been developed by rationally doping QD and GNP in the silk-fibroin. The nanocomposite matrix, when casted on graphite anode, promoted rapid biofilm growth of Synechococcus sp., supported FRET to surge the photosystems of the underneath bacteria in the biofilm and provided an electroactive surface for relaying metabolic electrons from the cells to the electrode through DET during operation of the PMFC. The cumulative action of these properties not only enhanced the power density, but also stabilized the power during the dark phase of the PMFC operation. Each of these functions of the nanocomposite matrix has been adequately evaluated in the light of their evolved properties in the hybrid state to validate the results. SF also interactively retained significant activity of the QD in its matrix, as evident from the remolded β-structure of the protein and residual fluorescence activity of the QD in the nanocomposite matrix. From the high integral spectral overlap and Förster radius, a significant FRET from the QD in the nanocomposite to the photosystems of Synechococcus sp. has been confirmed. The highly conductive properties of the GNP made it possible to transform the nanocomposite matrix into a highly electroactive surface (band gap of 2.9 eV), surpassing the semiconducting behavior (band gap of 4.09 eV) of the silk film, thus facilitating the direct flow of cellular electrons from the biofilm to the graphite electrode. A seamless transfer of biocatalytic electrons is demonstrated from the clear redox peaks obtained from the bioelectrode in a non-turnover study. The involvement of the DET mechanism in generating current in this PMFC is further validated by the fact that no electron transfer mediator was used to operate the system. We envision that our approach will be a big step forward, not only to improve the overall current density in a PMFC, but also to sustain its power at low light operating conditions, due to FRET guided surging of the photosystems of the cyanobacteria.
