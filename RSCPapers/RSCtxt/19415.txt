    , Accepted 16th August 2021First published on 18th August 2021AbstractIt is necessary for the commercialization of sunlight-driven H2 evolution to develop an efficient photocatalytic system whose energy utilization is independent of incident light intensity. Unfortunately, limited attention has been paid to the effect of light intensity on energy utilization. For all the above reasons, a photocatalytic system made up of eosin Y, ZnWO4 nanoplates and CuO nanoparticles was fabricated. Meanwhile, its photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution was evaluated under illumination with various light intensities. In light of the experimental results, we can conclude that the aforementioned system possesses dramatic photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution. Under strong illumination (100 mW cm−2), the highest H2 evolution rate is as high as 4.9 mmol g−1 h−1. Even if under weak illumination (10 mW cm−2), the H2 evolution rate is still 0.53 mmol g−1 h−1. More interesting, the energy utilization of this system is independent of light intensity. These results might provide some new ideas for the design and preparation of high-efficiency photocatalysts with light intensity-independent energy utilization.
Introduction
During recent decades, photocatalytic water-splitting has been a research hotspot as a promising technique to convert solar energy into environmentally friendly and storable chemical energy, i.e., hydrogen fuels. Numerous efficient and economical photocatalysts have been developed, such as CdS nanosheets,1 ZnIn2S4/Co-doped NH2-MIL-53(Fe) nanocomposites,2 a Ni2P modified two-dimensional SnNb2O6/CdS–diethylenetriamine system,3 Erythrosin B sensitized VB2,4 metal–organic framework-derived heterojunctions,5 nanolayered heterostructures of N-doped TiO2 and N-doped carbon,6 Ag-decorated TiO2 inverse opal structures,7 Ba–P co-doped g-C3N4 microtubes,8 Zn–AgIn5S8 quantum dot/NiS nanosheet nanocomposites,9 g-C3N4 co-modified with graphene and NiS,10 and so on. However, the effect of light intensity on the energy utilization of the photocatalysts was neglected in the previous studies. There are limited papers on photocatalysts whose energy utilization is independent of incident light intensity. It is well known that sunlight intensity is unstable. From the viewpoint of application, an efficient photocatalytic system with light intensity-independent energy utilization is very desirable. Therefore, it is meaningful to prepare an efficient photocatalyst and evaluate its photocatalytic performance for H2 generation under illumination with various light intensities.
Recently, some scientists found that, generally, the photocatalytic reaction has combined orders of 0.5 and 2 for incident photons.11,12 r ≈ kcr·P0.5 + kte·P2(1)where r is the rate of the photocatalytic reaction, kcr is the constant for trap-states-intermediated charge recombination, kte is the constant for thermionic emission, and P is the incident photons. Under weak irradiation, r is approximately proportional to the square root of P. In contrast, r is approximately proportional to the square of P under strong irradiation.11,12 Thus, the light energy utilization of photocatalysts would reach a minimum when the light intensity changes. To avoid this problem, the activation energy of interfacial electron transfer ought to be reduced. If the energy barriers are narrowed, the photocatalytic reaction would be quasi-first-order towards P. r ≈ k·P(2)where k is the constant for interfacial electron transfer. The light energy utilization of a photocatalyst would remain constant even if the light intensity changes. The theoretical prediction12 indicates that it is possible to fabricate a photocatalytic system whose energy utilization is independent of incident light intensity if we can introduce efficient tunneling in the photocatalytic system. However, it is a challenge because a high concentration of electronic doping is needed to achieve efficient tunneling in photocatalytic systems.
Dye sensitization has been regarded as an efficient method to broaden the light absorption of photocatalysts.13–17 The results reported preciously indicate that in a dye sensitized photocatalytic system, the sensitizer efficiently absorbs light and its electrons are excited under irradiation. Afterwards, these excited electrons can migrate to the conduction band of a semiconductor. Thus, the concentration of electron on the surface of the semiconductor will increase. Simultaneously, the Fermi energy level of the semiconductor would rise, which would lead to reduction of the potential barrier of interfacial electron transfer.18,19 Therefore, it can be speculated that efficient tunneling could be achieved in a dye sensitized photocatalytic system. On the other hand, dyes usually possess very high molar absorption coefficients. This will guarantee that the photocatalytic system can absorb enough light to bring forth photo-induced electrons even if under weak illumination. So, we can deduce that it is feasible to prepare a high-efficiency photocatalyst with light intensity-independent energy utilization via dye sensitization.
Due to excellent thermal/chemical stability, non-toxicity, high refractive index, high quantum yield and relatively low cost, ZnWO4 has been accepted as a candidate with great promise in the field of photocatalysis. ZnWO4-based photocatalysts were extensively explored for photocatalytic hydrogen production and removal of inorganic/organic contaminants.20–27 The experimental results confirm that the photocatalytic performance of ZnWO4 can be strikingly boosted through dye sensitization. On the other hand, Eosin Y (EY) has been widely used to broaden the light absorption range of photocatalytic systems as a sensitizer with all-round excellent properties. A lot of efficient photocatalysts have been developed utilizing the sensitization of EY, such as the photocatalytic system containing a g-C3N4/GO hybrid, EY and Pt–Ni cocatalyst,28 manganese incorporated EY/graphene nanocomposites,29 EY-sensitized Ni(II) complexes of pyridylbenzimidazole,30 EY-sensitized Co@boron nitride core–shell composites,31 carbon nitride/cobalt ion/eosin Y nanohybrids,32 EY-sensitized MoS2 nanomesh,33 EY-sensitized Ag@Ag–Pd alloy catalysts,34 a photocatalytic system containing EY, Ni2P/Ni nanoparticles and C/g-C3N4 hybrids,35 and EY-sensitized UiO-66-NH2.36 According to the above results, it is rational to speculate that the EY sensitized ZnWO4-based photocatalytic system might exhibit not only high photocatalytic activity but also light intensity-independent energy utilization. However, it is still unclear whether the EY sensitized ZnWO4-based photocatalyst is an efficient photocatalytic system whose energy utilization is independent on incident light intensity for H2 evolution or not. So, it is essential to prepare a photocatalytic system made up of EY and ZnWO4, and investigate the effect of light intensity on its photocatalytic performance for H2 generation.
Moreover, in order to restrain recombination of the electron–hole pair efficiently, a co-catalyst is often introduced into the photocatalytic system. Recent studies show that CuO is an efficient co-catalyst for various semiconductors, including TiO2,37 Bi2MoO6,38 ZnO,39 CuWO4,40 BiVO4,41 g-C3N4,42etc. Therefore, we can speculate that the photocatalytic performance of the EY sensitized ZnWO4-based photocatalyst should be distinctly boosted due to introduction of CuO. Based on the above considerations, we prepared a photocatalytic system made up of Eosin Y, ZnWO4 nanoplates and CuO nanoparticles (EY–ZnWO4/CuO). Then, its photocatalytic activity was evaluated for H2 generation under illumination with various light intensities. Finally, the photocatalytic mechanism was probed roughly.
Experimental
Preparation of ZnWO4 nanoplates
ZnWO4 nanoplates were prepared in a hydrothermal process (Scheme 1). Typically, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (10 mmol) was dissolved in redistilled water (15 mL). Next, 1 mmol of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was introduced into the aforementioned solution. Subsequently, the blend was stirred for 60 min to obtain solution A. Similarly, 10 mmol of NaWO4 was dissolved in deionized water (15 mL) under stirring to obtain solution B. After solution B was slowly mixed with solution A under stirring, the blend was transferred into a Teflon container (60 mL). Next, the container was enclosed with an autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 20 h. After the temperature of the autoclave dropped to room temperature, the precipitate was taken out with a centrifuge and then washed thoroughly with water. At last, the solid obtained was desiccated at 80 °C for 24 h.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the synthetic process of ZnWO4/CuO. 
Preparation of ZnWO4 nanoplates loaded with CuO nanoparticles (ZnWO4/CuO)
Firstly, the as-prepared ZnWO4 nanoplates (500 mg) were dispersed in deionized water (30 mL). Secondly, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (95 mg) was mixed with the aforementioned suspension. Then, the temperature of the blend rose to 75 °C. Thirdly, the pH value was adjusted to 10 using ammonium hydroxide at 75 °C. Afterwards, the temperature of the suspension was kept at 75 °C for 2 h under stirring. After the temperature of the suspension dropped to room temperature, the precipitate was taken out by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with water and isopropyl alcohol, and desiccated at 80 °C for 6 h. Finally, the solid was calcined at 200 °C for 1 h in an air atmosphere. In the present work, the products are denoted as ZnWO4/CuO (x%). Therein, x% is the content of CuO.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic activity tests were carried out in a top-irradiation quartz reactor with a circulating water jacket at 10 °C. A 500 W Hg lamp served as the light source and was placed 1 cm away from the reactor. A certain light density of incident light was set and calibrated with a Ceaulight CEL-NP2000 light intensity meter (China). In a typical experiment, ZnWO4/CuO (6%) (5 mg) was put in a reactor containing water (55 mL) under stirring. Then, EY (40 mg) was introduced into the reactor. After the blend was stirred for 1 h in the dark, triethanolamine (TEOA, 5 mL) was added into the above suspension. Before irradiation, N2 was injected into the reactor for 5 min. At last, the Hg lamp was turned on. The light density of incident light was adjusted and measured. After irradiating for some time, the hydrogen production was detected with gas chromatography (molecular sieve 5A, TCD, carrier gas N2). The H2 evolution rate (V) and the energy utilization factor (EUF) were calculated according to the following equations: V = the amount of hydrogen produced/(m × t)(3) EUF = the amount of hydrogen produced/(m × t × I × S)(4)where m is the mass of ZnWO4/CuO, t is the irradiation time, I is the light density of incident light and S is the irradiated area.
Using monochromatic light (450 nm, 57.1 mW cm−2) as a light source, the average hydrogen evolution rate was measured after irradiating for 4 h. Then, the quantum yield (QE) of EY–ZnWO4/CuO was calculated according to the equation below: (5)where v is the average hydrogen evolution rate (mol s−1), t is the irradiation time (s), NA is Avogadro's constant 6.022 × 1023 (mol−1), I is the light density of incident light (W cm−2), S is the irradiation area (cm2), λ is the wavelength of incident light (m), h is Planck's constant 6.626 × 10−34 (J s) and c is the speed of light 3 × 108 m s−1.
The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of EY–ZnWO4/CuO was calculated according to the equation below. STH = vΔGr/(IS) × 100%(6)where v is the average hydrogen evolution rate (mol s−1), ΔGr is the Gibbs energy for H2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) (286 kJ mol−1), I is the light density of incident light (W cm−2) and S is the irradiated sample area (cm2).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. A piece of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass coated with ZnWO4/CuO, Ag/AgCl electrode and platinum wire electrode acted as the working electrode, the reference electrode, and the counter electrode, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp served as the light source and was placed 7 cm away from the cell. The supporting electrolyte used was Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.2 mol L−1).
Results and discussion
Characterization of ZnWO4/CuO
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ZnWO4 nanoplates, the CuO nanoparticles and ZnWO4/CuO (6%) are shown in Fig. 1. From the XRD pattern of the ZnWO4 nanoplates, we can clearly observe several sharp XRD diffraction peaks, suggesting that the sample possesses high crystallization. These diffraction peaks are well indexed to monoclinic ZnWO4 with the standard card (JCPDS No. 89-0447).43 Three of the strongest peaks can be assigned to the (−111), (−202) and (021) planes of monoclinic ZnWO4, respectively. Moreover, no diffraction peaks ascribed to other impurities can be found. This result indicates that the as-prepared product is monoclinic ZnWO4. Similarly, the diffraction peaks of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) also match well with the standard pattern of monoclinic ZnWO4 (JCPDS No. 89-0447), and we can observe that the diffraction peaks of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) do not shift in comparison with those of the ZnWO4 nanoplates. These results indicate that ZnWO4/CuO (6%) contains monoclinic ZnWO4, and the crystalline structure of ZnWO4 is not changed. However, from the XRD pattern of ZnWO4/CuO (6%), none of the diffraction peaks assigned to CuO or other Cu species can be observed. Because the peak positions of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) do not shift with respect to the JCPDS card of monoclinic ZnWO4 (JCPDS No. 89-0447), the Cu atoms are not incorporated into the ZnWO4 lattice. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1, no broad peaks originating from an amorphous structure are present, which implies that the Cu species in ZnWO4/CuO (6%) are crystalline compounds. As a result, this phenomenon should be attributed to the following. The Cu species uniformly distribute on the surface of ZnWO4 in the form of small particles. Because these Cu species nanoparticles are very small, and the content of Cu species is low, we cannot observe any recognizable diffraction peaks.

The FT-IR spectrum of the ZnWO4 nanoplates (Fig. S1a, ESI†) exhibits two bands appearing at 881 cm−1 and 826 cm−1, arising from W–O asymmetric stretching.44 Moreover, it can also be found that four bands at 712 cm−1, 599 cm−1, 471 cm−1 and 426 cm−1 exist, respectively. Therein, the bands at 712 cm−1 and 599 cm−1 might arise from Zn–O–W symmetric stretching. The band at 471 cm−1 can be ascribed to the asymmetric deformation of W–O bonds. The band at 426 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric deformation of Zn–O bonds.44 Fig. S1b (ESI†) shows the FT-IR spectrum of the CuO nanoparticles. From Fig. S1b (ESI†), we can observe the bands around 602 cm−1, 508 cm−1 and 440 cm−1 which are related to the stretching vibration of Cu–O bonds.45 The FT-IR spectrum of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is shown as Fig. S1c (ESI†). From Fig. S1c (ESI†), we can see that six bands at 886 cm−1, 831 cm−1, 715 cm−1, 600 cm−1, 467 cm−1 and 427 cm−1 exist, respectively. Here, the bands at 886 cm−1 and 831 cm−1 ought to originate from W–O asymmetric stretching. The bands at 715 cm−1 and 600 cm−1 might arise from Zn–O–W symmetric stretching. The bands at 467 cm−1 and 427 cm−1 should arise from the asymmetric deformation of W–O bonds and Zn–O bonds. Unfortunately, we cannot find any bands from CuO. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the low content of Cu species. However, the IR bands of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) shift obviously in comparison with those of the ZnWO4 nanoplates, implying that some Cu species are loaded on the ZnWO4 nanoplates, and there exist some interactions between the ZnWO4 nanoplates and the Cu species.

Fig. 2A displays the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the ZnWO4 nanoplates. From Fig. 2A, the ZnWO4 nanoplates are clearly observed. These nanoplates adopt a quasi-rectangle morphology. Their lateral dimensions are approximately 40 nm × 30 nm. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the ZnWO4 nanoplates (Fig. 3A) also confirms the formation of nanoplates. Besides, we can also see from the TEM image of the ZnWO4 nanoplates that these nanoplates are quite thin. These results certify that ZnWO4 nanoplates have been obtained according to the above-mentioned procedure. Furthermore, the SEM image (Fig. 2B) and the TEM image (Fig. 3B) of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) show that the morphology of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is almost the same as that of ZnWO4 nanoplates, except that some small granular subunits appear on the surface of the ZnWO4 nanoplates. This suggests that Cu species are introduced on the surface of ZnWO4 in the form of small particles. Fig. 3C shows the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image of ZnWO4/CuO (6%). As can be seen from Fig. 3C, some nanoparticles can be resolved distinctly. The diameter of these nanoparticles is about 5 nm. Meanwhile, an interface can be clearly distinguished between the nanoparticles and the ZnWO4 matrix. Besides, Fig. 3C also shows that some lattice stripes are present. Therein, for the lattice stripes which appear on the nanoparticles, the distance between two adjacent planes is about 0.231 nm, which corresponds to the (200) plane of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS No. 48-1548).46 For the other lattice fringes, the interplanar spacing is about 0.203 nm, corresponding to the (112) plane of ZnWO4 (JCPDS No. 89-0447). On account of the results above, we can deduce that the final product obtained is ZnWO4 nanoplates loaded with CuO nanoparticles.

Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 (ESI†) show the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of ZnWO4/CuO (6%). As shown in the survey spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†), the characteristic XPS peaks assigned to Zn, W, Cu, O, and C can be found. Here, the signal of C might originate from the residues of the organic reagents used in the preparation process. This result confirms that the final product obtained is composed of Zn, W, Cu and O elements. Fig. 4A displays the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Zn 2P. As shown in Fig. 4A, two XPS peaks (1021.5 eV and 1044.6 eV) are present, which might be attributed to the Zn 2p3/2 peak and the Zn 2p1/2 peak of Zn2+ of ZnWO4.47 Moreover, we can find that these XPS peaks shift to higher binding energies in comparison with those of the ZnWO4 nanoplates (Fig. S3A, ESI†), suggesting that there exist some interactions between the ZnWO4 nanoplates and the CuO nanoparticles. Fig. 4B exhibits the high-resolution XPS spectrum of W 4f. As shown in Fig. 4B, two XPS peaks exist at 35.1 eV and 37.2 eV. They ought to be the W 4f7/2 peak and the W 4f5/2 peak of the W6+ oxidation state.48 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 4C) shows that a broad peak accompanied with a shoulder peak appears around 530 eV. This broad peak can be decomposed into two peaks which are at 530.1 eV and 531.1 eV. Here, the peak at 530.1 eV may be ascribed to the W–O bond in ZnWO4. The peak at 531.1 eV may originate from the Zn–O bond in ZnWO4.49Fig. 4D demonstrates the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu 2p. As shown in Fig. 4D, five peaks appear at 933.6 eV, 941.0 eV, 943.6 eV, 953.5 eV, and 961.8 eV, respectively. Therein, the peaks at 933.6 eV and 953.5 eV ought to be the Cu 2p3/2 peak and Cu 2p1/2 peak of CuO. The peaks at 941.0 eV, 943.6 eV, and 961.8 eV ought to be characteristic shakeup satellite peaks of CuO.50–52 Similarly, we can also observe that these XPS peaks shift to a higher binding energy in comparison with those of the CuO nanoparticles (Fig. S3C, ESI†). This phenomenon indicates again that there are some interactions between the ZnWO4 nanoplates and the CuO nanoparticles. Furthermore, we can observe from the elemental mappings of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) (Fig. S4, ESI†) that the distribution of Zn and W elements is uniform, and their distribution boundaries coincide with the edges of the ZnWO4 nanoplates shown in the energy-filtered TEM photograph (Fig. S4A, ESI†). Besides, the distribution of Cu is also homogeneous. These results imply that the CuO nanoparticles are homogeneously loaded on the surface of the ZnWO4 nanoplates. Combined with the XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM and XPS results, it can be concluded that ZnWO4 nanoplates loaded with CuO nanoparticles were successfully prepared according to the above-mentioned procedure. Furthermore, the distribution of CuO is homogeneous on the ZnWO4 nanoplates.

In a general way, efficient photocatalysts usually possess a large specific surface area. Hence, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) was evaluated based on its N2 gas adsorption isotherm. This result indicates that the specific surface area of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is large. Its specific surface area is up to 26.5 m2 g−1, implying that we can prepare an efficient photocatalyst using ZnWO4/CuO.
Optical properties
Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the UV-vis spectra of the ZnWO4 nanoplates, the CuO nanoparticles and ZnWO4/CuO (6%). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the ZnWO4 nanoplates exhibit an absorption edge at 375 nm and poor absorption in the visible-light region. This UV absorption edge corresponds to the trans-band light absorption of ZnWO4, and the band gap of the ZnWO4 nanoplates is about 3.30 eV, which coincides with that reported previously.20 This result indicates that the ZnWO4 nanoplates cannot efficiently absorb visible light. In contrast, ZnWO4/CuO (6%) possesses obviously enhanced light absorption in the visible light region besides a strong absorption band whose edge is around 375 nm. From Fig. S5 (ESI†), we can see that the CuO nanoparticles exhibit high absorbance in the range of 260–800 nm, suggesting that the CuO nanoparticles can efficiently absorb light in a wide region. Therefore, we can conclude that the strong visible absorption of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) should be ascribed to the introduction of CuO nanoparticles. This phenomenon may originate from the electron transfer between the CuO nanoparticles and the ZnWO4 nanoplates.53
Photocatalytic behavior of EY–ZnWO4/CuO under illumination with various light intensities

Fig. 5A exhibits the kinetic curves of H2 evolution in the presence of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%), the EY sensitized ZnWO4 nanoplates (EY–ZnWO4), ZnWO4/CuO (6%) or the ZnWO4 nanoplates. As shown in Fig. 5A, the photocatalytic activity of the ZnWO4 nanoplates is very weak. During 13 h irradiation, the mean H2 evolution rate is only 0.023 mmol g−1 h−1. This phenomenon might be attributed to fast recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs as well as feeble absorption in the visible region. In contrast, EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) exhibits a dramatic photocatalytic performance for H2 generation. During the first 4 h irradiation, the mean H2 evolution rate is as high as 4.9 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 196 times the H2 evolution rate over the ZnWO4 nanoplates (0.025 mmol g−1 h−1). Moreover, the H2 evolution rate basically remains unchanged during the first eight hours. Although the H2 evolution rate then begins to gradually slow down, it is still up to 1.5 mmol g−1 h−1 after 14 h irradiation. These results illustrate that the photocatalytic performance of ZnWO4 can be obviously boosted due to introduction of EY and CuO. EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) not only possesses dramatic photocatalytic activity, but can also maintain the high photocatalytic activity for a period. Besides, its quantum yield (QE) and solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency are about 0.003% and 0.015% at 450 nm, respectively. Compared with the photocatalysts reported previously, EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) also exhibits comparable activity (Table 1). Therefore, it can be concluded that EY–ZnWO4/CuO is an efficient photocatalytic system for H2 evolution.

Fig. 6 exhibits the effect of light intensity on the photocatalytic performance of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%). As shown in Fig. 6, the H2 evolution rate is obviously reduced as the light intensity is weakened. Even so, EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) still exhibits satisfactory photocatalytic performance (0.53 mmol g−1 h−1) under weak illumination (10 mW cm−2). Moreover, when the light intensity is weakened from 100 mW cm−2 to 10 mW cm−2, we find that EUF of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) (Table 2) remains basically unchanged, and a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.99) exists between the H2 evolution rate and the light intensity. These results indicate that the photocatalytic reaction should be quasi-first-order towards the incident photons.11,12 The photocatalytic activity of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) doesn’t rely on the incident light intensity. The decline in the H2 evolution rate ought to be attributed to the decreasing of the number of incident photons. In contrast, EUF of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) decreases obviously as the light intensity is weakened. We cannot observe any linear relationship between the H2 evolution rate and the light intensity. This phenomenon indicates that the light intensity-independent energy utilization of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) might originate from the sensitization of EY. Furthermore, from Fig. 6, it can be found that as the incident light intensity is periodically strengthened or weakened, the efficiency of hydrogen-production of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) increases or decreases, and the response speed is very fast. When the incident light intensity is strengthened, the rate of H2 evolution increases at once. Similarly, just weakening the incident light intensity causes the rate of H2 evolution to decrease at once. Moreover, as the light intensity cycles, the efficiency of hydrogen-production can be almost completely recovered if the incident light intensity returns to its initial state. Therefore, it can be concluded that EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is an efficient photocatalyst whose energy utilization is independent on light intensity, and has enormous potential of application in the field of sunlight driven H2 production.

Effect of CuO content
Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the effect of CuO content on H2 evolution. From Fig. S6 (ESI†), it can be observed that the H2 evolution rate gradually increases as the CuO content increases from 0.6 to 6%, and thereafter begins to decrease with increasing CuO content. The optimal content of CuO is 6%. We speculate that the CuO nanoparticles might serve as charge transferring sites and/or active sites in the photocatalytic process. When more CuO nanoparticles are loaded, the active sites would increase. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of EY–ZnWO4/CuO is enhanced. However, the efficient contact between the CuO nanoparticles and the ZnWO4 nanoplates may decrease as the content of CuO increases, which is unfavorable for the electron transfer between the CuO nanoparticles and the ZnWO4 nanoplates. As a result, when the content of CuO is more than 6%, the H2 evolution rate decreases.
Effect of pH on H2 evolution
Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the effect of the pH of the TEOA solution on H2 evolution. From Fig. S7 (ESI†), we can observe that the amount of hydrogen produced increases when the pH value increases from 7 to 10.6. Afterwards, the amount of hydrogen produced decreases as pH increases. When the pH is 10.6, the rate of H2 evolution is the fastest. One possible explanation is that the protonation of TEOA would be enhanced with decreasing pH. The electrons of the protonated TEOA molecules cannot migrate to the excited state of EY so that the oxidized EY molecules cannot be restored in time.20 On the other hand, the thermodynamic driving force for H2 evolution would be weakened with increasing pH. As a result, the rate of H2 evolution increases when the pH value increases from 7 to 10.6. Subsequently, the amount of hydrogen produced would decrease if the pH value further increases.
Role of CuO nanoparticles
At first, it can be discovered from Fig. 5 that the photocatalytic performance of the ZnWO4 nanoplates is significantly boosted when CuO nanoparticles are loaded on the ZnWO4 nanoplates. The H2 evolution rate over ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is 0.13 mmol g−1 h−1, which is 5.2 times the H2 evolution rate over the ZnWO4 nanoplates. Similarly, EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) can exhibit higher photocatalytic activity compared with EY–ZnWO4. One possible explanation is that the recombination of a photo-induced electron–hole pair would be efficiently stifled due to the presence of CuO. Secondly, we investigate the photocatalytic performance of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) under UV light (200–400 nm), visible-infrared light (400–2500 nm) and UV-visible-infrared light (200–2500 nm), respectively. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic performances of the ZnWO4 nanoplates, ZnWO4/CuO (6%) and EY–ZnWO4 were also evaluated. The experimental data are listed in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the ZnWO4 nanoplates and ZnWO4/CuO (6%) do not show any photocatalytic activity for H2 generation under visible-infrared light. Under UV irradiation, the photocatalytic performance of the ZnWO4 nanoplates is obviously boosted due to the presence of CuO. This phenomenon indicates that CuO cannot sensitize ZnWO4 although the adsorption of the ZnWO4 nanoplates can be enhanced in the visible region due to the presence of CuO nanoparticles (see the UV-vis spectra of the ZnWO4 nanoplates and ZnWO4/CuO (6%) shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). The boosting of the photocatalytic performance of the ZnWO4 nanoplates should be ascribed to high-efficiency separation of electron–hole pairs. Thirdly, the fluorescence spectra of ZnWO4 nanoplates and ZnWO4/CuO (6%) were measured (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7, the fluorescence of ZnWO4 is significantly quenched when CuO nanoparticles are present on the ZnWO4 nanoplates. The phenomenon above ultimately confirms that electron–hole pair recombination would be efficiently suppressed due to the introduction of CuO. Futhermore, Fig. 8A demonstrates the transient photocurrent–time curves on the electrodes modified with the ZnWO4 nanoplates and the electrodes modified with ZnWO4/CuO (6%) in the presence or absence of EY. As shown in Fig. 8A, the photocurrent on the ZnWO4/CuO (6%) modified electrode is stronger than that on the electrode modified with ZnWO4 nanoplates whether EY is present or not. Once again, this result confirms that the electron–hole pair separation would be obviously enhanced when the CuO nanoparticles are present on the ZnWO4 nanoplates. Therefore, we can speculate that the CuO nanoparticles serve as charge transferring sites and reactive sites in EY–ZnWO4/CuO.

Role of EY
As shown in Fig. 5B, the photocatalytic performance of the ZnWO4 nanoplates can also be obviously enhanced if EY is present. When EY is used, the H2 evolution rate would be increased from 0.025 mmol g−1 h−1 to 1.23 mmol g−1 h−1. This result indicates that EY is an efficient sensitizer for ZnWO4. The enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of ZnWO4 ought to be attributed to extension and reinforcement of the light absorption of ZnWO4. Meanwhile, we can observe from Table 3 that both EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) and EY–ZnWO4 possess high photocatalytic activity under visible-infrared irradiation. This further confirms that EY is an efficient sensitizer for ZnWO4. More interesting, both EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) and EY–ZnWO4 also exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity under UV light in comparison with ZnWO4/CuO (6%) and the ZnWO4 nanoplates. One possible explanation is that EY can efficiently absorb UV light as well as visible light (Fig. S5, ESI†). Hence, both the ZnWO4 nanoplates and ZnWO4/CuO (6%) can be sensitized by EY in the UV region. In light of the experimental results above, we can deduce that the dramatic photocatalytic activity of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) should be mainly attributed to the sensitization of EY.
Furthermore, it can be observed from Fig. 8A, when EY is present, that both the ZnWO4 nanoplate coated electrode and the ZnWO4/CuO (6%) coated electrode exhibit much stronger photocurrents in comparison with those in the absence of EY. And, in the presence of EY, we can find the strongest photocurrent on the ZnWO4/CuO (6%) modified electrode. These phenomena indicate that the concentration of electrons on the surface of the ZnWO4 nanoplates would obviously increase due to the sensitization of EY, implying that efficient tunneling would be realized in EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%). Fig. 8B shows the current–voltage curves on the ZnWO4/CuO (6%) coated electrodes under irradiation when EY is absent or present. From Fig. 8B, we can find that when EY is present, the onset potential obviously shifts to a less negative potential by ∼220 mV under forward bias, which indicates that the activation energy for the electron transfer between ZnWO4 and CuO would be reduced due to the sensitization of EY.12 One possible explanation is that when the ZnWO4 nanoplates are sensitized by EY, the concentration of electrons on the surface of the ZnWO4 nanoplates would increase so that efficient tunneling can be realized in ZnWO4/CuO (6%). As a result, the activation energy for the electron transfer between ZnWO4 and CuO decreases.12 This may be the reason why EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is an efficient photocatalyst whose energy utilization is independent of light intensity. Therefore, we speculate that EY acts as a light harvester to enhance the light absorption of ZnWO4 in EY–ZnWO4/CuO, and the light intensity-independent energy utilization of EY–ZnWO4/CuO should be ascribed to the efficient sensitization of EY.
Discussion on reactive oxidative species

Fig. 9 shows the photocatalytic behavior of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) when scavengers for reactive oxidative species are present. As shown in Fig. 9, when isopropanol (scavenger for ˙OH), ammonium oxalate (scavenger for the hole) and benzoquinone (scavenger for ˙O2−) are added in the photocatalytic system separately, the H2 evolution rate becomes noticeably slower. Benzoquinone exhibits the strongest inhibitory effect of the three. In contrast, L-tryptophan (scavenger for 1O2) can hardly exhibit an inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic H2 evolution. These phenomena suggest that there exist holes, ˙OH radicals and ˙O2− radicals in the photocatalytic process. Among the reactive oxidative species above, ˙O2− radicals play a decisive role in the photocatalytic process and the photogenerated holes and ˙OH radicals play non-negligible roles. However, prior to irradiation, O2 was completely removed from the reactor. Therefore, the ˙O2− radicals should originate from the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. One possible explanation is that the photogenerated holes are not effectively trapped by TEOA, which leads to O2 production on the ZnWO4 nanoplates.

Photocatalytic mechanism of EY–ZnWO4/CuO
In light of the above-mentioned results, we speculate that the photocatalytic mechanism of EY–ZnWO4/CuO might be as follows (Scheme 2). Firstly, as EY–ZnWO4/CuO is irradiated, the electrons of EY molecules jump from the occupied molecular orbitals to the unoccupied molecular orbitals. Meanwhile, the ZnWO4 nanoplates absorb UV light. Afterwards, the electrons on the valence band (VB) of ZnWO4 jump to its conduction band (CB). Secondly, the electrons of the excited EY molecules are injected into the CB of ZnWO4. Thirdly, these photogenerated electrons migrate from the CB of ZnWO4 to the CB of CuO because the position of CuO CB is more positive in comparison with that of ZnWO4 (CuO is 0.1 V vs. NHE53 and ZnWO4 is −0.41 V vs. NHE58). As electrons accumulate in the CB of CuO, the Fermi level of CuO would shift to a negative potential.59 Finally, on the CuO nanoparticles, water molecules are reduced to H2 by the photogenerated electrons. On the other hand, oxidized EY molecules are regenerated by sacrificial reagent TEOA. Some holes are consumed by OH− or the adsorbed water molecules to produce ˙OH radicals or O2 on the ZnWO4 nanoplates. The O2 molecules would immediately react with the photogenerated electrons to form ˙O2− radicals. Subsequently, the other holes, ˙OH radicals and ˙O2− radicals irreversibly react with TEOA on the ZnWO4 nanoplates. In this photocatalytic system, the CuO nanoparticles act as charge transferring sites and/or active sites. EY acts as a light harvester to extend and reinforce the light absorption of ZnWO4. The remarkable photocatalytic performance of EY–ZnWO4/CuO ought to be attributed to the extension and reinforcement of the light absorption of ZnWO4 as well as efficient separation of the electron-hole pair. Besides, due to efficient sensitization of EY, the electron concentration on the surface of the ZnWO4 nanoplates would increase so that efficient tunneling can be achieved in ZnWO4/CuO. Thus, the energy barrier of the electron transfer between ZnWO4 and CuO would be narrowed, resulting in EY–ZnWO4/CuO exhibiting light intensity-independent energy utilization.

Regenerability of EY–ZnWO4/CuO
The experimental results exhibit that the photocatalytic activity of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) would be gradually weakened until complete deactivation with prolonged irradiation time. On the other hand, the XRD pattern and the Cu 2p high-resolution XPS spectrum of the used ZnWO4/CuO (6%) (Fig. S8, ESI†) are almost identical to those of the fresh ZnWO4/CuO (6%). In contrast, the UV-vis spectra of the EY solution (Fig. S9, ESI†) show that the absorption of EY would be weakened after irradiation in the presence of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) and TEOA. These phenomena indicate that ZnWO4/CuO (6%) possesses high chemical stability as well as satisfactory mechanical stability. The deactivation of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) ought to be ascribed to the photodegradation of EY. Therefore, it can be inferred that the photocatalytic activity of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) would be restored if degraded EY is replaced by fresh EY. i.e., EY–ZnWO4/CuO may possesses remarkable regenerability. In order to verify our assumption, the regenerability of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) was examined (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10, the regenerability of EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is very satisfactory. In the case of the first regeneration, the photocatalytic activity of regenerated EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is almost same as that of the fresh EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%). Even though EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is regenerated four times, the regenerated EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) retains about 80 percent of the photocatalytic activity of fresh EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%). These results confirm that EY–ZnWO4/CuO (6%) is a reproducible, efficient photocatalyst for H2 evolution. The attenuation in photocatalytic activity might be attributed to wastage of ZnWO4/CuO (6%) during the regeneration and washing process.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully fabricated a photocatalytic system containing EY, ZnWO4 nanoplates and CuO nanoparticles. This photocatalytic system is an efficient photocatalyst with light intensity-independent energy utilization for H2 evolution. Even under weak illumination its photocatalytic activity is still satisfactory. In addition, this photocatalytic system possesses remarkable regenerability. Here, the remarkable photocatalytic performance of EY–ZnWO4/CuO ought to be attributed to two causes as follows. One is extension and reinforcement of the light absorption of ZnWO4 ascribed to the efficient sensitization of EY. Another is high-efficiency separation of the electron-hole pair due to the introduction of CuO nanoparticles. Besides, the light intensity-independent energy utilization of EY–ZnWO4/CuO should also be ascribed to the efficient sensitization of EY. Furthermore, it can be deduced that dye sensitization would be an effective strategy to develop a high-efficiency photocatalytic system with light intensity-independent energy utilization. This provides a new course for preparation of commercial photocatalysts which can be applied on a large scale in the field of sunlight-driven H2 production.
