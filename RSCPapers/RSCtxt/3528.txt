    First published on 20th February 2017AbstractA wide variety of metal borohydrides, MBH4, have been discovered and characterized during the past decade, revealing an extremely rich chemistry including fascinating structural flexibility and a wide range of compositions and physical properties. Metal borohydrides receive increasing interest within the energy storage field due to their extremely high hydrogen density and possible uses in batteries as solid state ion conductors. Recently, new types of physical properties have been explored in lanthanide-bearing borohydrides related to solid state phosphors and magnetic refrigeration. Two major classes of metal borohydride derivatives have also been discovered: anion-substituted compounds where the complex borohydride anion, BH4−, is replaced by another anion, i.e. a halide or amide ion; and metal borohydrides modified with neutral molecules, such as NH3, NH3BH3, N2H4, etc. Here, we review new synthetic strategies along with structural, physical and chemical properties for metal borohydrides, revealing a number of new trends correlating composition, structure, bonding and thermal properties. These new trends provide general knowledge and may contribute to the design and discovery of new metal borohydrides with tailored properties towards the rational design of novel functional materials. This review also demonstrates that there is still room for discovering new combinations of light elements including boron and hydrogen, leading to complex hydrides with extreme flexibility in composition, structure and properties.

1. Introduction
A wide variety of metal borohydrides have been discovered and characterized during the past few years, revealing an extremely rich chemistry, including fascinating structural flexibility and a wide variety of physical properties to be explored for possible future applications.1–7 Hydrogen and boron form a variety of molecular compounds, boranes (BnHm), which were intensely researched in the 1950's as high energy rocket fuels. Since then, boranes have received significant academic interest, but metal borohydrides appear to have a larger potential for a variety of future applications due to their lower toxicity, lower volatility, and high hydrogen content. Thus, the focus of this review is on the compounds where boron and hydrogen form a negatively charged BH4− anion, counterbalanced by metal cations. The boron–hydrogen bond in the complex anion, e.g. BH4−, is covalent, whereas the coordination to metals in the solid state is more diverse, ranging from ionic to more covalent with well-defined directionality.8 Two major classes of metal borohydride derivatives have recently been discovered. The first class includes mixed-anion compounds, where the complex anion BH4− is substituted by a halide anion or combined with a less similar anion such as an amide or borate.9–11 The second class includes metal borohydrides coordinated to neutral H-rich molecules, such as NH3, NH3BH3, N2H4, etc.6 This review focuses on new trends correlating composition, structure and properties of series of compounds, aiming to provide general knowledge, which contributes to the rational design and discovery of new metal borohydrides and derivatives with tailored properties.
The first homoleptic metal borohydrides Al(BH4)3, Be(BH4)2 and LiBH4 were discovered by Schlesinger, Brown and Burg and reported in 1940.12–14 Schlesinger and Brown discovered uranium borohydride, U(BH4)4, while working on the Manhattan project during World War II after being assigned with the task of finding volatile uranium compounds for use in the diffusion separation of uranium isotopes.15 U(BH4)4 was found to be one of the most volatile uranium compounds known, second only to uranium hexafluoride. Another compound of great importance, NaBH4, was prepared for the first time by Brown and co-workers, during their research for the US Department of Defense, however, their work remained “classified” until 1953.16 The first application of a metal borohydride as a ‘hydrogen carrier’ dates back to World War II, when the hydrolysis of a NaBH4 suspension was used for solid state storage of hydrogen for weather balloons. Later, in 1979, Herbert C. Brown was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his development of boron containing compounds as reducing reagents in organic synthesis, which today still remains the most important use of metal borohydrides. Over the decades many synthesis methods and new compounds have been reported, as borohydrides have constantly remained of interest in organic chemistry.17 Sodium borohydride was the first member to be structurally investigated in 1947, followed by K, Rb and Cs borohydrides in 1954.18,19 Titanium borohydride, Ti(BH4)3, the first genuine transition metal borohydride, was characterized in the gas phase by Dain et al. in 1991,20 while the first full structural characterization of a transition metal borohydride in the solid state, Mn(BH4)2, was presented in 2009.21
During the past decade, metal borohydrides have received significant interest as hydrogen storage materials initiated by investigations of LiBH4.22–26 Renewable energy sources have been highly sought after due to the ever increasing human energy consumption and made urgent by an increasing awareness of possible climatic changes and healthcare problems associated with the combustion of extreme amounts of fossil fuels.27,28 Unfortunately, renewable energy is unevenly distributed both over time and geographically, therefore it must be stored in an efficient way.29 Renewable electricity may be stored directly in lithium based batteries or converted to hydrogen by electrolysis.30,31 Hydrogen has the highest gravimetric energy content for any known compound, but is a gas at ambient conditions and is therefore difficult to store in an efficient and compact way. This is a fundamental problem associated with the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier,32 which may be solved by the design of novel light weight metal hydrides, such as metal borohydrides.32–35 Research over the past decade has revealed a range of new light metal borohydrides possessing extremely high hydrogen densities, which may be considered for possible energy storage applications. However, in general, these compounds suffer from poor thermodynamic and kinetic properties, i.e. they are often too thermally stable and the hydrogen release and uptake reactions are too slow for practical applications.5,6,36
A new approach is to allow multiple hydrides, denoted as reactive hydride composites (RHC), to react during the release of hydrogen to form a different dehydrogenated state. These composites change the hydrogen release pathway and may improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties, enabling hydrogen release and uptake under more favourable conditions.37–42 The concept aims to lower the overall reaction enthalpy by introducing extra (endothermic) chemical reaction(s), i.e. by utilizing the well-known Hess law from chemistry, also denoted as Medima principles.43,44
Composites of two or more metal borohydrides often induce co-melting or eutectic melting.45 Low temperature melting may reduce the hydrogen release temperature, as observed for xLiBH4–(1 − x)Mg(BH4)2, or for preparation of molten metal borohydrides systems for convenient nanoconfinement, e.g. in the 0.725LiBH4–0.275KBH4 with Tm = 105 °C.46–48 Metal borohydrides with low melting points could allow for fast and convenient re-fuelling of vehicles with similar technology to that known today for liquid fossil fuels.
Metal borohydrides are a multifunctional class of materials that may also be used as fast ion conductors for new types of batteries or for gas adsorption.3,49 They may also have optical, electronic and magnetic properties and can be used as reducing agents in organic synthetic chemistry.1,2,17,50 For this reason, mono-, bi- and trimetallic borohydrides have been exposed to intense research efforts to develop new synthesis strategies, perform structural characterization, and investigate physical and chemical properties. In the following, we critically review the progress of metal borohydrides and their derivatives, which may form the basis of future technological applications. The focus of this review is to discover new trends in synthesis, structure and properties and provide perspectives for further research that may act as inspiration for the development of novel materials towards rational materials design.
2. Synthesis of metal borohydrides and derivatives
A number of different synthetic approaches have been developed to prepare new types of metal borohydrides, including anion substitution and the preparation of derivatives including neutral molecules, such as ammonia, hydrazine etc. A range of different chemical reactions can be undertaken in different media; and of those, metathesis, i.e. double substitution reactions, and addition reactions are the most common. In some cases, more complex or competing reactions are observed. Halide- and solvent-free mono-metallic borohydrides can be obtained using solvent based methods,51 mechanochemical methods successfully provide numerous bi- and tri-metallic borohydrides,52 whereas solid–gas reactions are important for the preparation of ammine metal borohydrides.53,54 Typically, air and moisture sensitive reagents are utilized, which need to be manipulated in a glove box or using standard vacuum and Schlenk techniques in dry and inert atmosphere. In general, metal borohydrides, anhydrous metal halides and many solvents are hygroscopic and readily adsorb water. The hydrates of metal borohydrides containing metals with low electronegativity are often stable at RT but react with water at elevated temperatures and evolve hydrogen. Metal borohydrides of metals with higher electronegativity may adsorb water and react exothermically at RT, releasing hydrogen. Alkali metal borohydrides are stable in basic aqueous solution and closo-boranes are stable in neutral and acidic solutions. This section reveals general trends in chemical reactions for the synthesis of different metal borohydrides and their derivatives under different physical conditions. Hydrogen release and uptake reactions in metal borohydrides and synthesis of some of those from the elements are discussed in Section 6.
2.1 Solvent-based synthesis of monometallic borohydrides
The first successful solvent-based synthesis of a metal borohydride was accomplished by Wiberg and Bauer in 1950 by a reaction between diethylmagnesium, Mg(CH2CH3)2, and diborane, B2H6, in ether.55 Since diborane is challenging to handle, i.e. poisonous, self-igniting and explodes in contact with air or moisture, a borane complex such as triethylamine borane, (C2H5)3NBH3 or dimethylsulfide borane, (CH3)2SBH3, is safer and easier to handle. Solvent mediated addition reactions take place between a borane donor and a metal hydride or a metal alkyl compound. The obtained product is commonly a solvate that needs further treatment in order to produce a solvent-free product.56,57 This approach has provided the first open-structured metal borohydrides, γ-M(BH4)2, M = Mg or Mn.3,58 Ca(BH4)2 can be synthesized in a similar manner from triethylamine borane and CaH2.59 Thus, the electron deficient molecule BH3 can be considered a Lewis acid, which reacts with the Lewis base H−. Therefore, the reaction is only possible if an ionic or polar covalent metal hydride can be utilised as a reactant.
Metal borohydrides are also often synthesized via a quantitative metathesis reaction, illustrated by the preparation of Al(BH4)3 from aluminum trichloride and lithium borohydride in an organic solvent (e.g. toluene).60 3LiBH4(s) + AlCl3(s) → Al(BH4)3(l) + 3LiCl(s)(2.1)
Metal borohydrides and halides often have different solubilities in solvents, allowing for salt-free products to be obtained in high yield. A weakly coordinating solvent that only dissolves the metal borohydride allows for the removal of the metal halide by solvent extraction. The reaction kinetics and yield can be improved by using finely ground reactants with large surface area.
A limitation of solvent-based methods is that the thermodynamically most stable compound is obtained, which is often a monometallic borohydride, typically obtained as a polymorphic pure product. Therefore, reaction mixtures containing two or more metals tend to form mixtures of two or more monometallic borohydrides rather than the bi- or trimetallic borohydrides, which are obtainable through mechanochemical synthesis. Thus, very few bimetallic solvates have been discovered, e.g. in diethyl ether, Et2O, LiMn(BH4)3·1/2(Et2O) and NaMn(BH4)3·1/2(Et2O).61 Recently, a new method was developed for the production of bimetallic metal borohydrides using bulky organic cations and weakly coordinating anions.62,63 The metathesis reaction is carried out in organic solvents, CH2Cl2, CHCl3 or toluene, and utilizes precursors such as [Cat][Zn(BH4)3] or [Cat][Y(BH4)4], where [Cat] symbolizes a bulky cation, e.g. [Ph4P]+ or [nBu4N]+. The method is also useful for producing less stable bimetallic borohydrides, i.e. LiY(BH4)4, NaY(BH4)4 or LiZn2(BH4)5.62,63
The use of dimethyl sulphide, S(CH3)2, as a co-solvent and extraction solvent has several advantages: (i) the reaction is allowed to proceed faster as the products are being dissolved in S(CH3)2 as they form, (ii) weak solvent coordination allows for solvent removal at moderate conditions, (iii) the product dissolved in the solvent can readily be separated from the byproducts (i.e. LiCl) by filtration. In this manner, the formation of ternary chlorides is avoided, e.g. Li- or NaMn-chlorides, or bimetallic borohydrides, previously reported to form mechanochemically from MnCl2 and LiBH4 or NaBH4.64,65
Recently, yttrium and gadolinium borohydrides were prepared using dimethyl sulfide as a solvent, providing new solvates as intermediates, M(BH4)3·S(CH3)2 (M = Y, La, Ce or Gd), which transform to α-Y(BH4)3 or Gd(BH4)3 at T ∼ 140 °C.66,67 Other halide-free rare-earth metal borohydrides, Eu(BH4)2 and Sm(BH4)2, are prepared by a metathesis reaction of trivalent metal chlorides and LiBH4 in ether, combined with solvent extraction using dimethyl sulfide to remove the halide salts.68 Donor atoms in solvents typically have increasing strength of coordination in the series S < N < O and are increasing difficult to remove from the metal borohydride products.
2.2 Trends in the mechanochemical synthesis of metal borohydrides
Mechanochemistry is an alternative synthesis approach to bring chemicals together on the atomic scale. Investigations indicate that the induced pressure and reactant composition are of major importance in determining the obtained reaction product.52 High-energy ball milling induces high pressure and mechanical stress between the reacting materials, which can facilitate chemical reactions, in contrast to traditional solid-state synthesis techniques, which are mainly ‘temperature-driven’, i.e. increasing cation diffusion in the solid state with increasing temperature.69 Previously, ball milling was mainly aimed at the preparation of alloys and solid solutions of metals, i.e. products with statistical distribution of atoms, but now also encompasses the synthesis of ionic, ionic/covalent materials and also organic materials, i.e. crystalline materials with ordered distribution of atoms. In some cases, materials can be obtained by mechanochemistry, which apparently cannot be obtained by other means.52
High energy mechanochemistry can be very fruitful in the preparation of metal borohydrides where the ball trajectories approach the center of the milling vial, which contrasts grinding mode where the balls follow the circumference of the vial. This treatment maximizes the ‘intrinsic pressure’ at grain boundaries and limits frictional heating of the sample. Sample heating may be further reduced using pauses during the mechanochemical treatment.70 Continuous prolonged ball milling may lead to decomposition of the sample, but may also produce new materials, e.g. anion-substituted Na(BH4)1−xClx, or nano-sized vanadium boride.71–73 Mechanochemical synthesis can be performed under a variety of different conditions, e.g. at cryogenic conditions, in a solvent, or in different gases at elevated pressures (the latter is often denoted reactive ball-milling when the gas takes part in the reaction).74–77 Hence, mechanochemistry is a versatile technique, which can be used for the preparation of a wide range of materials.52
New bi- and trimetallic borohydrides can often be prepared by mechanochemical methods. In cases where pure monometallic borohydrides are available as precursors (e.g. prepared by solvent-based methods) addition reactions may be utilized as exemplified by the synthesis of Cs2LiY(BH4)6.78 A major advantage is that a pure product may be obtained. 2CsBH4(s) + LiBH4(s) + Y(BH4)3(s) → Cs2LiY(BH4)6(s)(2.2)
Monometallic borohydrides may be prepared via metathesis reactions, i.e. double substitution, usually between a metal halide and a metal borohydride. The reaction scheme (2.3) illustrates the synthesis of Mn(BH4)2 from LiBH4 and MnCl2.21,79 MnCl2(s) + 2LiBH4(s) → Mn(BH4)2(s) + 2LiCl(s)(2.3)
The drawback is obviously the formation of a mixture of an unwanted metal halide along with the product. The system ZnCl2–MBH4 (M = Li or Na) can be used to illustrate the complexity of reaction products from mechanochemical synthesis, which may proceed via more complex chemical reactions during ball milling.70 2ZnCl2(s) + 5LiBH4(s) → LiZn2(BH4)5(s) + 4LiCl(s)(2.4) 2ZnCl2(s) + 5NaBH4(s) → NaZn2(BH4)5(s) + 4NaCl(s)(2.5) ZnCl2(s) + 3NaBH4(s) → NaZn(BH4)3(s) + 2NaCl(s)(2.6)
Reaction schemes (2.5) and (2.6) illustrate that small deviations in the composition of reactants, e.g. from (1:2.5) to (1:3), may lead to significantly different reaction products, both in terms of the stoichiometry and crystal structures, i.e. the structures of NaZn(BH4)3 and NaZn2(BH4)5 are significantly different, which may suggest that the synthesis mechanism for these compounds is also different.
Further complications occur due to strong or weak coupling between the chemical reactions that occur during mechanochemical synthesis. Besides the main reaction that forms the product, competing side reactions may also take place, e.g. producing bimetallic halides. Sodium chloride produced in reaction (2.5) or (2.6) may further react with the reactant, zinc chloride: ZnCl2(s) + 2NaCl(s) → Na2ZnCl4(s)(2.7)
Thus, the synthesis of NaZn2(BH4)5 only partly proceeds (reaction scheme (2.5)), due to the formation of a stable ternary metal chloride, Na2ZnCl4, by a simultaneous and competing reaction (scheme (2.7)). The reaction schemes, (2.5) or (2.6) and (2.7), are weakly coupled shown by the fact that the reaction products contain varying amounts of NaCl, Na2ZnCl4, NaZn2(BH4)5, and reactants. Thus, reaction schemes (2.5)–(2.7) cannot simply be added to provide a scheme for the total reaction.
Sodium scandium borohydride, NaSc(BH4)4, can also be prepared mechanochemically and is assumed to follow the metathesis reaction (2.8),80 ScCl3(s) + 4NaBH4(s) → NaSc(BH4)4(s) + 3NaCl(s)(2.8)
However, reaction (2.8) is strongly coupled to the synthesis of a ternary sodium scandium chloride, Na3ScCl6via an addition reaction: ScCl3(s) + 3NaCl(s) → Na3ScCl6(s)(2.9)

Reaction (2.9) is much faster than the formation of the borohydride, NaSc(BH4)4(2.8) and these reactions, (2.8) and (2.9) are strongly coupled so they can be added to form an overall reaction (2.10). Therefore, the optimal ratio of reactants ScCl3–NaBH4 to synthesize NaSc(BH4)4 turns out to be 1:2. This mechanochemical synthesis leads to a maximum NaSc(BH4)4 yield of 22 wt% for a sample with composition (1:2) as suggested by reaction (2.10) and not the ratio (1:4) suggested in reaction (2.8) 2ScCl3(s) + 4NaBH4(s) → NaSc(BH4)4(s) + Na3ScCl6(s)(2.10)
The above considerations are also valid for synthesis of KSc(BH4)4, but not for synthesis of LiSc(BH4)4 where no ternary halide is formed.70,81
There is a tendency for more complex chemistry and other chemical reactions to occur when the heavier alkali metals and halides are used as reactants. Mechanochemical synthesis of M2ZnX4, M = Li or Na, X = Cl or Br from stoichiometric mixtures of MX and ZnX2 reveals that reaction times and activation energy decrease as Li2ZnCl4 > Na2ZnCl4 > Na2ZnBr4.82
The formation of ternary halides can be avoided in the synthesis of trimetallic borohydrides by varying the ratio between borohydrides and halides if at least two reactants are available as mono-metallic borohydrides. While reaction (2.11) produces the ternary salt, Li2MCl4, the alternative reaction (2.12) avoids this byproduct formation.83 15LiBH4 + 5MCl2 + 5ZnCl2 → Li3MZn5(BH4)15 + 4LiCl + 4Li2MCl4 M = Mg or Mn(2.11) 13LiBH4 + M(BH4)2 + 5ZnCl2 → Li3MZn5(BH4)15 + 10LiCl(2.12)
This observation also suggests that the formation of bimetallic halide salts can be considered a side reaction where the produced metal halide reacts with remaining reactants. In some cases, such side reactions can be suppressed partly or fully by using an excess of metal borohydride reactants, e.g. LiBH4, which may shift the reaction equilibrium towards the bi- or trimetallic borohydrides and the monometallic halide, e.g. LiCl.
2.3 Trends in the mechanochemical synthesis of metal borohydride-halides
Metal borohydride halides can be prepared with either ordered or disordered crystal structures, where in the latter case solid solutions occur. The system ZnCl2–KBH4 will be used to illustrate the complexity of the mechanochemical synthesis. Ball milling a mixture of ZnCl2–KBH4 (1:1) leads to an addition reaction and a single product, KZn(BH4)Cl2:84 ZnCl2(s) + KBH4(s) → KZn(BH4)Cl2(s)(2.13)
In this case, there are significant differences between the structures of the reactants and the product. The latter contains a heteroleptic complex ion containing BH4− as a ligand, i.e. [Zn(BH4)Cl2]− where Zn coordinates to two chloride ions and two hydrogen atoms in η2-BH4.84 This clearly demonstrates that ball milling may initiate complex chemical reactions involving bond breaking and bond formation.52 In contrast, three novel potassium zinc borohydrides/chlorides are observed in ball-milled KBH4–ZnCl2 mixtures with molar ratios in the range 1.5:1 to 3:1, KZn(BH4)3, K2Zn(BH4)xCl4−x and K3Zn(BH4)xCl5−x.85
Mechanochemical treatment may also facilitate one solid to dissolve into another, i.e. an addition reaction, which leads to formation of a solid solution, e.g. formation of a hexagonal solid solution h-Li(BH4)1−xBrx where the two anions, BH4− and Br−, are statistically distributed on the same crystallographic position, formed by mechanochemical treatment of LiBH4–LiBr.86
In some cases, the crystallinity of the sample and also the overall sample composition may be modified by thermal treatment of the sample. For example, the composition of NaY(BH4)2Cl2 changed to NaY(BH4)1.58Cl2.42 at T = 230 °C.87 The rare-earth metals are yet another example: LiCe(BH4)3Cl and LiLa(BH4)3Cl were prepared by ball milling,4 whereas LiGd(BH4)3Cl only crystallized after heat treatment at T = 195 °C.88 A similar trend is observed for the synthesis of metal borohydride amides e.g. Li2(BH4)(NH2), Li4(BH4)(NH2)3, Na2(BH4)(NH2) and Mg(BH4)(NH2),89–91 which are all metal cation conductors. These compounds are formed through ball milling (and annealing) of M(BH4)n–MNH2. In this case, NH2− does not substitute for BH4− to form solid solutions as for Cl−, instead, new structures are formed with distinct sites for BH4− and NH2−.
A detailed analysis of the unit cell volumes of LiBH4, KBH4 and LiK(BH4)2 indicates that the formation of the bimetallic borohydride is facilitated by a more dense packing as compared to the reactants.47 Thus, formation of LiK(BH4)2 is pressure-induced and takes place during ball milling, but not by annealing. This is in agreement with DFT calculations suggesting that LiK(BH4)2 should decompose to the reactants at ambient conditions.92 In contrast, the unit cell volumes of the solid solution Na1−xKxBH4 is larger than the sum of reactant volumes, (1 − x)NaBH4–xKBH4.93 Hence, the formation of Na1−xKxBH4 is temperature-induced and occurs upon annealing, i.e. thermal expansion, but not during ball milling.
2.4 Mechanochemical reactions, general considerations

Table 1 highlights the range of different chemical reactions that are typically observed during the synthesis of metal borohydrides by mechanochemistry. The literature suggests that monometallic borohydrides are more likely to form when LiBH4 is used as the precursor, possibly driven by the formation of the stable halide, LiCl. Furthermore, an excess of LiBH4 may improve the crystallinity of reaction products. The heavier alkali metal borohydrides have a significantly greater tendency to form bimetallic halide salts, MxM′Xx+nvia addition reactions (the nomenclature is explained in Table 1). Such reactions may occur when LiCl is present together with a heavier metal halide, M′Xn or LiCl may be incorporated into the product producing ordered bimetallic borohydrides chlorides, LiCe(BH4)3Cl (except in the case of Li2CdCl4 and Li2MCl4, M = Mg, Mn). A range of rarer reactions can also be observed, which are considered analogous to the general reactions, (1)–(4) or combinations of those. For example, mono- or bimetallic borohydride chlorides with crystallographically disordered structures i.e. NaY(BH4)1.58Cl2.42 can be formed either by substitution (eqn (4)) or complex (eqn (2)) reactions.87

Generally, di- and tripositive metal halides, MBH4–M′Cln, have very different reactivities and stabilities depending on their metal electronegativity and d-electron configuration. Therefore, different milling times are required to successfully obtain the desired product. For example, synthesis of MSc(BH4)4 (M = Li, Na or K) occurs by ball-milling MBH4–ScCl3 (2:1) for 120–180 min, while the cadmium borohydrides, α-Cd(BH4)2, β-Cd(BH4)2, KCd(BH4)3 and K2Cd(BH4)4 are formed from MBH4–CdCl2 (M = Li, Na or K) after only 20–30 min mechanochemical treatment. Only the transition metals with d0, d5 or d10 electron configurations have sufficient stability to allow for mechanochemical preparation.8 However, transition metal borohydrides, M′(BH4)2, M′ = Cr2+ (d4), Fe2+ (d6) and Co2+ (d7), were recently prepared in solution at T < −30 °C, and stabilised by ammonia–metal coordination, i.e. formation of M′(NH3)6(BH4)2 compounds.94
2.5 Mechanical synthesis in different gas atmosphere
Solvent-free synthesis of monometallic borohydrides, e.g. lithium borohydride, LiBH4, formed in an addition reaction between lithium hydride, LiH, and diborane, B2H6 gas at T = 120 °C has recently been demonstrated.95 The formation of LiBD4 from LiD and B2D6 was followed using in situ powder neutron diffraction, which reveals that the nucleation of LiBD4 begins at T ∼ 102 °C, i.e. with the formation of the hexagonal polymorph, h-LiBD4. However, the reaction is incomplete and the yield is only ∼50% even at elevated temperatures (187 °C) with the product containing small amounts of Li2B12H12. A passivation layer of LiBH4 is suggested to form on the surface of the LiH grains retarding the process.96,97 Mechanochemical treatment allows for the continuous removal of as-formed borohydride from the surface layer of particles, facilitating a more complete reaction. Diborane gas is produced by heating a ball milled 2.5LiBH4–ZnCl2 sample, i.e. decomposition of LiZn2(BH4)5,70,96 which is considered a convenient and relatively safe source of diborane as compared to pressurized gas bottles. This new gas–solid mechanochemical synthesis method has also successfully provided other metal borohydrides, such as Mg(BH4)2, Ca(BH4)2 and Y(BH4)3.97,98 Direct synthesis of α-Y(BH4)3 by ball milling YH3 in a B2H6 atmosphere gave yields above 75%,98,99 and ball milling Y(BH4)3 in B2H6 has also led to the discovery of Y(B3H8)3 and Y2(B12H12)3, suggesting that higher boranes might also be formed during the decomposition of Y(BH4)3.100 These solid–gas reactions can be considered as addition reactions analogous to the solvent-based reactions described above (see Section 2.1). Thus, this analogy suggest that the solvent-free solid–gas reactions are only useful when Lewis base type ionic or polar covalent hydrides, such as LiH, providing an electron-pair donating H− ion, or BH4−, can be utilised as reactants to form a borohydride or higher borane. The solid–gas reactions are promising for extending the series of solvent-free metal boranes.
2.6 Single crystal growth of metal borohydrides
Despite significant efforts, single crystal investigations of metal borohydrides are very scarce. This is mainly due to the complications arising when attempting to grow metal borohydrides by classical solution chemistry. Solvents need to be carefully selected in order to avoid the formation of solvates. Unfortunately, non-coordinating apolar solvents often have low solubility limits. Notably, single crystal studies have been reported on mono-metallic compounds such as LiBH4,101 NaBH4,102,103 KBH4,104 Be(BH4)2,105 Mg(BH4)2,106 and Al(BH4)3,107 where crystals can be grown from a solution, by annealing the powder, or by recrystallizing from a melt. Techniques involving melting are useful for mono-metallic borohydrides but limited to bi- and trimetallic borohydrides that are sufficiently thermally stable (recall that a high number of these compounds are prepared mechanochemically, stabilized by high pressure rather than elevated temperature). Powder samples of framework-type metal borohydrides produced mechanochemically may, in some cases, be partly dissolved in a suitable solvent and then recrystallized to larger crystals. Single crystals of KCa(BH4)3 were recently prepared from flux, which can be an eutectically melting mixture of more stable alkali and/or earth alkali metal borohydrides with sufficiently large thermal stability.108
Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) was reported as an approach for the crystal growth of Zr(BH4)4, which is formed by a metathesis reaction of ZrCl4 and LiBH4 during ball milling:109 ZrCl4(s) + 4LiBH4(s) → Zr(BH4)4(s) + 4LiCl(s)(2.14)
The ball milled sample was stored in a vial at −30 °C for 2–4 weeks when transparent single-crystals with a rectangular shape were noticed under the lid, explained by the low sublimation temperature of Zr(BH4)4 (29 °C) because of its molecular structure.109 CVD is an elegant method for single crystal growth of metal borohydrides, which may be limited to volatile molecular compounds with low vapour pressures and sublimation temperatures.
The importance of producing single crystal samples stems not only from the fact that physical properties such as ionic conductivity can be highly anisotropic110 and powder averaging can present problems to such characterizations, but also from the necessity of providing accurate input for theoretical evaluations of hydrogen storage systems.
2.7 Synthesis of metal borohydrides with neutral molecules
Metal borohydrides form complexes with hydrogen-rich nitrogen-based neutral molecules, which can be in the solid state (e.g. ammonia borane, NH3BH3), liquid state (e.g. hydrazine, NH2NH2), or gas state (e.g. ammonia, NH3). These compounds are capable of generating large amounts of hydrogen by combining the hydrogen atoms present in the two counterparts. Borohydride complexes with water have similar properties but usually have a lower stability, where the hydrates of sodium,111 lithium,112 and calcium113 are characterized.

Ammonia borane metal borohydride complexes. 
Ammonia borane metal borohydride complexes are formed by addition reactions between NH3BH3 and LiBH4, Mg(BH4)2, Ca(BH4)2 and Al(BH4)3. For the solids LiBH4, Mg(BH4)2, Ca(BH4)2 the complexes are prepared by ball-milling.114,115 Interestingly, the mixture α-Mg(BH4)2–NH3BH3 (1:2) converts completely into Mg(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2 upon ball milling, while Mg(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2 is not formed when starting from amorphous Mg(BH4)2 and NH3BH3.115 This is counter-intuitive, since amorphous matter usually has higher reactivity, suggesting that there is a structural relationship allowing the borohydride to coordinate with neutral ligands. Optimal contact between reactants is offered by liquid Al(BH4)3 at ambient conditions to form single-crystals of Al(BH4)3·NH3BH3.116


Hydrazine metal borohydrides. 
Complexes with hydrazine are reported for LiBH4, NaBH4 and Mg(BH4)2, e.g. LiBH4·NH2NH2. These compounds were synthesized by placing the precursor metal borohydride and hydrazine in different chambers of a sealed system at room temperature.117 Due to the vapour pressure, hydrazine typically absorbs into the borohydride over the course of hours. Alternatively, the complexes are formed by ball milling solid–liquid mixtures of M(BH4)m–NH2NH2.118


Ammine metal borohydrides. 
Metal borohydrides readily react with ammonia gas in solid–gas reactions forming ammine metal borohydrides, M(BH4)m·nNH3, except for the heavier alkali metal borohydrides: NaBH4, KBH4, RbBH4 and CsBH4. However, the first ammine metal borohydrides, e.g. Zn(BH4)2·4NH3, were synthesized in the 1950's by solvent-based methods.119
Recent literature reveals that the NH3/BH4 ratio (n/m) of ammine metal borohydrides, M(BH4)m·nNH3, can be efficiently tailored by combining solvent based methods, solid–gas reactions and mechanochemistry. Initially, a metal borohydride is prepared by a solvent-based method or by solvent extraction of a mechanochemically prepared metal borohydride metal halide mixture, e.g. using a weakly coordinating solvent such as dimethyl sulfide, S(CH3)2. Ammine metal borohydrides may be prepared by passing dry NH3 gas through the solution of M(BH4)3 in S(CH3)2 or by a reaction between dry NH3 gas and solid M(BH4)3. Ammonia always coordinates to the metal by a strongly exothermic reaction and cooling is usually needed in order to obtain the metal borohydride containing the highest possible number of ammonia molecules for further synthesis, e.g. M(BH4)3·7NH3, M = Y, Gd or Dy prepared at T ∼ −5 °C.53 Synthesis of ammine metal borohydrides in more strongly coordinating solvents, such as THF, is also possible, however, the samples are contaminated by the formation of ammonia borane.120
Mechanochemical treatment of the ammine metal borohydride having the highest possible number of ammonia molecules and the corresponding metal borohydride in various ratios is a convenient way to get new ammine metal borohydrides with varying NH3/BH4 ratio. This approach is demonstrated for ammine manganese borohydride, Mn(BH4)2·nNH3 for n = 1, 2, 3 and 6.54 nMn(BH4)2·6NH3(s) + (6 − n)Mn(BH4)2(s) → 6Mn(BH4)2·nNH3(s)(2.15)

3. Trends in structural chemistry of metal borohydrides
The past decade has experienced a major increase in the number of experimental structural studies of novel metal borohydrides, in particular using powder X-ray or neutron diffraction.121–123 Various equipment has been designed to enable this type of PXD characterization under high gas pressure and temperature.124,125 The interest in crystal chemistry of metal borohydrides was initiated in the late 1940's by investigations into the most ionic and stable monometallic borohydrides, namely MBH4, M = Na, K, Rb and Cs.18,19 Later studies focused on the more challenging molecular, volatile and covalent compounds, e.g. Al(BH4)3, Zr(BH4)4 and Hf(BH4)4.107,126,127 In between these two extremes we find numerous metal borohydrides with framework structures, pronounced bonding directionality and clearly some degree of covalency, e.g. Mg(BH4)2 and Mn(BH4)2.3,21,106,128,129 The successful structural analysis of LiBH4 in 2002 was the initiation of this renewed interest in metal borohydrides.24
The first bimetallic borohydride, LiK(BH4)2 was discovered and characterized in 2008.130 Since then, a rapidly increasing number of bimetallic and also trimetallic83 borohydrides have been described, often containing complex anions. Some compounds fall within more than one of these categories, for instance, LiZn2(BH4)5 contains [Zn2(BH4)5]− complex anions but can also be considered as being built from interpenetrated frameworks.70
Clearly, metal borohydrides exhibit a fascinating and surprisingly versatile crystal chemistry, which the following section will review, highlighting general trends and relationships. Initially, mono-metallic borohydrides will be discussed (Table 2), starting from the simple cubic ionic structures, moving towards more covalent and complex bi- and trimetallic borohydrides (Tables 3 and 4), including framework structures and anionic complexes.

3.1 Monometallic borohydrides, the s-block – pronounced ionic bonding
The alkali metal borohydrides, MBH4, M = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, primarily exhibit ionic bonding and theoretical studies show that there is almost no charge density (<5%) between the M+ and BH4− ions in their structures.173–176 An experimental charge density investigation of o-LiBH4 reveals transfer of 0.86 ± 0.09 e− (at 10 and 90 K) from Li to BH4 in accordance with the ionic structure description.175

Lithium borohydride. 
Four polymorphs of lithium borohydride, LiBH4, have been described and the orthorhombic o-LiBH4 (Pnma) structure at ambient conditions is unique.24 Single crystal XRD investigations of o-LiBH4 at 225 K unambiguously reveal nearly ideal tetrahedral geometry of the BH4 group, in contrast to more distorted tetrahedra reported in earlier PXD studies.22,24 Powder neutron diffraction of the triple isotopically substituted o-7Li11BD4 at 3.5 K reveals boron–hydrogen bond lengths (B–H) of 1.208–1.225 Å, and bond angles (H–B–H) in the range 107.2–111.7°.177
Orthorhombic o-LiBH4 transforms to a hexagonal wurtzite-like polymorph h-LiBH4 (P63mc) at ∼110 °C. PND and PXD studies reveal large and anisotropic displacements of hydrogen atoms.177,178 The observed atomic displacement ellipsoids may indicate orientational disorder in addition to thermal vibrations of the BH4 group. The large vibrational amplitudes of BH4 in the hexagonal polymorph agree with an apparent shortening of the B–H bonds to ∼1.07 Å. An entropy contribution from this disorder is considered to be a factor in stabilizing the hexagonal structure.101,178 Two high pressure polymorphs of LiBH4 are also observed at room temperature. One polymorph is observed at a pressure of 1.2–18 GPa, which is pseudo-tetragonal (Ama2) with Li tetrahedrally coordinated by four BH4 groups and the BH4 groups in a nearly square-planar coordination by four Li atoms.131 A more complex ordering of the BH4 groups, showing repulsive interactions, was first suggested in the √2a × 2c supercell of the Ama2 structure theoretically179 and then shown experimentally.180 At high pressure a cubic LiBH4 polymorph forms, which is isostructural to cubic NaBH4.131 In general, the four polymorphs of lithium borohydride primarily show coordination between lithium and the borohydride complex anion by edge sharing, but h-LiBH4 and o-LiBH4 appear to have face sharing for the shortest Li–B contact (2.37 Å). The structural distortions in LiBH4 polymorphs have been analysed by group-theoretical and crystal-chemical considerations revealing the layered structure of LiBH4181 where the deformation of layers define the structural stability of the observed polymorphs.


The heavier alkali metals. 
Available p-orbitals and the increasing sizes of heavier alkali metals facilitate the formation of rock salt (NaCl, Fmm) type structures of alkali metal borohydrides, MBH4, M = Na, K, Rb and Cs. Theoretical studies suggest that electron density deformations of the heavier alkali metals may also contribute to the formation of NaCl-type structures.176 Additional studies at low temperature and high pressures have discovered several other structural polymorphs.18,19,133,135,182


Alkaline earth metal borohydrides. 
The monometallic alkaline earth metal borohydrides show increasingly covalent and directional bonding with decreasing ionic radius and increasing electronegativity and charge density, in the series, Be > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba. Indeed, the number of polymorphs (in parentheses) of composition M(BH4)2 show decreasing trends in the series Mg (7) > Ca (4) > Sr (3) > Ba (4). Porosity in the solid state is also observed in frameworks with the highest covalence, namely α- and γ-Mg(BH4)2, with 6 and 30% of open space in the structures, respectively.


Strontium and barium borohydride. 
Sr(BH4)2 and Ba(BH4)2 are the most ionic of the alkaline earth metal borohydrides.142,143 Barium borohydride is synthesised as an orthorhombic polymorph (o1), which transforms to another orthorhombic polymorph (o2) at T ∼ 395 °C, which is isostructural to o-M(BH4)2, M = Sr, Sm, Eu.68,142,143,147 o2-Ba(BH4)2 transforms to t- and c-Ba(BH4)2 polymorphs at 445 and 460 °C. Similarly, o-M(BH4)2, M = Sr, Eu also transform to t- and c-M(BH4)2 polymorphs upon heating. These polymorphs are structurally related, o1- to CaCl2-type, o- and o2- to α-PbO2, t- to ht-ZrO2, and c- to CaF2.143 In fact, the CaCl2 structure type is an orthorhombic deformation of the tetragonal rutile type (TiO2), which is based on hcp packing of BH4− anions, i.e. metal ions placed in octahedral positions. The α-PbO2 structure is then related to the rutile type by a well-known phase transition which may be induced by applying pressure. The t-polymorph is a superstructure (doubled c-axis) of the ht-ZrO2 type which is a deformation of cubic CaF2 structure type. The orthorhombic structures of the α-PbO2-type likely form due to the similar cation sizes, Sm2+ (r = 1.22 Å), Eu2+ (r = 1.25 Å), Sr2+ (r = 1.26 Å), Ba2+ (r = 1.42 Å).


Calcium borohydride. 
Four distinct polymorphs of calcium borohydride, denoted α-, α′-, β- and γ-Ca(BH4)2, are described, which are structurally related to polymorphs of TiO2.183–185 The orthorhombic polymorph, stable at RT, is α-Ca(BH4)2 (F2dd).137 A second order phase transition at ∼220 °C was described as a group–subgroup transition from F2dd to I2d for the polymorphs α- to α′-Ca(BH4)2.137 At higher temperatures, the polymorphs α- and α′-Ca(BH4)2 transform to β-Ca(BH4)2 with a more complex structure described by two similar models P42/m138 and P,137 combining diffraction data and DFT optimization. The β-Ca(BH4)2 polymorph may have some dynamic motion of the BH4 groups in the solid state, e.g. similar to the high-temperature h-LiBH4 polymorph.9,101 The high-temperature β-Ca(BH4)2 polymorph is 4–6% denser than α- and α′-Ca(BH4)2, and at room temperature it slowly converts back to orthorhombic α-Ca(BH4)2.186 Solvent based synthesis methods provide another orthorhombic polymorph, γ-Ca(BH4)2, which irreversibly transforms to β-Ca(BH4)2 at T ∼ 320 °C.139 The crystal structures of all four Ca(BH4)2 polymorphs contain calcium cations coordinated by six borohydride anions forming octahedra, which suggests ionic bonding. However, the existence of non-densely packed polymorphs points towards some degree of directionality in the Ca–BH4 bonding.


Magnesium borohydride. 
The extreme structural flexibility observed for metal borohydrides is highlighted in magnesium borohydride for which seven very different crystalline polymorphs are known: α-, β-, β′-, ε-, ζ-, γ- and δ-Mg(BH4)2.3,106,128,129,134,187–189 The α-Mg(BH4)2 polymorph crystallizes in a large hexagonal unit cell a = 10.354 and c = 37.055 Å (originally reported in P61)190,191 in the symmetry P6122, confirmed by DFT and single-crystal diffraction.106,192 Analysis of the initial P61 models shows that the determination of H-atom locations from powder data posed the main problem for identification of the correct symmetry. Solid α-Mg(BH4)2 contains an unoccupied volume of 6.4% within the structure.106 These voids are, in principle, large enough (37 Å3) to accommodate a small molecule, such as H2O. The α-polymorph transforms to an orthorhombic β-Mg(BH4)2 polymorph at T > 220 °C, which can be described in a super cell with Fddd symmetry, a = 37.072, b = 18.6476 and c = 10.9123 Å.106,134,190 The high-temperature β-polymorph is ∼3% less dense and contains no unoccupied voids.
Solvent based synthesis using triethylamine borane or dimethyl sulfide borane complexes provide two different crystalline magnesium borohydride solvates.3,56 The monoclinic solvate structure of Mg(BH4)2·1/2S(CH3)2 is a 3D framework containing two Mg sites: one Mg is tetrahedrally coordinated to four BH4 groups, and the other to four BH4 groups and one S(CH3)2 ligand forming a trigonal bipyramid. The S(CH3)2 ligand can be extracted at moderate conditions (T < 100 °C), which provides the highly symmetric cubic structure of γ-Mg(BH4)2 (Iad) (see Fig. 1), where a single Mg site is tetrahedrally coordinated to the BH4 groups. The structure has a 3D network of interpenetrated channels and γ-Mg(BH4)2 is the first hydride to have a large permanent porosity. The empty volume in the structure amounts to ∼33%. The narrowest part of the pore channel is defined by a 5.8 Å distance between hydrogen atoms, but in contrast, a point at (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) in the structure is 3.56 Å away from the nearest H-atom, 4.12 Å from B and 4.82 Å from Mg. The framework topology of γ-Mg(BH4)2 is isomorphic to both a hypothetical zeolite type polymorph of SiO2 and to a porous zinc imidazolate framework ZIF-72.3,193 This is illustrated by the amorphisation of porous γ-Mg(BH4)2 at RT over time and recrystallization of γ-Mg(BH4)2 upon heating at T = 80 °C. Amorphisation of porous materials, e.g. metal organic frameworks (MOF) is a well-known feature, but recrystallization of a porous framework upon heating has possibly not been observed for any other material.194
 Fig. 1  The crystal structure of (a) porous γ-Mg(BH4)2, ρ = 0.550 g mL−1 and (b) the high-pressure δ-Mg(BH4)2, ρ = 0.987 g mL−1. 
Powder X-ray diffraction experiments conducted at elevated pressures, using diamond anvil cells, reveal extreme collapse of the α- and γ-Mg(BH4)2 structures upon compression,195 equating to a ∼20% and ∼44% volume contraction, respectively. The compression of γ-Mg(BH4)2 displays the largest volume contraction observed, or predicted, for a hydride material. α-Mg(BH4)2 transforms to a new high pressure polymorph of magnesium borohydride denoted δ-Mg(BH4)2 at 1.1–1.6 GPa. Whereas highly porous γ-Mg(BH4)2 transforms to an X-ray amorphous material at 0.4–0.9 GPa and then to crystalline δ-Mg(BH4)2 at ∼2 GPa. The polymorph δ-Mg(BH4)2 has a tetragonal structure consisting of two interpenetrated Mg(BH4)2 frameworks (Fig. 1). Each framework resembles the cristobalite structure (a polymorph of SiO2), whilst their doubly interpenetrated arrangement has a Cu2O topology, which is typical for MOFs. This structural organization is stable on compression up to ∼15 GPa, upon decompression to 1 bar, and even on heating up to ∼100 °C at ambient pressure, where it then transforms to α-Mg(BH4)2.
All experimentally discovered Mg(BH4)2 polymorphs, and the lowest-energy theoretical structures, contain BH4 coordinated by two Mg cations via opposite tetrahedral edges (η2) with Mg–B–Mg angles deviating by 3–20° from linearity. The Mg⋯BH4 interaction is highly directional and the Mg–BH4–Mg fragments can be considered fundamental building units in all the structures. Magnesium atoms coordinate four BH4 tetrahedra in a strongly deformed tetrahedral environment. Interestingly, Mg atoms only form a limited set of MgH8 polyhedra where only the less uniform Johnson solids are found in the experimental structures.1961H and 11B spin–lattice relaxation NMR studies of the BH4 reorientational motion support the highly anisotropic BH4⋯Mg interaction in α-Mg(BH4)2.2 This contrasts the theoretically predicted structures, which always contain MgH8 cubes.3 The predicted Mg(BH4)2 structures also tend to be either highly porous or dense, e.g. the low-density Im2 (ρ = 0.56 g cm−3) and F222 (ρ = 0.54 g cm−3) structures, containing a single porous framework or a dense, doubly interpenetrated framework I41/amd (ρ = 1.01 g cm−3). Although these predicted structures are topologically similar to γ- and δ-Mg(BH4)2 (Fig. 1), they have not yet been observed experimentally.
Both experiments and theoretical predictions suggest vast polymorphism of Mg(BH4)2. Moreover, all the experimentally observed polymorphs are stable at ambient conditions and in relatively wide temperature and pressure ranges indicating that the reconstruction of strongly bound Mg(BH4)2 coordination frameworks is kinetically hindered. This may be due to the high stability of the linear Mg–BH4–Mg units, linking the MgH8 nodes into various framework structures, similar to partly covalently-bonded MOFs. The stability of Mg(BH4)2 polymorphs may also be related to the relative stability of the MgH8 polyhedra. Clearly, the BH4 complexes act as directional ligands, similar to organic ligands (“linkers”) with partly covalent coordination to metals in MOFs. The Mg–BH4 interaction is directional and partly covalent and is essentially the reason for the MOF-like behaviour of Mg(BH4)2, i.e. the rich polymorphism and their relatively high stability, the large pressure-induced volume collapses, the amorphisation under pressure and the surprising recrystallization of porous structures from amorphous material. The unusual crystal chemistry and high structural complexity of Mg(BH4)2 is the most extreme case for metal borohydrides, but is typical for coordination polymers, such as MOFs.

3.2 Monometallic borohydrides with the d- and f-block
Stable metal borohydrides with the d-block metals can be prepared for metals, which in a low oxidation state, have the d-electron configurations, d0, d5 or d10.8 Scandium borohydride has not yet been obtained in pure form, but a series of alkali scandium bimetallic borohydrides, MSc(BH4)4, M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs are discussed in Section 3.5 of this review. Titanium borohydride, Ti(BH4)3 with d1 configuration appears as an exception to this trend, but it is a molecular borohydride (see Section 3.3), with limited stability, decomposing at T < 0 °C. Transition metal borohydrides, M(BH4)2, M = Cr2+ (d4), Fe2+ (d6) and Co2+ (d7) are stable in solution (T < −30 °C) but not yet in the solid state at RT.94

Yttrium borohydride. 
Y(BH4)3, has received significant interest as a hydrogen storage material due to the high gravimetric hydrogen content, ρm(Y(BH4)3) = 9.07 wt% H2, and moderate decomposition temperature, T ∼ 270 °C. Y(BH4)3 exists as two polymorphs, α- and β-Y(BH4)3, both stable at ambient conditions.144,145,197,198 Mechanochemical treatment of LiBH4 and YCl3 yields α-Y(BH4)3, and in some cases small amounts of β-Y(BH4)3. Solvent-based methods may provide a solvate Y(BH4)3S(CH3)2, which transforms to α-Y(BH4)3 during desolvation at T ∼ 140 °C.66 Transformation from α- to β-Y(BH4)3 is observed when heating in a narrow temperature interval, 190–200 °C, as decomposition begins at higher temperatures.145,197 The high-temperature polymorph is stable on cooling.
α-Y(BH4)3 crystallizes in a cubic unit cell a = 10.7445 Å (Pa), whilst β-Y(BH4)3 crystallizes in a slightly larger cubic unit cell a = 11.0086 Å (Fmc).145,197,199 The structure of β-Y(BH4)3 was initially suggested to be disordered primitive cubic, a = 5.4547 Å (Pm3m), based on SR-PXD data, but later defined as ordered in a supercell using powder neutron diffraction data.145 The major difference between the two powder diffraction patterns is that the strongest reflection in PND data (531), which is the only reflection defining the doubled lattice parameter, is practically invisible in PXD data.145,197 The cubic framework structures of the two polymorphs are closely related, yttrium being octahedrally coordinated to six BH4 anions. In β-Y(BH4)3, the octahedral coordination of Y is regular but is somewhat distorted in α-Y(BH4)3. The [Y(BH4)6] octahedra share corners and coordinate via Y–B–Y bridges where BH4 units share edges (η2) to yttrium, i.e. resulting in a 12-fold coordination of yttrium to hydrogen.145 Furthermore, the high-temperature β-polymorph structure is 4.6% less dense than α-Y(BH4)3 and contains relatively large unoccupied voids of 39 Å3, which are smaller in the low-temperature polymorph. The H⋯H repulsion seems to be at the origin of the polymorphic transition. The orientation of BH4 groups in β-Y(BH4)3 slightly expands the structure and maximizes the H⋯H contacts, whereas half of the BH4 complexes in α-Y(BH4)3 are flipped, allowing for a more densely packed structure, but with shorter H⋯H contacts (Fig. 2). This situation is somewhat similar to the disordered cubic alkali borohydrides, MBH4 (M = Na–Cs), where the number of repulsive H⋯H contacts is minimized via a local ordering of the BH4 groups at low temperatures.56
 Fig. 2  Fragment (1/8 of the unit cell shown by green lines) of the crystal structure of the low-temperature α-Y(BH4)3 polymorph (left) and the high-temperature β-Y(BH4)3 polymorph (right). Both structures are viewed along the same direction of their respective cubic unit cells. While in the low-temperature polymorph the (BH4)6 octahedron around yttrium is deformed allowing for more efficient packing in the structure but with shorter H⋯H contacts (given in Å), the same octahedron in the high-temperature polymorph is regular with maximized H⋯H contacts and a less dense structure. The polymorphic transition is induced by flipping of three BH4 groups labelled with white numbers. 


Manganese borohydride. 
Mn(BH4)2, (Mn2+, d5) was the first transition metal borohydride to be described, in 2009, denoted α-Mn(BH4)2, and is one amongst a total of four manganese borohydride polymorphs known to date.21,58,140 The polymorph, α-Mn(BH4)2, was originally prepared mechanochemically from MnCl2 and LiBH4.200 A different manganese borohydride solvate can be obtained using dimethylsulfide as the solvent, Mn(BH4)2·1/2S(CH3)2, which is isostructural to the magnesium analogue, Mg(BH4)2·1/2S(CH3)2. Gentle removal of the solvent provides a porous polymorph, γ-Mn(BH4)2 that is isostructural to the magnesium analogue, γ-Mg(BH4)2.58 The unit cell volume of γ-Mn(BH4)2 is ∼8.8% larger than that of the Mg-counterpart,3 which corresponds well to the radius of Mn2+ (r = 0.80 Å) being larger than that of Mg2+ (r = 0.71 Å). Furthermore, SR-PXD data58 indicate one or more unidentified compounds, which may be a manganese analogue of ε-Mg(BH4)2.188 Thus, the structural chemistry of manganese borohydride resembles that of the magnesium analogue.
The structure of α-Mn(BH4)2 contains two independent Mn atoms both surrounded by four BH4 units in a deformed tetrahedral coordination, whilst each BH4 is nearly linearly coordinated by two Mn atoms via the opposite tetrahedral edges (η2), exactly as observed for magnesium borohydrides. The structure of α-Mn(BH4)2 is also isostructural to ζ-Mg(BH4)2.58 The structures of α-Mn(BH4)2 and α-Mg(BH4)2 show similarity and both contain similar chiral layers, stacked along the c-axis, and rotated by 120° by the 31 axis in α-Mn(BH4)2 and by 60° by the 61 axis in α-Mg(BH4)2. Existence of a solid solution MgxMn1−x(BH4)2 further illustrates the close similarity between manganese and magnesium borohydrides.65 Similar to α-Mg(BH4)2, α-Mn(BH4)2 also has some degree of porosity in the structure and contains isolated voids with an estimated volume of 21 Å3, occupying 6% of the structure volume.
At pressures above ∼1 GPa, α-Mn(BH4)2 transforms into the high-pressure δ-phase having either Pn2 or I41/acd space group symmetry,140 the latter shows the same ordering pattern for the BH4 group as suggested by Yao and Klug for high-pressure LiBH4.179 δ-Mn(BH4)2 is quenchable to ambient pressure and shows a volumetric hydrogen density of 125 g H2 L−1 at ambient conditions but turns back into the α-phase on heating to 67–109 °C. At pressure above 8.6 GPa, a δ′-phase with Fddd structure forms reversibly.


Cadmium borohydride. 
Cd(BH4)2 (Cd2+, d10) is another recently characterized monometallic borohydride with low and high temperature polymorphs, α- and β-Cd(BH4)2 and a first order polymorphic transition at T ∼ 55 °C.146 Both polymorphs consist of two identical interpenetrated three-dimensional frameworks built from Cd coordinated to four BH4 units by edge sharing (η2). Each Cd atom is coordinated almost linearly by two BH4 complexes. The [Cd(BH4)4] tetrahedra are slightly distorted in tetragonal α-Cd(BH4)2 whilst exhibiting ideal tetrahedral geometry in cubic β-Cd(BH4)2. The cubic β-Cd(BH4)2 has a Cu2O-antitype structure with B and Cd on the positions of Cu and O, respectively, while α-Cd(BH4)2 has a tetragonally distorted structure, identical to the tetragonal high-pressure polymorph of magnesium borohydride δ-Mg(BH4)2.3 The parent cubic structure has also been mentioned as a possible high-symmetry polymorph of Mg(BH4)2.106,191


Monometallic rare-earth borohydrides. 
Synthesis of La(BH4)3 and Ce(BH4)3 was initially conducted by mechanochemically facilitated metathesis reactions but without structural characterization.201,202 A number of other monometallic rare-earth borohydrides are reported, which can be subdivided into two groups, those with oxidation state (III), isostructural to polymorphs of Y(BH4)3 and those with oxidation state (II), isostructural to Sr(BH4)2 or Ca(BH4)2. The later consists of Sm(BH4)2, Eu(BH4)268 and Yb(BH4)2 as was mentioned in Section 3.1. Samarium forms monometallic borohydrides both in oxidation state (II) and (III). Mechanochemical treatment of SmCl3 and LiBH4 reveals Bragg peaks corresponding to two primitive cubic unit cells with dimensions a = 11.10 Å (Pa) and a = 5.64 Å (Pmm).147 The former is isostructural to α-Y(BH4)3 and the latter is isostructural to the initially reported structure for β-Y(BH4)3 from SR-PXD.197
Ytterbium reveals a similar structural diversity to samarium, forming borohydrides in both oxidation states (II) and (III), which are isostructural to known structure types.150,163 In the oxidation state (II), β-Yb(BH4)2 and γ-Yb(BH4)2 are isostructural to β-Ca(BH4)2 and γ-Ca(BH4)2, respectively. Mechanochemical treatment of YbCl3 and LiBH4 yields α-Yb(BH4)3 and β-Yb(BH4)3 that are isostructural to α-Y(BH4)3 and β-Y(BH4)3. Erbium borohydride also forms two polymorphs, α-Er(BH4)3 and β-Er(BH4)3, isostructural to yttrium borohydride analogues (Fig. 2).
However, the rare-earths gadolinium, terbium and dysprosium each only form one polymorph (Pa) Gd(BH4)3, Tb(BH4)3 and Dy(BH4)3, which are isostructural to α-Y(BH4)3,144,147 but a high temperature polymorph may also exist for Gd(BH4)3.203

3.3 Strongly covalent molecular monometallic borohydrides
Several monometallic borohydrides appear to have prevailingly covalent bonding and directionality in the M–BH4 coordination. The first example is beryllium borohydride, Be(BH4)2, known in one very unique structural form.105 The tetragonal structure was investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and reveals trigonal-planar coordinated beryllium by three edge-sharing BH4 groups, i.e. beryllium has an unusually high coordination number of six hydrogen atoms in the nearest coordination sphere. Two borohydride complexes are bridging beryllium with linear Be–B–Be geometry and edge sharing (η2) coordination. Another borohydride anion also coordinates to Be by edge sharing (η2) but is terminal with two dangling hydrogen atoms. The structure is built from one-dimensional polymeric chains held together by weak interactions. This is illustrated by the fact that beryllium borohydride is reported to have a significant vapour pressure at RT and readily sublimes, which illustrates that there are weak intermolecular interactions and that the polymeric chains dissociate easily. In the gas phase, beryllium borohydride Be(BH4)2 may be a molecular compound, with face-sharing BH4 (η3) and the same coordination of beryllium, CN(Be) = 6. Furthermore, the compound is unusually reactive and pyrophoric due to the characteristic three-centre-two-electron bonds in the Be–H–B contacts,204 similar to diborane, B2H6. Be(BH4)2 is also extremely poisonous like other beryllium compounds.105 The highest gravimetric hydrogen density of a metal borohydride is observed for Be(BH4)2, ρm(Be(BH4)2) = 20.8 wt% H2 (Table 2), which also has the second-highest volumetric hydrogen density for metal borohydrides, ρV(Be(BH4)2) = 127 g H2 L−1.
The most strongly polarizing cations form molecular monometallic borohydride structures, e.g. Ti3+, Al3+ with electronegativity χp ∼ 1.5 and Zr4+ and Hf4+ with χp ∼ 1.3. The structures of both zirconium and hafnium borohydride are isostructural molecular metal borohydrides and consist of isolated neutral M(BH4)4 units (Fig. 3) having low sublimation temperatures, Tsub(Zr(BH4)4) = 29 °C.109,126,127 The tetrahedral molecules of Zr and Hf borohydrides are analogous to the methane molecule where each BH4 complex coordinates via face sharing (η3) to the metal with one dangling hydrogen atom and the solids have primitive cubic unit cells. The experimental structural data clearly supports previous assumptions that solid Zr(BH4)4 consists of discrete neutral molecules interacting mainly by weak van der Waals and dispersion interactions. The shortest distance between neighbouring molecules in the solid is defined by the intermolecular H⋯H distances of 2.77 Å. Four hydrogen atoms point towards the center of the unit cell, being responsible for the intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure.109

Aluminum borohydride. 
Aluminum borohydride is another molecular metal borohydride, consisting of discrete Al(BH4)3 units, that was characterized in 1997.107 Aluminum borohydride has a high gravimetric hydrogen content, ρm = 16.8 wt% H2, but is volatile and pyrophoric with a tendency to release diborane at RT and therefore very challenging to handle and utilize in practical applications.205


Titanium borohydride. 
Titanium borohydride, Ti(BH4)3 is of high interest as the only genuine transition metal borohydride with an open set of d-orbitals (d1 electron configuration), and despite many published reports on this compound the solid state structure remains unknown.151,206 However, the gas phase structure has been characterized by electron diffraction,20 which reveals monomeric Ti(BH4)3 species with BH4 face sharing to the metal center (η3) with an overall C3h symmetry. The tridentate bonding in volatile Ti(BH4)3 has been confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy20 and calculated structural optimizations.207,208 Though following a tridentate coordination-scheme in the gas phase, in some molecular compounds such as [Li(Et2O)2][Ti2(BH4)5(PMe2Ph)4],209 titanium centres are bridged by bidentate BH4 (η2), thus forming one dimensional chains of linked metal centres. These chains can be considered as dimers [Ti2(BH4)6] being linked by Li, also via bidentate BH4 (η2). Pronounced aggregation of Ti(BH4)3 molecules has also been suggested to occur in the solid state for titanium borohydride implying that the predominant species is the dimer [Ti(BH4)3]2.20 Titanium borohydride rapidly decomposes at room temperature but has recently been stabilized through incorporation into a metal–organic framework (MOF).210

3.4 Bimetallic s-block borohydrides
The majority of the recently discovered bimetallic borohydrides consist of complex metal borohydride anions counter-balanced by alkali cations. In all these structures the more electronegative metal constitutes the central atom in the complex anion by coordination to a number of borohydride units, as for instance [Mg(BH4)4]2−. The formation of discrete complex anions can be considered as a consequence of the electronegativity difference between the two metals in the structures, which causes formation of partly covalent bonds between the more electronegative metal and the BH4 units. This contrasts bi-alkali metal borohydrides where the interaction is rather ionic. Series of bimetallic borohydrides have been discovered and are subdivided here in three groups, those based on s-block metals only, those based on a d- or f-block metals and typically an alkali metal and those based on a p-block metal and an alkali metal. This review focuses on series of compounds in order to aim at analyzing trends in structures and properties.

Bi-alkali metal borohydrides. 
The first bimetallic borohydride was discovered in 2008, lithium potassium borohydride, LiK(BH4)2, which has an ionic structure due to similarities in electronegativity of the two metals.130 Lithium and potassium coordinate to four and seven BH4 tetrahedra, respectively. The structure can be regarded as built from anionic layers [Li(BH4)2]− cut from an o-LiBH4 framework and intercalated by K+ cations. The decomposition temperature for this compound is nearly an average of those for the two individual borohydrides.
Sodium potassium borohydride, NaK(BH4)2, was initially described as a stoichiometric compound,211 but was later shown to be a solid solution NaxK1−xBH4, 0 < x < 1, stable in the temperature range 200 < T < 450 °C. The solid solution, NaxK1−xBH4, 0 < x < 1, is metastable at RT and phase-separates into the monometallic borohydrides at RT within 24 h.93


Lithium rubidium and lithium cesium borohydrides. 
The phase diagram LiBH4–ABH4 (A = Rb, Cs) has to date revealed ten compounds LiiAj(BH4)i+j (A = Rb, Cs), with i, j ranging between 1 and 3. Amongst these, eight new structure types of homoleptic borohydrides are found. The Li–BH4 substructure adopts various topologies as a function of the compound's Li content, ranging from one-dimensional isolated chains to three-dimensional networks. The coordination environment around the Li-node is either triangular or tetrahedral in these sublattices, and various compounds of this series contain the rare connectivity of edge-sharing Li(BH4)4-tetrahedra, following the building principle of LiKMg(BH4)4,172 where a charged, layered, honeycomb-like substructure LiMg(BH4)4− is charge-balanced by the larger K+ counter-cation. Such substructures may suggest that, next to Mg2+, Li+ may have potential to participate in framework building with the tetrahydroborate anion, BH4−, as a linker, if the framework is stabilized by large electropositive counter-cations.


Alkali and alkaline earth bimetallic borohydrides. 
No bimetallic borohydrides between Li or Na and Mg have been observed. This may be understood when considering the preferred coordination polyhedra of the different cations. (4,4)-Connected tetrahedral Li–Mg frameworks cannot form without countercations, i.e. other than as trimetallic borohydrides.172 Sodium cations are readily accommodated in octahedral coordination but do not adopt higher coordination numbers, which explains why the structural analogues to K–Mg borohydrides do not exist for sodium.
Two bimetallic potassium magnesium borohydrides have been discovered in the KBH4–Mg(BH4)2 system, namely K2Mg(BH4)4 and K3Mg(BH4)5.164 The structure of K2Mg(BH4)4 is isostructural to K2Mn(BH4)4 and built from distorted tetrahedral [Mg(BH4)4]2− complex anions. The BH4 anions share an edge with Mg (η2) similar to all polymorphs of Mg(BH4)2. Potassium ions form a K11 cage (Edshammar polyhedron) around the complex anions. Structural similarities for the series of isostructural bimetallic borohydrides K2M(BH4)4 (M = Mg, Mn, Zn, Cd) are discussed later in this section of the review.
The structure of K3Mg(BH4)5 is orthorhombic (P42bc) and has an intriguing nature that can be described as an intergrowth of KBH4 and K2Mg(BH4)4. Interestingly, the BH4 complexes occur in two different environments, forming complex anions [Mg(BH4)4]2− similar to those observed in the structure of K2Mg(BH4)4 and with a second boron position only coordinating to potassium. This latter BH4 is octahedrally coordinated, strongly resembling the local environment of BH4 in KBH4, which crystallizes in the rock salt structure as described in Section 3.1. The second component, building up the intergrowth of K3Mg(BH4)5, is a bicapped trigonal prism of K8, surrounding the composite anions of [Mg(BH4)4]2− and interconnected via common edges.164


Alkali metal calcium borohydrides. 
The heavier alkali metal borohydrides, MBH4, M = K, Rb and Cs, readily react with calcium borohydride and form perovskite-type metal borohydrides (Fig. 4).1,193 The compounds all have the same composition MCa(BH4)3, M = K, Rb, Cs, and each exists in at least two polymorphs, see Fig. 4. Furthermore, a perovskite type solid solution is also described, RbCaxMg1−x(BH4)3.1
 Fig. 4  Crystal structure of (a) the ordered room temperature polymorph of CsCa(BH4)3 and (b) of the modulated high temperature polymorph of RbCa(BH4)3. Ca (brown), Rb, Cs (blue), BH4 (green). 


Alkali metal strontium borohydrides. 
Alkali metal strontium borohydrides are also found to form perovskite-type compounds, MSr(BH4)3, M = K, Rb, Cs.165 The alkali-Ca and alkali-Sr borohydrides are the only two series where all three metal cations (K, Rb, Cs) stabilize the perovskite structure type. Interestingly, the Ca-compounds reveal decreasing symmetry across their high temperature polymorphic transitions.1 In contrast, the Sr-perovskites have increasing symmetry and the ambient temperature Sr-polymorphs are lower in symmetry than their Ca-analogues. This suggests that the Sr cation is too large to stabilize the ideal cubic perovskite type structure, and that the Ba-cation will come to lie outside the stability criteria of this structure type amongst borohydrides.

3.5 Bimetallic d- and f-block borohydrides

Alkali metal scandium borohydrides. 
The structure of LiSc(BH4)4 was the first bimetallic borohydride containing discrete anions to be characterized in 2008, while two other members of the series, NaSc(BH4)4 and KSc(BH4)4, were described in 2010 (Fig. 5).80,81,166 Mono-metallic scandium borohydride, Sc(BH4)3, has not yet been prepared nor structurally characterized. LiSc(BH4)4 is tetragonal (P2c),81 NaSc(BH4)4 is orthorhombic (Cmcm) with the HT-CrVO4 structure type and KSc(BH4)4 is also orthorhombic (Pnma) but with a BaSO4 type structure.80,166 Scandium–boron distances and B–Sc–B angles in the tetrahedral geometry of [Sc(BH4)4]− in NaSc(BH4)4 are relatively regular and resemble the almost ideal tetrahedral [Sc(BH4)4]− anion, found by DFT optimization.81 The [Sc(BH4)4]− anion is slightly distorted in KSc(BH4)4 and more deformed in the structure of LiSc(BH4)4. The Sc–B distances (2.27–2.50 Å) are similar in all three known alkali metal scandium borohydrides and compare well to those in the tetrahedral molecular compounds Zr(BH4)4 and Hf(BH4)4.19,109,126,127 In all three scandium-based compounds, the [Sc(BH4)4]− anion is located inside alkali metal cages, i.e. tetragonal Li8 prisms (all prisms occupied) in LiSc(BH4)4, slightly deformed trigonal Na6 prisms (each second prism occupied) in NaSc(BH4)4 and monocapped trigonal K7 prisms (all prisms occupied) in KSc(BH4)4. Note that the Li position is disordered along the c-axis in LiSc(BH4)4 and therefore the exact shape of the Li8 polyhedra cannot be determined. The primary building principle in NaSc(BH4)4 and KSc(BH4)4 consists of packing Na+/K+ cations and [Sc(BH4)4]− anions. The BH4 complex coordinates to Sc by edge sharing (η2) forming a dominantly covalent bond whereas alkali metal ions tend to coordinate to the complex anions with a dominantly ionic coordination.

Alkali metal yttrium borohydrides. 
Discrete complex [Y(BH4)4]− ions have been shown to exist in MY(BH4)4, produced by ball milling Y(BH4)3–3LiCl mixtures and MBH4 (M = K, Rb or Cs).167,171 KY(BH4)4 is isostructural to NaSc(BH4)4 (Cmcm),167 whereas RbY(BH4)4 and CsY(BH4)4 form unique structures.171 RbY(BH4)4 crystallizes in monoclinic unit cell (P21/c) with a AgMnO4 structure type, which is a deformation of the BaSO4-type structure. There are seven Rb+ cations located around each [Y(BH4)4]− and seven [Y(BH4)4]− anions around Rb+ forming slightly distorted monocapped trigonal prisms. CsY(BH4)4 is tetragonal (I41/a) with a CaWO4-scheelite structure type. Cs+ is surrounded by eight BH4 groups forming a distorted dodecahedron (snub disphenoid). While these structures were originally studied on chloride-containing samples, hence the solution of chloride on borohydride sites cannot be excluded, chlorine-free samples later allowed for additional analysis.78 It was found that KY(BH4)4 also crystallizes in a monoclinic (C2/c) structure with an octahedral coordination of Y, and RbY(BH4)4 crystallizes in the regular BaSO4 structure type. Double perovskites A3Y(BH4)6 (A = Rb, Cs) were also observed.1 Recently, also LiY(BH4)4 and NaY(BH4)4 have been prepared by thermal treatment and the two compounds were found to be isostructural to LiSc(BH4)4 and NaSc(BH4)4, respectively.62,161


Alkali metal manganese borohydrides. 
A bimetallic potassium manganese borohydride was synthesized in the KBH4–Mn(BH4)2 system, K2Mn(BH4)4, which is isostructural to K2Mg(BH4)4 and is indexed in a monoclinic cell as discussed above. Structural similarities between the series of isostructural bimetallic borohydrides K2M(BH4)4 (M = Mg, Mn, Cd) are discussed later in this section. The decomposition of K2Mn(BH4)4 has been shown to generate KBH4 and a new compound KMn(BH4)3 identified as a perovskite type metal borohydride.164 Later, the compound CsMn(BH4)3 (Cc) was also noticed to have the perovskite type structure.1


Alkali metal zinc borohydrides. 
Several alkali metal zinc borohydrides have been characterized in which zinc coordinates trigonally, in a planar fashion, to three BH4 units forming complex discrete anions, as for example MZn(BH4)3 (M = Na or K) containing [Zn(BH4)3]−.70,85 The Zn–BH4 (η2) coordination is significantly more directional and covalent in contrast to the alkali metal Na+ or K+ coordination. The trigonal coordination in [Zn(BH4)3]− anions in KZn(BH4)3 is more regular than those in NaZn(BH4)3. Interestingly, the Zn–B distance of 2.573 Å in KZn(BH4)3 is similar to the average of the three shortest Zn–B distances of 2.56 Å in NaZn(BH4)3. In both compounds the [Zn(BH4)3]− anions are located in Na8 or K8 cubes and the alkali cations coordinate to six BH4 units in a trigonal prism. However, the coordination of the BH4 unit by the cations differs in these two compounds, i.e. in NaZn(BH4)3 the BH4 units coordinate either almost linearly to one Na and one Zn atom, triangular planar to one Zn and two Na atoms or to one Zn and three Na atoms in a tetrahedral geometry, while in KZn(BH4)3 only the triangular coordination is observed.
The more zinc-rich alkali zinc borohydrides, MZn2(BH4)5 (M = Li or Na) also exhibit similar general structural topologies consisting of two identical interpenetrated three-dimensional frameworks.70,158 This type of structural topology is common for the coordination polymers involving organic ligands, such as MOFs,128 however observed for the first time in hydrides in this case. Alternatively, the structures of MZn2(BH4)5 (M = Li or Na) can be considered to be built from dinuclear complex ions, [Zn2(BH4)5]− and alkali metal ions. The MZn2(BH4)5 structures reveal strong and directional Zn–BH4 bonding by edge sharing (η2) that defines the structural architecture. The Zn atoms in both compounds have a triangular, nearly planar, coordination by three BH4 groups, similar to Zn in NaZn(BH4)3 and KZn(BH4)3. The Li and Na atoms in LiZn2(BH4)5 and NaZn2(BH4)5 have a saddle-like coordination to four BH4 units. All BH4 groups in the MZn2(BH4)5 structures are almost linearly coordinated by two metal atoms, either bridging the two zinc atoms in [Zn2(BH4)5]− or coordinating to one Zn and one M atom. Furthermore, LiZn2(BD4)5 has been studied by PND, revising the orientation of one of the BD4 groups, revealing that the coordination mode for the BD4 units to both Zn and Li corresponds to the cation⋯D2B (η2) coordination scheme,158 which is supported by DFT calculations.157


Alkali metal cadmium borohydrides. 
The potassium cadmium borohydride, KCd(BH4)3, has an interesting 3D polymeric framework topology and contains a complex anion, [Cd(BH4)3]nn− built from corner-sharing Cd(BH4)4 tetrahedra and Cd(BH4)6 octahedra. All six BH4 units in the [Cd(BH4)6] octahedra are coordinated almost linearly by another Cd atom from the neighbouring Cd(BH4)4 tetrahedra, whereas two of the four BH4 units within the [Cd(BH4)4] tetrahedra are terminal. The structure of KCd(BH4)3 can also be described as a garnet, with K on dodecahedral and octahedral sites, and Cd on octahedral and tetrahedral sites. In contrast, the structure of K2Cd(BH4)4 is built from discrete [Cd(BH4)4]2− anions counter-balanced by K+ cations. In the complex anion the Cd atom is coordinated to four BH4 units in a distorted tetrahedral geometry.146 The structure of K2Cd(BH4)4 resembles that of MSc(BH4)4 (M = Li, Na and K) and K2M(BH4)4 (M = Mg, Mn, Cd) as discussed below.


Electronic and size effects stabilizing tetrahedral complex anions based on bivalent metals. 
The compounds containing tetrahedral complex anions of the type [Mm+(BH4)4](4−m)− (m = 2, 3) are based either on a trivalent cation M such as Sc3+, Y3+, Al3+, Ho3+, Yb3+, Lu3+ or on a bivalent cation such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and have already been discussed. Alkali metals often act as counter-cations in these compounds and stabilise the composite anions with a metal center.
The compounds K2M(BH4)4 (M = Mg, Mn, Zn, Cd) all represent monoclinically distorted variants of β-K2SO4, i.e. M and BH4 occupying the S- and O-positions, respectively and thus replacing the sulphate tetrahedron by a complex anion [M(BH4)4]2−, with consistently bidentate bonding scheme M⋯H2B (η2). DFT calculations performed on K2M(BH4)4 (M = Mg),164 suggest high stability of the complex anion. DFT structural optimizations reveal that the inner B–H distances are longer than the outer ones, while the H–B–H angle is smaller on the BH4 edge facing the Mg metal centre.164 As discussed above, the coordination environment of [M(BH4)4]2− is best described as a pentacapped trigonal prism (Edshammar polyhedron, K11), The idealized MK11 building block is undistorted in the compound β-K2SO4.
Analysis of the relative interatomic distances K–B/M–B in the above mentioned compounds provides some insight to the structural differences caused by differences in metal Pauling electronegativity and ionic radii.164 A general trend shows that ‘the degree of isolation' (i.e. the extent to which the crystal should be described on the basis of the complex anion rationalization rather than a framework), as defined by the K-B/M-B ratio, decreases from 1.41 in the Mn compound to 1.11 in the Cd compound.
Interestingly, the volume of the MK11 cage, as well as the M–H bonding mode, remain nearly identical, within errors, in K2Mg(BH4)4 and K2Mn(BH4)4 while the volume of [M(BH4)4]2− varies significantly, i.e. 7.17 and 7.69 Å3 for Mn and Mg, respectively (Table 5). This contrasts the fact that the divalent manganese ion, r(Mn2+) = 0.80 Å is larger than magnesium r(Mg2+) = 0.71 Å. This is attributed to electronic effects, the electronegativity of Mn (1.55) being closer to that of BH4− (group electronegativity 2.13) than Mg (1.31), thus driving covalent bonding within the complex anion.212

Another compound containing an isolated tetrahedral complex anion is found in this system, K3Mg(BH4)5. Bidentate bonding is retained, while the isolation of [Mg(BH4)4]2− is increased to 1.45164 due to the larger coordination polyhedron K12. In this compound, an isolated BH4 not pertaining to the complex anion, is positionally and orientationally disordered. A repulsive interaction between this BH4 and the terminal ones of [Mg(BH4)4]2− takes place at higher temperatures, ∼87 °C, resulting in reorientation of [Mg(BH4)4]2− that in turn triggers a symmetry change. Perovskite-type KMn(BH4)3 forms as a reaction product in the K–Mn system. In the perovskite, Mn is no longer tetrahedrally coordinated, most likely due to enhanced thermal vibration and thus simulated size increase of the metal centre. This phase only exists at high temperatures, which supports this assumption.


Alkali rare-earth bimetallic borohydrides. 
Significant attention has been devoted to the synthesis and characterization of novel mono- and bimetallic rare-earth based metal borohydrides since the discovery of LiSc(BH4)4 and Y(BH4)3 in 2008.81,144 Rare-earth metal (RE) borohydrides of all rare-earth metals (with the exception of promethium) have been structurally, physically and chemically characterized and many trends in properties appear to follow the size of the rare-earth metal ions, see Table 6. In bimetallic RE-bearing compounds based on Li, the smaller elements: scandium, ytterbium and lutetium crystallize as LiRE(BH4)4, which are isostructural to LiSc(BH4)4, whereas the larger elements from lanthanum to samarium all form LiRE(BH4)3Cl compounds, which are discussed in Section 4.1. The moderately sized RE metals tend to crystallize with single cation structures similar to α- and β-Y(BH4)3. The most rich variation of structure types is observed for the stoichiometry ARE(BH4)4, where A is an alkali metal. Small and medium size RE form different structure types in this manner whilst the large RE do not form structures with this stoichiometry, but instead prefer to crystallize as double-perovskites with the formula A3RE(BH4)6. Different stoichiometries such as K2Gd(BH4)5 with square pyramidal and trigonal double pyramidal complex cations have also been observed. As for bivalent RE such as Sm2+, Eu2+ and Yb2+ they adopt the structures of alkali-earth borohydrides: the one of Sr(BH4)2 for the larger Sm2+ and Eu2+ whilst that of Ca(BH4)2 for the smaller Yb2+.

3.6 Bimetallic p-block borohydrides

Alkali p-block borohydrides. 
Mechanochemical treatment of AlCl3–LiBH4 and AlCl3–NaBH4 produce chloride containing alkali aluminium borohydrides Li4Al3(BH4)∼9Cl∼4 and NaAl(BH4)∼1Cl∼3, which are further discussed in Section 4.2.159,214 The chloride-free synthesis by the spontaneous reaction of aluminium borohydride with alkali borohydrides results in different structures that are, however, based on the same tetrahedral complex anion [Al(BH4)4]− with tridentate binding as seen in the chloride syntheses (with the exception of lithium).169,205 The reaction between LiBH4 and Al(BH4)3 produces a framework structure LiAl(BH4)4 with both cations tetrahedrally coordinated and resembling the framework of RT o-LiBH4. The sodium compound NaAl(BH4)4 crystallizes with a monoclinic structure that is a deformation of the orthorhombic type ht-CrVO4 also known for NaSc(BH4)4. Larger alkali metals K and Rb crystallize with the orthorhombic structure type of TbAsO4, observed for potassium for the first time.160 The larger CsAl(BH4)4 crystallizes with the CaWO4-scheelite type known from CsY(BH4)4. Cesium lead borohydride, CsPb(BH4)3, is hitherto the compound containing the most electronegative metal, χP = 1.8, which crystallizes with a perovskite type structure.1

3.7 Tri-metallic borohydrides

Trimetallic borohydrides with cation disorder. 
The first trimetallic homoleptic borohydride compounds, Li3MZn5(BH4)15, M = Mg and Mn, were presented in 2013 and are also new cationic solid solutions (see Table 4).83 The two compounds are isostructural and were structurally investigated using in situ SR-PXD and PND, which provides an average view of the structure as hexagonal, a = 15.371, and c = 8.586 Å, (P63/mcm) for the Mg-compound at RT. Interestingly, DFT optimization suggests locally ordered models in an ortho-hexagonal unit cell, which maximize Mg–Mg separation. Thus, the hexagonal structure observed by diffraction may be a superposition of three such orthorhombic structures in three orientations along the hexagonal c-axis. The framework in Li3MZn5(BH4)15 is of the mco-topological type, and contains channels built from face sharing [M(BH4)6] octahedra with triangularly coordinated lithium occupying the faces, and consists of two interpenetrated frameworks of tfa-type (Fig. 6). The framework type is related to bimetallic LiZn2(BH4)5 with cation disorder (Li/Mg) on the Li-position. The new borohydrides Li3MZn5(BH4)15 are potentially interesting as solid state electrolytes, if the lithium mobility within the octahedral channels is improved by disordering the site via heterovalent substitution. The two compounds decompose via formation of the more stable mono- and bimetallic borohydrides.83

A structural fragment with an ideal hexagonal symmetry in Li3MgZn5(BH4)15 and pseudo-hexagonal symmetry in LiZn2(BH4)5 is clearly visible and underlines the similarity of both structures built from similar frameworks. 


Alkaline earth alkali trimetallic borohydrides. 
The five trimetallic compounds ALiM(BH4)4 (A = K or Rb; M = Mg or Mn) and K3Li2Mg2(BH4)9 represent the first two-dimensional topologies amongst homoleptic borohydrides. The layered substructure is formed from negatively charged Li–Mg 4-connected networks (Fig. 7), which can be rationalized as a honeycomb-like sheet of edge- and corner-sharing tetrahedra. On their basis, the general chemistry of hypothetical, long sought-after, bimetallic Li–Mg borohydrides has been discussed and the results have been put into context with the end-members Mg(BH4)2 and LiBH4. The crystal structures of these trimetallic compounds reveal interesting structural relationships to aluminosilicates such as KAlSi3O8 (feldspar) and may be exploited by using them as precursors in an attempt to produce zeolite-like metal borohydrides, since zeolite contains three-dimensional negatively charged Al–Si–O networks, which could be rebuilt by their Li–Mg–BH4 analogues. The double-sheets found in K3Li2Mg2(BH4)9 of type [LiMg(BH4)4]− are fragments similar to the structure of β-Mg(BH4)2 and could provide a new route to design nanoporous open-structured materials with new host–guest adsorption properties.172

Double perovskite and garnet trimetallic borohydrides. 
Double perovskites LiA2M(BH4)6 have been observed for large alkali metals A = Rb, Cs and M = Y, Ce, Gd while the smaller alkali metal A = K stabilizes the garnet-type structure Li3K3M2(BH4)12 for M = La, Ce.168

3.8 General trends in the structural chemistry of metal borohydrides
Metals with increasing Pauling electronegativity have increasing degrees of directionality in the M–BH4 coordination, in particular alkaline earth and d-block metals, which mostly form framework structures. These structures may have unexpected structural topologies and contain interpenetrated frameworks or some degree of porosity. These metal borohydrides often exist as several polymorphs (metastable in a wide T range), with the extreme case of Mg(BH4)2 showing at least seven polymorphs. These observations highlight the structural flexibility mainly assigned to directionality and some degree of covalence in the M–BH4 interaction.
The majority of the bimetallic compounds containing an alkali metal and an alkaline earth metal, or a d-block metal, tend to form structures built from discrete composite complex anions formed by a metal and BH4, which is due to a significant difference in Pauling electronegativity. In all cases, the more electronegative metal coordinates relatively strongly to BH4 with a dominantly covalent interaction, while the less electronegative metal, usually an alkali, acts as a charge-balancing ion.
The number of BH4 complexes in the first coordination sphere of metals, in the structures of metal borohydrides, appears to correlate with the ionic radius of the metal, M. As expected, the number of BH4 complexes increases with the increasing cationic radius of the metal and the number varies from three to thirteen in o-RbY(BH4)4.193 In general, the M–BH4 distances also increase with increasing cationic radii of the metal. The number of BH4 units coordinating to the same metal vary as shown in Table 7.

3.9 Comparisons between metal borohydrides and metal oxides

Structural relationship between metal borohydrides and metal oxides. 
This section provides numerous examples of structural similarities of metal borohydrides and metal oxides, which has been reported recently.193 This similarity may be due to the fact that the tetrahydridoborate, BH4−, and the oxide, O2−, anions are isoelectronic, both carrying 10 electrons. However, the main reason is probably due to the fact that both borohydrides and oxides are ionocovalent compounds following similar rules on structure stability such as those dictated by the Pauling rules. The structural similarities are notable for β- and γ-Mg(BH4)2 where frameworks built from corner-sharing [Mg(BH4)4] tetrahedra are related to SiO2 structure types.188 Another polymorph, δ-Mg(BH4)2, was described as a Cu2O-type framework, i.e. as two interpenetrated β-cristobalite-type frameworks (cristobalite is a polymorph of SiO2). Analogous similarities between the polymorphs of α/α′-, β- and γ-Ca(BH4)2 and the TiO2 polymorphs anatase, rutile and brookite, respectively, were also described185 and are illustrated in Fig. 8. The similarities between borohydride and oxide structures reveal that the homoleptic solid metal borohydrides are, like oxides, structures with partly ionic and partly covalent bonding having different degrees of electron transfer between a metal cation and borohydride anion. Consequently, the Pauling rules215 can rationalize the crystal structures of borohydrides.216

Structural differences between metal borohydrides and oxides. 
There are differences between the coordination of borohydride, BH4−, and oxide, O2−, anions to metal cations, resulting in structural differences between metal borohydrides and oxides. The negative charge of the oxide O2− has twice the charge of the borohydride BH4−, which allows for more structural flexibility in oxides, e.g. incorporation of metal ions with mixed oxidation states. This can lead to charge-ordering related phenomena such as magnetism or ferroelectricity. The oxide anion also contains electron lone pairs, which decrease the sphericity in case of coordination numbers lower than four. In contrast, the borohydride anion has a more pronounced non-spherical tetrahedral shape. Therefore, metal borohydride crystal structures often have lower symmetry when compared to the symmetry of the related oxides.
Furthermore, the borohydride anion is rather large r(BH4−) = 2.03 Å,19,217 being nearly twice as large as the radius of oxide anion r(O2−) = 1.24 or 1.28 Å for tetrahedral or octahedral coordination, respectively. As a consequence, the charge density of the oxide ion is more than eight times larger than that of the borohydride ion. Secondly, the Pauling electronegativity is 3.44 for oxygen and only 2.13 (group electronegativity)212 for the borohydride anion. This illustrates that the BH4− anion is more reducing than O2−. Therefore, stable oxides are often formed by metal ions with a high oxidation state, small radius and, thus, high charge density. This section shows that the opposite is valid for the metal borohydrides, which are often formed by the larger metal ions with lower oxidation state and lower charge density, e.g. potassium tetraoxoferrate(VI), K2FeO4 (Fe6+, d0), is stable at RT whereas Fe(BH4)2 (Fe2+, d6) exists in solution at T < −30 °C, or stabilized with ammonia at RT as [Fe(NH3)6](BH4)2.94 Structures of metal oxides are often considered as a close packing of anions with cations filling octahedral or tetrahedral sites. This structural view holds less convincingly for the metal borohydrides, which often have a structural packing deviating significantly from the close packing of anions. This may be ascribed to higher ‘softness’ and polarizability, which introduces more directionality and covalence in the M–BH4 bonding compared to metal oxides.218


Role of H−⋯H− interactions. 
The repulsive H−⋯H− interaction between neighbouring borohydride groups is another structure-determining parameter. The Switendick limit of 2.1 Å for a minimal H⋯H distance known from metallic hydrides also seems to hold approximately for borohydrides. An illustrative example of the role of the repulsive H⋯H interaction is the RT to HT polymorphic transition from α- to β-Y(BH4)3. While the RT polymorph allows for more dense packing, three H⋯H distances around each Y are close to Switendick limit of 2.1 Å. The HT β-polymorph is less dense, and by reorientation of three out of six borohydrides in the Y coordination, the shortest H⋯H distance becomes 2.6 Å (Fig. 2). Interestingly, DFT calculations suggest the HT phase to be the ground state, indicating the overestimation of the H⋯H repulsion in the calculation. In ReO3, the oxide equivalent of Y(BH4)3 is indeed the equivalent to β-Y(BH4)3, and the oxide equivalent to the RT α-Y(BH4)3 is obtained by applying the pressure. The flipping of three borohydride groups also straightens the Y–BH4–Y bridges in the HT-polymorph, which allows maximizing the H⋯H distances. A similar behaviour was observed for α- and β-Cd(BH4)2 with a tetrahedral coordination of Cd. While the RT-polymorph is a distorted anti-Cu2O-type structure, the HT-polymorph crystallizes in the regular cubic anti-Cu2O type. Whether the flipping of BH4 groups is at the origin of this phase transformation remains controversial, since the hydrogen positions have not been reliably determined. The repulsive Hδ−⋯Hδ− interaction is also likely at the origin of the pressure-induced phase transitions in Mg(BH4)2 and Mn(BH4)2. These compounds change their structure with pressure from a more porous α- to more dense δ- or δ′-polymorphs, which are also deformation variants of anti-Cu2O-type.
The repulsive Hδ−⋯Hδ− interactions are naturally expected to be more pronounced for higher partial hydrogen charges, δ. Indeed, δ varies from −0.86 in o-LiBH4175 (and even closer to −1 for heavier alkali metals) to values much closer to zero for more covalent borohydrides such as Mg(BH4)2, where only a partial charge transfer occurs from the metal cation to the BH4 anion. The limiting case is Cd(BH4)2, as Cd is the most electropositive metal forming a borohydride at ambient conditions without stabilization by alkali metal ions. The deformations of the Cu2O-antitype Mg(BH4)2 and Cd(BH4)2 with pressure and temperature3,146 is determined by H⋯H interactions driven by different values of δ, as well as by different radii of the metal atoms. Thus, the strength of the repulsive H⋯H interactions depend on the charge transfer from the counter ion and this influences the stability of some polymorphs.

4. Structure of anion substituted metal borohydrides
Metal borohydrides have diverse compositions and rich and fascinating structural chemistry, as discussed in the previous section of this review. The metal borohydrides have been mainly prepared mechanochemically during the past decade, which often produced a variety of metal borohydride halides. Halide substitution in metal borohydrides is a valuable approach for tailoring physical and chemical properties. Metal borohydride halides have either fully ordered, partly ordered or disordered structures (Fig. 9 and Table 8), which is the major focus of this section. Another class of anion substituted metal borohydrides contains both the borohydride, BH4−, and the amide, NH2−, anions. These boron–nitrogen compounds are also investigated intensively due to their hydrogen storage and ion conductivity properties. In cases where metal borohydrides are contaminated by oxygen containing impurities, e.g. water or solvents, they may partly decompose to metal borohydride borates, BO33−. Recently, borohydride closo-boranes, i.e. B12H122−, were discovered to host fast ion conduction. These new classes of materials, metal borohydride amides, borates and closo-boranes are discussed in the last part of this section.

4.1 Metal borohydride halides – fully ordered structures
Strontium borohydride chloride, Sr(BH4)Cl, is a stoichiometric, ordered compound, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system at RT (Pnma) with the structure type of Sr(OH)2.142

Potassium zinc borohydride chloride. 
The first mixed-anion mixed-cation borohydride, KZn(BH4)Cl2, characterized in 2010,84 has a structure with crystallographic sites fully occupied by BH4− or chloride anions and consists of isolated heteroleptic [Zn(BH4)Cl2]− anions charge balanced by K+ cations. The [Zn(BH4)Cl2]− anion is built from Zn in a trigonal-planar orientation to two Cl atoms and one BH4 unit, similar to zinc in the structures of NaZn(BH4)3 and KZn(BH4)3. The BH4− complex coordinates to Zn by edge sharing (η2), which then has coordination number four, CN(Zn) = 4. The potassium atom has an unusual coordination number of eight, with a distorted square antiprismatic coordination, formed by five Cl atoms and three BH4 groups. In agreement with the high coordination number of K, the K–Cl (3.159–3.66 Å) and K–B (3.274–3.781 Å) distances in KZn(BH4)Cl2 are slightly longer than in KCl (3.130 Å)229 and KBH4 (3.364 Å),230 where the K+ ion has an octahedral environment coordinated by six Cl− or BH4−, respectively. This coordination difference underlines that the structure is not directly related to that of KBH4 and cannot be considered a simple composite of the starting materials.


Lithium rare-earth metal borohydride chlorides. 
A series of alkali rare-earth metal borohydride chlorides with fully anion-ordered structures, LiRE(BH4)3Cl, RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm or Gd crystallize in cubic unit cells with space group symmetry I3m.4,88,147,219 A combination of X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD), neutron diffraction (PND) and density functional theory (DFT) optimization of structural models reveals that the structure contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters [RE4Cl4(BH4)12]4− with a distorted cubane-like RE4Cl4 core, known from coordination chemistry.231 The complex anions [RE4Cl4(BH4)12]4− are charge balanced by discrete Li+ ions.4 Each rare-earth metal atom, RE, coordinates to three chloride ions and three borohydride groups forming an octahedron, but the BH4− tetrahedra coordinates to the large rare-earth ions by face sharing (η3). Li+ ions are disordered, occupying 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoff site, leading to fast lithium ion conduction,4 further discussed in Section 7. DFT calculations indicate that the structure of LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized by entropy, in accordance with the disorder on Li+ positions.4,88 This complicated structure type, containing both light and heavy atoms, could not be resolved by any two of the three methods, SR-PXD, PND and DFT calculations, and it was only possible to solve with the combined use of all three methods.4,88 Alternatively, the structure may be rationalized from the borohydride-oxide similarity (Section 3.9) as derived from spinel. If the anions, BH4− or Cl−, are considered to be close packed then rare-earth metals occupy the octahedral sites, and lithium atoms occupy the tetrahedral sites (similar to those in spinel, but in a ratio 1:1 instead of 2:1 as in spinels).

4.2 Metal borohydride halides – partly ordered structures

Barium borohydride chloride. 
Mechanochemical treatment of LiBH4–BaCl2 in molar ratios 1:1 and 2:1 produces two new barium borohydride chlorides with different structures.220 An orthorhombic chloride-rich compound, o-Ba(BH4)0.16Cl1.84, is obtained using the reactant ratio 1:1 and a borohydride-rich hexagonal compound, h-Ba(BH4)0.85Cl1.15, using molar ratio 2:1. The structures of o-Ba(BH4)0.16Cl1.84 and h-Ba(BH4)0.85Cl1.15 were described on the basis of SR-PXD data using Rietveld refinement and structural similarities to orthorhombic barium chloride, o-BaCl2 (Pnma)232 and the hexagonal high temperature barium chloride polymorph, h-BaCl2 (P2m),233 respectively. Boron and chlorine atoms occupy the two Cl positions in the BaCl2 polymorphs with the overall occupancy of B and Cl constrained to one. A third anion position in each structure, o-Ba(BH4)0.16Cl1.84 and h-Ba(BH4)0.85Cl1.15, can be regarded as BH4-free.


Sodium yttrium borohydride chloride. 
Mechanochemical synthesis produces a mixed-cation mixed-anion borohydride chloride with the ideal composition NaY(BH4)2Cl2.87,167 The compound crystallizes in a polymeric pseudo-orthorhombic unit cell (P2/c), only slightly distorted from the orthorhombic metrics (with β = 90°).87,167
However, Rietveld refinements suggest some Cl-substitution on the BH4 site, resulting in a partly ordered structure with the composition, NaY(BH4)2−xCl2+x with x = 0.21 at RT.87 Interestingly, both experimental and theoretical results reveal two anion sites with different sizes in the structural model. The BH4− anions clearly have a preference for the larger of the two sites, whereas the chloride anion prefers the smaller, due to the size difference of the two anions, r(Cl−) = 1.81 and r(BH4−) = 2.03 Å. Both the yttrium and sodium atoms in NaY(BH4)2Cl2 have slightly distorted octahedral coordination environments consisting of two BH4 sites and four Cl atoms for yttrium (i.e. Y(BH4)2Cl4) and two Cl atoms and four BH4 sites for sodium atoms (i.e. Na(BH4)4Cl2). DFT optimization of the experimental structure and Raman spectroscopy suggests that the BH4 units coordinate by face-sharing (η3) towards yttrium and by a combination of edge and face-sharing to sodium.87
The existence of one larger and one smaller anionic site is analogous to oxides. The structure of NaY(BH4)2Cl2 is related to MgWO4, which again is a cation substitution variant of the α-PbO2 structure. The latter is the structure type observed for Sr(BH4)2. There is only one anion site in α-PbO2 but two in MgWO4 with different sizes due to the size difference of the cations, Mg2+ and W6+. Interestingly, the cations' coordination number increases from six to seven for the borohydride free compound NaYCl4. However, the triclinic structure of NaYCl4 has similar packing and connectivity of the cation coordination polyhedra as observed for the MgWO4 and NaY(BH4)2Cl2 type structures.


Lithium aluminum borohydride chloride. 
The first example of a bimetallic borohydride based on s- and p-block metals has the ideal composition Li4Al3(BH4)13.159 The structure is built from cationic, [(BH4)Li4]3+ and a anionic, [Al(BH4)4]−, complexes. However, these units are not isolated, i.e. the Li–B distances within [(BH4)Li4]3+ and between the Li atom and B within [Al(BH4)4]− are similar. Hence this structure can be described as a 3D framework. On the other hand, the structure of Li4Al3(BH4)13 can be related to that of the anti-Cr3Si type, by rationalizing it as close packing of complex anions and cations. Detailed structural analysis reveals chloride substitution mainly in the anion-centered complex, [(BH4)Li4]3+, providing Li–Cl coordination similar to that observed in LiBH4–LiCl solid solutions (see Section 4.4.1).9,234 Rietveld refinements of SR-PXD data measured for AlCl3–LiBH4 1:4 and 1:5 samples reveal the presence of ∼27 mol% and ∼46 mol% chloride anions in the compositions Li4Al3(BH4)∼9.8Cl∼3.2 and Li4Al3(BH4)∼7.5Cl∼5.5.


Sodium aluminum borohydride chloride. 
NaAl(BH4)xCl4−x with a partly ordered orthorhombic (Pmn21) structure is also described. The highest yield of NaAl(BH4)xCl4−x, ∼86 mol% together with NaAlCl4, ∼14 mol%, was obtained by mechanochemical treatment of a AlCl3–NaBH4 1:1.214 The structure consists of one Na, one Al, one Cl and two BH4 sites. There is no indication of any borohydride substitution on the general position occupied by Cl. The borohydride anions appear to prefer two sites with higher local symmetry on the mirror plane. However, Rietveld refinement indicates Cl-substitution on the BH4 site. The structure contains complex tetrahedral anions of [Al(BH4)xCl4−x]−, which form in a relatively narrow composition range 1 < x < 1.43, counter balanced by Na+ cations. The highest borohydride content (x = 1.43) is obtained from a sample with composition AlCl3–NaBH4 1:3 with relative anion occupancies BH4−/Cl− 0.82/0.18 and 0.61/0.39 on each boron site.159,214
Contrary to the complex anions [M(BH4)4]− (M = Mg, Sc, Mn, Cd), [Zn(BH4)3]− and [Zn2(BH4)5]− the complex anion [Al(BH4)4]− appears to be more difficult to stabilize (see the discussion in Section 3.5), requiring a certain extent of partial substitution of BH4− units by the smaller Cl− ligand.214

4.3 Metal borohydride halides – fully disordered structures
Compounds with fully disordered anion positions in the structures have statistical distributions of BH4 and the heavier halide anion on all anionic sites. The section after this one, 4.4, is devoted to compounds, which may be classified as solid solutions of two compounds.

Potassium zinc borohydride chloride. 
A fully disordered monoclinic bimetallic borohydride chloride, K2Zn(BH4)xCl4−x (P21/n) has been identified where all four anionic sites are partly occupied by BH4− and Cl−.85 The structure of K2Zn(BH4)xCl4−x consists of [Zn(BH4)xCl4−x]2− anions with Zn coordinating to four BH4/Cl groups, forming a somewhat distorted tetrahedron. The compound K2Zn(BH4)xCl4−x is isostructural to the series of bimetallic borohydrides K2M(BH4)4, M = Mg, Mn, Cd, discussed in Section 3.5.
In fact, K2Zn(BH4)xCl4−x is a monoclinic distortion of the high temperature K2ZnCl4 polymorph observed at T > 315 °C with a K2SO4 type structure (Pnma).235 Interestingly, the volume per formula unit (V/Z) for K2Zn(BH4)1.47Cl2.53 measured at RT is almost identical to that of the high temperature polymorph of K2ZnCl4 at 315 °C. This indicates that the unit cell volume expansion caused by the incorporation of BH4 is similar to the thermal expansion causing the polymorphic phase transformation from the RT polymorph of K2ZnCl4 (Pna21) to the high temperature polymorph (Pnma).
K3Zn(BH4)xCl5−x is formed after prolonged ball milling of KBH4–ZnCl2 (2:1).85 The structure is not fully characterized but may crystallize in the tetragonal space group P42/mbc and contains the complex anion [Zn(BH4)xCl4−x]2− making it a substitutional and deformation variant of the tetragonal (I4/mcm) Cs3CoCl5 structure type.


Lithium ytterbium borohydride chloride. 
The compound LiYb(BH4)4−xClx can also be formed, which crystallizes in a primitive tetragonal structure with x ∼ 1.0 (P2c), which is isostructural to LiSc(BH4)4.81,150 During heating, ytterbium is also reduced, similar to samarium borohydrides, forming Yb(BH4)2−xClx. This compound exists with two different compositions depending on both temperature and synthesis conditions. Yb(BH4)2−xClx, x = 0.76, crystallizes in a primitive tetragonal unit cell (P), whilst Yb(BH4)2−xClx, x = 0.3, crystallizes in a primitive orthorhombic unit cell (Pbca).150

4.4 Metal borohydride halides forming solid solutions
Compounds with statistically distributed anions in their structures are denoted fully disordered and may be classified as solid solutions of two compounds. This will be further discussed in the following section. Anion substitution is a method for tailoring the properties of known metal borohydrides.8 Substitution of BH4− or H− by anions with the same charge and comparable size may lead to formation of solid solutions (see Table 9). The first part of this subsection is devoted to investigations regarding substitution of the BH4− complex anion with the heavier halides, Cl−, Br− or I−. Fluorine substitution has also been attempted, which is discussed in the end of this section, see Section 4.4.2.

In some cases, full solubility between a metal borohydride and the halide salt can be observed, e.g. Na(BH4)1−xClx. General rules for anion substitution are derived from the numerous examples presented in the following section and are described in the end of this section.

4.4.1. Metal borohydride halides, the s-block. 
Lithium borohydride–lithium chloride. 
Initially, anion substitution was observed by in situ diffraction experiments during heating a sample of LiBH4–LiCl 0.85:0.15.9 Diffraction data suggest that solid LiCl dissolves into the structure of the solid hexagonal polymorph, h-LiBH4, at T > 110 °C, obtaining a maximum chlorine substitution of 42 mol%, i.e. h-Li(BH4)0.58Cl0.42.234 The hexagonal solid solution, h-Li(BH4)0.58Cl0.42, obtained using thermal treatment is stable upon cooling to RT, however slow segregation of LiCl is observed and o-Li(BH4)0.91Cl0.09 is obtained after several months.9,234,237 The mechanism for anion substitution in the system LiBH4–LiCl is described in reaction scheme (4.1), i.e. one solid, LiCl, dissolves in another solid, LiBH4. xLiCl + (1 − x)LiBH4 → Li(BH4)1−xClx(4.1)
Lithium borohydride–lithium bromide. 
The mechanism for anion substitution in LiBH4–LiBr, facilitated by mechanochemical or thermal treatment, has been investigated by in situ SR-PXD and the formation of two solid solutions is observed.86 Mechanochemical treatment, or just hand mixing, of a sample of LiBH4–LiBr leads to formation of a hexagonal solid solution h-Li(BH4)1−xBrx with a unit cell volume similar to β-LiBr. This indicates that the first step in the anion substitution process is a dissolution of small amounts of LiBH4 into α-LiBr (β-LiBr and h-LiBH4 are isostructural). Heating the sample to elevated temperatures, T > 112 °C, also enables dissolution of LiBr in h-LiBH4 forming a lithium borohydride rich solid solution with unit cell volume similar to LiBH4. Two solid solutions can be observed at T > 112 °C and the dissolution process is further accelerated resulting in a single solid solution at elevated temperatures and full solubility in the system LiBH4–LiBr.86 Cooling such a solid solution of h-Li(BH4)1−xBrx should finally lead to crystallization of α-LiBr, o-Li(BH4)1−xBrx and/or a hexagonal solid solution h-Li(BH4)1−xBrx. The composition of the solid solution h-Li(BH4)1−xBrx appears to remain constant (x ∼ 0.5) upon storage at RT for several months, but α-LiBr and presumably amorphous o-LiBH4 are slowly segregated. Bromide substitution stabilizes the hexagonal structure of LiBH4 to RT as a solid solution with composition h-Li(BH4)0.5Br0.5.86
Lithium borohydride–lithium iodide. 
Solid solutions of Li(BH4)1−xIx have been obtained by reacting LiBH4 with α-LiI.221 The substitution process can be induced either by heat treatment at T ∼ 245 °C or by mechanochemical treatment. In situ SR-PXD has demonstrated that anion substitution initially forms two solid solutions, which at elevated temperatures merge into one containing up to 62 mol% LiI. Two solid solutions may occur due to substitution of I− for BH4− in LiBH4 and substitution of BH4− for I− in LiI. The structures of the two solid solutions are identical to the hexagonal structures of h-LiBH4 and β-LiI. The solid solutions of Li(BH4)1−xIx have a broader stability range (from RT to the melting at 330 °C) compared to that of both h-LiBH4 and β-LiI.221
Sodium borohydride–sodium chloride. 
The mechanism for anion substitution, facilitated by annealing, was investigated by in situ SR-PXD during three consecutive cycles of heating to 300 °C, annealing for 30 min and cooling to RT for a sample of NaBH4–NaCl (1:1), see Fig. 10.222 The unit cell volume of NaCl increases and decreases linearly due to thermal expansion and contraction, respectively (linear thermal expansion coefficients, α(NaCl) = 2.562 × 10−4 K−1 for T = 32–300 °C). No changes are observed in the unit cell volume of NaCl before and after the three annealing cycles, i.e. no dissolution of NaBH4 into NaCl takes place during the short time of the experiment (only 90 min at 300 °C).
 Fig. 10  
In situ SR-PXD data for BM NaBH4–NaCl (1:1) heated from RT–300 °C, kept at 300 °C for 30 min, cooled from 300–30 °C (ΔT/Δt = 10 °C min−1). This is repeated by three cycles. Symbols:  NaCl,  NaBH4 and ○ NaBO2 (λ = 1.072 Å). Adapted with permission from ref. 222. Copyright 2011 Elsevier. 
At T ∼ 240 °C the unit cell volume of Na(BH4)1−xClx decreases rapidly and continues to do so for approximately 20 min. On this time scale the unit cell parameter is found to decrease from 6.2099–6.1295 Å, while the degree of substitution, x changes from approximately 0.15 to 0.50. During the second and third annealing periods at T = 300 °C the unit cell volume of Na(BH4)1−xClx decreases linearly due to anion substitution. Furthermore, the fact that the decrease in unit cell volume of Na(BH4)1−xClx is linear upon cooling suggests that NaCl does not segregate from NaBH4 on the time scale of the experiment and the final composition is found to be Na(BH4)0.43Cl0.57.222
Dissolution of 10 mol% NaCl into NaBH4, forming Na(BH4)0.9Cl0.1, takes place during relatively mild ball milling, i.e. 60 × 2 min with 2 min breaks to restrict sample heating (total BM time 120 min). A higher degree of dissolution of NaCl into NaBH4 is obtained by more harsh BM (e.g. 24 h) in some cases combined with sample heating by the reaction heat from decomposition of metal borohydrides. These investigations suggest full solubility in the system NaBH4–NaCl, i.e. one solid solution.71,72 This is expected because NaCl and NaBH4 are both isomorphous. Investigations reveal a linear correlation between the compositions of the solid solutions and the unit cell volume, in agreement with Vegard's law.71,72,222 Chlorine substitution for the larger iodide anion also occurs readily and stoichiometrically during relatively mild ball milling.
Potassium borohydride–potassium chloride. 
Anion substitution in potassium borohydride has been observed during the decomposition of KSc(BH4)4.166 The mechanochemically produced sample originally contained the three compounds: KSc(BH4)4, K3ScCl6, and KBH4. The amount of KBH4 increases during the decomposition of KSc(BH4)4 in the temperature range 150 to 230 °C and further reacts with K3ScCl6 at T > 230 °C. The reaction is observed as a continuous change in the position of KBH4 diffraction peaks toward higher 2θ values, i.e., the unit cell of KBH4 contracts upon heating. This suggests two simultaneous and coupled chemical reactions taking place. (a) The ternary chloride K3ScCl6 reacts with KBH4 to form potassium chloride, KCl, and possibly also amorphous scandium borides, boron, and/or higher boranes and (b) simultaneously, KCl dissolves in the remaining KBH4 and forms a solid solution K(BH4)1−xClx with increasing amounts of KCl, see reaction scheme (4.2). (1 − x)KBH4 + xKCl → K(BH4)1−xClx(4.2)
Magnesium borohydride–magnesium halide. 
Anion substitution in Mg(BH4)2 is observed after annealing a milled mixture of α-Mg(BH4)2–MgX2 (X = Cl or Br). The substitution is identified from the shift of Bragg peaks from α- to β-Mg(BH4)2, i.e. anion substitution only occurs in the β-Mg(BH4)2 polymorph.225 Structure refinement revealed that unit cell parameters decreased by about 0.1–0.2 Å for β-Mg(BH4)2 in the mixtures, which corresponds to a volume contraction of the unit cell of about 2%. A combined experimental and theoretical approach for the Cl substitution in Mg(BH4)2 has shown that the enthalpy gain is more favourable for the β-solid solution than for the α-solid solution.225
Calcium borohydride–calcium chloride and bromide. 
Halide substitution in Ca(BH4)2–CaCl2 and Ca(BH4)2–CaBr2 was also investigated.226,227 Chlorine substitution was not observed after BM of the samples but readily occurs after the transition from α- to β-Ca(BH4)2 upon heating above ∼250 °C. Rietveld analysis of the obtained β-Ca(BH4)1−xClx phases indicates compositions from x = 0.3 to 0.7 depending on the amount of CaCl2 in the mixtures. No anion substitution with CaF2 or CaBr2 is observed.226
Calcium borohydride–calcium iodide. 
Anion substitution in the system Ca(BH4)2–CaI2 resulted in the formation of three new compounds, which are solid solutions with BH4− and I− anions sharing the same positions in the structures.228 Sample preparation methods have a significant influence on the reaction pathway. Mechanochemical synthesis (ball milling) mediates a significant degree of dissolution of Ca(BH4)2 into CaI2 (∼70 mol%) yielding a CaI2-type trigonal solid solution, tri-Ca((BH4)1−xIx)2 (x ∼ 0.7). Upon heating, tri-Ca((BH4)0.7I0.3)2 transforms to a CaCl2-type orthorhombic structure, o-Ca((BH4)1−xIx)2 (x ∼ 0.3), which is structurally related to β-Ca(BH4)2. Upon further heating (at 335 °C), the sample partly transforms to a more iodide-rich tetragonal solid solution, tet-Ca((BH4)1−xIx)2 (x ∼ 0.6), with a novel structure type. This compound decomposes to CaHI and CaB6 (at T > 345 °C). Apparently, minor amounts of CaI2 also dissolve into β-Ca(BH4)2 forming a solid solution, which is structurally similar to o-Ca((BH4)1−xIx)2, i.e. β-Ca((BH4)1−xIx)2 with x ∼ 0.05.228


4.4.2 Fluoride substitution in metal borohydrides. 
The smaller halide ion, F− (1.33 Å), has a similar size to the hydride ion, H− (1.40 Å) and metal hydrides and fluorides share many properties, e.g. the ionic compounds are often found to be isostructural. This suggests that hydrogen and fluorine may substitute for each other in both ionic and covalently bonded compounds. The most significant difference between the two lies in the electronegativity, which is 2.1 and 4.0 for hydrogen and fluorine, respectively. Therefore, fluorine substitution is expected to lead to significant thermodynamic changes in metal hydrides. The first fluorine-substituted complex hydride was prepared by hydrogenation of the system NaF–Al–H2, which yielded the complex hydride Na3AlH6−xFx, i.e. fluoride substitution of the complex anion [AlH6−xFx]3−.238,239 The substitution of fluorine into NaMgH3, forming NaMgH2F, has been shown to stabilize the structure and increase the enthalpy of hydrogen absorption/desorption, a desirable property for concentrating solar thermal energy storage applications.240
Fluoride substitution in the BH4− complex anion, i.e. H− → F−, is also possible. The system NaBH4–NaBF4 provided the first fluorine substituted borohydride, NaBH2.1F1.9, observed in a narrow temperature range of 200 to 215 °C by SR-PXD.223 However, the obtained materials MB(H1−xFx)4 appear to have relatively low thermal stability and the released hydrogen can be contaminated with significant amounts of boronfluorides and/or borane gases and may lead to the formation of significant amounts of unwanted M2B12H12.223,241 The system KBH4–KBF4 was investigated by solid state 11B and 19F NMR, which appear more consistent with a statistical distribution of fluorine substituted [B(H,F)4]− tetrahedra rather than a mix of discreet BH4− and BF4− tetrahedra.224
Hydrogen substitution by fluorine in orthorhombic o-LiBH4 has been investigated with quantum-mechanics calculations aiming to describe thermodynamic properties of LiB(H,F)4 for hydrogen storage applications. Excess enthalpies of the mixed compounds were computed, suggesting that fluorine atoms tend to agglomerate on the same boron atoms rather than be homogeneously dispersed over all the available BH4 tetrahedra.242 These data show that, at room temperature, the formation of solid solutions between lithium borohydride and borofluoride is thermodynamically unfavoured, so the fluorine substitution destabilizes the pure hydride.242
A number of reactive hydride composites (further discussed in Section 6.8) containing metal fluorides have been successfully hydrogenated and in some cases cycled with hydrogen release and uptake, (CaH2/CaF2)–MgB2,243,244 Mg–LiBH4 composites catalysed by FeF3,245 LiH–LiF–MgB2 system,246,247 and Ca(BH4)2–MgF2.248–250 A drawback is the high stability of both ionic metal fluorides MF and molecular covalent borontrifluoride, BF3.

4.5 General trends for halide substitution in metal borohydrides

Metal borohydrides and the heavier halides. 
The above Section 4.4 provides a range of examples of halide substitution in stable monometallic alkali and alkaline earth metal borohydrides and some trends in the structural chemistry of anion substitution are observed. Anion substitution by the heavier halides, i.e. Cl−, Br− or I−, of borohydrides:
(i) The solid containing the smaller anion tends to dissolve into the compound containing the larger anion, and the structure of the latter tends to be preserved in the obtained solid solution. This trend can be interpreted as a contraction of the structure providing shorter average bond lengths and therefore larger lattice energy.
(ii) Some polymorphs of metal borohydrides are more prone to perform anion substitution than others. This effect is illustrated by the high temperature polymorphs, e.g. h-LiBH4, β-Mg(BH4)2 and β-Ca(BH4)2, which more readily dissolve solid metal halides into their structures. Investigations using diffraction and solid state MAS NMR reveal that anion substitution is facilitated by structural dynamics and an orientational disorder, i.e. entropy effects, in particular related to the BH4 unit, which possibly make the BH4 tetrahedra appear more spherical and similar to halides.177,251
(iii) In the case where the metal borohydride and the metal halide are isostructural, anion substitution may occur in both compounds, which can lead to two solid solutions. This effect is observed during moderate heat treatment of mechanochemically treated mixtures of various borohydrides and halides, leading to two solid solutions and indicating non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, mechanochemical treatment facilitates formation of the solid solution with volume contraction and moderate heat treatment may facilitate formation of the solid solution with larger volume, as compared to the parent compound, due to thermal expansion. Such binary solid solutions tend to merge to a single solid solution after prolonged heating, i.e. a solid solution exists in the full concentration range at higher temperatures (and can be quenched to RT). This is observed for LiBH4–LiBr, LiBH4–LiI and NaBH4–NaCl systems, and notice that β-LiBr, β-LiI and h-LiBH4 and also NaBH4 and NaCl are isostructural.
Reactions during mechanochemical treatment appear to be promoted by elevated pressure, i.e. by compression of materials, therefore all anion substitutions obtained by BM appear to follow (i). In contrast, thermal treatment (annealing) tends to facilitate increased mobility, e.g. of BH4−, and thermal expansion of the structures. Therefore, initially rule (i) appears to be violated in cases where (iii) is valid, but prolonged heating will eventually lead to chemical equilibrium and appear to follow (i), i.e. two solid solutions tend to merge to one. In the cases where anion substitution occurs at elevated temperature (ii) the high temperature polymorph is often stabilised to lower temperatures. Here the dissolution of a metal halide at elevated temperatures appears to be a fast process but segregation of the metal halide at lower temperatures is often a slower process.
Thus, in conclusion, anion substitution and anion disorder is a well-known property of metal borohydrides that has been exploited to tailor hydrogen release properties, and more recently to develop ionic conductors. Cation disorder, on the other hand, has not been observed very often, with some examples being, Mn1−xMgx(BH4)2, and Li3MZn5(BH4)15, M = Mg and Mn.65,83 Only very recently have some researchers started to consider the functional design of physical properties by means of cation substitution, which in turn is the most dominant tool to tailor transition metal oxides. Cation disorder may occur for structures containing very large anions dominating structural organization,4 or when the cations are very similar in size, such as for Mg2+ and Mn2+ with identical charge and similar ionic radius, r(Mg2+) = 0.71 and r(Mn2+) = 0.80 Å.65 However, cation substitution can also occur for cations that have the same preferred coordination sphere such as Li+ and Mg2+ that both prefer tetrahedral coordination. Therefore the tri-metallic compound Li3MZn5(BH4)15, M = Mg and Mn may be considered as being derived from the bimetallic compound LiZn2(BH4)5 by Li–Mg cation substitution.83
Fluorine substitution in hydridocomplexes is clearly possible, however the stability of the produced compounds is limited due to the formation of very stable ionic solids or molecular gases. The system Na–Al–F–H can provide the complex Na3AlH6−xFx, which has a strong tendency to form fully fluorine substituted octahedral complexes [AlF6]3−.238 Recall the composition of the rather stable mineral cryolite, Na3AlF6. The metal borohydride–borofluorides, NaBH4–NaBF4 and KBH4–KBF4, provide some new and partly fluorine substituted borohydride complexes, NaBH2.1F1.9 built from [B(H,F)4]−.223,224 However, their stability is rather limited and these systems have a strong tendency to decompose to significantly more stable ionic metal fluorides or possibly the molecular compound, BF3.

4.6 Trends in series of bimetallic borohydride halides
In some cases, series of bimetallic alkali metal–d-block metal borohydride halides have been investigated. The monometallic borohydrides are described as two different polymorphs for yttrium and cadmium. The existence of monometallic scandium and zinc borohydrides has been suggested, but they have not been observed experimentally. For the bimetallic systems containing lithium, only cadmium forms a ternary halide, Li2CdCl4.146 For the tri-metallic systems containing lithium, synthesis of Li3MZn5(BH4)15 also yields some Li2MCl4, M = Mg or Mn.83 However, ternary halides are formed in most cases for sodium and potassium systems.
The systems MBH4–ZnCl2 (M = Rb, Cs) and MBH4–ScCl3 (M = Rb, Cs) remain incompletely characterised due to their complexity. Thus, there is a tendency for more complex structural chemistry, higher numbers of compounds and solid solutions in the phase diagrams and more diverse compositions for heavier alkali metals.
4.7 Metal borohydride closo-boranes
There are a few examples of mixed borohydride closo-boranes.1,252 Both Cs3BH4B12H12 and Rb3BH4B12H12 were thought to be by-products from the pyrolysis of their respective B3H8− compounds in 1990,253 which can also be formed as decomposition products from bi- and trimetallic borohydride-perovskites.78 The compound Cs3BH4B12H12 was presented in 2003 (see Fig. 11),254 which can be precipitated from water. This compound crystallizes in a trigonal (Rm) anti-perovskite structure type, where Cs+ is considered as a shared vertex of two [BH4Cs6] octahedra. Interestingly there is dynamic disorder of the BH4− anion at room temperature, whereas a further structural transition is believed to occur near 305 °C, which could involve rotation of the B12H122− anions. This was also suggested by a more detailed study of the decomposition of borohydride-perovskites, and the symmetry of the high temperature cubic anti-perovskite polymorph was identified as P23.255
 Fig. 11  Room temperature structure (Rm) of Cs3BH4B12H12 viewed approximately along the b-axis of the hexagonal lattice. The anti-perovskite cubic unit cell of the high temperature polymorph (P23) is shown in green. Note the disordered borohydride anion already at room temperature. Cs (blue), B (green) and H (white). 
More recently Na3BH4B12H12 and (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12 were synthesized by mechanical milling followed by heat treatment and investigated for their ion conductivity properties.256 Na3BH4B12H12 is orthorhombic Cmc21 and (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12 is orthorhombic Pna21. Filling the interstitial sites of Na3BH4B12H12 with Li+ affords (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12, where both compounds appear to have ordered B12H122− and BH4− anions, though no conclusions can be drawn on low frequency reorientations.
4.8 Metal borohydride amides
The first composite of a metal borohydride and a metal amide, LiBH4–LiNH2 (1:2), was reported in 2005257 with the aim of improving H2 desorption temperatures, owing to partly negatively and positively charged H atoms present in the composite. In addition, it was shown in 2009 that composites of LiBH4–LiNH2 are good lithium ion conductors.89 These two factors have inspired research into various other borohydride–amide composites, e.g. Mg(BH4)2–LiNH2258 and Mg(BH4)2–Mg(NH2)2 (see Table 10).90 As described earlier in Section 4, halides may directly substitute for BH4− on the same crystallographic position. On the other hand, due to difference in size and coordination, the complex NH2− anion always has unique crystallographic sites compared to BH4− in borohydride-amide structures.

The first reported crystal structure of a borohydride–amide was Li4(BH4)(NH2)3, cubic (I213), with three independent lithium positions that all are coordinated by four ligands, i.e. three BH4− and one NH2−; one BH4− and three NH2−; and four NH2− (Fig. 12).263,264 The rhombohedral structure (R) of Li2(BH4)(NH2) was later determined with two independent lithium positions that are coordinated by three BH4− and one NH2−; and one BH4− and three NH2−.259,260 To our knowledge, the LiBH4–LiNH2 system is unique compared to the other metal borohydride amide systems in the way that new compounds are readily formed by mechanochemical treatment. In all other systems, mechanochemical treatment only leads to physical mixtures of the starting reactants.
 Fig. 12  Crystal structure of Li4(BH4)(NH2)3.263,264 Remarkably, the crystal structure does not contain dihydrogen bonds, although the substance releases practically pure hydrogen under mild conditions. Li (red), B (green), N (blue) and H (white). 
A high temperature polymorph, α-Na2(BH4)(NH2), was prepared by heating NaBH4–NaNH2 to the melting point, 219 °C, for 1 h and subsequently cooling to RT.91 After longer annealing times (10 days) at lower temperatures, 98 °C, α-Na2(BH4)(NH2) transforms into the low temperature polymorph, β-Na2(BH4)(NH2). The cubic α-Na2(BH4)(NH2) crystallizes in the K3SO4F structure type (Pmm), whereas β-Na2(BH4)(NH2) has an orthorhombic structure (Pbcm). Both structures can directly be derived from the anti-perovskite type structure ABO3, with the [BH4]− and [NH2]− moieties in the A and B sites, respectively. The charge balancing Na+ ions occupy 2/3 of the O positions.
Mg(BH4)(NH2) has been prepared by thermal treatment of Mg(BH4)2–Mg(NH2)2 at 180 °C.90 The structure is tetragonal (I41) with the Mg2+ ions tetrahedrally coordinated by two BH4− and two NH2− ligands. This material exhibits relatively high Mg2+ ion conductivity of 10−6 S cm−1 at 150 °C.270
LiCa(BH4)2(NH2) and NaCa(BH4)2(NH2) are suggested to form by ball milling of Ca(BH4)2–MNH2 (M = Li, Na),268 however, structure determination is not reported.266,267
5. Derivatives of metal borohydrides with neutral molecules
Metal borohydrides have diverse compositions with rich and fascinating structural chemistry, which may be further expanded by the inclusion of other negatively charged anions, discussed in the previous sections of this review. Furthermore, a wide range of metal borohydrides containing neutral molecules have been discovered during the past few years that are the topic of the present section. The introduction of nitrogen in metal borohydrides has received significant interest owing to the possible inclusion of dihydrogen bonding via partly positively charged hydrogens, e.g. B–Hδ−⋯+δH–N. Dihydrogen bonding is considered a new valuable approach for tailoring a material's physical and chemical properties. A high number of new ammine, NH3, metal borohydrides have been discovered and trends in composition, structure and properties are first discussed in this section, followed by hydrazine, N2H4 and ammonia borane, NH3BH3 derivatives. Solvent molecules with nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur as donor atoms may also crystallize with metal borohydrides depending on synthesis conditions.
5.1 Ammine metal borohydrides
Ammine metal borohydrides, M(BH4)m·nNH3, have been known since the 1950's, but the number of new compounds has increased tremendously during the past ∼5 years having received interest as both ammonia and hydrogen stores (Table 11). The number of BH4− anions (m) in the compounds is fixed and determined by the oxidation state of the metal, whereas the number of NH3 ligands (n) may range from 1 to 8. Compared to the borohydride anions, NH3 coordinates more strongly and less flexibly to the metal, i.e. always via an electron pair donated by N, and acts as a terminal ligand.

5.1.1 Mono-metallic ammine metal borohydrides. 

Monoammine lithium borohydride. LiBH4·NH3, is the only reported ammine alkali metal compound stable at RT. Monoammine lithium borohydride crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell with symmetry Pnma.271 Each Li atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by three BH4− units and one NH3 molecule, while each BH4− unit is linked to three Li atoms and four NH3 molecules via dihydrogen interactions.

Mg(BH4)2·nNH3, are known for n = 1, 2, 3 and 6, while the crystal structure for n = 1 remains unknown.272,273 Mg(BH4)2·6NH3 is isostructural to MgCl2·6NH3 (if the hydrogen atoms are not considered) and crystallizes in a cubic unit cell (Fmm), where Mg is octahedrally coordinated by six NH3 molecules, forming [Mg(NH3)6]2+ complexes, while BH4− act as counter ions in the crystalline solid.272 Mg(BH4)2·3NH3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell with space group Pnma.54 Here, Mg coordinates to two terminal BH4− anions and three NH3 molecules, forming neutral molecular complexes [Mg(BH4)2(NH3)3] connected by dihydrogen bonds between Hδ− from BH4− and Hδ+ from NH3. Similarly, Mg(BH4)2·2NH3 forms neutral complexes of [Mg(BH4)2(NH3)2] where Mg is tetrahedrally coordinated by two BH4− anions and two neutral NH3 ligands.272

Ammine calcium borohydrides. Ca(BH4)2·nNH3, are known for n = 1, 2, 4 and 6, where n = 6 is isostructural to Mg(BH4)2·6NH3 and consists of octahedral complexes [Ca(NH3)6]2+ charge balanced by BH4−. A monoclinic (P21/c) Ca(BH4)2·4NH3 has Ca octahedrally coordinated by four equatorial NH3 groups and two axial terminal BH4− groups forming neutral [Ca(NH3)4(BH4)2] complexes.277 The structure is composed of hcp octahedra layers in the bc-plane stacked along the a-axis in the order AAA, which are connected by dihydrogen bonds. Ca(BH4)2·2NH3 has an orthorhombic structure (Pbcn) in which Ca is coordinated octahedrally by four bridging BH4− groups and two terminal NH3 groups. Ca and the four BH4− groups form a 2D layer stacked in the order ABAB.275 Ca(BH4)2·NH3 has an orthorhombic unit cell (Pna21) with Ca octahedrally coordinated by one NH3 group and five bridging BH4− ligands, creating zig-zag chains of edge sharing octahedra running along the c-axis forming a 3D network.274

Ammine strontium borohydrides. Sr(BH4)2·nNH3 (n = 1, 2, 4), have been reported with Sr(BH4)2·4NH3 being isostructural to Ca(BH4)2·4NH3.277 Sr(BH4)2·2NH3 (orthorhombic, Pnc2) consists of Sr octahedrally coordinated by four bridging BH4− groups in-plane and by two axial NH3 groups. Similar to Ca(BH4)2·2NH3, the four BH4− groups and the metal create a two-dimensional layer in the bc-plane stacked in the sequence AAA along the a-axis. The NH3 groups are terminal ligands pointing between the layers. Sr(BH4)2·NH3 (orthorhombic, Pbna) has Sr coordinated octahedrally by five BH4− groups and one NH3 group similar to Ca in Ca(BH4)2·NH3.274 There are two different types of BH4− groups in the structure of Sr(BH4)2·NH3, one BH4− is bridging between three Sr atoms by the edge of the tetrahedron (η2), while one BH4− group is bridging two Sr atoms by edge (η2) and face (η3) sharing. Sr(BH4)2·NH3 is a double layered structure in the ab-plane, where the identical layers are shifted by an n-glide plane. The layers are stacked along the c-axis in the sequence ABAB and connected by dihydrogen bonds.

Ammine aluminum borohydride. Al(BH4)3·nNH3, have been known for n = 1 since 1974,290 whereas the structure of n = 6 was reported more recently.281 Al(BH4)3·NH3 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (P21/n) and consists of tetrahedral neutral complexes of [Al(BH4)3(NH3)]. Al(BH4)3·6NH3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pbcn) that consists of [Al(NH3)6]3+ complexes, while BH4− act as counter ions in the crystalline solid.

Triammine vanadium borohydride. V(BH4)3·3NH3, crystallizes in a cubic system (F23) and consists of neutral [V(BH4)3(NH3)3] complexes, where V is octahedrally coordinated.282

Hexaammine chromium, iron and cobalt borohydride. M(BH4)2·6NH3 (M = Cr, Fe, Co) with the metals in the oxidation state (II), are all isostructural and are also isostructural to M(BH4)2·6NH3 (M = Mg, Ca), i.e. consisting of [M(NH3)6]2+ and [BH4]− complexes.94

Ammine manganese borohydrides. Mn(BH4)2·nNH3, are known for n = 1, 2, 3 and 6, while the crystal structure for n = 1 remains unknown, and n = 2, 3 and 6 are all isostructural to the magnesium analogues.54 Thus, Mn(BH4)2·6NH3 forms [Mn(NH3)6]2+ complexes with BH4− as counter ions, while Mn(BH4)2·3NH3 and Mn(BH4)2·2NH3 contain neutral molecular complexes.

Tetraammine zinc borohydride. Zn(BH4)2·4NH3 is one of the first reported ammine metal borohydrides, but the crystal structure remains unknown.119 More recently, Zn(BH4)2·2NH3, monoclinic (P21), was discovered and consists of neutral [Zn(BH4)2(NH3)2] complexes connected by dihydrogen bonds.283

Ammine yttrium borohydrides. Y(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7), form the most extensive ammine metal borohydride series.53 Y(BH4)3·7NH3 (orthorhombic, Pca21) contains cation complexes of Y surrounded by seven NH3 molecules, forming a monocapped trigonal prism. The [Y(NH3)7]3+ prisms form a hexagonal pattern in the ab-plane, which are stacked in the order ABAB along the c-axis. The structure of Y(BH4)3·6NH3 (Pa) is built from Y octahedrally coordinated by six ammonia molecules producing octahedral complexes [Y(NH3)6]3+. The [Y(NH3)6]3+ octahedra are ordered in a hexagonal pattern in (111) layers, which are stacked in the sequence ABC along the [111] direction. Compared to the other ammine yttrium borohydrides, Y(BH4)3·6NH3 has a low density and the BH4− may be relatively mobile. Y(BH4)3·5NH3 has a hexagonal unit cell (P63) with Y eight-fold coordinated by five NH3 molecules and three terminal BH4− groups in molecular complexes [Y(NH3)5(BH4)3]. The complexes [Y(NH3)5(BH4)3] are packed in the ab-plane in a hexagonal pattern, which are stacked in the order ABAB along the c-axis. Y(BH4)3·4NH3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pna21) and Y is seven-fold coordinated by four NH3 and three BH4−, creating neutral molecular complex [Y(NH3)4(BH4)3]. The molecular complexes are packed in ab-layers in a hexagonal pattern, which are stacked in the order ABAB along the c-axis. Y(BH4)3·2NH3 (orthorhombic, Pbca) with Y3+ coordinated to two NH3 and to four BH4− groups in an octahedron, where two of the BH4− groups are bridged to other yttrium atoms. Thus, the solid Y(BH4)3·2NH3 consists of one-dimensional zig-zag ribbons running along the a-axis. Y(BH4)3·NH3 is orthorhombic (Cmc21) with Y3+ coordinated by one NH3 and five BH4− groups, where four of the BH4− groups are bridging other yttrium atoms, forming 2D layers stacked in the order ABAB.

Ammine zirconium borohydride. Zr(BH4)4·nNH3, has the highest number of coordinated NH3, i.e. n = 8, and crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pnma).284 The structure is built from complex cations [Zr(NH3)8]4+ charge balanced by BH4−.

Ammine lanthanum borohydrides. La(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = α-4, β-4, 6), have recently been reported.285 La(BH4)3·6NH3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (P212121) with La3+ coordinated by six NH3 ligands and two terminal BH4− groups, creating a large complex cation [La(BH4)2(NH3)6]+ that is charged balanced by one BH4− (Fig. 13) α-La(BH4)3·4NH3 and β-La(BH4)3·4NH3 are, together with the cerium analogues, the only examples of ammine metal borohydrides having two polymorphs. α-La(BH4)3·4NH3 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (I2), where La3+ is coordinated by four NH3 groups and three BH4− groups, creating molecular clusters [La(BH4)3(NH3)4]. β-La(BH4)3·4NH3 are isostructural to M(BH4)3·4NH3 (M = Y, Gd, Dy).

Cerium lanthanum borohydrides. Ce(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = α-4, β-4, 5, 6), have been reported.285 α-and β-Ce(BH4)3·4NH3 are isostructural to α- and β-La(BH4)3·4NH3, while Ce(BH4)3·5NH3 and Ce(BH4)3·6NH3 are isostructural to M(BH4)3·5NH3 (M = Y, Gd, Dy) and La(BH4)3·6NH3, respectively.


5.1.2 Bimetallic ammine metal borohydrides. 
Seven ammine bimetallic borohydrides have been reported in the scientific literature. Here, NH3 always coordinates to the metal with the highest charge density, which also has the higher oxidation number, while the metal with lower charge density, typically Li or Na, only coordinate to BH4−.

Diammine lithium magnesium borohydride. LiMg(BH4)3·2NH3, has a hexagonal unit cell (P63), where Mg is five-fold coordinated and resides in triangular-bipyramidal coordination, with the N atoms located at the axial positions of this polyhedron and the BH4− groups at the equatorial positions.286 Li atoms are located in a triangular antiprism formed by six BH4− groups.

Hexaammine dilithium magnesium borohydride. Li2Mg(BH4)4·6NH3 (tetragonal, P42/mnm) is another known ammine bimetallic borohydride based on lithium and magnesium54,286–291 built from distinct [Mg(NH3)6]2+ complex ions counter-balanced by one-dimensional [Li2(BH4)4]n2− polymers.52,281

Hexaammine dilithium aluminum borohydride. Li2Al(BH4)5·6NH3, was the first ammine bimetallic borohydride reported and reveals a promising hydrogen storage capacity and thermal decomposition temperature.288 The structure of Li2Al(BH4)5·6NH3 is hexagonal (Pc), where Al is octahedrally coordinated by NH3 forming complex cations [Al(NH3)6]3+, as in Al(BH4)3·6NH3. Li is tetrahedrally coordinated by BH4−, and the Li[BH4]4 tetrahedra are then vertex-linked through three bridging BH4− units with the fourth BH4− in the trans position, leading to the formation of a two-dimensional honeycomb-patterned sheet that spreads along the ab plane.

Tetraammine lithium scandium borohydride. LiSc(BH4)4·4NH3, crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pc21n), where Sc is octahedrally coordinated by three NH3 ligands and three BH4− groups.282

Hexaammine dilithium manganese borohydride. Li2Mn(BH4)4·6NH3, and hexaammine dilithium iron borohydride, Li2Fe(BH4)4·6NH3, are isostructural to Li2Mg(BH4)2·6NH3 and consist of [M(NH3)6]2+ complexes and [Li2(BH4)4]n2− polymers.54,94

Diammine sodium zinc borohydride. NaZn(BH4)3·2NH3, crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (P21nb) and consists of large complex bimetallic cations [NaZn(BH4)2(NH3)2]+ charge balanced by BH4−.289


5.1.3 Solid solutions of ammine metal borohydrides. 
Only two solid solutions of ammine metal borohydrides have been reported, which are Mn1−xMgx(BH4)2·6NH3 where the metal cation site is statistically disordered,54 and Co(BH4)2−xClx·6NH3 where the anion site is partially occupied by Cl− and BH4−.94 Both Mn1−xMgx(BH4)2·6NH3 and Co(BH4)2−xClx·6NH3 have the cubic symmetry Fmm.


5.1.4 Structural trends for ammine metal borohydrides. 
Ammine metal borohydrides are represented by a range of different structure types and an overview is provided in Table 12. The structures of magnesium, calcium, strontium, manganese and yttrium borohydride consist of three-dimensional networks of [M(BH4)6] octahedra or [M(BH4)4] tetrahedra, where each BH4− group bridge between two metal atoms with edge (η2) coordination.129,137,142,145,197 Introduction of NH3 molecules interrupts these frameworks. For the series of ammine yttrium borohydrides, the structures vary from two-dimensional layers (n = 1), one-dimensional chains (n = 2), molecular compounds (n = 4 and 5) to those containing large complex cations (n = 6 and 7), see Fig. 14. Similar structural variations appear for the other series of compounds. In general, molecular structures appear when the total number of ligands (NH3 + BH4−) match the preferred coordination number of the cations, e.g. [Mn(BH4)2(NH3)2] and [Sr(BH4)2(NH3)4]. For compounds with higher numbers of coordinated NH3 molecules, BH4− becomes a counter ion, e.g. [Ca(NH3)6](BH4)2 and [Y(NH3)n](BH4)3 (n = 6 and 7), whereas one- or two-dimensional structures are formed for compounds with lower numbers of coordinated NH3 molecules.

 Fig. 14  The four different structure types observed for Y(BH4)3·nNH3, i.e. (a) complex cations (n = 7); (b) molecular compounds (n = 4); (c) one dimensional chains (n = 2); (d) 2D-layered structures (n = 1). 
The NH3 coordinated metal cations may be described as complex cations, and the complete structure may be illustrated as a packing of the complex cations (relatively close to being spherical) and borohydride anions. The dihydrogen contacts between them lower the symmetry compared to the simple packing of spheres.
Metal–nitrogen bond distances for selected ammine metal borohydrides plotted as a function of the ionic radius are shown in Fig. 15. As expected, the M–N bond distances increase approximately linearly with increasing ionic radius, and the M–N bond distances do not vary significantly for varying numbers of NH3 ligands, e.g., the Sr–N bond lengths only varies from 2.69–2.70 Å for Sr(BH4)2·nNH3 (n = 1, 2 and 4). However, the Zr–N interactions are outliers for this trend with bond lengths ranging 2.15–2.67 Å observed in the [Zr(NH3)8]4+ side-bicapped trigonal prism for [Zr(NH3)8](BH4)4.284
 Fig. 15  Metal–nitrogen bond distances for selected ammine metal borohydrides plotted as a function of the ionic radius of the metal. The coordination number (CN) of the metals are provided and represents the number of BH4− and NH3 coordinated to the metal. 
On the other hand, the coordination of BH4− tetrahedra to a metal is more flexible, illustrated by the range of M–B distances and varying hapticities from η0 to η3 (Fig. 16), i.e. BH4− can be either a terminal or bridging ligand or act as a counter-ion. As expected, when BH4− coordinates to a metal in a partly covalent manner, i.e. η1 to η3 then bond distances increase for increasing ionic radii of the metal, which is also observed for metal borohydrides.292 M–B distances substantially increase for decreasing hapticities in the yttrium based series Y(BH4)3·nNH3: where Y–B is in the range of 4–5 Å when BH4− has dominantly ionic interactions with ammine yttrium complexes (η0) for n = 6, 7 (see Table 13). In ammine bimetallic borohydrides, NH3 coordinates to the metal with the highest charge density, whereas BH4− may coordinate to both metals.
 Fig. 16  Metal–boron distances and hapticities (ηx) for selected ammine metal borohydrides plotted as a function of the ionic radius of the metal. Due to the weak scattering of H, hapticities are tentative for structures that are not DFT optimized, i.e. η(Al3+) = 2–3, η(Mn2+) = 2–3 and η(Sc3+) = 2–3. The large M–B distances >3.5 occur for BH4− acting as a counter anion, η0.

The unit cell volumes per formula unit (V/Z) at RT as a function of the number of NH3 molecules, n, in the formula unit for M(BH4)m·nNH3 (M = Ca, Sr, Mn and Y, Fig. 17) reveals an approximately linear relationship for each series. For the manganese-based series, Mn(BH4)2·nNH3, the slope of the straight line is 34.0 Å3 per molecule (R2 = 0.9998) corresponding well to the size of one ammonia molecule, which in solid NH3 at −80 °C is V(NH3) = 33.9 Å3.293 In order to include Li2Mn(BH4)4 in the plot, the volume of two LiBH4 (V(LiBH4) = 54.2 Å3)24 has been subtracted from V(Li2Mn(BH4)4·6NH3), which has a slightly lower V/Z than Mn(BH4)2·6NH3. Similarly, the DFT optimized structures of Y(BH4)3·nNH3 increase linearly as a function of n (37.3 Å3, R2 = 0.9916), whereas the experimental values deviate slightly from the linear trend.
 Fig. 17  Unit cell volumes (V) at RT divided by the number of formula units (Z) plotted as a function of the number of ammonia molecules, n, in the formula unit, M(BH4)m·nNH3. The dashed and solid line correspond to linear fit to the DFT optimized values for Y(BH4)3·nNH3 and the experimental values for Mn(BH4)2·nNH3, respectively. The unit cell volume of Li2Mn(BH4)4·6NH3 subtracted the volume of two formula units of LiBH4 is also included. 
All ammine metal borohydride structures contain dihydrogen Hδ−⋯Hδ+ contacts between partly positively charged hydrogen, Hδ+ bonded to N and partly negatively charged hydrogen, Hδ− bonded to B. The shortest distance, 1.850 Å, between [Y(NH3)7]3+ and BH4− anions is obtained by DFT optimization of Y(BH4)3·7NH3 determined by X-ray diffraction. However, as discussed in Section 5.1.5, the strength of the dihydrogen bonds do not play a significant role for the composition of the released gases on thermal decomposition.
Structural analogies between ammine metal borohydrides and chlorides or bromides exist, considering only heavier atoms, i.e. neglecting hydrogen atoms. For example, M(BH4)2·6NH3 (M = Mg and Ca) and MgX2·6NH3 (X = Cl and Br) are isostructural, and Sr(BH4)2·2NH3 and MCl2·2NH3 (M = Ca and Sr) are structurally similar. The borohydride complex, BH4−, is a non-spherical anion in contrast to the halide anions; therefore crystal structures of ammine metal borohydrides often have lower symmetry than their halide analogues, as usually observed when comparing metal borohydrides and metal halides. A high degree of structural similarity is observed between compounds with high numbers of coordinated ammonia (n), where both the BH4− anion and the halides, X−, act as counter ions with a predominantly ionic bonding, η0.


5.1.5 Thermal properties of ammine metal borohydrides. 
The research of ammine metal borohydrides as potential hydrogen storage materials was initiated by Soloveichik et al. in 2008, studying Mg(BH4)2·2NH3, which mainly releases H2 upon decomposition, whereas Mg(BH4)2·6NH3 mainly releases NH3.272 Since then, ammine metal borohydrides have attracted attention as promising hydrogen storage materials, e.g., the compounds Al(BH4)3·6NH3, Li2Al(BH4)5·6NH3 and Zn(BH4)2·2NH3 release 9–12 wt% H2 in the temperature range 115–170 °C with traces of NH3.279,283,288 In comparison, the decomposition of metal borohydrides, M(BH4)m, below 200 °C is always accompanied by the release of diborane, B2H6.
Interestingly, ammine metal borohydrides with low electronegativities (χp < 1.6) often display reduced temperatures for gas release when compared to the pure metal borohydride. On the other hand, ammine metal borohydrides with high electronegativities (χp > 1.6) are often more thermally stable than their respective metal borohydride.54 The stabilization could be due to complex formation in ammine metal borohydrides with high electronegativities (χp > 1.6), causing a shielding effect to the metal cation. For example, Zr(BH4)4 decomposes by sublimation and releases a mixture of B2H6 and H2 at Tsub = 29 °C, whereas [Zr(NH3)8](BH4)4 mainly releases H2 with only impurities of NH3 at 130 °C.109,284
In the literature, H2 rich (and NH3 poor) gas streams are often attributed to strong dihydrogen bonds, however, recent experimental results disagree with this hypothesis.53,54,277 NH3 is released for Y(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = 7 and 6), which reveals the strongest dihydrogen bonds (∼1.85 Å) among the Y(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = 7, 6, 5, 4, 2 and 1) compounds. The NH3/BH4− ratios (n/m) also cause higher hydrogen purity for low n/m ratios in some cases, i.e. M(BH4)m·nNH3 (M = Mg, Mn and Y) but not others, i.e. LiBH4·NH3, Ca(BH4)2·NH3 and Sr(BH4)2·NH3. Therefore, the composition of the released gas depends on two factors:277
(i) The stability of the metal borohydride. If the thermal stability of an ammine metal borohydride is similar to or higher than the thermal stability of the corresponding metal borohydride, then H2 is released. In contrast, NH3 is released if the thermal stability of the ammine metal borohydride is significantly lower than the corresponding metal borohydride (Fig. 18). Ca(BH4)2·nNH3 and Sr(BH4)2·nNH3 clearly become more stable for lower n/m ratios, however, they still decompose at significantly lower temperatures than M(BH4)2, M = Ca, Sr, and they release NH3 only. At higher temperatures the remaining M(BH4)2, M = Ca, Sr, decompose and release hydrogen. Similarly, Y(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = 7, 6 and 5), release NH3 at significantly lower temperatures than the decomposition temperature of Y(BH4)3, Tdec(Y(BH4)3) ∼200 °C, whereas the compounds Y(BH4)3·nNH3 (n = 4, 2 and 1) release decreasing amounts of NH3 in the gas mixture consisting of NH3 and H2 in the temperature range, T ∼ 160–200 °C, approaching Tdec(Y(BH4)3) ∼ 200 °C. Ammine metal borohydrides based on less stable metal borohydrides, e.g. M = Al, Zn, Zr and V,279,280,283,284 do not release pure NH3 gas, possible because of the lower decomposition temperature of the respective metal borohydrides. Thus, the less stable metal borohydrides react with NH3 upon decomposition and release H2 (and in some cases also some NH3). As an example, Al(BH4)3·6NH3 releases H2 and small amounts of NH3 at ∼165 °C, where Al(BH4)3 is unstable, Tdec(Al(BH4)3) ∼ 25 °C (Fig. 18).279 This hydrogen release can be decreased even lower (∼120 °C) by encapsulating Al(BH4)3·6NH3 within a nanoporous polymer.294

(ii) The partial pressure of ammonia. In a closed system, the partial pressure of ammonia increases upon ammonia release, p(NH3) > 0, during thermolysis of LiBH4·NH3, Ca(BH4)2·nNH3 and Sr(BH4)2·nNH3. At higher temperatures, the released ammonia gas reacts with the metal borohydride, releasing hydrogen exothermically in a solid gas reaction.275,295


5.1.6 Mechanism for gas release of ammine metal borohydrides. 
Hydrogen release from ammine metal borohydrides appears always to be exothermic, which indicates that a chemical reaction is responsible for the gas release. This may suggest that hydrogen is released in an elimination reaction between Hδ+ and Hδ−. Furthermore, we notice that the thermal stability for ammine metal borohydrides and ammine metal chlorides are similar when comparing the peak temperature of NH3 release, Tdec(NH3). As examples, Y(BH4)3·7NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 80 °C) is slightly less stable than YCl3·7NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 100 °C),291 and Mg(BH4)2·6NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 150 °C) and MgCl2·6NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 150 °C) have similar thermal stability,296 whereas Mn(BH4)2·6NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 130 °C) is slightly more stable than MnCl2·6NH3 (Tdec(NH3) ∼ 105 °C).297 This observation may indicate that the release of ammonia is mainly determined by the strength of the metal–ammonia (M–N) bond in the complex. Thus, the above observations support that there is no direct relation between dihydrogen bond strength, N–Hδ+⋯−δH–B, in the solid state and the composition of the released gas. Moreover, hydrogen release from ammine metal borohydrides may in fact be due to a chemical reaction between the proposed intermediate, diborane, B2H6, which may take part in the decomposition of metal borohydrides and ammonia released simultaneously or at slightly lower temperatures. We note that diborane release is always suppressed for ammine metal borohydrides as compared to the respective metal borohydrides.

5.2 Hydrazine metal borohydride complexes
Six hydrazine metal borohydride complexes, M(BH4)m·nNH2NH2, are known (see Table 14) based on M = Li, Na and Mg, where LiBH4·NH2NH2 and LiBH4·2NH2NH2 were first reported in 2012.118 In 2013 four more hydrazine metal borohydride complexes were reported, i.e. NaBH4·NH2NH2, Mg(BH4)2·3NH2NH2, LiBH4·1/2NH2NH2, LiBH4·1/3NH2NH2.117 In contrast to ammonia, NH3, hydrazine, NH2NH2, is a more flexible ligand that can bridge between two metals or be a terminal ligand. The coordination to the metal is always via a lone pair donated by a nitrogen atom.

LiBH4·NH2NH2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (Cc) with lithium tetrahedrally coordinated by two BH4− and two NH2NH2 groups. LiBH4·2NH2NH2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pca21), where lithium coordinates four NH2NH2. NH2NH2 bridges between two lithium cations forming chain-like cationic complexes [Li(NH2NH2)4]+, which are separated by BH4− (see Fig. 19).

LiBH4·1/2NH2NH2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (P212121) and consists of two-dimensional layers. Li+ is coordinated by three BH4− ligands and one NH2NH2 that is bridged to the neighbouring Li+. There are two types of BH4− ligands that both coordinate to Li through the edge (η2). One BH4− is located in the same plane as the Li atoms and coordinates to four Li atoms, while one BH4− is positioned slightly above (or below) the plane and coordinates to two Li atoms.
LiBH4·1/3NH2NH2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (P21). Three independent Li atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated, one by four BH4− and two by three BH4− and one hydrazine molecule. While borohydrides are shared by three or four Li atoms, the hydrazine molecule only bridges two Li atoms. Hence, the resulting 3D framework is rather complex.
NaBH4·NH2NH2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (P21/c). Each Na+ coordinates to two bridging NH2NH2 leading to the formation of [Na(NH2NH2)2]n+ chains, which are separated by BH4− with Na–B distances in the range from 2.97 to 3.05 Å (see Fig. 19).
Mg(BH4)2·3NH2NH2 crystallizes in a trigonal unit cell (P1c). Each Mg2+ is octahedrally coordinated by six NH2NH2 forming [Mg(NH2NH2)6]2+ complex cations that are charge balanced by BH4−.
Generally, the hydrazine metal borohydride complexes have high hydrogen content and also favourable decomposition temperatures, e.g. approx. 13.0 wt% H2 is released from LiBH4·NH2NH2 at 140 °C in the presence of Fe–B catalysts.118 However, this leads to the formation of very stable Li3BN2 and BN according to reaction scheme (5.1). 3(LiBH4·NH2NH2)(s) → Li3BN2(s) + 2BN(s) + N2(g) + 12H2(g)(5.1)
5.3 Ammonia borane metal borohydride complexes
The first ammonia borane (AB) metal borohydride complexes, LiBH4(NH3BH3)0.5 and Ca(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2 were reported in 2010,114 whereas other ammonia borane metal borohydride complexes are now reported (Table 15). They are all prepared by mechanochemistry, except for Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) (where crystals are formed by reacting liquid Al(BH4)3 and solid NH3BH3) and Ca(BH4)2(NH3BH3) (that is formed during decomposition of NH4Ca(BH4)3). Complex formation is not reported for the more stable ionic alkali metal borohydrides and ammonia borane, but physical mixtures of the reactants are obtained by ball milling with M(BH4)m–NH3BH3 (M = Na, K, Rb and Cs).298 NH3BH3 may coordinate to the metal via a lone pair donated by nitrogen, i.e. act as a terminal ligand; or it may also coordinate to the metal by Hδ− covalently bonded to B, i.e. bridge between two metal atoms; or it may even stay isolated from the metal and only coordinate via dihydrogen bonds. Ammonia borane complexes can also be formed from ammine metal borohydrides, resulting in framework structures, i.e. [Al(NH3)6][Li2(BH4)5]·3NH3BH3 and [Mg(NH3)2(BH4)2]·NH3BH3 where AB is not coordinated to metal atoms but linked with other hydrogen-containing molecules and ions via dihydrogen bonds.299,300 The hydrogen evolution from these composites is significantly improved compared to the parent compounds containing no ammonia molecules.

The crystal structures of Mg(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2 and Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) both consist of neutral molecular units of [Mg(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2] or [Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3)] coordinated by intermolecular dihydrogen bonds in the solid state (Fig. 20a).115,116,300 The four other known ammonia borane metal borohydride complexes show strikingly different connectivity, where BH4− complexes and NH3BH3 molecules act as bridging ligands. The borohydride complexes bridge three lithium and two NH3BH3 in the structure of LiBH4(NH3BH3)0.5, creating a three-dimensional polymeric framework.114 The LiBH4(NH3BH3) structure is more complex,301 containing four independent borohydride anions and four NH3BH3 molecules (Fig. 20b). While the borohydride anions coordinate two to four lithium atoms, the NH3BH3 molecules act as a terminal ligand or even stay isolated from the metal atoms. In Ca(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2,114 the borohydride groups bridge to two metal atoms, forming a two-dimensional square planar net, while the two NH3BH3 molecules act as terminal ligands, completing the octahedral coordination of Ca. Another ammonia borane complex, Ca(BH4)2(NH3BH3), was recently reported, containing just one NH3BH3 molecule per unit cell.302 While structurally related to Ca(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2, the square planar layers in this net are buckled, and interconnected by a fifth borohydride ligand, which bridges between two Ca atoms. The octahedral coordination polyhedron is again completed by one NH3BH3 molecule, which is located in channels formed by the buckled Ca–BH4 substructure.

5.3.1 Thermal properties of metal borohydride ammonia borane complexes. 
NH3BH3 melts at ∼110 °C and releases one equivalent of hydrogen in each of the three decomposition steps, forming polyaminoborane, [NH2BH2]n (90–120 °C), polyiminoborane, [NHBH]n (120–200 °C) and finally boron nitride, BN (>500 °C).303–306 In addition, the hydrogen release is accompanied by volatile and toxic by-products, such as B2H6 and B3N3H6. Generally, the systems M(BH4)m–NH3BH3 (M = Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca) decompose in a similar manner to NH3BH3 below 200 °C and do not suppress the release of the toxic gases, as observed for metal amidoboranes, M(NH2BH3)m.114,300,301,307 Thus, it may be concluded that NH3BH3 is insufficiently modified in MBH4–NH3BH3 (M = Li, Na, K, Mg and Ca), because NH3BH3 maintains its molecular form.114,308 This is in contrast to metal amidoboranes where one hydrogen atom bonded to N is substituted by a metal atom.307 Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) on the other hand, endothermically releases two moles of H2 from NH3BH3 per Al at 70 °C.116 Thereby Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) differs from pristine ammonia borane, metal amidoboranes and other metal borohydride ammonia borane complexes, and may open up possibilities for reversible hydrogen storage. It was reported that the ability of the strong Lewis acid Al3+ to coordinate both the initial hydrogenated species as well as their dehydrogenation products, makes it a good template for chemical transformations involving light chemical and complex hydrides.309 Therefore the Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) system can be used as a model for potentially reversible dehydrogenation of ammonia borane. Both complexes Mg(BH4)2(NH3BH3)2 and Al(BH4)3(NH3BH3) melt before decomposition, because of the mononuclear complexes present in the crystal structures and in the melt.115,116

5.4 Metal borohydride crystallizing with organic solvents
Solvent based synthesis methods have become more common for the synthesis of metal borohydrides during the past few years as discussed in Section 2 of this review. The solvent may coordinate strongly to the metal borohydride and form a solvate that needs further treatment in order to obtain a solvent-free product. In most cases, the solvent contains a donor atom, O, N or S that coordinates to the metal cation of the borohydride. Selected organic solvents and corresponding solvates are presented in Table 16, including bond lengths between the donor atom and the metal. M–S bonds are generally longer than M–O bonds, suggesting that sulphur based solvents are more easily removed than oxygen based solvents.

Two different structures of metal borohydrides with dimethyl sulfide, (CH3)2S, are known. The first is the monoclinic structure of M(BH4)2·1/2(CH3)2S (M = Mg, Mn), which is a 3D framework containing two metal atoms: one atom is tetrahedrally coordinated to four BH4− groups, and the other to four BH4− groups and one S(CH3)2 ligand to form a trigonal bipyramid.3,58 Sulfur coordinates relatively weakly to the metal with Mg–S and Mn–S bond lengths being 2.669 and 2.705 Å, respectively. Hence, S(CH3)2 is easily removed during drying without decomposing M(BH4)2. Similarly, halide-free and solvent-free yttrium and gadolinium borohydride may be synthesized using dimethyl sulfide with the M(BH4)3·S(CH3)2 (M = Y or Gd) solvates as intermediates, which have monoclinic structures (P21/c).66
In U(BH4)4·(C2H5)2O, U is coordinated by four BH4− ligands coordinating by edge sharing (η2), one BH4− ligand coordinating by face sharing (η3) and one O from ether, giving 14 nearest neighbours. Solvent based methods often provide the most thermodynamically stable compound, typically a monometallic borohydride or a solvate, as discussed in Section 2. Thus, very few bimetallic solvates have been discovered, e.g. LiMn2(BH4)5·2(C2H5)2O and NaMn2(BH4)5·2(C2H5)2O.61 Here, Mn is coordinated by four bridging BH4− groups, while Li/Na is coordinated tetrahedrally by two BH4− groups and two (C2H5)2O ligands Li/Na–O bond lengths ranging from 2.00 to 2.38 Å.
Similar to the metal borohydrides, THF (C4H8O) solvates of M(BH4)2·2THF are isostructural for M = Sr, Eu, Sm.311–313 They crystallize in P21/c and form one-dimensional chains in which each metal atom is surrounded by four borohydrides and two THF molecules.
Water is a well-known inorganic solvent, but tends to react with metal borohydrides in particular for pH < 7. NaBH4·2H2O is the first reported metal borohydride hydrate and crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell (Pbca).103,111 Na is octahedrally coordinated by four BH4− and two H2O groups that all bridge between two Na atoms. There are three intermolecular O–Hδ+⋯–δH–B dihydrogen bonds in the compound in the range 1.77–1.95 Å. Interestingly, NaBH4·2H2O decomposes upon heating at ∼40 °C to NaBH4 and H2O, which at T > 40 °C slowly react to release hydrogen. Thus, the hydrate NaBH4·2H2O does not directly release hydrogen but decomposes into anhydrous NaBH4 and water. This may be because NaBH4 is stable in basic aqueous solutions. Lithium borohydride also absorbs water, forming LiBH4·H2O.112,316 Upon thermal treatment, LiBH4·H2O releases hydrogen at ∼65 °C.316 Calcium borohydride hydrate, Ca(BH4)2·H2O, has also been reported recently.113
6. Thermal properties of metal borohydrides
Metal borohydrides often have a high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density and have been of significant interest for many possible applications including solid-state hydrogen storage. However, the reaction mechanisms are often complex and not well understood, showing high kinetic barriers such that decomposition and hydrogen absorption often only occur at elevated temperatures, which hampers technical applications of these materials. Release and uptake of hydrogen can be denoted a chemical reaction involving two-, three- or multiple-phases such as solid–gas, solid–liquid–gas or solid–solid–gas systems. In many cases more than one possible reaction mechanism is involved, which may also change as a function of the physical conditions, e.g. partial pressures, temperature and/or stoichiometry of involved starting materials. This section focuses on general aspects regarding reaction mechanisms for hydrogen release and uptake during thermolysis, i.e. heating, also denoted pyrolysis, along with different approaches for tailoring and optimization of thermodynamic and kinetic properties. This section reveals that chemical reactions between different hydrides, i.e. reactive hydride composites, and additives can provide new perspectives for creating novel hydrogen carrier systems by tailoring physical, chemical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties. Additives have also been investigated along with their possible catalytic properties for hydrogen release and uptake reactions, as well as their function as grain refiners, and as favourable nucleation sites for the formation and decomposition of hydride compounds. Nanoconfinement is another approach that has been tested for its potential to improve both the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of metal borohydrides.
6.1 Thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake
There is a close correlation between the temperature of hydrogen release and uptake, at a given equilibrium pressure, and the enthalpy and entropy change for metal borohydrides, similar to metal hydrides. Consider a general reaction where a metal, M, reacts with hydrogen to form a metal hydride according to reaction scheme: M(s) + H2(g) ↔ MH2(s)(6.1)
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is, K−1 = p(H2)/pΘ pΘ ≡ 1 bar, standard pressure(6.2)
The Gibbs free energy for the reaction is ΔGr = ΔHr − TΔSr = −RTlnK(6.3)where ΔHr is the change in enthalpy, ΔSr is the change in entropy, T is the temperature (K), and R = 8.3145 J K−1 mol−1 H2. Combining (6.2) and (6.3) gives the van't Hoff equation ln(p(H2)/pΘ) = (RT)−1ΔHr − (R)−1ΔSr(6.4)
A material's hydrogen release temperature is usually given for an equilibrium pressure of peq(H2) = 1.0 bar and is often denoted T(1 bar). For this special case, the van't Hoff equation is reduced to: T(1 bar) = ΔHr/ΔSr(6.5)
The major contribution to the reaction entropy change, ΔSr, is from the change in state of hydrogen (from solid to gas phase), ΔSΘ(H2) = 130.7 J (K mol)−1.317 Therefore, many metal hydrogen systems, but not all, have ΔSr ∼ 130 J (K mol)−1. As such, in order to reach an equilibrium pressure of p(H2) = 1 bar in the temperature range 50 to 200 °C the decomposition enthalpies should be in the range 40–60 kJ mol−1 H2. There is much focus in materials research aimed at identifying hydrides fulfilling this enthalpy range, which corresponds to the operational temperatures for PEM fuel cells.
For the metal borohydrides, however, entropy changes that are significantly different from 130 J (K mol−1 H2) may be observed due to more complex reaction mechanisms and, in some cases, dynamics in the solid state or liquid–solid transitions. Dynamics such as ‘motion’ of BH4− complex anions may contribute to the entropy of the solid state and a lower than expected entropy of melting.318 In addition, significantly higher temperatures for hydrogen release and uptake are often observed in order to obtain reasonable reaction kinetics as compared to the ideal temperature dictated by thermodynamics, e.g. T(1 bar). This is due to kinetic restraints in the solid state, and therefore a thermodynamic driving force is needed, i.e. Tdec > T(1 bar). A drawback is that higher reaction temperatures often facilitate greater chemical complexity, e.g. side-reactions, and also dynamic effects, e.g. hydrogen release from high-temperature polymorphs such as h-LiBH4 and, in some cases, hydrogen exchange from a molten phase.
The formation enthalpy, ΔHf, of metallic hydrides is well defined and exothermic for the stable hydrides. The enthalpy characterizes the strength of the metal hydrogen bond and is partly determined by the local electron density on the interstitial site where hydrogen is placed.319–321 The structure of the metallic hydride is often an expanded version of the parent metal structure (ΔV ∼ 10–20%) and may be considered as being derived by hydrogen intercalation.322 In contrast, the structure of a metal borohydride is much different from the structure of the residue formed by dehydrogenation of the host material. Therefore, the total reaction enthalpy, ΔHr, for hydrogen exchange of metal borohydrides may be considered a sum of contributions from several partial reactions. Thus, ΔHr, for metal borohydrides may not directly correlate with the strength of a single covalent boron hydrogen bond. The decomposition enthalpy, ΔHdec, is endothermic and is challenging to measure accurately.323,324 The decomposition enthalpy may often depend on the method for the measurement and the physical conditions, which may lead to alternative reaction mechanisms or a change of state, such as fusion (i.e. then also including ΔHfus). This is further discussed in the following Section 6.2.
The mechanism for hydrogen transport in metallic hydrides, e.g. the early transition metal hydrides, is dominated by diffusion of single hydrogen atoms (or partially positively or negatively charged ions) in the solid state.325 However, more complex transport phenomena may be involved in the hydrogen release and uptake reactions in the solid state of hydrides with ionic and covalent bonds, i.e. complex metal hydrides. There are many indications in the literature that relatively stable molecule-like units may participate in hydrogen release and uptake reactions in the solid state of boron, aluminium and nitrogen based complex hydrides, possibly BH3, AlH3 or NH3, which is further discussed in Section 6.6. Thus, the reactions that take place during hydrogen release and uptake in metal borohydrides may be significantly more complex than suggested by eqn (6.1). The thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake may be investigated by the Sievert's method by measurement of pressure–temperature–composition (PCT) isotherms. Generally, the published literature suggests increasing difficulty in measuring PCT-isotherms with well-defined plateau pressures for aluminium < nitrogen < boron based hydrides. This may be due to increasing complexity of the involved chemistry, an increasing number of alternative reaction mechanisms, and in some cases, several simultaneous reactions.
6.2 Thermolysis of monometallic borohydrides
Thermolysis denotes the decomposition of a substance upon heat treatment. Monometallic borohydrides may release hydrogen and, in some cases, also diborane during the formation of higher metal boranes, metal borides or even pure boron upon thermolysis, which has been the topic of much research during the past decade. The aim of this section is to provide an overview of some of the general trends that appear in the scientific literature for the thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake in selected, well studied, mono-metallic borohydrides. Data collected for the same material with different methods are compared in Table 17. Additives may significantly change the reaction mechanism of decomposition. The addition of small amounts of additives in the range of a few mol% has been considered for possible catalytic effects and is discussed in Section 6.7, whereas larger amounts may react with the metal borohydrides and form reactive hydride composites, see Section 6.8. Physical conditions such as partial pressures and temperatures also influence the mechanism of decomposition i.e. the decomposition pathway. The presence of impurities, even in minor quantities, can also influence bubbling and frothing during melting.45

Lithium borohydride is the most well investigated metal borohydride regarding the mechanism for hydrogen release and uptake. It undergoes a polymorphic transition from o- to h-LiBH4 at 110 °C and melts at 280 °C.45 The polymorphic transition and melting events can be associated with minor gas release that is often attributed to impurities, e.g. water or oxides, reacting with lithium borohydride.22,23,45,316,339 Dynamic PCT measurements under constant hydrogen flow provide thermodynamic data via the van't Hoff equation for the decomposition reaction, ΔH = 74 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 115 J K−1 mol−1 H2 (see Table 17).326,331
Direct decomposition without the presence of intermediate compounds, at elevated temperatures, leads to the production of boron, lithium hydride and release of 13.1 wt% hydrogen, scheme (6.6). Thermodynamic results from calorimetry provide ΔH = 66.6–68.9 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 97.3–100.2 J K−1 mol−1 H2 (see Table 17) for this suggested reaction. LiBH4(s) → LiH(s) + B(s) + 3/2H2(g)(6.6)
Partial dehydrogenation can also occur, forming lithium closo-borane, Li2B12H12, via less endothermic reactions, scheme (6.7), with a calculated reaction enthalpy of 56 kJ mol−1 H2.330 LiBH4(s) → 5/6LiH(s) + 1/12Li2B12H12(s) + 13/12H2(g)(6.7)
Various quantities of hydrogen in the range from 9–14 wt% are reported to be released from LiBH4 under different experimental conditions, e.g. 9 wt% H2 under evolved hydrogen pressure, and 13.8 wt% H is released in flowing He by heating to 600 °C.22,340 Lithium borohydride has also been decomposed at 600 °C for 5 hours under different partial pressures of hydrogen.341 Only one-third of LiBH4 transforms to Li2B12H12 at p(H2) = 50 bar and no amorphous boron is observed. In the pressure range, 0.1–10 bar, LiBH4 nearly completely decomposes to Li2B12H12 and amorphous boron. Under these physical conditions (600 °C, 5 h), LiBH4 appears to decompose more efficiently to amorphous boron at lower pressure.341 Thermolysis of LiBH4 under vacuum at temperatures up to 600 °C is reported to produce LiH, amorphous B (or lithium boride) via hydrogen-poor Li2B12H12−x.342
The formation of LiBH4 from the elements has also been attempted, which is equivalent to rehydrogenation or reversing reaction (6.6). Amorphous boron is known as a rather inert material with a complex structure of covalently bonded boron that forms a framework containing B12 clusters. Lithium hydride is expected to form readily under hydrogen pressure, but further hydrogenation can be very slow until melting, Tm(LiH) = 689 °C, which facilitates close contact between the reactants.343 The kinetics of hydrogen uptake reactions can be increased by thermal treatment of lithium–boron mixtures at 330 and 450 °C in argon, which facilitates the formation of more reactive lithium borides, LiB3 or Li7B6, respectively.343 The hydrogen uptake reaction has also been investigated by powder neutron diffraction starting with lithium boride.344 The hydrogen/deuterium absorption starts at ∼200 °C with the formation of LiD, and at 350 °C LiBD4 also starts to form. However, under the given experimental conditions, Tmax = 500 °C, p(H2) = 180 bar for ∼18 hours, a complete reaction was not achieved and LiD remains.344
Sodium borohydride, NaBH4, melts at 505 °C, followed by hydrogen release at 534 °C under p(H2) = 1 bar.45,332,345 However, hydrogen release can be observed at T ∼ 500 °C when measured in helium or argon, p(He, Ar) = 1 bar.332 Sodium borohydride decomposes to the elements (Na and B), see reaction scheme (6.8), due to the lower stability of NaH, compared to LiH that is formed in the decomposition of LiBH4. Thermal analysis of NaBH4, however, suggests that intermediate compounds may form during the decomposition.346 NaBH4(s) → Na(l) + B(s) + 2H2(g)(6.8)
Dynamic PCT measurements, under constant hydrogen flow, provide thermodynamic data via the van't Hoff equation, ΔH = 108 ± 3 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 133 ± 3 J K−1 mol−1 H2, which corresponds to a decomposition temperature of Tdec(1 bar) = 539 °C.332 These dynamic PCT measurements are conducted at a constant temperature of 600, 650 or 700 °C and the same starting pressure, p(H2) = 180 bar, with a mass flow controller. The decomposition appears to occur in one step with only one plateau observed on the pressure composition isotherms.332 The entropic component that is measured with dynamic PCT's (ΔS = 133 J K−1 mol−1 H2) is rather high, and much higher than the entropy change measured by calorimetry (ΔS = 93.6–98.6 J K−1 mol−1 H2) (see Table 17). It is experimentally important to note the vapour pressure of Na metal is very high (0.1 bar at 675 °C) and this can result in significant Na loss at high temperature, especially under gas flow.347
Potassium borohydride melts at 625 °C, followed by hydrogen release near 680 °C with a possible reaction mechanism for decomposition similar to that of NaBH4, scheme (6.8).33,345 However, increasing evaporation of potassium from the decomposed residue is expected due to the high vapour pressure of potassium (p(K) = 0.4 bar at 672 °C).348 The high thermal stability of NaBH4 and KBH4 may be the reason for minimal scientific interest and, as such, the decomposition mechanism remains not well investigated. Although, calorimetry indicates that the decomposition enthalpy of KBH4 is high (ΔH = 112.6–113.9 kJ mol−1 H2) (see Table 17), which is favorable for solar thermal applications given adequate kinetics.349–351
Magnesium borohydride, Mg(BH4)2, has received significant interest as a possible hydrogen storage material with a high gravimetric hydrogen content of 14.9 wt% H2. Mg(BH4)2 can undergo an array of polymorphic transitions during heating and melting depending on gas partial pressure.187,188 At elevated hydrogen pressures, p(H2) > ∼1 bar, decomposition is suppressed and the compound melts.45 The decomposition mechanism of magnesium borohydride is also quite complex and highly dependent on reaction conditions.183,187,196,333,352–355 An in situ SR-PXD investigation (constant heating, ΔT/Δt = 4 °C min−1 in p(H2) = 1 bar) of γ-Mg(BH4)2 reveals melting of the β-polymorph at T ∼ 270 °C and observation of a broad diffraction halo at d ∼ 5.1 Å.187Ex situ visual inspection of the melting process reveals a colour change from white to yellow to brown to grey.187 Magnesium hydride crystallizes from the melt at 320 °C and disappears at 360 °C due to the formation of Mg observed in the temperature range 340–580 °C. Boron containing compounds are not observed until the formation of MgB2 at 510 °C.187 Hydrogen release occurs in three steps and the first, 270–325 °C, is assigned to hydrogen release from molten Mg(BH4)2. The second, 325–360 °C, is assigned to hydrogen release from MgH2 and the third, 360–410 °C, to remaining non-crystalline boranes, which may also contribute to the second release.187 Amorphous or nanocrystalline closo-borane, MgB12H12, has been reported to be a major intermediate product during decomposition of Mg(BH4)2 in vacuum.352 However, when Mg(BH4)2 is decomposed in dynamic vacuum in the temperature range 265 to 400 °C the reaction pathway is different.356 Here, Mg(B3H8)2 was observed as the major decomposition product when Mg(BH4)2 was heated to 265 °C. Trace amounts of Mg(B3H8)2 were observed after heating to 285 °C, and none of the boranes Mg(BH4)2, Mg(B3H8)2 or MgB12H12 were observed in samples heated at T > 285 °C.356 Recently, MgB4H10 was also proposed as an intermediate in the decomposition reaction.355 Lower dehydrogenation temperatures tend to increase the amount of higher boranes and a large quantity of Mg(B3H8)2 was obtained after 5 weeks at 200 °C in vacuum.357 Mg(B3H8)2 was converted back to Mg(BH4)2 after 48 h at 250 °C, p(H2) = 120 bar.357 In a similar fashion, a mixture of Mg(B3H8)2·2THF–MgH2 (1:2) was heated to 200 °C under p(H2) = 50 bar for 2 h and the product indicated a quantitative conversion to Mg(BH4)2.358
Formation of magnesium borohydride from the elements by hydrogenation has also been conducted but is kinetically slow. Reactive mechanochemistry in a hydrogen atmosphere has been used successfully and ∼50% of MgB2 was hydrogenated to amorphous Mg(BH4)2 at p(H2) = 100 bar (ball-milling time up to 100 hours).359 Magnesium boride, MgB2, has also been hydrogenated/deuterated at 400 °C and p(H2) = 800 bar to form β-Mg(11BD4)2 with a ∼43% yield.134 A higher borohydride yield was found with pre-milled MgB2 at 400 °C, p(H2) = 950 bar for 108 h (∼75% β-Mg(BH4)2).360
A number of theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to determine the thermodynamics of decomposition for Mg(BH4)2 (see Table 17). Theoretical calculations suggest a reaction enthalpy of ΔH = 38–40 kJ mol−1 H2 for reaction (6.9) or (6.10).335,336 Mg(BH4)2 → MgH2 + 2B + 3H2(6.9) Mg(BH4)2 → MgB2 + 4H2(6.10)
Experimental studies also determine similar enthalpies, with ΔH = 41 kJ mol−1 H2 from a DSC study,334 and ΔH = 39.3–57 kJ mol−1 H2 from van't Hoff plots.196,333 The van't Hoff plots were formulated from PCT isotherms in both cases, but the difference in these data could be due to one set of isotherms being measured with constant gas flow and one set being measured step-wise. This variability also demonstrates the difficulty in obtaining accurate thermodynamic data from metal borohydrides.
Calcium borohydride's physical behaviour is similar to Mg(BH4)2, where a molten phase can be observed near the decomposition temperature, depending on hydrogen backpressure, which is also known to control the decomposition pathway.45,361 The decomposition pathway is temperature dependent and may proceed through a CaB2H6 intermediate to either CaB6 (320–350 °C) or amorphous boron (400–450 °C).362,363 Theoretical calculations predict Ca(BH4)2 decomposition enthalpies to be quantitatively similar to Mg(BH4)2, where ΔH = 40.6–57.3 kJ mol−1 H2 for decomposition reactions (6.11) or (6.12).338 Ca(BH4)2 → 2/3CaH2 + 1/3CaB6 + 10/3H2(6.11) Ca(BH4)2 → CaH2 + 2B + 3H2(6.12)
However, PCT measurements provide much higher thermodynamic quantities with ΔH = 87 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 158 J K−1 mol−1 H2. Here, the entropy is much higher than all other entropies for metal borohydrides (Table 17) including theoretical calculations (ΔS = 105.7–109.3 J K−1 mol−1 H2).338
Strontium borohydride decomposes at 400 °C and releases H2.142,277 Crystalline SrB6 is observed by in situ SR-PXD, which suggests that Sr(BH4)2 decomposes into SrH2, SrB6 and H2.165
Manganese borohydride decomposes at 160 °C with the evolution of hydrogen and large quantities of B2H6.45 For a pure sample of Mn(BH4)2 (9.5 wt% H2), a mass loss of 14.8 wt% is observed in the temperature range 125–175 °C.58 A melting event can also be observed near this temperature but appears to be dependent on hydrogen backpressure and heating rate.45 Temperature dependent in situ SR PXD measured for α-Mn(BH4)2 reveals that the diffraction peaks disappear and the sample turns X-ray amorphous at 140 °C or 160 °C for p(Ar) = 1 bar and p(H2) = 10 bar, respectively.58 The high-pressure polymorph, δ-Mn(BH4)2, transforms into α-Mn(BH4)2 during heating in the temperature range 67–109 °C, hence the two polymorphs decomposes similarly.140
Yttrium borohydride forms an X-ray amorphous solid above 200 °C and decomposes near 275 °C.66,98,198,364 When Y(BH4)3 is decomposed under H2 back pressure, ranging from p(H2) = 1–10 bar, Y(B3H8)3 is observed as the main intermediate according to scheme (6.13), along with small amounts of Y2(B12H12)3.100 Y(BH4)3(s) → 1/3Y(B3H8)3(s) + 2/3YH3(s) + H2(g)(6.13)
The ultimate decomposition results in the formation of YH3, YH2 and YB4, but does not reform the borohydride, even under 1550 bar at 300 °C.66 Theoretical calculations indicate that Y(BH4)3 is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature with a low decomposition reaction enthalpy ΔH = 22.5–36.2 kJ mol−1 H2.199
Cadmium borohydride's low-temperature polymorph α-Cd(BH4)2 transforms to β-Cd(BH4)2, by a first order phase transition, at ∼55 °C and β-Cd(BH4)2 decomposes at ∼75 °C into metallic Cd and likely a mixture of hydrogen and borane gases according to scheme:146 β-Cd(BH4)2(s) → Cd(s) + B2H6(g) + H2(g)(6.14)

Molecular metal borohydride. 
The decomposition mechanism for molecular metal borohydrides, such as Al(BH4)3, Ti(BH4)3, or Zr(BH4)4, remains not fully understood. Apparently these compounds first sublime at low temperatures: around or below 0 °C for Al(BH4)312 and at 29 °C for Zr(BH4)4.109,365 In the gas phase all three compounds tend to release diborane via polymerization reactions. The spontaneous diborane release from Al(BH4)3 and Ti(BH4)3 below room temperature may be responsible for the very aggressive decomposition reactions. The stabilization of Ti(BH4)3 was recently reported through its confinement within a metal–organic-framework (MOF UiO-66), allowing it to be stored at room temperature for months without decomposition.210

6.3 Thermolysis of bi- and trimetallic borohydrides
The thermal decomposition of the metal borohydrides have been shown to occur via a wide range of pathways, often in several steps, which may involve simultaneous and, in some cases, coupled chemical reactions. The following focus is on general trends deduced from published literature regarding both the reaction pathways and thermal stability of bi- and trimetallic borohydrides. Their decomposition mechanism is so far defined by one of two schemes:
(i) Stable metal borohydrides that form the bi- and trimetallic borohydride. Here, the bi- and trimetallic borohydride will separate during thermolysis, either splitting into the individual, stable, borohydrides, or possibly melting in an eutectic composition.
For example: MxM′y(BH4)z, M = Li or Na, M′ = K, Rb, Cs are formed from stable metal borohydrides. During heating, the bimetallic compounds phase separate and may form an eutectic melt as described in Section 6.4. MxM′y(BH4)z, (M = Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs, M′ = Mg, Ca or Sr) are formed from stable metal borohydrides. They are observed to decompose via the formation of mono-metallic alkali metal borohydrides MBH4 and alkaline earth metal borohydrides, which decompose individually at higher temperatures.1,164,165
(ii) A combination of stable and unstable borohydrides that form the bi- and trimetallic borohydride. In this case, the unstable borohydride is often stabilized by its incorporation into a bi- and trimetallic borohydride, resulting in decomposition at higher than normal temperature. However, the decomposition mechanism is unchanged and the remaining stable metal borohydride will stay intact.
For example: MxM′y(BH4)z, (M = Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs, M′ = Al, Y, Sc, Mn, Zn or Cd), may decompose via the formation of mono-metallic alkali metal borohydrides MBH4 but the remaining part may decompose directly to a metal, hydrogen and diborane.70,146,159 All the Cd-based borohydrides show low thermal stability. Their decomposition temperatures exhibit the following trend: β-Cd(BH4)2, ∼75 °C < KCd(BH4)3, ∼80 °C < K2Cd(BH4)4, ∼85 °C, i.e. the higher the content of KBH4 the higher the thermal stability.146
6.4 Eutectic melting of bi- and trimetallic borohydrides
Two or more metal borohydrides may be combined as discussed previously in Section 6.3, forming compounds with new compositions and/or structures, e.g. a new bimetallic compound MM′(BH4)x. In some cases a eutectic melting mixture may form, which has been observed in a few cases involving alkali- and alkaline earth-metal borohydrides.45 For example, LiBH4–MBH4 systems reveal eutectic melting, M = K, and several new bimetallic compounds for M = Rb or Cs with increasingly complex phase diagrams.47,156 The formation of an eutectic mixture was observed to cause hydrogen release at lower temperatures during thermolysis, which could be a kinetic effect. However, structural reorganization upon melting may, in principle, result in weakening or strengthening of chemical bonds, which may influence decomposition, i.e. a thermodynamic effect. These effects may also influence hydrogen uptake properties. An overview of investigated eutectic mixtures is provided in Table 18.

Lithium borohydride–sodium borohydride. 
The LiBH4–NaBH4 system shows almost full solubility, i.e. a solid solution, Li1−xNaxBH4, in the temperature range ∼110–220 °C with compositions 0.0 < x < 0.9. The lowest melting point is observed for Li0.70Na0.30BH4 at Tmp ∼ 216 °C.161,367


Lithium borohydride–potassium borohydride. 
The LiBH4–KBH4 phase diagram reveals a very deep eutectic melting point of Tmp = 105 °C (Fig. 21a).47 Interestingly, a binary stoichiometric compound, LiK(BH4)2, is formed mechanochemically, not thermally, but separates to the monometallic borohydrides at T > 95 °C. In contrast, the sodium borohydride–potassium borohydride system forms a solid solution upon thermal treatment at ∼200 < T < 450 °C. The reason that LiK(BH4)2 formation is facilitated by compression (mechanochemistry) and NaxK1−x(BH4) formation is facilitated by thermal expansion (heating) is due to the volume (V/Z) of the bimetallic compound and solid solution in comparison to their reactants. Compression can form the bimetallic borohydride LiK(BH4)2 owing to a smaller volume than the reactants, whereas thermal treatment can be used to form a bimetallic borohydride with a larger volume than its reactants, in this case a solid solution, NaxK1−x(BH4).47,93

Lithium borohydride–magnesium borohydride. 
The decomposition of the eutectic melting LiBH4–Mg(BH4)2 system initiates above Tmp ∼ 180 °C. At 270 °C, a 0.5LiBH4–0.5Mg(BH4)2 composite releases 7.0 wt% of hydrogen.45,368 The eutectic system therefore releases hydrogen at significantly lower temperature than the individual lithium and magnesium borohydrides, which occur at ∼400 and ∼280 °C, respectively.


Lithium borohydride–calcium borohydride. 
The system LiBH4–Ca(BH4)2 has been investigated for several compositions using DSC, in situ SR-PXD, etc.369,371 Interestingly, this composite undergoes eutectic melting with a minimum temperature of Tmp ∼ 200 °C in a relatively wide composition range 0.6 < x < 0.8.369,371


Sodium borohydride–potassium borohydride. 
The NaBH4–KBH4 phase diagram (Fig. 21b) reveals full solubility in the entire compositional range 0 < x < 1 for Na1−xKxBH4 above 200 °C. The melting point of the solid solution is reduced slightly compared to the individual reactants with a minimum at Tmp ∼ 460 °C for Na0.682K0.318BH4.93


Sodium borohydride–magnesium borohydride. 
The system, xNaBH4–(1 − x)Mg(BH4)2, x = 0.4–0.5, shows melting/frothing between 205–220 °C.370 However, the sample does not become a transparent melt. In contrast, no eutectic is observed for NaBH4–Ca(BH4)2.370

6.5 Trends in thermal decomposition for metal borohydrides
Upon heating, stable mono-metallic borohydrides tend to melt and then start to decompose at slightly higher temperatures, see Fig. 22. On the other hand, the less stable molecular metal borohydrides tend to sublime, rather than melt, and decompose in the gas phase. The decomposition products from the group of stable mono-metallic borohydrides appear to change color, morphology, volume etc. largely related to the degree of decomposition achieved in each system.45 Metallic decomposition products are not observed by visual inspection, X-ray diffraction or nuclear magnetic resonance, suggesting that after heating to modest temperatures the products likely remain as metal borohydrides, or form higher metal boranes, metal hydrides, or metal borides. 11B NMR is particularly useful in identifying decomposition products if they are non-crystalline, where diffraction is less useful. The 11B spectra can be used to differentiate between many different metal borohydrides with different cations, due to their varied interactions with the boron nucleus (Fig. 23). Trends in the NMR chemical shifts of borohydrides have been investigated recently.372 Other spectroscopic methods such as IR and Raman are also useful in characterising crystalline and non-crystalline metal borohydrides, where different bonding environments display characteristic vibrations (Fig. 24). Progress in the spectroscopic understanding of alkali and alkaline earth metal borohydrides, M(BH4)n (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be, Mg, Ca) and reactive hydride composites has been recently reviewed.373–375

(b) Experimentally observed decomposition temperatures, Tdec for metal borohydrides M′(BH4)n and MxM′y(BH4)z plotted as a function of the electronegativity of the metal, M′. The Tdec values refer to the temperature for the maximum gas release and are measured by TGA/DSC or in situ SR-PXD at p(He) or p(Ar) = 1 bar. The inset in Fig. 22b reveal a comparison of linear and exponential correlation between observed decomposition temperatures, Tdec, as a function of the electronegativity of the metal.

 Fig. 24  IR and Raman active fundamental vibrations commonly observed for MBH4.390 
An empirical correlation between the thermal stability, Tdec, of metal borohydrides and Pauling electronegativity was first suggested to exist in 1955391 and has been further investigated theoretically and experimentally by several research groups.6,392,393 The more stable metal borohydrides tend to follow a linear correlation between the electronegativities and decomposition temperature. This approximation, however, is less pronounced for compounds with higher electronegativities. A comparison of a linear and exponential correlation is shown in the inset in Fig. 22b. The decomposition temperatures, Tdec, reported in Fig. 22b are measured by in situ SR-PXD or thermal analysis (TGA/DSC) in inert atmosphere, often p(Ar) = 1 bar. In the case of the bimetallic borohydrides, the values for the Pauling electronegativities, χp, are taken from the more electronegative elements, i.e. Sc, Y, Zn, Cd and Al. This approach is justified by the stronger coordination between the more electronegative metal and BH4, causing the formation of discrete metal borohydride anions (see the discussion in Section 3.8).
The less electronegative metal is often an alkali metal with a dominantly ionic interaction. The validity of this assumption is illustrated by the decomposition of KCd(BH4)3 to K2Cd(BH4)4 and Cd(BH4)2. The latter immediately decomposes to Cd, H2 and B2H6. Upon further heating, K2Cd(BH4)4 decomposes to KBH4 and Cd(BH4)2, where the latter again immediately decomposes to Cd, H2 and B2H6.146 This example illustrates that the more electronegative cation is controlling the stability. Furthermore, metal borohydrides containing complex anions, such as [Sc(BH4)4]−, [Zn2(BH4)5]− and [Zn(BH4)3]− in the compounds MSc(BH4)4, MZn2(BH4)5 and MZn(BH4)3 reveal only minor variations in the decomposition temperature with changes in alkali metal.70,166,380 This indicates that the decomposition temperature is specific for these complex anions rather than determined by the overall composition of the compound. This underlines the strong correlation between the decomposition temperature and the electronegativity of the complex-forming metal and the key role of the complex M–BH4 anions in the structural stability of bimetallic borohydrides.
6.6 The released gas from metal borohydrides, stability of diborane
Materials containing complex ions were overlooked as hydrogen carriers for possible hydrogen storage applications until the late nineties due to their relatively high stability and the fact that hydrogen uptake only occurs under extreme conditions. A paradigm shift was initiated by the discovery that titanium catalyzed NaAlH4 releases and uptakes hydrogen at moderate conditions,394 which initiated the research activities in hydrogen storage systems containing complex ions.
The boron, aluminium and nitrogen based complex hydrides, e.g. LiBH4, LiAlH4 or LiNH2, contain the complexes, BH4−, AlH4− or NH2−. These complexes form stable crystalline solids with many alkali or alkaline earth metals, which act as counter ions in the solid state. Reversible nitrogen-based complex hydride systems were discovered by Ping Chen et al. in 2002 and metal borohydrides were also found to be reversible, albeit under harsh conditions, e.g. LiBH4 in 1980.329,395
A drawback for these light element complex hydrides, e.g. LiBH4, LiAlH4 or LiNH2, appears to be that their neutral counterparts (AH3) are neutral molecules, BH3 or NH3, or metastable solids, AlH3. In fact, BH3 is in equilibrium with its dimer, B2H6, where the partial pressure of BH3 is roughly 2 × 10−8 of the pressure of B2H6 at room temperature.396 However, at higher temperature the BH3 partial pressure is higher, i.e. 104 times higher at 200 °C than RT, possibly promoting hydrogen release via polymerization reactions. Ammonia, NH3, is a reactive gas at room temperature that liquefies below −33.3 °C at p(NH3) = 1 bar. Ammonia is an industrially useful and energy dense compound (18.6 MJ kg−1), but may be converted to N2 and H2 at high temperature, with catalysts, with a Na/NaNH2 cracking system or by the omnipresent NaOH in NaNH2 as shown recently.397,398 Alane, AlH3, is a polymeric solid built from octahedra of AlH6.399,400 Alane is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature, but is stabilized in the bulk form by surface aluminium oxide layers.401,402
There are many indications that these ‘molecules’ (AH3) play a crucial role in the mechanism for hydrogen release and uptake in complex hydrides, e.g. LiBH4, LiAlH4 or LiNH2. This is exemplified by the fact that the light element complex hydrides can be prepared by a reaction between the ‘molecule’ and ionic hydrides (mentioned in Section 2.5).95,403 On the other hand, an ionic hydride, e.g. LiH or NaH may also be observed in the dehydrogenated state: AH3 + LiH ↔ LiAH4 A = B, N, or Al(6.15)
Lithium borohydride, LiBH4 releases hydrogen at T > 400 °C, but was also found to emit diborane at the impurity level.339 This contrasts with, for example, Mn(BH4)2, which releases significant amounts of diborane at T ∼ 160 °C.58 Thus, metal borohydrides have a tendency to release increasing amounts of diborane when they have lower decomposition temperatures.97,404 The extreme case is for LiZn2(BH4)5 that decomposes at T ∼ 100 °C and presumably releases a 1:1 mixture of hydrogen and diborane due to a reduction of Zn2+ to Zn.70 A similar type of metal ion reduction is also observed for the decomposition of Cd(BH4)2.146 Varying mixtures of hydrogen and diborane in the released gas suggests that more than one reaction mechanism is involved. Therefore, the composition of the released gas may depend on physical conditions, such as temperature and hydrogen partial pressure, which may favour a particular competing reaction.
Diborane can react with an ionic hydride and form a metal borohydride via a solid–gas addition reaction as shown for lithium borohydride at T > ∼120 °C, reaction scheme (6.16). At slightly higher temperatures, 150 < T < 200 °C, diborane can further react with lithium borohydride and form metal closo-boranes (MxBnHn), according to reaction schemes (6.17) and (6.18).95,252,405 2LiH(s) + B2H6(g) → 2LiBH4(s)(6.16) 2LiBH4 + 4B2H6 → Li2B10H10 + 11H2(6.17) 2LiBH4 + 5B2H6 → Li2B12H12 + 13H2(6.18)
Boron chemistry is extremely diverse and all neutral boranes, BmHn, can be prepared, directly or indirectly, from diborane with the product mainly depending on the temperature and partial pressure of the reactants.406 Thus, the borane molecule, BH3, may play an active role for hydrogen release and uptake in metal borohydrides. These arguments may suggest that hydrogen release from metal borohydrides occurs via the partial reduction of borane, BH3, via the formation of higher boranes, or complete reduction forming metal borides or amorphous boron. Low total gas pressure may lead to a relatively high partial pressures of diborane, which appears to facilitate the formation of the rather stable metal closo-boranes.361 High partial pressures of hydrogen appear to facilitate the full reduction of BH3 and the formation of metal borides.
6.7 Additives to improve reaction kinetics
The hydrogen release temperatures of the stable metal borohydrides are usually considered too high for practical applications and catalysis has been widely investigated in an attempt to overcome kinetic barriers and reduce the activation energy for hydrogen release and uptake. The more stable metal borohydrides are of particular interest because they appear to have the potential to release pure hydrogen with no trace of diborane. Small amounts of additives have been sought to act as catalysts and promote both hydrogen release and absorption in metal borohydrides. Additives may also promote the formation of metal borides rather than metal closo-boranes, i.e. selective formation of a dehydrogenated state that facilitates absorption of hydrogen at more moderate conditions. The present Section 6.7 focuses on smaller quantities of additives investigated for possible catalytic properties and Section 6.8 treats larger amounts of additives that may purposefully react with the metal borohydride to form a reactive hydride composite.

Additive effects for aluminum and magnesium based hydrides. 
A significant proportion of the research conducted on metal borohydride additives also tends to explore analogies with other hydrides, such as magnesium hydride, MgH2, and sodium tetrahydrido aluminate, denoted sodium alanate, NaAlH4.407–410 Catalytic nanoparticles have enabled breakthroughs in low-temperature hydrogen release and uptake in sodium alanate, NaAlH4.394,411,412 Several metals, such as titanium, scandium or cerium, have been shown to promote both hydrogen release and uptake, undertaking a bifunctional catalytic role.413 Typically, a transition metal chloride is added to NaAlH4, which then irreversibly reacts, forming inert NaCl and catalytically active Al or Ti–Al nanoparticles, possibly with the catalytically active metal on the surface of NaAlH4.412,413
Hydrogen release and uptake in magnesium hydride, MgH2, has been shown to be promoted by other principles. Alloying effects with other metals such as Al, Cu, or Pd and the formation of Mg17Al12, Mg2Cu/MgCu2, or Mg6Pd have been shown to influence hydrogen release and uptake.414–417 Other hydrides may also form and possibly act as an intermediate for hydrogen exchange, e.g. formation of Mg2Ni and Mg2NiH4 in MgH2–Ni samples418–420 or Mg2FeH6 in MgH2–Fe samples.421–425 Another mechanism is suggested for the Mg–Nb2O5 system where MgH2 tends to reduce niobium oxide forming a Mg1−xNbxO solid solution, which possibly facilitates both hydrogen splitting at the surface as well as hydrogen diffusion through the very inert and dense MgO layer. Because of the high hardness of Nb2O5 and other additives these materials have a beneficial effect on the ball-milling process leading to the formation of smaller Mg particles and crystallites, which, in turn, improves kinetics due to surface area or grain boundary area enhancements.426–429 A significant variety of other additives have been investigated in the MgH2 system, including metals, intermetallics, oxides, hydrides and halides.430–432


Additives for metal borohydrides. 
The above mentioned examples have been used as inspiration in the exploration of a wide range of additives for hydrogen release and uptake in metal borohydrides. Trends in additive effects may appear when they are grouped into elements, and compounds such as hydrides, borides, oxides and halides. Mainly lithium and magnesium borohydrides have been examined systematically.


Elemental metallic additives. 
A range of transition metals have been considered as additives in MBH4 systems, e.g. Sc, Ti, V, Cr. Nanoscale transition metal particles are very important in organic chemistry with a long history, involving the chemical transformation of boron compounds, e.g. palladium nanoparticles for catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, forming new C–C bonds. Homo-coupling reactions can also occur, which form new C–B bonds.17 For mono-metallic nanoparticles, the activity follows a sequence of Pd > Cu > Ru > Pt.17
The adsorption of BH4− on the more noble metal surfaces has also been investigated and reveals a weaker interaction with Ag and Au when compared to other noble metals, Pd, Rh, Ru, Pt, Ir and Os. This important result is related to the hydrolysis of borohydrides,433 which is further discussed in Section 6.9. Metal borohydrides may melt prior to the release of hydrogen, which also increases their reactivity. Gold powder was used as an X-ray standard in a sample of LiBH4, but a reaction took place at T > Tmp(LiBH4) ∼ 290 °C and a lithium gold alloy formed.9 A range of metals (Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Sc) have been mixed with LiBH4 in stoichiometric proportions with reported decreases of ∼50 °C in its decomposition temperature.434 However, with high doping levels the entire reaction pathway can be shifted, as in the case of reactive hydride composites, forming alternate reaction products with different reaction thermodynamics.


Elemental non-metallic additives. 
The addition of excess quantities of amorphous boron to LiBH4 was found to enhance the decomposition process by leading to an alternative reaction mechanism, which reduces the decomposition temperature by ΔT ∼ 150 °C and the activation energy by ΔEA ∼ 55 kJ mol−1.435,436 Pendolino et al. propose a reaction of the intermediate Li2B12H12 and B to cause this change in desorption behaviour, by surplus B facilitating faster formation and growth of the solid intermediate by forming a polymer chain or layers with the boron of B12H122−.436


Carbon. 
Carbon has been investigated as an additive to promote hydrogen exchange in metal borohydrides, both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical modelling suggests that increased curvature of the carbon surface decreases the ‘hydrogen removal energy’, i.e. C60 is expected to have a stronger effect in comparison to graphene and graphite.437 Density functional theory (DFT) was used to evaluate a wide range of chemical reactions suggesting the formation of bimetallic carbides, e.g. LiBC in a reaction between LiBH4 and carbon, which releases 11.95 wt% H2 with a moderate reaction enthalpy (ΔU0 = 45.1 kJ mol−1 H2).438 In a similar manner, the formation of Li2C2 was observed in mixtures of LiBH4 with carbon nanotubes, which could be rehydrogenated back to LiH.439 Another example is the reaction between LiBH4, ScH2 and C, which is suggested to form ScB2C and LiH in the decomposed state with a relatively low enthalpy change of ΔU0 ∼ 52 kJ mol−1 H2.438 The ‘carbon-effect’ on metal borohydrides is further discussed in Section 6.10 in regard to nanoconfinement.


Sulphur. 
The reactions between metal borohydrides and elemental sulfur have been investigated in situ during thermal treatment and were found to be highly exothermic (up to 700 J g−1). These reactions are exceptionally rapid and result in the sudden release of substantial quantities of hydrogen gas and should be handled with caution. The metal borohydrides react with molten S at 140, 190 and 180 °C, respectively for LiBH4–S, NaBH4–S and KBH4–S. Remarkably, NaBH4–S release pure hydrogen, whereas LiBH4–S and KBH4–S systems also release some H2S or B2H6 gases.440 The drawback may be the very complex metal sulphur chemistry that results in the formation of multiple complex compounds and intermediates, as observed for the NaAlH4–S system.441 The reaction between metal borohydrides and sulphur could have implications for their use as solid state electrolytes in Li–S battery applications.


Metal hydrides as additives. 
Different types of hydrides have also been considered in order to promote hydrogen exchange in metal borohydrides.434,438,442 Many of these systems alter the decomposition pathway, resulting in altered thermodynamics and are discussed in the following section on reactive hydride composites.


Metal oxides as additives. 
A variety of metal oxides have also been considered to enhance the hydrogen exchange properties of metal borohydrides. This was initiated by the study of glass powders having an effect on lithium borohydride, i.e. LiBH4–SiO2, which enabled hydrogen release at lower temperatures than observed for pure LiBH4.22 However, in situ diffraction shows an irreversible reaction between SiO2 and molten LiBH4 at T > 370 °C and the formation of orthosilicate, Li4SiO4, for small amounts of additive (<10 mol% SiO2, i.e. excess of lithium) and lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) for larger amounts of additive.9 The fate of boron remain unclear but the formation of lithium borates may occur.
A minor change in hydrogen release profile for γ-Mg(BH4)2 with 0.02 mol% TiO2 and MoO3 is observed, i.e. the DSC events appeared broader and were shifted to slightly lower temperatures (ca. 20 °C), as compared to the pure γ-Mg(BH4)2.443 A large decrease in the dehydrogenation temperature was found for stoichiometric ratios of LiBH4 with TiO2 (down to 150 °C), but was due to a redox reaction forming LiTiO2.444 Several transition metal oxides have also been explored, which have some tendency for release of diborane due to reduction of the metal by BH4−, accompanied by the irreversible formation of borates or ternary metal oxides.445,446


Metal fluorides as additives. 
Nickel fluoride, NiF2, tends to react with γ-Mg(BH4)2 and form Ni3B and possibly Mg(B3H8)2, which absorbs hydrogen at moderate conditions to form β-Mg(BH4)2.447 Similarly, the reaction between LiBH4 and TiF3 results in an exothermic reaction to form LiF and TiB2.448 Borofluorides, NaBF4 and KBF4, are described in Section 4 and enable fluoride substitution in metal borohydrides to possibly promote the formation of closo-boranes during thermolysis. In general, fluorides tend to ‘destabilize’ the metal borohydride often by promoting irreversible chemical reactions that tend to form stable metal fluorides, closo-boranes and possibly diborane gas. Halides of Al, Ti, Zr and Hf may form volatile molecular borohydrides, which then sublime and decompose in the gas phase.


Heavier halides: chlorides, bromides and iodides, as additives. 
Heavier halides of metals with relatively low electronegativity (i.e. alkali- and alkali earth metals) may lead to anion substitution in the metal borohydride, as discussed in Section 4. Anion substitution tends to stabilize the hydrogenated state, and provide hydrogen release at slightly higher temperatures, tending to facilitate the hydrogenation of the sample. Titanium trichloride has a well-documented catalytic effect on the hydrogen release and uptake from NaAlH4394,413 and appears to decrease the decomposition temperature of LiBH4.449 A color change from light red/purple to gray/black of a LiBH4–TiCl3 (2 mol%) sample when kept a few hours at RT in an argon-filled glove box indicates that a chemical reaction takes place.9 This chemical reaction can be suppressed when the sample is kept at low temperatures, e.g. T ∼ −35 °C and in situ SR-PXD reveals the formation of LiCl initiated at RT.9 Thus, the reaction between LiBH4 and TiCl3 results in the formation of Ti(BH4)3, which decomposes at room temperature by an unknown mechanism.210 One of the most effective additives was suggested to be LiBH4–0.2MgCl2–0.1TiCl3, which released about 5 wt% H2 at T > 60 °C and absorbed ∼4.5 wt% H2 at T = 600 °C, p(H2) = 70 bar.450 The addition of TiCl3 also changes the hydrogen exchange properties for other metal borohydrides, e.g. Mg(BH4)2.451


Metal borides as additives. 
Metal borides are known as inert materials with high melting points that have also been under consideration as additives. Titanium boride, TiB2, appears to have a limited effect on the decomposition pathway of the LiBH4–1.5Al system, but seems to facilitate the formation of intermediate compounds (i.e. Li–Al–B solid solutions) at lower temperatures compared to samples without an additive.452 Similarly, zirconium boride, ZrB2, appears to stabilize the hydrogen storage capacity for reactive hydride composites, e.g. LiBH4–MgH2, discussed in the following section, possibly by facilitating nucleation and growth of layered magnesium diboride.453


Assessment of additive effects by comparative studies. 
A series of nickel-based materials, Ni powder (30 nm), Ni3B, NiF2 and NiCl2 (2 mol%), have been added to γ-Mg(BH4)2 and the hydrogen storage properties were evaluated.447 EXAFS spectra indicate that NiCl2 and NiF2 react with γ-Mg(BH4)2 and transform to amorphous nickel boride. The γ-Mg(BH4)2–NiF2 sample releases 6.5 wt% gas and the other three samples release 2.7 wt% at moderate conditions, 220 < T < 264 °C, 10 < t < 60 h, under static vacuum. Different side-reactions in the fluoride-containing sample may be responsible for the larger gas release. Spectroscopy suggests the formation of Mg(B3H8)2 in the decomposed sample due to the relatively low thermolysis temperature. The four samples absorb 1–2 wt% H2 at 210 < T < 262 °C, 10 < t < 48 h, and 100 < p(H2) < 155 bar.447
A series of cobalt-based materials Co2B, CoF3, CoCl2 and Co3O4 (2 mol%), have been added to γ-Mg(BH4)2 in a similar manner to the nickel additives.454 Three full cycles of hydrogen release and uptake were conducted and the first cycle, at T ∼ 286 °C, 2.6 < p(H2) < 4 bar, 10 < t < 40 h, releases 3.1–4.4 wt% H2, which is very similar to that of pure γ-Mg(BH4)2, 4.1–4.2 wt% H2. Hydrogen absorption was conducted at 280–290 °C at 110 < p(H2) < 125 bar. The third cycle releases 1.4–2.0 wt% H2 and the kinetics for hydrogen release and uptake is similar to pure γ-Mg(BH4)2.454


General discussion of the effect of additives on metal borohydrides. 
Overall, no real catalyst for B–H bond breaking or formation has been identified. The investigated additives may be divided into either reactive or inert additives. Reactive additives may react irreversibly with metal borohydrides and typically enhance the mass loss from the system in the first hydrogen release cycle. Reactive additives may contain a metal with a relatively high oxidation state and/or electronegativity, which may be reduced during release of diborane and hydrogen. Reactive anions may react irreversibly with the metal borohydride and form metal borates or more stable boranes, e.g. closo-borane. Inert additives may be metals or metal borides. However, the latter may have a beneficial effect and facilitate the crystallization of metal borides in the decomposed state. Small amounts of transition metal compounds like VCl3, ZrCl4 or Zr-isopropoxide added prior to the ball-milling process of reactive hydride composites (discussed in Section 6.8), e.g. 2LiBH4–MgH2 have beneficial kinetic effects. The additives may transform to transition metal boride nanoparticles during thermolysis or aggressive ball-milling, which could facilitate the formation of metal borides in the dehydrogenated state and thereby hydrogen absorption.455
In most cases, only the first dehydrogenation is investigated, which hampers the distinction between irreversible chemical reactions and possible catalytic effects. Chemical reactions often show a significant enhancement of the first hydrogen release reaction, which may occur with faster kinetics and therefore also at apparently lower temperatures. A disadvantage for the use of volumetric or Sievert's methods for measuring the gas release is that measured changes in pressure is converted to an equivalent amount of hydrogen, which is incorrect if gases other than hydrogen are released. A chemical reaction between a reactive additive and a metal borohydride may often be identified by a mass loss, which scales with the amount of additive. Irreversible chemical reactions will lead to significant losses of the hydrogen storage capacity in the first cycle, illustrating the importance of conducting experimental evaluations over several cycles of hydrogen release and uptake.
The available knowledge on the exact mechanism for hydrogen release/uptake remains limited partly owing to difficulties in determining the decomposition products from metal borohydrides, which are often non-crystalline. In several cases, more than one reaction mechanism for hydrogen exchange is proposed, which may change as a function of the physical conditions, e.g. p, T, as discussed in Section 6.2. Thus, the rate determining step in the mechanism remain unknown, which also hampers the design of a catalyst.
Another largely overlooked problem is the fact that many metal borohydrides melt before or during hydrogen release. Fusion eliminates the grain structure and reduces the surface area of multicomponent samples. The partly molten state of the metal borohydride – additive system usually has a relatively high viscosity, thus a gas release leads to bubbling, foaming and possible phase segregation, which further limits reversibility and the use of catalysts.

6.8 Reactive hydride composites
Larger amounts of additives may lead to stoichiometric reactions among the components in a system, denoted Reactive Hydride Composites (RHC). P. Chen (China) was first to apply this approach to nitrogen containing systems like Mg(NH2)2–2LiH.456 Later the approach was extended to borohydride containing systems by J. J. Vajo (USA), Y. W. Cho (South Korea) and R. Bormann (Germany).37,39,42 Several systems combining metal borohydrides and magnesium hydride have been studied intensively during the past decade, e.g. LiBH4–MgH2, NaBH4–MgH2 and Ca(BH4)2–MgH2.37,38,457 A chemical reaction takes place between two or more components during decomposition, which lowers the overall reaction enthalpy (Fig. 25). This concept is analogous to Medima principles applied to d-block metals and the well-known Hess law from chemistry. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity is then the weighted average of the individual hydrogen storage capacity of the components of the RHC system.8 In the following, selected RHC systems are discussed in more detail and Table 19 provides an overview of the thermodynamic data.

Lithium borohydride–magnesium hydride, 2LiBH4–MgH2. 
The reactive hydride composite lithium borohydride–magnesium hydride releases and absorbs hydrogen under less harsh conditions (p, T, t) compared to the individual components. This is due to an exothermic formation of MgB2 during the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction of the 2LiBH4–MgH2 system, i.e. a chemical reaction between LiBH4 and Mg, which leads to hydrogen release, the formation of LiH and a reduction of the total reaction enthalpy, see reaction scheme (6.19). In addition, hydrogen uptake from MgB2–2LiH occurs at more moderate conditions than for the decomposition products from pure LiBH4, i.e. amorphous boron, lithium boride and/or higher boranes like Li2B12H12.37 This is caused by the open layered structure of MgB2 as well as the non-covalent bonding between Mg and B in MgB2.466 The full reversibility of the 2LiBH4–MgH2 system is reported to only be obtained when the decomposition occurs in a hydrogen back pressure of p(H2) ∼ 1–5 bar, which facilitates the formation of MgB2 by suppressing the individual decomposition of LiBH4 and MgH2.39,467,468
The phase diagram has recently been investigated for the 2LiBH4–MgH2 system from a comprehensive pressure–composition-isotherm study.469 It was shown that there is a single equilibrium pressure plateau below 413 °C represented by reaction (6.19a), but there are two plateaus above 413 °C represented by reaction (6.19b). A similar phenomena exists for NaMgH2F.240 2LiBH4 + MgH2 ↔ 2LiH + MgB2 + 4H2(6.19a) 2LiBH4 + MgH2 ↔ 2LiBH4 + Mg + H2 ↔ 2LiH + MgB2 + 4H2(6.19b)
A calculation of the decomposition enthalpy change yields ΔHdec ∼ 40–46 kJ mol−1 H2, corresponding to T(1 bar) ∼ 169 °C.39,41,469 A similar reaction occurs for a magnesium-rich system, e.g. 0.3LiBH4–MgH2 that decomposes to MgB2 in p(H2) > 1 bar.470,471 In contrast, the system LiBH4–MgH2 (0.3:1) and (2:1) decompose through a different reaction in dynamic vacuum forming α- and β-alloys of MgxLi1−x, x ∼ 0.82 and 0.70, respectively.470,472 Hydrogen absorption also occurs at rather low pressures and temperatures p(H2) < 50 bar and T < 300 °C. These conditions are substantially more favourable than those for LiBH4 and are considered a breakthrough in utilizing borohydrides for reversible hydrogen storage.
The kinetics for hydrogen release and uptake reactions can be significantly enhanced by the addition of suitable additives, e.g. small amounts of transition metal compounds like VCl3, ZrCl4 or Zr-isopropoxide. Initially, the additives have a beneficial effect on the ball-milling process through the reduction of grain and particle sizes and thereby reducing hydrogen diffusion pathways.455 Further investigations using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and anomalous small angle scattering (ASAXS) measurements indicate the formation of the respective transition metal boride nanoparticles during aggressive ball-milling or subsequent thermolysis.453,455,473 The transition metal compounds with the best enhancement of reaction kinetics for RHC systems form transition metal borides with small directional and interplanar misfits to MgB2 by 0.1 and 2.8%. Thus, these transition metal borides may act as favorable heterogeneous nucleation sites for the formation of the MgB2 during decomposition.453 Therefore, hydrogen absorption kinetics are significantly faster when compared to RHC without additives. Nanoscale MgH2 synthesized via an organometallic method and used as a starting component appears to suppress the formation of closo-boranes, e.g. [B12H12]2−.474


Sodium borohydride–magnesium hydride, 2NaBH4–MgH2. 
Sodium borohydride readily forms by the hydrogenation of a 2NaH–MgB2 composite, see reaction (6.20).37 The composite 2NaH–MgB2 has a calculated gravimetric hydrogen capacity of ρm = 7.8 wt% H2, and reaction enthalpy of ΔH = 62 kJ mol−1 H2, corresponding to a decomposition temperature of T(1 bar) = 350 °C.459 Hydrogenation of the 2NaH–MgB2 composite also occurs at low pressure i.e. p(H2) = 25 bar (t = 63 h) at 400 °C where 6.2 wt% H2 is absorbed.475 Hydrogenation starts at T ∼ 250 °C but appears to become more complex at lower hydrogen pressures, proceeding via an unknown compound and NaMgH3.475 2NaBH4 + MgH2 ↔ 2NaH + MgB2 + 4H2(6.20)
The decomposition pathway of 2NaBH4–MgH2 RHC system appears to be a two-step reaction similar to 2LiBH4–MgH2, see reaction scheme (6.19b). However, the reactivity appears to be lower and some NaBH4 often remains in the sample after the reaction with Mg to form MgB2.476


Calcium borohydride–magnesium hydride, Ca(BH4)2–MgH2. 
The calculated gravimetric hydrogen capacity for the Ca(BH4)2–MgH2 system is ρm = 8.3 wt% H2 and it shows a complex reaction pathway with a number of intermediates, e.g. formation of CaB6, Ca4Mg3H14 and other Ca–B–H compounds.338,477–479 The idealized hydrogenation reaction takes place as illustrated in reaction scheme (6.21), which can take place at p(H2) = 140 bar and T = 250 °C, CaH2 + MgB2 + 4H2 → Ca(BH4)2 + MgH2(6.21)
Until now, only partial reversibility has been obtained, however, transition metal-based additives facilitate the formation of MgB2 in the Ca(BH4)2–MgH2 system in a similar way to the LiBH4–MgH2 system.250,463


Lithium borohydride–aluminium, 2LiBH4–Al. 
Access to the hydrogen content of LiBH4 may be facilitated by the addition of a reactive metal, e.g. the 2LiBH4–Al system. The 2LiBH4–Al composite is more prone to rehydrogenation when compared to LiBH4, e.g. at T = 400 °C and p(H2) = 100 bar.471,480–483 In fact, the 2LiBH4–Al, 2NaBH4–Al and CaBH4–Al systems can all be hydrogenated under 100 bar at 350–400 °C, but better kinetics are obtained under 600 bar.464 However, cycling of hydrogen release and uptake in 2LiBH4–Al has shown that the system suffers from a significant degradation in hydrogen storage capacity.452,484,485 The composite 2LiBH4–Al has been suggested to release hydrogen in two steps at T < 500 °C represented by reaction schemes:471,480–483 2LiBH4(l) + Al(s) → AlB2(s) + 2LiH(s) + 3H2(g)(6.22) LiH(s) + Al(s) → LiAl(s) + 0.5H2(g)(6.23)
The enthalpy change for reaction (6.22) is calculated as ΔH = −59.3 kJ mol−1 H2,486 which corresponds to T(1 bar) = 166 °C.483Reactions (6.22) and (6.23) illustrate that the full H2 capacity of LiBH4 (ρm = 18.3 wt% H2) can be utilized for the composite of LiBH4–1.5Al. However, the addition of Al lowers the gravimetric H2 capacity of this composite to only ρm = 6.5 wt% H2.
The decomposition of LiBH4–Al results in the formation of LiAl, AlB2 and Li2B12H12via several reactions and intermediate compounds. Apparently, there is significant formation of Li2B12H12, rather than a diborane release or amorphous boron production.452 The hydrogen storage capacity reduces significantly over ten cycles of hydrogen release and uptake for the reactive composite LiBH4–1.5Al, see Fig. 26.452

Dehydrogenation was conducted by heating to 300 °C (ΔT/Δt = 10 °C min−1) and subsequently to 500 °C (ΔT/Δt = 1 °C min−1), and then kept at 500 °C for 150 min at p(H2) ∼ 10−2 bar.

Lithium borohydride–sodium alanate composite, LiBH4–NaAlH4. 
Other metal hydrides have also been explored as possible Al sources, e.g. the system, 2LiBH4–NaAlH4, ρm = 11.9 wt% H2.484 However, the samples prepared by ball milling reveal diffraction from both LiAlH4 and NaBH4, due to a metathesis reaction (6.24).487 LiBH4(s) + NaAlH4(s) → LiAlH4(s) + NaBH4(s)(6.24)
Several (coupled) chemical reactions are involved in hydrogen release and uptake. NaBH4 decomposes at a much lower temperature than normal, at ∼340 °C, after which some Na vapour is also released due to dynamic vacuum, leaving a LiAl alloy and amorphous boron in the solid state. Sodium borohydride, NaBH4, only partly decomposes to B and NaH at T = 400 °C under p(H2) ∼ 1 bar. The formation of AlB2 is observed at T = 450 °C along with AlBx or Al1−xLixB2, which stabilizes boron in the solid state. The LiBH4–NaAlH4 system is partially reversible and LiBH4 was rehydrogenated under moderate conditions, T = 400 °C and p(H2) = 110 bar. During hydrogenation, the diffracted intensity from LiAl decreases at T ∼ 200 °C and the formation of LiH and Al is observed, while the consumption of AlB2 occurs at T ∼ 280 °C. Crystalline h-LiBH4 forms upon cooling at T ∼ 260 °C. Apparently, the loss of sodium vapour prevents the formation of sodium alanate.484


The lithium borohydride–magnesium hydride–aluminium system LiBH4–MgH2–Al. 
Several reactive hydride composites (RHC) may also be combined to form more complex systems, e.g. the LiBH4–MgH2 and LiBH4–Al RHC systems are combined to form LiBH4–MgH2–Al,465 which has an even lower decomposition temperature via another mechanism and results in the formation of MgxAl1−xB2 as shown in the idealized reaction scheme:465 2LiBH4(s) + xMgH2(s) + (1 − x)Al(s) → 2LiH(s) + MgxAl1−xB2(s) + (4 + x)H2(g)(6.25)
The hydrogen storage capacity of the LiBH4–MgH2–Al system decreases upon continuous hydrogen cycling (see Table 20). Boron in the hydrogenated sample 4LiBH4–MgH2–Al exists as Li2B12H12 (19.1 mol%) and LiBH4 (80.9 mol%) after three cycles of hydrogen release and uptake, when dehydrogenated in low hydrogen pressure, p(H2) = 0.15 bar. However, the ratio Li2B12H12–LiBH4 is only 8.7:91.3 mol% when the sample is dehydrogenated at p(H2) = 5.0 bar. For the sample 4LiBH4–MgH2–5Al only 2.4 mol% Li2B12H12 and 97.6 mol% LiBH4 is formed using the higher dehydrogenation partial pressure of hydrogen, p(H2) = 5.0 bar. These results show that both sample composition and hydrogen partial pressure, e.g. p(H2) > 1 bar, during thermolysis is crucial to suppress the formation of more stable closo-boranes, Li2B12H12, and thereby preserve the hydrogen storage capacity.

Manganese borohydride–metal hydrides. 
Mn(BH4)2 is an interesting candidate for hydrogen storage, owing to its high stability at room temperature, low decomposition temperature of 130–180 °C, high theoretical hydrogen capacity of 9.5 wt% H2 and the high abundance of manganese in the lithosphere. A drawback for the utilization of Mn(BH4)2 is that the gas released during decomposition contains high levels of diborane. The mechanism for decomposition remains not fully understood, in particular the possible side reactions that produce diborane.488 Thus, the hydrogen storage capacity is expected to decrease due to the loss of boron from the system during continued hydrogen release and uptake in manganese borohydride. In the reactive hydride composites, Mn(BH4)2–MHx (M = Li, Na, Mg, Ca), the formation of the more stable M(BH4)x for M = Li, Na and Ca suppresses the release of diborane and provides a higher hydrogen content in the released gas during the decomposition (Fig. 27).489

Bimetallic transition metal hydrides. 
Reactive hydride composites including Mg2NiH4, Mg2FeH6etc. have also been explored to promote hydrogen release and uptake in metal borohydrides. The first example was discovered by J. J. Vajo (US, 2010), LiBH4–Mg2NiH4, which reversibly stores hydrogen at moderate conditions, ΔH = 15.4 ± 2 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 62.2 ± 3 J K−1 mol−1 H2.490 This is due to the formation of a bimetallic boride in the decomposed state, see reaction (6.26), which also absorbs hydrogen at moderate condition. 4LiBH4 + 5Mg2NiH4 → 2MgNi2.5B2 + 4LiH + 8MgH2 + 8H2(6.26)
This result suggests that there could be other similar systems because there are numerous complex transition metal hydride anions including [FeH6]4−, [CoH5]4−, and [NiH4]4−.490–492 The magnesium iron hydride–lithium borohydride system also stores hydrogen reversibly but forms a monometallic boride, FeB, in the decomposed state. 2Mg2FeH6 + 2LiBH4 → 2LiH + 4MgH2 + 2FeB + 5H2(6.27)
The enthalpy change for this system is slightly larger, ΔH = 72 ± 4 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔS = 147 ± 7 J K−1 mol−1 H2, and occurs in the temperature range 310–400 °C.493


Yttrium hydride. 
The reactive hydride composite, 4LiBH4–YH3 releases ∼7 wt% H2 at T ∼ 350 °C following reaction scheme (6.28), which corresponds to a calculated hydrogen content of ρm = 8.5 wt% H2.494 4LiBH4 + YH3 → 4LiH + YB4 + 7.5H2(6.28)
This reaction is reversible at relatively mild rehydrogenation conditions, e.g. T = 350 °C and p(H2) = 90 bar.468 Also, a hydrogen pressure of e.g. p(H2) = 90 bar facilitates the formation of metal borides during decomposition.494
Rare earth metal hydrides are also used as additives, in 6LiBH4–MH2 composites (M = La, Ce), which provide hydrogen release after LiBH4 melting, but below its normal dehydrogenation temperature.495 PCT measurements performed on 6LiBH4–CeH2 provide thermodynamic data for the decomposition reaction ΔHdec = 58 ± 3 kJ mol−1 H2 and ΔSdec = 113 ± 4 J K−1 mol−1 H2 corresponding to T(1 bar) = 240 ± 32 °C.496 The change in thermodynamics suggests the formation of a reactive hydride composite.


Summary. 
The concept to lower both the total reaction enthalpy and thus the hydrogen release temperatures of hydride-borohydride mixtures (RHC) is currently working. In some cases, quite astonishing properties are found, such as enhanced absorption kinetics, in spite of a lowered driving force for absorption, however, the progress reached so far is limited. The sorption temperatures are still too high for many technical applications. Less stable borohydrides, decomposing at lower temperatures, show not only the release of hydrogen but also diborane, as mentioned above. To reach a significant breakthrough hydrides and/or reactive additives have to be found that react (reversibly) with the borohydrides at much lower temperatures and thereby capture the boron and prevent the release of diborane or the production of higher boranes.

6.9 Hydrolysis – decomposition by reaction with water
In an alternative process to thermal decomposition, hydrogen can also be released from hydrides in a reaction with water, denoted hydrolysis.497 An advantage is that half of the released hydrogen originates from the water and increases the hydrogen capacity of the system.30,498,499 Sodium borohydride can be stabilized in basic solution with a typical composition of 20% NaBH4 and 1% NaOH (solubility of NaBH4 is 55 g per 100 mL at 20 °C). The hydrolysis reaction is controlled by a catalyst, e.g. a late transition metal, such as Ru. The catalytic effect of Pt for the generation of H2 from BH4− hydrolysis was discovered in the early 1960s and this reaction has been extensively investigated on a variety of high-surface area catalysts such as Pt–C.500 DFT calculations indicate that the hydrolysis reaction takes place for BH4− co-adsorbed with H2O on a surface.433
The low concentration of NaBH4 reduces the storage capacity of the system to 4 wt% H2. The product obtained from hydrolysis is sodium metaborate NaBO2 and hydrogen, see reaction (6.29). The concentration of the reactants should be kept sufficiently low in order to prevent precipitation of NaBO2, which may block the catalytic active sites (the solubility of NaBO2 in water is 26 g per 100 mL at 20 °C).501 NaBH4(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 4H2(g) + NaBO2(s)(6.29)
A significant drawback of the hydrolysis approach is that the dehydrogenated product is typically a stable oxide, e.g. sodium metaborate NaBO2, with a heat of formation of ΔHf = −1058 kJ mol−1. The heat of formation for NaBH4, ΔHf = −191 kJ mol−1 is significantly less negative, illustrating that a large amount of energy is required for the preparation of NaBH4 from NaBO2, e.g. from a reaction using molten magnesium. Thus, hydrolysis often provides hydrogen at RT, but is considered difficult to reverse because off-board regeneration is needed.30
6.10 Nanoconfinement
Nanoparticles may have significantly different properties compared to bulk materials due to (i) increased surface area, (ii) nanoscale diffusion distances, (iii) increased numbers of atoms in the grain boundaries and (iv) intimate contact between different reacting solids, or a melt.502,503 These nanoscale properties facilitate the release and uptake of hydrogen and enhance reaction kinetics. Thermodynamic properties may also be improved and theoretical studies predict that the increased surface area to bulk volume destabilizes MgH2 nanoparticles and thereby reduces the reaction enthalpy.323,503–506 However, thermodynamic improvements are suggested to occur only for MgH2 nanoparticles with sizes less than ∼5 nm, while kinetic enhancement also occurs for larger nanoparticles below ∼50 nm.323,506–508 The most widely used technique for the preparation of hydride nanoparticles is probably mechanochemical treatment, i.e. ball milling. In this top-down approach the size of the bulk material is reduced mechanically, in some cases to <100 nm. However, the samples are often contaminated with trace material from the vial and balls,52 and are challenging to characterize.509 Furthermore, nanosized particles may grow into larger particles upon continuous hydrogen release and uptake reactions. Nano materials may be directly synthesized and stabilized in a nanoporous scaffold, denoted nanoconfinement, which is discussed below.

Nanoconfinement. 
The topic for this section is the utilization of nanoporous materials as scaffolds for the preparation and confinement of nanosized metal borohydrides. This bottom-up approach limits the particle size of the borohydride to the pore size of the scaffold material, which allows direct production of smaller particles than mechanically obtainable. Furthermore, particle growth and agglomeration may be hindered by the compartmentalization of nanoparticles within the scaffold material and may also limit the mobility of the decomposition products and keep them in intimate close contact. Thereby, nanoconfinement may improve hydrogen absorption properties of metal hydrides. Phase segregation of decomposition products upon bulk dehydrogenation can limit hydrogen uptake reactions, which can be circumvented with nanoconfinement. A large amount of heat may also be exchanged during hydrogen release and uptake in metal hydrides and heat transport may be a kinetic limiting factor. Metal hydride powders have low thermal conductivities of ∼0.1 W m−1 K−1 in contrast to carbon based support materials, which can have high thermal conductivities, e.g. 12–75 W m−1 K−1 for graphite.510 Nanoconfined chemistry is receiving increasing general interest and is becoming an important tool within several research areas.502,511–515 The aim of the following is to highlight selected results obtained by the nanoconfinement of metal borohydrides.


Nanoconfinement of lithium borohydride, LiBH4. 
Lithium borohydride can be melt infiltrated in ordered mesoporous SiO2 scaffolds (Dmax ∼ 5–10 nm), e.g. at T ∼ 295 °C, and high hydrogen pressure, e.g. p(H2) = 100 bar, can suppress a reaction with the scaffold, which would otherwise produce lithium silicates, Li2SiO3 or Li4SiO4.516
Lithium borohydride has a higher stability when nanoconfined in carbon materials and absorbs hydrogen at significantly more mild conditions when compared to bulk LiBH4. Lithium borohydride, solvent infiltrated in mesoporous carbon scaffolds (Dmax ∼ 4 nm), releases hydrogen at T ∼ 300 °C.510 About 70% of the initial hydrogen content is released during the third hydrogen release cycle for LiBH4, confined in microporous activated carbon (Davg < 2 nm), when hydrogen absorption is conducted at p(H2) = 100 bar, T = 400 °C for two hours. A lower stability of the hydrogen storage capacity is observed for scaffolds with larger pores, e.g. carbon aerogel, Davg = 25 nm, where LiBH4 only releases 40% of the initial hydrogen content in the third release cycle. However, the observed increase in hydrogen release and uptake rates with decreasing pore size may be a kinetic effect, which may also contribute to the apparently higher cyclic stability. The hydrogen storage capacity appears to be stabilized and preserved to a higher degree for nanoconfined systems in comparison to bulk systems. This effect may be associated with a different hydrogen exchange mechanism due to the nanoconfinement of reactants and decomposition products, i.e. Li2B12H12, Li2B10B10, or LiBx.516–519 However, systematic investigation into the effect of varying pore sizes suggests that diborane release and the formation of closo-boranes may be reduced using carbon scaffolds with smaller pores.520


Nanoconfinement of sodium borohydride, NaBH4. 
Sodium borohydride has a high decomposition temperature, Tdec > 500 °C, with an onset at ∼470 °C, which may be reduced to 250 °C upon nanoconfinement in porous carbon. Here, 43% of the hydrogen content is reversible under mild conditions p(H2) = 60 bar, T = 325 °C for five hours.521 Encapsulation of NaBH4 nanoparticles by a Ni layer, forming a core shell nanostructure, provides effective nanoconfinement of the molten NaBH4 core and the dehydrogenation products. These nanostructures have high stability and were cycled 5 times with hydrogen release (p(H2) = 1 mbar) and uptake (p(H2) = 40 bar) at T = 350 °C, demonstrating a hydrogen capacity of 5 wt% where ca. 80% of the H2 capacity was exchanged within 1 h.522


Nanoconfinement of magnesium borohydride, Mg(BH4)2. 
The synthesis of Mg(BH4)2/carbon nanocomposites from MgH2 nanoparticles supported on carbon aerogel in a B2H6/H2 atmosphere has been conducted.523 The nanocomposite exhibits a lower kinetic barrier and a lower peak hydrogen release temperature, T = 160 °C, when compared to bulk Mg(BH4)2. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake occurs at mild conditions, T = 200 °C and p(H2) = 80–150 bar.523 Magnesium borohydride has also been infiltrated into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) functionalized by Ni nanoparticles (5 wt%).524 The hydrogen release temperature was significantly decreased with onset at T = 75 °C and peak release at T = 155 °C, compared to 270 °C and >350 °C, respectively, for pure Mg(BH4)2. Hydrogen release also occurs with faster kinetics in the nanoconfined system.524


Lithium–potassium borohydride, LiBH4–KBH4. 
Eutectic melting, reactive hydride composites and nanoconfinement all have the potential to improve the reversible hydrogen storage capacity in metal borohydrides. The combined effect of all three methods has been explored in an attempt to improve the lithium–potassium borohydride system, 0.725LiBH4–0.275KBH4, which has a low melting temperature Tm = 105 °C.48 The bulk eutectic mixture and the RHC with magnesium, LiBH4–KBH4–Mg and LiBH4–KBH4–MgH2, have been melt-infiltrated into a nanoporous carbon scaffold. The decomposition of 0.725LiBH4–0.275KBH4 (and the RHC) initiates simultaneously with melting at 105 °C, but remains slow until higher temperatures are reached T > 300 °C. Eutectic melting appears to improve the kinetics of the hydrogen de- and absorption, while nanoconfinement lowers the main hydrogen release temperature in the first cycle by up to 200 °C.48


Lithium–magnesium borohydride, LiBH4–Mg(BH4)2. 
The decomposition of nanoconfined lithium–magnesium borohydride, Li11BD4–Mg(11BD4)2, was investigated by thermal analysis and small-angle neutron scattering.525 The dehydrogenation temperature was decreased by up to 60 °C in the nanoconfined system and occurred without the formation of diborane, B2D6, or closo-boranes, which evolve from the bulk mixture.525


Lithium–calcium borohydride, LiBH4–Ca(BH4)2. 
Eutectic melting LiBH4–Ca(BH4)2 has been nanoconfined in different types of carbon scaffolds with surface areas 500 to 2600 m2 g−1 and pore sizes 5–50 nm. In general, the nanoconfined systems provide faster kinetics and higher stability over several cycles of hydrogen release and uptake, which also occurs at more mild conditions.369,526–528 Nanoconfined LiBH4–Ca(BH4)2 in CO2-activated scaffolds release up to 80 or 73% of the calculated hydrogen content in the second and third hydrogen release cycle, respectively. They can potentially reach hydrogen storage densities in the range ∼10–12 wt% H2 for scaffolds with large pore volumes, 3.1 mL g−1, and large surface areas, 2660 ± 208 m2 g−1.527


Reactive hydride composites, 2LiBH4–MgH2. 
The first nanoconfined reactive hydride composite (RHC) 2LiBH4–MgH2 was infiltrated in a nanoporous RF-CA scaffold (Davg ∼ 21 nm) in an attempt to combine the beneficial effect from nanoconfinement and RHC.529 The onset temperature for hydrogen release is reduced by 90 °C and the nanoconfined sample desorbed 3.9 wt% H2 at 390 °C, p(H2) = 2 bar after 20 h, in accordance with the calculated hydrogen content for the sample of 3.9 wt% H2. The hydrogen absorption was performed under relatively mild conditions and the fourth desorption released 3.0 wt% H2, i.e. 92 and 74% of the capacity is preserved over three and four cycles, respectively.529 Similar results were obtained with other methods for infiltration and other scaffold materials.492,530,531 However, improved capacity as been achieved for 2LiBH4–MgH2 encapsulated within graphene, where an impressive reversible capacity of 8.9 wt% H2 is reported after 25 cycles at 350 °C.532
Functionalization of nanoporous scaffolds may further improve kinetics during hydrogen release and uptake. The stability during cycling was explored for TiCl3,533 TiCl4534 and ZrCl4.535 Several other composites based on lithium borohydride have also been successfully nanoconfined, e.g. 2LiBH4–NaAlH4,536 LiBH4–Mg2NiH4537 and LiBH4–NaBH4.538

7. New properties and future perspectives of metal borohydrides
Metal borohydrides have diverse compositions with overwhelmingly rich structural chemistry, which has led to new perspectives for the future utilization of this fascinating class of new materials. Furthermore, a wide range of approaches for tailoring the composition and structure of metal borohydrides was discussed in previous sections, along with the effect of additives, reactive hydride composites and nanoconfinement etc., in Section 6. This section provides the state-of-the-art for new perspectives on the utilization of metal borohydrides for practical applications, in addition to those involving their extreme energy densities. This chapter reveals multiple novel properties for metal borohydrides, e.g. optical, magnetic, ion or semi conductivity.
7.1 Porous metal borohydrides for gas adsorption
The extreme structural flexibility found for metal borohydrides is highlighted by magnesium borohydride, as described in detail in Section 3.1. The γ polymorph has 33% ‘empty space’ and a 3D network of interpenetrated channels with pore sizes in the range 5.8–8.8 Å, being the first complex metal hydride with large permanent porosity.3 Furthermore, it is the first complex metal hydride capable of reversibly adsorbing hydrogen, nitrogen and other small molecules such as CH2Cl2. The adsorption of dichloromethane, CH2Cl2 is reversible and fast (within minutes), occurring near room temperature with negligible unit cell expansion, forming γ-Mg(BH4)2·0.18CH2Cl2. Here, the only host–guest contacts are the dihydrogen bonds B–Hδ−⋯δ+H–C of 1.9 and 2.0 Å. There are neither substantial guest–guest interactions nor coordination of the guest to the metal atom (Mg⋯H–C 3.5 Å, Mg⋯Cl ∼ 4 Å). The host–guest interactions illustrate the selectivity of the anionic borohydride groups being capable of binding positively charged moieties. Neutral molecules such as nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) also adsorb in the γ-Mg(BH4)2 framework at elevated pressure and low temperature. In situ SR-PXD data revealed storage capacities of γ-Mg(BH4)2·0.63N2 at p(N2) = 30.6 bar and γ-Mg(BH4)2·0.80H2 at p(H2) = 105 bar at −193 °C. The latter corresponds to a total of 17.4 wt% H2, including the hydrogen in the framework.3 Nitrogen or hydrogen molecules are grouped into diffuse rods within the structure, centered around (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) and extended along the cube diagonal (x, x, x), which indicates van der Waals interactions occur between gas molecules and BH4 groups. The desorption isobars (p(H2) = 105 bar, p(N2) = 30.6 bar) indicate that the gas molecules are leaving the framework at relatively high temperatures; desorption of hydrogen starts at −143 °C, with ∼50% H2 remaining inside the pores at −73 °C. This suggests the potential for efficient hydrogen storage in related materials at moderate temperatures. The isosteric heats of adsorption, Qst, of nitrogen and hydrogen in γ-Mg(BH4)2 were determined to be: Qst(N2) ∼ 15 kJ mol−1 and Qst(H2) ∼ 6 kJ mol−1 (average value), with Qst > 7 kJ mol−1 at a loading of 15 mg H2 g−1.3 The latter value is among the highest values measured for MOFs and other porous solids.539
The structural similarity between metal borohydride frameworks and covalently bonded metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated by the significant degree of directionality in the interaction between a metal and the complex borohydride anion. In particular, the same framework topology is observed for both γ-Mg(BH4)2 and the zinc imidazolate framework ZIF-72,3,540 and several metal borohydrides have interpenetrated framework structures similar to MOFs, e.g. MZn2(BH4)5 (M = Li and Na) and Li3MZn5(BH4)15 (M = Mg, Mn). Although, there are other borohydrides that mimic the tetrahedral framework of cristobalite, such as δ-Mg(BH4)2, or α- and β-Cd(BH4)2. γ-Mg(BH4)2 shares gas adsorption properties with MOFs and also shares an ‘amorphous’ to ‘crystalline’ phase transition at elevated pressures. However, metal borohydride frameworks give rise to specific guest–host interactions with hydridic atoms of the BH4− anion, which do not occur in MOFs.
7.2 Metal borohydrides as ion conductors
Hydrides of intermetallic compounds such as LaNi5H6 have widely been used as electrodes in rechargeable batteries, replacing toxic metal Cd in the Ni–Cd pair. Following the report on the conversion reaction of the redox couple MgH2/Li541 many other complex metal hydrides have been studied as battery electrodes.7,542,543 The use of borohydrides in batteries is very recent, and is actually limited to solid-state electrolytes (Fig. 28). This is despite several reactions having been proposed theoretically by ab initio calculations for conversion electrodes in Li-batteries, including a promising reaction, based on Mg(BH4)2, that results in an enormous theoretical charge capacity of 3969 mA h g−1.544 The numerous advantages of metal borohydrides as battery materials include their light weight (high charge density), apparent material compatibility with Li and Na electrodes, thermal and electrochemical stability, and easy manufacturing of the electrolyte/electrode interface and thus of the whole battery.

Fast Li-ion conduction in a borohydride was first discovered in the high temperature polymorph h-LiBH4,545 where conductivities exceeding 2 × 10−3 S cm−1 above 110 °C (the polymorphic transition temperature) were reported. Since then, several other solid-state metal-borohydride and borohydride-based mixed-anion electrolytes have been developed that exhibit fast Li- and Na-ion conduction.49

Lithium borohydride halides as Li-ion conductors. 
Above the polymorphic transition temperature of 110 °C, the Li ion conductivity of the HT-polymorph h-LiBH4 is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the RT-orthorhombic polymorph, o-LiBH4. It was shown that anion substitution BH4− ↔ X− (X− = Halide) stabilizes the h-LiBH4 polymorph down to room temperature, e.g. h-Li(BH4)1−xIx.551 The RT Li-ion conductivity in the halide stabilized h-LiBH4 reaches 2 × 10−5 S cm−1.550

Recently, a new series of mixed-cation mixed-anion borohydride chlorides based on rare-earths elements, LiM′(BH4)3Cl, M′ = La, Gd, and Ce, was discovered using combined mechanochemical synthesis and heat treatment from M′Cl3–LiBH4 (1:3) mixtures.4,88 This growing class of materials has a new structure type and contains isolated tetranuclear anionic clusters [M4Cl4(BH4)12]4− with a distorted cubane M4Cl4 core, charge-balanced by Li+ cations. This compound can also be understood as containing fragments of the spinel structure, i.e. LiCl4 tetrahedra and M4Cl4 cubane. The Li+ ions are disordered and occupy 2/3 of the 12d Wyckoff sites and DFT calculations indicate that LiCe(BH4)3Cl is stabilized by larger entropy rather than smaller enthalpy. Thus, the structural model and DFT calculations agree well with the very high lithium ion conductivity measured for LiCe(BH4)3Cl, 1.03 × 10−4 S cm−1 at T = 20 °C. The other members of this series of isostructural compounds, LiLa(BH4)3Cl and LiGd(BH4)3Cl, also have high Li-ion conductivities at RT and low electronic conductivities, see Table 21. This class of materials, LiM(BH4)3Cl, holds significant potential in the design of other new ion conductors, which is not yet fully explored. Cation and anion substitution may allow for the preparation of new sodium or magnesium ion conductors.

Other borohydride-based mixed-anion ion conductors. 
Some metal amides and imides are good ion conductors, such as lithium imide Li2NH with an excellent solid-state Li-ion conductivity at RT (2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1), but with very low electrochemical stability, 0.7 V.552 Addition reactions between nitrogen-based compounds and metal borohydrides have therefore been studied, leading to several novel solid state electrolytes such as Li2(BH4)(NH2) and Li4(BH4)(NH2)389 with Li-ion conductivities of up to 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at RT. The disordered anti-perovskite Na2(BH4)(NH2) was also recently shown to have a Na-ion conductivity of 2 × 10−6 S cm−1 at RT,553 and Mg-ion conductivity in tetragonal Mg(BH4)(NH2) reaches 1 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 150 °C.270


Alkali rare-earth garnet borohydrides as Li-ion conductors. 
The oxide-borohydride analogy,193 is a new tool for the design of novel materials with useful properties, clearly illustrated by the recently discovery of metal borohydride-garnets. Metal borohydride-garnets were synthesized,168 based on the fact that doped lanthanide-oxide garnets Li3+xLa3M2O12 (where M denotes various metals) are excellent Li-ion conductors.554 The new metal borohydride garnet analogues, Li3K3Ce2(BH4)12 and Li3K3La2(BH4)12 show high room temperature Li-ion conductivity (3 × 10−7 and 6 × 10−7 S cm−1). Most importantly, these values are 5 to 6 orders of magnitude above those of undoped metal oxide garnet conductors. The effect of heterovalent cation substitution was investigated as a means of tailoring the ion conductivity. Substitution with divalent Sr2+ and Eu2+ showed that the Li-ion conductivity can be increased by one order of magnitude in the whole temperature range measured.168


Higher-boranes and mixed anion higher borane-borohydrides as Li- and Na-ion conductors. 
Higher boranes such as B10H102− or B12H122− form inorganic salts which, in the case of Na- and Li-based compounds, are good ionic conductors when the cations become disordered in HT-phases,546,547,555 and are the focus of a recent review.252 The Na-ion conductivity of Na2B12H12 increases by 3 orders of magnitude between the phase transition from the ordered monoclinic phase to the disordered cubic phase at 256 °C, and reaches a conductivity value of close to 0.1 S cm−1.546 The concept of anion-mixing was applied to this novel class of solid electrolytes generating Na3BH4B12H12 and (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12, capable of conducting either Na+ or both Na+ and Li+ ions.256 Unlike order–disorder governed dodeca- and decaboranes the cationic mobility is not entropically activated in Na3BH4B12H12 and (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12, thus a HT phase transition is not required to enable fast ion conduction. Na3BH4B12H12 reaches RT conductivity values close to 10−3 S cm−1. (Li0.7Na0.3)3BH4B12H12, on the other hand, forms only by a reversible chemical reaction at 230 °C, which is accompanied by a dramatic increase in ionic conductivity >10−1 S cm−1. Such high temperatures are nevertheless within reasonable limits for large-scale facilities, which operate at over 300 °C in the case of Na–S power grids, for instance.


The paddle-wheel mechanism for ion conduction. 
Many potential solid-state ionic conductors can be rationally designed from salts containing dynamically disordered complex anions. In such materials, the conduction is not purely vacancy-dependent. The structure typically contains polyanions [ABy]n− with covalent A–B bonds (e.g. PO43−, SO42− and NO3−), where the rotational diffusion of [ABy]n− promotes cationic conductivity, decreasing the associated activation energy via a so-called “paddle-wheel” mechanism.556 After the first reports on a possible “paddle-wheel” mechanism of the complex anion [BH4]− in superionic metal borohydrides,557–559 it was shown by solid state NMR and quasi-elastic neutron scattering,560,561 that the high rotational mobility promotes superionicity in the respective materials (Fig. 29). There is also structural evidence for the “paddle-wheel” Ag+ migration mechanism in Ag2B12H12, where Ag+ cations can only occupy particular atomic sites in the crystal structure for certain [B12H12]2− anion orientations.562

7.3 Metal borohydrides with optical properties
Recent reports on perovskite-type borohydrides motivated investigations into lanthanide-luminescence in perovskite and double perovskite host lattices such as CsCa(BH4)3 or LiCs2Y(BH4)6.1 These systems provided the structural simplicity required in order to study light emission in metal borohydrides, but also enabled tailoring of the emitted spectrum and the efficiency of the light-emitting process in these potential solid-state borohydride phosphors. Very little is known about the Eu(II) luminescence in metal hydrides. Kunkel et al. have reported relatively low quantum yields of yellow-red emission in simple binary alkaline earth hydrides EuxM1−xH2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba)573 as well as in perovskite hosts based on alkali and alkaline earth metals such as KMgH3, NaMgH3 and LiBaxSr1−xH3,574 where the emission ranges from yellow to green. While such red-shifts of the Eu(II) emission were explained on the basis of the nephelauxetic effect, in metal borohydrides the bright Eu(II) emission is centred in the blue regime, which is far more common for Eu(II). To our knowledge, the first reports on Eu(II) luminescence in a complex hydride date back only very recently,313 and is similar to the unsolvated homoleptic borohydrides.1 These compounds show little concentration quenching and a high quantum yield, rare observations for bulk Eu(II)-based phosphors.
CsPb(BH4)3 crystallizes in the perovskite type, and is the first borohydride to show a bandgap in the visible light regime, while metal borohydrides commonly are wide gap insulators with band gaps above 5 eV.1 This material was synthesized in view of the current revolution in photovoltaics, triggered by the hybrid perovskites AMX3, where A is a bulky organic cation such as CH3NH3 or HC(NH2)2, M is a group IV metal (Pb, Sn, Ge) and X is a halogen. The substitution X ↔ BH4 may harness alterations to the band gap of the material and hence to the light spectrum that may be harvested by the material.
7.4 Metal borohydrides with magnetic properties
Most physical properties related to magnetism arise from long-range magnetic order, which is dependent on the exchange interaction between magnetic centers, and requires unpaired electrons in open-shell configurations. The interesting transition metals used to generate such ordering are prone to reduction by the borohydride group and hence not stable. Thus, magnetic/electronic correlation has hitherto not been observed in metal borohydrides. Indeed, the only transition metal with an open shell reported amongst borohydrides is Mn, with oxidation state Mn2+. On the other hand, and as shown throughout this review, all di- and many trivalent oxidation states of rare-earth elements form stable borohydride compounds. A series of bimetallic Gd-borohydrides was investigated with the aim of identifying paramagnetic salts and investigating their properties related to the magnetic entropy change −ΔSM, which is one of the key properties of magnetic refrigerants.50 Owed to its isotropic f7 electronic configuration, and hence its large ground state spin multiplicity, most competitive coolers have been based on Gd3+, such as the benchmark material GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet Gd3Ga5O12).575 Additionally, a paradigm shift is currently taking place, attempting to develop Mn2+-based materials for sub-Kelvin cooling. Similar to most energy-related materials, restrictions imposed on potential candidates are, in addition to weight and volume, the absence of any long-range ordering down to very low temperatures, in order to replace costly He-3.576 The mass of the borohydride ligand is close to that of the oxide anion, and hence much lighter than most of the organic ligands employed in MOF materials currently under investigation.577 The magnetic entropy change per unit mass is thus highly competitive and the recently reported K2Gd(BH4)5 reaches values that lie amongst the 5 highest reported to date,50 and further increases in the magnetic to non-magnetic mass ratio can be expected due to cation substitution NH4+ ↔ K+. Furthermore, many metal borohydrides, both pseudo-binary and -ternary, crystallize in packed structure types derived from ccp or hcp,193 which allows sensible values concerning the magnetic entropy change per unit volume. Both pseudo-binary Mn(BH4)2 as well as Mn-bearing double-salts are stable compounds that are paramagnetic down to at least 2 K and their magnetic refrigeration properties will be investigated in the future. The thermal conductivities of some simple metal borohydrides lie in the range of 2–5 W m−1 K−1,578,579 which is appropriate for the heat transfer in magnetic cooling devices.
7.5 Perspectives for design of novel metal borohydrides
Borohydrides are beginning to play a role as interesting materials in a variety of technical fields. For instance, a semiconducting compound CsPb(BH4)3 was recently reported,1 which relates well to the plumbohalides also under investigation for photovoltaics, however, it is not chemically stable for a long time period. Neutron shielding applications were also proposed due to the high absorption cross section of boron (767 barn for natural isotope abundancy).580 In this context, the energy transfer from the neutron to the material could also be exploited to develop neutron detectors (or scintillators in general) where a luminescent RE-ion emits light upon irradiation of the host, similar to what has been done with borates in the past.
The hydrolysis of metal borohydrides has been investigated since 1953 as a mechanism to quickly generate hydrogen gas from a solid-state storage medium.581 This research field is still evolving and current research strives for a cost reduction for using hydrolysis as a reversible energy generation and storage system. In a similar manner, metal borohydrides are also investigated as reducing agents in direct borohydride fuel cells.582 A redox reaction occurs between the borohydride anion itself and an oxidant to generate electricity. These fuel cells offer advantages over traditional fuel cells due to their operating temperatures, voltages, and high power densities. Further reduction reactions have also recently been investigated with the sulfurization of metal borohydrides.440
Perovskite-type compounds were briefly discussed in Section 3.4 and 3.5. It was also mentioned that the homopolar dihydrogen contacts between hydridic species pertaining to adjacent BH4− ligands generate lattice instabilities. It can be assumed that such close contacts constitute a novel kind of “weak” interaction in perovskites that may be further exploited regarding the stabilization of low symmetries and the possibility of switching between polar bi-stable configurations of the structure, thus potentially culminating in a novel type of geometric ferroelectricity. From an applied viewpoint, such a scheme would be closely related to the supramolecular ferroelectrics where ferroelectricity arises from various kinds of weak interactions.583 From a fundamental point of view such hydridic interactions are both highly interesting and timely, forming part of the ever growing family of intriguing weak interactions.584 Homoleptic metal borohydrides, but also heteroleptic ones, offer a unique opportunity of studying this hydridic interaction, which currently challenges all levels of ab initio theory.
Indeed, homo- and heteropolar interactions between protons and hydrides could potentially be meticulously implemented in order to tailor lattice distortions in hybrid organic–inorganic borohydride-based materials. Further means of taking influence on symmetry-determining parameters such as order, polarizability and dipole moments include anion-substitution of the BH4 group by amides or halides, but also within the BH4 group by the scheme H− ↔ F−. As such, this inorganic family of materials could be placed into the landscape of molecular and supramolecular chemistry. In this context, we could extend the focus from homoleptic metal borohydrides to the heteroleptic compounds, where the tetrahydridoboranate anion may be employed as a hydridic building block in the crystal engineering of molecular and metalorganic compounds.
All in all, this young but vast family of materials offers exotic and enticing new chemistry to materials scientists working in energy-related fields.
7.6 CO2-recycling with metal borohydrides
Our current energy system is, to a large extent, based on fossil fuels, i.e. carbon-based materials, and our energy system is not considered a ‘closed materials cycle’, because we consume these fuels by combustion on a much faster rate than they are produced by photosynthesis and geological processes. Hence, in order to close the carbon cycle, we must find a route to convert the produced CO2 into useful fuel. Some metal borohydrides have recently been investigated in this context, of CO2 capture and recycling. It has been suggested to generate hydrogen by a CO2-enhanced hydrolysis of KBH4 where the waste products of fossil fuel combustion, i.e. CO2 and H2O, can be used in a further cycle for hydrogen production for fuel cells.585 The proposed reaction results in the formation of a carbonate salt, water and gaseous hydrogen. The porous polymorph γ-Mg(BH4)2 was also found to have potential in CO2 recycling where upon CO2-reduction chemical products such as formate or methoxy-species are produced.586 Owing to the large specific surface area of γ-Mg(BH4)2, CO2 conversion occurs with unprecedented fast kinetics at 30 °C and p(CO2) = 1 bar. Metal borohydrides with low surface area, such as KBH4, readily react with CO2 under mechanochemical conditions at room temperature,587 yielding mainly formylhydroborates. Whilst, solid–gas reactions in the KBH4–CO2 system at high temperature reveal the formation of methanol and methane under water-free conditions.
7.7 A possible paradigm shift for solid state hydrogen storage
The design of a possible successor for liquid fuels like diesel and gasoline faces numerous challenges. About twenty properties need to be optimized simultaneously, which span wide areas including low cost, fast energy recharging, large gravimetric and volumetric energy storage densities, low operation temperature etc. This review has illustrated numerous examples of the rational design of novel metal borohydrides with interesting properties, e.g. using borohydride–oxide analogies, and also the possibilities of post-modification of the materials, e.g. by anion substitution etc. Thus, new classes are likely to be discovered in the near future. Two decades ago, alloying metals that reacted with hydrogen to different degrees tended to provide an alloy with intermediate properties. During the past decade, reactive hydride composites were explored, which have an average hydrogen storage capacity compared to the individual components. Recently, the first stabilization of the metastable compound, NH4BH4 was discovered by a reaction with the more stable metal borohydride, Ca(BH4)2. The product, NH4Ca(BH4)3, has a different decomposition profile and may be considered as the first member of a larger series of compounds. Notice that, the series BH4−, NH4+, CH4 are isoelectronic and the hydrogen density of NH4BH4, ρV = 157 g H2 mL−1 and ρm = 24.5 wt% H2, is even higher than liquid natural gas, CH4(l), ρV = 137 g H2 mL−1 and ρm = 24.8 wt% H2. Recently, other borane based materials have been discovered, e.g. hydrazine bisborane, BH3N2H4BH3.588
8. Conclusions
Metal borohydrides have received increasing interest over the past decade with a wide range of new materials discovered. An extremely rich chemistry has been outlined including fascinating structural flexibility and a wide range of elemental compositions. Furthermore, derivatives of metal borohydrides have also been discovered, which strongly contribute to the diverse chemistry. These materials have a wide range of unexpected properties, which may lead to new applications in the future. The systematic work on crystalline metal borohydrides has provided enough results to understand the basic principles which control their crystal structures, and consequently their properties. One of the most important understandings is the description of borohydrides as ionocovalent solids comparable with many other inorganic compounds such as oxides or halides. The crystal chemistry of borohydrides may then be explained by known principles such as Pauling rules, involving the polarisation of the rather soft borohydride anion, various factors based on ionic radii etc. A consequences is that the huge crystal chemistry knowledge accumulated for oxides or halides can be now applied to borohydrides in designing new compounds with desired chemical composition, atomic coordination and, in the best case, with desired properties.
This review has outlined trends across the synthetic approaches for metal borohydrides and their halide and neutral molecule complexes, classing reactions into addition, metathesis, or complex metathesis-addition mechanisms. Trends in structural chemistry have also been listed and over 100 compounds are reported for mono-, bi- and tri-metallic borohydrides. Many similarities can be found within certain classes of borohydride, for example those rich in alkali metals, or rare earth metals. The metal borohydride halides can also be classed into those compounds that exhibit completely ordered, partly ordered, or completely disordered structures. Many new metal borohydrides have been discovered that are complexed with neutral molecules that can exhibit many interesting properties suitable for technical applications, but have also been shown to influence the decomposition pathway of the parent borohydride. A number of metal borohydrides have been shown to melt individually or in eutectic compositions, but often decompose shortly after in often multi-step pathways that are temperature and pressure dependent. The kinetics of hydrogen release and uptake have typically been poor for metal borohydrides and traditional additives have not been successful in enhancing kinetics, as they have been in many other metal–hydrogen systems. However, techniques including reactive hydride composites and nanoconfinement have offered new possibilities in improving kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogen release and uptake. The rehydrogenation of metal borohydrides can be performed under more mild conditions by controlling the desorption by-products to restrict the quantity of higher boranes, i.e. with lower desorption temperatures or with hydrogen back-pressure. Recently, metal borohydrides have been studied for new applications, taking advantage of cation conduction in the solid-state, optical properties, porous structures for gas adsorption, and also magnetic properties.
The knowledge gained mainly during the past decade of research within metal borohydrides is presented in this review, which provides analysis of the trends in synthesis, structure and properties. An overview of the current frontiers of research and new perspectives for the future utilization of this fascinating class of new materials is also provided. A wide range of approaches for tailoring the composition and structure of metal borohydrides is also discussed, which provides new methods for tailoring properties. This is an important step towards rational design of new functional materials. This review also demonstrates that there is still plenty of room for discovering new metal borohydrides since these types of materials have extreme flexibility in composition, structure and properties.

 	Fig. 1  The crystal structure of (a) porous γ-Mg(BH4)2, ρ = 0.550 g mL−1 and (b) the high-pressure δ-Mg(BH4)2, ρ = 0.987 g mL−1.	 

 	Fig. 2  Fragment (1/8 of the unit cell shown by green lines) of the crystal structure of the low-temperature α-Y(BH4)3 polymorph (left) and the high-temperature β-Y(BH4)3 polymorph (right). Both structures are viewed along the same direction of their respective cubic unit cells. While in the low-temperature polymorph the (BH4)6 octahedron around yttrium is deformed allowing for more efficient packing in the structure but with shorter H⋯H contacts (given in Å), the same octahedron in the high-temperature polymorph is regular with maximized H⋯H contacts and a less dense structure. The polymorphic transition is induced by flipping of three BH4 groups labelled with white numbers.

 	Fig. 14  The four different structure types observed for Y(BH4)3·nNH3, i.e. (a) complex cations (n = 7); (b) molecular compounds (n = 4); (c) one dimensional chains (n = 2); (d) 2D-layered structures (n = 1).	 

 	Fig. 15  Metal–nitrogen bond distances for selected ammine metal borohydrides plotted as a function of the ionic radius of the metal. The coordination number (CN) of the metals are provided and represents the number of BH4− and NH3 coordinated to the metal.	 

 	Fig. 16  Metal–boron distances and hapticities (ηx) for selected ammine metal borohydrides plotted as a function of the ionic radius of the metal. Due to the weak scattering of H, hapticities are tentative for structures that are not DFT optimized, i.e. η(Al3+) = 2–3, η(Mn2+) = 2–3 and η(Sc3+) = 2–3. The large M–B distances >3.5 occur for BH4− acting as a counter anion, η0.

 	Fig. 17  Unit cell volumes (V) at RT divided by the number of formula units (Z) plotted as a function of the number of ammonia molecules, n, in the formula unit, M(BH4)m·nNH3. The dashed and solid line correspond to linear fit to the DFT optimized values for Y(BH4)3·nNH3 and the experimental values for Mn(BH4)2·nNH3, respectively. The unit cell volume of Li2Mn(BH4)4·6NH3 subtracted the volume of two formula units of LiBH4 is also included.	 

 	Fig. 18  Decomposition temperatures for selected ammine metal borohydrides and the corresponding metal borohydrides as a function of electronegativity (Zn(BH4)2 is not experimentally investigated but considered unstable). Ammonia is released when the metal borohydride is more stable than the corresponding ammine metal borohydride (red circle) otherwise hydrogen is released (green square).
