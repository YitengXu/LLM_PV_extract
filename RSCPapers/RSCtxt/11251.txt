    , Accepted 3rd December 2020First published on 16th December 2020AbstractControlling the products, i.e. achieving high selectivity, is essential yet challenging for many chemical processes. So far, ex/in situ methods have been reported to prepare selective catalysts; here, we present a distinct operational strategy. To demonstrate its power and simplicity, a high-pressure artificial photosynthetic device (HiPAD) was designed correspondingly to achieve selective and efficient solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R). The HiPAD features a high-pressure operation to enhance the CO2 concentration, as well as straight operations of copper (Cu) catalyst synthesis and Cu-catalyzed PEC CO2R to enhance the active site concentration. This strategy is quantitatively described by the Langmuir mechanism. By leveraging it, CO2R selectivity higher than 80% and solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency exceeding 0.9% were experimentally demonstrated. The material and synthesis versatility feature of this strategy was also demonstrated. These results shed new light on selective and efficient catalytic conversions.
1. Introduction
Selectivity towards specific products is important to maximize the valorization degree as well as to minimize the product separation costs, but it remains challenging for modern catalytic chemical processes including carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R), nitrogen fixation and H2O2 production by H2O oxidation.1–4 The desired reaction needs to beat all other side reactions regarding reaction rates to achieve a high selectivity. Studies have sought to use ex situ methods,5–8 to use additives for example, to synthesize catalysts that are rich in specific facets favoring desired adsorption/desorption properties to achieve selective conversion. Recently, catalysts, synthesized in situ with the presence of CO2 and CO2R intermediates thereby rich in Cu(100)9 and Pb(111)10 facets, were reported to selectively produce C2+ products9 and formate.10 The Langmuir mechanism,11 (1)is a simple, yet reasonable interpretation of catalytic surface reactions for which the reaction of the adsorbed species is the limiting step; where r and k are the reaction rate and rate constant of the surface reaction for a specific product, Cs is the concentration of all sites that are active for this reaction, and K is the chemical equilibrium constant for the adsorption and desorption processes of a reactant with a concentration of Cr. Built on this, here we presented a distinct operational strategy where Cr and Cs are tuned to enhance the reaction selectivity. This strategy was demonstrated by improving CO2R selectivity over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction driven by solar energy, which offers a means to provide an alternative to fossil fuels and to mitigate global warming.12–14
1.1. Concept
Firstly, high CO2R selectivity has been significantly hindered by the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolytes.15–19 Thus, a high-pressure artificial photosynthetic device (HiPAD), mimicking the natural photosystem where H2O is oxidized (OER) at the photoanode and CO2 is reduced at the dark cathode, was designed to increase CO2 concentration in the electrolyte and thereby on the catalyst surface, i.e. to increase Cr. High-pressure CO2 reduction is technologically promising also for other reasons: (i) pressurized CO2 sources are available from the industry (for example the technology of coal gasification in supercritical water investigated by our group20 shown in Fig. S1†) and (ii) pressurized products can be transported and utilized more easily.16 Secondly, the Cu catalyst by electroreduction of the Cu2O precursor was synthesized for pressurized CO2 conditions inside HiPAD and used as the dark cathode, then, the Cu-catalyzed CO2R reaction straightly operates without making any changes to, nor taking anything in or out of HiPAD. The small amount of CO, which is produced during the process of Cu catalyst synthesis, was believed to increase the concentration of sites that are highly active for CO2R,21,22i.e. to increase Cs. Both the high-pressure condition and the straight operation of Cu catalyst synthesis and Cu-catalyzed CO2R demonstrate the distinct features of our proposed operational strategy as shown in Scheme 1. By leveraging this strategy, CO2R selectivity higher than 80% and solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency higher than 0.9% were achieved, which compare favorably with previous studies23–28 (achieving a near 5-fold enhancement compared to that of the state-of-the-art device using the Schottky-junction photoanode and dark cathode25).

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Theoretical preparation
In this section, we theoretically designed experiments used for proof-of-concept. The rate of CO2 reduction, rCO2, is: (2)where the terms of the rate constant and the active site concentration in eqn (1) are combined and denoted by kCO2 for simplicity. The rate of HER is rH2O = kH2O also for simplicity. Then, the selectivity for CO2R products, SCO2R, can be estimated as: (3)where SCO2R can be experimentally measured for various pressures, CCO2 for various pressures can be calculated using the method reported by Tang et al.,29 and K and kH2O/kCO2 are two fitting parameters.
The proof-of-concept experiments are designed as follows. Two types of Cu catalysts are synthesized. One is synthesized by ex situ reduction of Cu2O precursor (eSitu-Cu) and the other is synthesized and then used following the guidelines of our proposed operational strategy (OP-Cu). See Methods for more details. Particularly, if eSitu-Cu and OP-Cu have the same facet feature, they should have the same K value. The SCO2R values of these two Cu catalysts are measured for various pressures, i.e. various CCO2. For the eSitu-Cu catalyst, K and (kH2O/kCO2)-eSitu can be obtained by fitting the (SCO2R–CCO2)-eSitu curve. Then, the (SCO2R–CCO2)-OP curve was fitted using the fitted K in the previous step to obtain (kH2O/kCO2)-OP for the OP-Cu catalyst. Our proposed strategy can be well supported if the (SCO2R–CCO2)-OP curve can be well fitted by using only one fitting parameter, (kH2O/kCO2)-OP, and if the fitted (kH2O/kCO2)-OP is smaller than the fitted (kH2O/kCO2)-eSitu in the previous step.
2.2 Experimental demonstrations

Configuration and catalysts of HiPAD. 
We performed PEC CO2R experiments in a customized high-pressure artificial photosynthetic device (the HiPAD shown in Fig. 1a) comprising a TiO2 photoanode (see Methods and Fig. S2† for details30) with ∼5 suns illumination and a Cu-catalyst dark cathode. These two example materials are used because TiO2 is low-cost and stable and Cu is cost-effective. Both the anodic and cathodic chambers are filled with 0.1 M aqueous KHCO3 electrolyte and CO2; they are separated by a proton exchange membrane but are kept at equilibrium for pressures ranging from 1 to 90 atm. The CO2 concentrations, and resultantly the pH values, vary with pressure, so cathodic potentials vs. RHE may also vary. Therefore, the working voltage between the photoanode and the cathode was kept at ∼2.0 V so that HiPAD can be driven by cheap solar cells such as two perovskite solar cells connected in series previously reported by our group;31 thus, the solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency can be estimated for HiPAD. Gaseous and liquid products were collected at ambient pressure and detected by gas- and liquid-chromatography.

(b) Typical variation of the voltage between the photoanode and the cathode with time over an entire period including the OP-Cu synthesis stage (first 15 minutes) and the straightly followed OP-Cu-catalyzed CO2R stage (next 45 minutes). Nothing is changed in or taken in or out of the HiPAD between these two stages. Low-magnification (left) and high-magnification (right) SEM images of (c) OP-Cu at 90 atm and (d) eSitu-Cu. (e) XRD results of OP-Cu at 90 atm and eSitu-Cu demonstrating nearly the same facets. 
We synthesized both OP-Cu and eSitu-Cu cathode catalysts by reduction of the Cu2O precursor, which was prepared using the method reported by Le et al.32 (see Methods and Fig. S3† for details). Guided by our proposed operational strategy, the OP-Cu catalyst was synthesized by electroreduction inside HiPAD for the exact same condition as PEC CO2R; then, the OP-Cu-catalyzed PEC CO2R reaction operated without making any changes to nor taking anything in or out of HiPAD, as shown in Scheme 1. Fig. 1b shows a typical variation of the voltage between the photoanode and the cathode with time over an entire period including OP-Cu synthesis and OP-Cu-catalyzed CO2R. The voltage increases for the first 15 minutes (the OP-Cu synthesis stage) and is constant at ∼2.0 V for the next 45 minutes (the OP-Cu-catalyzed CO2R stage). The faradaic efficiency of each product for the first 15 minutes, listed in Table S1,† can demonstrate that the OP-Cu synthesis is in progress. The eSitu-Cu catalyst was synthesized by reduction inside a tube furnace with H2 atmosphere for 300 °C and 3 h. The Cu catalyst synthesized by ex situ electroreduction has a similar performance to eSitu-Cu (Fig. S4†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of OP-Cu at 90 atm and eSitu-Cu are shown in Fig. 1c and d. Both the two catalysts remain in the micro-scale four-sided pyramid morphology of the Cu2O precursor (Fig. S3†) but show an extra feature of nano-scale roughness. Their facets were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Fig. 1e shows that the patterns of these two catalysts match well with the standard Cu peaks and the relative peak intensities of Cu (111), Cu (200) and Cu (220) are found to be very close for them. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that OP-Cu and eSitu-Cu have the same K value. See the ESI text, Fig. S5 and Table S3† for detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of OP-Cu.


CO2R performance of HiPAD. 

Fig. 2a and b show the variations of the selectivity of each product with pressures ranging from 1 to 90 atm for the OP-Cu and eSitu-Cu catalysts. The gaseous products are H2 and CO, i.e. syngas, and the liquid product is formate; thus, product separation is not needed which is beneficial for applications. Selectivity of a specific product was calculated as its yield over the summation of each product yield. Selectivity is plotted because it is needed for the fitting as noted in the Theoretical preparation section, while the sum of the faradaic efficiency of each product is ∼93% (see Table S2† for details). The results show that CO2R product selectivity (summation of CO and formate selectivity) increases with pressure for both OP-Cu and eSitu-Cu. For eSitu-Cu, the cathodic reduction is dominated by HER whose selectivity is as high as 67% even at 90 atm. In strong contrast, for OP-Cu, HER selectivity is significantly suppressed to as low as 20% for pressures higher than 50 atm. In addition, the CO/H2 ratio of ∼2:1 was achieved at 50 atm. Furthermore, the yield of each product increases proportionally with time for a period of 12 hours as shown in Fig. S6.†

To glean the mechanism of the selectivity enhancement for HiPAD, the SCO2R–CCO2 curves are fitted to eqn (3) for OP-Cu and eSitu-Cu as noted in the Theoretical preparation section. The SCO2R-pressure curves are plotted in Fig. 3a for clarity and the SCO2R–CCO2 curves are plotted in Fig. S7.† The CO2 solubilities for various pressures shown in Fig. 3b were calculated using the method reported by Tang et al.29 In the first step, the (SCO2R–CCO2) curve was fitted (R2 = 0.97) for eSitu-Cu and K = 3.255 and (kH2O/kCO2)-eSitu = 1.999 were obtained. In the next step, the (SCO2R–CCO2) curve was fitted for OP-Cu with K fixed at 3.255; this gives (kH2O/kCO2)-OP = 0.309. Fig. S7† shows that the (SCO2R–CCO2)-OP curve is well fitted (R2 = 0.95) by using only one fitting parameter, (kH2O/kCO2)-OP and the fitted (kH2O/kCO2)-OP is much smaller than the fitted (kH2O/kCO2)-eSitu in the previous step. Therefore, our proposed strategy was well-supported. Previous studies21,22 reported that a small amount of CO increases the concentration of sites that are highly active for CO2R; this leads to (kH2O/kCO2)-OP being smaller than (kH2O/kCO2)-eSitu. This was further supported by DFT calculations in this work (see Fig. S8† for more details). In a control experiment, all the reactants, products and electrolyte inside HiPAD were removed after the first 15 minutes, and this catalyst is denoted by iSitu-Cu. Then, HiPAD was refilled by the electrolyte and CO2, pressurized to 10 atm and operated for 45 minutes. The product distributions shown in Fig. 3c demonstrated that as for eSitu-Cu, HER selectivity is as high as 77% for iSitu-Cu, which clarifies the effect of the presence of CO produced during the first 15 minutes (listed in Table S1†).

(b) Variations of CO2 solubility in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte with pressures that were calculated using the method reported by Tang et al.29 (c) Product selectivity of eSitu-Cu, iSitu-Cu and OP-Cu for 10 atm conditions. 
Now, we determined the solar-to-chemical (STC) energy conversion efficiency of HiPAD. The current densities of HiPAD are below 4 mA cm−2 for the ∼2.0 V working voltage. Two perovskite solar cells (reported by our group31) connected in series have a current density higher than 8 mA cm−2 when providing a voltage of 2.0 V and thereby can drive HiPAD. Therefore, STC efficiency of HiPAD can be obtained from the yields of all the products and the input energy detected in this work. Table S4† lists product yields and STC efficiency for various pressures with a considerable value of 0.93% at 90 atm, which compared well with previous studies (see Table S5† for details). This performance can be further enhanced by optimizing the photoanode (by doping for example), the cathode (combining ex/in situ and operational strategies for example) and the working conditions (working voltage, electrolyte, membrane, etc.). These results demonstrated the power of our proposed operational strategy.

2.3 Discussion
Finally, we discuss the generality and practicability of our proposed operational strategy. First, this strategy is very general and thereby applicable to other catalysts and synthesis approaches. To demonstrate this, we used another method reported by Li and Kanan32 to prepare the Cu2O precursor; then, we performed straight operations of Cu catalyst synthesis and Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction at 50 atm. A near 4-fold enhancement of CO2R selectivity was achieved compared to the results reported by Li and Kanan.32 See the ESI text† and Fig. S9 and S10† for more details. Therefore, we must emphasize that the contributions of this work lie in the distinct operational strategy we proposed but do not lie in the catalyst and its synthesis approach.
Secondly, due to concerns about the high-pressure and 5-suns condition, we have performed the experiment for milder and more practical conditions (see Table S6† for more details). For the 1-sun and 50 atm condition, which can be provided directly by a CO2 cylinder, a considerable STC efficiency value of ∼1.2% has been achieved. See Fig. S11† for the calculation of the energy cost that is needed to pressurize CO2 to 50 atm.
3. Conclusions
In summary, this work presents a novel operational strategy, which is quantitatively built on the Langmuir mechanism, to enhance the selectivity of CO2 reduction over HER. Guided by this strategy, we designed a high-pressure artificial photosynthetic device featuring high-pressure operation as well as straight operations of Cu catalyst synthesis and Cu-catalyzed CO2 reduction to enhance both the CO2 concentration and the active site concentration. For reasons attributed to these factors, we experimentally demonstrated a CO2R product selectivity of ∼80% and solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency of ∼0.9%, achieving a near 5-fold enhancement compared to that of the state-of-the-art device using a Schottky-junction photoanode and dark cathode.25 We also demonstrated the material and synthesis versatility feature of this operational strategy. Therefore, it not only provides a conceptual design for selective and efficient artificial photosynthetic devices but is also anticipated to be applicable for other chemical processes such as ammonia production by nitrogen fixation.
4. Methods
4.1. Preparations of the TiO2 photoanode and Cu2O precursor
The TiO2 nanorod array on the FTO substrate was synthesized by the simple hydrothermal method reported by Liu and Aydil.30 The Cu2O thin film precursor was fabricated by electrodeposition on a polished titanium substrate, as reported by Le et al.33
4.2. Materials characterization
The morphology and size of samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Nova NanoSEM 450). The facets of the samples were characterized by the X-ray diffraction method (Bruker D8 Advance) at a scan speed of 8 degrees per minute from 20 to 90 degrees. XPS spectra were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Kratos AXIS Ultra and Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi).
4.3. HiPAD setup
The customized reactor with three electrodes inside was made of stainless steel coated with Teflon for electrical insulation. A CO2 pump (SUPERCRITICAL 24, CNST FLOW, Scientific Systems, Inc.) was used to reach specific reactor pressures that were monitored by transmitters (13C3000PA4K, Honeywell). Anodic and cathodic chambers were separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117) but were kept at equilibrium. The anodic chamber was equipped with a quartz window. See Fig. S12† for the assembly and the photo of the high-pressure reactor.
4.4. Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photocurrent response was recorded by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). The light source is a xenon lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter with 5-suns intensity. The TiO2 nanorod array on FTO was used as the working electrode with the Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode as the reference electrode and the Cu catalyst as the counter electrode. The temporal voltage between the photoanode and the cathode was recorded by a multimeter.
4.5. Product collection and analysis
At the end of each experiment, gaseous products were collected in a sampling tank. This tank was pre-vacuumed and volume calibrated and was connected with the chambers through a decompression valve. Gaseous products were detected by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B). Formate was detected by liquid chromatography (Agilent 1260 infinity II) where formate was first separated by the C18 column (EliteHPLC, YWG C18 10 μm) and then detected by the Variable Wavelength Detector (215 nm, Agilent G7114A). The column was kept at 40 °C with a mobile phase (0.1 M KH2PO4 and pH = 2.7 adjusted by H3PO4) flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1.
4.6. Calculation of solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency
The solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency, ηSTC, was calculated as, (4)where F = 96485 C mol−1 is the Faraday constant, Y and E0 are the yield (mol) and the thermodynamic potential (1.23 V for hydrogen, 1.33 V for CO and 1.48 V for formate) of each product, Isun = 1000 W m−2 is the power density of one sun, A = 10−4 m2 is the area of the photoanode and t = 3600 s is the total reaction time under illumination.

 	Fig. 1  Configuration and catalysts of HiPAD. (a) A schematic of the customized high-pressure artificial photosynthetic device. (b) Typical variation of the voltage between the photoanode and the cathode with time over an entire period including the OP-Cu synthesis stage (first 15 minutes) and the straightly followed OP-Cu-catalyzed CO2R stage (next 45 minutes). Nothing is changed in or taken in or out of the HiPAD between these two stages. Low-magnification (left) and high-magnification (right) SEM images of (c) OP-Cu at 90 atm and (d) eSitu-Cu. (e) XRD results of OP-Cu at 90 atm and eSitu-Cu demonstrating nearly the same facets.	 

 	Fig. 2  CO2R Performance of HiPAD. Product selectivity of (a) OP-Cu and (b) eSitu-Cu for pressures ranging from 1 to 90 atm and a period of 1 h. The gaseous products are hydrogen and CO and the liquid product is formate.	 

 	Fig. 3  Mechanism of selectivity enhancement for HiPAD. (a) Variations of CO2R product selectivity with pressures and corresponding Langmuir mechanism fittings for eSitu-Cu and OP-Cu. (b) Variations of CO2 solubility in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte with pressures that were calculated using the method reported by Tang et al.29 (c) Product selectivity of eSitu-Cu, iSitu-Cu and OP-Cu for 10 atm conditions.
