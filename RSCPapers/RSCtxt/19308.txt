    , Accepted 30th April 2018First published on 24th May 2018AbstractInvestigations on the relationships among the chemical structures, morphology and photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers are crucial in designing high-efficiency semiconducting polymers. Here, two novel copolymers, PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT, were designed and synthesized to demonstrate the improvement in photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers by a small change in their chemical structures. PIBTO-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges has a more linear backbone conformation, thereby resulting in enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions compared to PIBTO-T with thiophene π-bridges. Benefiting from the closer intermolecular π–π stacking, PIBTO-TT:PC71BM exhibits a higher hole mobility than PIBTO-T:PC71BM. Morphological studies reveal that the miscibility of PC71BM in PIBTO-TT is better than that in PIBTO-T. This enhanced miscibility could shorten the distances between adjacent fullerenes and improve electron transportation in the miscible region. Meanwhile, PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blends have larger donor/acceptor interfacial areas than PIBTO-T:PC71BM samples. All these factors contribute to the better photovoltaic performance of PIBTO-TT-based devices. This study clearly shows that the morphological characteristics and photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers are closely related to their molecular structures, and the manipulation of backbone conformation through π-bridge modulation is a promising molecular engineering approach to improve the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers.
1. Introduction
The advantages of light-weight, flexibility, and cost-effective solution-processability promise a bright future for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) in practical applications.1–5 In BHJ PSCs, the active layer is usually made by blending a p-type (donor) material with an n-type (acceptor) material. Excitons generated in the active layer must diffuse to the donor–acceptor interface to dissociate into free holes and electrons. Then the separated free charge carriers have to travel to their corresponding electrodes through donor and acceptor phases, respectively.6–9 In all these processes, the morphology of the BHJ blend undoubtedly plays a significant role.10 It is well-established that an optimal blend morphology should comprise a bicontinuous interpenetration network with nanoscale domain sizes of around 10–20 nm, sufficiently pure phases, large interfacial areas, high crystallinity and ordered molecular packing, all of which facilitate efficient charge generation and transport. In order to achieve such a morphology, several processing methods have been developed, such as the incorporation of solvent additives,10–13 thermal annealing,14,15 and solvent annealing.16 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been realized in single-junction PSCs with the help of morphology engineering.17–21
The molecular structures of active layer materials are of first importance in determining the morphology of BHJ blends although it can be further optimized by using various processing conditions. For instance, the molecular packing and crystallinity of the cyclopentadithiophene-based polymer can be enhanced by substituting the bridging carbon atoms with silicon atoms because C–Si has a longer bond length than C–C, which would reduce the steric hindrance from the bulky alkyl chains.22 Hou and co-workers demonstrated that the polymer backbone conformation was changed from a zig-zag one to a linear one by replacing the benzodithiophene donor unit in the donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymer (PBDTTT-S-T) with dithienobenzodithiophene. As a result, stronger intermolecular π–π stacking was observed, which is beneficial for achieving efficient charge transport and improved photovoltaic performance.23 Chen and co-workers reported that the replacement of the benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor unit on the polymer backbone with the benzooxadiazole (BO) unit would reduce the miscibility of PC61BM in the resulting copolymer. This decrease in polymer/fullerene mixing reduces the donor/acceptor interface and provides reduced pathways for electron transport in the mixed region, leading to low Jsc and PCE values for the resulting PSCs based on the BO-containing polymers.24 More recently, poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD) was synthesized by Yan and co-workers as an example to show the temperature-dependent aggregation properties of conjugated polymers. The unique aggregation properties can create a nearly optimal BHJ morphology with high crystalline and small domains at the same time.25a In addition to polymer backbones, the side chains of conjugated polymers may also play a key role in the BHJ morphology of active layers. For example, Duan et al. investigated the effect of side chain lengths on the photovoltaic properties of benzodithiophene-based copolymers and found that too long alkyl chains would cause suboptimal BHJ morphology and poor device performances.25b As has been demonstrated above, the chemical structures of conjugated polymers are essential to the morphology and photovoltaic properties of the active layers. Therefore, investigations on the correlations among the molecular structures of polymers, the morphology in BHJ blends, and photovoltaic properties are of great importance for the rational design of conjugated copolymers.
Unfortunately, although there are tremendous efforts on the development of novel conjugated polymers with superior photovoltaic properties, the fundamental nature of BHJ blends and how the molecular structures of polymers might affect the resulting BHJ blend morphology have been seldom reported. Though the impacts of π-bridge on the charge transport and photovoltaic properties of D–A copolymers have been reported by our group and others,26–29 quantitative analyses on the morphology of the polymer/fullerene blend, including domain size, miscibility of fullerene in conjugated polymer, and D/A interfacial area, have not been investigated. Moreover, the impacts of π-bridge on the conformation of polymer backbone and on the BHJ morphology are also poorly understood.
In this work, two novel copolymers, PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT, were synthesized and used as examples. As shown in Scheme 1, the difference between the two copolymers lies in that thiophene π-bridges in PIBTO-T are replaced by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene groups in PIBTO-TT. Interestingly, such a small change in the chemical structure has a large impact on their backbone conformation as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, the comparison between the two copolymers can obtain the correlations among the molecular structures of polymers, backbone conformation, BHJ morphology and photovoltaic properties. PIBTO-TT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges has a more linear backbone, thus facilitating the formation of more ordered packing with a longer coherence length along the π–π stacking direction. At the same time, PIBTO-TT shows better miscibility with PC71BM and the blend of PIBTO-TT with PC71BM forms smaller domain sizes and larger specific interfacial area, as compared to the PIBTO-T counterpart. Consequently, improved photovoltaic performance was found for PIBTO-TT-based devices with or without solvent additives.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT are shown in Scheme 1. Both copolymers were synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling reaction. During polymerization, different catalytic systems and reaction times were used to tune the molecular weights and solubility of the resulting copolymers. Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization techniques of the copolymers are shown in the ESI.† Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis at 150 °C using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent gave a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 43.1 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.9 for PIBTO-T, and an Mn of 42.8 kDa with a PDI of 1.6 for PIBTO-TT. Besides similar molecular weights, PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT have identical donor and acceptor building blocks, which allows us to probe the effects of π-bridge on the properties of copolymers. With six long alkyl chains on every repeat unit, both copolymers show sufficient solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene, which is important for device fabrication.
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT in CB solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and in films are shown in Fig. 1a and b and the relevant results are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT have almost the same absorption shapes in solution with two well-defined absorption bands, which is a common feature for alternating D–A copolymers. The high-energy absorption band in the range of 350–500 nm is originated from the localized π–π* transition, and the low-energy absorption band in 500–650 nm is due to the intramolecular charge transfer transition. In solution, PIBTO-T has an absorption maximum at 563 nm, while PIBTO-TT has a slightly red-shifted absorption band with an absorption maximum at 575 nm. This should be attributed to the extended π-conjugation length and the more linear polymer backbone of PIBTO-TT, which will be confirmed by theoretical calculations in the following section. Interestingly, PIBTO-TT with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge exhibits a higher repeat-unit-based maximum absorption coefficient of 4.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at the long-wavelength absorption peak than PIBTO-T (3.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1), indicating its stronger light harvesting ability. In comparison with the absorption spectra in solutions, the absorption maxima of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT in the films bathochromically shift to 574 and 594 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b). Obviously, PIBTO-TT shows a more red-shifted linear absorption compared to PIBTO-T (11 vs. 19 nm), which indicates a stronger π–π interaction for the former one. The absorption edges of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT in the solid films are both at 668 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap of 1.86 eV.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the frontier orbital energy levels of the copolymers. The voltammograms are depicted in Fig. 1c and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1. According to the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT are calculated to be −5.43 and −5.45 eV, respectively, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are determined to be −3.53 and −3.55 eV, respectively. Such deep-lying HOMO energy levels of the copolymers are favorable for achieving a high Voc in the resulting PSCs. In addition, the LUMO offsets between the two copolymers and PC71BM are both higher than 0.55 eV, which satisfies the requirement for efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface in the corresponding BHJ blends (Fig. 1d). Based on the above results, one can find that the optical and electrochemical properties of the two copolymers are barely changed when the π-bridge unit varied from thiophene to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene.
2.3 Conformational analysis
To get insights into the effect of π-bridge on the molecular orbital distribution and the molecular geometries of the copolymers, computational studies were performed using density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP/6-311G* level). Dimers (IBTO-T and IBTO-TT) with simplified methyl groups were considered as a model system. The calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). For both dimers, their LUMO orbitals are mainly localized on the acceptor units, whereas their HOMO orbitals are distributed over the conjugated polymer backbones. These results may explain why the replacement of the thiophene π-bridge with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit has little influence on the energy levels of the copolymers. The optimized geometries of two copolymers in an energy-minimized structure are shown in Fig. 2. IBTO-T and IBTO-TT present similar planarity in their side views. Top views show that PIBTO-TT adopts a linear backbone conformation with a small angle of 6° between the two closest IBTO-TT units along the backbone. In contrast, PIBTO-T shows an angular-shaped backbone with a much larger angle of ∼51°. Therefore, it would be hard to obtain the ordered molecular packing for PIBTO-T thin films. These results indicate that the backbone conformation of the polymers could be effectively tuned by manipulating their π-bridge units. The more linear conformation combined with good planarity would result in more ordered interchain π–π packing in PIBTO-TT films, which is beneficial for a higher carrier mobility.

2.4 Polymer microstructure in the solid state
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)30 was employed to study the molecular packing and crystallinity of the as-cast PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding 1D scattering profiles of the two copolymers are shown in Fig. 3. All the (h00) scattering peaks are invisible, except for the gentle (100) peak, suggesting that both copolymers have a similar amorphous nature as other reported IDTT-based copolymers.31,32 Moreover, the (010) diffractions derived from π–π stacking for both two copolymers appeared as rings, indicating no preferential orientation for both PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT. The (010) diffraction peak positions in the out-of-plane direction for PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT are located at 1.457 and 1.493 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to π–π stacking distances of 4.31 and 4.21 Å, respectively. The smaller π–π stacking distance of PIBTO-TT can be explained by its more linear backbone conformation predicted by the theoretical calculation. The coherence length, which is known to be related to the degree of crystalline disorder, can be estimated using the full-width at half-maximum of the diffraction peaks via the Scherrer equation.33,34 We found that the (010) coherence lengths in the out-of-plane direction are 12.93 and 13.20 Å for PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT, respectively. It is quite reasonable because the curved backbone of PIBTO-T would interfere with its π-stacking crystallinity in the solid state. Considering that both smaller π–π stacking distance and longer π–π stacking coherence length are beneficial for charge transportation, PIBTO-TT will have an advantage in the photovoltaic application compared to PIBTO-T.

2.5 Photovoltaic performance
To obtain the correlation between the chemical structures of polymers and their photovoltaic properties, BHJ PSCs based on PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT were fabricated and characterized. The devices were optimized by varying the polymer:PC71BM weight ratios, active layer thicknesses, and solvent additives. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized devices and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Without any additive, the best performance device based on PIBTO-TT:PC71BM showed a PCE of 6.93%, while an inferior PCE of 5.53% was obtained for the device based on PIBTO-T:PC71BM. The devices based on the two copolymers showed similar Voc values due to their comparable HOMO energy levels. The inferior efficiency for the PIBTO-T:PC71BM-based device is primarily due to the lower Jsc and FF values, which depend largely on the morphology of the BHJ active layer. In order to optimize the film morphology, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was then used as a solvent additive. As shown in Table 2, with an addition of 0.5% DIO, the PCE of the devices based on PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT increased to 6.52% and 7.52%, respectively, as consequences of enhanced Jsc (12.09 mA cm−2 for PIBTO-T and 13.06 mA cm−2 for PIBTO-TT) and FF (62.04% for PIBTO-T and 65.26% for PIBTO-TT) values. The EQE spectra of the devices were measured under illumination of monochromatic light to confirm the accuracy of Jsc measurements. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the EQE curves over the solar spectrum (AM 1.5G) agree well with the Jsc values based on the J–V measurements within 3.4% error.

2.6 Film morphology and microstructure
For PSCs, the active layer morphology plays a key role in determining their photovoltaic performance. Here, the influences of π-bridge and DIO additive on the morphology of two blend films were investigated by a set of experiments including tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GIWAXS, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Firstly, the surface morphology of the blend films was studied by AFM. As illustrated in Fig. 5a and c, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of the blended films based on PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT were 0.49 and 0.45 nm, respectively. These fairly smooth surfaces suggest good miscibility between the two copolymers and PC71BM. After the addition of DIO (Fig. 5b and d), the RMS roughnesses for both blend films decrease, which could be caused by the disappearance of some large-sized aggregations. As shown in Fig. 5g, the PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blend film shows a clearer nanoscale phase separation with a small domain size of ∼20 nm, which should favour efficient exciton separation and charge transport, whereas the PIBTO-T:PC71BM blend film shows a less defined phase separation (Fig. 5e). However, no noticeable changes in AFM phase images could be observed for the two BHJ blends with DIO compared to the untreated ones. The morphology results from TEM measurements are generally consistent with those observed by AFM (Fig. S2, ESI†). More finely dispersed structures with better interconnectivity are observed in the PIBTO-TT-based blend films with or without DIO compared to those in the PIBTO-T-based counterparts.

GIWAXS measurements were then performed in order to reveal the molecular orientation in BHJ thin films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding 1D line-cuts of the blend films with and without DIO are presented in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6c and f, the out-of-plane (010) diffraction peaks for the two copolymers could not be distinguished clearly when blended with PC71BM. Meanwhile, the in-plane (100) diffraction peaks for both copolymers in their blends shift to smaller q values with respect to their pure films. These results indicate that the inter-chain packing or aggregation of PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT was disrupted by blending with PC71BM. This is supported by the good miscibility of the two copolymers with PC71BM, which will be discussed in detail later. It should be noted that the broad peaks located at q ≈ 1.35 and 1.93 Å−1 correspond to the PC71BM aggregates.35 Importantly, the in-plane (100) coherence lengths calculated using the Scherrer equation are 8.1 and 14.3 nm for PIBTO-T and PIBTO-TT, respectively, indicating a better crystallinity of PIBTO-TT in the as-cast blend film. This can partially explain the better device performance for PIBTO-TT compared to that for PIBTO-T. However, when DIO was introduced, the crystallinity and the packing distance of the two copolymers in their corresponding blends barely changed.

The AFM and GIWAXS results could only partially explain the variations in the photovoltaic performance of devices based on the two polymer blends with or without additives. Specifically, they are not able to provide other detailed morphological parameters including domain size, miscibility of PC71BM in conjugated polymers, distances between adjacent fullerenes in the miscible phase, and the D/A interfacial area which may explain the variations in the device performance for the polymer blends with or without additives. Neutron scattering is a powerful technique to characterize the morphology of the BHJ blend due to the unique contrast caused by the significant difference of scattering length density between conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives.36,37 Therefore, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were then employed to quantify the morphology of PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM prepared with or without DIO.
It is recognized that there are three types of phases in the BHJ active layer, namely pure donor phase, pure acceptor phase, and mixed donor and acceptor phase.37–40 The donor and acceptor phases should be as pure as possible to minimize charge recombination and enhance charge transportation, while the miscible phase should be as inter-mixed as possible to provide a large number of interfacial areas for efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier generation.37 Notably, the transport of generated free charge carriers to the corresponding pure phases requires sufficient fullerene loading. Lower fullerene miscibility would extend the distances between fullerenes in the miscible phase, thereby hampering charge transport and increasing the recombination of free charge carriers.24 In this work, both PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blends have high PC71BM loading (D:A = 1:3.5). This indicates that the pure PC71BM phases are sufficient, while the copolymer:PC71BM miscible phases are relatively deficient. Therefore, the amount of polymer/fullerene interfacial area, which is determined by the miscibility between the polymer and fullerene, is an important parameter that impacts the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
The SANS curves of PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blends with or without DIO are shown in Fig. 7 and the results are listed in Table 3. Detailed information about the analysis of SANS results can be found in previous studies.24,37 The average domain size for the samples is obtained by fitting the measured scattering intensity to the Debye–Bueche equation,41,42 which is described as I(q) = I0/(1 + q2ξ2)2. In this equation, ξ is the correlation length, that is, the average domain sizes of the pure copolymer and PC71BM phases, and I0 is the zero-angle scattering intensity.

As shown in Table 3, the average domain sizes of the as-cast PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blends are 19.3 and 16.5 nm, respectively, which are consistent with the morphology results observed by the AFM measurements. For the blends without DIO, the miscibility of PC71BM in the polymer increases as the π-bridge is changed from thiophene in PIBTO-T to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in PIBTO-TT. This is probably because the distance between the adjacent donor and acceptor units in the polymer backbone is enlarged with the introduction of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene group, which creates more free space allowing for fullerene intercalation. The increased miscibility results in a decrease in the distance between two adjacent PC71BM molecules from 3.7 Å in PIBTO-T to 3.1 Å in PIBTO-TT. Therefore, it is expected that PIBTO-TT:PC71BM would has a higher electron mobility than PIBTO-TT:PC71BM. More importantly, the interfacial area in the PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blend is larger than that in the PIBTO-T:PC71BM sample. All of these positive factors in the PIBTO-TT:PC71BM blend, including a larger interfacial area, a shorter distance between fullerenes in the polymer:PC71BM mixed phase and a smaller domain size, could assist efficient charge carrier generation and transport, and also suppress the charge carrier recombination, which eventually translate to the improved photovoltaic performance of PIBTO-TT:PC71BM-based solar cells in comparison with that of PIBTO-T-based devices. These results indicate that π-bridge modification is an effective strategy to modify the phase separation and alter the morphology of the BHJ film.
When the DIO additive was introduced, both blends show a decrease in the miscibility of PC71BM in the polymer and an increase in the distance between two adjacent PC71BM molecules in the miscible phase. Nevertheless, the donor/acceptor interfacial areas for PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM systems increase after the addition of DIO. As a result, exciton dissociation occurs effectively, coinciding with the increase of the values of Jsc and FF in the devices.
2.7 Charge transport properties of blend films
The influences of π-bridge and DIO additive on the charge transport properties of blend films in the direction normal to the substrate plane were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices, and Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the corresponding carrier mobility data. For the as-cast blend films, PIBTO-TT:PC71BM exhibits higher hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities than PIBTO-T:PC71BM, which can be well explained by the observations in the AFM, GIWAXS and SANS measurements as described in the previous section. The higher charge carrier mobilities could be partially responsible for the larger Jsc and FF values observed for the PIBTO-TT-based solar cells. When 0.5% DIO was introduced into the blends, the hole mobilities of PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM increased to 8.11 × 10−6 and 2.63 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. However, the electron mobilities of PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM decreased to 2.04 × 10−5 and 5.01 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This could be due to the increased distance between PC71BM in the mixing phase which disrupts the electron transport channels (Table 3). Thus, the relative imbalances between the hole and electron mobilities in both polymer blends were dramatically reduced after the addition of DIO. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the ratios between the electron mobility and hole mobility (μe/μh) for PIBTO-T:PC71BM and PIBTO-TT:PC71BM with DIO were measured to be 2.52, and 1.90, respectively, which are both lower than their untreated ones. Therefore, the more balanced charge transport properties in the DIO-treated blend is one of main reasons for the higher Jsc and FF values in the corresponding solar cells.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that replacing thiophene π-bridges in the IDTT-based polymer system with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene groups has a large impact on the backbone conformation of the resultant copolymers. Since the backbone of PIBTO-TT has a more linear conformation compared to that of PIBTO-T, closer intermolecular π–π stacking with a longer coherence length is formed for PIBTO-TT, which is beneficial for charge transport. The SANS result indicates that the miscibility of PC71BM in PIBTO-TT is better than that in PIBTO-T and, hence, the distance between two homogeneously adjacent PC71BM molecules dispersed in PIBTO-TT can be reduced. This, in turn, will suppress the recombination of free charge carriers in the miscible phase. At the same time, the PIBTO-TT:PC71BM mixture has relatively smaller domain sizes and larger polymer/fullerene interfacial areas compared to that of the PIBTO-T sample. Benefiting from these factors, a higher efficiency was achieved in the PIBTO-TT-based PSC. Additionally, the SANS results also indicate that the addition of DIO can increase the specific donor/acceptor interfacial area, thus enhancing the charge mobility and the photovoltaic performance. Overall, our study provides important information for revealing the influences of molecular structures and additives on the active layer morphology and the resultant device performance, and hence suggests a new molecular design perspective for high-performance conjugated polymers.
