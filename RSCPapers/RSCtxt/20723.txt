    , Accepted 2nd April 2023First published on 3rd April 2023AbstractElectrochemical conversion of nitrate to NH3 not only eliminates nitrate pollution in the environment, but also produces highly valuable NH3. Herein, Cu-doped Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies (Cu–Co3O4−x) was prepared on carbon cloth. The as-fabricated Cu–Co3O4−x can selectively reduce nitrate to NH3 with high Faraday efficiencies (around 90%) and a large NH3 yield of 0.83 mmol h−1 cm−2 in a neutral electrolyte.
Ammonia (NH3) is an important raw material for fertilizers and the production of various chemicals. Due to the carbon-free, hydrogen-rich, and convenient storage and transport properties, NH3 is also regarded as a promising energy carrier.1,2 At present, the industrial-scale production of NH3 still relies on the conventional Haber–Bosch process, which is extremely energy-consuming and uses fossil fuels as the hydrogen source, leading to the great emission of carbon dioxide. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a clean, energy-efficient, and sustainable method to produce NH3.3–5 The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using water and nitrogen (N2) is an alternative approach for NH3 synthesis.6–10 Despite great efforts having been made, the NRR still suffers from the low Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield of NH3, owing to the high NN bond energy (941 kJ mol−1), low solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution, and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).11–13 In contrast, the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a more feasible way for efficient NH3 production due to the relatively low NO bond energy (204 kJ mol−1) and high solubility of nitrate in water.14 Moreover, as a harmful source of nitrogen pollution, the nitrate present in groundwater can cause serious environmental problems.15 Thus, from both economic and environmental perspectives, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to NH3 powered by renewable electricity (solar, wind, tidal) is appealing, which has great potential for practical applications in the future.16 Since electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to NH3 is a complicated eight-electron transfer process with various by-products, it is critical to explore an efficient and stable NO3RR electrocatalyst with high selectivity towards NH3.
Until now, some noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, etc.) and their compounds have been reported as efficient electrocatalysts for the NO3RR to NH3.17,18 Nevertheless, the scarcity and high cost of these noble metals impede their large-scale applications. Recently, earth-abundant transition metal oxides have been explored as promising alternatives for catalyzing the NO3RR.19,20 Among these transition metal oxides, spinel-type oxides have drawn increasing attention owing to their intrinsic properties such as the multivalence structure, flexible ion arrangement, and relatively high electrical conductivity.21,22 For instance, Co3O4 has been reported as an electrocatalyst for the NO3RR, though the FE and yield of NH3 are relatively low.23 Introducing a second metal (Ni, Fe, Cu, Zn, etc.) into Co3O4 has been confirmed as an effective strategy to boost the NO3RR performance towards NH3 production, as the introduced second metal can optimize the binding strengths of reaction intermediates and improve the electrical conductivity. Oxygen vacancy, an important defect in metal oxides, is also demonstrated to be favourable for selectively reducing nitrate to NH3.24 Zhang and co-workers prepared TiO2 nanotubes with abundant oxygen vacancies (TiO2−x), which show higher NH3 selectivity and yield than pristine TiO2 nanotubes. It is suggested that the oxygen atoms in nitrate can occupy the oxygen vacancies in TiO2−x, thus weakening the NO bond of nitrate for achieving enhanced NO3RR performance towards NH3 generation.16 Yu et al. found that abundant oxygen vacancies in amorphous RuO2 can modify its electronic structure, thus lowering the energy barrier for the rate-limiting step of the NO3RR to NH3, contributing to high NH3 selectivity and yield.25 Therefore, it is well suspected that the introduction of both metal doping and oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides can be an effective strategy for achieving high activity and NH3 selectivity of the NO3RR.
In this study, Cu-doped Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies (Cu–Co3O4−x) was synthesized on carbon cloth (CC). The as-fabricated Cu–Co3O4−x catalyst showed remarkable NO3RR performance with high selectivity towards NH3 generation in neutral electrolytes, greatly surpassing Co3O4 or Cu–Co3O4 samples. When the Cu–Co3O4−x catalyst was tested in 0.25 M Na2SO4 electrolyte containing 2000 ppm NO3−, the FE of NH3 remains at around 90% at each applied potential, and the maximum NH3 yield is up to 0.83 mmol h−1 cm−2. In addition, the Cu–Co3O4−x catalyst also showed satisfactory NO3RR stability.
The synthesis procedure of self-supported Cu–Co3O4−x nanoarrays on CC is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, Co-based precursor nanowire arrays were prepared on CC via a typical hydrothermal method. Then, the obtained Co-based precursor was immersed in 10.0 mM CuCl2 solution for cation exchange, followed by annealing treatment to obtain the Cu–Co3O4 sample. Finally, abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into Cu–Co3O4 by in situ electrochemical reduction treatment to fabricate Cu–Co3O4−x nanoarrays. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the structure of the obtained samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD patterns of Co3O4 and Cu–Co3O4 samples are quite similar, which are well indexed to Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 73-1701), confirming that Cu doping did not change the crystal structure of Co3O4. As for the Cu–Co3O4−x sample, a significant peak assigned to the (400) plane of Co3O4 can still be observed, indicating that the intrinsic structure of Co3O4 was well retained after the in situ electrochemical reduction step. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Co3O4 sample in Fig. 2b and Fig. S1 (ESI†) display that seaweed-like Co3O4 nanowire arrays are covered on the CC substrate. The SEM images of Cu–Co3O4 (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2, ESI†) exhibit a similar morphology to that of Co3O4, revealing that Cu doping did not significantly change its original morphology. However, as shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the morphology of Cu–Co3O4−x is greatly altered. The overall nanoarray configuration of Cu–Co3O4−x is preserved, while relatively small-sized and contiguous nanosheets cover the surface of the nanoarrays. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Cu–Co3O4−x in Fig. 2e again demonstrates its unique morphology, as the Cu–Co3O4−x nanowire core is wrapped by ultrathin and small nanosheets. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Cu–Co3O4−x in Fig. 2f shows clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.21 nm, which is well indexed to the (400) plane of Co3O4, in accordance with previous XRD results.

The surface elemental composition and chemical valence states of the samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 3a, the full XPS survey spectrum of Cu–Co3O4−x shows the presence of Cu, Co, O, and C elements.20,26 The high-resolution Cu 2p spectrum of Cu–Co3O4−x in Fig. 3b is composed of Cu2+ 2p3/2 (934.5 eV), Cu2+ 2p1/2 (954.4 eV), and the corresponding satellite peaks, which verifies the successful Cu doping in the Cu–Co3O4−x sample.27 By contrast, no Cu 2p signal can be detected from Co3O4. The Co 2p spectrum of Cu–Co3O4−x in Fig. 3c shows that the peaks positioned at 780.9 and 796.5 eV are attributed to Co3+ 2p3/2 and Co3+ 2p1/2, while the peaks located at 782.5 and 798.2 eV are assigned to Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively.28 Co3O4 exhibits a similar Co 2p spectrum, revealing the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ species. Compared to Co3O4, the main Co 2p peaks of Cu–Co3O4−x shift noticeably to higher binding energies, suggesting that the electronic environment of Co cations was well modified in Cu–Co3O4−x. The O 1s spectrum of Cu–Co3O4−x in Fig. 3d is deconvoluted into three peaks at 530.8, 531.9 and 533.5 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (O1), oxygen vacancy (O2), and surface adsorbed oxygen species (O3),29 respectively. The Cu–Co3O4−x sample has an oxygen vacancy content of 25.9%, much larger than that of Co3O4 (17.2%), confirming that an increased concentration of oxygen vacancies was achieved in Cu–Co3O4−x. To further verify this point, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was conducted. As displayed in Fig. 3e, both Cu–Co3O4−x and Co3O4 samples display an EPR signal at g = 2.003, which is associated with electron capture via the surface oxygen vacancies. Cu–Co3O4−x exhibits a stronger EPR signal than Co3O4, indicating the presence of more oxygen vacancies in Cu–Co3O4−x.30 All the results above clearly demonstrate that Cu–Co3O4−x nanoarrays were successfully synthesized.

A series of electrochemical tests were carried out in an H-type electrolytic cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane to evaluate the NO3RR catalytic performance of Cu–Co3O4−x. Cu–Co3O4 and Co3O4 samples were also tested for comparison in the identical conditions. The generated products were quantified by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry with calibration curves (Fig. S4, ESI†). The NO3RR activity of the samples was firstly investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Co3O4 sample possesses a noticeably enhanced current density when 2000 ppm NO3− was added into 0.25 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, demonstrating that Co3O4 is capable of catalysing the NO3RR. The current density of Co3O4 can be further increased by Cu doping or introduction of oxygen vacancies, implying that the Cu–Co3O4−x sample has the highest catalytic activity towards the NO3RR (Fig. S5, ESI†). Meanwhile, the NO3RR activity of bare CC is negligible, as the current densities were much lower in the same potential window (Fig. S6, ESI†). Subsequently, chronoamperometry measurements were performed at different potentials to investigate the NH3 production rates and FEs of the samples. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the NH3 FE of the Cu–Co3O4−x catalyst remains at around 90% at each applied potential. As expected, the NH3 yield increases with the more negative applied potential, and Cu–Co3O4−x achieves a maximum NH3 yield of 0.83 mmol h−1 cm−2 at −1.05 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Notably, such high yield and FE of NH3 on Cu–Co3O4−x are also comparable to those of most previously reported NO3RR electrocatalysts (Table S1, ESI†). For the NO3RR towards NH3 conversion, nitrite (NO2−) is an important intermediate and a possible by-product. The extremely low FEs of NO2− (below 1.0%) achieved on Cu–Co3O4−x (Fig. S7, ESI†) suggest that a negligible amount of NO2− was formed during the NO3RR, contributing to its high NH3 selectivity. Fig. 4c shows that both the NH3 yield and FE of Cu–Co3O4 are lower than those of Cu–Co3O4−x at each applied potential. In detail, the FE of Cu–Co3O4 keeps at 80–85%, while the NH3 yield at −1.05 V vs. RHE is greatly reduced to 0.59 mmol h−1 cm−2. Therefore, it is suggested that the oxygen vacancies in Cu–Co3O4−x are favourable for selectively reducing nitrate to NH3, resulting in better NO3RR performance compared to the Cu–Co3O4 sample (Fig. S8, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4d, both the NH3 yield and FE of Co3O4 have downward trends, when compared to Cu–Co3O4, highlighting the crucial role of Cu doping in the electrochemical nitrate conversion to ammonia. Herein, a suitable Cu content of Cu–Co3O4−x is important for achieving excellent NO3RR performance, as the Cu–Co3O4−x sample prepared using 10 mM CuCl2 solution shows better NO3RR results than Cu–Co3O4−x samples prepared using 5 or 20 mM CuCl2 solution (Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore, both Cu doping and abundant oxygen vacancies in Cu–Co3O4−x are responsible for the greatly improved NO3RR activity and selectivity towards NH3. The catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst is determined by both the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of each active site. Therefore, the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of the samples were measured using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in a non-faradaic potential region (Fig. S10a, 11a, and 12a, ESI†). The Cdl of Cu–Co3O4−x (Fig. S10b, ESI†) is greater than those of Cu–Co3O4 (Fig. S11b, ESI†) and Co3O4 (Fig. S12b, ESI†), suggesting that Cu–Co3O4−x with the largest electrochemical active surface area can expose more catalytically active sites, contributing to its high NO3RR activity. Then, the NO3RR catalytic performance of Cu–Co3O4−x in the neutral electrolyte with different NO3− concentrations was explored. The obtained LSV curves in Fig. S13 (ESI†) show that the current density of Cu–Co3O4−x increases with increasing NO3− concentrations. When the applied potential was −0.95 V vs. RHE, the NH3 yield of Cu–Co3O4−x also keeps increasing with increasing NO3− concentration, and the maximum NH3 yield is up to 1.14 mmol h−1 cm−2 at 12000 ppm NO3− (Fig. 4e and Fig. S14, ESI†). Moreover, the NH3 FE of Cu–Co3O4−x achieves a maximum value of 92.49% at 4000 ppm NO3−. In addition, stability is another crucial factor of an electrocatalyst for practical applications. Therefore, the continuous recycling test of 10 cycles (each cycle lasts 1.0 h at −0.95 V vs. RHE) was carried out to investigate the stability performance of Cu–Co3O4−x. As shown in Fig. 4f, the Cu–Co3O4−x sample presents relatively good stability with slight fluctuations of NH3 yields and FEs during the consecutive recycling test. The XRD and SEM results of the Cu–Co3O4−x sample in Fig. S15 (ESI†) show that the intrinsic structure and nanoarray configuration of Cu–Co3O4−x were well preserved during the NO3RR cycling test. All the results above clearly validate Cu–Co3O4−x as a highly active, selective, and relatively stable electrocatalyst for the NO3RR towards NH3 production.

In summary, it is demonstrated that coupling Cu doping and oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 can greatly improve its NO3RR performance towards NH3 generation. The as-fabricated Cu–Co3O4−x sample achieves high FEs of around 90% and a maximum NH3 yield of 0.83 mmol h−1 cm−2 at −1.05 V vs. RHE in the neutral electrolyte containing 2000 ppm NO3−. This work provides a low-cost and highly efficient NO3RR electrocatalyst. Moreover, the dual metal-doping and oxygen vacancy strategy presented here can be extended to other metal oxides for catalysis or energy applications.
