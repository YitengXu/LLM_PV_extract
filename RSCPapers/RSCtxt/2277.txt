With both protic N–H and hydridic B–H bonds, three H atoms per main group element, and a low molecular weight, H3NBH3 has the potential to meet the stringent gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage capacity targets needed for transportation applications. Furthermore, devising an energy-efficient chemical process to regenerate H3NBH3 from dehydrogenated BNHx material is an important step towards realization of a sustainable transportation fuel. In this perspective we discuss current progress in catalysis research to control the rate and extent of hydrogen release and preliminary efforts at regeneration of H3NBH3.Frances H.

While significant progress is being made on complex metal hydrides such as Ti-doped NaAlH47–9 and new porous sorbent materials10–12 for hydrogen storage, these materials tend to be restricted to material capacities of less than 8 wt% hydrogen, excluding other system contributions such as fuel tank, lines, etc.13A fourth option for on-board hydrogen storage takes advantage of hydrogen stored as E–H bonds where E is a light main group element such as C, B, N, or O.14 In an early example, hydrolysis of sodium borohydride was controlled using a heterogeneous ruthenium catalyst in Millenium Cell's Hydrogen on Demand™ technology that was demonstrated in the Natrium™ car.15,16 The promise (and possibly the downfall) of such chemical hydrogen storage schemes lies in the need to regenerate the fuel, thus approaching a sustainable solution to our transportation needs. To fully appreciate this concept one can imagine that the carbon dioxide produced from burning gasoline is captured on board the vehicle and shipped to a processing plant where it is reformed back to gasoline—a tall order indeed! This need for regeneration also hinders commercialization of borohydride hydrolysis as there are currently no energy efficient routes to convert the stable borate product back to borohydride. In this perspective we explore the dehydrogenation chemistry of ammonia–borane, H3NBH3 (1), (Chart 1), a remarkable molecule which contains both hydridic B–H and protic N–H bonds and a strong enough B–N bond that under most conditions hydrogen loss is favored over dissociation to ammonia and borane. Its combination of low molecular weight (30.7 g mol−1) and high gravimetric hydrogen capacity (19.6 wt%) has attracted a flurry of recent investigations into hydrogen release from 1, highlights of which will be summarized here. We conclude with a description of preliminary efforts to regenerate 1 from dehydrogenated BNHx materials. Chart 1  Boron compounds referred to in text. 2 Preparation and physical properties of ammonia–borane, aminoborane and iminoboraneAmmonia–borane is a colorless solid that is stable at room temperature and soluble in relatively polar coordinating solvents (Table 1).17–19 The melting point of 1 is in the range 110–114 °C.19,20 Two reports claim that ultra-pure material melts at ca. 125 °C.17,21 The two most important methods for laboratory-scale preparation of 1 are salt metathesis and direct reaction. While a number of ammonium salts such as chloride,22 sulfate,23 and carbonate20 can be employed for salt metathesis, combination of ammonium formate with sodium borohydride with sonication gives 1 in high yield.24 This method also permits the facile isotopic labeling of 1 (10/11B, 1/2H, 14/15N). Direct reaction of ammonia gas with diborane (B2H6, 2),22,23,25–27 BH3·SMe217 or BH3·THF28 also affords 1 in workable yields.

A large scale synthetic method for 3 has been reported,28 wherein 2 is passed into liquid ammonia at −78 °C. In contrast to the relative thermal stability of 1, glyme solutions of 3 have been reported to undergo hydrogen loss at temperatures as low as −20 °C.19 Although compound 3 is commonly referred to as the diammoniate of diborane, its molecular structure was in dispute for several years.22,23,26,29,30 In the first report Schlesinger and Burg proposed a structure of formula [NH4][NH2(BH3)2] (3′).31 This structure was later disproved by a detailed series of papers by Parry and Shore,22,23,29,30,32 subsequent 11B NMR33 and Raman34 studies, and finally an X-ray crystal structure of [BH2(NH3)2][Cl].35,36 The B–N bonds in the latter molecule are both 1.58(2) Å, and there are relatively short Cl–N distances (ca. 3.4 Å), due presumably to Cl–H–N hydrogen bonds. The B–H and N–H bond lengths were not reported. Calculations by Gutowski et al. indicate that isomer 3′ is higher in energy than both 3 and the head-to-tail dimer of 1 even when considering solid state effects.37 Scheme 1  Symmetric and unsymmetric cleavage of diborane by ammonia. The solid state structure of 1 has been determined using both X-ray-25,27,38–40 and neutron diffraction.41 Ammonia–borane has a staggered conformation with a B–N bond distance of 1.564(6) Å in the solid state (Fig. 1). The gas phase structure of 1 determined using microwave spectroscopy reveals a significantly longer B–N bond distance of 1.6722(5) Å.42,43 X-Ray crystal structures of 1:1 and 2:1 adducts of 1 and crown ethers have shown that the N–H moieties of 1 can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with electronegative elements44–49 and the B–N bond has an intermediate distance of 1.604(32) Å.44 The solid state structure of neat 1 exhibits short BH⋯HN intermolecular contacts; the hydridic hydrogen atoms on boron are 2.02 Å away from the protic hydrogen atoms on nitrogen of an adjacent molecule, a distance less than the Van der Waals distance of 2.4 Å, an interaction constituting a dihydrogen bond.41,50–52 These dihydrogen bonding interactions in 1 have been observed using Raman spectroscopy53,54 and investigated theoretically.50,52,55–59 The stability conferred by dihydrogen bonding (ca. 90.4 kJ mol−1)59 contributes to the existence of 1 as a solid at standard conditions, thus giving 1 a more favorable volumetric hydrogen density than isoelectronic ethane. There is a phase change from orthorhombic to tetragonal as the crystal temperature is raised above 225 K,39 a phenomenon investigated using 11B NMR spectroscopy.60 Fig. 1  Low-temperature (orthorhombic) crystal structure of H3NBH3. View along crystallographic c axis. N, B, and H atoms are depicted in blue, purple, and gray, respectively. The dihydrogen bonds are delineated by dashed lines. The unit cell is demarcated by gray lines.54 Aminoborane, H2NBH2 (4), and iminoborane, HNBH (5), are the very reactive BN analogs of ethylene and acetylene. Aminoborane was prepared, isolated, and characterized at low temperature (below −160 °C) by subjecting borazine, [HNBH]3 (6), to a radiofrequency discharge.61 Other preparative methods and details of the spectroscopic properties of 4 have been reported.62–68 Monomer 4 is only stable at low temperatures or very low pressures. Similarly, the first experimental observation of 5 was by Lory and Porter in 1973 using matrix isolation techniques.69 Later the infrared spectrum of 5 was measured in the gas phase70 and using laser ablation/matrix isolation techniques.71,72 When monomers 4 and 5 are warmed or prepared in growing concentration, they promptly oligomerize.The most completely characterized aminoborane oligomer is cyclotriborazane, [H2NBH2]3 (7), an inorganic analog of cyclohexane.73 It has a dipole moment of ca. 3.0 D,74,75 and its lowest energy conformation is the chair,59 as in cyclohexane. Gas phase calculations, however, show that the twist-boat conformation is lower than the chair conformation by ca. 4.2 kJ mol−1.59 In the solid state, the ring B–N bond distances are identical within error (1.576(2) Å) and short intermolecular BH⋯HN contacts (2.29 Å) are indicative of dihydrogen bonding. Based upon the electron density observed in the X-ray crystallography data, Corfield and Shore calculated the partial charges on boron (+0.7 e), nitrogen (−0.3 e), H(B) (−0.3 e), and H(N) (+0.1 e). Additional cyclic aminoborane oligomers [H2NBH2]n (n = 2, 3, 4, and 5) were obtained by Shore and coworkers from the reaction of NaNH2 with 3 in liquid ammonia62 and characterized using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and solution molecular weight studies. Mayer later reported that dissolution of 3 in a 1:1 mixture of glyme and ammonia afforded cyclic pentamer [H2NBH2]5.76 Dissolution of 3 in neat glyme resulted in formation of acyclic [H2NBH2]n species of unknown molecular weight distribution.Acyclic oligomers [H2NBH2]n have been prepared by several methods. Shore and coworkers reported the reaction of LiNH2 with diborane in diethyl ether to generate LiBH4 and 1/n equivalents of amorphous [H2NBH2]n (n = 3–5).77 In contrast to the cyclic aminoborane oligomers, [H2NBH2]n undergoes rapid hydrolysis and its dissolution in liquid ammonia generates H2 and HB(NH2)2.78 While there are many reports of the synthesis of [H2NBH2]n, the polymer microstructure is not well understood. Since methods as varied as thermolysis and catalyzed dehydropolymerization (vide infra) result in formation of [H2NBH2]n, it is likely that there are structures including linear, branched, and cyclic oligomers.79 However, Geanangel and Rabalais proposed via mass spectrometry and XPS that [H2NBH2]n formed via thermolysis is likely a large cyclic species (n > 5) without branching.80 Computational work indicates that [H2NBH2]n likely adopts a coiled structure terminated by saturated end groups, H3N–(BH2NH2)n–BH3.59,81,82 When n = 1, a coiled structure is ca. 50.2 kJ mol−1 more stable than an uncoiled structure; when n = 2, this stabilization is ca. 100.4 kJ mol−1.59 Furthermore, Jacquemin et al. calculated that an infrared stretching frequency observed at 1380 cm−1 is attributable to a terminal NH3 group,81 suggesting that experimentally prepared polyaminoborane83 is probably of low molecular weight. While short, acyclic oligomers of 4 have not been isolated and characterized on a preparative scale, substituted analogs R2HN–BH2–NR2–BH3 (R = Me, 1,4-C4H8) have been studied.84–87 Manners and coworkers reported that these compounds have a tendency to eliminate hydrogen intramolecularly with formation of cyclic dimer [R2NBH2]2.87 This behavior may be facilitated by dihydrogen bonding interactions.82Well-characterized iminoborane oligomers are limited to cyclic trimer borazine, 6. Sneddon et al. reported the large scale synthesis of 6via thermolysis of 1 in tetraglyme at 120–140 °C.88 Borazine was continuously distilled out of the hot tetraglyme and trapped at low temperature. The X-ray crystal structure of 6 has been determined.89–91 The B–N bond distance is 1.4355(21) Å, the angle at nitrogen is 122.9(1)°, and the angle at boron is 117.1(1)°. No short BH⋯HN interactions were noted, and the dipole moment has been estimated to be less than 0.1 D.90 Borazine is a liquid under standard conditions, likely due to the lack of strong dihydrogen bonding interactions, which also accounts for its modest boiling point (55 °C). The B–N bond distance in 6 is ca. 0.15 Å shorter than that in 7, consistent with the higher bond order between B and N in 6. Recently, extended oligomers of 5 having cage and pseudo-linear structures have been investigated theoretically.92 Polyborazylene, with an empirical formula of B3N3Hx (x = 3–4) and a structure composed of cross-linked borazine motifs, was prepared via thermolysis in vacuo of neat liquid 6 at 70–110 °C.79,93,94 During this thermolysis, some low molecular weight compounds were isolated. Full characterization, including single crystal X-ray diffraction, was obtained for diborazine, 1:2′-(B3N3H5)2, and borazanapthalene, B5N5H8 (Scheme 2).79 Scheme 2  Cross-linking of borazine, via diborazine, borazanaphthalene, and p-borazaterphenyl, to form polyborazylene. 3 Electronic structure and reaction theoryAlthough 1 is isoelectronic with ethane, the structures, bonding and reactivity of the two compounds are very different. Whereas ethane contains a covalent C–C bond, the polar B–N bond of 1 (Pauling electronegativities for B and N are 2.04 and 3.04; dipole moment is 5.216(17) D)42,43 is dative with the lone pair of ammonia interacting with the empty p-orbital of borane. This difference in bonding modes is also reflected in the bond dissociation enthalpies: ethane, ΔH°dis = 376 ± 2 kJ mol−1; 1, ΔH°dis= 108.4 kJ mol−1 (calculated).95 As expected, successive substitution of H by CH3 at boron in Me3−nHnBNH3 leads to a lower B–N bond dissociation energy; the converse is true for substitution at nitrogen in H3BNHnMe3−n.96Reactions to form97–101 and to dehydrogenate 1 have been investigated theoretically. Dehydrogenation reaction energies have been calculated for successive losses of hydrogen from 1 to yield 4 (eqn (1))95,102–105 and 5 (eqn (2)) in the gas phase.95,106 H3NBH3

Himmel and Schnöckel used Gaussian98 (B3LYP method) to calculate the gas phase reaction enthalpies at 298.2 K of various main-group hydrogenation reactions.102 The reverse, dehydrogenation reactions of ammonia–borane are presented in eqn (1) (exothermic, −26.6 kJ mol−1) and eqn (2) (endothermic, 133.3 kJ mol−1). Using a coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] method, Dixon and Gutowski reported slightly different gas phase enthalpies at 298 K for eqn (1)(−21.3 kJ mol−1) and eqn (2) (131.4 kJ mol−1).95Dixon and Gutowski extended the reaction series to include dehydrogenation of iminoborane HNBH (eqn (3)), 562.3 kJ mol−1) and ammonium borohydride [NH4][BH4] (eqn (4)), −70.3 kJ mol−1 at 0 K).95 Ammonium borohydride is not stable above ca.
				−40 °C, limiting its usefulness as a chemical hydrogen storage medium. HBNH → BN + H2(3) [NH4][BH4] → H3NBH3 + H2(4)Additionally, enthalpies for the HxNAlHx, HxPBHx, and HxPAlHx systems were calculated.108 While H3NAlH3, [NH4][AlH4], H3PAlH3, [PH4][AlH4], and [PH4][BH4] have favorable reaction enthalpies, their molecular weights generally omit them from consideration for transportation-based chemical hydrogen storage.109The relative energies of 6, 7, benzene and cyclohexane have also been calculated. Benzene has a large resonance energy (150 kJ mol−1), while that of 6 is smaller (109 kJ mol−1).59 Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 6 (vide supra) indicate that all B–N distances are equal, indicating some degree of delocalization of the nitrogen lone pairs instead of alternating single and double bonds. Gas phase enthalpies have been calculated for the reactions shown in Scheme 3.59 At 298 K, the loss of hydrogen from 3 equiv. 1 (gas) to generate 7 (gas) is exothermic by −70.4 kJ per mol H2. Similarly, the loss of hydrogen from 7 (gas) to form 6 (gas) is exothermic by −26.0 kJ per mol H2. Scheme 3  Dehydrogenation of 1 to form cyclic species 7 (eqn (5)) and 6 (eqn (6)). The condensed phase reaction energetics for the dehydrogenation of 1 have recently been reported.59,110 Using density functional theory and a series of isodesmic reactions, Matus et al. concluded that loss of hydrogen from 3 equiv. 1 (solid) to generate 7 (solid) is exothermic by −25 kJ per mol H2 (Scheme 3, eqn (5)) and the loss of 3 equiv. H2 from 7 (solid) to generate 6 (liquid) is exothermic by −4 kJ mol−1 (Scheme 3, eqn (6)); thus, formation of 6 from 1 is exothermic by −29 kJ per mol H2 (Scheme 3). The intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions were quantified by comparing the heats of vaporization: ΔH°vap per BN unit is 88, 25, and 8 kJ mol−1 for 1, 7, and 6, respectively.Miranda and Ceder also examined the condensed phase reaction energetics of 1 dehydrogenation, including the 1,4-cross-linking of borazine (gas) to [B3N3H4]n (solid) and H2 (ΔH = −38.7 kJ mol−1) that extends hydrogen storage capacity beyond 2 equiv. (>13 wt%).111 If the heats of vaporization mentioned above are used to obtain a number for borazine(l) in these calculations, we can directly compare the two theoretical systems (Table 3). Clearly it has been shown that condensed phase reaction enthalpies are much more moderate than gas phase values. However, dehydrogenation reactions achieving this extent of H2 loss are quite exergonic, indicating that regeneration of 1 will require significant energy input. Regeneration of 1 using H2 gas will be limited by practically achievable hydrogen pressures (Section 5).

While many examples of the deprotonation of alkyl-substituted amine–boranes exist,116,117 very few reports of [NH2(BH3)]−, the product of deprotonation of 1, have appeared. Myers and coworkers reported the in situ synthesis of [Li][NH2(BH3)] from the reaction of 1 with n-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at 0 °C.118 This compound was used to transform tertiary amides into primary alcohols. A computational study indicates that there probably are short contacts between the lithium cation and B–H in unsolvated species.119 The ammonia–boryl radical (H3N–BH2˙) was prepared from 1 in solution and in the solid state by photochemical H˙ abstraction or by gamma-radiolysis.120 Later reports of mono- and di-substituted amine–boryl radicals indicate that the nucleophilic amine–boryl radical abstracts H˙ from the parent amine–borane forming the more stable aminyl–borane (˙NHR–BH3) radical.121,122 Finally, treatment of 1 with strong Lewis or Brønsted acids in ethereal solvents S has recently been shown to afford reactive boronium cations [BH2(NH3)(S)]+ that can serve as dehydrocoupling initiators for 1 (Section 4.5).123 A stable congener [BH2(NH3)(OEt2)][A] was isolated from treatment of an ether solution of 1 with the strong acid124 [H(OEt2)2][A] (A− = B[3,5-(CF3)2–C6H2]4−).4.2 Reactions with strong oxidantsSeveral reports in the patent literature indicate that addition of strong oxidants to 1 results in H2 evolution. These systems have been explored for use as rocket propellants125 and in high-energy chemical lasers.126,127 For example, Olah and Kuhn reported that addition of superstoichiometric amounts of complex fluoride oxidants to 1 resulted in rapid formation of H2.125 Presumably these reactions are driven by formation of strong B–F bonds (ΔH° = ca. 628 kJ mol−1) and destruction of weaker B–H bonds (ΔH° = ca. 377 kJ mol−1). A later patent issued to Chew et al. exploited the heat generated during reaction of Fe2O3 and NaBH4 to initiate the solid state thermolysis of 1.127 Other reaction exotherms have been exploited to initiate the thermolysis of 1, including the formation of the intermetallic compound Al3Ni from the respective elements.1274.3 Hydrolysis—controlled hydrogen releaseSodium borohydride hydrolysis for H2 production, a concept first reported by Schlesinger in 1953,128 has been commercialized by Millennium Cell in their Hydrogen on Demand™ system.129 Ammonia–borane is relatively stable to hydrolysis in aqueous solution when the pH is neutral or basic.21 Indeed one high-yielding method for the synthesis of D3NBH3 is dissolution of 1 in D2O.20 However, when 1 is added to an acidic solution, hydrolysis is rapid (eqn (7)). The kinetics of hydrolysis are first order in [1] and [H+].116,117,130 The relative rates of amine–borane hydrolysis have been reported (Table 4). Clearly, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1 is much faster than hydrolysis of its methyl-substituted congeners. H3NBH3 + H+ + 3H2O → 3H2 + B(OH)3 + NH4+(7)

Substrate102k2/L mol−1 s−1H3NBH3600MeH2NBH335Me2HNBH30.97Me3NBH30.012Two mechanisms have been proposed for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1.116 Either H+ interacts with the nitrogen atom, resulting in formation of NH4+ and release of BH3 which is rapidly hydrolyzed in some post-rate-limiting steps, or it interacts with a boron hydride, resulting in H2 release via a 5-coordinate boron. Through analysis of isotope effects and reaction rates, the authors concluded that the former mechanism was more likely operative (Scheme 4). Scheme 4  Brønsted acid-catalysed hydrolysis of 1.116 To solve the engineering problem of intermittent use of H2 fuel in a vehicle, Chandra and Xu proposed the use of solid and gaseous acids in the hydrolysis of 1.131 Thus, a flow system or other strategy can be envisioned wherein H2 will only be generated from 1 when H3NBH3(aq) is in contact with the acid. The authors investigated Dowex (sulfonic acid functional groups), Amberlyst (sulfonic acid functional groups), Nafion (sulfonic acid functional groups), H-Zeolites (Si–OH functional groups), and carbonic acid (from carbon dioxide).Heterogeneous metal-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1 also has been reported.132–135 The highest catalytic activity was realized with Pt/C, followed closely by PtO2 and [Rh(cod)Cl]2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Each of these catalysts resulted in evolution of 3 equiv. H2 in less than 5 min. Studies of the heterogeneous catalyst materials after reaction showed that the most active catalysts contained the smallest particle sizes and were highly dispersed. Subsequent studies showed that high activity for AB hydrolysis was found for supported Co and Ni catalysts; with a metal/AB ratio of 0.018 no ammonia gas was detected in the mass spectrum of the H2 stream.136 Hydrolysis of the related compound ammonia triborane, NH3B3H7, also proceeded readily at 20 °C using a supported Rh/SiO2 catalyst.137There are several drawbacks to aqueous chemistry for hydrogen storage. First, the system storage capacity may not be sufficient to meet long-term transportation goals due to the solubility of 1 in water and the weight of the stoichiometric water reagent (3 equiv.). The solubility of NaBH4 in water at temperatures between 0–36 °C is comparable to that of 1 (Table 1).138,139 With a ca. 35 wt% solution of NaBH4 or a ca. 25 wt% solution of 1 in water, the maximum amount of hydrogen in the chemical hydrogen storage medium is <7 wt%. Second, the hydrolysis of 1 generates NH4OH, which would be in a pH-dependent solution-vapor equilibrium with NH3(g).140–142 Volatile ammonia in the H2 stream must be removed before reaching the fuel cell.143 Finally, and perhaps of gravest concern, regeneration of 1 from the borate products of hydrolysis requires overcoming a large ΔHrxn, a problem shared with borohydride hydrolysis systems.1444.4 Thermolysis–gas phase vs. solid state vs. solutionAmmonia–borane releases hydrogen gas when heated, but the reaction rates and products formed depend quite spectacularly on the reaction conditions. In low-pressure, gas-phase thermolysis the primary intermediate of the first dehydrogenation step is aminoborane monomer 4, an observation confirmed by matrix isolation68 and mass spectrometric studies.145,146 Building on the calculations mentioned above, Nguyen et al. used high-level ab initio calculations to show that the barrier for intramolecular H2 loss from 1 in the gas phase is actually higher than its B–N bond dissociation energy!147 Their studies uncovered an efficient borane-catalyzed dehydrogenation process depicted in Fig. 2. Further experimental studies are needed to confirm the operation of this reaction pathway. Fig. 2  Proposed borane-catalyzed intramolecular dehydrogenation of 1 in the gas phase. Relative energies are in kcal mol−1. Li et al. recently reported an ab initio study of the H3NBH3 dehydrogenation reaction mechanism in the gas phase, comparing results for eqn (1) at various levels of theory.103 The authors investigated a unimolecular transition state, determining that the N–H bond lengthens more than the B–H bond during the H–H bond-forming reaction. The calculated activation energy for this process (113.9 kJ mol−1), was in accord with the observation that H2 loss from H3NBH3 occurs at ca. 100 °C. The authors also examined eqn (2), obtaining a reaction enthalpy consistent with those presented above and an activation energy of approximately 290 kJ mol−1.106Thermal decomposition of solid 1 occurs in two steps, probed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and volumetric analyses.145,148–151 The first process initiates below 97 °C, coinciding with the observed melting temperature of H3NBH3, and reaches a maximum at ca. 110 °C. During this decomposition, 1.1 ± 0.1 equiv. H2 are generated with concomitant formation of a mixture of products consisting mostly of acyclic [H2NBH2]n and 3.152 The second decomposition process occurs over a broad temperature range (ΔT = ca. 40 °C), centered at approximately 150 °C, and corresponds to loss of 1 equiv. H2 from [H2NBH2]n.145,148,153 Wolf and coworkers measured the reaction enthalpy for eqn (5) (Scheme 3) using DSC, obtaining a value (ΔHrxn = −21.7 ± 1.2 kJ mol−1) similar to that calculated by Camaioni and Autrey for solid-state formation of 7.110 Non-hydrogen volatile products generated from thermolysis of 1 varied with the rate of temperature increase.145,148,153 When the rate was less than 1 °C min−1, or when an isothermal (≤90 °C) process was undertaken, only H2 was observed in the gas phase and [H2NBH2]n was the major solid product. At higher heating rates, a mixture of products was formed. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed a mass loss from 1 that corresponded to more than 14.3 mass%, indicating formation of additional volatile products such as borazine 6. At a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, the mass loss approached 33 mass%!145,154 A similar variation of products with heating rate was observed for polyaminoborane thermolysis.153 At 1 °C min−1 the mass loss from polyaminoborane corresponded to 1 equiv. H2, whereas heating at 10 °C min−1 gave an additional mass loss of 12%.In a preliminary report Smith et al.155 analyzed the volatile gases from thermolysis of a 1–1-d6 solid mixture and observed all three hydrogen isotopologues, suggesting a bimolecular reaction pathway as reported earlier for dimethylamine–borane.156 In detailed studies by Stowe et al.157 hydrogen release from solid 1 was monitored by11B MAS-NMR spectroscopy. The decomposition was well described by an induction, nucleation and growth mechanistic pathway wherein the initial step involves isomerization of 2 equiv. of 1 to ionic isomer 3. Reaction of the latter with 1 then starts the growth process in which each B–N bond formed liberates another hydrogen molecule.Autrey and coworkers recently reported thermolysis of 1 contained within mesoporous silica scaffolds (Fig. 3).158 Ammonia–borane was deposited into SBA-15 using a methanol carrier solvent, achieving a 1:1 weight ratio between the chemical hydride and the mesoporous substrate. Nanoporous silica depressed the thermolysis onset temperature by approximately 15 °C compared to neat H3NBH3. At 80 °C the time needed to thermolyze half of the neat 1 was 290 min, compared to 85 min at 50 °C when 1 was inserted into the silica substrate (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the authors observed a suppression of formation of volatile 6, an especially important feature when considering use of this chemical hydride in conjunction with current fuel cell technology. Solid state 11B NMR was used to probe the product mixture, and only polyaminoborane was observed. Fig. 3  TEM ultratome cross-sectional image of SBA-15 showing porous channels (left) loaded with ammonia–borane (schematic, right).  Fig. 4  Arrhenius treatment of the temperature-dependent rate data yields a straight line with a gradient that is proportional to the apparent activation energy for hydrogen loss from neat 1 (●; Ea
						≈ 184 kJ mol−1) or AB in the scaffold (■; Ea
						≈ 67 kJ mol−1).158 Nanoporous silica may accelerate H2 loss from 1 in one of several ways.158 Because the channels of the silica framework impart a microstructured reaction environment, a templating effect or defect sites may be responsible for the rate increase. The molecular structure of the substrate walls includes SiOH groups that may participate in catalysis or control the product distribution. Whichever mechanism proceeds, the enthalpy of H2 release from 1 in nanoporous silica was measured as ΔHrxn = −1 ± 1 kJ mol−1, approximately 20 kJ mol−1 less exothermic than H2 loss from neat 1. The observed activation energy of thermolysis of pure 1 (Ea = 184 ± 5 kJ mol−1) was significantly larger than that for the SBA-15–1 system (Ea = 67 ± 5 kJ mol−1). Moderation of the reaction exothermicity indicates different products are forming here than in thermolysis of neat 1, a result that may have consequences for energy efficient regeneration of 1.A recent report by Cheng et al. provided a preliminary report of solid state catalysis of the solid state thermolysis of 1 by Ni1−nPtn (n = 0–0.12) submicrometer hollow spheres.135 The authors suggest that 1 may reside within and upon the metal spheres, similar to the case of nanoporous silica discussed above. While rapid dehydrogenation was observed from a mixture of the spheres and solid 1 when heated to 100 °C, there was significant mass loss (up to 24.8 wt%) from the sample indicating that volatile products other than H2 are being generated. It is possible that, like in the DSC experiments discussed above, heating rate determines the extent of mass loss.In an early study of the dehydrogenation of 4 in solution, Geanangel et al. monitored thermolysis of dilute (0.15 M) solutions of H3NBH3 in various polar, aprotic solvents at 80 °C by 11B NMR spectroscopy.112 In ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and glyme the reaction proceeded slowly (days) to give a mixture of singly- and doubly-dehydrogenated products, typically cyclic 7 and 6. Some evidence for NH3 loss or transfer was provided by observation of µ-aminodiborane (µ-(NH2)B2H5, 8) in some of the reaction mixtures. The authors also noted that increasing solvent polarity (diglyme vs. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran) appeared to lower the reaction rate.On a preparative scale, Sneddon and coworkers exploited the solution thermolysis of 1 to prepare 6 in 67% isolated yield.88 Solid 1 was added slowly (over 3 h) to tetraglyme at 140–160 °C. The evolved hydrogen (ca. 2 equiv.) and 6 were removed by vacuum and 6 was trapped at −78 °C. Borazine underwent a dehydrocoupling reaction to form polyborazylene ([B3N3H4]n) after ca. 48 h at 70 °C, and polyborazylene lost H2 to form ceramic BN above 900 °C.79,83,93,159,160Quite a different result was obtained on heating 1 in ionic liquid solvents. Bluhm et al. reported thermolysis of 1 in minimal bmimCl (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride).152 Use of this ionic liquid resulted in a lowering of the reaction onset temperature (vs. solid 1) and an increase in dehydrogenation rate at temperatures between 85–95 °C. The authors measured approximately 1 equiv. H2 per molecule of 1, and in contrast to ether solvents, observed primarily linear and branched acyclic [H2NBH2]n species, as confirmed by 11B NMR shift calculations. When the authors added 10 mol% LiNH2 to solid 1 and heated the mixture to 85 °C, they also noted an increase in reaction rate with 1 equiv. H2 generated in 3 h. In both experimental protocols, more than 1 equiv. of H2 was released when the reaction was allowed to proceed for more than 6 h. Ionic intermediates such as 3 were observed in the reaction mixtures by 11B NMR and have been implicated in rapid initiation of these dehydrogenation reactions.4.5 Acid catalysis—mechanistic insight into ammonia–borane dehydrogenation pathwaysManners and coworkers showed that B(C6F5)3 does not catalyze the dehydrocoupling of dimethylamine–borane, Me2HNBH3, (9).87 In contrast, reaction of this Lewis acid with 1 in ethereal solvents generates hydrogen even at 20 °C.123 At 60 °C addition of as little as 0.5 mol% of a strong Lewis or Brønsted acid significantly accelerates H2 production from 1. As mentioned above, the strong acid abstracts (or protonates) hydride from 1 forming boronium cation, [BH2(NH3)(solvent)]+, a species similar to 3. As in the thermolysis of solid 1, this boronium cation then reacts with an additional equivalent of 1, forming a new B–N bond and 1 equiv. of H2. At low temperatures the dehydrogenation products are a mixture of linear and branched acyclic aminoborane oligomers, as verified by 11B NMR spectroscopy.123,152 In ethereal solvents these coiled oligomers81,82 cyclize to form 7 and 6 upon mild heating, a phenomenon attributed to facile intramolecular dihydrogen bonding in solution. The stability of acyclic aminoborane oligomers in the solid state and in ionic liquids is presumably due to restricted mobility and dipole stabilization, respectively. DFT studies showed the cationic growing chain is stabilized by formation of (µ-H)(µ-NH2)-structures that maintain four-coordinate boron (Scheme 5).123 Scheme 5  Proposed mechanism of acid-initiated dehydropolymerization of 1. After hydride abstraction by an acid (a) and reaction with a second equivalent of 1 (b) resulting in the first hydrogen loss, a µ-aminodiborane-like intermediate is formed. When the acid loading is low (c), dehydropolymerization proceeds. When acid loading is high, a non-productive side reaction occurs. In this side reaction, the cationic growing chain can abstract hydride from a neutral solution species (e.g.1) (d) and the resulting oligomers can react with the boronium cation to form µ-aminodiborane by NH3 transfer (e). Two pathways for chain termination have been proposed for cationic dehydropolymerization of 1. In one, a hydride is transferred from 1 to the cationic growing chain, giving an acyclic aminoborane oligomer and regenerating the cationic boronium initiator (Scheme 5, (d)). In a second process, an ammonia molecule can be transferred between species in solution. In a combination of these two steps, due to a rate mismatch of the initiation and propagation steps, a side reaction can occur, generating µ-aminodiborane 8 (Scheme 5, (e)) and a different boronium cation, [BH2(NH3)2]+ (compound 3 with a different counteranion). This deleterious side reaction is particularly prominent at high (>10 mol%) acid loading, but is nearly eliminated when the acid loading is lowered (≤1 mol%). While acid initiated dehydrogenation of 1 may offer advantages for regeneration of BNHx uncontaminated by metals, hydrogen release rates are not yet close to targets for transportation applications.34.6 Metal-catalyzed dehydrocoupling—rates and selectivityAs is often the case, use of transition metal complex catalysts affords a much wider span of control over the rates, selectivity and extent of hydrogen release from ammonia–borane. Manners and coworkers reported the use of precious metal complexes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of amine–boranes.87,161 Dehydrocoupling of 9 using [Rh(cod)Cl]2 (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) generated cyclic dimer [Me2NBH2]2 (Scheme 6), while reactions of methylamine–borane (MeH2NBH3, 10) and 1 led to formation of borazine compounds [RNBH]3 (R = CH3, H, Scheme 6). These reactions typically require several hours, gentle heating (25–45 °C), and modest catalyst loading (0.5–5 mol%) to attain single dehydrogenation of substrate.87 The second dehydrogenation step occurs for substrate 10 after 48–72 h at 45 °C. Because 9 melts at 36 °C, experiments could be run in the absence of solvent, an important consideration when evaluating the usefulness of a reaction for on-board hydrogen storage. However, lack of solvent resulted in significantly lower reaction rates and limited substrate conversion (30%) and hydrogen production. While substituted amine–boranes 9 and 10 resulted in only one or two products, respectively, reactions of 1 generated product mixtures. Addition of 0.6 mol% [Rh(cod)Cl]2 to diglyme or tetraglyme solutions of 1 afforded intermediate products 7 and 8, followed by formation of 6, polyborazylene and other oligomers. However, these results were fairly irreproducible, with reaction times varying between 48–84 h at 45 °C. Scheme 6  Dehydrocoupling of amine–boranes using metal catalysts. Top: dehydrodimerization of dimethylamine–borane. Middle: formation of cyclic oligomers. Bottom: formation of soluble polyborazylene from borazine cross-linking. When the rhodium precatalyst [Rh(cod)Cl]2 was added to a toluene solution of amine–borane, black particles appeared after an induction period. The dehydrogenation reaction initiated immediately following the formation of these particles and was inhibited by addition of elemental mercury, suggesting the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst species. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis of an aliquot of the solution collected after a reaction time of 6 h at 25 °C revealed the presence of 2 nm rhodium nanoparticles.87,162 Subsequently, Chen et al. presented X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopic data for rhodium nanoclusters formed under similar experimental conditions.163 Evidence was found for a toluene-soluble Rh6 cluster with four-coordinate rhodium atoms surrounded by BNHx ligands. The fate of the catalyst was followed over time by in situ XAFS, and the formation of [Me2NBH2]2 was monitored by 11B NMR spectroscopy. After 45 min the concentration of active catalyst decreased sharply. Loss of hydrogen from the BNHx ligands over time may yield a less soluble rhodium cluster (similarly, the catalyst formed in the presence of 1 remains insoluble in common organic solvents).164 At the end of the reaction, the catalyst precipitated but redissolved when more 9 was added, presumably as a result of ligand exchange. Both conclusions regarding the nature of the active catalyst may be correct since the solubility of the catalyst depends on the reaction time and the amine–borane substrate.Goldberg, Heinekey and coworkers recently demonstrated that more strongly ligated metal complexes can afford very active homogeneous catalysts for dehydrogenation of 1.165 The iridium(III) ‘pincer’ complex, Ir(H)2(POCOP) (POCOP = κ3-1,3-(OPtBu2)2C6H3) exhibits unprecedented rates: 1 equiv. of hydrogen per molecule of 1 is obtained after only 14 min at room temperature utilizing 0.5 mol% Ir(H)2(POCOP). In contrast to the Rh catalyst, first order disappearance of 1 is accompanied by precipitation of a colorless solid with no observable intermediates by 11B NMR spectroscopy. Characterization of the solid product, which is insoluble in common organic solvents or water, by X-ray powder diffraction and infrared spectroscopy identified it as the cyclic pentamer [H2NBH2]5;62 the solid state 11B NMR spectrum exhibits a single resonance at −18 ppm. Monitoring these reactions by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy showed conversion of the iridium complex to tetrahydride Ir(H)4(POCOP) and eventually the inactive borohydride complex, Ir(H)(BH4)(POCOP) (Fig. 5), resulting from cleavage of the B–N bond. Interestingly, active catalyst IrH2(POCOP) could be regenerated from Ir(H)(BH4)(POCOP) by the addition of H2 gas, thus allowing for the possibility of long-lived catalyst operation with a modest hydrogen overpressure. While this unique catalyst is not effective for dehydrogenation of dimethylamine–borane (9), further mechanistic work is underway using methylamine–borane (10) to determine the potential of these Ir pincer complexes for rapidly releasing more than one equivalent of hydrogen. Fig. 5  X-Ray crystal structure (A) and drawing (B) of Ir(H)(BH4)(POCOP) (POCOP = [κ3-1,3-(OPt-Bu2)2C6H3]). In an effort to identify active catalysts derived from abundant and inexpensive base metals, Baker and coworkers studied the activity of compounds such as Ni(PMe3)4 or the cyclometallated species Fe(H)(η2-CH2PMe2)(PMe3)3 for H2 release from amine–boranes.166,167 While these complexes slowly effected dehydrogenation of 1, the reaction was accompanied by precipitation of catalytically inactive black solids and formation of Me3PBH3, consuming both substrate and catalyst without significant hydrogen production. Transition metal complexes stabilized by more electron-donating ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were then studied. In a recent report, Ni(NHC)2 complexes, generated in situ, released more than 2 equiv. of H2 from 1 at moderate rates to afford soluble polyborazylene product and a small amount of NHC–borane adduct (Fig. 6).167 Enders' carbene, 1,3,4-triphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene,168 gave the most active combination (vs. imidazolium-based NHCs) with ca. 2.5 equiv. of H2 released in 3 h in a 2:1 diglyme–benzene mixture at 60 °C. Remarkably, these Ni(NHC)2 catalysts proved to be more active than ruthenium and rhodium analogues. This report follows the recent work of Manners in which the dehydrogenation of 9 was catalyzed by the in situ generated base metal complex [Cp2Ti].169 Reactivity of this homogeneous catalyst towards 1 has not yet been reported. Fig. 6  1H-decoupled 11B NMR spectra of Ni(NHC)2-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 1 at 60 °C (NHC = Imes, N,N′-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene). Bottom (20 min) spectrum shows a sharp singlet at 28 ppm attributable to borazine, while the top spectrum (63 min) shows that the borazine has been cross-linked (broad resonances between 23–31 ppm). Other than the controversial rhodium catalyst discussed above, there are few reports regarding heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of amine–boranes. In the first report of metal-catalyzed amine–borane dehydrogenation, Roberts and coworkers heated a solid mixture of Pd on charcoal and t-BuMeHNBH3 at 120 °C to give aminoborane t-BuMeNBH2 which converted to the cyclic dimer upon cooling.122 Manners later showed that 10% Pd/C (0.5 mol% catalyst loading) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of 9 with a yield of 95% after 68 h at 25 °C. Sneddon has recently investigated the dehydrogenation of 1 in ionic liquids such as bmimCl (vide supra), including the use of heterogeneous catalysts. The use of 0.5 mol% Pd/C resulted in a modest increase in the reaction rate; a loss of 4.6 wt% H2 after 2.5 h at 85 °C was observed while uncatalyzed thermolysis of 1 in bmimCl released 4.1 wt% H2 in 3 h.152Although the detailed mechanism by which metal complexes effect the dehydrogenation of amine–boranes is still unknown, precedents in the literature suggest that the initial steps include B–H bond coordination167,170–173 followed by activation at the metal center (Scheme 7).174 While Shimoi has characterized several η1-H3B–NMe3 and based-stabilized boryl complexes BH2(NMe3), Pons and Heinekey recently demonstrated that [Cr(CO)5(η1-BH3–NHMe2)] decomposes after several hours at 20 °C to release H2 and form [Me2NBH2]2, whereas unsubstituted analogue [Cr(CO)5(η1-BH3–NH3)] reacts above −20 °C to afford H2 and uncharacterized BNHx species.175 Electron-rich metal centers have been shown previously to promote B–H bond activation of four-coordinate B compounds.174 Scheme 7  Proposed reaction pathway for initial steps of metal-catalyzed dehydrogenation of 1. In evaluating the first order rate constants for disappearance of deuterated analogues of 1 using Ni(NHC)2 catalyst, Baker et al. observed significant kinetic isotope effects for dehydrogenation of H3NBD3 (1.7) and D3NBH3 (2.3). As expected, 1-d6 gives the largest KIE, 3.0. These results imply that the rate determining step(s) involve both B–H and N–H bond cleavage or that these two steps have similar rates.166,167 While the authors did not find any evidence for irreversible B–H bond activation with the Ni catalysts, they, along with Autrey et al.163 and Manners et al.,169 observed formation of aminoborane monomers R2NBH2 (R = CH3, iPr, Cy, tBu) and RHNBH2 (R = tBu, Cy), from dehydrogenation of substituted amine–boranes. The monomers have lifetimes in solution on the order of hours depending on the identity of R, but ultimately assemble into cyclic [RHNBH2]3 (R = tBu, Cy) or [R2NBH2]2 (R = Me, Cy); iPr2NBH2 is a stable monomer. No examples of coordination of the elusive 4 to a transition metal have been reported either experimentally or theoretically and this is an area of current pursuit.Ongoing work in our labs includes unravelling the mechanism of subsequent steps in the dehydrogenation cycle, factors that disfavor formation of the insoluble pentamer [H2NBH2]5, and identification of efficient catalysts for the borazine cross-linking reaction.5 Regeneration of ammonia–boraneDuring the hydrolysis and dehydrogenation processes mentioned in the sections above, B–H bonds are cleaved and the resulting products are composed of mainly B–O or B–N bonds. Methods for the efficient regeneration of 1 from these spent materials are needed for the application of 1 as a hydrogen storage material. Calculations indicate that enthalpy of hydrolysis of 1 to form B(OH)3 and 3 equiv. H2 (eqn (9))95,107 is ca.
				−227 kJ mol−1, while that for 1 to form 1/n[B3N3H4]n and 2.3 equiv. H2 is −60.8 kJ mol−1 or less.110,111 Thus, direct hydrogenation reactions using H2 or H2-surrogates cannot regenerate 1 from either product without significant energy input. It is important to note that the hydrolysis reaction is much more exothermic than the dehydrogenation reaction, potentially permitting the latter system to be more efficient overall. H3NBH3 + 3H2O → 3H2 + B(OH)3 + NH3(9)Treatment of B–O species with strong reducing agents such as sodium hydride results in formation of B–H bonds, as demonstrated in the Schlesinger Process for the synthesis of NaBH4 from B(OH)3.144,176 Mohring and Wu point out that this process is inefficient and unoptimized. Other methods being considered for the formation of a B–H bond from a B–O bond attempt to consider the energy efficiency of the reactions involved. These could include electrochemical means.144 The particular electrochemical process outlined in eqn (10) and (11) is not efficient due to the large, single-step energy input in the cathode reaction. A challenge for chemists is to devise a scheme in which the boron center is not overreduced to BH4−, but stops at BH3. BO2− + 3H2 + 2e−
						→ BH4− + 2OH− cathode reaction(10) 2OH− + H2
						− 2e−
						→ 2H2O anode reaction(11)In a regeneration scheme proposed by Tumas et al.,177 the product (BNHx) of dehydrogenation of 1 must undergo several reactions to re-form 1 (Fig. 7). Before these reactions are initiated, it must be noted that the dehydrogenation schemes detailed above result in varied reaction products. In transition metal catalyzed reactions borazine and polyborazylene products are typical, while in ionic liquids acyclic products are observed. Specifically, the main group elements in these BNHx species are sp2- and sp3-hybridized, respectively. The first step of the regeneration scheme is digestion of BNHx. Sneddon has made a preliminary report that digestion of sp3 material is efficient using trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) forming a mixture of B(OOCCF3)3 and [B(OOCCF3)4]−.178 The second step of the regeneration scheme is reduction of B–X bonds to form B–H bonds. Sneddon accomplished the reduction of boron trifluoroacetates using trimethylamine-alane,178 and Tumas et al. reduced chlorocatecholborane (ClBCat, Cat = [C6H4-1,2-(O−)2]) with a tin hydride.177 Jenkner patented a method for reactions of B–OR and B–Cl species with SiH2R2 reagents for the synthesis of B–H species.179,180 In the case of B–OR species, the reaction mixture was heated between 100–250 °C. In contrast, the reaction of B–Cl with silicon hydrides is exothermic by approximately 200 kJ mol−1 (eqn (12)). Murib and coworkers reported the direct hydrogenation of BCl3 utilizing a silver catalyst at 700–750 °C; below 400 °C the extent of conversion is small. In this case, BHCl2 is the initial product, but it disproportionates upon cooling to give B2H6 and BCl3.181 The final steps in the regeneration scheme are substituent redistribution and ammoniation. Reaction of catecholborane (HBCat) with diethylaniline results in formation of diethylaniline–borane (PhEt2NBH3), which reacts smoothly with ammonia to form 1.177 While individual regeneration steps have been demonstrated, further work in this area is needed to identify an energy efficient system in which all steps are optimized. 2BCl3 + 2SiH4
						→ B2H6 + 2SiCl3H(12) Fig. 7  Proposed regeneration scheme. 6 Prospects for transportation-based hydrogen storageJust as the World's increasing demand for stationary power will likely be met by a suite of energy sources including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, wave, etc., transportation needs may also be addressed with a combination of solutions. While complex metal hydrides such as Ti-doped NaAlH4 currently suffer from limited storage capacity, slow rehydrogenation kinetics, and difficult heat management, improved versions may find application in hybrid hydrogen tanks for limited range applications such as urban travel.182 Although high storage capacities (ca. 7 wt%) for hydrogen sorbents such as metal organic frameworks have only been attained at high pressures (ca. 9 MPa) and low temperatures (77 K), the kinetics of hydrogen release and absorption are excellent.183 Organic chemical hydrides such as N-ethylcarbazole (<7 wt%) may provide convenient agents for hydrogen distribution, undergoing metal-catalyzed hydrogenation at the hydrogen production site and hydrogen release at the refueling station.184 While hydrogen storage utilizing ammonia–borane also is challenging as detailed above, this strategy offers a unique advantage: hydrogen production need only occur at the anode of the fuel cell.7 Conclusions and outlookAmmonia–borane is a promising material for transportation-based hydrogen storage. The methods for releasing H2 from 1 are varied and, while catalysed hydrolysis provides a storage capacity of 7 wt% and a fast reaction rate, there are currently no energy efficient methods for regenerating 1 from the resulting products. Studies to date of the dehydrogenation of 1 are starting to elucidate reaction pathways to selectively produce either sp2 or sp3 BNHx products (Scheme 8), leaving the question of which hybridization will lead to an energy efficient regeneration scheme. Homogenous catalysts for dehydropolymerization of 1 have provided examples of practical rates with an Ir catalyst and excellent extent of dehydrogenation with a Ni catalyst that affords soluble polyborazylene, but currently no catalysts have achieved both a rapid rate and acceptable extent of dehydrogenation. In addition, thermodynamic calculations show that the energy released in formation of BNHx products from 1 is much less than that from hydrolysis. Nonetheless, if further research is successful in finding new catalyst systems that provide practical rates and gravimetric and volumetric storage capacities, it will likely be necessary to ‘heterogenize’ these catalysts in order to develop a controllable hydrogen generation system. Furthermore, solvents like water, glyme, and ionic liquids added to facilitate catalysis or movement of 1 within an engineered storage system dramatically reduce the hydrogen storage capacity. Methods for the liquefaction of 1, possibly including the addition of substituted amine–boranes that can participate in dehydrocoupling chemistry,185,186 are required. The greatest technical barrier, however, lies in the discovery of energy-efficient regeneration routes—a challenge for inorganic chemistry, the solution of which could point the way to sustainable transportation for future generations.

Frances H. Stephens	Fran Stephens was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, in 1977 and grew up in Circle Pines, Minnesota, USA. After she received her BS degree from the University of St. Thomas in 1999, she joined the group of Kit Cummins at MIT, where she studied the activation of white phosphorus by low-valent molybdenum and uranium complexes. She obtained her PhD in 2004 and subsequently joined the chemical hydrogen storage research team at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) as a Director's Postdoctoral Fellow with Tom Baker. Fran was promoted to LANL Technical Staff Member in 2006 in the Inorganic, Isotope, and Actinide Chemistry group. Her research interests include the application of main-group chemistry to energy security.
Vincent Pons	Vincent Pons was born in Toulouse, France, in 1974. After obtaining his Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies at the Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France) in 1999, he joined the group of Professor D. Michael Heinekey at the University of Washington (Seattle, United States) in the fall of the same year. During his graduate studies, he studied the binding and activation of dihydrogen by transition metals. He earned his PhD in 2004 and, after a first postdoctoral stay at the University of Washington working with both Professors D. Michael Heinekey and Karen I. Goldberg, he moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory where he has been working since 2006 with Dr R. Tom Baker and Professor Larry G. Sneddon (University of Pennsylvania) as a joint postdoctoral research associate. His current research interests include the understanding of the mechanism of dehydrogenation of amine–borane adducts and the investigation of nanoparticles in ionic liquids as dehydrogenation catalysts.
R. Tom Baker	R. Tom Baker grew up in Tsawwassen, British Columbia, Canada. He received his BSc degree from UBC in 1975 and his PhD from UCLA in 1980 with M. Frederick Hawthorne. After a postdoctoral stint with Philip S. Skell at Penn State, he joined the staff at DuPont Central Research in Wilmington, DE, where he applied inorganic and organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis to the nylon, fluoroproducts, and titanium dioxide businesses. He joined the Chemistry Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1996 and is currently involved in multifunctional catalysis approaches to low-temperature hydrocarbon functionalization and chemical hydrogen storage.

 	Fig. 4  Arrhenius treatment of the temperature-dependent rate data yields a straight line with a gradient that is proportional to the apparent activation energy for hydrogen loss from neat 1 (●; Ea
						≈ 184 kJ mol−1) or AB in the scaffold (■; Ea
						≈ 67 kJ mol−1).158	 

 	Scheme 5  Proposed mechanism of acid-initiated dehydropolymerization of 1. After hydride abstraction by an acid (a) and reaction with a second equivalent of 1 (b) resulting in the first hydrogen loss, a µ-aminodiborane-like intermediate is formed. When the acid loading is low (c), dehydropolymerization proceeds. When acid loading is high, a non-productive side reaction occurs. In this side reaction, the cationic growing chain can abstract hydride from a neutral solution species (e.g.1) (d) and the resulting oligomers can react with the boronium cation to form µ-aminodiborane by NH3 transfer (e).	 

 	Scheme 6  Dehydrocoupling of amine–boranes using metal catalysts. Top: dehydrodimerization of dimethylamine–borane. Middle: formation of cyclic oligomers. Bottom: formation of soluble polyborazylene from borazine cross-linking.

Bottom (20 min) spectrum shows a sharp singlet at 28 ppm attributable to borazine, while the top spectrum (63 min) shows that the borazine has been cross-linked (broad resonances between 23–31 ppm).
