    , Accepted 14th September 2020First published on 15th September 2020AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite materials exhibit excellent memristive properties, such as high ON/OFF ratio and low switching voltage. However, the toxicity of lead and poor stability strictly limit their further commercial applications. Herein, a high-quality nontoxic and stable AgBiI4 perovskite film is successfully synthesized via a low-temperature dynamic hot casting method, and resistive switching (RS) memory devices based on AgBiI4 are reported for the first time. The RS memory devices with the ITO substrate exhibit typical bipolar nonvolatile memory behaviors with an ultralow operating voltage (≈0.16 V), high ON/OFF ratio (≈104), reversible RS by pulse voltage operation (>700) and long data retention (>104 s), superior to those of most of the other perovskite-based memory devices. Furthermore, a high performance flexible nonvolatile resistive switching (RS) memory device based on a AgBiI4 perovskite with a PEN substrate is fabricated. The flexible device also displays good stability under repeated bending tests (>1000 cycles). By analyzing the current–voltage responses, and the transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, we propose a mechanism involving conducting filaments formed by Ag cations to describe the RS behavior of the Ag/PMMA/AgBiI4/ITO device. Our work demonstrates that AgBiI4 is promising for nonvolatile memory devices and paves the way for realizing low-power consumption flexible nonvolatile memory devices.
1. Introduction
Resistive switching random-access memory (ReRAM) has received enormous attention for applications as data storage devices and synaptic components with the advantages of fast switching speed, high integration density and low power consumption.1–8 Moreover, the simple structure of metal–insulator–metal used for ReRAM has potential for a high integration density and even overcomes the scaling limitations of the current silicon-based flash memory technologies.1,9 Flexible electronics have been attractive for their bendable, foldable, stretchable, or wearable features,10–15 where flexible memory devices are highly desirable. To date, flexible memristors have been rarely reported, despite the fact that plenty of materials with resistive switching characteristics have been widely investigated.16,17 Among those used in ReRAM, inorganic oxide materials have been receiving much attention in the past few years, especially, for inorganic perovskite materials such as PrxCa1−xMnO3 (PCMO),18 SrTiO3 (STO),19 and BaTiO3.20 However, perovskite oxide films suffer from high-temperature processing and rigid ceramic films, which limits their application in flexible electronics.
Solution processed organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have demonstrated remarkable performance for various applications (such as solar cells,21,22 light-emitting diodes,23 thin-film transistors24 and electronic memories25,26). The excellent performance of perovskites has been attributed to the outstanding material properties (strong optical absorption, tunable band gap, ambipolar charge transport, and long electron–hole diffusion length27–29). Unfortunately, the toxicity of lead hinders further large-scale and commercial application of lead-based perovskite materials. It is absolutely necessary to replace lead in perovskites by nontoxic elements.30 Efforts have been made to replace lead with its IVA members – tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge).25 Perovskites based on Sn or Ge still exhibit extremely inferior stability because of the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ or Ge2+ to Ge4+ when exposed to ambient air.31,32 Han et al. reported that the addition of Sn2F to the precursor solution of CsSnI3 reduces Sn4+ formed by oxygenated Sn2+, improving the stability of CsSnI3 based memory devices.33 Wang et al. improved the stability of CsSnI3 films by the addition of triphenyl phosphite (TPPi).34 However, the inherent instability of Sn2+ is not completely resolved. A VA group element Bismuth (Bi) is emerging to address the issues of toxicity related to lead halide perovskites with higher stability.35–38 Cs3Bi2I9, a member of A3Bi2X9 (A = CH NH3, Rb, Cs, and NH4; X = Br, Cl, and I), based flexible memristors have been reported.17 The intrinsic layered feature of Cs3Bi2I9 makes it difficult to form subsequent films and realize a high integration density. Cheng et al. reported an environmentally robust memristor based on Cs2AgBiBr6, exhibiting outstanding humidity and thermal stability. However, the relatively high set and reset voltages inhibit its application in low-power consumption nonvolatile memory electronics.39 Recently, the Ag–Bi–I ternary family has been successfully applied in solar cells due to its great semiconducting properties40 and high film quality. For instance, Ag3BiI6,41 Ag2BiI5,41 AgBiI442 and AgBi2I543 with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.3%, 2.1%, 2.1% and 1.22%, respectively, have been reported in solar cells, whereas, the use of the Ag–Bi–I ternary family in resistive switching (RS) memory devices has not been reported yet.
Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of memristors based on a AgBiI4 perovskite layer for the first time. The AgBiI4 perovskite layer is synthesized via a dynamic hot casting method44 with the highest temperature lower than 150 °C, which makes it possible to prepare it on a flexible substrate. The obtained memristors with the ITO substrate exhibit typical bipolar nonvolatile memory behaviors with a simple structure of Ag/PMMA/AgBiI4/ITO, and show good electrical characteristics. The flexible devices with the PEN substrate show good flexibility and bending stability. Our work provides a novel approach to realize high-performance, flexible nonvolatile memory devices.
2. Result and discussion
AgBiI4 perovskite layers are prepared by a dynamic hot casting method,44 as shown in Fig. 1a. A hot precursor solution of perovskite is drop-casted onto a preheated substrate during the spinning process. Before the end of the spin-coating process, chlorobenzene is splashed over the rotating substrate to perform anti-solvent treatment. Finally, the substrate is annealed to remove the residual solvent and ensure good crystallinity. The dynamic hot casting method results in a highly uniform and pin-hole free morphology with large grains due to the fast evaporation of solvents. Fig. 1b shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the prepared perovskite layer. The surface grain size is approximately 300 nm according to a planimetric method involving the counts of the number of grains within a given area.45 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement is performed to characterize the surface morphology (Fig. 1c). The root mean square (RMS) roughness is calculated to be 18.7 nm. The ultra-smooth surface of AgBiI4 promotes the deposition of subsequent films. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of AgBiI4 are shown in Fig. 1d. The strong diffraction peaks demonstrate that the obtained film is the cubic-phase structure of AgBiI4.46,47 Impurity of Ag2BiI5 is also observed in peaks marked as #.

Fig. 2a depicts the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Ag/PMMA/AgBiI4/ITO device. The thickness of the AgBiI4 perovskite layer between the ITO substrate and the Ag electrode is about 500 nm. It is reported that the migration of the metal cations from the electrode will induce degradation of the perovskite layer.48 To address this problem, we insert an ultrathin PMMA layer between the AgBiI4 perovskite layer and the Ag electrode. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the device with the insulating PMMA layer has a silver electrode with a sharper outline compared to the one without the PMMA layer. Here the PMMA layer acts as a protective layer, not only avoiding the reaction of the perovskite film with the top electrode but also protecting the perovskite film from moisture and oxygen under ambient conditions. In our study, the PMMA layer is very thin. Ag+ can go through the PMMA layer easily under an external electric field. The PMMA layer shows no resistive behavior under cyclic scanning from 1 V to −1 V and has little effect on the RS properties of the memory device (Fig. S2, ESI†).49 Interestingly, the device without the PMMA layer exhibits a much higher ON/OFF ratio instead (Fig. S3, ESI†). This can be attributed to the fact that the diffusion of the Ag electrode promotes the decomposition of the AgBiI4 layer into silver iodide, which is proved to be an effective memristor material.50,51 An irregular layer of AgI is formed around the Ag electrode in the device without PMMA. The implantation of AgI makes the ON/OFF ratio higher. However, the memory device without the PMMA layer suffers from a large operating voltage and irregular SET and RESET processes. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of AgBiI4 is presented in Fig. 2b. The average interplane distance of the lattice fringes is measured to be 0.329 nm, consistent with the XRD result of the (111) planes. The clear lattice fringes indicate that the obtained AgBiI4 is a high-crystallinity polycrystalline film. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis is further carried out to study the distribution of the elements. As shown in Fig. 2c–e, the Ag, Bi and I elements are evenly distributed throughout the films.

The memory properties of the AgBiI4 based devices are illustrated by performing resistive switching characteristic measurements in air at room temperature. The square Ag electrodes are deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask with a working area of 2.5 × 10−3 cm2. The measurement is carried out under DC voltage bias sweeping in a routine of 0 → 1.0 → 0 → −1.0 → 0 V with a current compliance of 1 mA to prevent permanent breakdown of the devices. Fig. 3a shows the typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the Ag/PMMA/AgBiI4/ITO devices. Initially, the device exhibits a low current (10−9–10−8 A) in the high resistive state (HRS) indicating that a pin-hole free AgBiI4 perovskite film has been deposited on the ITO/glass. During scanning from 0 to 1 V when subjecting to a positive bias, the device switches to the low resistive state (LRS) at around 0.16 V with an abruptly increasing current (10−4–10−3 A) which is termed as the SET process. When a negative voltage back sweeping from 0 to −1 V is applied, reverse switching from the LRS to the HRS occurs at about −0.16 V, corresponding to the RESET process. It is worth emphasizing that the operating voltage of the AgBiI4 based memory device is very low, which is an outstanding merit for its potential application in low consumption devices. To examine the uniformity of the device operating voltage, the SET and RESET voltages of 65 unit cells are analyzed through boxplots. As depicted in Fig. 3b, the average absolute values of the SET and RESET voltages are around 0.16 V, very small compared to most of the reported memory devices.52,53

Data retention properties are an important factor for memristors. Our devices are measured with a reading bias (Vreadout) of 0.02 V to demonstrate the electrical reliability (Fig. 3c). Both the HRS and LRS states can be maintained up to 104 s, proving their reliable nonvolatile memory behavior. Switching endurance is very important to determine the reliability of the nonvolatile memory devices. Alternating current (AC) voltage pluses are applied to measure the endurance of resistive switching (Fig. S4, ESI†). With repeated write/erase voltage pulses of ±3 V (1.25 ms) and a read voltage of 0.01 V, the resistance values are collected up to 700 cycles. Uniform resistive switching behavior is observed without obvious degradation. These results demonstrate the great potential of AgBiI4 for nonvolatile memory devices in terms of reliability and reproducibility.
Owing to the low-temperature fabrication process, the AgBiI4 layer can be deposited onto the flexible substrates easily. We fabricated flexible AgBiI4 memory devices on PEN. The I–V characteristic of the flexible device is shown in Fig. 3d. Obviously, the operation voltage of the flexible device is similar to that of the rigid one. A slight decrease of the ON/OFF ratio may result from the increased defects in the AgBiI4 films, considering the difficulty for flexible substrates to maintain the temperature after pre-heating. Repeated bending tests were further performed in ambient air to check the mechanical reliability of the flexible devices (the insets in Fig. 3e). It is worth pointing out that we could not fix the contact points in the electrodes during the bending test, leading to slight changes in the resistances of the HRS and the LRS. However, the ratio of the HRS current to the LRS current (about 102) is maintained over 1000 bending cycles (Fig. 3e). These results indicate that the AgBiI4 based flexible memory devices show good mechanical stability.
To compare the RS properties of the AgBiI4 based devices with those of the other perovskite RS devices,54–64 we plotted the ON/OFF ratio vs. the reciprocal of the SET voltage (VSET) as shown in Fig. 3f, and listed various perovskite-based RRAM devices in Table S1 (ESI†). It clearly demonstrates that our device has a relatively high ON/OFF ratio of 104 together with the lowest VSET value.
We investigate the conduction mechanism of AgBiI4 based memory devices with logarithmic I–V plots for the positive-voltage region (Fig. 4a). In the HRS, the I–V plots display an ohmic region, a Child's law region and a sudden current increase region, corresponding to Space Charge Limited Conduction (SCLC)65 theory fundamentally. At a low electric field (0–0.08 V), the slope of 1.06 is indicative of ohmic conduction. When the voltage is increased from 0.08 V to 0.14 V, the injected electrons dominate the conduction mechanism, making the current flow proportional to the square of the bias voltage. The current abruptly increases and the slope changes to 1.2 indicating the formation of a conducting filament with a voltage bias larger than 0.14 V. The abrupt increase of the current can be explained by trap-filled SCLC or conduction through metal filaments. If trap-filled SCLC dominates the transport, SCLC, Poole–Frenkel emission, and ohmic conduction are observed sequentially in the LRS when the bias voltage decreases. However, the charge carrier transport behavior shows ohmic conduction in the LRS with a slope of 1.1. As a result, we attribute the resistive switching phenomenon to the formation and disruption of the Ag filaments. Fig. 4b depicts the current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of Au/AgBiI4/ITO, which does not show RS behavior, further proving that Ag plays a major role in the resistive switching phenomenon.

A cross-sectional TEM image of the memory device after SET operation is shown in Fig. 4c. Ag nanoparticles are observed around both the ITO and Ag electrodes inside the AgBiI4 layer. With a positive bias applied to the Ag electrode, the Ag atoms are oxidized into Ag cations. The Ag cations then diffuse towards the ITO electrode under the electric field, and are reduced to Ag atoms at the interface of AgBiI4/ITO. With the accumulation of Ag atoms, the Ag filaments start to grow.66Fig. 4d presents the HRTEM image of region 2 in Fig. 4c. The average interplane distances of the lattice fringes are measured to be 0.207 and 0.230 nm, consistent with the XRD result of the (200) and (111) planes, respectively. EDS analysis is performed to further prove the existence of Ag nanoparticles. Fig. 4e depicts the distribution of Ag along the lines marked in Fig. 4c. Silver iodide breaks down into metallic silver and iodine when exposed to light. To exclude the possibility that the silver nanoparticles come from the decomposition of silver iodide, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test of the untreated AgBiI4 film was conducted (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The predominant elements of the samples are Ag, Bi and I. As shown in Fig. 4f, the two peaks at 367.7 and 373.7 eV can be assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, further certifying that silver exists in the form of Ag+ cations.67 The I 3d XPS peaks (Fig. S5b, ESI†) can be resolved into two individual peaks (630.3 eV and 618.8 eV), corresponding to the band energies of I 3d3/2 and I 3d5/2, which is the characteristic of I− in AgBiI4.68 Fig. S5c (ESI†) shows the high-resolution Bi 4f spectra. The two typical peaks occurring at 159.4 and 164.8 eV are assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively.69 These results indicate that the Ag nanoparticles originate from the dissolution of the Ag electrode by oxidation and reduction of the Ag cations in the active layer. Table S2 (ESI†) shows the ratios of Ag, Bi and I elements, which are very close to the theoretical ratio of 1:1:4, also confirming the existence of AgBiI4.
The mechanism for the RS behavior of the Ag/PMMA/AgBiI4/ITO device is shown in Fig. 5. We perform ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis to investigate the energy level alignment of the devices (Fig. 5a). The Fermi level (EF) of AgBiI4 is estimated to be −5.03 eV (EF = Ecut-off − 21.21 eV). The EVB of AgBiI4 is calculated to be −6.30 eV (EVB = EF − EF, edge). The band gap (Eg) of AgBiI4 is 1.86 eV.46ECB determined from ECB = Eg + EVB is found to be −4.44 eV. The band diagram depicted in Fig. 5b illustrates the interface reaction between the electrode and the AgBiI4 layer. The AgBiI4 layer has Ohmic contact with the ITO and Ag electrode layer. Fig. 5c illustrates the schematic diagram for the RS mechanism. When a positive bias is applied on the Ag top electrode, the metallic Ag loses electrons and is oxidized into Ag cations. Then the generated Ag cations in the AgBiI4 layer migrate to the ITO under the applied electric field. The Ag cations reach the ITO electrode, and the Ag cations are reduced to metallic Ag and the growth of metallic Ag occurs, forming a metal filament between the ITO electrode and the Ag top electrode. When a negative bias is applied on the Ag top electrode, disruption of the filament occurs due to Joule-heating-assisted dissolution.

3. Conclusion
In summary, a nontoxic and stable AgBiI4 film is successfully synthesized by a low temperature process, and RS memory devices are fabricated based on AgBiI4 for the first time. The RS devices with the ITO substrate exhibit typical bipolar switching characteristics with good electrical performance such as ultralow operating voltage (≈0.16 V), high ON/OFF ratio (≈104), reversible RS by pulse voltage operation (>700), and long data retention (>104 s). In addition, flexible RS devices with the PEN substrate are also successfully fabricated, which display good stability (>1000 cycles) under repeated bending tests. Based on the analysis of the current–voltage responses and the TEM results, we propose that the resistive switching phenomenon is caused by the formation and disruption of the Ag filaments. Our work opens up new avenues for the realization of high-performance, flexible nonvolatile memory devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
An ITO substrate with a 14 Ω □−1 resistance (NSG-14) was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd. in Japan. Anhydrous ethanol, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 37 wt% hydrochloric acid in water and zinc powder were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Anhydrous chlorobenzene, AgI and BiI3 were purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylformamide (≥99.9%) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. All materials were used without further purification.
4.2 Device fabrication
The ITO/glass was ultrasonically cleaned with de-ionized (DI) water, acetone and ethanol sequentially and then dried with a N2 blow gun. To ensure good wettability, the substrates were treated by UV–ozone for 15 min. A precursor solution of AgBiI4 was prepared by dissolving a mixture of BiI3 (353.8 mg) and AgI (140.8 mg) in a 1 ml DMF:DMSO (1:1) mixture under stirring for over 2 h at 65 °C. To improve the coverage of the perovskite layer, the precursor solution was deposited through a dynamic hot casting method.41 Before spin-coating, the precursor solution and the substrates were preheated at 100 °C. Then the hot precursor solution was spread onto the substrate, followed by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s. At 10 s before the end of the spin-coating process, chlorobenzene (125 μl) was splashed over the rotating substrate to perform anti-solvent treatment. The substrates were subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 30 min on a hotplate. After the deposition of the perovskite layer, a solution of PMMA in chlorobenzene (1 mg ml−1) was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The device was then annealed for 5 min. To complete the device preparation, 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm top electrodes were deposited on PMMA by thermal evaporation (<1 × 10−3 Pa) using a quartz crystal monitor to determine the thickness and the deposition rate.
4.3 Measurement and characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) diagrams were collected using XRD analysis (PANalytical PW3040/60) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from 10° to 50°. The surface morphology of the devices was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Helios NanoLab G3). The EDS elemental mapping and cross-sectional images of the devices were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 S-TWIN). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on a photoelectron spectrometer (VG Multilab 2000 X, Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The morphologies and roughness of the AgBiI4 perovskite surfaces were characterized by AFM (SPM9700). The resistive switching behavior was measured using an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands).
