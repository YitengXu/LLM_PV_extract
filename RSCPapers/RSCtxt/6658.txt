    , Accepted 19th September 2011First published on 12th October 2011AbstractNanostructured materials have attracted recent research interest as battery materials due to their expected enhancement of properties. The characteristic nanoscale dimension and its structuring guarantees improved charge and mass transfer during charge/discharge processes. Among the potential cathode materials investigated as a substitute to LiCoO2, one of the most promising materials is LiFePO4 with olivine structure (LFP). In this perspective article, the current research and development in the synthesis and electrochemical studies of nanostructured LFP are reviewed with a special emphasis on one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures and nanocompositing with 1D conductive materials. In addition to various examples of 1D LFP with detailed synthetic methods, why 1D nanostructures could be meaningful is discussed in terms of a geometric point of view and the anisotropic lithiation/de-lithiation mechanism of LFP.
1. Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) shape of materials has been explored in a wide range of applications such as in solar cells,1 electrochromic devices,2 field emission displays3 and so on. The merits caused by the 1D structure stem not from an identical reason but from various ones depending on material properties and/or principles of applications. For example, solar cells based on 1D TiO2 materials show an enhanced performance because the semiconducting material of 1D has a continuous and direct pathway from the point accepting electrons from dye to a current collector.4 The high aspect ratio of 1D electrodes of field emission displays is required to obtain high efficiency.5 Also, 1D conducting polymers lead to a fast-responsive electrochromism because of their enhanced mass transfer rate of dopants through side walls of the 1D structure.6 The lesson of the use of 1D structure from the above examples has been also applied to the field of lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

        LiFePO4 with olivine structure (LFP) has attracted scientific and industrial concerns as a cathode material of LIBs. Especially, it is considered as one of the most potential candidates as a cathode for electric vehicles (EVs) and stationary storage applications. Its potential comes from high capacity (Q = 170 mA h g−1), material abundance of iron and enhanced safety. Its relatively low working potential (Ew) at 3.45 V (cf. 4.1 V for LiMnO2 with spinel structure) is a demerit resulting in low energy density (QEw) during discharge. In terms of charge, however, it turns to be an advantage of LFP because the large margin of voltage between Ew and the charging voltage (normally 4.3 V) enables high-rate charging. On the other hand, the compound suffers from low ionic and electronic conductivities (∼10−5 and ∼10−9 S cm−1 respectively),7,8 which were the main obstacles to hinder reaching the theoretical capacity even at low discharge rates and to result in poor rate capability. Other disadvantages include low density (3.6 g cm−3, theoretically) and poor discharge performance at low temperatures. However, researchers have successfully overcome some of the limitations through various strategies. The solutions can be classified mainly into three. Reduction in the particle size diminishes the effective diffusion length of both lithium ions and electrons, increasing both bulk ionic and electronic conductance over a particle (not conductivity).9,10 The second approach is coatings of or composites with conductive phases.11,12 Most of the reported works in this area are on carbon-based coatings/composites to enhance the electronic conductivity. Cationic or anionic doping has been employed by various groups as a means to augment the electronic conductivity.13
The scientific interest in LFP is confirmed by analyzing the number of published information such as journal articles, patents and conference proceedings (via using SciFinder, Fig. 1). The research and development of LFP have been tremendously accelerated since the year 2000 at the average increasing rate of 40 publications per year (from several in 2000 to about 400 in 2010). Based on the enough amount of information, various aspects of LFP have been reviewed. Since 2008, as long as we know, 8 reviews or equivalents were devoted only to LFP14–21 while 7 reviews about nanostructured materials20,22–27 and 5 reviews of more comprehensive topics28–32 covered LFP. Topical reviews focused on computational approaches,33,34 conduction phenomena,35 thermodynamics,36electrospinning processes37 and market and applications38 of electrode materials including LFP. Instead of covering comprehensive contents, therefore, we focused on 1D LFP materials or nanocomposites of LFP combined with 1D electronic conductors in this perspective. Our concern concentrated on not only how to synthesize the 1D materials but also why they would have a valuable possibility.

2. Why 1D structure? From the viewpoint of geometric consideration
Nanomaterials are defined by a morphological nanoscale that is usually smaller than 100 nm, spanning from nano-sized to nanostructured ones. Nano-sized materials are the materials with at least one dimension on the nanoscale as a monolith (e.g.nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanoribbons) while nanostructure is the structure with nanoscale morphological features which is built by the combination of nano-sized monolithic materials and nanoscale empty space (e.g. nanoporous structure, the secondary structure consisting of primary nanoparticles). Nanomaterials would gain a meaning only in the case of having special properties originating from their nanoscale dimensions. Electrodes based on nanomaterials provide various advantages and there have been growing evidences that nanostructured electrode materials lead to improved battery performances.22,39 Nano-dimensions reduce the length of the electronic and ionic transport, resulting in enhanced rate capabilities based on fast kinetics.10,40 By using the merits, the time required for charging EVs could be reduced and the batteries would be used longer without charging even at high power situations. Also, nanomaterial-based electrodes can accommodate more effectively the strain caused by volume changes upon lithium intercalation/deintercalation.41 The possibility of electrode cracking and volume expansion is reduced with nanomaterials, potentially extending the cycle life of cells.42
The nanoscale feature size increases a fraction of surface molecules over the total mass, making the interfacial area between electrodes and electrolytes larger. Even if the larger surface provides more number of reaction pathways for lithium intercalation/de-intercalation, undesirable electrode/electrolyte reactions are unfortunately induced in addition to desirable ones, reducing the merit of the use of nanomaterials as electrodes. To depress the side reactions leading to self-discharge, poor cyclability, short calendar life and poor safety, a proper coating layer should be devised, which implements a necessary requirement of lithium ion permeability.43 The particle packing density of nanomaterial-based active materials is typically lower than that of conventional macro-materials of a dimension larger than several μm, indicating that nanomaterials would have a disadvantage of lower volumetric energy density.44
Research and development in the field of LIBs are constantly looking for the way to design more efficient nanomaterials in which their pros can be distinguishably emphasized and their cons can be properly suppressed. Many investigations are currently underway to improve the rate performance of LFP by employing advanced novel nanotechnology. There has been a rapid progress in research and development of 1D nanostructures (nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes and nanobelts) for applications in key technological areas of energy conversion and storage such as in solar cells and LIBs. Debates could be on which one is better as a battery material between 1D structure and 0D nanoparticles even if both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. By a simple calculation, it can be shown that 1D structures have larger surface area compared with their equivalent three dimensional structures.45 At a fixed volume or mass, nanotubes are superior to nanosphere geometry in terms of surface area with a relation of:(Surface area ratio)3 = (S1/S0)3 ≈ (L1/D1) = Aspect ratiowhere subscript 1 and 0 indicates nanorods and nanospheres respectively. S = surface area, L = length and D = diameter. If the aspect ratio is less than unity, spherical nanoparticles have higher surface area compared with nanotubes (but, it is difficult to define the structure with (L1/D1) < 1 as rods). As the aspect ratio increases, the surface area ratio also augments: e.g. S1/S0 > 1.6 from L1/D1 = 10 and S1/S0 > 3.5 from L1/D1 = 100. The advantage of one-dimensionality becomes much clearer on passing from a rod to tube morphology. 1D tubular or hollow structures lead to the increase in effective electrolyte contact area, allowing double-sided electrolyte diffusion followed by better performances.
3. Why 1D structure of LFP? From the viewpoint of the lithiation/de-lithiation mechanism
Lithiation/delithiation of LFP has been widely known to follow a two phase mechanism since Padhi et al.46 reported that the material works as a cathode for LIBs. In the pioneering work to open the use of LFP, a two phase reaction based on transition between two end-members (LFP and FePO4) with an interface explained properly the composition-independent behavior of the voltage profile of LFP. A shrinking core model was suggested as a schematic picture to describe the two phase mechanism. Fig. 2a shows the delithiation process based on the model with an inward phase interface movement. The model can be regarded as a macroscopic model in a secondary particle level since it neglected the anisotropic nature of crystal structure of LFP. Some deviations followed like a mosaic model (Fig. 2b) where multipoint shrinking cores of FePO4 exist.47
 Fig. 2  Schematic models to describe delithiation of LFP. 
The early models of two phase systems were modified where partially delithiated LFP (LixFePO4 as an overall formula) is composed of two end-members (FePO4 and LFP). The constituent species of LixFePO4 were adjusted to two solid-solution phases close to the end-members (LiαFePO4 and Li1−βFePO4 where α, β ≈ 0).48–50 Also, narrow single solid-solution phases at the initial and final states of charge (x < α or x > 1−β, respectively) were expected. The idea comes from the concept of spinodal decomposition in binary liquid systems of a pair of partially miscible liquids.51 In the phase diagram (Fig. 3a), two curves (phase boundary and spinodal curve) divide three different regions. Beyond the phase boundary, two different liquids (or solids) are miscible to form a single phase while they are separated from each other below the spinodal curve. Between those two curves, a metastable region exists where a single phase is fairly stable but it can be decomposed to two phases with large fluctuation. At a certain temperature (or room temperature, T), an immiscible region called the miscibility gap is sandwiched with narrow miscible plus metastable regions at 0 < x < α and 1−β < x < 1.
 Fig. 3  Correlation between (a) spinodal-type phase diagram and (b) potential profile on discharge or lithiation of FePO4. 
The potential profile on discharge can be understood based on the phase diagram (Fig. 3b). A fully delithiated or charged end-member (FePO4, miscible) is transformed into a solid-solution phase (LiαFePO4, metastable) with a very small fraction α. This first solid-solution phase works as one of the constituent phases of LixFePO4 in a two phase region. As lithiation proceeds, the second solid-solution phase (Li1−βFePO4) develops from the outer surface while the core of the first one shrinks (miscibility gap). Finally, the second phase occupies the whole particles completely (metastable) and then transformed into the fully lithiated or discharged end-member (LFP, miscible). The existence of non-stoichiometric compositions defined by α and β is quite reasonable in terms that acceptor sites are required for charge (polaron, here) transport. Unless there are Fe2+ sites in Fe3+PO4 or Fe3+ sites in LiFe2+PO4, polaronic electrons and holes (localized in Fe3+ or Fe2+, respectively) cannot hop to the next sites with some tunneling probability coupled with the optical lattice vibration.49
At high temperatures beyond 200 °C, it was reported that mixtures of end-members transformed into a solid solution phase (LixFePO4, not as an overall formula, where x is determined by the temperature and composition of the original mixtures).52 The existence of a single solid solution phase at high temperature is also expected from the spinodal-based understanding (Fig. 3a). At a fixed composition x, the phase separation disappears to form a single phase with increasing temperature. Above upper consolute temperature (Tc), especially, single phases are obtained independent of the composition.
The biphased composition (LiαFePO4 and Li1−βFePO4) during delithiation (or lithiation) processes can be rationalized by the crystallographic structure of the constituent phases.53 Under the assumption that the crystallographic structures of LiαFePO4 and Li1−βFePO4 are similar to those of their corresponding end-members (FePO4 and LFP), difficulty in formation of solid-solution phases or mixed valence phases in the miscibility gap is explained by different dimensions of structure of the end-members. FePO4 and LFP are of the same olivine-type structure with each FeO6 octahedron sharing one edge with each PO4 tetrahedron. Depending on the charge of Fe in the octahedron, dimensions of bond lengths are changed including Fe–O and O–O in the FeO6 octahedron and even P–O in the PO4 tetrahedron. For example, the dimension of a corner-sharing O–O bond is estimated as 0.228 nm (LFP) versus 0.233 nm (FePO4). It means that the introduction of a significant amount of Fe2+ (Fe3+) into Fe3+PO4 (LiFe2+PO4) is not allowed or α and β cannot become significantly large in LiαFePO4 and Li1−βFePO4. As a result, the formation of a solid solution phase between LiαFePO4 and Li1−βFePO4 is not feasible in the miscibility gap.
When considering a peculiar olivine structure leading to anisotropic lithium deintercalation, the classical model of shrinking core schemes should be modified even if it still works in the case of secondary particles or polycrystallites. Olivine structure can be viewed as a stack of bc planes with the Pmna space group. The bc plane is a two-dimensional sheet of formula [FeO4]n, each unit of which comes from the corner-sharing FeO6 octahedron. The three-dimensional stack is built by PO4 tetrahedra that connect between the bc planes along the a direction. Polarons, developed as a form of Fe3+ in Li1−βFePO4 by delithiation, move easily from one FeO6 octahedron to the next over the [FeO4]n layer while lithium is deintercalated along the b direction. On the other hand, the a-direction route of polaronic movement is blocked because FeO6 octahedra are not directly connected but bridged by PO4 tetrahedra. Therefore, the anisotropic model was proposed, which can be applied to the level of primary particles or single crystallites (Fig. 2c).53–55 The feature of this model is summarized as follows. The following scenario to describe delithiation is based mainly on the domino-cascade model proposed by Delmas et al.,53 considering the spinodal-type behavior of delithiation. In the case of a single primary particle or crystallite with its dimension of the b direction small enough (e.g. less than 100 nm) during delithiation:
(1) Transformation to Li1−βFePO4: lithium is deintercalated through crystallographic tunnels along the b direction. If the spinodal type behavior of delithiation were feasible as explained above, very small amount of Li would be deintercalated through the b tunnels limitedly in the vicinity of the surface. Then, the lack of lithium affects the whole composition of the particle, converting LFP to Li1−βFePO4.
(2) Nucleation of LiαFePO4: the first delithiation from Li1−βFePO4 occurs at the point where the dimension of the b direction is smallest in a particle. Polarons are developed on the [FeO4]n layers in the vicinity of the lithium channel.
(3) Plane-wide spreading: polaronic movement over the [FeO4]n layers is easy and fast. The goodness of electronic conductivity of the [FeO4]n layer encourages delithiation through Li tunnels around the layer. As delithiation proceeds, the amount of polarons increases. That is to say, LFP is converted to LiαFePO4 over the whole area of the [FeO4]n layer, leading to the formation of the ‘LiαFePO4 block’ (or more approximately the ‘FePO4 block’53).
(4) Cascading to the next block: crystallographic mismatch between the pre-formed LiαFePO4 block and the lithiated framework (Li1−βFePO4) with strong distortion destabilizes or activates the adjacent [FeO4]n layer. As a result, additional nucleation is much more favored in the [FeO4]n layer adjacent to the LiαFePO4 block than in other layers of the same particle.
The step (3) to (4) is iterated so that phase boundary moves along the a direction.
Gibot et al. tried to answer the questions in the level of the primary particle or a single crystal particle: why do nano-scaled powders of LFP show good performances at high rates in spite of their poor conductivities? Is it only due to the shortened length of charge transfer pathways? Or does the nano-scaling affect the mechanism of lithiation/de-lithiation?56 By comparing potential profiles during charge and discharge between 40 nm and 140 nm particles of LFP (Fig. 4a) (and also supported by various techniques including in situ X-ray diffraction), they observed that the two-phase insertion process is converted to the single-phase mechanism with downsizing particles from 140 nm to 40 nm at least with proper composition and structure. The single-phase mechanism leads to a sloping plateau with changing redox potential caused by varying composition, while the characteristics of the two-phase reaction is the very flat region during lithiation and de-lithiation.

From the viewpoint of the lithiation/delithiation mechanism of LFP discussed above, one-dimensionality could be designed to achieve enhanced rate capabilities by considering which step is kinetically favoured. The descending order of kinetics is: spread-out of delithiation over the bc plane > growth of delithiation from the delithiated plane (or block) to the next lithiated one > nucleation of a new delithiated bc plane. As a result to consider the kinetic order, one-dimensionality along the c direction with keeping the a-directional dimension smallest is preferred for the reasons such as: (1) the nucleation (the slowest step) is not relevant to the length of the dimension but related to number of points; (2) the smaller dimension along the a direction reduces the time taken for plane-to-plane delithiation; (3) if a long axis should be chosen, it should be the c direction due to the fastest delithiation through the bc plane. It would be noteworthy that the crystallographic orientation of the 40 nm particles (Fig. 4b) surprisingly matches very well with our proposed model of kinetically ideal one-dimensionality.
Even if the advantage is expected from the one-dimensionality with consideration of the increasing surface area caused by its aspect ratio and the theoretically designed 1D dimensional structure, experimental results do not always support the expected merits. A study indicated that short rod structures of LFP performed better than longer rod structures (see Section 5, Fig. 10b).57 One of the reasons would be that the crystallographic orientation is not ideal as described above. The possible higher diffusion resistance of lithium ions in nanorods can be avoided by using nanotubes. For obtaining higher packing densities, composite electrodes consisting of nanotubes and nanoparticles can bring desirable outputs. More authentic studies are demanding in this area to assess especially lithium ion conductivity in ideally oriented 1D LFP when compared to nanoparticles.
4. 1D nanostructure of LFP
To improve conductivity and electrochemical performance, reducing the size of primary particles to nanoscale would be the primary option. Larger surface area and shorter path length for lithium ion diffusion and charge transfer lead to better rate capability. Hence, how to limit the dimension of LFP crystallites is one of the most important key issues. Even if various synthetic methods can be used for obtaining LFP, a high temperature process (usually based on solid state reactions) leading to the growth of crystallites is not favourable without physical templates.25,58,59 Even by mechanochemical activation (to transfer energy through a mechanical way and not by thermal heating) or microwave-assisted local heating, it is difficult to achieve LFP particles below 100 nm. Solution-based approaches such as sol–gel and hydro- or solvo-thermal methods proved to be effective for producing nanostructures of LFP.15 They offered advantages in terms of homogeneity in the dimension of particles, tuneable morphology and extendibility for scale-up. Plenty of works are being reported on the synthesis of nanostructured LFP. Discussing all works in this direction is out of the scope of this review. This section mainly discusses recent studies on fabrication and electrochemical performance of 1D nanostructured LFP.
Soft chemistry
Wang et al. reported a hydrothermal synthesis of LFP nanowires (a few hundred nm in diameter, a few tens of μm in length, aspect ratio = ∼100, Fig. 5a) with nitriloacetic acid as a surfactant.60 The precursor solution of FeSO4·7H2O, NH4H2PO4 and LiOH was controlled at pH 9 followed by a hydrothermal process at 180 to 220 °C for 20 h. The initial discharge capacity was estimated as 150 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, decreasing to 138 mA h g−1 after experiencing 60 charge/discharge cycles. When considering that the nanowires were not carbon-coated, the initial capacity and cyclability of the nanowire-based cells can be said to be fairly good. The authors provided an abstract and unclear explanation about the reason for the improved performances even without carbon coating, attributing it to a short path length of lithium diffusion provided by 1D nanowires (probably, in a radial direction). Even if they did not investigate the nanowires in detail by transmission electron microscopy, the nanowires of such a high aspect ratio would have a highly accessible de-intercalation or intercalation pathway from the viewpoint of lithium ions. This would be the advantage expected probably from high surface area caused by their aspect ratio and/or from their theoretically designed crystallographic orientation of one-dimensionality as mentioned above.

As an interesting work, Liu et al. synthesized LFP nanorods (10 nm in diameter, 50 nm in length, aspect ratio = ∼5, Fig. 5b) by using pre-synthesized FePO4 nanorods as the starting material.61 As the first step, FePO4 nanorods were prepared by heating (at 600 °C for 6 h) the precipitate obtained from the mixture of NH4H2PO4 and FeCl3. Then, FePO4 nanorods were mixed with LiOH and polyethylene glycol (PEG), followed by thermal treatment at 700 °C under flowing nitrogen. The initial discharge capacities were surprisingly high even at very fast discharges: 150 mA h g−1 at 5 C, 140 mA h g−1 at 10 C and 90 mA h g−1 at 50 C. Microscopic explanation about the merits of the nanorods was not given in this work even if crystallographic alignment should be studied.

Nanorods and nanoflower-like structures of LFP were fabricated by a one-pot solvothermal synthesis at 300 to 400 °C without high temperature post-annealing.62 High aspect-ratio nanorods (as a representative geometry, 100 nm in diameter, more than 700 nm in length, aspect ratio = 7, upper photo in Fig. 5c) were obtained in ethylene glycol with hexane as a co-solvent while flower-like microstructure (100 nm in diameter, <500 nm in length, aspect ratio < 5, lower photo in Fig. 5c) evolved in the presence of oleic acid in the same solvent. Ethylene glycol directed the growth of particles in an anisotropic way through forming hydrogen bonds. Adsorption of oleic acids on the surface of growing particles limited the length of nanorods that are self-assembled into the flower-like structure after pro-longed reaction time (10 to 15 minutes). The capacity of flower-like microstructured LFP was estimated as 154 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C to 0.5 C (charge rate = discharge rate) and 120 mA h g−1 at 1 C.
Hwang et al. reported a reverse micelle process to synthesize rod-like secondary particles of LFP (500 nm to 1 μm in diameter, several μm in length, aspect ratio > 5, Fig. 5d) consisting of primary nanoparticles (∼100 nm in diameter).63Water droplets were stabilized in a continuous oil phase (kerosene) by using Tween-80 as a non-ionic surfactant, acting as nanoreactors for formation of nanoparticles and limiting their size. The shape of primary particles was spherical or quadrate or polyhedral. After heating the suspension at 650 °C for 20 h, the primary particles are sintered together to form the shape of rods. The capacity was reported to be 120 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 100 mA h g−1 at 5 C with sustainable cyclability at least up to 100 cycles.
In addition to practical thermal heating, microwave-assisted heating is attractive from the view point that LFP can be synthesized at low temperature for a short time period. Muraliganth et al. reported an example of the microwave-assisted solvothermal process.64 The most appealing point of their work is that highly crystalline pure phase LFP with controllable particle size can be synthesized within a short time without formation of amorphous and impurity phases. A homogeneous reddish-brown gel prepared by mixing LiOH, Fe(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 in the presence of tetraethyleneglycol was heated in an autoclave uniformly by microwave. The temperature was ramped to 300 °C then the microwave irradiation was controlled to keep the temperature for only 5 minutes. The dimension of nanorods in precipitates was controlled by changing the concentration of reactants at a fixed molar ratio (Li:Fe:P = 1:1:1): long nanorods (40 nm in diameter and up to 1 μm in length, aspect ratio = ∼25, left in Fig. 5e) at 0.3 M each and short ones (25 nm in diameter and up to 100 nm in length, aspect ratio = ∼4, right in Fig 5e) at 0.15 M each. Even if both long and short nanorods did not show very high energy densities at various discharge rates, the performance was significantly enhanced with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The nanocomposites of LFP nanorods with MWCNTs are discussed more in the following section of nanocomposites (Fig. 5f).
Murugan et al. compared between solvothermal and hydrothermal syntheses by using microwave heating.65 A much smaller dimension of nanorods was obtained through the solvothermal process: 25 nm width and up to 100 nm length for solvothermal versus 225 nm width and up to 300 nm length for hydrothermal. The microwave-assisted thermal condition was very similar to that of the work described just above.64 In Muraliganth et al's work, a MWCNT was used as the conductivity enhancer without any additional high-temperature annealing process to keep the advantage of low-temperature synthesis by a microwave-assisted thermal process. In Murugan et al.'s work, however, a carbon coating layer on LFP nanorods was obtained by firing the active materials with sucrose at high temperature (700 °C). Even if the high temperature was used at last, the time period of thermal treatment (1 h) was shorter than that of conventional methods (at least several hours). The capacity of LFP prepared by the solvothermal process was superior to that of the hydrothermal one with the gap of 15 mA h g−1 for discharge rates from 0.1 C to 10 C: for example, 160 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and 105 mA h g−1 at 10 C for the solvothermal versus 145 mA h g−1 and 92 mA h g−1 at the same rates for the hydrothermal. When considering minimum dimension of particles, the nanorods prepared by the hydrothermal process showed pretty high values of capacities especially at high discharge rates. The reason would be the goodness of carbon coating on each primary particle. In the aqueous solution-based hydrothermal process, carbon precursors soluble in water (glucose or sucrose) can be in situ coated on particles during the microwave-assisted synthesis. On the other hand, the nanorods prepared from the non-aqueous solvent should be ex situ coated. If a carbon precursor that is soluble in the organic solvent was properly chosen, more enhanced rate capability would be obtained by using the solvothermal LFP.
Hard template
Template-assisted synthesis is one of the most effective and popular methods for the synthesis of 1D nanostructures. The majorly employed hard templates include porous silica, anodized aluminium oxide (AAO) and polymer based templates.66 Only few reported information is available on template-synthesized 1D LFP nanostructures.
Lim et al. synthesized LFP nanowires using silica templates (Fig. 6a).67 A transparent precursor solution of Fe(NO3)3, LiC2H3O2 and H3PO4 dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol was incorporated into hexagonal SBA-15 silica powder using a wetness impregnation technique; followed by oven drying at 120 °C and annealing at 300 °C. After template removal in 1 M NaOH solution, the collected powders were subjected to a heat treatment at 700 °C. In addition to the 1D wire structures, hollow nanostructures (Fig. 6b) were also fabricated (using KIT-6 silica). The first discharge capacity in the nanowire sample was 157 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and 137 mA h g−1 at 15 C with a capacity retention of 89% (Fig. 7a). There was no capacity fading at least up to 80 cycles at 1 C. A relatively high loading level of 30 mg cm−2 was used to investigate the rate capability at higher C rates. The hollow sample shows 95% capacity retention with higher discharge capacity values (165 mA h g−1 and 153 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and 15 C, Fig. 7b), due to the enhanced electrolyte contact area (Fig. 6b). Though the nanowire structure performance was inferior to hollow structures, the performance of such 1D structures can be enhanced by nanocompositing with 1D carbon nanostructures (see Section 4). Also the nanowires in the study were not perfect rod structures and were composed of connected agglomerated nanoparticles in a single direction.

Sides et al. prepared LFP nanofibers (Fig. 6c) and their nanocomposites with carbon using polycarbonate filters.68 To prepare the composites, the impregnated template (in the precursor solution) which was attached to a Pt current collector was dried at 80 °C and heated in a reducing atmosphere at 650 °C. The nanocomposite electrode delivered almost 100% of the theoretical discharge capacity (165 mA h g−1) up to 3 C and 36% of its theoretical capacity at 65 C. To enhance the lithium ion diffusion, templates with 50 nm nominal diameters were used for electrochemical studies. Similar to Lim et al.,67 Doherty et al. prepared porous LFP electrode materials having pores in the mesopore (2–50 nm), meso-/macropore (20–80 nm), or macropore (50–120 nm) size range via a solution-based templating technique. Beads of poly(methyl methacrylate) colloidal crystals were employed as templates which provided a firm scaffolding to form the nanostructures.69 The size of the beads correlates with the void or pore size in the final structure. Among the prepared samples, the high surface area materials with macropores in the 50–120 nm range allowed good electrolyte access to the LFP and enhanced electrochemical properties (160 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and 115 mA h g−1 at 5 C).
Only two reported information are available on fabrication of LFP nanostructures with AAO templates.70,71AAO is particularly attractive for making very regular and highly anisotropic nanostructures. Usually a two step anodization is employed to produce the template.72 The pores size can be easily controlled to a desired dimension by varying the anodization voltage and time. Another advantage is the high temperature stability of the templates. Liu et al. reported a sol–gel based synthesis of polycrystalline LFP nanotubes (Fig. 6d) employing AAO.70 The templates were dipped into a sol obtained from the precursor chemicals, taken out, vacuum-dried and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. In a more recent work, Teng et al. reported an in situ hydrothermal growth of LFP nanorods using AAO templates.71 They immersed the templates into the precursor solution and subjected it to a hydrothermal reaction (160 °C for 12 h). Samples recovered after AAO dissolution in NaOH demonstrated nanorod arrays (Fig. 6e). However, both works have not evaluated their electrochemical performance in a cell even if they synthesized 1D LFP by AAO.
The lack of advanced studies with AAO might be associated with practical difficulties associated with the AAO-based synthesis. One main problem is the difficulty in making homogeneous and precipitate-free precursor solution that is to be filled in AAO pores. The expected room temperature precipitation (precipitation of Fe3PO4 and/or Li3PO4) in the precursor solution can be avoided by keeping the solution pH in an acidic region (the precipitation usually starts when the pH exceeds 3). However, the AAO stability in acidic pH (below 4) is not good, especially under high temperature conditions. AAO is not stable in alkaline pH (beyond 9), either. Also, converting a clear precursor solution (in acidic pH) effectively into gel inside AAO pores is difficult. In this context (as an ongoing work), we synthesized three-dimensionally interconnected frames of LFP consisting of nanotube-type branches (Fig. 6f) by controlling pH of precursor solution sophisticatedly with an AAO template. The precursor solution kept at pH 3 was introduced into the template. Then, precipitation within pores of the template was induced by adjusting pH to around 8.

Electrospinning


Electrospinning is a simple and inexpensive method for fabricating nanofibres. Some recent reports are available on LFP nanowires fabricated by this method. Hosono et al. reported tri-axial LFP nanowires (500–1000 nm thick) with MWCNT core columns in the presence or absence of an outer shell of amorphous carbon.73 Even though both the samples with and without the amorphous carbon coating showed a similar capacity (160, 130 and 80 mA h g−1 at 0.06, 0.6 and 6 C), the former exhibited improved cycle performance without any degradation in capacity. Zhu et al. electro-spun in situpolymer-coated single crystalline LFP nanowires of smaller diameter (∼100 nm) by using an aqueous precursor mixture containing LiH2PO4, Fe(NO3)3 and poly(ethylene oxide).74Decomposition of the polymer on heating the as-prepared nanowires (at 600 °C for 2 h in a H2 + Ar atmosphere) leads to the formation of carbon coating. Cells based on the 1D material delivered high discharge capacities including the theoretical value at a low discharge rate: 169, 150 and 93 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 1 and 10 C.
5. Nanocomposites with 1D carbon-based materials
Even though reducing particle size enhanced the lithium ion diffusion, LFP nanostructures were found to have still suffered from poor electronic conductivity. The most popular solution to overcome the shortcoming is to coat and/or composite LFP with carbons. Carbonaceous materials provide good pathways for electron and heat transfer. By introducing conductive carbon materials, the electronic conductivity was enhanced significantly from 10−8 S cm−1 to 10−5–10−1 S cm−1 (Fig. 8). The improved electronic conductivity leads to enhanced cell performances. Plenty of works are reported in this direction. For example, Liu and Cao synthesized carbon-coated LFP or C-LFP nanoparticles by using an ultrasonic-assisted co-precipitation method.75 The particle size was about 50 nm with a 4 to 6 nm thick surface carbon layer. The carbon coating enhanced discharge capacities (159 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and 135 mA h g−1 at 2 C) as well as cyclability. Since the carbon coating is too well-known wisdom and also this article concerns one-dimensionality, this section is devoted mainly to describing nanocomposites of LFP with 1D carbons.

Composites with carbon nanotubes and nanofibers
Distinguished from carbon blacks popularly used as conductive agents in LIBs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) feature their tubular shape and small surface area with high electronic conductivity. Due to their merits, CNTs have been widely used in areas such as field emission and energy storage. Chen and Whittingham have showed that adding multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) to LFP enhanced the electronic conductivity considerably.80 MWCNTs offer more facile electronic transport channels in the resulting composites and have remarkable thermal and mechanical stabilities.81 MWCNTs make strong webs with LFP particles, enabling the structure of the composite cathode material to be stable during the charge/discharge cycling.82

LFP/MWCNT composites were prepared by mixing LFP and MWCNTs in alcohol at 60 °C until all the liquid has evaporated; followed by vacuum drying at 120 °C and sintering at 500 °C under argon flow (Fig. 9a).57 Discharge capacity and cycle stability of the composite electrode were improved by increasing MWCNTs up to 7 wt% (Fig. 10a). After that amount, the enhancement of cyclability was saturated or even a little bit deteriorated. The composite with 7 wt% MWCNTs showed capacity retention at 97.77% after 100 cycles with an initial discharge capacity of 152.7 mA h g−1 at 0.18 C (versus 141.4 mA h g−1 for pure LFP). The electronic conductivity of the composite (10−3 S cm−1) was estimated to be about a factor of six orders higher than that of pure LFP. Impedance spectroscopy suggested that the composite electrode exhibited smaller charge transfer resistance and larger double layer capacitance values indicative of the faster electrochemical kinetics and greater lithium ion diffusion capability, respectively.

Jin et al. reported that the electronic conductivity of the LFP/MWCNTs (5 wt%) composite was improved by eight orders of magnitude higher than that of pure LFP (from 5.86 × 10−9 S cm−1 for pure LFP to 1.08 × 10−1 S cm−1 for the composite).79 They have demonstrated that added MWCNTs not only increased the electronic conductivity and lithium ion diffusion coefficient but also decreased the crystallite size of the composite. MWCNTs were added into a solution of hydrothermally synthesized LFP and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; the mixture was ball-milled and dried at 90 °C for 12 h; pelletized and heated at 500 °C for 1 h in an inert atmosphere. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that the MWCNTs intertwine with LFP particles together to form a three-dimensional network (Fig. 9b). The LFP–MWCNTs composite displays more stable discharge capacity retention (115 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles) than pure LFP (99 mA h g−1 after 7 cycles) with a solid polymer electrolyte employed. In other literature, a LFP (prepared by solid state reaction)–MWCNTs (5 wt%) composite cathode displayed an initial discharge capacity of 155 mA h g−1 with 95% cycle efficiency at 0.1 C.84 The composite electrode discharged at 146 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 122 mA h g−1 at 5 C.

          Carbon coating based on carbon-containing precursors requires thermal processing at higher temperatures (>600 °C) in reducing atmospheres, causing significant particle growth of LFP. Also, a thick carbon coating may block lithium ion diffusion at high charge/discharge rates. In these aspects nanocomposites of LFP with 1D carbon structures prepared at ambient temperature would be significantly useful. Muraliganth et al. prepared the composite of LFP nanorods (by a microwave-solvothermal process at ambient temperature) with 8 wt% MWCNTs (in toluene) by stirring for a few minutes, followed by drying in a vacuum oven to evaporate the solvents.64 MWCNTs connected the LFP nanorods in close proximity (Fig. 9c), providing highly conductive channels for the mobility of electrons during a lithiation/delithiation process. The composite electrode showed an initial discharge capacity of 161 mA h g−1 with a significant reduction in the polarization loss, whereas the pristine LFP showed an initial discharge capacity of 146 mA h g−1 with some polarization loss. The nanocomposites exhibited excellent capacity retention during cycling due to good contact between particles as well as between particles and a current collector. Their studies on composite electrodes with shorter and longer LFP nanorods showed that shorter rods exhibited higher discharge capacity (130 mA h g−1 at 10 C) than longer rods (90 mA h g−1) due to a faster lithium ion diffusion arising from a shorter diffusion length (Fig. 10b). The performance of the synthesized electrodes was comparable to the values reported for most of the modified high power LFP cathodes prepared under rigorous reaction conditions at high temperatures with longer reaction time.85 Wang et al. prepared LFP–MWCNT composites by combining a room temperature solid state method and microwave heating. The electrochemical capacity of the optimized composite was found to be 145 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C with stable cycling performance.86 In this work, the precursor solution along with citric acid as a carbon source and MWCNTs as conductive additives was mixed in a mortar and subsequently subjected to microwave irradiation.
Bhuvaneswari et al. used carbon nanofibers (CNFs) for preparing composites.83 Functionalized CNFs (by treating with conc. HNO3 at 70 °C for 24 h) were added during the sol–gel synthesis of LFP. The precursor solution has been stirred for one week in order to get better contact of LFP particles with CNFs. The gel has been thermally treated at 600 °C in an argon atmosphere for 12 h. Scanning electron micrograms of the composite (Fig. 9d) indicated non-homogeneous coating of LFP particles over CNFs. The composite with 10 wt% CNFs delivers a higher specific capacity (∼140 mA h g−1) than LFP with 25 wt% carbon black (added after synthesis) (∼120 mA h g−1) at 0.1 C. It has been recently suggested that small addition of CNTs greatly enhanced properties of less costly carbon fibers and foams. Efforts are going on to improve LFP loading and density in the composite to produce dense structure with good particle morphology and small size and sharp particle distribution.87
Conducting-polymer-based coating and composites
Conducting polymers have been used for surface-coating as well as compositing. For example, polyaniline (PAni) is conductive with a lithium storage capability. Hence, coating PAni on LFP particles would increase capacities due to enhanced electronic conductivity and additional capacity. Lei et al. prepared a series of PAni-coated LFP by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization.88 In a typical synthesis, an FeCl3 oxidant was added to a mixture of aniline monomer with sodium dedecylbenzenesulfonate and LFP. The polymerization was achieved after stirring for 6 h. The resultant PAni-coated LFP was filtered and vacuum-dried at 60 °C. Morphological studies on the composite suggested that the crystals of LFP were coated by PAni with a cotton-like fiber structure, forming a conductive network between LFP particles. The PAni coating significantly decreased the charge-transfer resistance of the composite electrodes as evidenced by Nyquist plots. The discharge capacity as well as the cycling stability of a composite electrode with 25 wt% PAni was significantly improved compared to the pure LFP electrode: 140.3 mA h g−1 (the composite) versus 117.2 (pure LFP) at 0.1 C after 10 cycles; 118.7 mA h g−1 (the composite) versus 87.6 (pure LFP) at 1 C after 50 cycles.
Another candidate which can be used both as a conductive agent as well as a polymeric cathode material is polypyrrole (PPy) (theoretical capacity of PPy is 72 mA h g−1). Blending PPy with an insulating polymer such as PEG is attractive as it improves the mechanical properties of electrodes without diminishing electronic conductivity.89 Fedorkova et al. introduced PEG into the PPy film coated on LFP powder particles.90 PEG was added into the polymerization medium containing LFP, pyrrole monomer and FeCl3. The mixture was kept at −4 °C for 6 h. As the polymerization of pyrrole takes place in solution, clusters of pure PPy were formed between LFP particles. The introduction of PEG also improved the electrochemical performance. The discharge capacities for pure LFP, PPy–LFP and PPy/PEG–LFP were 138, 146 and 148 mA h g−1, respectively (at 0.2 C); with good cycling stability for the composite electrode at least after 50 cycles.
Huang and Goodenough improved the electrochemical performance of carbon-coated LFP (C-LFP) by substituting deadweight (such as carbon black and/or binder) by PPy or PAni.91 To obtain conducting polymers, electrochemical as well as chemical polymerization was used to prepare the C-LFP/polymer composite cathodes. The performance of the electrochemically deposited polymer composite electrode (X-ED in Fig. 11a) was found to be better than that of the chemically prepared composites (X-Chem). It should be noted that the % polymer content in the electrodeposited composite sample was higher than that of the chemically polymerized sample. In addition to the increase in electrical conductivity, PPy and PAni serve as hosts for 1ithium ion intercalation and extraction and provide good electronic contact between the particles and the current collector.

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is an attractive conducting polymer due to its high environmental stability, superior thermal stability, redox behaviour over a wide range of potentials, and high electronic conductivity in its doped state compared to PAni or PPy.93LFP nanorods synthesized by a rapid microwave-solvothermal approach have been encapsulated within p-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA) doped PEDOT.92 The organic–inorganic nanohybrid offers discharge capacity (166 mA h g−1) close to the theoretical value with excellent capacity retention (Fig. 11b). This remarkable electrochemical performance was attributed to the mixed electronic–ionic conductivity of the p-TSA doped PEDOT.94
6. Summary and conclusions
Nanotechnology enables us to control the size, shape and hopefully the crystallographic orientation of particles on a nanoscale. Application of this technology to electrode materials allows lithium ion batteries to stride across technical hurdles with longer steps in terms of performances. Among various nano-shapes, 1D structures such as nanowires and nanotubes have their own advantages when compared with isotropic nanoparticles: (1) larger surface area is caused by high aspect ratio and (2) crystallographic orientation can be designed (if it is needed and is possible) in a way to allocate kinetically unfavourable crystallographic orientation in the direction of the smallest dimension (radial) with more mass in a single particle (extendable in the z axis along length). Even if the second advantage has not been completely investigated and achieved, various works devoted on the synthesis of 1D LFP have shown enhanced performances in terms of energy and power densities and cyclability. Nanoplates95,96 and porous structures67,97,98 have been proposed as other alternative efficient structures, delivering good performances. Nanoplate LFP could be designed in a crystallographic manner (satisfying the second point), however, with smaller surface area in principle compared with 1D structure. Porous LFPs satisfy the first point while high packing density is difficult to obtain. Even if we emphasized the merits of 1D structure here, it would not be true to say that the best performances can be obtained only from 1D structure. The reason is that very complicated factors affect cell performances. Our description should be understood in terms of possibility of 1D structure.
In addition to 1D structure of LFP itself, introduction of 1D conductive material such as carbon nanotubes, nanofibers and conducting polymers for compositing with LFP shows the same positive effects by enhancing the electronic conductivity. We believe that the future direction of the synthesis of LFP or other electrode materials should be the studies on how to control crystallographic orientation in a particle with an optimized shape.
