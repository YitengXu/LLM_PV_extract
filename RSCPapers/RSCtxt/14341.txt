    , Accepted 9th January 2015First published on 12th January 2015Abstract4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Hoechst 33342 (H33342) were used as novel energy relay dyes (ERDs) for an efficient energy transfer to the N719 dye in I−/I3− based liquid-junction dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The introduction of the ERDs, either as an additive in the electrolyte or as a co-adsorbent, greatly enhanced the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), mainly because of an increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc). This was attributed to the effects of non-radiative Förster-type excitation energy transfer as well as the radiative (emission)-type fluorescent energy transfer to the sensitizers. The net PCEs for the N719-sensitized DSSCs with DAPI and H33342 were 10.65% and 10.57%, and showed an improvement of 12.2% and 11.4% over control devices, respectively.
1. Introduction
The photoelectrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is principally composed of a mesoporous TiO2 film covered by a monolayer of light-harvesting dyes.1,2 DSSCs based on an I−/I3− redox mediator with conventional Ru-containing dyes have reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12%.3 However, for commercialization, DSSCs must absorb ∼ 80% of the solar spectrum (from 350 to 900 nm) and have a PCE value of 15%. Various strategies have been developed to achieve higher efficiency light harvesting by testing novel dyes, co-sensitizers, and photoelectrode structures as well as the device itself for effective charge transport and collection.4–9
It was recently reported that the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) could be an effective strategy to increase the light harvesting of dyes via the non-radiative transfer of the excited energies from a donor molecule, an energy relay dye (ERD), to an acceptor dye within a short distance range.10–15 Ideally, higher energy photons absorbed by the donor are efficiently transferred to the acceptor either via a non-radiative FRET or by radiative emission (radiative energy transfer, RET).10 To achieve this, ERDs must be strongly fluorescent and their emission must effectively overlap with the absorption spectra of the acceptor molecules. Several ERDs, such as N,N′-di(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1,6,7,12-tetra(4-tert-butyl phenoxy)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II)chloride (N877), 4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-p-dimethylamino-styryl-4H-pyran (DCM), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]tdiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl) 9,9′ spirobifluorene (Spiro-TBT), Rhodamine B (RB), (E)-2-(2-tert-butyl-6-(4-(diethylamino)styryl)-4H-pyran-4-ylidene)malononitrile (BL302), and (E)-2-(2-(2-(5-(4-(bis(2-ethoxyethyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)-6-tert-butyl-4H-pyran-4-ylidene)malononitrile (BL315) have been used successfully to enhance the PCE via FRET for both Spiro-OMETAD based solid-state DSSCs and I−/I3−-based liquid-type DSSCs; these were sensitized with squaraine (SQ-1) and zinc-phthalocyanine (TT1), which also functioned as acceptor dyes.16–21 These ERDs were incorporated into the DSSCs by either directly mixing with redox mediators11,19,29 or blending with the hole-transfer medium (such as Spiro-OMETAD)17,18 as part of the electrolytes, while they were also introduced as a co-adsorbent along with the sensitizing dyes into the photoelectrode.20 Although these ERDs were reported to significantly enhance the overall PCEs in a majority of previous studies, the ERDs were combined with dyes with less effective sensitizing capability, such as SQ-1 and TT1-based dyes, which essentially limited the actual PCEs. For example, the highest cell efficiencies reported for N877 and BL315 with SQ-1 and TT1-based dyes were only 1.80% and 4.14%, respectively.17,21 The co-sensitization of TiO2 photoelectrodes by the co-adsorption of two or more molecular sensitizers is another effective strategy to increase the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs over a wide spectral range.22–27 Consequently, various co-sensitizing system-based DSSCs have been developed and the improved PCEs has been attributed to the increased light harvesting efficiency.28–33 To enhance light harvesting over a wide wavelength range by both FRET and RET (Fig. 1(A)), it is necessary to find commercially available and relatively inexpensive ERDs suitable for the well-known high-efficiency sensitizers, such as cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719) and cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) (N3). Alkyl-functionalized aminonaphthalimide (carboxy-fluourol, CF) and zinc 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (ZnPC-TTB) dyes have recently been used as ERDs for N719 and three different Ru(II) polypyridine complexes (N719, ruthenizer 620-1H3TBA (black dye) and cis-dicyano-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) ruthenium(II) (Ru505)), respectively;34,35 however, they showed only limited net enhancement of the quantum efficiency over a narrow spectral range. This paper reports novel ERDs, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Hoechst 33342 (H33342), that ensure significant enhancement of the net PCEs for sensitizers, such as N719, N3, Ru505, and cis-diisothiocyanato-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dinonyl) ruthenium(II) (Z907). The contribution of these ERDs to the enhancement of the overall cell efficiency is discussed in terms of the variation of their energy band position, fluorescence quantum yield (Qd) and Förster radius (R0) with respect to N719. Finally, fluorescence quenching of the ERDs induced by N719 and enhancement of the net optical absorption of N719 confirmed the critical role played by the studied ERDs.

2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(B) shows the chemical structures of DAPI and H33342, which are well-known compounds and are often used as DNA-staining agents for fluorescence microscopy; in addition, they can absorb high-energy photons.36,37 The significant overlap of the emission spectra of the ERDs with the absorption spectra of N719 (Fig. 1(C)) as well as the high extinction coefficient (ε) of the ERDs (Table 1) strongly suggest their ability to increase the light harvesting of N719 via non-radiative energy transfer. Furthermore, the intense visible emissions (400–600 nm) of these ERDs indicate the possibility of enhancing the light harvesting of N719 in the visible range via RET. This is consistent with the relatively high Qd values calculated for ERDs. Such high values may be the result of a favorable R010 between the ERDs and N719 (Table 1, Fig. S1; and see the ESI† for further details on these calculations).

These ERDs were incorporated into the DSSCs in two different ways: (i) they were simply mixed with the electrolyte as an additive (Type-A cell, designated as ERD|N719/TiO2, ERD = DAPI or H33342), and (ii) they were post-adsorbed as a co-adsorbent onto the N719-loaded TiO2 (N719/TiO2) surface (Type-B cell, designated as ERD-N719/TiO2, ERD = DAPI or H33342)). For Type-A cells, 5 mM of ERD was chosen as the optimal additive concentration (Fig. S2†). When loaded as a co-adsorbent onto the N719/TiO2 system, ERDs in ethanolic solutions (1 mM) were used. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of both systems under optimized condition are summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 2 along with those of the conventional cells sensitized by N719 only. The net PCEs for DAPI|N719/TiO2 and H33342|N719/TiO2 were found to be 10.65% and 10.57%, respectively. In addition, the PCEs for DAPI-N719/TiO2 and H33342-N719/TiO2 were determined to be 10.49% and 10.47%, respectively, under the fully optimized conditions with a nanocrystalline transparent TiO2 (20 nm) film (thicknesses of ca. 6 μm) and a 4 μm thick TiO2 (500 nm) scattering layer. The net PCE enhancement compared to the PCEs of the cells sensitized with N719 only was 12.2% and 11.4% for DAPI and H33342, respectively, for Type-A cells (DAPI|N719/TiO2 and H33342|N719/TiO2); for Type-B cells (DAPI-N719/TiO2 and H33342-N719/TiO2), these values were determined to be 10.54% and 10.33%, respectively. We expect that these ERDs can also be used for cells with other high-efficiency sensitizers, such as N3, Ru505 and Z907, because their absorption profiles are similar to that of N719. Indeed, the significant spectral overlap of the absorption of these sensitizers with the emission profiles of DAPI and H33342 led to PCE enhancement in Type-A cells (Fig. S3† and Table 2). In this case, the relative PCE enhancement obtained with DAPI and H33342 was 10.4% and 12.5% for N3, 14.0% and 10.9% for Ru505, and 9.3% and 7.0% for Z907, respectively.

The J–V and incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) characteristics of the cells with DAPI/TiO2 and H33342/TiO2, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(B1-2) and Table 2 (PCEs = 0.08% and 0.04% for DAPI/TiO2 and H33342/TiO2, respectively), suggest that the contribution of direct sensitization by DAPI and H33342 is negligible. The low PCE values of DAPI/TiO2 and H33342/TiO2 were attributed to the low Jsc values, which may result from inefficient electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 (CBTiO2) from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of both ERDs. This is too positive to interact with CBTiO2 for successful electron transfer (Fig. 3B and Table 1).39 The HOMO level and the band gap (vs. vacuum) of the ERDs and N719 were calculated from their oxidation potential (vs. Ag/Ag+) obtained from cyclic voltammograms (CVs) (Fig. 3A) and absorption onsets (Fig. 1B), respectively. These values were then used to calculate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the individual materials.

The cell performance enhancement induced by the ERDs can be attributed mostly to an increase in the Jsc values, i.e., up to 7.96% and 6.21% for DAPI|N719/TiO2 and H33342|N719/TiO2 (Type-A), and 7.63% and 8.34% for DAPI-N719/TiO2 and H33342-N719/TiO2 (Type-B), respectively. These findings are consistent with the IPCE enhancement observed over the entire wavelength range upon the addition of the ERDs carried out according to both strategies (Fig. 2(A2–B2)). The IPCE in the UV region (ca. 340–400 nm) and over a wide visible range (ca. 400–760 nm) was attributed to non-radiative FRET to N719 occurring around the ERD absorption maxima (λmax, abs = 348 and 340 nm for DAPI and H33342, respectively) and fluorescent emission-based RET around the ERD emission maxima (λmax, em = 457 and 460 nm for DAPI and H33342, respectively).
The FRET interaction between the ERDs and N719 was confirmed by the significant quenching of the emission spectra observed for both ERDs as a function of the N719 concentration (0.2–3 μM) (Fig. 4(A and B)). This was achieved using a similar procedure to that employed in previous studies regarding the DCM/SQ-1 and Spiro-TBT/TT1 pairs.18,20 Furthermore, the data displayed in Fig. 4(C-a) and 4(D-a) show that the amount of light absorption by N719 increases upon incorporation of the ERDs. The significant increase in the net absorption (ΔOD) and effective absorption coefficient (Δα/α) of N719 in the presence of the ERDs over the entire absorption range indicates that non-radiative and radiative energy transfer contributed simultaneously to the overall light harvesting of N719 (Fig. 4C(b, c) and 4D(b, c), which is in agreement with the previous increase in IPCE discussed above. The values of ΔOD and Δα/α showed a maximum at ∼ ca. 310 nm, which is close to λmax, abs of both ERDs. This can be attributed to the FRET interaction between N719 and the ERDs. The increase in ΔOD and Δα/α in the emission maximum region (λmax, em) of the ERDs may be ascribed to the contribution of the increased light intensity due to the fluorescent emission of the ERDs.

(C, D): (a) Enhancement of light absorption of N719 in the presence of the ERDs in the MPN solution (the concentrations of DAPI, H33342, and N719 are 10, 20, and 8 μM, respectively); (b) the net absorption change (ΔOD) of N719 and (c) relative changes of the effective absorption coefficient (Δα/α) were measured according to a published procedure.44 
Although lower than that of Jsc, an increase in the open-circuit potential (Voc) was also observed upon the introduction of the ERDs. No clear trend in the variation of the fill factor (FF) was observed for N719-based cells. In particular, Voc increased up to ca. 28 and 23 mV for DAPI|N719/TiO2 and H33342|N719/TiO2 (Type-A), and to ca. 26 and 10 mV for DAPI-N719/TiO2 and H33342-N719/TiO2 (Type-B), respectively. This trend was attributed to the positive shift of the Fermi level of TiO2 (EF, TiO2) because of the basic nature of both ERDs,40,41 as observed in previous studies on the relationship between Voc and the concentration of basic tert-butylpyridine (tBP).42 The Voc trend observed in this study is also consistent with the recombination rate (kT/E) at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, which was measured from the Bode plot under the open-circuit and dark conditions for the Type-A cells with respect to that of N719/TiO2 (Fig. 5, Table 2).

3. Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated that both DAPI and H33342 can be used in combination with most of the high efficiency sensitizers to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. These ERDs were successfully incorporated into the cells, either as a part of the electrolyte or as a co-adsorbent along with the main sensitizer. The net enhancement of the PCE was determined to be ca. 12.2% and 11.4% for DAPI and H33342, respectively, with the cells sensitized by N719 under optimum conditions. The increase in Jsc was mostly caused by FRET and fluorescent emission-based RET to the sensitizers. In addition, the slight increase in Voc was induced by a positive shift of EF, TiO2 favored by the basic properties of the ERDs. The application of these materials is expected to be most effective for non-liquid DSSCs and flexible cells that require low-temperature sintering. Further studies are needed to prove this important point.

 	Fig. 1  (A) Schematic representation of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and radiative energy transfer (RET) from the ERDs to the sensitizing dye, with the ERDs either being (a) mixed with the electrolyte (Type-A) or (b) co-adsorbed with the dye onto TiO2 (Type-B). Higher-energy photons absorbed by the ERDs are transferred to the sensitizing dyes either by a direct non-radiative FRET or a radiative emission of lower-energy photons. (B) Chemical structure of DAPI and H33342. (C) Normalized absorption (solid line) and emission (dashed line) profile of (a) DAPI and (b) H33342, together with the absorption profile of N719.

 	Fig. 2  Current density–voltage (J–V) plots of DSSCs with the ERDs (A1) added into the I−/I3− based electrolyte and (B1) co-adsorbed onto the N719-loaded TiO2 surface along with the purely N719-sensitized DSSCs. The corresponding incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are displayed in A2 and B2. The insets in B1 and B2 show the J–V and IPCE characteristics of the cells sensitized by the ERDs only.
