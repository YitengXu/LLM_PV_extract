    , Accepted 3rd January 2023First published on 3rd January 2023AbstractHerein, a novel near-infrared (NIR) self-powered photoelectrochemical platform was constructed based on nonmetallic plasmon Ti3C2 MXene coupled with sulphur vacancy engineered Bi2S3. The continuous photoelectron injection from Bi2S3 to Ti3C2 MXene induced a stable SPR effect and high photoelectric conversion efficiency, which is beneficial for developing high-performance NIR self-powered biosensors. As a proof of concept, a sensitive NIR self-powered sensor was constructed by conjunction with an aptamer using Microcystin-RR as a model analyte, which is one of the most common and toxic hepatotoxins released by cyanobacteria.
Self-powered photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors that can convert optical signals into electrical signals without an external voltage have provoked extensive research interest.1 As a burgeoning and promising sensing technique, it not only possesses the merits of high sensitivity and rapid response, but also has the advantages of portability, low cost and high efficiency, exhibiting application potential in medical detection, agriculture and environmental monitoring.1,2 Currently, most of the self-powered PEC sensors employing high energy light (ultraviolet or visible) as the excitation source still have great challenges to detect biological samples because of the strong light damage to biomolecules and the short penetration of UV/vis light in biological tissues. To address this concern, expanding the optical absorption wavelength to the near-infrared (NIR) light region will be an effective strategy for the development of PEC biosensing platforms.3 Meanwhile, the utilization of NIR light as a light source can not only make full use of the solar spectrum (more than 50%), but also has the advantages of minimal photobleaching and low phototoxicity.4 To date, very few studies have been proposed to accomplish a NIR light response in self-powered PEC biosensing due to the limited NIR photoelectrodes and restricted PEC conversion activity. Therefore, the exploration of a new strategy for realizing NIR self-powered PEC sensors still remains a great challenge.
Plasmonic materials with an intense surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect have attracted much attention in the field of photoelectric conversion.5,6 Because of the large optical interaction cross-sections at resonant frequencies of plasmonic materials, they can absorb a wide range of wavelengths in the NIR range, making them an ideal material for the construction of NIR self-powered biosensors. However, the existing plasmonic enhancement effects are mainly associated with the high cost of noble metals (e.g., Au and Ag), which has limited their wide application.6 Recently, nonmetallic plasmonic materials with abundant reserves and low-cost have attracted much attention as potential substitutes for plasmonic noble metals. A series of pioneering works have been proposed to promote plasmonic performances under NIR light. Meanwhile, the SPR effect based on nonmetallic plasmonic materials is also demonstrated to be capable of boosting the charge carrier generation (i.e., electron–hole pairs) rate of semiconductors and promoting hot electron transfer.7 As such, nonmetallic plasmon is a promising strategy to boost the PEC performances and then improve the detection sensitivity under NIR light illumination.
From recent reports, MXene Ti3C2, a kind of multi-functional 2D graphene analogue, has shown a strong SPR effect of semimetal character in the near-infrared range.8 Compared to plasmonic metals, MXenes allow for high efficiency of hot-carrier generation by metal-like high carrier density and efficient adsorption of visible-IR photons that are hardly adsorbed by wide-bandgap semiconductors.9 Nevertheless, Ti3C2 based plasmonic enhanced photoelectric conversion performance in PEC has not been fully exploited at present. Moreover, the large surface area of Ti3C2 also allows it to be a good carrier to load more biomolecules, providing a signal amplification effect in the self-powered biosensing.16 Taking all these issues into consideration, developing low-cost plasmonic materials based on nonmetallic Ti3C2 MXene for NIR self-powered biosensing is highly desirable.
Unfortunately, the free electrons in nonmetallic plasmonic materials are excited to become hot electrons upon excitation of surface plasmons with an incident electromagnetic wave, resulting in the decrease of the free electrons, which weakens the SPR effect of plasmonic materials.10 In order to obtain sufficient and stable plasmonic nanomaterials for efficient PEC activity, it would be necessary to continuously inject photogenerated electrons into plasmonic nanomaterials.10,11 Considering the abundant oxygen-containing functional group of plasmonic MXene, it can be utilized as an ideal carrier to integrate with other semiconductors to stabilize the SPR properties. Herein, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), a narrow band gap semiconductor with the merits of being inexpensive, stable and readily available,12 has been selected as a suitable semiconductor to integrate with Ti3C2 MXene. Meanwhile, sulphur vacancies were introduced to further tailor the photoelectrochemical performances of Bi2S3 by means of the formation of new energy levels and modify the charge-transfer kinetics for efficient charge separation.13 We reasoned that developing sulfur vacancy engineered Bi2S3/Ti3C2 MXene may contribute to the continuous photoelectron injection from Bi2S3 to Ti3C2 MXene, resulting in a stable SPR effect and high photoelectric conversion efficiency, which is beneficial for developing high-performance NIR self-powered biosensors. Meanwhile, in view of the sufficient Fermi level differentiation between the photoanode and photocathode, Bi2S3/Ti3C2 nonmetallic plasmonic materials and CuO nanomaterials with a narrow band gap were designed as the photoanode and photocathode, respectively (Scheme 1). As a proof of concept, a novel NIR self-powered sensor was constructed by conjunction with an aptamer using Microcystin-RR (MC-RR) as a model analyte (Fig. S1, ESI†). The as-fabricated NIR self-powered sensor displayed good performances and this work could be extended as a general protocol for other targets of interest.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the NIR self-powered aptasensor for MC-RR analysis. 
The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, as shown in Fig. 1(A). For CuO, all of the peaks were attributed to the crystal planes of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS Card No. 48-1548).14 As for Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction, most of the peaks in the XRD pattern corresponded to Bi2S3 (JCPDS Card No. 17-0320).15 XPS analysis was performed to confirm the presence of Ti3C2 MXene. As shown in Fig. 1(B), the full scan spectrum of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction exhibited O, Bi, Ti, C, and S elements, indicating the coexistence of various elements from Bi2S3 and Ti3C2.16 The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p (Fig. 1(C)) and Bi 4f (Fig. 1(D)) verified the good combination of Bi2S3 and Ti3C2. The full scan spectrum of CuO (Fig. 1(B)) confirmed the presence of Cu and O elements. And the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu 2p (Fig. S2, ESI†) displayed the characteristic peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, indicating the successful preparation of CuO. Furthermore, the morphology of the prepared samples was recorded via SEM and TEM measurements (Fig. S2–S6, ESI†), and the discussion can be found in the ESI.†

(E) UV-vis DRS spectra of Bi2S3/Ti3C2 (curve a), Bi2S3 (curve b) and Ti3C2 (curve c); (F) EPR curves of Bi2S3/Ti3C2 (curve a) and Bi2S3 (curve b). 
To explore the SPR effect in nonmetallic Ti3C2 MXene, UV-vis DRS of the prepared samples was performed. As shown in Fig. 1(E), the absorption spectrum of pure Ti3C2 (curve c) showed a strong peak in the near infrared region (NIR) around 780 nm, which could be attributed to the SPR effect of Ti3C2 MXene.17,18 Compared with pure Bi2S3 (curve b), it is found that the absorption in the NIR-light region of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction (curve a) was strengthened, which could broaden the light absorption range and generate more photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. Moreover, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S7, ESI†) demonstrated a large Raman signal enhancement of organic dyes on the surface of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene with detection of rhodamine 6G at 10−7 M concentration, further indicating the plasmonic effect of MXene. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was employed to certify the existence of sulphur vacancies. The results indicated that the Bi/S atomic ratio of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 nanocomposites (1:1.25) was higher than that of the pure Bi2S3 (1:1.47), confirming that more sulphur vacancies were generated in the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 nanocomposites. Moreover, the increased Bi/S atom ratios (Fig. S8, ESI†) and shifted S 2p peak (Fig. S9, ESI†) in the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 samples confirmed the existence of sulphur vacancies inside the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 samples. Fig. 1(F) further investigated the details of the vacancy features in the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 samples by the EPR technique. After coupling with Ti3C2 MXene (curve b), the EPR signal of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction (curve a) was significantly enhanced compared with pure Bi2S3, indicating that more sulfur vacancies were generated. These vacancies may be beneficial to the photoelectric conversion performance in changing the band gap and capturing surface charge.19 The photoelectron transfer between Bi2S3 and Ti3C2 MXene was measured by photoluminescence (PL) spectra. As can be seen in Fig. S10 (ESI†), a peak at about 680 nm was observed, which arose from the recombination of excitons and/or shallowly trapped electron–hole pairs.20 With the Ti3C2 MXene amount increased, the PL intensity decreased, demonstrating the charge transfer between Bi2S3 and Ti3C2 MXene.21 Under NIR light illumination, the continuous injection of photoelectrons stabilizes the free carrier density of Ti3C2 MXene, leading to the stable and high-performance SPR effect.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. S11, ESI†) and the photocurrent of different samples (Fig. S12, ESI†) were characterized to determine the role of nonmetallic plasmon Ti3C2 MXene. And the discussion is presented in the ESI.† As such, a novel self-powered sensor was constructed based on the photoanode (Bi2S3/Ti3C2) and the photocathode (CuO/ITO) in a single-chamber cell.
Open circuit potential (OCP) curves of the designed self-powered sensor are displayed in Fig. S13 (ESI†) with (curve a) and without (curve b) light illumination in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). Upon photoirradiation, the OCP was about 0.4254 V, which was stronger than that with no illumination, suggesting that the simulated sunlight could promote the generation of electricity by driving the transfer of electrons between the two photoelectrodes and played a crucial role in the as-prepared sensor.2
To understand the working mode of the self-powered sensor, UV-vis DRS (Fig. S14, ESI†), Mott–Schottky (Fig. S15, ESI†) and UPS spectra (Fig. S16, ESI†) were tested to estimate CB and VB, and the discussion is shown in the ESI.† Accordingly, the mechanism of the as-fabricated self-powered sensor is illustrated in Scheme 2. As for the photoanode under NIR light illumination, the electron in the VB (1.61 eV) of Bi2S3 is excited and transfers to the CB (0.04 eV), and then the presence of S vacancies can trap the electrons to suppress the recombination with holes. Meanwhile, the electron in the CB of Bi2S3 then transfers into the Ti3C2 MXene, which can stabilize the free carrier density of Ti3C2 MXene, leading to the high-performance SPR effect. Furthermore, the photocathode could also excite electrons from the VB (1.47 eV) to the CB (−0.16 eV) under NIR light illumination. Due to the potential difference of the Fermi level, the electrons would transfer through the external circuit from the CB of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction to the VB of CuO and combine with the holes at the VB of CuO.2 Thus, the as-fabricated NIR-driven self-powered PEC system is then successfully fabricated.

The thermodynamic feasibility of the designed NIR self-powered platform is measured in Fig. 2(A) and (B). The photoanodic oxidation potential of the Bi2S3/Ti3C2/ITO was 0.24 V, while the cathodic reduction potential of the Apt/CTS/CuO/ITO was 0.20 V with MC-RR (curve a) and 0.22 V without MC-RR (curve b), respectively. The photoanodic oxidation potential was much lower than the cathodic reduction, confirming the feasibility of the proposed PEC system.1,2

Chronopotentiometry and EIS were used to investigate the construction process of the as-fabricated PEC sensor (Fig. S17, ESI†), and the discussion was presented in the ESI.† To obtain the high-performance of the as-fabricated self-powered sensor, the amount of Ti3C2, pH value, aptamer concentration and incubation time were investigated in this system. As shown in Fig. S18 and S19 (ESI†), 5%wt Ti3C2, pH 7.4, 2.5 μM aptamer concentration, and 30 min incubation time were selected as the optimal experimental conditions.
Under the optimal conditions, the as-prepared self-powered sensor was employed for sensitive detection of MC-RR. With the MC-RR concentration increasing, the OCP signal gradually decreased (Fig. 3(A)). The potential value was linear with the logarithm of MC-RR concentration from 10−16 nM to 10−11 nM, which could be fitted as OCP (V) = 0.0179logC (nM) + 0.3390 with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.993 (Fig. 3(B)). The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was calculated to be 4.7 × 10−17 nM. Compared with previous studies (Table S1, ESI†), the as-fabricated sensor displayed a wider linear range as well as a lower detection limit. Moreover, the simple single-chamber structure and the no need for external energy could facilitate the development of portable instrumentation.

(C) Operational stability of the self-powered sensor under continuous light irradiation. (D) Selectivity of the as-fabricated aptasensor. 
To analyze the stability of this aptasensor, the long-time OCP curve and stability after long-term storage for six weeks were collected. The results in Fig. 3(C) and Fig. S20, S21 (ESI†) show that the potential signal of the prepared sensor tended to remain unchanged, indicating the feasibility of long-term operation. Fig. 3(D) presented the OCP property of the prepared sensor in the presence of other microcystins. When adding 1 nM MC-LA, MC-YR, and MC-LR, no significant change occurred, but when incubating with 0.01 nM MC-RR, the potential dropped sharply, meaning that this aptasensor had a great capacity for resisting disturbance.
The practical application of the as-prepared sensor was explored by the standard addition method. As displayed in Table S2 (ESI†), by adding MC-RR into tap water, pond water and fish samples, the self-powered sensor had a satisfactory recovery in the range of 97–104% with the RSD of 2.2–6.4%. The above results confirmed the feasibility of the as-prepared method for MC-RR detection in real samples.
In summary, a stable NIR self-powered dual-photoelectrode aptasensor was designed for sensitive detection of MC-RR. On the basis of sulfur vacancy-engineered Bi2S3 deposited on the nonmetallic plasmonic Ti3C2 MXene, the heterojunction displayed a stable effect, which could accelerate electron transport and broaden the light absorption. With the Bi2S3/Ti3C2 heterojunction as the photoanode for signal amplification and CuO as the photocathode for the sensing component, the as-fabricated NIR self-powered aptasensor exhibited a wide detection range from 0.1 fM to 10 pM with a low detection limit (0.047 fM). We believe that this strategy will spark new interest in the study of various MXene-based NIR PEC sensing systems.
