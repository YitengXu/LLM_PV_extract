One of the puzzling questions in this regard is electrical bias-dependent degradation of PSCs. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the effect, but none are sufficient to embrace all observations. Bias-dependent degradation has been observed in several types of previously developed solar cells, and was attributed to a variety of underlying mechanisms. For example, extrinsic and intrinsic migration of mobile ionic species, which are widely believed to be one of the main reasons for PSC instability, were known to instigate degradation of CdTe and CI(G)S-based photovoltaics. Yet, the stability of these types of solar cells was greatly improved by rational design and currently meets the requirements of in-field applications. In this paper we review the progress in the understanding of bias-dependent instabilities in different photovoltaic technologies (including perovskites) and discuss what lessons can be learned to improve the PSC stability.

Broader context
“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” (Isaac Newton, 1676).
The rapid development of metal halide perovskite solar cells made their power conversion efficiency and low manufacture cost competitive with more established photovoltaic technologies. However, long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is currently the most challenging issue for commercial success of this technology, and understanding mechanisms of device instability is the key aspect to achieve this goal. Since solar cells typically operate under externally applied electrical bias, we focus herein on bias-induced degradation mechanisms, and discuss the lessons to be learnt from previously observed bias-induced degradation phenomena in other, well established, commercial photovoltaic technologies. Furthermore, we suggest methodologies to reduce bias-induced degradation in perovskite solar cells, based on the rational design that previously led to improved stability in further-established photovoltaic devices, which currently meets the requirements of in-field applications. Long-term stability combined with high efficiency and low costs, offered by perovskite solar cells, can lead to a breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics.

Introduction
The rapid development of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) made their power conversion efficiency (PCE) (the record certified value is above 23%1) competitive with more established photovoltaic (PV) technologies such as those based on Si (a record PCE of 26.7%) or CdTe (∼21–22%).2 It is well accepted now that achieving stable devices is the most challenging issue for commercial success of this technology. Multiple parameters were found to affect PSC degradation extent and rates, including visible3 and UV4 light, temperature5 and its variation,6 exposure to air,7,8 and electrical bias.8–12 While cells will typically operate under their maximum power point (MPP), and their stability should be quantified under such conditions,10,13 understanding the bias effect on PSC stability can elucidate the underlying degradation mechanisms, and hence the ways to eliminate them. Furthermore, in tandem cell configurations the applied bias might deviate from the MPP, further demonstrating the significance of understanding bias-dependent degradation mechanisms.
The bias condition affects internal fields, current and accumulation of charge carriers in the device, as schematically described in Fig. 1a. The cell at short circuit (SC) has the highest current density and internal electric field but the lowest concentration of accumulated charges, compared to other bias conditions. In contrast, open circuit (OC) represents the condition with no current flow, hence maximal accumulation of photo-induced charge carriers which are not extracted from the device. As the cell is forward biased there, the internal field is minimal. The MPP is intermediate to these two extreme cases.

(b) Normalized published power conversion efficiency variations of CdTe/CdS and perovskite solar cells after light stress at different bias conditions.10,11,18,19 The x axis scale is arbitrary. The lines are guides for the eye. 
Bias-dependent degradation rates were clearly demonstrated in PSCs. Under a protective environment, photo-degradation was found to be faster at OC than at SC.10,11 Smaller forward bias, equal or close to the MPP, showed slower (or no) degradation compared to the OC condition.8–11,14,15 One study even showed slower degradation at the MPP compared to both OC and SC conditions, indicating a non-monotonous bias effect under illumination (Fig. 1b and 2a).10 Faster degradation at OC than that at the MPP voltage was also observed in the dark under a protective environment.9 Application of reverse bias (RB) was also demonstrated to cause PSC degradation,16 in particular in a humid environment.17
 Fig. 2  The effect of load applied to PSC devices on their stability.10 The devices were held under a protective atmosphere at MPP, OC or SC conditions during ageing and their J–V curves were measured periodically. The panels show the evolution of PCE (a), VOC (b), fill factor (FF) (c) and JSC (d) measured in the backward J–V scan (from OC to SC), as well as hysteresis (defined as the ratio of efficiencies measured from backward and forward J–V scans) (e). The values are normalized to the initial ones. The lines represent averaged behavior of devices, while the shaded area represents the standard deviation. After 250 h of ageing under illumination, the devices were allowed to recover in the dark for 24 h before being re-measured, and the resulting PV parameters are displayed as single points at the right-hand side of every panel. The illumination source was white LEDs (at 1 sun intensity). Reproduced from ref. 10, with permission from Springer Nature. 

Fig. 2 reproduces the results of the most systematic research of bias-dependent degradation in PSCs.10 In this study it was statistically verified that for PSCs under a protective atmosphere photodegradation of the short-circuit current density (JSC) is more affected by bias than that of the open-circuit voltage (VOC). This finding is in accord with the results of other studies.6,9,11 Photodegradation of JSC was found to be faster at SC,6,10 while the fill-factor (FF) (most significantly) and VOC (10% only) degraded faster at OC, though both values stabilized after several hours.10 However, Nie et al. showed faster photodegradation of JSC and FF at OC compared to SC conditions (on the timescale of few hours), while VOC was stable.11JSC was the parameter most affected by forward (“VOC”) biasing (compared to VMPP biasing) also in the dark.9 Different trends in the variation of the photovoltaic parameters point to multiple bias-dependent degradation mechanisms with respect to the experimental details. Moreover, as FF, VOC and JSC variations may have different trends upon aging, the magnitude of various effects will determine the PCE evolution under certain bias conditions.
Multiple previously developed PV technologies also faced bias-dependent degradation: CdTe,18–21 CuInSe2 (CIS),22 hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H),23 organic photovoltaics (OPV)24,25 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).26–29 In particular, in CdTe/CdS solar cells the least degradation was found for cells stressed at the MPP, compared with cells stressed at forward bias or at reverse bias. Stressing at VOC resulted in the fastest degradation.18,30–32Fig. 1b shows the bias-dependent PCE decrease upon light stressing of CdTe/CdS and perovskite solar cells. The stress conditions and cell architectures are different, but in all cases the degradation is affected by bias and might be non-monotonous with a minimum either at SC or around the MPP. Such behavior cannot be explained if only one bias-dependent degradation mechanism affects the cell performance.19 Herein we review mechanisms suggested to explain bias-dependent degradation in PSCs as well as in other types of thin film solar cells, and discuss the lessons to be learnt from them regarding PSC degradation mechanisms and their prevention.
Lessons learned from bias-dependent degradation mechanisms in various solar cells
Several degradation mechanisms were suggested to explain bias-dependent degradation. Photo-induced trap formation was suggested to increase recombination and induce space charges in a-Si:H33,34 and OPV cells exposed to oxygen.35,36 Bias-dependent degradation rates may then be related to the traps’ occupation by charge carriers determined by their energy levels with respect to the Fermi level.37,38 The trap occupation probability is expected to peak at the OC condition. Defect passivation33 or device design to eliminate oxygen36 were suggested to suppress this mechanism.
Another widely observed degradation mechanism is migration of mobile ionic species. Ion migration/drift in electric fields can be divided into two types. We term as “intrinsic ion migration” that occurring only within the cell active layer(s) while “extrinsic ion migration” describes inter-layer ion migration, from the active layer to charge transport layers and/or vice versa.
Intrinsic ion migration was widely found in solar cells based on ionic semiconductors such as CuInGaS/Se (CIGS) and CuInSe2 (CIS) PV cells,39 however, these devices exhibit remarkable operational stability, defect tolerance and radiation hardness.40 Such behavior was attributed to active self-healing mechanisms facilitated by bias-dependent migration of charged Cu-related defects and defect reactions.41,42 Interestingly, a similar idea was applied in the middle of the last century to prolong crystalline silicon module lifetime in space applications. Silicon was intentionally doped with Li, which can migrate towards defects formed upon high energy radiation and form neutral complexes.43,44 Thus, mobile ions in the active layer material may provide an avenue for dynamic stabilization of the material in response to radiation-induced defect formation, rather than hampering device stability.
Facile extrinsic Cu+ migration/ionic diffusion was presumably the cause of the lack of stability that prevented Cu2S/CdS solar cells from commercialization.45,46 In these devices, the change of Cu2S stoichiometry due to Cu loss by diffusion into adjacent layers (mostly CdS) led to cell degradation.47 Nonetheless, Cu based PV materials evolved to a new generation with sufficiently long lifetimes by the addition of indium or another metal(s) to form CuXS2/Se2, which resulted in significant reduction (but not elimination) of Cu mobility in alloys such as CuIn(Ga)S(e) and Cu2ZnSn(S/Se)4.39,46 Specifically, the decreased Cu chemical potential in the ternary/quaternary material prevented its (extrinsic) migration to other cell layers.48 Favorable chemical potential tuning of mobile species by well-designed alloying may therefore dramatically improve the device's stability.
Copper is also used in the back contact of CdTe/CdS cells and leads to significant performance improvement compared to copper-free devices, mostly by forming a Cu2Te layer at the interface.49 However, the high mobility of extrinsic Cu ions in the CdTe/CdS active layers limits the cell's stability. Interstitial Cui+ can diffuse into the CdTe layer due to the concentration gradient, but the built-in potential in the depletion region acts as a diffusion barrier.30 Application of forward bias in the dark or illumination at the open circuit condition leads to a decrease in the built-in potential,30,50 allowing easier Cui+ entry into the depletion region causing a decrease in shunt resistance, unfavorable doping of CdS, degradation of the main cell junction and back contact barrier formation due to Cu depletion.19,20 Indeed, stressing at VOC resulted in the fastest degradation of these cells.18,30,31,51 The application of reverse bias in dark/short circuit conditions under illumination was also found to degrade CdTe/CdS devices after minor initial improvement.30 This behavior was suggested to originate from the initial increased electric field repulsion of Cui+ ions from the CdTe/CdS interface leading to a slight improvement in VOC. Later, slowly migrating Cu substitution ions (CuCd−) reach the depletion region, where they are pulled inside by the built-in field and cause junction degradation. In many cases the least degradation was found for cells stressed at the maximum power point, compared with cells stressed at forward bias or at reverse bias.18,30,31,51 The presence of two migrating species with different mobility and charge polarity may therefore explain the non-monotonous bias-dependence of the degradation rate in CdTe cells (Fig. 1b). The degradation rates of CdTe/CdS cells with Cu-free back contacts (or with ZnTe as a blocking interfacial layer) were slower than those of cells with Cu-containing back contacts18,20,31,52–54 and with smaller bias-dependence.19 Diffusion barriers and elimination of mobile species from adjacent layers are obvious solutions for extrinsic ion migration-related degradation. However, the case of CdTe cells also shows that internal fields may actually prevent bias-induced degradation if they oppose the diffusion of specific charged species.
In general, bias-dependent ion transport can also be caused by electron flow, frequently termed as the electromigration, “electron drag” or “electron wind” effect. It is known to be significant at high current densities.55,56 Such an effect would lead to stronger degradation at the SC condition, where the current density is maximal. However, typical current densities in PSCs are currently too small for this mechanism to dominate.
Degradation mechanisms promoted by accumulated charge carriers would be stronger at OC. For example, OPV can degrade faster at OC due to fullerene dimerization which is accelerated by the increased exciton concentration.24,25 It was shown that this process can be overcome by adding exciton quenching materials to the active layer.25 Another example is a-Si:H cells in which electron–hole recombination events may lead to dangling bond formation due to release of hydrogen atoms (the Staebler–Wronski effect57), which results in faster degradation at OC.23 This may be reversed by hydrogen re-bonding during annealing, a methodology which may be applicable to degradation products trapped within the active layer in other cell types.
Nardone et al.58 predicted that CdTe/CdS cells would degrade faster at the OC condition since the increased charge carrier concentration reduces defect formation energies. The same can be relevant for PSCs. Formation energies of point defects in halide perovskites (anion and cation vacancies, interstitials and substitutions) are available in the literature59,60 and are likely affected by the bias conditions.
Partial reversibility of degradation was found for several cell types. Partial recovery in the dark after long-term degradation was noted in CdTe cells with Cu-containing back contacts,20 with full recovery available only after relatively small degradation.21 Smaller recovery was noted in CdTe cells with Cu-free back contacts.20 Partial recovery after annealing in air was explained by restoration of favorable Cu-related defect complexes.61 Recovery from particle- and high energy-radiation damage in CdTe cells was also recorded, presumably due to defect compensation in CdTe,62 somewhat reminiscent of CIGS cells, where fast self-healing is suggested to explain radiation hardness.42 Removal of contact degradation due to extrinsic ion migration by re-contacting was shown for both CdTe21,54,63 and CIGS64 cells. The Staebler–Wronski effect in a-Si:H cells was shown to be reversible at elevated temperatures, as discussed above. Hence defect self-healing, on different time scales, is certainly possible for thin film solar cells, while cell-specific degradation mechanisms may require certain external stimuli for repair.
Bias-dependent degradation mechanisms in PSCs and suggested methodologies to avoid them
One of the first studied degradation mechanisms of halide perovskite-based devices was decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 into PbI2 and volatile components in ambient atmosphere. This process was shown to be bias dependent (stronger at the MPP condition than at open circuit65), as moisture ingress results in formation of hydrated perovskite containing mobile ions, whose drift accelerates further decomposition.17,66 Such a voltage-accelerated process can be prevented by appropriate encapsulation. Nie et al.11 proposed photo-induced trap formation in CH3NH3PbI3, as in a-Si:H, which caused the bias-dependent appearance of charged regions leading to non-homogeneous internal fields and photocurrent degradation. Formation of these trap states was related to carrier–lattice coupling yielding polaron formation. Handa et al.67 also suggested charged trap formation to explain degradation under forward bias and illumination, however, this was observed only in air, as suggested for OPV cells, therefore related to accelerated chemical reactions at the perovskite surface.
Bias-dependent PSC degradation was attributed to intrinsic ion migration within the perovskite layer in several studies. Ion migration can occur by vacancy migration or by interstitial ion hopping. The formation energies of such point defects depend on the materials’ chemical potential/Fermi level, and in several cases are low enough for them to form at room temperature by thermodynamic (entropy) and kinetic (fast crystal growth from high temperatures and quenching) driving forces.59,60,68 The energetics of localized states associated with such defects is still debated. Iodine (I−)- and methylammonium (MA+)-related defects are considered to be the most mobile migrating species.69–72 I− migration was found to trigger PbI2 nucleation and void formation.73
Migrating charged defects were speculated to affect the cell space charge regions, formed at the interfaces between the perovskite and the charge selective layers due to Fermi level equilibration. When a forward bias equal to or smaller than VMPP is applied (in the dark), the field in these space charge regions repels ion migration of the opposite charge into them. Under larger forward bias the internal fields are reduced and such migration, driven by concentration gradients, can occur. This, in turn, may decrease the net charge in the space charge region(s), narrowing them (or even causing inversion) and hampering efficient collection of photogenerated current.9 This mechanism does not account for degradation observed under SC conditions. Schwenzer et al.6 suggested that temperature-accelerated ion migration under the internal built-in field, as in the case of SC conditions, will widen the space charge regions with a larger bias drop there. This will reduce the electric field in the bulk of the perovskite layer, hampering charge separation there.6 However, this driving force is opposed by forward biasing (applied externally or by illumination). Fig. 3 shows schematic electronic band diagrams of a PSC at OC and SC conditions to illustrate possible directions of intrinsic and extrinsic ion migration. The electric fields induced by energy level variations affect electron migration, but are expected to qualitatively similarly affect the migration of all charged species.

Bars and circles with +/− refer to positive and negative ions from perovskite (bars) and other (circles) layers of the device. The arrows show possible directions of ion migration. 
It should be noted that the presence of intrinsic mobile ions does not necessarily mean that halide perovskite-based devices cannot be stable. As learned from the history of Cu2S and CI(G)S solar cells, the key is to decrease the chemical potential of migrating ions or/and to form an energetic barrier for ion migration. A change of perovskite formulation was demonstrated to affect ion motion (though not always resulting in better stability), and the search for compositions suppressing ion migration is ongoing.75,76 Furthermore, perovskites are characterized by a certain self-healing ability and radiation hardness.11,77–81 This feature could be related to ion migration inside the active layer (as in the case of CI(G)S and Li doped silicon cells). Further investigation and deep understanding of this property (which is almost exclusively studied for space applications at the moment) may result in defining the role of intrinsic ionic movement in device (in)stability.
Migration of extrinsic ionic species out of and into the active layer, as previously shown for Cu in CdTe- and Cu2S-based cells, was also reported for PSCs.14,82–87 For example, diffusion of species from the hole transporting layer was shown to affect the cell performance.14,82 Oxygen ions released from TiO2 under forward bias caused partial amorphization and decomposition of the perovskite.85 External ion migration can also be detrimental if ions from the perovskite move to the contact layers. For example, I− was shown to corrode adjacent layers.83,86 MA+ ions can also migrate into the hole transporting material creating deep traps.87 Ming et al. calculated energy barriers for diffusion of common back electrode metals to predict the probability of metal ion penetration into the active layer.60 They showed that Cu+, Ag+, Au+, Co+, Ni+ and Pd+ can easily enter the MAPbI3 perovskite migrating via interstitial sites, while Cr+, Mo2+/3+, W2+/3+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Pd2+ interstitials are largely immobile at room temperature. External ions may not necessarily return to their original spatial distribution after the stress is removed, depending on the respective changes in their chemical potential, which should be the subject of further theoretical and experimental research, as noted above. Avoiding unfavorable transport by rational selection of contact material combinations as well as employment of ion blocking layers88 is an effective strategy to mitigate extrinsic ion migration and improve PSC stability.
Radical formation via bond breakage by accumulated charge carriers was suggested by Domanski et al. to explain the severe degradation observed at OC conditions under illumination and a protective atmosphere.10 A similar but more detailed idea was suggested by Bryant et al. to explain the enhanced degradation rate under OC/light conditions and at forward bias in the dark in air.8,89 They suggested the reaction of oxygen with accumulated photo-electrons resulting in superoxide formation. This degradation mode might not be relevant if a strict encapsulation strategy is employed. Birkhold et al. suggested Pb2+ reduction by non-equilibrium electrons as the process leading to trap formation in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.90 This conclusion is based on comparison of lateral devices with blocking and non-blocking contacts: while ions are moving in both devices under applied bias, increased non-radiative recombination was only observed if electron injection was allowed. Another degradation mechanism triggered by electron accumulation is photo-induced halide segregation in mixed-halide perovskites.91,92 It was shown that the effect originates from localized strains induced by photo-excited charges interacting with the perovskite lattice.93 Therefore, halide segregation was observed in the OC condition, but not at SC or the MPP, where photo-generated carriers are extracted out of the absorber.15 As learned from OPV and a-Si:H, fast charge extraction is a good way to limit degradation pathways instigated by charge accumulation.
Full or partial recovery in the dark after performance loss during light exposure was repeatedly shown for PSCs.11,78–80,91,94 Distinction should be made between short-term degradation, i.e., that which is reversible during the night-time, and long-term, irreversible degradation. Intrinsic ion migration is expected to be fully reversible in the dark, as the electric field returns to the equilibrium condition. Another form of short-term degradation is halide segregation under illumination, fully recoverable shortly after light turn-off,91,92 which is bias-dependent as described above. PSC performance improvement under illumination after degradation in the dark, attributed to trap filling, which is bias-dependent, was also reported.4,79,95,96
If irreversible, long-term PSC degradation is observed, it may point to the involvement of other degradation mechanisms.94 We have recently shown that the extent of PSC recovery depends on the extent of cell degradation and, in turn, can manifest differently on various timescales. This may be related to formation of meta-stable defects or ion redistribution,79 which transfer the PSC degradation from being reversible and short-term to permanent and long-term. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no published systematic data showing the bias effect on degradation at different timescales.

Table 1 summarizes the observations of bias-dependent degradation, studied device architectures and suggested failure modes. It appears that bias-dependence of PSC degradation occurs for different cell architectures (p–i–n and n–i–p; planar and inverted) and perovskite compositions. OC conditions repeatedly induced faster degradation than SC and MPP. Within this limited data, we conclude that this phenomenon is common to different PSCs.

We postulate that all mechanisms described above can be active in a given PSC, with changing dominance at different bias conditions, and that their combination can explain the observed non-monotonous bias-dependent degradation behavior. At the SC condition, light-induced traps are expected to be non-populated and therefore harmless.11 Intrinsic ion migration under this condition is driven by the internal interfacial/junction fields, as suggested by Schwenzer et al.,6 mitigating charge separation in the perovskite bulk. Degradation induced by this mechanism may be reversible. Extrinsic ion migration will also be driven by the internal field, with positive ions (such as MA+, and Li+) pushed towards the HTM and negative ions (such as halide anions) towards the ETM (Fig. 3). This may cause irreversible degradation in photocurrent collection. The opposite direction of ion drift is prevented by the internal fields, as was described for CdTe cells.
Under the MPP condition, light-induced traps are expected to be partially populated, creating small charged regions. Intrinsic ion migration should be small, with the applied bias being close in magnitude and opposite in direction to the built-in potential. External migration of perovskite ions into adjacent layers is expected to be the dominant mechanism, driven by the (reduced) interfacial fields. Concentration gradients may also contribute to it, as the reduced interfacial fields now cannot effectively repel the opposite ion migration (negative ions into the HTM etc.). As none of these mechanisms is at its peak, the reduced degradation rate at the MPP compared to the OC condition is understandable. We note that a high voltage of the MPP (VMPP) would suppress the related extrinsic ion migration. In this context, the development of perovskite cells with higher FF is desirable for stability improvement.6 It also means that degradation will be accelerated if the cell's FF decreases during aging. This effect can be more pronounced in tandem cells with a two-terminal architecture where the perovskite sub-cell may operate at voltages lower that its own VMPP.6
Under the OC condition the degradation rate is expected to be maximal: light-induced traps are expected to be highly populated, creating significant charged regions hampering photocurrent collection. This degradation may be reversible. Radical formation peaks due to electron accumulation, and can be irreversible due to the formation of new chemical bonds. Extrinsic ion migration can be driven by concentration gradients (i.e., diffusion), with minimal opposing internal fields, allowing perovskite ions to penetrate and degrade both charge transport layers, possibly also causing changes in the perovskite stoichiometry.
Conclusions
We compared the effect of electrical bias-dependent degradation in PSCs to that observed in previously developed PV technologies. Several phenomena, such as different variation trends of PV parameters and non-monotonous dependence of the PSC degradation on bias, suggest that multiple bias-dependent processes affect the cell stability.
The discussed bias dependent degradation mechanisms include: bias-dependent charging of light-generated traps; intrinsic ion migration, i.e., the migration of ions within the active layer under internal junction fields; extrinsic ion migration, i.e., inter-layer ion migration driven by internal fields (drift) and/or by concentration gradients (diffusion); and radical formation due to electron accumulation. Comparison to other solar cells suggests ways to prevent or repair specific degradation mechanisms, which may be applicable to PSCs.
We suggest that the combination of the degradation mechanisms mentioned above, with changing dominance at different bias conditions, can explain the observed bias-dependent degradation behavior in PSCs. Specifically, accelerated degradation under OC conditions is ascribed to trap charging combined with radical formation, and assisted by undesirable extrinsic ion diffusion that is not prevented by internal fields. Slower degradation under SC and MPP conditions is ascribed to internal and external ion migration due to internal interfacial fields. The reversibility of the various degradation mechanisms is also discussed.
Further research is required to implement prevention/remediation methods against bias-dependent degradation mechanisms in PSCs. The required data include defect formation energies as a function of applied electric field, the chemical potential of charged defects in the different cell layer materials, possible defect reactions toward annihilation, charge extraction rates as a function of different contact layer compositions, etc. Should such data become available the effect of different degradation mechanisms can be rationally minimized, as previously shown for several types of thin film solar cells.

Broader context
“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” (Isaac Newton, 1676).
The rapid development of metal halide perovskite solar cells made their power conversion efficiency and low manufacture cost competitive with more established photovoltaic technologies. However, long-term stability of perovskite solar cells is currently the most challenging issue for commercial success of this technology, and understanding mechanisms of device instability is the key aspect to achieve this goal. Since solar cells typically operate under externally applied electrical bias, we focus herein on bias-induced degradation mechanisms, and discuss the lessons to be learnt from previously observed bias-induced degradation phenomena in other, well established, commercial photovoltaic technologies. Furthermore, we suggest methodologies to reduce bias-induced degradation in perovskite solar cells, based on the rational design that previously led to improved stability in further-established photovoltaic devices, which currently meets the requirements of in-field applications. Long-term stability combined with high efficiency and low costs, offered by perovskite solar cells, can lead to a breakthrough in the field of photovoltaics.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic solar cell J–V curve under illumination indicating the effects resulting from different bias conditions. (b) Normalized published power conversion efficiency variations of CdTe/CdS and perovskite solar cells after light stress at different bias conditions.10,11,18,19 The x axis scale is arbitrary. The lines are guides for the eye.	 

 	Fig. 2  The effect of load applied to PSC devices on their stability.10 The devices were held under a protective atmosphere at MPP, OC or SC conditions during ageing and their J–V curves were measured periodically. The panels show the evolution of PCE (a), VOC (b), fill factor (FF) (c) and JSC (d) measured in the backward J–V scan (from OC to SC), as well as hysteresis (defined as the ratio of efficiencies measured from backward and forward J–V scans) (e). The values are normalized to the initial ones. The lines represent averaged behavior of devices, while the shaded area represents the standard deviation. After 250 h of ageing under illumination, the devices were allowed to recover in the dark for 24 h before being re-measured, and the resulting PV parameters are displayed as single points at the right-hand side of every panel. The illumination source was white LEDs (at 1 sun intensity). Reproduced from ref. 10, with permission from Springer Nature.	 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic description of the electronic band diagrams of the active layer in PSCs at OC and SC conditions (assuming a p–i–n structure74). Bars and circles with +/− refer to positive and negative ions from perovskite (bars) and other (circles) layers of the device. The arrows show possible directions of ion migration.
