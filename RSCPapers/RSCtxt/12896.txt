    , Accepted 1st April 2014First published on 1st April 2014AbstractA simple and low-cost solution-processed method is used to fabricate ZnO/Ag nanowire/ZnO composite UV photodetectors with a large area of 4 × 5 mm2, low operating voltage of 1 V and high visible transmittance of 75%. Due to the low-dimensionality confinement ability and small persistent photoconductivity effect in polycrystalline ZnO nanoparticle thin films and excellent conductivity of Ag nanowire networks, composite UV photodetectors exhibit a high on/off ratio and short response time under high light illumination, while exhibiting large detectivity and responsivity under low light illumination. Compared with traditional polycrystalline ZnO thin films, the formation of a large number of Ohmic contacts between ZnO nanoparticles and Ag nanowires in a composite structure greatly improves the extraction number and shortens the extraction time of photoelectrons. Additionally, both Schottky contact and Ohmic contact at the electrode interface can obtain a high on/off ratio and short response time. Our composite structure device is regarded as a compromise between high-performance with large-area, low-voltage and low-cost. It has many advantages compared with its counterparts include ZnO nanowires, and other ZnO composites, which is very promising in UV photodetective applications.
1. Introduction
For decades, UV photodetectors have been widely used in many applications such as flame sensing, environmental research, astronomical study, optical communication, and so on.1 Across all application areas, several critical performance parameters for UV photodetectors include responsivity, response time, and detectivity.2 For example, for flame sensing application, high responsivity of 0.1 A W−1, short response time of 1–3 s, and high detectivity of 1011 Jones are necessary for UV photodetectors based on photoconductor type.3 Besides, some requirements such as large photosensitive area, low operating voltage, room temperature operation, simple processing conditions, and low-cost integration are also necessary for practical applications. Compared with commercial silicon photodiodes, UV photodetectors based on wide bandgap semiconductors have received more and more attention due to their intrinsic visible-blindness and enabling of room-temperature operation.4 In particular, ZnO has great potential in UV detection due to its large bandgap of 3.35 eV at room temperature, and various synthetic methods. A solution-processed method can produce ZnO thin films with large area and different morphology, including nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods (NRs) and nanowires (NWs), which is very flexible and low cost. Besides, Tian et al. reported ZnO–SnO2 heterojunction nanofiber UV photodetectors with high performance based on an electrospinning process, which is another excellent method for producing large-scale nanofiber films with low cost.5
ZnO NW UV photodetectors have been studied widely due to their high on/off current ratio and fast response and recovery speeds.6,7 Previously, Su et al. fabricated vertical ZnO NW array UV photodetectors using a hydrothermal method.8 Furthermore, their group fabricated laterally aligned ZnO nanobridge UV photodetectors to improve responsivity and shorten recovery time.9 Besides, Bai et al. demonstrated that integrating multiple ZnO NWs connected in parallel was an effective approach to fabricate large-scale flexible NW photodetectors with a high on/off ratio.7 However, compared with ZnO NWs, ZnO NPs with reduced dimensionality can confine the active area of the charge carrier better.10 Additionally, ZnO NP thin films have little persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect,8 which means the photocurrent persists for a long time after the light is shut off. This PPC effect often appears in ZnO NW photodetectors8,11–13 and GaN-based devices.14 Even so, the polycrystalline nanoparticle thin films still have the shortcoming of poor conductivity. Thus, high operating voltage is required to get a large photocurrent. For example, Jin et al. reported that the photocurrent of a ZnO NP UV photodetector reached 310 μA only when 120 V bias was applied.1 Our previous research also indicated that 30 V bias was needed for PbSe15 and PbTe16 NP thin films. This operating voltage may be too high to meet the requirement of low power and easy integration. In order to overcome poor conductivity and further improve the performance of photodetectors, many ZnO composite UV photodetectors based on Ag NWs,17 Ag NPs,18 Au NPs,19 graphene20,21 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)10 have appeared.
Among many methods for improving the performance of polycrystalline ZnO NP thin film UV photodetectors, we particularly expect to build a conductive network buried in ZnO NP thin films and further create excellent Ohmic contact between ZnO NPs and conductive network so that a large number of conductive paths can be created in the composite thin films. After doing this, the photoelectrons in ZnO NPs can be transferred to electrodes and extracted to the external circuit rapidly. As is well known, Ag NW thin films can act as transparent electrodes in solar cells and flat panel displays due to their high conductivity and optical transmittance.22–24 Therefore, if Ag NWs can be buried in ZnO NP thin films, this will not only greatly improve the extraction number of photoelectrons, but also shorten the extraction time in polycrystalline thin films. Then, no doubt a high responsivity and short response time will be achieved.
In this paper, the ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors were fabricated according to the process described in the Experimental details. Several measurements included optical transmittance and IV characteristic and time-dependent photoresponse have been conducted for composite UV photodetectors fabricated under different processing conditions. Then some performance parameters including photocurrent, on/off ratio, responsivity, detectivity, and response and recovery time could be obtained. The results indicate that ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors with a large active area of 4 × 5 mm2 prepared by an optimized process exhibit excellent UV photodetective performance. Thus, our strategy can be comparable with hybrid PbS quantum dots (QDs)/graphene IR photodetector with ultrahigh responsivity,25,26 which depends on rapid transfer of holes from PbS QDs to graphene.
2. Results and discussion
The structure of the ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetector is depicted in Fig. 1a. The three layer structure like a sandwich includes a bottom ZnO NP thin film, a middle Ag NW network, and an upper coated ZnO NP layer. The crystal grain size of bottom ZnO NP layer is about 20 nm (Fig. S1a†). From Fig. 1b, we can see Ag NWs through the compact upper ZnO NP layer clearly, indicating a very thin layer of upper ZnO NPs. Fig. S2† shows XRD and TEM analyses of the three layers. Besides, Fig. 1c shows that Ag NW junctions are totally coated with an upper ZnO layer, which demonstrates that a conductive network is buried in the ZnO NP layer, and good contact can be created between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs. In addition, the coated layer of upper ZnO can not only greatly increase the contact area between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs, but also play a role in protecting Ag NWs from physical scratching, which has been tested in ref. 22. From the magnified area in Fig. S3,† the electrode gap is 4 mm, and an Ag NW network can be built across the entire electrode gap. From the cross section of the device in Fig. 1d, combined with Fig. S1b,† the three layer structure and very thin layer of upper ZnO NPs can be further confirmed.

In order to verify the effectiveness of this device structure, we compared the IV characteristic of two UV photodetectors (Fig. 2a), ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite films and two layers ZnO NP thin films without a middle Ag NW layer. The Ag electrodes with a gap of 4 mm were first chosen to rule out the impact of electrode contact. The symmetrical and linear characteristics of the IV curve confirms the Ohmic contact between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs. Under light illumination of 10 μW cm−2, the ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite film UV photodetector has a photocurrent of 4.7 μA, while the ZnO NP thin film only has 0.08 μA. Besides, the photoresponse times of the two UV photodetectors are 16 s (Fig. 3d) and 74 s (Fig. S4†), respectively. This great difference demonstrates that the middle Ag NW network plays a role in rapidly transferring photoelectrons in ZnO NPs to electrodes. However, the performance of the composite UV photodetector has a close relationship with the Ag NW density. When Ag NW films are spin-coated from Ag NW ink with a given concentration, the lower spin speed will produce denser Ag NW films, which can be confirmed in Fig. S5.† The dependence of photocurrent and on/off ratio on the spin speed of Ag NWs is described in Fig. 2b. The photocurrent shows a monotonical increase as the spin speed of Ag NWs decreases. Besides, when the spin speed of Ag NWs is 1500 rpm, the on/off ratio of the device can reach 313, which is much larger than speeds for the remaining three devices. A similar trend occurs for another parameter, the thickness of the bottom ZnO layer. When the procedure for forming the bottom ZnO layer is repeated twice, corresponding to a thickness of 85 nm, the largest on/off ratio is 40 (Fig. 2c). Based on these experiment results, we find that too much Ag NWs and bottom ZnO layer have a large photocurrent but a low on/off ratio. Therefore, we conclude that the optimized processing condition for the ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetector is a bottom ZnO layer with a thickness of 85 nm, Ag NW films with a spin speed of 1500 rpm, and a thin upper layer of ZnO NPs. Another important point in UV photodetectors is the wavelength-dependent responsivity, indicating the spectral selectivity of photoresponse, which is quite related to the transmittance of composite thin films at different wavelengths. From Fig. 2d, all thin films have nearly the same UV transmittance at wavelengths shorter than 380 nm, and the thin films without Ag NWs have the largest visible transmittance around 85% (at 550 nm). Besides, the lower spin speed of Ag NWs produces a smaller visible transmittance, corresponding to a denser Ag NW network, which is in accordance with the results described above. In addition, we find that there is the same optical transmittance for composite thin films with and without upper ZnO NPs, which confirms the upper layer of ZnO NPs is very thin. If the upper ZnO layer is too thick, both the conductivity and transmittance of composite films will decrease.

To get a better understanding of the photodetective mechanism, we investigated the IV curves of the ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetector with optimized processing conditions under different light illumination (Fig. 3a). The IV curves are symmetrical and linear as previously discussed. One figure of merit for photodetectors is a linear dynamic range (LDR),27 which can be expressed by LDR = 20log(Jph/Jd)(1)where Jph and Jd are the photocurrent and dark current, respectively. Fig. 3b summarizes the obtained photocurrent at 1 V bias from Fig. 3aversus the light illumination. The largest photocurrent is 41.8 μA under the light illumination of 4.9 mW cm−2. Besides, under the light illumination of 1 mW cm−2, the calculated LDR is 64 dB, which is very close to InGaAs photodetectors (66 dB).27,28 In addition, the detectivity D* is commonly reported as an important parameter to describe the sensitivity of photodetectors.29 Based on Gong's discussion,28 if the shot noise from the dark current is the major contributor to the total noise, D* can be simplified as D* (cm Hz1/2 W−1 or Jones) = (Jph/AEi)/(2qJd)1/2(2)where q is the electronic charge, A is the active area, and Ei is the light intensity. The calculated detectivity as a function of light illumination is plotted in Fig. 3b. The calculated values of detectivity change from 1011 to 1013 Jones. In particular, the largest detectivity is 6.8 × 1012 Jones at 1 V bias under the light illumination of 10 μW cm−2, indicating the excellent weak light detection capability of composite UV photodetectors, which is comparable with that of PbS colloidal QD IR photodetectors (1.5 × 1012 Jones)30 and composite PbSe dual wavelength photodetectors (3 × 1013 Jones).27 This result further verifies the structural advantage of ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors. The Ag NWs embedded in polycrystalline ZnO NP thin films develop the excellent role of transferring electrons to improve the output of photoelectrons, which can even be compared with single crystalline ZnO Schottky photodiodes fabricated by the MOCVD technique.31Table 1 summarizes the various reports about ZnO UV photodetectors in comparison with our experimental results.

The time-dependent measurements of photoresponse were employed to study the response and recovery time. The response time τr, usually defined as the time to approach 63% of the maximum photocurrent, and the recovery time τd, is the time to decay to 37% of the maximum photocurrent.20 We fitted the rising and decay curves using an exponential function in Fig. 3c. Under the light illumination of 4.9 mW cm−2, the response and recovery times are 3.53 s and 3.67 s, respectively, and there is no PPC effect. These response and recovery times are much shorter than those for most reported polycrystalline ZnO NP photodetectors, whose response times can range from minutes to hours.32,33 Furthermore, the time-dependent photoresponse under different light illumination was plotted in Fig. 3d, indicating prolonged response and recovery times with decreasing light illumination, which is in accordance with other's results.34 All of the above good results for ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors come from the interaction between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs. When ZnO NPs come into contact with Ag NWs, electrons will flow from Ag NWs to ZnO NPs to establish a uniform Fermi energy level, and the space charge layer can form at the interface.17Fig. 4a describes the energy band structure of forming heterojunctions between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs. The formed downward bending of the ZnO conduction band suppresses the recombination of excitons under light illumination, allowing more photoholes to discharge trapped electrons at the surface states of ZnO NPs while accelerating the movement of photoelectrons toward the Ag NWs. Next, we will explain the photoresponse of ZnO based on the adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules on the surface. The ZnO NPs have the advantage of very large surface to volume ratios, which facilitate the adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules. The oxygen molecules are adsorbed on the surface by capturing free electrons in ZnO NPs to create the depletion regions, producing high resistance in nanocrystal films (100 MΩ in our experiments). When exposed to photons with energy higher than Eg of ZnO, electron–hole pairs are generated (Fig. 4b). The photoholes can migrate to the surface along the potential gradient and recombine with the O2− trapped electrons, thus releasing O2 from the surface. The remaining photoelectrons can be transferred to the Ag NWs rapidly with the help of formed heterojunctions. Then a large number of photoelectrons can be transferred to electrodes by the Ag NW conductive network as a “highway”. When the light is shut off, oxygen molecules readsorb onto the ZnO NP surfaces by capturing photoelectrons. On the other hand, photoelectrons can return to ZnO NPs rapidly from Ag NWs for recombination due to the good Ohmic contact, which avoids the PPC effect effectively. The PPC effect usually appears because electrons have to cross barriers around grain boundaries prior to recombination, which increases the recovery time.2,8,12

(b) Schematic illustrations of carrier transfer process at the interface between Ag NWs and ZnO NPs and inside ZnO NPs. The electrons are represented by red dots, and holes are represented by blue dots. 
The electrode contact is quite important for the performance of detectors. Using Schottky contact has been believed to increase sensitivity and the response and recovery speeds, since the strong electric field at the reverse biased Schottky barrier area can separate the photogenerated excitons rapidly.35,36 The Ag and Al electrodes are usually used to study the Ohmic contact with ZnO,7,37,38 while an Au electrode is used for the Schottky contact.1,39 As a comparison with the Ag electrode used above, Fig. 5a and b show the IV curves of ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors with Al and Au electrodes under different light illumination, respectively. Al contact produces symmetrical and linear IV characteristics, while Au contact shows clear non-symmetry. Besides, the photocurrent of the Al contact is almost 10 times that of Au contact. These results demonstrate the intrinsic Ohmic contact for Al electrodes and Schottky contact for Au electrodes. Another parameter of UV photodetectors is responsivity (R), which is defined as (3)where α and β are fitting parameters of exponential functions.25,40Fig. 5c compares the responsivity of composite UV photodetectors versus light illumination using Ag, Al and Au electrodes, which can be fitted very well with eqn (3). The responsivity increases with a decrease in light illumination and shows a nonlinear relationship, similar to reports on other photodetectors.25,29 The fitting parameters for Ag and Al contacts are approximately equal, while they have a large difference compared with the Au contact, indicating intrinsically different contact types. The low responsivity of Au contact can be attributed to low photocurrents from the Schottky contact. However, the calculated on/off ratio at 1 V bias for the Au contact is 146, which is larger than that for the Al contact of 87. Besides, the response and recovery times are nearly the same for both Al and Au contacts under high light illumination (Fig. S6 and S7†). These results indicate that the Schottky contact has not obtained higher responsivity and faster response and recovery speeds than the Ohmic contact, which is different with previous reports.35,36,39 One reason is that our polycrystalline ZnO thin films have a much higher density of surface states at the contact interface compared with single ZnO NWs, which significantly modify the barrier for Schottky contact. The other reason may be that Au has diffused into Ag NWs embedded in ZnO NP thin films during the sputtering process due to a very thin layer of upper ZnO NPs, which reduced the effect of Schottky contacts. These results are partially supported by the microphotograph in Fig. S3b.† The wavelength-dependent responsivity was calculated from the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measured using a model 7-SCSpec II system and the expression R(λ) = 1240 × IPCE/λ. From Fig. 5d, we can obtain a UV to visible rejection ratio of 40, which intrinsically ensures the so-called “visible-blind” property of the UV photodetector. Compared with that of a ZnO photodiode detector reported elsewhere,41,42 this rejection ratio is not good enough. We think the IPCE measurements under high light power have a severe thermal effect, which produces a large photocurrent even under the visible spectrum. This is also in accordance with the results mentioned above, which means that the responsivity decreases with the increase of light illumination. In all, our ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite structure has greatly improved the UV photoresponse performance of polycrystalline ZnO thin films, and thus it reduces the performance dependence on electrode contact.

3. Conclusion
In summary, high-performance ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetectors have been fabricated using a solution-processed method. The large photosensitive area of 4 × 5 mm2, low operating voltage of 1 V and high visible transmittance of 75% can be achieved using simple and low-cost processing conditions, which suggests a potential in large area UV photodetective applications. Under high light illumination of 4.9 mW cm−2, the device shows a high photocurrent of 41.8 μA, a large on/off ratio of 2787, and short response and recovery times of 3.5 s, which is adequate for applications that do not require particularly high speeds. However, the device shows large detectivity of 6.8 × 1012 Jones and responsivity of 2.4 A W−1 under low light illumination of 10 μW cm−2, indicating the excellent weak light detection capability of composite UV photodetectors. Besides, the device also shows a good linear dynamic range of 64 dB, which is very close to that of InGaAs photodetectors. The obtained high performance can be explained by the fact that the Ag NW conductive network embedded in polycrystalline ZnO thin films plays a role in suppressing the recombination of photogeneration excitons and rapidly transferring photoelectrons in ZnO NPs. This will not only greatly improve the number of photoelectrons extracted, but also shorten the extraction time of polycrystalline thin films. We also find that both Schottky and Ohmic contacts at the electrode interface can obtain a high on/off ratio and short response and recovery times. It is an effective composite structure that reduces the performance dependence on electrode contact.
4. Experimental details
Fabrication of bottom ZnO layer
The bottom ZnO layer was prepared on a clean glass substrate by the conventional sol–gel spin-coating method.43 The zinc acetate precursor solution was spin-coated onto the glass substrate at 4000 rpm. Then the films were dried at 300 °C for 10 min to remove organic residuals. Next, the procedure from spin-coating to drying was repeated from one to four times in order to get different amounts of the bottom ZnO layer.
Fabrication of ZnO/Ag NW/ZnO composite UV photodetector
Ag NWs were synthesized using Xia's method.44 Ag NW ethanol ink (5 mg ml−1) was obtained by adding appropriate amounts of PVP to adjust the dispersity and viscosity. Then Ag NW ethanol ink was spin-coated onto the bottom ZnO layer prepared above at different spin speeds to get different Ag NW densities. Next, the films were treated at 200 °C for 20 min to improve conductivity. Finally, the 6 nm diameter ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized according to literature methods.45 Then the upper ZnO layer was prepared by spin-coating as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles onto the films prepared above. Then three kinds of metal electrodes were prepared onto the composite film surface to make different contacts. Ag, Al and Au electrodes with 4 mm spacing were sputtered through a shadow mask. The length and width of the three kinds of electrodes are 5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively.
Characterization
Surface morphologies with high magnification were taken with a FEI Quatan 250 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM), and low magnification morphologies with a magnified view field were performed on Olympus BX 51 Microscope System. TEM tests were performed on a JEOL1400 with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Optical transmittance data were acquired with a Jasco V-570 UV/Visible spectrophotometer. IV and time-dependent photoresponse measurements were recorded by a Keithley 2400 source meter. The samples were illuminated through a mercury arc lamp (Starsense, GGY-125). The light intensity was modulated by changing the distance between the light source and sample, and a standard silicon diode UV of 365 nm (Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, UV-A) was used to quantify UV irradiance.
