The subtle surface modification significantly improves the catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surface modified Ni nanoparticles show a low overpotential of only 88 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm−2, which is one of the most efficient HER catalysts based on metallic Ni reported so far. The results suggest that controlled pyrolysis of MOFs is an effective method to prepare highly efficient noble metal free HER catalysts.
Introduction
Hydrogen is a promising clean energy solution to replace fossil fuels. The true merit of hydrogen as a zero emission energy source can only be achieved if hydrogen can be obtained in a sustainable way. Water electrolysis is a well-known method to produce hydrogen, which has been regaining increasing interest in recent years.1–3 Hydrogen generation by water electrolysis can serve as a promising energy storage solution for the intermittent wind or solar electric power. By combining wind power or photovoltaics, electrolysers and hydrogen fuel cells, distributed electricity generation that is truly independent of grids can be achieved.4–7
Efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are required to promote the electricity-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Currently, noble metals, especially platinum, remain the most efficient HER catalysts, which exhibit both very low overpotential and very good stability. However, the low abundance and high expense of Pt limit its application in large-scale water electrolysis. Therefore, developing efficient noble-metal-free catalysts for HER is of critical importance to support the widespread electrochemical hydrogen production.
As a common low cost alternative to Pt in many catalytic reactions, Ni based electrodes are extensively used in current commercial alkaline electrolysers. Improving the efficiency of Ni based catalysts, therefore, may result in direct impact on the current alkaline electrolysis technology. Ni is inherently much less efficient for HER compared to Pt-based catalysts.8,9 To enhance the efficiency of Ni based HER catalysts, a large variety of Ni based alloys or intermetallic composites are studied, such as Ni–Mo,8,10 Ni–Cu,11 Ni–Cr,12 and Ni–Co.13,14 Ni compounds with non-metal elements, such as O or OH,15,16 P17,18 and S19–21, have also been reported to show improved HER performance. On the other hand, metallic Ni is generally considered much less active. Consequently, HER catalysts based on metallic Ni are much less studied in recent years.
Here, we report a highly efficient HER catalyst based on surface modified Ni nanoparticles derived from Ni-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Pyrolysis of the Ni-MOF, Ni2(bdc)2ted (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid; ted = triethylene-diamine), in NH3 results in Ni nanoparticles with surface nitridation together with a thin carbon layer coating. The surface modification significantly improves the HER performance. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of only 88 mV at a current density 20 mA cm−2 in, which is one of the most efficient HER catalysts based on metallic Ni reported so far.
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in preparing metal containing functional materials by pyrolysis of MOFs, which have shown promising application in electrical energy storage and electrocatalysis.22–25 MOFs are advantageous as precursors to derive functional materials due to the highly ordered spatial arrangement of metal cations with a well defined chemical environment. In most studies, pyrolysis is carried out in an inert atmosphere. Here, NH3 is introduced during the pyrolysis process, which is critical to yield the desired surface state for HER by removing the excessive carbon and assisting surface nitridation. The improved pyrolysis procedure will assist the development of efficient HER catalysts from MOFs, which is currently significantly underdeveloped26 compared to other applications of MOF derived materials.
Results and discussion
The Ni-MOF is synthesized by a solvothermal method following previous publications.27,28 Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, H2bdc and ted are dissolved in dimethylformamide and sealed in an autoclave and maintained at 130 °C for 24 h. The Ni-MOF precipitates as green fine crystals which can be easily separated by filtration. The Ni-MOF is well crystallized with a high specific surface area of 2085 m2 g−1. The size of the Ni-MOF crystals ranges from 0.2 to several micrometers (Fig. S1†). The Ni-MOF shows a layer-pillar structure. Each Ni atom is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from bdc and one nitrogen atom from ted (Fig. 1a).

The catalysts are prepared by pyrolysis of the Ni-MOF at 560 °C in different atmospheres for 1 h. The Ni-MOF completely decomposes above 500 °C in an inert atmosphere, as suggested by the thermal gravimetric analysis (Fig. S1d†). Table 1 summarizes the composition of the catalysts obtained in different pyrolysis atmospheres. All the samples are composed of Ni, C and N. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 1b) confirms that metallic Ni is the only crystalline phase in all the samples, indicating that most Ni is in the metallic state. A notable feature is that NH3 introduced during the pyrolysis significantly reduces the carbon content. The carbon content is more than 30 wt% for the Ni–Ar sample while it is only 1.22 wt% for the Ni–0.2NH3 sample. Increasing the NH3 partial pressure to 0.4 bar almost eliminates carbon.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the Ni–Ar sample is composed of Ni nanoparticles less than 10 nm in diameter homogeneously distributed in a continuous carbon matrix (Fig. 1c). The carbon matrix is largely amorphous, while graphitic layers can be observed near the Ni particles (Fig. 1d). Such a structure with metal nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix is commonly observed in the pyrolysis products of MOFs in an inert atmosphere.29–31
For catalysts obtained in NH3, a notable structural difference is the absence of the continuous carbon matrix. The Ni–0.2NH3 sample contains only very thin carbon layers (∼2 nm) coating the surface of the Ni particles (Fig. 1f), while the Ni–0.4NH3 sample shows almost no carbon coating (Fig. 1h). This is in agreement with the very low carbon content obtained by the elemental analysis (Table 1). Another difference is the slightly larger particle size of Ni. Both samples obtained in the NH3 atmosphere contain Ni particles of around 30–50 nm (Fig. 1e and g). Both samples have a low BET surface area of 18 m2 g−1 (Table 1), which gives Ni particles of an average diameter of 18 nm, in very good agreement with the TEM results.

Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of the catalysts. In the Ni 2p3/2 spectra, the peak at 852.7 ± 0.2 eV corresponding to metallic Ni is observed for all the samples, which is in agreement with the XRD and TEM results. Samples obtained in NH3 contain another peak at 856 eV corresponding to divalent Ni.32,33 In the N 1 s spectra, components corresponding to pyridinic (398.9 eV), pyrrolic (400.9 eV) and graphitic (402.8 eV) nitrogen22,32,34 can be identified for all the samples, which are commonly found in N-doped carbon.22,35,36 Samples obtained in NH3 contain another component with binding energy lower than 398 eV, which can be identified as electron-rich nitridic nitrogen.34 It is worth noting that higher NH3 partial pressure during pyrolysis results in higher relative abundance of both the divalent Ni and the nitridic N, which suggests that partial nitridation of the Ni particles occurs in these samples. Another indirect evidence for the partial nitridation of Ni is the extremely high N/C ratio in samples obtained in NH3 (Table 1). Considering the very low nitrogen content and the absence of the crystalline nickel nitride phase in XRD, the nitridation is likely to occur only on the surface of the Ni particles.
 Fig. 2  (a) Ni 2p3/2 and (b) N 1 s XPS spectra of MOF-derived catalysts. The shake-up peaks of Ni 2p3/2 have been subtracted for clarity. 
The HER performance of the catalysts is first evaluated by linear scanning voltammetry (LSV, Fig. 3a). The activity is compared using the overpotential at a certain current density j (ηj, j in mA cm−2). Notably, the Ni–0.2NH3 sample shows very high HER activity, indicated by the low overpotential (η10 = 61 mV and η20 = 88 mV). The HER performance, however, is very sensitive to the NH3 partial pressure during pyrolysis. The performance of the Ni–0.4NH3 sample is inferior (η20 = 112 mV). The Ni–Ar sample is rather inactive (η20 = 390 mV).
 Fig. 3  (a) Linear scanning voltammograms and (b) Tafel plots of the MOF-derived catalysts in 1 M KOH solution. 
These Ni-MOF derived catalysts also exhibit different HER mechanisms, which can be inferred from the Tafel plots (Fig. 3b). The Tafel slope for the catalysts derived in NH3 is in the range of 71–83 mV per decade, which suggests a mixed Volmer and Heyrovsky mechanism for HER, i.e. the HER rate is determined by both H2O discharge and desorption of H from the catalyst surface.14,37–39 For the Ni–Ar catalyst, the Tafel slope is much higher (147 mV per decade), suggesting that the HER is dominated by the Volmer mechanism, i.e. determined by the discharge of H2O.1,37,39
The most active catalyst Ni–0.2NH3 also shows very good stability. As shown in Fig. 4a, during a continuous water electrolysis test at a constant current of 20 mA cm−2, the overpotential only slightly increases from 91 mV to 103 mV in 12 h (Fig. 4a). The catalyst after electrolysis shows no apparent change in terms of the particle size and the morphology of the carbon layer (Fig. 4b), which can be attributed to the good protection of the surface carbon layer. The LSV profile is also unaffected after repeated cyclic voltammetry scans (Fig. S4†). The H2 evolved measured by chromatography shows excellent linear dependence with time during the constant current electrolysis (Fig. 4c). The moles of H2 equal half of the moles of electrons passing through the electrolysis cell within the measurement error, indicating near 100% Faraday efficiency throughout the continuous electrolysis test.

The contribution to the current from the Ni foam is less than 5% (Fig. S4†). (b) TEM image of the catalyst after continuous operation for 12 h. (c) The amount of H2 generated by electrolysis in the first and last 2 hours, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value assuming 100% Faraday efficiency (the straight line). 
Table S1† compares the performance of our Ni-MOF derived catalyst with several state of the art Ni based noble metal free HER catalysts. Metallic Ni (e.g. Ni particles obtained by chemical reduction) typically shows η10 > 300 mV.8,40 Most nickel based alloys and compounds reported in the literature have η20 > 100 mV.17,18,41 There are only very few Ni based noble metal free HER catalysts which exhibit η20 below 100 mV.8,16 The Ni–0.2NH3 catalyst, therefore, represents a significant improvement in the HER activity of Ni based HER catalysts. Considering the fact that this catalyst is not much different compared to ordinary Ni nanoparticles except the surface state, such improvement is even more intriguing.
The above results imply a remarkable promotion effect on the HER performance of Ni nanoparticles due to the surface modification effect. Indeed, the performance of the Ni-MOF derived HER catalysts is very sensitive to their surface state. Either large excess of carbon (Ni–Ar) or over attenuated carbon coating (Ni–0.4NH3) results in deterioration of the HER performance. Such sensitive dependence on the surface carbon coating is in agreement with a recent theoretical study by Deng et al.14 which suggested that thin graphene coating on Ni–Co nanoparticles can promote the HER activity by modulating the binding energy with the atomic H, while this promotion effect rapidly diminishes as the number of the graphene layers increases. In addition, surface nitridation of Ni is also beneficial for HER, as the Ni–0.4NH3 sample is far more active than metallic Ni particles with a similar size. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of surface nitridation of Ni on its HER activity has not been clearly addressed yet. An interesting issue is whether the surface nitridation and carbon coating have synergism in promoting HER, which needs to be clarified with further study.
The strong carbon removal effect of NH3 during the pyrolysis of the Ni-MOF Ni2(bdc)2(ted) is critical to obtain the desired surface state for HER. To understand this effect, comparative experiments are carried out. The role of the reactive H species is first studied. As shown in Table 1, the sample obtained by pyrolysis in H2 also contains a high carbon content (30.56 wt%). The TEM study also shows that the Ni–0.2H2 sample shows a very similar morphology to Ni–Ar, i.e. Ni particles embedded in a continuous carbon matrix (Fig. S3†). Therefore, the carbon removal effect is not due to the reactive H species. Another conclusion is that NH3 can only eliminate carbon before the organic ligands become fully carbonized. In another comparative experiment, the Ni–Ar sample is further treated in NH3 at 560 °C for 1 h. However, there is little structure change observed (Fig. S3†). The carbon content remains above 30 wt% (Table 1). Therefore, NH3 treatment barely shows any carbon removal effect for well carbonized materials. This is in agreement with previous results.38,42,43 It should be emphasized that the carbon removal effect and the subsequent surface state of Ni particles are also strongly associated with the ligand and the topology of the Ni-MOFs. Using other Ni-MOFs as the precursors is also possible, while the optimal conditions for the treatment may vary.
A possible carbon removal mechanism is that NH3 can cleave the C–C bonds in the organic ligands at high temperature, yielding smaller, more volatile molecules. In well carbonized materials, each carbon atom is connected to three or four neighbouring carbon atoms in the network. Formation of volatile small molecules becomes more difficult in this case. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in deriving functional materials by pyrolysis of MOFs. This unique carbon removal effect of NH3 during pyrolysis of MOFs has not been reported previously. We believe it will further advance the booming research field of MOF derived functional materials.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that controlled pyrolysis of the MOF structure Ni2(bdc)2(ted) in the NH3 atmosphere yields Ni nanoparticles with surface nitridation and a thin carbon layer coating. The surface modified Ni nanoparticles exhibit one of the highest activities for HER among the Ni based noble metal free HER catalysts reported so far. The remarkable promotion effect due to surface modification will assist the development of low cost HER catalysts to support the renewable hydrogen generation by water electrolysis.
