    , Accepted 24th January 2023First published on 26th January 2023AbstractSolar-driven H2O2 production is a promising approach for addressing both the energy and environmental crises. However, H2O2 photosynthesis is still restricted by insufficient electron–hole separation efficiency (ηsep) and sluggish semiconductor/solution interface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans). Here, we found that microdroplet photocatalysis showed an ultrahigh H2O2 evolution rate (20.6 mmol gcat−1 h−1) and performance enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding bulk phase counterpart. Microdroplet size effects and in situ Raman measurements on individual microdroplets demonstrated the faster photocatalytic reaction rates in smaller microdroplets and at microdroplet air–water interfaces (AWIs). Besides the sufficient O2 availability, vibrational Stark effect measurements and DFT calculations revealed that the ultra-strong electric field and partial solvation at microdroplet AWIs could improve ηsep and ηtrans, synergistically leading to significant H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration. As a proof-of-concept, the in situ applicability of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis was demonstrated. This study highlights the prospects of microdroplets for accelerating semiconductor photocatalysis.

Broader context
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is among the 100 topmost important chemicals in the world and has wide applications in industrial manufacture and environmental governance. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from O2 reduction is regarded as a cost-effective and sustainable approach for H2O2 supply in an in situ and continuous way. However, traditional H2O2 photosynthesis suffers from rapid recombination of photogenerated charges and sluggish O2 availability. Here, performing photocatalysis in microdroplets achieved highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis and significant acceleration compared to the conventional bulk phase counterpart. The improved O2 availability and enhanced charge separation are potential reasons, resulting from the extremely large specific surface area and ultrahigh interfacial electric field in microdroplets. This study opens up a feasible approach for highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.

Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an environmental-friendly and high-energy multifunctional chemical, is widely used in chemical synthesis, environmental governance, bleaching, disinfection, and one-compartment fuel cells.1–3 Currently, over 95% of H2O2 production is dependent on the multistep anthraquinone hydrogenation–oxidation process, which is energy-consuming and waste-intensive.4,5 As an alternative, direct H2O2 synthesis from H2 and O2 using Pd, Au-based catalysts is inevitably associated with high explosion risk, limiting the industrial application.6 Thus, it is desirable to develop an energy-saving pathway for efficient H2O2 synthesis.
Photocatalytic H2O2 production through O2 reduction with semiconductor catalysts has attracted intense interest due to its great potential toward a carbon-neutral society.7,8 H2O2 photosynthesis occurs mainly from a two-step single-electron O2 reduction (O2 + e− → O2˙−, O2˙− + e− + 2H+ → H2O2) or a direct one-step two-electron reduction of O2 (O2 + 2e− + 2H+ → H2O2).9 Most of the research works on H2O2 photosynthesis are trying to improve catalytic efficiency by modifying existing photocatalysts or developing new catalysts (e.g., metal oxides,4 organic polymers,10 metal–organic frameworks,11 and covalent organic framework12). However, photocatalytic H2O2 production in most photocatalysis systems is still at the quite low level, far from the viability for practical application,2,13–15 which might be mainly due to the following two interdependent aspects: limited electron–hole pair separation efficiency (ηsep) and sluggish semiconductor/solution interface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans).16,17
Although large efforts have been made to improve ηsep through various photocatalyst engineering like elemental doping, morphology tuning, and heterojunction construction,2,18–20 these modification strategies are not favorable for wide application due to the complex preparation processes.21 Moreover, the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is still a severe issue in photocatalysis reactions probably due to the lack of an auxiliary field force and a sufficient charge acceptor.22 The O2 molecule is one of the most essential building blocks for photocatalytic H2O2 production, and its availability could influence ηtrans and ηsep, further determining H2O2 formation. Unfortunately, H2O2 photosynthesis is generally carried out in a liquid–solid diphase system (dispersed photocatalyst in aqueous media), in which the low solubility (0.9 mM, 298 K, 1 atm pressure) and sluggish diffusivity (∼2.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) of O2 largely restrict the accessibility to photocatalyst surface active sites and restrain ηtrans for the 2e−-ORR.23–25 The continuous aeration of O2 could address this limitation to some extent, but it is costly and unsustainable.24 Therefore, developing a facile and cost-effective strategy to simultaneously improve O2 availability and electron–hole pair separation, namely ηtrans and ηsep, is highly desirable for photocatalytic H2O2 production.
We previously reported that O2 availability can be significantly improved in microdroplets due to the extremely large surface-area-to-volume ratio (S/V), leading to the dramatic accelerations of photochemical oxidation compared to the bulk phase counterpart.26 Unambiguously, performing H2O2 photosynthesis in microdroplets will break the bottleneck of O2-diffusion limitation and improve ηtrans. More importantly, microdroplet chemistry studies show that the microdroplet air–water interface (AWI) possesses unique physicochemical properties like an ultra-strong electric field,27,28 partial solvation effects,29 and reaction energy decrease,30,31 which are regarded as the potential reasons for significant chemical reaction acceleration and spontaneous occurrence in microdroplets.32–34 Theoretical simulations and experimental measurements suggest that the microdroplet interfacial electric field could reach 107 V m−1.35 As an external field, the microdroplet electric field can probably enhance ηsep and contribute to photocatalysis.21 With the above assumptions, microdroplets might be of great superiority in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Although the challenging spontaneous H2O2 formation with a concentration of several μM in tiny water droplets was reported,33,36,37 the H2O2 production via semiconductor photocatalysis in microdroplets has not been studied.
In this study, for the first time, the photocatalytic H2O2 production in microdroplets is investigated, with g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNS) as a representative photocatalyst because of their suitable band structure, high selectivity toward the 2e−-ORR and earth abundant constituents.38,39 An ink-jet printing system is employed to generate microdroplets with a specific diameter to facilitate the studies of microdroplet size effects and detailed mechanisms. The H2O2 production is accelerated by about two orders of magnitude in microdroplets compared to the corresponding bulk phase counterpart. The volcano-type variation trend is observed with varying the microdroplet diameter under an ambient air atmosphere. Besides the sufficient O2 availability, experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that ηsep and ηtrans are significantly improved in microdroplets owing to the ultrahigh electric field and partial solvation at the AWI, which synergistically result in highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis in microdroplets. As a proof-of-concept, the in situ application feasibility of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis is demonstrated.
Results and discussion
Characterization of photocatalysts and microdroplets
For studying photocatalytic H2O2 production in microdroplets, highly stable suspensions of photocatalysts (CNNS, TiO2, Au/TiO2, ZnO, and Au/ZnO) were prepared through an ultrasonication–precipitation method to minimize the settling of nanoparticles during photocatalysis. The cavitation phenomenon under ultrasonication did not generate detectable H2O2 as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). XRD patterns and TEM images (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†) showed the nanosheets and nanoparticles structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts and confirmed the Au nanoparticles deposition. UV-vis absorption spectra and nanocatalyst settling curves of photocatalyst suspensions exhibited that there was almost no nanopowder deposition within 3 h (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, the CNNS stably suspended in a droplet within the reaction time period (inset in Fig. S4f, ESI†) and there was insignificant variation of the as-prepared photocatalyst suspensions after at least one week without any disturbance (Fig. S5, ESI†). The low settling rate and excellent dispersion stability of the as-prepared photocatalyst suspensions might be due to the strong electrostatic exclusion between nanoparticles with extremely positive or negative zeta potentials under near neutral and alkaline conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†).40–42 The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and XPS valence band spectra of the as-prepared photocatalysts are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). For pristine g-C3N4, TiO2, and ZnO, the conduction band potentials were more negative than the redox potentials of O2/O2˙− and O2/H2O2 couples. In Au/TiO2 and Au/ZnO, the photogenerated electrons could transfer from the semiconductor conduction band to Au nanoparticles resulting from the Schottky junction, which would enhance separation of photoexcited charge carriers and be favorable to 2e−-ORR.43–45 Overall, the energy of photoelectrons is sufficient for reducing O2 to H2O2.
Microdroplets were generated on an as-prepared superhydrophobic quartz wafer (water contact angle, 148 ± 3°, inset in Fig. 1(b)) using a homemade pneumatic nebulizer (Fig. S8, ESI†) or an ink-jet printer (Fig. 1) under ambient air conditions; the former is used to compare the differences between bulk phase and microdroplets while the latter is applied for studying the effects of microdroplet size and mechanisms. The microdroplets generated from pneumatic sprayer were of varying diameter (Φ) mainly in the range of 100–500 μm (Fig. S9, ESI†). Microdroplets of the pre-designed specific size were obtained using an ink-jet printer by controlling the repeated times of printing (Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S10, ESI†). The microdroplet size was negligibly changed during photocatalysis (Fig. S11, ESI†) due to the high relative-humidity and room temperature control in the sealed reaction chamber (Fig. S8c, ESI†), which guaranteed the comparability between microdroplet and bulk phase reaction. After photocatalytic reaction, the microdroplets were gathered and quantificationally diluted using deionized water to determine H2O2 production.

Photocatalytic H2O2 production

Fig. 2(a) shows the H2O2 production in microdroplets was significantly higher than that of the bulk phase at various concentrations of triethanolamine (TEOA, an electron and proton donor). In the presence of 80 mM TEOA, H2O2 production in microdroplets was approximately 75-fold greater than that of the bulk phase (3.60 vs. 0.048 mM, 1 h-irradiation). Besides, in microdroplets, the H2O2 production was sharply increased with increasing TEOA concentration while it slowly raised in bulk phase system (enlarged version, Fig. S12a, ESI†). There would be a larger number of separated photoelectrons in the presence of higher concentrations of hole scavengers.46 Thus, the comparatively slow increase in H2O2 photosynthesis in the bulk phase relative to microdroplets might be caused by the insufficient O2 availability. There was hardly any H2O2 generation on g-C3N4 in both microdroplet and bulk phase under dark conditions or under light irradiation in the absence of TEOA, demonstrating that the measured H2O2 was produced from photocatalytic reaction with the assistance of an electron donor because the photogenerated holes cannot initiate the water oxidation half-reaction. The spontaneous H2O2 generation in microdroplets with a size less than 10 μm might not happen in this study because the diameters of the microdroplets we studied were larger than 50 μm.

(f) H2O2 production in the bulk phase under various reaction conditions. The error bars represent the standard deviation of at least three independent repeats. 
As the photoreaction proceeded, H2O2 production in bulk solution gradually leveled off after 2 h light irradiation with a steady-state concentration of ∼0.07 mM (0.27 mmol gcat−1 h−1, Fig. 2(b)). In stark contrast, photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in microdroplets did not reach saturation within 3 h (∼5.33 mM, 20.6 mmol gcat−1 h−1). A long-term photocatalysis test indicated that microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis would reach saturation after around 5 h (Fig. S13, ESI†), and the highest H2O2 concentration was about 6.23 mM. In general, photocatalytic H2O2 production is determined by the H2O2 formation rate (kf) and decomposition rate (kd) constant, which hypothetically follows zero- and first-order reaction kinetics as a function of H2O2 concentration ([H2O2]), respectively, as shown in eqn (1).47 [H2O2] = (kf/kd)(1 − exp(−kdt))(1)
According to the accurate fitting (Fig. S12b and c, ESI†), the microdroplet system exhibited significantly higher kf (0.062 vs. 0.0013 mM min−1) and lower kd (0.011 vs. 0.017 min−1) than that of the bulk phase. Thus, the time-dependent photocatalytic H2O2 production suggested that microdroplets can not only efficiently promote H2O2 formation but also suppress its decomposition.
Furthermore, the effects of light intensity on photocatalytic H2O2 production were explored. As displayed in Fig. 2(c) (enlarged version, Fig. S12d, ESI†), in the bulk phase system, the H2O2 production was firstly increased and then decreased with an intensification of the light intensity, probably because of the strengthened photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in the absence of sufficient electron acceptors, O2, under strong light irradiation.25 By contrast, in microdroplets, the H2O2 photosynthesis was continuously increased with enhancing light irradiation intensity. At a power density of 3.45 mW cm−2, the H2O2 production was ∼4.33 mM after 1 h, which is approximately 105.6-fold greater than that of the bulk phase (0.041 mM). More importantly, in microdroplets, the upward trend of H2O2 production changed from a concave curve to an almost linear relationship with increasing light intensity, probably because of the highly-sufficient O2 availability in microdroplets.48 Thus, all the above results clearly indicate that photocatalytic H2O2 production can be significantly improved in microdroplets compared to the bulk phase counterpart.
Improved O2 availability
Photocatalytic H2O2 production, in this study, is a two-step single-electron O2 reduction process in both bulk phase and microdroplet as verified by active species trapping experiments, with 10 mM p-benzoquinone and 10 mM AgNO3 as O2˙− and photoelectron scavenger, respectively (Fig. S14, ESI†).39 The electron spin resonance measurements (Fig. 2(d)) also confirmed O2˙− generation and the DMPO-O2˙− signal intensity was stronger in the presence of O2 bubbling. Besides, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), in bulk solution, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration obviously decreased from about 8.3 mg L−1 to near zero after 30 min photocatalysis, and then it slowly increased to ∼1.2 mg L−1 within another 30 min when the light was off. Thus, O2 availability is crucial to H2O2 photosynthesis but is largely restricted in bulk phase reaction due to its low solubility, sluggish diffusivity, and long-diffusion distance.23,47 H2O2 photosynthesis was then performed first under a N2 atmosphere and then in the air (Fig. 2(e)). There was hardly any H2O2 generation under a N2 environment, further supporting that H2O2 was produced from photocatalytic O2 reduction. After being exposed to air, microdroplets presented strikingly higher H2O2 production (2.19 mM) than that of the bulk phase reaction (0.03 mM). Therefore, microdroplets are absolutely beneficial to improve O2 availability, favoring to efficiently accept photoelectrons and enhance ηtrans for 2e−-ORR to H2O2.
However, as shown in Fig. 2(f), the photocatalytic H2O2 production in bulk solution with the assistance of magnetic stirring (0.21 mM) and continuous air/O2 bubbling (0.53 and 0.61 mM, respectively) were still much lower than that obtained in microdroplets (2.94 mM). The results implied that O2 availability improvement is not the only reason behind the significant H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration in microdroplets.
Microdroplet size effects and electric field in microdroplets
The effects of microdroplet size on photocatalytic H2O2 production were investigated using microdroplet arrays with uniform diameters generated by an ink-jet printer. As shown in Fig. 3(a), under an ambient air environment, H2O2 photosynthesis was first increased and then decreased with decreasing microdroplet size from around 600 to 150 μm. Of these, the ∼345 μm-diameter microdroplet presented the highest H2O2 production (2.35 mM). Based on the size-controlled experiments, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) and solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency (STH) were calculated. The microdroplet size dependent AQY and STH is shown Fig. S16 (ESI†), and it can be observed that AQY and STH were first increased and then decreased with decreasing microdroplet diameter. The highest AQY and STH obtained in ∼415 μm-diameter microdroplets were about 0.71% and 0.12%, respectively, which were higher than that of the bulk phase reaction (0.28% and 0.05%). The enhanced AQY and STH suggested that microdroplet photocatalysis could improve light utilization efficiency for renewable chemical energy generation. Under a high-purity O2 atmosphere, the H2O2 production constantly increased with decreasing microdroplet size, suggesting that H2O2 photosynthesis in a smaller microdroplet may be even higher than that in larger microdroplets in the presence of high-concentration O2. Unfortunately, at present, it is infeasible for us to investigate photocatalytic H2O2 production in microdroplets with a diameter of tens of micrometers, limited by the microdroplets generation, collection and further precise analyses, but which does not influence the observed H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration in microdroplets.

(f) Photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition efficiency (DEH2O2) in microdroplets in the absence of TEOA under an Ar environment (right y-axis. H2O2 initial concentration, 20 mM) and the H2O2 concentration changes (ΔC) in microdroplets of different sizes under an air atmosphere (left y-axis. H2O2 initial concentration, 20 mM; TEOA concentration, 50 mM). The error bars represent the standard deviation of at least three independent repeats. 
The different microdroplet size effects between ambient air and high-purity O2 conditions implied that O2 partial pressure in a reaction atmosphere is of great importance on H2O2 photosynthesis by influencing the O2 availability. To further confirm this, photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in ∼160 μm-diameter microdroplets was investigated under different reaction atmospheres (Ar, air, and O2), considering the competition for photoelectrons between H2O2 decomposition and O2 reduction. As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition was faster in an Ar environment than that in air. Meanwhile, the H2O2 concentration was slightly increased in the presence of high-purity O2. Thus, O2 availability under ambient air conditions was insufficient to efficiently compete with H2O2 reductive decomposition for photoelectrons in smaller microdroplets, leading to the decreased H2O2 photosynthesis in smaller microdroplets. The faster photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in smaller microdroplets further suggests that there would be some other potential reasons behind the dramatically accelerated H2O2 photosynthesis in microdroplets, besides the improved O2 accessibility.
Previous studies reported the existence of an ultra-strong electric field near the air–water interface of microdroplets, which might be formed by the separation of cation and anion at the AWI due to their different surface propensities.28,49,50 Accordingly, photocatalytic H2O2 production was performed with the addition of 20 mM NaBr, NaCl, and Na2SO4, because the different water surface propensities of these ions (Br− > Cl− > SO42− > Na+) can probably lead to the distinct electric double layer and interfacial electric field.49,51 As displayed in Fig. 3(b), in the bulk phase reaction, the presence of sodium salts slightly inhibited H2O2 photosynthesis, which might be due to the competitive adsorption of O2, TEOA, and ions for the surface active sites. On the contrary, in microdroplets, the H2O2 production is obviously improved following the order of NaBr > NaCl > Na2SO4, indicating the positive effects of the electric double layer on microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis, which might benefit from the ultrahigh interfacial electric field.
To experimentally verify the existence of the microdroplet electric field, the vibrational Stark effect of the cyanogroup (v(CN)) was measured using a micro-Raman spectrometer because the Raman shift of v(CN) is highly sensitive to an external electric field.52,53 As shown in Fig. 3(c), in a 48 μm-diameter microdroplet containing 2 M NaSCN, the Raman peak of v(CN) shifted from about 2065.5 cm−1 at the microdroplet interior to 2070.4 cm−1 at the AWI, confirming the existence of an interfacial electric field in microdroplets. According to the conversion equation,52 the electric field strength was about 8.2 × 106 V cm−1, almost consistent with a previous report.28 With the addition of Na2SO4 and NaCl (the influence of NaBr was not studied due to the strongly competitive adsorption of Br− and SCN− on the surface of Au nanoparticles), the differences in the Raman shift of v(CN) between the microdroplet interior and AWI were increased to about 18.3 and 20.7 cm−1, respectively, corresponding to the electric field strength of 50.7 × 106 and 57.5 × 106 V cm−1. The stronger the external electric field (e.g., microdroplet interfacial electric field), the higher the separation efficiency of the photoexcited charge carriers. Therefore, the introduction of sodium salts improved the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis in the microdroplets. More importantly, as displayed in Fig. 3(d), the Raman vibration of v(CN) gradually blue shifted from the microdroplet interior to the sub-surface and AWI, suggesting that the electric field also distributes in the microdroplet interior but the air–water interface presents an ultra-strong value. Thus, the micro-Raman measurements further confirmed the existence of an ultrahigh interfacial electric field in microdroplets.
The electric field strength and spatial distribution in microdroplets of varying diameters were further simulated based on a previous study.35 As shown in Fig. 3(e), the electric field was strengthened to be about 107 V m−1 with decreasing microdroplet size. Meanwhile, it could be observed that there are two inflection points in the curves (denoted as f1 and f2). Here, we define the center volume with a radial distance (RD) < RDf1 as the microdroplet interior, while the space with RD > RDf2 is regarded as the AWI region. Clearly, the volume proportion of the AWI region in a microdroplet is increased with decreasing microdroplet diameter (Fig. S18, ESI†), meaning that the ultra-strong interfacial electric field and other unique AWI physicochemical properties will cover a larger percentage of the microdroplet's volume in smaller microdroplets. In addition, the differences in averaged electric field strength between the microdroplet interior and AWI are narrowed with decreasing microdroplet size (Fig. 3(e)). Because the external and built-in electric field can promote the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges,21,54 the ultrahigh interfacial electric field in microdroplets will also enhance ηsep and promote H2O2 photosynthesis.
Then a series of experiments were carried out to indirectly verify the ηsep improvement in microdroplets. Photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in the absence of TEOA was conducted under an Ar atmosphere in microdroplet and bulk solution. As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition efficiency (DEH2O2) in microdroplets was evidently higher than that in bulk phase. Besides, Fig. 3(f) presented that the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition became more significant with decreasing microdroplet size, suggesting the enhancement on ηsep in smaller microdroplets with a stronger electric field. Moreover, the H2O2 concentration changes (ΔC) in microdroplets of varying diameters during photocatalysis were investigated, in the presence of 50 mM TEOA under an air environment. It can be found that (Fig. 3(f)), after 1 h light irradiation, the ΔC > 0 in microdroplets with a diameter greater than 300 μm while ΔC < 0 in smaller microdroplets. The results confirm that (i) the predominant photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in smaller microdroplets inhibited H2O2 photosynthesis under ambient air conditions due to the insufficient O2 accessibility, and (ii) a larger number photoexcited charges participate in the photocatalysis reaction with decreasing microdroplet size due to the strengthened microdroplet interfacial electric field, contributing to H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration.
Faster photocatalytic reaction at the AWI of microdroplets
At the microdroplet AWI, the dangling OH group, ‘water-poor’ characteristic, ordered molecular orientation, and disruption of hydrogen-bonding network will induce partial solvation effects, which can probably lower the reaction energy barrier.30,31,55 Herein, the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG) of photocatalytic 2e−-ORR near the AWI of microdroplets and in bulk solution were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.39,56 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the coordination structure of the *–OOH intermediate was different between the microdroplet air–water interface and bulk solution, probably due to the distinct solvation effects (partial solvation vs. full solvation). More importantly, the ΔG of *–OOH reduction to H2O2 in bulk solution is 1.25 eV while it is 0.97 eV at the AWI of microdroplets. In addition, Lopez et al. reported that the redox potential of the O2/O2˙− couple can decrease −0.32 eV at the AWI because O2˙− could quickly complete its first solvation shell near the interfacial region.57 Therefore, the photocatalytic 2e−-ORR processes are more thermodynamically favorable at the microdroplet AWI, which would further enhance ηtrans and accelerate H2O2 photosynthesis.

To experimentally demonstrate the roles of AWI ultra-strong electric field and partial solvation in microdroplet photocatalysis, in situ micro-Raman spectroscopy was employed to investigate the photocatalytic reaction rate at the AWI and in the microdroplet interior. Here we explored photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition under an Ar environment rather than photocatalytic H2O2 production for excluding the influences of O2 availability. The microdroplet diameter negligibly changed after 1 h irradiation due to the high relative humidity control (Fig. S20, ESI†). In Fig. 4(b), the comparatively weak Raman peak intensity of O–O stretching vibration of H2O2 recorded at the interfacial region is because the number of detected molecules decreased (illustrated in Fig. S21, ESI†).58 Photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition was faster in smaller microdroplets (Fig. 4(c)), consistent with the results obtained from microdroplet array experiments. Fig. 4(b) and (c) clearly show that the DEH2O2 was higher at the AWI than that in the microdroplet interior, confirming the photocatalytic reaction rates were faster at the microdroplet AWI probably due to the ultrahigh interfacial electric field and interfacial partial solvation. Meanwhile, the differences on DEH2O2 between the microdroplet air–water interface and interior region were narrowed with decreasing microdroplet size, which were because the percent of the AWI region and electric field strength in the microdroplet interior are increased with decreasing microdroplet size as discussed above. Overall, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d), the microdroplet with abundant AWI can significantly improve ηsep and ηtrans due to the sufficient O2 availability, ultra-strong electric field and interfacial partial solvation, synergistically leading to the highly-efficient H2O2 photosynthesis.
Universality and in situ applicability
The universality of H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration in microdroplets is evaluated using TiO2, Au/TiO2, ZnO, and Au/ZnO as photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 5(a), with the addition of 50 mM TEOA, all the H2O2 productions in microdroplets were significantly higher than that of the bulk phase, with enhancement factors of about 13.1, 241.7, 9.2, and 72.1 for TiO2, Au/TiO2, ZnO, and Au/ZnO, respectively. Besides, as displayed in Fig. S22 (ESI†), the H2O2 generation in bulk solution reached steady-state after about 2 h irradiation while, in microdroplets, the H2O2 evolution rate slowly declined as the reaction proceeded, indicating the H2O2 formation rate constants were evidently improved and the decomposition was suppressed in microdroplets compared to the bulk phase (Table S1, ESI†). In addition, as presented in Fig. S23 (ESI†), in pure water only Au/ZnO could produce 0.43 and 0.06 mM H2O2 in microdroplets and bulk solution after 2 h photocatalysis, respectively. Compared to the H2O2 production in the presence of TEOA, the H2O2 photosynthesis was distinctly improved in microdroplets while it was slightly enhanced in the bulk phase, which might be dominantly resulting from the extremely sufficient O2 accessibility. The sluggish four-electron water oxidation kinetics, low 2e−-ORR selectivity, and significant H2O2 photocatalytic decomposition synergistically hindered H2O2 photosynthesis in pure water on TiO2, Au/TiO2, and ZnO.

(c) In situ application of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis for methyl orange (MO) degradation by Fenton reaction. The error bars represent the standard deviation of at least three independent repeats. 
In microdroplets with sufficient O2 availability, the significantly higher H2O2 production on Au/TiO2 and Au/ZnO than that on pristine TiO2 and ZnO was because Au nanoparticles, excellent co-catalysts for 2e−-ORR,45 can improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and suppress H2O2 photocatalytic reductive decomposition (Fig. S24, ESI†). However, in the bulk phase system with inadequate O2 accessibility, the Au nanoparticles deposition slightly improved or even suppressed H2O2 photosynthesis, probably due to the predominant photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition (Fig. S25, ESI†). The different enhancement factors obtained on the four photocatalysts might be due to the different O2 reduction kinetics and response capability to the microdroplet electric field. In detail, the sluggish O2 reduction kinetics and significant H2O2 decomposition on TiO2 and ZnO still determines H2O2 production.45,59 By contrast, the presence of Au nanoparticles can significantly improve the two-electron O2 reduction selectivity.60 Therefore, in the presence of highly-sufficient O2 availability, Au/TiO2 and Au/ZnO could achieve more pronounced enhancement on H2O2 photosynthesis compared to the pristine TiO2 and ZnO, as verified by the dozens of times increase in H2O2 formation rate constant. On the other hand, the different semiconductor photocatalyst might show a different response capability to the external electric field. Owing to the formation of a metal–semiconductor heterojunction, Au/TiO2 and Au/ZnO can probably realize a stronger response to the microdroplet electric field, leading to more significant accelerations.61 More importantly, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and Table S2 (ESI†), the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rates in microdroplets are greatly superior to almost all of the previous studies focusing on the complicated photocatalysts engineering, distinctly uncovering that microdroplets are of great promise for highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.
It has been shown that microdroplet photocatalysis can produce ultrahigh concentrations of H2O2, which might be a promising in situ deconcentrated H2O2 supply source. Here, as a proof-of-concept, methyl orange (MO) degradation by the Fenton process was investigated to demonstrate the feasibility, using homemade H2O2 as oxidant. After 2 h light irradiation (Fig. 5(c)), the H2O2 production in microdroplets (denoted as m-H2O2) was about 5.56 and 4.25 mM with CNNS and Au/ZnO as the photocatalyst, respectively, while the corresponding H2O2 concentration was only about 0.02 and 0.03 mM in bulk solution (named b-H2O2). The MO removal efficiency was about 47.3% and 30.6% using the diluted m-H2O2, which was about 54.5- and 31.2-fold higher than that obtained using the pristine b-H2O2 (0.87% and 0.97%, respectively), confirming the in situ applicability of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis. To purify the generated H2O2, solid photocatalysts could be recycled from aqueous solution through centrifugation or filtration. Regarding the separation of the hole scavenger, it could be dependent on the extraction processes.62
The overall stability of the microdroplet photocatalysis system was then investigated. As shown in Fig. S26a and b (ESI†), the diameters of microdroplets were negligibly decreased with time increasing even after 6 h light irradiation, benefiting from the controls on high relative humidity and room temperature. Meanwhile, the water contact angle of the superhydrophobic substrate remained after long-term photocatalysis and could be reused after cleaning by immersing into DI water for a while (about 10 s). Moreover, the photocatalysts also showed high stability on catalytic activity, as supported by the insignificantly changed H2O2 production with increasing cycles (Fig. S27, ESI†). Therefore, the developed microdroplet photocatalysis system is of distinguishable stability.
For further scale-up and industrial applications of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis, the continuous gas-spray based on atomization of bulk solution containing photocatalysts might be an alternative.63 For this purpose, the humified high-velocity air or O2 can be used to atomize photocatalyst suspension on the top of a bulk reactor to generate microdroplets, and light irradiation can be supplied from the periphery around the reactor. The collected suspension can undergo further photocatalytic reactions or can be directly used to provide H2O2 after filtration depending on the requirements. The potential large-scale H2O2 production through highly-efficient microdroplet photocatalysis can be promising for deconcentrated wastewater treatment and disinfection in rural and remote areas with abundant available sunlight irradiation and low rainfall, which will promote microdroplet photocatalysis from laboratory benchtops to the industry.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis in microdroplets. Microdroplet photocatalysis showed an ultrahigh H2O2 evolution rate, which is enhanced by about two orders of magnitude compared to that of the bulk phase counterpart. Besides the improved O2 availability, the experimental and theoretical studies suggest that ultra-strong electric field and partial solvation at the AWI are the vital reasons for the improvements in ηsep and ηtrans, leading to the significant H2O2 photosynthesis acceleration. The in situ application feasibility of microdroplet H2O2 photosynthesis was demonstrated as well. This study opens up an avenue to improve H2O2 photosynthesis in a very simple way, favoring the applications in energy, environment and green synthesis.
Methods
Microdroplet generation
For microdroplet generation, the mother liquor was prepared by adding a certain amount of TEOA into 10 mL of the as-prepared photocatalyst suspension. For investigating the microdroplet size effects and detailed mechanisms on H2O2 photosynthesis, an ink-jet printer (shown in Fig. 1, jetlab®II, MicroFab) was employed. A piezoelectric nozzle with a diameter of 40 μm was used. A succession of sine pulses was used for inkjet printing with a voltage of 28 V and a period time of 90 μs. The droplet ejection frequency was 300 Hz and the distance between nozzle and hydrophobic quartz wafer was 1.5 mm. Under operation with these parameters, the volume of an individual droplet generated by once printing is about 71.8 pL (Φ = 51.6 μm). The printing process is shown in Movie S1 (ESI†) and other details on the ink-jet printing are described in the ESI.† Meanwhile, a homemade pneumatic nebulizer was applied to generate a large number of microdroplets with air as the nebulizing gas under constant gas pressure, and the microdroplets generation method is of good repeatability with size mainly ranging from 100 to 500 μm (Fig. S9, ESI†). The microdroplets were collected on an as-prepared superhydrophobic quartz wafer placed ∼3 cm away from the nebulizer outlet.
Photocatalytic reaction
The microdroplet photocatalysis was performed through placing the generated microdroplets in an airtight custom-designed environmental chamber under high relative humidity conditions (Fig. S8c, ESI†). After the pre-designed irradiation time, the microdroplets were gathered and quantificationally diluted using DI water for H2O2 determination. Unless otherwise stated, the bulk phase photocatalysis was carried out in a quartz cuvette using 2 mL suspension with a thickness of ∼2 cm without magnetic stirring and air/O2 purge. The decreased optical path in microdroplets is not a considerable reason behind photocatalysis acceleration, as indicated by the insignificant difference on photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition performed in bulk solution with different thickness under an Ar atmosphere (Fig. S28, ESI†). The reaction temperature was maintained at room temperature by using an electric fan and circulating condensed water around the reaction chamber. Without specific notification, a 365 nm UV lamp with a power density of 2.32 mW cm−2 was used as the light irradiation source.
The bulk phase photocatalysis under an Ar, O2, or N2 atmosphere was carried out by continuously bubbling the high-purity Ar, O2, or N2 into the suspension during the photocatalytic reaction. Regarding the microdroplet system, the reaction atmosphere was controlled by purging the humified high-purity Ar, O2, or N2 into the reaction chamber for 15 min prior to the experiments. The high-humidity gas flow (RH, about 90%) was obtained by passing the fresh gas through a bottle containing 80 vol% deionized water.
In situ Raman measurements
The monitor of photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition in an individual microdroplet was performed using a homemade flow cell by in situ micro-Raman measurement (Fig. S29, ESI†). The g-C3N4 nanosheet suspension containing 400 mM commercial H2O2 was sprayed to generate microdroplets on a superhydrophobic quartz plate, which was then placed into the flow-type reactor. It is infeasible for us to perform in situ Raman using experimentally produced H2O2 and to in situ monitor the photocatalytic H2O2 formation processes because the H2O2 concentration generated in the microdroplets did not satisfy the detection limit of the Raman spectrometer (50 mM). The high-humidity Ar was purged continuously with a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 for eliminating the interference of O2 reduction and inhibiting water evaporation. To distinguish the photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition rate at the microdroplet interior and near the AWI, the H2O2 concentration in the interior and near interfacial region was detected before and after 365 nm UV light irradiation.
The Raman spectra assigned to the O–O vibrational of H2O2 were recorded with a XploRA Plus confocal Raman spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, HORIBA Gr, France) coupled with a ×10 Olympus microscope objective. An external-cavity diode laser (532 nm) was used for excitation. The Raman signal ranging from 400–4200 cm−1 was collected using a multichannel EMCCD device, with 2 spectrum accumulations at a 10 s acquisition time per spectrum. The Raman spectra analyses including baseline correction by a polynomial equation and peaks fitting with Gauss–Lorenz function were conducted using LabSpec 6 software. The calibration curve was established using a microdroplet containing H2O2 with a gradient concentration (Fig. S30, ESI†). The H2O2 photocatalytic decomposition efficiency (DEH2O2) was obtained from eqn (2), where Ct and C0 represent the H2O2 concentration after and before light irradiation, respectively. DEH2O2 = (1 − Ct/C0) × 100%(2)

Broader context
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is among the 100 topmost important chemicals in the world and has wide applications in industrial manufacture and environmental governance. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from O2 reduction is regarded as a cost-effective and sustainable approach for H2O2 supply in an in situ and continuous way. However, traditional H2O2 photosynthesis suffers from rapid recombination of photogenerated charges and sluggish O2 availability. Here, performing photocatalysis in microdroplets achieved highly efficient H2O2 photosynthesis and significant acceleration compared to the conventional bulk phase counterpart. The improved O2 availability and enhanced charge separation are potential reasons, resulting from the extremely large specific surface area and ultrahigh interfacial electric field in microdroplets. This study opens up a feasible approach for highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.
