    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 31st May 2016AbstractFor the first time, room temperature heating free growth and crystallization of perovskite films in ambient air without the use of thermal annealing is reported. Highly efficient perovskite nanorod-based solar cells were made using ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods/PC60BM/rhodamine/Ag. All the layers except PEDOT:PSS were processed at room temperature thereby eliminating the need for thermal treatment. Perovskite films were spin coated inside a N2 filled glovebox and immediately were taken outside in air having 40% relative humidity (RH). Exposure to humid air was observed to promote the crystallization process in perovskite films even at room temperature. Perovskite films kept for 5 hours in ambient air showed nanorod-like morphology having high crystallinity, with devices exhibiting the highest PCE of 16.83%, which is much higher than the PCE of 11.94% for traditional thermally annealed perovskite film based devices. It was concluded that moisture plays an important role in room temperature crystallization of pure perovskite nanorods, showing improved optical and charge transport properties, which resulted in high performance solar cells.
1. Introduction
Perovskite based solar cells have been of great interest because of their high power conversion efficiency compared to previous generation solar cells such as CZTS,1 DSSCs,2,3 small molecule4 and polymer solar cells.5–9 Methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) based organic–inorganic planar perovskite solar cells have seen a rapid increase in efficiency with low cost simple solution processing fabrication.10 Single halide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite has been widely studied in both planar11 and mesoporous device structures.12–17 With ongoing development in perovskite based solar cells, several perovskite film formation techniques have been reported such as single-step spin coating of a mixed precursor solution,18 single-step spin coating with additives or additional solvents,19–21 sequential deposition method,22 two-step spin-coating method,23 vapor-assisted solution process approach,24 evaporation of precursor materials25 and spray-deposition.26 Most of these different perovskite growth methods have shown device power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than 10%, with one of the methods exhibiting a record efficiency of 20.1%.27 However among the above methods, one-step deposition of perovskite films in planar architecture is desired because of its low temperature processing, smooth morphology and simplicity in device fabrication.
To further simplify the fabrication of perovskite-based planar devices by one-step deposition and improve perovskite film morphology, there is a need for room temperature slow crystallization of the pure perovskite phase in ambient atmosphere. This achievement would not only simplify the perovskite crystallization, but also open avenues to realize perovskite films on flexible substrates using low temperature, ambient air processing. Until now, there have been few reports on processing of perovskite films at room temperature and ambient air. A report on a spin coated bilayer of PbI2/CH3NH3I demonstrated that the complete conversion to the perovskite phase was achieved by keeping the film in ambient air for 60 min followed by thermal annealing, which led to an increase in perovskite crystallinity.28 Another report on room temperature processing of perovskite was reported where a small amount of NH4Cl was added to the precursor solution (CH3NH3I, PbI2 in dimethylformamide (DMF)), which was then spin coated at room temperature with the perovskite film being crystallized during spinning resulting in a dark brown color perovskite film, which showed a device efficiency of 9.32%.29 Further room temperature processing of perovskite was also achieved using a solvent–solvent extraction technique, where a spin coated MAPbI3 film was immersed immediately in diethyl ether solvent at room temperature, which in turn converts the MAPbI3 thin film into perovskite in 2 min.30 All these room temperature processing techniques for perovskite involve partial annealing of films, addition of an extra dopant, or washing in a solvent.
One of the challenges for ambient air processing of organic–inorganic perovskite films is their degradation in air due to moisture. Perovskite films are prone to degradation from moisture present in the atmosphere, requiring processing and crystallization in a N2 filled glovebox. The most common procedure followed for crystallization of perovskite films is annealing on top of a hot plate in an inert atmosphere. This method of crystallization of perovskite not only increases the complexity of fabrication, but also makes it difficult to control perovskite film crystallinity and morphology at the nanoscale level. As reported previously, the perovskite phase is formed by inter-diffusion of precursor elements (CH3NH3I and PbI2) whose rate of diffusion controls the rate of perovskite crystallization.23 Annealing the deposited perovskite film will lead to rapid diffusion of precursors leaving a smaller time window to control the growth of perovskite crystals, thus severely limiting control over film morphology. Improvement in device performance depends largely on the quality of perovskite films;31 therefore a film with high perovskite phase crystallinity and large pinhole free perovskite crystals is desired for efficient charge transport with reduced recombination. Retarding the rate of crystallization of spin coated perovskite films will assist in slow inter-diffusion of precursor elements leading to improved crystallinity and large, continuous, defect-free perovskite morphology.
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the formation of perovskite nanorods32 for photovoltaics. In this report, we demonstrate room temperature, ambient air processed perovskite films without the use of post-deposition annealing for solar cell applications. This is the first study on the time-dependent growth and crystallization of perovskite films in ambient air at room temperature. Perovskite films were slowly crystallized by keeping them at room temperature in ambient air having 40% RH for different periods of time varying from 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 8 h to 10 h. Perovskite films crystallized for 5 hours in ambient air showed nanorod morphology having high crystallinity, with devices exhibiting a PCE of 16.83%, which is much higher than the PCE of 11.94% for traditional thermally annealed perovskite film-based devices.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1 Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was purchased from Dyesol. PbI2 (99%) was obtained from Acros organics. Anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (>99.9%) and γ-butyrolactone (>99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Clevios™ P VP AI 4083 PEDOT:PSS was ordered from Heraeus. PC60BM and rhodamine were purchased from Nano-C and Sigma Aldrich. All the materials were used as received.
2.2 Device fabrication
The planar device structure adopted for fabricating perovskite solar cells consists of bottom electrode indium tin oxide (ITO), PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer (HTL), light absorbing perovskite layer, PC60BM as an electron transport layer (ETL), rhodamine as a thin interfacial layer and top metal electrode silver (Ag).33 Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were first cleaned by sonicating the substrates in detergent water, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min each. Cleaned ITO substrates were then plasma cleaned in the presence of oxygen for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 4500 rpm for 90 s, followed by annealing in air at 135 °C for 5 min. The samples were then transferred inside a N2 filled glovebox for coating with the perovskite layer. A mixed solution of 581 mg of PbI2 (1.26 M) and 209 mg of CH3NH3I (1.3 M) mixed overnight in 1 ml of γ-butyrolactone:DMSO in 7:3 volume ratio was spin coated at 750 rpm for 20 s and 4000 rpm for 60 s, with 160 μl toluene dripped at the middle of total spinning time (40 s). The films were then crystallized by either thermal annealing (100 °C, 20 min) or keeping the films in ambient air for different periods of time (1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 8 h, and 10 h). Fig. 1 shows the perovskite spin coating steps with toluene dripping and its post-crystallization in ambient air at room temperature leading to nanorod features. PC60BM (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was then spin coated on top of the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s and then kept for 15 min inside the glovebox for solvent drying at ambient temperature. Rhodamine (0.5 mg ml−1 in isopropyl alcohol) was then spin coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s on top of the PC60BM layer. The Ag (100 nm) electrode was then deposited using thermal evaporation in a high vacuum of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The solar cell active area was 0.16 cm2, as defined by the shadow mask.

2.3 Characterization
Perovskite films were characterized for their absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions using an Agilent UV-visible spectrophotometer G1103A. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of perovskite films were recorded with a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer (2.2 kW Cu-Kα (1.54 Å) radiation). Tapping mode topography and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were obtained using an Agilent 5500 scanning probe microscope (SPM) equipped with a MAC III controller. The measurements were performed in air having the same humidity levels as those maintained for the air growth perovskite films. The same perovskite films at different time intervals were used for the measurement where we saw time dependent growth up to 5 h and then degradation was seen to start for a longer time. Silicon tips having Cr/Pt coating (Budget Sensors, Multi 75E-G) with a resonant frequency of ∼75 kHz and force constant of 3 N m−1 were used for measuring topography and KPFM images. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured in forward (0–1 V, 0.01 V interval, 0.01 s for each interval) and reverse bias (1–0 V, 0.01 V interval, 0.01 s for each interval) using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer, keeping perovskite solar cells under illumination (xenon arc lamp with air mass (AM) 1.5 filter, Newport) with a light intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). An NREL calibrated photodetector was used to calibrate the distance between the xenon arc lamp and the sample to ensure 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. Incident photon current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using a xenon lamp (Newport) attached to a monochromator (Newport). Two focusing lenses were used to focus the monochromatic light to the active area of the solar cell. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) calibrated photodiodes were used as the reference for IPCE measurements.
3. Results and analysis

Fig. 2a shows the schematic of the planar device structure with the layer stack ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite nanorods/PC60BM/rhodamine/Ag. In order to determine the light absorption in the solar spectrum, UV-visible absorption spectra of the perovskite films crystallized in air at room temperature for different periods of time and a control sample that was crystallized by traditional thermal annealing inside a N2 filled glovebox were measured. Absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) of perovskite films at different periods (1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 h) of crystallization in air at room temperature showed increased absorption intensity with respect to the increase in perovskite crystallization up to 5 h, followed by the decrease in absorption intensity beyond 5 h and in the control sample. In the initial hours (1 h and 3 h) of crystallization, the perovskite films showed narrow and lower intensity absorption, which could be attributed to the presence of an intermediate phase (MAI–PbI2–DMSO).20 At this stage, the film has not been fully crystallized to the perovskite phase and consists of a mixed intermediate phase and perovskite phase. As the time of perovskite crystallization in air increases, the absorption intensity increases, indicating time-dependent crystallization of the perovskite phase. The maximum absorption intensity of perovskite nanorod films was obtained for 5 h crystallization in air, showing an optical bandgap of ca. 1.5 eV. The perovskite film crystallized for 8 h in air exhibited an absorption spectrum close to the perovskite nanorod film crystallized for 5 h. However, the XRD results show a small PbI2 peak, and this indicates decomposition of the perovskite phase, which will be discussed below. The absorption intensity decreased for perovskite films crystallized for 10 h in ambient air at room temperature, which could be attributed to further decomposition of the single halide perovskite film from moisture present in air. In order to compare with the control sample, the perovskite film crystallized by thermal annealing in a N2 filled glovebox showed lower absorption than the 5 h air crystallized film, suggesting improved perovskite nanorod crystallinity in the 5 h air crystallized film. The deposited film was transparent initially and turned yellowish brown after being kept in ambient air at room temperature for one hour. The film color turned darker when kept for 3 h and was fully darkened at the end of 5 h, suggesting complete crystallization of the perovskite film.

To understand the growth of the perovskite phase by slow crystallization in air at room temperature, we performed XRD studies. XRD scans (Fig. 3a) were recorded for all the films. Fig. 3b shows the peak intensity of (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite film crystallized for different times (1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 h) and control sample crystallized by thermal annealing inside N2 filled glovebox. Spin coated films in the initial one hour of air crystallization show weak intensity for the pure perovskite phase peaks occurring at 14° (110) and 28° (220) degrees, but exhibit intense peaks for the intermediate phase at 6.5, 7.15 and 9.1 degrees, respectively, suggesting crystalline nature of the intermediate phase in the initial one hour of perovskite crystallization. However, the crystal structure of peaks corresponding to the intermediate phase is still not clearly understood; these peak positions have been observed in previous studies and were related to the formation of an intermediate phase, namely MAI–PbI2–DMSO.20 As we did not observe any peaks corresponding to the PbI2 phase (∼12.6°), we conclude that the deposited perovskite films consist mainly of crystalline intermediate phases (formed by the reaction between PbI2, DMSO and CH3NH3I species), which slowly transition to the perovskite phase in ambient air by removal of DMSO species at room temperature. The crystallization process of perovskite was further monitored by keeping the perovskite film for 3 h, 5 h, 8 h, and 10 h in ambient air at room temperature. Perovskite films exposed for 3 h show crystallization in air as confirmed by the appearance of intense peaks at 14.1° (110), 28.4° (220) and a small peak at 31.8° (310), with the intermediate phase peaks significantly suppressed, indicating the escape of DMSO from the intermediate phase, which led to an increase in perovskite crystallization.
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD of perovskite films crystallized in air at room temperature for different times (1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 h) and the control sample crystallized by thermal annealing; and (b) peak intensity of (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite film crystallized for different times (1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 h) and control sample crystallized by thermal annealing inside a N2 filled glovebox. 
The changes in XRD patterns observed by increasing crystallization time were also reflected in the visual color of the film (from light brown at 1 h to further darkening at 3 h and so on). On further keeping the film for 5 h in air, the peaks of the intermediate phase at a low angle (5–10°) completely disappear, and the intensity of perovskite phase peaks including (110), (220) and (310) increases, suggesting enhancement in the crystalline fraction with increasing air exposure time by complete conversion of the crystalline intermediate phase to perovskite nanorods (Fig. 5c). However, there was a very slight presence of the PbI2 phase peak at 12.6° for the 5 h air crystallized perovskite film, which indicates the slow start of decomposition of the perovskite phase after complete conversion to the perovskite phase in approximately 5 h in air. It was observed from the XRD patterns of 1, 3 and 5 h air crystallized films that the intensity of (110) and (220) and (310) peaks increased significantly in the first 5 h, suggesting orientation of grain growth in all three planes. These perovskite phase peaks correspond to the tetragonal I4cm crystal structure for highly crystalline single halide perovskite.34,35 The (110)/(220) peak intensity ratio increased in the first 5 hours, suggesting preferential grain growth orientation in the (110) plane. Grain growth is determined by their surface and interface energy, which guides the grain growth orientation (lower surface energy planes determine grain orientation).36 Since CH3NH3PbI3 has a tetragonal structure that is less symmetric as compared to its cubic counterpart, there will be a difference in surface energies of different planes, which could be a reason for the higher intensity of the (110) peak. On further exposure of perovskite films in ambient air for 8 h and 10 h durations, a new characteristic peak of PbI2 at 12.6° appeared with a concomitant decrease in the intensity of major perovskite phase peaks at (110) and (220). This suggests that once the crystallization to the perovskite phase is completed in 5 h, the perovskite film starts decomposing from continued exposure to moisture in air. The appearance of significant PbI2 peaks in 8 h and 10 h crystallized films also confirms that there is significantly no unreacted PbI2 up to 5 h, and the presence of PbI2 beyond 5 h air crystallization is attributed to decomposition of perovskite from moisture in air.
After carefully investigating the crystallization process of perovskite films in ambient air in comparison with the control sample obtained from thermal annealing in an inert atmosphere, one question that still remains to be answered is moisture's role in complete crystallization of single halide perovskite in ambient air. In order to find the role of moisture in perovskite crystallization, we conducted an experiment where we crystallized the spin coated perovskite film in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres with very little moisture for the optimized duration of 5 h. Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the presence of an intermediate phase between 5 and 10 degree in the XRD spectra at the end of 5 h crystallization in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, suggesting no role of oxygen or nitrogen in perovskite crystallization. It thus proves that moisture in air assists perovskite crystallization. Crystallization of the perovskite phase is assisted by interdiffusion of precursor elements in the deposited film. In the case of crystallization by thermal annealing, the solvent species (DMSO) from the intermediate phase is quickly removed, allowing little time for interdiffusion of PbI2 and CH3NH3I, thus restricting the long-range crystalline order in the film, which reduces the overall crystallinity. During slow crystallization of the perovskite film in ambient air, our study demonstrates that there is sufficient time for interdiffusion of precursor elements to react and form crystalline perovskite. The slow perovskite crystallization reaction in ambient air is assisted by the presence of airborne moisture, leading to improved crystallinity. The DMSO intermediate phase as observed in our XRD spectrum and also described in the literature19,20 was converted to the crystalline perovskite phase by thermal annealing at 100 °C (similar findings were observed in our annealed perovskite film), but in our study we observed that DMSO based intermediate phase conversion happens slowly at room temperature in ambient air. This leads us to the conclusion that moisture in air plays a role in removing the DMSO phase at room temperature. Recently, there have been reports on the formation of water-based intermediate phases such as colorless monohydrate ((CH3NH3)PbI3·H2O) and light yellow di-hydrate ((CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O) of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites.28,35,37–42 It was reported that perovskite forms a water-based colorless monohydrate intermediate phase, which crystallizes quickly to crystalline perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) by losing water at room temperature. Apart from monohydrate intermediate formation, it is also well known that DMSO is highly miscible with water. Based on these facts, we hypothesize that DMSO from an intermediate phase (MAI–PbI2–DMSO) escapes by either solubilizing in water from atmospheric moisture or the water lost from the monohydrate intermediate at room temperature. Room temperature crystallization in air involves removal of the DMSO-based intermediate phase by solubilization of DMSO in atmospheric moisture. Previous reports showed that PbI2 exists in the form of [PbI6]4− octahedral layers.20 CH3NH3I and DMSO constituents are intercalated between these octahedral layers forming a MAI–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase.19,20 The DMSO escapes from the intermediate complex by solubilizing in water obtained from atmospheric moisture, leading to immediate crystallization to a pure perovskite phase, as shown from the schematic in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows the schematic of the crystallization of perovskite from small elongated features (1 h in air) to large perovskite nanorods at the end of 5 h crystallization in ambient air. This will be confirmed by the AFM measurements discussed below.
 Fig. 4  Schematic showing (a) release of DMSO from the layered PbI2 octahedral structure to crystallize in the perovskite nanorod film and (b) change in perovskite morphology with varying crystallization time in air (1, 3 and 5 h). 
In order to determine perovskite interfacial morphology and surface potential of the film, we performed topography and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) imaging measurements. Fig. 5a–f show topography and the corresponding KPFM images in Fig. 5g–l of the perovskite films crystallized by keeping the deposited film for 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 h in ambient air at room temperature and the control sample crystallized by thermal annealing inside a glovebox. Topography and KPFM images of the films were recorded simultaneously. As seen from the topography images, the perovskite films in the initial one hour are comprised of dense small grains of perovskite with short elongated features. As time goes on, small features expand into more visible elongated shapes. At 5 h of air exposure, large perovskite nanorod features are formed. The nanorod features formed in 5 h air exposure were randomly aligned on the surface of the films with varying dimension (length × diameter). The morphological features in 8 and 10 h films are disordered, which could be attributed to decomposition of crystalline perovskite nanorods from moisture in air. This decomposition of pure perovskite nanorod phase crystals is also reflected in XRD peaks (Fig. 3a) of 8 and 10 h samples, where the intensity of perovskite phase peaks at 14° and 28° is reduced and a small peak at 12.65° appears indicating the presence of PbI2. Root mean square roughness of the films increased for 5 h air crystallized samples (Fig. 5c) in comparison to 1 h samples (Fig. 5a). This could be attributed to volume expansion in the 5 h air crystallized film. The 5 h air crystallized films show nanorod shapes with an average length of 811 nm and average diameter of 210 nm, whereas thermally annealed films exhibit a particle shape with an average particle size of 103 nm. Therefore, the ambient air crystallized films formed nanorods with an aspect ratio of ∼3.8. The dimensions of perovskite features were calculated by averaging 20 particles obtained from the topography image. The morphology of the perovskite film crystallized in air for several hours and control sample was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The morphology evolution as seen from SEM images is in good agreement with topography images shown in Fig. 5a–f.

KPFM is a method where a conductive tip is used as a Kelvin probe to measure surface potential or contact potential difference (CPD) in non-contact mode. The surface potential variation depends on the material phase present in the film. In our study, we investigated the variation in surface potential across the film, which varied for the perovskite intermediate phase, perovskite grain, grain boundaries and for the presence of the PbI2 phase which appears after decomposition of perovskite. During the crystallization process of perovskite and its following decomposition, various material phases appear which will have different surface potentials in the film leading to different magnitudes of variation in surface potential across the film. Fig. 6 shows distribution vs. surface potential plots of perovskite films crystallized in air for 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 h and control sample films crystallized by thermal annealing in an inert atmosphere. All the plots had a qualitatively similar nature of the distribution curve, with varying FWHM. A low FWHM for the 5 h air crystallized perovskite film (having a higher average surface potential of −0.25 V) compared to that of the thermally annealed control film (having a lower average surface potential of −0.32 V) indicates that 5 h air crystallized films have less variation in surface potential across the film suggesting a higher purity perovskite phase. A higher surface potential of the 5 h air crystallized film also indicates reduced defects (trap center for electrons) at the perovskite film surface, which mostly occurs as dangling bonds originating due to exposure of iodine atoms in the perovskite film.43 The thermally annealed film showed a larger variation in surface potential distribution. Annealing perovskite films at 100 °C can also lead to decomposition of perovskite by the escape of CH3NH3I from the film, which might cause a large variation in surface potential across the annealed film. Variation in surface potential distribution could also be attributed to the difference in surface potential at grains and grain boundaries in the films. The 5 h air crystallized films showed large nanorod features suggesting a smaller population of grain boundaries and therefore higher average surface potential (−0.25 V) in comparison to the thermally annealed perovskite film that is comprised of a larger number of grain boundaries causing lower average surface potential (−0.32 V).

Further, comparing the KPFM images of air crystallized films at different intervals of time in Fig. 5g–k and the control sample of the thermally annealed perovskite film (Fig. 5l), we observed a change in average surface potential across the surface. In the initial one hour of crystallization in air at room temperature, the film is composed of the majority crystalline intermediate phase, a portion of which starts converting to perovskite, showing a low average surface potential distribution of −0.36 V. At the end of 3 h, the perovskite sample has a mixed phase of the perovskite and intermediate complex, which results in slightly lower average surface potential (−0.43 V) across the film. After 5 h of crystallization in air, the perovskite phase is crystallized, resulting in a higher average surface potential of −0.25 V across the film. Beyond 5 h crystallization in air at room temperature, the perovskite phase decomposed and caused a new material phase (PbI2) to appear on the perovskite surface, resulting in a change in surface potential distribution thus having a lower average surface potential of −0.38 V after 8 h crystallization. The decrease in average surface potential could be attributed to higher contact potential difference [CPD = (Φtip − Φsample)/e], arising from the presence of PbI2 which has a low-lying valence band compared to perovskite. At the end of 10 h crystallization in air, even more PbI2 phase starts appearing as confirmed by XRD spectra (Fig. 3a) causing further slight reduction in average surface potential (−0.39 V) relative to the 8 h film, which could be attributed to the increase in the mixed phase of PbI2 and perovskite in the film. On comparison with the annealed perovskite film, we found that morphology of the annealed perovskite film (Fig. 5f) consists of small nanoparticle-like features, which is quite different from the nanorod morphology of the 5 h air crystallized film (Fig. 5c). However, the annealed film showed an average surface potential of −0.32 V (Fig. 5l), suggesting nearly the same material phase (crystalline perovskite) across the surface, but with a smaller grain size and low crystallinity.
All the above performed measurements (e.g., UV-Vis, XRD, topography and KPFM) convey a consistent picture of the morphology evolution. These data support the following mechanism of perovskite crystallization in ambient air at room temperature: immediately after spin coating of precursor solution inside the glovebox, the transparent film consists entirely of the intermediate phase, which slowly crystallizes into a pure crystalline perovskite phase upon exposure in ambient air at room temperature for 5 h. Beyond 5 h, the perovskite film shows irreversible degradation due to moisture where the perovskite phase decomposes and the PbI2 phase starts appearing.
Air processed perovskite films crystallized for different time intervals were used for device fabrication, and their performance was compared with that of annealed perovskite films as control sample devices. J–V curves of all devices and a table of individual device parameters are shown in Fig. 7a and Table 1. All J–V characteristics were recorded at a scan rate of 1 V s−1 with a step of 0.01 V in both forward and reverse directions. Device parameters including short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η%) showed a maximum when the room temperature air crystallization time was increased to 5 h with a Jsc of 23.98 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.95, FF of 73.91% and PCE of 16.83%. The devices made from perovskite films aged for 8 and 10 h showed a decrease in device performance. This decrease is well understood with perovskite film decomposition happening beyond 5 h crystallization in air. Decomposition can decrease light absorption and Jsc, increase series resistance with a reduced FF, and thus decrease the overall PCE. In addition, the control sample devices made from annealed perovskite films showed a PCE of 11.94%, which is much lower than that of the 5 h air crystallized sample. The relatively lower performance could be attributed to reduced crystallization and increased recombination driven by the large number of grain boundaries present in the thermally annealed perovskite film.19,44 5 h air crystallized perovskite film-based devices showed minimal hysteresis in forward and backward scans as shown in Fig. 7b, giving an average PCE of 16.22%. However, a significant hysteresis was observed in annealed perovskite film-based devices, which led to a difference (10.63% forward vs. 11.94% reversed) in device efficiency in forward and backward scans. Annealed perovskite films are comprised of smaller grains with a large number of grain boundaries, which will act as charge recombination centers due to defect and trap states present at grain boundaries and reduce device performance. We performed stabilized photocurrent measurements with a function of time at a maximum power point of ∼0.73 V for our 5 h air crystallized perovskite film based device (Fig. 7c). A stabilized photocurrent density of ∼21.5 mA cm−2 was observed for 120 seconds, showing a stabilized efficiency of ∼15.69%. A histogram showing the variation in average efficiency for 30 solar cells is shown in Fig. 7d for the 5 hour air crystallized perovskite film (average efficiency at 14.5%) and annealed perovskite film as the control sample (average efficiency at 10.3%). Table 1 lists individual device parameters under AM 1.5 solar simulator illuminated conditions for all sets of devices in both forward and reverse scans. Fig. S3, in the ESI,† shows incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of devices made using the 5 h air crystallized perovskite film and annealed perovskite film as the control sample. It was observed that the 5 h air crystallized film based device showed a higher IPCE than the control sample, which was consistent with the higher Jsc for the 5 h air crystallized based device. The thermally annealed film (control sample) based device showed lower IPCE across the absorption spectrum. The integrated Jsc from IPCE measurements was 21.23 mA cm−2 and 18.88 mA cm−2 for 5 h air crystallized film and control sample based devices. The integrated current densities were ∼10% of the current densities obtained from illuminated J–V measurements and were therefore in close agreement with each other.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have formed unique crystalline organometallic halide perovskite films composed of nanorod shaped features by simply crystallizing films completely in ambient air at room temperature. The crystallization process begins with the formation of a DMSO-based intermediate phase that converts to a crystalline perovskite nanorod phase in ambient air at room temperature over a period of 5 hours. The growth phase of perovskite films in ambient air at room temperature and its decomposition were studied in detail using UV-Vis, SPM, and XRD. Morphology evolution from small elongated features to large nanorods was observed by slowly crystallizing the perovskite film in ambient air for up to 5 h. Device performance was measured, revealing the 5 hour crystallized perovskite nanorod film with a champion PCE of 16.83%, which is much higher than the champion PCE of 11.94% for the traditional thermally annealed perovskite film as the control sample. This study of simple room temperature, ambient air crystallization of perovskite films paves the path for fabrication of low cost and efficient perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates.
