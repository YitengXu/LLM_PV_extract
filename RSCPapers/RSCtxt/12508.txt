    , Accepted 26th April 2019First published on 26th April 2019AbstractHerein, we report a simple and cost-effective route for the fabrication of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures using the chemical bath deposition method. As a binder-free electrode material for pseudo capacitors (PCs), the fabricated nickel foam-supported NiWO4Se exhibited an excellent cycling life of 3000 cycles with a high specific capacitance of 1115.05 F g−1 at 20 mA cm−2. The desirable electrochemical performance of NiWO4Se was mainly attributed to the large specific area, short ion diffusion distance, and the introduction of selenium, which provide transport pathways for electrons and provide more active sites for electrochemical energy storage. The present simple and scalable synthesis shows great potential for the future development of transition metal selenides for different energy storage and conversion applications.
1. Introduction
The increasing energy demand and global population have led to global warming, highlighting the need for clean and renewable energy resources, such as solar cells, fuel cells, batteries, and super-capacitors. Super-capacitors (SCs) are potential energy storage systems because of their desirable properties: high power density, rapid charge–discharge characteristics, low cost, long cycle life stability, and environmentally friendly operation conditions.1–3 Energy storage is needed for home and electronic appliances, and has started to play indispensable roles in electronic systems, including hybrid electric vehicles, memory back-up equipment, microelectrochemical systems, digital cameras, and cellular phones.2,4–6 SCs are generally classified into two categories: (1) electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo capacitors (PCs). EDLCs store electrical energy via electrostatic diffusion and adsorption/desorption of the ion process at the electrode/electrolyte interface.7 PCs deliver more energy than EDLCs because of their rapid reversible faradaic redox reactions occurring between the electro-active materials and electrolyte solution.8,9 The electrode active materials for PCs are focused mainly on metal transition metal oxides/sulfides and conducting polymers. Considerable research efforts have been devoted to increasing the energy density of PCs with single and mixed metal oxide/hydroxide nanostructures.10–14 The rate capability and cycling stability of SCs are two important parameters for practical applications. The rate capability is usually limited by the poor conductivity to support the rapid electron transport required at a high rate.15 In addition, mixing polymer binders and conductive agents with active materials results in an increase in the dead surface. This increased dead surface can suppress electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion, which may limit their charge storage properties for PCs.
The direct growth and binder-free electrodes on conducting substrates, such as nickel foam, carbon fiber, and stainless steel, have remarkable advantages, including an increase in the number of electro-active sites for reversible faradaic redox reactions, efficient electrical contact between the active materials and electrolyte solution, short-ion diffusion, enhanced rate capability, and cycling stability.16–18 Based on the literature, different techniques are used to fabricate electrode materials for PCs, e.g., hydrothermal synthesis, electro-deposition (ED), chemical bath deposition (CBD), physical deposition, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), and spray pyrolysis.19–23 Among these techniques, CBD is flexible and simple for the deposition of various nanostructure materials owing to its high deposition rate, high volume, and large area uniformity. Based on the above discussion, the exploration of advanced electrode materials for flexible PCs in alkaline media is a key challenge.
In the past few years, transition single metal oxides/hydroxides such as NiO,24 Co3O4,25 MnO2,26 WO313 and V2O5,27 and Ni(OH)223 have been studied extensively as electrode materials for PCs. However, the low conductivity and poor stability are the big hurdles to their practical applications. Compared to the corresponding elemental oxides, binary transition metal oxides are promising electrode candidates for energy storage applications because of their multiple oxidation states of two different metal cations and high electrical conductivity. The combination of two different metal cations could enhance the conductivity greatly or provide a wide range of oxidation states thus potentially enabling improvements in electrochemical properties. Recently, some reports indicated that the conductivity of NiWO4 obtained by incorporation of W into NiO could be greatly enhanced, which is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of monometallic NiO, and thus, various NiWO4 nanostructures with high electrochemical performances have been successfully synthesized. Nickel oxide (NiO) and tungsten oxide are considered important candidates as an antiferromagnetic layer, p-type semiconductor, anti-glare rearview mirrors for automobiles, and a functional sensing layer for developing chemical sensors.24,25 Accordingly, NiWO4 has desirable physicochemical properties with possible applications in areas, such as magnetism, photo-catalytic (PC) degradation of dyes, super-capacitor-type hybrid electrodes, active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions, selective detection of sub-ppm-level p-xylene, gas/humidity sensors, photo-electrochemical water oxidation, and photoluminescence (PL).26–33 In particular, NiWO4 offers excellent electrochemical properties for SCs due to its high melting point and mechanical stability. For example, Nithiyanantham et al. made-up self-assembled NiWO4 nanoparticles into chain-like aggregates on DNA scaffolds with pronounced catalytic and supercapacitor activities.34 The specific capacitance of this chain-like NiWO4 electrode was 45 F g−1 at a current density of 2 mA cm−1 and the capacitive retention was approximately 90% after 1000 cycles. Guanjie et al. reported a one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize NiWO4 and CoWO4 nanostructures on nickel foam as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor applications.35 The as-synthesized materials showed excellent electrochemical performance, with a high specific capacitance of 797.8 F g−1 and 764.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 3000 cycles. Goli Nagaraju et al. fabricated burl-like amorphous NiWO4 NSs on CF substrates (NiWO4 NSs/CF) via a facile ED method and showed their application as a flexible and cost-effective electrode for pseudocapacitors.36 The designed flexible electrode in this work exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1192.2 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1 and showed good cycling performance. Meanwhile, the elements phosphides (P) or selenides (Se) have received specific attention because of their better capacitive performance compared with other transition metal-based pseudocapacitive electrode materials, which could be ascribed to their unique metalloid characteristics. Particularly, the Ni-based phosphides or selenides, such as amorphous Ni–P, Ni2P nanoflakes, Ni2P/Ni foam, Ni2P/graphene, and NiSe, have been reported to deliver high specific capacity as electrode materials for supercapacitors.37,38
In view of the abovementioned facts, our objective was to grow NiWO4 nanostructures using other non-metals (O, P, and Se) by a simplistic and eco-friendly CBD technique at low temperature (∼95 °C). The proposed synthesis process is simple and less time-consuming and does not need any sophisticated instruments and to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the electrochemical performance of using NiWO4 with other non-metals. In the present study, it was found that NiWO4 nanostructures show different specific capacitance (Cs) values for various morphologies, and the highest capacitance value was observed for selenium based NiWO4 having a nanoball structure with desirable rate capability and adequate stability. This study described a new route for the synthesis of NiWO4 nanostructures for self-powered energy storage and harvesting devices in near future. The electrochemical studies were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling (GC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) without using any polymer binders or conducting agents.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Ni (NO3)2·6H2O], sodium tungstate dihydrate [Na2WO4·2H2O], urea [CH4N2O], ammonium phosphate [(NH4)3PO4], selenium dioxide [SeO2], potassium hydroxide [KOH], hydrochloric acid [HCl, 36–38%] and nickel foam (NF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures
The synthesis of NiWO4 (O, P, and Se) nanostructures was performed by a facile and cost-effective CBD technique as follows: prior to the deposition, the commercially available nickel foam substrate was cut into a 1 × 4 cm2 rectangular piece and was sequentially cleaned with HCl for 30 minutes to remove the surface oxide layer followed by cleaning ultrasonically with ethyl alcohol, and DI water for 10 min each. Here, the NF was divided by the sizes of 1 × 2 cm2 for NiWO4Se growth and 1 × 2 cm2 for electrode contact using Kapton tape for preventing the deposition of nanostructured material on the rear side of NF from the total area of 1 × 4 cm2. Typically, the growth solution was prepared by mixing Ni (NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 M), Na2WO4·2H2O (0.1 M), SeO2 (0.4 M), and CH4N2O (0.6 M) and was dissolved in 40 mL deionized (DI) under vigorous stirring for 40 min at room temperature (RT) to form a clear solution. The growth solution was transferred to a Pyrex screw-cap bottle and then the well cleaned NF substrates are immersed vertically in the growth solution followed by heating at 95 °C in a hot-air oven for 7 h. After that, the sample was taken out, washed two times with DI water and ethyl alcohol to remove the residuum and impurities. Finally, the samples were dried in an electric oven at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the NiWO4Se nanoballs. For comparison, NiWO4, and NiWO4P electrodes were also prepared by a similar procedure, but CH4N2O (0.6 M) and (NH4)3PO4 (0.4 M) were added for NiWO4 and NiWO4P instead of SeO2. The mass of the active materials coated over NF substrates was found to be ∼2.9, ∼5.5, and ∼5.2 mg cm−2, respectively.
The electrochemical properties of NiWO4Se were further examined by a series of experiments at different deposition times (1 h, and 4 h) in 1 M KOH solution.
2.3. Material characterization
The surface morphology and elemental mapping of the prepared samples were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, HITACHI SU-70) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector (EDS) and a TEM (JEM 200CX, JEOL). The phase and crystal structure of the synthesized samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 advance X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu-Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54060) at a scan rate of 0.1° s−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific (UK), Theta Probe AR-XPS System, 100 W) with Al kα (1486.6 eV) was used to study the chemical compositions and element oxidation states.
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the prepared samples were determined using a three-electrode cell configuration, which was composed of active materials grown on NF (working electrode), Pt wire (counter electrode), and Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) respectively, in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution at room temperature (RT). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) properties were studied using the Biologic SP-150 electrochemical workstation at RT. The specific capacitance of electrode materials was evaluated according to the following formula:39 (1)where Cs is the specific capacitance, I is the applied current density, ΔV is the potential range, Δt is the discharge time, and m is the mass of the active material on the NF electrode.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis of nickel and tungsten oxides was realized by phosphidation and selenization processes through a one-step CBD method at 90 °C for 7 h. Compared to the colloidal method and hydrothermal method for preparing Ni–W-materials, this method could synthesize materials with a complex morphology. In general, the ion-exchange mechanism works because materials with lower Ksp values are more thermodynamically stable, which is closely related to the electronegativity of the different elements (O > P > Se). This method offers a way to examine the correlation between different Ni–W-materials. Initially, NiWO4 exhibited a golden yellow color, and after adding (NH4)3PO4 into NiWO4 the color of the solution changed into blue, similarly, after adding SeO2 into NiWO4, the solution turns into a light black color, respectively. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental procedure. First, NiWO4 nanoparticles were grown directly on a flexible NF substrate without any binder. The conducting NF substrate could provide the desired electrical conductivity and structural support for the active materials to form. Second, the NiWO4 precursor was transformed to NiWO4P nanosheets through a phosphidation process at the same temperature and time. Subsequently, the NiWO4 precursor was converted to a NiWO4Se nanoball structure supported on the NF substrate through a selenization process.

SEM provided important information related to the material structure as well as the apparent particle size and elemental composition present in the material. Fig. 2 shows the FE-SEM images of the (a) NiWO4, (b) NiWO4P, and (c) NiWO4Se nanostructures obtained at 95 °C for 7 h. The mixing of Ni2+ and WO42− in an aqueous solution could immediately cause the production of NiWO4 crystals. Fig. 2a(i and ii) show low and high magnification images of the NiWO4 composed of a nano berry morphology assembled randomly by dozens of tiny individual nanoparticles with some agglomeration. In addition, with the gradual decrease in tungsten content in the amorphous NiWO4 composite, more Ni2+ was observed and the resulting irregular shape could limit ion diffusion, which is in accordance with the EDX spectrum. Fig. 2(i and ii) show the surface morphology of NiWO4P consisting of a nanosheet structure with a mean size of ∼120 nm to 130 nm. The nanosheets assembled as a flower structure that was interconnected with each other to form intricate transportation networks. Fig. 2c(i and ii) present the low and high magnification SEM images of the NiWO4Se nanoball structure. A sphere-like nanoball structure with a mean diameter of 15–29 nm and a rough surface formed when selenium was added to NiWO4. The addition of selenium alters the surface energy of the reaction system, which could slow down the decomposition process of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O, and Na2WO4·2H2O precursors. Each sphere had a uniform shape, which would support easy electrolyte ion diffusion, control volume expansion/shrinkage during charge/discharge cycling, and encourage rapid electron transfer during a redox reaction. When the size of the material was decreased, the width of the forbidden band was changed, which means a decrease in the conduction band and an increase in the valence band. Eventually, the electronic energy is increased and the transition is easier. Based on the surface morphology, the nanoball structure can deliver sufficient space and linkage to contact with electrolyte ions, which is favorable for enhancing the charge–discharge rate.40

The chemical composition and oxidation states of the elements in the as-synthesized NiWO4 (O, P, and Se) nanostructures were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Fig. 3(a) presents the survey spectrum of NiWO4Se showing nickel, tungsten, and selenium. The binding energy (BE) associated with Ni 2p3/2 is commonly used to identify the valence states of nickel species on the surface of the material.41Fig. 3(b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p3; intense Ni 2p3/2 peaks were observed at 855.93, 856.79, and 856.52 eV, confirming the divalent oxidation state of Ni ions.42 The peak difference between the main peak at 856.52 eV of Ni 2p3/2 and the core level peak at 870.4 eV was 13.88 eV, representing the Ni2+ oxidation state. Fig. 3(c) shows the binding energies of the W 4f spectrum; the three peaks centered at 34.19, 35.04, and 37.05 eV were fitted with a single W 4f7/2–W 4f5/2 doublet peak, which is compatible with the +6 oxidation state of W atoms in the intact (WO3)3 clusters.43 The corresponding O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) contained a single component at 530.85 eV, which is also compatible with the NiWO4 literature data.44 The sharp peak centered at 132.74 eV in Fig. 3(e) was assigned to the P 2p energy level and can be regarded as diagnostic of the pentavalent tetra-bonded phosphorus in NiWO4P.45,46 As described in Fig. 3f, the peak centered at 58.56 eV could be attributed to the Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin–orbit couple, which is representative of metal–selenium bonds.47 Therefore, XPS analysis confirms that the reported materials are composed mainly of Ni2+, W 4f, O 1s, P 2p, and Se 3d without any impurities, which is consistent with EDX analysis.

The phase structure and purity of the as-prepared NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures were characterized by powder XRD between 5° and 80°2θ. As shown in Fig. 4(i), the slightly broad XRD peaks indicate the fine particle size of the NiWO4 sample, which is typical of a powder crystal sample. The XRD patterns were in good agreement with the values obtained from the standard data for a monoclinic NiWO4 crystal with a wolframite structure (JCPDS#: 15-0755).48 The major component of the obtained material was nickel, which consisted of broad diffraction peaks with low intensity, indicating the poorly crystalline and amorphous characteristics of the product. These results are consistent with previous studies on NiWO4.48,49 Similarly, the as-obtained NiWO4P sample included clear XRD peaks and the patterns are consistent with those reported for nickel and tungsten phosphide (JCPDS#:01-074-1385, 22-1190, 29-1364, 76-2364), respectively.50,51 The XRD patterns of the NiWO4Se peaks were well matched with the JCPDS#: 15-0755, 41-1495, 18-0888, and 38-1388, revealing the high purity of the products.48,52,53 The peaks at 2θ values of 15.57, 19.91, 23.48, 24.74, 30.53, 36.21, and 41.14° correspond to the (010), (100), (011), (110), (111), (002), and (102) crystal planes, respectively. These results suggest that the experimental conditions used were favorable for the formation of transition metal tungstates.

Furthermore, the detailed morphology of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures was examined by TEM. The low-magnification images clearly show that the nanostructures are distributed uniformly over the entire surface of the NF (Fig. 4(ii, iii, and iv)). The TEM image of the as-prepared NiWO4-amorphous material revealed crystals composed of small aggregated nanoparticles (Fig. 4(ii)), which is in good agreement with the XRD result. Each ‘berry’ agglomerated to form a bunch of collective giant ‘berries’. As shown in Fig. 4(iii), the TEM image of NiWO4P consisted of an interconnected nanosheet structure with a transparent distinction that exhibits the ultrathin nature. The magnified TEM image of NiWO4Se confirmed the formation of the nanoball structure (Fig. 4(iv)), which can provide a sufficient number of electrochemically active sites for a surface redox reaction, resulting in high pseudocapacitance.54 These results are in accordance with the SEM images. The EDS spectrum of NiWO4 confirmed the presence of nickel (Ni) 88.42%, tungsten (W) 0.8% and oxygen (O) 10.79% (Fig. 4v), whereas increased Ni (97.12%) and decreased W (0.46%) with phosphate P (2.42%) were observed for NiWO4P (Fig. 4vi). A similar phenomenon was also observed for NiWO4Se with Ni (39.6%), W (22.21%), and Se (38.19) (Fig. 4vii). The increase of Ni and the decrease of W atomic percentages were due to the further reduction of P and Se. The non-metals present in NiWO4 were reduced simultaneously in NiWO4P and NiWO4Se, which resulted in the chemical compositions (Fig. 4v–vii). The elemental composition mapping of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se also showed the uniform distribution of nickel, tungsten, and oxygen, phosphate, and selenium atoms in the respective materials as shown in Fig. 5(a–c).

The electrochemical properties of nanoball structured NiWO4Se and other samples were first evaluated in the three-electrode system using 1 M KOH electrolyte solution at room temperature (RT). Fig. 6(a) presents the typical CV curves of NF, NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 within the potential range of 0–0.7 V relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The anodic and cathodic currents of the Ni foam are significantly smaller than the NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se electrodes. Thus, the capacitance of the Ni foam can be neglected. All the CV curves of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se electrodes consisted of a pair of strong redox peaks, indicating that the capacitance is derived principally by pronounced faradaic redox reactions and the redox reactions are related to M–O/M–O–OH associated with OH− in the electrolyte, where M refers to Ni2+ or WO4. For comparison, NF, NiWO4, and NiWO4P/NF were also studied and the results are presented in the ESI (Fig. S1, S2, and S3†). Initially, NiWO4 exhibited a very low current density due to the poor reversible redox reaction. NiWO4P and NiWO4Se were used to improve the current density and capacitive behavior further. Interestingly, selenium showed a richer redox reaction than NiWO4P and NiWO4. The CV integral area was in the order of NiWO4 < NiWO4P < NiWO4Se, which demonstrated the best electrochemical performance of the NiWO4Se electrode compared to NiWO4, and NiWO4P. Fig. 6(b) presents the CV curves of NiWO4Se at different scan rates from 5 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1. Well-defined redox peaks were observed in each curve and with increasing scan rate, the oxidation and reduction peaks shifted slightly to the opposite directions with an increased potential gap. This was attributed to the polarization effect of the electrode during the redox reaction and faradaic capacitive behavior.55 It should be noted that the amount of W can improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode materials, indicating the perfect fast ionic and electron transportation of the active materials.

(c) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of the NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se nanostructures at a current density of 20 mA cm−2. (d) GCD curves of the NiWO4Se electrode at different current densities from 20 to 40 mA cm−2. (e) EIS spectrum of NiWO4Se, (f) Specific capacity values versus discharge current densities. 

Fig. 6(c) shows the GCD curves of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se electrodes at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 in the potential window of 0–0.45 V. The charge–discharge characteristics of all these electrodes exhibited typical pseudo-capacitive behavior, and the discharge time of the three electrodes was in the following order: NiWO4 < NiWO4P < NiWO4Se, which is consistent with their CV curve features. According to eqn (1), the specific capacitance of NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se was 625.91, 807.22, and 1115.05 F g−1 at a current density of 20 mA cm−2, respectively. As expected, NiWO4Se exhibited a longer discharge time and higher specific capacitance than the other samples, which is in good agreement with the CV results. The better electrochemical performance was attributed to the metal alloy–selenium nanostructure, as described above. Moreover, the well retained sphere-like nanoball structure also helps in giving rise to more redox reaction sites. Therefore, the NiWO4Se electrode was used to examine the rate capability and cycling stability of the pseudo-capacitor. Fig. 6(d) presents the GCD curves of NiWO4Se measured at different current densities from 20 to 40 mA cm−2, which were approximately non-linear charge/discharging characteristics at any current density, indicating that NiWO4Se undergoes reversible redox reactions and has fine electrochemical capacity characteristics. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) plots of the NiWO4, NiWO4P, and NiWO4Se in 1 M KOH and redox electrolyte were obtained between the frequency ranges of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at an open circuit potential with an alternating current voltage of 5 mV as displayed in Fig. 6e. The Nyquist plots exhibited a sloped line in the low-frequency region corresponding to the ion diffusion resistance and a small circle in the high-frequency region related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) induced by the redox reactions at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. It could be observed obviously that the NiWO4Se electrode with the redox electrolyte exhibited a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) than the NiWO4 and NiWO4P. This further indicates the increase in the intercalation pseudocapacitance (Cp) value with respect to the growth of NiWO4Se on the NF substrate. The corresponding specific capacitances calculated from the discharge curves at different current densities are presented in Fig. 6(f). The specific capacitances of the NiWO4Se electrode were calculated to be 1115.05, 554.50, and 330.05 F g−1, at discharge current densities of 20–40, mA cm−2, respectively. For NiWO4, the specific capacitance can be calculated to be 625.91, 580.49, and 422.95 F g−1 at different current densities of 20–40, mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. S1(c).† Likewise, Fig. S2(f)† shows that the specific capacitance values of NiWO4P are evaluated to be 807.22, 569.45, and 428.57 F g−1 at different current densities of 20–40, mA cm−2. The nearly symmetric curves at all current densities and distinct plateau regions could be observed, and at higher densities, the specific capacitance can be reduced due to the fact that the electrolyte ions diffuse only to the outer surface of the electroactive materials. Overall from the charge–discharge analysis, the NiWO4Se electrode exhibits the longest discharge time, which agrees well with the CV results. The enhanced specific capacitance was mainly attributed to the advent amount of selenium on the NiWO4Se substrate, which results in intimate contact between the NF and each nanoball. In addition, the specific capacitance values observed in the present work are comparable to or even better than those previously reported for metal tungsten electroactive materials for supercapacitor application,34,50 for example, amorphous CoWO4 nanoparticles (403 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 298 F g−1 at 3 A g−1),56 and a rGO-CoWO4 nanocomposite (159.9 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1).57
To estimate the cycling stability of the material, we also performed a long-term cycling stability test because it is an important factor for practical applications. Herein, the long-term cycling stability of the NiWO4Se electrode was examined over 3000 cycles for supercapacitors by continuous CV scanning at 40 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The electrode exhibited stable capacitance without noticeable degradation over 3000 cycles. This might be correlated with the activation of the electrode as a result of its improved surface wetting with cycling, which allows for the generation of more active sites and enhances the permeability of the electrolyte (i.e., it eases the accessibility of the electrolyte ions) and retains 75% capacitance. The unique properties of the NiWO4Se electrode for PCs provide a large specific surface area and more active sites that can effectively improve the utilization and pseudocapacitance of the electro-active materials. Fig. 7(b) shows the cycling stability with continuous GCD cycles up to 3000 cycles at a current density of 40 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. During the initial cycles, the capacitance of NiWO4Se was stable due to the activation of the material and decreased gradually over the prolonged cycles. After 2000 cycles, selenium-based nickel-tungsten exhibited excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of about 75.0%. It is evident that the charge–discharge profiles were linear and symmetric, indicating good columbic efficiency.

The direct growth of the nanoball structure provides a short path length and good accessibility for the electrolyte, and it also enhances the mechanical adhesion and electrical contact with the substrate, as shown schematically in Fig. 8. These results suggest that the as-prepared NiWO4Se possesses good electron storage ability and enhanced electrochemical performance for supercapacitors in alkaline media. In summary, the absence of a polymer binder avoids the increase in series resistance, blocking of the active sites, and inhibition of diffusion. Selenium (Se) offers richer active sites compared to other nonmetals, which leads to higher electrochemical performance in the oxidation reactions. Moreover, several possible future trends for high-performance SCs are listed below:
1. Exploring sustainable materials for SCs, which are Earth-abundant, renewable, recyclable and non-toxic.
2. Single metallic compounds have intrinsically low electrical conductivity; doping with conductive oxides or integration with conductive carbon nanomaterials can improve the conductivity and enhance the pseudo-capacitive behaviors of the composite materials.
3. Designing lightweight and mechanically flexible electrodes for future applications.
4. Highly scalable, facile, solution-based methods and printing techniques will be a good solution for making SC devices on a large scale with low cost and high-performance.
5. Moreover, designing reasonable electrolytes to optimize the performance of SCs may lead to higher voltage operation windows without loss of outstanding cycling stability.
6. Finally, establishing the testing standards: it is necessary to establish the standards for testing supercapacitors in order to compare the performance data taken from different laboratories. Based on the above rules, the ideal electrode materials for SCs should be highly porous, conductive, light, highly active and stable. In conclusion, SC devices will play an important role in energy storage and harvesting, which is expected to complement batteries in certain applications to reduce environmental pollution problems and minimize the use of hydrocarbon fuels.

4. Conclusions
In summary, NiWO4 has been successfully prepared with other non-metals (O, P, and Se) and without using any binders via the CBD method. The NiWO4Se electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 1115.05 F g−1 at 20 mA cm−2 and displayed desirable stability with 80% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The selenium based NiWO4Se nanoball structure exhibited excellent electrochemical performance including high specific capacitance and desirable stability compared to NiWO4 and NiWO4P. Such interesting capacitive behavior is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects between the nickel and tungsten ions. Moreover, selenium present in the electroactive materials provides more active sites for the ion diffusion and charge transfer, which certainly increases the conductivity of the electrode materials and helps significantly towards pseudocapacitance enhancement. This new electrode holds huge promise in enriching selenide composites for applications in energy conversion and storage systems.
