Herein, we find that the incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes into rutile TiO2 improves the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient at a low filling fraction of tubes; moreover, the former was due to the lengthening of the mean free path and doping modified carrier mobility for the latter. Tube-oxide mixing also causes significant phonon drag at the interfaces and the reduced thermal conductivity was verified by the promoted figure of merit.
Introduction
Materials that show potential in thermoelectric powering (TEP) have drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Three factors determine the efficiency of energy conversion at a given temperature (T) and can be linked through a dimensionless parameter known as the figure of merit ZT = σS2T/k, where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the Seebeck coefficient, σS2 is the power factor and k is the thermal conductivity.1 Scattering plays a crucial role in determining σS2 and has been verified by alloying Bi with Sb and Te.2,3 Studies reveal that alloying creates multi-domains and carriers encounter a Schottky-like barrier at the interfaces.3 In this case, interfacial scattering occurs and reduced k leads to a ZT promotion.3 However, the cited alloys are toxic in nature and produce environmental issue. Accordingly, the search for replacements becomes important and studies currently focus on oxides, including ZnO, CaMnO3, NaCo2O4, Ca3Co4O9, In2O3·SnO2 and TiO.4–7
Oxides, however, lack free carriers and large σS2 values only emerge at high T, e.g. In2O3·SnO2 gives σS2 = 1.6 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at T = 1300 K.4 Doping may promote the carrier density (n)8 to some extent and has been carried out on CaMnO3 using Bi as the dopant.5–7 However, the ZT does not significantly increase with doping and the underlying mechanism has been interpreted according to Ioffe's approximation:  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, r is the absolute scattering factor, m* is the effective mass and h denotes Planck's constant.8 The equation clearly indicates that S is inversely proportional to n (i.e. S ∝ n−1) and σ is improved at the expense of S. TiO2 is eco-friendly and its photo-catalytic character has been proved capable of promoting charge storage in solar cells as well as supercapacitors.9 He et al. have studied TiOx at T = 20 °C and a positive S value was found at x = 1.2–1.7. S then transits into a negative value at x = 1.7 and reaches the maximum at x = 2.10 Again, TiO2 shows a low σS2 value and the ZT lies on 0.1–0.2 at T = 700–1100 K.10,11 In this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are thermally mixed with rutile TiO2 and the resultant composites exhibit increased σ and reduced k at a low filling fraction of tubes (fCNT), i.e. amplified σ/k. Both k and σ significantly increase as fCNT approximates the electrical percolation threshold (τ) and the improvement is because of tube networking. Surprisingly, S is also promoted and displays S ∝ fCNT prior to τ. S then decreases and approaches the positive regime at fCNT ∼ τ, indicative of p-type CNTs governed TEP. The study here shows TEP improvement by 5553% for σS2 and 7380% for ZT at T = 300–523 K.
Experimental
Synthesis
MWCNTs (95% purity, Legend Star International Co., Ltd) and TiO2 (P25, average particle size ∼25 nm, Aldrich) were dispersed in ethanol using planet ball milling (290 rpm, ball size = 3 mm and 4 h). The dispersion was then dried at 60 °C and the remaining solid mixture was sintered by a spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique at 1200 K; the CNT content in oxide was 0.1 wt% (TC0.1), 0.5 wt% (TC0.5), 1 wt% (TC1) and 10 wt% (TC10).
Materials characterization
The composite texture was inspected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the bonding character were analysed using Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A four-wire technique was employed to probe σ and S at 300–523 K; the former was carried out using a Keithley-4200 power supply with the background noise controlled at ±0.5 nA. The k was determined according to the equation k = φCpρ, where ρ is the material density, Cp is the heat capacity and φ is the thermal diffusivity. First, the samples were pressed into pellets and sandwiched between thin carbon films as a reference. Second, φ and Cp were probed using the laser-flash technique (LFA-447) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at 10 °C min−1.
The band structure, including energy gap (Eg) and LUMO/HOMO states at EF, was calculated using the ab initio method (CASTEP) as follows: first, an extended oxide structure was built in a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice and was geometrically optimized with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Second, the ultrasoft pseudopotential and Monkhorst–Pack grid were set at 480 eV and 0.05 Å−1, respectively. Third, the m* at the minimum of LUMO and maximum of HOMO was determined according to the equation shown below:  where ℏ and k are the reduced planck constant and wave-vector, respectively and E(k) denotes the energy with respect to k12 similar procedures were also applied to the carbon doped oxide structure with a doping content of 0.1 wt%. For the sake of accuracy, Eg was also measured using diffuse-reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy and the data obtained was fit with the equation, αhν = C(hν − Eg)γ, where α is the linear absorption coefficient, ν is the incident frequency, C is the proportionality constant and γ is a constant determined by Eg, i.e. γ = 0.5 for direct Eg and γ = 2 for indirect Eg.13–15
Results and discussion
Sintering causes fusion and oxide particles to become interconnected (Fig. 1(a)). The addition of CNTs into the oxide creates low resistance paths and joule heating takes place mainly at the embedded tubes. Accordingly, the oxides remain granulated and are decorated with dispersed tubes (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(c) displays the Raman spectra of sintered oxide (red) in comparison with TC0.1 (green). For the rutile phase, the Raman-active modes due to site symmetry appear at 143 cm−1 (B1g), 447 cm−1 (Eg) and 612 cm−1 (A1g), along with a broad feature arising from multi-phonon processes at 235 cm−1 (red).16–18 The Eg mode gets shifted (∼9 cm−1, green) as tubes are added and the phenomenon may come from carbon doping. First, the XPS spectra exhibit C1s peak at 284.6 eV and distinguishable features at 286.4 eV and 288.5 eV, which corresponds to C–O and CO bonds (Fig. 2(a)).19 Second, the Eg mode was non-polar in nature and the mode frequency was essentially determined by the bond length and strength.17 In other words, Ti was replaced by C and carboxyl forms. Third, carbide (TiC) was absent in the XPS spectra, excluding O–C substitution. Fourth, doping induces a blue-shift in the Ti4+ spectra and the peaks move by 0.25 eV for Ti2p1/2 (463.7 eV) and 0.3 eV for Ti2p3/2 (458.1 eV) (Fig. 2(b)).19,20 Fifth, Ti–C substitution creates stresses (circle, Fig. 3(a) and (b)) and charges redistribute (Fig. 3(c) and (d)).

Fig. 4(a) displays the σ profiles of pure oxide (red), TC0.1 (blue), TC0.5 (green), TC1 (pink) and TC10 (yellow) at 300–523 K. We find that the improvement reaches one order of magnitude for TC0.1, TC0.5 and TC1 and σ ∝ T was attributed to the Boltzmann energy (kBT) created carriers in the CNTs.21 For TC10, σ increases by two orders of magnitude relative to the oxide alone, confirming τ ∼ fCNT = 10 wt%. Two factors contribute to the σ enhancement according to equation σ = ne2η/m* where η is the mean free path controlled relaxation time. Apparently, the η prevails and n increases because the carbon doping was limited. First, pure oxide has an Eg of 3.03 eV at the Γ point and doping created an n-type state that lies at 2.674 eV (Fig. 4(b)). At 300 K, the kBT (= 0.0259 eV) was too low to create thermal carriers through band-to-band transitions, including valence band → doped state (ΔEv–d = 2.674 eV), doped state → conduction band (ΔEd–c = 0.356 eV) and valence band → conduction band (ΔEv–c = 3.03 eV) (Fig. 4(b)). Second, the sequence of kBT ≪ ΔEd–c < ΔEv–d < ΔEv–c remains at 523 K (kBT523K = 0.045 eV), indicative of unchanged n. Third, the UV-vis spectra support calculation and Eg was found to be 2.89 eV for oxide, 2.48 eV for TC0.1, 2.41 eV for TC0.5, 2.28 eV for TC1 and 1.67 eV for TC10, exceeding kBT at 300 K and 523 K (Table 1 & Fig. 5(a)). Fourth, S was promoted from 470 µV K−1 (oxide) to 550 µV K−1 (TC0.1–1) at 300 K and from 500 µV K−1 to 610 µV K−1 at 523 K, in contradiction with S ∝ n−1 (Fig. 5(b)). S then significantly decreased and approaches the positive regime at TC10, again the supporting p-type CNTs governed the TEP (yellow, Fig. 5(b)).

CNTs conduct heat and are often dispersed in the polymers to improve k. The incorporation of CNTs into a polymer, however, induces heat resistance at the interfaces and effective thermal conduction appears to rely on the tube-polymer cohesion.13 The oxide-tube coupling, according to SEM inspections (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) was weak and enhanced scattering at the interfaces was expected.13 Measurements carried out at 300 K yield k = 3.05 W m−1 K−1 for oxide and 2.2–2.39 W m−1 K−1 for TC0.1–1, supporting enhanced scattering at the tube/oxide contacts (Fig. 6(a)). Conduction paths are then switched from bulk oxide to tubes at fCNT ∼ τ and conversion was supported by (i) significant k increase and (ii) Umklapp process induced k ∝ T−1 in CNTs;22 the latter being measured to be 3.02 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and 2.4 W m−1 K−1 at 523 K.
 Fig. 6  The k (a), σS2 (b) and ZT profiles (c) of the oxide and doped oxides. 

Fig. 6(b) plots σS2 against fCNT at 300–523 K. Again, improvement was evident by a large gap between the pure oxide and TC0.1–1; the former lies on 10−7 W m−1 K−2 and 10−5 W m−1 K−2 for the latter. The ZT profiles display a similar trend and the gap also reaches two orders of magnitude (Fig. 6(c)). It is worth mentioning that ZT improvements here may not be as large as the reported data, whereas a simultaneous increase in σ/k and S was novel and has not been previously observed. Table 2 compares TC0.1 with recent reports on single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs)- and graphene-based composites: the negative sign and the numbers in the brackets indicate a negative enhancement and an increase with respect to the initial. First, the addition of CNTs and/or graphenes into a TEP matrix results in a reduced k, supporting enhanced scattering at the interfaces. Second, ZT in MWCNTs/WS2 and graphene/PbTe systems was promoted at the expense of S. Third, SWCNTs/Bi2Te3 shows improved S and reduced σ, therefore giving a finite ZT enhancement. Fourth, TC0.1 shows increased σ/k and S, and ZT were enhanced by 7380%. Questions however remain as to why S increases at a low fCNT. According to the Ioffe's approximation, S also varies with m* and is therefore expected to change upon doping. Table 3 lists mh*/mo and me*/mo along the crystallographic planes of [100], [010] and [001] where me*, mh* and mo are the mass of electrons, hole carriers and free electrons, respectively. Note that the mh*/mo and me*/mo along [001] plane may be ignored because σ was mainly contributed by carriers that have a lower m* and move along electric field. The calculation shows an increase of 61% (me*/mo) and 27% (mh*/mo) along the [100] plane, supporting doping modified carrier mobility. The me*/mo > mh*/mo also takes place at the [010] plane and an increase was measured to be 62% and 25%.

Conclusions
CNTs/TiO2 composites made using an SPS technique exhibit increased σ/k and S, and the underlying mechanism involves the lengthening of the mean free path and m* change upon tube addition. The weak tube-oxide coupling induces interfacial scattering and results in reduced k. S was negative at a low fCNT and increases from TC0.1 to TC1. TC10 was governed by p-type CNTs and S decreases towards a positive regime. Tube addition creates a doped state below LUMO and me*/mo increases by 61–62% along the (100) and (010) planes, accounting for the increased S.
