    , Accepted 7th April 2014First published on 7th April 2014AbstractEmploying a low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalyst to replace Pt-based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted increasing interest in renewable energy research. Earth-abundant transition metals such as Fe, Co and Ni have been investigated as promising alternatives in alkaline electrolytes. However, these non-precious-metal catalysts are not stable in acids, excluding their application in the acidic solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Herein, we report a strategy to encapsulate 3d transition metals Fe, Co and the FeCo alloy into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and investigated their HER activity in acidic electrolytes. The optimized catalysts exhibited long-term durability and high activity with only an ∼70 mV onset overpotential vs. RHE which is quite close to that of the commercial 40% Pt/C catalyst, demonstrating the potential for the replacement of Pt-based catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of metal and nitrogen dopants can synergistically optimize the electronic structure of the CNTs and the adsorption free energy of H atoms on CNTs, and therefore promote the HER with a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.

Broader context
The electrolysis of water to hydrogen is recognized as a front-running technology for energy storage and conversion from renewable sources such as solar and wind powers. One of the key reactions for this technology, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is currently high-cost due to the massive use of precious Pt-based catalysts. It is urgent to employ low-cost and earth-abundant materials to replace precious-metal catalysts in order to make this technology become more economical. However, most non-precious metals, especially very abundant 3d transition metals, are not stable in acidic medium, usually leading to a severely degraded activity. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for non-precious-metal catalysts with high activity and long-term durability towards HER via encapsulating Fe, Co and FeCo alloy into N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). In this system, these 3d metals are protected by the carbon wall around them, and thereby do not directly contact with the acidic electrolyte, while the exotic activity for HER originates from electron transfer from the metals, which further modifies the electronic structure of the carbon surface. This work paves a new route in the design of efficient and durable non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for HER in acidic medium.

The production of H2 is essential to a few key technologies related to our energy future,1 for instance the hydrogen fuel cells and the synthesis of liquid fuels from syngas and CO2. Among current technologies for H2 production, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water is a process that has attracted much attention due to its high energy conversion efficiency.2 So far, Pt-based catalysts have been generally considered as the most effective HER electrocatalysts3,4 while their commercialization was largely hindered by the high cost and limited supply of Pt. Many research efforts have been devoted to the search of non-precious-metal based HER catalysts in the past decades. Particularly, earth-abundant 3d transition metals (TMs) such as Fe, Co, and Ni have been demonstrated as promising catalytic materials for HER in alkaline electrolytes.5–10 However, 3d TMs are not stable in acids and therefore exclude their application in an acidic solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), which is considered to be more efficient and exquisite for HER compared with the alkaline electrolyser.11 In recent years, molybdenum-based materials, such as MoS2,12–19 MoSe2,14,20 Mo2C,21,22 MoB,22 MoS2 analogues,23 NiMoNx,24 and Co0.6Mo1.4N2,25 have evolved as possible alternatives for HER in acidic electrolytes, while the durability of Mo-based catalysts is still not satisfactory when they suffer strongly acidic electrolytes under the long-time operation or accelerated degradation measurements.
Recently, we demonstrated that encapsulated non-precious metals in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can activate O2 on the outer carbon surface while the encapsulated metal nanoparticles are protected by the carbon layer from being leached in the acidic medium.26,27 Inspired by this, we now designed robust and highly efficient HER electrocatalysts by using N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) encapsulating 3d TM Fe, Co and FeCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. These catalysts exhibited high activity and long-term durability towards HER in acidic electrolytes. In combination with DFT calculations, we further investigated the nature of active sites and the mechanism of the HER process in this system.
3d TM Fe, Co and FeCo alloy NPs were encapsulated within the NCNTs through a CVD method. Briefly, pyridine, as the carbon and nitrogen source, was bubbled via Ar onto 3d TM metal NPs supported on MgO, which serve as the catalysts to form NCNT encapsulating metal NPs at 700 °C. Subsequently, acid treatment was used to remove the MgO support and metals exposed outside NCNTs (see Experimental section in the ESI† for more details). The corresponding samples using supported Fe, Co or FeCo alloy NPs as the catalysts were denoted as Fe@NCNTs, Co@NCNTs and FeCo@NCNTs, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 1a) shows the tubular morphology of FeCo@NCNTs, and the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of the corresponding region shows that metal NPs of ca. 5–10 nm in diameter have been encapsulated in CNTs (Fig. 1b), which was further confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. S1a and S1b†). The high resolution (HR) TEM image (Fig. 1c) shows that the metal NPs were completely coated by the graphitic carbon shells with a layer distance of 3.4 Å and no NPs were observed outside the NCNTs. These NPs exhibit a d spacing of 2.03 Å, corresponding to the (110) plane of the FeCo alloy. The elemental mapping image of metal NPs by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed that the distribution of Fe and Co in NPs is homogeneous (Fig. S1d†), consistent with the characterization of X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1d) showing the structural pattern of FeCo alloys. The metallic character of these NPs provides another piece of evidence that the FeCo NPs were completely encapsulated inside the NCNTs, preventing the oxidation of the metal when exposed to air. Likewise, the encapsulation of metallic Fe or Co NPs was also confirmed for Fe@NCNTs and Co@NCNTs catalysts (Fig. S2 and S3†).

The typical three-electrode setup was adopted to assess the electrocatalytic HER activities of these NCNT encapsulating metal catalysts in 0.1 M H2SO4. As a reference, we also carried out the measurements of CNTs and commercial 40% Pt/C electrocatalysts. The polarization curves showed that all these catalysts exhibited much higher HER activities than pristine CNTs including both single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) and multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) as well as N-doped MWCNTs (MWCNTs–NH) in Fig. 2a and S6a.† The HER catalytic activity of Fe@NCNTs, Co@NCNTs and FeCo@NCNTs increased sequentially, and the polarization curve of FeCo@NCNTs showed an onset overpotential of ∼110 mV vs. RHE, beyond which the cathodic current rose rapidly under more negative potentials.
Previous studies indicated that nitrogen in metal/carbon composites could significantly promote catalytic reactions, e.g. the oxygen reduction reaction.26–30 To study the role of doped nitrogen atoms for HER, we introduced NH3 during the preparation of electrocatalysts to increase the concentration of nitrogen. These corresponding catalysts are denoted as Fe@NCNTs–NH, Co@NCNTs–NH, and FeCo@NCNTs–NH, respectively (see Experimental section in the ESI† for more details). Note that, from electron microscopies, these electrocatalysts appear similar to the above electrocatalysts prepared without NH3. Chemical composition analysis (Table S1†) showed that the nitrogen concentrations in Fe@NCNTs–NH, Co@NCNTs–NH and FeCo@NCNTs–NH have all increased compared with the corresponding samples prepared without NH3. Fig. S6a† indicates that the increase of N concentration in these serial catalysts can enhance the HER activity distinctively compared with the corresponding samples without NH3 treatment. Remarkably, FeCo@NCNTs–NH showed a very high HER activity with an onset overpotential of only ∼70 mV vs. RHE (Fig. 2a), which is amongst the smallest overpotential for non-precious-metal HER catalysts in acidic electrolytes reported so far (see the statistical results in Table S2†). These results indicate that the introduction of nitrogen in CNT-encapsulated metal catalysts can significantly enhance their HER activity.

(c) Potential values recorded initially and after every 1000 CV sweeps from the polarization curves of durability measurements for FeCo@NCNTs and FeCo@NCNTs–NH at 1 mA cm−2, 5 mA cm−2, and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. (d) Tafel plots for FeCo@NCNTs, FeCo@NCNTs–NH and 40% Pt/C, respectively. 
Durability is another critical measurement in the evaluation of non-precious-metal HER electrocatalysts. In this study, accelerated degradation measurements were adopted to evaluate the durability. The polarization curve was recorded after every 2000 cyclic voltammetric (CV) sweeps between +0.77 and −0.18 V (vs. RHE). As in Fig. 2b, the polarization curve of FeCo@NCNTs after 10000 cycles retained an almost similar performance to the initial test. The same trend could be observed for FeCo@NCNTs–NH (Fig. S6b†). Moreover, from the potential values recorded at the same current density of 1 mA cm−2, 5 mA cm−2, and 10 mA cm−2 before and after the test, both FeCo@NCNTs and FeCo@NCNTs–NH exhibited high durability with only a slight increase at the overpotential (Fig. 2c). To our knowledge, the long-term durability demonstrated in our measurements is rarely seen or reported for non-precious-metal HER catalysts in acidic media. The high activity combined with remarkable durability of these catalysts illustrates the potential of CNT-encapsulated non-precious metal catalysts for HER.
To understand the reaction mechanism of HER occurred on CNT-encapsulated metal catalysts, Tafel slopes, determined for the rate-limiting step of HER, were used to interpret possible elementary steps involved.31,32 The Tafel slopes for these catalysts are ca. 70–120 mV per decade (Fig. 2d and S7†), e.g. 78 mV per decade for Co@NCNTs (Fig. S7†) and 72 mV per decade for FeCo@NCNTs (Fig. 2d), in the range reported by previous studies on non-precious-metal HER catalysts.12–15,20–22,33–40 These Tafel slope values suggest that HER on CNT-encapsulated metal catalysts would likely occur via a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.22,24,41
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to understand the origin of the HER activity of these CNT-encapsulated metal catalysts. It has been demonstrated that the adsorption free energy of H (ΔG(H*)) is a good descriptor of HER on a broad range of catalytic materials.12 The relationship between ΔG(H*) and measured currents presents a volcano curve, meaning a catalyst with moderate adsorption free energy (ΔG(H*) ≈ 0) could be a good candidate for HER.42 ΔG(H*) on the carbon surface of pristine CNTs encapsulating an Fe4 cluster (Fe@CNTs) and N-doped CNTs encapsulating an Fe4 cluster (Fe@NCNTs) are presented in Table 1. Though the sizes of metal particles adopted in the calculations are smaller than that observed experimentally (Fig. S8†), the essential effect can still be captured by the simple geometry adopted here.26 After the introduction of the enclosed Fe4 cluster, ΔG(H*) on carbon decreases remarkably from 1.29 eV to 0.30 eV. Meanwhile, we also calculated ΔG(H*) on the outer surfaces of CNTs encapsulating a Co4 cluster (Co@CNTs) and an Fe2Co2 cluster (FeCo@CNTs) (Table S3†), i.e. 0.18 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively, which are even lower compared with that on Fe@CNTs, implying that the introduction of Co is more efficient for HER, consistent with the experimental results. Upon introducing an N atom into the carbon lattice of Fe@CNTs, ΔG(H*) further decreases to −0.05 eV. Therefore, nitrogen doping and an enclosed metal cluster can significantly promote hydrogen adsorption on CNTs synergistically.

The interaction between adsorbed H and carbon sites of Fe@CNTs is mainly covalent. The adsorption of the H atom on pristine CNTs is thermodynamically unfavored owing to the inertness of CNT walls. Our previous study showed that the electronic structure near the Fermi level of CNTs can be significantly modified by the iron cluster due to the charge transfer from iron to carbon atoms nearby.26 In this study, the band center of the occupied states of the C–H bond (sum of C2p and H1s) on Fe@CNTs is located in a lower energy regime than that on pristine CNTs (Fig. 3a), indicating that a stronger H–C chemical bonding can be formed on the carbon surface of Fe@CNTs. The electronic state structure analysis reveals that the stabilization of H* species in the HER process may originate from the enriched charge density of carbon atoms near the iron cluster (Fig. S9†) as well as nitrogen dopants.

The gray balls represent C atoms, yellow for Fe, blue for N, red for O and white for H. 
It is generally agreed that three elementary steps are involved for HER in acidic media.31,32 The first step is that a proton combines with an electron to form an adsorbed H atom, also known as the Volmer reaction (eqn (1)). The adsorbed H atom has two possible routes to form the H2 molecule and sequentially desorb, i.e. to react with a hydrated proton from the electrolyte meanwhile receiving an electron from the CNT surface, or to combine directly with another adsorbed H atom. The former reaction is called the Heyrovsky mechanism (eqn (2)) and the latter is known as the Tafel mechanism (eqn (3)). H3O+ + e− + * → H* + H2O(1) H3O+ + e− + H* → H2 + H2O(2) H* + H* → H2(3)where the * denotes an active site on the catalyst.
DFT calculations were also used to derive the reaction mechanism. The free energy profiles along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) are shown in Fig. 3b and c. The activation barrier of Fe@CNTs for the Heyrovsky reaction is 1.02 eV, which is much lower than that of the Tafel reaction (2.44 eV) as shown in Fig. 3b. It indicates that the predominant route of HER in this catalytic system is via the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, consistent with the analysis suggested by the experimentally measured Tafel slopes as indicated above. Moreover, from the free energy profiles of the Heyrovsky route for pristine CNTs, Fe@CNTs and Fe@NCNTs (Fig. 3c), the HER can hardly happen on pristine CNTs unless at a very high overpotential, due to the thermodynamically unflavored formation of the H* intermediate. In contrast, the HER can easily take place on Fe@CNTs and Fe@NCNTs by stabilizing the H* species.
In summary, 3d non-precious TM catalysts encapsulated in N-doped CNTs have been prepared through a simple CVD method, and the concentration of nitrogen could be modulated during the preparation of catalysts. These catalysts exhibited remarkable catalytic performance towards HER in acidic electrolytes. The optimized FeCo@NCNTs–NH catalyst showed an onset overpotential of only ∼70 mV vs. RHE, which is amongst the smallest overpotentials of non-precious-metal HER catalysts in an acidic electrolyte reported so far. Furthermore, these catalysts also showed a long-term durability during the 10000 cycles of accelerated degradation measurements. DFT calculations indicate that the adsorption free energy of the H atom on CNTs can be decreased by the enclosed metal cluster and N-dopants, implying that the introduction of metal and nitrogen in these catalysts can synergistically enhance the HER activity in accordance with the experimental results. Further calculations of free energy profiles along with the intrinsic reaction coordinate indicate that the HER would likely occur through a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism in this system. These findings provide a new route in the design of efficient and durable non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for HER.

Broader context
The electrolysis of water to hydrogen is recognized as a front-running technology for energy storage and conversion from renewable sources such as solar and wind powers. One of the key reactions for this technology, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is currently high-cost due to the massive use of precious Pt-based catalysts. It is urgent to employ low-cost and earth-abundant materials to replace precious-metal catalysts in order to make this technology become more economical. However, most non-precious metals, especially very abundant 3d transition metals, are not stable in acidic medium, usually leading to a severely degraded activity. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for non-precious-metal catalysts with high activity and long-term durability towards HER via encapsulating Fe, Co and FeCo alloy into N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). In this system, these 3d metals are protected by the carbon wall around them, and thereby do not directly contact with the acidic electrolyte, while the exotic activity for HER originates from electron transfer from the metals, which further modifies the electronic structure of the carbon surface. This work paves a new route in the design of efficient and durable non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for HER in acidic medium.
