Broader context
The effectiveness in deploying renewable energy is critical to maintain the sustainable development of society. Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit great promise as a next generation photovoltaic technology to power up society. Whereas, although appearing to be feasible for upscale fabrication, a persistent challenge is that inverted PSCs generally suffer from an inferior photovoltaic performance to that of conventional ones. One of the bottlenecks is the nonideal carrier dynamics at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. For instance, capping two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers atop 3D perovskites, although helps achieve environmental stability, could hinder electron extraction and deteriorate device performances of inverted PSCs. Herein, a unique approach via interfacial ligand confinement was developed for constructing finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskite structures to obtain efficient and stable inverted PSCs and modules. This revealed that the diamine masking reagent atop 3D perovskites can regulate cation exchange via hydrogen bonding to result in the formation of a finite and dense 2D layer, which is beneficial not only to accomplish top-contact passivation but also to enhance electron extraction at electron selective contact. As a result, inverted PSCs and modules with finite 2D/3D perovskites achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.7% and 21.6% (certified PCE of 21.2%), respectively, representing one of the best-performing inverted mini-module reported so far.

Introduction
The effectiveness in deploying clean energy technologies is critical to maintain the sustainable development of society. It is witnessed that solar photon-to-electron conversion via photovoltaics has a growing impact on powering up societies. In recent years, multi-dimensional lead halide perovskites have enabled perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve 25% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),1–5 exhibiting great potentials in the next generation photovoltaic technology.6,7 Wherein, capping two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers atop 3D perovskites via cation exchange between ammonium ions has been found to improve the performance of PSCs, mainly the conventional architecture, as 2D layers mitigate surface defeats of perovskites and block electron back-transport to the hole transport layer (HTL).8–11 However, for inverted PSCs, the presence of top-capping 2D layers could hinder electron extraction from the perovskite to the electron transport layer (ETL), due to bulk cation assisted quantum-well energetics of 2D perovskites, usually resulting in an inferior fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of inverted PSCs.12–14 It is a challenge for inverted PSCs that appear to be feasible for upscale manufacture, while suffering from inferior performance compared to the conventional PSCs. Efforts have been devoted to tailoring the dimensionality of top-capping perovskites via introducing different bulk cations.2,4,15,16 Despite different bulky ammonium ligands and processing conditions being studied, there is still a strong need to explore methods that allow constructing 2D/3D perovskite hierarchical structures with finite dimensionality and depth distribution of top-capping 2D perovskites. In inverted PSCs, a high population of photo-charge carriers is generated near the HTL at the front transparent electrode, wherein electrons need to travel a long path before being collected by the ETL, resulting in carrier losses.17–20 There is an urgent need to explore effective methodologies that allow elevating performances of inverted PSCs.
Herein, we develop an interfacial ligand confinement approach for constructing a finite 2D/3D perovskite hierarchical structure that enables achieveing efficient inverted perovskite solar cells and modules. It has been revealed for the first time that the introduction of ethylene diamine (EDA), as a masking reagent situated atop 3D perovskites, can regulate the formation of a finite top-capping 2D perovskite layer. We have disclosed that primary amines interact with ammonium cations via hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), which is effective in not only confining the depth distribution of phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) in 3D perovskites, but also mediating the cation exchange of PEA with formamidinium (FA) and methyl ammonium (MA) on 2D perovskite formation. Interestingly, the resulting perovskite hierarchical structure with a finite 2D layer is beneficial for achieving efficient electron extraction at electron selective contact, while accomplishing top-contact passivation to mitigate the photovoltage-loss of inverted PSCs (Fig. 1a). In addition, Lewis base EDA allows chemical doping of the contacted [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to enhance electron transport of the fullerene ETL (Fig. 1b).

(c) Ligand confinement leads to performance improvement of inverted PSCs with different perovskites and passivation ligands (left) and helps in obtaining the best-performing inverted minimodules reported so far (red pentagram marks). 
As a result, high-performance inverted PSCs are achieved with a remarkable PCE of 24.7% and an excellent open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20 V. The encapsulated devices have retained over 90% of the original efficiency after over 1000 hours of exposure under one sun equivalent illumination. Notably, this ligand confinement approach works well with different perovskites with various passivation ligands, leading to performance improvement of medium-band gap and wide-band gap PSCs. Furthermore, large-area inverted modules have been feasibly fabricated with the ligand confinement approach, achieving a certified PCE of 21.2%, representing the best-performing inverted minimodule reported so far (Fig. 1c and Table S1, ESI†).
Results and discussion
2D perovskites are frequently introduced atop 3D perovskites as capping layers to improve the environmental stability of PSCs, typically accomplished through a direct cation exchange between bulk ammonium with formamidinium and methyl ammonium in 3D perovskites.9–11,21–23 This usually leads to the formation of 2D/3D hierarchical perovskites in an uncontrolled fashion, presenting an inhomogeneous perovskite hierarchical structure with a non-ideal energy landscape for inverted PSCs. We have previously developed a series of interfacial materials, including self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),24 HTLs,25–27 and ETLs28 to mediate the heterointerface between perovskites and electrode inverted PSCs and modules.29 This accumulated knowledge promoted us to further explore the inhomogeneous heterointerface between 2D and 3D perovskites. We propose an interfacial ligand confinement approach to construct 2D/3D hierarchical perovskites. Briefly, before the coating of PEABr, a primary diamine of EDA is first introduced as a masking reagent atop 3D perovskites, which interacts with ammonium via H-bonding, and coordinates to lead ions through Lewis acid–base interaction. Hence, the presence of EDA helps confining the cation exchange between PEA and FA/MA, thus regulating the in situ growth of 2D perovskite layers (for instance, PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n−1Br2) atop 3D perovskites.
H-bonding interaction between EDA and ammonium is revealed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H-NMR). As shown in Fig. 2a, the MAI in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) shows two proton peaks, methyl (–CH3) at a chemical shift (δ) of 2.37 ppm and ammonium (–NH3+) at 7.49 ppm. Whereas, the pristine EDA shows the primary amine (–NH2) at a δ of 1.25 ppm, and methylene (–CH2–) at 2.47 ppm. Interestingly, after adding an equivalent EDA amount into the MAI solution, the signal of ammonium protons significantly upshifted from 7.49 to 4.05 ppm, accompanying the disappearance of EDA amine proton signals. These changes could be attributed to the formation of H-bonding between amine and ammonium.30 Similar H-bonding interactions were also observed between EDA and FAI, as well as PEA ammoniums. These H-bonding interactions influence the cation exchange of PEA with FA and MA, hence mediating 2D perovskite formation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) further reveals the presence of Lewis acid–base interaction between EDA and PbI2 (Fig. 2b), wherein the N–H stretching vibration of EDA shifts from 3292 to 3282 cm−1 when mixed with PbI2. The interaction of EDA with perovskites is also observed from the shifts of core level signals of Pb 4f and I 3d by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. S1, ESI†). In addition, alkyl amines, such as EDA, are chemical reductants for the classic electron acceptors, like PCBM, which allow pumping of electrons into fullerene in close contact. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements display the generation of fullerene radical anions in the EDA/PCBM blend with strong paramagnetic signals (Fig. 2c). The n-doping effect allows for the enhancement of the electron transport of fullerene ETLs.31

The presence of interactions between EDA and ammonium, as well as lead iodide and PCBM, leads to a significant change in interfacial properties of inverted PSCs. On this basis, we have prepared different types of perovskite films. Pristine 3D perovskites Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3, were fabricated without EDA and PEABr treatments (hereafter noted as 3D), and 2D/3D hierarchical perovskites were obtained through surface cation exchange of 3D perovskites with PEABr (as 2D/3D). And finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskites were obtained in the presence of EDA confinement during cation exchange (as finite 2D/3D). Details can be found in the ESI.† Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2, ESI†) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†) disclose the energy level alignment of the 3D, 2D/3D, and finite 2D/3D perovskite films, showing that the work function (WF) of 3D perovskites (4.95 eV) is downshifted relative to that of 2D/3D (4.75 eV) and finite 2D/3D (4.68 eV). The downshift of the WF near the electron-selective contact is beneficial to generate a favorable band bending for electron extraction.32–34 Surface Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements also confirmed the downshift of the WF, as surface potential varied from 3D (−230 mV) to 2D/3D (−197 mV) and finite 2D/3D (−187 mV). Meanwhile, the Femi level (EF) of the top surface shifted upwards relative to the valence band from 3D perovskites (0.48 eV) to 2D/3D perovskites (0.82 eV) and the finite 2D/3D perovskites (0.90 eV). The rising EF levels on the electron-contact side would be helpful in mitigating the photovoltage losses of PSCs.32,33,35 These results reveal that the finite 2D/3D hierarchical structures through EDA confinement possess the favorable energy landscape near the electron-extraction contact of inverted PSCs.
Inverted PSCs were first fabricated with the following architecture: ITO/NiOx/PTAA/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a, the inverted PSCs with medium-band gap 3D perovskites, Cs0.05(FA0.95MA0.05)0.95Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3 exhibit a PCE of 19.2% with a JSC of 24.5 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.11 V and an FF of 70.5%. After introducing PEABr for 2D perovskite passivation,36 the 2D/3D perovskites enable inverted PSCs with an improved PCE of 21.1% with a VOC of 1.17 V and an FF of 76.0%. Such performance improvement can be expected by introducing a 2D perovskite layer atop 3D perovskites, while resulting in a relatively decreased JSC value compared to that of pristine 3D perovskites which indicates that the presence of uncontrolled 2D layers prevents electron extraction to the ETL. Based on the above-observed interactions between EDA and ammoniums, we have prepared finite 2D/3D perovskite films via ligand confinement. A thin EDA layer is first introduced atop 3D perovskites before the cation exchange among ammoniums for the growth of 2D layers. Notably, the inverted PSCs containing finite 2D/3D perovskites have achieved significant enhancements in photovoltaic performance, with an increased VOC of 1.20 V and FF of 81.9%, resulting in a remarkable PCE of 24.7%.

In addition, reference devices with only EDA modification of 3D perovskites were also prepared and a PCE of 22.7% was achieved with a VOC of 1.16 V (Fig. S4, ESI†). Among these studied devices, the finite 2D/3D devices show the best performance with the highest VOC values, indicating that the presence of EDA can not only regulate the growth of 2D passivation layers, but also can shift up the Fermi level of the perovskite layer to optimize the photovoltage. Meanwhile, the chemical doping of PCBM with EDA results in the improvement of free carrier density of the fullerene layer to enhance electron transport capabilities. Therefore, the finite 2D/3D perovskites are beneficial for achieving efficient electron extraction at electron selective contact, while accomplishing top-contact passivation for perovskites in inverted PSCs. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Their integrated JSC values from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are consistent with the experimental values (Fig. 3b). The steady-state power outputs (SPOs) remain steady as a function of time at the maximum power point under one sun illumination (Fig. S5, ESI†). More importantly, this ligand confinement approach allows feasible application to the fabrication of scale-up solar modules. As shown in Fig. 3c, large-area inverted perovskite modules with a series of 7 sub-cells have been successfully demonstrated with excellent PCEs up to 21.6% with an aperture area of 19.30 cm2 under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). These modules were certified to have a PCE of 21.2% from the Chinese National Photovoltaic Industry Metrology and Testing Center (NPVM) (Fig. S6, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, this result herein represents the best-performing inverted perovskite mini-modules (below 50 cm2) so far.

The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), with negligible difference between forward and reverse scanning. It is also worth noting that this ligand confinement approach has a positive effect on the improvement of photovoltaic performance of various perovskite components ranging from medium to wide-band gaps (Fig. 3e and f and Tables S2, S3, ESI†). The operational lifetime at MPP of the encapsulated 3D and finite 2D/3D PSCs was tested under continuous one sun equivalent illumination in ambient atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 3g, finite 2D/3D PSCs show excellent operational stability and retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after over 1000 hours of illumination, whereas 3D PSCs exhibit fast decay in performance at around 400 h which is likely due to the ease of ion diffusion across the non-passivated 3D perovskites to degrade interface and electrodes. And the thermal stabilities of finite 2D/3D PSCs were revealed to maintain steady performance under constant heating for nearly 120 hours at 60 °C in a glovebox (Fig. S7, ESI†).
To understand the large difference in photovoltaic properties, we have systematically investigated the morphologies of perovskite hierarchical structures, revealing that the interfacial EDA treatment helps simultaneously confine the dimensionality and thickness of top-capping 2D perovskites. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements illustrate that the 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit typical 2D diffraction peaks at scattering vector q values of 0.38 and 0.29 Å−1 along the z direction, which indicates that the 2D perovskite crystal plane is parallel to the substrate (corresponding to n = 1 and 2, respectively37–39). And such 2D diffraction peaks were absent in the pristine 3D perovskite films. Whereas, such arrangement of 2D perovskites is non-ideal for vertical charge transport in inverted PSCs.21,40–42 Interestingly, the finite 2D/3D perovskite films showed much-lowered intensities of 2D perovskite crystals (Fig. S8, ESI†). And the result is also consistent with that of PL measurements (Fig. S9, ESI†) that the intensity of the PL peak at around 560 nm (attributed to 2D perovskite, n = 2) in the finite 2D/3D perovskites is decreased when compared to 2D/3D perovskites.

Meanwhile, their surface morphologies were examined with a scanning electron microscope (Fig. 4d–f), showing that the finite 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit a compact top surface with few pin-holes, which are superior to those of 3D and 2D/3D perovskite films. These results indicate that the presence of EDA can regulate the growth of 2D perovskites, to form a thin and dense 2D passivation layer. Such a finite 2D/3D perovskite hierarchical structure was also identified by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) measurements, revealing the narrow and sharp distribution of PEA moieties in finite 2D/3D perovskites (Fig. 4g–i). 2D/3D perovskite films displayed a relatively broad distribution of PEA moieties in layers. In addition, with silver directly deposited atop perovskites, the silver layer shows a clear interface with the finite 2D/3D perovskite layer, indicating the presence of a dense perovskite top surface. However, the silver atop 3D perovskites shows a non-clear interface, due to the presence of pin-holes for the non-passivated 3D perovskites. To understand the charge extraction of perovskite hierarchical structures, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments for PCBM/perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S10 and Table S4 (ESI†), the average PL decay lifetime (τ) of the finite 2D/3D perovskite (17.41 ns) is much faster than that of the 3D and 2D/3D perovskites (84.35 ns and 72.44 ns). This indicates that an efficient and fast charge extraction occurs from finite 2D/3D perovskites to PCBM, which is consistent with the optimal energy landscape and photovoltaic results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed herein a unique approach via interfacial ligand confinement for constructing finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskite structures to obtain efficient and stable inverted PSCs and modules. For the first time, it has been revealed that the diamine masking reagent atop 3D perovskites interacts with ammonium via H-bonding interaction, hence regulating the cation exchange and distribution on the formation of a finite and dense 2D passivation layer. It is beneficial not only to form top-contact passivation of 3D perovskites, but also to enhance the electron extraction at electron selective contact. As a result, inverted PSCs with finite 2D/3D perovskites have achieved a remarkable PCE of 24.7% and an excellent VOC of 1.20 V. Furthermore, inverted modules have been feasibly obtained with an excellent PCE of 21.6% (certified as 21.2%), representing one of the best-performing inverted mini-module reported so far. It is also worth noting that Microquanta, research partner of this work, has recently launched commercial-sized perovskite modules (1245 mm × 635 mm × 6.4 mm).43 Overall, this work presents an effective approach that would be helpful for further advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward the role of sustainable clean energy sources.

Broader context
The effectiveness in deploying renewable energy is critical to maintain the sustainable development of society. Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit great promise as a next generation photovoltaic technology to power up society. Whereas, although appearing to be feasible for upscale fabrication, a persistent challenge is that inverted PSCs generally suffer from an inferior photovoltaic performance to that of conventional ones. One of the bottlenecks is the nonideal carrier dynamics at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface. For instance, capping two-dimensional (2D) perovskite layers atop 3D perovskites, although helps achieve environmental stability, could hinder electron extraction and deteriorate device performances of inverted PSCs. Herein, a unique approach via interfacial ligand confinement was developed for constructing finite 2D/3D hierarchical perovskite structures to obtain efficient and stable inverted PSCs and modules. This revealed that the diamine masking reagent atop 3D perovskites can regulate cation exchange via hydrogen bonding to result in the formation of a finite and dense 2D layer, which is beneficial not only to accomplish top-contact passivation but also to enhance electron extraction at electron selective contact. As a result, inverted PSCs and modules with finite 2D/3D perovskites achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.7% and 21.6% (certified PCE of 21.2%), respectively, representing one of the best-performing inverted mini-module reported so far.
