    , Accepted 22nd May 2019First published on 22nd May 2019AbstractA near-infrared absorbing chromophore has broad prospects as a photoacoustic imaging/photothermal agent due to its simple chemical structure, high purity and good biocompatibility. But its development is severely limited due to low photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal instability. Hence, a donor–acceptor chromophore containing 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole as an electron acceptor and triphenylamine as an electron donor is synthesized, and encapsulated in Pluronic F127 to fabricate organic nanoparticles for PA imaging and PTT application. The yielded organic nanoparticles possess near infrared absorption, high photostability, good biocompatibility, and high photothermal conversion efficiency (38%). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that organic nanoparticles show good performances in PA imaging and photothermal ablation of tumors, and are candidates for PAI/PTT agents.
Introduction
With the rapid growth and aging of the global population, the morbidity and mortality of cancer are growing rapidly.1 However, traditional clinical tumor therapy methods, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery, have serious side effects.2,3 Therefore, it is urgent to develop new non-invasive tumor therapies with fewer side effects. As one of the non-invasive therapies for tumors, photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its advantages such as low toxicity, high selectivity, low drug resistance, fewer side effects and high tumor destruction efficiency.4–6 PTT depends to a large extent on the photothermal agents, which transform the absorbed near-infrared light into heat to ablate the tumor.7 Interestingly, photothermal agents are also contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Compared to traditional imaging technologies such as optical imaging, MRI imaging, and CT imaging, photoacoustic imaging possesses some advantages including nonionizing radiation, low acoustic scattering, high depth-to-resolution ratio and sensitivity, background-free, and speckle-free features, and multiscale capacity.8,9 Moreover, PAI can also provide functional and structural information from biological tissues and achieve visual monitoring of deep tumors in preclinical and clinical studies.10
To date, most of the currently available photothermal agents for PTT and PAI are inorganic materials, including metal nanomaterials (e.g., Au, Pd, and Ag nanodots),11–18 carbon nanomaterials (e.g., graphene and carbon nanotubes),19–25 and transition metal chalcogenides (e.g., CuS, Ag2S, MoS2 and WS2).26–32 These inorganic materials have good stability and high photothermal conversion efficiency, but exhibit poor metabolism and high toxicity. Organic small molecules (e.g., squaraine dye, indocyanine green, porphyrin, perylenediimide, bodipy, and diketopyrrolopyrrole-triphenylamine) have attracted attention because of their excellent biocompatibility and rapid metabolism.33–39 However, organic small molecules usually transfer the absorbed NIR light to fluorescence or reactive oxygen species, resulting in the decrease of PAI/PTT efficiency and low thermal stability. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new PAI/PTT agents with high photothermal conversion efficiency, good biocompatibility and photostability.
Nanomedicine holds great potential for developing safe and targeted strategies against solid tumors, and providing novel ideas for drug delivery and drug release in cancer treatment.40–43 In recent years, organic nanoparticles based on NIR absorbing organic small molecules or semiconducting polymers containing donor–acceptor (D–A) electron structures have been developed for PAI/PTT agents on account of high NIR absorption coefficient, excellent photostability and good biocompatibility.44–51 A series of electron acceptors were developed to fabricate the D–A structural NIR absorbing dyes which are very effective in producing strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and a low band gap, resulting in strong NIR absorbance. For example, Qi prepared thiadiazoloquinoxaline based organic small molecular nanoparticles which showed promising applications in PAI/PTT.52 Typically, it is well-known that the effective way to red shift the absorption and emission of a fluorophore is to increase its D–A effect and/or extend the conjugate chain length. Dong fabricated semiconducting polymer nanoparticles containing thienoisoindigo as an acceptor with strong NIR absorbance, which are utilized for PA imaging and PTT of tumors.53 Recently, 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole based dyes show strong intramolecular charge-transfer transitions and NIR absorbance.54 Burckstummer found that 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole based dyes exhibited a large dipole moment and successfully implemented them as active components for light harvesting as well as solar cells.55 However, to the best of our knowledge, the possibility of using 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole based dyes as PAI/PTT agents has not been explored.
Hence, we reported a novel 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole based NIR absorbing small molecular dye and fabricated nanoparticles for highly efficient PA imaging and photothermal therapy. The proposed strategy is shown in Scheme 1. NIR dye TPTHM was constructed by conjugation of 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole as the electron acceptor and the electron donor triphenylamine unit. Furthermore, water-dispersible nanoparticles, TPTHM NPs, were obtained by encapsulating TPTHM with the amphipahthic polymer Pluronic F127. TPTHM NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency, near infrared absorption, negligible dark toxicity, good biocompatibility and photostability. Finally, TPTHM NPs have been used for imaging-guided photothermal therapy in vitro and in vivo, showing excellent PAI performance and a tumor ablation effect. In general, this work demonstrated the potential of 2-dicyanomethylenethiazole based NIR absorbing organic nanoparticles in the application of PA imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors.

TPTHM NPs fabrication
TPTHM NPs were fabricated via a nanoprecipitation method by encapsulating TPTHM with Pluronic F-127. The mass ratio of F127/TPTHM was 10/1. Generally, Pluronic F-127 (200 mg) and TPTHM (20 mg) were added into THF (2 mL). After dissolving fully, the THF solution was added drop by drop into DI water (10 mL) under ultrasonic conditions. The mixture was treated with bubling N2 for 2 h to remove the THF completely. After that, the free F-127 was completely removed by dialysis to form the TPTHM NPs.
Calculation of photothermal conversion efficiency
The photothermal conversion efficiency of TPTHM NPs was calculated by measuring the temperature change of the NP aqueous dispersion as a function of time under continuous irradiation with an 808 nm laser (3.5 W cm−2) for 600 s (t) until the temperature of the solution reached a steady-state. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated by eqn (1), η = [hA(Tmax − Tsurr) − QDis]/[I(1 − 10−Aλ)](1)where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the area of the container, Tmax is the maximum steady-state temperature (61.3 °C), TSurr is the ambient temperature of the environment (32.6 °C), QDis represents the heat dissipation from the light absorbed by the solvent and the sample cell, I is the incident laser power (3.5 W cm−2), and Aλ is the absorbance of the sample at 808 nm (0.1235). The value of hA was calculated by eqn (2), hA = mDcD/τs(2)where τs is the time constant for the heat transfer in the system, which was accessed based on the measurements in Fig. S4 (ESI†) (τs = 162 s); and mD and cD are the mass (1 g) and heat capacity (4.2 J g−1) of DI water used to disperse the NPs, respectively. The photothermal conversion efficiency of TPTHM NPs was calculated to be 38%.
Cell culture
TPTHM NPs were diluted with culture medium to obtain a working solution for the subsequent cellular experiments. 4T1 cells were gifted from Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China), and cultured in 1640 culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
Animal model
Balb/c female mice (4 weeks old, about 20 g) were supplied by the Southern Medical University Animal Center. To prepare 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, 4T1 cells (4 × 105) in PBS (100 μL) were subcutaneously injected into the Balb/c female mice. When the volume of the tumor increased to about 80–140 mm3, the PAI and PTT experiments were carried out. All animal experiment procedures were carried out in compliance with the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the care regulations approved by the administrative committee of laboratory animals of Southern Medical University.

In vitro PAI
4T1 cells were seeded in a 25 cm2 culture bottle, with a density of 2.5 × 105. After attachment, the cells were incubated with 3 mL TPTHM NP solution (100 μM) at 37 °C for 12 h. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS buffer, detached by EDTA–trypsin, and resuspended with 1.5 mL hot agarose solution in a centrifuge tube. After cooling down, the PA images were monitored via an MSOT system.

In vitro PTT
The photothermal ablation of cancer cells was first investigated with the CCK-8 assay. 4T1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 5000 cells per well for 12 h. Then the culture medium was replaced by the gradient concentrated TPTHM NP solution. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h, the culture medium with NPs was removed and the cells were resupplied with fresh culture medium. The cells were irradiated with an 808 nm laser (3.5 W cm−2, the diameter of laser spot: 1 cm) for 0 and 10 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 12 h. Cell viability was measured using the CCK-8 assay according to the procedures in the product manual. The cell survival efficiency was further investigated using a calcein AM/PI Detection Kit. 4T1 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 50000 cells per well until attachment. The culture medium was discarded, followed by incubation with 400 μL TPTHM NP solution (200 μM) at 37 °C for 12 h. After incubation was completed, the cells were washed three times with PBS and resupplied with fresh culture medium. The cells were irradiated with an 808 nm laser (3.5 W cm−2, diameter of laser spot: 1 cm) for 0 and 10 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, a calcein AM/propidium iodide (PI) Detection Kit was used to stain the cells according to the manual. The fluorescence images were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer, Carl Zeiss).

In vivo PAI
The female mice bearing subcutaneous 4T1 tumor cells with a size of 80–140 mm3 were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen. Before and after the intratumoral injection of TPTHM NPs (100 μL, 2.5 mg kg−1)/water, the PA images of the tumor area were monitored via an MSOT system.

In vivo PTT
The tumors were allowed to reach a mean size of 80–140 mm3 before PTT treatment. The mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5), which received intratumor injections of different formulations for different treatments: (Group 1) PBS, (Group 2) TPTHM NPs, (Group 3) PBS + laser irradiation, and (Group 4) TPTHM NPs + laser irradiation. For Group 1 and Group 2, PBS and TPTHM NPs (100 μL, 2.5 mg kg−1)/water were injected into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice respectively, without further treatment. For Group 3 and Group 4, the tumors of mice were continously irradiated with an 808 nm laser (1 W cm−2) for 5 min after intravenous injection of PBS and TPTHM NPs (2.5 mg kg−1), respectively. After treatment, the tumor volume and body weight were recorded every other day. The tumor volume was calculated by (tumor volume = length × (width)2/2). The measured volume value was normalized to evaluate the tumor volume.
H&E staining analysis
After different treatments over 15 d, the mice were sacrificed and then the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and heart were collected for H&E staining. The major organs were placed in formalin and cryosectioned with 10 mm thickness onto slides and stained with H&E (KeyGen Biotech. Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Nanozoomer Digital Pathology scanner (NDPS60, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) was used to obtain images.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of TPTHM NPs
The synthesis of the targeted molecule TPTHM was carried out according to Scheme S1 (ESI†), starting with 4-(2-thiocyanatoacetyl)-benzonitrile prepared from 4-(2-bromoacetyl)-benzonitrile and KSCN. By reacting 4-(2-thiocyanatoacetyl)-benzonitrile with malononitrile in the presence of triethylamine, 2-(4-(4-cyanophenyl)-thiazol-2(5H)-ylidene)-malononitrile was obtained. Then the Knoevenagel reaction between 2-(4-(4-cyanophenyl)-thiazol-2(5H)-ylidene)-malononitrile and 4-(diphenylamino)-benzaldehyde was carried out to prepare the targeted product TPTHM. The detailed synthetic procedure and characterization data are shown in the Experimental section.
Due to the hydrophobic properties of TPTHM, TPTHM was encapsulated in Pluronic F127 to fabricate water-dispersible TPTHM nanoparticles (TPTHM NPs) by using a nanoprecipitation method. The size and morphology of TPTHM NPs were measured and recorded by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1A). TPTHM NPs show a spherical structure with an average diameter of ∼55 nm and a PDI of 0.236, which agrees with the DLS result. In addition, after storage at room temperature for 45 days, no obvious change in the absorption spectra, and TEM and DLS results of TPTHM NPs was observed (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating the good colloidal stability.
 Fig. 1  (A) Particle-size distribution of TPTHM NPs in water studied via the DLS experiment. (B) UV-vis absorption spectra of TPTHM NPs in water. 
According to the UV-visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 1B), TPTHM NPs show two absorption peaks at 696 nm and 758 nm, which belong to the near-infrared region. The shorter wavelength peak around 696 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of the molecular orbital, while the longer peak at 758 nm is ascribed to the ICT effect of TPTHM.57–59 Density functional theory (DFT) based on the DFT/B3LYP/6-311+(d,p) level Gaussian 09 program was carried out to optimize the structure of TPTHM (Fig. S5D, ESI†). The studies show that the HOMO–LUMO gap is 1.63 eV (Fig. S5C, ESI†). Meanwhile the mass extinction coefficient at 808 nm is 6175 L mol−1 cm−1, indicating the great potential of absorbing near-infrared light to allow PAI/PTT applications.
PTT and PAI performances of TPTHM NPs
The temperature of the TPTHM NP solution was monitored using a thermal imaging camera after constant 808 nm laser irradiation (Fig. 2) to evaluate the photothermal performance. The infrared thermal images are shown in Fig. 2A. It seems that the temperature of the TPTHM NP solution increases with the extension of the irradiation time. As shown in Fig. 2B, the temperature of the pure water group under 808 nm laser irradiation shows a very small increase of only 1.7 °C under the same irradiation conditions. In contrast, at a concentration of 40 μM, the temperature of the TPTHM NP solution could increase to 28 °C after 10 min laser irradiation (808 nm, 3.5 W cm−2), indicating the good photothermal conversion capability of TPTHM NPs. It can also be seen from Fig. 2C that the photothermal temperature of the TPTHM NP solution increases as the laser power increases. Furthermore, by using the reported method, the photothermal conversion efficiency of TPTHM NPs was determined to be 38% (Fig. S4, ESI†),60,61 which is much higher than that of the reported polymer NPs as well as inorganic nanomaterials.62–67

(B) Photothermal heating curves of TPTHM NPs at different concentrations (0–80 μM) under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation (3.5 W cm−2, 10 min) and (C) with different laser power densities at 40 μM. (D) Temperature variations of TPTHM NPs under irradiation at a power density of 3.5 W cm−2 for four laser on/off cycles (10 min of irradiation for each cycle). 
To further study the photothermal stability of TPTHM NPs, the apparent colors, absorption spectra, TEM and DLS of TPTHM NPs after continuous laser radiation (808 nm, 4 W cm−2) for 10 min were measured. As shown in Fig. S5A and B (ESI†), the optical properties and particle size of TPTHM NPs are almost constant over a 10 minute period of NIR light irradiation. Meanwhile, the photothermal conversion ability of TPTHM NPs shows negligible change during four cycles of heating and cooling processes (Fig. 2D). All these results confirm that TPTHM NPs possess high photothermal stability, and are promising candidates for PTT agents.
To evaluate the PAI effect of TPTHM NPs, a phantom study was performed at various TPTHM NPs concentrations by using a multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) system. The PA image and signal intensity of different phantoms are shown in Fig. 3A and B. TPTHM NPs exhibit an apparent PA signal and the PA intensity increases with an increase in the concentration. The PA spectrum of TPTHM NPs shows the maximal intensity around 760 nm, which agrees with the absorption profile (Fig. 3C).

PAI study in vitro and in vivo
Due to the excellent photophysical properties of TPTHM NPs, in vitro photoacoustic properties were further evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the 4T1 cells co-cultured with TPTHM NPs (100 μM, 12 h) exhibit an apparent PA signal, which is 9-fold brighter than for 4T1 cells. All these results confirm that TPTHM NPs can be internalized by 4T1 cells for intracellular photoacoustic imaging.

(D) PA signals of the 4T1 tumor model after intratumoral injection of TPTHM NPs (100 μL, 2.5 mg kg−1)/water. 
Then the in vivo photoacoustic properties of TPTHM NPs were measured by MSOT by intratumoral injection of TPTHM NPs into 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 4C and D, before injection (0 min), there is a weak PA signal caused by the oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin at 760 nm.68,69 The enhanced PA signal intensity in tumor was observed after injection of TPTHM NPs. For example, after injection (10 min), the PA signal in the tumor region significantly increases with a signal to background ratio of 3. The photoacoustic signal in the tumor area can still be observed after 120 minutes, indicating that the NPs can accumulate in the tumor tissue by the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect). These results reasonably reveal that TPTHM NPs can be an effective PA imaging contrast agent in vivo.
PTT study in vitro and in vivo
TPTHM NPs were then studied under PTT in vitro. The potential toxicity of TPTHM NPs to 4T1 cells was investigated using CCK-8 assays. 4T1 cells were incubated with TPTHM NPs for 12 h and then irradiated with an 808 nm laser (10 min, 3.5 W cm−2). As shown in Fig. 5A, the metabolic activities of the cells without NIR radiation treatment remain about 90% even upon incubating with 100 μM TPTHM NPs, indicating the low cytotoxicity of TPTHM NPs. In contrast, the metabolic activities of the cells stained with TPTHM NPs after NIR irradiation show an obvious decrease (Fig. 5B). For example, once the 4T1 cells are treated with 200 μM NPs, more than 80% of the 4T1 cells are killed under the PTT treatment conditions. At the same time, when only laser irradiation (NPs at a concentration of 0) was applied, the cell viability was maintained at about 95%, indicating that laser irradiation had little effect on cell viability.

(C) Bright field and fluorescence images of calcein AM (green, live cells) and PI (red fluorescence, dead cells) containing 4T1 cells treated with TPTHM NPs, 808 nm laser irradiation, and TPTHM NPs and 808 nm laser irradiation. 
Live/dead scanning experiments are carried out to directly visualize the intracellular phototherapeutic efficacy using a calcein AM/PI Detection Kit (green fluorescence for live cells and red fluorescence for dead cells). 4T1 cells are divided into three groups: treated with TPTHM NP co-culture, 808 nm laser irradiation and TPTHM NP co-culture and 808 nm laser radiation, then stained by calcein AM and PI. Obviously, cells treated only with TPTHM NPs or laser irradiation show obvious green fluorescence and almost no red fluorescence (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, 4T1 cells which are incubated with TPTHM NPs and subsequent 808 nm light irradiation exhibit dramatic apoptosis signals (strong red fluorescence). These results are consistent with the results of the CCK-8 assays, confirming that TPTHM NPs are biocompatible and have great potential for cancer photothermal ablation in vitro.
To confirm the in vivo photothermal effect of TPTHM NPs, the temperature changes in the tumor area were monitored by using an infrared thermal imager. As shown in Fig. 6A, the tumor temperature of mice injected with TPTHM NPs rapidly increases to 62 °C in 5 min under 808 nm laser irradiation. In contrast, the temperature of the tumor treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) under 808 nm laser irradiation shows a very small increase of only 1.9 °C under the same irradiation conditions. Then, the PTT capability of TPTHM NPs in vivo was examined using a subcutaneous 4T1 tumor-bearing mice model. 4T1 cells (5 × 106 cells per mouse) are subcutaneously implanted into Balb/c mice. When the tumor volume reaches approximately 80–140 mm3, the mice are randomly divided into four groups and treated with either injection of PBS, 808 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm−2), injection of TPTHM NPs or PTT treatment (808 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm−2) after injection of TPTHM NPs). The body weight and tumor size of mice under different treatment strategies are recorded every two days to evaluate the PTT efficiency in vivo up to 22 days (Fig. 6B and C). The mice receiving injections of TPTHM NPs in combination with laser radiation treatment exhibit prominent tumor suppression and complete tumor ablation. In contrast, the tumors of mice in the other three groups grow rapidly, indicating that laser radiation or injection of TPTHM NPs alone could not inhibit the tumor growth. Moreover, the mice in the PTT treatment group are tumor-free and survive for over 50 days without recrudescence in 22 d (Fig. 6D). In contrast, the tumor size of mice in the other three group grows rapidly and no mice survive after 39 d. The increase in mean life span of mice in the PTT treatment group provides valid evidence for the PTT efficacy of TPTHM NPs. In addition, Fig. 6E shows the photographs of tumor-bearing mice with four different treatment strategies representatively. The mice receiving PTT therapy show the most effective tumor suppression compared to the other three groups. These results further confirm the excellent PTT efficacy in vivo of TPTHM NPs. The body weight of all groups increases steadily and slowly, indicating the low toxicity during treatment. To further study the in vivo toxicity of TPTHM NPs, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain analysis in the main organs of the mice in all groups was employed. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), no obvious signs of inflammatory lesions or organ damage are observed, which further indicates that the TPTHM NPs have little side effects on mice. Overall, all these results confirm that TPTMH NPs have excellent PTT therapeutic ability and good biocompatibility.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel NIR absorbing D–A dye (TPTHM) was synthesized. The corresponding organic nanoparticles, TPTHM NPs, were fabricated and had high photothermal conversion efficiency (38%), near infrared absorption, high photostability and good biocompatibility, which are suitable for PTT in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TPTHM NPs exhibited a strong photoacoustic signal in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the TPTHM NPs are potential PAI/PTT agents. This research highlights the efficient strategy for developing promising PAI/PTT agents in advancing the field of bioimaging and further image-guided clinical applications.
