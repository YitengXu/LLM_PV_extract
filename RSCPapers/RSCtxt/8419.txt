    , Accepted 13th January 2021First published on 18th January 2021AbstractAqueous-based Zn–air and Al–air batteries are considered to be promising post-lithium energy storage technologies owing to their safety, environmental friendliness, affordability, and high energy density. Nevertheless, traditional liquid Zn–air and Al–air batteries have problems such as volatilization and leakage, as well as the realization of miniaturized, portable, and wearable electronic devices. The practice of optimizing the battery structure by replacing the flowing electrolyte with a solid type has emerged and made significant progress in the past ten years. Herein, this review provides a guiding and comprehensive summary of the basic understanding and manufacturing ideas of the solid electrolyte for Zn–air and Al–air batteries. First, two types of alkaline solid electrolytes are distinguished, including alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs) and gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). Then, three sorts of major framework materials (i.e., artificial organic polymer, biomass materials, and inorganic materials) are reviewed and discussed. Most importantly, the latest research progress and improvement strategies to enhance the electrolyte membrane performances involving conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability are also highlighted. Finally, challenges and prospects for the future development of alkaline solid electrolytes are emphasized.
1. Introduction
Batteries, which get rid of the Carnot limit of thermal power conversion, are the most efficient and practical energy conversion and storage devices.1,2 They have been widely used in various forms, such as small electronic devices and grid-scale energy storage,3 primary and secondary batteries,4 as well as single and hybrid batteries.5 In recent years, with the continuous progress of material science and energy technology, batteries are gradually changing from liquid to solid, which facilitated the wide utilization of flexible and wearable electronic devices in Frontier fields, such as folding screens, electronic papers, biosensors, and flexible circuit boards.6–9
Metal–air batteries (MABs) combine the advantages of portable traditional batteries and fuel cells with infinite oxygen supply, enabling extremely high theoretical energy density (approximately 2–10 times higher than the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)10). The metal anode can be Li, Na, K, Zn, Al, Mg, or Fe.11Fig. 1 (left) shows the proportions of the papers of common metal–air batteries from 2000 to 2020 years.
 Fig. 1  The proportions of the papers of common metal–air batteries (left) and papers of solid electrolytes in respective fields for ZABs and AABs (right) from 2000 to 2020 years from Web of Science. 
Among them, the top three in successive order are Li–air batteries (LABs), Zn–air batteries (ZABs) and Al–air batteries (AABs) (43%, 42% and 5%, respectively). LABs have become the most studied system for its ultra-high energy density. However, due to many side reactions near the Li anode, the decomposition of the organic electrolyte and the intermediate product, as well as the mandatory use of pure oxygen and the existence of high safety risks, LABs are still far from commercialization.12 On the other hand, aqueous ZABs and AABs with abundant resources, low cost, high safety, and high volumetric energy density surpassing far beyond LABs (only except for specific energy density) (Fig. 2) are becoming the most hopeful candidates for lithium battery technology.13,14 Therefore, this review chooses Zn–air and Al–air batteries for a detailed discussion.

Basically, the configurations and working principles (using a discharge process, for instance) of traditional Zn–air and Al–air batteries are similar (Fig. 3). The battery components include a metal anode, electrolyte, an air cathode, and a separator (because Al(OH)4− ions do not participate in the recharging circulation process and must be recycled, so there is usually no need for a separator to restrict their flow). During discharge, the metal anode loses electrons and is oxidized, forming hydroxides or oxides in an alkaline environment. The electrons flow through the external circuit to the air cathode, where O2 in the air is reduced and combined with water to form hydroxide ions (OH−). It is worth noting that since the potential of the Al3+/Al electrode is much lower than that of the H+/H2 electrode, Al–air batteries generally cannot be regenerated by electrical charging and only can be recharged mechanically, while Zn–air batteries can be charged either mechanically or electrically. The chemical reaction equations and standard electrode potentials of the two batteries are as follows:15

Traditional ZABs and AABs use flowing basic solutions as electrolytes, which will inevitably cause volatilization and leakage. Besides, the flowing electrolyte may penetrate over the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and hinder the mass transfer of oxygen, hugely degrading the performance and lifetime of the battery. The use of a solid electrolyte can solve the above problems, simultaneously acting as an electrolyte solution and a separator.16 It is able to not only store electrolyte and transport ions, but also have a certain mechanical strength to prevent an internal short circuit.17,18 This significantly simplifies the battery structure, while also meeting the demands for light, thin, and flexible wearable electronic devices.
In recent years, there have been numerous research studies on solid metal–air batteries, but its overall proportion is still deficient. Taking ZABs and AABs as examples, papers on solid batteries only account for 11% and 15%, respectively (Fig. 1 right), and most of which are concentrated on the cathode catalysts. Solid electrolytes, as a critical component of metal–air solid-state batteries, should be paid more attention.19,20
Commonly, the solid electrolyte of alkaline batteries needs to possess four basic characteristics: (1) dividing the positive and negative electrodes to restrain an internal short circuit; (2) carrying a rich pore structure to allow the anion to exchange between the two electrodes; (3) maintaining enough mechanical strength and chemical stability to endure the external tension and a strongly alkaline environment; (4) possessing high water absorption,21,22 because the ORR reaction requires water as a reactant, and water can dissolve OH− as the carrier. When the water content of the electrolyte is too low (i.e., 30%), alkali salts and metal hydroxides will more easily precipitate, which hinders the transport path of the ions and therefore burns the battery down.23 In addition, sufficient environmental and thermal stability are necessary for keeping the properties of the solid electrolyte.24,25
For solid ZABs and AABs, researchers generally utilize alkaline polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels as solid electrolytes because it is cheap, environment-friendly, and easy to fabricate.26–28 However, there lacks a standardized synthesis procedure. Different groups adopted their own preparation method and usually cannot obtain the PVA hydrogels with similar characteristics, making it difficult to compare the performance when assembling a battery. In addition, untreated PVA may have many problems, such as (1) low conductivity (10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1) due to insufficient hydrophilicity;29 (2) insufficient modulus and stretchability,30 which is unfavorable for practical application and smart devices; (3) unsatisfactory alkali resistance (only allowed to absorb 0.1–1.0 M KOH). The minimal alkaline content damages the battery output voltage and energy density;31 (4) poor water retention.32 The weight of the PVA hydrogel is only kept at 42% after being exposed to the air for 24 hours,33 suggesting the battery cannot be sustained for a couple of days, and is unable to meet market demands at all. Therefore, it is critical to discover other materials with better hydrophilic and mechanical capacities, as well as more stable electrochemical properties to obtain solid electrolytes for metal–air batteries.34 However, as far as we know, there are only reviews on solid electrolytes of supercapacitors,35–37 lithium-ion batteries,38 solar cells,39 or battery prototype design.40 No one has made a systematic description of the intrinsic properties of ZABs and AABs solid electrolytes.
Hence, this paper focuses on the framework materials and performance improvement strategies of alkaline solid electrolytes to deeply understand and upgrade the existing membrane technologies. In this manuscript, we first classify and introduce two types of alkaline solid electrolytes. Then, focusing on the ZABs and AABs, we shed light on the framework materials for solid electrolytes, i.e., artificial organic polymers, biomass materials, and inorganic materials, underlining the four artificial organic polymer frameworks involving PEO, PVA, PAA, and PAM that are widely utilized. Paper-based solid electrolytes are exclusively described in chapter 4 on biomass materials due to their unique properties and material novelty. Afterward, the current research status and promotion strategies of the performances on the conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stabilities of the solid electrolytes are discussed in detail. It is worth noting that for conductivity, the transport mechanism of OH− through the electrolyte membrane is emphasized so that readers can have a deep comprehension of how to enhance the conductivity in principle. Finally, the advanced developments in this field are summarized, followed by proposing future perspectives for alkaline solid-state batteries.
2. Categories of solid electrolytes
According to the phase structure of the ion conducting medium, the current solid electrolyte membrane mainly contains two types,41,42 one is the single-phase alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) with hydroxide ion (OH−) transport groups on the matrix; the other is the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) in which the alkaline electrolyte is stored in inert matrix materials. What should be clarified here is that since the GPE contains mobile electrolyte phases, it should technically be referred to as a quasi-solid electrolyte. Actually, however, for all of the alkaline aqueous solid electrolyte, there always exists more or less water as the conduction medium of OH− to achieve a satisfactory conductivity. Therefore, it is not necessary to make a strict distinction, and for the sake of simplicity, we called them for short as solid electrolytes in subsequent discussions. The schematic diagram of the two solid electrolytes is shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the two solid electrolytes: AAEM (left) and GPE (right). 
Alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs) are membranes grafted with cationic groups, such as quaternary ammoniums, as the active conductive centers of OH− on the backbone.43 AAEMs have been extensively used in alkaline fuel cells, and they also exhibit large potential in ZABs. AAEMs' Donnan effect—allowing the permeation of ions with the opposite charge and strongly repelling the same charged ions44—conducts OH− ions and prevents Zn2+ ions from migrating to the air electrode during battery operation in ZABs.45 In addition, AAEMs play an essential role in thermal stability, chemical stability (such as resistance to CO2 dissolution, self-corrosion), and mechanical stability (modulus of about 10 MPa orders of magnitude).46,47 However, due to the shortage of hydrophilicity for the rigid skeleton, AAEMs usually have insufficient water intake and resultant low conductivity.48,49 The assembled semi-open metal–air batteries are greatly affected by environmental humidity and the applied occasions are severely limited. So, the membrane must be very thin (<25 μm) and porous (≈40%) to minimize the internal resistance and enhance the operation duration.50 Besides, most quaternary ammonium type AAEMs are easy to degrade in an alkaline environment with OH− by Hoffman elimination.51 So, improving the conductivity and alkali resistance of AAEMs are the main trends of the current research studies.
The most used AAEMs are A901/A201 developed by Tokuyama in Japan,22,52 which consist of hydrocarbon and quaternary ammonium functional groups as terminating side chains on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based molecular frameworks offering excellent long-term stability in oxidation and reduction environments.22,41 A901/A201 AAEM are regularly employed as references for comparing membrane characteristics and battery performances.53 Other commonly used AAEMs include Zirfon,54 AT-155 and others.
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are hydrogels with an alkaline solution stored in insoluble inert matrixes that can swell and maintain a three-dimensional network structure.42 Their performances depend on the variety and content of the polymer host, salt and solvent. Generally, GPEs own plenty of hydrophilic groups and can lock a great deal of water in the polymer network. Hence, they have an excellent electrolyte absorption capacity and superior OH− transport capacity, finally promoting the conductivity and ORR/OER reaction kinetics. The reversible interaction like hydrogen bonding further endows excellent deformability. Also, they are lower in cost and easier to manufacture by direct solution casting method (also called phase inversion method). Regularly, polymers first blend with the alkali salt and water, and then the mixture is heated and stirred into a uniform solution, later poured into a fixed container, and naturally cooled to form a film. However, due to the high water uptake, GPEs usually exhibit a relatively poor mechanical strength (modulus of less than 1 MPa), so it is hard to provide adequate physical protection between electrodes.56 The loss of doped alkali is another fatal defect,46 which leads to a large ohmic polarization and resultant degradation of battery operation. Researchers usually maintain the stability of the membrane by cross-linking polymers57 or using low alkali concentrations.58
3. Framework materials
As mentioned before, water is the soul of alkaline solid electrolytes. A high-water content is helpful to dissolving hydroxide ions and movements of polymer chains,59 so that the membrane has high conductivity and reaction kinetics. Therefore, the materials utilized to prepare the electrolyte membrane should have sufficient hydrophilicity,60 which roughly include (1) artificial organic polymers; (2) biomass materials; (3) inorganic materials. Fig. 5 summarizes the vital development nodes of the solid electrolytes of ZABs and AABs in recent decades, mainly in terms of the material selection and characteristics.

3.1 Artificial organic polymers
Artificial organic polymers are the most widely used battery separator materials.50 In the early years, microporous separators (with 5–10 nm pore diameter) such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were extensively applied in lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries. The treated PP like Celgard 2500 or Celgard 3501 were also utilized for ZABs.73 Since 1960s, nonwoven separator have been employed in alkaline battery systems. Nonwoven separators have a fiber network structure formed by the direct or random arrangement of fibers. The fiber materials are mainly synthetic polymers, such as polyolefin, nylon and polyester, but natural sources are also used, such as cellulose and cotton. Their fiber structures provide high porosity (up to 75% pore volume) compared to microporous membranes (40% porosity), so that they can store more electrolyte through capillary forces, which is a must to maintain the high charge and discharge capacity and low resistance.73,85,86 Combining it with a microporous membrane can provide mechanical support and maintain good wettability, such as Celgard 4560 and Celgard 5550.85,87,88 In addition, glass fiber is a good kind of battery separator due to its high strength, high corrosion resistance and good insulating capability, but the smooth surface and low porosity result in much lower water absorption than that of organic fibers, so it is in general used in a liquid electrolyte environment.89,90
In 1973, Wright91 and his colleagues first theoretically studied the conductive behavior of the solid polymer electrolyte polyethylene oxide (PEO) and its ionic nature. Five years later, Armand et al. first utilized PEO in solid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries. Until 1995, Fauvarque et al. have for the first time reported the KOH-doped PEO polymer electrolyte, and successfully applied it in Ni–Zn and Ni–Cd secondary batteries.92–94 From then on, alkaline aqueous solid polymer electrolyte frameworks have begun to be manufactured in succession and employed in alkaline systems. Table 1 lists the artificial organic polymer electrolytes (including GPEs and AAEMs) used in ZABs and AABs with their corresponding publication time and properties. Next, some representative polymer frameworks will be introduced in detail.

3.1.1 Polyethylene oxide (PEO). 
Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is the earliest investigated solid polymer framework because it has excellent compatibility with various compounds. The ether oxygen groups have good segment mobility, and forms films easyily and gets modified. Moreover, PEO is low in cost and has been broadly used in all-solid-state electronic devices like Li-based batteries.110
Aqueous and non-aqueous alkaline solid polymer electrolytes were first fabricated by Fauvarque et al., applying PEO and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an additive.92 Both solid electrolytes exhibited an ionic conductivity of approximately 10−3 S cm−1, five times higher than that of pristine PEO (10−8 S cm−1) at room temperature. After that, F. Fauvarqu further studied a basic solid polymer electrolyte composed of epichlorohydrin and ethylene oxide copolymer P(ECH-co-EO) and KOH (containing no water).61 The electrolyte displayed a room-temperature conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 and OH− transfer number of 0.93. When employed in a Zn–air primary battery, the cell could work well up to a current density of 14 mA cm−2 at 0.8 V.
Nevertheless, PEO has low water absorption, poor interfacial properties, and higher crystallinity, especially at high salt concentrations, which lead to a sharp drop in conductivity. In solid aqueous batteries, PEO is gradually substituted by PVA, which possesses enough water solubility and high water absorption.91,96 Sometimes, it can be composited to the solid electrolyte as an enhancer to magnify the alkali resistance and mechanical stability of the film.82,99


3.1.2 Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). 
PVA is a semi-crystalline and biodegradable polymer containing –OH groups attached to the carbon chain. Hydroxyl groups can be sources of hydrogen bonds,111 which bring high water absorption and conductivity. PVA is a commonly used polymer matrix with excellent chemical stability, electrochemical inertness, non-toxicity and simple preparation.112 It was earliest applied in biomedical fields, such as wound treatment and cell culture.113 In 2000, Lewandowski first prepared a PVA alkaline gel electrolyte and explored its electrochemical performance. It showed an activation energy (Ea) of 22–28 kJ mol−1 and a conductivity of 10−3 to 10−4 S cm−1.114 Then, Yang et al. employed a simple solution casting method to prepare a KOH/PVA/H2O alkaline hydrogel with a room-temperature conductivity of about 0.047 S cm−1.96 When assembled into a Ni-MH battery and a primary ZAB, the discharge efficiency was increased from about 50% to 90% compared with PE/PP and cellulose separators. However, the linear PVA shows a poor alkali resistance and is easy to degrade. So, Chen et al. immersed PVA into an acetone solution with 10 wt% glutaraldehyde. The –OH groups of the PVA and –CHO groups of glutaraldehyde can be cross-linked with HCl to enhance the mechanical strength.64 After alkali soaking for 24 hours, a 20–50 μm thick PVA gel electrolyte membrane was obtained and applied to prepare the first solid-state rechargeable ZAB. It showed superior stability at 50 A kg−1 during 120 cycles with the energy density reaching 581 W h kg−1. The Peng group employed PEO as a mechanical enhancer to fabricate a PVA–PEO-based gel electrolyte, and then served it in a fibrous secondary zinc–air battery and primary aluminum–air battery (Fig. 6). The addition of PEO made PVA more stretchable with a maximal strain of 300% elongation.99 For the AAB, they extra mixed it into ZnO and Na2SnO3 to repress the more serious self-corrosion of Al.82 Utilizing metal springs as anodes, the aligned, cross-stacked and porous CNT sheets were coated with different catalysts as cathodes (Fig. 6d). The assembled fiber-shaped batteries were flexible, which can be curved to different angles without apparent harm to the structure and electrochemical performances (Fig. 6e).

Untreated PVA GPEs usually exist in a linear style with weak mechanical strength, inadequate alkali resistance, and low KOH content31 (usually in the range of 0.1–1.0 M). Through simple manners, such as cross-linking,64 heat treatment,100 freezing–drying,115 and compounding with paper,116 the mechanical and electrochemical properties can be effectively reinforced (Table 1). These strategies will be described in detail in the subsequent chapters.

Polyacrylic acid (PAA) exists in the form of an anionic homopolymer (the carboxyl group (–COOH) makes a negatively charged carboxylate group (–COO−)) in a high pH environment. Due to carboxylate ions, PAA has more hydrophilic domains formed by hydrogen bonds and lower crystallinity.62,117,118 So, compared with PVA, it has a higher ionic conductivity and excellent tensile deformation,119 which make it a promising material for preparing alkaline GPEs.120
In 2001, Iwakura first prepared an alkaline GPE with potassium polyacrylate (PAAK) and KOH solutions.121 The conductivity was very high (close to 0.6 S cm−1) because of a high content of alkali. When used in a Ni–MH battery, it had comparable charge–discharge performance with that of a liquid one. A hydroponic gel made of polyacrylic acid copolymers was also investigated as an alkaline gel electrolyte due to its fast and high liquid absorption performance.59,122 The prepared solid ZAB and AAB each had specific capacities of 657.5 mA h g−1 and 105.0 mA h g−1.
Although the PAA hydrogel has a comparable conductivity that is almost the same as that of the liquid one, the high-water content, in turn, makes PAA soft and fragile.123 The constant attack of the surrounding water into the hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains leads to inadequate mechanical protection. Apart from this, the directly purchased PAA is a commercial product with a clear molecular weight, which is not helpful for research. Based on the above, Zhu et al. successively added the monomer acrylic acid (AA),62 cross-linking agent N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA), and initiator K2S2O8 to the KOH solution to prepare an alkaline GPE by in situ polymerization. The conductivity was as high as 0.288 S cm−1 and the primary ZAB displayed a capacity of 530 mA h g−1 discharging at 1.3 V. From then on, cross-linking PAA by MBA has become a common solid electrolyte utilized in most studies.120
Instead of directly blending the alkali salts and AA monomers to make PAA GPEs, sodium acrylate (ANa) made of neutralizing AA monomers with NaOH (aq) can also be a selectable raw material.33 Followed by free-radical polymerization, film formation, drying, and immersion in an alkaline solution (Fig. 7a), the obtained sodium polyacrylate (PANa) gel solid electrolyte displayed satisfying ion conductivity (0.17 S cm−1). With Pt/C–RuO2 as the catalyst (Fig. 7b), the installed zinc–air battery had a maximum power of 88 mW cm−2 (Fig. 7c). The specific capacity and specific energies were 795 mA h g−1 and 952 W h kg−1 (normalized to the consumed zinc mass) at 1 mA cm−2. The voltage platforms were still stable after circulating for 800 cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, far exceeding the average level of solid ZABs (about 160 cycles) (Fig. 7d).

PAA was not applied to solid Al–air batteries until 2014. Zhang et al. optimized the KOH and AA monomer content to 36 wt% and 6 wt%, respectively, to achieve a balance between the mechanical strength and ionic conductivity.75 ZnO was added as a corrosion inhibitor. The prepared alkaline gel electrolyte had a final conductivity of 0.46 S cm−1. The assembled Al–air battery displayed the peak capacity of 1166 mA h g−1 and power density of 91.13 mW cm−2.


3.1.4 Polyacrylamide (PAM). 
In recent years, polyacrylamide (PAM) based gel electrolytes have been developed and applied in solid storage devices, like supercapacitors,124 zinc-ion batteries125,126 and zinc–air batteries.127,128 Because the polyacrylamide unit contains amide groups, which are easy to form hydrogen bonds with water and the polymer chains themselves, PAM has adequate water uptake capacity and outstanding deformation. Furthermore, it has significant functional properties due to its accessibility to obtain branched or networked structures through grafting or cross-linking, and has an expansive range of applications in the domains of petroleum exploitation, water treatment, papermaking, medicine, and aqueous metal–air batteries. In 2018, a PAM alkaline hydrogel was synthesized by in situ polymerization of acrylamide (AM) monomer and, for the first time, assembled into a solid zinc–air battery by the Zhi group.71 The macropore structure of the freeze-dried PAM allowed the ions to be transported smoothly (Fig. 8b). The hydrogen network was able to dissipate the applied energy (Fig. 8a), so that the gel electrolyte can be compressed to 54% strain without degrading the output power and discharge performances (Fig. 8c–f). After 220 charge–discharge cycles, the discharge performance hardly deteriorated.

PAM, as an equivalent high-water-absorption polymer material with PAA, has some differences with respect to its performances. The Wang group manufactured sodium polyacrylate (PAA-Na) and PAM alkaline hydrogels, and compared their various properties.23 Through water absorption, water retention, and contact angle tests (Fig. 8g and h), it was found that the –COO− in the PAA-Na chain had better hydrophilicity than that of the –CONH2 in the PAM chain. In addition, because the amide groups in PAM were easily hydrolyzed in alkaline solution and replaced by the oxygen in the OH−, the original covalent connection that maintains the strength of the framework was reduced. So, the mechanical modulus and tensile strain were slightly affected (Fig. 8i). In general, the properties of PAM, such as water absorption, water retention, conductivity, alkali resistance, and mechanical strength are somewhat inferior to those of PAA-Na.129,130

3.2 Biomass materials
Biomass materials are all kinds of substances that can be obtained from any animal, plant, or microorganism. Biomass is generally divided into polysaccharides (linearly bonded polymer carbohydrates structure), polypeptides (polymer amino acids), and polynucleotides (long polymers composed of 13 or more nucleotide monomers).131 Biomass materials were first devoted to medical biology involving human wound healing, cell culture, and tissue reconstruction because of its good biocompatibility. People then gradually discovered their special chemistry, electricity, optics, and mechanics properties, and expanded to various fields such as energy, materials, chemical industry, and military.113 Environmental degradability, low cost, simple preparation process, and non-toxicity make biomass materials desirable candidates to prepare solid electrolytes.132–134 Most of these new systems are based on polysaccharides, such as cellulose,135 starch,132 chitosan,136,137 and agar.138 In addition, non-polysaccharide biomass materials, such as gelatin139,140 and protein141 have attracted much attention.

3.2.1 Solid electrolytes for ZABs. 
Cellophane made of natural fibers, such as virgin pulp and wood pulp, has been used as a separator for a long time. However, due to its inadequate moisture absorption and water permeability, it is often necessary to add a hydrophilic layer, such as vinylon non-woven fabric, to maintain the regular operation of the battery. Furthermore, the weak alkali and oxidation resistance of cellophane make it less than required. Besides, non-woven fabrics made of natural cellulose and cotton are also used for alkaline battery separators.73 Compared with Al–air batteries, biomass materials have been applied to Zn–air batteries earlier. Special research on biomass electrolyte materials for zinc–air batteries began in 2010. Mohamad et al. utilized sago as a raw material and mixed its with KOH to prepare gel polymer electrolytes.142 The 6 M KOH sago GPE had a nice ionic conductivity (4.45 × 10−1 S cm−1), and the specific capacity of an experimental ZAB reached 505 mA h g−1. Four years later, Jaephil Cho et al. used gelatin from animals with 0.1 M KOH to synthesize an alkaline gel electrolyte (Fig. 9a).70 It had a high OH− conductivity of 3.1 × 10−3 S cm−1, equal to or higher than that of PEO. They also used a spiral zinc anode to prepare a deformable cable type ZAB (Fig. 9b). With the Fe/N/C-900 catalyst, the battery showed a 0.92 V discharge platform and 9 h discharge time at 0.1 mA cm−2. During the work, the battery could bend at different angles, and the voltage platform remained unchanged (Fig. 9c).

Cellulose is a macromolecular polysaccharide composed of thousands of D-glucan units, and is linked by β-(1→4) linkages. Because of its good hydrophilicity, inherent robust strength, biodegradability, excellent flexibility, and convenience of getting chemically modified, cellulose and its derivatives have been studied in fields like biological devices, green electronics, bioenergy and energy storage.143 When applied for the preparation of solid electrolytes, single cellulose only requires a very low concentration (0.5–2%) in water to form a semi-stable gel. But in the process of mixing the alkali salt, KOH has a coagulation effect on the fiber, which is unable to deliver ions efficiently and hugely reducing the flexibility of the membrane. The obtained GPE is sheet-like, crisp, and unstable for characterization.144,145 Therefore, in most studies, cellulose is often designed to be an AAEM, which holds lower alkali content, or as a good additive to blend with other hydrophilic materials to enhance the conductivity or mechanical performances. In 2016, the Chen group first prepared a high water-retention quaternary-ammonium-functionalized AAEM with cellulose nanofibers (QAFC membrane) by vacuum filtration method, and applied it to all-solid-state ZABs.42Fig. 9d shows the chemical changes of the QAFC electrolyte. Solitary micro/nanofibrils tended to create a smaller porous constructure (25–300 nm of pore size and 72.8% of porosity) with a higher surface area than the micron-sized fibres (Fig. 9e and f). Benefitting from these, the QAFC membrane possessed a high water uptake (more than 2 times larger than that of the A201 film), and presented an excellent conductivity of 21.2 mS cm−1 with the modified QA functional groups on the polymer matrix (Fig. 9g). The solid ZAB with the QAFC membrane had a much longer discharge time of more than 1100 min (vs. 400 min of the A201 membrane) at 25 mA g−1 (Fig. 9h).
The Lee group chose Pinus radiata wood powder and bagasse of sugarcane before and after as raw materials, and extracted the cellulose nanofibers by multiple processes.146,147 Followed by functionalization with didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) and choline, the anion exchange membranes were obtained by vacuum filtration method and phase inversion method. With the prepared COF and MOF catalysts, the assembled Zn–air battery exhibited a specific energy density of 862 and 975 W h kg−1, as well as a maximum power density of 187 and 194 mW cm−2, respectively.
Chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from the deacetylation of chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods. It has a large amount of free ammonia in its molecular structure, so the solubility is considerably increased compared to cellulose. Weakly alkaline chitosan can be dissolved in dilute acid solution to form a cationic polysaccharide polymer. Due to its biodegradable, hydrophilic, affordable, non-toxic, and decent film-forming properties, chitosan has been broadly utilized in the energy field.137 The Qiao group took cross-linked chitosan as the framework,102 and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as the OH− conductive network to make an AAEM (Fig. 9i) with a high conductivity of 0.024 S cm−1. The introduction of PDDA provided more sites for water bonding than the single CS network. Together with the cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde (GA), the water retention and mechanical properties were hence greatly improved. Fig. 9j shows that the Zn–air battery with the CS-PDDA membrane had a high peak power density of 48.9 mW cm−2, which was better than that of the commercial A201 membrane (41.4 mW cm−2).


3.2.2 Solid electrolytes for AABs. 
The investigation of biomass materials for solid-state AABs started late, and the groundbreaking research has not appeared until P. Corbo's group first conducted some research on xanthan and carrageenan in 2016. Xanthan is a bacterial polysaccharide composed of a cellulose backbone (β-(1→4)-D-glucose), which is selected from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris under conditions of aerobic fermentation. Carrageenan is a general term for linear and sulfated polysaccharides extracted from multifarious marine red algae. It comprises sulfated or non-sulfated galactose, as well as 3,6-anhydrogalactose connected by α-(1→3) and β-(1→4) glycosidic bonds alternately. Both polysaccharides are extensively used as food additives and rheology modifiers. Corbo et al. employed xanthan and κ-carrageenan as the origin solid matrixes to prepare alkali hydrogels (1 M KOH and 8 M KOH).76 The κ-carrageenan gel displayed elastic and gummy properties, while xanthan can only obtain a paste-like gel. Both gels had very high conductivity (10−2 S cm−1). The sequence of the discharge performance of assembled Al–air batteries was: xanthan (18 mW h cm−2) < κ-carrageenan (33 mW h cm−2). This can be attributed to the higher granular structure of the carrageenan gel, which facilitated the formation and transport of the reaction products in itself. Subsequently, they found that the acid xanthan gel had a high corrosion inhibition rate.148 The electrolyte with 24% HCl had the best overall performance (ion conductivity of 1.910 × 10−2 S cm−1, and corrosion inhibition efficiency of 96%). When employed in an AAB, the maximum anode efficiency reached 83%. Although the neutral and acidic xanthan gel electrolytes had a relatively stable voltage platform and longer operation time, the discharge voltage was much smaller than that of the alkaline one.149,150
Other natural materials, such as gum Arabic151 and chitosan,84 can also participate in the preparation of Al–air battery solid electrolytes. Taking chitosan as an example, the Sun team assembled a cost-effective and eco-friendly coin cell-type AAB with chitosan hydrogel membrane.84Fig. 10a shows the preparation process of the chitosan hydrogel membranes (CS-HGM). The addition of 10 wt% SiO2 as a corrosion inhibitor could give a higher flat voltage plateau than other metal oxides fillers (SnO2, and ZnO). When discharging at 1.0 mA cm−2, the specific capacities were 288.5 mA h g−1 (based on the Al mass) (Fig. 10c). By comparing with the gel electrolytes prepared with xanthan gum and gelatin, the chitosan hydrogel membrane had a better voltage platform and a longer discharge time. This was because that part of the xanthan gum and gelatin film was dissolved, while the chitosan film can exist stably under the alkaline condition (Fig. 10b). In addition, the discharged components of the coin-type AAB can be entirely recycled using only household items through environmentally safe procedures (Fig. 10d).

3.2.3 Paper-based electrolytes. 
Paper, directly made of microporous cellulose instead of nanocellulose, can be applied in the production of electronic devices because of its moderate mechanical strength and excellent electronic circuit load capacity. In addition, paper is (1) thin, light and flexible, making the device more deformable and portable; (2) accessible to process and can be cut to a suitable size according to practical demands; (3) biocompatible, biodegradable and renewable; (4) beneficial to realize structural shift by a simple change of shape and circuit connection.152,153 Thus, scientists have developed various electronic paper products, such as transistors, displays, batteries, sensors, and smart labels. There are usually three ways to apply paper in electronic devices: (1) taking advantage of the flexibility and substance compatibility of paper to load various electronic components, such as printed circuit boards;154 (2) as an electrode material to carry electrochemically active materials inside or on the surface of the paper. A large amount of void volume can greatly expand the energy storage capacity;155 (3) the capillary force and abundant pore structures of paper enable it to absorb and store a large amount of electrolyte as a separator. Based on the above, paper has been employed in supercapacitors, sensors, portable batteries, and others.
Paper as a solid electrolyte is also adaptive for solid ZABs and AABs. Hilder et al. first proposed a paper-based Zn–air printed battery in 2009.156 However, it is a pity that little attention was put on the study of paper-based Zn–air batteries after that.157,158
Inexpensive paper-based Al–air battery has been studied in recent years. Huang et al. carried out a series of innovative explorations in this regard. They creatively embedded the Al anode inside the paper to omit any extra external force for integrating the Al foil with the paper substrate during the paper-making process.159 After passing-through different angles and 1000 times of bending, its performance was almost unaffected, indicating the good flexibility and robustness. In the subsequent experiment, they printed Al and ORR ink on a cellulose paper for the first time to successfully produce a printable AAB. This provided extensive prospects of the large-area and low-cost that can provide convenient energy storage devices.160 In addition, due to the casual deformability of cellulose fibres, paper-based batteries can exhibit excellent foldability. Jooho and Wooyoung used a Tyvek sheet cellulose supporter as a substrate,83 an Al foil as the anode, carbon black/PVDF-HFP composites (CP) as both the current collector and cathode electrode coated on the cellulose, and a wiper tissue soaked in sodium chloride (NaCl) electrolyte as a separator (Fig. 11a–c), to make a solid Al–air battery that can be deformed to a very high level, such as expansion, folding, stacking and wrinkling. Motivated by the foldability of the cellulose substrate, they applied a battery pack—just an overlap of several batteries in series (Fig. 11d). The battery pack with 4 cells in series could deliver a voltage platform of 2.4 V under bending condition, and was able to turn on an LED that operated at least 1.5 V (Fig. 11e).

However, the mechanical durability of the paper is so fragile that the weak areas are likely to be broken and drive to short circuits. Besides, paper alone cannot stock too much electrolyte, and water tends to volatilize under ambient conditions to reduce conductivity. A polymer-paper hybrid separator was developed to address these problems. A PAA/PVA mixture was coated on each side of the filter paper before drying at 150 °C for 50 min to enhance the electrolyte storage of the paper.157 Huang et al. filled the cellulose fiber skeleton with a PANa solution,161 and then the deposited gel electrolyte was solidified in the paper supporter (Fig. 12a). Using the prepared paper-based gel electrolyte (PBGE) as the separator, the flexible Al–air battery could run for 160 min at 1 mA cm−2 and presented a specific capacity of 768 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12b).

In addition, microfluidic systems can resolve the problem of inadequate water storage/retention of paper to ensure constant operation in the desert and windy environments.164–166 The paper-based microfluidic concept was first introduced into Al–air batteries (μAl–air battery) by the Etzold group.162 Benefiting from the capillary force of the fiber structure, the paper continuously and spontaneously conveyed the electrolyte solution from one side to the other at a stable flow rate, and took away the passivation products in time (Fig. 12c). The microfluidic structure provided the battery with a stable and relatively pure discharge condition, letting the specific capacity reach 2750 Ah kg−1 at 20 mA cm−2, which were 8.3 times higher than that of the non-fluidic equivalent (Fig. 12d). Compared with the traditional flow battery, paper-based systems do not need water pumps and pipelines, greatly simplifying the system structure and increasing the energy density.
It is worth noting that due to the restricted volume of the alkaline electrolyte and the curving of the cellulose fibres, blocked OH− ions are tough to diffuse to the reaction site. Thus, the anode current does not increase, but decreases at a high discharge voltage in the polarization test, as shown in Fig. 12e.163 An effective strategy is increasing the alkaline concentration within a certain range to reduce the ohmic impedance.163 Another way is to enhance the storage of the conductive materials by pre-depositing electrolyte salts (NaOH or NaCl) into the paper.159,167 However, the limited mass transfer of hydroxide is not bad for restraining the self-corrosion of the Al metal. As shown in Fig. 12f,163 the paper-based battery discharged for a much longer time than the flow counterpart, particularly at lower current densities. This was probably because the enlarged ion transport resistance reduced the proportion of hydrogen evolution. Although the maximum areal power density of the paper-based AABs is generally only 10–20 mW cm−2, they exactly meet the demands of the recent emergence of more microwatt devices, which are inexpensive and disposable, requiring low-cost and lightweight primary batteries. Moreover, the use of low-power electronic devices enables the electrolyte to employ seawater (NaCl aq),168–170 which is not so corrosive and allows batteries to work stably for a long time under low voltage.159
To summarize, due to the excellent deformability of paper, foldable batteries can be fabricated employing paper as a substrate. The entangled fibers of cellulose will impair OH− transmission, which can inhibit the self-corrosion of the metal anodes. Aimed at microwatt electronic equipment, cheap and safe seawater can be used for electrolytes kept in paper to offer a stable discharge platform. The paper is brittle and breakable, and sensitive to the environment, which can be recovered by compositing with other supporting materials or combining the microfluidic system.

3.3 Inorganic materials
In addition to organic polymers, some inorganic materials that are accessible to form films, such as TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2, zeolite, graphene oxide (GO), and layered double hydroxide (LDH), have been used in fields, like lithium-ion batteries,171,172 exchange membrane fuel cells,173,174 and supercapacitors.175 There are also a small number of reports in Zn–air and Al–air batteries.176 Li-based batteries use non-hydrous inorganic solid electrolytes, including perovskite-type, NASICON-type, garnet-type and sulfide-type materials, where the ionic transport commonly depends on the concentration and distribution of defects.177 In aqueous inorganic solid electrolytes, OH− is transported between electrodes by dissolving in the water close to the hydrophilic domain of the amorphous regions in inorganic materials. Due to the mobility of water, the ion conductivity is much higher than that of non-hydrous solid electrolytes (10−3vs. 10−7 S cm−1).
Carbon nanomaterials are utilized to synthesize composite hydrogels due to their unique structure and remarkable physical and electrochemical properties.178–180 Hydrophilic GO with a nanosheet structure can be very liable to form an ultrathin and flexible film by the vacuum filtration method. The surface of hydrophilic GO is functionalized with various oxygenated groups on its base and edges, mainly hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups, so it can be chemically modified more easily than graphene.181,182 The Chen group developed a flexible GO-based AAEM showing high OH− conductivity.65 GO was functionally modified by esterification and electrostatic πcation–π stacking reactions using 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (HMIM) as an imidazolium-based ionic liquid. HMIM helped to increase the GO interlayer spacing to reduce the impact of humidity and to promote the migration of hydroxide ions. The HMIM/GO film exhibited excellent conductivity of 0.064 S cm−1 at room temperature and 30% relative humidity (RH). Compared with the commercial A201 membrane, it had less dependence on the operating conditions. The assembled wearable ZAB and supercapacitor showed smaller polarization in an ambient environment.
Some oxides like SiO2 and ZrO2 are also good candidates to synthesize solid electrolytes for aqueous metal–air batteries.21 Othman et al. used TEOS as a starting material and CTAB as a template reagent to synthesize a SiO2 film MCM-41 with a thickness of 5 μm on a zinc substrate by dip coating.63 Due to its large porosity ratio (1.08 cm3 g−1), specific surface area (1200 m2 g−1), and hydrophilicity (silanol groups (Si–OH) on the surface), the Zn–air battery with the new type of separator exhibited a maximum power density of 32 mW cm−2 and a volumetric energy density of 300 W h L−1. Afterward, the same group found that the open circuit potential (OCP) of the prepared Zn–air battery was responsive and showed a linear relationship with the humidity in a dry form.21 Based on this, they arranged the solid ZAB as a self-powered humidity sensor and can operate normally without providing additional power. Besides SiO2, A KOH–ZrO2 solid electrolyte membrane was fabricated by the Matsuda team.183,184 They chose tetrabutyl zirconate (Zr(n-OBu)4) as raw materials and obtained the ZrO2-based solid electrolyte powder by sol–gel method. An all-solid-state ZAB was fabricated by pressing the powder onto the anode. However, the discharge capacity reduced from 30 mA h g−1 to 3 mA h g−1 after only 5 cycles. The author attributed this performance reduction to the difficulty of dissolving the passive ZnO layer onto the ZrO2 film.184
For solid Al–air batteries, apart from the generally used glass fiber, Hibino et al. first studied Sb(V)-doped SnP2O7 as a solid electrolyte for rechargeable AABs.81 The hydroxide ion conductivity of Sn0.92Sb0.08P2O7 had been reported to be up to 0.01 S cm−1 or more.185 The cell with inorganic film exhibited an OCV of about 1.6 V and a very high discharge capacity (800 mA h g−1). It should be noted that because this solid electrolyte is non-hydrous, it had negligible self-corrosion, high CO2 tolerance, and rechargeability. Nevertheless, the absence of water limited the solid electrolyte to dissolve enough Al(OH)4− ions, which leads to the formation of the insoluble aluminate species on the electrode surface and exceedingly increases the internal electrochemical resistance, resulting in low energy efficiency (34%) and cycle ability.
Compared with organic polymers, inorganic membranes have better thermal stability and higher strength.85 However, the rigid and brittle nature of the inorganic films leads to poor electrode–electrolyte interface compatibility and low conductivity. Also, a lower water uptake results in inadequate solubility for byproducts, which passivates metal surface and reduces the cycle life, as well as the depth of discharge (DOD). These factors lead to a fundamental barrier restraining the prospect of inorganic materials.186 Modifying with hydrophilic groups or introducing flexible fillers to reduce the degree of crystallization may improve their ion transport properties.
4. Conductivity
For liquid Zn–air batteries, since KOH has a quicker oxygen diffusion efficiency, a higher ionic conductivity, as well as lower viscosity than NaOH, the most generally used alkaline is 30 wt% or 7 M KOH, which corresponds to the peak conductivity of 0.64 S cm−1 at 25 °C.187 Furthermore, the high pH environment is helpful in dissolving the carbonate byproducts. For AABs, because KOH is not favorable for the industrial recovery of the product alumina,188 4 M NaOH is also optional.
In terms of the solid electrolyte, the framework matrix confines a large sum of the water, whose movements and the dissolving ions are hindered, thereby diminishing its conductivity. The larger polarization of the solid batteries results in greatly reduced discharge performances compared to the aqueous counterparts, as shown in Table 2. Specifically, AAEMs have a lower OH− content and water absorption (30–200%)102,189 than that of GPEs (>1000%),33,41,108 leading to a resultantly lower conductivity (10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1vs. 10−2 to 10−1 S cm−1) and lower peak power density (generally no more than 100 mW cm−2). For GPEs, more hydrophilic solid electrolyte materials like PAA and PAM usually have a lower performance reduction than those that uptake less water, such as PVA, compared with the liquid system (Table 2).

4.1 OH− transport mechanisms and influencing factors
It is necessary to deeply understand the OH− transport mechanisms in the solid electrolyte to help us to improve the ion conductivity and the overall battery performances clearly. A dusty fluid model (DFM)203 has been described and widely used by referring to the proton transport mechanism. It has been applied to proton exchange membranes (PEMs), such as Nafion,204,205 to predict the change of alkaline membrane conductivity and other membrane properties with relative humidity to make a preliminary attempt to understand alkali ions conducting process. In general, OH− transport in aqueous basic solid electrolytes can be classified roughly into 3 forms, as illustrated in Fig. 13: (1) surface site hopping mechanism; (2) Grotthuss mechanism; (3) diffusion and migration mechanism.
 Fig. 13  Transport mechanisms that are possible for the hydroxyl anion in aqueous basic solid electrolytes. (Choosing quaternary-ammonium groups as an example of AAEMs, they can be hydrophilic sites in GPEs.) Transport can be the combination of these mechanisms. Transport mechanisms may occur according to the trend through the surface site hopping mechanism to Grotthuss mechanism, then to the diffusion migration mechanism with the increasing water content. 
It is generally agreed that most OH− transport through (1) and (2) mechanisms in AAEMs—hydroxide ions transport through hopping along the surface sites on the backbone for the surface site hopping mechanism (requiring high activation energy), and by the formation and cleavage of hydrogen bonds on the molecular water chains for the Grotthuss mechanism (requiring low activation energy). Since OH− ions may also move via structural diffusion with water molecules, this manner always leads to a much higher ionic mobility than the former.206 The unique Grotthuss mechanism may be impeded by the structure and increased importance as water continues to further open the membrane structure, which would imply other mechanisms, such as standard vehicular processes.203 The vehicular mechanism is analogous to the movement of larger cations:206i.e., the hydroxide ions move as water-solvated species (e.g., OH− (H2O)3).207 In fact, (3) the Diffusion and Migration mechanism also plays an important role in OH− transport, especially for GPEs with higher water content. According to the ORR reaction equation, the more water exists, the quicker OH− is produced, indicating that during discharge, the cathode has faster OH− accumulation. Also, the metal anode has more active reaction kinetics in a high pH environment, and the speed of OH− consumption is faster. Therefore, ion concentration gradients are more likely to occur, and hydroxide ions are inclined to transport through the diffusion and migration mechanism, which contributes a large part of the high conductivity of GPEs.
Based on the above discussion of OH− transport mechanisms, there are three factors that affect the conductivity, namely ion exchange capacity (IEC), ion mobility, and degree of hydration. IEC is controlled by the amount of fixed cationic groups on the backbones for AAEMs. For GPEs, abundant hydrophilic sites and a relatively higher OH− concentration are keys to increasing the IEC. Ion mobility is mainly related to the flexibility of polymer chain segments, the hydration structure with transmission sites or water chains, ion concentration gradient and/or electrostatic potential gradient, and the microscopic morphology of polymer chains. In terms of membrane synthesis, strategies to improve the ion mobility include (1) reducing the degree of crystallization; (2) adjusting hydration structure of OH− through regulating species or concentration of solvent, additives and salt; (3) building fast-ion channels and others.208 The water content is the essence of alkaline solid electrolytes.102,209 Plenty of water can dissolve more OH−, which is beneficial to improve the ionic conductivity. Second, water can interact with hydroxide ions, anions, or hydrophilic groups to form abundant hydration structures, showing different conductivities in different materials and environments.210
4.2 Improvement strategies
According to the ion transport mechanisms, researchers generally change the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte to adjust the IEC, ion mobility, and hydration degree to enhance the ionic conductivity. The specific strategies studied in ZABs and AABs mainly include the following six methods, as described in the following sections.

4.2.1 Regulating OH− content. 
For AAEMs, introducing more anion conducting groups on the framework is an essential way to promote IEC.43 For GPEs, which can be fabricated by adding alkali salts from the beginning or soaking in alkali solution after the film formation to reach ion balance, the alkali content ranges from low to high, correlating to the alkali resistance of the membrane and the preparation manner. There was a report that the concentration of the alkali solution could arrive at 12 M.211 Studies have shown that a proper increase of the content of OH− in solid electrolytes can rapidly raise the conductivity.212–214 This is because the addition of alkali salts will boost the amount of charge carrier and destroy the degree of polymer crystallization,215 thereby enhancing the segment creeping and conductivity. For instance, the conductivity of pure PVA is about 10−10 S cm−1, and adding 10% KOH to PVA sharply improves it to around 10−6 S cm−1.216 However, excessive KOH will lead to a reduction in the conductivity because too many OH− ions will evolve to ion aggregates, and cause an increase in viscosity as a result of limiting their mobility.114 Besides, the rise of the alkali content might degrade the mechanical properties due to the fragmentation of the polymer chains and the breakage of the hydrogen bonds.75,97


4.2.2 Introducing other hydrophilic materials. 
The introduction of other generally used framework materials through blending, copolymerization, grafting, or chemical reaction can not only introduce hydrophilic sites to increase the water uptake, but also reduce the degree of polymer crystallization and promote ion transport. Hydrophilic materials can be selected from artificial organic polymers (such as PVA, PAA, PAM),31,196 biomass materials (such as nanocellulose, chitosan, sodium alginate),78,101 and inorganic materials (such as GO, SiO2, TiO2).210,217
Wu and Yang introduced PAA into the PVA solid electrolyte by in situ polymerization using triallylamine as the cross-linker and ammonium persulfate as the initiator.69,218 After evaporation and electrolyte absorption, the conductivity grew to 0.301 S cm−1. In the subsequent experiment, they utilized PVA–PAA (10:7.5) as the polymer framework in ZABs and AABs. The discharge capacity of ZAB was 1347 mA h g−1 with the maximum power density of 50 mW cm−2 at 120 mA. However, due to the rapid passivation of the AAB, the maximum power density was relatively poor (only 1.2 mW cm−2). Although PAA has been recognized as one of the most absorbent hydrogels, it can be further improved by adding other hydrophilic materials to make composite hydrogels. Taking advantage of the superior Young's modulus and hydrophilicity of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), the Wu group designed a mechanically strong CNFs-based PAA gel electrolyte with high conductivity (Fig. 14a).77 Under the load of 3 wt% CNFs, the conductivity increased from 0.157 to 0.272 S cm−1 (an increase of ∼100%) (Fig. 14b). The CNFs first helped the gel electrolyte absorb more alkali content, and thereby boosted the number of charge carriers. Second, the exposed hydroxyl groups on the surface of CNFs created more ion transfer pathways to enhance the ion mobility. Inorganic materials and biomass materials with abundant oxygenated groups on the surface, such as GO, cellulose, chitosan, can be easily quaternary ammonium functionalized to form highly conductive AAEMs. If compositing the two materials, extra cationic groups and more abundant transport pathways will be introduced into a single network and simultaneously bring a variety of electrochemical and mechanical characteristics.210 The Qiao group associated hydrophilic GO with chitosan to develop their electrochemical and mechanical properties (Fig. 14c).107 Both chitosan and GO surface were rich in hydroxyl groups to be easily functionalized with 1-ethenyl-3-methyl-1H-imidazolium chloride polymer and 1-ethenyl-2-pyrrolidone (EMImC-co-EP) quaternary ammonium compounds. The addition of GO can increase the hydrophilic sites in the synthesized AAEM, effectively improving the conductivity and mechanical strength of the membrane. The conductivity of the modified film with medium GO content (1 wt% GO) was nearly doubled (16 mS cm−1) (Fig. 14d).

4.2.3 Adding fillers. 
Since the OH− transport mechanisms include ions hopping on the hydrophilic sites or cationic immobilized groups on the backbone, frequent and easy segment movements can improve the ionic mobility. The introduction of inorganic or organic and polymer fillers is the most accessible method to lubricate the polymer segments and reduce the crystallinity, as well as improve the flexibility of the membrane. Simultaneously, adding fillers can extend the available space for more water absorption and smooth ion diffusion. Also, some fillers are wealthy in OH− transport sites on their surfaces, which play a role as carriers in ion migration. The fillers that have been studied involve ZrO2,219 TiO2,220 ZnO,221 SiO2,222 GO,223,224 montmorillonite, PVC, DOP, cellulose, and chitosan.225
Inorganic fillers are currently the most widely used fillers. They can be used as plasticizers, water-retaining agents, cross-linking agents and corrosion inhibitors to improve the overall performances of the electrolyte membrane comprehensively. Aftering adding 20 wt% ZrO2 fillers, the PVA polymer electrolyte showed a conductivity of about 0.267 S cm−1 at 20 °C,219 which was six-fold higher than that containing no fillers. A PVA–TiO2 composite alkaline solid electrolyte was prepared by applying ceramic fillers titanium dioxide (TiO2) as plasticizers.226 Because of the free volume and some defects that were generated at the boundary between the TiO2 particles and PVA segments, the ionic conductivities of the membranes with diverse doping amounts of TiO2 fillers were all in the magnitude of 0.1 S cm−1. SiO2, besides the effect of degrading the crystallinity and enhancing the flexibility of chain segments, is straightforward to establish hydrogen bonds with water possessing strong water absorption due to the abundant silanol covering the bulk. In addition, the silanol can react with special functional groups (such as alcoholic hydroxyl) to form chemical bonds to construct a three-dimensional cross-linked network. Based on the above, the Hu and Zhong groups added SiO2 powders as plasticizers,103 water-retaining agents, and cross-linking agents into PVA to develop outstanding hydrogels for flexible zinc air batteries (Fig. 15a). Furthermore, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added as a pore generator to promote the base uptake ability. The introduction of 5 wt% SiO2 increased the amorphous PVA region to obtain a higher fraction of free volume, and enhance the electrolyte absorption capacity. The conductivity rose from 38.3 mS cm−1 to 57.3 mS cm−1 (Fig. 15b). Benefiting from the lubrication and water retention capacities of SiO2 (62.4% after 40 h), the flexible ZAB had a stable cycling performance that lasted for 48 h, much longer than the previous studies.

The surface functional modification of the fillers with cationic groups can make them serve as active sites for transporting OH−, further improving the ionic conductivity. The Yang group227 and Lue group228 successively functionalized the inorganic fillers SiO2 and biomass fillers chitosan with quaternary ammonium groups. They then blended them with quaternary polyvinyl alcohol (Q-PVA) to form novel composite electrolytes, and applied them for the direct alcohol alkaline fuel cell (DAAFC) shown in Fig. 15c and d. At 30 °C, the addition of 5% quaternary nano-SiO2 into the Q-PVA film increased the conductivity by 0.5% and 60%, separately, owing to not only to the extended IEC, but also the higher free volume density and reduced polymer crystallinity. In addition, the fillers presented a physical cross-linking effect, inhibiting the in-plane swelling ratio, but not reducing the alkali absorption.
Some additives can destroy KOH aggregates by hydrogen bonds with OH−, thereby increasing the number of dissociated KOH involved in the conduction of OH−. Li et al. introduced microcrystalline cellulose pretreated by N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (LD-MCC) as a functional component in the PVA/PEO/KOH system.212 As the KOH stabilizer, hydrophilic agent, and conductive phase, the mixture of 5 wt% LD-MCC significantly improved the ionic conductivity (from 0.018 S cm−1 to 0.153 S cm−1). It was verified by wide-angle X-ray diffraction that LD-MCC entrapped KOH and suppressed its aggregation, so the K+ ions were preferentially situated on the LD-MCC nearby, and more OH− participated in the ion transport.


4.2.4 Fabricating porous structures. 
A pore-rich structure by physical methods can not only save more conductive ions, but also limit the escape of water to maintain the wetting nature and extend the lifetime of batteries. Furthermore, tremendous solid–liquid contact surfaces can provide ample ion transport sites and channels to promote the ionic conductivity. The physical methods generally refer to the through-phase separation method. This can be described as adding pore generators like poor solvents, flocculants or volatile solvents, or changing the temperature (heating or freezing) and pH value and other strategies, to separate the polymer backbone phase and water, removing materials to leave by sublimation, volatilization or dissolution, and finally leaving a pore-rich structure.
Compared with other polymer electrolytes, the PVA–KOH-based hydrogel prepared by the freeze–thaw method can increase the degree of cross-linkage and form a high-porosity structure with better alkali resistance and ionic conductivity.56,82,99,229 The Chen group organized porous bacterial cellulose (BC)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite solid electrolytes (BPCE) through in situ synthesis.105 The freeze-thaw process—the mixed BC/PVA solutions were kept in a freeze dryer at −45 °C for 12 h followed by thawing to room temperature for 6 h—was repeated three times to further improve the physical cross-linking level. The addition of 6% BC resulted in a smaller and more compact microporous structure of BPCE, which captured a large sum of water and exhibited an ultra-high ionic conductivity of 80.8 mS cm−1 at room temperature. The assembled solid ZAB can stably circulate over 440 h thanks to the excellent water retention obtained from plenty of pores.
Adding pore-forming agents is also a convenient way to fabricating porous structures. Wu et al. immersed the composite PVA/PVC film in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by partially or preferentially dissolving the PVC at 25 °C for over 24 h to form a microporous structure.209,230 without affecting the PVA polymer host. The pore size of the composite membrane was in a range of 60–120 nm, and was crucially relevant to the composition and the size of the PVC fillers, as well as soaking period and the dissolution temperature. PVA with 10 wt% PVC had the most excellent ionic conductivity value of 0.0371 S cm−1 at 30 °C compared with other film affixing different PVC contents. In addition, the insoluble part of PVC could act as fillers and increases the amorphous phase area for a smoother ion migration. When used as a solid electrolyte, the cycle life of the secondary Zn anode was prolonged by 50 cycles. Besides, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely utilized as an excellent water-soluble polymer pore generator to improve the permeability and mass transfer capacity of the PVA hydrogels.103,231 After gelation and fixation, it can be washed with water or alcohol to form a pore-rich membrane.


4.2.5 Grafting hydrophilic groups. 
Chemical reaction and physical treatment techniques, such as radiation grafting, plasma modification, and ultrasonic infiltration modification play an essential role in the surface modification of polymers to optimize their properties. The introduction of hydrophilic groups can readily form inflated hydrophilic domains through H-bonds with water molecules, thereby increasing the water absorption and ionic conductivity.232
Sulfonation is a membrane modification technology that has been universally used in Nafion and other cation exchange membranes.233 In fact, such a technology can also be investigated in anion conducting membranes. The Wu group prepared a low-cost alkaline high-ion-conductive separator by non-woven polypropylene/polyethylene (PP/PE) membrane.24 With PP as the core and PE as the shell, different times of high-concentration sulfuric acid treatment at 90 °C were employed to obtain membranes with different sulfonation degrees. The hydrophilicity of the sulfonic acid groups can promote the electrolyte uptake and create a more amorphous structure. The room temperature conductivity increased from 0.0088 to 0.0175 S cm−1, as well as the battery power density from 16 mW cm−2 to 27 mW cm−2 by 69%. Later, the same research group treated the PP microporous membrane (Celgard) with 98% sulfuric acid.44 By prolonging the treatment time, the room temperature conductivity rose from 1.52 × 10−2 to 3.52 × 10−2 S cm−1. However, the sulfonation reaction would gradually destroy the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the microporous structure. Therefore, a balance should be achieved between electrochemical and mechanical performances to meet the requirements of different applications.
Grafting cationic hydrophilic groups, such as quaternary ammoniums groups, is a direct way to efficiently improve the IEC of solid electrolytes.206,234,235 In addition, functional modification of the polymer can expand the chain interspace, reduce the crystallinity, and increase the chain segment flexibility to develop OH− mobility. Chen and his fellows employed dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyl]ammonium chloride (DMAOP) to quaternary ammonium (QA) functionalize cellulose nanofibers and graphene oxide (GO),210 respectively, by a chemical combination through dehydration of silanol and hydroxyl. The QA-functionalized GO (QAFGO) was commutatively vacuum-filtered with cellulose nanofibers (QAFC) to make a laminated structure film. It was then cross-linked in an acetone solution of GA and ion exchanged in a 1 M KOH solution to obtain the AAEM (QAFCGO) with a thickness of 30–50 μm (Fig. 16a and b). After grafting the QA groups, the ionic conductivities of QAFGO and QAFC were significantly increased from 2.5 and 2 mS cm−1 to 39.0 and 25.0 mS cm−1 compared to GO and pristine cellulose (PC), respectively, which was because of the increased OH− content and transfer rate associated with grafted QA groups, as well as the conversion of a considerable proportion of the original crystal structure of PC into an amorphous phase with more available segment movements from XRD images (Fig. 16c). The QAFCGO-based Zn–air battery possessed a higher peak power density of 44.1 mW cm−2 than that of the A201-based one (33.2 mW cm−2). After a cycling test of 600 min duration, there was not any performance degradation (Fig. 16d).

4.2.6 Building ionic channels. 
Although raising the IEC of the AAEM can effectively improve the ion conductivity, the consequent high-water absorption and swelling will result in poor mechanical stability.236 Redistributing ion-exchange groups can construct efficient ion transport channels. Thus, even under low IEC, a higher ionic conductivity can be obtained, while the balance between mechanical stability and conductivity can be sustained. The current methods of constructing ionic channels principally comprise nanofillers compositing, and building hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase separation structures.
For compositing nanofillers with polymers, if the fillers are loaded with ion-exchange groups, a certain ionic channel structure can be formed between the polyelectrolyte matrix and the surface of the fillers, thereby promoting the conductivity. The Wei group introduced a quaternate cellulose nanocrystal (QCNC) into quaternate poly-(phenylene oxide) (QPPO) to prepare a nanocomposite AAEM.237 Compared with the same degree IEC of QPPO, the 2% (mass) QCNC/QPPO nanocomposite membrane had a large conductivity improvement (from 16.7 S cm−1 to 28.0 S cm−1). It was believed that the substantial increase in conductivity resulted from the QCNC effective ionic transport channels in the QPPO matrix. However, although this strategy has been widely studied in fuel cells, it has hardly been applied in solid ZABs or AABs, which requires more investigation in the future.
Apart from nanofillers compositing, the construction of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic microphase-separated morphology (the size of the phase separation is microscopic or submicroscopic, the two-phase structure only can be observed with high-resolution means) of AAEMs can concentrate hydrophilic domains and form short-range, high-efficiency OH− transport channels to improve the ion mobility.208,238,239 In addition, the microphase separation can assist the ion-exchange groups in gathering into ion clusters of a certain size,240–242 which can promote OH− transport. The Lee group utilized glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTAC) to quaternary ammonium (QA) functionalize polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).66 The uniform access of the QA groups into PVA chains produced a hydrophilic/hydrophobic separation on a nano-scale level, leading to fast ionic channels (Fig. 17a). After ion exchange with an aqueous tungstate solution, the TEM images clearly showed there were hydrophilic channels of 5–10 nm in the 2 wt% QA-functionalized PVA (2-QAFP) membrane, providing a limited nanometer space for the rapid transmission of ions (Fig. 17b). The schematic diagram of ion transmission illustrated that in the traditional PVA gel membrane, the arbitrary distribution of ion conducting sites between polymer chains made the ion transport appear ineffective and highly tortuous (Fig. 17c). When modified by GTAC with three-carbon hydrophobic chains, a more obvious phase separation made the ion transport process fast and efficient (Fig. 17c). Therefore, the ionic conductivity of the 2-QAFP was 17 times higher (46.8 mS cm−1) than that of the original PVA. The Qiao group developed a flexible AAEM comprising PVA/guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride (PGG-GP) that utilized glutaraldehyde (GA) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (PCL) as binary cross-linking agents, which also facilitated the formation of ionic channels.106 The fabrication process is shown in Fig. 17d. The PGG-GP film owned a room-temperature conductivity of 0.123 S cm−1 with satisfactory mechanical and thermal stability. The significant improvement of the conductivity can be attributed to the following two reasons: (1) the high carbon atoms' electron cloud density on PCL made the heterocyclic ring more active, therefore promoting the chain segments' movements and ion transmission; (2) the binary cross-linking assisted the construction of the more apparent microphase-separated structure and more massive hydrophilic ion clusters that easily built fast transport pathways for OH−, as confirmed by the AFM and SAXS shown in Fig. 17e–g.

5. Mechanical properties
The solid electrolyte, which acts as a separator between the cathode and anode, needs to have a certain degree of mechanical strength to resist external forces and anode dendrite penetration, which will damage the separator and cause short circuits. In addition to keeping the battery working normally and stably, people hope that it possesses excellent flexibility, deformability, stretching, compressing, and even foldability to meet the specific demands of portable electronic devices on special occasions.
5.1 Current research status
Most papers describe mechanical properties with water swelling ratio, stress–strain curves, and alkali resistance. A small swelling ratio indicates that the shape and volume of the membrane are less affected by water, so the ohmic polarization of the electrolyte–electrode interface is small with high stability.71 Generally speaking, AAEMs have lower water absorption and swelling ratios than GPEs, so that they have more stable contact surfaces with electrodes. Due to their rigid structures, the tensile strength of AAEMs can reach values of about greater than 10 MPa. On the contrary, since GPEs contain a large number of hydrophilic groups, they exhibit strong water absorption capacity (for example, PANa can absorb 220 times its own weight of water33) and a high concentration of alkali, which may loosen and even detangle the polymer segments (especially single linear polymers), thereby decreasing the mechanical strength (only less than 1 MPa) and stability of the electrolyte membrane. Taking the P-(AM-co-AA)/6 M KOH hydrogel for instance,31 with the volatilization of water, the tensile strength and elongation both increased slightly due to the reformation of hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains after the loss of water.
Although GPEs have weak tensile strength, they exhibit fascinating flexibility and deformability (up to 2000% elongation243). The reason is that the polymer segments rely on hydrophilic groups to form many reversible hydrogen bonds. These sacrificial bonds guarantee the macroscopically high-grade deformability and fatigue resistance of the electrolyte membrane by buffering and dissipating the external stress. In order to characterize the deformable devices in a practical way, some research groups conducted dynamic electrochemical characterization of flexible batteries in dynamically bending/releasing (DBR) or dynamically stretching/releasing (DSR) modes.244–246
Regarding alkali resistance, the maintenance of the mechanical and electrochemical performances, as well as the shape and morphology before and after lye immersion for a period of time can be used as a criterion for alkali resistance.58,186,247 Unfortunately, organic compounds are usually not stable in alkaline conditions because of the hydrolysis,41,47 and too many hydroxide ions will destroy the H-bonds interacting between the polymer chains there; hence, reducing the mechanical properties.248–250 Because of this, many stretchable materials lose their elasticity in a high pH environment. Additionally, the vast majority of quaternary ammonium-type AAEMs will have Hoffman elimination reactions with OH− and finally dissolve in an alkaline solution.251,252 To solve this, more stable cationic groups can be used,253 or the electronic structure and spatial structure of the polymer backbone can be adjusted to make it more difficult for the alkali corrosion reactions to occur.247
In short, a current important research subject is to develop the strength and functional applications of the polymer framework without significantly affecting the other properties of the solid electrolyte.
5.2 Improvement strategies
The essence of improving the mechanical properties of the solid electrolyte is mainly to enhance interactions between polymer chains. The interactions mainly include chemical covalent cross-linking, physical segment entanglement, and weak forces, such as H-bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals forces. The former improves the strength of the polymer skeleton, while the latter two ensure the toughness and deformability of the membrane. Improvement strategies mainly comprise cross-linking, building an interpenetrating network or dual network system, and adding supporting materials according to the existing reports.

5.2.1 Cross-linking. 
Cross-linking by physical or chemical forces is an efficient way of intensifying interaction among polymer chains. External stress can be conveyed to the overall network of the matrix through the cross-linked points, so that the polymer backbone will not be destroyed at vulnerable spots. For chemical cross-linking, on the one hand, we can add cross-linkers. Some materials carrying multiple functional groups, such as polyacids, polyols, or compounds containing two or more unsaturated bonds, such as divinylbenzene, diisocyanate, or N′N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA),62,254 can be fed together with monomers to form a cross-linked network by in situ polymerization. On the other hand, after the framework is formed, specific agents, such as glutaraldehyde and ethylenediamine, can be added to polymers with a certain number of functional groups to complete the cross-linkage by re-reaction between them.64 Often, adding small-molecule cross-linkers like GA may cause the cross-linking network to be too crowded, resulting in excessive rigidity, low mechanical stability, and inadequate hydration. Utilizing oligomers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) and diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), can obtain the appropriate degree of cross-linking without affecting the ion conduction.58 In addition, heat treatment or radiation helps to cross-link if the polymers themselves have active groups.100,255,256 For example, when the PAA–PVA mixture is heated at 140–210 °C, the carboxylic acid groups on PAA will interact with the hydroxyl groups on PVA, and the formation of ester bonds between them can significantly raise the mechanical properties.
As for physical cross-linking, polymers containing strong polar groups, such as –NH2 and –COO− or oppositely charged groups, can form weak interactions, such as H-bonds and ionic bonds. These reversible fracture-combined physical bonds help to enhance the deformation of the polymer framework, fatigue resistance, and a certain self-healing ability. When coupled with chemical cross-linking, it can further magnify the tensile strength, which is a very attractive feature for the preparation of flexible electrical devices working in harsh working environments. Hu and his fellows developed a non-flammable solid poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (P-(AM-co-AA)) alkaline hydrogel using MBA as the cross-linker.31 Strong covalent bonds ensured the high modulus of the copolymer framework. Meanwhile, there existed physical cross-links, which included (1) between the –CONH2/–COO− groups and water, which locked the water in the matrix to render a high ionic conductivity (0.148 S cm−1); (2) between –CONH2 and –COO−, which served as reconfigurable cross-links to create a sacrificial network. Under repeated tensile deformation, it can dissipate external stress to keep a high mechanical stability (Fig. 18a top). When imposing 101.1 kPa tensile strength, the elongation can reach 2290%. However, after 6 M KOH immersion, the mechanical properties exhibited a certain degree of degradation on account of the deprotonation of the –COO− groups in a high pH condition (Fig. 18a bottom). Finally, employing the in-plane electrode structure could insure the compact shape and desirable coplanar combination capacity of the Zn–air batteries (Fig. 18b), which can control the output current/voltage with series or parallel connection, and guarantee an available space for microelectronics compatibility (Fig. 18c and d).

5.2.2 Building an interpenetrating polymer network or a dual-network system. 
A single cross-linking polymer network often cannot provide enough mechanical durability and deformability due to its low cross-linking density. Therefore, people interject another polymer to form an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN); that is, two polymers in situ polymerized by one or two steps to form a stable single-phase cross-linking network. A semi-IPN is formed with one cross-linked polymer and a linear or branched one. An additional cross-linking system can provide extra mechanical strength.257,258 Different from two polymers independently forming a cross-linking network, if there are weak forces such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic bonds between them, this system is called “dual-network (DN) polymers.”105 In this system, the covalent framework network provides sufficient support and mechanical strength, while physical interactions can dissipate stress and deform through reversible fracture and connection. The “1 + 1 > 2” synergy effect of the DN polymers considerably promotes the mechanical strength and flexibility at the same time.31,259
The Zhi group applied cellulose (2.7% mol%, vs. AA monomers) as an enhancer,55 and synthesized the PANa–cellulose DN hydrogel by free radical polymerization, as shown in Fig. 19a. The synergetic effects of the chemical cross-linkings between PANa and MBAA, as well as between PANa and cellulose, the entanglements between chain segments, and H-bonds between PANa and cellulose enhanced the mechanical robustness, stretchability, and alkali resistance of the polymer. After permeating in 6 M KOH for 8 hours, the film still had an elongation of more than 1000% (98% retention vs. water) (Fig. 19b), while other broadly applied hydrogel materials such as PAA, PAM, and PANa were severely damaged, and the volume of the hydrogels was significantly extended (Fig. 19c). With a high OH− conductivity of 0.28 S cm−1 of the membrane, the obtained ultra-stretchable and flat ZAB displayed a high power density of 108.6 mW cm−2. The pre-stretched electrode structure, when stretched to 800%, further increased to 210.5 mW cm−2 with the larger electrode–electrolyte contact area.

Graphene oxide (GO) can be employed as an excellent physical cross-linking agent due to its abundant polar groups on the surface.260 Yu et al. developed a new kind of dual-network GO/PAM hydrogel with outstanding mechanical behaviors by the synergistic effects of GO and Ca2+ ions.130 When the hydrogel was stretched, the covalent PAM network preserved its primary state, while the Ca2+-induced GO network assisted the dissipation of imposed energy through rupturing and/or gliding of the weak cross-links piece by piece or transforming the network construction. In this way, the as-prepared GO/PAM DN hydrogel showed high toughness and super stretchability (up to 1350% its initial length). Recently, the Zhong and Hu groups prepared a basic GPE (KI–PVAA–GO) cross-linked with PVA, PAA, and GO.109 On the one hand, abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the PVA chains and the GO surface were cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, the second hydrogen bond network—PAA–PVA cross-linking was achieved through –COO− groups on the PAA chains and –OH groups on the PVA chains (Fig. 19d). The PVAA–GO hydrogel showed prominent mechanical properties with a higher tensile strength (67 kPa vs. 31 kPa) and breaking elongation (512% vs. 331%) than traditional PVA due to multiple cross-linking effects.


5.2.3 Adding support materials. 
In addition to the design of the solid electrolyte itself, the direct introduction of support materials, such as electrospun membranes, PP membranes, cellulose membranes, and paper, can enhance the mechanical stability without affecting the electrochemical performance.68,157,234,261 The Zhong and Deng groups developed one-dimensional knittable zinc–air batteries with PVA gel electrolytes.262,263 Chiffon tape and cellulose with good toughness and high porosity were successively used as separators and GPE reservoirs to prevent short circuits. The obtained fiberlike ZABs can be woven into clothes and power up various electronic equipments, providing a new idea for the energy sources of wearable and flexible electronic devices. The Zhi team grafted PAM onto gelatin by free radical polymerization using AM monomers, while injecting the mixture into a PAN electrospun fiber membrane as a supporter.139 For comparison, a pristine gelatin-based electrolyte without PAM addition or PAN membrane support was referred to as “GE”. The strength of the as-prepared hierarchical polymer electrolyte (HPE) membrane was improved to 7.76 MPa, which was about six-fold higher than that of GE. The PAN fiber holder effectively reduced the probability of the battery short circuits, and further boosted the intensity of HPE.

6. Electrochemical stabilities
The current research focuses on advancing battery stabilities by improving the catalytic activity and cycle lifetime of the ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst. However, for the solid type, it usually shuts down soon due to a series of problems on the solid electrolyte before the cathode catalyst fails. Therefore, the electrochemical stabilities of the solid electrolyte membrane also principally guarantee the long cycle life and storage time of the batteries. The influencing factors can be specifically divided into the following 6 points: Zn morphology changes, anode self-corrosion, solid electrolyte–cathode interface polarization, Zn(OH)42− migration, CO2 influence, and water loss. These problems will lead to enlarging the electrode–electrolyte interface ohmic polarization, unnecessary consumption of electrochemically active materials, and destruction of the electrolyte membrane structure, ultimately impairing the battery performances.
6.1 Zn morphology changes
Uniquely for rechargeable ZABs, the uneven current distribution on the anode and the concentration gradient of Zn(OH)42− in the electrolyte during charging will eventually lead to an irreversible redistribution of Zn on the electrode surface. Morphology changes involve shape changes and the formation of dendrites.117,264 For the former, the convective electrolyte flow will decrease the porosity structure and active Zn specific surface area during cycles, thereby reducing the kinetics of the Zn electrochemical reaction. For the latter, the growth of dendrites in certain sites will pierce the separator and cause short circuits. So far, scientists have tried many ways to reduce morphology changes. For the Zn anode, methods include (1) constructing a 3D zinc electrode structure to diminish Zn dendrite growth and expand the depth of discharge (DOD);265 (2) adding electrode additives, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, Bi, In, and Pb, to stimulate uniform current distribution;266 (3) coating a shielding layer on the Zn surface to produce an even deposition and inhibit dendrite growth, as well as the formation of byproducts.267,268 For the electrolyte, uniting ZnO, Zn(CH3COO)2, and other additives,269 or directly using room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as solvents can effectively improve the Zn electrodeposition status.270
For the solid electrolyte, the medium with insufficient fluidity may alleviate the dissolution and diffusion of Zn(OH)42− ions near the electrode surface, which can be smoothly and uniformly deposited on the Zn metal, exhibiting higher dendrite suppression and more desirable cycle performances.184,209,271Fig. 20a and b show the SEM images of Zn electrodes in Ni/Zn cells, utilizing 7.3 M KOH liquid solution and a potassium poly(acrylate) (PAAK) hydrogel, respectively, after 50 charge–discharge cycles.272 It can be seen that plenty of dendrites appeared in the case of the KOH liquid solution, while for the PAAK hydrogel, it showed uniformly distributed granular zinc deposits, indicating that polymer electrolytes can significantly inhibit the development of dendrites and improve cycle performances.

When fabricating a solid electrolyte, an increase of the cross-linker content will further decrease the dendrite growth on the Zn surface because the presence of a sturdier electrolyte film will generate a larger compressive stress field and limit any dendrite growth.273 With the usage of PAA–KOH and the increase of MBAA, the morphology variation on the Zn surface was decreased. However, a high cross-linking degree can result in an accumulation of the ZnO insulating layer, which inhibited the reverse conversion of the zinc hydroxide ions to metallic Zn, finally causing the failure of ZABs. Therefore, the moderate hardness of the solid electrolyte can meet both safety and performance of the battery.
6.2 Anode self-corrosion
Since the standard potentials of both Zn2+/Zn and Al3+/Al redox couples are lower than H+/H2, Zn and Al will inevitably react with water, leading to anode self-corrosion. The non-Faraday reactions will consume active materials, and hence decrease energy density under either load or non-load conditions. Apart from this, the accumulation of H2 will cause a series of safety problems. For traditional aqueous ZABs and AABs, the general solutions comprise (1) doping metal elements with higher hydrogen evolution potentials, such as Bi, In, Pb, Sn, and Ga, into anodes to make alloys;274 (2) adding corrosion inhibitors, such as sodium citrate, sodium stannate, and calcium oxide, into the electrolyte to adhere to the metal surface through physical adsorption or chemical reaction, separating it from the electrolyte to achieve corrosion inhibition;275 (3) employing non-aqueous room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)-based electrolytes or hybrid electrolytes to increase the electrochemical stabilities. However, the high viscosity and unaffordable price restrict their wide application.117,276 Furthermore, the water-in-salt system proposed in recent years has attracted great attention. The high-concentration salt solution can tightly confine water molecules around the ion hydration shell, so that it reduces the degree of water contacting with metal anodes and minimizes anode self-corrosion.277,278
Due to the restricted fluidity of the solid electrolytes, the level of anode self-corrosion can be effectively suppressed under both open-circuit and operation states.117 Nevertheless, the basic solution on the membranes' surface will still make contact with metal anodes, and may cause a hydrogen evolution reaction. To resolve this, apart from applying alloys or corrosion inhibitors like what aqueous batteries do,82,84,279 the usage of aprotic liquids (such as RTILs or deep eutectic solvents (DESs)) into the solid electrolytes will reduce the self-corrosion and increase the electrochemical window,280 through which secondary Al–air batteries can be achieved.281 Mori prepared a DESs-based electrolyte by immersing a commercial gauze into the mixture of AlCl3 and urea,281 utilizing carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and glycerin as the viscosity thickener and humectant, respectively, to obtain a solid electrolyte. The rechargeable AAB retained 97.8% of the initial capacity after 50 charge–discharge cycles. Byproducts such as Al2O3 and Al(OH)3 were not detected either on the air cathode or Al anode, demonstrating that the DESs-based solid electrolyte had a satisfying corrosion resistance and stable electrochemical performance.
Shifting the high-pH solution in the solid electrolyte to near-neutral conditions is another way to solve the corrosion problem of the anode.48,282,283 The Hu and Zhong team reported a new type of ZAB with a near-neutral GPE (PVA–NH4Cl/ZnCl2).72 It had lower Zn self-corrosion than alkaline GPE. XRD measurements of the Zn anode from alkaline and neutral GPE after storage for 3 days showed that for alkaline GPE (PVA–KOH), byproducts like Zn(OH)2 and ZnO were formed and coated on the Zn surface. However, for neutral GPE, the reaction path was changed as follows: NH4+ → NH3 + H+(10) Zn2+ + 2NH3 → Zn(NH3)22+(11)
The byproducts cannot be detected on the anode surface, indicating that Zn exhibited better stabilities in the neutral electrolyte. In the test of battery performance in a function of resting period, even after setting for 10 days, the neutral solid ZAB can stably cycle for 70 h. Conversely, the battery with alkaline GPE can hardly cycle for over 10 h after just 2 days of storage.
6.3 Solid electrolyte–cathode interface polarization
Although solid electrolytes are not like aqueous electrolytes that may flood over catalysts and cause leakage, the insufficient fluidity and wetting properties make the ORR/OER three-phase reaction only occur in the very restricted area of the electrolyte–electrode interface (Fig. 21).16 The interfacial resistance of OH− to transport over the catalyst surface is significantly larger than that of the liquid system. Moreover, as the water evaporates, the number of deficient reactive sites decreases, and the battery finally breaks down. To solve this, on the one hand, we can improve the water absorption and retention capacity of solid electrolytes to maintain adequate cathode reaction centers. On the other hand, the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the electrolyte–cathode interface can be adjusted to improve the mass and electron transmission.284,285

Utilizing hydrogel binders with water hydrophilicity and permeability, instead of the commercial hydrophobic binders like Nafion or PTFE, can effectively enhance ion/charge transfer.286 Zhao synthesized an agar chemical hydrogel (ACH) through chemical cross-linking of agar and glutaraldehyde.287 Experiments revealed that ACH as a binder could enhance the contact between conductive ions and electrode reactive materials, thereby reducing mass/charge transport resistance. The Lee group applied PTFE nanoparticles and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as hydrophobic and hydrophilic binders, respectively, to form a monolithic heteronanomat (MH) paper air cathode by the vacuum filtration method (Fig. 22a).288 The full discharge curves of the coin-type ZABs showed that the involvement of PTFE provided a more steady and better discharge platform than the controlled air cathode without PTFE because the latter was excessively hydrophilic and inhibited O2 from entering (Fig. 22c). The EIS curves for the cathodes with various CNFs contents showed that too much or too little CNFs would both increase the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) because the improper electrolyte penetration into the cathode was not favorable to the overall mass transfer of oxygen and hydroxide ions (Fig. 22d). Fig. 22b showed the picture of the airplane-shaped ZAB. With the CNF-based separator membrane, it had a cycling lifetime of over 900 min (10 min per cycle) at 1 mA cm−2 with no apparent voltage fading (Fig. 22e).

Compared with aqueous electrolytes, solid forms possess a unique advantage in that the membrane itself can be regarded as a carrier of the catalyst. The cathode materials can be directly coated on the electrolyte film without binders, which can significantly enhance the ion-electronic connection, thereby improving the battery performance. Fu et al. loaded the CoO0.87S0.13/GN bifunctional catalyst suspension on the previously prepared cellulose separator through the filtration method to make a binder-free cellulose membrane assembly (CMA) (Fig. 22f).289Fig. 22g shows the schematic image of the quasi-solid-state ZAB structure. For comparison, a control battery was manufactured by spraying the catalyst slurry with Nafion on the cellulose separator. The polarization curve showed that the binder-free ZAB performed better than that of the ZAB/Nafion. The energy efficiency and power density increased by 1.9 and 1.6 times at 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 22h and i). The Chen group adopted the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) technique to make a flexible ZAB.55 Specifically, the electrocatalysts and Zn powders were directly coated on the two surfaces of an alkaline anion exchange membrane (AT-1) before the membrane was hot-pressed. The CMC technology facilitated a three-in-one membrane design, which improved the catalyst utilization and established a better electrolyte/catalyst interface.
During charge, the generated oxygen bubbles will accumulate near the cathode to hinder the electrolyte–electrode contact and interfere with the subsequent discharging process if they do not escape in time. In order to improve the efficiency of the cycling performances, scientists have designed a tri-electrode Zn–air battery (Fig. 22j), where the ORR and OER reactions occur separately, and do not affect each other.23,291
6.4 Zn(OH)42− migration
Particularly for rechargeable Zn–air batteries, Zn(OH)42− ions should be enclosed near the anode to facilitate the smooth charging process. However, due to the concentration gradient, Zn(OH)42− ions are forced to transport through the electrolyte membrane to the vicinity of the cathode, and ZnO may be precipitated asymmetrically on the air electrode to block the transmission channels of oxygen and hydroxide ions at the three-phase interface, resulting in a decreased battery lifetime.234,292 Since Zn(OH)42− ions have the same charge as the conductive ion OH−, it is unlikely to use an AAEM to block their migration through the Donnan effect. Therefore, researchers try to adjust the polymer structure to control the zinc hydroxide species mobility through geometric factors. Although the issue of the selective diffusion of ions in solid electrolytes of ZABs is essential, it has hardly gained enough attention. It was not until 2016 that the first article dedicated to quantitatively studying the diffusion of Zn(OH)42− in solid electrolyte membranes for Zn–air batteries has emerged.
Lee et al. developed a new style of electrospun nanofiber mat-reinforced elective composite membrane (ERC membrane),186 which was composed of a non-conductive electrospun polyetherimide (PEI) nanofiber mat as a support skeleton and PVA as an ion transport medium (Fig. 23a). Compared with small-sized OH−, bulky Zn(OH)42− may not pass through the free volume of the electrolyte filled within the PVA chains. Experiments showed that Zn(OH)42− diffusion coefficient of the ERC film was about 4 times lower than that of Celgard 3501 (D = 5.0 × 10−6 cm2 min−1vs. 19.2 × 10−6 cm2 min−1), while the difference of the OH− conductivity was not obvious. It demonstrated that ERC membranes could effectively inhibit the Zn(OH)42− crossover without deteriorating conductivity. When used for the performance test of ZABs, there were evident ZnO powders detected on the air cathode only after the 1st cycle with Celgard 3501 (Fig. 23b). In contrast, the ERC film remarkably repressed the generation of ZnO even after the 7th cycle (Fig. 23c), which displayed better discharge stability.

When alkaline zinc–air batteries are assembled with proton exchange membranes (PEM), such as Nafion, the battery voltage only expressed 0.4 V at 1.3 mA cm−2 because the Donnan effect only permits protons (H+ ions) and some other cations to pass through, but impedes OH− crossover.88 However, by appropriately adjusting the proportion of Nafion, the Donnan effect can control the degree of rejection of the same charged ions, selectively allowing hydroxide penetration and restricting Zn(OH)42− crossover. Subsequently, the same group physically mixed the OH− conducting hydrogel phase (PVA/PAA nanofiber mat) and Nafion solution by injection to obtain the polymer blend electrolyte membranes with bicontinuous anion-conducting/-repelling phases (noted as ‘PBE membranes’) (Fig. 23d).100 This manner combined the advantages of both phases, so that the solid electrolyte simultaneously owned high water absorption, ionic conductivity, and ion-selective permeability. Due to the Donnon effect of the Nafion phase, the conduction of the smaller OH− was slightly damaged, but the crossover of Zn(OH)42− was effectively suppressed compared to Celgard 3501 and PVA/PAA film (Fig. 23e–g). It was worth noting that in the full battery cycling test, the cell with PBE did not significantly deteriorate even after 2500 minutes, in contrast to the Celgard 3501 based one of 900 min. The selective ion transport bicontinuous phase provided new ideas for inhibiting the Zn(OH)42− migration.
The Lee group substituted the KOH solution with a near-neutral NH4Cl solution for ion exchange.66 The larger positively charged ions [Zn(NH3)6]2+ generated by discharge are difficult to move in the QA-functionalized PVA (QAFP) film. The Zn species diffusion coefficient (D) of the membrane was cut down to 3.45 × 10−6 cm2 min−1. In addition, the near-neutral environment can retard the self-corrosion and carbonation of solid electrolytes.
6.5 CO2 influence
For the unique semi-open system of metal–air batteries, the impact of CO2 in the air on alkaline electrolytes is a fundamental reason for the damage of the battery life. Experiments confirmed that using pure oxygen as the feed gas, the anode became the life limit (2500 h), while the cathode can only run for around 270 h in the air involving 409–1000 ppm CO2.293 The main reason for CO2 breaking the battery down is that when CO2 dissolves in the alkaline electrolyte, it consumes hydroxide ions to generate HCO3− and CO32−, which have low solubility and are easy to deposit on the air electrode, leading to the transmission restrictions of O2 and OH−. Besides, a small number of carbonate species will pass through the electrolyte and deposit on the anode, which can also impair the battery performance.85 Second, compared with hydroxide ions, HCO3− and CO32− have lower ionic mobility and slower transport kinetics, resulting in an adverse impact on the ionic conductivity.294,295 The current ways to alleviate CO2 erosion include (1) pre-purifying the air with alkaline solutions or chemical/physical adsorbents to reduce the CO2 concentration;296–298 (2) regularly replacing the electrolyte to remove any accumulated carbonate;11 (3) raising the ambient temperature to increase the solubility of carbonate to delay its precipitation.299 However, these methods are often cumbersome and require additional auxiliary devices to reduce the battery energy density. Recently, it has been reported that an amine-functionalized modified CO2 absorption membrane with a high uptake capacity (3.42 mmol CO2/gadsorbent) was covered on the gas diffusion layer, which greatly diminished the CO2 influence without affecting O2 transmission. The specific capacity of the ZAB improved from 762 mA h g−1 to 801 mA h g−1 with the CO2 absorption membrane.300
Although CO2 poses a severe threat to liquid metal–air batteries, theoretically, it has relatively less effect on the performance of solid batteries, which overcome the problem by inhibiting the formation of carbonates.43 The Qiao team conducted a CO2 poisoning test for liquid and solid zinc–air batteries (with CS/EMImC-co-EP/GO AAEM and Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs350 catalyst).107 Simply, the Zn–air batteries (liquid or solid) were stored in a CO2 atmosphere for over 20 hours before continuing the previous test, as shown in Fig. 24a. The electrochemical results are shown in Fig. 24b and c. In more than 20 hours' CO2 penetration, the power density of the liquid ZAB dropped rapidly, while the discharge performance of the all-solid-state flexible battery exhibited almost no change. This can be attributed to the solid electrolyte resisting CO2 erosion by inhibiting the formation of carbonate.

According to reports, at high current densities, the HCO3− and CO32− concentrations in AAEM will decrease during battery operation due to the so-called carbonate ‘self-purging’ mechanism.301 The phenomenon gets obvious when the current density increases. This is due to the higher speed of OH− generation in the cathode exceeding the absorption speed of CO2 in the ambient air, hence lowering the carbonate concentrations. Chen et al. operated a flexible Zn–air battery with 2-QAFC AAEM under flowing pure O2 and 20000 ppm CO2 pollutant gas for two hours, respectively, under open-circuit voltage (OCV).42 Afterward, they carried out a constant current cycle test at 250 A mg−1 and the results are presented in Fig. 24d. Compared to the pure oxygen atmosphere, the first larger polarization in the presence of CO2 may be attributed to the magnified transmission resistance of OH− and CO32− in the membrane. However, in the next 420 min period, the polarization of the battery gradually decreased with each cycle (Fig. 24d inset), until there was only a minimal polarization in contrast to the pure O2 group. The EIS results also showed that the polarization resistance dropped to almost the same as the pure oxygen environment under identical conditions after more than 2000 cycles (Fig. 24e). The above results indicated that the self-purging process reduced the residuary carbonate content in the 2-QAFC film, and stabilized the battery performance at a higher level.
Although solid metal–air batteries are superior to liquid ones on CO2 tolerance, OH− ions stored in the electrolyte membrane still have the danger of contacting CO2 and forming carbonates. Contemporary research studies on the CO2 resistance of membranes are mainly focused on anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), and the studies are in the infant stage. There still exists a lot of work to be done, such as carbonization and decarbonization in electrodes, carbonates mass transfer kinetics, limitations of the self-purging process, and the influence of the period and temperature on battery performances.295,302,303 In contrast to AAEMs, GPEs with more alkali content and less limitation on OH− may be more affected by CO2, but almost no one has specially managed to investigate on this. Employing a near-neutral electrolyte may effectively reduce the CO2 effect.72
6.6 Water loss
The importance of water in solid electrolytes is self-evident, and the water retention capacity plays a significant role in keeping the battery life (involving cycling and storage lifetime).109 On account of the semi-open system of metal–air batteries, water in the film can easily volatilize through the porous air cathode. Furthermore, O2 bubbles generated during the charge will carry off part of H2O, therefore making the hydrogel dry.23 With the gradual loss of water, the ion-electron conversion on the electrode–electrolyte interface will be remarkably reduced, thus leading to a large increase in the ohmic polarization and drastically shortening the battery life.304 Mohamad first studied the relationship between the ionic conductivities of PVA + KOH systems and storage time in a desert environment, and found that the conductivities of different alkali content systems after 100 days were generally 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than that of after 30 days.216 The results indicated that the existing water helps to maintain conductivity.
The most direct way to reduce water loss is to use sealing films with breathing holes to envelop the entire battery, such as plastic wrap, silica gel or breathable tape, to slow down the escape of water molecules.33,116 We can also adjust the polymer morphology, for example, the formation of a microscopic porous structure to trap most of the water, thereby cutting down water volatilization.78 Besides, adding hydrophilic materials, such as PAA, PAM, cellulose, GO, and SiO2, to the polymer framework can also increase the water retention capacity of the membrane. Abundant hydrophilic groups on the surface can stabilize water molecules through a great number of hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that the hydrogen bonds formed in the alkaline environment are easily destroyed by the free OH−, so the neutral electrolyte has better water retention.72 The Zhong and Hu group synthesized a TEAOH–PVA polymer electrolyte by adding tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) as a water retention agent and an OH− conductor into PVA.32 Owning to the hygroscopic nature of TEAOH, the membrane maintained above 60% water content (with 30 mS cm−1 conductivity retention) after 10 days of storage, which is much more stable than the KOH–PVA GPE with below 15% water content. The shelf life of the flexible ZAB was considerably improved compared to that of the GPE without water retention agent. After being placed in the open ambient environment for 2 weeks, the ZAB with TEAOH can still stably discharge for over 25 h and cycle for more than 30 h. Some other strategies referred to the design of PEMs, such as implanting ultra-high-water retention microcapsules or microspheres in the polymer film, can be adopted to provide long-term water retention.305–307
7. Summary and outlooks
In this review, we systematically introduced the concepts and categories of solid electrolytes for ZABs and AABs, the selection of electrolyte framework materials, and performance improvement strategies. Metal–air batteries have developed rapidly in the past twenty years due to their superior advantages. Today, with more advanced society and technology, the transition of metal–air batteries from the aqueous to the solid form is an inevitable trend for safety, stability, convenience and wearability. For diversified practical applications, solid-state batteries must be the best choice. In order to simplify the battery structure, we expect that the separator can isolate the positive and negative electrodes, and accommodate enough ions and solvents to replace the aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, the development of solid electrolyte membranes can be regarded as a process, in which the separator gradually possesses the function of electrolytes, i.e., the evolution and development of framework materials. For example, ZABs were first assembled into the simplest solid-state battery with non-woven fabric, Celgard, cellophane, and other separator materials that absorbed lye. By the beginning of the 21st century, alkaline polymer electrolytes have been discovered and promptly evolved, more hydrophilic artificial organic polymer, for instance, PVA, PAA, and PAM, can lock more alkaline electrolyte in their polymer frameworks. In 2016, the Chen group successfully applied the AAEM to solid Zn–air batteries for the first time. Furthermore, some biomass materials (e.g., cellulose, chitosan, xanthan gum, gelatin, paper) and inorganic materials (e.g., GO, SiO2, ZrO2) that are easy to form films have become expected candidates for the backbone of solid electrolytes. The use of cheaper and more environmentally friendly biomass materials and non-combustible, more stable inorganic materials may bring new concepts to the application prospects of flexible metal–air batteries.
Among them, PVA–KOH is the most used system. Some simple methods, such as cross-linking with GA and freezing-thawing to increase porous structures, can considerably improve its mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. However, due to its inherent deficient water retention, it is necessary to choose materials with better hydrophilicity. However, other commonly applied artificial framework materials (such as PAA and PAM with large water uptake) require certain synthesis steps. So, the development of solid electrolytes with simple preparation processes and excellent performances is very important both in research and practical fields.
In addition, how to improve various performances of alkaline solid electrolytes, such as conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stabilities, are the very key research issues.
7.1 Conductivity
Ionic conductivity plays a pivotal role in the electrochemical performance of flexible batteries. Although the conductivity of the alkaline GPE (10−1 S cm−1) far exceeds that of the organic GPE and the all-solid-state electrolytes (10−7 to 10−3 S cm−1), there is still a huge gap from the aqueous electrolyte, especially for AAEMs (10−3 to 10−2 S cm−1) with its rigid skeleton structure, such as the benzene ring and imidazole. Researchers have utilized various methods and strategies to increase the ion exchange capacity (IEC), ion mobility, and hydration degree of the electrolyte membrane to enhance the conductivity. The most direct way is to control the OH− content in the membrane, but too high of an alkali concentration will destroy the membrane structure and increase the viscosity, hence spoiling conductivity. Simple treatments, such as introducing other hydrophilic materials, adding fillers, fabricating porous structures, and grafting hydrophilic groups, can rapidly increase the conductivity. Also, other methods (such as building fast ionic channels) can considerably enhance the ion mobility, and can efficiently boost the conductivity even with a reduced IEC.
7.2 Mechanical properties
A very tough problem of the gel polymer electrolyte is the low modulus and feeble alkali resistance caused by a high electrolyte uptake. However, the rise of mechanical strength is often accompanied by the difficulty of ion movement and the resultant decreased conductivity. Therefore, maintaining the ionic conductivity (while promoting mechanical properties) is an important subject of the current research. The generally applied strategies mainly contain: (1) cross-linking. Chemical cross-linkage with small molecules is a very effective method to enhance the interaction between polymer chains. It is noteworthy that an excessive cross-linking degree will raise the rigidity of the electrolyte film and decrease its hydration level. Therefore, controlling the dosage of cross-linking agents is vital to obtain an outstanding electrolyte membrane. In addition, a relatively weaker physical cross-linkage, such as hydrogen bindings, helps buffer the external stress and make the polymer more flexible. (2) Building an interpenetrating polymer network or a dual-network system. The synergistic effect between the two polymers tends to achieve a performance improvement of “1 + 1 > 2”. The unique charm of dual-network hydrogels lies in its excellent deformable capacity and fatigue resistance, while maintaining a certain mechanical strength. The use of sacrificial networks to develop smart hydrogels is a pretty advanced field; for instance, with self-healing and self-repairing abilities to extend battery applications.260,308 (3) Adding support materials. When the solid electrolyte itself is insufficient or the battery structure is limited, it is a good choice to use a porous material with higher strength or toughness as a reinforcement.
7.3 Electrochemical stabilities
The electrochemical stabilities of the solid electrolyte itself and the contact interfaces with the positive and negative electrodes directly determine the discharge performance and storage/cycle life of ZABs and AABs. Solid-state battery issues related to metal anodes, such as Zn anode morphology changes and anode self-corrosion, can take reference from aqueous forms. Generally speaking, zincate ions are confined near the anode in the solid electrolyte, so that they can be more uniformly deposited. In addition, the restrained mobility of water and hydroxide ions is helpful for alleviating the metal anode self-corrosion, but the continuous accumulation of discharge products near the anode may aggravate passivation. For the interface between the cathode and the solid electrolyte, the polarization can be reduced by adjusting the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the cathode to improve the mass transfer in the liquid and gas phases. For the electrolyte membrane itself, the migration of Zn(OH)42−, CO2 influence, and water loss are essential subjects that need more attention. The diffusion of zinc hydroxide ions to the cathode is now mainly diminished by the ion size restriction effect to improve the cycle performance. In the future, a quantitative and in-depth analysis of the influence and mechanism of CO2 erosion of GPEs with more alkali content is necessitated. Modifying PVA to enhance its water retention or finding other high-water uptake materials is essential to prolong the lifetime of the batteries. In addition, researchers have recently begun to pay attention to the operation of energy storage systems at low temperatures (−20 °C).67,108 How to maintain the stability of various performances of the solid electrolyte at low temperatures is also a hot spot for future research.
To sum up, Zn–air and Al–air batteries are known for their low cost, safety, environment friendship, and high energy density, while the solid forms are portable, wearable, and have more stable performances. As the most critical component of solid-state batteries, solid electrolytes have gained more attention in the past 20 years, but a lot of work must still be done for commercialization. Furthermore, we believe that the framework material selection and performance improvement strategies we discussed above for solid electrolytes are not only applicable to ZABs and AABs, but also to other alkaline aqueous solid-state energy storage systems, such as Ni–Zn, Zn–MnO2, Zn–C batteries, or supercapacitors.

 	Fig. 13  Transport mechanisms that are possible for the hydroxyl anion in aqueous basic solid electrolytes. (Choosing quaternary-ammonium groups as an example of AAEMs, they can be hydrophilic sites in GPEs.) Transport can be the combination of these mechanisms. Transport mechanisms may occur according to the trend through the surface site hopping mechanism to Grotthuss mechanism, then to the diffusion migration mechanism with the increasing water content.
