    , Accepted 6th June 2016First published on 7th June 2016AbstractA new conjugated copolymer, PBTF-OP, based on meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-m-OP) and 2-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT) was designed and synthesized for application as the donor material in polymer solar cells (PSCs). PBTF-OP possesses a similar molecular structure to the well-known polymer PTB7-Th but different conjugated side chains on the BDT unit: meta-alkoxy-phenyl side chains for PBTF-OP and alkylthienyl side chains for PTB7-Th. Compared with PTB7-Th, PBTF-OP exhibits absorption with some blue shifts, while it possesses a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.45 eV and a slightly enhanced hole mobility of 1.25 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) versus a HOMO energy level of −5.30 eV and a hole mobility of 1.11 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) for PTB7-Th. The PSCs based on PBTF-OP:PC71BM showed a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.0% with a higher Voc of 0.86 V in comparison with a PCE of 8.3% and a Voc of 0.78 V for PTB7-Th. The results indicate that side chain engineering of BDT-based copolymers is an effective way to improve photovoltaic performance of polymer donors.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention for applications in renewable energy due to their advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, light weight and capability to be fabricated into large area flexible devices.1–5 The photoactive blend layer of the PSCs, which is sandwiched between an anode and a cathode, is composed of a conjugated polymer as the donor and a fullerene derivative as the acceptor.6,7 As is well known, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is determined by three key factors: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).8–10 These parameters are closely related to the optical and electrical properties of the polymer donors and the blend morphology of the active layer in the PSCs. Consequently, a promising polymer donor material should possess broad and strong absorption in order to obtain high Jsc, high hole mobility to achieve high FF, and a suitable molecular energy level matching that of the fullerene derivative acceptor to achieve high Voc.11 In addition, it is also essential for the polymer donor materials to feasibly form the optimal nano-scaled morphology in the blend film with the acceptor.12,13 Hence, main chain engineering (such as donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymerization) and side chain engineering (such as the conjugated side chain and electron withdrawing side chain) have been performed to tune the absorption, electronic energy levels and charge carrier mobility of the conjugated polymers. Recently, great progress has been achieved with a PCE over 10% for the PSCs based on narrow bandgap polymers as donors.14–19
Among various polymer donor materials, two-dimension (2D)-conjugated polymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT) with conjugated side chains exhibit superior photovoltaic performance due to their extended conjugation and enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions, which result in broader absorption and higher hole mobility.20–26 In addition, the molecular energy levels of the polymers can be effectively modulated by choosing suitable conjugated side chains.26 It is well known that the Voc of the PSCs is proportional to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the polymer donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor.27–29 The modification of conjugated side chains of the 2D-conjugated polymers has been confirmed to be an effective way to improve the Voc and hence the PCE of the PSCs based on the 2D BDT-based polymers. For example, in our previous work,30 two polymers PBT-OP and PBT-T were designed and synthesized, based on BDT with meta-alkoxy-phenyl side groups (BDT-m-OP) or alkylthienyl side groups (BDT-T), respectively. It can be found that the variation of side chains has a significant impact on the polymer's HOMO levels. From PBT-T to PBT-OP, the HOMO energy level decreased by 0.25 eV, the Voc of PSCs increased from 0.60 V to 0.78 V, and the final PCE of the PSCs based on PBT-OP increased by ∼36% compared with that of the devices based on PBT-T. Therefore, BDT with meta-alkoxy-phenyl side groups is an effective building block for promising donor materials with high Voc.
In this work, we synthesized a new copolymer PBTF-OP (as shown in Scheme 1), based on the meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted BDT (BDT-m-OP) and 2-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT) units. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymer were systematically investigated. Compared with the analogue polymer PTB7-Th based on BDT-T, PBTF-OP exhibits an absorption spectrum with some blue shift, while it possesses a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.45 eV and a slightly enhanced hole mobility of 1.25 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) versus a HOMO of −5.30 eV and a hole mobility of 1.11 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1) for PTB7-Th. The PSCs based on PBTF-OP:PC71BM showed a higher PCE of 9.0% with a higher Voc of 0.86 V in comparison with a PCE of 8.3% and Voc of 0.78 V for PTB7-Th, which indicates that PBTF-OP will be a promising polymer donor material for PSCs.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route of PBTF-OP is shown in Scheme 1. The monomer BDT-m-OP was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.30,31PBTF-OP was synthesized using a Pd-catalyzed Stille-coupling reaction. The polymer exhibits good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PBTF-OP and PTB7-Th were measured using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene as the solvent and polystyrene as a standard at a high temperature of 160 °C. The thermal stability of the polymer was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the TGA plot is shown in Fig. 1. The onset of decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss is ca. 390 °C, indicating that the thermal stability of the polymer is good enough for application as a photovoltaic material in PSCs.

Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of PBTF-OP and PTB7-Th (for comparison) in thin solid film, and the absorption spectra of their solutions in o-dichlorobenzene are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The detailed data of the optical properties of the two polymers are summarized in Table 1 for a clear comparison. In solution, PBTF-OP shows two distinct absorption bands in a short wavelength range of 300–400 nm and in a long wavelength range of 400–750 nm, which can be ascribed to the π–π* transitions of the backbone and the intra-molecular charge-transfer (ICT) of the polymer, respectively. The maximum absorption peak is located at 612 nm and a shoulder peak is at 674 nm. PBTF-OP in a solid film exhibits a slightly red-shifted absorption spectrum with a stronger shoulder peak due to the enhanced aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state in comparison with that in solution. Compared with PTB7-Th, the absorption spectrum of PBTF-OP exhibits obvious blue-shifts both in solution and in solid film. The absorption peak of PBTF-OP film is at 674 nm in comparison with that (702 nm) of PTB7-Th film, which can be ascribed to the weaker electron-donating ability of the phenyl side chains in PBTF-OP in comparison with the thienyl side chains in PTB7-Th.32 The absorption edge (λedge) of PBTF-OP films is at 766 nm which corresponds to an optical energy bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.62 eV according to Eoptg = 1240/λedge. In comparison, λedge of PTB7-Th films is at 790 nm corresponding to an Eoptg of 1.57 eV.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure the electronic energy levels of the two polymers. As shown in Fig. 2b, the onset oxidation potentials (φox) of PTB7-Th and PBTF-OP are 0.60 V and 0.74 V vs. Ag/Ag+, while their onset reduction potential (φred) is −1.38 V and −1.37 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. According to the equations,33,34 HOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(φred + 4.71) (eV), the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation/reduction potentials. The LUMO levels of PTB7-Th and PBTF-OP are −3.33 eV and −3.34 eV and their HOMO levels are −5.30 eV and −5.45 eV, respectively. Compared with PTB7-Th, the HOMO energy level of PBTF-OP is down-shifted by 0.15 eV, which is beneficial for higher Voc of the PSCs with the polymer as the donor, since the Voc of PSCs is proportional to the difference of the LUMO level of the electron acceptor and the HOMO level of the electron donor.
Furthermore, theoretical calculation by density functional theory (DFT) was carried out to evaluate the influence of conjugated side chains on the electronic properties and energy levels of the two polymers. To simplify the calculation, we replaced the long side chains by methyl groups. The calculated frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI† and the corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels are also listed in Table 1. The HOMO surfaces of the polymers are delocalized along the whole π-conjugated backbones, while their LUMO surfaces mainly localized on TT acceptor units and partially delocalized on the BDT donor segment. The variation trend of energy levels is consistent with the results from the CV measurements.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to study the crystallinity of the polymers. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of PBTF-OP and PTB7-Th films cast from o-DCB. The film of PBTF-OP showed pronounced (100, 200) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.4° and 10.6°, respectively, arising from the alkyl chain packing with the d-spacing of ∼16.4 Å. In contrast, the film of PTB7-Th exhibited weak diffraction peaks located at similar positions as those of PBTF-OP. Furthermore, both polymers exhibited strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.6°, corresponding to the (010) π–π stacking with the d-spacing of 3.9 Å. These results indicate that alkoxyphenyl-conjugated side chains instead of alkylthienyl-conjugated side chains in PBTF-OP were beneficial for the ordered molecular packing.

Hole mobilities of PBTF-OP along with PTB7-Th for comparison were also measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Au, and the corresponding plots are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The hole mobility of PBTF-OP is 1.25 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is slightly higher than that of PTB7-Th (1.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).
PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated and characterized to investigate the photovoltaic performance of the polymer. First, the D/A (PBTF-OP:PC71BM) weight ratios in the blend active layer of the devices were optimized. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices with different D/A ratios (1:1, 1:1.5 and 1:2, w/w) are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† We found that the optimal D/A weight ratio is 1:1.5.
In order to optimize the morphologies of the blend films and thus to improve their photovoltaic properties, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive.35–37Fig. 4a and b show the J–V curves of the PSCs based on polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) with a different content of DIO as the solvent additive under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the corresponding devices, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the devices processed with the DIO additive showed an enhanced Jsc and FF and a slightly decreased Voc in comparison with the device without additive processing, which could be ascribed to the variation of surface composition and the bulk morphology of the blend films.38 When 1.5% DIO additive was used, the devices based on PBTF-OP:PC71BM exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.0% with Voc = 0.86 V, Jsc = 16.5 mA cm−2 and FF = 63.2%. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE curves of all the devices cover a broad wavelength range of 300–750 nm. When adding 1.5% DIO as the solvent additive, the EQE of the device enhanced remarkably in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 750 nm. The integral current density values deduced from the EQE curves and the standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5G), as also listed in Table 2, agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurement, within 2–3% mismatch. In addition, the PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM were also fabricated under the same conditions, and their photovoltaic performances are also shown in Fig. 4 and listed in Table 2 for comparison. The PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM with the treatment of 1.5% DIO solvent additive showed a PCE of 7.7% with Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 16.0 mA cm−2 and FF = 60.9%. For the optimized device with the treatment of 3% DIO additive, the PCE reached 8.3% with Voc = 0.78 V, Jsc = 17.1 mA cm−2 and FF = 62.4%, which are similar to the results reported in the literature.39 Hence, by replacing alkylthienyl groups in PTB7-Th with meta-alkoxy-phenyl groups in PBTF-OP, the Voc of the PSCs increased by 0.08 V, while the Jsc and FF changed little; the final PCE increased from 8.3% to 9.0%. Considering that the molecular weight of the polymer has a great influence on the device performance, two other batches of PBTF-OP and PTB7-Th with different molecular weights were synthesized as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI.† The corresponding PSCs were fabricated according to the above optimized conditions. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† It can be seen that all the devices based on PBTF-OP exhibited better performance than the PSCs based on PTB7-Th with different molecular weights.

For explaining the effect of the DIO additive concentration on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, we measured the XRD patterns of the blend films of PBTF-OP:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) with different contents of DIO as the solvent additive, as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† The blend film of PBTF-OP:PC71BM with the treatment of 1.5% DIO additive showed the pronounced (100) diffraction peak and (010) diffraction peak of PBTF-OP at 2θ = 4.8° and 19.5°, respectively, corresponding to the d-spacing of 18.4 Å and 4.5 Å, respectively. In contrast, the blend film of PTB7-Th:PC71BM with the treatment of 3% DIO additive exhibited a weaker (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.3° and a (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 19.5° corresponding to the d-spacing of 20.5 Å and 4.5 Å, respectively. The more ordered molecular packing of PBTF-OP in the blend film with the DIO additive treatment is beneficial for the better charge transportation and the improved photovoltaic performance.
To investigate the effect of the morphology on the device performance, the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). According to the AFM images shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 0.89 nm, 1.48 nm and 1.63 nm for the blend films processed without additive, with 1.5% DIO and with 3% DIO additive, respectively, indicating that the phase separation of the blend was enhanced with the increase of the additive amount. As shown in the TEM images in Fig. 5, the blend films processed with 1.5% DIO as the additive exhibited a clear continuous fibrillar network with the suitable phase separation and domain size, which are beneficial for the exciton separation and charge transportation in the blend film.
 Fig. 5  TEM images of PBTF-OP:PC71BM blend films: (a) without DIO, (b) with 1.5% DIO additive treatment and (c) with 3% DIO additive treatment. 
In addition, the electron and hole mobilities of the blend films processed without or with 1.5% DIO additive were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S9 and Table S2 in the ESI,† the blend film with DIO treatment exhibited higher hole and electron mobilities and more balanced charge transport than the blend film cast from DCB, which is beneficial for the higher Jsc and FF. These results are consistent with variation of photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices.
In conclusion, a new 2D-conjugated copolymer based on BDT-m-OP and TT units, PBTF-OP, was designed and synthesized for application as donors in PSCs. The absorption spectra, electronic energy levels and photovoltaic properties of the polymer were characterized. Compared with PTB7-Th, PBTF-OP exhibited a more deeper HOMO level of −5.45 eV and a slightly higher hole mobility, despite the blue-shifted absorption spectra. The optimized PSCs based on PBTF-OP:PC71BM showed a PCE of 9.0% versus 8.3% of PTB7-Th with the same device structure. The results indicate that PBTF-OP will be a promising donor material for high performance PSCs.
Experimental section

The chemical raw materials were purchased from Aldrich, TCI Chemical, J&K and Alfa Aesar, respectively, which were of reagent grade and used without further purification. PC71BM was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. The monomer (BDT-m-OP) was synthesized according to previously reported procedures.30,31 The monomer (TT) was purchased from Suna Tech Inc.
Synthesis of the polymer PBTF-OP
In a 50 mL round bottom flask, BDT-m-OP and TT were dissolved in 10 mL toluene and 2 mL DMF. After being flushed with argon for 20 min, 17 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the flask as the catalyst, and then the mixture was flushed with argon for another 30 min. The solution was stirred at 110 °C for 13 hours under an argon atmosphere and the reactant was cooled down to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated into 100 mL of methanol. The polymer was collected by filtration and subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform in the end. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure and precipitated into 100 mL of methanol. The polymer was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. Three batches of polymers with different molecular weights were obtained by tuning the polymerization time.

PTB7-Th was synthesized with the similar procedure.
Instruments and measurements

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were measured on an Agilent arx-400 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out on a flash EA1112 analyzer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured by using an Agilent Carry-5000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 acetonitrile solutions at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The three-electrode system included a Pt disk, Pt plate, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The potential of the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode was internally calibrated by using the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), and the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode possessed an energy level of −4.71 eV. The molecular weight of the polymer was measured by the GPC method with polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene as the solvent at 160 °C using an Agilent Technologies PL-GPC220. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Discovery TGA from TA Instruments Inc. under a nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance Instrument at 40 kV voltage and 200 mA current with Cu Kα radiation. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the surface morphology of the samples were conducted on a Dimension 3100 (Veeco) Atomic Force Microscope in the tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN instrument at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The current–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 2450 Source Measure Unit. The power conversion efficiencies of the PSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a SS-F5-3A (Enli Technology Co. Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade, 50 mm × 50 mm photo-beam size). EQE measurements were performed at a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technololy Co. Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The thickness of the photoactive layer was measured by using a KLA-Tencor D-100 (KLA-Tencor Inc.).
Device fabrication
The PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. Subsequently, the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate was treated by using UV-ozone for 20 min. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) solution (Clevious P VP AI 4083, H. C. Stark, Germany) was then spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrates, and then dried by baking in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min to get PEDOT:PSS films with a thickness of ∼40 nm. The photosensitive blend layer was prepared by spin coating the o-dichlorobenzene solution of polymer and PC71BM on the PEDOT:PSS layer. And then, 20 nm Ca and 100 nm Al was thermally deposited in a vacuum under a pressure of 4 × 10−4 Pa. Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the other fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere of a nitrogen dry box containing less than 10 ppm oxygen and moisture. The effective area of one cell is 4 mm2.
