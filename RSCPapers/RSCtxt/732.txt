    First published on 9th April 2015AbstractThere is currently a large effort to improve the performance of low cost renewable energy devices. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are emerging as one of the most promising low cost photovoltaic technologies, addressing “secure, clean and efficient solar energy conversion”. Vegetable dyes, extracted from algae, flowers, fruit and leaves, can be used as sensitizers in DSSCs. Thus far, anthocyanin and betalain extracts together with selected chlorophyll derivatives are the most successful vegetable sensitizers. This review analyses recent progress in the exploitation of vegetable dyes for solar energy conversion and compares them to the properties of synthetic dyes. We provide an in-depth discussion on the main limitation of cell performance e.g. dye degradation, effective electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of semiconducting nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, outlining future developments for the use of vegetable sensitizers in DSSCs. We also discuss the cost of vegetable dyes and how their versatility can boost the advancement of new power management solutions, especially for their integration in living environments, making the practical application of such systems economically viable. Finally, we present our view on future prospects in the development of synthetic analogues of vegetable dyes as sensitizers in DSSCs.

1. Introduction
Increasing concerns about the energy crisis, climate change, decreasing availability of fossil fuels and environmental issues are motivating the research on sustainable and renewable energy resources.1–4 The key for the success of this goal lies in the development of efficient energy conversion and storage devices. Energy management, used to decouple the timing of generation and consumption of electric energy, is also fundamental for cost reduction and/or increasing income from electricity and heat generation.
Renewable energy has been estimated to be half of newly installed electric capacity worldwide in 2010 and is becoming progressively more important with a total of 20.8% of the current global electricity production,5 with a prediction to reach 25% by 2018.5
The sun can provide the ultimate solution to the challenge of a sustainable energy supply. In one hour, the earth receives 13.6 TW from the sun, more than what we currently consume in a whole year (13 TW). Photovoltaic (PV) cells convert sunlight into electricity.6,7 They allow power to be produced near the end user, avoiding transmission losses and costs, and are gaining interest for applications in many sectors of daily life, from mobile devices8 to building integrated PV.9–12
Current PV technology is dominated by silicon (Si) solar cells,13 with energy conversion efficiency (η), see Section 3, up to ∼24.7%.14 Despite significant development over the past decades,15 high cost limits their widespread use. The purification to metallurgical-grade Si has high energy demand and creates significant amounts of hazardous by-products.16 Thin film solar cells such as amorphous silicon (a-Si),17 cadmium telluride (CdTe),18 copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS)19 and thin film crystalline Si20 are known as second generation PVs. The development of thin film solar cells has been driven by the potential of manufacturing costs reduction. However, for example, the less expensive Si alternative, a-Si modules suffer the Staebler–Wronski (SW) degradation.21 In a typical a-Si solar cell the η is reduced by up to 30% in the first 6 months as a result of the SW degradation.22 The effect is temperature dependent so that performance of PV cells tends to recover some in the summer months and drop again during winter time.22 This light induced degradation is the major disadvantage of a-Si as a PV material.23
The third generation PV cells aim to achieve a similar or higher η than Si solar cells by using novel light absorbing materials.24,25 A recent development is the meso-super-structured solar cell,26 based on an organic halide perovskite (e.g. CH3NH3PbX3 where X is bromine, iodine, chlorine, or their combination) as photosensitizer,26–29 and an organic hole-transport material.27Ref. 27 reported η = 15.6% in a meso-super-structured (perovskite) solar cell for an un-optimized device, while η = 20.1% has been recently reported on the NREL Best Research-Cell Efficiency chart and developed at KRICT (Korean Research Institute of Chemical Technology).30 Nevertheless, perovskites may not satisfy sustainability requirements, due to their lead content. Organic PV cells can be manufactured economically compared with Si cells, for example by a roll-to-roll process31 or other coating techniques.32 Another class of PV cells, known as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),33 relies on the dye-sensitization of the semiconductor band gap,34 and allows reaching η ∼ 13% exploiting porphyrin sensitizers and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) at the counter electrode (CE).35 Because of their simplicity and low cost, DSSCs have great potential for large-scale applications, especially when transparency and high η under cloudy and artificial light conditions are needed.
Metal–organic dyes (mostly ruthenium34,36 and osmium37 polypyridil complexes) have been used as efficient sensitizers. The preparation routes for metal complexes are often based on multi step reactions involving long, tedious and expensive chromatographic purification procedures.
In contrast, natural dyes and their organic derivatives are ideal candidates for environmentally friendly solar cells, since they are non-toxic, low in cost, renewable and abundant. Thus, the possibility to achieve solar energy conversion exploiting natural dyes has been largely investigated,38–41 suggesting a cheap and simple approach based on the chemical and physical processing of these dyes, avoiding any hazardous waste by-products. In particular, vegetable dyes can be easily extracted from fruit, leaves, flowers and algae, see Fig. 1, and used in DSSCs.38–49 This approach has been proposed since 1993, when ref. 38 clarified the photo-electrochemical properties of chlorophylls (from the Greek “chloros” = green and “phyllon” = leaf) in DSSCs achieving η = 2.6%. The same group47 has also exploited anthocyanins (from the Greek anthos = flower and kianos = blue), a class of water-soluble, vegetable dyes extracted from flowers, e.g. malvaceae, anthurium, and leaves, e.g. Norway maple, as DSSC sensitizers. Ref. 47 extracted anthocyanins from California blackberries, achieving η = 0.56%. Apart from the mere η value achieved, more importantly, ref. 42 initiated an intense research activity for the exploitation of natural dyes in DSSCs. Betalain (from the Latin Beta vulgaris, the beet from which betalains were first extracted) dyes represent another class of vegetable dyes that have been exploited in DSSCs39,41 achieving η up to 2.7%.50 These dyes are present in different parts of plants, in particular in caryophyllales,51 including flower petals, fruits, leaves, stems and roots.
 Fig. 1  Dyes extracted from chlorophylls, anthocyanins, betalains and carotenoids exhibiting colors covering the entire visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the figure are also shown the pictures of the dyes and the molecular structures of chlorophyll a, cyanin (anthocyanin), betanin (betalain) and cis-norbixin (carotenoid). 
In this review we will present an in-depth analysis of the most significant advances made in the use of vegetable dyes in DSSCs. In Section 2 we briefly highlight the device structure together with the analysis of the key component parameters and the working principle of DSSCs, in Section 3 we introduce the main figures of merit (FoM), Section 4 is dedicated to a brief overview on both inorganic and synthetic organic dyes to contextualise the use of vegetable dyes in DSSCs. In Section 5 we focus on an in-depth discussion of vegetable dyes, in Section 6 we introduce synthetic analogues of anthocyanins, in Section 7 we analyse the scaling up perspective and the costs, and finally in Section 8 we outline the aspects for future development.
2. Device structure, key component parameters and the working principle
A DSSC is a new “type” of photo-electrochemical solar cell, the concept of which traces back to Becquerel's work on the PV effect almost two centuries ago.7 A typical DSSC (see Fig. 2) is assembled using a sandwich-type approach, placing in succession a nanocrystalline mesoporous film sensitized with a dye molecule, an electrolyte solution containing a redox system, and a catalyst coated onto a conductive substrate, usually made with a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) on glass.33 The most widely investigated TCOs for DSSCs are the semiconductor-based ternary compound fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)52 and indium tin oxide (ITO).53,54 The latter is the widest used transparent conductor (TC) in many other optoelectronic applications such as touch screens and displays.55 Unfortunately, ITO suffers severe limitations: an ever-increasing and fluctuating cost56 due to indium scarcity, although this issue is still debated,57 processing requirements,58 difficulties in patterning58,59 and sensitivity to both acidic and basic environments.55,65 Although many other TC materials have also been proposed as window electrodes for DSSCs such as doped oxide-based thin films (ZnO:Al (AZO),60 and ZnO:Ga (GZO)61), metal-oxide (ZnS/Ag/ZnS,62 ZnO/Ag/ZnO,63 and ZnO/Cu/ZnO64), and many others,59 FTO is the reference TCO in DSSCs because it has the highest work function (i.e., 4.9 eV vs. 4.8 eV of ITO),65 best thermal stability, mechanical and chemical durability, associated with the least toxicity and most of all the lowest cost with respect to all the aforementioned materials.65 Carbon-based nanomaterials,66e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNTs)67 and graphene,68,69 have also been proposed as TC electrodes. However, the performances, i.e. sheet resistance, Rs, and transmittance, Tr, of the current carbon-based TC are below the requirement for PV application, i.e. Rs = 10 Ω □−1 and Tr = 90%.70 In addition, DSSCs exploiting graphene-based TCs have achieved so far71 unsatisfactory η values, thus more work is needed to improve Rs and Tr of these materials before they can be fully exploited as TCs in DSSCs.

Commonly, the photoanode consists of high porosity nanocrystalline nanoparticles (10 to 20 nm in diameter) e.g., wide band gap semiconductors (usually the n-type semiconductor titanium dioxide – TiO2 – with a bandgap of 3.2 eV).4 Other nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO)72 or hybrid materials e.g. TiO2/ZnO73 have been proposed as scaffolds for the photoanode, but with lower performances, i.e. η, with respect to the ones achieved with TiO2 nanoparticles.33 The mesoporous photoanode is sensitized with a self-assembled layer of dye molecules (photosensitizer) anchored to the semiconductor surface.33,74 This represents the main difference with respect to the conventional Si-solar cells, where both light absorption and the generated charge carrier transport are carried out by the same material, i.e. Si.13 In contrast, in DSSCs the functional element responsible for light absorption (dye molecules) is separated from the charge carrier transport material itself.75 The photosensitizer acts as an electron pump, i.e., absorbs the visible light, pumps an electron into the semiconductor, and accepts an electron from the charge mediator and then repeats the cycle again and again.33 To fulfil such requirements the dye must necessarily possess the following properties:
(i) its absorption spectrum should cover a broad range of wavelengths ranging from the visible to the near-IR region of the solar spectrum,
(ii) its molar extinction coefficient (ε, M−1 cm−1) must be as high as possible to enable efficient light harvesting.
Furthermore, in order to ensure both efficient electron injection into the photoanode and an efficient regeneration process it is indispensable that:
(iii) the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)76 level of the dye should stay energetically above the CB edge of the semiconductor while,
(iv) the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)76 of the dye must be below the energy level of the redox mediator to allow efficient regeneration of the oxidized dye77,78 (see Fig. 2).
(v) The electron injection pathway is optimized when the dye is strongly anchored onto the semiconductor surface.
Polypyridine complexes of transition metals such as ruthenium,34,36,79–86 osmium,37,79,87 cobalt,88 iron,89 copper,90 rhenium,91 as well as a large variety of metal-free synthetic organic-dyes, such as coumarin,92,93 triarylamine,94,95 tetrahydroquinoline,96,97 indoline,98–100 squaraine,101,102 and others such as phthalocyanins103–107 and porphyrins108–111 together with vegetable38–49 and artificial bio-inspired dyes112 have been used as sensitizers in DSSCs.
The as-prepared photoanode is then faced to the CE with the liquid electrolyte solution containing a redox couple (e.g. iodide/triiodide, I−/I3−) placed in between.33 In the first nanostructured DSSC, a LiI/I2 redox couple dissolved in acetonitrile (AcN) was used achieving η = 7.1%.33 The use of AcN113 is intrinsically related to its chemical stability114 and low viscosity (0.361 mPa s).115 Moreover, AcN does not absorb light in ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, a characteristic necessary for photochemical and photoelectrochemical experiments.116 Furthermore, AcN is a well-known polar solvent (dielectric constant is ∼36 at room temperature – RT).117 Solvent polarity strongly affects both electron and energy transfer (see Section 6), key processes for photochemistry and photoelectrochemistry.118
Thus, thanks to the aforementioned properties,118 AcN became a common solvent for DSSC applications, mostly at the laboratory scale.222 Nevertheless, AcN has also some drawbacks such as toxicity119 and low boiling point (78 °C).120 The latter is a practical disadvantage for long term DSSC endurance due to the leakage of the solvent due to volatility.121
With the aim of overcoming some of the aforementioned critical factors (e.g. toxicity, volatility, leakage), alternative nitrile liquids such as methoxy acetonitrile (MAcN),118 3-methoxypropionitrile (MePN),118 glutarinonitrile (GN),122 ethyl123 and butyl124 cianine, as well as cyclic ester (e.g., ethylene125 and propylene carbonate126 or lactone solvents such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL)127 have been widely investigated. Ionic liquids128 characterized by electrochemical stability together with high viscosity129 (e.g., ∼30 mPa s for [Bmin]-[Tf2N])32 and low vapour pressure (e.g., 100 pPa at RT for [C4mim][PF6]130 compared with 3 kPa for H2O131) have emerged as further promising alternatives to liquid solvents.
However, the high viscosity and low ionic mobility of ionic liquids negatively affect the η of the ionic liquid-based DSSCs because the aforementioned properties limit the diffusion rate of the iodide and tri-iodide. To solve this limitation, mixing ionic liquids with high boiling solvents such as sulfolane has been recently proposed.132 DSSCs based on these new electrolyte formulations have shown excellent stability (exceeding 2320 h under full sunlight at 60 °C).132
In the last decade, fervent research activity has been devoted to replace the liquid electrolytes by solid-state133–136 or quasi-solid-state electrolytes.137,138 Commonly, a quasi-solid-state electrolyte is composed by an organic polymeric matrix incorporating a liquid electrolyte to form a stable gel network structure via physical or chemical interactions.139–142 Owing this sol–gel character, quasi-solid-state electrolytes possess both the cohesive properties of solids143 (the work of cohesion, i.e. the energy per unit area required to separate two flat surfaces from contact)144 and the diffusive transport (i.e., high ionic conductivity) characteristics of liquids, overcoming the disadvantage of volatility of liquid electrolytes. This favours the wetting of the mesoporous dye-coated nanocrystalline TiO2 film by the electrolyte and also the regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules.145η of 6.1% was achieved for a DSSC using a ruthenium dye (Z907, see Section 4.1) and a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte system based on 1,3:2,4-di-O-dimethylbenzylidene-D-sorbitol(DMDBS)/3-methoxypropionitrile.140
Concerning solid-state electrolytes, currently, there are two main classes investigated in DSSC applications. One is based on a solid compound (e.g., polyethylene oxide) containing the I−/I3− redox couple,146–148 while the other makes use of a hole transport material (HTM), such as the spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene).123,149,150 Wang et al.147 reported η = 6.7% using N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium iodide (P1,4I)-doped succinonitrile electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple. A solid-state electrolyte containing I−/I3− by introducing TiO2 nanoparticles into poly(ethylene oxide) was used to fabricate a DSSC as reported by Stergiopoulos et al.,146 obtaining η = 4.2%. More recently, ref. 151 achieved η = 9.48% exploiting N719 dye and a structurally interconnected block copolymer, prepared by the oligomerization of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented diamine and 4,40-oxydiphthalic anhydride, followed by curing to generate amide-imide cross-linked gels.
Although the first attempt to use spiro-OMeTAD, reported by Bach et al. in 1998,149 resulted in low η (0.74%), the development in the subsequent years of this solid electrolyte permitted to achieve η up to 3.2%.150 More recently,152 chemical doping of a spiro-OMeTAD-based DSSC by tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) Co(III), (FK102) has allowed the achievement of η = 7.2%.
Several other materials such as CuSCN,153 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),154 polyaniline155 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),135 have been investigated as HTMs for DSSCs with η = 4.5% for P3HT and 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM).156 Recently, Kanatzidis and co-workers157 reported an all-solid state inorganic solar cell formed by a p-type direct band-gap semiconductor CsSnI3 (doped with SnF2) as HTM, nanoporous TiO2 and the dye N719 achieving η = 10.2%. This result was obtained with a solvent free DSSC, thus overcoming the issue of electrolyte leakage, solvation of the dye by the electrolyte solvent and, at the same time, preventing the corrosion of the catalyst (see below) by the electrolyte.157
The third main component of DSSCs is the CE. The role of the CE in a DSSC is twofold, first it back transfers electrons arriving from the external circuit to the redox system,33 second it catalyzes the reduction of the oxidized charge mediator.33 The key requirements for CEs are low charge-transfer resistance – Rct (i.e., the electrode–electrolyte interface resistance), high exchange current density (i.e., the rate of electron transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode), and a high specific surface area (SSA). Commonly, CEs are made of a few nanometre thick platinum (Pt) layer, acting as a catalyst,33 deposited onto TCO or, in the case where transparency is not an issue, on a highly conductive and reflective substrate such as stainless steel.158 Apart from the limiting factors of ITO and FTO discussed above, Pt is costly other than having limited reserves on earth.159 Moreover, Pt tends to degrade over time when in contact with the I3−/I− liquid electrolyte, reducing the η of DSSCs.160 Thus, the replacement of Pt with low-cost and/or more effective (leading to high η devices) materials is at the centre of on-going research effort. In this context, several groups have used carbon-based nanomaterials as catalysts in the CE, such as amorphous carbon,161 CNTs,158,162 hard carbon spherules,163 graphite,163 GNPs,164 nitrogen-doped GNPs,165 graphene oxide (GO)166–168 and hybrid structures of GNPs–RGO–CNTs169,170 with results, i.e., η, close to or exceeding the ones based on Pt. Indeed, a new high record efficiency of DSSCs (η = 13%) has been achieved exploiting GNPs at the CE.164
In the following, we briefly summarize the working principle of DSSCs, considering TiO2 as semiconductor oxide and I−/I3− as the redox couple. Photo-excitation of the dye results in the injection of an electron in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 with the consequent oxidation of the dye.33 The cell produces voltage over and current through an external load connected to the electrodes, see Fig. 2.
The photocurrent yield of a DSSC is the outcome of competitive photo-electrochemical reactions which take place at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and can be summarized below: Dye + hν → Dye* Light absorption (excitation)(1) Dye* + TiO2 → Dye+ + eCB− (TiO2) Electron injection (k ∼ 10−12 s)(2) 2Dye+ + 3I− → 2 Dye + I3−  Dye regeneration (k ∼ 10−6 s)(3) I3− + 2e−catalyst → 3I− Electrolyte regeneration (reduction)(4)
A schematic picture of the architecture and electron transfer processes taking place in a sandwich type solar cell is shown in Fig. 2. When illuminated, the dye molecules capture the incident photons (hν) generating electron–hole pairs.33 The photo-excited electrons, at excited states (Dye* see eqn (1)), which lie energetically above the CB edge of the TiO2, are quickly (typical time constant k, around 10−12 s, under one sun illumination, i.e., irradiation power = 100 mW cm−2, T = 25 °C, spectral intensity distribution of the light source = AM 1.5 global standard solar spectrum171) injected (eqn (2)) into the CB of TiO2.33 Due to the photo-induced charge carrier transfer from the dye to the semiconductor oxide, the electronic density in TiO2 increases giving rise to an electrochemical potential difference (ΔV) between TiO2 and the electrolyte.34 Regeneration of oxidized dye-molecules is accomplished by capturing electrons from the electrolyte mediator, eqn (3), sandwiched on the cathode, that catalyses the reduction of I3− (eqn (4)).33 Thus, in this circumstance, the entire cycle is regenerative (i.e., regenerate the oxidized sensitizer) and the overall balance of the process will be the conversion of photons to electrons without any permanent chemical transformation.121 Thus, under ideal conditions, a stable cell delivering photocurrent open-endedly is expected. However, several “undesirable” processes limit the electron transfer at the photoanode.47 These loss pathways include the decay of the dye excited to ground state and the “re-capture” of injected electrons in the semiconductor CB by the oxidized dye or by the electrolyte species (eqn (5)–(7)). Dye* → Dye decay of the dye excited state (k ∼ 10−10 s)(5) Dye+ + eCB− (TiO2) → Dye + TiO2 recombination (back reaction, k ∼ 10−4 s)(6) I3− + 2e−CB (TiO2) → 3I− + TiO2 electron capture from mediator (dark current, k ∼ 10−2 s)(7)Thus, the optimization of DSSCs requires that the electron injection (eqn (2)) and the dye regeneration processes by the electron donor mediator (eqn (3)) must be faster than the decay (radiative or non-radiative) of Dye* (eqn (5)) and the back reaction of the injected electron with the oxidized dye (eqn (6)), respectively.33 In particular, the “dark current” is considered as the main loss mechanism for a DSSC.172,173 Finally, the “efficient” regeneration of the charge mediator at the CE (eqn (4)) is fundamental; otherwise the device η could be limited.33,172 A deep knowledge and understanding of the electron-transfer kinetics is key in identifying materials for the optimization of the structure–function relationship of DSSCs.36,174
Extensive studies on the electron injection mechanism have been performed by numerous research groups and a plethora of experimental and theoretical data have been published.175–195
3. Figures of merit of DSSCs
The main FoM that characterize the performances of a DSSC are summarized below:
(i) The short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) generated under 1 sun represents the photocurrent per unit area (mA cm−2) of the cell when, under irradiation, it is short-circuited. Higher is the JSC, higher is both the capability of the sensitizer to absorb sunlight over a wide region of the solar spectrum, and the “efficiency” to inject electrons in the semiconductor CB (eqn (1), (2) and (3), respectively). Moreover, a high JSC value is strongly linked with the reduction rate of the oxidized dye (eqn (3)). Indeed, quicker is the reduction of the oxidized dye, lower will be the dark current (see eqn (6)), which reduces the JSC.171
(ii) The open circuit voltage (VOC) is the electrical potential difference at open circuit (no current flow) between the two terminals (photoanode and CE) of the cell under illumination conditions. The maximum VOC value of a DSSC (generally around 0.8–0.9 V) corresponds to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level (EF, −0.5 to −0.4 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode – NHE, for TiO2)189 of the semiconductor and the redox potential of the charge mediator (−0.4 V vs. NHE, for I3−/I− redox couple).189 However, actual VOC is lower than the theoretical values depending on both the recombination of the injected electrons with the oxidized dye (eqn (6)) and the dark current (eqn (7)). Indeed, for regenerative photo-electrochemical systems:171 (8)where kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T the absolute temperature, e the elementary charge, Iinj the charge flux resulting from sensitized injection, kred the reduction rate constant of I3−, while ncb and [I3−] are the concentration of electrons at the semiconductor surface and oxidized redox mediator (I3−) in the (I−/I3−) solution, respectively.196,197
(iii) The fill factor (FF) is defined by the ratio: (9)where Pmax is the maximum power output of the cell per unit area, given by the product (Jmax·Vmax).
In a current–voltage (J/V) curve, the FF describes how well the area under J/V curve fills-in the maximum rectangle described by the product JSC·VOC (see Fig. 3). The shape of this curve represents a very useful and direct tool to characterize the DSSC performance, (i.e., VOC, JSC and η).
 Fig. 3  Typical current–voltage curve (filled circles). The FF corresponds to the shaded region, which is bounded by the Vmax and Jmax, divided by the area of the region which is bounded by the VOC and JSC. The blue curve (open circles) shows the power as a function of voltage. 
(iv) The Incident Photon Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) or external quantum efficiency (EQE) is a measure of the quantum efficiencies of the cell at a given excitation wavelength (λ) and corresponds to the photocurrent density generated in the external circuit per incident monochromatic photons flux that strikes the cell.13 Under short circuit conditions, its value (as a function of λ) is calculated using the following equation:39 (10)where Φin(λ) is the photon flux of the incident monochromatic light. The IPCE can also be expressed as the product of the light harvesting efficiency [LHE(λ)] for photons of wavelength λ, the Φinj (quantum yield of electron injection) from the excited state of the sensitizer to the CB of the semiconductor and the collection efficiency Φcoll of the injected electron at the front electrode: IPCE = LHE(λ)ΦinjΦcoll(11)where the LHE(λ) is given by: LHE(λ) = 1–10−A(12)The exponent A in eqn (12) is the dye absorbance or optical density while, the product (ΦinjΦcoll), which appears in eqn (11), is the absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency [APCE(λ)] or internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Finally, Φinj is given by:34 (13)where kinj is the rate constant for Φinj into the semiconductor, while kr and knr represent the radiative and nonradiative rate constant, respectively.
The IPCE thus is directly correlated both to the absorption properties and the amount of adsorbed sensitizer on the semiconductor surface (or LHE) as well as the Φinj and Φcoll.
(v) The energy conversion efficiency (η) of the cell, defined as the ratio between the maximum output electrical power (Pmax) and the energy of the incident light (Plight) is given by the relation: (14)
4. Inorganic and synthetic organic dyes
The dye plays a key role in DSSCs. Based on the requirements outlined in Section 2, different dyes have been studied and significant progress in designing sensitizers for DSSC applications has been made. Here, we briefly summarize the main properties of inorganic and synthetic organic-based dyes.
4.1 Metal complexes
Metal complexes consist of a central metal ion with ancillary ligands (L), typically bipyridines (bpy) or terpyridines, bearing at least one anchoring group198 able to link the dye to the semiconductor surface in a dye–bridge–anchor array. This circumstance causes a large electronic interaction (coupling) between the π*-orbital of the ligand, which is the lowest LUMO of the complex, and the d-orbital of semiconductor oxide, resulting in electron injection from the metal complex into the semiconductor CB. Typical anchoring groups for metal oxide semiconductors are sulphonic acid (–SO3H),199–201 phosphonic acid (PO)(OH)2,185,202–204 carboxylic acid (–COOH)205–207 and its derivatives (acid chlorides,208 amides,209 esters209 or carboxylate salts209), with carboxyl groups being largely used.172 The carboxyl group can form bidentate-bridging-linkage (Fig. 4a), as well as chelating- (Fig. 4b) or ester-linkages (Fig. 4c) with the TiO2 surface,198 depending on the structure of the dye, the binding groups, the pH, and the metal oxide synthesis.210

Light absorption in the visible and near-IR regions of the solar spectrum is attributed to a metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT)211 transition. In this regard, polypyridine complexes of d6 metal, such as Ru(II),79,81,84 Os(II)79,84 or Ru(I),91 are typical examples of compounds characterized by intense bands in the visible region due to MLCT transition.211 The MLCT energies can be tuned by proper selection of the substituents (alkyl, aryl, heterocycle, etc.) on the ancillary ligand, as well as by changing the ligand itself.212 Usually, electron-withdrawing substituents, such as the carboxylic group,213 decrease the π*-orbital energy of the polypyridine ligand.213,214 In contrast, electron-donating substituents, such as thiocyanate (SCN)- or the amine group or alkyl chains, show the opposite effect.213,214
Several types of dyes have been engineered215,216 since the 1991 pioneering publication of O'Regan and Grätzel's paper on DSSCs based on trinuclear Ru-complex dye (consisting of three ruthenium atoms held together by polypyridine bridging ligands).33 However, up to date, the most successful metal-complex sensitizers, in terms of both η and long thermal stability, have been the ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complexes with carboxylated anchoring groups.209 These complexes are characterized by a broad absorption band extending from the visible to the near infrared (NIR), excited and ground state energy levels matching the semiconductor CB energy levels and electrolyte's redox potential, respectively, coupled with IPCE over 80% in the visible region, high ε, and electrochemical stability.217 The most efficient Ru-polypyridyl sensitizers are cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine)-Ru(II), coded as N3,34 N719218 (doubly deprotonated form of N3 dye) and tri-thiocyanato-4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine)-Ru(II), coded as N749 or black dye.36,83,219 The N3 dye is characterized by absorption maxima centred at 380 and 518 nm and a ε = 1.35 × 104 M−1 cm−1 in alkaline solution at 500 nm.220 Similar spectral features are shown by N719 (ε = 1.42 × 104 M−1 cm−1).221 N749 (ε = 7.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1),36,83,225 differently from many dyes (e.g. N3 and N719), thanks to its three SCN− functional groups, absorbs light from the visible to the NIR, showing a brown-black colour. In terms of performances, N3 and N749-based DSSCs have similar VOC (∼720 mV), with η = 10% and η = 11.1%, for N334,220 and N749,83 respectively. N719, which has the same structure as N3, where two H+ at two carboxyl groups are substituted by two tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) groups, exhibits η = 11.2%.218,220–222
The development of new synthesis pathways has been the main strategy to improve the PV performance achieved with the N3 and N719 dyes. A strong research effort has been made to design many ruthenium-photosensitizers, characterized by different peripheral ligands and/or different numbers and types of anchoring groups.214 Furthermore, fundamental studies to understand the parameters (spectral response of dye, ε, redox potential of sensitizer, suppression of dye aggregation, efficient electron injection, etc.) that influence the η of DSSCs have been performed.214 Hara et al.223 investigated a series of four carboxylated Ru(II)–phenanthroline complexes, which are different for the number and position of carboxyl groups on the phenanthroline ligand. Amongst the four selected dyes, cis-bis(4,7-dicarboxy-1,10-phenanthroline)-dithiocyanato-ruthenium(II), Ru(dcphen)2(NCS)2-(TBA)2 has shown the best performance achieving η = 6.6%.223 The position and number of anchoring groups (carboxyl) on the ancillary phenanthroline ligands affect significantly the electronic coupling metal complex–semiconductor, essential for efficient electron injection.223 A mono-cationic bipyridyl–ruthenium complex with a strongly electron donating β-acetylacetonate ligand (3-methyl-2,4-pentanedionate)224 instead of two thioisocyanato groups, has shown, in alkaline solution, η = 6.0%. This sensitizer has an intense visible light absorption (ε = 1.35 × 104 M−1 cm−1) with low energy MLCT maxima at 525 nm and a band tail, which allows light absorption beyond 600 nm.224 Islam et al.,225 synthesized a biquinoline (biq) complex of Ru(II), having a MLCT transition red-shifted with respect to N3. Unfortunately, the lowest excited MLCT state of this complex was not energetically favorable to effectively inject electrons into the TiO2 CB giving rise to low IPCE (∼20%) at 450 nm.225 More recently, a sensitizer built on tridentate bipyridine pyrazolate (bpz) ligand coupled Ru(II) complexes (coded as HY2),226 with absorption peaks at 437 and 550 nm and ε (=1.98 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 550 nm) higher than N3 (ε = 1.35 × 104 M−1 cm−1),220 has been designed and synthesized.226 A DSSC with this emerging HY2 sensitizer reached η = 8.07% and IPCE = 82% at 530 nm.226 A ruthenium dimer sensitizer based on N3 structure called K20, with η similar to those achieved by N3 and N719 dyes when integrated in DSSCs, has been reported to have a ε = 2.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 520 nm.227 This ε value is higher than those of both N3 and N719 dyes. The advantage of increasing the ε of sensitizer relies in the possibility to decrease the semiconductor thickness and thus reduce cost, as discussed in Section 7.
Since 2003, Wang et al.228–230 developed a novel amphiphilic ruthenium complex, named Z907, which, in combination with 1-decylphosphonic acid (DPA) used as a co-adsorber prevents the aggregation of dye molecules. Z907-based DSSCs achieved and maintained stable performances (η = 7.3% and IPCE = 83% at 540 nm) under long-term (∼1000 h) thermal stress.229 The hydrophobic alkyl chains attached to one of the bipyridine ligands prevents the desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface because the water molecules penetrated into the electrolyte.228,229 Small amounts of water induce dye desorption, due to hydrolysis effects or weakening of the interactions at the dye/semiconductor oxide surface.231 Furthermore, the presence of water molecules in the electrolyte undermine the DSSC long term stability due to the oxidation of iodide to iodate (IO3−), instead of tri-iodide (I3−),231,232 which cannot be reduced at the CE.232 This effect results in I3− progressive depletion and the subsequent decrease of the cell performance.232 Another synthesized Ru-based dye, i.e., Z910,233 an heteroleptic Ru-complex, characterized by an extensive π-conjugated system of the bipyridine ligand to enhance the harvesting of solar light, has been synthesized and demonstrated as a highly efficient (η = 10.2%, IPCE = 83% at 520 nm) and stable sensitizer for DSSCs. A better η = (10.8%) with respect to Z910,233 was achieved by Nazeeruddin et al.,234 who developed a Ru(II)-based sensitizer, named N945, whose absorption spectrum in AcN solution, dominated by MLCT, is characterized by two bands at around 400 and 550 nm, with ε = 3.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Driven by the need to design absorbers with high ε values (see Fig. 5), novel ion-coordinating dyes such as K51 (ε = 1.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1),235 K60 (ε = 1.85 × 104 M−1 cm−1) (ref. 236) and K68 (ε = 1.14 × 104 M−1 cm−1) (ref. 237) have been developed by extending the π-conjugation of the peripheral ligands with the introduction of an electron donating group in the molecular structure.235–237 This class of sensitizers, when incorporated in DSSCs, exhibits η ∼ 8%.235,236 In particular, K51 dye has shown η = 7.8%,235 while higher efficiency (η = 8.4%) was achieved with K60.236 Better thermal stability than other dyes such as K51 was obtained with K68, thanks to the increased hydrophobicity of the dye, due to the incorporation of an additional alkyl chain into the donor ligand.237 Kuang et al.237 achieved η = 6.6% exploiting a binary ionic liquid electrolyte (i.e. 1-propyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII) and 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMIB(CN)4)), while higher η (7.7%) was obtained using a non-volatile MePN-based electrolyte.237

In 2008 Gao et al.238 developed very promising amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizers, coded as C101 and C102 having alkil-thiophene or furano moieties attached to the ancillary bpy ligand. These moieties were able to enhance the light-harvesting capacity of the complexes by increasing their ε. The MLCT absorption bands appear at ∼407 and ∼547 nm with ε = 1.75 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and ε = 1.68 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for C101 and C102, respectively. When integrated in DSSCs, C101 dye with the 4,4′-bis(5-hexylthiophenen-2-yl)-2,2′byp ligand, has shown η = 11.3%.238 Cao et al.239 synthesized a C101-sensitizer analogue, named C106, where a sulfur atom was inserted between hexyl and thiophene groups. The use of C106 thin photoactive layers, having ε = 1.87 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 550 nm, allowed the construction of a DSSC with η = 11.29%.239 The optimization of the TiO2 film has permitted the achievement of η = 11.9%.240 In an attempt to extend the π-conjugation length of Ru(dicarboxyl-bipyridine)(L)(NCS)2 sensitizers able to absorb in the red part of the electromagnetic spectrum and thus investigate the effect on the photochemical properties, other amphiphilic heteroleptic dyes incorporating thiophenes or phenyleneviniylenes on the ancillary ligands, such as K19,241 K77,242 CYC-B1(Z991)243 and CYC-B11244 have been synthesized. Concerning chemical stability, the SCN− donor ligands are believed to be the weakest part in the SCN–bpy–Ru(II) complexes and in this regard, a new-generation of SCN-free cyclometalated ruthenium sensitizers have been designed.245–250 Although thus far, their η remains below 10% (e.g. η = 9.54% with the dye TFRS2),246 a very promising result was obtained with the YE05 complex.80,251,253 This dye was designed replacing the SCN− by a cyclometalated 2,4-difluorophenyl-pyridine, obtaining η = 10.1% when integrated in DSSCs.253 Very recently, ref. 252 developed a phosphine-coordinated Ru(II) sensitizer, called DX1, which when used in a DSSC achieved η = 10%. See Table 1 for a summary of Ru-based DSSCs.

As briefly discussed above, Ru(II)–polypiridil complexes have been considered as reference dyes for many years and used as a base for designing other Ru-dyes.
To develop sensitizers with better photoelectrochemical properties than Ru-based ones, there is the need to overcome some drawbacks exhibited by these dyes: (i) a limited absorption in the near-IR region of the solar spectrum, (ii) a rather low ε (e.g. ε = 2.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for the K20)227 requiring thick TiO2 films (∼8 μm) in order to efficiently capture the incident light, avoiding both low VOC (large dark current) and low FF (high electrolyte resistance) values, (iii) a rather poor thermal stability, (iv) the use of rare metal, such as ruthenium coupled with the complex synthesis route based on multi step procedures25 involving tedious and expensive purification processes, which burden on the total cost of the DSSC,254,255 see Section 7 for costs analysis. In this regard, performance/price ratio will play a pivotal role in the future choice of various PV cells. Nevertheless, apart cost related issues, ruthenium compounds are toxic and carcinogenic.256
Alternative sensitizers based on platinum257,258 and iridium259 complexes, have been developed, but so far their η (e.g., ∼3% for Pt257) in DSSCs is lower than that achieved with Ru-complexes, see Table 1. Other inorganic compounds, such as osmium polypyridine complexes, have also been investigated as sensitizers in DSSCs.37,79,260 These compounds exhibit a broader absorption range and photo-action spectrum (the spectrum reporting the IPCE) with respect to Ru-based one.84 However, osmium-based DSSCs suffer very low η, mainly due to slow electron transfer from the iodide electrolyte to the osmium dye cation.84 Apart from the poor electrochemical performance achieved to date with osmium compounds, it is also important to point out that bulk metallic osmium is scarce261 and when in the form of micro-sized particles it becomes pyrophoric262 (i.e. ignites spontaneously). Moreover, all osmium compounds, such as osmium tetraoxide, OsO4, should be considered highly toxic.263 Indeed, OsO4 concentrations in air as low as 10−7 g m−3 can cause lung congestion,264 as well as skin and eye damage.264
4.2 Synthetic organic dyes
In order to replace the noble and expensive Ru(II)-complexes in DSSCs,265 other sensitizers have been proposed as alternative such as the synthetic organic dyes.25,94,99,100,266–282 These dyes exhibit many advantages with respect to the aforementioned metal-based ones, such as: (i) efficient light-harvesting capabilities (e.g., in the near-IR region), (ii) higher ε, which depends on the fact that for this dyes the transition involved in the absorption of the light is π–π*, which generates a Ligand Centered (LC) excited state that is not distorted as MLCT state populated in the case of Ru(II) based ones,213 (iii) easiness in tailoring the molecular structure and photo-physical characteristics.
Porphyrin and phthalocyanines as well as chlorin and bacterio(chlorin) and all the chlorophylls (discussed in Section 5.3) belong to the class of macrocyclic tetrapyrroles.283,284 The difference between these compounds depends on the level of reduction of the macrocyclic tetrapyrrole, see Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Basic structures and the oxidation state of cyclic tetrapyrrole sensitizers: porphyrins, 17,18-dihydroporphyrin = chlorins; 7,8,17,18 tetrahydroporphyrin = bacterio (chlorin), and phthalocyanins. The IUPAC numbering system of the carbon skeleton is also reported. 
Porphyrins are composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their α carbon atoms via methine bridges (CH–).285 The porphyrin macrocycle has 22 (18 delocalized) π-electrons (according to the Huckel model) and it is a highly conjugated system.285 Porphyrins typically have very intense absorption bands in the visible spectrum while they weakly absorb in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum.286
Phthalocyanines are macrocyclic compounds consisting of four isoindole (benzo-fused pyrrole)287 groups linked by nitrogen atoms in a large π-conjugated planar structure. This particular configuration allows phthalocyanines to also absorb light of wavelengths longer than 650 nm.285,306 As a general rule, depending on their reduction state, tetrapyrrole macrocycles afford λmax tunability.288
Porphyrins109–111,289 and phthalocyanines103–107 have a rigid molecular structure, possessing high ε (>105 M−1 cm−1).290 Moreover, they can be easily functionalized (e.g., porphyrins at the meso and β positions (see Fig. 6)), allowing the tuning of their optical, physical and electrochemical properties.291
The nature of the frontier orbitals (i.e., HOMO and LUMO) in porphyrin macrocycles has been an active area of research for computational and spectroscopic investigations. The absorption spectra of porphyrin derivatives show two characteristic π–π* absorption regions, the weak Q band (transition to the first excited state (LUMO)) in the 550–700 nm range and the intense Soret band (transition to the second excited state (LUMO + 1)) in the 400–450 nm range.292Ab initio methods (restricted Hartree Fock, local DFT)293 have shown that metal-free (e.g., thiophene substitute294) and metal (Mg(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II)) containing porphyrins generally possess two a1u and a2u orbitals as the HOMO and HOMO − 1,294 see Fig. 7. The electron density in the a1u type orbital is essentially localized on the Cα and Cβ atoms of the pyrrole rings, while in the a2u orbital it is mainly confined on the pyrrole nitrogens and on the meso-carbons,294 see Fig. 6. As for the case of the HOMO, also the LUMO levels are similar in metal free (e.g., thiophene substitute) and metal containing porphyrins: there are two nearly degenerate e2g(π*) orbitals essentially centred on the porphyrin macrocycle,294 see Fig. 7. The presence of a1u(π) and a2u(π) orbitals in many metal porphyrins can account for the formation of a π radical cation that plays an important role in the biochemical function of porphyrins. For example, the π radical cation formation is key in the photooxidation of chlorophylls, which are essentially Mg containing porphyrins, see Section 5.3.
 Fig. 7  Schematic of π–π* transitions (responsible for the Soret and Q bands) for porphyrins. 
Porphyrins are used in oxygen sensor devices295–298 and in photodynamic therapy.299 These two applications are principally based on the changes in the photoluminescence intensity of porphyrins by molecular oxygen that quenches their triplet excited states.300 Porphyrins have also been used as catalysts in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions301 and in energy conversion devices.109–111,289
In particular, bio-inspired by natural photosynthesis, different research groups exploited porphyrins as photosensitizers in DSSCs.109–111,289 After the first experimental study carried out in 1993 with a porphyrin of type copper chlorophyll (η = 2.6%),38 beta-linked zinc porphyrins (see Fig. 6 and Table 2) have been developed afterward with η = 7.1% reported in 2007.111 Meso-linked zinc (see Fig. 6 and Table 2) porphyrin sensitizers were reported in 2009.302 These sensitizers achieved η = 11%, comparable to the best η achieved by ruthenium-based ones (N719, N749 and CYC-B11, see Table 1), in 2010.108 With a structural design involving long alkoxyl chains to enclose the porphyrin core (YD2-o-C8 dye) suppressing the dye aggregation suffered by zinc porphyrins,303 the DSSC achieved η = 12.3% in 2011 with co-sensitization of a synthetic organic dye (Y123, a donor-π-bridge acceptor) and a cobalt-based electrolyte.304 The Y123 has a complementary absorption spectrum with respect to YD2-o-C8, characterized by low absorption in the green part of the electromagnetic spectrum.304 The co-sensitization effect resulted in better PV performance (η = 12.3%) with respect to DSSCs using a single dye (e.g., YD2-o-C8, η = 11.9%).304

In the last year Mathew et al.164 reported a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, which features the prototypical structure of a donor–π-bridge–acceptor, which both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and improves light-harvesting properties. The obtained η of 13% is the current record high η of DSSCs.164
Phthalocyanines and their metallo-derivatives have been, for a long time, a very well-known class of materials for their industrial applications as dyes.305 More recently these compounds have been receiving growing interest in other areas306,307 such as chemical sensors,308 electrochromic displays,309 conducting polymers,310 photodynamic cancer therapy,311 liquid crystals,312 catalysts,313 and PVs.103–107
Although phthalocyanines have some advantages for DSSC applications with respect to porphyrins such as strong absorption in the red (Q band at ∼700 nm), p-type semiconducting properties and thermal stability,107 they suffer some limitations such as very poor solubility and strong aggregation when deposited on the surface of the semiconductor.214 Moreover, phthalocyanines are not as efficient as porphyrins109–111,164 when used as sensitizers in DSSCs. Indeed, despite many efforts having been made314–319 (see ref. 214 for a more exhaustive discussion) since the pioneering work of Grätzel's group,314,315 the η currently achieved is quite low (∼3%).103,320
As discussed above, for macrocyclic tetrapyrrolic sensitizers, ruthenium free hybrid-organic dyes have shown potential as efficient photosensitizers.304 Nevertheless, the search for alternative metal free (porphyrin and phthalocyanine often contain metals, e.g., zinc) and green dyes is essential for the further large scale development of DSSCs. Hara et al.266 have made a remarkable advance in the use of synthetic organic dyes for DSSCs increasing the η with respect to state of the art synthetic organic sensitizers. Recently, the interest in synthetic organic dyes has raised considerably. Horiuchi et al.268 first synthesized an indoline organic dye D102 which was the precursor of a broader indoline sensitizer family. After structural optimization, Ito and co-workers100 developed an indoline organic dye, D205 (see Table 3), achieving an IPCE in the visible region of over 80% and η = 9.4%. Higher η was achieved exploiting the dye C217 (η = 9.8%) (ref. 94), which is promising if compared to 11.5% obtained with DSSCs based on ruthenium complexes (e.g., CYC-B11).244

A series of dyes based on triphenylamine (TPA) donors321,322 functionalized with p-dimethylamine (D29) and/or p,o-butoxy groups (D35, D37) have also been synthesized and investigated as sensitizers in DSSCs.323 D35 is a symmetric synthetic organic dye having structural benefits, with respect to e.g., the asymmetric D37 dye (breaking the symmetry of the molecule gives rise to orbital re-arrangements),324 from the large steric bulk introduced by the four butoxy groups.323 After the first DSSCs based on D35 (η = 6.0%),323 this dye have been used in different configurations, e.g., with and without co-adsorbant,325 with different redox mediators both liquid e.g., tetrathiafulvalene (η = 6.5%),326 cobalt complex (η = 6.7%) (ref. 327) and solid e.g., spiro-OMeTAD (η = 4.5%),328 and as co-sensitizer102,329e.g., with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DDP07-D35) (η = 8.6%).329
Other metal-free synthetic organic dyes have also been prepared and more exhaustive details can be found in ref. 214. For example, oligothiophene, coumarine, cyanine, etc., have also been investigated and tested as low cost materials. Table 3 reports PV performances for some representative metal-free synthetic organic dyes when integrated in DSSCs.
Despite the benefits listed above, the degradation in photo-stability (stability towards the photochemical change due to light effects) of the synthetic organic dyes limits their potential applications in DSSCs. Progress has been made in the past few years to increase the photo-stability and recently, Joly et al.330 have demonstrated how the combination of RK1 dye with an ionic liquid electrolyte allows the fabrication of a highly stable DSSC with no measurable degradation of the initial performances (η = 7.36%) after 2200 h of light soaking at 65 °C under 1 sun.
5. Vegetable dyes
Driven by the need for new “environmentally friendly” materials, vegetable dyes336 such as betalains,41,49,337 carotenoids,338 anthocyanins39,339–343 and chlorophylls38,344–347 have been proposed as sensitizers in DSSCs. Vegetable dyes are available in large quantity, easily and safely extracted from fruits, flowers, leaves, low in cost and non-toxic. All these factors make the use of these natural products an intriguing challenge in the development of cheap and commercially available DSSCs.
Unlike artificial sensitizers, whose desired energy levels and absorption properties can be tailored by changing the ligands and/or the central metal atom, for vegetable dyes this is a more difficult task simply because their molecular structure is designed by nature. As a consequence, the research activity is mainly devoted towards the selection of the right vegetable source to isolate the sensitizer and finding the best operating conditions (concentration, pH and extraction techniques of the dyes, size of TiO2 nanoparticles, thickness of photoanode film, soaking time, electrolyte composition, etc.).340,348 For DSSC applications, it is possible to follow a bio-inspired strategy that through simple and clean synthesis, produces “on demand” structural modifications for a “quasi-natural biomimetic sensitizer” showing properties similar to those of the natural dyes. In this framework, optimizations in the design of suitable sensitizers have been obtained in the case of flavylium compounds.349
5.1 Anthocyanins
Anthocyanins belong to flavonoid group of phytochemicals (from the Greek phyto = plant), a family of water-soluble chemical compounds that occur naturally in plants.350–352 Anthocyanins are responsible for the different colors of plants, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits.353 Red- and blueberry, black and red raspberry, black currant, cherry, Sicilian blood orange, eggplant and red cabbage are just few examples of the multitude of vegetables that are rich in anthocyanins.354–358 Amongst the large variety of vegetable compounds exhibiting the basic flavylium ion structure, the applications of anthocyanins have increased enormously in the last 20 years, not only due to their colouring and anti-oxidant properties359–363 but also as pollution attractants and phytoprotective agents, protecting plant's DNA from damage caused by sunlight irradiation.353 Currently, more attention has been devoted to anthocyanins due to their potential health benefits.364 Moreover, in the last few years growing attention has been paid towards the exploitation of anthocyanins as multistate–multifunctional systems for information processing at the molecular level,359–361 and for application in optoelectronics, e.g., solar cells.349

5.1.1 Structure, photochemistry and photophysics of anthocyanins. 
Anthocyanins are derived from anthocyanidins or aglycones (see Fig. 8) which have, at least one pendant sugar moiety (glycoside form).365 The core of both anthocyanidins and anthocyanins (or anthocyans) is a 2-phenyl-benzopyrylium chromophore (i.e., flavylium cation), which consists of an aromatic ring (A) bonded to a heterocyclic ring (C) containing an oxygen atom which, in turn is linked by a C–C bond to a third aromatic ring (B) so, it may also be described as a C6–C3–C6 skeleton.365 The extended π conjugation, as well as the presence of positive charge and free –OH groups on the flavylium cation, allows the anthocyanins to absorb light in the visible region leading to a large variety of dye colours.365,366 The difference between anthocyanins of different types is mainly due to: (i) the number of hydroxyl and/or methoxy groups in the molecule, (ii) the nature and number of sugar moiety attached to the phenolic units, (iii) the nature and number of aromatic or aliphatic acids attached to the sugar moiety.364 The most common sugar is glucose, but galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, fructose and other may also be present in the anthocyanins structure.367
 Fig. 8  Basic structures of the flavonoid, the flavilyum cation, anthocyanidin and anthocyanin diglucoside backbones [(*) from ref. 368]. 
Furthermore, the sugar moiety may be acylated by aromatic acids, generally hydrocinnamic acids (coumaric, caffeic, gallic, sinapic and ferulic acids) and sometimes by aliphatic acids (acetic, oxalic, malonic, malic, and succinic acids).369,370 Aromatic and/or aliphatic acylation may occur in the same molecule, forming a polyacylated structure.351,352,371,372 Generally, the acylic moieties are bonded to the C6 carbon atom in the sugar molecule. Anthocyanins occurring in nature typically have hydroxyl substituents at the position 3 (always glycosylated, i.e., a hydroxyl or other functional group is attached to a carbohydrate of another molecule) and at the position 5 (occasionally glycosylated) of the flavylium cation, while the B-ring (or 2-phenyl) has one or more hydroxyl or methoxy substituents373,374 (see Fig. 8).
Natural anthocyanins, in which the 7-hydroxyl group is glycosylated or replaced by a methoxyl group, can also occur but they are quite rare. Anthocyanins mono- and di-glycosylated at positions 3′, 5′ and even 4 are rare as well with respect to the anthocyanins typically having hydroxyl substituents at the position 3 and 5.365,375 Due to this chemical complexity, there is a large variety of anthocyanins in nature350 and more than 20 currently known anthocyanidins or aglycones. Nevertheless, only six anthocyanidins, i.e., cyanidin (Cy), delphinidin (Dp), malvidin (Mv), pelargonidin (Pg), peonidin (Pn) and petunidin (Ptn) are common in higher plants.370,376 Amongst these anthocyanidins, the three glycoside derivate non-methylated i.e., Cy, Dp and Pg, are the most widespread in nature, being present in ∼80% of leaves, ∼70% of fruits and ∼50% of flowers.377
The number of hydroxyl and methoxyl groups determines the intensity (i.e., ε), type (i.e., the absorption wavelength) and stability of anthocyanins' colour.370 Colour stability refers to the capacity of the molecule (dye) to maintain its colour properties.370 Generally, predominance of hydroxyl groups on the aromatic skeleton of anthocyanins gives rise to an intense blue colour while, a red colour is observed when methoxyl groups prevail instead.366,378 Glycosil substituents also influence the colour stability, probably due to a loss of co-planarity of ring B with respect to the rest of the molecule, which causes a decrease in conjugation and stability.379 The colour stability of monoglycosides and diglycosides anthocyanidines remains higher than that of the corresponding aglycones.379 Therefore, both hydroxylation and glycosylation influence the colour properties of the dyes.
Colour stability of cyanidin (i.e., cyanin without sugar moiety) is higher than that of malvidin, but lower than that of malvidin 3-glucoside.366 Additionally, the colour stability of mono and diglycosyl anthocyanidins is dependent on the glycosyl substituent nature and its anchorage on the anthocyanin skeleton. Broennum-Hansen and Flink380 reported that the anthocyanins containing the disaccharide sambubiose (a component of some glycosides),380 are more stable than glucose containing monosaccharidic anthocyanins. A possible explanation could be ascribed to the ability of the sugar moieties to avoid the degradation towards instable intermediates such as phenolic acid and/or aldehyde compounds.381 For the use of anthocyanins as dyes in DSSCs, the aforementioned structural variations are critical in the choice of the natural sensitizer characterized by the most favourable structural and optical properties (e.g., maximum absorption-λmax, ε, colour stability). Thus, the choice is not a simple task, because anthocyanin extracts are strongly affected by pH,382 processing and storage temperature,383 concentration,384 aggregation of dyes,385 solvents,386 light intensity and frequency,387 presence of oxygen,388,389 metallic ions,390,391 enzymes and other substances.392,393
Due to their ionic nature, anthocyanins are involved in a series of pH-dependent equilibria giving rise to different chemical species (red flavylium cation AH+, bluish quinonoidal base Q, colorless hemiketale pseudobase, H, and colourless chalcone Ch), which are unstable in neutral pH media. A change in pH modulates the anthocyanin stability.394 Indeed, anthocyanins are more stable in acid solution (low pH) than in alkaline media (high pH)365 (see Fig. 9). Under high acidity (pH ≤ 2) conditions, the reddish-coloured AH+ species become predominant.395
 Fig. 9  pH-dependent structural changes and colour variation of anthocyanins in aqueous solution. AH+ represents the colored flavylium cation that is predominant at acid pH values. Q and H depict the unstable quinoidal basic and the colorless hemiketal specie, respectively, while Chcis and Chtrans, are the isomeric forms of the calchone Ch, species. 
With increasing pH value, the flavylium cation is involved in two parallel reactions: (i) de-protonation to form the quinonoidal base Q, predominant at pH values between 2 and 4, and (ii) hydration by nucleophilic attack of water,396,397 at the charge defective C2 and/or C4 positions, followed by proton loss.396,397 The latter produces a reduction of the AH+ concentration and the appearance of the hemiketal pseudobase, H.349 Due to the loss of the conjugated double bond between the A- and B-rings, the hemiketal form does not absorb visible light and appears colorless or light yellow.396,397 With increasing pH values (pH = 4–6), the hemiketal forms, due to the opening of the C-ring, the colorless cis-chalcone Chcis, which is then followed by a slow isomerization to the trans-chalcone Chtrans, see Fig. 9. Therefore, from the primary flavylium cation structure, secondary quinonoidal or hemiketal structures are derived. Moreover, hemiketal structures can further tautomerise (i.e., migration of a proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond)396,397 to chalcone species. Tertiary structures, e.g., isopropane that has centred carbon (defined tertiary carbon) attached to three other carbon atoms, can result from molecular associations of primary or secondary forms, either between themselves (self-association)398 or with other molecules (inter-molecular co-pigmentation).399–402
At equilibrium, the system reported in Fig. 9 behaves as a single acid–base equilibrium between the flavylium cation and a conjugate base, ConBas (defined as the sum of the concentrations of the other species: [ConBas] = [Q] + [H] + [Chcis] + [Chtrans]).403 As a consequence, at diverse pH values, which are typically different for fresh and processed vegetables, each anthocyanin will be, most probably, a mixture of the aforementioned forms.
Strong research effort has been done to highlight the effect of pH values,404 glucosidic or acyl patterns,405 as well as the solvent effect,405 on the spectral and colour features (λmax, ε) of anthocyanin dyes. Fossen et al.404 investigated the colour variation of cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc), see Fig. 10, as representative of typical anthocyanins, over a wide pH range and for a long timeframe. A spectral band shift to longer wavelengths (bathochromic or red shift effect406) with pH increase (i.e., from 1.0 up to 8.1) and, a decreasing colour intensity (in the 1.0–5.0 pH range with a maximum intensity at pH = 1.0) was observed.404 Furthermore, at pH values from 1.0 up to 3.1, where anthocyanin occurs mainly in the flavylium cationic form, the colour was stable for ∼60 days.404 Above pH = 3.1, the colour stability decrease with degradation at pH ≈ 6.0–7.0,404 due to the oxidation of the Chtrans.

Giusti and co-workers405 compared the optical properties of glycosylate acylated and non-acylated Pg derivatives. ε of non-acylated and acylated Pg derivatives ranged from 1.56 × 104 M−1 cm−1 up to 3.96 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively.405 Furthermore, depending on the structure of the acylation agent bathochromic shifts of the λmax were observed.405,406 The structure of sugar substitution was responsible for hypsochromic shifts (blue-shift of the spectral band position of a molecule).406 The nature of the solvent is also responsible for bathochromic or hypsochromic shift in the absorption bands of anthocyanins and, more interestingly, their capability to disperse dyes depends on the dye chemical structure itself. Non-acylated dyes have shown changes in both ε and color (λmax).405,407 Torskangerpoll and Andersen407 studied the influence of aromatic acyl structures on anthocyanins colour and stability at pH values ranging from 1.1 up to 10.5, for a timeframe of 98 days. Their experimental results confirmed that aromatic acyl groups influence the colour and improve stability of anthocyanins in the explored pH range (1.1–10.5).407
Dyrby et al.408 investigated acylated anthocyanins from red cabbage that have shown low sensitivity to photo-degradation in the 3–7 pH range and thermal stability, with respect to other non-acylated anthocyanins obtained from red grape,409 black currant410 and elderberry.411 These properties were attributed to the complex nature of red cabbage anthocyanins, most of them being di-acylate containing aromatic acids.408 In the past years, many of the aforementioned vegetables and many others were identified as potential natural source of stable anthocyanins.412 Acylating substituents (see Fig. 10(c)) stabilize the anthocyanins structure as a consequence of a lower susceptibility of water nucleophile attack and subsequent formation of a pseudobase or a chalcone (intra-molecular co-pigmentation), with respect to non-acylated counterpart.401,402,413,414
Molecular co-pigmentation between anthocyanin and other compounds (co-pigments) is an important stabilizing mechanism of chromophores.400–403,415 Generally, co-pigments are rich π-electrons systems able to associate with the electron-poor flavylium ion. Polyphenols such as rutin, quercetin, chlorogenic acid, tannic acid, flavan-3-ol, lignans, stilbenes and many other unknown flavones can act as co-pigments.415 Other molecules such as organic acids,400–402,415 alkaloid,399 acyl groups,416 metallic ions417 and anthocyanins themselves (self-association),398,399 have also been identified as co-pigments. In the self-association398,399 an aggregation between two anthocyanins, one is the chromophore while the other is the co-pigment, takes place.
Co-pigmentation reaction can occurs through inter- and/or the intra-molecular interactions. In inter-molecular co-pigmentation, the most prominent in almost all the anthocyanin compounds,350,351,401 a π–π interaction takes place through a vertical stacking between the planar structure of anthocyanin chromophores and the co-pigment molecules having delocalized π-electrons.350,351,401 The result is an overlapping arrangement of molecular orbitals (see Fig. 11), which provides protection to nucleophilic attack of water at position 2 of the pyrylium nucleus, leading to colorless hemiketal and chalcone forms (Fig. 11).350,351,401 Intra-molecular co-pigmentation acts in a similar way to inter-molecular one, with the advantage that co-pigment and anthocyanin are covalently linked by linkers or spacers, in a more effective way.350,351,401
 Fig. 11  Structure of anthocyanin complexation through (a) inter- and (b) intra-molecular interactions. 
At given pH values, anthocyanin-copigments have a more intense color (hyperchromic effect, i.e., increase in absorbance) and a higher λmax, in the visible spectrum with respect to free (not self-associated) anthocyanins.418,419 In fact, due to the pH sensitivity of anthocyanins, the co-pigmentation through complexes formation determines a colour change in mild acidic solutions (pH = 3–4) where, colourless hemiketal and chalcone forms (see Fig. 9) may be changed into coloured flavylium or quinonoidal species.47 On the contrary, in strong acidic solutions, anthocyanins are already in the colored flavylium form, therefore in this condition the co-pigmentation is a simple molecular association accompanied by small hypochromic (i.e. decrease in absorbance) and bathochromic shifts of the absorption, which do not cause significant colour change.420 As an example, Gris et al.,421 reported that co-pigmentation with caffeic acid of anthocyanins from grape extracts determines both a bathochromic and hyperchromic shift, in the absorption spectra with respect to bare anthocyanins, being the quantitative effect dependent on the co-pigment content.370
The appearance of intense blue/red colouration in anthocyanins have also been attributed to a metal-complexation reaction between anthocyanins themselves and small metal ions422–425 with the formation of very stable compounds. This fact is crucial, for example, for the complexation of titanium ions located at the TiO2 surface. However, this complexation only occurs if anthocyanins possess a catechol group (C6H10(OH)2) in their B-ring (e.g., as in the case of Cy, Dp, Ptn).47 This could be explained by the fact that catechol has a particular affinity for metal ions in high oxidation states.426 In this context, it has been shown that the chelation (binding of molecules or ions to a metal ion) of Ti(IV) ion by catechol, involves the replacement of a surface hydroxyl group by deprotonated ligand in a mononuclear bidentate geometry, which binds strongly the cathecol to the TiO2 surface427,428 (see Scheme 1). In this configuration, an enhancement of the interfacial electron transfer rates, between cathecol and titanium(IV) ions was observed.427 Starting from the knowledge on well-known coordination titanium complexes, the binding mode and the surface stoichiometry of the adsorbed species on TiO2 have been established.429 Scheme 1  Schematic description of the complexation reaction between the hydroxylated TiO2 surface and the catechol ligand (adapted from ref. 427). 


5.1.2 Anthocyanins as photosensitizers. 
The potential of anthocyanins as sensitizers in DSSCs was firstly proposed by Tennakone et al.42,430 In these first attempts, the authors used cyanidin, extracted from anthurium flower, as dye in a DSSC generating a JSC of ∼2.9 mA cm−2 and an VOC ∼ 435 mV, but with a sudden decay of the photocurrent owing to the degradation of the dye. Although the first results42,430 indicated that cyanidin-type dyes were not “appropriate” sensitizers for DSSCs, these initial works were fundamental in demonstrating that cyanidin strongly adsorb on the TiO2 as a result of a highly stable Ti4+–cyanidin complex.42,430 More importantly, cyanidin has been a model system opening the anthocyanins-based solar cells research field. Afterward, the existence of ultra-fast charge injection processes involving blackberry anthocyanins (a mixture of cyanin 3-glycoside and cyanin 3-rutinoside) has been demonstrated by the Grätzel group.43,47 Exploiting femtosecond laser spectroscopy, Cherepy et al.,47 observed a transient absorption signal with a rise-time less than 100 femtoseconds due to electrons injected from the dye (blackberry) into the semiconductor. This ultra-fast charge injection process was attributed to a strong electronic coupling, via charge-transfer interaction, between the cathecol moiety of the blackberry cyanin and the Ti(IV) sites onto TiO2 surface.47 Despite cyanin injects electrons to TiO2 very efficiently (Φin = 0.98),47 the IPCE and η values achieved by the cell were quite low (19% and 0.56%, respectively).47 These low IPCE and η values may be attributed to dye aggregation on the TiO2 nanoparticles that hinder electrons injection by the dyes, as well as to electron recombination and recapture process by oxidized sensitizer and electrolyte mediator, respectively.47 However, beyond the pivotal works of Tennakone et al.,42 and Cherepy et al.,47 it is worth to emphasize that, different natural dye extracts promote light harvesting at different wavelengths, due to different Φinj. These differences lead to diverse IPCE values obtained by the dyes. The search for effective dye source has led to the discovery of many natural extracts to be used in DSSCs43,45,46,337,431,432 (see Table 4). Dai and Rabani44–46 designed a DSSC with TiO2 sensitized by seed coats of pomegranate (a rich source of anthocyanins) in acid aqueous solution, achieving high quantum yields (Φ = 0.74) in combination with photovoltages of ∼0.46 V. Stability tests of these dyes have shown no decrement of the photocurrent after 24 h illumination at 1 sun.44 The Φ was found to be strongly dependent on the pH condition with an increase from 0.03 up to 0.74 when pH decreases from 5.5 to 1.0.44 Dai and Rabani also investigated the influence of the counter ion (e.g., Na+) and the electrolyte, as well as the presence of glucosidic moiety and the TiO2 nanoparticles diameter (i.e., 5 and 18 nm) on DSSC performances.44–46 The best results (VOC = 0.47 V, JSC = 2.2 mA cm−2) were obtained by using 5 nm TiO2 nanoparticles, together with high iodide concentration (2.5 M), a moderate amount of iodine (0.05 M) and Na+ as the counter ion in aqueous ambient at pH = 1.44–46 The TiO2 nanoparticles diameter was found to affect considerably the photocurrent which decreases (from 0.28 to 0.13) with increasing nanoparticles sizes (from 5 nm to 18 nm).44 It is worth noting that this behaviour is opposite to that of the ruthenium complexes where the Φ appeared to increase from 0.5 to 0.75 with TiO2 nanoparticles diameters of 5 nm and 18 nm, respectively.46 A more systematic study was carried out by Zhang et al.,337 investigating the photosensitizing properties of more than 20 different natural dyes (such as vegetables, bacteria and insects) in DSSCs. Amongst these different natural dyes, the best performances were achieved with the red cabbage extract (in the presence of citric acid and glutinous starch syrup to avoid dye-aggregation) (η = 1.51%) and purple sweet potatoes (η = 1.1).337 In the same work, the authors337 determined the low injection of electrons from the vegetable dye to the semiconductor CB of ZnO with respect to TiO2. This effect is related to the fact that Zn(II), in contrast to TiO2, have not free “d” orbitals, so the coupling between the LUMO of dye and the “s” orbital of the metal gives rise to a poor overlap.433 Hao et al.434 investigated the structure and properties of different family of vegetable dye extracts (anthocyanins, chlorophylls and carotenoids). They determined that anthocyanins, thanks to their hydroxyl and/or carbonyl groups, anchor strongly with TiO2 nanoparticles, thus facilitating the electron transfer from the excited state of the dye to the semiconductor CB, with respect to chorophylls and carotenoids.434 Polo and Iha48 studied vegetable DSSCs with extracts from Jaboticaba and Calafate fruits, obtaining η of 1.15 and 0.29 for dyes extracted in ethanol and water, respectively. The difference in η relies on the higher solvation effect of ethanol with the dye molecules with respect to water.48 Kumara et al.432 using a mixture containing both purified shisonin and chlorophyll components obtained η = 1.31%. The obtained η is higher than that achieved exploiting individually shisonin and chlorophyll as sensitizer.432 However, the synergistic effect of mixture of natural dyes is not universal and it is strongly dependent on the nature of the dyes and the charge transfer between the dye molecules of the mixture and the TiO2 surface. Indeed, Wongcharee et al.343 assembled DSSCs by using vegetable dyes extract from rosella, blue pea flowers and a mixture of them. In this case, the dye composed by the rosella and blue pea flowers mixture has shown η = 0.15%, which is higher with respect to the one achieved by blue pea extract (η = 0.05%), but lower if compared with rosella extract (η = 0.37%).343 In this case, the authors reported a better charge transfer between the dye and the TiO2 when they used rosella extract alone instead of the mixture with blue pea.343 Furthermore, by analyzing the influence of solvent, temperature and pH on the η and stability of the cell, it was also found that an improvement from η = 0.37% to η = 0.70% can be achieved if the aqueous rosella extract dye is treated at T = 50 °C and pH = 1.343 A thermo-gravimetric and spectroscopic analysis on TiO2 films functionalized with cyanidin from black mulberry through sol–gel method,435 revealed that when linked to TiO2 surface, cyanidins are stable for temperatures up to 400 °C. The study revealed interactions TiO2/dye occurring during the hydrolysis and condensation paths, rather than after the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles.435 Following this procedure, a material with a larger amount of adsorbed dye molecules in relation to the number of titanium atoms was obtained, leading in turn to a possible higher η of the cell.435 Fernando and Senadeera436 sensitizing TiO2 with different vegetable dyes containing anthocyanin, realized DSSCs whose η and FF ranged from 0.3% to 1.1% and 54% to 64%, respectively, with IPCE value of 76% for Bush sorrel (hibiscus surattensis). One years later, Luo and co-workers342 utilized Cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), scarlet sage (Salvia splendens), saka siri (Canna indica L.), and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), to sensitize nanocrystalline TiO2. The η of DSSCs based on these dyes were rather poor, ranging from η = 0.13% for Cowberry to η = 0.31% for black nightshade, respectively.342 A possible explanation for these low η could be correlated to the use of basic components, like tert-butyl pyridine (TBP), to the pH sensitive anthocyanins, which determine consequently a change from the stable flavilyum form to the less stable quinonodial form.342 Other effects on dye properties, due to TBP addition, are the red-shift of the absorption spectrum,342 as well as a decrease of the ε and a partial desorption of the dyes from the TiO2.41 Zhou et al.,437 analysing the photo-electrochemical behaviour of DSSCs sensitized with twenty different vegetable extracts (containing cyanine, carotene, chlorophyll, etc.), reported the best η = 1.17% for DSSC sensitized by mangosteen pericarp extract. Mangosteen pericarps are rich in anthocyanins, with cyanidin-3-sophoroside and cyanidin-3-glucoside being the most abundant.438η in the range 1.73–1.86% for DSSCs sensitized with Begonia dye extracted from a plant endemic from eastern Hymalayas, have been reported by Singh et al.439

Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, carried out on anthocyanins sensitized-TiO2 films in ethanol solution, revealed that the kinetic competition between electron/oxidized dye recombination and oxidized dye regeneration pathways is much more critical with respect to the one in Ru(II) sensitizers.292 Indeed, in the case of anthocyanin, electrons accumulate in the TiO2 nanoparticles thus favouring electron–hole recombination.292 Thus, in order to avoid this recombination effect, the use of a kinetically fast redox couple, such as I3−/I−, is an essential requirement.292 Calogero et al. measured by absorption transient spectroscopy that the dye regeneration was recovered within 650 ns,292 which is longer if compared to the 200 ns required for the regeneration of the ruthenium N3-dye. The sensitizing effects of red Sicilian orange, blackberry and eggplant on TiO2 films were also recently investigated.39 It was demonstrated that the nature and the extraction procedure of the dyes and their aggregation inhibition and the optimization of the photo-anode (adjustment of pH value, use of co-absorber agents), are key to improve η.39 DSSCs based on concentrated red Sicilian orange extract sensitizers have shown an increase of η from 0.78 up to 1.01% with respect to the ones based on acidified (H+) orange juice sensitizers (pH < 2).39 A DSSC based on blackberry dye has shown η = 1.07%, and IPCE = 46%,39 the latter being close to the theoretical value of 69% obtained by Cherepy et al.47

Table 4 summarizes the main results obtained so far with anthocyanin based-DSSCs. The highest η of ∼2.9% was recently achieved with the red cabbage extract by Li et al.440

5.2 Betalains
Betalains represent another class of water soluble vegetable-dyes of great interest for their potentiality as light absorbers in DSSC technology.41,447 The colour of flowering plants belonging to Caryophyllales and some Basidiomycota plants are determined by the content of betalain dyes.448,449 Generally, these dyes have orange and red colour, mostly depending on prevailing dye content: betacyanin and betaxanthin. For example, prickly pear contains betanin and indicaxanthin and is orange, while the Bonel variety of red beet contains betanin and vulgaxanthin exhibiting an intense red coloration.
For long time betalains were erroneously categorized as flavocyanins (betaxanthins) and nitrogen anthocyanins (betacyanins). It was only in 1968 that Mabry and Dreiding450,451 attributed to both dyes the name “betalains”, i.e., the beet from which betalains were first extracted.450,451

5.2.1 Structure, photochemistry and photophysics. 
The main betalain contained in red beets is the betanin, which is a betanidin 5-O-β-glucoside (Fig. 12) containing a phenolic and a cyclic amine group.49
 Fig. 12  Structural differences between betacyanin (betanidin and betanin) and betaxanthin dyes. The wavelengths of maximum absorption and the ε are also reported. Adapted from ref. 49. 
Structurally, betalains are immonium derivatives of the main chromophore betalamic acid (I). In fact, all betalain molecules have a betalamic acid (I) moiety bearing substituent R-groups extending from the nitrogen atom (II). The nature of these substituent R-groups determines whether or not the molecule belongs to bethacyanins (i.e., betanidin and betanin) or the betaxanthin family.394,452 The glycosidation of one of the substituent pattern at the C1- or C2-position in the benzene ring, differentiate the individual betacyanins (III). Betaxanthins comprise various amino acid or amino-conjugated moieties of betalamic acid. A typical example is the indicaxanthin, a proline-containing betaxanthin (IV), one of the first chemically identified betalains found in the beet root.453 Glucose, glucuronic acid and apiose are the most common sugar monomers for the betalain molecules, while malonic and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaric acids as well as caffeic-, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids represent typical acid substituents.449 Therefore, betacyanins are considered the condensation product between betalamic acid and cyclo-3-(3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine) (cyclo-DOPA) while, the condensation between betalamic acid and amines or amino acids gives rise to betaxanthins.454 The most common betaxanthins are vulgaxanthin I (glutamine-betaxanthin) and indicaxanthin (proline-betaxanthin), found in red beet and in yellow cactus pears, respectively.454
Betalains, contrary to other dyes such as anthocyanins or chlorophylls, have received much less attention for research activity, probably because the red beet has been considered the only edible betalain's source for long time. However, in the last fifteen years the research activity of betalains (e.g., leaf and grain amaranth,455 prickly pear,456 beet root,49 and Bougainvillea457) have seen a rising interest both for their nutritional aspect (antioxidant456 and radical scavenging activity458) and in natural food colorants.459,460 In particular, thanks to their strong absorption in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and their ability to act as electron donor, the betalains have been considered good candidates in the processes of “photon induced electron transfer”. Differently from the large number of anthocyanins (up to 550),351 betalains have a lower number (∼55), including the red-purple betacyanins (λmax ∼ 535 nm), and the yellow-orange betaxanthins (λmax ∼ 460–480 nm).461 The bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum of betacyanins with respect to betaxanthins is attributed to the presence of the cyclo-Dopa aromatic structure in the betacyanins.462 Furthermore, in the betacyanins, the aglycone betanidin shows a slightly red-shifted absorption spectrum with respect to betanin.
Betalains have high ε (e.g. ε = 6.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for betalamic acid and betanin)49 and pH dependent redox properties.49 Moreover, betalains exhibit a tinctorial strength (or colour strength, i.e. the ability of a dye to maintain its colour upon mixing with another dye) up to three times higher than anthocyanins.461 In addition, betalains possess the carboxyl functional groups (–COOH) that is a key requisite to bind to the TiO2 nanostructure via the formation of ester-type linkage.452,463 In particular, the betalamic acid possess two –COOH groups, while its derivatives (betanidin, betanin, indicaxanthin) have a further carboxyl group attached to the heterocycle through a sp3 atom.464 Upon adsorption of the dye onto the TiO2 surface, the proton of the carboxyl group is transferred to the oxide (e.g., TiO2).464 Contrary, for anthocyanins the adsorption onto TiO2 requires the presence of two ortho-hydroxyl-groups that, if from one hand leads to strong electronic coupling and a rapid electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2, on the other hand assists also the back electron transfer (i.e., recombination process). Nevertheless, a characterization and clarification of the electron injection mechanism from betalains to TiO2, contrary to the case of anthocyanins and chlorophylls,283,465,466 is missing and the current understanding is mainly correlated to the analysis of the IPCE experiments.39,41,49
Betalains, in general, show pH stability in the 3–7 pH range467,468 which, makes them particularly suitable for uses in low-acidity ambient as well as in pH neutral conditions.467 Moreover, betalains are less susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage (the cleavage of chemical bonds by water addition), see Fig. 13, if compared with anthocyanins.452 In this context, betalains can be an alternative to the less water soluble anthocyanins which under the same pH conditions lose their photochemical properties due to changes of their colours.469 Despite their pH stability, at least in the 3–7 pH range,467 the betalains are sensitive to temperature changes. In fact, in the combination of high temperature (50–75 °C) and acidic condition (pH < 6) deglycosylation, as well as hydrolytic cleavage of the aldmide bond of betalanins and decarboxylation occur,470 see Fig. 13. A strategy to protect the aldmine bond from cleavage consists in the acylation of betalains with aromatic or aliphatic acid.471
 Fig. 13  Thermal degradation pathways of betanin (as an example) and their corresponding chromatic changes. Dehydrogenation of betanin at C15 leads to yellow coulored neobetanin while, decarboxylation at C17 causes the appearance of a orange-red colored decarboxybetanin. Deglycosylation of betanin produces its complete transformation in betanidin. This process is enzymatically catalyzed by treatment of the purified betanin with β-glucosidase in heat/acid environment. By thermal treatment in alkaline ambient, cleavage of betanin can also occurs (adapted from ref. 468 and 476.) 
Another critical parameter of betalains, when used as sensitizer in DSSCs, is their redox potential value and the phenomena/parameters affecting it. In fact, thermodynamically favorable electron injection from the dye to semiconductor requires that the excited state redox potential energy of the dye must be more negative with respect to the one of semiconductor (TiO2) CB.4,172 Since 1985, the redox chemistry of betalains has been investigated,472 with redox potential values ranging from 0.45 to 0.67 V (vs. NHE). It was found that betanidin can be oxidized more “easily” than betanin. In fact, the redox potential (at pH = 6) of the betanidin is slightly lower (0.32 V) than that of the betanin (0.67 V),49 identifying in the enediol group (alkenes with hydroxyl group on both sides of the double bond) the oxidation site for the aglycone.472 In 2002, cyclic voltammetry measurements by Butera et al.456 reported for betanin three anodic waves (oxidation) at 0.62, 0.84 and 1.22 V (vs. NHE). Further, by the similarity of the redox potentials of betanin and indicaxanthin (0.83 and 1.12 V, respectively), the authors assumed that the first oxidation of betanin occurs at the aromatic ring.456
More recently, Quin and Clark473 published a theoretical study using the density functional theory (DFT) in order to calculate the ground- and excited-state oxidation potentials of betalains. From their results, oxidation potential values of 1.0 and −1.3 V (vs. NHE) were obtained for the ground- and excited-state, respectively.473 This last value identifies energy level higher than the TiO2–CB (−0.5 V vs. NHE),190 ensuring the driving force for the photo-induced electron transfer, as well as an easy reduction of the oxidized betanin (regeneration) by the I− mediator in the DSSC.478 Moreover, DFT and TDFT (time-dependent density fluctuation theory) analysis have shown that during the HOMO → LUMO transition, see Fig. 14, the benzene ring, where the HOMO is mainly localized, loses electron density while the dihydropyridine (DHP) ring gains charge, indicating a partial excited state electron transfer π–π* transition.473 Since the DHP unit is assumed to be attached at the TiO2 surface via carboxylic groups, the excited state has to be electronically coupled with the acceptor states of TiO2 leading to an effective charge injection.473

5.2.2 Betalains as photosensitizers. 
Concerning DSSC applications, the research, on vegetable sensitizers, has been mainly focused on anthocyanin40,43,45,47 and chlorophyll,38,344–347 while fewer reports have been published on betalains.41,49,50,447
Betalains, in particular red beet extract, were first used as photosensitizer in DSSCs in 2002,337 achieving η = 0.44% and η = 0.014% for TiO2- and ZnO-based DSSC, respectively. The lower η of ZnO-based DSSC was attributed to the low Φinj from the excited dye to the CB of ZnO and/or to a higher recombination process (between the injected electron and oxidized dye) with respect to TiO2-based DSSC.337 By considering the strong betalains-TiO2 surfaces linkage (through –COOH groups), the π*-orbital of the –COOH determines a faster electron injection into the CB of TiO2, than that into ZnO due to the different symmetry.474 In fact, the TiO2 CB comprises mainly unfilled d-orbitals, while ZnO possesses predominantly s-orbital.474 Thus, the overlap of the extended π*-orbital of betalains is more efficient with the titanium 3d-orbital than with the s-orbital of the ZnO.475 In 2008, McHale and co-workers49 published a second report on betalain-derived sensitizers extracted from red beet roots, i.e., betanin, betanidin, betaxanthin and melanin. Amongst the investigated dyes, betaxanthin-based DSSC has shown the best η (0.19%), while betanin and melanin have lower η (η = 0.07% and η = 0.05%, respectively). In the same work a η = 0.67% was achieved for DSSCs sensitized with betanin.49 The difference in η between these different extracts from red beet roots can be explained by taking into account the different molecular structures of the aforementioned molecules.49 Indeed, betanin molecule is larger than the betaxanthin due to the presence of both cyclo-DOPA and glucosidic group which, imply a larger steric hindrance between different betanin molecules (once they are deposited on a surface, e.g., TiO2 nanoparticles) if compared with betanin ones. As a consequence, a lower number of betanin molecules can be absorbed on the semiconductor molecules (e.g., TiO2).460 Acid pre-treatment of photoanode permits higher dye loading (on TiO2) which decrease the recombination effect at the TiO2 surface.49
Vegetable dye extracted from red turnip (Detroit variety) and Sicilian prickly pear are other sources of betalains.41η ranging from 1% to 1.75% were achieved with red turnip extracts.41 Absorption spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of the same betanin in both red turnip and prickly pear but, different betaxanthin compounds.41 Indeed, the red turnip extract contains vulgaxanthin I (which has maximum absorption at 476–478 nm).467 This determines a red shift of the absorption spectrum of the red turnip with respect to the one of the prickly pear, which contains indicaxanthin, absorbing at ∼465 nm, see Fig. 15. DSSCs fabricated with Sicilian prickly pear have shown lower η = 1.26 if compared with red turnip (η = 1.7%).41 The difference in absorption properties of these two dyes, due to different betaxanthin compounds content in the extracts (higher in the red turnip),41 could not be the only key parameter determining the difference in η of these two dyes. Further investigations on Sicilian prickly pear-based DSSC were recently carried out39 with the aim of understanding the fundamental limitations of this vegetable dye and the parameters (such as thickness of TiO2 layer, purification procedures and amount of adsorbed dyes on TiO2, etc.) that can be tuned to achieve the best conditions to obtain higher η with respect to the ones achieved in the first studies.41 In this context, Calogero et al.39 attempted to increase the η of Sicilian prickly pear-based DSSC making use of an optimized TiO2 multilayer (thickness of 13 μm) photo-anode structure in order to reduce the dark current and the recombination process. Thanks to this photoanode architecture a η = 2.06% was achieved.39 The use of purified betanin from beet root as sensitizer in a TiO2-based DSSC, permitted to achieve η of 2.7%,50 which is amongst the highest η reported for vegetable dye-sensitized DSSCs. The purification procedure removes the betalamic acid that, although responsible for the strong anchoring of betalains to the TiO2, hinders electron injection from the dye to the semiconductor (e.g., TiO2).50
 Fig. 15  Absorption spectra of betanin sensitized TiO2 film compared to indicaxanthin, raw beet extract and purified betanin. 
Therefore, as reported by Mc Hale and co-workers,49 the purification of betalains by removing betalamic acid and other impurities improves their performances as dyes.

5.3 Chlorophylls
Chlorophyll is a green coloured dye of leaves and green stems of plants, responsible for the absorption of energy from light during the photosynthesis process476 where, the light absorbed by chlorophyll transforms carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen (CO2 + H2O → (CH2O) + O2).477

5.3.1 Structure, photochemistry and photophysics. 
Structurally, chlorophyll refers to a class of cyclic tetrapyrrole,283,284 similarly to porphyrin and phtalocyanines discussed in Section 4.2. Caventou and Pelletier478 in 1817, identified chlorophyll as a chlorin ring having a magnesium ion at the centre. Unlike porphyrins (see Section 4.2), chlorophylls have a reduced pyrrole ring and a phytol group, a highly hydrophobic 20-carbon atoms alcohol esterified to an acid side chain. Bacterio(chlorophylls) are similar to chlorophylls, except for the reduction of an additional pyrrole ring that determines a shift (with respect to chlorophylls) of their absorption maxima to wavelengths around 1000 nm (NIR).479
The basic structures of the aforementioned compounds are depicted in Fig. 16. Although, after Caventou and Pelletier,478 many new chlorophyll structures were identified and isolated, such as Chl-d,480 and Chl-f,481,482 essentially Chl-a (C55H72O5N4Mg, cyan), Chl-b (C55H70O6N4Mg, chartreuse) and Chl-c (C35H28O5N4Mg, blue-green), are actually recognized as the most common chlorophylls. In particular, Chl-a and Chl-b are the two most diffused chlorophylls in plants. Their concentration depends on the insolation, i.e., the total amount of solar energy received per unit surface area (MJ m−2), of the plants. The main difference in the structure of Chl-a and Chl-b relies in the composition of a single side chain of the cyclic tetrapyrrole (see Fig. 16), which is a –CH3 in Chl-a (blue-green) and a –CHO in Chl-b (yellow-green). Chl-a and Chl-b have a highly stable polycyclic network of alternating single and double bonds (polyenes) conjugated structure which, allows the orbitals delocalization, making chlorophylls ideal photosensitizers.483
 Fig. 16  Basic structures and the oxidation state of natural chlorophylls: Chl-a, Chl-b, Chl-c, Chl-c1 and Chl-c2, Chl-d and Chl-f. 
Chemically, chlorophylls are instable in both acid and basic ambient and have a strong tendency towards aggregation and/or interaction with their molecular environment. Differently from the other tetra-pyrrole derivates such as porphyrins110 and phtalocyanines,287 the production of which needs complicated and expensive synthesis and purification pathways, chlorophylls and their derivates are cheap and environmentally friendly compounds. Coloured and nontoxic derivatives of chlorophylls are utilized as dyes in the cosmetic, textile, and food industries,484,485 as well as components of luminescent materials.486
Beyond the natural abundance and low toxicity, as well as the capability to absorb solar energy in different region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the cyclic tetrapyrrole Chl-type dyes possess some fundamental advantages with respect to several inorganic and organic sensitizers. In fact, the excited states lifetime of chlorophylls can be tuned by changing the central metals (Zn, Mg, Ni, Cu, Pd, Fe, etc.) [for the case of Ni see as an example ref. 487] and consequently, the LUMO orbital of the sensitizers can also be adjusted to match the energy level of the CB edges of semiconductors.
The absorption spectra of chlorophylls consist of two main bands, the Soret-band located in the blu region, deriving from the electronic transition with the strongest oscillator strength (2.88 eV) and the Q-band lying in the red region, consisting of Qx and Qy transitions (see Fig. 7) at 1.87 and 2.14 eV, respectively.488 The positions and intensities of Q-bands can be appropriately adjusted by chemical modification of the macro-cycle.488 Furthermore, chlorophylls display ε up to 105 M−1 cm−1, amongst the highest observed for organic compounds. As an example, Li et al.489 reported for Chl-a and Chl-b ε as high as 7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 with strong absorption bands in the blue and red regions of the visible spectrum (λmax ≈ 430 and 665 nm in Chl-a, and 425 and 655 nm in Chl-b).
The main panel of Fig. 17 compares the absorption spectra of different chlorophyll dyes based on porphyrin, bacteriochlorin and chlorophyll tetrapyrrole structure while, the inset shows the absorption spectra for Chl-b, Chl-d and Chl-f.

5.3.2 Chlorophylls as photosensitizers. 
In the first studies on ZnO wide-bandgap semiconductor photosensitized by chlorophylls, Tributsch and Calvin490,491 reported an extremely low EQE (up to 12.5%). In the following years, chlorophylls as sensitizers for organic PV cells were the subject of a fervent research activity,492–496 and EQE up to 30% were achieved by depositing Chl-a monolayers on SnO2 TC electrodes.339
The first investigations on the photosensitization of TiO2 using chlorophyll derivatives was carried out by Kamat and co-workers.497,498 In 1993, Kay and Grätzel38 published an exhaustive study on colloidal Ti02 electrodes photosensitized with chlorophylls and related derivatives, achieving EQE up to 30%. These low EQE values, may be attributed to the chlorophylls structure, where the presence of alkyl groups rather than carboxyl or hydroxyl groups makes chlorophylls unable to efficiently bind with the nanoporous TiO2 surface.434 Kay and Grätzel38 demonstrated that Chl-a exhibits a poorer adsorption and sensitization on TiO2 when compared with chlorophyll derivatives where phytyl group is replaced by carboxylic one. In addition, long alkene chains give rise to strong steric hindrances which prevent an orderly arrangement of the chlorophyll-dye molecules on the TiO2 molecule surface.499 Because of these effects, only chlorophyll sensitizers bearing carboxylic groups directly conjugated to π-electrons of the chromophore could exhibit an effective electron injection into the TiO2 electrode.283 Wang and Tamiaki283 also remark that, the carboxyl group location on the macrocyclic structure, with respect to its x- or y-axis direction, affects the absorption characteristics and the molecular orbitals of chlorophylls. Based on these considerations, beyond the light-harvesting ability, Chl-c (c1 and c2) possessing a wide electron density at the position of –COOH group appears as the most favourable sensitizer for DSSC applications. The method of isolating Chlc1 and Chlc2 from Chla and carotenoids is a well-known procedure, being developed by Jeffrey in 1972.500
Wang et al.346 investigated two different types of Chl-c (c1 and c2) together with their oxidized forms (c1′ and c2′) isolated from the wakame (undaria pinnatifida) seaweed. The TiO2-based DSSCs fabricated with these sensitizers achieved η values of 3.4% and 4.6% for Chl-c1 and Chl-c2, respectively, and η = 2.5% and η = 2.6% for their oxidized forms (Chl-c1′ and Chl-c2′, respectively).346 From the experimental results of NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) correlations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV-visible and mass spectroscopies, the high η of DSSC using Chl-c2 sensitizer was attributed to several factors.346 First, the extended conjugated system resulting in high electron densities, then the favourable configurations of the peripheral vinyl carboxyl group with respect to other Chl-c and finally the absence of dye aggregation.346 These results set a relationship between molecular structure, local electron density and photosensitizer properties of the different Chl-c types.346 Moreover, the absence of dye aggregation influences the singlet–triplet transition annihilation.213,501,502 The annihilation process limits the lifetime of singlet excitons, which consequently can reduce the η of the DSSC.503 In Fig. 18 are reported the ε (Fig. 18(a)), absorption spectra (Fig. 18(b)) together with the IPCE profile (Fig. 18(c)) and the I–V curve (Fig. 18(d)) of Chl-c1 and Chl-c2.

5.4 Other vegetable dyes
In addition to anthocyanins,40,43,45,47 betalains49 and chlorophylls,38,346 other vegetable dyes (such as carotenoid,504–506 cochineal,507 quercetin,508etc.) have been explored as sensitizers in DSSCs.504–510 In this section we discuss the photo-physical (chemical) properties of such compounds, focusing on the recent efforts made towards the identification of “appropriate” additives for the improvement of cell performance (i.e., η) without causing dye degradation.
Similarly to anthocyanins40,43,45 and betalains,49 the addition of carboxylic acid (e.g., citric, tartaric and acetic acid) determines bathochromic or hyperchromic shifts, as well as the sensitizing activity of other vegetable dyes, such as carotenoid,504,505 cochineal,507 quercetin508 adsorbed on TiO2 surface.39 On the contrary, basic components, such as NaOH or NH3 and their derivatives,34 are known to cause desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface resulting in the collapse of the cell performances. In this framework, Ito and co-workers510 have demonstrated that the treatment of monascus yellow dye (extracted from red yeast rice fermentation) with CH3COOH greatly enhance the η of the solar cell. In their paper, the authors observed that the absorption peak of the monascus yellow-sensitized TiO2 electrodes shifts towards shorter wavelength, greatly increasing its intensity,510 see Fig. 19(a). A similar trend was also observed in the IPCE curve whose maximum value, almost close to zero with no acid treatment, grows up to 47% in the presence of acetic acid,510 see Fig. 19(b). These features justified the hypothesis of a strong interaction between the hydroxyl groups of the dye molecules and the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface, favouring a more effective electron injection on the semiconductor surface.510

In addition, from the weak absorption peak of the TiO2 electrode without acetic acid treatment, the authors510 hypothesized chemical and physical (van der Waals) adsorption pathways depending on the chemical treatment, i.e., with or without acid, respectively. The protons coming from the acetic acid, strengthen the chemical bond between the dye and the TiO2 surface, resulting in the efficient injection of photo-excited electrons from the dye to the TiO2.465,466 After optimizing photo-anode structure and acidity condition, the assembled DSSC has shown a η = 2.3%.510
In 2011, Agarkar511et al. tested nontoxic and biocompatible vegetable dye-sensitizer based on isobutrin dyes extracted from Butea monosperma flower, see Fig. 20. Isobutrin is a yellow dye belonging to the chalcones, a subclass of the flavonoids family.511 Chalcones are aromatic ketones that form the central core of a variety of biological compounds.512
 Fig. 20  Butea monosperma flower and Isobutrin dye extracted with the corresponding molecular structure. The chemical structure of chalcone is also reported for clearness. 
Structurally, chalcones consist of open-chain flavonoids in which two aromatic rings are joined by a three-carbon α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system,513 see Fig. 20. Compounds with chalcone-based structure are known to have anti-inflammatory,514 anti-bacterial515 and anti-tumor activities.516,517 Butea monosperma flower contains several flavonoidal compounds (butein, palastrin, isobutrin, butrin, etc.), the most abundant of which is the isobutrin (tetra-hydroxy-chalcondiglucoside, C27H32O15).511
Agarkar and co-workers obtained η = 1.8% using purified isobutrin as dye in DSSCs.511 Moreover, they observed that the chelation reaction (see Section 5.1) between isobutrin dye and the Ti ions results into a strong dye-TiO2 charge-transfer band in the visible region.511
Carotenoids, organic compounds which are commonly split in two sub-classes, xanthophylls and carotenes, are a further class of naturally occurring dyes suitable to act as sensitizers in DSSC.518 The molecular structure of carotenoids determines their colouration, ranging from light yellow to red. Structurally, carotenoids are made of long polyene chains which can be terminated by rings and, may contain (e.g., xanthophylls) or not (e.g., carotenes) additional oxygen atoms. Carotenoids basic structure can be changed/tuned in different ways, primarily by cyclization of the terminal groups or by the introduction of oxygenated functional groups.518 The possibility to tune the molecular structure of carotenoids resulted in a family of over 600 different compounds.519,520
The most striking properties of carotenoids, such as chemical reactivity and light absorption properties,518 are due to the long central part of the molecule, constituted by alternating single and double bonds.518 These bonds form a conjugated system in which, the π-electrons are delocalized over the entire length of the polyen chain.518Fig. 21(a) shows the basic structure of three naturally occurring carotenoids (lycopene, β,β-carotene and 8′-apo-β-caroten-8′-oic acid – ACOA). Some common end groups found in natural carotenoids are shown in Fig. 21(b).

The light harvesting ability of carotenoids in the photosynthesis of higher plant521 to mediate electron transfer,522,523 as well as their characteristic light absorption in the range of 380–520 nm, makes them potential sensitizers in PV applications and other artificial photochemical devices.524 The photoconduction characteristics of carotenoids and the production of charge carriers by ligth excitation,525–527 as well as their properties of triplet or singlet states quenching through energy transfer,528–530 intramolecular charge-transfer,531 charge separation in synthetic molecular dyads and triads532–534 (covalently coupled chromophoric arrays in a single molecule of high symmetry, see Section 6) and photo-induced electron-transfer to solvent molecules535,536 have been extensively studied. As sensitizers in DSSCs technology, carotenoids appear capable to transfer electrons from the excited states of the sensitizer to the CB of semiconductor.537 An early proof on the carotenoids capability to work as photosensitizers in DSSCs was given in the 2000 s by Gao, Bard and Kispert.338 They designed a cell using a nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrode sensitized with ACOA, demonstrating the possibility to generate stable PV currents upon ligth irradiation. A JSC of 4.6 mA cm−2 (upon a 40 mW cm−2 incident light beam at 426 nm) with an IPCE = 34% and a VOC of 0.15 V were measured.338 An ordered monolayer structure of the TiO2-bound carotenoid was also hypothesized.338
Since then, carotenoids have been used in DSSCs504,538 and η values up to 2.6% were achieved.539 Wang et al., using carotenoids in combination with chlorophyll derivatives, realized DSSCs with η up to 4.2%.540
The influence of the carotenoid chain length, as well the effects of surfactant addition (e.g. with deoxycholic acid, a bile salt surfactant541,542) on the electrons injection efficiency from carotenoid dye to TiO2 surface was also investigated by Wang et al.543 Their TiO2-based DSSC using 100% carotenoic acids (without surfactants), having a number of conjugated double bonds (n) ranging from 5 to 13, have shown the highest η (2.5%) at n = 7 (CA7),543 which seems to be the optimal length for carotenoids in DSSC applications. Furthermore, based on their experimental results, Wang et al.543 assumed a η values dependence by a singlet–triplet annihilation reaction of the dye molecules, as was further stressed in a following report.539 In 2007, Yamazaki et al.504 used crocetin (8,80-diapocarotenedioic acid) and crocin (crocetin-di-gentiobioside) carotenoid, as sensitizers in their TiO2-based DSSCs, in order to investigate the influence about the presence or absence of carboxylic groups on the photo-electrochemical DSSC performance. The measurements revealed a higher ability of crocetin (which contains carboxylic groups) to bind the TiO2 surface, with respect to crocin.504 This is reflected in a higher η = 0.56% of crocetin with respect to crocin (η = 0.16).504 The lower PV performances of crocin was attributed to both the absence of carboxylic groups and the presence of sugar moiety on the molecular skeleton.504 On one hand, the absence of carboxylic groups determines an inefficient linkage dye/semiconductor and thus a low effective charge injection process. On the other hand, the presence of glucoside moieties hinders the absorption of the dye, due to steric hindrance, onto the TiO2 nanoparticles surface.504
Another carotenoid of potential interest as sensitizer for DSSCs is the extract of achiote (or annato) seeds,505 a tropical evergreen shrub (Bixa orellana) native from the tropical areas of the Americas. From the achiote seeds, a dark-red extract is obtained, which is extensively used as dye for food colouring544,545 as well as for textiles,505 varnishes,505 cosmetics,505 tattoos505 and pharmaceutical applications.505 The major component of the pericarp extract (∼80%) is the carotenoid cis-bixin or α-bixin (C25H30O4,) with the remaining ∼20% including trans- and cis-norbixin (C24H28O4), reported in Fig. 22(a) and (b), respectively. cis-bixin is the mono-methyl ester of the water soluble cis-norbixin di-carboxylic acid and, contrarily to the latter, is water insoluble due to the presence of the methyl ester group (–COOCH3) at one end of its molecular chain.
 Fig. 22  Chemical structure of the main dyes in the pericarp of the achiote seeds, (a) cis-bixin and (b) cis-norbixin apocarotenoids. 
Due to the vast conjugated system, the bixin chromophore exhibits strong absorption band above 400 nm (see Fig. 23), due to an electronic-dipole transition oriented along the axis of the molecule. The energy and intensity of the absorption band in the 320–380 nm range (so called cis-peak) depends on the position and number of the cis-bonds.546,547 Despite the characteristic solvent dependence of the absorption spectra in polyene compounds,548 the ε of the bixin cis-peak has been measured to be 1.24 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 1.35 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in benzene and ethanol solution, respectively.547 Moreover, the ε of the band above 400 nm, see Fig. 23, is higher than that of cis-peak, and experimental measurements506 have given ε = 1.9 × 105 M−1 cm−1. This value is higher than that of the N719 (=1.36 × 104 M−1 cm−1).188 The norbixin, in the same spectral range, has shown ε = 1.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, thus quite similar to that of N719 one.506
 Fig. 23  Absorption spectra of cis-bixin, annatto extract and cis-norbixin. Adapted from ref. 505. 
Taking into account that one of the major factor determining the η of the TiO2-based cells is correlated to the maximum ε of the sensitizer, the high ε value of the bixin dye, in the blue and green region of the electromagnetic spectrum, should enable fabrication of cells with very high η. However, when bixin-sensitized was integrate in DSSCs, the obtained η was quite low, i.e., η = 0.53%.505 As reported by Gomez-Ortiz et al.,505 this low η, contrary to the high ε value, of bixin dye could be explained by: (i) relatively short life-time of the excited state due to the symmetrical molecular structure, (ii) weak electronic interaction between the dye (e.g., in the excited state) and semiconductor CB, (iii) dye-multilayer deposition and possible polymerization, leading to a decrease in conjugation and, hence, a lowering of ε in the visible. Moreover, the low absorption in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum, see Fig. 23, is a further disadvantage for the use of these carotenoids in DSSC applications.
With the aim to always investigate new materials able to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, a novel and promising DSSC using a redox couple Fe2+/Fe3+ (ferrocene) in AcN solvent as liquid electrolyte and quercetin, alizarin and luteolin dyes as natural sensitizers, has been recently designed.509 The Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple was chosen for its more favourable redox potential with respect to I3−/I−,549,550 which should result in a larger energy level difference between the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox and TiO2 CB.551 Furthermore, Fe2+/Fe3+ couple does not corrode the electrodes thank to its chemical inertness towards oxygen during manufacturing.509 Quercetin, alizarin and luteolin dyes extracted from Hypericum perforatum, Rubia tinctorium L. and Reseda luteola plants, respectively, were chosen for their broad absorption spectra ranging from 250 to 650 nm. Indeed, quercetin extract has two intense absorption bands in the UV region with maxima at 268 nm and 412 nm (see Fig. 24(a)), while alizarin and luteolin exhibit a broad and strong absorption at around 580 nm (Fig. 24(b)) and 354 nm (Fig. 24(c)), respectively.552,553 The absorption bands around 300 nm and 450 nm can be attributed to the π–π* transition and, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor, respectively.554,555

Quercetin, alizarin and luteolin dyes, when assembled in DSSCs, have shown IPCE values in the wavelength range 580–600 nm of 69%, 63% and 59% (see Fig. 24(d)), respectively. The quercetin dye has also shown the best PV performance with η = 2.17%, higher compared to those of alizarin (η = 1.79%) and luteolin (η = 1.37). The best performances of quercetin-based DSSC are associated to a higher intensity and broader range of light absorption of the dye molecules adsorbed onto TiO2. Moreover, the hydroxyl group on the C3 atom of the quercetin molecule C-ring affects the distribution of the electron density and the molecular dipole moment enhancing the dye performance.112 The donor ability of the hydroxyl group increases the dye dipole moment and increases both its ground (HOMO) and excited state (LUMO) energies, favouring the charge separation. Pina et al.349 also argued that the C3 position has a prominent role regarding the dye colour and absorption properties in the flavinum compounds. The authors have investigated pelargonidin and luteolinidin, having similar structures with the difference of a single –OH group in C3 position of pelargonidin.349 Pelargonidin has shown a significant red shift absorption compared to luteolinidin.349
6. Synthetic analogues of vegetable dyes
As herein reviewed, vegetable dyes are promising for their use as-sensitizers in DSSC technology.38–40,42–44 A plethora of literature exists about the ability of vegetable dyes to tune their optical properties (e.g., colours469 and ε41,405,407) depending on external factors (pH,382,404 temperature,383,470 peripheral groups,307,556,557etc.). In this framework, a bio-inspired strategy has been followed in order to produce, with adequate structural modifications, quasi-natural biomimetic sensitizers having optical properties comparable to those of natural dyes.351,558–562 In ref. 112 quasi-natural biomimetic compounds based on flavylium structure have been proposed, see Fig. 25. The introduction of different electron donor/acceptor groups in the flavylium molecular structure has been analyzed both theoretically and experimentally.112 Diethylamine unit in position 7 of the flavylium core expands the dye π-conjugation increasing the effective electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 CB.112 The diethylamine donor group acts as an electron donor,112 while the catechol and the benzopyran systems constitute the acceptor and the π bridge, respectively, defining a donor–π–acceptor structure (D–π–A).563

Dye-sensitized solar cells based on these novel structures have shown η ranging from 0.63% (ref. 112) up to 2.15%.112 The best PV performance was obtained by a DSSC based on a 7-(N,N-diethylamino)-3′,4′-dihydroxyflavylium (see Fig. 25), achieving η = 2.15% and IPCE = 51%, a value which is (18%) lower with respect to the theoretical limit (IPCE = 69%) predicted by Grätzel and co-worker for natural anthocyanins.47
Further, bio-inspired strategy mimics the light harvesting antenna (LHA) effect developed by different natural photosynthetic systems,564,565 such as the green sulfur bacterial chlorosome,566 the Pcb (prochlorococcus Chl-a2/b binding) protein567 or the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHC-II),568 the purple bacterial light-harvesting complexes 1, 2 and 3 (LH1–LH3)569 and many others. Despite the wide structural differences of LHA, influenced by the different habitats in which the diverse LHA systems exist, their light harvesting mechanism exploits similar principles.570 During this process, light absorption followed by charge separation and efficient energy transfer to a reaction center (RC) are performed by molecular dyes. Natural LHAs are composed by a central molecular core (i.e., RC) associated with an array of peripherical dyes, (antenna, A).565 The role of the antenna is twofold: it collects the solar radiation and, through energy transfer, transfers the excitation energy570 to the RC, where charge separation takes place.570
The energy transfer process can take place via Förster571 or Dexter572 mechanisms which, mainly differ in length scale (i.e., the donor–acceptor distance, RDA). In the Förster model, the energy released from an excited light-sensitive molecule (donor) excites a second chromophor (acceptor) through nonradiative dipole–dipole coupling (coulombic interaction) and efficiencies (i.e., the ratio of acceptor emission intensity to that of the donor)573 sensitive to RDA. Therefore, Förster energy is a short and intermediate range process (10–100 Å) (ref. 571 and 574–577) mainly restricted to a singlet–singlet energy transfer.571 Differently, Dexter mechanism572 is a double electron exchange between the donor and the acceptor, depending strongly on the spatial overlap of their molecular orbitals. Thus, it is a very short range process (<10 Å), decaying exponentially with RDA.572 Furthermore, Dexter mechanism can promote both singlet–singlet and singlet–triplet excited-state energy transfers.572 A useful feature for energy transfer from fluorescent organic antenna to transition metal complex sensitizer.578
The knowledge gained in the field of natural photosynthesis579,580 constitutes a valuable help to overcome the limits (i.e., low ε, weak absorptivity, etc.) of LHE efficiency in the sensitization of wide-bandgap semiconductor for solar cell applications. In fact, in a DSSC the sensitizer is usually the sole light collector, and the cell JSC strongly depends on the fraction of the light absorbed relatively to the whole incident solar flux on the photoanode. Thus, any improvement in the LHE constitutes a viable way in increasing the cell performances (i.e., JSC, VOC, FF, IPCE and η).
The “antenna effect” concept introduced by Balzani and Lehn581 was first used in DSSCs by Scandola and co-workers in 1990 (ref. 582) which, proposed the use of a antenna/sensitizer structure based on trinuclear ruthenium polypyridine complex in order to increase the LHE of sensitized TiO2-semiconductor. Since then, the inspiration of photosyntesis has prompted a considerable interest in the use of organic dyes for solar-energy applications and significant amount of artificial molecular and supramolecular architectures have been constructed and investigated.583–590 In Ru(II)-complexes based DSSCs, the low ε (∼10−4 M−1 cm−1) (ref. 36, 83, 220, 221 and 225) value and the weak absorptivity in the near-IR region, see Section 4.1, remain the main weakness for LHE. Differently, in spite of their narrow absorption wavelength bandwidth, several vegetable dyes show intense π–π* transitions and wide tunability over a large electromagnetic spectral region, making them suitable candidates in the multichromophores sensitizer molecular devices (panchromatic effect).591
A critical factor in the design of a photosynthetic LHA system is the choice of the individual components (sensitizer and antenna) as well as their geometrical arrangement.592 Amongst synthetic organic multi-dye arrays, porphyrinic assemblies have proved their potentiality for DSSCs purpose.304,584,593–596 In these systems, the light absorption by an antenna dye is followed by singlet–singlet excited-state energy transfer process towards the porphyrin nucleo which, in turn injects the excited electrons into anchored TiO2 semiconductor.597 In addition, other dyes such as carotenoids,583 coumarins,598 cyanine,599 xanthenes600 and perylene dyes601,602 that, absorb in spectral regions where porphyrins have low ε values, can be covalently bound to the main porphyrin macrocycle to enhance its LHE. As an example, synthetic covalent perylene-imide/porphyrins dyes have shown high LHE in the spectral blu-green region (i.e., between the porphyrin Soret and Q-bands (450–500 nm)).603–605 A similar idea was exploited by Hupp and Lee606 using in DSSC a bichromophore (dyad) zinc-porphyrin/boron-dipyrrin (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, (Bodipy)) with Bodipy acting as LHA molecule to fill out the blue-green region of the spectrum. As a result of the larger solar spectral coverage, the Zn-porphyrin/Bodipy based cell has shown η = 1.55%, nearly twice compared to that of the Zn-porphyrin based reference cell (η = 0.84%).606
In 2011 Odobel and co-workers591 realized a trichromopheric sensitizer (triad) consisting of covalently linked Bodipy, Zn–Pr and squaraine units.591 The first two chromophoric subunits (Bodipy and Zn–Pr) act as LHA while the squaraine behaves as sensitizer for electron injection into TiO2. In such a way, the assembled supramolecular architecture covered a wide window of the solar spectrum, combining the absorption properties of the individual components (see Fig. 26). Moreover, the triad absorbs in a range of wavelength (e.g., ∼650 nm) not covered both by Ru-based and vegetable dyes, see Fig. 27. The triad (Bodipy/Zn–Pr/Squaraine) based DSSC has shown higher η (3.9%) compared to those of squaraine alone (3%) and Bodipy/Zn–Pr (3.6%).591

7. Scaling-up and costs
The final goal of any PV technology development is the scaling-up of lab cells to the specific size required by target applications. Nowadays PV systems are utilized in different contests: conventional PV plant, space solar power,608,609 building integrated PV (BIPV),610–612 energy harvester for sensors and other information and communication technology devices,613,614etc.
Concerning DSSCs, the “good” response to low illumination conditions615 and diffuse light,616 the reduced angular dependence of the efficiency617 and the capacity to easily tune the colour and transparency of the cells,618 make them well suited for BIPV619,620 and indoor applications.615
The scaling-up from the lab size cells (less than 1 cm2) to large area cells or modules, is usually associated with a reduction of performances (i.e., η).621 This lowering in η is due primarily to the increase of the internal voltage drop caused by sizeable increases in the series resistances. The Rs of TCO (>7 Ohm □−1)65 is not negligible and induces considerable reduction of the FF already for cells larger than 1 cm2. Such issue is common to all PV technologies and several module architecture have been developed to mitigate this scaling problem.622–625 Being electrochemical devices, however, specific problems arises for scaling up DSSCs, such as the management of the liquid electrolyte. For DSSC mainly four module architecture have been proposed, one for parallel connection and three for series connection of the cells (W-type, Z-type and monolithic),622 see Fig. 28.
 Fig. 28  Connection schemes of DSSCs in a module. 
In parallel connection, similarly to crystalline (c-Si) PV technology, metal fingers are used to collect the generated current. However, metal finger corrosion can be induced by the electrolyte.626 For this reason, special encapsulation strategies for metal grids have been developed for DSSC.627–631 In Z-type series connected DSSC module the anode of the cell is connected to the cathode of the adjacent cell through a vertical metal contact.623–625 Also in this case, vertical metal contact should be properly sealed to prevent the corrosive action of the electrolyte. This corrosive effect of the electrolyte is mitigated in the “metal-free” W and monolithic architectures. W connection exploits the bi-facial property of DSSC that is the ability to operate with front or rear illumination. In this architecture one cell (front illuminated cell) is connected to the adjacent cell, which is oriented in the opposite direction (back illuminated cell), thus eliminating the metal vertical connection of the Z-scheme. Such kind of architecture suffers of cell unbalance being the front illuminated cell typically more efficient than the back illuminated one.632,633 For this reason, a careful design of the module should be consider.634–637 Finally, in the monolithic architecture the printed back contact is also used for interconnecting adjacent cells.638,639 Usually, carbon materials such as carbon black,640,641 graphite,642 graphite/carbon black643,644 and graphene sheet/carbon645 are used for the back contact even though other opaque or transparent materials can be used, also adopting vacuum-based deposition techniques (thermal evaporation, sputtering etc.).639
The scaling up concepts presented above have been widely applied in DSSC sensitized with Ru-based dyes and industrialization activities are well advanced. G24 Power is commercialising flexible DSSC modules while companies like Toyota-Aisin, TDK, Fujikura, Sony, DongJing-Semichem, Dyepower and others are in the pre-industrialization phase.622 Moreover, quite recently there have been several announcements about IEC61646 endurance tests cleared by some Ru- and synthetic organic-based DSSC cells and modules.646–648 This demonstrate the maturity of the DSSC technology also with respect to the severe stress test presented in the IEC norm originally developed for conventional thin-film PV technology.
While Ru- and synthetic organic-dyes DSSC modules are well developed and first commercial applications have been launched on the market, limited example of DSSC modules sensitized with vegetable dyes have appeared. Fig. 29 shows some example of modules sensitized with both vegetable dyes and N719. Efficiency of the modules based on vegetable sensitizer is ∼1% while the N719 one is ∼5%.
 Fig. 29  Ru- and vegetable-based dye DSSC modules realized at the Centre for Hybrid and Organic Solar Energy (CHOSE) in collaboration with CNR-IPCF. 
The main reason for this scarce interest for scaling up of DSSC made with vegetable dye is mainly due to the low η shown, up to now, by these dyes (see Tables 4 and 5). However, the low cost of vegetable dyes may compensate, in view of performance/price ratio, their lower η with respect to Ru-based DSSC. To better define this issue it is necessary to quantify the price of the cell per peak output power (Wp).
It is widely recognized that the performance/price ratio will play a pivotal role in future choice of various PV devices. Concerning the DSSC technology, there are four major material costs, namely the mesoporous TiO2, dye, electrolyte and, with less extend, the catalysts. Moreover, similarly to thin-film PV technologies, the cost of TCO is not negligible with respect to the other components and should be considered as the ultimate cost of the module when all the other material costs are scaled in large productions.254
For DSSC productions of the order of few MWp/year it has been estimated that 15–20% of the total module cost is related to the dye while the cost of TiO2 impacts for ∼11–14%.649–651 This shows that the photoanode (considering also the TCO) is already covering half of the cost of DSSC modules. However, cost estimation strongly depends on the dye used for sensitizing the mesoporous TiO2. In particular ε will dictate the quantity of dye needed for sensitization as well as the thickness of TiO2. The relation between cost of a DSSC photoanode and the properties of materials used to fabricate it can be derived by considering the Lambert–Beer expression of the absorbance (A) A = ε·c·d(15)where c (mol cm−3) is the concentration of dye in the TiO2 layer and d (cm) the TiO2 layer thickness. Eqn (15) can also be written in terms of dye-uptake Γ = cdA = ε·Γ
A well-designed photoanode should have and absorbance A > 1 in order to absorb (in the range of the dye absorption spectrum) the major part of the electromagnetic radiation impinging on the cell.
By using the equation of Calogero et al.39 we can derive the cost per Watt-peak, PDyetot (€ per Wp) of the dye: (16)where MDye (g mol−1) is the molecular mass of the dye, PDyemass (€ per g) the price per mass of the dye, and IAM1.5 (W m−2) the light power density.

Eqn (16) defines the cost of the dye. However, when a different dye is used, ε varies and consequently a different thickness of TiO2 is needed to achieve the same absorbance. This will impact on the total cost of the cell, being the TiO2 cost not negligible.
By using an approach similar to that described above for the dye, we can express the cost of the TiO2 per Wp as: (17)where  (typically R = 0.1–0.15),  the price per mass of TiO2 paste and ρTiO2 (g cm−3) is the density of TiO2 paste.
The total cost of the photoanode PPhAtot (€ per Wp) (excluding the cost of the glass) is: (18)Beside TiO2 and dyes other materials are needed to fabricate a DSSC. As shown in Fig. 28 we need to consider also the costs of front and rear glasses with FTO, electrolyte, catalyst (usually Pt), conductor (usually Ag) and sealing.
A comparison of material costs per Wp for the three classes of dyes (Ru-based, synthetic organic and vegetable) is shown in Fig. 30, where the results are obtained from the values reported in Tables 6 and 7. To quantify material costs we used available prices for kg-size batch of TiO2 (ref. 652) and g-size for dye batches.652–654

Costs of FTO coated glasses, Pt-catalyst, Ag-contacts are those reported in ref. 651 while the cost for a high temperature thermoplastic sealant (DuPont Bynel) is from ref. 653. Here, the estimation are based on the use of 0.091 m2 of sealant per each square meter of DSSC module.

Fig. 30 shows very different prices and relative distribution of the cost between materials for the different families of sensitizer used. Let us first consider the photoanode comprising the TiO2 and dye. The cost of some Ru-based dyes is below 1 € per Wp (see Fig. 30), however the low ε value requires a thick (∼10 mm) TiO2 layer. This consequently increases the TiO2 cost per Wp, which is slight above 1 € per Wp, (see Fig. 30). As reported in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, synthetic organic dyes have a larger ε with respect to Ru-dyes. This permits a reduction of the cost per Wp of the TiO2 layer for synthetic organic dye-based DSSCs. Nevertheless, the cost of synthetic organic dyes652 is about 10 times larger than the Ru-dyes,653 see Table 7, making the total cost of the photoanode above 3 Wp per €. For what concerns the vegetable dyes, they have a negligible cost of the dye itself.654 However, when η, ε and TiO2 surface coverage are taken into account, the price per Wp of the photoanode of anthocyanins is larger with respect to both synthetic organic and Ru-based dyes, mainly due to the lower dye concentration onto TiO2 and η, see Fig. 30. Contrary, although betalains have the same dye concentration onto TiO2 of the anthocyanins, the higher η and ε make betalain a much cheaper material for DSSC applications, see Fig. 30. Nevertheless, amongst vegetable dyes, chlorophylls have the highest η, ε and TiO2 surface coverage, see Table 7. This determines a reduction of the cost of the TiO2 layer per Wp of photoanodes sensitized with chlorophylls.
When the costs of the other materials needed to fabricate the DSSC are considered, we observe that all the devices based on vegetable dyes present a higher impact of these additional costs on the total price-per-Watt with respect to those based on Ru and synthetic organic dyes. This is due to the lower η of vegetable dyes, with respect to the synthetic organic and inorganic ones. As shown in Fig. 30, electrolyte costs have the largest impact on devices based on vegetable dye even though both sealing and glass contributes substantially to the final cost. By comparing the costs of all the DSSC families we can see that the use of chlorophylls may contribute to the reduction of the price per Wp of this PV technology. We stress the fact that the presented costs estimation is only based on the material costs, without considering the stability of the cells and thus endurance tests, which could significantly modify the price of the cells for applications requiring long timescale.
8. Outlook
The thought of imitating nature has been a dream for scientists over the centuries. In particular, the study of natural dyes remains an attractive and challenging goal contributing to a solution for future alternative environmentally sustainable energy conversion as predicted by G. Ciamician in his New York speech of 1912, “The photochemistry of the future” where he stated “…forests of glass tubes will extend over the plains and glass buildings will rise everywhere; inside of these will take place the photochemical processes that hitherto have been the guarded secret of the plants, but that will have been mastered by human industry which will know how to make them bear even more abundant fruit than nature, for nature is not in a hurry and mankind is.”655
Within the energy-harvesting field, DSSCs represent the most remarkable example of biomimetic devices, directly inspired by the photosynthesis. Many different types of synthetic and natural dyes have been investigated and a large set of data on the relationship between their chemical structure and PV performance of DSSCs have been collected. Despite the literature on the subject and notable progress made in power-conversion efficiency, there is still a long way to go before vegetable-based DSSCs can be considered an alternative to other PV technologies.656 While it would be beneficial to use vegetable dyes because they are more abundant, cheaper and eco-friendly with respect to synthetic metal-complexes and/or organic dyes, the efficiency of DSSCs sensitized by vegetable dyes is still lower than that achieved by the aforementioned synthetic dyes. The highest efficiency of DSSCs based on vegetable dye extracts, as reported in Fig. 31, is still lower than 5% for chlorophyll-based DSSC. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 7, chlorophylls as sensitizers are less expensive than Ru-dyes (∼18%) or synthetic organic dyes (∼45%), see Fig. 30. Thus, in terms of performance/cost ratio, some vegetable-based DSSC, such as those sensitized with chlorophyll, have a potential advantage over both Ru-based and synthetic organic DSSCs. Even though vegetable dyes based DSSC have a lower efficiency, see Fig. 31, they could be used in some niche applications, e.g., indoor applications657 (diffuse light) for powering small systems and home appliances, battery chargers for portable devices or educational demonstrators, where they can in principle compete with silicon-based solar cells. Nevertheless, to make natural dyes a solution of choice for DSSC technology, additional efforts are needed as briefly outlined below.
 Fig. 31  Progressing solar energy conversion efficiency of vegetable dye-based DSSCs from 1997 to 2014. Wine coloured squares anthocyanins, data taken from ref. 39, 47, 48, 337, 436 and 440; purple squares betalains data taken from ref. 41, 49, 50 and 337, green squares chlorophylls, data taken from ref. 337 and 346; yellow squares carotenoids, data taken from ref. 539; orange squares other vegetable dyes data taken from ref. 337 and 510 and blue square co-pigment (chlorophyll-carotenoids) data taken from ref. 540. The data on the right axis refer to state-of-the-art vegetable dye-based DSSC efficiency. 
Efficient natural sensitizers, as well as artificial ones, need to fulfill stringent properties such as harvesting light in wide range of the solar spectrum, bind strongly to the semiconductor nanoparticles and, upon excitation, efficiently inject electrons into the semiconductor conduction band. Moreover they require a rapid regeneration by the electrolyte and should exhibit a high VOC and high stability. Usually, the low VOC value, affecting the wide majority of vegetable dye-based DSSCs, is ascribed to a shift of the TiO2 Fermi level, which follow the adsorption of vegetal dye onto semiconductor layer, and to the dark current;41 and future research should address these two issues. Moreover, the dye structure is another fundamental parameter that affects the DSSCs performance. Steric hindrance of the dye molecules limits their ability to uniformly bind to the semiconductor surface, affecting the electron transfer process at the photoanode. Dye aggregation is another critical issue that deserves further investigation. Indeed, dye aggregation on the semiconductor layer produces high absorbance which does not directly translate into efficient electrons injection. Several kinds of additives such as chenodeoxycholic acid,289,303 or other compounds with either long alkyl chains (e.g., hexadecylmalonic acid)658 or bulky groups (e.g., dineohexyl bis(3,3-dimethylbutyl)) phosphinic acid659 can be exploited as co-adsorbant avoiding the dye aggregation on the semiconductor layer.
Another key point to be addressed in the development of vegetable dye-based DSSCs is the electrolyte. Indeed, unlike “conventional” DSSCs (based on synthetic organic/inorganic dyes), where enormous effort has been made to develop efficient electrolytes, vegetal dye-based DSSC still require optimization. A number of electrolyte additives have been developed for DSSC based on synthetic dyes to enhance the efficiency of the cell and to stabilize its PV performances. Carboxylic (e.g., hexadecylmalonic acid) and phosphonic acid derivatives (e.g., decylphosphonic acid) have been used to reduce carrier recombination, preserving dye integrity. 4-tert-Butylpyridine and N-methylbenzimidazole are commonly used as electrolyte additives, suppressing the dark current thus improving the efficiency of the cell.235,660 However, vegetable dyes such as anthocyanins, are pH sensitive, making additives such as 4-tert-butylpyridine or similar compounds less desirable. In fact, the basic nature of 4-tert-butylpyridine influences the dye molar extinction coefficient thus affecting the optical absorption properties (i.e., a red-shift in the absorption spectrum). Moreover, the 4-tert-butylpyridine addition shifts the conduction band edge toward negative potentials, minimizing the recombination losses due to dark currents. The addition of various cations on the electrolyte has been investigated and found to increase the PV performance of DSSCs. For example, Li in the form of Li+ intercalates in the TiO2 nanoparticles due to its small size or strongly adsorbs at their surface. The presence of Li can cause a positive shift in the flatband of TiO2 with a consequent reduction of VOC, and can also accelerate the rate of oxidized dye reduction by I−.
A common problem, not only intrinsic to vegetable dyes, in DSSC technology is the back electron injection from the TiO2 to the oxidized dye. The creation of interfaces between the dye and the semiconductor could be a viable solution to overcome such issues. For example, a Schottky barrier, which is a potential energy barrier for electrons at the metal–semiconductor junction, produced by inserting a metal layer between the semiconductor nanoparticles and the dye could be a possible strategy to reduce the back electron transfer.661
Metal layers, e.g., gold nanoparticles can also enhance charge separation in DSSCs,662 due to their ability to accept and conduct the current from the excited state of natural dyes to TiO2, thus preventing charge recombination. Unfortunately, the main problem relies on the anchoring of the vegetable dye to metal nanoparticles layer, affecting the electron transfer efficiency from the dye to the nanoparticles themselves. A solution could be the use of molecular layers as bridge structure, able to anchor with the nanoparticles and at the same time linking the vegetable dye.
The successful use of vegetable dyes in DSSCs not only depends on the identification of the right dyes, but also on the ability to modify on-demand their photo-electrochemical properties. Although optimization of vegetable dyes is in progress, exploiting functional groups to improve the charge transfer between the dye and electrolyte mediator and from the dye to the semiconductor layer surface,663 more effort is still required. The exploitation of carbon-based nanomaterials (e.g., graphene and carbon nanotubes) to modify the architecture of the semiconductor film could improve the electron lifetime thus reducing the dark current at the photoanode. Preliminary results,664i.e., the incorporation of graphene in the anthocyanin dye mixture and the subsequent co-adsorption onto the titanium nanoparticles to suppress electron recombination, suggest that this could be a route worthy of further study. Another area where carbon-based nanomaterials can strongly contribute in the improvement of DSSCs is the replacement of expensive Pt-based counter electrodes.
Panchromatic systems, sensitive to all the light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, are often used successfully in DSSCs because of their capability to harvest a broader portion of the solar spectrum in comparison to individual dyes. Vegetable dyes are ideal systems for such a task due to their diverse and complementary absorption properties. Unfortunately, although vegetable dyes show high molar extinction coefficient over a wide absorption range, they tend to have low efficiencies when used as dyes in DSSCs. An advanced panchromatic system could be developed preparing a double layer (bicolor photoanode),665 exploiting a similar approach to the one used in photography for the preparation of color films.
The photo-stability of vegetable dyes-based DSSCs is another crucial point that requires further investigation.666 Indeed, the dye must be capable of many redox cycles (turnover higher than 106, i.e., number of cycles that a dye molecule can support within a cell calculated from the ratio of dye regeneration rate by electrolyte and oxidative dye degradation rate) without undergoing decomposition. Nature supplies a large variety of vegetable dyes, designed to protect fruits and flowers in different ways, e.g., antioxidant activity, and scientists working in this field are called to exploit them alone or in mixture (co-pigmentation) to enhance the stability and efficiency of vegetable dye-based DSSCs. The use of UV and anti-reflective filters also improve dye reliability light reflection. Another route toward the increase of dye photo-stability could be the use of co-pigmentation and/or the use of additives linking the dye with the semiconductor layer without affecting the photo-electrochemical properties, while still preserving the stability against heating or undesired redox reactions.667
Life-cycle analyses now available for conventional DSSC PV systems668,669 show a limited environmental impact of such PV technology and vegetable dyes are expected to decrease such impact even further.

 	Fig. 12  Structural differences between betacyanin (betanidin and betanin) and betaxanthin dyes. The wavelengths of maximum absorption and the ε are also reported. Adapted from ref. 49.	 

 	Fig. 13  Thermal degradation pathways of betanin (as an example) and their corresponding chromatic changes. Dehydrogenation of betanin at C15 leads to yellow coulored neobetanin while, decarboxylation at C17 causes the appearance of a orange-red colored decarboxybetanin. Deglycosylation of betanin produces its complete transformation in betanidin. This process is enzymatically catalyzed by treatment of the purified betanin with β-glucosidase in heat/acid environment. By thermal treatment in alkaline ambient, cleavage of betanin can also occurs (adapted from ref. 468 and 476.)	 

 	Fig. 14  HOMO (left) and LUMO (center) for excitation of betanidin [adapted from ref. 473] and label of probable deprotonation sites (right).

 	Fig. 16  Basic structures and the oxidation state of natural chlorophylls: Chl-a, Chl-b, Chl-c, Chl-c1 and Chl-c2, Chl-d and Chl-f.	 

 	Fig. 17  Comparison amongst the absorption spectra of naturally occurring Chls having porphyrin, bacteriochlorin and chlorophyll macrocycles. Inset: Chl-b, Chl-d and Chl-f. Protochlorophyllide-a is a 17-CH2CH2COOH analog of Chl-c1. Data taken from ref. 283 and 489.	 

 	Fig. 18  (a) Absorption spectra of Chl-c1 and Chl-c2 in solution and (b) on the TiO2 layer. (c) IPCE (%) curves and (d) I–V curves of TiO2 based DSSC sensitized with Chl-c1 and Chl-c2 dyes. (Data taken from: ref. 346).
