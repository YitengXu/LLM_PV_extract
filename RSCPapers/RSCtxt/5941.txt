Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of algae is appealing because it eliminates a drying step and offers fast kinetics, low char/tar rates, high carbon efficiency and good scale-up potential. Limited understanding of the algae breakdown mechanisms in SCWG, including kinetics and char formation, together with high pressures and temperatures, challenging for containment materials, make reactor design difficult. Dewatering and pumping of algae at high concentration in a cost-effective manner is also challenging. Integration of concentrated solar-thermal (CST) heat into SCWG of algae offers the potential for lower-cost fuel production, since CST is a cheaper energy source than unprocessed algae. However, CST heat integration is challenging due to the additional impact of sunlight variability. Integration of intermittent solar synthesis gas flows with downstream liquid-fuel processing such as the Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis raises other challenges. Off-sun SCWG reactors downstream of a high-temperature salt storage offer future potential. The falling cost of green hydrogen input offers new opportunities to achieve lower-cost solar-SCWG system configurations. This review provides a general overview of algae-fed SCWG technology and challenges, then discusses CST-integrated SCWG of algae and its prospects for lower-cost liquid fuel production.
1 Introduction
Of the current total global primary energy demand, 83.1% is met by the fossil-fuel energy sources of oil, coal and natural gas, with shares of around 31.2%, 27.2% and 24.7% in 2020, respectively.1 It has become quite evident over the last few decades that excessive dependence on fossil-based fuels, coupled with the growing overall energy demand, is unsustainable not only because of the clearly detrimental climate-change impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,2,3 but also due to gradually reducing energy return on energy investment (EROEI) of crude oil in particular. Although alternatives exist in the case of land-based transport—most notably battery and fuel-cell electric vehicles—the movement away from petroleum fuels and internal combustion engines is still relatively slow. Furthermore, there are no practicable solutions for aviation and shipping yet. Thus, research attention is focused on the development of new, clean, and sustainable transportation fuel production technologies, such as biomass-to-liquids (BTL), or hydrogen pathway via electrolysis of water from renewable electricity. It has been argued that any expectations of hydrogen becoming a replacement for oil or natural gas in the near future may be too optimistic.4,5 As a result, biomass-derived fuels are of strong interest and are expected to play a key role in the global energy transition.
Conversion of biomass into value-added products such as liquid fuels is a feasible approach to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Regardless, such technologies have come under strong criticism and scrutiny internationally. First- and second-generation biofuels relied heavily on production from arable land, which is otherwise needed for food or timber production or environmental preservation.6 The 2008 report by Gallagher7 recommended that “a slowdown in the growth of biofuels is needed until adequate controls to address displacement effects are implemented”, and that “the feedstock production must avoid agricultural land that would otherwise be used for food production”. In order to address these concerns, any clean liquid-fuel technology should be: (i) competitive with petroleum based fuels in terms of quality and cost, and (ii) not competing with infrastructural/agricultural land and water. Several existing and new algae-to-fuel process technologies satisfy these requirements, including hydrothermal liquefaction,8–10 pyrolysis,11–13 torrefaction,14 anaerobic digestion,15,16 photobiological hydrogen production,17,18 conventional gasification19–21 and transesterification.22
Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is such a process, and converts wet biomass and carbonaceous waste. Compared to these other processes, it offers very fast reaction times, tolerance of variations in feedstock composition, high carbon conversion, and no need for feedstock drying. Anerobic digestion, in particular, is much slower, requiring up to 15–20 days reaction time, and yields ∼25% sludge that requires further processing to avoid environmental nitrification.23 Compared to conventional gasification, SCWG offers more flexibility in terms of feedstock, lower char/tar formation, higher yield, and reduced feedstock-drying costs. Integrating the SCWG process with a concentrated solar thermal (CST) heat source offers a renewable and carbon-free replacement to traditional gasification process—in which the energy for gasification is provided by burning the feedstock/fuel—with higher synthesis gas (syngas, the combination of H2 and CO) yield. Using solar heat in place of burnt biomass has the potential to reduce overall fuel costs, depending on feedstock preparation and CST technology costs. It can be argued that algae are the ideal feedstocks for the SCWG process. Algae, as a renewable biomass source, are not a seasonal crop, have a high growth rate, can be cultivated even in brackish water, and contain high fixed carbon. Production of syngas via SCWG of algae typically results in methane which, if it is to be incorporated into the fuel, requires a reforming step before the syngas is suitable for downstream Fischer–Tropsch (FT) or methanol synthesis (MS) process. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) technologies, in particular Fischer–Tropsch and methanol synthesis, have been studied extensively in literature from both technological and commercial perspectives.24,25 However, almost all of these processes operate best as continuous operations, whereas a solar-thermal powered syngas production process will experience significant diurnal and seasonal transients due to variations in the solar resource. Coupling these two subsystems is quite challenging. A large syngas storage buffer would be required to handle the fluctuations in the syngas production—due to the solar intermittency—and thus supply a constant or near-constant syngas input to run the liquid fuel production plant optimally, subject to infrastructure costs.
This article aims to examine the barriers to, and provide a justification for, an integrated thermochemical conversion route based on solar-driven supercritical water gasification of algae, as a viable carbon-neutral liquid fuel production route. In the process, the article first reviews the current understanding of supercritical water gasification of biomass, with special emphasis on algae (Section 2). This section also argues the advantages of supercritical water as a gasification medium vis-á-vis conventional gasification, char formation mechanism in algae-fed SCWG, theoretical understanding of the SCWG process, experimental studies of SCWG, the accompanying materials challenges, and the system integration for non-solar SCWG. The uniqueness of this review lies in its coverage of the integrated process chain of solar SCWG algae-to-fuel production pathway, understanding the challenges in scale-up of this concept as well as the dynamics of storage on the performance of the process (Section 3). Section 4 highlights and addresses the concerns raised with regards to algal biofuel production assisted by solar-thermal heat. The article identifies knowledge gaps within each area and the key focus areas for research and innovation, with the aim of developing sustainable algae-based fuel technology.
2 Supercritical water gasification of algae
Simplistically, gasification refers to the partial oxidation of carbonaceous feedstock at high temperatures. Conventional gasification, carried out in air or oxygen, requires dry feedstock and can be visualised as a combination of three main steps—drying, pyrolysis, and gasification. The feedstock can be any carbonaceous material (biomass, coal or coke). Supercritical water gasification (SCWG), on the other hand, uses supercritical water (critical point of water: 374 °C and 220.8 bar) as a reaction medium. The process converts the energy stored in the feedstock into the chemical energy in syngas containing mostly carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Equations describe the reactions in SCWG of biomass. [CxHy−2Oz−1]n + nH2O → nCxHyOz(1) CxHyOz + (2x − z)H2O → xCO2 + (2x − z + y/2)H2(2) CxHyOz + (x − z)H2O → xCO + (x − z + y/2)H2(3) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2(4) CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O(5)
A detailed review of the supercritical water gasification technology, with specific focus on algal biomass has been presented in this section. The important characteristics of the process have been divided into identifying the merits of algae as a feedstock, the use of supercritical water as a gasification medium and mechanistic understanding of the algae conversion including char formation mechanism, thermodynamic and kinetic assessment of the process and the effect of catalysts.
2.1 Algae as a renewable carbon source
Algae are recognised as one of the oldest lifeforms (thallophytes which have no roots, stems or leaves, and have chlorophyll as the primary photosynthetic pigment). Owing to their simple structure, which is not developed beyond the cell formation stage, algae can adapt to harsh environmental conditions. Macro- and micro-algae compositions depend on several genetic and phenotypic factors, including environmental and culture conditions.26–28 The bulk of the total fixed carbon in algae, is present in the form of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins.‡ It can be argued that algae are one of the best-suited feedstocks for fuel synthesis. Some of the advantages of using algae as a feedstock are:
• Algae are non-seasonal crops. The fuel productivity of algae will far exceed the yield of any cultivated biomass such as rapeseed, jatropha, soy-bean and other oilseed crops.
• Algae can be cultivated in harsh environments such as salt-water and non-arable land. Its water consumption during cultivation period is lower than that of other terrestrial crops. Thus, they do not compete with either agricultural land or infrastructure development.
• One of the biggest advantages of algal feedstock is that by varying the growth conditions, optimum biochemical composition (lipid/protein/carbohydrate content) can be obtained for maximising fuel production. Additionally, microalgae grow extremely rapidly; some species are known to double their biomass within a few hours.
• An interesting alternative is to have the algae growth ponds close to large power plants or other industrial sources of CO2 for utilising their waste CO2 streams.30 Microalgae have the ability to grow in industrial waste water, which provides both the growth media and the required nutrients, in particular N and P. A potential application is the treatment of organic effluent from the agro-food industry.31
• Algae are high in fixed carbon content and low in volatile matter as compared to other biomass species.32 This can potentially result in higher syngas yield and higher process efficiency during gasification.
As evident form Fig. 1, the ash content in algae is quite high ∼8–10% compared to other biomass species. The ash content of some microalgae species is observed to be as low as 5%, but can be significantly higher in others.32–34 In a continuous flow reactor system, ash can lead to plugging and corrosion of reactor tubes.

Meanwhile, the viscosity of algae in a concentrated mixture with water is another important consideration. After cultivation, algae with a low concentration needs to be de-watered using filters and centrifuges and even dried, depending on the use. For gasification in supercritical water, de-watering to 5–15% is considered necessary, which results in a thick paste that is challenging to pump. A trade-off must be examined between the high cost of de-watering and exergy costs of cycling large amounts of water with the algae within the process.35

2.1.1 Production of algae. 
Algae can be grown using a wide range of cultivation methods. Broadly, either open ponds or closed photobioreactors is used, with open ponds being far cheaper but subject to contamination by foreign algae species. Of the open ponds, the cheapest and most mature for large-scale application is the raceway pond, which circulates and aerates the algae to improve growth rates. Raceways ponds have been proposed to use waste CO2, for example from power station flue gas, as a further strategy to increase growth and lower cost.35,36
Brandenberger et al.37 examined a range of algae ‘farming’ techniques, and concluded that raceway ponds are the most cost-effective. Their findings are consistent with previous research on algae cultivation.38 Around 15% of the total calorific value of the biomass is spent in the production process itself. This implies that an energy input of 280 TJ per annum was required to produce algae with total energy content of 1895 TJ per annum. The total production cost of algal biomass was estimated to be 2.7 USD/kg (total solids). In a more recent report, Davis et al.35 estimated the cost of algae production for 10 acre pond size at a much lower value of 491 USD/ton ash-free dry weight (AFDW). It should be noted that the CO2 input for algae growth was assumed to be from a concentrated source (flue gas from a power-plant) rather than atmospheric. The report emphasised on increasing algae growth rate, the scale of production, reducing cost and increasing efficiency of de-watering, and most importantly, identifying opportunities for low cost CO2 and nutrient sources, as the chief drivers for further reducing the cost of algae production.
Currently, commercial cultivation of algae is primarily limited to nutraceutical and aquaculture industries. The estimated global market size for nutraceutical products is >50 billion dollars, primarily in the United States, Japan and Europe, with a potential growth to over 200 billion dollars in the near term.39 However, the size of these industries is far smaller than that would be required for meaningful large-scale liquid fuel production from algae. An topic of emerging interest for algae cultivation is in phycoremediation, which is the use of biological processes to remove contaminants from soil, air or water, for which SCWG has been highlighted for its potential to safely process the resulting contaminated biomass while providing energy-rich product gas as a byproduct.40

2.2 Supercritical water as a gasification medium
Thermodynamically, the critical point of a fluid is represented by the divergence in isothermal compressibility (κT = (−1/V)(∂V/∂P)T), and expressed by the conditions (∂P/∂V)T = 0 and (∂2P/∂V2)T = 0. The practical implication of such a state means that two or more co-existing fluid phases become indistinguishable at the critical point. Supercritical fluids do not exhibit any phase change and their thermo-physical properties are generally intermediate to those typical of their liquid and gaseous phases. For example, most supercritical fluids demonstrate the unique combination of liquid-like density and gas-like mass transport properties, which are extremely useful in industrial engineering applications. A more detailed overview of the physical properties of supercritical water as a reaction medium has been presented by García et al.,41 and with primary focus on organic chemical reactions by Savage.42
Supercritical water exhibits some unique solvent properties compared to its liquid state. Under normal temperature and pressure, water is a polar molecule having a high degree of hydrogen bonding. It dissolves other polar substances, such as common inorganic salts, while the non-polar substances such as hydrocarbons are insoluble. Under supercritical conditions, the density of water is reduced by about an order of magnitude, which is sufficient to trigger a drastic reduction in hydrogen bonding as well as the dipole–dipole interaction. The number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule is decreased from around 3.5 to 1.8 under supercritical conditions.43 As a result, supercritical water behaves more like a non-polar rather than a polar solvent. The ionic product of water, Kw(P,T), which is a measure of solvent dielectric property, is discussed in Section 2.6.1. Most hydrocarbons and gases are soluble and inorganic salts are insoluble in supercritical water. This is in contrast to their behaviour in liquid water.
The viscosity of supercritical water, which is crucial for designing high throughput continuous-flow systems on an industrial scale, has been studied both experimentally (using capillary method44–46 and oscillating disk47–49), and theoretically.50 The Sengers–Kamgar–Parsi equation for computing viscosity as a function of temperature and density, predicts that the viscosity of supercritical water is quite low compared to its liquid state.50 Based on this discussion, the potential advantages of using supercritical water as a reaction media for gasification are:
• Enhanced dissolution of organic biomass species in supercritical water facilitates homogeneous gasification and leads to reduction in char formation (compared to dry gasification). Consequently, carbon efficiency of the process is increased.51
• SCWG provides flexibility in terms of feedstock selection. For example, wet biomass such as sewage sludge, black liquor (waste stream from Kraft process in pulp and paper industry), bagasse, and micro-algae could potentially be used directly without drying.
• The syngas produced using the SCWG process is already at a very high pressure. It can be argued that this may be exergetically advantageous to the downstream processes such as Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis. It should be noted that this advantage is partially negated by the higher solubility of permanent gases, especially CO2, in water at high pressures, which would lower the carbon efficiency of the process.
2.3 Mechanism of algae decomposition in supercritical water
A complete understanding of its breakdown mechanism is difficult because algae is a complex mixture of organic biopolymers. A simple approach is to treat algae as a mixture of model compounds which accurately resemble these biochemical units. At high temperature and pressure, these biopolymer units are hydrolysed into their respective monomers, such as, glucose, xylose, fatty acids, guaiacol, alanine and glycine. Yoshida and Matsumura57 utilised a simplistic approach to study a mixture of cellulose, xylan and lignin representing real biomass, and assuming that the products formed in gasification of real biomass are the weighted average of the gasification products of the individual biochemical components. Experimental yields showed a significant departure from weighted average composition predictions, especially for CH4 and H2. The various components of the mixture decompose at vastly different rates,51 with the possibility of interactions between the intermediates formed from one component and another. In this case, the hydrogenation of lignin leads to an increase in CH4 production and corresponding decrease in H2 production.57 It should be noted that, in the work of Yoshida and Matsumura,57 two factors contributed to the inaccuracy of the weighted average model: (a) the gasification temperature was quite low, leading to slow kinetics, and (b) lignin is difficult to gasify, with complete gasification observed only around 700 °C under non-catalytic SCWG.58 It can be argued that, at higher temperatures (faster kinetics) and with algae as feedstock (no lignin), the predictions using the weighted average method could yield more accurate results. Yakaboylu et al.,53 Okolie et al.56 and Hu et al.,59 in their recent review papers, have extensively covered the known decomposition mechanisms of the various model compounds representative of the components of real biomass, including glucose/fructose (cellulose), xylose (hemi-cellulose), phenol, guaiacol and catechol (lignin), glycerol and fatty acids (lipids), and alanine/glycine (proteins). Additionally, the binary and multi biomass interactions during SCWG, including carbohydrate–lignin, carbohydrate–protein, and lignin–protein, have also been reviewed in detail previously.59 A general reaction scheme for decomposition of various biochemical components in supercritical water, compiled from several sources,52–56 is presented in Fig. 2.

An undesirable product of the breakdown of biomass is char, which lowers the carbon efficiency. It is a collective name for high molecular weight carbonaceous solid compounds which are quite difficult to gasify, and hence, stay in the reactor causing plugging, heat exchanger fouling and catalyst deactivation. At the commonly used temperatures of gasification, the conversion of biomass to char is an irreversible reaction.60 SCWG has the potential to significantly reduce char formation due to the higher solubility and reactivity of organic compounds in supercritical water, but nevertheless continues to be reported as an issue in experimental studies. An understanding of the formation mechanism of char in SCWG is therefore quite necessary.
The char formation can take place through two modes: (1) polymerisation61 and recondensation62 of certain undesirable water-soluble intermediates, (2) pyrolysis of the insoluble part of biomass similar to that obtained from dry gasification.63 In the case of SCWG, high solubility of most organic species circumvents one of these modes of char formation. The water soluble component of biomass gasification can be sub-divided into two classes: (1) the low molecular weight acids, aldehydes and ketones which subsequently breakdown into desirable gases such as CO, CO2 and H2, and (2) the aromatic ring compounds that are widely believed to participate in polymerisation en-route to char formation.51
In sub-critical water, where ionic conditions prevail, the high concentration of H+ and OH− ions catalyses the dehydration of biomass molecules, hence forming aromatic ring compounds such as furfurals and phenols.62 One of these ring compounds, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), has often been attributed to char formation.64,65 The kinetic behaviour and mechanism of conversion from 5-HMF to char is still not clearly understood though. Luijkx et al.66 and Chuntanapum and Matsumura51 presented contradicting observations while investigating the conversion of 5-HMF under hydrothermal conditions. The former found that under near-critical conditions, char formation is close to 7% of the initial carbon content, and that temperatures of 370 °C and higher lead to a constant conversion rate of 5-HMF with no temperature dependence at >370 °C. This can be seen as an effect of the decreasing water density and the ionic properties of supercritical water, resulting in competing hydrolysis and pyrolysis reactions. However, these findings are in stark contrast to Chuntanapum et al.,62 who reported no char formation under either super- or sub-critical conditions and lower reaction rates as compared to Luijkx et al.66 There is strong dependence of char formation on the concentration of initial feedstock (0.05 M in Luijkx et al.66 as compared to 0.02 M in Chuntanapum et al.62), especially under conditions enabling ionic reactions. This is confirmed in a subsequent study by the same authors,67 where spherical solid particles were observed in the reactor effluent at 0.15 M concentration of 5-HMF. However, no char formation was evident when the temperature was supercritical, even at high concentrations of 5-HMF.
Although there is enough experimental evidence for by-product char formation in hydrothermal treatment of biomass, the role of any particular intermediates/precursors is quite unclear. Based on kinetic modelling and experimental results, Chuntanapum et al.51,62,67 have suggested a plausible mechanism of how char is formed during gasification of certain model compounds, as shown for the case of SCWG of glucose in Fig. 3. The research interestingly concludes that the contribution of char produced from 5-HMF is negligible, and there is definitive evidence of the interaction between 5-HMF intermediate and the other decomposition products. It should be noted that this mechanism is relevant for cellulosic biomass only. In case of algae and other biomasses, the interplay between the decomposition of other biochemical components and char formation from polymerisation reaction is an important consideration, as the greater presence of inorganic species may significantly impact the decomposition mechanism. Significant research effort is required to understand the effect of these mutual interactions between the intermediates in SCWG of algae and their consequence on final char yield.

2.4 Theoretical modelling of SCWG
The thermodynamic equilibrium of any closed multi-component chemical reaction system can be modelled through three approaches: discrete reaction equilibria (stoichiometric modelling), Gibbs free energy minimisation (when system is at constant T and P), and entropy maximisation (system is at constant P and H). In the case of algae gasification, intermediates and reaction pathways, which are imperative for stoichiometric models, are relatively less understood. Hence, the Gibbs function minimisation has been the most used approach, wherein the Gibbs free energy of individual components and the mixture are determined using an equation of state (EoS). An EoS is any relationship between the “state functions” such as, pressure (P), temperature (T), volume (V), internal energy (U) or specific heat (cp) that defines the physical state of matter under given conditions. Comprehensive reviews on the evolution of various equations of state exist in literature.72–74 Supercritical conditions represent extremely non-ideal behaviour, requiring a complex EoS to predict the phase equilibrium. The van der Waal's (vdW) EoS (1873) is, perhaps, the simplest cubic-EoS but is rarely sufficient for accurate predictions near the critical point.73 Wei and Sadus73 reviewed the modifications suggested75–77 to the original vdW EoS for improving its accuracy in the supercritical regime. Comparisons between different mixture property calculation techniques and their applicability to supercritical water gasification can be found in literature. Although the real biomass gasification models78–80 are quite applicable to algae as well, only a few reports have exclusively validated these for algal biomass. For example, Freitas and Guirardello69 implemented a multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs free energy minimisation in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System) for simultaneously studying the chemical and phase equilibrium in microalgae gasification. Microalgae was treated as a pseudo-component with a generic chemical formula CaHbOcNd where the coefficients a, b, c, d were taken from literature. The model employed the virial equation of state, truncated at the second virial coefficient, for incorporating non-ideal behaviour. Fig. 4a shows the comparison of their model predictions with experimental data obtained by Chakinala et al.68 and also the ideal mixture model. The virial model shows close agreement with the experimental findings, whereas, the ideal mixture model, quite expectedly, is inaccurate in comparison to the virial model. The authors have also compared their model with Castello and Fiori,70 who used Peng-Robinson EoS with vdW mixing rule for calculating fugacity. Both of the approaches yield quite similar results over a wide range of temperature and feedstock concentrations. The use of vdW mixing rules for supercritical fluids has been suggested in the literature Kwak and Mansoori.81 In general, the Gibbs energy minimisation technique used in conjunction with non-ideal equations of state (such as virial, SRK and Peng–Robinson with appropriate mixing rules) are capable in providing results which are in agreement with the experimental data for the supercritical water gasification of algae.

(b) A comparison of equilibrium compositions calculated using two different equations of state—virial by Freitas and Guirardello69 (solid lines) and Peng–Robinson by Castello and Fiori70 (symbols), with a feed concentration of 60 wt% of Spirulina sp. and pressure 250 atm.

Vaezi et al.82 developed a thermodynamic modelling tool for selection of appropriate feedstock material, wherein the maximum theoretical product gas-yields from conventional gasification could be predicted for different elemental composition of biomass under specific operating conditions. This approach was applied by Louw et al.71 to the case of SCWG, offering a tool that provides key insights prior to conducting experimental work. They developed an equilibrium model in ASPEN Plus, and used it to predict the product gas-yield, carbon efficiency and heat duty of the SCWG process at varying (theoretical) biomass compositions. Different variants of Peng–Robinson and Redlich–Kwang–Soave EoS were used for calculating the supercritical phase equilibrium, and the model predictions showed very good accuracy when compared with experimental works from Antal et al.,78 Byrd et al.83 and Chakinala et al.68 (RMSE < 1% and R2 > 0.9 in most cases). A representative case for the effect of biomass composition on isothermal SCWG at 700 °C and 15% biomass concentration is shown in Fig. 5. It is noteworthy that the cold gasification efficiency§ shown in Fig. 5, does not take into account input heat requirement for the endothermic SCWG reaction, hence cannot be considered representative of the thermal efficiency of the gasification process.

The methodology described above predict an “unconstrained” equilibrium state compounds. Most real biomass conversion systems are unable to reach this final state of equilibrium due to local equilibrium constraints, such as char formation and vast difference in the kinetics of part-reactions.84 Keck and Gillespie85 introduced a rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) modelling technique to accurately model partial-equilibrium of combustion process through Gibbs energy minimisation. A similar approach has been developed by Yakaboylu et al.84 for modelling SCWG of algae. The additional constraints on the unconstrained Gibbs energy minimisation include limits on carbon-efficiency, dissolved carbon conversion and constraining the amounts of specific species. The constraints are usually reaction and system specific, and are obtained experimentally. The approach shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of the gas-yield predictions vis-á-vis previous EoS-based unconstrained minimisation approaches.
Kinetic modelling of the algae gasification process is also important for demonstrating mechanistic understanding. The kinetics of SCWG of different biomass species have been extensively reported, although, only a few studies have focused on algal biomass.53,86–88 The complexity and compositional variability of algae make the model reaction schemes extremely non-trivial. Hence, the majority of the studies initially focused on either monomers or model compounds. Castello and Fiori87 have compared three models for the SCWG of methanol, using GRI-Mech 3.0,89 Brock and Savage90 and Webley and Tester.91 Comparison with experimental data elucidates that the model of Webley and Tester91 shows the best agreement with experimental data, followed by that of Brock and Savage90 and GRI-Mech 3.0, respectively. The limitation of these models is that they can only explain homogeneous gas-phase reactions. However, water–gas shift and methanation occur on the surface of the catalyst. In order to make the model more comprehensive, the catalytic kinetic model should also be incorporated.
In a more recent study, Tushar et al.88 have modelled the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW), Eley–Rideal (ER) and Power Law (PL) mechanisms for two types of biomass model compounds glucose and a mixture of phenol and HMF (glucose, phenol and HMF representing cellulose/hemicellulose, lignin, and the precursor of tar, respectively). The study attempted to identify the rate determining step (RDS) in SCWG of the model compounds for which reaction pathways are relatively well understood. In the LHHW model, both of the reactants must be adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and then react, whereas in the ER model, only one reactant (feedstock in this case) gets adsorbed on the catalyst surface and the reaction progresses between the adsorbed reactant and the gas phase. The first reaction step in both of these models is the Retro–Aldol cleavage reaction—the decomposition of glucose into glycol aldehyde and erythrose; the follow up reactions are different for LHHW and ER mechanisms (shown in Fig. 6). Based on the average absolute deviation (AAD%) between the experimental findings and model predictions, the ER with Retro–Aldol condensation as RDS, and the power law mechanisms were most accurate (AADs of 10.6% and 4.6% respectively). Similar detailed kinetic modelling has also been performed for tert-butylbenzene92 and glycerol93 in supercritical water. Due to the lack of established mechanisms in the case of an algal feedstock, such analysis has not yet been reported. Future work could consider the breakdown of algae molecules into their monomers (amino acids, glucose, and glycerol, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and lipid fractions respectively), which is believed to occur almost immediately under supercritical conditions. Subsequently, the breakdown mechanisms of these monomers can possibly be utilised to determine the rate determining step for algae gasification.

The lumped intermediate approach has also been used for modelling the kinetics of SCWG of algae. This technique has been utilised for a number of simple sugar and real biomass model compounds including glucose, fructose, simple sugars, xylose, guaiacol, and cellulose.53 In a further study, Yakaboylu et al.94 used the lumped kinetic model for several biochemical compounds to create a predictive model in ASPEN for investigating SCWG of biomass at temperatures up to 650 °C, at pressures between 25–30 MPa, and at dry matter concentrations up to 10 wt% in the feed. The model involves 55 reactions in the sub-critical region and 74 reactions in the supercritical region. The validation with the experimental results was found to be in quite good agreement, and the case studies for microalgae, pig-cow manure mixture, and paper-pulp showed that the gas-yield and carbon gasification efficiency trends were similar to experimental results. This approach is comparable to the rate-controlled constrained equilibrium (RCCE) prediction approach84 discussed earlier. However, the fundamental difference lies in the Gibbs-energy minimisation based partial thermodynamic equilibrium in RCCE versus a lumped-intermediate kinetic model here, which can more accurately account for reactor design and residence time constraints. In a recent study by Nurcahyani et al.,95 the authors employed a five-step reaction network to analyse the kinetics of raw and hexane-defatted algal biomass under supercritical water (SCW) at 600–650 °C and 25 MPa. They found higher gasification rate in case of hexane-soluble algal component, 3.5 times faster, than the solid algae.
The only kinetic model for SCWG of algae available in the literature predicting the yield of gaseous components was developed by Guan et al.86Fig. 7 illustrates the schematic of their two lumped intermediates (slow and fast reacting) modelling approach. The possible products considered were char, H2, CO, CO2, CH4 and C2Ha, with each gas forming through both decomposition and steam reforming of the two intermediates. Most of the CH4 gas yield was attributed to the decomposition of slow intermediates for short residence times and fast intermediates as residence time increases. In terms of CO2 production, the contribution of fast intermediates is negligible, whereas, the slow intermediates contribute more towards char formation. Although this research provides a great tool for prediction of gas yields during algae gasification, it has certain limitations:

• Only first order reaction kinetics has been assumed.
• Due to the nature of this approach, the composition of intermediates is unknown. The complexity of the feedstock chemistry is the main hindrance to using the stoichiometric approach.
• This kinetic model is only valid for the temperature range 450 °C to 550 °C in which the Arrhenius parameters are calculated. Model predictions at higher temperatures will need validation.
• A major limitation is that C2Ha is irreversibly produced from both intermediates with no further decay/dissociation. Therefore, at high temperatures and high reaction rates, these species dominate. At high temperatures, in addition to the equations considered by Guan et al.,86 reactions corresponding to the decay of C2Ha, should be considered.
In a study relating to the SCWG of food waste, Chen et al.96 found that a semi-empirical modified random pore (MRP) model was effective in predicting kinetics. They emphasised the role of catalytic effects due to alkaline earth metals present in the feedstock, and found that failing to capture these effects was a cause for underestimation of reactivity in other models. This approach is yet to be tested specifically with algae.
Under supercritical conditions, the auto-dissociation of the water molecules into OH− and H+ is different from that in subcritical conditions. Auto-dissociation virtually does not occur at all, and the equilibrium is shifted heavily towards H2O. Although these ions are in low concentrations, the data for ionic reactions in supercritical conditions is well known for glycerol via 15 different competing reaction pathways.93 All of these reactions are accompanied by a particular set of reaction kinetics. Further, the elementary reaction equations are described with greater accuracy than that of classical Arrhenius behaviour. Bühler et al.93 have experimentally shown that supercritical conditions render Arrhenius kinetic laws insufficient, and show that free radical mechanism reflects the experimentally observed gas composition. It also calls into question the work of Guan et al.,86 who utilised Arrhenius kinetics in their model to characterise the breakdown of algae.
2.5 Experimental studies of SCWG
SCWG of algae is at early stage of research. Proof-of-concept demonstrations have been established by a few researchers at the bench-top scale68,97–99 (see Table 1). Large-scale or pilot-plant data are quite scarce.¶ The effect of process parameters, materials compatibility and catalysis is important for industrial scale design of the gasification process.

One of the first studies on macroalgae gasification was performed at the University of Hawaii in 1990 by Antal et al.97 This was inspired by the fact that SCW was already being used in chemical reactions and extraction processes on an industrial scale, for example, oxidising organic wastes and destroying toxic substances (MODAR process). Additionally, a combination of the learnings from pyrolytic gasification processing and aquatic biomass being the largest available biomass feedstock, led to the development of SCWG of macroalgae and seaweeds. Antal et al.97 showed that it was possible to extract permanent gases (CO, CO2, H2, CH4) from a wet algal feedstock under supercritical conditions.
The potential of using algae-based fuels via SCWG has received increasing research attention in recent years. It was widely perceived that the fuel production process using algae (both micro- and macro-) would lead to a negative energy balance, which may not translate into a profitable industrial process. Hirano et al.,101 while gasifying a microalgae (Spirulina) and converting it to methanol, theoretically showed that the exergy of the methanol produced is higher than the total required energy for the process. This was the first investigation claiming a complete conversion of algal biomass into gaseous products, although at significantly high temperatures (850 °C to 1000 °C). The research also identifies that the bulk of the required energy (around 80%) was being utilised by algae production, essentially pointing toward the potential for either moving towards cheaper algal feedstocks (macroalgae or microalgae naturally occurring in lakes and ponds, such as, Anabaena or Microcystis) or improving the energy efficiency of micro-algae production. Even though Hirano's analysis was performed for a non-supercritical process, it was sufficient to pique the interest in alternative algal fuels.
An important hurdle to biofuel production using farmed algae is the method of cultivation.101 Stucki et al.102 designed a novel process for recycling the CO2 emissions from a fossil source, such as a power plant, and using it for growth of algae (Spirulina platensis) in photo-bioreactors. The algae thus produced was subjected to catalytic hydrothermal gasification at supercritical temperature and pressure. A closed-loop system with a photobioreactor (PBR), followed by catalytic gasification unit, wherein the nutrients containing nitrogen and sulphur were recirculated to the PBR as ammonium and sulphate salts, was studied. A key finding was that the sulphate salt, which is otherwise important to the growth of S. platensis (approximated by C1.0H1.71O0.48N0.19S0.005), leads to the formation of H2S in the SCWG reactor and can severely poison the noble-metal catalyst. Hence, a salt separation step is required not just to preserve the catalyst but also to recycle the expensive nutrients back to PBR.
The results of Stucki et al.102 were part of a much larger initiative for designing a process for bio-synthetic natural gas from microalgae (SunCHem). Subsequent research on the SunCHem process found that although nutrient recycling may seem necessary from a cost point of view, the presence of Ni as a trace contaminant (even 1–10 ppm) in the recycled effluent adversely affects the growth of microalgae. At around 25 ppm Ni concentration, complete inhibition of cell division was observed in the case of Phaeodactylum tricornutum algae. Similar observations have been made for trace amounts of Al in the recirculated reactor effluent.103 The study was successful in demonstrating the feasibility of catalytic supercritical gasification of microalgae through experiments in a batch reactor at temperature and pressure of 400 °C and 30–35 MPa, with the highest carbon efficiency for methane production reported as being 74%. However, as part of subsequent studies under SunCHem, continuous-flow reactor systems exhibited different gas yield compared to those previously demonstrated with batch reactors.103 This observation could be attributed to different mixing regimes prevalent in batch and continuous-flow reactors.
A comprehensive parametric study of the SCWG of microalgae under different operating conditions was presented by Chakinala et al.68 The authors investigated the effect of temperature (400–700 °C), reaction time (1–15 min), feedstock concentration (2.9–7.3%), and catalysts (Ni, Inconel, Ru/TiO2, NiMo/Al2O3, PtPd/Al2O3, and CoMo/Al2O3). A gasification efficiency of 84% with Ni catalyst, 600 °C temperature, 24 MPa pressure and 7.3 wt% algae concentration was achieved. When the temperature was increased to 700 °C and Ru/TiO2 catalyst was used, complete gasification was achieved. Fig. 8 shows the variation in product gas composition with temperature for non-catalytic SCWG of Nannochloropsis sp. Similarly, Cherad et al.99 also investigated the effect of feed concentration (3.33%, 6.66% and 13.3%), hold time (0, 30, 60 and 120 min), temperature (400, 450, 500 and 550 °C), catalyst type (Ru/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3 and NaOH) and catalyst loading (5–20%) on the gasification efficiency, energy recovery and gas yield. Carbon gasification efficiency (CGE) increased with an increase in temperature, hold time and catalyst loading while declined with the feed concentration increment. Miller et al.104 studied the non-catalytic SCWG of microalgae in a plug-flow continuous reactor. At temperature range of 550–600 °C and residence times of 4–9 seconds, they obtained the Arrhenius parameters and reported higher gasification rates.

Complete gasification of algal feedstock at relatively low temperatures, as shown by Chakinala et al.,68 was remarkable from two perspectives. Firstly, it established that carrying out the process under supercritical conditions leads to significantly less char formation as compared to the conventional gasification routes, primarily due to the properties discussed in Section 2.2, and secondly, microalgae production which is usually focused on high lipid/fat content for other conventional biofuel production routes, could alternatively aim for higher photosynthetic efficiency and rapid growth rates. The potential to completely convert carbonaceous feedstocks into gases, irrespective of their biochemical composition, also implies that SCWG can be used to supplement other incomplete conversion techniques such as hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) followed by lipid extraction. Lu and Savage,120 for the first time, experimentally showed that lipid-extracted hydrochar (a by-product of HTC lipid extraction, primarily containing polysaccharides and proteins121) can be gasified using the SCWG process. The HTC extraction approach is a simple and efficient method for biodiesel production and supplementing the process through SCWG for further energy recovery and nutrient recycling, as proposed by the authors, could have potential advantages. It will be interesting to compare the aforementioned combined HTC-SCWG operation vis-á-vis direct SCWG of the feedstock from an energy efficiency and economic perspective.
Until the early 2010s, very limited information was available regarding the intermediate products that are formed during SCWG of algae. Guan et al.86,122 presented an insight into the intermediates that are formed during non-catalytic SCWG of Nannochloropsis at 450–550 °C for different algae concentrations and reaction times. It was shown that the algae concentration strongly influenced the H2 yields, which was more than tripled by reducing the algae loading from 15 wt% to 1 wt% (Fig. 9). Another observation was the change in the nature and identities of the products with reaction time. At short reaction times (∼1–2 min), the major products were compounds of higher molecular weight, presumably, nitrogen-containing molecules that were formed from hydrolytic depolymerisation of proteins in the feedstock. Hydrocarbons, including neophytadiene and long n-alkanes, were also observed. At longer reaction times (∼30 min), the major products are lighter compounds such as substituted benzenes, phenols, and indoles. Benzenes and phenol formation can be attributed to the carbohydrates in the microalgae, as hydrothermal treatment of cellulose and glucose produces phenols. The intermediate products can be apportioned into two groups, slow- and fast-reacting intermediates. Guan et al.86 modelled the kinetics of gasification reaction using this simple reaction network wherein non-gaseous intermediates react at different rates to form either char or gases (discussed previously in Section 2.4).

The difference in biochemical composition and cell structure can influence the yield of product gases in SCWG. Fig. 10 is compiled with data from different sources105,111,122 for SCWG of various algae strains under similar pressure, temperature and algae loading conditions. As seen in this figure, CO2 is the major product gas yield for different strains of algae, followed by H2 and CH4—except for the S. platensis case in which the CH4 content is higher than the H2 content. Among the algae samples, the highest CO2 and H2 yields are attributed to Ch. Vulgaris and Nannochloropsis sp. species, respectively. It is argued that algae strains with more carbohydrates has been shown to be more suitable for H2 production.105 Taken together, the product gas yield and composition both vary (up to 3–4 times for some gases) substantially for different species due to differences in biochemical composition of these samples.105 Onwudili et al.105 studied three different strains of micro and macro-algae (Chlorella vulgaris (5.9 and 7.0 wt%), Spirulina platensis (7.8 and 7.6 wt%), and Saccharina latissima (9.2 and 24.2 wt%)) at 500 °C, 36 MPa pressure, 30 min reaction time and two different catalysts, namely, NaOH and Ni/Al2O3. The higher gasification efficiency in the case of Saccharina latissima was attributed to the possible decomposition of the macroalgae into gasifiable intermediates, due to the presence of alkali. Further research from the same group focussed on understanding the effect of different algae growth conditions and harvest time on the gasification products.111 Same experimental conditions as the earlier work were used.105Fig. 11 shows the variation in gas composition and calorific value of the gasification product of Saccharina latissima macroalgae, harvested at 4 different times during the year. The seasonal variation in temperature and sunlight results in higher carbohydrate and lower ash content in the summer harvest, thus, improved gasification. The study corroborated the findings of Stucki et al.102 regarding the sulphur poisoning of Ru catalyst, however, in contrast nutrient recycling was found to be beneficial to algae growth in this case.

Recently, Graz et al.112 performed the SCWG of macroalga, Ulva, in a batch reactor as well as in a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC). Hydrogen and methane rich product gas was obtained by SCWG at 400 °C to 500 °C temperature, 23–25 MPa pressure, and up to 16.4% algae concentration. The use of HDAC facilitated the visual observation of various stages during the gasification of algal biomass although similar results have been shown for other biomass species.123 Various stages of transformation from initial state to residue include loss of algae surface as the pressure increases, decomposition under supercritical conditions, homogenisation and colour change, and residual gas bubbles during cooling. The visual observation is consistent with the findings of the batch reactor experiments and that of several other researchers; the decomposition of algae is immediate and the gasification rates are high when supercritical conditions are employed.112
A partial list of experiments on SCWG of algal biomass, reported in literature, is presented in Table 1. The reported gasification efficiencies for different algae vary from 5% to 100%, depending on the experimental conditions and reactor type. A noteworthy fact is that a few studies have focussed on gasification in continuous reactors, with or without catalysts. This is especially important when considering solar-irradiated reactors for SCWG. We discuss the challenges of solar integration in Section 3.

2.5.1 Catalyst selection for SCWG. 
Although high gasification efficiency and circumventing the char formation can be achieved through high-temperature SCWG, the reduced strength and corrosion resistance of tube materials at high temperature (Section 2.6) leads to a desire for gasification at lower temperatures, for which the use of catalysts can be beneficial. As catalysts accelerate the gasification process of the formed intermediates, they can potentially limit the formation of char, even at low temperatures. Catalysts can also be exploited to favour the production of certain product species. A small caveat when comparing catalytic and non-catalytic SCWG is that there are very few studies which focus on truly non-catalytic intrinsic kinetics of the gasification reaction in supercritical media,124 primarily because:
• Reactor walls act as heterogeneous catalysts,
• Algae contains a lot of inorganic alkali salts, especially marine algae, which acts as homogeneous catalysts,
• Corrosion products from the reactor walls such as Fe, Ni and Cr ions can also catalyse the reaction.
Numerous studies have reported an increase in gasification efficiency, especially at lower temperatures, due to two types of catalysts: homogeneous alkali catalysts (for example, NaOH, KOH, K2CO3, CaCO3, Na2CO3 and KHCO3), and heterogeneous metal catalysts (i.e., consisting of Ru, Rh, Ni, Cr, Co, Zn, Pd, Pt, Ti and Mo).125 The literature available for catalytic SCWG of algae is quite limited but several catalysts have been used for other biomass. However, a detailed account of catalysis and associated issues is beyond the scope of this review. There are dedicated reviews for non-catalytic64 and catalytic125,126 SCWG of biomass. Here, we only discuss the commonly employed catalysts relevant for SCWG of algae.
Alkali catalysts for SCWG have been actively studied as they have the potential for splitting of C–C bonds, especially opening aromatic rings (phenols), and reducing the tar formation.124 They are especially attractive for hydrogen production application as alkali(s) are known to catalyse the water–gas shift reaction, yielding higher H2 and CO2 and lower CO.124 In the case of cellulose gasification, reducing the onset temperature of degradation has also been observed.64,125,127 A major drawback, however, is the difficulty in recovering the catalyst from the outlet stream, which makes the process expensive.128
Ni-based catalysts are the most commonly used heterogeneous catalysts for SCWG, primarily because the tar formation is minimised and at the same time water–gas shift, methanation, and hydrogenation reactions are facilitated.129 The efficacy of Ni or any other metal catalyst strongly depends on the catalyst surface area. In the SCWG process, Ni-catalysts are plagued by the high rate of sintering and deactivation due to carbon fouling.125 It has been suggested that catalyst activity of Ni can be enhanced by adding some elements such as Ru130 and Pt.131 Ruthenium on carbon support is another active catalyst for low temperature SCWG process which has greater stability than other metal catalyst like rhodium, palladium and platinum because of its resistance to sintering and carbon poisoning as well as the effectiveness in breaking C–C bonds.132 It has been shown that higher efficiency of gasification achieved in case of SCWG of formaldehyde, lignin and cellulose, as compared to NaOH and Ni/Al2O3.124

Fig. 12 illustrates the effect of different types of catalysts on SCWG of microalgae68 and macroalgae.99 In case of microalgae, the complete gasification is reported for excess Ru/TiO2 catalyst, followed by powdered Inconel and Ni-wire which showed close to 90% gasification efficiency. Although the authors have shown that excess Ru/TiO2 catalyst in this case has helped in complete gasification, yet surplus catalyst may not always be beneficial as it may lead to sintering and deactivation. In case of macroalgae, the most efficient type of catalyst was found to be 5% Ru/Al2O3, yielding the highest carbon gasification efficiency. The H2 yield can be increased by using alkali salts as catalyst as they are known to promote the water gas shift reaction.125,133

A consensus seems to be that ruthenium is more resistant to oxidation and hydrothermal sintering as compared to Ni catalyst.126 In addition to the high performance of supported Ru-catalyst (Fig. 12), their long term stability under SCWG conditions has also been confirmed.130,134 However, the presence of S-containing compounds, even in very low concentrations, can lead to a dramatic decrease in the catalytic activity (S-poisoning).130,135,136 An often suggested solution is incorporating a hydrothermal salt separator for sulfur removal.137–139 As discussed in Section 2.2, the solubility of ionic salts in supercritical water is quite low and can be used advantageously for removal of inorganic salts from the gasification medium prior to the SCWG reactor. High efficiency continuous salt precipitation and separation from supercritical water has been shown for several salts.137–139

2.6 Corrosion and material constraints for SCWG
In this section, we review how pressure and temperature influence factors that define the corrosion characteristics in supercritical water, as well as the strength of tube materials.

2.6.1 Influence of solvent dielectric properties. 
The polarising nature of a solvent or electrolyte is necessary for the progression of electrochemical corrosion. The contrasting dielectric behaviour of water under ambient (polar solvent) and supercritical conditions (non-polar solvent) was discussed in Section 2.2. Consequently, free radical mechanisms are favoured more than ionic mechanisms in the supercritical condition. Fig. 13a shows the variation in ionic product and density of supercritical water with pressure and temperature.140 The sharp dip (marked by the solid and broken vertical lines in Fig. 13a) in both density and ionic product corresponds to the phase transformation from liquid to supercritical, although an increase in pressure leads to a more gradual yet substantial decrease. As a consequence, ionic compounds have low solubility in supercritical water; for example, sodium chloride solubility reduces from ∼26.5 wt% at room temperature and pressure to 100 ppm in supercritical water.140 The low solubility and polarisation of ionic species in SCW implies, albeit counter-intuitively, that the corrosion rates in low-density SCW should be lower as compared to subcritical water. In fact, high corrosion rates are frequently observed in the region just below the critical point. From a practical perspective, this implies high susceptibility to corrosion in pre-heating and cooling components of a SCW system. A common understanding is that the temperature–density combination can be tailored to have lower corrosion rates of certain species in the supercritical phase (Fig. 13b). A detailed discussion on the physico-chemical properties of hot compressed water and their influence on corrosion has been presented in topical reviews by Kritzer140 and by Marrone and Hong.141
 Fig. 13  Properties of supercritical water: (a) variation in ionic product and density with temperature, and (b) the dependence of corrosion behavior on the density and pressure. Figure reproduced from Kritzer.140 


2.6.2 Influence of anions on corrosion in supercritical water. 
One of the important factors which determines the influence of anions on reaction rates is their interaction with the corrosion product. During SCWG, the metal dissolution takes place in the active regime (in contrast to SCWO where the trans-passive dissolution is more prevalent), as evidenced by Kritzer et al.142—who established that active dissolution of many metals including Fe, Ni, Cr, and Ti occurs under reducing conditions.
Some localised corrosion mechanisms such as pitting and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) are often associated with halide (chloride, bromide and iodide) solutions in supercritical water.143,144 Sulfate ions are also known to cause localised corrosion in some systems.141 Pitting only occurs in the presence of aggressive anionic species such as chlorides, and its severity can be correlated logarithmically with the bulk concentration of the anion. A number of notions have been put forward to explain the aggressiveness of chloride ion—such as solubility of many metal cations in chloride solutions, which is complemented by the fact that chloride ion is relatively small with high diffusivity. It is ubiquitous as a contaminant145 that penetrates the passive films, and facilitates the propagation of pitting through an autocatalytic mechanism. The algal biomass, especially the marine algae, brings along significant amounts of inorganic compounds containing Cl, S and N. Intuitively though, the SCWG environment is highly reducing, hence the susceptibility to pitting should be greatly reduced. However, Yang et al.146 compared the corrosion behaviour of SS316 and three Ni-based alloys, 625, 600 and 800, exposed to SCW at 400 °C and 24 MPa with 6000 ppm NH4Cl. They found that SS316 underwent severe corrosion attack for both general corrosion and intergranular attack. Although, Inconel 625 showed the best corrosion resistance amongst the tested alloys, it showed evidence of pitting corrosion. Trace amounts of NiO was also identified. However, Ni was selectively leached from the oxide films, as nickel amine may form at relatively low temperatures. Li et al.147 observed general and nodular oxidation of both SS310 and Inconel 625 during cyclical SCWG of biomass, with more pronounced oxide breakdown for the Inconel. Yan et al.148 also observed significant corrosion of both Hastelloy C276 and SS316L during SCWG of food waste at 500 °C and ∼28 MPa, increasing with increased levels of NaCl in the food.
Corrosion in reducing supercritical media is quite a complex phenomenon. The interdependencies between various solution parameters and their effect on corrosion in supercritical media are illustrated in Fig. 14. Even though several Ni-based alloys, such as Alloy 625 and C276, are shown to be the best suited for SCWG environment,140,149 the existing mechanisms and density-correlation models can only adequately explain the general corrosion characteristics. Their validity in more complex systems such as those containing biomass or algae has not been established yet. However, recent increase in the commercial interest in this area has attracted researchers to focus on the corrosion phenomenon in supercritical media.

2.6.3 Strength of tubular materials. 
The combination of high temperature and high pressure in SCWG reactor tubes presents a major challenge in relation to plastic and creep-fatigue failure of tube materials. At the elevated temperatures of ∼500 °C required for efficient gasification, the strength of suitable reactor materials reduce greatly, especially when considering the temperature gradients through the tube wall at heat fluxes sufficiently high to permit a compact design.150 This results in a very challenging trade-off between residence time, tube-wall stress, and outer-to-inner tube-wall temperature difference.151 Further challenges arises for directly irradiated reactor tubes, as in the solar-thermal integrated process (Section 3), due to asymmetric heating of the tubes, causing additional bending stresses that ultimately limit the heat flux and increase the necessary size of the reactor.152 Detailed creep-fatigue analysis of reactor tubes153 has so far not been reported, and the selection of sufficiently strong and corrosion-resistant materials remains a key research question for SCWG.154

2.7 System integration for SCWG algae-to-fuel conversion
The previous section described biofuel production through the supercritical water gasification process as applied to algae. A key aspect of the SCWG process energy balance is the endothermic energy required for carrying out, firstly, the gasification reaction and, secondly, the reforming process to convert the SCWG reaction production into syngas or hydrogen, which can be converted further downstream into either electricity and/or liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel, ammonia, methylcyclo-hexane (MCH) and methanol. Hence, the full-system integration, from algae production up to the final fuel production step, becomes an important engineering challenge.
Several studies have focussed on this system-level design of a SCWG process using algal biomass, Chlorella vulgaris,155,156 seaweed Fucus sp.157,158 and Spirulina sp.159 with the aim of exergy optimisation and process integration. However, in the majority of these, hydrogen and/or electricity were the final product. One study considered SCWG coupled with syngas chemical looping and combined-cycle power generation, and indicated promising values for total efficiency, hydrogen production efficiency, and power generation efficiency at 71.71%, 57.25%, and 14.46% respectively.158 Similarly, Nurdiawati et al.160 proposed a configuration for hydrogen production from SCWG of microalgae integrated with a syngas chemical looping process, wherein methylcyclohexane (MCH) was used as a downstream hydrogen carrier, and reported a high overall energy efficiency (40–50%). In systems optimised for power generation only, Aziz157,159 was able to achieve an efficiency between 40–60% through a combined-cycle power generation system, by optimising to minimise exergy destruction. A similar approach by Ganany et al.161,162 while integrating a supercritical steam-Rankine cycle and fuel cell with the SCWG gasification process led to a total energy conversion efficiency (electricity equivalent output per heat-equivalent input) of >50%. The different configurations are optimised for different products downstream of SCWG-reactor—hydrogen, syngas and/or electricity. The cost of subsystems, such as algae production, syngas chemical looping, or syngas reforming, or the choice of power block (Rankine, Brayton or combined-cycle), can lead to vastly different system dynamics, sizes of sub-systems and costs, a fact that is also exemplified by recent work from Rahbari et al.163 (discussed in detail in Section 3.2.1). Farobie et al.,164 in a review focussed on SCWG of microalgae for hydrogen production, emphasised the importance of heat recovery in SCWG systems to avoid excessive produce cost, and pointed out that heat exchangers with a too-low heating rate are susceptible to increased tar and char formation, which imposes an important additional constraint.
In energy economics, the energy return on fossil energy invested (EROEI) has been suggested as a qualitative metric to assess the feasibility of any fuel production process. When the EROEI of a resource is less than or equal to one, that energy source becomes a net “energy sink”, hence, any process which produces fuel/electricity using algae with EROEI of <1, would be infeasible. Strictly speaking, EROEI does not take into account any economic factors, hence may not be a very good metric to assess value-added products like diesel (for instance, given the same energy content, diesel sells for a premium compared to electricity). Nevertheless, EROEI can provide useful insight while qualitatively comparing different conversion techniques. In the work of Brandenberger et al.37 discussed earlier, the endothermic energy for SCWG was provided by the combustion of a part of the product gas (as shown in Fig. 15). Under this approach, the energy return on energy invested (EROEI), defined as the ratio of usable acquired energy to the total energy expended, was found to be 1.8 for the base case. The authors also found that cost of the SCWG plant contributes to only 3.7% of production costs in the base scenario, which seems quite low for such a high-temperature and pressure chemical plant. It should be noted that, despite algae production cost contributing a huge share in the final product cost, a part of the synthetic natural gas (SNG) was used to power the SCWG process.
 Fig. 15  Process flow diagram of an algae to synthetic natural gas plant having nutrient recycling and catalytic SCWG. A part of the methane from the product stream is used for firing the catalytic reactor, as marked in the figure. Figure reproduced from Brandenberger et al.37 

Fig. 16 illustrates the energy balance and EROEI for different product pathways from algae cultivated in raceway ponds.38 The total EROEI is only higher than 1 for the case when algae is cultivated in open ponds and gasified through the SCWG process with methane as the final product. It should be noted that for the SCWG-biodiesel pathway, the authors had assumed 700 °C reaction temperature and only 2 wt% algae concentration in feedstock (vis-á-vis 20% total solids in other pathways including SCWG-methane). This was presumably done to shift the reaction equilibrium towards direct syngas (CO + H2) from the SCWG reactor for direct feed into the FT process. However, this leads to a large amount of energy being used to heat up the high water content in the reaction media. An alternative approach would be to use higher concentration of algae in the SCWG-reactor followed by an additional reforming reactor before FT-synthesis, as presented in Rahbari et al.,165 and discussed in detail in Section 3.

An economic analysis of different algae-to-fuel conversion pathways has been presented by Orosz and Forney.166Fig. 17 illustrates the cost of energy and time to market (purely speculative based only on the maturity of each technology) for various energy conversion route using algae. The land requirement for each technology is shown by the area of the circles allocated for each process. The land requirement is quite high in all the routes primarily due to the size of algae farms required. As seen in the figure, gasification is not yet commercially viable because of its high cost; however, high temperature gasification is attractive due to several reasons: green technology, good degree of control, carbon capture utilisation and storage, feedstock flexibility, product flexibility and high efficiency. Among the different gasification processes, SCWG takes advantage of no drying cost and several other reasons as outlined in this section. The comparison of SCWG with conventional gasification has also been reported by Kumar et al.167 in their recent detailed techno-economic assessment (4.59 cf. 5.66 $ per kg of H2 for SCWG compared to conventional gasification). However, both technologies are highly sensitive to algae feedstock costs.
 Fig. 17  Comparison of the cost of energy and time to market for various algae conversion pathways Orosz and Forney.166 The area of each circle signifies the land requirement for each technology. 
A recent review on the techno-economic assessment of the SCWG process for combustible gas production suggests that hydrogen production from SCWG of cheap biomass feedstock may eventually become competitive with other H2-production routes.168 However, the processes based on cheap biomass from agricultural waste, sewage sludge, industrial by-products etc. are not scalable enough to become a primary source of synthetic fuel production. Algal biomass, on the other hand, is not cheap but highly scalable. A common consensus from the aforementioned studies seems to be the high cost of algae production and high endothermic energy requirement for the SCWG reaction. Therefore, the anticipated system configurations and cost outlook, with algae as a feedstock, is going to be different. For an expensive farmed biomass, like algae, a system that eliminates the need to burn some of the reactant or product-gas (for instance, SNG in Brandenberger et al.37) in order to drive the SCWG process, will greatly aid the process economics. In the next section, we will aim to provide a motivation for a renewable energy input (such as concentrating solar thermal) in the SCWG process and review the relevant literature in solar thermochemistry and solar-SCWG.
3 Solar SCWG algae-to-fuel systems
Solar-driven SCWG of algae is appealing because of the potential to replace a fraction of the algae, which in the non-solar case acts in part as a relatively expensive heat source.

Fig. 18 presents the cost of the various potential energetic inputs to a biofuel process, in terms for cost per unit of exergy supplied. Included are the cost of CST and algae,||169,170 ‘green’ H2 obtained from proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis powered by renewable electricity, ‘grey’ H2 obtained from SMR of natural gas,172 and ‘green’ H2 derived via SCWG of various (cheap) biomass feedstocks.168 The exergy cost of natural gas is included for reference.**173 The exergy-to-energy ratio of the feedstocks is derived from Song et al.174 CST is the cheapest renewable exergy source of those compared, and although more expensive than the two non-renewable options, has near-zero CO2 emissions. The integration of CST in the production of fuels via SCWG of algae is therefore clearly attractive, and offers a potential pathway for lowering the cost of algal biofuels.

While in-depth analysis of the subsystems and steady-state modelling of non-solar SCWG are reasonably well understood, little emphasis has been placed on fully-integrated SCWG-liquid fuel systems with a variable heat source such as CST. There are many important challenges arising from this heat integration, not least being the dynamics arising from the use of highly variable renewable energy input – the sun. Hence, the system design, storage options and renewable energy integration need to be assessed before the above exergy-cost benefits can be realised for solar integration. The following subsections provide a brief overview of concentrating solar thermal technology with emphasis on solar thermochemistry, and relevant literature pertaining to solar-SCWG process. The challenges in solar-integration with SCWG, especially managing the solar transient, and finally, the outlook for solar-SCWG-based fuel production is discussed.
3.1 Concentrating solar thermal technologies
CST is unique amongst renewable energy technologies in that its primary output is high-temperature heat.176,177 It consists of systems of mirrors to concentrate solar heat upon a small ‘receiver’ area (see Fig. 19), in order to achieve high temperatures in a working fluid, which can then be stored, then subsequently transferred to drive a turbine for electricity or used to supply heat for an industrial or other process. With a total global deployment now around 6 GW (electric), the dominant technologies have so far been parabolic troughs, which typically heat mineral oil to a temperature of ∼400 °C, and central tower systems, which focus light from a field of ‘heliostat’ mirrors to produce typically superheated steam or molten nitrate salt at temperatures of ∼560 °C. With a lesser degree of commercial success, dish-Stirling systems have demonstrated working fluid temperatures of over 700 °C, linear Fresnel systems have reached temperatures over 500 °C.
 Fig. 19  Typical CST technologies: parabolic trough, central tower, linear Fresnel, and parabolic dish. Figure redrawn from Fuqiang et al.178 
Next-generation or ‘Gen 3’ central tower technologies currently at the research stage have been developed to heat supercritical CO2, particles or high-temperature chloride salts at temperatures of 700 °C and higher.179,180
There are several efforts underway to push CST to even higher temperatures181—including that by Synhelion with recent testing of a thermal-re-emission-gas-absorption receiver concept at 1550 °C, HelioHeat with a rotary particle receiver targeting 1000 °C, and Heliogen with a high-accuracy solar field also targeting ∼1000 °C temperatures. Although none of these concepts has reached commercial deployment, they are developed for applications in high-temperature industrial processing beyond electricity generation. The technical challenges associated with high temperatures include material degradation, increased thermal losses from the receiver, and higher required optical accuracy in the solar concentrator.††
A techno-economic analysis of optimised central tower systems found that a lowest-cost temperature for the collection of exergy with polar heliostat fields was ∼620 °C.182 Least-cost CST systems at higher temperatures are more costly, because of elevated thermal (primarily radiative) losses, which drive the optimal configuration towards lower optical efficiency and larger total collector areas.
A critical element of CST systems is energy storage. The dominant commercial storage technology uses hot (565 °C) and cold (290 °C) tanks between which is pumped a molten mixture of NaNO3 and KNO3. Electricity strategically dispatched from storage has significantly higher value in the market than un-stored solar electricity, such as from photovoltaic panels. Furthermore, when a system is optimally configured, storage can be used to increase the uptime of the steam turbine power block (referred to as the ‘capacity factor’), with a resulting reduction in the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) supplied. This benefit can also be applied to systems where CST is used as a heat source. Typically, least-cost CST systems have of the order of 12 hours of thermal storage, and a solar multiple (the ratio of the design-point solar collector thermal output to the power-bloc thermal input) of ∼3.
Challenges for the large-scale market uptake of CST include, first of all, cost reduction, especially in the collector, receiver and thermal energy storage. Current LCOEs are of the order of 120 USD per MWhe (electric), while future ‘Gen 3’ concepts, mentioned above, may reach LCOEs of 60 USD per MWhe. This transition depends in part on moving from Rankine cycle to next-generation supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle turbines, which offer higher efficiencies and enable smaller (possibly modular) systems. Other key challenges for lower-cost CST are around materials selection and component lifetimes, notably issues of creep-fatigue (similar to the issues discussed in Section 2.6.3), due to the highly dynamic conditions that CST systems must operated under.
3.2 Solar thermochemistry
Beyond electricity production, CST has been investigated for heat provision to endothermic processes spanning fuel production, reduction of metallic ores, and cement production. Of relevance to solar algal biofuels is the family of solar thermochemical processes for production of synthesis gas (syngas, a mixtures of CO and H2), shown in Fig. 20. The five thermochemical pathways, all endothermic, are grouped into H2O/CO2 splitting and processing of carbonaceous materials.‡‡
 Fig. 20  Thermochemical routes for solar-syngas production using concentrated solar radiation as the driving heat source. Figure redrawn from Romero and Steinfeld.185 
The first group makes use of H2O and CO2 to produce H2 and CO via thermolysis or thermochemical cycles. This group of process represents a longer-term approach for solar fuel production.183 Thermolysis, the single-step thermal decomposition of H2O or CO2, requires temperatures above 2500 K. The significant challenges of materials constraints and separation of H2 and O2 or CO and O2, to prevent recombination and explosive mixtures, not yet been overcome.184 Meanwhile, the idea of thermochemical cycles, specifically two-step redox cycles, has been proposed.183,185,186 The first reactor is an endothermic reduction reactor for converting the metal oxide to either a pure metal or a lower oxidation state, whereas the second reactor is used for oxidising the product from first reactor with either H2O or CO2, thus producing H2 or CO respectively. These processes are relatively lower temperature compared to direct thermolysis, and avoid the gas separation issues,183 but ongoing research is required to increase efficiency and decrease the cost.185,186
The second group makes use of carbonaceous materials to produce syngas via cracking, reforming and gasification routes, representing a more near-term solution for solar process implementation.183 The solar cracking process produces solid carbon and hydrogen, while reforming and gasification processes produce syngas. Because of their relevance to the processing of algae, a detailed discussion on solar gasification and reforming pathways are provided in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
The thermochemical processes for solar syngas production can either be performed in on-sun solar receivers/reactors or off-sun reactors using an intermediate heat transfer fluid. The design of reliable and scalable solar reactors for thermochemical pathways is considered one of the main challenges in improving the process efficiency. Solar receiver/reactors can be broadly categorised into directly- and indirectly-irradiated configurations.187,188 Although directly-irradiated reactors exhibit more efficient heat transfer, most concepts to date have required a transparent window to admit the concentrated solar radiation and contain the (normally gas or gas-and-solid) reactants, which is problematic at large scale, at high pressure, or in cases where tars, particles and/or ash attach to the surface of the window.189 On the other hand, indirectly-irradiated reactors remove the need for a transparent window, which comes at the expense of a less favourable heat transfer rate. The disadvantages are linked to the limitations imposed by the materials of construction of the absorber such as the maximum operating temperature, thermal conductivity, radiative absorptance, inertness to the chemical reaction, and resistance to thermal shocks.190
On the basis their flow characteristics, the solar reactors can be classified into packed-bed, entrained flow or fluidised bed. Although packed-bed reactors offer immense potential in terms of simple design, flexibility with the size of feedstock and being cost-effective, the main limitations are the rates of heat and mass transfer through the porous structure, ash-buildup and energy losses. In contrast, entrained flow reactors exhibit more efficient transport, but require strict control on the feedstock size.191 In contrast, the fluidised bed reactors exhibit higher heat- and mass-transfer rates as compared to packed-bed and entrained-flow gasifiers with a better compatibility for large-scale implementation.192 However, fluidisation implies some additional energy for pumping of the fluidisation gas.193

3.2.1 Solar gasification. 
One of the most suitable routes for solar-driven thermochemical syngas production is gasification.194 Gasification is the partial oxidation of carbonaceous feedstock at high temperatures, and conventionally requires preparatory drying and pyrolysis of the feedstock.20,21 Conventional gasification is carried out using oxygen or air at near-ambient pressures and at temperatures of ∼800 °C to ∼1500 °C195 (although steam is also used196,197), and has been commonly been applied for syngas production from coal and biomass. Conventional gasification can be augmented with concentrated solar thermal energy as the driving heat source, bringing the following potential benefits:198
• Higher yield of syngas per unit of feedstock because the required heat duty of the process is provided from solar energy rather than feedstock combustion,
• The elimination of any local pollution effects arising from combustion by-products,
• Reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions per syngas delivered, and
• Providing a means to readily store intermittent solar energy in the chemical form.
There have been several solar-thermal gasification reactors conceptualised in the literature including directly-irradiated192,199,200 and indirectly-irradiated193,201,202 configurations.
Appealing aspects of solarised conventional gasification are that it can be run at near-ambient pressures and potentially with high efficiency. However, the temperatures required are at the extreme upper end of what is likely to be achievable in large-scale CST systems.182 Further challenges include the selection of suitable high-temperature solar reactor materials, reactor scale-up, the catalysts that could lower the reactor operating temperature and improve reaction kinetics, and dealing with the losses and reactor damage associated with highly dynamic operation of on-sun reactors. On-sun solar reactor design is currently a very actively pursued area of research.


3.2.2 Solar reforming. 
Reforming is a vital thermochemical pathway to convert the methane (CH4)-rich gas into syngas. It typically occurs at a high temperature of 850 °C to 950 °C, and depending on the catalyst, can be carried out using steam, oxygen or CO2. Steam methane reforming (SMR, or ‘conventional’ reforming), autothermal reforming (ATR), dry reforming (DR) and partial oxidation (PO) are the most investigated reforming alternatives in literature.
An alternative method to conventional reforming, where the heat of reaction is supplied by burning a fraction of the feedstock methane, is to use the concentrated solar thermal heat.203–207 Approximately, 25% less feedstock is then required.203 Solar reformers can be categorised into indirectly-heated, tubular, and windowed/volumetric configurations.208 The high temperatures needed for solar reforming limit the concentrator options to central receivers and solar dishes. An alternative solar reforming pathway using palladium membrane reactors coupled with lower temperature (<600 °C) collectors has been investigated, which would then be compatible with a conventional molten salt (e.g. solar salt, 60% NaNO3 and 40% KNO3) thermal energy storage, and may offer eventual benefits if the membrane cost and stability issues are resolved.208 Several pilot-scale demonstrations of solar reforming reactors have been reported in the literature.208,209 The technical challenges associated with solar reforming include coke formation, catalyst deactivation, high-temperature heat transfer issues and diffusion limitations.

3.3 Solar SCWG reactor design
As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, several solar-thermal gasification reactors have been conceptualised for conventional gasification of carbonaceous materials such as directly-irradiated vortex flow, indirectly-irradiated entrained particle flow, directly-irradiated fluidized beds and indirectly-irradiated packed beds. Out of these, only the indirectly-irradiated tubular reactors will be of relevance to SCWG. A cavity-reactor implementing the CST-driven SCWG for hydrogen production was developed at Xi'an Jiaotong University.210–213 This reactor is a “snake-like” tubular reactor inside a cavity receiver as shown in Fig. 21. A secondary concentrator increases the concentration ratio and decreases the aperture size. The reactor is composed of two zones: (1) a preheater section in which the pressurised water is preheated to the supercritical temperatures and (2) a reaction section in which the feedstock is gasified. Using this methodology, the heating rate of feedstock is considerably increased and uniform heat flux is attained in the reactor section, which results in higher gasification efficiency. Although reactor design is an important aspect to assist the technical feasibility of solarised SCWG concept, a detailed modelling and optimisation of such experimental designs is desirable.§§
 Fig. 21  Schematic of a cavity receiver with tubular reactor for SCWG, designed at Xi'an Jiaotong University.210–212 Figure reproduced from Chen et al.212 
Modelling of solar-SCWG reactors is at a nascent stage. The concentrated solar fluidised bed concept has only been looked at from direct-irradiation point of view, which is not quite suitable for supercritical water gasification.98,215,216 Although proof of concept for the possibility of performing supercritical gasification in a fluidised bed reactor exists,217,218 integration with concentrated solar is a non-trivial challenge, especially when it comes to efficient heat transfer into the fluidised medium.212 Only a few studies have modelled a rather simplistic implementation of tubular plug flow reactor for solar-driven SCWG.151,219 The model presented by Watson et al.219 is based on a one-dimensional pseudo steady-state plug-flow reactor. Although this is a good first step in understanding the complex system, this model lacks the required sophistication. Venkataraman et al.151,152 presented a more detailed one-dimensional steady state model for a solar reactor at 20 MWth scale. However, the model lacked data on kinetics of algae gasification and assumed a uniform flux distribution in the cavity receiver. The external convective losses were based on empirical correlations rather than computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Nevertheless, the limitation of current metallic alloys in terms of mechanical stresses in irradiated tubes in a solar-SCWG cavity receiver was highlighted as a key concern, which has not been addressed so far in the literature. A key aspect of solar-SCWG in contrast to non-solar SCWG is the fact that heat transfer into reactor tubes is likely to be one-sided, as a result of tube irradiation, and with a desire for high flux levels in order to limit external radiative and convective losses. Variability in flux levels due to cloud and sun-movement transients will also further impact the reactor conditions. To what extent these factors alter the reaction kinetics and product distribution has not yet received significant attention.
During a continuous flow solar gasification process, the chemical species composition and their physical properties vary with time as the reaction progresses. Thus, modelling such a process would involve solving the unsteady mass and energy conservation equations for a two-phase reacting media. The conductive, convective and radiative heat transfer is coupled to the reaction kinetics. Hence, the governing equations must be solved simultaneously. Piatkowski et al.193 and Z'Graggen and Steinfeld220,221 have explained the steps required for modelling a conventional gasification reactors. A similar algorithm can be used for modelling supercritical water reactor, noting that care should be taken while solving the phase equilibrium and equation of state under supercritical conditions:
• Monte Carlo and radiosity methods to determine the flux distribution within the cavity.
• Coupling the flux distribution to conductive heat transfer through the reactor tube.
• Convective and radiative heat transfer to the mixed supercritical phase while simultaneously accounting for the reaction kinetics.
• The effect of variation in concentration of different species, due to the gasification reaction, on thermal and transport properties should be accounted for as well.
A possible bottleneck in on-sun solar-SCWG reactor sizing is whether the production of algae in non-arable land aligns seasonally with the solar resource. In a recent work by Rahbari et al.,175 the authors showed that the SCWG-reactor sized for peak annual algae production rates matches well with the periods of low feedstock production as well, without a need for a long-term storage. This can be attributed to the fact that the lower solar insolation periods in winters coincide with the lower algae production rates. A short-term storage of algae for catering to the daily mismatch between algae and solar resources is enough to facilitate a balance between the supply and demand. It should be noted that the seasonality of the algae production is still relatively less understood and warrants further research.
3.4 Gasification product reforming and syngas conditioning
The products of SCWG contain a significant amount of CH4—depending on algae concentration, operating temperature, type of algae, and type of catalyst (see Fig. 8–11)—that can be converted into syngas in a reforming reactor. SMR, ATR, and PO/DR are the most commonly used techniques for this purpose. There are two scenarios to obtain the FT-synthesis-compatible H2:CO ratio of 2.1 or methanol-synthesis-compatible H2:CO/CO2 ratio of 2–2.1: (i) discarding a fraction of the carbon in the form of CO2 from algae, and (ii) supplying the make-up H2 from an external renewable source.
In a previous work, Rahbari et al.169 investigated the energy and exergy analysis performance of a pseudo-steady state algae-to-syngas production system considering different reforming options (i.e. SCWG-SMR, SCWG-ATR and SCWG-PO/DR). Supplementary renewable-hydrogen supply from photovoltaics-powered water electrolysers unit adjusted the H2:CO ratio for the downstream applications. The main objective of this research was a detailed modelling of each sub-components in the syngas production subsystem, a pinch analysis-based heat exchanger network optimisation, and a full sensitivity analysis over the process parameters affecting the exergy efficiency to obtain the optimum design point for the entire flow diagram. The authors concluded that there was a large variation in the amount of renewable-derived supplemental H2 required to restore the syngas composition while integrating different reforming routes.
Building upon this model, Rahbari et al.175,222 compared the techno-economic performance of solar-gasified FT fuels using two scenarios to balance the H2:CO ratio: CO2 dumping and (ii) H2 addition. The preferred process design choice was influenced by the H2 price from a techno-economic standpoint. At present cost of renewable H2, the SMR-dumping scenario with the LCOF (levelised cost of fuel) of 3.5 AUD per L was the economically feasible route. However, the sensitivity of plant LCOF to H2 price indicated that the optimal configuration shifted to SMR-H2 scenario at the H2 price below 5.6 AUD per kg and PO/DR at H2 cost of 2.1 AUD per kg. In another research by the co-authors, Rahbari et al.165 evaluated the steady-state operation and techno-economic performance of algae-to-liquid fuel production through solar-SCWG-SMR process. An alternative configuration based on dumping CO2 from the system instead of adding make-up H2—to achieve the required H2:CO ratio for the downstream unit—was studied in this research. The minimum levelised cost of fuel (LCOF) obtained from the techno-economic assessment was 3.2 AUD per L. In a recent paper by Rahbari et al.,223 the authors assessed the choice of methanol for downstream fuel synthesis due to its faster ramping and overall increased output compared to Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. They found the minimum LCOF of ∼1.6 AUD per L in case of SMR-dumping scenario. Upscaling the field size up to 700 MWth reduced the LCOF by 20% relative to the baseline 50 MWth scale, beyond which optical losses outweighed scaling benefits.
Using a similar system configuration for algae-to-syngas production via SCWG, as studied by Rahbari et al.,165,169 Onigbajumo et al.224 focused on alternative energy integration—including solar tower, electrical energy and natural gas (NG)—to power the endothermic reactions in SCWG and SMR reactors. They also evaluated the choice of integrating a low-temperature parabolic trough collector (PTC) to drive some of the energy requirement of the SCWG process through preheating the microalgae slurry feed up to 450 °C prior entering the SCWG reactor. The renewable H2 from PV-electrolysis was used to condition the syngas for the downstream FT unit. The authors did not include the FT fuel plant as compared to Rahbari et al.165,175,222 The NG-driven SCWG-SMR plant without PTC preheating unit resulted in the MFSP (minimum fuel selling price) of 51.95 AUD per GJ. The NG combined with PTC configuration achieved a slightly higher MFSP of 54.01 AUD per GJ. The integration of solar tower with SCWG-SMR reactors increased the MFSP to 73.09 AUD per GJ. The steady-state model neglects some of the aspects of a real-world plant integration such as storage dispatch dynamics, component-based operating control states and ramping phases (see Section 3.5).
An important consideration for algae-based solar-fuel production is to mitigate the influence of fluctuations in solar-syngas supply—as a result of solar variability—on the downstream applications. The choice between, and relative sizing of, short-term heat or syngas storage, or long-term algae storage, present interesting design challenges in solar thermal integration. These will be discussed subsequently.
3.5 Managing solar transients
The integration of liquid fuel synthesis via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol synthesis or other pathways imposes important constraints on the design of the solar gasification components, owing to the challenges of solar resource variability.225 Hinkley et al.226 provide a discussion on the challenges of integrating solar syngas processes with downstream liquid fuel production. More specifically in case of current status FT slurry bubble column reactors, the major constraint is the strong preference for steady-state operation of this unit, which take days or weeks to achieve steady state. This is a poor match with CST, which has daily/hourly variability due to the day/night cycle as well as clouds and wind. In this case, one solution is potentially the use of microchannel reactors now under development, which, it is believed, should be able to establish steady-state operation with desired products far more quickly.227
Either hybridised energy sources or large amounts of syngas storage is needed for realistic stable operation of the downstream fuel plant. It is quite intuitive that hybridisation of solar gasification process comes at the expense of reduced syngas yield and efficiency, although it offers a means to reduce the intermittency of syngas production.225,228 In other words, the higher the degree of fossil-hybridisation, the lower the amount of syngas storage required for continuous operation of the downstream fuel production. Hathaway et al.228 studied the impact of a mix of thermal storage, syngas storage and hybridisation on the overall performance of a 100 MWth central tower based solar biomass gasification followed by downstream FT-synthesis. Unsurprisingly, the overall thermal efficiency of the plant decreased as the degree of hybridisation was increased. Interestingly though, high solar fractions and a low nominal syngas production set point resulted in peak syngas production rates significantly higher than the nominal syngas yield rate. Kaniyal et al.229,230 made a system-level evaluation of hybridised systems with an objective of minimising the CO2-emissions for liquid fuel production. They examined a range of coal/NG/biomass blends in conjunction with heat from CST, and achieved a ∼20% improvement in the system energy efficiency and a 30% reduction in mine-to-tank CO2-emissions.
Another solution is to integrate relatively large amounts of syngas storage into the solar-fuels process chain, downstream of the on-sun gasification step to achieve a 100% renewable (e.g. solar-only) synthetic liquid fuel production. Kaniyal et al.231 evaluated the dynamic performance of a fully solar-powered coal gasification system coupled with a downstream FT synthesis, aiming to achieve a continuous operation of the downstream plant with no unscheduled shut-downs, through the use of large-scale syngas storage. The minimum required storage capacity was found to be 64 days. The authors found that increasing the solar field design power by 50% led to almost halving the syngas storage capacity required to meet the no-shut-down criterion. There was no analysis of the cost of the large storage requirements for these systems. In a recent study, Shirazi et al.170 provided an insight into a system-level dynamic simulation and techno-economic optimisation of the biofuel production through solar-driven SCWG-SMR with CO2 dumping scenario. A comprehensive component-wise control algorithm was adapted to monitor the ongoing performance of the system and alleviate the effect of solar variability. The dynamic model took into account time-dependent optical losses, startup/transitioning/shutdown losses and a 24 hour-beforehand weather forecast-based scheduler. A genetic-algorithm-based optimisation technique was employed to minimise the LCOF, assuming syngas storage capacity and solar multiple as design variables. The use of predictive dispatch scheduling technique increased the total duration of productive operation of the FT plant by ∼25%, resulting in ∼19% reduction in the plant LCOF compared to a case of continuous dispatch without forecasting. The results of sensitivity analysis over the FT ramping time indicated that a more advanced concept such as microchannel FT reactors seemed to be a suitable alternative for solar fuel plants compared to conventional slurry bubble column reactors.
Recent research efforts on the topic of hydrogen for energy applications have highlighted the potential for large underground caverns, either dissolved from halite salt deposits or excavated from rock, for hydrogen storage. These caverns provide a very low cost-per-energy, but at least for electricity storage, have a high cost-per-power due to the cost of electrolysers and fuel cell equipment. However, in the present context of solar-SCWG fuel production, these caverns, which would be equally applicable for syngas storage but without the need for the high cost-per-power components, may present a pathway to significantly higher capacity factors and hence lower overall fuel costs than have previously been considered feasible.232,233 Halite deposits have been identified in suitable arid high-solar regions in the United States, Australia and elsewhere and could be co-located with algae production and CST installations.234,235
Another option for managing solar transients is to store heat instead of syngas, which has other benefits in resolving some of the materials limitations experienced in the on-sun SCWG reactor.151,152 This configuration for solar-SCWG, relatively unexplored in the literature, is to use an off-sun SCWG reactor downstream of a high-temperature molten salt storage. In this concept, heat in the form of hot molten salt would be transferred from a receiver, via two-tank storage, to a shell-and-tube style reactor. Such a concept was proposed by Xiao et al.,236 and accompanied by experimental testing of a tube-in-tube reactor with molten salt in the outer annulus. Indirect (off-sun) SCWG results in lower thermal stresses experienced by the reactor tubes, but likely requires innovation to supply higher-temperature stored heat at ∼600 °C. Current commercial molten salt storage systems using nitrate salts are limited to 565 °C due to decomposition of the nitrate and release of NOx gas. Recent work suggests this temperature limit could soon be overcome, either through sealed systems with gas blanketing237 or using next-generation storage concepts built around chloride salts¶¶ or solid particles.179,180
3.6 Outlook
Reviewing the papers published by Rahbari et al.165,175,222,223 suggests that the LCOF of algal biofuel production through solar-SCWG-reforming process is still ∼3–4 times more expensive than that of the fossil-based alternatives. The high cost of algae and renewable H2 contributes to a large fraction of plant LCOF, posing a risk in the commercialisation of algae-fed solar-SCWG-reforming integrated with downstream FT and methanol synthesis routes. On-going work into cost reduction of algae and hydrogen production is essential to make solar-SCWG based carbon-neutral biofuels competitive with petroleum-based fuels.
4 Conclusions
Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of algae coupled with more mature technologies such as the Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis, provides an approach for fossil-free production of liquid fuels, and was the focus of this review.
Algae, as feedstocks for fuel production, are not seasonal crops, have high growth rate and can be cultivated in open raceway points on arid land where there is no competition from agriculture or infrastructure. Pumping and dewatering are significant costs. Algae can potentially be cultivated and centrifuged for ∼500 USD per tonne, although commercial production is still limited to smaller scales.
Amongst the fuel conversion processes for algae, SCWG is promising due to the low char/tar rates, fast kinetics, and high carbon conversion efficiency. The ash content of algae can however range from 5% up to 25% or more, which needs to be managed to minimise corrosion and reactor plugging. The key challenges for scale-up and commercialisation of fuel production using SCWG of algae include corrosion and tube strength, minimising char/tar formation, avoiding blockage due to ash, and minimising the costs of the required feedstocks.
SCWG is well understood thermodynamically. Supercritical water becomes a non-polar solvent, and highly effective at rapidly breaking down a wide range of organic materials. The products of SCWG have been found to be adequately predicted using Gibbs energy minimisation models in combination with cubic equations of state and van der Waals mixing rules. The complexity and compositional variability of algae, meanwhile, make kinetic modelling of SCWG of algae extremely challenging. Kinetic models of similar biomass materials have been developed using monomers or model compounds, a lumped intermediate approach and a modified random pore model, with good success. Only the lumped intermediate method has been specifically applied to SCWG of algae.
Proof-of concept demonstration of catalytic and non-catalytic algae-fed SCWG have been established over the wide range of operating temperatures and pressures, algae concentrations, and types of catalyst. Many experiments have shown a carbon gasification efficiency of above 80%, with some studies reaching 100%, depending on reactor conditions, catalyst, and reactor and algae type. Both batch and continuous reactors have been demonstrated, although most studies have been with batch reactors.
Water under slightly supercritical conditions experiences a significant drop in the ionic product, which is responsible for its effectiveness as an organic solvent, but also reduces the solubility of inorganic materials. This presents challenges for preheating components in SCWG processes. Corrosion arising from low concentrations of halide ions are a major challenge for SCWG, having been observed to cause significant pitting and stress corrosion cracking in alloys such as Inconel 625 and Hastelloy C276, which are otherwise attractive for their strength at high temperatures. Especially if marine microalgae are to be successfully used as SCWG feedstock, these corrosion issues will need to overcome.
Because of the relatively high cost of algae production, studies focussing on integrated system design for SCWG of algae have emphasised the importance of heat recovery to minimise total energy input. They suggest that up to 50% efficient conversion of biomass into fuel can be achieved. SCWG of algae grown in raceway points was found to have an overall positive energy return on energy investment (EROEI) when considering the full production chain, although the value of liquid fuels due to their portability presents an important aspect beyond what EROEI can capture.
Solar-thermal integration with the SCWG process could be highly beneficial in improving the efficiency and reducing the fuel cost. Of the non-fossil heat (exergy) sources, concentrating solar power is significantly cheaper, and motivates the consideration of solar-driven SCWG processes. However, only a few studies have investigated detailed on-sun reactor design or sought to examine the materials challenges. On-sun SCWG reactors will face challenging conditions for creep-fatigue in addition to the usual corrosion issues, due to solar variability. Switching to an off-sun SCWG reactor, downstream of a thermal storage, has been suggested to allow more stable operation and with higher capacity factor. The storage required for truly continuous solar-SCWG operation (highly preferable for Fischer–Tropsch or methanol synthesis) has been shown to be infeasible, so some degree of variability will have to be tolerated. In such a scenario, it is crucial to determine the startup and shutdown losses for the H2, algae, SCWG and downstream fuel-synthesis units, as well as to understand the interplay between H2, algae and syngas storage dynamics, and to develop the necessary control strategies. With the emergence of low-cost ‘green’ hydrogen, significant changes to a solar SCWG process configuration can be anticipated.
Overall, SCWG is appealing as a potentially highly efficient and scalable source of fossil-free carbonaceous feedstock for liquid fuel production. The research highlighted in this review demonstrates significant advances in the understanding of SCWG chemistry, kinetics and associated materials constraints. Solar SCWG has been highlighted as a way to reduce the resulting fuel cost by incorporating a lower-cost source of driving heat input. Ongoing efforts should focus on addressing full-system integration and cost reduction, dynamics, and reactor lifetime to improve the technology's readiness level towards eventual commercial uptake.

Footnotes† Equally contributing authors.‡ In contrast to woody biomass, lignin is not a major component of algae, even if some ‘lignin-like’ components have been identified in primitive algae.29§ Defined by the authors71 as the fraction of the heat of combustion of the biomass which will be available in the product gas at atmospheric conditions.¶ Some large-scale activity appears to be in development currently. In Feb 2018, a 100m USD non-solar demonstration project was launched in China for a 50 MWth coal gasification system using SCWG to produce hydrogen. Results are awaited.100|| The total exergy input in the process from algae was 101.44 GWhex per annum, and from the sun (calculated using Petela equation171) was 86.99 GWhex per annum;169 amortised cost share in levelised cost of fuel (LCOF) for solar and algae were 4.36 and 10.13 MAUD per annum, respectively;170 hence, the exergy input cost from algae and solar are ∼99.82 AUD per MWhex and ∼50.12 AUD per MWhex, which translates to a ratio of 2:1.** Options involving carbon capture and sequestration are excluded from this analysis.†† These emerging high-temperature CST systems are relevant to SCWG because of the need for syngas reforming, as discussed in Section 3.2.2.‡‡ The relevance of these processes is that H2O/CO2 splitting must be understood as a competing pathway, where water or waste CO2 (from flue gases or direct air capture technology) are upgraded for carbon-neutral fuel production. Meanwhile, the carbonaceous pathways can be applied to the processing of biomass, avoiding the need to burn fuel to drive the transformation.§§ It is noted that subsequent work by XJTU resulted in building and testing of 1 tonne per h solar-SCWG prototype system in Ningxia province, at approximately the 1 MWth scale, however detailed results from this work appear not to have been reported.214¶¶ A significant challenge, and current topic of research, is the design of tanks that are able to resist the corrosive tendency of these salts in combination with high temperatures. Tanks with an internal ceramic liner are considered as a possible approach.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021
