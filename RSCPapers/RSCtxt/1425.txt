    , Accepted 13th December 2016First published on 14th December 2016AbstractAqueous dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are emerging as the first truly safe, cheap and eco-friendly photovoltaic technology, at the same time overcoming the well-known instability upon moisture/water contamination typical of many solar cells. While many aqueous DSSCs recently proposed still contain little amounts of organic solvents or petroleum-derived polymeric matrices, here we propose the first 100% hydrogel electrolyte, consisting of carboxymethylcellulose as a green jellifying agent, water and iodide/triiodide redox mediator. Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the resulting electrolytes and solar cells are thoroughly investigated, with a special focus on the long-term stability of the aqueous devices under different operating and aging conditions.

Introduction
About 25 years ago O′Regan and Grätzel developed the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which was the first photovoltaic device based on (photo)electrochemical reactions. The DSSC represented a sparkling revolution for the photovoltaic scientific community in terms of novel approaches for solar energy conversion.1–5 Extensive research and development work has been carried out in the last few decades,6–8 and DSSCs are now the best choice for high efficiency solar cells at low cost, having aesthetic features suitable for architectural integration and providing full performance even under low irradiance conditions and/or indoor environments.9–11
However, two main aspects have not yet been properly addressed so far, which is indeed rather surprising if one considers that the DSSC was originally conceived to be an eco-friendly bioinspired technology mimicking artificial photosynthesis.12–14 Firstly, the standard electrolyte system is based on volatile organic solvents, such as acetonitrile and methoxypropionitrile, being also flammable and toxic, which certainly affects safety requirements upon module/panel installation in real operating environments.15–17 Secondly, either solid or quasi-solid polymer electrolytes introduced so far for targeted stability enhancements are typically petroleum-derived,18–21 which in fact definitely clashes with the original green and sustainable address for the DSSC technology.
Recently green chemistry has contributed significantly to the step forward of DSSC systems into sustainability by developing devices operating in truly aqueous electrolyte environments.15,22 The use of water as the only solvent for the redox mediator would ensure the realization of safe, cheap and eco-friendly solar cells,23,24 at the same time overcoming the well-known instability of the DSSC upon moisture/water contamination.25,26 Aqueous DSSCs have recently scored an interesting 5.97% efficiency.27 Presently, research efforts are focused on developing new water-soluble redox mediators,28,29 improving the photoanode wettability,30 and synthesizing water-resistant organic sensitizers.31,32 Another fundamental step towards stability enhancement is represented by the replacement of the common liquid electrolytes by quasi-solid systems. To this purpose, different polymeric matrices (pure gelatin,33 acrylic acid/gelatin34 and xanthan gum35) are now investigated by several research groups to jellify the aqueous redox mediator. Unfortunately, the acrylic acid/gelatin-based electrolyte demonstrated rather limited stability of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) (20% loss in the first 2 h of cell operation),34 while the xanthan gum-solidified solution cannot be classified as a truly aqueous system as it contained 50% of methoxypropionitrile.35 To our knowledge, Spiccia's group proposed the best jellified system so far, where gelatin (with a 1 wt% addition of PEG-300) was used to prepare a quasi-solid electrolyte providing 4.1% PCE, stable (80%) after 35 days in the dark at room temperature.33 However, even if gelatin represents a suitable and sustainable matrix for aqueous DSSCs, being a polypeptide made by hydrolytic degradation of collagen, this electrolyte also contained polyethylene glycol (petroleum-derived), 1-methylimidazole (petroleum-derived, harmful and corrosive) and a heavy metal (cobalt) based redox couple.
Considering such a scenario, here we present the first example of truly petroleum-derived, toxic and/or heavy metal-based components free biopolymer electrolyte for aqueous DSSCs. In particular, we make use of the sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as a green jellifying agent for a 100% aqueous electrolyte based on the iodide/triiodide redox mediator. The effect of the CMC-based gel composition on the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of the resulting electrolytes and solar cells is thoroughly investigated, as well as the long-term stability of the aqueous devices under different operating and aging conditions. We demonstrate how this newly proposed electrolyte system, in conjunction with a metal-free sensitizer, easily leads to sustainable, stable, transparent and building-integrable solar cells, without suffering from any safety and/or toxicity issues.
Materials and methods
Materials
Sodium iodide (NaI), potassium iodide (KI), iodine (I2), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Mw = 250000 g mol−1), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), ethanol, acetone, t-butanol (t-BuOH) and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water (DI-H2O, 18 MΩ cm at 25 °C) was obtained with a Direct-Q 3 UV Water Purification System (Millipore).
The sensitizing dye 2-[{4-[4-(2,2-diphenylethenyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydrocyclopento[b]indole-7-yl}methylidene]-cyanoacetic acid (D131) was purchased from Inabata Europe S.A.
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (sheet resistance 7 Ω sq−1, purchased from Solaronix) were cut into 2 cm × 1.5 cm sheets and used as substrates for the fabrication of photoanodes and counter electrodes.
Electrolytes: preparation and characterization
The experimental work related to the proposed aqueous electrolyte can be summarized in three sections.
In the first one, gel electrolytes containing 0.50 M aqueous NaI and various weight percentages (3.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20) of CMC were prepared by weighing the polymer in a vial and adding dropwise the appropriate amount of the iodide stock solution (0.50 M NaI). Gel electrolytes were gently stirred overnight (18 h). In the case of the sample containing 20 wt% CMC, the gel was stirred in a warm bath setting the hot plate at 50 °C to get a homogeneous mixture.
The resulting gels were tested for their ionic conductivity (σ) in lab-scale cells (ECC-Std, EL-CELL GmbH) by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), using a potentiostat (PARSTAT 2273, Princeton Applied Research) in the range of frequencies between 10 kHz and 1 Hz. Gels were sandwiched between two stainless steel blocking electrodes separated by a 100 μm-thick spacer featuring a round shape (14 mm inner diameter). The amplitude of the AC signal was 10 mV. The reference electrode was short-circuited with the counter-electrode in all cases. The ionic conductivity was calculated according to: (1)where l stands for the cell thickness, A is the area of the electrode in contact with the gel electrolyte, and Rb is the bulk-resistance to ion diffusion. Rb was determined directly as the value on the Zre axes at Zim = 0 in the Nyquist plot. For ionic conductivity measurements at different temperatures, ECC-Std cells were placed in a climatic chamber (MK 53, BINDER GmbH). After proper cell equilibration at 70 °C, the temperature was decreased by 10 °C stepwise in the range from 70 to −25 °C. Each measurement was taken 1 h and 30 min after the chamber had reached the thermal equilibrium at the set temperature. The ionic conductivity of 0.50 M aqueous NaI was also measured for comparison.
In the second phase of the study, and for a more in depth investigation of both the electrolyte and the cathode/electrolyte interfaces, symmetrical (dummy) cells were assembled. Gel electrolyte containing 0.50 M aqueous NaI, 30 mM I2 and 10 wt% CMC (this value was chosen as the intermediate value within the investigated experimental domain) was prepared by weighing the polymer in a vial and adding dropwise the appropriate amount of the aqueous electrolyte solution. The gel electrolyte was gently stirred overnight (18 h) in a warm bath at 50 °C. The FTO-coated glass plates used for dummy cell assembly were platinized by using a sputter coater (Q180T ES by Quarum Technologies Ltd). A small amount of gel electrolyte was cast onto one platinized electrode using a spatula. The dummy cell was then assembled clamping the two electrodes separated by a spacer (with an internal round area of 0.785 cm2 and a 70 μm thickness).
In the final part of the work, the cellulosic matrix was also used to jellify solutions with the optimized I−/I3− content for aqueous DSSC application.36 In detail, both potassium- (5.5 M KI and 50 mM I2) and sodium-based (4.5 M NaI and 50 mM I2) solutions were used to prepare gel electrolytes. For the DSSC application, these quasi-solid electrolytes were obtained by weighing the redox mediator aqueous solution in a vial and adding the appropriate amount of biopolymer under gentle stirring. CMC was added in 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 wt%. After gelation, samples were left in a bath at 30–40 °C for 20 min to allow a proper homogenization. Besides DSSC fabrication, a dummy cell assembled as previously described was used to measure the diffusion limited current by steady state cyclic voltammetry. The gel electrolyte tested contained 5.5 M aqueous KI, 50 mM I2 and 6.5 wt% CMC. Its liquid counterpart was tested under the same conditions for comparison. The diffusion coefficient D of triiodide was calculated according to: (2)where d is the distance between the two electrodes, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrode reaction, F is the Faraday constant, ci is the initial concentration of I3− and Jlim is the diffusion-limited current density.48
All electrolyte samples and cells were freshly prepared before each single testing and each of the experiments was repeated at least three times.
DSSC devices: fabrication and characterization
FTO covered glasses were rinsed with acetone and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. Then, all traces of solvents were removed by using a compressed air gun. Front electrodes were prepared by depositing a single layer of porous TiO2 on top of conductive substrates using a screen printer equipped with a 43T mesh frame. After paste (18NR-T, Dyesol) deposition and 20 min rest to let the paste relax, the TiO2 layer was dried at 80 °C for 20 min and sintered increasing the temperature up to 480 °C in 45 min. The fabricated photoanodes (with a thickness of ≈6 μm and a covered area of 0.25 cm2) were finally activated by heating at 450 °C for 20 min. Dipping in D131 dye solution (0.50 mM dye, 0.90 mM CDCA in t-BuOH:ACN 1:1) was carried out at 22 °C for 5 h in the dark under shaking in a Buchi Syncore platform equipped with a cooling plate. After dye-loading, the photoanodes were washed in acetone to remove the residual dye not specifically adsorbed on the TiO2 layer. In regard to the preparation of the counter electrodes, FTO conductive glasses were platinized by spreading a H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in ethanol) on the plate surface and heating. A thermoplastic Surlyn frame (3–4 mm large and with an internal area of 0.8 cm × 0.8 cm) was used as a spacer. The amount of gel electrolyte required to fill a cell was determined assembling several trial cells. For each DSSC, a drop of gel electrolyte (5.4–5.6 mg) was cast onto the platinized counter-electrode by a spatula. The complete DSSC was then assembled by hot-pressing at 100 °C for 20 s. All DSSCs assembled in this phase were stored in the dark for six days. After this period, one cell for each electrolyte experimented was stored at 60 °C under dark conditions. I–V curves of these cells were periodically recorded right after the extraction from the oven and after 24 h of cooling at RT. The photovoltaic performances were evaluated recording three consecutive I–V curves using a Keithley 2420 Source Measure Unit. The cells were irradiated under simulated sun light at 1 sun (AM 1.5G) after calibration using a silicon diode.37–39
Results and discussion
Electrochemical characterisation of CMC as a jellifier for aqueous electrolytes
Here we attempt to exploit CMC, often cited as “cellulose gum”, as a green jellifying agent for aqueous DSSC electrolytes, ensuring quasi-solid-like features. In CMC the hydroxyl groups of the glucopyranose monomers of cellulose are bound with carboxymethyl groups; the functional properties of the resulting product depend on the degree of substitution of the initial cellulose structure (0.9 in the present study).
As a first experiment when proposing a novel macromolecular matrix for polymer electrolytes, we assessed whether CMC at Mw = 250000 g mol−1 could behave as a suitable jellifier for aqueous electrolytes. To this purpose, an aqueous solution containing 0.5 M NaI was jellified by CMC in various amounts up to 20 wt% (Fig. 1A–G). In this phase, I2 was not yet introduced since our aim was that of investigating the proposed hydrogel step-by-step by adding one component at a time. All samples were clearly homogeneous, and showed enhanced viscoelastic characteristics upon increasing the jellifier content; above 5 wt%, we clearly experienced the proper gelation of the electrolytes that formed a homogeneous sticky gel well consistent and self-standing even when overturning the vessel (Fig. 1C). The homogeneity was retained up to 20 wt%; samples at higher CMC content were excluded from our investigation.

The promising prospects of the obtained materials as electrolytes for DSSCs were determined by ionic conductivity (σ) measurements through EIS analysis. Gels containing CMC in the 2.5–20 wt% range displayed very similar σ values, in the range of 10 mS cm−1 at ambient temperature (Fig. 2A, Table S1†). This value is lower with respect to that (48.4 mS cm−1) of the liquid counterpart, which suggests, as expected, a slightly restricted ion mobility in the gel electrolytes. Anyway, it is worth noting that our hydrogel electrolyte shows room temperature σ values one order of magnitude higher than pure ionic liquids, such as 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (HMII), which was successfully proposed in efficient DSSCs.40

The ionic conductivity of 0.50 M pristine aqueous NaI and of a NaI-free gel containing 10 wt% CMC are also shown for comparison. (B) Ionic conductivity, in the temperature range of −25/+70 °C, of 0.50 M aqueous NaI gels containing different amounts of CMC. 
Gels containing 5, 10 and 20 wt% of CMC were further tested for their ionic conductivity between 70 and −25 °C (Fig. 2B, Table S2†), to cover the practical operational conditions of a DSSC. Values close to 10−2 S cm−1 were measured in a broad temperature range, while a dramatic decrease of σ was observed below −10 °C, likely ascribable to water solidification. As a result, we can confidently assume that our proposed biosourced aqueous electrolyte can be safely employed in DSSCs operating in places where the temperature frequently drops below zero, without affecting the charge transport properties up to −10 °C. Experimental data were also fitted to verify if the electrolyte clearly followed one of the linear trends proposed by Arrhenius and Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher. However, as can be seen in Fig. S1,† a regression coefficient close to 1 was not obtained in any case, therefore we cannot firmly claim one of these models for the electrolyte described in this work. Thus, we likely attribute the ionic conductivity vs. temperature trend to a mixed Arrhenius/non-Arrhenius behaviour.
Overall, the data collected suggest that the supply of I− ions at the photoanode is likely not limited by the slow diffusion through the three-dimensional CMC network in a wide range of temperatures. Indeed, efficient I− ion supply is a fundamental requirement to ensure fast regeneration, since it is well known that a slow regeneration with respect to the rate of back electron transfer from the semiconductor to the oxidized dye molecules would affect the photovoltaic performance.2,41,42 Evidence of this phenomenon ascribed to the low ionic conductivity of some classes of polymer electrolytes was reported by Nogueira et al.,43 who experimented polymeric systems with a maximum conductivity of 10−5 S cm−1.44 However, one should consider that this value is lower by two orders of magnitude when compared to the one we obtained here with the water-based NaI/CMC gel electrolytes.
A self-standing gel composed of 10 wt% CMC, 0.50 M aqueous NaI and 30 mM I2 (Fig. 1H) was used to fill a dummy cell and investigated in depth by means of EIS analysis. It is worth noting that this gel electrolyte was not fully homogeneous; indeed, small brownish aggregates (also recalled and shown later on in the following) randomly appeared in the sample, likely ascribable to the formation of polymer–I2 complexes. Polymer–I2 complexes are common in many cellulose derivatives and other natural and synthetic polymers; indeed, literature studies showed that binding sites were found to be located in the amorphous regions.45 Anyway, the slight inhomogeneity did not affect at all the electrochemical performance of the sample, which remained constant over time. The value of RPt (resistance to charge transfer at Pt/electrolyte interface)48 from the impedance measurement was lower than 1 Ω cm2, similar to what was observed in the case of 1.50 M liquid NaI + 50 mM I2 (Fig. 3).

Effect of CMC content on the photovoltaic performance of aqueous DSSCs
The data reported in the previous paragraph suggest that CMC-containing electrolytes are likely to be successfully applied in truly aqueous DSSCs, and the faint inhomogeneity (brownish spots) in the gels containing both I2 and NaI does not affect significantly the electrochemical performance.
The most performing aqueous liquid electrolytes (according to our previous work focused on the unravelling of the I−/I3− chemistry in water36) were used to prepare gel electrolytes at various CMC amounts. These starting electrolyte solutions contained 50 mM I2 and 4.5 M NaI or 50 mM I2 and 5.5 M KI. When 10 wt% CMC was introduced in these liquid electrolytes, the gel point was surpassed in both cases. Thus, we added CMC amounts in the range of 3.5 (viscous fluid) to 7.5 wt% (self-standing gel).
The photovoltaic parameters referred to the best performances of the solar cells co-sensitized with D131 and CDCA (D131:CDCA = 1:1.8) are shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3.† Data were selected among those recorded during the first week of dark storage at ambient temperature (all results are shown in Tables S4–S13†). The cells filled with the electrolyte containing 6.5 wt% CMC and NaI were excluded because of massive air infiltration during sealing by hot-pressing.
 Fig. 4  Photovoltaic parameters referred to the best performance of the DSSCs stored at ambient temperature during the first week after assembly. The solar cells were filled with gel electrolytes containing 4.5 M NaI or 5.5 M KI at various CMC contents. I2 was 50 mM in all cases. All the photoanodes were co-sensitized with D131 and CDCA (D131:CDCA = 1:1.8). Data refer to the third of three consecutive measurements at 1 sun. Lines just connect data points and have no physical meaning. Each plot shows the average value of the photovoltaic parameters for the corresponding liquid DSSCs. 
It was noted that the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) was the main factor affecting efficiency. With both NaI- and KI-containing electrolytes, the best photovoltaic performances were achieved at 5.5 wt% CMC. The best efficiencies reached by the gels containing KI were similar at different CMC contents. This is likely related to the fact that the ionic conductivity of the gels containing iodide and CMC did not change as a function of the cellulose content. When discussing these PCE values, it must also be noticed that no additives were used to selectively improve the photovoltaic parameters; indeed, our purpose is to evaluate the characteristics of a pure aqueous electrolyte upon addition of the natural cellulose-based jellifier. Moreover, almost none of the additives conventionally used in the DSSC field, such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI), are soluble in water. In this regard, it is rather surprising that some research groups recently proposed TBP- and NMBI-based aqueous DSSCs;46,47 in our laboratories we were not able to solubilize them in water, even in the presence of surfactants.
By comparing the photovoltaic parameters of this work with our recent outcomes in the field of aqueous liquid electrolytes,36 it emerges that the efficiency values reached by the cell containing CMC and NaI were about 0.1% lower than those achieved with CMC and KI. We also noticed that the Jsc value achieved by the cell containing NaI and 5.5 wt% CMC was higher than its liquid counterpart, thus confirming the excellent transport properties of the quasi-solid electrolyte proposed in this work. In all of the other cases, Jsc and open-circuit potential (Voc) values were lower in gel electrolytes. In particular, Voc values achieved with CMC and NaI were significantly low. Moreover, such a reduction of Voc values in the gel electrolytes was somewhat unexpected. Actually, CMC hydrogels are supposed to be slightly basic because of the protonation of carboxylic moieties leading to the release of hydroxyl groups. Under this condition, a shift of the flat band potential of the semiconductor towards negative potentials vs. SHE is expected, with a consequent increase of Voc values. Anyway, the flat band potential also depends upon the surface dipole moment due to the anchored dye layer, which can be affected by the interactions with the electrolyte. The increase of dark current in the solar cells filled with gel electrolytes would explain the decrease of Voc when compared to the liquid counterparts. Anyway, under this condition, the fill factor (FF) should be decreased as well, and this was not found to be the case. Sealing problems may have played a role, as well; however, we may almost completely exclude this hypothesis as the long-term stability of these cells is excellent (see the following).

Fig. 5 (blue curve) shows the steady state cyclic voltammogram of the gel electrolyte containing 6.5 wt% CMC and KI, as a representative sample that also allowed the solar cells to retain most of their efficiency over time, both at ambient temperature and at 60 °C. The diffusion-limited current density in the gel electrolyte is nearly halved compared to that of the liquid electrolyte (red curve). Anyway, its value is much higher (≈15 mA cm−2) than the photocurrent generated by the cells. This result suggests that mass transport through the electrolyte is not supposed to limit the photocurrent, unless diffusion is somewhat restricted inside the nanostructured semiconductor layer. The diffusion coefficient of triiodide calculated assuming [I3−] = 50 mM is 5.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. It is comparable to the values reported by Hauch and Georg for liquid nitrile-based electrolytes48 and, in fact, one order of magnitude higher to those obtained with aqueous gels based on amphiphilic copolymers such as Pluronic F77 and P123 mixed with an aqueous solution of 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII).47 Such a high value can be also due to the fact that, at high I− concentrations such as those experimented here, sizeable amounts of polyiodides are supposed to be present in the electrolyte solution. This fact may promote the Grotthuss-type charge transfer mechanism in gel electrolytes.49

Long-term stability of lab-scale DSSCs based on aqueous gel electrolyte

Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells stored at ambient temperature. At low CMC contents of 3.5 and 4.5 wt%, the efficiency values slightly increased over time both in NaI- and KI-based devices. At high CMC contents, the cell performance worsened over time in the case of KI-containing gels. Overall, the most stable cell from the KI pool (6.5 wt% CMC) retained 85% efficiency after about one month. The conversion efficiency of the cells filled with NaI-based gels at high CMC content fluctuated over time, but the values observed after about one month were similar to those recorded right after cell assembly. The most efficient cell from the NaI pool retained 93% efficiency at the end of the monitoring period. This is a truly impressive result if one considers that other biosourced polymer matrices (e.g., gelatin) reported in the literature showed poor stability, with >20% loss in PCE in about 2 h after cell assembly.34
 Fig. 6  Photovoltaic parameters versus time of the solar cells co-sensitized with D131 and CDCA (D131:CDCA = 1:1.8) stored in the dark at ambient temperature. The solar cells contained 5.5 M KI + 50 mM I2 (left panel) or 4.5 M NaI + 50 mM I2 (right panel), jellified with different amounts of CMC. Data points refer to the third of three consecutive measurements at 1 sun. Lines just connect data points and have no physical meaning. 
The stability of our aqueous solar cells was more deeply investigated by inducing a thermal stress at 60 °C in a 35 days aging test. The photovoltaic performances of the cells stored at 60 °C fluctuated over time (Fig. 7, Tables S4–S13†). The highest efficiency values, after ageing, were recorded at 5.5 and 6.5 wt% CMC with KI-containing electrolytes. In most cases, efficiency values peaked during the first week of storage at 60 °C. This may be due to better pore filling due to both the rearrangement of the biosourced macromolecules and the lowered viscosity of the gel promoted by heat. Exceptions are represented by the cells filled with the KI containing electrolytes at 3.5 and 4.5 wt% CMC. Actually, the slight inhomogeneity of the gels appeared to be reduced right after cell extraction from the oven. The brownish spots reappeared after cooling under ambient conditions; anyway, their presence surprisingly did not detrimentally affect both the performance and the stability of the cells, as per the data plotted in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells co-sensitized with D131 and CDCA (D131:CDCA = 1:1.8) stored in the dark at 60 °C versus storage time. The solar cells contained 5.5 M KI + 50 mM I2 (left panels) or 4.5 M NaI + 50 mM I2 (right panels) jellified with different amounts of CMC. The time intervals during which the cells have been stored at 60 °C are represented by filled coloured areas. The cells were cooled at ambient temperature for 24 h before recording the J–V curves. Data points refer to the third of three consecutive measurements at 1 sun. Lines just connect data points and have no physical meaning. 
The efficiency values recorded about one month after cell assembly and ageing at 60 °C were similar to those recorded during the first week in the case of the less performing cells. As regards the photovoltaic performance of the cells that displayed efficiency values ≥0.5%, some of them were found to slightly decrease during the same period. Anyway, devices demonstrated proper operation during the whole test, thus accounting for the stable performance of the proposed electrolyte.
Upon observation of the devices subjected to the aging test, dye desorption is likely one of the causes of the slight Jsc decrease observed for some of the cells. Indeed, the discoloration of the active area was clearly observed in the cell filled with the electrolyte containing 4.5 wt% CMC and KI (Fig. 8, top). In some other cases, the electrolyte partially depleted over time near the active area (Fig. 8, bottom). This typically arises from an unsuitable sealing, which may result in gel deswelling (leading to the leakage of the liquid phase). In the present work, we rarely observed electrolyte traces out of the active area; therefore, we hypothesised that the CMC-based gel penetrated the semiconductor pores left unfilled after cell sealing. Indeed, it is well known in the literature that DSSC filling with a gel electrolyte is rather tricky, especially when the gel consistence makes it impossible to introduce it by vacuum filling. Therefore, electrolyte deposition must be performed manually or by screen-printing, and the proper dosage of gel amount in the first case (like in our study) is difficult to be pursued.

The excellent transmittance in the visible range is also shown in Fig. S3.† Bottom: Cell Na45B filled with 4.5 M aqueous NaI + 50 mM I2 + 4.5 wt% CMC 6 days after cell assembly and after 12 days of storage at 60 °C. Both the cells were co-sensitized with D131 and CDCA (D131:CDCA = 1:1.8). 
Overall, the most important outcome of this experiment is the truly impressive stability of the CMC-based aqueous electrolytes upon thermal aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the long-term (≈800–875 h) stability of an aqueous DSSC upon thermal aging at 60 °C; the only study on 100% aqueous DSSCs stressed under heat shows an aging test limited at 200 h.50 Thus, we here demonstrate that CMC can successfully jellify the aqueous solution of the redox mediator, at the same time ensuring its effective trapping within the macromolecular matrix without affecting the diffusion of the shuttle ions between the electrodes in the cell.
Renewability, cost and environmental impact of the proposed electrolyte
When proposing novel materials and components for third-generation solar cells, efficiency and stability are not the only parameters to be considered. Conversely, the renewability of the selected starting materials, their overall cost (including disposal) and environmental impact should be carefully evaluated.
The renewability factor of an electrolyte is the ratio between the mass of renewable components and the total mass of the electrolyte. For our CMC-based aqueous electrolyte (4.5 M NaI, 50 mM I2, 5.5 wt% CMC, volume = 1 mL, massTOT = 1.6 g, massH2O = 1.6 g − massNaI+I2+CMC), the renewability factor is equal to 57%. To our knowledge, it is lower only to the gelatin-based electrolyte proposed by Xiang et al.,33 for which we calculated a renewability factor of 77%. Anyway, these two systems represent a strong step ahead with respect to traditional DSSCs, where the renewability factor of the electrolyte is 0% in the standard liquid system and ≈5% in gel-polymer electrolytes where the organic solvent is jellified by (for example) a 5 wt% of biosourced polymer.51
However, renewability is not the only factor to be considered for a newly proposed solar cell component. Indeed, the cost of starting materials represents another key factor for third-generation devices. As an example, NaI salt (from Sigma-Aldrich) used in this work costs 0.60 € g−1, versus 122 € g−1 (source: Dyenamo) of the cobalt-based redox mediator used by Xiang et al. in the work cited above.33
A third relevant factor to be quantified is the environmental impact in the case of accidental solar cell breakage, as well as its cost for disposal at the end of operational life. To easily quantify this, the list of petroleum-derived components and heavy metals present in the electrolyte formulation must be considered. Our hydrogel electrolyte does not contain these potentially harmful components, therefore its environmental impact in the case of accident is definitely negligible, as well as its cost for disposal at the end of cell life. Conversely, all the record-efficiency aqueous solar cells (see Table S14†) contain cobalt-based mediators and petroleum-derived additives (such as TBP and NMBI). Their presence must be considered and, in our opinion, terms such as “green” and “environmentally friendly” should not be easily used in such cases.
Even if a perfect system able to gain the maximum score in all of the above reported parameters is still rather far to be proposed, we can surely state that our biosourced polymeric matrix for heavy metal-free aqueous electrolytes represents a strong candidate for the emerging truly green water-based photovoltaics.
Conclusions
CMC hydrogels have demonstrated suitable characteristics as electrolytes in 100% aqueous DSSCs. Hydrogels containing both NaI and I2 allowed for efficient charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The ionic conductivity of NaI-containing hydrogels and the diffusion coefficient of I3− ions were slightly lower than in the liquid counterpart, anyway they were, however, comparable to and/or higher than the recent literature reports on ionic liquids and water-based gel electrolytes. The truly promising electrochemical characteristics suggested that the photocurrent generation should not be limited by slow diffusion of I− or I3− ions, as for an ionic mobility kept constant even down to −10 °C.
The newly developed biosourced aqueous gel electrolytes were tested in lab-scale solar cells and the best photovoltaic performances (0.72%) were achieved in the presence of 5.5 wt% CMC. In this work, no additives were added to the electrolyte and no surface treatment of the photoanodes was performed, in order to keep the whole system as simple, sustainable and cheap as possible; this also means that there is much room for improving PCE values. The most stable cell demonstrated a remarkable 93% efficiency retention after 29 days of dark storage; the CMC-based devices also showed a robust stability when subjected to a further month of thermal aging at 60 °C in an oven. We found a few difficulties when manually dosing the exact amount of quasi-solid electrolyte in the cell, therefore we think that future work should be addressed towards in situ gelation of cellulose derivatives that surely would allow reducing the impact of sealing and ensuring an in depth pore filling.
Overall, we here demonstrated that photovoltaic cells can be fabricated with (heavy) metal-free redox shuttles and dye sensitizers, organic solvent-free electrolytes, and bioderived cellulosic jellifiers by simple and cost-effective preparation procedures, thus opening the way to the next-generation of green solar energy conversion based on renewable components.
