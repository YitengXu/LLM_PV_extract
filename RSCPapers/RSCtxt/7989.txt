    , Accepted 30th May 2023First published on 20th June 2023AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), based on p-type polymer donors and n-type acceptors as the active layer, offer exceptional promise because of excellent thermal stability, superior film formation, and good mechanical stress as a unique bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell combination. Therefore, tuning the molecular composition between polymers is crucial for optimizing power conversion efficiency (PCE) in these all-PSC systems. In this study, we synthesized a series of naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based random terpolymers P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-TT10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) with axisymmetric (BDD, TPD) and asymmetric (TT, 2FQ) electron acceptors. Compared with the blend morphology of PBDB-T:N2200, their diverse effects due to the addition of trace amounts of axisymmetric and asymmetric components were comprehensively investigated using physical and surface analyses and structural simulations. Consequently, most of our polymer acceptors demonstrated improved fill factors (FFs) in the optimal morphology. P(NDI-BDD10)-based devices achieved the highest PCE of 6.80% and FF of 69.1%, while the architecturally most asymmetric P(NDI-TT10)-based devices reached the lowest PCE of 4.52% despite an enhanced FF of 65.4%. As a result, the appropriate molecular arrangement is crucial for obtaining the desired morphology and improved PCE. Our findings give novel molecular design insight into the distinctions between axisymmetric and asymmetric electron acceptors and seem significant for achieving improved morphological features and efficiency.
Introduction
Due to the advantages of cost-effectiveness, portability, and semitransparency, solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant interest as a future power source over the last few decades.1–10 Among the systems implementing various PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), based on a combination of conjugated polymer donors and acceptors as the active layer, have shown a more excellent morphological stability under illumination, thermal stress, and mechanical stress than solar cells with small molecules.11–22 Since the initial research on all-PSCs was published in 2010, two kinds of polymers are mainly employed for n-type, in contrast to p-type, which has many candidates. The first comprises polymer acceptors based on a Y-series small molecule acceptor, while the second is a naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymer acceptor (N2200 series).23–31 Even though recent research shows that Y-series polymer acceptors with an excess 15% power conversion efficiency (PCE) are better than NDI-based polymers in terms of efficiency, simple synthetic method, high charge mobility, strong electron affinity, etc., they still have advantages as acceptors in terms of scalable all-PSCs.32–36 To fully realize their potential, however, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of these promising NDI-based polymers requires to be significantly increased due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Furthermore, controlling the morphology between p- and n-type polymers in films to facilitate charge separation and transport is crucial for high-efficiency all-PSCs.1,37–42 Numerous designs linked to NDI-based polymers are now being investigated to change alkyl chains or introduce novel donor units used as a counterpart of NDI monomers; nevertheless, care must be taken in structural design to prevent unexpected changes in the morphology and energy levels.43–49
Consequently, precise control of molecules is significant for increasing PCE. In this study, a new NDI-based random terpolymer acceptor, P(NDI-X10), was designed, where X10 is a 10% electron-acceptor unit, using the axisymmetric acceptors of 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) and 5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione (TPD), and the asymmetric acceptors of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (TT) and 6,7-difluoro-2-((2-hexyldecyl)oxy)quinoxaline (2FQ), to the existing centrosymmetric structures of NDI to induce intermolecular arrangement and morphology control without drastically altering the characteristics of polymers. Furthermore, due to the addition of a small amount of axisymmetric and asymmetric molecular compositions, their key qualities were exhaustively investigated using physical and surface analyses and structural simulations. Compared to PBDB-T:N2200, the roughness of all-modified polymer acceptors in the blending system decreased, resulting in an enhanced morphology and fill factor (FF) values. Also, the overall photovoltaic performance of P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), and P(NDI-2FQ10), excluding P(NDI-TT10), was increased, especially P(NDI-BDD10) showed the highest PCE of 6.80% with an FF of 69.1%. P(NDI-TT10), however, showed the lowest PCE of 4.52% with an FF of 65.4%. Since P(NDI-TT10) has the most asymmetric structure, the lowest roughness, and the smallest domain size, this form impedes the smooth movement of free charge carriers, inducing charge recombination.27,50,51 Our results provide new molecular design insight into the distinctions between axisymmetric and asymmetric electron acceptors and have significant consequences for achieving both desirable morphological traits and promising PCE values.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The dipole moment, LUMO, and electron affinity (EA) were calculated using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G*+) to understand the differences in the electronic features of each acceptor unit. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the centrosymmetric NDI has a net dipole moment of 0.00 D, and the axisymmetric BDD and TPD have net dipole moments of 0.83 and 2.09 D along with the y-axis, respectively. In contrast, the asymmetric TT and 2FQ have net dipole moments of 2.15 and 4.23 D in the xy-plane, respectively. Moreover, the calculated LUMO energy levels and EAs of NDI, BDD, TPD, TT, and 2FQ are −3.78/2.70, −2.48/1.30, −2.20/0.85, −2.23/1.18, and −2.46/1.22 eV, respectively, indicating that the electron-accepting ability increased from the TPD to NDI unit (see Fig. 1(b)).

Fig. 1(c) shows the synthetic routes of polymers. First, the dibrominated acceptor monomers, such as NDI-Br2, BDD-Br2, TPD-Br2, TT-Br2, and 2FQ-Br2, and the 5,5′-bis (trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (T2) monomer were prepared according to the established procedures. Then, a series of P(NDI-X10) were synthesized using palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization, replacing 10 mol% of the NDI-Br2 monomer with various other acceptor monomers. The resultant P(NDI-X10) were denoted as P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-TT10), and P(NDI-2FQ10), reflecting the replaced acceptor units (e.g., BDD, TPD, TT, and 2FQ). The experimental section contains descriptions and characterization of the synthetic processes. To determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the P(NDI-X10), high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography was applied to the eluent of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 100 °C relative to the polystyrene standard (see Table 1). All polymers showed similar high Mns of 67.0–72.5 kDa and PDIs of 1.69–1.80, minimizing any variations in their optical and electrical properties due to molecular weights.

UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to examine the optical characteristics of the P(NDI-X10) acceptors in films and chloroform (Fig. S1, ESI† and Fig. 2(a)). Absorption spectra of these acceptors exhibited two absorption bands. A high-energy absorption band at around 380 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition.49,52–55 A low-energy absorption band (550–850 nm) is accounted for the intramolecular charge transfer between an electron-donating and an electron-acceptor unit. Compared with that of the N2200 neat film, the normalized absorption spectra of P(NDI-X10) exhibited enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, which might be attributed to the dipole moment from the less symmetric structures of altered acceptor units. The red-shifted peaks from the solution to the thin-film state indicated the adequate packing of polymer chains in the solid state, and all P(NDI-X10) exhibited more red-shifted peaks around 30 nm than that of N2200.56–60Fig. 2(b) shows the measured absorption coefficients of the neat films. They are closely related to charge generation; the highest absorption coefficient was measured for P(NDI-BDD10) and the lowest was measured for P(NDI-TT10). Overall, all P(NDI-X10) have complementary absorption ranges with donor polymer PBDB-T, which has strong absorption at 450–600 nm.

To evaluate the electrochemical properties of P(NDI-X10), cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed for determination of the LUMO energy levels by the reduction onset; the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were determined by subtracting the optical bandgap from the LUMO levels using the following equation (EHOMO = ELUMO − Eoptg). CV curves of the materials were measured with thin films deposited on a platinum working electrode in the solution of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an internal standard and 0.1 M of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile as a supporting electrolyte at 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 2(c), all P(NDI-X10) exhibited reversible reduction peaks, but no oxidation peaks were found during the anodic scan. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of N2200, P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-TT10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) were estimated to be −3.94/−5.40, −3.94/−5.41, −3.92/−5.39, −3.93/−5.37, and −3.89/−5.34 eV, respectively (Table 1. and Fig. 2(d)). Interestingly, despite the significantly different adiabatic EA and EDFTLUMO values (Table S1, ESI†) between the accepting units compared to NDI, the measured LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers displayed negligible offsets, except for P(NDI-2FQ10). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of polymer acceptors show an adequate energy level difference from PBDB-T, indicating that it supports effective exciton dissociation and charge generation closely related to current density (JSC).46,61,62 As shown in Fig. 2(e) and Fig. S2, ESI,† the optimized structures and the HOMO and LUMO distributions of the dimer models were estimated using density functional theory calculations. Compared to the tilting angle between NDI and T2 of 40.6–44.9°, the tilting angles between the other acceptor units and T2 are small (0.2–10°), suggesting that replacement of the NDI with another acceptor unit is advantageous for improving the π–π packing of the polymer.
Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all-PSCs were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the synthesized P(NDI-X10)-based devices, which have a conventional configuration of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBDB-T:P(NDI-X10)/perylene diimide amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. The BHJ active layer was optimized at a 1:2 weight ratio and was spin-coated using chlorobenzene with 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane as the additive at room temperature. The effect of P(NDI-X10), which contained 10% different acceptor units, was investigated under the optimized conditions. The abilities of all-PSCs have been evaluated under AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The optimized device's current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. With the optimum conditions, the binary control system of PBDB-T:N2200-based device demonstrated a PCE of 6.21% with a JSC of 10.91 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.884 V, and a FF of 64.4%. The performance of the P(NDI-BDD10)-based device was the most enhanced, which exhibited a PCE of 6.80%, with a JSC of 10.89 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.903 V, and a FF of 69.1%. Furthermore, the performances of other P(NDI-TPD10)- and P(NDI-2FQ10)-based devices were improved, resulting in a PCE of 6.66%, 6.47% with a JSC 10.80 mA cm−2, 10.28 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.892 V, 0.895 V, and a FF of 69.5%, 70.3% for P(NDI-TPD10) and P(NDI-2FQ10), respectively. However, the P(NDI-TT10)-based device exhibited a poor PCE of 4.52% with a decreased JSC of 8.02 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.862 V and a FF of 65.4% despite introducing an asymmetric structure of TT. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the current density measured using external quantum efficiency was well consistent with the JSC value obtained from J–V measurements within a 5% deviation. Adding a small amount of axisymmetric and asymmetric molecular compositions positively affects the FF except for P(NDI-TT10).

Morphology characterization
The morphology of the photoactive layer significantly influences the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs.63–65 To further understand the effect of partially substituted acceptors P(NDI-X10) on the morphology in the BHJ, the blend films were investigated using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Roughness RMS values of the blend films of the P(NDI-X10) were 1.50, 1.49, 1.22, and 1.72 for P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-2FQ10), and P(NDI-TT10), indicating a smoother surface than that of the N2200 blend film, whose roughness RMS value is 2.08. The low roughness could be the evidence of restraining of the excessive aggregation, which is a general issue for all-PSCs.66,67

The phase separation and domain size of the donor and acceptor in the blend films were investigated using TEM. The phase separation and domain sizes of P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) were found to be more significant than those of N2200, meaning that they could be beneficial for charge transport with the pure domain.28,30 However, in the case of P(NDI-TT10), excessive miscibility between the donor and acceptor was observed, which can be the primary reason for the poor device performance with a low FF because of insufficient charge transport. Additionally, the miscibility of PBDB-T and the P(NDI-X10) was estimated by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) values using , where γD and γA are the surface energy (γ) of the donor and acceptor, respectively.68,69 The surface energy was measured using the contact angle of water and ethylene glycol on neat films, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the corresponding γ values are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The values of χ for N2200, P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-2FQ10), and P(NDI-TT10) with PBDB-T were 0.0057, 0.0196, 0.0235, 0.0520, and 0.0001, respectively, and these values agree with the tendency of phase separation observed in the transmission electron microscopy images.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis was conducted to investigate the molecular packing structure of the neat and blended films (Fig. S4, ESI† and Fig. 5). Both neat and blend films with polymer acceptors exhibited distinct (010) scattering peaks along the out-of-plane direction and (100) lamellar peaks in the in-plane direction, indicating a favorable face-on packing orientation, which is beneficial for the efficient charge transport.70–73 As summarized in Table S3 (ESI†), in blend films, the π–π stacking (CCL010) and the lamellar packing coherence lengths (CCL100) are 18.7/97.8, 20.2/103.2, 19.9/93.2, 19.3/91.6, and 18.9/91.7 Å for N2200, P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-2FQ10), and P(NDI-TT10), respectively. The PBDB-T:P(NDI-BDD10) blend film with the highest π–π stacking coherence length is expected to have relatively efficient charge transport, which might be the reason for the high device performance.48,74,75

Charge transport and recombination
The JSC and VOC were measured depending on the light intensity (Plight) to gain insight into the charge recombination of the N2200- and P(NDI-X10)-based devices. The light intensity dependence of JSC can be used to understand the charge recombination behavior. The dependence of VOC on Plight reflects which recombination is dominant in operating PSCs between trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination. If the slope of the natural logarithm of the Plightversus VOC is close to 2 kT q−1, trap-assisted recombination is the primary process.76,77 On the other hand, if the slope is close to kT q−1 it means that the bimolecular recombination is a dominant process in the photoactive layer. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the slopes were 1.406, 1.371, 1.382, 1.437, and 1.452 for N2200, P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), P(NDI-2FQ10), and P(NDI-TT10), respectively, indicating that the addition of axisymmetric acceptor units, P(NDI-BDD10) and P(NDI-TPD10), results in less trap-assisted recombination than that of the centrosymmetric structure of N2200 and that resulting from the addition of asymmetric acceptor units, P(NDI-TT10) and P(NDI-2FQ10). The relationship between Plight and JSC follows the power law, which can be described as JSC ∼ Pαlight. When the value of α is close to unity, the blend films suppress the bimolecular recombination.78–80 As shown in Fig. 6(b), the α values from linear-fitted curves of Plightversus JSC were 0.976, 0.978, 0.976, 0.972, and 0.959 for N2200-, P(NDI-BDD10)-, P(NDI-TPD10)-, P(NDI-2FQ)-, and P(NDI-TT10)-based devices, respectively. The results suggest that the bimolecular recombination is almost restrained, but the P(NDI-TT10)-based device exhibited a disfavored charge recombination behavior, which agrees with its poor photovoltaic parameters.

Hole and electron mobilities of the blend films were measured using the space-charge limited current method to evaluate the charge transport properties.66,81 The configurations of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag for hole-only devices and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Ag for electron-only devices were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 6(c), (d) and summarized in Table S4 (ESI†), the hole/electron mobilities were measured to be 2.00 × 10−4/1.77 × 10−4, 2.43 × 10−4/2.41 × 10−4, 2.34 × 10−4/2.11 × 10−4, 1.50 × 10−4, 7.35 × 10−5, and 2.16 × 10−4, 1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for N2200-, P(NDI-BDD10)-, P(NDI-TPD10)-, P(NDI-TT10)-, and P(NDI-2FQ10)-based devices, respectively. The PBDB-T:P(NDI-BDD10) blend exhibited the most balanced hole and electron mobility μe/μh ratio of 0.991, which is consistent with the observed photovoltaic parameters of higher JSC and FFs.45,81–86
Conclusions
Using NDI with a trace quantity of BDD, TPD, 2FQ, and TT as electron acceptors, we synthesized a series of P(NDI-X10). Compared with N2200, it was feasible to fine-tune morphology control and molecular packing by adding axisymmetric and asymmetric structures into a symmetric NDI structure, leading to reduced surface roughness and overall FF improvement. Considering the structural properties of each additional polymer acceptor unit, P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) have a comparable film morphology and domain size. However, P(NDI-TT10), which has the most asymmetric structure, has the lowest roughness and the smallest domain size. In P(NDI-2FQ10), we observed results comparable to those of axisymmetric structures by building a less asymmetric structure than P(NDI-TT10) with a semi-asymmetric structure. This tendency produced comparable PCE, and P(NDI-BDD10), P(NDI-TPD10), and P(NDI-2FQ10) exhibited PCEs of 6.80%, 6.66%, and 6.47%, respectively, which were higher than that of N2200; however, P(NDI-TT10) has a poor PCE of 4.52% because its tiny domain size and morphology lead to charge recombination. Our findings give novel molecular design insight into the distinctions between axisymmetric and asymmetric electron acceptors and seem significant for achieving improved morphological characteristics and a promising PCE value.
