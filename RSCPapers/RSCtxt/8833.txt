The copper hydroxide thin films are deposited by means of a ligand-exchange equilibrium reaction of metal-fluoro complex ions, and fluoride ions are consumed in the reaction by boric acid as a scavenging agent. These films were annealed at 300, 400 and 500 °C to obtain CuO thin films. The films were characterized by different techniques in order to determine their phases, morphologies and wettability. The supercapacitive performance of the CuO films was found to be the best in a KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the films was calculated from cyclic voltammetry (at several scan rates), charging–discharging (at different current densities) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest values of specific capacitance at 3 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte were 552 and 849 F g−1 on flat and mesh stainless steel, respectively. The supercapacitive performance was significantly improved when the CuO thin films were deposited on the mesh substrate compared to the flat substrate due to the higher surface area of the former. Also, a symmetric device with CuO on mesh stainless steel was fabricated and tested.
1 Introduction
Due to the worldwide energy crisis, there is a need for sustainable energy sources and storage devices. The typical non-conventional energy devices such as batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors are dependent on the principle of electrochemical energy conversion.1 As long as fuel is fed to a fuel cell, electrical energy can be obtained from it. As per requirement, the stored energy can be drawn from the battery. Supercapacitors or electrochemical supercapacitors (ECs) are constructed to bridge the gap between batteries and capacitors to form fast charging energy storage devices with intermediate specific energies.2 Moreover, supercapacitors possess high specific capacitance, good power density and long cycle life.3
It is particularly essential to note that supercapacitors can not only be discharged in seconds, but also be charged in such a short time period. This is a major advantage for energy recovery systems, e.g., for dynamic braking of transport systems.4 EC stores considerable energy in a small volume and releases it in the form of power. ECs can be classified into two types based on their electrochemical mechanisms of energy storage: electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors or ultracapacitors.1,5–7 EDLCs store energy through the accumulation of charges at the interface of an electrode and electrolyte. EDLCs mainly include carbon-based materials.8 In the second type of supercapacitors, i.e., pseudocapacitors, the energy is stored through redox or faradaic reactions occurring between the electrode material and the electrolyte. Pseudocapacitor electrodes mainly include metal oxides and conducting polymers.9
Metal oxides, including copper oxide, are considered to be ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors.10 Copper oxide is abundant in nature, eco-friendly, chemically stable, and reasonably priced; also, it possesses favorable pseudocapacitive characteristics.11 It is a capable material for supercapacitors due to its high theoretical capacitance (1783 F g−1).11,12 Moreover, it is used in Li-ion batteries, field emission materials, active catalysts, gas sensors, high-efficiency thermal conducting materials, magnetic recording media, spintronics, opto-electronics, solar cells, etc.10 The morphology of the electrode material plays a vital role in the supercapacitive performance.9 Therefore, various synthesis procedures are carried out to deposit copper oxide on different substrates to alter the morphology and hence the supercapacitive performance.11,13–27
In addition to high capacitance, a supercapacitor requires good mechanical properties, such as light weight and flexibility. These can be achieved by using stainless steel (SS) mesh; which is inexpensive, lightweight and flexible and possesses the extra advantage of a high surface area compared with flat SS sheets.28 It has been observed that SS mesh has the same weaving arrangement as conventional textiles but is electrically conductive.29 Moreover, the SS mesh provides a higher surface area for material hosting and also promotes electron transport.30,31 In the literature, various materials deposited on SS mesh have shown admirable supercapacitive performance.28,29,32–35 Also, devices are being fabricated using SS mesh as a step towards industrial application.29,30,32,34,36
As compared to physical deposition methods, wet chemical methods offer many advantages because of their economic and ecological nature and the feasibility of large scale production with low capital investment. Liquid phase deposition (LPD), a wet chemical deposition method, is less explored for supercapacitor electrode preparation.37,38 LPD is a direct deposition method, i.e. it is an additive/binder free method, and there is no limitation on the selection of substrate. Also, it can be easily implemented for large area substrates. Unlike hydrothermal methods, LPD does not require high temperature and pressure or a special experimental setup such as an autoclave or furnace for deposition. In contrast to sol–gel methods, LPD does not require toxic chemicals, and the deposition can be performed at lower temperature and in aqueous medium. Hence, LPD is an additive and modifier-free, template-free, simple, mild, and scalable chemical method that has huge potential in the deposition of supercapacitor electrodes.
In this work, we report the supercapacitive behavior of CuO electrodes deposited by liquid phase deposition (LPD).37 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of deposition of CuO by LPD on flat and mesh stainless steel (SS) along with the study of its supercapacitive properties. A symmetric device (CuO) was also fabricated using SS mesh and demonstrates potential to fabricate portable energy storage devices in the future.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Material preparation
The deposition experiments were performed in open atmosphere at room temperature (300 K). Prior to deposition, the SS (no. 304) substrates (1 × 3 cm2) were polished with zero grade polish paper and washed with detergent solution. These polished substrates were cleaned in 3% HCl for 1 min and then ultrasonically cleaned in double distilled water (DDW) for 15 min. These cleaned SS substrates were used for deposition. Flexible and lightweight SS mesh (number 200) woven from wire with a diameter of 0.05 mm was procured from Alfa Aesar. Prior to deposition, the SS mesh substrates were cleaned as mentioned before for flat SS.
Cu(OH)2 was precipitated from an aqueous solution of copper sulphate hexahydrate [CuSO4·6H2O] using liquor ammonia (NH4OH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The pale blue precipitate was separated by filtration, washed repeatedly using DDW and dried in air. The parent solution (Cu(OH)2–NH4F·HF) was obtained by dissolving a requisite amount of Cu(OH)2 in 1 M ammonium bifluoride (NH4F·HF) aqueous solution. As reported earlier, boric acid plays an important role in the supercapacitive performance.37 Boric acid (H3BO3) solutions with various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 M) were added as a scavenging agent to the parent solutions. The substrates were vertically suspended and soaked in the reaction solution for 20 hours (h). After being removed from the reaction solution, the pale blue coloured films were rinsed with DDW several times and dried at ambient temperature. As it can be seen in the photograph (Fig. S1, ESI†), a uniform film was formed with 0.5 M H3BO3; hence, this concentration was chosen for further studies. To ensure complete crystallization and oxidation, the as-deposited films were annealed at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C in air for 1 h, followed by natural cooling to room temperature. The same deposition process was followed as mentioned above for stainless steel mesh. As seen from Fig. S2 (ESI†), the flexibility of SS mesh was retained after deposition and annealing. The uniform arrangement of the bare SS mesh can be seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The CuO deposited on SS mesh was used to fabricate a symmetric device. First, two (3 × 2 cm2) SS meshes were obtained, and then CuO was deposited on a (2 × 2 cm2) area by employing the same procedure mentioned above. For the preparation of a gel electrolyte, a polymer matrix and electrolyte salt are needed. PVA is reported to be easy to prepare, hydrophilic, non-toxic and inexpensive.31,39 Among electrolyte salts, KOH has been extensively investigated and reported for gel-based electrolytes in the fabrication of devices.31 PVA in DDW was heated at 80 °C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature. Then, 2 M KOH was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. This electrolyte gel was painted on the two SS meshes coated with CuO and dried. Filter paper (Whatman 41 with a pore size range of 20–25 μm and a thickness of 220 μm) was used as a separator.40–45 The separator was soaked in electrolyte gel and sandwiched between these two electrodes. Next, the whole assembly was carefully covered with parafilm. This fabricated device was used for further measurements. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows a schematic and actual photograph of the fabricated symmetric device.
2.2 Characterization techniques
The phase composition and structural characterization of the as-deposited and annealed films were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) in the 2θ range of 10–80° scanned with CuKα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation. Raman spectra were measured on an Invia Renishaw instrument in the wavenumber range of 200–800 cm−1 using an argon laser excitation source (532 nm) with a resolution of 1 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were accomplished using XPS Kα+ (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) using Al Kα radiation. In order to compare the obtained data with the literature, peaks were corrected by referencing the carbon C1s peak to 284.5 eV.46,47 The raw data were fitted using XPSPEAK software (version 4.1). The surface morphologies of the films were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on an FEI Quanta 450 FEG instrument. The wettability of the films was tested by measuring the contact angle (θ) of a water drop with a volume of 5 μl placed on the film surface using an optical contact angle goniometer (OCA) at room temperature.
2.3 Electrochemical characterizations
The cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out using a computer-controlled IVIUM 1A Vertex potentiostat/galvanostat with standard two and three-electrode systems. A platinum sheet (1 cm2) was used as a counter electrode, whereas saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. The CuO film deposited on flat or mesh SS substrate acted as a working electrode. The CVs were recorded between −0.2 to 0.5 V vs. SCE potential window. The area of the CuO electrode dipped in the electrolyte was 1 cm2. The weight of the active material was calculated by the weight difference method with a METTLER TOLEDO (AX26 Delta Range) weighing balance. The weights of the CuO films on flat SS and mesh SS were 0.4 mg and 0.56 mg, respectively. The fabricated symmetric device was tested for CV, GCD and EIS measurements on a two-electrode system. Also, the actual demonstration of this device was checked with the help of 9 V battery and digital multimeter.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Film formation and reaction mechanism
The reaction mechanism of copper hydroxide film formation by LPD can be explained as follows:48 [CuF4]2− + nH2O ⇄ [CuF4−n(OH)n]2− + nHF(1) [CuF4−n(OH)n]2− + nH2O ⇄ [Cu(OH)4]2− + nHF(2) H3BO3 + 4HF ⇄ BF4− + H3O+ + 2H2O(3)
In the deposition solution, Cu2+ ions are accompanied by F− ions to afford [CuF4]2−. F− ions are sequentially released in reactions (1) and (2), and the reactions proceed to result in film formation. The ligand-exchange equilibrium reactions (hydrolysis of copper fluoro complex ions, reactions (1) and (2)) are shifted to the right hand side by the addition of boric acid to form stable complex ions as in reactions (1) and (3). The consumption of F− ions occurs due to the addition of boric acid (scavenging agent of F− ions) to the deposition solution. This accelerates the ligand exchange of [CuF4]2− and [CuF4−n(OH)n]2−, as in reactions (1) and (2). The [Cu(OH)4]2− formed in reaction (2) is then dehydrated on the surface of the substrate, which results in the formation of a copper hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] thin film.
3.2 XRD, Raman and XPS studies
XRD measurements were recorded to determine the crystal structures and phases of the films. Fig. 1A shows the XRD patterns of powders (scratched from the films) of the as-deposited film and those annealed at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C. The peaks found in the XRD pattern of the as-deposited sample were ascribed to Cu(OH)2, in correspondence with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card no. 80-0656. The peaks found in the XRD patterns of the films annealed at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C indicate the tenorite phase of CuO, corresponding to JCPDS card no. 45-0937. It can be observed that the crystallinity increases with the annealing temperature from 200 to 500 °C. No peak of Cu2O or any impurity was identified. Annealing only affected the crystallinity, and there was no change in the phase (CuO) from 200 to 500 °C.

Raman spectroscopy is a commonly used technique to identify the exact phase of a material. According to the group theoretical selection rules, the Cu2O structure only allows a single Raman-active mode (T2g) which corresponds to the broad feature seen at 500–550 cm−1; however, the experimental results reveal some additional peaks at 94, 149, 245 and 645 cm−1.49 Theoretically, there are twelve phonon branches for CuO (because there are four atoms in the primitive cell) in the Raman spectrum, termed Ag + 2Bg + 4Au + 5Bu. The three acoustic modes are of Au + 2Bu symmetry. Of the remaining nine optical modes, three (Ag + 2Bg) are Raman-active (Ag: 298 cm−1, B(1)g: 347 cm−1 and B(2)g: 591 cm−1), and the remaining six (3Au + 3Bu) are IR-active.49,50Fig. 1B shows the Raman spectra of the as-deposited film and the films annealed at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C. The peaks in the Raman spectra of the as-deposited film can be attributed to CuO, Cu(OH)2 and Cu2O, respectively. The peaks for the film annealed at 200 °C can be assigned to CuO, Cu(OH)2 and Cu2O, respectively. There are slight variations in the Raman peak positions of CuO in case of the as-deposited film annealed at 200 °C because the phase transformation was incomplete.51 In the XRD studies, no Cu2O peak was seen for the films may be because Raman spectroscopy is more surface sensitive than XRD, similar results were observed by other researchers.51 The Raman peaks for the annealed film at 300 °C were all assigned to CuO. Similarly, all the Raman peaks observed for the films annealed at 400 and 500 °C were due to CuO. Thus, once the CuO phase was formed at 300 °C, there was no further change in phase with annealing temperature.51 Thus, Raman spectroscopy results reveal that the as-deposited film containing mixed phases of CuO, Cu(OH)2 and Cu2O transforms purely to CuO at 300 °C and remains in that phase up to 500 °C. Peak broadening is seen for the films annealed at 400 and 500 °C compared to that annealed at 300 °C. This may be due to the change in morphology from 300 to 500 °C. The Raman spectrum of the film annealed at 300 °C on SS mesh (Fig. S5, ESI†) proves the confirmation of pure CuO phase.
The chemical composition of the CuO thin film was explored by XPS analysis. The XPS of the Cu2p core level for a CuO thin film (as-deposited film annealed at 300 °C) on flat SS is shown in Fig. 1C(a). The peaks observed at 933.30 and 953.25 eV are consigned to the binding energies of Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2, respectively, which indicates the presence of Cu2+ in the sample. The difference between these two peaks, i.e. the spin–orbit splitting, is about 19.95 eV; this is in agreement with the literature and indicates the formation of CuO.46,51 This is in agreement with the XRD and Raman spectra. In addition, two shake-up (satellite) peaks are seen at 942.58 eV and 961.98 eV; these are found at higher binding energies compared to the main peaks, which originates from the multiple excitations in copper oxides. This indicates the presence of an unfilled Cu3d9 shell and hence proves the existence of Cu2+ in the sample.14 The presence of the satellite peak along with the main peak is a distinctive feature related to CuO phase.52 The deconvolution of the O1s spectrum is also shown in Fig. 1C(b). The O1s spectrum reveals two strong peaks at binding energies of 529.46 and 531.06 eV, which can be allotted to the “O2−” ions of the crystalline network (Cu–O) and the adsorbed oxygen (“O−” species), respectively.53–55
3.3 Morphology and wettability studies

Fig. 2 shows FE-SEM images of the as-deposited film and those annealed at 300, 400 and 500 °C on flat stainless steel substrates. FE-SEM images of CuO (annealed at 300 °C) on SS mesh are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It can be seen that the film entirely covers every fiber of the SS mesh with a grass-like morphology. It can be seen from the micrographs that lumps of hair-like structures were formed in the as-deposited films (A and B). Different morphologies which resemble diverse grass-like structures are seen at 300, 400 and 500 °C annealing temperatures, respectively. Bunches of branched grass-like structures resembling creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra) are observed at 300 °C (Fig. 2C inset), whereas the film annealed at 400 °C (Fig. 2E inset) resembles a free grass leaf (Bermuda grass) and that annealed at 500 °C resembles slightly flowery buffalo grass (Fig. 2G inset). In the as-deposited film, ∼30 atom% fluorine was present; after annealing at 300 °C, the amount became ∼1 atom% due to evaporation (Fig. S7, ESI†).37
 Fig. 2  FE-SEM images of the as-deposited film (A), (B) and the films annealed at 300 °C (C), (D), 400 °C (E), (F) and 500 °C (G), (H) on flat SS with two different magnifications. The insets of (C), (E) and (G) show the resemblance of the morphology to different types of grasses. 
The surface wettability was tested to determine the nature (hydrophilic or hydrophobic) of the thin film surfaces. The contact angle (θ) of the as-deposited film was 123° and that of the film annealed at 300 °C was 30° (Fig. S8, ESI†); this suggests that the surface of the film changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic after annealing, which may be due to changes in the morphology.37 The hydrophilic nature of the CuO film is beneficial to the electrolyte/electrode interface for good performance in electrochemical supercapacitors.13
3.4 Electrochemical studies
As it can be seen in the XRD and Raman spectra, CuO was formed at 300 °C. Hence, the CVs of the films annealed at 300, 400 and 500 °C were recorded to check the electrochemical performance of the annealing effect in 1 M KOH at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The anodic wave for the film annealed at 300 °C is larger, and the film annealed 400 °C shows a larger cathodic wave and much higher reversibility overall. Although the XRD and Raman spectra do not reveal any presence of hydroxide phase, we believe that a minute amount of hydroxide that remained after the phase transformation at 300 °C is responsible for the lower reversibility. The higher annealing temperature of 400 °C caused complete phase transformation to CuO. Considering the large area under the CV curve and, hence, the high specific capacitance, we chose the film annealed at 300 °C for further studies. As can be observed in Fig. 3A, the area under the curve and, thus, the specific capacitance; Cs (9 F g−1, estimated using the relationship in Fig. S9, ESI†)37 reaches the maximum (Fig. 3B) for the film annealed at 300 °C. This may be due to typical distinct morphology of the structures, which resembles bunches of branched grass (Festuca rubra) and may enhance the viable oxidation states.22 The morphology of the film changes after annealing at 300, 400 and 500 °C, resulting in changes in the specific surface area; this can be calculated from the EIS as provided in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†).28,56,57 The variation in the specific surface area may be the reason for the changes in the area under the CV curve and, hence, the changes in specific capacitance. The electrochemical specific surface areas found for the films annealed at 300, 400 and 500 °C were 75, 59 and 31 m2 g−1, respectively. Changes in the specific surface area (from EIS) and, hence, changes in the electrochemical performance of electrodes with different morphologies of Co3O4 and γ-MnO2 have reported elsewhere.56,57 Therefore, hereafter, the film annealed at 300 °C (CuO) was used for all electrochemical experiments.

(B) Specific capacitance with respect to the annealing temperature, (C) CVs of the CuO on flat SS electrode (annealed at 300 °C) in various electrolytes (KOH, Na2SO4, NaOH and LiClO4, all 1 M) at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and (D) specific capacitance of the CuO on flat SS electrode in different electrolytes. 
According to the following electrochemical reaction, the anodic (oxidation) and cathodic (reduction) peaks that appear in the CV correspond to the CuO/Cu2O redox reaction involving transitions between Cu2+ and Cu+.11,12 2CuO + H2O + 2e− ⇄ Cu2O + 2OH−(4)
To choose the best electrolyte, CV measurements were performed for the CuO electrode annealed at 300 °C in various electrolytes, such as KOH, Na2SO4, NaOH and LiClO4 (all 1 M), at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1. From the CVs (Fig. 3C), it can be clearly seen that the highest area under the curve and, hence, the maximum Cs (9 F g−1) was obtained for KOH (Fig. 3D). Therefore, KOH was chosen for further study. The nature of the CV curves is noticeably different in the different electrolytes, arising from the differences in the charge stored during the redox reaction.12 The supercapacitive performance of the electrode strongly depends on the concentration of the electrolyte.37 Vidhyadharan et al. and Wang et al. observed that the maximum Cs is obtained at higher KOH concentrations with an upper bound of 6 M, which is believed to arise from the different specific conductivities (σi) of different concentrations of KOH.12,25 The σi is 626.6 mS cm−1 for 6 M KOH at room temperature.58 Hence, 6 M KOH electrolyte was used for further electrochemical studies.
For 6 M KOH, the CVs were recorded at different scan rates. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, the current density increases with rising scan rate. From the figure, it can also be observed that the anodic peak positions shift towards higher potentials with increasing scan rate. Accordingly, the cathodic peak positions shift towards lower potential with increasing scan rate. It can be noted in Fig. 4B that Cs was maximum (552 F g−1) at the 3 mV s−1 scan rate and monotonically decreased with increasing scan rate.59 This may be because at lower scan rates, the electrolyte ions are completely diffused into the material; therefore, the entire active surface of the material can be consumed for charge storage, whereas at high scan rates, diffusion limits the movement of electrolyte ions due to the time constraints, and only the outer active surface is utilized for charge storage. The decrease in Cs can be ascribed to the presence of inner active sites that cannot fully withstand the redox transitions at higher scan rates. Therefore, the Cs obtained at the slowest scan rate is assumed to be the closest to that of full consumption of the electrode material. In the case of CuO, the capacitance values arise mainly from faradaic reactions, which is a more “battery-like” than pseudocapacitive process according to some researchers.60
 Fig. 4  (A) CVs and (B) change of specific capacitance with scan rate of CuO on a flat SS electrode and (C) CVs and (D) variation of the specific capacitance with scan rate of CuO on mesh SS electrode, in 6 M KOH at different scan rates (3–200 mV s−1). 
For CuO on SS mesh, the CVs were recorded at different scan rates, as shown in Fig. 4C. Similar to the flat SS substrate, the Cs of CuO on SS mesh decreases with increasing scan rate (Fig. 4D). The maximum Cs value obtained was 849 F g−1 at 3 mV s−1. Table 1 gives a comparison of the specific capacitance values obtained in the present work from cyclic voltammetry for the CuO thin film electrode on flat and mesh SS with those in the available literature. The significant increase in the specific capacitance value on SS mesh can be credited to the high surface area of the mesh.38 The surface area of SS mesh is allied with the diameter of the mesh wire and the aperture between the wires and open structure of the mesh. The open pore structure has two benefits: first, it offers efficient ion diffusion pathways, and second, it increases the penetration of the electrolyte and the ionic transport within the material.36 Mesh is classified in terms of mesh number, which is the number of lines of mesh per inch with various wire diameters and pore sizes (space between adjacent wires). Zhang et al. calculated the surface areas of stainless steel mesh with various mesh numbers.61 In the present report, SS mesh no. 200 with wire diameter 0.005 cm and pore size 0.008 cm was used, and the estimated surface area was found to be 14.86 cm2. Also, the specific surface area obtained from EIS for the CuO mesh SS electrode is 105 m2 g−1, which is higher than that for the CuO flat SS electrode (75 m2 g−1).

The usefulness of an electrode can be analyzed by its stability and reversibility. The electrochemical cyclic stability was tested for 5000 cycles of CuO on flat and mesh SS. Fig. 5A and C show the CVs for the 1st, 100th, 1000th and 5000th cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for CuO on flat and mesh SS, respectively. The area under the curve continually decreases from the 1st cycle to the 5000th cycle. The variation of the specific capacitance with cycle number reveals that the specific capacitance mostly decreases steadily with increasing cycle number (Fig. 5B and D). Table 1 shows a comparison of the cyclic stabilities of the CuO on flat and mesh electrodes with those in the literature. The cyclic stability is improved in the case of the CuO mesh electrode compared with the CuO flat electrode. Compared with the literature, the cyclic stability for 5000 cycles is average; however, it can be improved by increasing the loading mass or by combining the film with carbon-based materials. The falloff in the capacitance value may be due to dissolution of the electrode active material11,37 in the electrolyte (at a very high concentration of 6 M) and capacity inequalities between the electrodes, which decrease the stability of the electrode potential. The capacitance can be seen to be saturated for the last 1000 to 1500 cycles. Also, minor changes in the morphology after scanning for a large number of cycles (Fig. S11, ESI†) may be the reason for the decrease in Cs.

The GCD curves were recorded for CuO on flat and mesh SS at different current densities of 2, 3, and 4 mA cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 6A and D, respectively. The charging–discharging time is longer for CuO film on SS mesh compared to that on the flat SS substrate. The measured charging and discharging curves are not perfectly straight lines, signifying that the observed capacitive behavior is a result of the faradaic redox reaction.11 The coulombic efficiencies for CuO on flat and mesh SS are 56 and 60%, respectively. There is a possibility of irreversible reactions during the charging process because the time for charging is higher than that for discharging in the GCD curves (Fig. 6A and D), which leads to low coulombic efficiencies.

(D) The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different current densities in 6 M KOH. (E) Specific capacitance vs. current density and (F) Ragone plot of the CuO on mesh SS electrode. 
The specific capacitance, Cs, was also calculated from the charge–discharge curves using the relations given in Fig. S9 (ESI†).59Fig. 6B and E illustrate the variation of the specific capacitance as a function of the current densities of CuO film on flat and mesh SS, respectively. As the current density increases from 2 to 4 mA cm−2 for the flat SS substrate, the specific capacitance decreases from 22 to 17 F g−1; meanwhile, that for mesh SS substrate decreases from 59 to 45 F g−1 due to the redox reactions occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The decreasing specific capacitance with increasing current density is a result of the fact that high current decreases the electrolyte ion diffusion and migration within the electrode material; as a result, only part of the electrode material remains active.62 In the discharging curves, a much lower iR drop is seen, which increases with increasing current density because of the ohmic resistance of the electrode.63 This indicates good interfacial contact between the active material and the substrate during charging/discharging.11 The charging–discharging results are compared with the literature in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The specific energy (SE) in W h kg−1 and the specific power (SP) in W kg−1 were calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves as given in Fig. S9 (ESI†).59Fig. 6C and F show the plots of SE versus SP (Ragone plot) for CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates, respectively. For CuO on flat SS, at current densities of 2, 3 and 4 mA cm−2, SP increases from 1450 to 3220 W kg−1 and SE decreases from 1.05 to 0.96 W h kg−1, respectively. For CuO on mesh SS substrate, at current densities of 2, 3 and 4 mA cm−2, SP increases from 1036 to 2286 W kg−1 and SE decreases from 2.7 to 2.5 W h kg−1, respectively. It is evident that the supercapacitive performance of CuO deposited on SS mesh is significantly improved compared to that on the flat SS substrate. The areal capacitance was calculated from the CV and GCD curves. From the CV (at 3 mV s−1), the areal capacitance was 0.21 F cm−2 on flat SS and 0.48 F cm−2 on mesh SS. From the GCD (2 mA cm−2), it was 0.009 F cm−2 on flat SS and 0.03276 F cm−2 on mesh SS.
To study the fundamental behavior of an electrode material in an electrolyte EIS is a good technique. The EIS measurements were performed at room temperature. The Nyquist impedance plots of CuO on flat and mesh SS were tested in the frequency range from 0.01 to 105 Hz with a signal amplitude of 0.01 V at 0.3 V; the equivalent circuit used to fit the Nyquist impedance plots is shown in Fig. 7A. Fig. 7B displays enlargement of the high frequency regions. The imaginary part of the impedance spectrum sharply increases in the lower frequency region, demonstrating the supercapacitive behavior of the CuO electrode.37 The plot was linear (mid and low frequency regions) along with a small semicircle (high frequency region) due to the redox reaction between Cu2+ and Cu+. Owing to the electronic and ionic resistances, Rs was observed (initial intersecting point of the semicircle with the real axis). Rct is the charge transfer resistance of the redox reaction and signifies the kinetic resistance to the ion transfer, which is the diameter of the semicircle; ESR is the equivalent series resistance.12 The low values of Rs and Rct indicate stable electrochemical behavior (better ionic conduction and diffusion of the electrolyte into the electrode material). In the low frequency part, the straight line bends more towards the imaginary axis, which reflects the good capacitive behavior of the electrode material.37Table 2 shows the calculated values of Rs, Rct, knee frequency, ESR and τ for CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates.

For the mesh SS substrate, Rs, Rct and ESR decrease and the knee frequency increases compared to those for the flat substrate. The smaller ESR is advantageous for decreasing ohmic losses during discharge.36 The total capacitance can be stated as a combination of the real C′ component (stored charge as a function of frequency, which depends on the nature of the electrolyte, mass loading and porosity of the material) and imaginary C′′ component (dissipation of energy during charge storage). The real component (C′) and imaginary component (C′′) of the capacitance were determined from the EIS curves by the relations specified in Fig. S9 (ESI†).12,64Fig. 7C and D shows the curves of C′ and C′′ against logf for the CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates. C′ asymptotically decreases with increasing frequency12 for CuO on both flat and mesh SS substrates. The maximum value of C′ for CuO is 15 F g−1 on flat and 21 F g−1 on mesh SS substrates. These values do not match the previous calculated specific capacitances from CV and charging–discharging because during the EIS measurements, the deeply trapped ions remain immobile. From the bell-shaped nature of the plot of C′′ vs. logf, the particular peak frequency at which shifting from purely resistive to capacitive is distinguished and defined as the relaxation time constant τ (τ = 1/f), which is considered to be a merit factor of a supercapacitor. The relaxation time constants for CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates are 144 and 283 ms, respectively. Fig. 7E and F shows the Bode plots (phase angle versus logf) for CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates. For the ideal performance of supercapacitor, the phase angle should be exactly −90° at lower frequencies. For CuO on the flat and mesh SS substrates, the phase angles from the graphs are −80 and −79°, respectively, which indicate the good capacitive properties of the electrodes. At a phase angle of −45°, the resistive and capacitive impedances are identical.8 Hence, by taking the projection at −45°, the relaxation time constants (τ = 1/f) were also calculated from the Bode plots.8 The time constants for CuO on flat and mesh SS substrates derived from the Bode plots are 126 and 195 ms, respectively. These values are comparable with the values obtained from the plots of C′′ vs. logf. The low relaxation time constant confirms the typical fast charging–discharging property of a supercapacitor. Also, the smaller τ of the CuO electrode provides high power density due to the capability of faster energy release.65
3.5 Evaluation of the fabricated symmetric CuO device
To test the hands-on application of the electrode, focus was given to device fabrication. After examining the CuO electrodes (flat and mesh SS substrates) in a three-electrode system, the CuO on mesh SS substrate electrode proved to be better; hence, it was chosen for assembly of the device. The performance of the fabricated symmetric device was evaluated in a two-electrode system. CV of the symmetric device was carried out at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in different potential ranges (0 to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 V) in the direction to optimize the potential window. The area under the curve increased with increasing potential up to 1.2 V; afterwards, for 1.4 V, the shape of the CV changed with extreme current changes (Fig. S13A and B, ESI†). Hence, the range of 0 to 1.2 V was selected for further measurements. The CVs were recorded at different scan rates (5–200 mV s−1). As shown in Fig. 8A, the current density rises with rising scan rate and the nature of the curve remains the same. It was noted that Cs decreased with increasing scan rate. The maximum specific capacitance was 22 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 8B), which is better than the maximum specific capacitance of ∼9.5 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 reported in the literature.23

The electrochemical cyclic stability was tested for 1000 cycles of the CuO symmetric device. Fig. 8C shows the CVs for the 1st, 100th, 500th and 1000th cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The area under the curve decreases slightly from the 1st cycle to the 1000th cycle. The variation of the specific capacitance with cycle number at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 reveals that the specific capacitance mostly decreases slowly up to 200 cycles and then remains stable with increasing cycle number (Fig. 8D). The fabricated CuO symmetric device shows cyclic stability of ∼80% for 1000 cycles. A. V. Shinde et al. reported ∼90% stability for a CuO symmetric device.23
Charging–discharging was also tested at currents of 2–5 mA and the specific capacitance was determined, as shown in Fig. 8E and F. The maximum specific capacitance was 3.4 F g−1 at 2 mA. The maximum specific energy (SE) was 0.6 W h kg−1, and the specific power (SP) was 1339 W kg−1 calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves, as shown in the Ragone plot (Fig. 8G). Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows a comparison of the CuO-based symmetric devices with the literature. For the CuO symmetric device, the coulombic efficiency was 66%.
The Nyquist impedance plot was tested in the frequency range from 0.01 to 105 Hz with 0.01 V signal amplitude, as shown in Fig. 8H. The inset shows the enlarged figure from which the Rs (1.2 Ω) and ESR (2 Ω) were found. Fig. 8I shows the curves of C′ and C′′ vs. logf for the CuO symmetric device. The maximum value of C′ was 0.2 F g−1 at 0.01 Hz. The relaxation time constant for the CuO symmetric device was 1.08 ms. Fig. 8J shows the Bode plot for the CuO symmetric device. The phase angle determined from the graph was −82°, which indicates decent capacitive properties of the device. The time constant from the Bode plot was 0.83 ms, which is comparable with the value obtained from the plot of C′′ vs. logf.
The actual demonstration of the fabricated symmetric device can be seen in Fig. S15A (ESI†). For this, the device was charged with a 9 V battery for 30 s and the battery was then disconnected. The voltage was checked on a digital multimeter and noted at intervals of 1 minute. The voltage decreased from 0.99 to 0.1 V in 60 min (Fig. S15B, ESI†). The device performance can be further enhanced by optimizing the electrolyte gel and separator.
4 Conclusions
In summary, CuO films were successfully deposited on flat and mesh SS substrates by liquid phase deposition (LPD) followed by annealing. The XRD and Raman studies revealed complete CuO phase formation after annealing at 300 °C. The FE-SEM images showed distinct ‘bunch of grass’-type morphologies. The wettability tests revealed that due to annealing, the nature of the film transformed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The highest values of specific capacitance found from cyclic voltammetry were 552 F g−1 for the flat SS substrate and 849 F g−1 for the mesh SS substrate at 3 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the specific capacitance obtained from the cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge curves of CuO electrode nearly doubled upon changing from the flat to the mesh SS substrate. Also, the CuO deposited on SS mesh was a more efficient and flexible electrode for a supercapacitor due to its increased surface area compared to the flat SS substrate. The fabrication and demonstration of the CuO symmetric device were carried out successfully. The obtained results reveal that the CuO films prepared by the LPD method are affordable and have great potential as electrodes for supercapacitors.
