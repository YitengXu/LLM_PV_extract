    , Accepted 6th December 2017First published on 6th December 2017AbstractOrganic molecules with wide absorption spectra exhibit great sunlight harvesting capability and are critically important for solar cell applications. In this manuscript, we develop an A–D–A′–D–A type small molecule acceptor (IID-IC) using isoindigo (IID) as the electron-deficient core unit (A′), thiophene as the electron-rich bridging units (D) and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the electron-deficient endcapping groups (A). IID-IC shows a wide absorption spectrum with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 190 nm, which is almost twice that of a typical A–D–A type molecule acceptor. The wide absorption spectrum of IID-IC is possibly due to the partially suppressed intramolecular charge transfer effect with the additional electron-deficient core unit. An organic solar cell (OSC) device based on IID-IC exhibits the power conversion efficiency of 2.82% with broad photoresponse from 320 nm to 780 nm.
Organic molecules with wide absorption spectra are critically important for a variety of applications, such as solar cells, photodetectors, photocatalysis, etc.1 As organic molecules generally show one strong absorption band with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 50–150 nm, narrow absorption spectra limit the light harvesting capability of organic molecules for the aforementioned applications. Therefore, great attention needs to be paid to the development of organic molecules with wide absorption spectra, e.g., panchromatic absorption molecules.2 To date, only a few organic panchromatic molecules have been reported, such as phthalocyanine complexes,2a porphyrin derivatives,2b squaraine dyes2c and two-dimensional conjugated compounds,2detc.
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) use blends of organic/polymer electron donors and electron acceptors as the active layer. They have the great advantages of solution processing, low cost and flexibility.3 Before 2013, the most-widely used electron acceptors are fullerene derivatives.4 Fullerene derivatives suffer from poor sunlight absorption capability and limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. Recently, scientists have developed many non-fullerene small molecule acceptors with superior OSC device performance.5–7 The most widely used strategy to design small molecule acceptors is via A–D–A type molecules, in which a bulky electron-rich core unit (D) is flanked by two electron-deficient end groups (A).8 A typical example of an A–D–A type molecule acceptor is 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) (see Fig. 1a) reported by Zhan et al.5a Small molecule acceptors exhibit narrow absorption spectra with one strong sunlight absorption band, which is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer from the D unit to the A groups.9 For example, the FWHM of the absorption spectrum of ITIC is 95 nm (Fig. 1a).5a It is very desirable but challenging to develop small molecule acceptors with wide absorption spectra for superior sunlight harvesting capability.

In this manuscript, we report an A–D–A′–D–A type small molecule acceptor, in which an additional electron-deficient unit (A′) is used as the core. Fig. 1b shows the chemical structure of the molecule, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((5,5′-((E)-1,1′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-2,2′-dioxo-[3,3′-biindolinylidene]-6,6′-diyl)bis(4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IID-IC). An electron deficient isoindigo (IID) unit acts as the core, linked with two electron-rich thiophene units and end-capped with two electron deficient 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) groups. IID-IC shows a broad absorption spectrum with the FWHM of 190 nm (see Fig. 1b) possibly due to the partially suppressed intramolecular charge transfer effect with the additional A′ core unit.9 We also demonstrate the application of the A–D–A′–D–A type small molecule acceptor in OSC devices. These results suggest a new strategy to design small molecule electron acceptors with superior sunlight harvesting capability.

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic route of IID-IC. Starting from 3-(2-butyloctyl)thiophene, bromination and the subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction afforded 3. The alkylation of dibromo-isoindigo followed by the Pd(0)-catalyzed boron ester reaction gave 6. The Suzuki coupling of 6 and 3 afforded 7. Finally, IID-IC was synthesized using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction in 80% yield. The chemical structure of IID-IC was fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (MS) and elemental analysis. IID-IC exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggests that IID-IC has good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss of 351 °C (Fig. S3a, ESI†). According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement, IID-IC exhibits the melting temperature (Tm) of 213 °C in the heating process and the crystallization temperature (Tc) of 169 °C in the cooling process (Fig. S3b, ESI†).

(Reagents and conditions: (i) N-bromosuccinimide, dichloromethane/chloroform, r.t.; (ii) lithium diisopropylamide, tetrahydrofuran, −78 °C, then N,N-dimethylformamide, −78 °C to r.t.; (iii) 5-(bromomethyl)-undecane, potassium carbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide, 100 °C; (iv) bis(pinacolato)diboron, [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium, potassium acetate, 1,4-dioxane, 80 °C; (v) 3, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, potassium carbonate, tetrahydrofuran, 75 °C; and (vi) IC, pyridine, chloroform, 65 °C.) 

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of IID-IC in CB solution and in thin films. In solution, IID-IC shows two absorption peaks at 570 nm and 501 nm with the maximum extinction coefficient of 7.7 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1. In thin films, the absorption spectrum of IID-IC exhibits a very wide band spanning from 400 nm to 740 nm with a peak at 608 nm and a shoulder at 518 nm. The FWHM of the absorption spectrum of IID-IC is 190 nm, which is twice that of ITIC (FWHM = 95 nm).5a The wide absorption spectrum suggests that IID-IC has excellent sunlight harvesting capability. According to the onset wavelength of the absorption spectrum in films, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of IID-IC is calculated to be ca. 1.71 eV.

To investigate the reason for the wide absorption spectrum of IID-IC, we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to simulate its absorption spectrum.10 For clarity, the long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl. The detailed results are provided in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 2a, the long wavelength absorption band is attributed to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) → the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition, i.e. the intramolecular charge transfer.9 The short wavelength absorption band mainly comes from the transitions of HOMO−4 → LUMO, HOMO−2 → LUMO, HOMO−2 → LUMO+2, HOMO → LUMO+2, HOMO−3 → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO+1. Typical A–D–A type molecule acceptors exhibit only one strong absorption band in the long wavelength region, which is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer from D to A (HOMO → LUMO transition). For the A–D–A′–D–A type molecule, IID-IC, the additional IID core unit partially disturbs the intramolecular charge transfer and partially suppresses the HOMO → LUMO transition. Therefore, both the HOMO → LUMO transition with long wavelength absorption and other transitions with short wavelength absorption co-exist, leading to the wide absorption spectrum of IID-IC.
As shown in Fig. 2b, the cyclic voltammogram of IID-IC in films shows both oxidation and reduction waves. According to the onset oxidation/reduction potential, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of IID-IC are estimated to be −3.95 eV and −5.99 eV, respectively. The inset of Fig. 2b shows the energy level alignment of IID-IC and a typical polymer electron donor, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-dodecylthio)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(5,6-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl))-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole)] (J61).11 The low-lying LUMO and HOMO energy levels of IID-IC indicate that it can be used as an electron acceptor in OSCs.1a The electron mobility of IID-IC was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the electron-only device (device structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/IID-IC/Ca/Al). The electron mobility of IID-IC is estimated to be 1.04 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.
To evaluate the application of IID-IC as an electron acceptor, we selected J61 as a polymer electron donor and fabricated OSC devices with the configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/J61:IID-IC/Ca/Al (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The active layer was spin-coated with the solution of J61 and IID-IC (weight ratio: 1/1.3) in o-DCB containing 0.8 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE). Fig. 3 shows the J–V curve under AM 1.5G illumination and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve of the device. The device shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.83 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 6.36 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.53, corresponding to the PCE of 2.82%. The preliminary photovoltaic performance indicates that IID-IC can be used as an electron acceptor material for OSCs. The EQE curve of the device exhibits photoresponse in the wide range from 320 nm to 780 nm with the maximum value of 34% at 660 nm. The JSC value calculated from the integration of the EQE spectrum agrees well with the value obtained from the J–V scan.

The preliminary OSC device performance of IID-IC is indeed inferior to that of ITIC reported in the literature.5a This stimulates us to systematically analyze the OSC device of IID-IC. We used the SCLC method to estimate the charge transporting properties of the device (Fig. S7, ESI†). The hole mobility and electron mobility of the J61:IID-IC active layer are calculated to be 1.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole/electron mobilities are relatively high and balanced. We also studied the J61:IID-IC active layer morphology using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As can be seen in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the surface of the blend film is smooth and no large-size phase separation is observed. According to the JSCversus light density (P) curve of the OSC device (Fig. S8a, ESI†), bimolecular charge recombination under the short circuit conditions is negligible.12 Based on the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curve (Fig. S8b, ESI†), the exciton dissociation probability in the J61:IID-IC OSC device is 60.6%.13 The ineffective exciton dissociation may lead to low JSC and low FF of the J61:IID-IC OSC device. We also fabricated the control device using [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor (Fig. S11, ESI†). The PCE of the optimized device of J61:PC71BM is 5.81% with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 9.59 mA cm−2, and an FF of 72.0%. The preliminary device performance of IID-IC is inferior to that of PC71BM, which is possibly due to the sub-optimal blend morphology of J61:IID-IC.
In conclusion, we have developed an A–D–A′–D–A type small molecule acceptor using IID as the core unit, thiophene as the donor units and IC as the endcapping groups. IID-IC shows a wide absorption spectrum with the FWHM of 190 nm, which is twice that of the typical A–D–A type molecule acceptor, ITIC. The wide absorption spectrum of IID-IC is possibly due to the partially suppressed intramolecular charge transfer effect with the additional A′ core unit. The OSC device of IID-IC exhibits the PCE of 2.82% with the broad photoresponse from 320 nm to 780 nm. These results suggest that A–D–A′–D–A is an effective strategy to design small molecule electron acceptors with superior sunlight harvesting capability.
