Introduction
Semiconductor-based photocatalysts have attracted significant attention for solar energy conversion, synthesis of value-added chemicals, environmental remediation, antimicrobial applications, and many other critical catalytic processes.1,2 The efficiency of photocatalysis is dependent on the electronic band structures of semiconductors. Particularly, the sufficient light irradiation of semiconductors can generate photo-excitons. With suitable trapping sites, the photo-excited electrons (e−) and holes (h+) can be separated, and then diffuse to the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of semiconductors, respectively, inducing strong reactivities for various types of redox reactions depending on both the CB and VB edge positions. Nevertheless, many semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, and BiOCl) can only be activated by ultraviolet light due to their relatively wide bandgap, indicating that photocatalytic reactions are inhibited under visible light irradiation, which occupies approximately 43% of the solar spectrum.3–9 Therefore, the exploitation of semiconductors with narrower bandgaps is a research hotspot for efficient solar energy harvesting, conversion, and applications.7,10–14 Moreover, engineering the VB and CB band positions of semiconductors is favorable to enhance the generation of energetic electrons or holes and improve the thermodynamics of selected redox reactions.7,10–14 Doping and surface functionalization are effective approaches to alter the bandgap energies of wide-band-gap semiconductors and induce visible-light-driven photocatalytic performances. Visible-light responses can also be achieved based on semiconductors intrinsically bearing narrow energy bandgaps, such as CdS, TaON, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), which seems to be more suitable to promote photocatalytic reactions under visible light irradiation.15–18
As a narrow-band-gap semiconductor, g-C3N4 has provoked the most intensive interest among the reported visible-light photocatalytic candidates.19–23 The atomic arrangements and energy band structures of g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The most energy favorable g-C3N4 is composed of tri-s-triazine units linked with N atoms and exhibits an energy bandgap of 2.7 eV with its CB and VB positions located at −1.3 and 1.4 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The emerging g-C3N4 photocatalyst demonstrates many advantages, including facile synthesis, low cost, and unique properties. In particular, g-C3N4 can be easily prepared via the thermal polymerization of precursors (including urea, melamine, dicyanamide, thiourea, and their combinations).20–23 Besides, g-C3N4, comprising earth-abundant elements (i.e., carbon and nitrogen) is also readily available and economical.24 More strikingly, the bandgap of g-C3N4 is approximately 2.7 eV, making it responsive to visible light with a wavelength of up to 450 nm.25,26 Besides, the appealing electronic structure that endows g-C3N4 with strong redox ability,27,28 also possesses high thermal, chemical, and photo stabilities, which are critical for the practical implementation of photocatalysts.29 As a non-metal-based photocatalyst, it can also avoid the problems encountered by metal-based photocatalysts, such as environmental threat due to the leaching of toxic metals and ready passivation by CO toxification, methanol crossover, etc.30

Since the first report by Wang et al.31 concerning water splitting, g-C3N4 has attracted intense attention in various photocatalytic conversions and purifications. A growing number of reports regarding g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and their applications have been published since 2009, as shown in Fig. 1c. However, pristine g-C3N4 with a bandgap energy of 2.7 eV cannot harvest the majority of solar light energy efficiently (i.e., only visible light below 450 nm can be utilized). Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons and holes in pristine g-C3N4 rapidly recombine due to the lack of trapping sites for photo-excitons. Moreover, pristine g-C3N4, which is usually prepared by the thermal treatment of various precursors (such as melamine and dicyandiamide), suffers from a low surface area and active site density. These disadvantages cause pristine g-C3N4 to possess low photocatalytic activities, thus restricting its large-scale implementation.32 Therefore, it is highly desirable to engineer the intrinsic structure of g-C3N4 to ameliorate its visible-light-photocatalytic performances.
Various strategies have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performances of pristine g-C3N4, including foreign element doping, vacancy modification, plasmon metal coupling, dye sensitization, and heterojunction construction.27,33–38 The introduction of nitrogen/carbon vacancies (Nv/Cv) is one of the most effective approaches to narrow the bandgap, inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs, increase the specific surface area and active site density, and shorten the transport paths for carries and reactants in g-C3N4. The typical examples of Nv-modified g-C3N4 (Nv-g-C3N4) and Cv-modified g-C3N4 (Cv-g-C3N4) are shown in Fig. 1d and e, respectively. The incorporation of Nv and Cv can well mediate the physical, atomic, and energy-band structures of Nv-g-C3N4 (Fig. 1d) and Cv-g-C3N4, respectively. Also, the specific surface area of g-C3N4 can be increased due to the incorporation of Nv (inset of Fig. 1d). Consequently, the exploration of nitrogen vacancy (Nv)/carbon vacancy (Cv)-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Nv-g-C3N4/Cv-g-C3N4) has become a research hotspot worldwide.
Due to the fascinating physicochemical and electronic structures of vacancy-modified g-C3N4 brought by Nv and Cv, a growing number of reports has focused on vacancy-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts over recent years, as shown in Fig. 1f. However, although some review papers have recently been devoted to discussing vacancy-modified g-C3N4,39–41 there is still a lack of critical overview and perspective in clarifying the specific roles of Nv and Cv in mediating g-C3N4 towards the promotion of various photocatalytic applications. Meanwhile, the cooperation effects from heteroatom doping, morphology regulation to increase the porosity and specific surface area, and incorporation of surface functional groups need to be critically discussed, together with the elucidation of the structure and photocatalytic performance variations enabled by vacancies in g-C3N4. Herein, we present a comprehensive review on the recent development of g-C3N4 photocatalysts with structure-engineered Nv/Cv modification together with other beneficial structural tuning aspects. Specifically, we first introduce the types and structure of vacancy-modified g-C3N4, the identification of vacancies introduced in g-C3N4, and the critical role of the incorporated vacancies in the structural engineering of g-C3N4 and its corresponding photocatalytic performances. In addition, the recent advances in the strategies to realize the modification of g-C3N4 with Nv, Cv, and functional groups, and their combination and porous architecture engineering, heteroatom doping, texture and surface area mediation, and their combinations are presented. A broad spectrum of important application fields is reviewed based on these modified g-C3N4, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, NO removal, pollutant degradation, selective oxidation of alcohols, and H2O2 production. Finally, we conclude with future challenges and opportunities for developing highly active vacancy-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts. We also present a scheme to illustrate the main content of this review paper in Fig. 2.

Types and critical roles of vacancies in the structural modification of g-C3N4
Types of vacancies introduced in g-C3N4
The highly crystalline g-C3N4, which is mainly constructed by C and N atoms, possesses a C/N atomic ratio approaching 0.75 (Fig. 3a). Selectively eliminating C or N atoms from the g-C3N4 framework introduces Cv or Nv, respectively.44 In the energetically favored structure of g-C3N4 arranged by tri-s-triazine units, the carbon atoms are located at the terminal C-N3 sites, with C1 connecting three tri-s-triazines and C2 at the edges of each tri-s-triazine. Although carbon is selectively removed, Cv is located at the C-N3 sites, with the emergence of amino groups, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Given that three N configurations (amino groups, pyridinic N, and graphitic N) exist in the g-C3N4 framework, the removal of N atoms results in more types of Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Fig. 3d–f). When pyridinic N atoms are removed, Nv (i.e., N2c) is located at the CN-C sites, and the adjacent C atoms bond H atoms to form hydrocarbons species.45 The Nv (N3c) located at the N-C3 sites increases the number of unpaired electrons in the adjacent C atoms when the graphitic N atoms are removed.46 The Nv is located at the amino group sites upon removing amino groups.27

Identification of Nv and Cv in g-C3N4
The introduction of Cv or Nv in the g-C3N4 framework changes its atomic arrangement and local chemical groups. Accordingly, many characterization methods can be employed for the identification of the type of introduced vacancies, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis (EA), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We present a detailed discussion with respect to the use of a range of characterization approaches to identify the different types of vacancies introduced in g-C3N4 in the following subsections.

Identification of Cv. 
The XRD peaks of the Cv-modified g-C3N4, which are assigned to the in-plane structural packing motif and interlayer stacking, are weakened and shift to a slightly higher 2θ value compared to that of its pristine counterpart.34 The FT-IR spectra of Cv-modified g-C3N4 show that the band at 810 cm−1 indexed to the bending vibration of the tri-s-triazine units and the C–N heterocycles associated with the bands in the range of 1200–1700 cm−1 are not changed upon the incorporation of Cv. Nevertheless, the intensity of the peak at 3200 cm−1 (corresponding to amino groups) increases due to the removal of tertiary carbon and the concomitant formation of more amino groups.47 EDX characterization clearly shows that the C/N atomic ratio decreases with the introduction of Cv in the g-C3N4 framework.48 XPS results reveal that the C 1s-to-N 1s peak ratio decreases, while that of amino groups to graphitic N increases for the Cv-modified g-C3N4. The binding energy of C 1s of the CN–C configuration slightly shifts positively due to the redistribution of extra electrons left by the missed carbon atoms.49 The EPR signal at the g value of approximately 2.0043 can be attributed to the unpaired electrons of the aromatic carbon atoms in the aromatic rings, which is consistent with previous reports.34,50 Thus, the removal of some carbon atoms from the aromatic rings of the g-C3N4 framework by introducing Cv can likely reduce the number of unpaired electrons, and thus lower the typical EPR signal intensity.


Identification of amino vacancies. 
XRD characterization of g-C3N4−x with amino vacancies reveals a slight shift in the characteristic peak from 27.3° (for the pristine g-C3N4) to 27.5°, indicating a decrease in the interplanar stacking distance from 0.326 to 0.324 nm.51 The characterization results obtained via EA show that the N/C atomic ratio decreases with the removal of amino groups. XPS results show that the peak area ratio of amino groups (NNHx) to graphitic (N3c) decreases with the introduction of amino group vacancies.27,52


Identification of N2c vacancies. 
The XRD patterns show that the distinct peaks observed for g-C3N4 become weakened and shift to higher 2θ angles after the removal of the N2c atoms, implying a progressively shorter interlayer stacking distance and a loss of ordered structures in the framework.45 The results obtained via EA reveal that the N/C atomic ratio decreases with the removal of N2c atoms. XPS results show that the pyridinic N (N2c)-to-graphitic N (N3c) and N 1s-to-C 1s peak area ratios decrease with the introduction of N2c vacancies. The removal of the N2c atom leads to a new minor peak at approximately 286.1 eV, which is ascribed to the NCH–N binding structure.53 The missing N2c-atom and extra-electron redistribution shift the N3c binding energy from 400.3 to 400.6 eV.54 The EPR signals from the unpaired electrons of the aromatic C atoms are markedly enhanced after introducing N2c vacancies. The two-coordinated Nv formed can donate unpaired electrons to the adjacent C atoms in the π-conjugated aromatic rings.55 Alternatively, the 13C resonances shift to lower chemical shifts for the N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 relative to the pristine g-C3N4, and the intensity of the peak at −260.3 ppm (corresponding to the 15N NMR of N2c) is significantly reduced.56


Identification of N3c vacancies. 
The incorporation of N3c vacancies in g-C3N4 depresses the N-to-C atomic ratio, the peak area ratio of N3c and NHx to N2c, and the N3c-to-NHx ratio based on XPS results. The binding energy of N2c and NHx shifts to a lower energy, while that of N3c shifts oppositely, resulting from electron redistribution after removing N3c atoms.57 The EPR signal generated from the unpaired electrons of the aromatic C atoms notably intensifies after the introduction of N3c vacancies. The three-coordinated Nv can donate unpaired electrons to the adjacent sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in the π-conjugated aromatic rings in the g-C3N4 framework, thus increasing the EPR signal intensity relative to pristine g-C3N4.46


Identification of Nv and Cv in Nv-Cv-co-modified g-C3N4. 
Typically, the co-existence of Nv and Cv can be proven by the N/C ratio of the co-modified g-C3N4 sample estimated from XPS measurements and the comparison of its single Nv- or Cv-modified g-C3N4 counterparts. For example, Zhang et al.58 recently adopted XPS spectra to measure the N/C rations for the Nv-g-C3N4, Cv-g-C3N4, and Nv-Cv-co-modified g-C3N4 samples, which were calculated to be 1.13, 1.51, and 1.32, respectively, in contrast to 1.33 for the bulk g-C3N4 sample. The separate removal of N and C atoms from g-C3N4 decreases and increases the N/C ratio, respectively, while the simultaneous removal of N and C atoms results in a similar N/C ratio to that of bulk g-C3N4. Moreover, it was also verified that the Nv-Cv-co-modified g-C3N4 sample exhibited a significantly lower N2c/N3c atomic ratio compared with the bulk g-C3N4 (2.10 vs. 3.00), thus demonstrating that Nv was present and mainly located at the N2c sites in the lattice of g-C3N4. To keep the N/C ratio of the Nv-Cv-co-modified g-C3N4 sample similar to that of the bulk g-C3N4 (1.32 vs. 1.33), Cv should also be simultaneously formed. Consequently, the co-existence of Nv and Cv is effectively evidenced by these results obtained via XPS measurements.

Critical roles of Nv vacancies in photocatalytic performance enhancement
The introduced Nv vacancies in the framework can significantly enhance the photocatalytic performance by modifying the band structure of g-C3N4, enhancing the electron and hole separation efficiency, increasing the porosity and surface area, etc.

Modifying band structure and increasing visible-light absorption. 
Upon the introduction of N2c vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework, it shows a gradual red-shifted absorption edge. Besides, N2c vacancies result in a mid-gap state in the band gap and a strong absorption tail (Urbach tail) in the visible-light region. The Urbach tail edge is gradually red-shifted to a longer wavelength with an increase in the Nv density (Fig. 1d).42 The introduction N3c vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework leads to an evident redshift and an extended band tail to 800 nm. N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 exhibits a red-shifted adsorption edge and increased visible light absorbance with an increase in N3c vacancies.46 For the introduction of NHx vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework, the absorption edges of the resulting NHx vacancy-modified g-C3N4 samples are significantly red-shifted, and the bandgap energies decrease from 2.70 eV for g-C3N4 to 2.06 eV for the NHx vacancy-modified g-C3N4 sample with a higher content of NHx vacancies.27

Enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes
Tu et al. investigated the role of N2c vacancies in photocatalytic H2 evolution and CO2 reduction.55 Although Nv tends to drive electrons to mid-gap states below the CB edge, resulting in an extension of the visible-light absorption, the appropriate mid-gap states can trap photogenerated electrons to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 samples were synthesized via the thermal treatment of acetic acid-treated melamine, where N3c vacancies play a remarkable role in extending the optical absorption range and enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Consequently, improved photocatalytic activity was achieved for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) over N3c-g-C3N4, which was 2.3 times higher than that by g-C3N4.59 In addition, due to their ability to act as electron or hole trapping centers, NHx vacancies promoted the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and therefore the photocatalytic performance of the Nv-g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) in the aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols with molecular O2 under simulated sunlight, in contrast to that of pristine g-C3N4.27

Changing the morphology and increasing the porosity and surface area. 
The introduction of Nv in the g-C3N4 framework usually changes its texture, porosity, and surface area, which can significantly affect its photocatalytic performances. For example, the surface area of a N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 catalyst was 95.2 m2 g−1, which was higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (70.6 m2 g−1). The pore size distribution curves of the defective g-C3N4 showed that it was rich in pores with a diameter in the range of 1–30 nm. This smaller-sized lamellar morphology and increased surface area were favorable for photocatalysis given that more reaction interfaces were exposed.42 The mesoporous texture of N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 could increase its specific area and provide more active sites. The combined effect of increased surface area and defects resulted in the efficient separation of photoexcited charges and extension of the visible-light absorption range, consequently enhancing the visible-light photocatalytic activity.60 Furthermore, incorporating N3c vacancies enabled a change in the morphology of g-C3N4 from the bulk to porous structure, and then to tiny powdery particles with an increase in the N3c-vacancy density (Fig. 4A). The evolution of thick chunks of the g-C3N4 sample to porous nanoparticles of the N3c-vacancy-modified g-C3N4 sample with a higher N3c-vacancy density was observed under both SEM (Fig. 4B and C) and TEM (Fig. 4D and E), respectively. The N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 catalysts possessed a slightly narrow pore size distribution in contrast to g-C3N4, indicating that the introduction of N3c vacancies induced the formation of small pores in the N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4. The surface area of an N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst was calculated to be 8.4 m2 g−1, which is marginally larger than that of g-C3N4 (5.8 m2 g −1).46 A spot of irregular porous structure, resulting from the removal of NHx species, was obtained upon high-temperature thermal condensation. After introducing NHx vacancies, the BET surface area of the vacancy-modified g-C3N4 increased to 23 m2 g−1, which is nearly 2 times larger than that of the pristine g-C3N4 (12 m2 g−1).27

Critical roles of Cv vacancies in photocatalytic performance enhancement

Modifying band structure and enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. 
The incorporation of Cv mainly results in an upshift in the CB, enhancing the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons (see the energy band structure of Cv-g-C3N4 shown in Fig. 1e).43 For example, the introduction of Cv in the g-C3N4 framework, which was achieved by thermal treatment under NH3, enlarged the bandgap of the resulting Cv-g-C3N4 to 2.79 eV, thus leading to a blueshift in its light absorption edge. The widened bandgap was caused by the slight alternation in the VB position and relatively large upshift in the CB.49 Moreover, Cv can act as trapping sites of electrons or holes in g-C3N4, thus suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and enhancing the charge carrier separation efficiency.48


Changing the morphology and increasing the porosity and surface area. 
The introduction of Cv is generally accompanied by a modification in the texture and surface area of g-C3N4. For example, the incorporation of Cv was reported to thin the g-C3N4 layer and improve the porosity.49 Besides, a Cv-modified hierarchical g-C3N4 sample with a microrod morphology was prepared via the thermal treatment of a melamine-NH2OH·HCl complex. The hierarchical micro-rod interconnected NSs with rich Cv resulted in a high surface area, high light utilization efficiency, improved available reactive sites, and increased mass-transport channels. The hierarchical Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited an excellent photodegradation efficiency towards the degradation of TC under visible light irradiation.61

Preparation of vacancy-modified g-C3N4
Preparation of Nv-g-C3N4

Calcination treatment of g-C3N4 or C, N-enriched precursors under different atmospheres. 
By turning the calcination atmospheres, N2c vacancies are most often introduced into the g-C3N4 framework. For example, N2c vacancies could be introduced in g-C3N4 by calcining it in a tube furnace at 520 °C under an N2 flow. The incorporation of N2c vacancies was confirmed by the decrease in both the N-to-C mole ratio and the XPS N 1s area of the sp2 N2c configuration. The concentration of N2c vacancies could be finely tuned by adjusting the calcining temperature.62 The heat treatment of pristine g-C3N4 under a reductive H2 atmosphere could also result in the formation of Nv-g-C3N4, where the N defects were located at the N2c sites. The heat treatment temperature could modulate the concentration of N2c vacancies.63 Similarly, reducing a g-C3N4 layered material under an H2 atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 520 °C to 540 °C led to homogeneous self-modification with N2c vacancies without changing the basic structure of g-C3N4 (see the schematic illustration in Fig. 5a).53 The thermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 under an H2 atmosphere also resulted in the formation of porous g-C3N4 NSs with tunable N2c vacancies.64 Zheng et al. reported the use of one-step H2 plasma treatment to induce the formation of a hierarchical, amorphous g-C3N4 nanostructure with two N2c site vacancies in the unit of the g-C3N4 structure without foreign element doping, which was used for the photocatalytic production of H2O2.65 Alternatively, the introduction of Nv located at N3c and terminal NHx sites in the C3N4 framework could be realized through a selenium vapor treatment route under an H2/Ar atmosphere at 350 °C, which could also be tailored based on the heat treatment duration.66

Besides using bulk g-C3N4 as a starting material for the preparation of Nv-g-C3N4, many other types of precursors have also been explored, particularly melamine and urea. The thermal treatment of melamine under an N2 flow produced Nv-g-C3N4 with Nv located at the N2c sites, and the introduction of Nv resulted in a decrease in the interlayer distance, increase in surface area, and a visible-light-harvesting performance enhancement.67 Using urea as a precursor, researchers explored a scalable N2H4·H2O-assisted thermal polymerization method to prepare Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts. As a common reductant, N2H4·H2O was decomposed into reductive species (i.e., H2 and NH3), leading to the introduction of Nv during the calcination process. The experimental results showed that Nv was introduced by removing the N2c atoms from the g-C3N4 framework.42


Quick thermal treatment. 
To enhance the preparation efficiency, researchers have made great efforts to explore a more efficient method to prepare vacancy-modified g-C3N4. Quick thermal treatment is capable of introducing N2c vacancies in g-C3N4. For example, Niu et al.68 developed a quick thermal treatment method at high temperatures to modify g-C3N4 within 5 min, resulting in the introduction of cyano groups and N2c vacancies, which induced a redshift in the intrinsic light absorption edges and the generation of new light absorption edges in g-C3N4. Furthermore, a one-step in situ doping strategy based on NaN3 deflagration was reported for the efficient synthesis of Nv-g-C3N4. The addition of a small amount of NaN3 could endow ultrafast deflagration within only 5 s during the polycondensation of dicyanodiamine, where some N2c atoms underwent reduction instantaneously by Na-nanoclusters, leaving remarkable amounts of N2c vacancies during the formation of g-C3N4.69 However, the photo-assisted treatment helped create abundant holes and introduced NHx vacancies in the g-C3N4 matrix, as shown in Fig. 5b.70


Thermal polymerization of a mixture of several precursors. 
The thermal polymerization of a mixture of several precursors is a straightforward method to prepare Nv-g-C3N4, and different mixtures can result in different types of Nv. For example, Zhang et al.71 developed the thermal polymerization of a freeze-dried mixture of dicyandiamide and NH4Cl under an N2 atmosphere to fabricate porous, defective g-C3N4 possessing cyano groups and N2c vacancies. Heating a mixture of melamine and urea could also lead to the formation of g-C3N4 with a sheet structure, where urea played a critical role in increasing the surface area and the generation of a mesoporous structure and N2c defects.72 Recently, the thermal treatment of melamine precursor in the presence of ethylene glycol was explored to produce 3D macroporous g-C3N4 configurations based on assembling N2c defect-engineered 2D g-C3N4 NSs.73 The thermal polymerization of melamine sulfate was also studied based on a facile one-step strategy to fabricate g-C3N4 with N2c defects, which could be tuned by changing the heating rate or pyrolysis duration. The lower the heating rate (or longer the pyrolysis duration), the greater the content of N2c vacancies and suspended terminal amino groups.74 The polycondensation of a mixture of melamine and PVP was also employed for the fabrication of porous O-doped and feeble N2c-deficient g-C3N4.75 Likewise, the thermal polymerization of a freeze-dried mixture of dicyandiamide, NH4Cl, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol-based prepolymer resulted in a unique N3c-deficient g-C3N4.76 Furthermore, the direct calcination of a melamine and azodicarbonamide mixture resulted in the formation of g-C3N4 with Nv located at the N3c sites.46
Besides purchasing chemicals, which are expensive, natural waste can also be used to prepare Nv-g-C3N4. Using solid waste coal gangue and g-C3N4, a series of metal-free, green, and sustainable hybrid catalysts was fabricated. The abundant –OH groups of coal gangue and N2 atmosphere could induce the formation of double-N defects in the g-C3N4 framework (cyano groups and NHx vacancies).77 Nv located at the N2c sites was also introduced in the g-C3N4 NS framework via hydrothermal treatment followed by two-step calcination starting from peanut oil and dicyandiamide, and a schematic illustration of the preparation process is provided in Fig. 5c. Consequently, the Nv-g-C3N4 p–n homojunction photocatalyst was formed in situ.78
It was found that high-temperature heat treatment of a nitric acid-pretreated melamine enabled the incorporation of NHx vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework.27 N-deficient g-C3N4 could be synthesized using acetic acid-treated melamine as a precursor by thermal condensation. The introduced N3c vacancies played a pivotal role in controlling the electronic structure of g-C3N4, such as extending the optical absorption and enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.59 Porous g-C3N4 NSs with N defects were prepared through the thermal polymerization of freeze-dried HCl-pretreated urea. NHx vacancies were successfully introduced in the g-C3N4 triazine units.79 Nanocage-like g-C3N4 rich in N3c vacancies could be obtained via the hydrothermal treatment of dicyandiamide followed by copolymerization of HCl and subsequent thermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 5d.80
Besides the common NS morphologies of Nv-g-C3N4, flower-like g-C3N4 assembly from porous NSs with N2c vacancies was prepared by calcination of melamine-cyanuric acid at 500 °C.81 A tubular g-C3N4 photocatalyst with the optimal Nv and extended π-conjugated system was also prepared through the thermal polymerization of a hydrogen-bonded melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular precursor, which was formed by a pyridinium alkaline ionic liquid-assisted hydrothermal process using melamine as the starting material.82
In addition to single modification by Nv, co-modification by Nv and heteroatoms was also explored to promote the performance of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The straightforward thermolysis of glucose and NH4I resulted in the formation of iodine-doped and NHx vacancy-modified mesoporous g-C3N4.83 The incorporation of N deficiency and S heteroatoms in a g-C3N4-based photocatalyst with a porous framework was realized by the thermal treatment of trithiocyanuric acid. The N-deficiency and S-doping enlarged the specific surface area, broadened the visible-light response range, and increased the charge separation efficiency.84


Alkaline compound-assisted introduction of Nv. 
Alkaline compounds are effective reagents to promote the introduction of Nv in g-C3N4 during high-temperature calcination treatment under an inert atmosphere, and the introduced Nv configurations depended on the alkaline compounds and precursors. Typically, KOH is the most commonly used alkaline compound for this type of modification. For example, two types of Nv (i.e., NHx and N2c vacancies) were also embedded in g-C3N4via the one-pot KOH-assisted calcination treatment of a mixture of KOH and pristine g-C3N4.85 Hollow tubular g-C3N4 with adjustable Nv was prepared via a facile hydrothermal calcination method. Under the initial conditions, melamine and its partially hydrolyzed product, cyanuric acid, formed a highly stable structure in a hydrothermal reaction through directional reversible hydrogen bonding. Following this step, different amounts of KOH were added and calcined at high temperatures to introduce N2c and NHx vacancies.86 Yu et al.45 reported a novel one-step KOH-assisted route to prepare N-defective g-C3Nx, wherein two types of N defects were selectively introduced in an in situ manner during the thermal polymerization of an alkaline compound and urea or other N-rich precursors (e.g., melamine and thiourea). The products exhibited tunable band structures enabled by the cyano groups in the bulk and N2c vacancies on the surface. Consequently, the resulting g-C3Nx could more efficiently harvest visible light and separate photoexcited charge carriers than pristine g-C3N4. A urea and melamine mixture was adopted via KOH-assisted thermal polymerization to fabricate thin-layered, porous, and defective g-C3N4. Its thickness could be dramatically decreased with the simultaneous introduction of cyano groups, N2c vacancies, and mesoporous architectures (Fig. 6a).87

Thermally decomposing a melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular complex in the presence of KOH resulted in modified g-C3N4 with a high surface area and rich N3c vacancies.88 Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was also employed as a precursor in an alkaline compound-assisted preparation process. The obtained g-C3N4 was rich in N3c vacancies and surface –OH groups.57
In addition to the commonly-used KOH as a promoter for the generation of Nv, other alkaline compounds have also been demonstrated to be effective. For example, NaOH was used to assist the molten-salt polymerization of melamine to modify crystalline g-C3N4, yielding NHx vacancies.89


Reduction with NaBH4 and KBH4. 
The reduction treatment of g-C3N4 can enable the removal of N2c atoms, yielding g-C3N4−x photocatalysts with tunable N2c defects. Typically, g-C3N4−x was prepared via the solid-state chemical reduction of g-C3N4 with NaBH4. The solid-state chemical reduction technique possessed many advantages, including straightforward procedure, low reaction temperatures (350–400 °C), short reaction duration (1 h), and simple apparatus.90 Similarly, reduced g-C3N4 was fabricated via the thermal treatment of pristine g-C3N4 and NaBH4 under an N2 atmosphere. This treatment could simultaneously introduce N2c vacancies and cyano groups in g-C3N4.91 Similar to NaBH4, KBH4 could also reduce g-C3N4via the one-step thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide with KBH4 and other methods, inducing K, B co-doping and Nv formation in g-C3N4. The self-limited generation of H2 introduced N2c vacancies with a controllable quantity due to the decomposition of KBH4.92


Other methods. 
Many other methods have also been reported for the fabrication of different Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts, where the introduced Nv types were dependent on the preparation method. With the assistance of NO3− species, the intercalated hydrogen bond effect, simultaneous control of the energy band, layer structure, and vacancy defect of ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs were achieved. This modification method endowed g-C3N4 NSs with rich N2c vacancies, large specific surface area, and a suitable CB position.93 A hard template-assisted process at high pressure and temperature was also demonstrated for the preparation of porous Nv-g-C3N4 with tunable Nv. The concentration of the two-coordinated N2c vacancies could be tailored based on the temperature. The obtained porous Nv-g-C3N4 exhibited an increased specific surface area and reduced bandgap to 1.88 eV, promoting visible-light absorption (up to 660 nm) and remarkable separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers.94 Tetraethyl orthosilicate hydrolysis silica gel was used as a template to prepare N defect (cyano-group and N2c vacancies)-modified mesoporous g-C3N4 materials in situ. The produced g-C3N4 had a mesoporous structure modified by cyano groups and N2c vacancies.95 A series of g-C3N4 photocatalysts with unique microtube morphologies, tunable N2c vacancy concentrations, and porous wall structures was synthesized by calcining N-deficient rod-like precursors based on the self-conversion of monomeric melamine for different hydrothermal treatment times.96
Dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment is another effective way to prepare Nv-g-C3N4. The results showed that plasma treatment did not change the structure, specific surface area, and morphology of g-C3N4, while introducing N3c vacancies in g-C3N4.97 O heteroatoms were doped in hollow porous prismatic g-C3N4 with N3c vacancies using dicyandiamidine as the raw material via low-temperature hydrothermal and subsequent calcination treatment.56 Likewise, a combined hydrothermal condensation and thermal exfoliation process was reported for the fabrication of an aerogel composed of self-supported g-C3N4 nanolayer with rich N3c vacancies.98
A facile but reliable thermal treatment process using ethanol as the solvent was also explored to prepare NHx vacancy-modified g-C3N4 without other reagents.99 Ball milling may be more compatible with the industrial process and have substantial power to engineer the electronic and physicochemical structures of g-C3N4, thus holding great potential in producing vacancy-defected-g-C3N4. The simultaneous formation of NHx vacancies and the special mesoporous morphology could be achieved via ball milling and subsequent calcination in an N2 atmosphere, which induced structural distortion and morphological variation of the intermediate with considerable breakage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds by a mechanochemical method. The preparation process and formation mechanism are shown in Fig. 6b.100
In summary, the preparation of Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts is classified and summarized as follows:
(1) N2c vacancies are mostly introduced in the g-C3N4 framework by turning the calcination atmospheres, quick thermal treatments, and reduction treatments with NaBH4/KBH4. Therefore, these methods can be well adapted to prepare the defective g-C3N4 photocatalysts with N2c vacancies.
(2) The thermal polymerization of a mixture of different precursors is a straightforward method to prepare Nv-g-C3N4. Since the formed Nv configuration depends on the mixture used, varying the mixture is promising for the preparation of the target Nv configurations in g-C3N4.
(3) Alkaline compounds are effective reagents to promote the incorporation of Nv in g-C3N4 during high-temperature calcination treatment under inert atmospheres. Considering that the introduced Nv configuration is dictated by the starting alkaline compounds and precursors, the desirable Nv configuration is likely incorporated by adjusting these parameters.

Preparation of Cv-g-C3N4

Calcining treatments under different atmospheres. 
Although Cv has attracted less attention than Nv in the modified g-C3N4, the creation of Cv has also been demonstrated to be adequate for structural modification and photocatalytic activity mediation of g-C3N4. Generally, Cv can be introduced in g-C3N4 by calcination treatments in a tube furnace at 520 °C under an Ar flow (Fig. 6c). The incorporation of Cv was confirmed by a decrease in the C/N molar ratio and the XPS C 1s area of the C-N3 configuration.34,48 Besides an Ar atmosphere, an NH3 atmosphere was also explored in the heat treatment of pristine g-C3N4 to prepare Cv-g-C3N4, and the selective removal of C atoms induced the formation of Cv and additional amino groups.49 N2 was also employed as the atmosphere to perform thermolysis after preprocessing precursors (i.e., urea and melamine), resulting in a series of tubular Cv-g-C3N4.101 Porous, ultrathin Cv-g-C3N4 NSs, doped with S, were obtained in the gaseous phase by the copolymerization of melamine and trithiocyanuric acid under a self-generated NH3 atmosphere. The in situ-generated NH3 atmosphere promoted the formation of Cv-g-C3N4 NSs bearing a hierarchical pore structure and a large specific surface area.102 Carbon-defective g-C3N4 with a large specific surface area could be obtained via the high-temperature thermal etching of bulk g-C3N4 three times under weak oxygen conditions.103 A fibrous Cv-g-C3N4 was prepared from a laminated covalent triazine framework via pyrolysis, using functionalized 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and melamine as the precursors, where Cv was produced by two-step calcination in Ar and air atmospheres.104


Other methods. 
Calcining a mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid could yield Cv-g-C3N4 ultrathin NSs with a thickness of 10 nm.50 Later, two-step thermal oxidation treatments were also reported to produce ultrathin g-C3N4 with rich Cv on the surface.105 Likewise, a two-step thermal treatment using NH4Cl and melamine was feasible to produce atomically-thin porous Cv-g-C3N4 NSs, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6d.106 Recently, thermal treatments of a multicomponent mixture of cyanuric acid, melamine, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were also investigated to construct macropores Cv-g-C3N4, with PMMA spheres as a template.43
Unlike the commonly-used calcination and hydrothermal methods, post hydrothermal treatments could also be employed for the fabrication of Cv and –OH co-modified g-C3N4. During the hydrothermal process, water played an essential role in etching the unstable part of bulk g-C3N4 to introduce Cv and –OH in the resulting modified g-C3N4 NSs.107 Furthermore, magnesium vapor etching was also demonstrated to be suitable for the construction of a Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The constructed Cv could promote visible light absorption and improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges.108 Hierarchical Cv-g-C3N4 nanorods with abundant Cv were synthesized via an ultrasound-assisted thermal polycondensation method using a melamine-HONH2·HCl complex as a template. This Cv-g-C3N4 possessed a large specific surface area with extensive reactive sites, thus endowing abundant mass-transport channels for charge migration. Besides, multiple light scattering could be observed for Cv-g-C3N4.109

Preparation of Cv and Nv co-modified g-C3N4
To further improve the photocatalytic performance of single Nv- or Cv-modified g-C3N4, researchers have attempted to co-modify g-C3N4 with both Nv and Cv. Typically, Wang et al.110 adopted an ion irradiation technique to prepare g-C3N4 NSs with both N2c vacancies and Cv, which could be introduced simultaneously in the g-C3N4 lattice without any selectivity due to the cascade collision of irradiation ions with the target atoms during ion irradiation. The concentration and distribution of incident vacancies could also be well controlled by ion fluence and energy. Besides, a porous g-C3N4 photocatalyst containing Cv and N3c vacancies was successfully prepared via simple thermal polymerization using melamine and polyvinylpyrrolidone as the precursor and templating agent, respectively.111 Recently, g-C3N4 micro-rods with superficial C, N dual vacancies (Cv and N2c vacancies) were synthesized via the facile thermal polymerization of melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular precursors under an H2 flow at elevated temperatures.58
Applications of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts
Photocatalytic H2O splitting
The development of clean and sustainable energy is exceptionally urgent to replace fossil energy due to the environmental pollution and energy depletion issues caused by the over-exploitation of fossil fuels. Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy carriers among the alternative energy sources. H2 evolution based on photocatalytic water splitting over semiconductors, driven by solar energy, has been considered the most attractive way to tackle environmental pollution and the energy crisis.112,113 Since the first report regarding g-C3N4-catalyzed H2 evolution under visible light, the development of highly active g-C3N4-based photocatalysts has become a research hotspot worldwide.31
The introduction of Nv and Cv can effectively enhance the visible-light harvesting and charge separation efficiency of g-C3N4, thus promoting the catalytic performance for water splitting. In the following sections we review and discuss the modification of g-C3N4 with Cv and Nv to promote its photocatalytic H2 evolution performance.

N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4. 
The impact of incorporating N2c vacancies on the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 for H2 evolution was explored. The Nv density in the optimum range was positively correlated with the photocatalytic activities due to the gradual promotion of light harvesting, efficient charge separation and transportation, and uniform binding of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on g-C3N4 as the active reaction sites. The g-C3N4 NSs with the optimized density of N2c vacancies displayed ∼18 times enhancement for H2 evolution compared to bulk g-C3N4.55 To improve the photocatalytic performance of an N2c vacancy-enriched g-C3N4 photocatalyst, Zhang and co-authors90 prepared g-C3N4−x with tunable N2c vacancies via a solid-state chemical reduction technique. The optimal g-C3N4−x photocatalyst obtained after reduction treatment at 400 °C showed an H2 evolution rate of 3.07 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light. Wu et al.42 reported the preparation superior N2c-modified g-C3N4via a scalable and straightforward N2H4·H2O-assisted thermal polymerization method. The N2c-modified g-C3N4 showed an optimized visible-light-driven H2 evolution rate, reaching 8.17 mmol g−1 h−1. The introduction of Nv in the N2c sites narrowed the bandgap and downward-shifted mid-gap states under the CB edge, which significantly enhanced the visible-light harvesting and H2 evolution. An in situ g-C3N4 p–n homojunction photocatalyst with N2c vacancies was also recently fabricated via hydrothermal reactions, followed by two-step calcination. The Nv-g-C3N4 homojunction exhibited the optimum H2 evolution rate of 3.26 mmol g−1 h−1 for water splitting under visible light. However, although the H2 evolution rate was 8.7 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4, this performance is mediocre compared with that in previous work.78


N3c- and/or NHx-modified g-C3N4. 
Later, Mo et al.66 gradually incorporated N3c and NHx vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework via selenium vapor treatment of pure g-C3N4, improving the photocatalytic activity of the resulting defected g-C3N4, with the optimized average H2 generation rate of 1.16 mmol g−1 h−1 at room temperature, which was 3.4 times greater than pristine g-C3N4. The combined experiment and DFT calculation revealed that the improvement was due to the Nv defect state in the unit cell of g-C3N4 and slight widening of its visible light absorption. Recently, g-C3N4 with abundant NHx vacancies and high crystallinity was prepared via the alkaline salt-assisted treatment of bulk g-C3N4 with LiN(SiMe3)2, which led to a redshifted absorption edge and enhanced charge carrier separation.114


Co-Modification by N2c and functional groups. 
Together with the incorporation of Nv into the g-C3N4 framework, cyano groups are sometimes introduced at the g-C3N4 edge. For example, the KOH-assisted thermal polymerization of urea could introduce cyano groups in the bulk and N2c vacancies on the surface of g-C3N4, rendering the defect level below the CB. Consequently, a noticeable decrease in the band energy and an increase in the separation efficiency for photoexcited charge carriers were achieved, and the optimized sample exhibited an H2 revolution rate of 6.9 mmol g−1 h−1,45 as also presented in Table 1. Cyano groups and N2c vacancies were introduced in g-C3N4via a quick thermal treatment method, inducing a redshift in the intrinsic light absorption edges and the emergence of light absorption edges in g-C3N4. The extended visible-light absorption, decreased charge recombination, and larger surface areas with more active sites resulted in 21.5 times higher rates of photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation.68

Later, hydrogenated g-C3N4 (with defects) was prepared by calcining g-C3N4 with NaBH4 under an inert atmosphere. The NaBH4 treatment of pristine g-C3N4 could eliminate the amino groups (–C–NH2 groups) and break the s-triazine heterocycles in g-C3N4 to create N2c vacancies and cyano groups. The hydrogenated g-C3N4 sample exhibited a narrower bandgap and red-shift absorption, arising from its N2c vacancies and cyano groups, which worked as strong electron-withdrawing sites, thus promoting the efficient transfer and separation of photo-induced carriers and exhibiting higher photocatalytic H2 evolution activity than the bare g-C3N4.115
Recently, N2c vacancy- and cyano groups-co-modified atomically layered g-C3N4 was prepared through a facile two-step thermal treatment. The atomically layered g-C3N4 with Nv and cyano groups provided more active sites and decreased the transferring distances of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the Nv and cyano groups extended the responsive visible light to 650 nm. The defected g-C3N4 exhibited a much higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rate and apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 3.7 mmol h−1 g−1 and 14.98%, respectively.116 A comparable photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (3.88 mmol g−1 h−1) was also reported on a unique Nv-g-C3N4 homojunction modified with N2c vacancies and cyano groups, which was prepared via an inserting-removing strategy.76
Besides cyano groups, –OH groups were also incorporated together with the introduction of N3c vacancies by a co-assisted polymer/alkali route. The high concentration of –OH groups incorporated in g-C3N4 could enhance light absorption range and photogenerated electron–hole pair separation efficiency. Consequently, the photocatalytic performance towards H2 production under solar irradiation was significantly improved compared to the conventionally prepared g-C3N4.57 Sp2-hybridized CC functionalities were also introduced together with the incorporation of Nv. The CC structure dispersed on the Nv-g-C3N4 matrix like small islands, leading to high vis-NIR light absorption. Moreover, the CC structure could also behave as “hot islands”, boosting the NIR photothermal conversion. This NIR photothermal conversion-assisted photocatalytic H2 evolution over g-C3N4 NSs bearing Nv and CC occurred at a rate of 3.1 mmol g−1 h−1.117 Recently, suspended terminal amino groups were also generated together with N2c vacancies by polymerizing melamine sulfate at a lower heating rate or for a longer pyrolysis time. Consequently, an optimal photocatalytic H2 yield rate (λ > 420 nm) of 0.91 mmol h−1 g−1 was achieved. However, although a 2 times higher H2 evolution rate for the Nv and amino group-co-modified g-C3N4 than that of bare g-C3N4 was achieved, it is still lower than that in contemporary work.74


Modification by N2c and porous architecture engineering. 
The most recent attractive topics of photocatalytic materials based on vacancy-modified g-C3N4 have been a combination of vacancy modification and porosity engineering. Likewise, mesoporous, Nv-g-C3N4 NSs (with a large surface area) were synthesized using a mixture of melamine and urea. Femtosecond-time-resolved diffuse reflectance measurements revealed that N2c vacancies could trap the photogenerated electrons generated from the CB of g-C3N4. The performance of the defected g-C3N4 sample could be optimized with an H2 production rate of 3.1 mmol g−1 h−1 and an AQY of 74% at 400 nm.72 Both the porous structure and N2c vacancies were also simultaneously introduced in the g-C3N4 framework by polymerizing a freeze-dried mixture of dicyandiamide and NH4Cl. The obtained g-C3N4 with porosity and defects exhibited an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (2.09 mmol g−1 h−1) given that the porosity and defects provided combined effects of a larger specific surface area, enhanced visible light-harvesting capability, and improved charge separation efficiency.71 To reduce the energy consumption and provide an economical way to combine a variety of favorable gases, Sun and coauthors118 prepared porous g-C3N4 NSs with N2c vacancies and a high surface area via a one-step calcination approach under generated gas molecules, which exhibited a high separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs and an H2 evolution rate of 1.20 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible-light irradiation. Compared to this work, a defective ultrathin mesoporous photocatalyst was reported with a high specific surface area, mesoporous structure, and enhanced photocatalytic performance in H2 production in a triethanolamine solution (rate of 13.63 mmol h−1 g−1) and overall water splitting (rate of 33.5 μmol h−1 g−1) under visible light.119 The significant H2 evolution performance was attributed to the shorter distance of bulk to the surface, quick adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products, and enriched active sites. Moreover, the suitable N2c defects extended the light absorption, produced ultra-high intrinsic carrier mobility, and increased the number of active sites.


Modification by N3c/NHx vacancies and porous architecture engineering. 
N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 bearing a unique 3D nanocage-like structure was demonstrated to deliver excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. An evolution rate of 1.85 mmol g−1 h−1 was achieved, which is approximately 20.3 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4.80 The simultaneous formation of Nv and mesopores could also be achieved by the ball-milling-induced massive rupture of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, structural distortion, and morphological variation of the intermediate. Recently, bridging-N3c defect-modified holey g-C3N4 NSs were prepared via solid-state polymerization and successive thermal annealing with melamine and hexamethylenetetramine as precursors, in which both porous structure and bridging-N defects were embedded in the NS framework. Consequently, the photocatalytic H2 production was improved, with a rate of 2.50 mmol g−1 h−1 and an AQY of 3.24% at 420 nm. The enlarged surface area of the holey NS structure provided more active sites and shortened the charge transfer distance. The bridging N defects greatly enhanced the photoabsorption and reduced the charge recombination in the bulk apart besides the enlarged surface area.120 The as-prepared mesoporous, NHx vacancy-imbedded g-C3N4 exhibited an enlarged specific surface area, considerably thinned NS morphology, extended visible light absorption, enhanced photoexcited charge separation and transfer, and, consequently, ∼6.3-fold improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, compared with the bulk g-C3N4.100


Co-Modification by N2c and functional groups and porous architecture engineering. 
A cyano group/Nv-co-modified mesoporous g-C3N4 photocatalyst was synthesized through an in situ silica gel strategy. The introduced mesoporous structure, cyano groups, and N2c vacancies could increase the surface area, improve the charge separation, and enhance the visible light absorption. Benefiting from these positive factors, the defective g-C3N4 is highly active in water splitting, with an H2 evolution rate approximately 14.7-folds larger than that of the bulk g-C3N4.95 Urea and KOH-assisted thermal polymerization was developed to prepare porous, defect-enriched, thin g-C3N4 with a small thickness. Meanwhile, cyano groups, N2c vacancies, and mesopores were simultaneously introduced in the g-C3N4 framework. The thickness, pores, and defects could be controlled by changing the mass ratio of urea, KOH, and melamine to increase the surface area, improve the light-harvesting capacity, enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, and strengthen the mass transfer in g-C3N4. A scheme is presented in Fig. 7a to illustrate the photocatalytic process. Consequently, the H2 evolution rate of 1.56 mmol h−1 g−1 (λ > 420 nm) for the modified g-C3N4 was achieved, with the highest average AQY of 18.5%.87

Modification by N2c and mediation of texture and surface area. 
Besides enhancing the visible light harvesting and charge separation efficiency, the introduction of Nv can also tailor the g-C3N4 texture for increasing the surface area and the number of active sites. Typically, engineering defected g-C3N4 in a mesoporous texture could increase the specific area and provide more active sites. The combined effect of increased surface area and defects (N2c vacancies and cyano groups) imparted the efficient separation of photoexcited charges and extension of the visible-light absorption range, resulting in enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for the production of H2 (3.29 mmol h−1 g−1) relative to bare g-C3N4, albeit with a still unsatisfactory H2 production rate.60 A rod-like porous texture of N2c modified g-C3N4 could also generate a large surface area and significant enhancement of visible-light photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the excellent visible-light absorption, larger surface area, and dramatically promoted charge transfer and separation.94


Modification by N3c/NHx and mediation of texture and surface area. 
It was also found that the H2 production rate increases with an increase in the content of N3c vacancies in the corresponding sample. In addition, the construction of a self-supported aerogel texture consisting of g-C3N4 nanolayers could enlarge the surface area, which together with the presence of Nv, enhanced the photo-reduction performance, with an H2 evolution rate of nearly 4.2 mmol h−1 g−1.98


Modification by N2c and heteroatom doping. 
O doping and feeble N2c vacancy modification were examined for porous g-C3N4, which were achieved through the thermal polycondensation of a melamine and polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture.75 This O-doped, N2c vacancy-modified, porous g-C3N4 exhibited a narrowed bandgap by 0.2 eV relative to the pure g-C3N4, together with the expansion of its specific surface area. The effective structural mediation increased the solar-energy utilization efficiency and promoted the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance under visible-light irradiation (5 times higher than the pristine g-C3N4).


Modification by Cv. 
Few-layered g-C3N4 semiconductors with Cv were produced via a one-step C/N steam reforming reaction, which exhibited unique thin 2D structures, abundant active sites, and superior photogenerated charge separation, with the average H2 evolution rate reaching 3.39 mmol g−1 h−1, which is much higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4.121 Recently, a 3D macropore Cv-g-C3N4 catalyst was prepared through a one-step route using polymethylmethacrylate as a template to increase the surface reaction sites and extend its visible-light range. Cv-g-C3N4 showed significantly improved H2 production rates compared to the unmodified g-C3N4. The unique pore structure increased the number of surface-active sites and considerably enhanced the light utilization efficiency of g-C3N4.43 The covalent triazine framework-derived ultrathin fibrous Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst fabricated via thermopolymerization combined with further thermal treatment retained the internal pore structure of the covalent organic framework. Calcination in the argon atmosphere was proven effective for creating Cv and inhibiting carrier recombination by capturing photogenerated electrons and holes. With a higher specific surface area, the Cv-g-C3N4 sample delivered 66 times higher photocatalytic activity in the generation of H2 under visible-light illumination compared to the bare g-C3N4.104 P (χ = 2.1) doping and Cv modification were simultaneously implemented to engineer the g-C3N4 structure by the thermal polymerization of a supramolecular precursor obtained from melamine molecules in a sodium pyrophosphate-assisted hydrothermal process. Consequently, the combinative benefits enabled the suitable mediation of electronic structure, surface defects, active sites, and textural structures, thus optimizing the photocatalytic H2 production with a rate of 0.57 mmol g−1 h−1.122

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The application of g-C3N4 photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with H2O to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and produce profitable fuels has attracted significant attention.124 With CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, or CH4 as the main products, the reaction steps involved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction are provided in eqn (1)–(5), as follows: g-C3N4 + hν = h+ + e−(1) H2O = H+ + OH−(2) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− = CO + H2O(3) CO2 + 6H+ + 6e− = CH3OH + H2O(4) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− = CH4 + 2H2O(5)
Enhancing photocatalytic performance for CO2 reduction over g-C3N4 relies on the following factors: (1) bandgap mediation and visible-light harvesting; (2) CO2 adsorption and activation ability; (3) photogenerated electron–hole pair separation efficiency, and (4) the CB position. The introduction of Nv and Cv can adequately match the above-mentioned features of g-C3N4 and further enhance the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Modification by N2c. 
An N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 NS photocatalyst was prepared for the reduction of CO2 to CO. Based on the experimental investigation and DFT calculations, the Nv in the g-C3N4-based framework induced the formation of a mid-gap state under the CB edge. An increase in the Nv density contributed to a deepened position of mid-gap states in g-C3N4, were the optimized Nv density displayed a 4 times enhancement for the reduction of CO2 to CO compared to the bulk g-C3N4.55


Modification by N3c/NHx. 
The modification of NHx vacancies on ultrathin g-C3N4 was also demonstrated to enhance the CO2 photoreduction performance. The development of few-atomic-layered g-C3N4 could provide a larger exposed surface area for adequate charge carrier transportation. Alternatively, the advantageous intrinsic traits of the NHx vacancy-induced mid-gap state were favorable for mediating multi-electron excitations in a two-step process. This optical absorption could be extended to the NIR region for optimal solar energy utilization. The prolonged decay lifetime as an effect of the introduction of NHx vacancies substantially demonstrated the essential role of the mid-gap state in restraining the recombination rate. Consequently, excellent photocatalytic activity was realized with N defect states in the g-C3N4 atomic layers, resulting in 5.14-fold-enhanced CH4 evolution compared to its counterpart without NHx vacancies. The underlying mechanism for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is illustrated in Fig. 7b.125 g-C3N4 co-modified with N2c vacancies and terminal cyano groups was prepared via the KOH-assisted molten-salt polymerization of melamine. The defective g-C3N4 exhibited superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction compared to pristine g-C3N4. The following advantages of Nv and terminal cyano groups commodification resulted in an enhancement in the CO2 photocatalytic reduction performance: (1) the high crystallinity and ultra-thin thickness of the defective g-C3N4 enhanced the charge transport; (2) the Nv and cyano groups effectively captured photoelectrons and enhanced the photoexcited charge carrier separation and (3) the Nv and cyano groups enhanced the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules.126 It was found that the creation of N3c and NHx vacancies and defects/holes in the NSs led to enhanced porosity. These variations can induce several changes in the optoelectronic properties of the materials, as follows: (i) appearance of n-π* transitions, (ii) redshift in the visible light absorption edge, and (iii) reduced charge recombination. Benefiting from the above-mentioned features, an enhancement in the uptake of CO2 adsorption and CO2 photocatalytic reduction performance was achieved.127


Modification by Cv. 
The heat treatment of g-C3N4 in an NH3 atmosphere led to the formation of Cv-g-C3N4 with photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction. The incorporation of Cv in g-C3N4 enhanced the photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2 with a CO yield of 4.18 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 2.3 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. The presence of Cv sites promoted the CO2 molecule adsorption/activation over g-C3N4. Moreover, the modification of Cv in g-C3N4 upshifted the CB level, which increased the reduction potential and ability.49 3D macroporous Cv-g-C3N4 was prepared through a facile one-step route. Polymethylmethacrylate was used as a template to increase the surface reaction sites of g-C3N4 and extend its visible-light range. Compared to unmodified g-C3N4, the CO2 reduction rates over the 3D macropore Cv-g-C3N4 g-C3N4 significantly increased. The unique pore structure significantly improved the light utilization efficiency of g-C3N4 and increased the number of surface-active sites. The incorporation of Cv strengthened the visible-light absorption and suppressed the photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination.43 Some typical work is summarized in Table 2 regarding CO2 photocatalytic reduction over g-C3N4 bearing vacancies.

N2 Fixation
Ammonia is a crucial feedstock for industrial and agricultural chemical synthesis and a carbon-free power source for future H2 economy.128 However, the current ammonia production is based on the Haber–Bosch process, which is energy-intensive and emits large amounts of greenhouse gas.129 Photocatalytic N2 fixation for artificial NH3 synthesis exhibits great future potential due to its mild conditions with solar energy as the driving force. Many highly active photocatalysts have been developed since the first report on N2 fixation over TiO2 under UV irradiation by Schrauzer and Guth.130 Among them, g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have attracted the most significant attention. In this section, we summarize and discuss the effect of Nv, Cv, and their combined incorporation on the performance of g-C3N4 in photocatalytic N2 fixation. The following main reaction steps (6)–(8) for N2 fixation over g-C3N4-based materials are provided.102 g-C3N4 + hν = h+ + e−(6) N2 + 6e− + 6H+ = 2NH3(7) NH3 + H2O = NH4+ + OH−(8)

Co-modification by N2c. 
Porous g-C3N4 with N2c vacancies and cyano groups was prepared via the alkali-assisted heat treatment of urea. Alkali can break hydrogen bonds, which accelerated the thermal polymerization of urea and the formation of Nv/cyano groups. The presence of Nv extended the visible-light absorption to a longer wavelength region. The cyano groups could trap photoinduced electrons and suppress charge recombination. The porous structure increased the surface area and exposed more active sites. Consequently, the co-modified g-C3N4 showed boosted visible photocatalytic N2 fixation activity (1.59 mmol h−1 gcat−1) without cocatalysts, and the underlying mechanism for the photocatalytic process is displayed in Fig. 7c.131
Cyano-deficient g-C3N4 was synthesized via the KOH etching treatment of bulk g-C3N4. With a certain effect on the morphology and structure of g-C3N4, KOH etching treatment successfully introduced cyano groups in the g-C3N4 framework. The obtained KOH-etched g-C3N4 catalysts exhibited pores and/or a ladder-like thin layered structure. Moreover, the introduction of cyano groups lowered the CB position and inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. More chemical adsorption sites were exposed to activate N2, which is beneficial for photocatalytic N2 fixation reactions. The modification of morphology and electronic property, especially the introduction of cyano functional groups, remarkably promoted the activity toward simulated sunlight-driven photocatalytic N2 fixation.132


Modification by N3c. 
As early as 2015, Nv-incorporated g-C3N4 was synthesized by calcining g-C3N4 in a tube furnace at 520 °C under an N2 flow.133 It was found that N3c vacancies could promote photocatalytic N2 fixation over g-C3N4. Photocatalytic N2 fixation induced by Nv was free from the interference of other gases. N2 could be selectively adsorbed and activated on Nv because Nv exhibited a similar shape and size as N2. The Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst could yield 1.24 mmol h−1 g−1 of NH4+ in an N2 atmosphere, while no significant amount of NH4+ was detected for pristine g-C3N4. Recently, Nv-g-C3N4 was prepared via dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment, which did not change the structure, specific surface area, and morphology of the catalyst but introduced N3c vacancies into g-C3N4.97 For the N2 photocatalytic fixation of Nv-g-C3N4, the NH4+ production rate was significantly increased to 2.6 mg L−1 h−1 g−1, which is 10 times larger than that of bare g-C3N4. Porous g-C3N4 with N3c vacancies and O doping was prepared via the low-temperature hydrothermal treatment of dicyandiamidine and subsequent calcination. The obtained g-C3N4 showed a hollow prismatic morphology with introduced Nv and O doping co-modification. The g-C3N4 photocatalyst modified with N3c vacancies and doped with O element exhibited excellent activity and stability for N2 fixation, with the reaction rate reaching 118.8 mg L−1 h−1 g−1.56


Modification by Cv. 
An ultra-thin g-C3N4 with a loose structure and rich Cv on its surface was achieved through high-temperature peeling methods. The loose ultra-thin structure significantly enhanced the specific surface area and N2 adsorption. Cv could allow more active sites to be exposed and increase the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. After atomic-scale structure control and surface defect construction, the photocatalytic activity of the prepared Cv-g-C3N4 for ammonia conversion for N2 fixation could be significantly improved compared to bulk g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation, the defective Cv-g-C3N4 could produce NH3 at a rate of 84 μmol h−1 g−1 without using any cocatalyst and sacrificial agent.105 A Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst was obtained by thermal oxygen etching treatment three times. The introduction of Cv increased the specific surface area and widened the bandgap of g-C3−xN4 from 2.82 to 3.03 eV. Consequently, the charge separation efficiency was promoted, together with an improvement in the performance of the photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia. Under visible light, Cv-g-C3N4 could produce 3.60 mmol h−1 g−1 of NH3, which was approximately 3.24 times higher than that of its bare g-C3N4 counterpart.103


Modification by Cv and porous architecture engineering. 
Holey g-C3N4 (HGCN) NSs bearing a high Cv density were prepared by thermally treating bulk g-C3N4 under an NH3 atmosphere. The Cv-embedded g-C3N4 exhibited many advantages, including large surface area, strong reduction ability, and high photogenerated charge separation rate. The rate of NH4+ production from N2 photo-fixation over the HGCN sample reached as high as ∼25.54 mg L−1 h−1 g−1 under the optimal conditions, which was ∼5.87 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 sample.134


Modification by heteroatom doping, Cv, and porous architecture engineering. 
S doping was combined with Cv and a porous architecture to modify ultrathin g-C3N4 porous NSs by directly collecting the gaseous product of self-generated NH3 atmosphere-treated thiourea. The NH3 atmosphere not only resulted in the S doping of g-C3N4 with a hierarchical porous structure but also introduced Cv in the framework of g-C3N4. The modified g-C3N4 with multiple modifications showed a photocatalytic N2 fixation rate of 5.99 mmol h−1 g−1, which was 2.8 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4.102 Some typical contributions to g-C3N4 with vacancies in the photocatalytic N2 fixation are shown in Table 3.

NO removal
Nitric oxide (NO), a major air pollutant, poses severe environmental pollution, including acid rain, photochemical smog, and ozone cumulation.135 Photocatalytic oxidation/reduction driven by solar energy has attracted tremendous attention to remove NO pollutants.136 Thus, considering that g-C3N4 is one of the most promising photocatalysts, it is widely used to catalyze the removal of NO.137–139 However, the efficiency of NO removal remains unsatisfactory for pristine g-C3N4 due to its weak harvesting of visible light and fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.140 In this section, we summarize and discuss the effect of Nv and Cv incorporation in g-C3N4 on its performance for the photocatalytic removal of NO.

Modification by N2c vacancies. 
A g-C3N4 microtube photocatalyst with a tunable Nv concentration was controllably fabricated using an in situ soft-chemical method. The NO removal ratio and apparent reaction rate constant of the g-C3N4 microtubes were 1.8 and 2.6 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The spatial distribution of N2c vacancies activated and dissociated molecular O2 and enhanced the electron-separation efficiency. The porous tubular architecture favored the oriented transfer of charge carriers and the diffusion of reactants.96 Later, N2c vacancies could be introduced in the g-C3N4 framework by H2 heat-treatment process. The obtained Nv-g-C3N4, with a narrower bandgap, promoted photoexcited charge carrier separation and produced more reactive oxygen species than the pristine g-C3N4. The intermediate NO+ formed on the Nv sites resulted in an accelerated photocatalytic NO removal. The NO removal ratio on Nv-g-C3N4 was 2.6 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation.63


Modification by N3c vacancies. 
A calcination process yielded three-coordinated Nv (i.e., N3c) modified g-C3N4. The existence of rich Nv endowed the defected g-C3N4 with a broad visible light absorption range and accelerated charge transfer compared with bare g-C3N4. The introduction of N3c vacancies in g-C3N4 weakened the adsorption of the reactants and products and facilitated the activation of the O2 molecule to create 1O2, thus enhancing the NO-oxidation performance, as illustrated in Fig. 8a.46 A flower-like g-C3N4 assembly comprised of porous NSs was fabricated via the direct calcination of melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular aggregates. The flower-like g-C3N4 exhibited improved photocatalytic activity towards NO oxidation under visible light irradiation compared with bulk g-C3N4, resulting from the improved visible-light harvesting ability and efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The synergistic effects (e.g., broken intralayer hydrogen bonds, enlarged BET surface area, and N2c vacancies enabled a negative shift in the CB potentials) play critical roles in enhancing the NO oxidation.81

Modification by Cv. 
A Cv-g-C3N4 NS structure could efficiently and selectively reduce NO to N2 under visible light. The problems of secondary pollution and catalyst deactivation are avoided given that N2 is a green gas without any harm and can easily desorb from the active sites. It was found that the ultrathin nanostructure and abundant surface defect sites of Cv-g-C3N4 NSs endowed them with enhanced visible-light absorption, separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, chemisorption of NO, and photoreactivity. Meanwhile, the surface defects of Cv-g-C3N4 shifted the adsorption structure toward NO from C–N–O for its bulk counterpart to Cv–O–N (adsorbed at the Cv site), resulting in high selectivity for the conversion of NO to N2.50 Later, Cv-g-C3N4 was fabricated via the calcination bulk g-C3N4 in a CO2 atmosphere. The introduction of Cv resulted in a negative shift in the CB position and promoted electron transfer from the CB to the adsorbed O2. Consequently, superoxide radicals were formed, which significantly enhanced the photocatalytic NO oxidation.47


Modification by Cv and morphology mediation. 
Besides vacancy modification, morphology mediation is also essential to finely control the microstructure and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. In particular, a Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst with a tubular morphology was prepared via the pyrolysis of the hydrolyzed melamine-urea mixture under N2 gas. With the particular structural merits of the tubular nanostructure and the introduction of a suitable Cv density, numerous accessible surface defect sites, and accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, where the as-prepared Cv-g-C3N4 NTs exhibited an excellent photocatalytic NO oxidation performance. The surface Cv in the C3N4 NTs could greatly facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO and O2, leading to superior photocatalytic activity and selectivity in converting NO to NO3−.101


Co-Modification by Cv and functional groups. 
The Cv and –OH co-modified g-C3N4 prepared by a green hydrothermal method displayed 2.2 times higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine g-C3N4 for NO removal. Cv could narrow the bandgap of the co-modified g-C3N4 NSs to improve the light-absorbing capability, while the –OH groups enabled the formation of stable covalent bonds, which acted as electron transport channels to facilitate the charge carrier separation.107Table 4 presents the photocatalytic NO removal catalyzed by vacancy-modified g-C3N4.

With the rapid development of various industries (e.g., foods, chemicals, medicines, etc.), the uncontrolled discharge of vast quantities of hazardous and toxic waste in the water environment, especially organic pollutants and antibiotics, contaminates the environment and threatens human health. Among the degradation technologies to tackle organic pollutants, photocatalytic degradation using semiconductor-based photocatalysts has received substantial interest worldwide because photocatalysts excited by solar energy readily yield highly reactive species for the degradation of organic pollutant into clean products (i.e., CO2 and H2O). The photocatalytic degradation process exhibits the merits of reduced energy consumption and environmental protection and is considered the ultimate technology to remove organic pollutants and antibiotics from wastewater.141,142 g-C3N4-based materials have attracted significant attention in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and antibiotics, especially for g-C3N4 modified with Nv and Cv, which further enhance its photocatalytic performance.

Modification by N2c vacancies. 
Alternatively, Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts with different densities of N2c vacancies were prepared by annealing pristine g-C3N4 in an N2 atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this system, an increase in the Nv density could enable the CB position of g-C3N4 to shift more negatively. Meanwhile, various positive factors, including surface area, light response, and photogenerated charge separation, were also introduced. Consequently, a noticeable improvement in photocatalytic RhB degradation was obtained.62 Similar to the work earlier reported in ref. 59, N2c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 was prepared via the thermal treatment of melamine under an N2 flow, which was further used to construct a sulfite activation system. In the presence of Na2SO3, Nv-g-C3N4 increased the apparent rate constant to 0.0187 min−1 for the photodegradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), which was 270% higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The enhanced photodegradation of CBZ over the Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst can be attributed to the efficient trapping of photogenerated electrons, thus inhibiting the recombination of photo-generated carriers.67 Secondary calcination of bulk g-C3N4 under an H2 atmosphere could also introduce N2c vacancies in the n-type g-C3N4, forming a g-C3N4 p–n homojunction. The formed p–n homojunction separated and transferred photogenerated electrons and holes more efficiently. Therefore, the p–n homojunction g-C3N4 catalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity. The degradation rate for RhB over the p–n homojunction g-C3N4 was about 8.3 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4.143 In addition, Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts were prepared by heating a mixture of dicyanodiamine and NaN3. The NaN3 deflagration removed partial N atoms from the precursor quickly, thus introducing N2c throughout the bulk g-C3N4. Consequently, Nv-g-C3N4 showed high photocatalytic performances in photocurrent response and degrading RhB under visible light irradiation, exceeding pristine g-C3N4.69 An intercalated hydrogen bond effect of NO3− could also help to yield ultrathin Nv-g-C3N4. The thickness, bandgap energy, specific surface area, and Nv intensity of the Nv-g-C3N4 NSs could be controlled based on the amount of NO3− in the inserted layer. A super large specific surface area and rich N2c vacancies were achieved for the optimized sample, thus providing abundant active sites and fast photogenerated charge transfer. The photocatalytic performance for the decomposition of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) (84%) was 1.75 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 powder.93 Later, oxalyl dihydrazide was adopted as an environmental atmosphere control agent to synthesize Nv-g-C3N4 with high crystallinity. The increased crystallinity and N2c vacancies could modify the interlayer and intralayer exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The optimized Nv-g-C3N4 showed high visible-light-photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), where 79.9% (60 min) and 91.5% (120 min) degradation percentages were achieved, which were 39.8% and 36.7% higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4, respectively.144 The incorporation of N2c vacancies could break the distribution of the intrinsic electronic state, forming an energetic disordered interface to facilitate the singlet exciton dissociation for the generation of free electrons and holes. Benefiting from the improved hot-electron separation and boosted hydroxyl radical production activity of Nv-g-C3N4, it exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The underlying mechanism for this photocatalytic process is shown in Fig. 8b.123


Modification by N2c vacancies and porous architecture engineering. 
Porous Nv-g-C3N4 NSs were fabricated by heating bulk g-C3N4 under an H2 atmosphere. The inclusion of N2c vacancies narrowed the energy bandgap, enhanced the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, and increased the surface area of bulk g-C3N4. The optimized sample exhibited a significantly higher PEC performance and photoelectrocatalytic activity toward the degradation of 4-CP under simulated sunlight irradiation than that of bulk g-C3N4, and the degradation percentage of 4-CP reached up to 100% after 180 min irradiation.64
Recently, a 3D macroporous structure of g-C3N4 constructed by self-assembled 2D N2c vacancy-engineered NSs was synthesized via the thermal treatment of a melamine precursor in the presence of ethylene glycol. The defect-engineered material exhibited a 3.3-fold higher degradation rate coefficient of 0.010 min−1 compared to pristine g-C3N4. The N2c vacancies modified the electronic band structure of the photocatalyst, creating a mid-band gap platform and enhancing the visible light extraction capacity. The presence of macropores increased the availability of active reaction sites, thereby increasing the reaction rate.73
The hard-template-assisted generation of porous catalysts is a well-known method, which has also been extended to prepare porous-defected g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Typically, by using SiO2 clusters as a template, mesoporous g-C3N4 was fabricated. The confined growth of carbon nitride in the presence of SiO2 clusters introduced N2c vacancies and cyano groups in the framework of carbon nitride. The introduced defects created mid-gap states below the CB, thus improving the light-harvesting efficiency and suppressing electron–hole recombination. Consequently, it showed high photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of TC and RhB under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the optimized sample demonstrated high stability after reusing for 8 consecutive photodegradation cycles.145


Co-Modification by N2c vacancies and functional groups. 
Reduced g-C3N4 with N2c vacancies and cyano functional groups was prepared via the thermal treatment of pristine g-C3N4 with NaBH4. The Nv in the g-C3N4 lattice extended the light absorption capability and efficiently transferred and separated photoexcited carriers. Simultaneously, incorporating cyano groups in the g-C3N4 framework could downshift the CB and VB positions of the reduced g-C3N4, enabling the generation of ˙OH by the oxidation of OH−. With these superior properties, the reduced g-C3N4 exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac (DCF) under visible light irradiation.91


Modification by N2c vacancies and morphology mediation. 
Hollow tubular g-C3N4 with N2c vacancies was prepared via a simple hydrothermal calcination method. The hollow tubular structure resulted in a large surface area, high multiple scattering effects of light, and directional transfer of electrons. Simultaneously, the introduction of Nv could narrow the bandgap of g-C3N4 and enhance the separation of charge carriers. The photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4 tube with appropriate Nv was much higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation, the optimized sample exhibited photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of CTC·HCl with a rate constant of 0.0123 min−1.86


Modification by N3c/NHx vacancies. 
Nv-g-C3N4 could be synthesized via the thermal treatment of acetic acid-treated melamine. The N3c vacancies played a remarkable role in controlling the electronic structure of g-C3N4, such as extending its optical absorption range and enhancing the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. The photocatalytic activity of Nv-g-C3N4 for the degradation of RhB was 2.3 times higher than that of g-C3N4.59 Furthermore, an NaOH-assisted thermal polymerization method was also reported to synthesize an NHx vacancy-modified g-C3N4 photocatalyst. The optimized sample exhibited much higher activity than pristine g-C3N4 for the degradation of tetracycline (TC), resulting from the higher separation efficiency of photoexcited charges and enhanced visible light absorption.89


Modification by Cv. 
Cv-g-C3N4 was prepared via the post-annealing treatment of pristine g-C3N4 in an N2 atmosphere. Thermal annealing introduced Cv, leading to a narrowed bandgap, decreased crystallinity, larger surface area, and higher light absorption capacity. The obtained Cv-g-C3N4 exhibited superior crystal violet (CV) photodegradation over the pristine g-C3N4. The rate-constant of Cv-g-C3N4 was nearly 2 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.146
Later, a two-step calcination method was reported to prepare Cv-g-C3N4 for the first photocatalytic applications toward the removal of bisphenol A (BPA). Compared to pristine g-C3N4, the photocatalytic degradation activity of Cv-g-C3N4 for BPA was 1.65 times larger than that of the pristine g-C3N4. On the one hand, Cv can serve as a reservoir of photogenerated electrons, enhancing the separation of photogenerated holes and electrons. On the other hand, Cv as active sites transfers the trapped electrons to the absorbed O2, generating active species (˙O2−), which play a dominant role in the degradation of BPA.48 Similarly, the thermal treatment of melamine and ammonium chloride was reported to prepare single/few-layered Cv-g-C3N4 NSs. Cv could change the planar structure of the g-C3N4 sheets, enhancing the adsorption capability of Cv-g-C3N4 towards sulfadiazine (SDZ), thus promoting its degradation. The efficiency of SDZ removal reached almost 100% within 20 min under visible-light irradiation.106
Recently, Cv-g-C3N4 NSs were synthesized via the one-step thermal polymerization of a thiosemicarbazide precursor without an auxiliary agent and extra gas protection. The higher calcination temperature and self-generating gas atmosphere (N2H4, CS2, and H2S) during the precursor polymerization prompted the introduction of Cv and the simultaneous formation of NS structures. The optimized sample exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of TC. The TC degradation efficiency was 83.3% within 90 min, which is 5.6 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. The significant improvement in photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to its extensive surface area (144.5 m2 g−1), extended visible-light absorption, negatively shifted CB position, longer charge-carrier lifetime, and faster migration of photo-induced electron–hole pairs.147


Modification by Cv and heteroatom doping. 
Cv modification and O doping were also implemented for g-C3N4via the formaldehyde-assisted thermal polycondensation of molten urea. The formaldehyde content could be used to control the Cv density. The resulting O-doped Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst with a suitable Cv concentration showed excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity for the removal of p-nitrophenol (PNP) and atrazine (ATN) from aqueous solutions, outperforming g-C3N4 and P25. The enhanced photocatalytic oxidation activity was mainly due to the synergistic effect of the Cv and O doping sites, boosting the separation and transportation of electrons and holes and enhancing the adsorption capacity of active oxygen molecules.148


Modification by Cv and morphology mediation. 
Cv-modified hierarchical g-C3N4 with a microrod morphology was prepared via the thermal treatment of a melamine-NH2OH·HCl complex. The hierarchical micro-rod interconnected NSs with rich Cv resulted in a high surface area, high light utilization efficiency, available reactive sites, and increased mass-transport channels. The hierarchical Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited an excellent photodegradation efficiency of 87.9% towards TC degradation under visible light irradiation, which was 7.3 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4.61Table 5 summarizes some representative work regarding the photocatalytic pollutant degradation over vacancy-modified g-C3N4.

Selective oxidation
Aromatic aldehydes or ketones are essential intermediates for the synthesis of drugs and chemicals.149 The selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols via the photocatalytic process for producing aromatic aldehydes or ketones has attracted growing attention due to its environmentally safe, energy-saving, and mild conditions.150–152 Photocatalysts based on g-C3N4 have a narrow bandgap and a moderate VB, which can selectively oxidize alcohols without overoxidation, thus exhibiting great potential in the photocatalytic oxidation of aromatic alcohols.153,154

Modification by N2c. 
In an investigation by Bao et al. to clarify the roles of N2c vacancies in g-C3N4−x for promoting the photocatalytic selective oxidation from benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde, Nv was found to trap photoexcited electrons, which improved the charged pair separation and enhanced the ability of adsorption and activation of the reactants O2 and BA molecules. Consequently, intermediate active species could be rapidly generated, resulting in better photocatalytic performances compared with that of the pristine g-C3N4.155


Modification by N3c/NHx vacancies. 
NHx vacancies were incorporated in the uncondensed terminal NHx lattice sites in the g-C3N4 framework to enhance its optical absorption and increase surface area. Moreover, Nv could act as an electron or hole trapping center, thus promoting the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the prepared Nv-g-C3N4 NSs showed an excellent photocatalytic performance in the aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols with molecular O2 under simulated sunlight, far exceeding that of pristine g-C3N4.27 An ultralight N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 aerogel with interconnected porosity, constructed by self-supported, crooked Nv-g-C3N4 nanolayers, could catalyze the oxidation of benzyl alcohols with high conversion efficiency and selectivity under mild conditions. The crooked Nv-g-C3N4 nanolayers with a self-supporting nature provided the Nv-g-C3N4 aerogel with a large surface area, while Nv contributed to the crooked nature and enhanced adsorption of reactants. The large surface area and sufficient N3c vacancies accounted for the excellent photocatalytic alcohol oxidation performance of the Nv-g-C3N4 aerogel compared with its bulk g-C3N4 counterpart.98 The parameters from some state-of-the-art literature on vacancy-modified g-C3N4 for photocatalytic alcohol oxidation are summarized in Table 6.

H2O2 generation
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly oxidant with widespread applications in chemical synthesis, water purification, pulp bleaching, etc.156–158 H2O2 can be produced on a large scale via an auto-oxidation process with a Pd catalyst.159 However, this process suffers from the drawbacks of high energy consumption, complex separation and concentration steps, resulting in high production costs. Alternatively, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is considered one of the most promising technologies with safe and energy-saving properties. The more negative CB of g-C3N4 relative to the reduction potential of O2/H2O2 makes g-C3N4 capable of reducing O2 to H2O2 thermodynamically. However, the low activity of g-C3N4 limits its practical applications due to its weak harvesting of visible light, limited O2 adsorption, and fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.160–162 Thus, to solve the above-mentioned problems and enhance the activity of H2O2 production, researchers have made great efforts to modify g-C3N4 frameworks by Cv/Nv. In this section, we discuss the modification of g-C3N4 by Cv/Nv to enhance its photocatalytic performance for H2O2 generation.

Modification by N2c. 
Porous g-C3N4 NSs with N2c vacancies were prepared by calcining a supramolecule assembled by a triblock copolymer, melamine, and melinic acid. The presence of N2c vacancies promoted the separation of electron–hole pairs and the adsorption of O2. For the optimal N2c-g-C3N4 sample, the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate could reach 1768 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 44.6 times higher than that of the bulk C3N4 (39.6 μmol g−1 h−1).163 Similarly, one-pot KOH-assisted calcination treatment was adopted to synthesize g-C3N4 rich in two types of cooperative Nv (i.e., NHx and N2c vacancies). It was found that the optimized sample delivered a 15 times enhancement in solar-driven H2O2 production (7.63 mmol h−1 g−1). Moreover, the AQE reached 26.78 and 11.86% at 340 and 420 nm, respectively. The NHx and N2c vacancies could accelerate the photoexcited charge separation and assist in activating oxygen in the two-electron pathway, respectively.85 A g-C3N4 photocatalyst with alkali metal dopants and N2c vacancies (ACNN) was fabricated via the facile thermal treatment of g-C3N4 and NaCl/KCl. The introduction of alkali metal dopants and Nv broadened the light absorption range and enhanced the charge separation. The synergistic effect of doping and defects improved the photocatalytic performance with an H2O2 production rate of 10.2 mmol h−1 g−1, which is 89.5 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4.164 K-doped Nv-g-C3N4 was prepared via thermal copolymerization in the presence of KOH. For photocatalytic H2O2 production, the KOH-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited remarkable activity (with a rate of 0.704 mmol h−1 g−1, i.e., 12 times higher than that of unmodified g-C3N4). KOH treatment resulted in K doping and introduction of N2c vacancies. The N2c vacancies and cyano groups resulted in superior electron-withdrawing ability, while K doping formed bridges for enhanced electron transport between the g-C3N4 layers. The synergistic effects significantly enhanced the H2O2 photogeneration performance of g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation.165 Amorphous g-C3N4 with two N2c-site vacancies in one g-C3N4 unit was prepared via a one-step H2 plasma treatment. The N2c-g-C3N4 formed by the plasma treatment was stable with a hierarchical continuous NS network structure and exhibited an ultrahigh specific surface area of 405.76 m2 g−1 (83 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (4.89 m2 g−1)) and significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production with a rate of 1874 μmol g−1 h −1.65


Modification by N3c/NHx vacancies. 
Recently, porous N3c vacancy-modified g-C3N4 was also prepared via the calcination of KOH and supramolecular-complex from melamine and cyanuric acid. Highly efficient photocatalytic H2O2 generation at a formation rate of 1.01 mmol h−1 g−1 was observed, which was 30-fold higher than pristine g-C3N4 under visible light illumination. The enhanced H2O2 generation rate was attributed to the narrower bandgap (2.5 eV), higher surface area (92 m2 g−1), and more negative charge on the surface. More importantly, an amido-functionalized polymeric structure could facilitate the proton transfer process and efficiently separate photogenerated electrons and holes.88 Holey Nv-g-C3N4, constructed by photo-assisted heating, exhibited tunable electronic structures controlled by NHx vacancies and abundant holes over the entire particle. The bandgap narrowing and creation of defect states enabled the defected g-C3N4 to harvest visible light and suppress the recombination of electron–hole pairs more efficiently than pristine g-C3N4. In addition, the abundant holes could provide defected g-C3N4 with more reductive reaction sites and facilitate intimate contact between the reactants and active sites. Consequently, the holey Nv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts were 10 times more active than the pristine bulk g-C3N4 for photocatalytic H2O2 production.70


Modification by Cv vacancies. 
Cv was introduced on the surface of g-C3N4via the calcination of the pristine g-C3N4 in Ar gas, and the obtained Cv-g-C3N4 could efficiently reduce O2 to H2O2 under visible light without any precious metal co-catalysts and organic scavengers. The H2O2 production rate over Cv-g-C3N4 was 14 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The presence of Cv could reduce the g-C3N4 symmetry and narrow its bandgap, thus increasing the excitable electrons and extending the visible light absorption. Moreover, Cv could activate O2 and change the H2O2 generation pathway from a two-step single-electron indirect way to a one-step two-electron direct way, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 8c.34 Porous g-C3N4 engineered by Cv modification and O doping was produced by microwave heating of a mixture of melamine−cyanuric acid supramolecular aggregates and oxalic acid for only 7 min. The as-prepared catalyst showed a mesoporous structure, tunable band structure, and high charge separation, which significantly enhanced the two-electron reduction pathway for the production of H2O2. The photocatalytic H2O2 production rate was 2.008 mmol h−1 g−1, which was 4 times higher than that of the pristine bulk g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the synergistic effects of the mesoporous structure, doped O atoms, and Cv defects.166Table 7 shows the typical work on the use of g-C3N4 photocatalysts with Nv or Cv in photocatalytic H2O2 production.

Conclusion and perspectives
Herein, we presented a comprehensive review of the approaches employed for the incorporation of vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework and their influence on its electronic band structure, charge separation behavior, surface area and active sites. The corresponding catalytic performances were critically discussed, including photocatalytic H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, NO removal, degradation of pollutants, and production of H2O2. The introduced vacancies in the g-C3N4 framework were classified into two types, namely Cv and Nv, where the former is located at the C3c sites, while the latter is located at the sites (i.e., amino groups, N2c and N3c sites). The introduction of Cv results in an upshift in the CB of g-C3N4 (thereby inhibiting the photo-exciton recombination), while incorporating Nv can create a mid-gap state near the CB bottom (thus narrowing the bandgap). Numerous methods, including heat treatment under different atmospheres, alkaline compound-assisted heat treatment, quick thermal treatment, thermal polymerization of a mixture of precursors, and solid-state reduction by borohydride, have been developed to realize the formation of Nv-g-C3N4. However, there has been less focus of the synthesis of Cv-g-C3N4. We presented a timeline summarizing the representative work on vacancy-modified g-C3N4 for various environmental remediation, clean energy production, and catalysis processes (Fig. 9). However, many obstacles and challenges remain to be solved. These challenges, the corresponding opportunities, and future perspectives are presented as follows.
 Fig. 9  Timeline showing the representative work on vacancy-modified g-C3N4 published over the recent 10 years. The displayed representative schemes and images are reproduced with permission from ref. 27, 42, 53–55, 75, 133, 148 and 164, with Copyright from Elsevier 2018, Elsevier 2019, ACS 2017, Wiley 2014, ACS 2012, RSC 2016, RSC 2015, Wiley 2021, and ACS 2020, respectively. 
(1) More focus on investigations of Cv-g-C3N4 over Nv-g-C3N4
Fewer methods exist for the construction of Cv-g-C3N4-based catalysts compared to that for Nv-g-C3N4, possibly implying the current limitation of the approaches for the synthesis and characterization and the less efficient fabrication of the former. Thus, developing more advanced approaches may be an exciting research focus for the preparation of Cv-g-C3N4 photocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability in the future.
(2) Exploration of high-performance g-C3N4 by co-modification with both Cv and Nv
Only a few examples of Cv and Nv co-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts have been reported to date. It is expected that the co-doping of Cv and Nv can inherit the advantages of both Cv and Nv (i.e., Nv-imparted bandgap narrowing and Cv-enabled strong reduction ability of photogenerated electrons). Therefore, it is essential to expand the exploration of Cv and Nv-co-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts, together with the investigation of the synergistic effect of Cv and Nv on the structure, morphology, and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4-based materials.
(3) Mediation of the photocatalytic performances of Cv/Nv-modified g-C3N4 coupled with oxygen-, nitrogen-, sulfur-containing functionality groups
To further enhance the visible-light harvesting and charge separation capacities, one should consider investigating the collective effect of vacancies cooperated with other group components, such as OH, CN, and CO groups. The appropriate incorporation of certain functionalities in Cv/Nv-modified g-C3N4 is expected to improve the electronic energy band structure, porosity, and photocatalytic performances.
(4) On-demand tuning of the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 by Cv/Nv modification and heteroatom doping
Given that doping with heteroatoms can create an impurity state, which enhances the visible light harvesting and charge separation efficiencies, exploring the synergistic effect of introduced vacancy and heteroatom doping (e.g., P, S, and co-doping thereof) will be another promising research direction for the generation of high-performance g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. Particularly, considering that single-atom catalysts are key research concerns to improve the utilization efficiency of metal species (especially noble metals) and produce high-performance catalytic materials,167 we believe that significant opportunities exist in single-atom metal doping together with vacancy modification of g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Synergistic effects can be expected to be generated between vacancy sites and their immobilized metal single atoms.
(5) Regulation of the photocatalytic performances of Cv/Nv-enabled g-C3N4 through morphological control
The construction of unique morphologies is generally accompanied by the generation of a larger surface area and more active sites, as well as a shorter transfer distance of charges, thus exerting a significantly positive effect on the photocatalytic performances. The development of new methods to construct g-C3N4 with unique morphologies (e.g., ultrathin sheets, highly porous structure, and ultrasmall size) combined with rich vacancies should be given more attention in future studies.
(6) Extending the application fields of vacancy-modified g-C3N4 in the photochemistry field
The currently available application fields of Cv/Nv-g-C3N4 are still limited because its development is still in its infancy, with much room available for the extension of its applications. More photocatalytic applications for vacancy-modified g-C3N4 beyond the areas summarised in this review article are encouraged to be explored, while the underlying mechanism for the associated photochemistry deserves to be understood simultaneously. It is expected that Cv/Nv can enable g-C3N4 photocatalysts to exhibit promising activity in photocatalytic oxidation applications such as the synthesis of HCHO, sterilization, and organic synthesis.
(7) Heterostructure construction based on vacancy-modified g-C3N4
The coupling of other functional semi-metals or semiconductors with vacancy-modified g-C3N4 creates more significant opportunities to produce highly visible-light-responsive photocatalysts by considering the cooperation from different components, especially the synergistic effect from the heterostructure interface. Therefore, investigating novel heterojunctions constructed by different vacancy-modified g-C3N4 and other functional semi-metals or semiconductors is highly desirable in future work.167–170 In particular, candidates capable of coupling with vacancy-modified g-C3N4 include sub-stoichiometric metal oxides with strong visible-light-absorption and redox abilities, such as WO3−x, CeO2−x, and MoO3−x.
