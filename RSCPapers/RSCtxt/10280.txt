    , Accepted 23rd February 2016First published on 2nd March 2016AbstractWe investigate the influence of solvent drenching in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbX) crystallization process with a non-solvent, toluene, during film fabrication process. We use three different precursor compositions, CH3NH3I (MAI):PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2 to unravel the crystallization mechanism with toluene drenching. The mixed halide precursor (3MAI:PbCl2) results in the highest quality films with the toluene treatment, including high surface coverage, large grains, long PL lifetimes and high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE). The neat halide-based precursors (MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2) with the treatment have increased photo-physical properties (PL lifetime and PLQE) and a surface coverage, but slightly decrease grain size in the film, while the 3MAI:PbI2 precursor has still formed numerous pinholes in the film. Mechanistically, we visually observe that the toluene drenching accelerates the nucleation at early stage of crystallization in 3MAI:PbCl2 precursor. X-ray diffraction pattern in this stage confirms the formation of both MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3, nucleation. During the crystallization process MAPbCl3 is transformed into MAPbI3 phase by the anion exchange. Toluene treatment strongly affects the ratio of MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3, nucleation and hence plays a critical role in deciding the final film morphology, their optoelectronic properties and hence their device performances.
Introduction
The metal halide perovskite family (APbX3, where X is a halide and A is typically an organic cation, CH3NH3+), has recently risen to prominence as a high quality semiconductor material,1–5 which when incorporated into solar cells delivers power conversion efficiencies (PCE) approaching that of Si solar cells.3,6 The extraordinary PCE in perovskite solar cells is strongly dependent on the morphology and crystal structure of the perovskite film, with aspects such as surface coverage, grain size, crystallinity and crystal orientation of the film being important,7,8 in addition to the less understood aspects of the nature and influence of electronic defects.9,10 The perovskite film morphology is found to be influenced by several factors such as atmospheric conditions (air or nitrogen, dry or humid) during the film fabrication,11–13 deposition methods (e.g. single step, 2-step deposition and vapor deposition), and the precursor chemical composition (e.g. methylammonium iodide (MAI):PbI2, 3MAI:PbCl2 and 3MAI:Pb-acetate trihydrate). The latter has been shown by ourselves and others to have a direct impact upon the film formation by influencing the rate of crystallization during the film fabrication process.14–19 To fabricate MAPbX3 perovskite films by a single precursor method we need to supply 1 mole of MA+ and Pb2+ to 3 moles of X−. This composition ratio can be satisfied by several precursor compositions, however each precursor composition will result in a different chemical environment in the precursor and hence during the crystallization process, leading to different morphological and crystal structure which then eventually produces perovskite films with varying photo-physical properties. In addition, an unknown variable is how the processing route has impacts on final electronic defect density and nature and location of electronic defects in the films.
Amongst the variety of methods which have been developed, a solvent drenching technique (sometimes called “dripping”), which involves dispensing a non-coordinating solvent (e.g. toluene, chlorobenzene etc.) upon the film while the film is spinning, has been shown to result in extremely smooth, high surface coverage perovskite films.20–23 However, the mechanism by which the morphology and final electronic quality of the film is influenced by toluene treatment has not been investigated with different chemical envelopment in precursor in detail.
During the film growth, nucleation and coarsening of grains are the two critical parameters that govern the film morphology. Herein we explore the effectiveness of toluene drenching on the nucleation and coarsening process during the perovskite film fabrication using different precursor compositions. We highlight the morphological changes that occur with toluene treatment and subsequently their effects on photo-physical properties. Variation in crystallization process gives rise to differences in the perovskite film coverage and grain size, which directly influences the photo-physical properties, with films originating from the 3MAI:PbCl2 composition delivering the highest quality semiconductor films and subsequent solar cells.
Experimental
Perovskite film fabrication
F-Doped tin oxide (FTO) glass or microscope glass slide were washed with 2% Hellmanex in water, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and iso-propanol. The last traces of organic residues were removed by oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min. 40 wt% perovskite precursor solutions were made by CH3NH3I (MAI):PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2 dissolving in dimethylformamide (DMF). MAI was made in our lab and used in all experiments.1,2 Each perovskite precursor solution was coated on a clean substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1200 rpm and 2000 rpm for 25 and 12 s under low humidity (15–20%) condition with a N2 parch in dry box. For solvent dripping, 350 μL of toluene was dropped onto the pre-crystallized perovskite film for 2–3 seconds with second step spin program at 2000 rpm. The perovskite film of 3MAI:PbCl2 was annealed at 100 °C for 90 min then ramp up to 120 °C for 10 min. MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. All photo-physical measurements were carried out with PMMA in chlorobenzene top coated perovskite films. The thickness of the perovskite film is fixed at 555 ± 36.0 nm in all fabrication condition for all photo-physical properties.
Device fabrication
FTO-coated glass sheets (7 Ω per sheet, Pilkington) were etched with zinc powder and 2 M HCl to obtain the required electrode pattern. The sheets were then washed with 2% Hellmanex in water, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and iso-propanol. The last traces of organic residues were removed by oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min. The FTO sheets were subsequently coated with a TiO2 compact layer with less than 100 nm thickness by spin-coating using titanium sol precursor at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The titanium sol precursor was prepared by drop wise adding a solution of 175 μL of tetra-titanium isopropoxide in 1.25 mL of ethanol into a solution of 17.5 μL of aqueous HCl solution (2 M) in 1.25 mL of ethanol. The coated FTO substrate was then heated to 300 °C for 20 min then ramp up to 500 °C for 20 min. TiO2 compact layers were treated by TiCl4, which were carried out in 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 60 min and then the TiO2 substrate was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Each perovskite film was fabricated on a TiO2 compact layer/FTO substrate using the same protocol mentioned earlier. 98 mg 2,2-(7,7-(tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-(spirobifluorene))) (spiro-OMeTAD) was solved in 1 mL chlorobenzene with additives of 10 μL tert-butylpyridine and 32 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt in acetonitrile (170 mg mL−1). A metal contact layer was deposited as the counter electrode on the HTM layer by thermal evaporation.
Characterization
A scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi S-4300) was used to acquire SEM images and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD; Panalytical X'Pert powder diffractometer) was used to analyze crystallographic properties of perovskite films on FTO substrate. Photo-physical property measurements were carried out on the glass substrate. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured by a commercial spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 300 UV-Vis, USA). Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL measurement were obtained with Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer (Fluo Time 300, PicoQuant FmbH). Perovskite films were excited using a 507 nm laser pulsed at frequencies between 1 MHz and 10 MHz. Quantum efficiency (PLQE) values were determined using a 532 nm CW laser excitation source (Suwtech LDC-800) to illuminate a sample using an integrating sphere (Oriel Instruments 70682NS), and the laser scatter and PL were collected using a fiber-coupled detector (Ocean Optics USB 2000+). PLQE calculations were carried out using established techniques.9 The laser intensity was adjusted using optical density filters. The cell performance evaluated by the current–voltage (J–V) measurements under simulated solar light (AAB ABET technologies Sun 2000 solar simulator) with its light intensity, 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5), calibrated against a standard amorphous-silicon PV cell (NREL-calibrated KG5 filtered silicon reference cell). The J–V curves were measured by short circuit (0.1 V) to forward bias (−1.4 V) and forward bias (−1.4 V) to short circuit (0.1 V). The cell aperture area of light incidence was set to 0.0625 cm2 by the use of a mask on 0.15 cm2 (0.3 cm × 0.5 cm) photoactive area. The “stabilized power output” of the devices versus time was measured under load near the maximum power point at the same conditions.
Result and discussions
Microstructure and crystallographic analysis
In this study, we use three different precursor compositions, MAI:PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2 dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) to investigate the influence of toluene drenching on the perovskite (MAPbI3) film fabrication. Perovskite films fabricated from the mixed halide (3MAI:PbCl2) precursor may contain some Cl− in the lattice (i.e. MAPbIxCly), however the concentration of Cl− doping is reported to be so low that we consider the predominant phase to be similar to the MAPbI3.15,24
In Fig. 1a–c we show the SEM images of the perovskite films fabricated from the different precursors (i.e. MAI:PbI2, 3MAI:PbCl2 and 3MAI:PbI2), cast without the toluene drenching. The SEM images highlight the variation in the film coverage as well as on the grain size of the perovskite films. Precursors with stoichiometric ratios of MAI and PbI2 (i.e. containing no excess methyl ammonium halide) produces better coverage and smaller grains, as compared with the perovskite films fabricated using 3MAI:PbI2 precursors. If we compare the 3MAI:PbCl2 and 3MAI:PbI2 routes, the mixed halide precursor produces perovskite films with much larger and more uniform grains and also with fewer pinholes throughout the film. Especially, severe cracks can be observed the film when fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of perovskite films with different precursors for (a and d) w/o toluene and with toluene in MAI:PbI2, (b and e) w/o toluene and with toluene in 3MAI:PbCl2, (c and f) w/o toluene and with toluene in 3MAI:PbI2. 
By performing the toluene treatment on the different precursors, we observe contrasting differences in the resulting film morphologies (Fig. 1d–f). Due to the toluene treatment, the perovskite film coverage significantly improves for all perovskite precursors. The main differences between precursor compositions that we observe, is in grain sizes of the respective perovskite films. Even without a toluene treatment the mixed halide (3MAI:PbCl2) precursor shows larger grain sizes than its other precursor analogue. Performing toluene drenching further enlarges the grain size in this case. On the other hand, the grain size of the perovskite film fabricated from the MAI:PbI2 decrease with the toluene treatment, while 3MAI:PbI2 precursor shows no clear difference in the grain size after the toluene drenching.
We analyze the phase purity and influence of the toluene treatment on the crystallinity of the perovskite films fabricated from the different precursors by PXRD (Fig. 2). We first compare the films prepared from PbI2, with and without an excess of MAI with similar annealing condition. The perovskite crystals in the films formed by MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 show (110) at 2θ = 14.2° and (220) at 2θ = 28.45° reflections that are in complete agreement with the previously reported structure at room temperature.25 Qualitatively we find three major differences in the perovskite films fabricated by using MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 precursors. Firstly, the films fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2 show a clear splitting of reflections at 2θ angles 28.18° and 28.45°, however there are no clear peak-splitting obtained at the same angles for MAI:PbI2. Secondly, the intensity of (110) reflection in 3MAI:PbI2 is 3 times higher as compared with MAI:PbI2, indicating higher crystallinity for perovskite film fabricated from MAI:PbI2 precursor at the same annealing conditions. Thirdly, the lattice parameters and cell volume measured by PXRD is larger for MAI:PbI2 as compared with 3MAI:PbI2 as we show in Table S1.† There is also a difference in peak width between MAI:PbI2 (FWHM: 0.075°) and 3MAI:PbI2 (FWHM: 0.148°) for (110) reflection, indicating larger crystallite size of the former (114 nm versus 57.8 nm, respectively). We note that these crystallite sizes are estimated from the Scherrer equation. Furthermore, we also observe a (001) peak of PbI2 in MAI:PbI2, similar peak is not present in the case of films fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2.

(b) XRD patterns showing (110) and (220) reflections for the three perovskite precursors. A clear splitting of (004) and (220) in the case of 3MAI:PbI2. 
With the toluene treatment perovskite fabricated from PbI2-based precursors show no variation in the crystal symmetry but the crystallinity of these films are strongly affected, which we infer from the decrease in the XRD reflection intensities at (hk0) for MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 (Fig. 2b). We also extracted the lattice parameter from the X-ray diffraction pattern, which we have shown in Table S1.† We observe a slight lattice expansion for 3MAI:PbI2 precursors with toluene treatment, while MAI:PbI2 shows no such variation in the lattice parameters. MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 show opposite trends in the difference in the crystallite size with and without the toluene treatment.
The films fabricated using the mixed halide (3MAI:PbCl2) precursor also shows a tetragonal crystal structure but with much higher reflection intensities of (hk0) reflections as compared with the perovskite fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2 and MAI:PbI2. This may be due to the strong preferential orientation in the (hk0) direction as reported by Y. Zhu et al.26 The calculated average crystallite size is slightly higher than stoichiometric MAI:PbI2 precursor. Upon toluene drenching, the films produced from 3MAI:PbCl2 retain the same crystal structure. However, the toluene drenching enhances crystallinity of 3MAI:PbCl2. Furthermore, crystallite size increases with the drenching, but it decreases the lattice parameter and cell volume as compared to the film without toluene treatment. Based on the above observation we speculate that perovskite crystal may incorporate relatively higher amount of Cl− into the crystal lattice after the toluene treatment, however further investigation is required to gain more insight on this.
To understand the role of toluene treatment on the crystallization process in the different precursor compositions, we captured in situ optical micrographs of all three precursors during the annealing process. In Fig. 3, we show optical images of the films at different stages of crystallization (i.e. just after spinning at 25 °C, annealed at 60 °C for 5 min and annealed at 100 °C for 60 min).
 Fig. 3  Optical micrographs taken during the in situ thermal annealing of three different precursors. The micrographs were captured at 25 °C for 0 min, 60 °C for 5 min and 100 °C for 60 minutes. 
We first discuss the crystallization process of the film deposited from the mixed halide precursor (3MAI:PbCl2) without toluene treatment and this we show in Fig. 3a1–3. Immediately after spin coating we observe formation of yellow/transparent dendrites at room temperature (Fig. 3a1). We will come back to this point later on, but for now we will assume that the yellow/clear dendrites are crystals of a chloride rich “precursor” phase.16 Several brown colour nucleation, which we infer to be iodide-rich nucleation, begin to appear around the yellow/transparent dendrites when we thermally anneal the film at 60 °C for 5 min (Fig. 3a2). As the annealing progresses, these brown, iodide rich, crystals grow in size while assimilating the chloride-rich transparent dendrites (Fig. 3a3). For the films processed with the toluene drenching, both brown (iodide rich) appeared just after spinning the precursors at 25 °C along with transparent (chloride rich) nucleation (Fig. 3a4). Interestingly, in this case, the transparent domains surround the brown nucleation, during the 60 °C for 5 min anneal, the brown phase grows over the adjoining chloride-rich transparent phase giving rise to a large network of iodide rich perovskite crystals. With further annealing at 100 °C for 60 min (Fig. 3a6) the iodide-rich perovskite crystals continued to grow and fully coalesce forming a continuous film with large grains. To confirm the crystal composition and structure of the brown and transparent/yellow colour nucleation, we performed X-ray analysis at different stages of crystallization process. In Fig. 4, we show XRD patterns of the mixed halide perovskite films with the 60 °C for 5 min annealing. XRD patterns of with and without toluene treated films show (110), (220) and (004) peaks corresponding to the MAPbI3 along with the (001) and (002) peaks of MAPbCl3 crystals. This observation confirms the presence of both MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 where the brown and transparent/yellow coloured nucleations can be attributed to the neat MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3, respectively. The intensity of (001) peaks of MAPbCl3 is 5 times higher than the (110) peak in from MAPbI3 indicating precedence MAPbCl3 formation over MAPbI3 phase at the early stage of annealing. Subsequent annealing (e.g. 100 °C for 1 h) leads to the disappearance of the peaks associated with MAPbCl3 composition and simultaneously increases the MAPbI3 reflections. During the crystal growth, MAPbCl3 phase acts as a template for MAPbI3 in which Cl− ions are replaced by the I− transforming MAPbCl3 phase into MAPbI3 phase. This observation is in agreement with the previous studies by several authors.11,15,19,34 We can therefore summaries that 3MAI:PbCl2 precursor with the toluene drenching induces a higher initial density of homogeneous nucleation, where MAPbCl3 transparent phase forms as a large-network template crystal to grow MAPbI3 crystals. This subsequently facilitates growth of perovskite grains which are continuous and large and with preferred orientation as compared with the non-toluene treated films. It is likely that the homogeneity of the nucleation and grown environment within the transparent phases is important for the enhanced PLQE.

In the case of MAI:PbI2, just after the spin coating the precursor many rod shaped brown colored interconnected crystals are formed (Fig. 3b1). These rod shaped species are actually preferred agglomeration of small spherical grains as we can resolve them in SEM image (shown in Fig. 1). The web-like film morphology creates huge number of pinholes throughout the film. Subsequent annealing does not induce any identifiable change in the film morphology (Fig. 3b2 and 3). The crystallization process of the same MAI:PbI2 precursor with toluene treatment shows completely different film morphology just after the spinning the precursor. We observe that the entire substrate is covered with small and uniformly distributed spherical brown crystals and do not observe any rod shaped preferred agglomeration throughout the film (Fig. 3b4). This suggests that the toluene treatment may have broken the preferred colloidal structure or simply sped up the crystallization by increasing the nucleation density in the film. We do not observe any identifiable further changes in the perovskite film morphology due to subsequent annealing (Fig. 3b5 and 6). XRD patterns of with and without toluene treated films show (110), (220) and (004) peaks, which belongs to MAPbI3 phase, confirming the brown colour crystals to be of MAPbI3 crystals (Fig. 4). Interestingly, intensities of reflections after toluene treatment appear to have decreased as compared to the film without toluene drenching. But the FWHM of (110) and (220) peaks becomes broader after the toluene treatment. From this result, it is confirmed that in 3MAI:PbI2 precursor perovskite crystals are formed just after spinning and toluene treatment further sped up the crystallisation process.
Finally, we investigate the film made from 3MAI:PbI2 precursor (Fig. 3c) where, in the absence of toluene treatment, fewer brown colored iodide-rich nucleation centers are formed as compared with MAI:PbI2 (Fig. 3c1). With the subsequent annealing (60 °C for 5 min), these nucleation sites increased in number. During the course of annealing (at 100 °C for 15 min) Ostwald ripening leads to fabrication of film with interconnected perovskite crystals, accompanied with several pinholes throughout the film. For the films processed with toluene drenching, we observe an increase in the density of nucleation crystals at 25 °C (Fig. 3c4) and annealing at 100 °C for 60 min produces a film with relatively larger grains but with several pinholes. When the similar film is fabricated via toluene drenching at 25 °C (Fig. 3c4), a larger nucleation sites are observed and annealing at 100 °C for 60 min produces a film with relatively larger grains but with numerous pinholes. XRD pattern in Fig. 4 show a similar observation with MAI:PbI2 with the toluene drenching. In addition to that the XRD pattern also shows a peak pertaining to an intermediate phase at 2θ = 14.5°, which can be attributed to the excess presence of MAI in the precursor. We speculate that these “nucleation sites” originate in the precursor solution itself in the form of colloids or soft frame works of MAPbI3.14 It appears that in the neat PbI2-based precursor (i.e. MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2) form colloidal soft framework in the precursor itself and are dismantled when toluene is drenched upon while spin coating. However, formation of MAPbCl3 in the mixed halide precursor is more preferred.
We believe that the solvent drenching method is highly sensitive to the stage at which the solvent is drenched and the intermediate phase is formed during the deposition process therefore previous authors have found varying observation with the toluene drenching method.
Photo-physical properties
In Fig. 5 we analyze the photo-physical properties of the perovskite films fabricated on a glass substrate with and without toluene treatment from different precursors (i.e. MAI:PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2). We note that the thickness of the perovskite films fabricated from the different precursors were approximately 560 ± 40 nm. The UV-Vis absorption spectra show a much higher absorbance for the mixed halide precursor (3MAI:PbCl2) than the other two precursors (Fig. 5a). The absorbance of the films fabricated from 3MAI:PbCl2 is strongest of all, and the absorbance of the MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 are almost comparable to each other. The toluene drenching enhances the absorbance of films fabricated from all precursors. But this enhancement is more pronounced in the case of the MAI:PbI2 precursor, likely due to a dramatic change in the surface coverage of the film reaching close to 100% for the toluene drenched films (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films fabricated using three different precursors with and without toluene treatment, (b) steady-state PL spectra, (c) time-resolved PL kinetics and (d) relationship between PLQE vs. excitation power. The error bars are estimated from at least 4 different samples. 
We expect the absorbance in the perovskite films to be influenced by the surface coverage and the grain size.27 Higher surface coverage ensures that less light passes straight through the films in the regions of the pin-holes. Steady-state time integrated photoluminescence (PL) emission, which we present in Fig. 5b, show remarkably higher PL intensity for the films fabricated from the mixed halide precursor than the other two precursors discussed here. Looking at the PL peak position, the mixed halide precursor i.e. 3MAI:PbCl2 (787 nm) is 14 nm red shifted to 3MAI:PbI2 (778 nm) and 5 nm blue shifted with respect to MAI:PbI2 (792 nm) precursor. We also observe, a much longer mono-exponential PL life time of 252 ns for the mixed halide precursors (3MAI:PbCl2) in comparison to the 107 and 140 ns for MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2, respectively (Fig. 5c). Upon the toluene drenching, the PL intensity and PL lifetime improve across the board for all three precursor compositions (Fig. 5b and c). The PL lifetime of the MAI:PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2 increases from 107, 140 and 252 ns to 148, 533 and 670 ns, respectively. We expect the PL to be influenced by the electronic defects and the crystallite size of the perovskite crystals.28 In addition the resulting crystal structure and symmetry is also likely to be influential upon the PL.12,29 Decrease in the crystallite size leads to the blue shift in the PL emission.17 Similarly, the better quality films with lesser electronic defect density eliminates sub band trap states and hence results into blue shift in the PL emission of the material.12,29 As the perovskite from mixed halide has lower electronic defect density (which is evident in the longer PL life time and higher PLQE value which we will discuss in the following section). Therefore, the actual trend in the PL peak position could be the competitive effect of the two (i.e. electronic defect density and crystallite size).30
To further quantify the radiative defect states in the perovskite films deposited from different precursors, we performed intensity dependent photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) measurements, as we show in Fig. 3d. The highest PLQE without toluene treatment is achieved for the mixed halide (3MAI:PbCl2) precursor (11.5 ± 1.60%) and the lowest PLQE shows with MAI:PbI2 precursor (2.85 ± 0.05%) when exited at. 200 mW cm−2. We also observe that 3MAI:PbCl2 and 3MAI:PbI2 precursors show a rise in their PLQE value with the increasing excitation power until they reach a saturation level, which could be due to filling up of the trap states in the perovskite film.9,31
The films fabricated from mixed halide 3MAI:PbCl2 and 3MAI:PbI2 precursor, show an increased PLQE after toluene treatment. Both of these precursors contain excess MAI component in their respective precursor composition. The rise in PLQE with increasing excitation power is particularly significant for the films fabricated from the mixed halide precursor (3MAI:PbCl2) (Fig. 5d), reaching 31.1 ± 1.90% PLQE at 240 mW cm−2. In contrast, films fabricated from the stoichiometric MAI:PbI2 precursor (PLQE: 4.01 ± 0.45% at 240 mW cm−2) shows no measurable improvement with the toluene treatment. We expect that the change in PLQE is associated with a varying density of electronic defect sites in the perovskite film, which are responsible for non-radiative trap assisted recombination. To a first order approximation we can correlate the observed differences in PLQE with the difference in their grain size. Grain boundaries have been observed to be regions for predominantly non-radiative decay in the as processed films.29 This perovskite films with larger grains will have fewer “dark” regions in the films.32,33 In addition to grain boundaries, heterogeneity in the brightness of each grain also strongly influences overall PLQE. deQuilettes studied the microscopic PL intensity in films processed from the 3MAI:PbCl2 route (without toluene drenching) and observed a coincidence of bright emission with residual Cl content detectable in the grains.29 The enhanced PL, which we observe here for the films processed from 3MAI:PbCl2, which is further enhanced by the toluene drenching, may therefore be a combination of both larger grains, and also a larger occurrence of bright grains, in some way enabled by the precise mixed halide chemistry we employ.
Photovoltaic performances
We fabricated planar heterojunction solar cells using the different perovskite precursors. In Table 1, we summarize the average cell performance parameters of 15 devices per variation, with both forward and backward scans.35 We observe that the PCE of the perovskite solar cells fabricated from the mixed halide precursor (3MAI:PbCl2) (without toluene treatment) are 2 and 3 times higher than the PCE of the MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 based perovskite devices, respectively. The higher PCE of 3MAI:PbCl2 device is due to their higher value of all performance parameters (open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc)), but it is mainly the Jsc which contributes a 1.5 times increase in comparison to the MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 devices. Interestingly, the PCE of the devices fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2 precursor are even lower than that of the equimolar MAI:PbI2 precursor, which is most apparent in the lower open circuit voltage (Voc). Although, the hysteresis in J–V scans from forward (Jsc to Voc) and backward (Voc to Jsc) scans is present in all precursor compositions, it is less severe in the case of the mixed halide (3MAI:PbCl2) based precursor as compared with the MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 based perovskite solar cells. We also show the stabilized power output (SPO) of the devices (in Fig. 6d–f), which is a critical parameter in the event of hysteresis in the J–V scans.35 Devices fabricated from 3MAI:PbCl2 precursor stabilizes at higher JStab and SPO values (8.49 ± 1.56 mA cm−2 and 6.16 ± 0.71% respectively) as compared to the MAI:PbI2 (JStab: 4.08 ± 2.07 mA cm−2 and SPO 2.01 ± 1.47%) and 3MAI:PbI2 (JStab 2.73 ± 0.57 mA cm−2 and SPO 1.09 ± 0.32%) based perovskite device.

 Fig. 6  
J–V curves for perovskite solar cells, in which the perovskite layer was formed from (a) MAI:PbI2, (b) 3MAI:PbCl2 and (c) 3MAI:PbI2. J–V curves were recorded under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5). The performance parameters of these J–V curves are show in Table S2.† Stabilized power output and photocurrent density for the perovskite solar cells made from (d) MAI:PbI2, (e) 3MAI:PbCl2 and (f) 3MAI:PbI2. 
Upon toluene drenching during film fabrication, we see a remarkable improvement in all device performance parameters and also on the stabilized power output of the devices. The incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra of each perovskite solar cells are presented in Fig. S1.† Upon toluene drenching, IPCE value of 3MAI:PbCl2 based perovskite solar cells is increased 10% higher (i.e. 67% to 78%) over entire wavelength as compared with the device fabricated without toluene drenching. The device improvement is consistent with their improved film morphology (Fig. 1) and lowered electronic disorder in the films after the toluene treatment (Fig. 5). We attribute the higher performance of the 3MAI:PbCl2 based perovskite device, which delivers an SPO of 12.7 ± 1.3%, as compared with the MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbI2 precursor based devices, to the much lower density of electronic disorder in the film (which we infer from the longer PL lifetime and higher PLQE). The improved quality may be due to the combined effect of larger grain size, and the preferred crystal orientation in the (hk0) direction in the perovskite film, with the latter being influenced by the starting chemistry employing PbCl2.
On the other hand, the device fabricated from 3MAI:PbI2 shows the lowest device performance among the three different perovskite precursors, although the PL lifetime and PLQE value are higher than the MAI:PbI2 precursor. Toluene treatment does improve the device performance, its J–V measured PCE remains less than 6% and this improvement does not match up with the extent of improvement in PLQE. In this particular case, the higher quantum yield and longer PL lifetime does not translate into higher device performance, which could be due to the existence of pin-holes, as we have shown in Fig. 1, which dominate the poor operation of the solar cell.
Conclusions
We have investigated the impact of toluene drenching on three different perovskite precursors MAI:PbI2, 3MAI:PbI2 and 3MAI:PbCl2. Notably, we have captured the optical micrographs during the early stage of crystallisation process with the toluene drenching and their subsequent growth during the annealing process. We have observed that toluene drenching clearly affect to the early stage of crystallization in the perovskite film during the fabrication. However, the effectiveness of toluene treatment in generating nucleation and subsequent growth of grains is strongly influenced by the chemical composition of the precursor solution. We highlight the impact of the excess ratio of MAI vs. the lead salt in the precursor. In addition to this, we have also shed light on influence of lead source (PbCl2vs. PbI2) in the morphological evolution and their subsequent effect upon the device performance. For the 3MAI:PbCl2 route, we observe that the homogeneous nucleation of MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 and their growth within the intermediate domains is markedly enhanced with the application of the toluene drenching, leading to a drastically improved surface coverage and formation of the large grain domains as well. The optimised process shows a much longer PL lifetime and higher PLQE reaching up to 33% and subsequently delivers the highest photovoltaic performances as compared with the other two precursors and the films without toluene drenching. This work has shed another level of understanding on the complex growth of perovskite thin films from solution. This should assist the path for realizing further increase of the PCE, and understanding how to manufacture perovskite solar cells.
