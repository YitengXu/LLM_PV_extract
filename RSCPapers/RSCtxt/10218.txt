    , Accepted 30th August 2016First published on 31st August 2016AbstractTransition metal phosphides (TMP) have been one of the excellent candidates as low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts for the sustainable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, construction of TMP with abundant exposed active sites is of urgent concern and highly desirable for the HER. Herein, we report a novel strategy to configure integrated active site-enriched architectures (Fe2P-ND/FG) composed of diiron phosphide (Fe2P) nanodots with a diameter of ∼2.5 nm uniformly anchored on porous and fluffy graphene sheets (FG). The interconnected conductive networks within porous FG favor the formation of uniformly and highly dispersed Fe2P nanodots, finally helping the promotion of fast electrolyte ion and electron transfer during the electrochemical process. Compared with bulk Fe2P, these ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots lead to abundant exposed edges and atoms. Benefiting from the highly exposed active sites derived from Fe2P nanodots and superior electrical conductivity stemming from an interconnected graphene matrix, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids exhibit outstanding HER catalytic activity and stability. Overpotentials as low as 44 and 91 mV are required to achieve current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The present strategy provides a novel approach for configuring electrode materials with highly exposed active sites for high-efficiency energy storage/conversion devices.
1. Introduction
To create an eco-friendly and sustainable energy infrastructure in the future, hydrogen, as a clean and highly efficient energy carrier, is one of the promising alternatives to fossil fuels. At present, the main ways to produce hydrogen including methane steam reforming and coal gasification consume fossil fuels and emit quantities of carbon dioxide. Electrolysis of water coupled to solar or wind renewable energy sources has stimulated extensive concern to produce sustainable and high purity hydrogen without carbon emission.1–6 For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, electrocatalysts with a low overpotential and high stability are highly sought after. The noble metal Pt catalyst is widely used and exhibits excellent performance for the HER, nevertheless, its rareness and high cost inhibit its large-scale and practical application to a great degree.7,8 It is found that the heterogeneous non-noble metal electrocatalysts, including transition-metal dichalcogenides,9–13 carbides,14–17 nitrides,18 selenides,19,20 and phosphides,21–23 feature high catalytic activity and acid-stability properties for the HER, being of great potential to replace noble metals in practical application. Of these non-noble metal electrocatalysts available now, transition-metal phosphides (TMP) such as Ni2P,21,24,25 CoP,26–28 Fe2P,29 Fe0.5Co0.5P4 and MoP30 are quite attractive owing to their superior electrochemical activity, as evidenced by experimental results and theoretical calculations,4,21,31 especially, iron-based catalysts (iron phosphides).32 Moreover, the crystal structure of TMP features the trigonal prisms owing to the large radius of phosphorus atoms (0.109 nm) and is prone to form an isotropic crystal structure. This further leads to numerous unsaturated surface atoms on the TMP surface, thus producing intrinsically high catalytic activity for the HER.33 Nevertheless, relatively less exposed active sites and poor electronic transfer capacity still inhibit their electrochemical performance to some degree.4,34 In this case, construction of the nano-sized TMP with abundant active edges, and assembling them on a conductive matrix will be an efficient strategy and highly sought after for the HER.
Great efforts have been dedicated to address these issues of concern.35–37 It has also been demonstrated that the integrated composites made of carbon and TMP can meet these requirements. The existing carbon species, featuring high acid-stability and eco-friendliness, such as carbon nanotubes,38–40 carbon fibers,41 porous carbon34,36 and graphene,12,37,42–46 offer rapid electron transport and interconnected channels for facilitating electrolyte transport and gas release. In particular, graphene with a single atomic layer thickness exhibits intriguing superiorities as a catalyst support for the HER owing to its remarkable electron transfer properties and large specific surface area.12,47–49 Incorporation of a TMP catalyst into the graphene matrix can effectively prevent the catalyst from aggregating to bulks, leading to abundant exposed active sites and further improving the utilization of active sites. The highly conductive networks and large specific surface area derived from graphene can also facilitate fast electron transport and increase the contact area with the electrolyte, respectively.37,50 However, it still remains a challenge to develop tailor-made integrated architectures composed of active site-enriched TMP nanoparticles decorated on graphene sheets with a low overpotential and superior stability for the HER.
In the present study, we report a novel strategy to configure the integrated active site-enriched architectures (Fe2P-ND/FG) composed of diiron phosphide (Fe2P) nanodots with a diameter of ∼2.5 nm assembled on porous and fluffy graphene sheets (FG). The small-sized Fe2P can uniformly disperse on the conductive FG surface, leading to highly exposed and accessible active sites to the electrolyte. In addition, the FG with a relatively loose structure and interconnected networks can further prevent highly dispersed small-sized Fe2P nanodots from aggregating and provide large yet active interfaces between the tri-phase (solid–liquid–gas) regions. These unique structures endow the Fe2P-ND/FG with superior electrochemical catalytic activities and stability for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4. The as-made Fe2P-ND/FG can deliver overpotentials as low as 44 and 91 mV (with iR compensation) for achieving current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, together with the high cycling stability and durability for the HER.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of FG
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by a modified Hummer's method,51 and then dried by a freeze-drying method. The freeze-dried GO was rapidly put into a pre-heated 300 °C tube furnace and kept for 5 min, yielding the FG sample.
2.2 Synthesis of Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids
Typically, 30 mg of FG was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol by a strong ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (30 mg) was dissolved in 15 mL of ethanol, and then it was added dropwise to an FG ethanol solution under strong stirring and sonicated for another 10 min to form a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was naturally dried under magnetic stirring at room temperature. The dried product was annealed in a tube furnace at 200 °C for 10 h in a N2 atmosphere, yielding the Fe2O3-ND/FG. The as-obtained Fe2O3-ND/FG was mixed with sodium hypophosphite at a mass ratio of 1 to 5, and heated at 300 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in a N2 atmosphere. Then, the sample was washed and dried at 60 °C for 10 h, yielding the Fe2P-ND/FG. For comparison, the Fe2P/G was also synthesized following the same procedure with freeze-dried GO instead of FG. Meanwhile, the pure Fe2P sample was also synthesized in the absence of FG.
2.3 Materials characterization
The as-made samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM 450), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/MAX-2400, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai F30), inductively coupled plasma (ICP, Optima 2000DV, Perkin Elmer) spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250). The zeta potential was measured using a ZETASIZER nano-series Nano-ZS90. The weight ratio of the FG in hybrids was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA449F3) from 30 to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 in the air. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution were calculated based on the data recorded on a physical sorption instrument (Micromeritics 3Flex 3500).
2.4 Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4, with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in a three-electrode system controlled by a CHI 760 D workstation. Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte was purged with argon for 30 min. Polarization curves were obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) controlled at a speed of 1600 r.p.m. All polarization curves were corrected with iR compensation. All the potentials reported in our work were versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at η = 150 mV from 100000 to 0.1 Hz by applying an amplitude of 5 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. The HER performance of as-prepared samples under neutral and alkaline conditions was also recorded with 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 M KOH as the electrolyte, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.059 V × pH.
2.5 Preparation of working electrodes
The working electrode was prepared by coating the catalyst onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a diameter of 5 mm. First of all, 4 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL solution consisting of 200 μL of deionized water, 780 μL of ethanol, and 20 μL of 5 wt% Nafion. The as-made dispersion solution was sonicated for 30 min. Then 20 μL of the solution was dropped onto a GCE and dried at room temperature, yielding working electrodes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of Fe2P-ND/FG
As shown in Fig. 1a, the FG was prepared by fast thermal reduction of freeze-dried GO in a preheated furnace tube (for more details please see the Experimental section). It is also pointed out that such a process can lead to rapid removal of functional groups on the GO surface, and help graphene layers to overcome the van der Waals force between the layers and form a loose structure with a large layer space.52,53 The structures of the original GO and FG were characterized by XRD and FE-SEM. It can be noted that the characteristic (002) diffraction peak of GO is present at 11.5°, corresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0.775 nm (Fig. 2a). After rapid thermal expansion, it is noted that the sharp peak at 11.5° disappears, indicating that the functional groups on the surface are removed to a great degree.54 Compared with GO (Fig. S1†), the FG shows a loose porous structure composed of thin graphene sheets (Fig. 2b and c). Benefitting from this unique structure, the as-made FG has a high BET specific surface area of 452 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of GO (22 m2 g−1). As illustrated in Fig. S2a,† the typical type IV isotherms and hysteresis loops of type H3 are observed, indicative of the combined mesoporous and macroporous structure of the FG, which is further demonstrated by the pore size distributions of the FG derived from the density functional theory (DFT) method in Fig. S2b.† This relatively loose and porous structure of FG will be helpful for loading highly dispersed ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots and provide large yet active interfaces between the tri-phase (solid–liquid–gas) regions.

The typical preparation processes for Fe2P-ND/FG architectures are shown in Fig. 1b (for details please see the Experimental section). For a typical run, after the rapid thermal reduction of GO at 300 °C, the as-produced FG with the relatively loose structure was mixed with ferric nitrate in ethanol. The Fe3+ ions can be adsorbed onto the surface by the electrostatic interaction (see Fig. S3† for the zeta potentials of the FG at different pH values), as illustrated in the inset of Fig. S3.† Then, Fe2O3 was in situ grown and anchored on the surface of the FG by low-temperature decomposition, yielding the Fe2P-ND/FG precursor (Fe2O3-ND/FG). The Fe2O3-ND/FG precursor still retains the loose and folded structure of FG with no obvious bulk Fe2O3, and Fe is homogenously distributed on the FG (Fig. S4†). The as-obtained precursor was further mixed with sodium hypophosphite, followed by a phosphorization process at 300 °C, yielding the Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids.
The typical FE-SEM images of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids are shown in Fig. 2d–f. It can be clearly noted that the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG still retains the relatively loose structure derived from the crumpled FG.55 The relatively loose structure can provide a large tri-phase (solid–liquid–gas) contact area, achieve the high exposure of active sites for catalysts and intimate contact with the electrolyte, and promote fast mass transfer, thus further enhancing the reaction kinetics and improving the effective utilization of the active sites. Interestingly, it is difficult to identify the Fe2P particles assembled on the surface of the FG, even at a high magnification (Fig. 2f). Nevertheless, the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping (Fig. 2g) and spectrum (Fig. S5†) of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids clearly reveal the presence of Fe and P elements that are uniformly distributed on graphene sheets with an Fe to P atomic ratio of 2.2:1, which is consistent with the ICP results (2.1:1), implying the ultrasmall features of Fe2P particles. For comparison, the Fe2P/G sample was also synthesized by directly mixing ferric nitrate and freeze-dried GO in ethanol followed by the same thermal decomposition and low-temperature phosphorization processes. Meanwhile, the pure Fe2P was also fabricated in the absence of FG. It is found that in the absence of FG, the pure Fe2P features a heterogeneous rod structure and the diameter of Fe2P changes in a range of 100–500 nm (Fig. S6a–c†). In the case of the Fe2P/G sample, it can be found that graphene sheets seriously stack and rod-shaped Fe2P with a relatively large size disperses on the graphene sheets (Fig. S6d–f†). The reason for this would be that the GO sheets with a negative charge are neutralized by the ferric ions in the solution and seriously restack in the following process.56 This is not the case for Fe2P-ND/FG, as discussed above, the pre-reduced FG with a large layer space derived from the loose porous structure can avoid such an issue to some degree. These further confirm that the FG is helpful for dispersing and promoting the formation of ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots. Benefiting from this unique structure, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG (Fig. S2d†) also has a higher surface area (113 m2 g−1) than that of Fe2P/G (51 m2 g−1) and Fe2P (13 m2 g−1).
The typical powder XRD patterns of the as-made Fe2O3, Fe2O3-ND/FG, Fe2P, and Fe2P-ND/FG samples are shown in Fig. 3a. It can be noted that the characteristic diffraction peaks of Fe2O3 are observed at 33.2, 35.7, 40.9, 49.5, 54.1, and 62.4°, which correspond to the (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), and (214) planes, respectively (JCPDS card no. 33-0664). After phosphorization, the characteristic peaks for Fe2O3 disappear and new peaks that correspond to the (110), (200), (111), (201), (210), and (211) plane reflections of the Fe2P standard pattern (JCPDS card no. 33-0670) are observed at 30.5, 35.3, 40.3, 44.4, 47.4, and 54.7°, respectively. Nevertheless, it is also noted that in the presence of FG, the relatively broad and weak diffraction peaks are observed for Fe2O3-ND/FG and Fe2P-ND/FG samples, indicative of small-sized Fe2O3 and Fe2P nanoparticles dispersed on the FG surface.55 In the case of the XRD pattern of Fe2P/G (Fig. S7†), the typical Fe2P peaks (JCPDS card no. 33-0670) are present, which would be ascribed to the large-sized nanorods in the Fe2P/G (Fig. S6d–f†). In order to get more surface electronic state information of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG, the hybrids were characterized by XPS and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3b–d. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3b) of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG can be divided and fitted into four peaks: O–CO (288.8 eV), CO (286.1 eV), C–C/CC (284.5 eV) and C–O (285.3 eV).51,57 The high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p (Fig. 3c) shows two peaks at binding energies of 720.0 and 707.1 eV, which are assigned to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 in Fe2P, respectively.29,58 In the case of the P 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 3d), it can be noted that two types of surface P species, including iron phosphate (P 2p3/2 133.7 eV) and Fe2P (P 2p3/2 129.8 eV), are observed.29,58 The peak of iron phosphate at 133.7 eV is attributed to the partial oxidation of surface Fe2P nanodots when exposed to air, which is a common phenomenon in TMP.35,59 In order to further confirm this point, XPS depth profile analysis for the near-surface of pure Fe2P is adopted and carried out. It is also noted from Fig. S8† that the peak positions of the binding energy are consistent with those of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG. Nevertheless, the surface phosphate content rapidly decreases with the increase of Ar ion etching time, which further confirms that phosphate species only exist on the surface of the sample. It is also pointed out that such surface phosphate species on the catalyst surface can be removed during HER catalysis in a reducing environment in a strongly acidic medium, and have no influence on the catalytic activity.4,35 The carbon content in the hybrids was evaluated by TGA of Fe2O3-ND/FG, indicative of the carbon content of ca. 63 wt% (Fig. S9†). In order to further reveal the contribution of P species to the electrochemical performance, the FG-P sample was also fabricated by the same low-temperature phosphorization process in the absence of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. The ICP result shows that the mass fraction of the P content is 1.07 wt%, while the corresponding XPS results (Fig. S10†) show that the C 1s spectrum (Fig. S10a†) can be divided and fitted into four peaks: O–CO (288.8 eV), CO (286.1 eV), C–C/CC (284.5 eV) and C–O (285.3 eV). The P species exist mainly in the form of P–O (133.8 eV, Fig. S10b†), which probably result from the residual decomposition products of sodium hypophosphite. With this information in mind, it can be concluded that the P element is not doped in the graphene sheets, which is also further confirmed by the following electrochemical performance.

To obtain more information about the structure and morphology of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids, the hybrids were further characterized by TEM. From Fig. 4a, it can be clearly seen that there are no obvious nanoparticles or rods on the surface of graphene sheets. The magnified TEM image (Fig. 4b) shows that many nanodots with an average size of about 2.5 nm are uniformly distributed on the FG surface, and the size of Fe2P nanodots on the surface of graphene sheets ranges from 1 to 4 nm, which mainly concentrates around 2.5 nm (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image reveals that the interplanar spacing of 0.20 and 0.22 nm can also be observed in Fig. 4d, which corresponds to the (201) and (111) planes of Fe2P, respectively. This also further confirms the formation of the crystallized Fe2P nanodots. In the case of the Fe2P/G, the rod and nanoparticle-shaped Fe2P is distributed on graphene sheets (Fig. S11a–c†), and the size is smaller than that of the pure Fe2P rods (Fig. S11d–f†) with diameter ranging from 100 to 500 nm and a length of 1 μm (or larger). That is to say, of the as-made samples, the size distributions of Fe2P are as follows: Fe2P > Fe2P/G > Fe2P-ND/FG. This also further implies that the FG has a positive effect on the synthesis of Fe2P nanodots in the present system. The functional groups on the FG surface act as nucleation centers for Fe2O3 nanoparticles during the thermal decomposition process and the loose porous structure of FG further helps to prevent the Fe2P from aggregating. These combined factors are favorable for uniform and small-sized Fe2P nanodots decorated on the graphene sheets in the following step. As discussed above, the average size of Fe2P nanodots in the Fe2P-ND/FG is smaller than 3 nm. With this information in mind, a model crystal structure of Fe2P is used and shown in Fig. 5c and d. When the size of Fe2P nanoparticles is reduced to 3 nm or less, such crystal nanodots are composed of just a few unit cells (Fig. 5). Compared with the bulk Fe2P, these nanodots will feature more edge sites, which may create more active sites to promote the HER process.

3.2 Electrochemical performance of the as-made samples
The electrochemical HER activity of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrids was evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode system (for more details please refer to the Experimental section) and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 6a. For comparison, the electrocatalytic activities of Pt/C (20 wt% Pt), Fe2P/G, Fe2P, and FG-P as HER catalysts were also tested and are shown in Fig. 6a. It is also noted that the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG can deliver current densities of 2, 10, and 20 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 44, 91, and 117 mV, respectively, being comparable to the other non-noble electrocatalysts, including some transition-metal dichalcogenides, carbides, nitrides, selenides, phosphides, and their derivatives in the literature (ESI Table S1†), although these values are higher than those of Pt/C (16 mV@2 mA cm−2, 36 mV@10 mA cm−2, and 52 mV@20 mA cm−2). In the case of FG-P and Fe2P/G, the FG-P exhibits negligible catalytic activity for the HER, while the as-made Fe2P/G needs relatively high overpotentials of 116, 194 and 233 mV to achieve current densities of 2, 10 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. Nevertheless, they are superior to those of pure Fe2P (140 mV@2 mA cm−2 and 298 mV@10 mA cm−2). The catalytic kinetics of the samples were evaluated by Tafel plots plotted according to the Tafel equation: η = a + blogj (b is the Tafel slope and j represents the current density). As shown in Fig. 6b, the Tafel slope of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG is 47 mV dec−1, being smaller than that of Fe2P/G (105 mV dec−1) and pure Fe2P (113 mV dec−1), although bigger than that of Pt/C (30 mV dec−1). This demonstrates that among these samples adopted, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG can deliver fast kinetics. The reason for this can be ascribed to the open and porous structure derived from the FG and the ultrasmall features of Fe2P nanodots. It is also noted that the Tafel slopes of the as-made hybrids change in the range of 40 to 120 mV dec−1, following the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the rate-determining step is the electrochemical desorption process.12,38 The exchange current densities (j0) were also evaluated by extrapolating the Tafel plots, and the Fe2P-ND/FG delivers a higher j0 (2.6 × 10−4 A cm−2) than that of Fe2P/G (1.4 × 10−4 A cm−2) and Fe2P (1.1 × 10−4 A cm−2), implying that the Fe2P-ND/FG possesses the best electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the normalized j0 by the BET specific area is also obtained and shown in Table S2.†40 It can be noted that the Fe2P-ND/FG and Fe2P/G have a similar normalized j0, being lower than that of pure Fe2P. The reason for this case may be that the surface area derived from the pore is still not fully utilized in the present work. To optimize the structure of the as-made materials and further relate the pore structure with j0, much work needs to be carried out in the future.

Furthermore, electrochemical impedance of the as-made samples was also carried out, and the corresponding EIS Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. S12a.† It is noted that two time constants can be observed for the as-made Fe2P, Fe2P/G and Fe2P-ND/FG, which is in agreement with that reported in the literature.16 The first one in the high-frequency region is associated with the porous properties of the electrode surface; another one in the low frequency region is related to the overpotentials, which reflects the charge transfer properties. Moreover, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) for EIS generally exhibits a close relationship with the electrochemical performance.16 According to the fitted results by the equivalent electrical circuit (Fig. S12b†), it can be clearly seen that the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG delivers a much lower Rct (60.6 Ω) than that of Fe2P/G (189.4 Ω) and pure Fe2P (352.7 Ω), indicative of the highly electrochemical conductivity and activity of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG. In addition, the HER catalytic performance of the Fe2P-ND/FG was also evaluated under alkaline (1 M KOH) and neutral conditions (1 M PBS). It can be clearly seen from Fig. S13† that the Fe2P-ND/FG needs overpotentials of 168 and 349 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS, corresponding to the Tafel slopes of 74 and 113 mV dec−1, respectively. In general, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG has the catalytic activity for the HER at all pH values and exhibits the best performance under acidic conditions.
The electrochemical stabilities of the as-made electrocatalysts for the HER are also one of the essential factors that need to be considered for practical application. To assess the electrochemical cycling stability of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG, the polarization curves of the Fe2P-ND/FG at the first time and after 4000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 from +0.28 to −0.22 V were measured, and the detailed results are shown in Fig. 6c. It can be noted that the current density remains unchangeable after 4000 cycles, indicative of high electrochemical stability and being stably cycled for water electrolysis powered by intermittent renewable energy sources (solar, wind, etc.).60 In order to further confirm its excellent stability, the plot of current density vs. time for the Fe2P-ND/FG was also measured at a constant overpotential of 150 mV without iR compensation, of which the detailed results are shown in Fig. 6d. It can be clearly seen that the current density is only a slight decrease at the first two hours, then levels off, and maintains 91.2% of its initial current density for at least 12 h (blue line in Fig. 6d). That is to say, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG as a highly stable electrocatalyst can operate long-term in acidic medium. The Fe2P-ND/FG after a long-term stability test was further characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM techniques, the detailed results of which are shown in Fig. S14.† The corresponding XRD pattern (Fig. S14a†) of the Fe2P-ND/FG after the long-term stability test shows a wide peak at 26°, corresponding to the (002) reflection of the FG, and relatively broad and weak diffraction peaks of Fe2P, which is similar to that of the original Fe2P-ND/FG. The TEM images (Fig. S14b and c†) demonstrate that the Fe2P-ND/FG still retains the structure of the nanodots after the long-term test. The further high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe, P, and C are shown in Fig. S14d–f.† For the Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. S14d†), the two strong peaks can be observed at 720.0 and 707.1 eV, which correspond to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 in Fe2P, respectively. The P 2p region (Fig. S14e†) reveals the presence of Fe2P (P 2p3/2, 129.8 eV) and surface phosphate species (PO43−, 133.7 eV).29 In the case of the C 1s spectrum (Fig. S14f†), it can be divided and fitted into four peaks: O–CO (288.8 eV), CO (286.1 eV), C–C/CC (284.5 eV) and C–O (285.3 eV).51 On this basis it can be easily concluded that the morphology and crystalline phase of the Fe2P-ND/FG remain almost unchanged after the long-term test, indicative of the high stability of the as-made materials as water splitting electrocatalysts.
To have an insight into the reaction mechanism, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the as-made samples was evaluated by electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl). As shown in Fig. 7, the Fe2P-ND/FG delivers an average Cdl of 15.22 mF cm−2, which is 2.98 times higher than that of Fe2P/G (5.11 mF cm−2, Fig. S15a and b†) and 5.88 times higher than that of pure Fe2P (2.59 mF cm−2, Fig. S15c and d†). Correspondingly, the high ECSA of the Fe2P-ND/FG would be attributed to the enhanced ion exchange capacity between the electrolyte ions and the electrochemically accessible active sites.61 These combined results demonstrate that the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG hybrid delivers high electrochemical activity, excellent cycling stability and high operational stability in long-term water electrolysis. The superior electrochemical performance of the Fe2P-ND/FG is attributed to the unique electronic properties and ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots, which is also confirmed by the XPS and TEM results mentioned above. It was also pointed out that the transition-metal phosphides, including Ni2P,21 Ni5P4,62 CoP,38 and Fe2P,29 have a similar catalytic mechanism to hydrogenase owing to the electronic and structural analogies. In our present work, the Fe and P atoms in the Fe2P-ND/FG share the similarly charged nature, and serve as the hydride acceptor and proton acceptor, respectively, to promote the electrocatalytic process. The P atoms may also have positive effects on the formation of Fe-hydride for the subsequent hydrogen evolution via electrochemical desorption.21,29,62,63 Furthermore, the Fe2P-ND/FG with the ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots provides fully exposed active sites for the HER, and the outstanding conductivity of FG facilitates fast electron transport. Benefiting from these combined characteristics, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG delivers the best HER catalytic activity in comparison to the pure Fe2P and Fe2P/G.
 Fig. 7  Electrochemical double-layer capacitance measurements to estimate the effective surface area: (a) cyclic voltammograms of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG in a faradaic potential range from 0.2 to 0.3 V vs. RHE at different scan rates; (b) the anodic (black line) and cathodic (red line) charging currents measured at 0.25 V vs. RHE, plotted against the scan rates. The double-layer capacitance determined from this system is taken by the average of the absolute value of anodic and cathodic slopes of the linear fits. 
Turnover frequency (TOF), the number of hydrogen molecules generated in each active site per second, is an important parameter to evaluate the intrinsic activities of different catalysts.60 Theoretically, the phosphorus atoms in TMP initiate the HER as a proton acceptor, meanwhile, weaken the bond strength between metal atoms and adsorbed hydrogen, which is known as the “ensemble effect”. Synergistically, the metal atoms in TMP promote the formation of the H–H bond as the hydride acceptor to complete the HER.21,35 Nevertheless, the exact catalytic mechanism of TMP for the HER is still unclear. In this case, the active sites derived from ECSA were used and both Fe and P atoms in the Fe2P-ND/FG were involved in the reaction, which is also an acceptable and widely used method in the literature (for more details on the calculation of TOF values, please refer to the ESI†).60 Fig. S17† shows the corresponding TOF values of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG, Fe2P/G, and Fe2P plotted against the applied potentials. It can be seen that the TOF values of the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG are 0.09 and 0.34 H2 s−1 at overpotentials of 100 and 150 mV, respectively, which are comparable and/or superior to Ni2P (0.05 H2 s−1@100 mV and 0.36 H2 s−1@200 mV),21 CoP (0.046 H2 s−1@100 mV),26 and MoP (0.024 H2 s−1@100 mV and 0.19 H2 s−1@150 mV)60 in the literature.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we report a novel strategy to configure integrated active site-enriched Fe2P-ND/FG architectures composed of Fe2P nanodots with a diameter of ∼2.5 nm uniformly assembled on porous and fluffy graphene sheets and reveal their potential as highly efficient and stable catalysts for the HER. The relatively loose and porous architectures of Fe2P-ND/FG are more easily accessible to the electrolyte ions and facilitate fast mass transfer during the electrochemical process. The small-sized Fe2P nanodots contribute to the highly exposed active sites for high electrocatalytic activity, while the graphene within the Fe2P-ND/FG matrix provides interconnected and conductive networks for fast electron transfer. Benefitting from these combined characteristics, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG exhibits outstanding HER catalytic performance, where overpotentials of only 44 and 91 mV are needed to achieve the current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, and a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec−1 is delivered. Furthermore, the as-made Fe2P-ND/FG made of graphene sheets and Fe2P nanodots also demonstrates high cycling stability and durability for the HER in acidic medium. The present strategy provides an efficient approach for configuring electrode materials with highly exposed active sites for high-efficiency energy storage/conversion devices.
