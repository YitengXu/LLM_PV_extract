According to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the diffusion coefficient of the ZnO NW array by a CFI process is higher than that of ZnO NWs using a multi-batch process. In addition, the electron transit time was found to depend on the thickness of the ZnO NW array. To effectively improve the conversion efficiency of ZnO NW dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a high diffusion coefficient of the ZnO NW array with 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1 was synthesized by an ammonia-assisted CFI process. In addition, ZnO NPs were covered along the ZnO NW array as a ZnO NW/NP photoanode to provide a high dye adsorption area for increasing electron injection flux. In this study, the growth period of ZnO NPs playing a crucial role in the electron transport of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode was demonstrated. A high-efficiency DSSC of 6.8% is achieved using a N719-sensitized ZnO NW/NP photoanode with 25 μm.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the most promising devices for low-cost solar-to-electricity energy conversion. Over the past few decades, various methods have been used to assemble DSSCs.1–12 Among the most important influencing factors on DSSCs is the photoanode material, which plays an important role in dye adsorption, electron injection, transportation, and collection, and therefore, exhibits a significant influence on photocurrent, photovoltage, and power conversion efficiency. The material choice of photoanodes, semiconducting metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, have attracted increasing interest in recent years because of their application, among others, in low-cost photovoltaics. Although TiO2-based DSSCs are more commonly used, and their power conversion efficiency has reached as high as 12%,1 ZnO-based DSSCs have some advantages over TiO2 in solar cell applications because ZnO-based DSSCs appear to overcome some of the technological drawbacks of TiO2 DSSCs, such as the high temperatures necessary to prepare titania nanoparticle films. To better understand the physical origin of ZnO-based DSSCs, it is worth examining the wide band gap of ZnO (3.37 eV at room temperature), its good electron conductivity,13–15 and the possibility of obtaining both crystalline ZnO and other various nanostructured forms.8,9,16–20 Furthermore, ZnO-based photoanodes with high roughness, essential for an optimal dye adsorption, can be prepared by conventional sol–gel methods,13 solution growth techniques7,21 and electrodeposition.22–24 These techniques produce well-crystallized layers at low temperatures (below 100 °C) and are suitable for a large variety of fragile substrates.25–27
Tremendous effort has recently been devoted to the design of the chemical compositions, structures, and morphologies of ZnO-based photoanodes.13 Different material structures, including zero dimensional (0D) nanoparticles,5,6,28 quasi-one dimensional (quasi-1D)/one dimensional (1D) nanostructures,7,8,29 and hierarchical nanoarchitectures,16–18,30 have been developed. DSSCs based on mesoporous ZnO sensitized with common ruthenium-based dyes have reached efficiencies of 3–7% under 1 sun illumination depending on the preparation conditions and the electrolyte composition.5,17,20 Although thickening the mesoporous film can increase its optical density, the electron transport resistance also increases if the thickness exceeds the effective diffusion length through the mesoporous network. One promising solution is to increase the electron diffusion length by replacing the mesoporous film with an array of oriented 1D arrays. For the architectural design concept, vertically aligned ZnO-based nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods, and nanotubes, can provide a good conducting path toward the external contact so that the electron collection in the photoanodes can be enhanced.31,32 Improvements in electron transit time, lifetime, and diffusion length in nanoparticulate films have been reported.7,14,15,33 However, compared to nanoparticulate DSSCs, the use of NW arrays may result in significant losses of surface areas when supporting the sensitiers.
To solve the problem of low sensitizer adsorption in ZnO-based 1D photoanodes, many strategies were proposed. Yang et al. proposed that a high aspect ratio of NWs can provide a large surface area for dye loading. Therefore, they boosted the aspect ratio above 125 by using polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polyelectrolyte, to hinder the lateral growth of the NWs, but maintain a relatively high NW density.7 The longest ZnO NW array can achieve 20–25 μm. Another strategy was proposed to increase the photocurrent by combining NWs with nanoparticles or with hierarchical structures, which increase the surface area when providing a direct conducting path toward the collection electrodes.17,18
These two strategies can both effectively provide sensitizer adsorption areas to improve the performance of DSSCs. However, the conversion efficiencies of long ZnO NW array DSSCs are lower than that of hierarchical-structured DSSCs. In general, the sensitizer adsorption amount being increased by using a long ZnO NWs array can be observed. However, the length of ZnO NWs can affect the electron transport properties. According to the definition of collection efficiency (ηCC) is shown to be: (1)where τd is the electron transit time, and τn is the electron recombination lifetime. To achieve high performance with a long ZnO NWs array photoanode, the transport properties must be improved simultaneously; otherwise, the collection efficiency is influenced.
In this paper, a continuous flow injection (CFI) process to prepare long ZnO-NWs arrays as photoanodes is proposed. Compared to the long ZnO NWs array fabricated by the conventional multi-batch process, the ZnO NWs array fabrication by the CFI process having higher electron transport properties is demonstrated. In addition, the long ZnO NWs array with high transport properties was used as the trunk and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were decorated as hierarchical structural DSSC to increases the dye adsorption amount without sacrificing the electron collection. In this photoanode design concept, the conversion efficiency of N719-sensitized ZnO NW/NP DSSC achieved 6.8%.
Experimental
Preparation of ZnO NW array photoanode by multi-batch process, continuous flow injection (CFI) process and NH3-assisted CFI process
In this study, ZnO NWs array has been synthesized by using two different methods. (1) Multi-batch process: ZnO NWs array was synthesized on the seed coated indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. The seeds on ITO glass substrate were conducted by drop-coating method in a 0.5 mM ethanol solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Zn(OAc)2·2H2O, 99.5%, Merck). Multiple drop-coatings were needed for a dense seed layer on ITO glass substrate. The dense seed layer was annealed at 500 °C in air for 60 min to form ZnO nanocrystalline layer. ZnO NWs array was grown using a hydrothermal method in a 0.02 M aqueous solution of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMTA, ACROS) at 90 °C for 4 h. Because nanowire growth slowed after this period, the substrate was repeatedly introduced to the fresh solution to obtain long ZnO NWs array (total reaction time of up to 24 h). The resulting ZnO NWs array was rinsed with DI-water to remove any residual organics. (2) Continuous flow injection (CFI) process: the seeds were prepared by the same as multi-batch process. For growth, 0.02 M aqueous solutions of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and HMTA were prepared separately at room temperature. The peristaltic pumps were used to carry each of the room temperature aqueous precursors into the mixer, and the mixed solution was subsequently added into the reactor through 3 mm ID MASTERFLEX silicone tubing (Platinum). The pumping flow rates were controlled under 2.0 mL min−1. The substrate faced downward in the reactor and the CFI process was maintained for 24 h. The resulting ZnO NWs array were rinsed with DI-water to remove any residual organics. The CFI process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.

Preparation of ZnO NW/NP photoanode by combining NH3-assisted CFI process and base-free chemical bath deposition (CBD)
For ZnO NW/NP photoanode, the decoration of ZnO NPs was synthesized using a base-free chemical bath deposition (CBD). The ZnO NWs array was immersed in a 100 mL of 0.15 M methanolic solution of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O at 60 °C for 8–20 h. The ZnO NW/NP photoanode was rinsed by methanol and dried at room temperature. After drying, the ZnO NW/NP photoanode was further annealed in air at 200 °C. All of growth conditions are listed in Table 1.

Assembly of ZnO NW arrays DSSCs
ZnO NWs array and ZnO NW/NP dye-sensitized solar cells were prepared by adsorbing cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bistetrabutylammonium (N719) onto the nanowire surfaces. The photoanodes were annealed to 200 °C before immersing them in 0.3 mM N719 ethanolic solution for 45 min at 75 °C. The dye was purchased from Solaronix S.A. and was used without further purification. The counter electrode was an F:SnO2 substrate with a Pt layer deposited by sputtering. The electrodes were separated by a 60 μm polypropylene spacer and pressed together with binder clips. Electrolyte was introduced between the electrodes by capillary forces. For N719 sensitized photoanode, the electrolyte consisted of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN). The active electrode area was typically 0.25 cm2. Before photocurrent density (J)-voltage (V) measurement, masking is required to avoid optical artifacts in the conducting glass used as top electrode, which inflate the photocurrent resulting an overestimating of the conversion efficiencies.
Instrumentation and measurements
The morphologies of the ZnO NW arrays were obtained by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4700, 15 KV). A Micro-Raman (μ-Raman) spectroscope (BWII-UniRam) with a 532 nm diode laser and a micro-photoluminescence (μ-PL) system with a quasi-continuous wave Ne–Cu laser (248 nm, 1–20 Hz) were integrated by Protrustech Corporation Limited. An Andor iDus CCD with 1024 × 128 pixels was used to capture the μ-Raman and μ-PL signal. The photocurrent density (J)-photovoltage (V) characteristics of the cells were measured under AM 1.5G simulation sunlight which was produced by a 150 W Class A Solar Simulator (Model 92250A, Oriel) with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The incident light intensity was calibration by a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (Oriel reference cell, 91550V). A power source meter (Keithley 2400) was used to measure the response of the solar cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra have been measured by using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 302N potentiostat with frequency response analyzer (FRA) module operating in two-electrode configuration. Measurements have been carried under the illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 at the applied bias of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The AC single was used with amplitude of 50 mV and frequency range from 0.5 Hz to 100 kHz. Zview equivalent circuit modeling software was used to fit the data by using built-in extended element (DX type 11-Bisquert #2), which allows for transmission line modeling.
Results and discussion
The quality of the photoanode is an important issue in the performance of the DSSCs because of the condition of the dye adsorption and the abilities of electron transport. In this study, a short-length ZnO NW array with 2.5 μm was used as the photoanode for the reference cell (ZnO NW-I). For comparison, a long ZnO NW array (ZnO NW-II) was synthesized by the multi-batch process for the photoanodes of the DSSCs. In Fig. 2(a), ZnO NW-I was synthesized using the batch process for approximately 4 h. To increase the length of the ZnO NW-II, a multi-batch process was used. The overall process time is 24 h, and the growth solution was refreshed at approximately 4 h. The length of the ZnO NW-II achieved 10 μm, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The photovoltaic and electron transport properties of the ZnO NW-II DSSC were compared to those of the ZnO NW-I DSSC. The photocurrent density (J)-voltage (V) characteristics of the ZnO NW-I and ZnO NW-II are shown in Fig. 3(a). The photovoltaic parameters of the cells are shown in Table 2. For the ZnO NW-I reference cell, the performance is only 0.62% (JSC = 3.72 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.75 V, FF= 0.26). When increasing the length of ZnO NW-II to 10 μm, the conversion efficiency can achieve 1.62% (JSC = 7.29 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, FF = 0.37). The current density increased twice because of increasing dye adsorption areas with long lengths of ZnO NW-II photoanodes.

To understand the influence of length on ZnO NW array photoanodes on DSSCs, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement under 1 sun illumination was applied with a bias of Voc. The electron transport time (τd), electron recombination lifetime (τn), electron diffusion coefficient (Dn), and effective diffusion length (Ln) can be interpreted using the transmission line model.34,35 The parameters of transport properties of cells are listed in Table 2. For the DSSCs, the transport properties can provide useful information to realize the performances of solar cells. Table 2 shows that the electron lifetime decreases when the length of ZnO NWs increases from 2.5 to 10 μm. In this study, a ruthenium dye (N719) was used as a sensitizer to harvest photons and generated photocurrents. Previous studies36–38 demonstrated that the ruthenium dye can detach Zn atoms from the ZnO surface and form Zn2+/dye complexes in the pores of the ZnO-based photoanode. The formation of Zn2+/dye aggregates at the surface of a ZnO-based photoanode fills the pores of the photoanode, thereby resulting in lowered solar cell efficiency.39 To avoid the occurrence of Zn2+/dye aggregation, dye loading must have an optimal duration. In this study, dye adsorption time was fixed at approximately 45 min for all samples. Electron transport analysis showed that the electron transit time of the ZnO NW-I is approximately 40 μs, which is similar to the shortest value reported (approximately 47 μs).40 However, the transit time for the ZnO NW-II increased to 0.57 ms. Both ZnO NW arrays have a similar diffusion coefficients (1.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1), but the transit times depend on the length of the ZnO NW photoanode. The definition of collection efficiency (ηCC = 1 − τd/τn) is related to the electron transport time and lifetime. Here, the lifetimes of the ZnO NW-I and ZnO NW-II are similar, but the transport times are different. Although increasing the length of the photoanode can provide large surface areas for dye molecule adsorption, the collection efficiency is influenced. It is suggested that if the conversion efficiencies of NW based DSSCs can be improved effectively by using increasing thicknesses of the photoanodes, the electron diffusion coefficients of the NWs must increase simultaneously.
A CFI process to synthesize a longer ZnO NW photoanode (ZnO NW-III) is proposed. Additionally, Gao et al. recently researched the preferential growth of long ZnO NWs by adding ammonia into the reactor.21 Ammonia can lower the degree of supersaturation in the reaction system and effectively suppress ZnO homogeneous nucleation. Therefore, ammonia was added into the CFI process to grow the ZnO NWs (ZnO NW-IV). This process is called the NH3-assisted CFI process. Fig. 4(a) and 4(b) show that the aligned ZnO NW-III and ZnO NW-IV were grown on the seeded ITO substrates. The morphologies of both are similar to the ZnO NW grown by the multi-batch process. In this study, both the ZnO NW-III and ZnO NW-IV were employed as photoanodes to fabricate DSSCs. The J–V characteristics of the ZnO-NW synthesized by the CFI process are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters of both cells are shown in Table 2. For comparison, the thicknesses of ZnO NW photoanodes were controlled at approximately 10 μm, which is the same as the ZnO NW-II. Compared to the ZnO NW-II, the conversion efficiencies of the ZnO NW-III and ZnO NW-IV increased by 1.84% and 2.41%, respectively.

To understand the differences of ZnO NWs synthesized by the multi-batch and CFI process, room temperature microphotoluminescence (μ-PL) spectra were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 6(a). For the multi-batch process, the ZnO NW-II exhibited a strong and broad orange-red emission, and the PL intensity ratio of UV emissions to visible emissions was low, which indicated the presence of a high density of defects in the ZnO NW-II. In contrast to the multi-batch process, the visible band emission of ZnO NWs grown by the CFI process (ZnO NW-III and ZnO NW-IV) was suppressed. The PL intensity ratio of the UV emission to the visible emission was higher than that of ZnO NWs grown by the multiple-batch process. The intensity ratio of the UV-visible emissions demonstrated the optical qualities of ZnO NWs. The intensity of the visible band emissions of the ZnO NW-IV grown by the NH3-assisted CFI process was lower than the ZnO NW-III grown by the CFI process.

To fundamentally understand thermal and electrical properties, precise knowledge of the vibrational modes of the crystal, which are related to the mechanical properties, is required. The vibrational properties of the ZnO NWs, analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-Raman), are shown in Fig. 6(b). In Fig. 6(b), no significant differences in E1(TO), A1(TO), 2E2(M), and E2(H) mode frequencies were observed among ZnO NW-II, ZnO NW-III, and ZnO NW-IV. With the E2(H) peak normalized, the integrated intensity of the A1(LO)/E1(LO) mode of the ZnO NW-II prepared by the multi-batch process was higher than that of the ZnO NW-III prepared by the CFI process, as shown in Fig. 6(b). This peak was attributed to a defect-induced band, which was reported to be markedly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry.41,42 For the ZnO NW-IV grown using the NH3-assisted CFI process, the μ-Raman spectrum is different to that of the ZnO NW-II and ZnO NW-III. According to previous reports, the nitrogen doped ZnO revealed distinct additional modes at 275, 510, 582, and 643 cm−1.43,44 These new peaks are attributed to nitrogen local vibrational modes (LVMs).45 The μ-PL and μ-Raman analyses demonstrated that the zinc precursors were maintained at a stable concentration level to continuously supply the growth of ZnO NWs in the CFI process. The ZnO NWs maintained excellent optical and structural qualities because of the stable precursor supply.
To improve the performances of DSSCs when the photoanodes were fabricated by CFI process, electron transport properties were investigated by EIS measurements under 1 sun AM 1.5G simulated sunlight [Fig. S1(a), ESI†]. These parameters are shown in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the electron recombination lifetimes of ZnO NWs synthesized by the multi-batch and CFI processes are similar (approximately 10 ms). However, the transport times are different (ZnO NW-II: 0.57 ms; ZnO NW-III: 0.23 ms; ZnO NW-IV: 0.11 ms). From the definition of collection efficiency (ηCC), the ηCC of DSSCs is shown to be improved for short transport times if the recombination lifetimes are similar. To understand the influence of addition of NH3 on electron transport prperties of ZnO NWs synthesized by batch process, we also added NH3 into batch process to synthesize ZnO NWs as photoanode of solar cell. The morphological images are shown in Fig. S2, ESI† and the photovoltaic and electron transport properties are listed in Table S2, ESI†. From analysis results, we observed that the conversion efficiency and electron diffusion coefficient of ZnO NW DSSCs fabricated by NH3 added batch process were 2.11% and 3.61 × 10−3 cm2 s−1, which are better than that of NW-II. The results indicate that the addition of NH3 into ZnO NW growth process can effectively enhance the electron transport properties for improving the performance of DSSCs in both process.
In addition, the lengths of ZnO NW arrays were fixed to examine the performances and transport properties of DSSCs in this study. The data of transport properties show that ZnO NWs fabricated using the CFI process are more suitable as photoanodes of DSSCs because of the short electron transport time. The optical and structural qualities of the ZnO NWs grown using the CFI process were previously ascertained to be superior to those grown using the multi-batch process. This was because the zinc species rapidly decreased to a low concentration and caused deficiencies in the zinc precursor during the growth of the ZnO NWs by the multi-batch process. In contrast, the zinc species were maintained at a stable concentration level to continuously supply the growth of ZnO NWs in the CFI process. The ZnO NWs fabricated using the CFI process maintained excellent optical and structural qualities for the photoanodes of DSSCs.
The ZnO NW-IV photoanodes fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process have the shortest transport time among the three types of ZnO NW photoanodes. An analysis of μ-PL and μ-Raman showed that the spectra of ZnO NW-IV are different from ZnO NW-II and ZnO NW-III. From previous research, the mobility of the ZnO NW was reported at approximately 1–5 cm2 V−1 s7 Using the Einstein relation D = kBTμ/e, the diffusion coefficient of the ZnO NW is approximately 5 × 10−2 to 5 × 10−1 cm2 s−1. In this study, the electron diffusion coefficient of the ZnO NW-IV fabricated using the NH3-assisted CFI process was 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1. This value is now the highest for a ZnO NW photoanode. In addition, it is demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of the ZnO NW DSSC can be effectively enhanced by increasing the length, if the electron diffusion coefficient can also be improved simultaneously.
Although ZnO NWs photoanodes can provide a fast electron transport path to the collection electrodes, the performance is limited by insufficient surface area for dye adsorption. The previous study suggested that an increase in the surface area of the NW cell to achieve higher dye adsorption may raise the efficiency to a competitive level.7 Various ZnO-based hierarchical structural photoanodes were proposed to fabricate DSSCs, such as nanowire/nanoparticle,40,46 nanowire/nanosheet,17,19 caterpillar like structure,30 nanocatus,47 nanodendrite,40 nanoforest.16 Although the dye adsorption area can effectively increase by using hierarchical structures as photoanodes, the conversion efficiencies of DSSCs are still low. In these hierarchical structures, the NWs can be regarded as the trunk to transport the injection electrons toward the collection electrode, and the decoration structures (nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets) can provide sufficient surfaces for dye absorption. Nevertheless, a significant enhancement of the conversion efficiencies of the hierarchical DSSCs have not been achieved. In these hierarchical structures, there are too many interfaces between the NWs and decoration structures that hinder the electron transport. If the transport properties of NWs could be effectively improved, the recombination occurring in the interfaces could be reduced. In addition, an increase in the NW length increases the series resistance of the cell, and enriches the loss of injected photoelectrons because of increasing electron recombination, resulting in a decrease of both VOC and FF. In this study, a long NW array with a high diffusion coefficient was used as the trunk of the hierarchical photoanode to provide a higher dye adsorption area without sacrificing electron transport efficiency.
Herein, ZnO NW-IV was used as the trunk of the hierarchical photoanode, and ZnO nanoparticles were covered on the surfaces of ZnO NWs through based-free chemical bath deposition (CBD). From the previous report, the based-free CBD can grow ZnO NPs and insulating layered basic zinc acetat (LBZA, Zn(OH)x(CH3COO)y·z·H2O) NPs within the interstices of NWs. The properties of the NPs are affected by the NP growth period and post annealing condition of the photoanode. For the post-annealing condition, the thermal decomposition of LBZA has been reported, in which LBZA is converted into ZnO by the release of the intercalated and adsorbed water at temperatures of approximately 70–90 °C, dehydration decomposition of zinc hydroxide at approximately 120 °C, and a slow decomposition of the acetate group in the temperature range of 130–350 °C.48,49 Therefore, the temperature of post-annealing treatment was set at 200 °C for 30 min in this study. Two periods, 8 h and 20 h for NP growth time, were set in this study. The 45°-tilted view and cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 7(a)–7(d) show the morphology evolution of the ZnO NW/NP photoanodes formed after NP growth periods of 8 h (ZnO NW/NP-I) and 20 h (ZnO NW/NP-II). The enlarging cross-section SEM images were shown in Fig. S3, ESI†. In Fig. 7(a)–7(b), the SEM images of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode obtained after 8 h NP growth shows that the interstices among the ZnO NW arrays are not fully occupied with NPs. The decorated NPs uniformly covered on the surfaces of the ZnO NWs array, which is an NPs-shell.

Structural analyses of the ZnO NW/NP photoanodes were conducted by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Typical cross-sectional TEM images of the ZnO NW/NP-I and ZnO NW/NP-II photoanodes are shown in Fig. 8(a)–8(b). To understand the interfacial regions between the ZnO NW and the decorated ZnO NPs, as shown in Fig. 8(c), the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were used to characterize the relationship. Fig. 8(d)–8(e) are the corresponding SAED patterns of the ZnO NW (square #1) and ZnO NW/NP (square #2). The SAED patterns show that ZnO NPs were epitaxially decorated on the surface of the ZnO NW. In addition, Fig. 8(f) shows the high-resolution (HR) TEM image of the ZnO NW/NP structure at the interfacial region of the NW and NP. It shows that the ZnO NP with a diameter of 15 nm was grown on the surface of the NW, and the lattice fringe of the NP was aligned to the single-crystal NW, indicating an epitaxial relationship between the NW and NP. From this structural analysis, the ZnO NPs decoration providing high dye adsorption areas without sacrificing electron transport efficiency was demonstrated.

The performances of the DSSCs based on the NW/NP photoanodes obtained after 8 h and 20 h NP growth were then measured under AM 1.5G solar simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding photovoltaic characteristics and the EIS analysis of the DSSCs using these NW/NP photoanodes are shown in Fig. 9 and S1(b), ESI†. These parameters are shown in Table 2. The performance of the ZnO NWs DSSC is dramatically improved by the grown ZnO NPs. For 8 h NPs growth (ZnO NW/NP-I), JSC, FF, and η of the ZnO NW/NP DSSC increased to 19.82 mA cm−2, 0.45, and 5.73%, respectively. However, VOC decreased from 0.70 to 0.65 V. From the theoretical analysis, VOC can be expressed as (2)where kBT, e, τn, ϕ0, LHE, ηinj, n0, d and p are thermal energy, elementary charge, recombination lifetime, incident photon flux, light harvesting efficiency, photoelectron injection efficiency, free electron density in the dark, photoanode thickness and porosity. According to Hagfeldt, the electron injection time was in the subpicosecond regime (<300 fs), which is faster than the other transport time constants.50 Additionally, VOC was observed to depend on τn and LHE. In this study, N719 dye was used as the sensitizer for the DSSC. Although the dye adsorption area of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode is higher than that of the ZnO NW photoanode, the dye loading periods of both were the same to avoid the occurrence of Zn2+/dye aggregation. At the same dye adsorption time for the NW and NW/NP photoanodes, the LHE of the NP/NP photoanode is still higher than that of the NW photoanode (see Fig. S4, ESI†), and the dye coverage of the NW/NP is believed to be incomplete because the surface areas of the NW/NP are higher than that of the NW. In addition, abundant electron interfacial recombination has been demonstrated to occur in the Ru complex dye-sensitized ZnO-based DSSC because of the high surface trap density in the ZnO photoanode after such dye adsorption.36,37,39 Therefore, the electron recombination lifetime decreased significantly from 12.11 to 6.20 ms. From this observation and (2), the VOC of ZnO NW/NP-I can be deduced to be lower than that of ZnO NW-IV because of the low electron recombination lifetime. For the electron diffusion coefficient, the value of the ZnO NW/NP-I DSSC is similar as that of the ZnO NW-IV DSSC (1.10 × 10−2 cm2 s−1vs. 1.20 × 10−2 cm2 s−1). It is suggested that by using the ZnO NWs with high diffusion coefficients as the trunk, electron transport properties of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode are effectively improved.

To provide a higher dye adsorption area in the NW/NP photoanode, the NP growth period was extended to 20 h (ZnO NW/NP-II). More NPs were grown within the interstices of the ZnO NW array, and many microspheres were formed above the surface of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode, as shown in Fig. 7(c)–7(d). However, the photovoltaic performance of ZnO NW/NP-II (JSC = 16.51 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, FF = 0.49, and η = 4.81%) is lower than that of ZnO NW/NP-I. The effect of the NP growth period of the NW/NP photoanode on the dye adsorption was also investigated. The amount of dye adsorption was determined by detaching the dye molecules from the surfaces of the NW/NP photoanodes in an 0.1 M aqueous NaOH solution, and measuring the optical absorbance at 525 nm. The amount of dye adsorption can be observed to have decreased when the NPs growth period was extended from 8 to 20 h (ZnO NW/NP-1: 198 nmol cm−2vs. ZnO NW/NP-II: 115 nmol cm−2), indicating that the NPs occupation is too dense in a long NP growth period. In this compact NW/NP photoanode, it is difficult for the dye solution to penetrate the entire NW/NP photoanode for dye adsorption. The schematic diagram for dye adsorption on the surfaces of the NW and NW/NP photoanodes is shown in Fig. 10.

In this study, the N719 dye adsorption period is the same for the NW and NW/NP photoanodes. For the NW photoanode, the porosity of the photanode is higher than that of the NW/NP photoanode. The coverage ratio of the dyes on the surfaces of the ZnO NWs photoanode is higher than that of the ZnO NW/NP. When the NPs were covered on the surfaces of the NW array, the porosity decreased, and the resistance to penetration of the dye solution increased. Herein, we proposed the NPs are covered layer-by-layer on the surfaces of the NW array. For a short NP growth period, the thickness of the NP film is thin. The dyes can be adsorbed on the inner layer near the NW, and the photoelectrons can be injected into the NW trunk easily. When the NP growth period was extended, the thickness of the NP film increased. The adsorption amount of the dye decreases from the outer toward the inner. In this situation, the photoelectron injection resistance increases to reduce the photocurrent density of the DSSC. In addition, the inner NP layer can be regarded as a barrier layer that passivates the surfaces of the NW array, and obtains a long electron recombination lifetime. For comparison, the electron lifetime of the ZnO NW/NP-II is longer than that of ZnO NW/NP-I.
Finally, these examinations were combined to prepare a ZnO NW/NP photoanode with 25 μm. From the photovoltaic characteristic and electron transport properties measurement, the photovoltaic characteristics of the ZnO NW/NP DSSC were JSC = 23.53 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, FF = 0.48 and η = 6.8%, as shown in Fig. 11.

Conclusions
The ZnO NWs synthesized using the NH3-assisted CFI process were suitable as the photoanodes of the DSSCs because of their high crystal quality and high electron transport properties. In addition, adding NH3 to the process effectively increased the electron diffusion coefficient to 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 s−1, which is the highest recorded for the ZnO NW photoanode. To further improve the conversion efficiency of ZnO-based DSSCs, synthesis of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode has been achieved using a simple and low-cost wet chemical route. The ZnO NW array with a high diffusion coefficient on the ITO substrate was formed using a NH3-assisted CFI process for the trunk and growth of the ZnO NPs among the surfaces of ZnO NWs using another base-free chemical bath deposition. Compared to the ZnO NWs array, the ZnO NW/NP, which possesses a considerably enlarged surface area by NPs, grew without sacrificing superior electron transport properties. In addition, the growth period of the ZnO NPs was demonstrated to play a crucial role in the electron transport of the ZnO NW/NP photoanode. A high-efficiency DSSC of 6.8% was achieved using an N719-sensitized ZnO NW/NP photoanode with 25 μm.
