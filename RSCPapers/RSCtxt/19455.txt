1. Introduction
According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), industrial sustainability is defined as the continuous innovation, improvement and use of clean technologies to reduce pollution levels and consumption of resources. In practical terms, industrial sustainability means employing technologies and know-how to use less material and energy, maximizing renewable resources as inputs, minimizing generation of pollutants or harmful waste during product manufacture and use, and producing recyclable or biodegradable products.
The chemical and process industries are well placed to embrace and drive the challenge of industrial sustainability as they enable so many other sectors in the value chain, such as construction, building, transportation and health, to provide high quality products and services. The chemical industry creates materials for multiple consumer markets, which need to be produced, used and recycled by manufacturing processes that are clean, safe and economical. These processes should use the minimum of resources with the ultimate goal of using only renewable and recyclable feedstock.
The global chemical industry represents a significant part of world trade and economic activity with 10 million employees and a combined turnover of some €1300 billion excluding pharmaceuticals, and at €1841 billion including pharmaceuticals, representing 4–5% of world income. It contributes 9% of world trade whilst emitting only 4% of global CO2 emissions.
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development's “Business case for Sustainable Development”1 describes the following business incentives to promote sustainability:
• profitability, fiscal changes
• environmental conscience, legislation and regulations
• concerns from shareholders, employees, customers
• long term business viability related to public perception and image
Profitability is, in itself, a prime driver for sustainability. In 1999, the Consortium Report, a synthesis of ideas resulting from a working group gathering leaders of multinational firms, outlined “the strategies of sustainable development to create value”. Six virtuous effects were noted: anticipation of constraints and risks, costs-reduction in consumption of resources or production of waste, innovation, competitive advantage by differentiation of products put on the market, and improvement of the company image.2
The chemical industry has a strong record of innovation—in products that meet customers' needs, in manufacturing processes that protect the environment and human health, and in solutions that directly address environmental problems. The European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) is committed to Sustainable Development and has implemented a wide range of action programmes, self-monitoring systems and other voluntary initiatives including the Responsible Care Initiative3 and programmes such as Product Stewardship, Education–Industry Partnerships,4 VEEP (Voluntary Energy Efficiency Programme)5 and SUSTECH (Collaborative Research and Development in Sustainable Technologies for the Process Industries).6
This review examines how industry is creating new, more sustainable value by implementing ‘green’ chemistry and engineering concepts, with a focus on, but not limited to, Europe. We will first look at the issues and challenges facing green chemistry and engineering, then review a selection of implemented processes before examining key disciplines that we believe require research support to further progress sustainability in the industry.
2. Issues and challenges of green chemistry and green engineering
For the chemical industry, innovation is its lifeblood ensuring continuous improvement in performance and enabling more sustainable production and use of its products. Innovation is critical: the challenge for business is not only to provide service to our consumer society, but to innovate new ways of doing so with markedly lower reliance on materials, energy, labour and waste. If technology was in the recent past viewed as a cause of environmental degradation, it is now recognized for its key contribution to sustainability by decoupling economic growth from environmental impact7 and for being vital for enabling downstream industries' sustainability.
Most chemical companies now set environmental and societal targets:
DuPont has set four goals for 2010 “as part of its sustainability mission”:
• derive 25% of revenues from non-depletable resources, up from 14% in 2002.
• reduce global carbon-equivalent greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 65%
				(1990 as base year)
• hold energy use flat using 1990 as a base year.
• source 10% of the company's global energy use from renewable resources8,9
For year 2012 compared to 2002, BASF aims to:
• cut 10% of GHG emissions per ton of sales
• cut 40% air pollutants, 30% heavy metal emissions
• have 80% fewer lost-time accidents, 70% fewer transportation accidents
• by 2008, the company will have “all relevant information” on chemicals handled in volumes of more than 1 ton per year.10
The goal of achieving sustainability, including its dimension of clear benefits to society and equity, is socio-political and cannot be achieved by technology alone. Yet there is a global technology challenge, especially in the chemical sector, as sustainability can be attained by the development of environmentally benign processes, integration of material constraints, costs and safety, and further increases in energy and material efficiency in producing goods and services.11 The challenge lies in improving the chemistry, the selection of raw and auxiliary materials and in the smarter design of chemical manufacturing facilities.
The principles of ‘Green Chemistry’12 gave a tangible framework to reduce environmental impact of products. Improving industrial sustainability requires goals not only at the molecular and product levels, but also at the process and system levels. ‘Green engineering’ focuses on how to achieve these goals through technology.13 When designing new materials, products or processes scientists and engineers are provided with a framework, beyond baseline engineering quality and safety specifications, based on 12 principles that consider environmental, economic and social factors:14
• mass and energy in and outputs should be as inherently non-hazardous as possible
• prevention of waste is better than clean up
• minimize energy in separation/purification processes
• maximize mass, energy, volume and time efficiency in product/process
• output-pulled is preferred to input-pushed
• energy is main criterion for choice between recycle, reuse or disposal
• durability must be targeted (no eternal life)
• avoid one-size-fits-all, minimize excess
• minimize material diversity in multicomponent products
• integration & interconnectivity are a way to industrial ecology
• design for performance in a commercial “after-life”
• favour mass and energy inputs from renewable sources
Technical innovation alone will not suffice to ensure that sustainable technology is adopted. Correct framework conditions are required to enable successful investment in green chemistry and engineering. These include:
• Correct market conditions—including incentives to increase research and access to finance for new (and potentially risky) innovation
• Cost-effective regulation—that does not inhibit change through over regulation
• Appreciation by society—a demand for new products and systems that is real
Recent initiatives such as the European Commission's Environmental Technology Action Plan (ETAP)15 indicate a potential improvement in the framework conditions for investment in such technologies going forward.
The following current technical challenges will be used to highlight industry innovations in the next section:
• Renewable resources
• Eco-efficient products
• Energy efficiency and sustainable energy
• Waste reduction and waste reuse
• Reduction of Greenhouse gases and other emissions
• Inherently safer processes
3. Examples of implemented industrial sustainable chemistry
3.1 Renewable resources
Nature produces a formidable 200 billion tons of biomass per year by photosynthesis, only 3–4% is currently used by man for food and non-food sectors. Use of biomass can play an important role in sustainable development and handling global warming issues in two major areas of development:
• biomass for energy uses, directly or indirectly
• biomass as base resource for chemicals, materials and products
More specifically for the chemical industry, we can distinguish three main areas:
1. The use of renewable raw materials replacing fossil fuel feedstocks, where new enzyme and whole cell systems convert biomass into fermentable sugars and then downstream products
2. Bioprocesses replacing traditional chemical processes to make many organic and other chemicals
3. Development of new bioproducts such as chemicals, new plastics, high performance polymers.
With respect to the objective of reduced CO2 emissions, the use of biomass to replace fossil fuel resources is the most important group of technologies. In particular, liquid biofuels for sustainable transport, such as biodiesel (produced from vegetable oil) and bioethanol and its derivative ETBE (produced from plant sugars). Other liquid biofuels, such as biomethanol and its derivative MTBE, have been derived from lignocellulosic material. Biodiesel is a C16–18 fatty acid methyl ester. Some 1.5 M tons per annum (tpa) are produced in Europe. Bioethanol is traditionally produced by the fermentation of simple sugars, from starches of potatoes, corn, wheat and other plants. Other feedstocks such as waste products from the beverage, food and forest industries are also used. Research is also being carried out into producing ethanol from agricultural residues such as rice straw, sugar cane bagasse and corn stover, municipal solid waste and energy crops. Bioethanol is used as an automotive fuel, mixed with gasoline to form a fuel called “gasohol.” In the US, ethanol-blended fuels account for 12% of all automotive fuels.

Oleochemicals derived from natural fats and oils from animal, marine or vegetable sources are used in detergents and cosmetics, additives for plastics, rubber and textiles, in the production of paint and surface coatings and a variety of applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The oleochemical industry already uses mainly renewable raw materials such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil.
In the field of biopolymers in 1997, Cargill and The Dow Chemical Company formed a 50–50 joint venture16 to develop a novel synthesis of polylacticacid (PLA), a polymer formed from corn-derived dextrose. NatureWorks™ PLA is the first synthetic polymer class to be produced from annually renewable resources. It is fully compostable in commercial facilities, or recyclable back to the monomer. The two key technical advances for large-scale low-cost production are the synthesis of lactide and efficient vacuum distillation. The Cargill–Dow process has better than 95% yield, requires 30–50% fewer fossil resources than conventional plastics, and results in a 30–60% reduction in GHG emissions. Cargill–Dow has invested more than $300 million in the venture. The first plant built in Nebraska (USA) has an annual capacity of 140 000 tons.17 Future plants will be able to use various other biomass feedstocks, such as agricultural waste.
Through metabolic engineering an Escherichia coli K12 microorganism produces 1,3-propanediol (PDO), in a simple sugars fermentation process developed by DuPont and GENENCOR. In a pilot plant operated by Tate & Lyle, the PDO yield reaches 135 g l−1 at a rate of 4 g l−1 h−1. PDO is used for the production of PTT (polytrimethylene-terephtalate), a new polymer which is used for the production of high quality fibres branded Sorona.18 Production is predicted to reach 500 ktpa by 2010.
Examples of biopolymers are: xanthane, a polysaccharide obtained by fermentation and used as a viscosifier in food, sauces, paints and even cement; Biopol, a natural-based polyester developed by ICI;19 the copolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/-3-hydroxyvalerate is produced from wheat carbohydrates by fermentation using Alcaligenes eutrophius. Recent developments using modified enzymes at Metabolics are expected to improve both yields and product properties. Researchers have succeeded in manipulating the genetic code of plants and microorganisms in order to produce poly-hydroxybutyric acid.20
Dow Corning and Genencor are collaborating on an ambitious 35 M US$ project to make bio-based organosilicones. This so-called “Silicon Biotechnology” is expected to yield unique biologically mediated organosilicon-based materials for application in diagnostics, biosensors, controlled delivery of active ingredients and personal care products.21
The use of the enzyme ‘nitrile hydratase’ by Mitsubishi Rayon was among the first applications of biotechnology in the chemicals industry making acrylamide.22 The conventional process involved hydration of the nitrile with sulfuric acid and/or the use of copper catalysts.23 The enzymatic transformation in a batch reactor (kept at 5 °C to avoid polymerization) results in >99.99% conversion, selectivity and yield to reach a productivity of ∼2 kg l−1 d−1.
Degussa produces L-threonine, an aminoacid for animal nutrition, in a plant expanding to 30 000 tpa, in Slovakia.24 After researchers genetically engineered a new strain of Escherichia coli bacteria to make it stable, improve its productivity, and reduce sensitivity to fermentation products and conditions, the improved process removes up to 90% of the fermentation broth, leaving the remainder to inoculate the next batch, in a ‘repeated fed-batch procedure’. Due to the higher purity of the broth, only one crystallization step is required to get the pure product.
Many industrial bioprocesses have been developed in the field of pharmaceuticals. For antibiotics such as cephalosporins, DSM began to explore biocatalysis in the early 1980s. Compared to the former chemical route, the bio-coupling of the 7-ADCA synthon results in reduction of total waste by 67%, of organics reagents and solvents by 80%, of steam by 60% and of liquid N2 refrigerant by 100%.25
The traditional multi-step chemical process for the production of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) has been replaced by fermentation at BASF and Hoffman Laroche, resulting in 95% less waste and 40% cost reduction. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is also produced by a biotechnological method.
Biotechnology has improved the production of certain crop protection chemicals, such as glyphosate: DuPont has announced a new process for this broad-spectrum herbicide, by oxidation of glycolic acid using enzymes cloned from spinach and yeast. This greatly reduces the number of steps in the overall process and reduces loss of product to waste streams.26
White biotechnology is especially useful for producing chiral molecules:
• 2000 tpa of 99% pure chloro-2 propionic acid are produced by Avecia using a dehalogenase enzyme27
• Ajinomoto: L-DOPA from catechol, pyruvate and ammonia28
• Degussa: chiral aminoacids in hollow-fibre modules29
21 biotechnology case studies can be found in the 2001 OECD report: “Application of Biotechnology to Industrial Sustainability”.30 Additional cases are given in a review on ‘Biotechnology for Industrial Sustainability’ published in 2001 in South Korea.31
3.2 Eco-efficient products: increased functionality/mass ratio
Knowing which material functionality is desired and the required chemical functionalities to deliver that material property, various tools are available to the skilled scientist to selectively introduce these based on assessment of their sustainability
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an important tool which determines all environmental impacts from ‘cradle to grave’. Historically, most product management approaches have dealt with ‘end-of-pipe’ solutions. Today, more holistic approaches consider the life cycle of a product or device (and any part of the production process), from raw material to the final disposal, including re-use or recycling.32 Life Cycle Inventories (LCI), popularly known as ‘cradle to factory gate’ studies, form part of the complete LCA which also includes a LC-impact assessment. The Ecosol group in Cefic (13 European surfactant producers) used LCI to compare the 7 most important surfactant types. Henkel33 used LCI and LCA to show a clear advantage of oleochemical over petrochemical surfactants.
BASF has been using eco-efficiency since 1996 as a way to deliver the right product at the right time.34 The company compared the ecological footprint of the dyeing process for blue denim35 using indigo powder from plants, biotech-derived indigo granules, synthetic indigo in conventional dyeing or an electrochemical process. The analysis showed the electrochemical process to be clearly favourable in terms of its environmental impact and a new plant was constructed. BASF's share of the jeans dyeing market has since risen from 2 to 40%.
Few pigments are available in the colour range from red to yellow, such as cadmium sulfoselenide, lead molybdate and bismuth vanadate; they have excellent performance characteristics, but their toxicity is environmentally undesirable. Rhodia developed Neolor™, non-toxic inorganic pigments based on cerium sulfides used in automotive coatings, engineering plastics, ceramic coloring and packaging, where high opacity, thermal stability and light-fastness are required.
Many products designed to ecological rules can be cheaper to produce and use, providing higher value for their users. BASF produces a biodegradeable polyester called Ecoflex, a copolymer of 1,4-butanediol, adipic acid and terephtalic acid. It has good thermoplastic properties and forms semitransparent packaging.36 The film is fully compostable. Luviset® polyurethane copolymers were developed by BASF to reduce VOC emissions in the production and use of hair sprays, whilst Neopor® building insulation incorporates infra-red absorbing/scattering components that keep more heat in and reduce energy use.37
For carpet backing applications, The Dow Chemical Company developed Biobalance Polymers, polyurethane polymers that are manufactured with a portion of the polyol coming from a renewable resource, the soybean plant. These carpet backings can also be manufactured with post industrial waste and a non-woven outer surface made from 100% recycled PET. Synalox™ is a polyglycol lubricant38 having cleaner profiles than fossil fuel-based equivalents but is biodegradable whilst maintaining and improving performance characteristics.
DEEDMAC is a fabric softening cationic surfactant developed by Procter & Gamble. Inclusion of two weak ester linkages allows a 99%+ removal in sewage treatment and a much improved ecotoxicology profile.39
Two examples from Rhodia illustrate the usefulness of nanotechnologies for sustainability:
• HDS (Highly Dispersible Silica) is used by Michelin for its “green tyre” which significantly improves performances in term of rolling friction and consequently in the energy consumption of the vehicle, and its adherence to wet road surfaces. Silica, in aggregates of a few nm, replaces the traditional carbon black. The final properties are controlled at the very first stage of synthesis: acid neutralization of sodium silicate. Washed and dried, the silica is produced in various forms: powders, micropearls, granules, to avoid dusting during its handling.40
• Cerium oxide nanoparticules, pure or doped with iron, find a new application in pollution abatement in diesel engines. Perfectly dispersed in the gas oil, the 5 nm cerium oxide particules are trapped in the very heart of the soot particles, which are then oxidized in the exhaust filter. The cerium oxide particules are totally retained in the catalyst bed. The effectiveness of this nano catalyst is such that the addition of <10 ppm in the gas oil allows the complete combustion of soots in a few minutes. 2 litres of EOLYS™ allows the effective depollution of a diesel engine during up to 150000 km.41
3.3 Energy efficiency
General points can be made about process improvement that will lead to improved energy efficiency. Fine control of reaction parameters to obtain better yield and selectivity leads to easier, less energy intensive downstream separation. The introduction of new energy-efficient separation technologies, such as membranes, also helps. Process design to minimise multiple drying steps in a process will also significantly reduce energy consumption.
Polimeri Europa has developed new zeolite-catalyzed ethylbenzene and cumene processes which overcome all the traditional drawbacks of conventional alkylation technologies. Benzene and ethylene or propylene are reacted in a simple fixed-bed alkylator. Di-alkylated products are recovered by transalkylation with benzene to produce additional ethylbenzene or cumene. Due to the very high chemical selectivity in both alkylation and transalkylation reactors, almost stoichiometric yields are reached. Energy consumption has been dramatically lowered compared to both aluminium chloride, phosphoric acid or gas-phase zeolite technologies, mainly due to negligible amounts of impurities in downstream distillation. The non-corrosive nature of the catalyst allows low-cost construction materials. The catalyst is completely regenerable and at the end of its life, after burning, the catalyst is a safely disposable, inert material. A plant is currently under construction.42 Cumene technology has also been moving towards zeolite-based processes and in its Italian plant, Polimeri Europa has experienced seven years of trouble-free continuous operation.43
A new coating concept was developed by BASF jointly with plant builders Dürr Systems and car company Daimler Chrysler for painting the Mercedes A-class model cutting paint consumption by up to 20% and reducing emissions and energy consumption. Developed in only 24 months, the process consists of 3 consecutive “wet on wet” coating applications: an anti-corrosion dipcoat, without heavy metals; a water-based coat; and a solvent-free powder-slurry clearcoat deposited by electrostatics. Only one final drying is necessary.44
Combining operations is an effective method to reduce energy use. Reactive distillation is an early version of a Multifunctional Process: in the late 1970s, Eastman Chemical installed in Kingsport (USA) a tower reactor integrating esterification of methanol with acetic acid and distillation of methyl acetate in one single vessel, with a liquid-phase catalyst.45 Another example is the ‘Texas tea-bag’ developed by CD Tech, for etherification of isobutene and methanol, with solid ion-exchange catalyst beds inserted inside distillation columns. A recent review of Reactive Separations46 gives examples of the incorporation of up to nine functions into one single piece of equipment.
Besides reactive distillation and separations, another active field of function combination is the coupling of membrane technology to a reaction process, to remove a reaction-limiting component. Examples are pervaporation for removal of water in enzymatic esterifications and membrane nano-filtration of a product in fermentation processes. Two developments by TNO are:
• a membrane slurry reactor47 for fine chemical hydrogenations, where very fine and active metal catalyst particles are removed from the slurry phase.
• gas cleaning where bacteria usually do not cope with dry and acidic conditions: filamentous mould is grown on perlite inert material, feeding on aromatic compounds.48
In this important field of membranes, new concepts are appearing, such as the non-porous elastomer membrane (selective one-way flow permeating across the membrane) commercialized by Membrane Extraction Technologies (MET) in the UK.49 MARS (Membrane Aromatic Recovery System) is a novel process for separating toxic organic compounds from point-source waste streams. The first commercial-scale installation of MARS is now underway at Degussa AG's Fine Chemicals Site in Knottingley, UK, where the process is treating several thousand litres per day from one effluent stream, recovering the p-cresol content. This represents a rapid lab-to-plant scale-up for the MARS process, which went from initial proof-of-concept processing 5 litres per day in the lab during 1999, to pilot trials treating 1000 litres per day in 2001, to process scale operation in 2003. Using MARS, effluent streams can be treated not only to remove these toxic chemicals, but to recover them with a quality that allows for their re-use.
3.4 Waste reduction
There is a clear business case for waste reduction as drives for ‘zero’ targets show. For example, by developing new technology for manufacturing a key component of Lycra, DuPont earned an added 4 M$ a year, while cutting 2 ktpa of waste.50
Sumitomo Chemicals and Enichem combined two catalytic technologies for a 70 ktpa caprolactam plant: instead of the classical route with hydroxylamine sulfate, a toxic and corrosive reactant, cyclohexanone is directly ammoximated by NH3
					+ H2O2 over a Ti-MFI type zeolite. For rearrangement of the intermediate oxime to final caprolactam, a catalyst replaces oleum. Co-production of ammonium sulfate, with poor fertilizing properties, causing economic and environmental concerns to manufacturers, is completely eliminated, as well as NOx and SOx gaseous emissions related to hydroxylamine and oleum/sulfuric acid production.51
Süd-Chemie52 in a new route to make metal oxides, instead of nitric acid attack followed by base precipitation, reacts the metal with mild, aqueous carboxylic acid in presence of air, leading to 95% reduction of process water (75 tons less waste discharged per ton product) and zero nitrate disposal. In addition to environmental and costs benefits, customers found better performance from the new oxides as catalysts.
In the electronics sector, silicon chip fabrication plants generate up to 15 000 tons of wastewater in a typical day, and large amounts of alcohol are used as a drying agent. SC Fluids53 has commercialized the SCORR process, where supercritical CO2 is used rather than wet treatment to remove photoresist masks and post-etching residues. SCORR soaks the semiconductor device in CO2 added with 1% propene carbonate; then pressure pulses dislodge the resist, the CO2 being recycled.
3.5 Waste reuse
New material from waste by-products is not a new concept: ‘From waste to value’. The basic idea is to make new material using secondary materials and by-products from another industry. In ‘design-for-environment’ environmental factors are included at the beginning of the product-process design.
An example is the extraction of squalene from olive oil waste streams (rather than from shark livers) developed by Uniqema.54 Squalene is used in formulations for health, personal care and cosmetics. Uniqema also developed a process to recover waste frying oil to produce high grade stearine, used for example in rubber tyres.55
High grade carbon fibres are made by Conoco from low value ‘bottom-of-the-barrel’ pitch, thereby transforming a low-value, low-utility product to a versatile high value material. This carbon fibre business known as Cevolution started in 2002 with a 3 600 tonnes capacity process. Carbon fibres, a light-weight yet strong material, open the door to non-traditional, more durable applications (from car-body panels or ‘smart’ asphalt, to high capacity batteries).56,57
A source for aromatic dyes based on anthracenes and carbazoles is coal tar, a by-product from coke used in metallurgy. An improved static crystallisation eliminates solvents and reduces energy use. A new plant with twice the capacity of the classical extraction process is to be implemented soon at Ruetgers.58
Woodstalk brand fibreboard, shelving and flooring underlay are manufactured by Dow BioProducts Ltd. at its facility in Elie, Manitoba, Canada.59 These alternatives to conventional fibreboard and plywood are made from wheat straw fibre, an annually renewable resource, instead of wood. The wheat-straw fibre used to produce Woodstalk boards would otherwise have been burned after the wheat harvest, adding large quantities of smoke and other products of combustion, such as carbon monoxide into the air. This use of straw residue—conventionally considered a waste product—provides a secondary revenue for farmers in the Winnipeg area.
3.6 Emissions reduction
Increased energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources will continue to reduce the industry's CO2 emissions. However it has been estimated that 40% of the emission of VOC (volatile organic compounds), equivalent to around 15% of global anthropogenic GHGs, originate from organic solvents widely used in the chemical and related industries. Some are also highly flammable or toxic. Efforts have been made to replace them by alternative media, such as water, super-critical solvents, ionic liquids and “neoteric solvents”. The principle of using these alternatives has been demonstrated but still few industrial processes are industrialized.
Supercritical fluids (SCF) are popular in the extraction industry: for example SC CO2 for decaffeination of coffee or dry cleaning processes. In chemicals, a ‘veteran’ process is the Unicarb spray-coating commercialized by Union Carbide in the early 1990's where the majority of traditional solvents are replaced by co-solvent modified SC CO2. The technique is now implemented in the automotive and furniture industry.60
Supercritical fluids have been demonstrated as clean ‘green’ solvents in industrial synthetic chemistry. In 2002, Thomas Swan commissioned a multi-reaction SCF reactor, a commercial-scale continuous facility.61,62 The full scale 1000 tpa plant located in Consett (GB) cost 1.7 M GB£.63 Reactions using SCF are hydrogenations (e.g. of isophorone), Friedel–Crafts alkylations and acylations, hydroformylations and etherifications. Friedel–Crafts reactions in continuous SC CO2 use alcohol instead of chloride, acid resin instead of AlCl3 or HF, and have no other by-product than water.
DuPont built a manufacturing facility in Fayetteville (USA), the first phase of a total investment of 275 M US$ for a tetrafluoroethylene SC polymerization unit. Fluorinated vinyl polymers are non-explosive when mixed with CO264 and can be continuously polymerized in the SC medium.
Non-combustion ‘chemical’ GHG include nitrous oxide (N2O), a main coproduct in nitric acid manufacturing and in stoichiometric oxidation by nitric acid. In adipic acid manufacture about 300 kg N2O is coproduced per ton of final product.65 The industry was alerted to the issue in the early 1990s and different abatement technologies have been industrialized by the major producers of adipic acid: catalytic decomposition of N2O by DuPont,66,67 incineration with N2O acting as an oxidant in a burner by Bayer68 and partial oxidation to NOx, recovered to recycle nitric acid by Rhodia.69 Abatement of N2O emissions throughout the sector has risen from around 38% in 1990 to 81% in 2000. This represents 598 ktpa of N2O not released to the environment; equivalent to 175 M tons of CO2 in terms of GHG emissions.
3.7 Safe processes
Safe use of new technologies is best ensured by a systematic approach to risk assessment and management. Frequently, what makes a product fundamentally useful also makes it hazardous. “Benign-by-design” processes try to use only passive controls, with no human intervention needed.

3.7.1 Benign by design. 
The methyl isocyanate disaster at Bhopal, India, in 1984 drew attention to the necessity to reduce the inventories of dangerous reactive intermediates and to produce them at the closest point to their use. This brings us to the concept of ‘inherent safety’. It is70 a cost-effective methodology seeking to remove hazards in the first instance. This pro-active approach is based on the following principles:
• intensification: reduction in the quantity of hazardous materials
• substitution: use of safer materials
• attenuation: run at safer operating conditions (room T and P, liquid phase)
• effect limitation: change design and operation for less-severe effects
• simplification: avoid multi-product or multi-unit operations
• error tolerance: more robust equipment, fault tolerant processes, etc.
Process minimization, a key inherent safety technique, can lessen the consequences of potential mishaps.71
Many examples of substituting hazardous materials can be found. Avoiding phosgene as raw material, Polimeri Europa (formerly EniChem) has pioneered the development of dimethylcarbonate (DMC) produced by methanol oxycarbonylation, with O2.72 The DMC process was initiated in 1983, accounting today for 70 ktpa worldwide, and a further 50 ktpa production being scheduled to go on stream during 2004. The oxidative carbonylation is a ‘clean’ technology: the catalyst allows high selectivity, resulting in minimization of by-products. Catalyst life is practically endless and there is no need for catalyst disposal. The only co-products are water and CO2, which is efficiently reutilized as a carbon source in CO generation.
As a product, DMC is an eco-friendly substitute to toxic reactants, such as phosgene and chloroformates in carbonylations, or methyl halides or dimethylsulfate in methylations. These reactions are carried out in an excess of DMC itself, allowing easier separation, reduction in energy consumption and lower probability of losses. DMC based reactions require only small amounts of base catalyst, so that salt coproduction is negligible. Only CO2 and methanol are released and recycled. DMC is used in industrial processes from fine chemistry to lubricants and polymers.
The catalytic production of propylene oxide with H2O273 as an alternative to chlorine and water as the sole final by-product is under development in these processes:74
• UHDE and Degussa: fixed bed reactor, licenced to SASOL for 60 ktpa in South Africa
• The Dow Chemical Company and BASF: a 300 ktpa unit to start up in 2007
• A related example by Sumitomo: oxidation with cumylperoxide in Japan
• Nippon Shokubai: 99% selectivity obtained with silicotungstates
• Lyondell: using more sustainably produced H2O2 made in situ from H2 and O2
Polimeri Europa has developed a new metallocenic catalyst based on titanium and magnesium, to replace nickel and aluminium for hydrogenation of SBS rubber. The environmental impact is significantly reduced and nickel is eliminated from the process.75
In industrial bleaching, hydrogen peroxide is replacing chlorine in bleaching of paper, textiles, etc. But the process is still not quite sustainable, as large quantities of clean water are needed. One way to treat the H2O2-containing wastewater is to use enzymatic systems. Catalayses extracted from extremophile microorganisms show promising performance. Attaching these enzymes to polymer beads in packed columns is currently scaled-up to industrial bleaching processes.76


3.7.2 Distributed manufacturing. 
Rather than manufacture a product in one location and then transport it to different customers, it is increasingly common to employ ‘distributed manufacturing’, where smaller volumes are produced at a number of remote sites, thus avoiding transporting of toxic, flammable materials, storage with high safety risks, and distributing the potential environmental impact. A better approach would be to produce ‘on-site on-demand’, in continuous mode followed by immediate consumption of the reagent keeping inventory to a minimum. Interox makes 1 ton per day of peroxysulfuric acid in a 20 cm3 tubular reactor with only 1 second residence time.77 This is delocalised production of Caro's acid, for ‘on-site on-demand’ use without any intermediate storage. Kvaerner78 has developed a modular, point-of-use, skid-mounted generator, delivering phosgene over a wide range of rates. DuPont makes 5 tpa of HCN (useful for pharmaceutical or gold metallurgy) in a system also having the unique feature of using inductive energy to provide the endothermic reaction heat.79


3.7.3 Continuous processes. 
Many industrial processes, particularly in ‘speciality chemicals’, are scaled-up versions of laboratory experiments, due to the constant pressure to improve time-to-market, and are therefore performed in single-stage batch mode frequently far from the technological, economic and ecological optimum. This approach is fast and reliable, but it generates waste up to 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the amount of product.80 A current trend is to switch to continuous processes, which are much easier to control than inherently dynamic batch processes. Quality of product and process safety are also easier to achieve in continuous steady-state systems where each molecule experiences the same heat profile, concentration gradient and mixing characteristics leading to a purer final product with a narrow property distribution.
“The goal is to do everything on a continuous basis”, primarily to minimize inventories of hazardous materials. Phoenix Chemicals81 makes 120 tpa of an active pharmaceutical ingredient in a plant that fits on top of an office desk, the reactor being as small as a tea cup, and much less expensive than batch vessels. Phoenix's concept of VRT ‘variable residence time’ reactors is currently used to produce a hydroxynitrile intermediate for Lipitor.82
Some new technologies are a bridge between batch and continuous processing: Air Products & Chemical83 has commercialized the monolith loop reactor (MLR), especially for gas-transfer limited hydrogenations. The monolithic catalyst developed by Johnson Matthey84 is a honeycomb with parallel channels, a varied number of cells per unit section area (up to 100 cm−2), with 1–5% precious metal bonded to the inner surface of each channel. The catalyst is installed as part of an external loop on a conventional tank reactor; coupled with gas ejectors, improving 100× the gas–liquid mass-transfer rate. For a 10 m3 reactor, the MLR module has a 0.3 m2 footprint and is easy to place and remove. This technology eliminates the use of catalyst slurries, avoids filtration and extensive inter-campaign washing.85
Dow Pharma developed a semicontinuous Swern oxidation process:86,87 an intermediate synthesized in a compact continuous reactor is immediately quenched (by triethylamine) in a batch vessel: the traditional batch cryogenic conditions are no longer needed.


3.7.4 New business models. 
In a search for a safer way to deliver chlorinated solvents, The Dow Chemical Company developed a model that allows customers to continue to use these products and their excellent cleaning efficiency, while simultaneously reducing emissions and providing risk management throughout the life-cycle of the products. In 1992, Dow Deutschland and Recycling Chemie Niederrhein funded a joint-venture to offer chlorinated solvents in a closed-loop delivery system.88 In 1998, Safechem Umwelt Service GmbH89 became a fully owned subsidiary of Dow. The Safe-Tainer system consists of two double-skinned containers, for the safe delivery and return of solvents to and from customers (such as metal cleaning companies). Used solvent is then recycled. Solvent lifetime and efficiency is maximized through specially designed stabilizer packages and solvent maintenance tools. More than simply a set of two containers, the Safe-Tainer system enables reduction of emissions and volume while providing maximum customer support.

4. Key developments for the future
The examples described in the previous section necessarily are incomplete but reflect the wider picture. They also prove that sustainability has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Two major questions emerge: what is the impact of these developments and what are the promising technology areas for the future?
Development and implementation of more sustainable chemical technologies have enabled the industry to decouple economic growth from increased environmental impact. As an example the European Chemical Industry has increased production by over 35% since 1990 but its energy consumption is at roughly the same level as 1990 and its CO2 emissions have reduced. Furthermore the industry has improved the sector's competitiveness with labour productivity increasing by 59% over the period 1992–2002.90
The chemical industry is a diverse and complex sector. Establishing industry wide priorities for research is not easy, however we believe that the following nine research areas can—if properly supported and sponsored—make a significant contribution to improved sustainability of the chemical industry in the next decade:
 1. ‘white’
				(industrial) biotechnologies
 2. process intensification and ‘meso’-technologies
 3. multiscale process design and ‘scale-out’
 4. catalytic processes
 5. green ‘neoteric’ solvents
 6. new activations
 7. new materials
 8. thermo-economics
 9. industrial ecology
4.1 White (industrial) biotechnology
Biobased sustainable industrial chemistry is very high on the international agenda. The OECD publication ‘Biotechnology for Clean Industrial Products and Processes: Towards Industrial Sustainability’
					(1998)91 and many other publications such as the USA Roadmap for Biomass Technologies,92 note that biotechnology is a powerful tool for achieving industrial sustainability, and is gaining ground for the production of commodity chemicals. Much development has already been done on the possible uses of biomass for production of materials:
• direct use of specific materials from plants and trees, for construction materials, paper, textiles, etc.,
• specific products based on specific constituents of crops (oil, fibres etc.) by (chemical) conversion e.g. for specialty chemicals, biodegradable polymers, etc.
• generic conversion of biomass to basic constituents: ‘building blocks’ such as CO, H2, CH4 but also ethanol, acetone etc. through fermentation
• potential for production of high added-value products (pharmaceutical products and agrochemicals)
Industrial biochemistry seems to be more acceptable to the general public than agricultural biotechnologies, and in the long term, the production of chemicals should be increasingly based on biomass as raw material; including non-food resources, restricted residues and wastes.93
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering have essential contributions to make in:
• developing the technologies for conversion of biomass into energy carriers and chemicals
• research on which biomass materials are most suited and where and how arable land and water resources can be developed and exploited
• determining the metrics and indicators for the assessment of the effectiveness of sustainability projects
There are economic challenges for the development of ‘White Biotech’: feedstocks such as vegetable oils and glucose can be expensive, the enzymes used to convert the material require a high investment in research and long development times. It is also clear that speciality chemicals, with lower volumes of production, are likely to see the most profound early impact from biotechnology.
In “Bio-Refineries”, biomass is used for the production of high added-value chemicals, fibres and fine chemicals, together with the production of energy carriers, preferably in liquid phase for higher energy content and easier transportation. Certain technological bottlenecks need to be investigated: a weak point is pyrolysis to obtain “bio-crude-oil/bio-fuels”. Pyrolysis has not been investigated from the Chemical Engineering point of view, nor considered as a part of the holistic production system viz: pyrolysis – stabilisation of the produced oil-refining – use as fuel or raw material. This could be one of the main production routes in a bio-refinery concept.
A parallel approach is the concept of “Bio-Cascade”, using crops in such a way that all constituents of a plant (oils, proteins, fibres, cellulose, secondary metabolites and remaining wastes for energy use) result in a total product mix that offers the highest economic value. Biomass can be used as an energy carrier by gasification and also as a source for base chemicals via the Fischer–Tropsch reaction to ‘bio-oil’, later refined to liquid fuel.
Further biomass utilisation can establish innovative production networks:
• separation of lignin from cellulose for different downstream product lines
• use of solar energy in combination with use of biomass
• insertion of biotechnology in normal processes for certain steps
• advanced generation of hydrogen by biological processes
Ethical considerations imply that real biomass residues—and not food—are used for chemical feedstocks, and almost exclusively for bulk applications. Even spoiled wastes can be converted to intermediates. Choren94 has begun production of ∼30 kg h−1 of synthetic diesel fuel from renewable resources, using the entire biomass of plants, including waste timber: Carbo-V is a three-stage gasification process.95
New processes for commodity chemicals, such as succinic acid and ethylene glycol, are in the pilot stage. Shell has recently invested in enzyme producer Iogen to develop a process making a high octane alcohol by fermentation. DuPont has entered a 6-year alliance with Diversa in a bio-refinery project to produce sugars from corn and biomass (including husks, straws, stovers) and develop fermentation processes to co-produce bioethanol and value-added chemicals (such as 1,3-propanediol).96
Vegetable oils (rapeseed, palm) can be used as energy carriers or for production of chemicals. Comprehensive LCA based on ecological indicators (finite energy resources, global warming etc.) conclude97 that:
• biobased sources have clear advantages over fossil fuel counterparts
• transesterified biofuels are better than pure vegetable oils
• vegetable oils are preferred feedstocks to produce surfactants
Biocatalysis is also increasingly important in polymer science98
4.2 Process intensification and ‘meso-technologies’
The key motivation for industrial process intensification is “doing more with less”. Process Intensification (PI) was first designed as a strategy to reduce the size of chemical plants,99 thus decreasing capital intensity. This concept led ICI, as an early adopter in the late 1970s, to industrialize the Higee technology, a radical rethinking of distillation, operated under a radial gravitational field. The DSM Urea 2000Plus process is a more recent illustration of PI as a “size reducer”: the new plant is only ∼20 m high compared to the previous 50 m.100
PI takes a broader dimension as a method to give full potential to physico-chemical transformation by minimizing diffusional limitations. It is about adapting the process to the chemical reaction, choosing the technology best suited to each step of the process and adapting the size of equipment to the reaction, rather than adapting the physico-chemical transformation to existing and often unsuited apparatus. The goal is to replace large, expensive, inefficient equipment by a smaller, more efficient and less costly plant. It is also to combine multiple operations in fewer apparatus.
PI, by its engineering approach, coupled with development of apparatus, techniques and sensors, leads to dramatic improvements in manufacturing and processing including: decreasing size/production ratio, energy consumption, waste production and using smaller, more compact, safer and better controlled (therefore more economic) installations. “PI is a potentially lucrative way to generate products in a more concise environment that is safer, cleaner and less expensive”.101
The rationalization of the method, the existence of intensified tools of variable sizes allow technologies for ‘sustainable manufacturing’ using eco-efficiency (mass, energy), intrinsic safety (benign-by-design) with improved quality of the product. Good results are anticipated from PI for three reasons:
• in the short run (next 5 years) it is the major lever to improve Process Safety
• in the medium term: it brings (break-through) technological innovation as an answer to societal constraint
• it also enables greater control to improve and guarantee the quality of products, thus differentiating their end-use properties
During the 5th International Conference on “PI for the Chemical Industry”
					(Maastricht 13–15 October 2003),102 papers were presented by industries from a variety of sub-sectors: oil (Norsk Hydro: intensified gas treatment), natural gas (Kvaerner: membranes for sweetening, dehydration), petrochemicals (Sabic and The Dow Chemical Company: energy efficient cracker), intermediates (DSM: urea-melamine process), specialities (TNO: conversion batch mixing to continuous operation), and equipment (Davy Process: gas/liquid ejector for oxidation).
In spite of an innate conservatism often anchored in common sense,103 the industry is developing intensified equipment and processes.104 Like other new concepts, many barriers exist to implementation of PI: incremental debottlenecking and expansion is preferred in slow-growth times, a first-of-a-kind process faces a high investment hurdle, plant managers are naturally conservative, risk averse and ask for full-scale demonstrations of new concepts to reduce risk. PI requires a totally new mindset to traditional batch operations and changes can have a high regulatory cost.105 There is also a technological aspect: the current portfolio of process intensification unit operations is too limited (reaction and heat exchange, reactive separations). We need innovative integrated equipment. Certain aspects, such as pressure drop, plugging of microchannels, fouling of microdevices, are still largely unexplored.
In most synthetic chemistry order is created in molecules at the expense of exothermic bond formation. At the industrial scale, if the removal of the heat is the limiting step, the intrinsic chemical possibilities must be degraded in order to ‘cool down’ the reaction, by dilution in a solvent, by lower concentrations, by slow feed of the reagent, by partial deactivation of catalyst, by voluntary diffusional limitations. Therefore the transformation appears to be ‘slow’. Intensified equipment intends to give full capacity to the intrinsic capacity of the transformation. Some examples of such novel apparatus include: Rotating Packed Bed reactors,106Compact reactor-exchangers,107Spinning-Discs Reactors,108Spinning tube-in-tube reactors,109,110Static mixers,111Intensified static mixers112 and Oscillating baffled reactors.113
A further innovation in process design can be made through microtechnologies and structured devices, an unprecedented opportunity to explore radical innovation for a new generation of high-precision production devices.114 New structured components fabricated at low-cost in various materials (corrosion-resistant metals, plastics, ceramics, and also in convenient, efficient and cheap glass), bring formidable possibilities for intensification for sustainable processes due to very efficient mass and heat transfer and added control of the process, especially in continuous plug flow.
Smaller apparatus is better for mass and energy transfer due to:
• decrease of linear dimensions leading to higher gradients of physical properties, higher driving forces for heat transfer or mass transport
• increase of surface to volume ratio leading to increase of the effective exchange surface (microreactors give surface-to-volume ratios of up to 200000 m2 m−3)
• decrease of volume giving smaller material hold-up and improved safety conditions

Microstructured equipment already exist as laboratory tools: μ-mixers, μ-extractors and μ-contactors, μ-reactors (chemical, electro-, photo-), thermal μ-exchangers, μ-separators are used to acquire basic data in R&D, diagnostics, optimization and process development, where their power to generate information rapidly is recognized. Micromixers are especially well developed, with wide geometric configurations such as caterpillar, impinging jets and interdigital. For production tools, the paradox between macroscopic chemical production and microscopic size of the reactors can be solved by numbering-up. Nature does not scale-up, just more cells are fabricated to produce more compounds. This paradigm remains valid: a production unit could be made by a simple replication of the experiment undertaken in the laboratory on a ‘chip’ or microdevice in thousands of similar devices. CPC developed the Cytos microreactor: six reactors operated in parallel constitute a mini-plant producing 30 tpa of dye pigments at Clariant.115
The advantages of the very homogeneous temperature and concentration fields in microstructures have been demonstrated repeatedly. Strongly exothermic reactions, for example, can be kept under better control, and reactions of explosive mixtures can be safely realized in these inherent safe types of reactors. Degussa116 commissioned DEMIS™ in 2003, for a total project cost of 4.6 M€, with epoxidation of propene using vaporous H2O2, catalyzed by titanium silicalite, as a model reaction. New gas-phase reactions are an attractive alternative to save on solvents. Running the process in microstructures under explosive conditions also increases space-time yield and selectivity. 4 m high, 1.4 m in diameter and weighing 9 tons the exterior measurements hide the world's first pilot-scale microstructured reactor for heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase syntheses. The truly ‘micro’ aspect lies hidden within the safety container, in microstructured installations that are modular in design. Like a plate-type heat exchanger, capacity can be increased by connecting additional modules.
Merck KGaA117 has developed a vitamin H intermediate continuous process (in less than 2 years), replacing a 5 m3 batch reactor operating at −20 °C by a few mini-reactors running in parallel reducing selectivity to by-products from 28 to 7%.
Microreactors can be used for a broad range of reactions, such as gas, liquid, gas–liquid or multiple-phase reactions and even the manufacture of solids using microreactors is under development.
The ‘Super-focus’ micro-mixer developed by IMM118 for hyper-fast organic reactions has a characteristic mixing time of ∼3.5 millisecond. Other applications include precipitation by anti-solvent technique, for example of PLGA microspheres for active delivery.
Microfluidics119 is developing a 0.7 m3 h−1 prototype of MMR (Multiple-stream Mixer-Reactor) where reagents are mixed at a residence time of 1 second with local energy dissipation of 1010 W kg−1, to manufacture nanosuspensions of solid drugs for direct bloodstream injection.
Small-scale is not restricted to microtechnologies and numbering-up. What is needed is an adequate and optimal (not minimal) characteristic length (or characteristic time, or energy dissipation) related to intrinsic kinetic parameters. A millimetre size is often sufficient and economically optimal. Such structured equipment at the right length/time (µm, mm, cm) are called ‘Meso-technologies’.
4.3 Multiscale process design and “scale-out”

Multiscale Process Units are large-scale systems constructed from meso-technologies. Two examples illustrate the concept of ‘scale-out’:
The Segmented Flow Tubular Reactor (SFTR)120 consists of a micro-mixer, then a segmenter in which the reaction mixture is split with an immiscible fluid (kerosene) into liquid droplets in a continuous mode. Each micro-batch droplet circulates through a tubular reactor with identical residence times (quasi plug-flow and no back-mixing). At the end, the micro-droplets are collected in a decantor. A SFTR pilot-plant, operated by Bubbletube,121 proved the robustness and versatility of the process to make inorganic metallic salts with well-controlled particle size and a narrower size distribution.
Axiva developed a 2000 tpa plant making specialty polyacrylates: monomer and initiator are fed to an array of 32 micromixers, then 4 tubular static reactors, then 1 finishing tube. The result is a polymer of improved quality with narrow chain length distribution for Aventis.122

Integrated Multiscale Design sets the stage for a true paradigm shift in the principles of chemical process design: rather than adapting the operating conditions and chemistry to available equipment, the process structure, architecture and equipment are adapted to the physico-chemical transformation. Production units can be created by integration and interconnection of diverse, small-scale locally structured elements into large-scale macro-production units. Many developments of multi-scale technology are expected for chemical manufacturing including: delocalized production for on-site on-demand manufacturing (COCl2, HCN, ClO2); high yield and compact design in organic synthesis; multi-scale polymerization–control of molecular weight distribution; much safer production (e.g. millichannel reactors for nitration); processes with intrinsic safety (e.g. no detonation with pure O2); new activations (e.g. electrochemical and photochemical processes); product homogeneity in liquid formulation (e.g. generation of small droplets in micromixers); and product homogeneity in solid formulation such as multi-scale generation of uniform microparticles.
In Europe, an Industrial R&D Consortium is under construction. The goal of the IMPULSE Project (Integrated Multiscale Process Units with Locally Structured Elements) is to demonstrate the feasibility of production by multiscale assembly in: gas–liquid reaction, exothermal liquid–liquid reaction, non-miscible liquid–liquid reaction, electro-chemical synthesis, photo-activated synthesis, structuring liquid–solid (suspensions), and structuring liquid–liquid (emulsion) reaction.
4.4 Catalytic processes
Catalysis is a central part of industrial chemical synthesis: about 75% of current chemical processes make use of catalysts in four main areas: environmental protection (35%), chemicals (23%), oil processing in refineries (22%) and polymers (20%).123 Efficient homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, biocatalysts, photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, etc. ensure that chemical reactions are high yielding and economical, that they avoid by-products and decrease energy inputs. Key to increasing economical as well as environmental added value, catalysts are the most important tool for sustainability and profitability of chemical production processes, with three global objectives:
• new environmentally safe ‘zero-pollution’ processes
• enabling new raw materials sources (e.g. alkanes and renewables),
• energy conversion, with a focus on hydrogen technology.
There is plenty of scope for improvement and expansion in the use of catalysis in synthesis, with higher yields resulting in less waste and less energy. At the Informex meeting 2004: “The catalysis buzz was unmistakable”.124 Many fine chemicals syntheses are still carried out with classical organic reactions: stoichiometric quantities of salts have often to be separated and discarded. For certain active ingredients for medicines or crop-protection agents, the amount of waste produced can sometimes exceed the target product by a factor of 100. For example, the production process for the pain relief drug Ibuprofen: while non-catalytic processes generate over 30 kg of waste per kg of active ingredient, the catalytic method produces less than 1 kg of waste.
For catalysis, we believe that the challenge is more in improved engineering of numerous existing catalytic systems than in discovery of new catalysts. For new catalytic processes big improvements are expected from the coupling of a catalytic reaction with either another reaction or a separation process. Invention of new catalysts is not a priority: the innovation will come from the engineering aspects.
New catalysts are nevertheless of interest for customised polymers, stereospecificity, self-repairing abilities, reconversion of large molecules to starting materials. One particular field of interest is activation of methane and other C1-feedstock, as natural gas grows as a competitor to oil for feedstock.
4.5 Green solvents
Novel solvents offer possibilities for reduced emissions and other sustainable characteristics.

Supercritical fluids (SCF): SC CO2 has already been mentioned as an implemented technology. Other SCF examples include: SC propane or SC dimethylether developed by Härröd Research125,126 for the hydrogenation of fatty acid esters. The productivity of SC single-phase hydrogenation is typically 100× higher than the traditional gas–liquid technologies.127 A pilot plant using palm and rape-seed oils produces 10 kg h−1 of “top quality” product in a compact unit. SC acetone is proposed for dehydration of fructose to make hydroxymethylfurfural.128 SC water, although highly corrosive due to hydroxyl radicals, is used by Takeda Chem at 374 °C and 224 atm to recycle toluene diisocyanate by hydrolysis of residue.129 SCF are also used in innovative and promising ways to design solid-state morphology of particles.130

Ionic liquids (IL) are organic salts with low melting point (usually <100 °C). As their vapour pressure is extremely low, essentially no solvent is lost by evaporation. Another advantage is the large range of temperature for use, typically extending over 200 to 300 °C. These ‘green’ characteristics have attracted a lot of attention during the last decade, a rediscovery of pioneering industrial work started in the 1970s (Pt/Sn-catalyzed oxo synthesis in chlorostannate salts)131 and in the 1980s with the development of ‘melt catalysts’ at the industrial pilot scale. ‘Melt catalysts’, equivalent to liquid-supported organometallic catalysis, combine the intrinsic advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (inherent high selectivity, easier mass and heat transfers, confidence in reproducibility and heterogeneous catalysis (ease of product–catalyst separation). Application examples include:
Texaco132 converted syngas into acetic acid, esters, alcohols and glycol using a ‘ruthenium melt catalyst’ dispersed in quaternary ammonium or phosphonium ILs, especially bromides.
Rhone-Poulenc used tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (MP 65 °C, thermal stability up to >300 °C, excellent amphiphilic newtonian behaviour) to stabilize zero-valent palladium catalysts for carbonylation of dienes.133 The reaction products are flash-distilled from a concentrated Pd-matrix,134 with the additional advantage of removal of high-boilers by extraction with alkanes.135
Organochloroaluminates are another readily available class of IL. They dissolve nickel complexes and, despite their high moisture-sensitivity, IFP has developed and commercialized an alpha-olefin process by oligomerization of ethene.136
Various salts of alkyl derivatives of imidazole are room-temperature ILs. The BASIL (Biphasic Acid Scavenging utilizing Ionic Liquids) process recently disclosed by BASF uses an imidazole derivative as HCl scavenger.137 The solvent-free process produces an intermediate for its Lucirin® photoinitiator with increased yield and could simplify a broad range of pharmaceutical industry processes.
Some disadvantages of ionic liquids are their high viscosity due to hydrogen bonding, frequent air and moisture sensitivity and some ILs are biocides so cannot be considered as truly ‘green’ solvents.
4.6 New activations
Energy sources such as UV light, microwaves or ultrasound can be used in a controlled way to increase the efficiency of a chemical reaction, thus making it more eco-friendly. However few commercial applications are documented.

Power ultra-sound has dramatic effects at the lower end of the frequency spectrum (20–100 kHz). In liquids, cavitational collapse produces intense heating and extreme pressures, causing high-energy chemistry to occur. Moving sonochemistry to the plant is not easy. However, Accentus (GB) has developed large-scale insonation, for a low-cost ultrasound crystallization technology (C3 Technology), with a much better control of size than jet mixers or conventional stirred tanks. No direct contact of the source with the process fluid reduces wear.138 Undatim uses ultrasound instead of adding chemicals as anti-scaling agent. ‘Sonoxide’ crystallizes CaCO3 in cooling tower water. The ultrasound also generates short-lived oxidizing species, preventing growth of algae. Advanced cleaning oxidants are generated when ‘Sonoperoxone’ irradiates water with 10 ppm ozone and <100 ppm hydrogen peroxide is added.139

Microwave-assisted reactions are known for their short reaction time and often improved selectivity. Reaction engineering aspects, including scale-up, now attract much attention.140 In environmental cleaning, Kobe Steel plans to market within 5 years a process to remove chlorine from PVC by 1.2 kW microwave irradiation. Possibly 100% of organic chlorine can be extracted and recovered in the form of HCl. This technique will be more economic than current technology such as incineration.141

Acoustic waves are an alternative to mechanical milling, Artolith and Krause Maschinenbau developed acoustic milling:142 pressure waves are generated between 2 disks counter-rotating at 30000 rpm with a gap as small as 200 µm. Introduced in the centre of the disks, materials are transformed to nanometric powders with no crushing. The process is more ‘hygienic’ and costs are claimed to be 10 times less.143

Electrons are a ‘green’ alternative to ozone and/or hydrogen peroxide treatment of aqueous effluent. The water treatment industry already uses electrical methods such as oxidation and reduction, electrodialysis and electroflocculation. In electrocatalysis, a recent example is the cleaning of distillery effluents by oxidation on RuO2-coated titanium electrodes.144 Sophisticated techniques such as a fluidized bed with vitreous reticulated carbon cathodes show the best performance.

Electron beams are the subject of extensive R&D, due to the availability of generators at reasonable cost. Waste water disinfection can be realized on thin films, as hydroxyl radicals generated by the electrons destroy the most resistant pollutants.145

In solventless processes, mechano-chemistry or ‘dry chemistry’ uses no volatile solvents. The reagents are mixed in their physical form. An example is a Wittig reaction realized in a totally solvent-free medium and energetized by mechanical shocks between steel beads.146 Reactive extrusion is another technique attracting interest. A way to bring energy into solvent-free processes with solid reagents is microwave irradiation.147 As microwaves directly excite ions and polar molecules, ionic liquids (due to their dielectric properties) are ideal media for microwave irradiation.148
4.7 New materials
Product engineering and emerging product-oriented technologies consistently call for new and smarter materials. Obviously due to competition and IPR considerations there are few products currently in development that are disclosed publically prior to market launch. General trends in development include bioplastics, self-healing polymers, polymer conductors, mass-production of fullerene compounds, organic ferro-magnetic materials, functional polymers and hybrid materials. Innovation in smart materials is expected for emerging market needs in: energy systems, ultra-thin coatings, microelectro- and mechanical systems and for construction (low weight, high strength).
The field of application of polymers is continuously broadening, for example in electronic components, where polymeric printed circuits could replace silicon, giving a definite advantage of easier recycling.
In the detergent industry, AISE (International Association for Soaps and Detergents) enrolled more than 170 companies in a voluntary code of good environmental practices in 1997. AISE is now preparing the HERA project committed to deliver human and environmental risk assessments on household cleaning products.

Materials for energy systems is a particular strong field including: nanocarbons for hydrogen storage, polymers for membranes and high temperature applications. BASF in the area of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for vehicles developed nanocubes for hydrogen storage. A metal–organic framework has demonstrated the ability to absorb and store high hydrogen loading.
Hydrogen-storing metal alloys can carry a maximum of 2.6% of their weight in H2. Liquid organic hydrides (LOH) can serve as a hydrogen storage, transportation and supply system.149 Some LOH can even be directly fed as vapour to the anode of a Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell. The development of efficient proton exchange membrane fuel cells for vehicular use is being undertaken by Daimler, Ford and Ballard Systems.150 The system will deliver vastly reduced emissions compared to current internal combustion technology.

Nanotechnology
					(as shown in section 3.2) is receiving much attention at the moment, but much R&D work on nanoscale material stops at the laboratory scale. Work must continue and expand to macroscale to enable processing and handling in an industrial context. Nanocomposites with multi-functional properties show great potential, but are unlikely to be on the market within one to two decades. The priority lies in the design of materials incorporating full life-cycle considerations. Too much research is spent on bench-scale trial-and-error schemes. Prediction of material properties at one end (knowledge-based) and the manipulation of material structures at industrial level at the other end (industrial data bases and benchmarks) should be promoted and integrated.
4.8 Thermo-economics
“In a world rapidly running out of fossil fuel, the second law of thermodynamics may well turn out to be the central scientific truth of the 21st century”.151Exergy, defined as ‘ordered motion’, is a thermodynamic concept based on entropy that fuses energy and material quality information in a measure that is both descriptive and of physical significance. Exergy could be a suitable concept in the development of a sustainable industry as it clarifies quantification of resource depletion, waste emissions and process losses. It measures the physical value of inputs and outputs, thus relating to economic value. Non-sustainability could be penalized by its amount of exergy.
Due to its flexibility across the breadth of industrial application and its potential as a tool for quantitative assessment, the concept of an exergy quantifier is now being investigated.152 More work is necessary on the practical application and adaptation of exergy analysis to the specific problems embodied by the material and energy flows through industry including: calculation of exergy in an industrial setting, exploring the significance of environmental ground states and establishing the requisite databases for performing analyses. LCEA, Life-Cycle Exergy Analysis, is a superior tool as it solves the problem of classic Life Cycle Analysis when comparing different substances.153
4.9 Industrial ecology
Much of industry currently uses a strictly linear production process: extracting raw materials and fossil energy, processing the material and energy, and returning the waste back into natural systems. Industrial Ecology aims to incorporate the cyclical patterns of ecosystems into designs for industrial production processes that will work in unison with natural systems. The seminal article “Industrial Ecology: An Environmental Agenda for Industry” in 1992154 outlined six principal elements:
• industrial ecosystems: cooperation among various industries whereby the waste of one production process becomes the feedstock for another
• balance industrial input and output constrained by natural systems: safe interface of industry with nature, in terms of location, intensity, and timing, and developing indicators for real-time monitoring
• dematerialization of industrial output: decrease of materials and energy intensity in industrial production
• improvement of the efficiency of industrial processes: re-design production processes and patterns for maximum conservation of resources
• development of renewable energy supplies for industrial production: a world-wide energy system that functions as an integral part of industrial eco-systems
• adoption of new national and international economic development policies

Industrial Eco-Parks are extended, multi-industry networks that try to fulfil these principles. In the Kalundborg Eco-Park in Denmark,155 fluxes of energy, steam, water, refinery gas, sulfur, biomass and liquid fertilizers, fly ash and other waste are exchanged between the Kalundborg City, Asnaes (energy), Gyproc (gypsum), Novo Nordisk (pharma enzymes), Bioteknisk Jordrens (soil cleaning), Statoil (refinery) and a fish farm. It is reported that the 75 M€ initial investment brings ∼15 M€ annual savings156 to the partners.
ValuePark® is the industrial park concept of the Dow Olefinverbund GmbH in Central Germany.157 Its key objective is to promote and attract investment through the establishment of an integrated value-creating network of raw material suppliers, downstream investors (strategic customers) and service providers. ValuePark investors benefit from long-term synergies which arise from using shared services and the existing infrastructure. By integrating the company's strategic partners and customers on site, the ValuePark also contributes to the economic development of the region and supports the value-creation process of the petrochemical business.
Tools for systematic design of industrial ecology networks are still in their infancy but a few are already available: DIME, FaST, DIET and GIS.158

Industrial symbiosis, like any natural ecosystem needs:
• diversity, for an ecology based on waste to resource
• proximity, because transportation costs can quickly offset other advantages
• and most importantly cooperation, which needs improvements in communication and mutual confidence
5. Conclusions
Industry has made great progress in adopting processes and chemistry that have sustainable characteristics: our selection of examples is of necessity limited but we hope reflects the wider picture. Future progress requires technical and political challenges to be addressed. Industrial Biotechnology appears to be a particularly fruitful area for building industrial sustainability and has so far not faced the issues of public acceptance associated with agricultural biotechnology.
Radical improvements can also be achieved by new process design including new reactor configurations, integration of operations both within and between enterprises and through a focus on recycling and reusing materials.
Many barriers exist to limit the implementation of radical improvements to industrial performance: incremental debottlenecking of plant and expansion is preferred in times of slow growth and a ‘first-of-a-kind’ process faces a high investment hurdle. The economic and regulatory environment needs to support investment in new technologies that demonstrate sustainable advantage but carry higher technical risk than conventional operations.
