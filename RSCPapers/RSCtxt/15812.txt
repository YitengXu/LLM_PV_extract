    , Accepted 19th August 2020First published on 29th September 2020AbstractHerein, we report the plasmonic upconversion (UC) emission enhancement of Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ thin films grown on randomly distributed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on glass. The AuNPs were prepared by thermal annealing a gold thin film on a glass substrate at 500 °C for 2 h. Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ thin films were deposited on AuNPs using the pulsed laser deposition technique. The prepared plasmonic films exhibited stronger UC emission intensities in comparison to the reference Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ thin film. This enhancement in UC intensity was assumed to be due to the strong optical field associated with the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and strong light scattering from AuNPs. A theoretical simulation based on a finite element method was performed to understand the nature of the optical field confined in AuNPs present in the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ thin film. This study is believed to be beneficial for several applications such as thin film-based infrared detectors and high efficiency photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Rare earth-based frequency conversion emission is an interesting topic for researchers in the area of display devices, bio-imaging, security ink, photovoltaic devices, etc.1–5 The emission intensity of upconversion (UC) materials depends on various factors such as the shape and size of particles, dopant concentration, defects, and metal nanostructure.6–10 However, it is known that rare earth ion-doped sensitized UC nanoparticles play a crucial role in bioimaging and sensing applications due to the intense emission in a requisite spectral range. However, the smaller absorption and emission cross-section of (Tm3+, Nd3+ and Eu3+) ions and low energy transfer result in a low emission or quantum yield. Consequently, the practical application of devices based on Tm3+, Nd3+ and Eu3+ doping is not possible. Therefore, the Er3+ ion was chosen herein as a dopant because of its larger absorption cross-sectional area than that of other rare earth doping ions. The Yb3+ ion is also co-doped because of its higher energy transfer to Er3+ ions.11–13
The plasmonic enhancement in UC emission intensity has been observed up to several folds, which is greater than that achieved using other strategies. Hence, currently, scientists are focused on emission enhancement using various plasmonic structures. One more advantage of using a plasmonic structure is that it reduces the emission lifetime, which is beneficial for the fabrication of devices. The mechanism and phenomena of plasmonic UC enhancement have been discussed by many researchers using the concept of local surface plasmon waves, change in crystal field, etc.14–19 Metal nanoparticles can be prepared with different geometrical sizes and shapes; consequently, it is possible to tune their absorption band from the visible to near IR region.
The emission enhancement using Au particles and patterns has been studied by many researchers. Saboktakin et al.2 observed a 35-fold plasmonic enhancement in nanophosphors embedded with an Au-fabricated tunable plasmonic nanohole array. Schietinger et al.9 achieved a 3.8-fold emission enhancement in single NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals embedded with Au spheres using confocal microscopy. Yin et al.16 reported the experimental demonstration of plasmon UC emission using an energy transfer rate mechanism in the NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ system. Ono et al.20 proposed the distance-dependent plasmon enhancement of UC nanoparticles (NPs) using tunable spacers.
The preparation of shape- and size-controlled plasmonic particles, e.g. Au NPs, is challenging and requires plenty of patience. A variation in the size and shape of NPs results in huge changes in their emission enhancement factor. Herein, we used an easy method to prepare embossed Au NPs. Phosphor thin films were then deposited via the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique on the fabricated metal NPs on a glass slide. Gd2O3 with high UC efficiency was used as the host. This study elucidated the crucial role of size-dependent plasmonic enhancement.
Randomly distributed AuNPs were fabricated by sputtering an Au thin film on a glass substrate followed by annealing at a moderate temperature. This provides an easy and cost-effective method for the preparation of AuNPs on a large area of the substrate.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of upconversion nanoparticles
The Gd2O3(100 − x − y):Er(x)/Yb(y) UC sample was synthesized through the conventional combustion technique using the following relation:(100 − x − y)·Gd2O3 + x·Er + y·Ybwhere x = 0.3 mol% and y = 2 mol%. Ga2O3 (99.9% Merck India), Er2O3 (99.99% Merck India) and Y2O3 (99.99% Merck India) were used as the starting materials. In a typical synthetic process, all the rare earth materials were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio with a concentrated HNO3 solution. The excess amount of nitrate was removed by stirring at a rate of 500 rpm at 80 °C. Urea was added to the solution with deionized water as the reducing agent, and finally kept at 120 °C for 2 h. A gel-like solution was obtained and was placed inside an electric furnace in an alumina crucible and heated at 800 °C for 4 h (see the ESI,† Fig. S1). The phosphor powder was further accumulated in the form of a pellet for deposition as a thin film using the PLD technique.
2.2. AuNP and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film deposition on silica glass substrate
The scheme for the fabrication of the plasmonic particles and formation of the thin film is presented in Fig. 1(a–d). In this case, three different silica glass slides with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 1.0 cm were selected. Au films of varying thicknesses were deposited on half of the glass slide using a radio frequency (RF) sputtering method. To vary the film thickness, the deposition lasted for 30, 60 and 90 s and the obtained samples were named sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3, respectively. After the deposition of the films on the glass substrates, they were annealed at 500 °C in a furnace for 2 h to obtain hemispherical-shaped Au NPs embossed on the glass surface. Subsequently, a phosphor film was coated via PLD over the prepared Au NPs. To do this, the sintered target of Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ was mounted on a carrousel, rotating uniformly in a programmable manner to avoid the pitting of the target surface during the deposition. The substrates (sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3) were mounted on the substrate holder inside the PLD chamber, as shown in the schematic diagram Fig. 1e.

The distance from the substrate to the target was kept at ∼3 cm. The PLD chamber was initially evacuated to a base pressure of 10−5 mbar using a turbo molecular pump backed by a rotary pump. A high power 2nd harmonic (λ = 532 nm) of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Quanta System) with a pulse duration of ∼8 ns and pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz was focused using a 35 cm focal length lens onto the target surface. The energy fluence of ∼4 J cm−2 at the target surface was maintained throughout the deposition period. The phosphor film was deposited at room temperature under an oxygen environment and at a pressure of 10−1 mbar. Phosphor films with different thicknesses were deposited over the entire silica glass surface (including bare glass area) by varying the deposition time, viz. 5 min, 15 min and 25 min duration, on the surface of sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3, respectively. Thus, the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film-deposited samples were named sample 1G, sample 2G and sample 3G, corresponding to sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3, respectively, for further study convenience.
2.3. Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (1.5405 Å) in the range of 10° ≤ 2θ/° ≤ 70° with a step size of Δ2θ = 0.03°. The topology and thickness of the thin films were recorded via atomic force microscopy (AFM) using an Agilent, Model 5500 series. AFM relies on a mechanical probe for the production of exaggerated images of surfaces up to nanometer resolution. An ultra-tiny tip of <10 nm is used to scan the sample. Cantilever 100–200 μm long force-sensing over the sample yields a three-dimensional image of arbitrary resolution. A photodetector is used to record the scanned images after laser deflection signals by changing to the probe–sample interactions of cantilever. The surface morphology was studied via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Model: Supra-55 from Carl Zeiss. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were monitored in the absorbance mode on a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer. UC spectra were measured on an SP2300 grating spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, USA) using a 980 nm diode laser as an excitation source (laser spot size of focused laser beam was 1.13 mm2). The decay time of the green emitting transition 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 was measured by chopping the CW laser beam at 20 Hz. The decay curves were traced on a digital storage oscilloscope.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis

3.1.1. X-Ray diffraction analysis. 
The XRD pattern of the synthesized Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor sample heat treated at 800 °C for 4 h is shown in Fig. 2. The Gd2O3 lattice shows a polycrystalline monoclinic structure with JCPDS: 01-077-8312. The (hkl) values with different 2θ values are well matched with the standard pattern. Using the XRDA software, the lattice parameter values were calculated using the Lorentzian peak fitting method and the calculated parameters were found to increase from the standard values of a = 14.10, b = 3.56, and c = 8.75 to 14.21, 3.585 and 8.79, respectively. The increase in the lattice parameters is due to the small doping of the Er3+/Yb3+ ions.

3.1.2. Field emission scanning microscopy analysis. 
Field emission scanning microscopy was employed to estimate the size and shape of the prepared implanted AuNPs on the glass surface. The as-prepared Au films were heated at 500 °C with the expectation that implanted hemispherical Au NPs would be formed due to the kinetics. At 500 °C, the surface of the glass plate became soft, and at this temperature the deposited gold film expanded and ruptured. When fast cooling was complete, the ruptured film shrunk and was converted into spherical-shaped particles. The base of the spherical particles implanted on the glass surface due to the diffusion of the gold atoms to the glass medium. The insets of Fig. 3(a–c) show the spherical shape of the AuNPs of sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3, respectively. The size distribution of sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3 is shown in the figure and it was found that the particle size increased from 25 nm to 55 nm with an increase in the Au film thickness from 15 nm to 52 nm.

The thickness of the samples was measured before annealing the gold films using the AFM technique. A good morphology and size distribution were observed in the images, and hence these NPs could be a good candidate to achieve a plasmonic enhancement in the intensity of UC emission. The particle size of sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3 was determined by fitting the distribution with a Gaussian function, and the obtained average particle sizes were found to be 25 nm, 42 nm and 55 nm (Fig. 3a–c), respectively.


3.1.3. Atomic force microscopy analysis of deposited films. 
AFM was used to analyze the topology and thickness of the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films prepared on the AgNPs. Fig. 4(a–c) show the images of the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films deposited for three different durations. The thickness profile of each sample is depicted in Fig. 4(d–f, corresponding to a–c, respectively). The thickness of the UC nano-phosphor film deposited over the AuNPs was found to be 130 nm, 248 nm and 473 nm for sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3, respectively. The surface of the films was rough, which may be attributed to the presence of the AuNPs beneath the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film, and thus a clear image of the surface was not obtained. Consequently, it was complicated to resolve the clear images with a scanned area of 500 nm.

After sketching the deposited film, the thickness of each film was measured by scanning a portion of the film and area without the film (sketched area), simultaneously, using a cultivator probe. The close morphology of the films is shown in the inset of each image with a scale bar. 


3.1.4. Finite element method simulations. 
To understand the optical field distribution around the AuNPs embedded in the UC NP film, a 2D electromagnetic numerical simulation was performed using the Comsol Multiphysics software under normal illumination of p-polarized light fixed at the UC emission wavelength of 548 nm. The refractive index of the glass plate substrate and UC NPs film was set to 1.5 and 1.8, respectively, and the frequency-dependent dielectric constant of AuNPs was adopted from the earlier reported data.7 In the calculation, the AuNPs were considered as a nanosphere dome embedded in the UC NP film. Different diameters of AuNPs (15 nm, 27 nm and 52 nm) were considered in the calculation and the thicknesses of the UC NPs films were taken as 145 nm, 275 nm and 525 nm, respectively. The physical parameters of the AuNPs and film thickness of the UC NPs were obtained from the AFM and FESEM measurements.

3.2. Optical analysis

3.2.1. UV-Vis absorption analysis. 
Prior to the UC measurements, UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured for the implanted AuNPs on the glass surface. Fig. 5 shows the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bands associated with the AuNPs. The absorption band peaks were found to be located at 507 nm, 516 nm and 536 nm, respectively, for the sample having AuNPs sizes of 25, 42 and 55 nm, respectively. As the particle size of the AuNPs increased, the maxima of the LSPR band shifted towards higher wavelengths. The LSPR band overlapped with the strongest emission band of Er3+, as shown in the background of Fig. 5 in grey, and hence it is expected that the AuNPs may create a strong electric field around the Er3+ ions. Based on this effect, it is possible to enhance the UC efficiency of the sample upon irradiation with a 980 nm laser.21

3.2.2. Upconversion enhancement and correlation with simulation results. 
To measure the UC emission spectra, a 980 nm laser beam was illuminated on the sample surface. A comparison of the UC spectra recorded for the AuNPs is shown in Fig. 6(a), which shows four emission bands at 411, 523, 548 and 671 nm, corresponding to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. It is clear that the UC emission intensity was the maximum for sample 3G (highest thickness of the Gd2O3 layer). To determine the enhancement factor, the UC emission was compared between the sample with and without the AuNP phosphor film. A remarkable enhancement in the green (523 and 548 nm) and red (671 nm) emission bands is visible in Fig. 6(b). Almost a 4- and 3-times enhancement in intensity was found for the green and red emission bands in the case of sample 1G, respectively. Further enhancements in the UC intensity were also recorded for sample 2G {6 times (green) and 3 times (red) bands, Fig. 6c} and sample 3G {9 times (green) and 6 times (red) bands, Fig. 6d}. In each case, the green band showed a greater enhancement than the red band. According to the absorbance spectra, it is clear that the LSPR peak is closer to the 523 and 548 nm emission bands of Er3+, and hence the 523 and 548 nm green bands showed a greater enhancement in intensity. The highest enhancement for sample 3G was due to the larger diameter of the AuNPs and thicker layer of the covering phosphor film.
 Fig. 6  Plasmonic UC emission spectral comparison of: (a) sample 1G, 2G and 3G for AuNPs/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film, (b) film with and without AuNPs and having a phosphor film thickness of 130 nm, (c) film with and without AuNPs and having a phosphor film thickness of 248 nm, and (d) film with and without AuNPs and having a phosphor film thickness of 473 nm. The insets show the ln(Iup) vs. ln(P) graphs for the AuNP/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films in each case. The UC emission spectra shown were all acquired at a constant power density of 40 W cm−2. 
Further, the power dependence of the UC emission intensity was measured to determine the effect of plasmonic behaviour on the emission behaviour. The dependence of the emission intensity on the pump power of two different samples, viz. Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film only and AuNP/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film, was studied. The integrated area of the emission band (Iup) and laser power density (P) follows the power law mechanism:22 Iup ∝ Pn(1)where n is the number of absorbed IR photons. Based on the calculation of the ln–ln plot of Iupvs. P, the observed slope (i.e. ‘n’ number of absorbed IR photons) was found to be 1.28 and 1.18 (sample 1) for the green and red bands (inset of Fig. 6b), respectively. Similarly, the ‘n’ values of 1.4 and 1.2 (sample 2) and 1.6 and 1.4 (sample 3) for the green and red color emission bands were found (inset of Fig. 6c and d), respectively.
A slope value of above 1.0 indicates that all the emission bands originate from at least a two-photon absorption process. The slope value was found to increase with the size of the AuNPs and film thickness, i.e. from sample 1 to sample 3, and this increase indicates a decrease in the non-radiative rate. The energy transfer scheme of the Er3+/Yb3+ system including the radiative and non-radiative processes is illustrated in Fig. 7. In this typical process, Yb3+ absorbs IR photons pumped by the 980 nm laser via the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition, and thus acts as a sensitizer. The bands observed at 411, 523, 548 and 671 nm are ascribed to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. The excited Yb3+ ion transfers its energy to Er3+via an energy transfer (ET) channel (2F5/2 → 4I11/2).42 The Er3+ ions also absorb IR photons through ground state absorption (GSA) and reach the 4I11/2 level. The ion in the 4I11/2 level reabsorbs another IR photon by an excited state absorption (ESA) process and gets excited to the next higher state. Following the non-radiatively decay channels,23–25 the Er3+ ion relaxes to lower energy levels, viz. the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 level. The excited state ions decay radiatively to 4I15/2 (such as the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions). The 4S3/2 level also decays non-radiatively to 4F9/2 and the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition gives a red emission. Due to the matching of the green emitting levels of the Er3+ ion and the plasmonic band of the AuNPs, the plasmon band gets excited. The plasmonic waves cause an enhancement in the UC emission intensity.24,26 Due to the surface electrons of the AuNPs, they could also change the local field around the emitting ion, and hence increase the emission intensity.27–29 Both mechanisms are thought to work together. The only difference is that local field of the AuNPs works to enhance all the emission bands in the same proportion. Moreover, the enhanced UC emission is also due to the enhanced excitation field and enhancement of energy transfer.30
 Fig. 7  Simplified energy levels of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions with different energy transfer schemes for the UC emission processes after 980 nm excitation with a laser. The local field enhancement due to LSPR is shown also. 
To distinguish the coupling effect of the radiative decay rate, the decay time of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er3+ ion was measured. A decrease in the decay time from 1360 μs to 1280 μs was recorded for sample 1G (Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film deposited on the AuNPs) (Fig. 8a and b). This decrease in decay time in the presence of the AuNPs indicates a significant increase in the radiative transition rate of the 4S3/2 level at the expense of the non-radiative rate. Because of this, a notable improvement in the UC emission was observed.1–5,31–36 The LSPR induces a decrease in the decay time of the emitting levels of the rare earth ions, which has also been confirmed in previous reports.37–39 The radiative and non-radiative decay rates of the UC nanocrystals were calculated using a model, which explained the decrease in the decay rate in the presence of the metal NPs.39
 Fig. 8  (a and b) Decay time curves of sample 1G. A constant laser power density (40 W cm−2) was used. 
Theoretical simulations were performed to find evidence to support the experimental results. The resulting features due to the local field coupling near the AuNPs and the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films, the relative position and surface effect of the AuNPs were calculated. An increase in the local electric field within the film region could be visualized qualitatively through the simulation based on the finite element method. The commercially available Comsol Multiphysics simulation software was used to perform the 2D simulation under normal illumination of a light source at center wavelengths corresponding to the green and red UC emission bands. The particle size data was taken from the FESEM analysis. The calculated electromagnetic field profile is shown in Fig. 9. It is clear from the images that the AuNPs support a strong localized electromagnetic field surrounding the dielectric region, which acts as an optical nano-antenna to amplify the UC emission intensity from the phosphor film deposited on top of the AuNPs. Fig. 9(a, c and e) show the simulated electric field profile of the glass (as base), Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film and air medium, while Fig. 9(b, d and f) show the simulated electromagnetic field profiles of the glass, AuNP/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film and air (medium) for samples 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The results of the simulation for all three samples are consistent with the experimental data. Thus, the theoretical modelling provides notable information that the distribution of the electric field and UC efficiency are significant parameters to define the UC enhancements. This model also suggests that the absorption band of metal NPs should match with the wavelength of the emission band for intense UC enhancement.40 It was observed that there was a significant increase in the electric field after the incorporation of the AuNPs in the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film. The maximum field was obtained for sample 2, and accordingly, the maximum enhancement was obtained for this sample (Fig. 6). In the case of sample 3, the electric field confinement decreased due to the higher density of the AuNPs. Energy transfer was observed in this case. Thus, the simulation results and UC measurements indicate that the coupling of the LSPR associated with the AuNPs and the UC emission leads to a significant increase in the UC intensity.

To estimate the increase or decrease in the local temperature of the samples in the presence of the AuNPs, the fluorescence integrated intensity ratio (FIR) between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels was calculated for samples 1G, 2G and 3G (AuNP/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film).16 As shown in Fig. 10(a) the largest variations in the FIR were recorded for sample 3G. This indicates that coupling of the AuNPs with the UC film not only enhanced the light emission, but also generated stronger thermal energy. Some of the radiative emission from the Er3+ ion is converted into heat through the plasmonic waves of the AuNPs. As the particle size of the Au increases the plasmonic band shifts near the emitting band of the Er3+ emission. Due to the miss-match of the absorption bands of the AuNPs (sample 1 and 2) with the emission level of Er3+, the major scattered part of radiation is not transferred to the rare earth ions, causing a local heating effect inside the sample. Moreover, since this absorption band nearly matches the emission band, the maximum radiation affects the emitting level, and consequently a low heating effect was observed in the case of sample 3. This result is consistent with the variation in the FIR.

The Seebeck effect was used to measure the precise temperature of the sample by keeping the tip of two different metal wires near the sample.41Fig. 10(b) shows the variation in the local temperature as a function of the laser power density. The largest variation in temperature was recorded for sample 1, which gradually decreased to sample 2 and sample 3 when the laser power density was kept the same. However, the excitation rate in the Yb3+ ions increased the energy transfer rate from Yb3+ to Er3+ due to the mutual effect of plasmonic resonance, and hence the coupling of plasmons and UC nanoparticles increased the decay rate of the higher states of the rare earth ions (Er3+ ions).42
The reproducibility of the AuNPs/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films was investigated by measuring the UC emission in the steady state for sample 1G, sample 2G and sample 3G up to 5 different times (overall 15 measurements). The experimental variations in the measurements for sample 1G were found to be 7.95% and 1.47% with the standard deviation of 12.56 and 6.19 for the green and red bands, respectively. Almost similar standard deviations were also calculated for the other two samples (sample 2G and sample 3G). Thus, the results confirm the acceptable error range for the data acquired from the UC emission spectra (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  Reproducibility of the UC emission spectral measurements for the AuNP/Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films (sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3). All three samples were measured five times, i.e. 15 measurements in total. 

4. Conclusions
The UC emission enhancement of Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ films placed on randomly distributed AuNPs in a multilayer architecture was studied. Initially, a layer of AuNPs on a glass substrate was prepared by thermal annealing an Au thin film at 500 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the samples were prepared by depositing UC nanoparticles using the PLD technique over the AuNPs on the glass substrate. The designed plasmonic structures showed a stronger UC emission intensity in comparison to the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film (reference sample). Four UC emission bands were observed at 411, 523, 548, and 671 nm, corresponding to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. The enhanced UC intensity resulted from the strong optical field associated with LSPR and multiple strong scattering of the AuNPs present in the vicinity of the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ film. A theoretical simulation based on the finite element method (FEM) was performed to understand the nature of the optical field confined in the AuNPs present in the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ thin film. It is believed that this study will be beneficial for designing enhanced film-based solar cell devices.
