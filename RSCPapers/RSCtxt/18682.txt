    , Accepted 7th August 2015First published on 19th August 2015AbstractThe semiconducting p–n junction is a simple device structure with great relevance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The successful integration of low-dimensional materials in electronic circuits has opened the way forward for producing gate-tunable p–n junctions. In that context, we present here an organic (Cu-phthalocyanine)–2D layered material (MoS2) hybrid p–n junction with both gate-tunable diode characteristics and photovoltaic effect. Our proof-of-principle devices show multifunctional properties with diode rectifying factors of up to 104, while under light exposure they exhibit photoresponse with a measured external quantum efficiency of ∼11%. As for their photovoltaic properties, we found open circuit voltages of up to 0.6 V and optical-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 0.7%. The extended catalogue of known organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials offer the prospect for tailoring the properties and the performance of the resulting devices, making organic–2D p–n junctions promising candidates for future technological applications.
Introduction
The p–n junction is one of the basic building blocks in electronics since it has a vast range of applications such as rectifying diodes, optical sensors, light emitters and photovoltaic solar cells.1 P–n junctions are traditionally realized by putting two semiconductors with opposite doping in close contact, which leads to a built-in electric field at the junction. In bulk semiconductors, the charge depletion region is rather wide and fixed by the chemical doping and the band structures of their constituents. The charge density in semiconductors can be altered via electrostatic gating, providing a powerful tool to control material properties and the operation of diverse electronic devices, including p–n junctions.2 However, in typical vertical semiconductor structures the thickness of the materials screens the electrostatic field, which hinders the control with gate voltages and limits the performance of such devices. This limitation can be overcome by using ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) layered materials.3–6 Atomically thin semiconductors do not fully screen the electric field, allowing electrostatic control over both the junction and the first atomic layers of the adjacent material.7–9 P–n junctions based on vertically-stacked 2D layered materials have recently demonstrated gate controllable rectifying characteristics, large photovoltaic effect and electroluminescence.10–15 Despite the emerging interest in combining different 2D materials due to their potential in device engineering,16,17 the studies focused on the combination of atomically thin semiconductors with other functional materials, in particular to produce p–n junctions, are still scarce.7,18–20
Here we present a new heterostructure which links a p-type organic material with an atomically thin n-type inorganic semiconductor in a vertical p–n junction configuration. This platform allows us to exploit the advantages offered by 2D materials together with the excellent optoelectronic properties, flexibility, large area and low-cost production offered by organic materials,21,22 in a gate-controllable configuration. In addition, the integration of 2D layered materials in vertical p–n junction devices provides the fabrication of atomically flat interfaces, a good electrostatic control over the junction, and a great potential for down scalability. As a proof of concept, we employ p-type Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc), a material commonly used in organic photovoltaic cells as an electron-donor material.23–25 This molecule was chosen because of its chemical stability under ambient conditions, its optical properties and its relatively high carrier mobility.26 As an n-type 2D semiconducting material we employ the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, a material which is attracting wide attention for its excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties.6,27–34 Recent developments in large area synthesis35 could also offer a way to produce MoS2 devices at relatively low cost with large area coverage and scalability.
Our CuPc–MoS2 devices exhibit different gate-controlled integrated functionalities, including rectification as well as photoresponse with both photogating and photovoltaic effects under light exposure, demonstrating that organic–2D p–n junction devices are potential candidates to be applied as diode-rectifiers, light sensors and solar cells.
Experimental
Device fabrication
The fabrication steps followed to produce a CuPc–MoS2 vertical p–n junction are summarized in Fig. 1a. Briefly, large MoS2 flakes are placed by a PDMS dry transfer technique36 onto a Si++/SiO2 substrate, then e-beam lithography and Ti (4 nm)/Au (30 nm) metal deposition (and lift-off) are used to define the electrodes. A second e-beam lithography step is used to mask the substrate with PMMA and to open a window, while finally CuPc (30 nm-thick layer) is thermally evaporated to produce the junction. A detailed description of the fabrication of the devices can be found in the Materials and methods section. A sketch of a final device and the electric measurement scheme is shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1c and d show optical images of a bilayered MoS2 flake before and after the device fabrication, respectively. In the same device, the field-effect characteristics of the MoS2 flake can also be measured. CuPc field-effect transistors were fabricated simultaneously on a different part of the wafer to characterize the electrical properties of the organic film without any spurious screening effects. Several CuPc–MoS2 devices were fabricated and characterised using either monolayered or bilayered MoS2 flakes (three of each type). Qualitatively similar electronic and optoelectronic properties were found in all of them. Here we will present data corresponding to three bilayered MoS2-based devices (one sample for each set of data shown in Fig. 2–5, respectively). Representative data regarding monolayered MoS2-based devices can be found in the ESI.†

The work functions of the metals are also depicted. Energy levels for a bilayered MoS2 would slightly change to account for the bandgap reduction from 1.8 to 1.6 eV. A dashed line schematically shows where the Fermi energy level is expected to be at zero gate. Note that the application of a positive (negative) Vg would result in a modification of the EF upwards (downwards) in MoS2 as well as in a change in the available density of states at the HOMO level of CuPc.

Results and discussion
Band structure of the CuPc–MoS2 devices
The approximate band structure of the materials and the work functions of the metals used are depicted in Fig. 1e in the idealized rigid-band approximation. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CuPc is 3.5 eV, whereas its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is located at 5.2 eV (ref. 25). On the other hand, the electron affinity of a monolayered MoS2 is estimated to be 4.2 eV (ref. 37). With a bandgap of 1.8 eV (1.6 eV for a bilayer; ref. 6), its valence band is far below the HOMO level of CuPc. Regarding the electrodes, specific metals were chosen to minimize any eventual Schottky barrier with the semiconducting materials. Ti/Au metal contacts were employed since their work functions, 4.3 eV for Ti and 5.3 eV for Au, lie close to the conduction band of MoS2 and the HOMO level of CuPc, respectively.38,39 Note that, with the fabrication process used, Ti is first deposited on top of the MoS2 flake, whereas the CuPc layer is deposited on top of Au (see ESI section 1† for metal–semiconductor contact characterization). Charge transport will be therefore dominated by the HOMO level of CuPc and the conduction band of the MoS2 layer. Since both materials also have a large bandgap, an efficient charge separation is expected at their junction.
Electronic characterization of the devices
We first explore the electronic characteristics of our devices. The measurements were performed at room temperature, in a vacuum and under dark conditions. Fig. 2a shows, in the same plot, the source–drain current as a function of gate voltage, Ids(Vg) or transfer curve, of a representative CuPc–MoS2 device (red curve), a bilayered MoS2 transistor produced in the same device (blue curve) and a 30 nm-thick CuPc transistor (black curve). Since MoS2 (CuPc) is an n-type (p-type) semiconductor, its electrical conduction is suppressed at large negative (positive) gate voltages, while for positive (negative) gate voltages, the MoS2 (CuPc) layer becomes conductive with observed Ion/Ioff ratios of 105. The electrical transport of the CuPc–MoS2 heterojunction reflects the addition in series of the resistance of each material (ESI section 2†), with a sizeable conductivity for intermediate gate voltages (|Vg| ≤ 30 V) and measured Ion/Ioff ratios approaching 104.
Diode characteristics of the CuPc–MoS2 devices

Fig. 2b shows the transfer curves of the CuPc–MoS2 device at different source–drain voltages. The characteristic shape of the transfer curve is conserved for all Vds, with an asymmetry that arises from the small subthreshold swing (Vg change needed for increasing Ids in one order of magnitude) of the MoS2 layer.27 Similar curves taken in a monolayered MoS2-based p–n junction device can be found in ESI section 3.† In all cases, an efficient gate control over the heterostructure is observed. This is directly related to the use of thin MoS2 flakes (either monolayer or bilayer), which allows the electric field produced by the gate to extend into the CuPc layer.

Fig. 2c shows the source–drain current vs. voltage Ids(Vds) curves at different Vg, demonstrating that the device can also operate as a rectifying diode when a negative bias is applied. Current is suppressed at reverse bias whereas an exponential increase is observed at forward bias, with maximum measured forward-to-reverse current ratios approaching 104, which are suitable values for logic applications. The rectifying capability of the CuPc–MoS2 junction has been further tested in the presence of an applied AC source–drain voltage, showing good in-phase rectification (see the inset of Fig. 2c).
The characteristics of the CuPc–MoS2 diode can be further assessed by fitting the Ids(Vds) curves to the Shockley equation40 with series and shunt resistances41 (see ESI section 4† for more details). This fit allows the determination of the diode ideality factor (n), which provides information about the dynamics of the charge transfer at the p–n interface. The fit is found to be strongly dependent on Vg, with the best ideality factors obtained for Vg values around the maxima of the Ids(Vg) curve. For Vg = −20 V, n ∼ 2.9 is found, a value that increases with increasing Vg (see Table S1 in the ESI†). These values indicate that the current is strongly limited by charge recombination – presumably due to the presence of trap states – rather than diffusion42 (which would otherwise lead to n = 1). Particularly, the increase in the ideality factor when Vg increases correlates with the decrease in conductivity of the CuPc layer (Fig. 2a). Also from the fittings, a series resistance larger than 0.2 TΩ is found in all cases, suggesting that the main limitation in our devices is related to the lateral CuPc channel used. Finally, a shunt resistance of the order of 10–50 GΩ is obtained. We anticipate that the performance of the organic–inorganic devices could be improved by both a more controlled CuPc growth on the MoS2 layer24,43 and by reducing the length of the organic channel.
Photogating effect in the CuPc–MoS2 devices
We now turn our attention to the optoelectronic properties of the CuPc–MoS2 devices. Fig. 3 shows the transfer curve Ids(Vg), both under dark conditions and under illumination with white light (see Materials and methods), for a representative device operating in the forward bias (Vds > 0). Light absorption by the device results in both an increase in the maximum current as well as in a shift (negative in Vg values) of the transfer curve. These observations suggest n-doped photogating of the MoS2 layer11,44 as the dominant effect for the photoresponse measured (see ESI section 5†). The photogating effect, together with the sharp subthreshold swing characteristics of the junction, leads to a considerable generated photocurrent Iph = Il − Id and measured ratios Il/Id exceeding one order of magnitude at the vicinity of activation threshold of MoS2 (see Fig. 3 and ESI section 6†), where Il and Id correspond to the current measured under illumination and under dark conditions, respectively. These features might make these devices suitable for the development of light sensors operating in the forward bias regime, as the charge current collected is very significant.
Our physical picture of the origin of the photogating is the following. Light is mainly absorbed by the 30 nm-thick CuPc layer, which is on top of MoS2, generating electron–hole pairs. The electrons diffuse towards the CuPc–MoS2 junction and lead to a charge transfer from the LUMO level of CuPc to the conduction band of MoS2. Some of the charges may be captured in long-lived trap states in either the interface itself or at defects close to the junction, effectively modifying the doping of the MoS2 layer, which shifts its threshold to negative Vg values. A smaller contribution may arise from the MoS2 layer – smaller since it is effectively buried by the CuPc layer and has limited light absorption due to the reduced thickness45– leading to charge generation under light exposure and hole transfer from the valence band of MoS2 to the HOMO level of CuPc.
Photovoltaic effect in the CuPc–MoS2 devices
Next, we focus on the photovoltaic characteristics of our CuPc–MoS2 p–n devices. Fig. 4 shows the photovoltaic response under light exposure as a function of gate voltage (Fig. 4a and b), wavelength (Fig. 4c and d), and incident optical power (Fig. 4e and f) of a representative device (a dataset corresponding to a monolayered CuPc–MoS2-based device can be found in ESI section 7†). The incident light on the device produces a shift of the Ids(Vds) curves (Fig. 4a, c and e), which leads to a net current at zero Vds (short circuit current, Isc) and to a net voltage for null current (open circuit voltage, Voc). These two characteristic quantities are plotted in Fig. 4b, d and f. Note that the Ids–Vds curves do not show an ideal diode-like behaviour at small Vds (negative) values, with the current being sensitive to the applied driving potential. This behaviour is a manifestation of charge trapping and recombination effects occurring in the device in agreement with previous data reported.
Large Voc and Isc values were detected in the range of Vg values where the diode has better ideality factors (see Fig. 4a and b), which indicates that the photovoltaic effect has its origin at the p–n junction rather than being produced, for instance, by the Schottky barriers or by photothermoelectric effects46,47 near the contacts.
Wavelength dependent measurements were carried out across the visible spectrum (Fig. 4c and d). A large, fairly constant Voc is observed at all wavelengths, whereas the Isc values are correlated to the wavelength absorption spectra of the CuPc layer48 (see ESI section 8†). These observations confirm that the induced photocurrent is mainly generated in the CuPc layer, while the Voc is related to the electronic properties of the CuPc–MoS2 junction. More precisely, the Voc must be limited by the voltage drop between the energy levels involved in the charge transfer at the junction and charge recombination. The estimated energy difference between the HOMO level of CuPc and the conduction band of MoS2 is ΔE ∼ 1.0 eV, which is indeed larger than the Voc values observed.
The effect of the incident optical power on the photovoltaic effect is shown in Fig. 4e and f. We observe a positive linear trend in the Voc with increasing laser optical power Plaser, with a maximum Voc slightly above 0.6 V. Isc increases in the form of a power law with Pβlaser with an exponential factor β ∼ 0.35, reflecting the role of trap charges and recombination in the optical-to-electrical power conversion.49,50 The electrical power generated in our device (Ids·Vds) under illumination at a fixed wavelength (λ = 640 nm) is calculated from the Ids(Vds) curves shown in Fig. 4e and plotted as a function of Vds in Fig. 5a. As expected, the maximum of the electrical power generated, Pel,m, also increases following a power law with Plaser in agreement with the observed Isc dependence. The efficiency of the device is evaluated from the ratio between Pel,m and the incident optical power Popt, which is plotted in Fig. 5b as a function of incident illumination (see Materials and methods for the calculation of Popt from Plaser). The maximum efficiency of ηPV = Pel,m/Popt = 0.7% is obtained at the lowest incident power, and decreases as Popt increases. The low efficiency observed in the low-bias regime and the strong Pel,m dependence on Popt, which is correlated to the Isc(Popt) dependence observed, are attributed to the large series resistance and limited shunt resistance found for our CuPc–MoS2 device.
Alternatively, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) – defined as the ratio of collected electron–hole pairs for incident photons – of the CuPc–MoS2 devices has been evaluated at a large Vds (−6 V) and low incident optical powers, leading to a measured EQE of up to ∼11% for an incident wavelength λ = 640 nm, laser optical power Plaser = 0.3 μW and Vg = −20 V. This suggests that there is large room for further improvement of the photovoltaic effect in heterostructure devices of this kind with reduced trap charges/recombination.
Finally, we can benchmark the performance of our multifunctional organic–2D inorganic hybrid devices against other 2D layered material based p–n junction devices. Our CuPc–MoS2 devices present competitive EQE and photovoltaic effect efficiencies when compared to other multifunctional p–n photodiode devices as the ones based on single or multi-layered TMDs,10–12,15,47,51–53 devices produced by combining a TMD layer with another functional material18,19 or few-layered black phosphorus based devices.53,54 Besides the strong light–matter interactions occurring in atomically thin 2D crystals55 and its potential as a platform for photodetection,56 organic materials are also known for being capable of producing large EQE thanks to their optical properties.57,58 We therefore anticipate larger efficiencies in organic–2D material hybrid devices with reduced trap charges/recombination and with an optimized selection of the organic media among the available catalogue of known materials, making therefore organic–2D material junctions promising candidates for solar cell technology and energy harvesting applications.
Conclusions
In summary, we have shown the electronic and optoelectronic properties of a proof-of-principle organic semiconductor–inorganic 2D semiconductor p–n junction. In particular, we have produced thin CuPc–MoS2 vertical devices using either monolayered or bilayered MoS2 flakes and demonstrated them to be multifunctional and electrostatically controllable. These devices can operate as gate-tunable rectifying diodes with rectifying factors of up to 104 and, under optical light exposure, they exhibit photocurrent generation associated with photogating of the MoS2 layer and a significantly large photovoltaic effect. Photoinduced carriers are mostly generated in the CuPc layer, while the role of MoS2 is mainly to control charge separation. As for the photovoltaic properties, we found open circuit voltages of up to Voc ∼ 0.6 V and a maximum of 0.7% optical-to-electrical power conversion efficiency at small bias. The EQE of the device has been tested at large Vds and small optical powers, leading to a maximum measured EQE ∼ 11%. The reduction of the efficiency of the optical-to-electrical power conversion when the incident optical power increases or the applied bias is reduced is associated with resistive losses and charge recombination mainly produced in the organic layer, factors that could be improved via device engineering. A variety of already-known organic semiconductors and 2D layered materials, together with the demonstrated capabilities of our proof of concept CuPc–MoS2 devices, point organic–2D material hybrids towards a promising alternative platform for future electronic and optoelectronic applications.
Materials and methods
Sample fabrication
The fabrication steps used to produce our devices are depicted in Fig. 1a. We began by transferring large MoS2 layers (either monolayers or bilayers) onto a Si++/SiO2 (285 nm) substrate by the PDMS dry transfer technique36 (step 1). The flakes were first identified via optical contrast and double-checked using Atomic Force Microscopy (Digital Instruments D3100 AFM) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw InVia). Two PMMA layers, 495 K A4 followed by 950 K A2, spin-coated at 4k rpm for 60 s and baked for 60 s at 195 °C, were used in steps 2 and 4. Electron-beam lithography (Raith 150-TWO) was used to define the electrodes (step 2) and opening a window (step 4). Two of the patterned electrodes were defined on top of the MoS2 flake and a third one was left free and close to the MoS2 flake. Metal deposition (step 3) was done via e-beam evaporation for Ti (4 nm) and thermal evaporation for Au (30 nm) in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of <10−6 mbar. Lift-off of the electrodes was done in acetone for several hours. The CuPc layer was thermally evaporated using a Knudsen cell at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1 in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10−9 mbar to fill the gap between the MoS2 flake and the free electrode (step 5). In addition by using a PMMA window to define the CuPc channel, the organic deposition was carried out through a metal shadow mask to limit the organic deposition area around the region of interest. A sketch of a resulting device and the measuring scheme can be seen in Fig. 1b. A contact on the Si++ substrate enables electrostatic gating across the SiO2. Note that in our devices Ti is in contact with the MoS2 flake, whereas Au is in contact with the CuPc organic layer. This allows minimizing the Schottky barrier formation at the metal–semiconductor interface and improving charge injection (or extraction).
Electronic and optoelectronic property characterization
All electronics and optoelectronics characterization was done in a Lakeshore Cryogenics probe station at room temperature and under vacuum (∼10−5 mbar). Phototransistor characterization (data shown in Fig. 3) was performed using a custom Schott ACE halogen-light source emitting in the visible spectra. By accounting for optical power losses and the geometrical disposition of the source with respect to the sample, an incident optical power density of ∼1 kW m−2 is estimated at the surface of the device. As for the photovoltaic characterization, the light excitation was provided by diode-pumped solid-state lasers operated in continuous wave mode (CNI Lasers). Light is coupled into a multimode optical fiber (NA = 0.23) through a parabolic mirror (freflected = 25.4 mm). At the end of the optical fiber, an identical parabolic mirror collimates the light. The beam is then directed into the probe station zoom lens system and then inside the cryostat. The beam was centred on the CuPc–MoS2 junction, which has a spot size (on the sample surface) of 230 ± 8 μm in diameter for all wavelengths, and thus covers the whole device area.
The incident optical power density at the surface of the device is calculated by dividing the optical power of the laser Plaser by the area of the laser spot Aspot. The absorbed optical power Popt is calculated by Popt = Plaser·Aj/Aspot, where Aj is the area covered by the CuPc–MoS2 junction. The area of the junction for the device explored in the main text (data corresponding to Fig. 4 and 5) is Aj = 12.1 × 5 = 60.5 μm2. Only the junction area is taken into account since this is the part where CuPc (absorber) is in direct contact with the MoS2 layer. Notice that there is not direct exposure of light to the MoS2 layer in any case.

 	Fig. 1  Fabrication of the CuPc–MoS2 p–n junction devices. (a) Fabrication steps followed to produce the devices: exfoliation of a MoS2 flake on a Si/SiO2 substrate (step 1); lithography (step 2) and lift-off after Ti/Au (4/30 nm) deposition (step 3) to define the electrodes on SiO2 and on MoS2; lithography to define and open a window on PMMA between one electrode on SiO2 and the MoS2 flake (step 4); deposition of CuPc through a shadow mask to cover the area with the opened window on PMMA defined in the previous step with CuPc (step 5). (b) Sketch of a final device with its electrical connections. For clarity, only CuPc within the p–n junction is depicted. (c) A bilayered MoS2 flake after fabrication step 1 and (d) after fabrication step 5. (e) Scheme of the band structure of the p–n junction device with a monolayered MoS2 in the rigid band structure. The work functions of the metals are also depicted. Energy levels for a bilayered MoS2 would slightly change to account for the bandgap reduction from 1.8 to 1.6 eV. A dashed line schematically shows where the Fermi energy level is expected to be at zero gate. Note that the application of a positive (negative) Vg would result in a modification of the EF upwards (downwards) in MoS2 as well as in a change in the available density of states at the HOMO level of CuPc.	 

 	Fig. 2  Gate-tunable diode characteristics of the CuPc–MoS2 devices. (a) Transfer curves Ids(Vg) measured in a representative CuPc–MoS2 device at a Vds = 16 V (red), in the MoS2 bilayer of the same device at a Vds = 5 V (blue) and in a CuPc transistor produced on the same wafer at a Vds = 16 V (black). For direct comparison among the curves, the current measured in MoS2 was re-scaled to account for the different Vds used. (b) Transfer curves of the CuPc–MoS2 device measured at different Vds ranging from 1 to 16 V in steps of 1 V. (c) The source–drain current vs. voltage Ids(Vds) rectifying characteristics modulated by a gate voltage Vg from −16 to 20 V in steps of 4 V. The inset shows the rectification properties of the p–n heterojunction under the application of an AC Vds at a fixed Vg = −18 V. Note that all measurements were taken under dark conditions.	 

 	Fig. 3  Comparison of the transfer curves measured in a CuPc–MoS2 device under dark conditions (Id–Vg; black) and under white light illumination (Il–Vg; red) for Vds = 16 V (forward bias condition) showing photogating effect. The black dashed arrow schematically shows the amount of photocurrent (Iph) generated at Vg = −30 V. Notice that the ratio Il/Id exceeds 10 at Vg = −30 V.	 

 	Fig. 4  Photovoltaic effect of a CuPc–MoS2 device: (a) and (b) as a function of gate voltage (laser optical power Plaser = 100 μW and λ = 640 nm); (c) and (d) as a function of wavelength (laser optical power Plaser = 500 μW and Vg = −20 V), and (e) and (f) as a function of incident laser optical power (Vg = −20 V and λ = 640 nm). Panels (b), (d) and (f) show the open circuit voltage Voc and short circuit current Isc extracted from the Ids(Vds) curves plotted in panels (a), (c) and (e), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Electrical power generation in a CuPc–MoS2 device. (a) Generated electrical power, Pel = Vds·Ids, as a function of Vds for different incident optical powers, Plaser, and fixed wavelength λ = 640 nm. Data extracted from Fig. 4e. (b) Corresponding optical (Popt) to electrical (Pel) power conversion efficiency extracted from the maximum electrical power Pel,m obtained from data in panel a at each Popt. To compute Popt from Plaser both the laser spot size and the area of the junction are taken into account (see Materials and methods for details).
