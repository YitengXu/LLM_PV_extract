    , Accepted 5th April 2016First published on 5th April 2016AbstractMany plant natural products have remarkable pharmacological activities. They are mainly produced directly by extraction from higher plants, which can hardly keep up with the surging global demand. Furthermore, the over-felling of many medicinal plants has undesirable effects on the ecological balance. In this study, we constructed a photoautotrophic platform with the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to directly convert the greenhouse gas CO2 into an array of valuable healthcare products, including resveratrol, naringenin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid. These six compounds can be further branched to many other precious and useful natural products. Various strategies including introducing a feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme, creating functional fusion proteins, and increasing malonyl-CoA supply have been systematically investigated to increase the production. The highest titers of these natural products reached 4.1–128.2 mg L−1 from the photoautotrophic system, which are highly comparable with those obtained by many other heterotrophic microorganisms using carbohydrates. Several advantages such as independence from carbohydrate feedstocks, functionally assembling P450s, and availability of plentiful NADPH and ATP support that this photosynthetic platform is uniquely suited for producing plant natural products. This platform also provides a green route for direct conversion of CO2 to many aromatic building blocks, a promising alternative to petrochemical-based production of bulk aromatic compounds.
Introduction
Plant natural products participate in many processes essential to plants, such as attractants for pollinators and disease resistance.1 These natural products have also been widely used as flavors, fragrances, and pheromones. Many of these products have remarkable pharmacological activities, particularly for diseases with high incidence and mortality rates.2,3 For example, curcumin has been considered to be a cancer chemopreventive agent,4 calanolide A is an anti-HIV drug,5 and caffeic acid esters are potent inhibitors of tumor cell growth.6 However, plants generally accumulate only small quantities of secondary metabolites, and there are frequently many structurally similar compounds present; thus, extraction or purification is often a challenge.7 Furthermore, the over-felling of many medicinal plants has undesirable effects on the ecological balance. In contrast, chemical synthesis is technically challenging and uneconomical because of the complexity of these molecules.8 For instance, the synthesis process of resveratrol from 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol includes eight reactions.9 This method requires the consumption of large quantities of chemicals that lead to environmental pollution. Many compounds from traditional chemical processes are “unnatural”, which limits their applications. Thus, the prices of these synthetic compounds were far lower than those of natural compounds.10 Moreover, many synthetic drugs have inevitable side effects, for example, thalidomide causes birth defects.11 Recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have enabled the tailored production of plant natural products using microbial fermentation of carbohydrates.12–15 However, these heterotrophic systems have some limitations, such as an inadequate supply of NADPH, leading to low yields. Moreover, these systems require the addition of organic carbon feedstocks and depend on cellular respiration, thus resulting in net CO2 release. While significant progress has been made in the last 20 years,14,15 the sustainable biosynthesis of plant natural products still remains a tremendous challenge.
More than 100 years ago, Giacomo Ciamician proposed that photochemistry, the production of chemicals as it is done by green plants, remains one of the basic alternatives to be considered for achieving a real green synthesis.16,17 Utilization of photosynthetic microorganisms may realize this perspective for the synthesis of natural products. Cyanobacteria are unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms that have several advantages for biotechnological processes, such as a fast growth rate compared to plants, tolerance of marginal conditions, and being tractable for genetic engineering.18 Most importantly, owing to their simple input requirement and high solar conversion efficiency they have garnered a great deal of attention,19 and these organisms have been used to produce biofuels and numerous bulk chemicals, including 1,3-propanediol,20 isobutyraldehyde,21 2,3-butanediol,22 fatty acids,23 and n-butanol.24 However, the production of high-value natural products directly from CO2 remains largely unexplored.
Noticeably, cyanobacteria share a wide range of metabolic pathways with plants,25 making them well-suited for expressing plant enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450s) that are difficult to express functionally in common prokaryotic systems.26 Furthermore, photosynthesis is generally more efficient in cyanobacteria than in terrestrial plants.18 Thus, the generation of copious amounts of ATP and NADPH from solar energy27 has the potential to channel excess chemical energy and reducing power into the light-driven synthesis of plant natural products. Moreover, the economics of producing compounds in photobioreactors (Table S1†) may favor the large-scale production of higher value compounds, including plant natural products.18
In the present study, a microbial photosynthetic platform was developed by introducing an artificial phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway into the autotrophic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. Using this photoautotrophic platform, an array of natural products, including p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, can be generated directly from CO2 and solar energy (Fig. 1). The photosynthetic platform can also be used to directly convert CO2 to aromatic building blocks such as p-hydroxystyrene, a monomer used in the production of polymers, and a petroleum-based feedstock for resins, elastomers and adhesives.28,29 This autotrophic photosynthetic platform represents a major advance in the environmentally friendly and sustainable production of high-value natural products and aromatic building blocks, as well as creates the possibility for scale-up by implementing newly designed photobioreactors.

Results
Construction of a photoautotrophic platform for the production of plant natural products
An autotrophic photosynthetic platform was designed for de novo biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids from CO2 (Fig. 1). This microbial platform includes the biosynthetic pathways of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid, core compounds in phenylpropanoid pathways that could be directly connected with CO2 input channels. The leading enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) converts L-tyrosine to p-coumaric acid.30,31 The latter is further converted to caffeic acid by 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H).31,32 The conversion of caffeic acid to ferulic acid is catalyzed by caffeate O-methyltransferase (COMT).33 A wide variety of phenylpropanoids and their derivatives, such as stilbenes, flavonoids, and curcuminoids, can be subsequently synthesized from the phenylpropanoic acids as described above (see Fig. 1).
For instance, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) can convert p-coumaric acid to 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which is subsequently condensed with three molecules of malonyl-CoA by stilbene synthase, a type III polyketide synthase (PKS). Stilbene synthase directs the enzymatic cascade into the general stilbenoid pathway via the production of the main stilbenoid precursor resveratrol.34,35 Another type III PKS, chalcone synthase, catalyzes the condensation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA, producing naringenin-chalcone.36 As the precursor for the synthesis of flavonoids, naringenin can be produced from naringenin-chalcone using chalcone isomerase.37 Through the action of curcuminoid synthase, bisdemethoxycurcumin can be produced from two molecules of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and one molecule of malonyl-CoA.38 Using enzymes that hydroxylate, reduce, alkylate, and glucosylate the phenylpropanoid core structures of resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, a variety of stilbenoids, flavonoids, and curcuminoids can be produced.39
We constructed eighteen plasmids for the production of phenylpropanoids (Fig. S1†). The genes used here and their source organisms are listed in Table S2.† All genes were placed under the control of the trc promoter and designed to integrate into neutral site I (NS I) of S. elongatus PCC7942 (Fig. 2A). Colony PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to verify genome integration (Fig. S2†). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to examine whether the transcription of the heterologous genes was successful (Fig. S3†).

A prominent role of the feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme in p-coumaric acid production
As the starting point, we expressed SeTAL and RsTAL in S. elongatus PCC7942, respectively, and successfully detected their corresponding metabolic product p-coumaric acid; however, the respective recombinant strains SP-1 and SP-2 produced only a small quantity (below 1.5 mg L−1) of p-coumaric acid (Fig. 3A). A recent study suggested that a laccase in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 degrades p-coumaric acid, producing 4-vinylphenol.40 To investigate possible pathways degrading p-coumaric acid, we analysed the genome of S. elongatus PCC7942. We found that a hypothetical enzyme (Syc0346) in S. elongatus PCC7942 shares 51% sequence identity with the identified laccase (Fig. S4A†). Nevertheless, no 4-vinylphenol was detected in the Synechococcus culture. Meanwhile, p-coumaric acid was found to be stable under our conditions and it was only decreased by less than 20% after 2 days of culture (Fig. S5†). We next analysed the crude enzyme extract of S. elongatus PCC7942 and found that it did not appear to catalyze the degradation of p-coumaric acid (Fig. S4B†). Our results rule out the possibility of p-coumaric acid degradation and it is likely that other causes lead to the low production. One reason for this may be an inadequate supply of intracellular L-tyrosine governed by a native 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) which is inhibited by a unique L-tyrosine feedback loop (Fig. S6†).41,42 We reasoned that the introduction of feedback-inhibition-resistant DAHPS (fbr-DAHPS) into the recombinant strains may improve the production of p-coumaric acid.

The growth curves (colored lines) and p-coumaric acid production (colored columns) of Synechococcus strains under various culture conditions. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). The “-light” means strains were grown in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under constant light exposure (100 μE s−1 m−2); “-light/dark” means a 12 h light–12 h dark growth regime (simulating the natural day and night cycle). Effects of IPTG on (E) the transcription level of heterologous genes and (F) production of p-coumaric acid. All values are relative to the expression levels of the corresponding rnpB gene (the housekeeping gene, whose transcription product is the RNA component of RNase P), which were set at 100. Pink and green columns indicate the expression levels of the sam8 and aroG gene, respectively. Results are presented as the average of six repetitions (triplicate reverse transcription reactions from two independent total RNA samples). 
The new strains SP-3 and SP-4 were then constructed on the basis of SP-1 and SP-2, respectively, with an fbr-DAHPS gene from E. coli integrated. The cell growth was slightly affected by the introduction of heterologous genes (Fig. 3B). After 20 days of culture, the yields of p-coumaric acid reached 51.1 mg L−1 and 79.6 mg L−1 in SP-3 and SP-4, respectively (Fig. 3A), achieving more than 30 fold improvement in comparison with their parental strains. The corresponding production rates were 2.6 mg per L per day and 4.0 mg per L per day, respectively. By comparison, no p-coumaric acid was detected in the culture of SP-5, which only contained the aroGfbr gene (encoding fbr-DAHPS) as a reference. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that the expression level of the gene tal was slightly higher than that of the gene sam8 (Fig. S7†). However, the p-coumaric acid production capacity in SP-4 was approximately 1.5 times higher than that of SP-3, indicating that SeTAL was more efficient than RsTAL in producing p-coumaric acid. We also constructed the recombinant strain SP-6 containing the aroG and sam8 genes to evaluate the effect of the feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme. After growth of SP-6 for 20 days, 5.3 mg per L p-coumaric acid accumulated in the BG11 medium (Fig. 3C). This result indicates that high expression of DAHPS can increase the production of p-coumaric acid by approximately 3-fold and that the introduction of a feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme can further advance the production by more than 10-fold.
Improving p-coumaric acid production in the engineered cyanobacterium
Continuous aeration with CO2-enriched air (5%, v/v) increased the growth rate of SP-4 (Fig. 3D) and improved the production level of p-coumaric acid (up to 121.7 mg L−1 within 12 days). The corresponding production rate was 10.1 mg per L per day; this value was 1.8 times higher than that of the resting culture without continuous aeration. This result indicates that the production of p-coumaric acid was promoted by CO2 aeration. To explore the performance of SP-4 under natural conditions, the production of p-coumaric acid was analyzed during a 12 h light–12 h dark growth regime simulating a natural day and night cycle. Approximately 67.9 mg per L p-coumaric acid was obtained, which was lower than the levels produced by growth under continuous light (Fig. 3D).
To evaluate the effect of the gene transcription level on p-coumaric acid production, SP-4 was induced using various concentrations of IPTG. As shown in Fig. 3E, the leaky expression of the biosynthetic genes produced a lower p-coumaric acid yield of 31.1 mg L−1. Subsequently, as the concentration of IPTG increased, the titers of p-coumaric acid have been improved slightly. Under continuous aeration with CO2-enriched air, the highest titer reached 128.2 mg L−1 when 0.5 mM IPTG was added (Fig. 3F). In contrast, 87.1 mg per L, 101.6 mg per L, and 93.4 mg per L p-coumaric acid were detected when 0.1, 0.2, and 2 mM IPTG were added, respectively. No apparent change in growth occurred when the IPTG concentration was <1 mM (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that suitable expression levels of the heterologous genes can improve the production of p-coumaric acid. A previous research study has shown that lactose can be employed as the inducer of the trc promoter instead of IPTG,43 and lactose is economically priced. Thus, we tested lactose instead of IPTG to induce the expression of heterologous genes in recombinant S. elongatus PCC7942. As shown in Fig. S8,† 119.6 mg per L p-coumaric acid was detected when 0.5 mM lactose was added; this titer is equivalent to that on the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG, supporting that lactose could be a cost-effective inducer applied in this sustainable system.
Production of phenylpropanoic acids by functional expression of plant P450
Recombinant strain SP-7 was constructed by the introduction of the sam5 gene into SP-4 for caffeic acid production. After 12 days of culture, SP-7 produced 1.2 mg per L caffeic acid (Fig. 4A), and a significant amount of p-coumaric acid (26.7 mg L−1) was also detected. This result suggests the moderate activity of Sam5, which did not convert p-coumaric acid into caffeic acid completely. To determine the in vivo enzyme activity of the microbial C3H (SeC3H), the sam5 gene was independently expressed in the recombinant strain SP-8. After 48 h of growth in BG11 supplemented with 164 mg per L (1 mM) p-coumaric acid, a caffeic acid yield of 15.4 mg L−1 was reached; however, 32.7 mg per L of p-coumaric acid remained. Indeed, these results indicate that the low yield of caffeic acid was caused by insufficient activity of SeC3H. To address this inefficiency, a plant C3H (AtC3H) which has better enzymatic kinetics31 was used to replace the SeC3H, creating SP-9. After the addition of 1 mM p-coumaric acid, the caffeic acid yield of this strain reached 48.1 mg L−1 after 48 h of culture. After the growth of SP-10 for 11 days, 4.7 mg per L caffeic acid accumulated in the BG11 medium, which represents an approximately 3-fold increase compared to that produced by SP-7; the corresponding production rate was 0.43 mg per L per day. Based on the improved production of caffeic acid, we further attempt to synthesize ferulic acid by the addition of the comt gene to SP-10. As a result, caffeic acid was successfully converted to ferulic acid with a yield of 6.3 mg L−1 (Fig. 4A and S9†) by the recombinant strain SP-11, and the corresponding production rate was 0.53 mg per L per day.

Production of plant polyketides by protein scaffold and redirection of metabolic flux
With the production of available precursors, recombinant strains SP-12, SP-13, and SP-14 were constructed to contain various type III polyketide synthase genes (i.e. sts, chs, cus) for their ability to synthesize plant polyketides. After 11–12 days of culture, 0.7 mg per L resveratrol, 2.1 mg per L naringenin, and 1.3 mg per L bisdemethoxycurcumin were detected, respectively (Fig. 4B). To increase the local concentration of metabolites and enhance biosynthetic efficiency,44 we linked 4cl with different type III PKS genes to construct the recombinant strains SP-15, SP-16, and SP-17, and evaluated the production of polyketides. Strains SP-15, SP-16, and SP-17 produced 2.2 mg per L resveratrol, 4.3 mg per L naringenin, and 2.9 mg per L bisdemethoxycurcumin, respectively, corresponding to yields that were 2.1-, 1-, and 1.2-fold higher than those produced by strains SP-12, SP-13, and SP-14.
We next examined how to enhance the supply of malonyl-CoA that might be one of the bottlenecks of polyketide synthesis. We tested the use of cerulenin that can limit the amount of malonyl-CoA channelling to fatty acid synthesis45 and thus may improve the production of polyketides. Addition of cerulenin slightly impaired growth (Fig. S10†), while, in line with our prediction, cerulenin supplementation did enhance the production of resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin by 119%, 65%, and 41%, respectively, corresponding to titers of 4.6 mg L−1, 7.1 mg L−1, and 4.1 mg L−1. The corresponding production rates were 0.42 mg per L per day, 0.59 mg per L per day, and 0.34 mg per L per day, respectively. We further investigate the yields of these compounds in the absence of IPTG in the culture. As shown in Fig. 4C, recombinant strains SP-10, SP-11, SP-15, SP-16, and SP-17 produced 4.2 mg per L caffeic acid, 4.9 mg per L ferulic acid, 3.5 mg per L resveratrol, 6.0 mg per L naringenin, and 4.3 mg per L bisdemethoxycurcumin, respectively. This is in accord with previous research studies, which suggest that many genes were not in tight regulation with the IPTG inducible promoter in cyanobacteria, including S. elongatus PCC7942.46,47
Production of phenylpropanoids under dark conditions
Many species of cyanobacteria break down the stored glycogen under dark conditions, and carbon flux could be partially distributed to the aromatic amino acid pathway.48 We tested the production capacity of recombinant strains under dark conditions. Removing nitrogen or phosphate can increase cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations49 and may improve phenylpropanoid production. BG-11–N, BG-11–P, and BG-11–N, P were used in place of BG-11, and the highest phenylpropanoid titers occurred in BG-11–N and BG-11–P cultures (Fig. 4D), suggesting that nitrate and phosphate limitation have a positive effect on phenylpropanoic acid and polyketide production under dark conditions. The OD730 and dry cell weight (DCW) of recombinant strains barely changed during the course of culturing (similar to the wild-type strain, Fig. S11†), and the highest productivities of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin observed were 1.773, 0.218, 0.279, 0.132, 0.186, and 0.121 mg per g DCW, respectively. Therefore, this dark approach is an alternative method for phenylpropanoid production; further increasing the cell density of recombinant strains may result in significant levels of production.
Discussion
Health, energy production, and climate change are considered to be three of humanity's most pressing problems. Here, we developed an autotrophic photosynthetic platform to generate high-value plant metabolites directly from CO2 and sunlight, which may lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases as well as offer a range of valuable healthcare products. We selected S. elongatus PCC7942, a model cyanobacterium that is able to tolerate p-coumaric acid at hundreds of milligrams per litre (see Fig. S12†). To develop the autotrophic platform, key enzymes with different sources were carefully evaluated, functional fusion proteins were created, a feedback-inhibition-resistant enzyme was introduced, and the carbon flux was redistributed to increase malonyl-CoA supply to polyketide synthesis. After the manipulation of these strategies, large gains in phenylpropanoid production were realized.
Recombinant strains driven by solar energy, supplied with water, CO2, and a few required mineral nutrients, yield 128.2 mg per L of p-coumaric acid, 4.7 mg per L of caffeic acid, 6.3 mg per L of ferulic acid, 4.6 mg per L of resveratrol, 7.1 mg per L of naringenin, and 4.1 mg per L of bisdemethoxycurcumin. These yields are highly comparable with the productivity in many heterotrophic and mixotrophic microorganisms using organic carbon sources.40,50,51 Thus, combined with our results, the use of the autotrophic photosynthetic platform would be more economical and suitable for the production of phenylpropanoids without requiring organic carbon source addition. The results reflect several advantages of using the autotrophic cyanobacterium for sustainable production of plant natural products: independence from carbohydrate feedstocks, the assembly of functional P450s, and the availability of plentiful NADPH and ATP (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Proposed unique cyanobacterial system for sustainably producing plant natural products. The multifunctional and intracellular membrane system in cyanobacteria is called the thylakoid (similar to thylakoid in chloroplast). Here is a diagram of the thylakoid membrane and complexes involved in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Red balls mean the plant cytochrome P450s (including 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase), which are located in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria (S. elongatus PCC7942). Abbreviations: G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Fd, ferredoxin; PC, plastocyanin; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; PQ, plastoquinone; Cytb6/f, cytochrome b6-f complex. All parts of this figure were drawn by Jun Ni. 
Firstly, this microbial platform does not require carbohydrate feedstocks. These valuable plant natural products produced directly from CO2 represent a major advance in this field. Recently, Xue et al. genetically engineered a mixotrophic Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 to produce ∼82.6 mg per L p-coumaric acid when 5 mM glucose was added.40 Their recombinant strain was constructed by the introduction of TAL and deletion of hypothetical laccase. As a different strategy, we introduced a feedback-inhibition-resistant DAHPS to advance the production of p-coumaric acid by more than 50-fold. Besides p-coumaric acid, an array of phenylpropanoids were successfully produced from our autotrophic photosynthetic platform. Furthermore, our metabolically engineered photosynthetic platform avoids centrifugation, resuspension, and other cumbersome treatments;40 it allows for in situ production of plant natural products in a manner similar to growing and harvesting crops from farmland.
More importantly, as shown in Fig. S13,† the cell growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was remarkably improved by the addition of glucose. However, the OD730 of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 without glucose has changed little. These indicate that the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was growing heterotrophically on glucose. Tyrosine is the precursor of p-coumaric acid, and can reflect the source of p-coumaric acid to a certain extent. According to our 13C-isotope results (Fig. S14†), the yield of free tyrosine has shown a significant increase with the addition of glucose. Meanwhile, a considerable amount of 13C labeled tyrosine was detected; M5 has the highest abundance. This is due to the fact that tyrosine uses one E4P and two PEPs as precursors, and one PEP will lose one carbon so that two PEPs only contribute five carbons for tyrosine.42 Under mixotrophic conditions, the cells use both glucose and CO2 for tyrosine synthesis (likely E4P is from CO2 fixation and PEPs are from glycolysis). Our labeled data confirm that the addition of glucose into Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 culture allowed a high proportion of glucose carbons contributing to tyrosine, the precursor of p-coumaric acid. S. elongatus PCC7942 was used as a control; we have not detected any 13C labeled tyrosine in the culture. This is due to the fact that S. elongatus PCC7942 has no glucose transporter and cannot take up labeled glucose.52 According to our experimental approach, no organic carbon source was added to the culture. Thus, all the products have originated from CO2; unlike the previous study,40 this is the real autotrophic photosynthetic platform.
Secondly, cytochrome P450s can be expressed as functional enzymes in this microbial platform. One of the most challenging aspects in the reconstruction of plant pathways in prokaryotes is their compatibility with plant enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s. Cytochrome P450s play key roles in the biosynthesis of plant metabolites. For example, nearly half of the 19 enzymatic steps involved in the paclitaxel pathway are catalyzed by P450s.53 We expressed a plant C3H (AtC3H) in E. coli and fed the recombinant strain with p-coumaric acid. However, no caffeic acid was detected in the culture. We also expressed another plant P450 in E. coli, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), which converts trans-cinnamic acid to p-coumaric acid,54 but did not detect any functional C4H protein. This is in accordance with the problematic expression of cytochrome P450s in most bacterial systems because of the lack of internal membrane systems.53 However, plant P450s are typically membrane-bound because they have a hydrophobic segment.55 In comparison, the cyanobacterial system contains a multifunctional and intracellular membrane system known as the thylakoids (Fig. 5). In this study, the recombinant strain SP-18 was constructed by introducing the c4h gene into S. elongatus PCC7942. After 48 h of growth in BG11 supplemented with 1 mM trans-cinnamic acid, the yield of p-coumaric acid reached 73.2 mg L−1. The thylakoid membrane fractions of recombinant strains SP-9 and SP-18 were extracted and analyzed, and the enzymatic activities of 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase were detected, respectively (Table S3†). This is consistent with a previous study that showed that the thylakoid fraction from a Synechocystis transformant displayed specific immunoreactivity with the corresponding P450 antibody.26 Thus, cytochrome P450s can assemble into functional enzymes and are located in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria, which may not be possible in other prokaryotic systems.55,56 Additionally, we analyzed the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org) as shown in Fig. S15,† and found that approximately 8.6% of the selected proteins have potential transmembrane domains. These potential membrane-binding proteins, which include hydrolases, isomerases, ligases, lyases, oxidoreductases, and transferases, may also be expressed as functional enzymes in cyanobacteria for the biosynthesis of many metabolites.
Thirdly, there are plentiful NADPH and ATP in this microbial platform. The native NADPH-regenerating metabolism of bacteria and yeast is typically not sufficient to support high levels of P450s; however, the photosynthetic electron transport chain of cyanobacteria can provide plentiful NADPH (Fig. 5).27 The copious supply of ATP in cyanobacteria also facilitates the biosynthesis of plant metabolites18 in numerous energy-consuming enzymatic steps, such as the conversion of p-coumaric acid into 4-coumaroyl-CoA.
The growth of S. elongatus PCC7942 was inhibited by most phenylpropanoids at concentrations above 50 mg L−1 (Fig. S9†); this concentration far exceeds those produced by the engineered strains, indicating that the production can be significantly increased. In this study, we introduced fbr-DAHPS into S. elongatus PCC7942 that greatly improved the production of p-coumaric acid, which clearly suggests that redirection of carbon flux from the central metabolism into aromatic amino acid pathways and elimination of precursor competition will further improve their production.57 We also successfully applied a commonly used method in synthetic biology (fusion protein strategy) to increase polyketide yields by 1.5 to 3 times. Many other synthetic biology strategies for increasing product yields may also work in S. elongatus PCC7942. Polyketide yields were increased by 41–119% with the addition of cerulenin; this suggests that inhibition of the synthesis of fatty acids was an effective method for increasing polyketide yields. However, cerulenin is relatively expensive. Deleting the genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis may avoid the use of cerulenin. Furthermore, using a light-induced promoter or an iron-induced promoter instead of the trc promoter may avoid the use of IPTG or lactose.58,59 Addition of S. elongatus PCC7942 accelerated the degradation of resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin under light conditions, whereas no effect was observed under dark conditions (Fig. S16†). This instability may be a result of photo-oxidative degradation caused by oxidases. A deeper understanding of cyanobacterial metabolism will reveal which enzymes are involved, and deletion of these enzymes may improve the production of desired compounds. Another way is the addition of UDP-glycosyltransferases. The stability and hydrophilicity of phenylpropanoids can be increased by glycosylation,60 and thus may increase yields.
Our study described an engineered autotrophic photosynthetic microorganism for the production of valuable phenylpropanoids and aromatics directly from CO2. This method can save a large expanse of farmland. We suppose that the photobioreactor is one hectare, and the corresponding volume will be 310000 L.61 The time suitable for growing is 300 days per year,62 and there is 8 h light per day. Taking resveratrol as an example, our platform can produce 14.2 kg per ha natural resveratrol every year. However, one hectare of grape only produces about 1.8 kg resveratrol every year. Thus, just for the production of 1 ton natural resveratrol, our method may save about 485 hectares of farmland. A growing number of plant metabolites have been identified and shown to have medicinal effects. Benefitting from the advances in metabolomics and genomics, their metabolic pathways and key enzymes have also been examined.63,64 Our microbial platform may be expanded to recycle CO2 directly into many other high-value natural products. Compared to previous related studies in cyanobacteria, the biosynthesis of the plant metabolites has unparalleled advantages and higher commercial value than the production of biofuels and bulk chemicals. The rising demand for medicinal plant metabolites can promote the implementation of the commercially successful photobioreactor; this will facilitate the development of the corresponding scaled-up facilities and production processes. Subsequently, the photosynthetic production of fuels and bulk chemicals with cyanobacteria may become practicable.
Conclusions
In this study, we developed a photoautotrophic platform for generating high-value plant natural products directly from CO2 and sunlight. Resveratrol, naringenin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid are successfully produced from this autotrophic photosynthetic platform. The highest titer of these natural products reached 4.1–128.2 mg L−1, which are highly comparable with the productivity in many other heterotrophic microorganisms using carbohydrates. A variety of stilbenoids, flavonoids, and curcuminoids can be produced by employing enzymes that hydroxylate, reduce, alkylate, and glucosylate the phenylpropanoid core structures. This platform represents a promising system for the sustainable production of plant natural products and aromatic building blocks.
Experimental procedures
Chemicals, bacterial strains, and plasmids
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. Restriction enzymes, ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.), and DNA polymerase (Takara Biochemicals Inc.) were used for cloning and plasmid construction. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The characteristics of bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table S4.† The pEASY-Blunt cloning vector (Transgen, China) was used for subcloning genes. The shuttle vector pAM2991 was used for expressing genes in E. coli and inserting gene cassettes into the Neutral Site I (NS I) of the S. elongatus PCC7942 genome. Saccharothrix espanaensis (ATCC 51144) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (ATCC 17023) were obtained from ATCC, and used for cloning the sam8 and tal genes, respectively. The plasmid tyrAfbr-aroGfbr-tktA-ppsA/pCOLA was kindly provided by Professor Hiromichi Minami,65 and used for cloning the aroGfbr gene. S. elongatus PCC7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were from the ATCC. E. coli DH5α and E. coli BL21 (DE3) were used for general cloning and expression of biosynthetic genes.
Bacterial cultivation conditions

S. espanaensis and R. sphaeroides were cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 30 °C. E. coli was cultured in LB medium at 37 °C supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. The working concentrations of antibiotics were as follows: 100 μg per ml ampicillin, 50 μg per ml kanamycin, and 100 μg per ml spectinomycin. Synechococcus sp. strains were cultured without agitation in BG-11 medium at 30 °C, under continuous lighting with an illumination intensity of 100 μE s−1 m−2, unless otherwise stated. For the production of phenylpropanoids, S. elongatus cells in the exponential phase were diluted to 0.05 (OD730) in 100 mL BG-11 medium containing 20 mg per L spectinomycin and continuously aerated with CO2-enriched air (5%, v/v) using a simple bubble column. After an OD730 of 0.5–0.6 was achieved, IPTG was added into the cultures to produce a final concentration of 1 mM. Samples were collected at intervals of 1 or 2 days and then analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS. Cell growth of Synechococcus sp. strains was monitored by measuring the optical density at 730 nm. To improve the available amount of malonyl-CoA, cerulenin (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, Shanghai, China) was added at a concentration of 20 mg l−1 after the OD730 reached 0.5–0.6. For the substrate tolerance experiments, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, naringenin, resveratrol, and bisdemethoxycurcumin were added to the medium at different concentrations.
For the substrate stability experiments, cells were grown using 10 ml BG-11 medium under constant light exposure until the OD730 reached 2.0. Approximately 5 mg per l or 50 mg per l of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, naringenin, resveratrol, and bisdemethoxycurcumin were added to the culture and BG-11 medium without strains for use as a negative control. After culturing under constant light or dark conditions for 2 days, samples were collected at intervals of 8 h. For the production of phenylpropanoids under dark conditions, cells were grown in 100 ml BG-11 medium at 30 °C under constant light exposure (100 μE s−1 m−2) until the OD730 reached 1.0. Subsequently, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a tenth of the original volume in the fresh BG11 media. After wrapping the tubes with aluminum foil, cells were cultured at 30 °C and harvested at 1-day intervals. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS.
Heterologous pathway construction
All DNA manipulations and general molecular biology techniques were performed according to standard protocols.66 Primers used in this study are listed in Tables S5–S13.† The plasmids constructed in this work are listed in Table S4† and briefly described. Genomic DNAs were extracted from E. coli K12, R. sphaeroides and S. espanaensis using a bacterial genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The aroG gene was amplified by high-fidelity PCR from the genomic DNA of E. coli K12 with the primers AflII-aroG-F/BglII-aroG-R. The tal gene (GenBank accession no. CP000144.2) was amplified by high-fidelity PCR from the genomic DNA of R. sphaeroides with the primers XhoI-tal-F and BamHI-tal-R. The sam8 gene (GenBank accession no. DQ357071) and sam5 gene (GenBank accession no. DQ357071) were amplified from the genomic DNA of S. espanaensis with the primers XhoI-sam8-F/BamHI-sam8-R and EcoRI-sam5-F/AflII-sam5-R. Plasmids sam8/PAM and tal/PAM were constructed by inserting the resulting PCR products into the XhoI/BamHI site of PAM2991. The trc promoter (Ptrc) was amplified from the plasmid PAM2991 with primers BglII-Ptrc-F and XhoI-Ptrc-R and cloned into the BglII/XhoI sites of PAM2991 to construct PAM2. The gene aroGfbr was amplified from tyrAfbr-aroGfbr-tktA-ppsA/pCOLA with primers AflII-aroG-F/BglII-aroG-R and cloned into the AflII/BglII sites of PAM2, and then the tal and sam8 fragments were cloned into the XhoI/BamHI site of this plasmid to construct sam8-aroGfbr/PAM and tal-aroGfbr/PAM, respectively. The aroG gene was cloned into the AflII/BglII sites of PAM2, and then the sam8 fragment was cloned into the XhoI/BamHI site of this plasmid to construct sam8-aroG/PAM. The ref8 gene (GenBank accession no. AK226377.1), the comt gene (GenBank accession no. U70424.1), the chi gene (GenBank accession no. AJ418046.1), and the c4h gene (GenBank accession no. U37235.1) from Arabidopsis thaliana, the chs gene (GenBank accession no. S80857.1) from Petunia hybrida, the sts gene (GenBank accession no. AB027606.1) from Arachis hypogaea, and the cus gene (GenBank accession no. AK109558.1) from Oryza sativa were codon-optimized and synthesized by recombinant PCR; the 4cl gene (GenBank accession no. KF765780.1) from Petroselinum crispum was codon-optimized and ligated to the trc promoter, and then synthesized by recombinant PCR. The optimization of these genes was based on the preferred codon usage of S. elongatus PCC7942, and JCat online was used to design the new genes.67 Gene sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession no. KP284561–KP284568), and primers used for recombinant PCR are listed in Tables S5–S12.† To construct chs-4cl/PAM, sts-4cl/PAM, and cus-4cl/PAM, the 4cl gene was amplified with primers XhoI-4cl-F/BamHI-4cl-R and cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of PAM2, and then chs, sts, and cus were cloned into the EcoRI/AflII sites of 4cl/PAM. The EcoRI/AflII fragment containing chs, the EcoRI/BamHI fragment containing 4cl (ligated to Ptrc) and the XhoI/EcoRI fragment containing chi were sequentially ligated into the cognate sites of PAM2, generating chs-chi-4cl/PAM. The aroGfbr fragments were amplified from aroGfbr/PAM with primers SalI-aroGfbr-F and HindIII-aroGfbr-R, and the sam8 fragment was amplified from sam8/PAM with primers XhoI-sam8-F and BglII-sam8-R, two Ptrc fragments were amplified from PAM2991 with primers AflII-Ptrc-F/SalI-Ptrc-R and HindIII-Ptrc-F/XhoI-Ptrc-R. The Ptrc-aroGfbr-Ptrc-sam8 fragment, constructed by assembling the aroGfbr fragment, sam8 fragment, and two Ptrc fragments, was ligated into chs-4cl/PAM, sts-4cl/PAM, cus-4cl/PAM, and chs-chi-4cl/PAM, generating chs-4cl-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, sts-4cl-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, cus-4cl-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, and chs-chi-4cl-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, respectively.
To construct the 4cl::chs, 4cl::sts and 4cl::cus fusion genes, the stop codon of 4cl was replaced by a three amino-acid linker (Gly–Ser–Gly) to couple 4cl with different type III PKS genes (chs, sts, and cus). In the first round of recombinant PCR, mutations were introduced into 4cl, chs, sts, and cus using six pairs of primers, XhoI-4cl-F/4cl::chs-R, 4cl::chs-F/BamHI-chs-R, XhoI-4cl-F/4cl::sts-R, 4cl::sts-F/BamHI-sts-R, XhoI-4cl-F/4cl::cus-R, and 4cl::cus-F/BamHI-cus-R, respectively. The resulting PCR products were purified and served as templates for overlapping extension PCR using the primers XhoI-4cl-F/BamHI-chs-R, XhoI-4cl-F/BamHI-sts-R, and XhoI-4cl-F/BamHI-cus-R. The resulting fusion genes 4cl::chs, 4cl::sts, and 4cl::cus were cloned into the XhoI/BamHI sites of PAM2 to construct 4cl::chs/PAM, 4cl::sts/PAM, and 4cl::cus/PAM, respectively. The aroGfbr-Ptrc-sam8 fragment was amplified from chs-4cl-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM and ligated into the three plasmids, generating 4cl::chs-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, 4cl::sts-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, and 4cl::cus-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, respectively. The SalI/BglII fragments containing chi and the AflII/SalI fragment containing Ptrc were sequentially ligated into the cognate sites of 4cl::chs-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM, generating 4cl::chs-chi-sam8-aroGfbr/PAM. Plasmids sam5/PAM and ref8/PAM were constructed by inserting the sam5 and ref8 into the EcoRI/AflII site of PAM, and then the AflII/BglII fragment for Ptrc-aroGfbr-Ptrc-sam8 was ligated into sam5/PAM and ref8/PAM, yielding sam8-aroGfbr-sam5/PAM and sam8-aroGfbr-ref8/PAM, respectively. The plasmid sam8-aroGfbr-ref8-comt/PAM was constructed by inserting the comt gene into the XhoI/BamHI site of sam8-aroGfbr-ref8/PAM. To construct c4h/PAM, the c4h gene was cloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of PAM.
Transformation of S. espanaensis
Plasmids were transformed into S. elongatus PCC7942 as previously described.68 Strains were grown to an OD730 of 0.4–0.6 and then 2 μg of plasmid DNA was added to the 500 μl cultures. After 12 h of culture in the dark, the strains were spread on BG-11 plates supplemented with 20 mg per L spectinomycin for the selection of successful recombinants. Genomic DNA was extracted from liquid cultures of the recombinants and PCR amplified using gene-specific primers to verify that the target genes had been integrated correctly into the NS I of the S. elongatus PCC7942 genome.
Cell extract assay

S. elongatus PCC7942 was grown in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under constant light, and cells were harvested via centrifugation (6000g, 5 min) until the OD730 reached 4.0. After being washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), the harvested cells were resuspended in the same buffer containing 2 mM dithiothreitol. Cell extracts were prepared via bead beating and the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation and used for the enzyme assay. The total protein concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The enzyme reaction was performed in a 1 ml reaction mixture containing 2 mM p-coumaric acid and 100 μl cell extracts. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C and terminated by adding 20 μl HCl (50%). The remaining amount of p-coumaric acid was measured and quantified by HPLC.
Thylakoid membrane preparation

S. elongatus cultures were grown in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under constant light. After an OD730 of 0.5–0.6 was achieved, IPTG was added into the cultures to produce a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were washed with and resuspended in 0.6 mL thylakoid buffer (20 mM MES/NaOH (pH 6.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 20% glycerol (vol/vol), 1 mM freshly made phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM benzamidine) until the OD730 reached 2 (dry cell weight ∼400 mg l−1). The cell extract was prepared via bead beating and the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min. After centrifugation at 50000g for 10 min, the thylakoids were sedimented. The pellet of thylakoid membranes was washed with 2 mL thylakoid buffer and homogenized in the same buffer to a volume of 500 μl.26 The enzyme reaction was performed in a 1 ml reaction mixture containing 2 mM NADPH, 1 mM substrate (trans-cinnamic acid or p-coumaric acid) and 100 μl of thylakoid membrane in reaction buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH = 7.0). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by adding 50 μl 6 M HCl. The amounts of products (p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid, respectively) were measured and quantified by HPLC.
RT-PCR analysis of synthetic pathway genes
The recombinant S. elongatus strains were grown in BG11 medium at 30 °C, and 1 mM of IPTG was added to the culture when the OD730 reached 0.6. Cells were collected for total RNA extraction using an RNAprep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) after 3 days of culture, and RNA was quantified using a NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Sweden). Removal of genomic DNA from RNA preparations was performed using Thermo Scientific DNase I, and a total of 2 μg RNA was used for reverse transcription reactions using random primers and SuperScriptTMШ Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). Relative RNA concentrations were determined by quantitative RT-PCR using a 7300 Real-time PCR system with RealMasterMix (SYBR Green) (Tiangen Biotech Co.). Primers were designed using Beacon Designer 8.12 (Table S12†). The amount of mRNA was quantified against a standard curve using the CT value.
Stable-isotope labelling experiments
According to the previous experimental approach,40Synechocystis PCC6803 and S. elongatus PCC7942 cultures were grown in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under normal light until an OD730 of ∼0.7. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 3500g for 10 min and resuspended in BG-11 medium at 1/10 of the original volume. Then, 5 mM glucose (or 13C labeled glucose) was added to the culture, and samples were collected for about 7 d. Samples were analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS.
HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of cultures
After addition of an equal volume of alcohol, all samples taken from the cultures were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter. The samples were analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS. Compounds were identified and quantified by comparing the observed retention times, peak areas, and mass chromatograms with the corresponding chemical standards. The samples were analyzed by HPLC using an Agilent 1200 series instrument with an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm) and an Ultimate 3000 photodiode array detector maintained at 25 °C. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1 with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) as the mobile phase, using the following gradient: 0 min, 95% solvent A + 5% solvent B; 8 min, 20% solvent A + 80% solvent B; 10 min, 80% solvent A + 20% solvent B; and 11 min, 95% solvent A + 5% solvent B. Naringenin and tyrosine were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm; bisdemethoxycurcumin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 425 nm; p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, resveratrol, and trans-cinnamic acid were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 320 nm. The retention times of the eight above-mentioned compounds were 7.18, 3.71, 8.47, 5.50, 4.89, 5.67, 6.34, and 6.73 min, respectively. After separation by HPLC using the above-mentioned methods, LC-MS was performed using an Agilent UPLC-TOF MS system. Negative ion data for the standard compounds were as follows: p-coumaric acid, m/z = 163.0401; caffeic acid, m/z = 179.0350; ferulic acid, m/z = 193.0506; resveratrol, m/z = 227.0714; naringenin, m/z = 271.0612; bisdemethoxycurcumin, m/z = 307.0976; tyrosine, m/z = 180.0677. The data shown in this study were generated from at least triplicate independent experiments and analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and IBM SPSS Statistics.

 	Fig. 1  Synthetic pathways for de novo biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids from CO2 in autotrophic Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. The colored structures with lines show artificial biosynthetic pathways that are introduced into the engineered S. elongatus PCC7942. The chemicals with lines in red represent the synthetic pathway for phenylpropanoic acids. Purple chemicals with lines indicate synthetic pathways for polyketides. These valuable phenylpropanoids are widespread in plants. Typically, phenylpropanoic acids, resveratrol, naringenin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin are particularly rich in Eucommia ulmoides, Vitis vinifera, Ginkgo biloba, and Curcuma longa, respectively. Many other plant natural products that might be synthesized by this photosynthetic platform are also shown in the small gray frame. Cerulenin can limit the amount of malonyl-CoA lost for the synthesis of fatty acids. Abbreviations: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. All parts of this figure were drawn by Jun Ni.	 

 	Fig. 2  Construction of recombinant strains. (A) Schematic representation of the recombination procedure used to integrate genes into the Neutral Site I (NSI) of the S. elongatus chromosome. specR (spectinomycin resistance gene), Ptrc (promoter trc), 5′-NSI (upstream region of Neutral Site I), 3′-NSI (downstream region of Neutral Site I), and TrrnB (terminator). (B) List of engineered strains with different combinations of overexpressed genes. 4cl::sts (encoding the fusion protein of 4CL and STS), 4cl::chs (encoding the fusion protein of 4CL and CHS) and 4cl::cus (encoding the fusion protein of 4CL and CUS).	 

 	Fig. 3  Time course of p-coumaric acid production in recombinant strains. Time indicates days after induction. (A) p-Coumaric acid production and (B) growth curves of recombinant Synechococcus strains under continuous-light culture and rest culture. (C) p-Coumaric acid production (colored columns) and growth curves (colored lines) of recombinant Synechococcus strains under continuous-light and rest culture. (D) The cultures were continuously aerated with CO2-enriched air (5%, v/v) using a simple bubble column. The growth curves (colored lines) and p-coumaric acid production (colored columns) of Synechococcus strains under various culture conditions. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3). The “-light” means strains were grown in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under constant light exposure (100 μE s−1 m−2); “-light/dark” means a 12 h light–12 h dark growth regime (simulating the natural day and night cycle). Effects of IPTG on (E) the transcription level of heterologous genes and (F) production of p-coumaric acid. All values are relative to the expression levels of the corresponding rnpB gene (the housekeeping gene, whose transcription product is the RNA component of RNase P), which were set at 100. Pink and green columns indicate the expression levels of the sam8 and aroG gene, respectively. Results are presented as the average of six repetitions (triplicate reverse transcription reactions from two independent total RNA samples).	 

 	Fig. 4  Production of phenylpropanoids. Synechococcus sp. strains were cultured in BG-11 medium at 30 °C under continuous lighting with an illumination intensity of 100 μE s−1 m−2. The maximum production of (A) phenylpropanoic acids and (B) plant polyketides by recombinant strains. The “+” means cerulenin was added at a concentration of 20 mg l−1 after the OD730 reached 0.5–0.6; “−” means no cerulenin was added. The time required to obtain the highest yield is also shown, which indicates days after induction. The sign ‘—’ indicates the compound not detected in HPLC analysis. (C) The maximum plant phenylpropanoid production by engineered S. elongatus strains. The “+” means IPTG was added at a concentration of 0.5 mM after the OD730 reached 0.5–0.6; “−” means no IPTG was added. (D) Maximum production of phenylpropanoids under dark conditions. “N source (−)” and “P source (−)” indicate that NaNO3 or K2HPO4 was removed from the BG11 medium, respectively. “Day” indicates the time of maximum titer. The data are representative of at least three independent experiments, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. Error bars indicate SD (n = 3).	 

 	Fig. 5  Proposed unique cyanobacterial system for sustainably producing plant natural products. The multifunctional and intracellular membrane system in cyanobacteria is called the thylakoid (similar to thylakoid in chloroplast). Here is a diagram of the thylakoid membrane and complexes involved in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Red balls mean the plant cytochrome P450s (including 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase), which are located in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria (S. elongatus PCC7942). Abbreviations: G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Fd, ferredoxin; PC, plastocyanin; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; PQ, plastoquinone; Cytb6/f, cytochrome b6-f complex. All parts of this figure were drawn by Jun Ni.
