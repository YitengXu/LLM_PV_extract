    , Accepted 1st March 2021First published on 2nd March 2021AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on ZnO photoanodes have, despite extensive research, lagged behind cells based on TiO2, which is due to generally lower open-circuit voltages VOC and fill factors. Here, DSSCs have been prepared using Mg-doped ZnO (MZO) photoanodes based on nanoparticles, thin films or ZnO–MZO core–shell-type nanoparticles with varying Mg-concentration. The cells were studied in detailed photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence experiments. It was confirmed that VOC was significantly increased by Mg-doping. A clear influence of the Mg-concentration was also revealed on the transport and recombination of electrons in MZO, leading to a higher cell performance at low and lower cell performance at high concentrations of Mg in MZO. Nanoparticles with a pure ZnO core and an MZO shell offered a way to lower the influence of increased transport resistance in MZO and to capitalize on the significantly improved VOC.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) present a low-cost solution for the conversion of sunlight into electrical energy.1 Despite the rather limited overall efficiency of DSSCs under standard AM1.5G conditions and in view of a significantly higher efficiency at lower light intensities, they present an alternative as sustainable and renewable energy sources because they do not require high purity materials or high temperature preparation steps, leading to low energy payback times.2,3 As a working principle, DSSCs rely on a dye molecule as a light absorber, which injects an electron from its excited state into an electron transport layer (ETL). Traditionally, the wide band gap n-type semiconductor TiO2 has been used as an ETL but alternative semiconductors like ZnO or SnO2 have been explored extensively, which is due to their favourable optical and electrical properties.4 In particular, ZnO has been in the focus as an ETL in multiple solar cell concepts motivated by its high electron mobility.5,6 While this can result in higher photocurrents, ZnO-based DSSCs generally exhibit a significantly lower open-circuit voltage VOC and fill factor FF compared to TiO2-based cells, which result in a lower power conversion efficiency (PCE).7,8 This difference is further increased by a high degree of optimization of cell concepts towards TiO2 regarding the structure of the adsorbed dye and the composition of the redox electrolyte. Additives to the redox electrolyte such as lithium (Li+) and tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) are typically used to influence the position of the conduction band edge ECB of the semiconductor leading to an increased VOC.9–12 However, recent studies have revealed that the influence of such additives is significantly lower on ZnO than on TiO2 photoanodes.8,13
The cationic substitution of metal ions in ZnO has emerged as an alternative way of influencing the position of the conduction band and improving its photovoltaic performance.14 The incorporation of Mg2+ ions was very successful, reaching solubility limits of up to 33%, depending on the growth technique used, enabled by the almost identical ionic radii of Zn2+(0.57 Å) and Mg2+(0.60 Å).15,16 The resulting MgxZn1−xO (MZO) retains the Wurtzite crystal structure typical for ZnO at the desired increased band gap, and is tuneable by the Mg-concentration in the lattice. In consequence, MZO has already been used in various photovoltaic cell concepts, such as bulk heterojunction organic solar cells,17 inverted polymer solar cells,18 perovskite solar cells,19,20 quantum dot solar cells,21 as a buffer layer for CdTe-solar cells22 and also in DSSCs with, however, photoanodes of strongly differing morphology, which hindered a direct correlation of cell properties with changes in the electrical characteristics caused by Mg-doping.23–25 For DSSCs as well as for organic or polymer solar cells, the desired increase in VOC was observed, related to an upward shift ΔECB of the conduction band position and of the quasi Fermi energy EF,n. Furthermore, an increased short-circuit current JSC and FF for concentrations of Mg2+ of 5% to 10% but a significant decrease in photocurrent for higher concentrations of Mg2+ were observed for all aforementioned types of solar cell devices. The increase in JSC for small concentrations of Mg was discussed as being caused by an increased electron mobility in MZO for low Mg-concentrations.21,26,27 For quantum dot solar cells it was predicted that an increased electron mobility would promote faster transport through the semiconductor layer, reduce recombination and enhance charge extraction.28 Explicit measurements of the electron mobility in MZO using the Hall effect or space-charge limited currents on electron-only devices showed an increased mobility for Mg-concentrations of up to 10%, with a decrease for higher Mg-concentrations, falling even below the level of pure ZnO.26,27 These findings fit well with a reported increase in the series resistance in polymer-oxide hybrid solar cell devices for Mg-concentrations above 10%.18 Furthermore, an observed decrease in the photocatalytic activity of highly doped MZO in the decomposition of methylene blue was discussed as being due to increased recombination as a consequence of the calculated formation of shallow Mg2+ acceptor levels below the conduction band edge.29
In this work, these scattered results of the successful application of MZO in different types of solar cells are utilized to systematically establish an alternative path to increase the open-circuit voltage VOC and the fill factor FF of ZnO-based DSSCs. We report the preparation and characterization of three types of MZO-based photoanodes. Thin-film (TF) photoanodes were prepared via a sol–gel process to provide a direct comparison to earlier studies of organic, polymer, perovskite and dye-sensitized solar cells. To establish a high surface area required in DSSCs for achieving a high dye-loading and, hence, good light harvesting, nanoparticulate (NP) photoanodes of MZO were also prepared, based on a different wet-chemical synthesis. Significantly enhanced VOC and FF resulting from Mg2+-integration into ZnO was shown for DSSCs using both these approaches that in part surpass the values of TiO2-based DSSCs, even without applying commonly used additives. Furthermore, ZnO–MZO core–shell (CS) type photoanodes were prepared to combine the best of both, i.e. the high mobility of a pure ZnO core and the higher VOC established by an MZO shell, and, thereby, increase the PCE. The influence of Mg2+-doping on JSC and strategies to further improve the cells are discussed based on detailed photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence results.
Experimental
Synthesis of MZO photoanodes and DSSC preparation
TF MZO photoanodes were prepared by spin-coating (2000 rpm, 60 s) a solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Znac2) and magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (Mgac2) in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) with molar ratios of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 25% Mg onto glass substrates coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Kaivo, <15 Ω cm−2). 0.75 M solutions of ethanol amine and of total metal acetate in 2ME were heated to 50 °C and stirred on a hotplate for 15 min. After cooling, the solutions were filtered by a 0.45 μm pore size syringe filter.17 The substrates were precleaned by subsequent ultra-sonification in RBS solution (Roth), acetone (Roth) and isopropanol (Roth) for 15 min each. The resulting thin films were thermally annealed in air at 300 °C for 15 min.
For the preparation of MZO nanoparticles, Znac2 and Mgac2 were dissolved in ethanol (0.3 M of metal acetate) in molar ratios of 0, 5, 10 and 20% Mg. Each solution was heated to 60 °C and an ethanolic solution of oxalic acid dihydrate was added dropwise under constant stirring until a concentration of 0.45 M was reached. The solution was left stirring under reflux for 1 h, before being centrifuged (6000 rpm, 10 min). The resulting white precipitate was dried in an oven in air at 100 °C overnight before calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. The resulting nanoparticles were formulated into a screen-printing paste by addition of terpineol and ethyl cellulose but without the addition of acetic acid as described in ref. 30. The paste was screen-printed onto a cleaned FTO-coated glass substrate as a circle with a radius of 3 mm, followed by heating to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and leaving it at that temperature for 60 min. For the preparation of CS-type films of MZO, 10 μl of the solutions used for the preparation of TF-MZO were drop cast onto NP photoanodes of pure ZnO, before being thermally annealed as described for TF above. All chemicals and solvents were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich, unless mentioned otherwise, without further purification. All photoanodes were sensitized by immersion in a 0.5 mM solution of the indoline dye DN216 (Chemicrea) and 0.2 mM lithocholic acid in 1:1 (volume) acetonitrile:tert-butanol for 15 min. Counter-electrodes for the DSSCs were prepared by drop-casting a 5 mM solution of chloroplatinic acid in ethanol onto a cleaned FTO-substrate and subsequently heating to 400 °C for 15 min. Sensitized photoanodes and counter-electrodes were mechanically connected and sealed by a hot-melting Surlyn® spacer (25 μm). The redox electrolyte consisted of 0.5 M PMII (3-propyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide) and 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile. The cell was filled with this electrolyte through predrilled holes in the counter electrode and sealed using Surlyn® foil and a coverslip glass.
Sample characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TF-samples on glass substrates (X’Pert Pro MRD) and the NP-powders (Rigaku Ultima III) were investigated via Cu-Kα radiation.
Optical absorption spectra of the TF-samples on glass substrates were measured in transmission (Lambda 365, PerkinElmer) and the band gaps were determined from Tauc-plots. The powder samples were studied by diffuse reflection (Solid-Spec 3700, Shimadzu) using a BaSO4 reference and the absorption coefficients were calculated using the Kubelka–Munk function. UV-Vis spectra of the sensitized photoanodes were measured in reflection using an Ulbricht sphere (getProbe 5393 SET, getAMO) and a Tec5 diode array spectrometer.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Zeiss MERLIN microscope with an acceleration voltage of 3 kV and an emission current of 100 pA. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed at 10 kV and 2 μA (X-Max 50 mm2, Oxford Instruments). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out using a standard streak camera setup. A tuneable pulsed 100 fs, 80 MHz repetition rate Ti:Sapphire laser was used as the excitation source. The output wavelength of the laser was 845 nm and the pulses were frequency-doubled to 442.5 nm. A microscope objective was used to focus the laser onto the samples. The average laser power in front of the objective was set to 1 mW to prevent bleaching effects.
Photoelectrochemical characterization was carried out using an IM6 potentiostat and a CIMPSpcs system (Zahner Elektrik). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured in the dark or under illumination using an LS0106 xenon arc lamp with an LSZ189 AM 1.5G filter with the intensity set to 100 mW cm−2 on a calibrated ML-020VM pyranometer (EKO Instruments). EQE measurements were performed under illumination by a white light source and a monochromator (TLS02, Zahner Elektrik) at a fixed intensity of 0.1 mW cm−2 on the sample. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an amplitude of 0.01 V in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.3 Hz under illumination by a 510 nm LED with intensities ranging from 0.5 to 15 mW cm−2 while the DSSCs were kept at open-circuit bias. The spectra were fitted with RelaxIS 3 (rhd instruments) using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Results and discussion
SEM images in top-view as well as in cross-section show the mesoporous structure of the NP-type (Fig. 1a and d) and CS-type (Fig. 1b and e) photoanodes. Nanoparticles with a size of 10 to 40 nm are partially agglomerated into larger needle-like structures. A loose packing of these needles leads to the formation of pores across the entire film with about 100 nm diameter, favorable for the accessibility by the redox shuttle in DSSCs. The presence of smaller open volume between adjacent nanoparticles ensures a high overall surface area, needed for the adsorption of a sufficient amount of dye. Cross-section images also served to determine the film thickness. NP- as well as CS-type samples exhibited a largely homogeneous thickness of (3.0 ± 0.2) μm. SEM images of the TF-type samples (Fig. 1c and f) revealed a much smaller particle size below 10 nm that is further decreased for higher Mg-concentrations (Fig. S5, ESI†). The TF films completely covered the substrate at a thickness of typically 20 nm with root-like structures of up to 200 nm diameter on top.23 As a combination between NP- and TF-type, the CS-type layers show the agglomerates of the NP-films covered with much smaller sized nanoparticles (Fig. 1b) like those of the TF-samples. However, the cross-section image (Fig. 1e) reveals that parts of the ZnO-nanoparticles near the bottom of the films remain uncovered by the MZO shell.

Top views are seen in (a–c) while (d–f) show cross-sections obtained after breaking of the samples with the thickness (obtained from a variety of similar images) of the active film marked in blue and of the FTO substrate marked in red. 
The crystal structures of the ZnO and MZO nanoparticles and thin films were studied by XRD measurements, which are presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, S3 (ESI†). The overview for MZO NPs of different Mg-contents in Fig. 2a only exhibits the diffraction peaks of the hexagonal wurtzite of ZnO. No additional phase was detected after the introduction of Mg into the crystal lattice, indicating that the Mg2+ ions were fully integrated. The detailed spectra of the (100) (Fig. 2b) and (002) (Fig. 2c) peaks revealed expected shifts of the peak position towards lower and higher angles, respectively.

The calculated lattice constants show an increase in a- and a decrease in the c-direction (see Table S1, ESI†) and fit previous reports very well.15,31 The TF-samples (Fig. S2, ESI†) showed equivalent results, proving that nanoparticulate and thin film MZO photoanodes of varying Mg-content were successfully fabricated.
In order to study the effect of Mg2+ incorporation on the band gap of ZnO, optical absorption of the MZO NPs and TFs was measured and is presented in the form of Tauc-plots characteristic for direct band gaps, allowing the determination of the band gap (Table S2, ESI†). Both in the case of thin films (Fig. 3a) and of nanoparticles (Fig. S4, ESI†) a significant increase in the band gap of MZO with increasing Mg-concentration is revealed (Fig. 3b). A linear, almost identical increase was obtained for both kinds of prepared MZO up to a Mg-content of 20%, but saturation occurred at higher concentrations. Similar increases in the band gap have previously been reported for MZO.15,18,23 The stagnation of the band gap for Mg-contents higher than 20% was reported to be caused by reaching the solubility limit of Mg2+ in ZnO.32

It was previously assumed that the increase in the band gap directly affects the position of the conduction band edge ECB, while the valence band edge EVB was found to stay practically unaffected.23,33,34 However, recent reports indicated that ECB only exhibits a small shift in position, and the increased band gap is mainly caused by a lower EVB.26 Nevertheless, a shift in the Fermi energy level EF of the semiconductor towards the conduction band was reported, similar in size to the increase of the band gap.17,21 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the increase of the band gap by the incorporation of Mg into the ZnO lattice by substitution of Zn up to 5% Mg and by interstitial doping above 5% Mg, lifting the energy of the conduction band, introducing new energy levels below the conduction band and raising the charge carrier concentration.29 Such additional levels may very well give rise to the increased Urbach tail as indicated in Fig. 3a and are discussed below in the context of the observed increased recombination.

I–V characteristics were measured for all three photoanode types sensitized with the indoline dye DN 216 and are presented in Fig. 4 and Table 1. All cell types exhibit the same trend of increased VOC and FF with higher Mg-concentration, remedying the serious shortcomings of ZnO-based DSSCs significantly and proving the validity of the strategy outlined above. This increase of the VOC can be well explained by the increase of the band gap and the related shift in the quasi Fermi-level energy EF,n of the semiconductor. The measured values of up to 777 mV for the NP-cell type and 760 mV for the TF-cell type with 20% Mg-concentration are among the highest ever reported VOC for the commonly used iodide redox couple and surpass the voltages reported in high-efficiency TiO2-based DSSCs.35

The increase of VOC with the Mg-content, however, is generally lower for CS cells compared to the other cell types, most likely caused by partial access of the electrolyte to the underlying undoped ZnO. The alternative assumption of an EF,n shifted from the position in the corresponding TF samples would require Mg diffusion from the shell into the underlying undoped core, which was observed to occur above 800 °C only,36 a temperature considerably higher than the present 300 °C.
For higher Mg-concentrations, a general trend of decreasing JSC was observed, which leads to strongly decreased PCE. This decrease in JSC with increased Mg-content was seen in earlier reports, lacks detailed understanding and is studied in detail below. It is seen that this decrease is less significant for the CS-type cells compared to the NP- and TF-type cells which indicates the major benefit of the CS-type cells for higher Mg-contents and leads to their higher PCE.
Similar to the results reported for other solar cell types,17,23,26 an initial increase in JSC for a Mg-concentration of 5% can be observed for all cell types, leading to overall higher PCE of cells with up to 10% Mg. The CS-type cells generally exhibit the highest PCE of all cell types for all concentrations of Mg, which is due to a generally higher JSC resulting from the highest light absorption, also when compared to the NP-type samples (Fig. 4a). Consequently, similar values were determined for the internal quantum efficiency (QE, Table S3, ESI†) for NP and CS cells at low Mg-concentration. TF cells, despite high QE showed low currents because of a small amount of adsorbed dye.

Fig. 5 shows the optical absorption spectra of all photoanodes studied. In contrast to the results shown by Kim et al.,23 no clear dependence of light absorbance on the Mg-concentration of the present photoanodes can be detected. Since the absorbance is proportional to the amount of dye adsorbed on the semiconductor surface and since all presented spectra show an almost identical shape, we conclude that the adsorption of the dye to the surface has not changed by the addition of Mg in any of the presently chosen methods of synthesis. While the apparent absorption peak of DN216 on MZO for the TF-photoanodes (see Fig. 5b) shows an increase for increasing Mg-concentrations, it can be assumed that this is caused by varying degrees of light scattering because of the almost constant difference between the absorption maximum at 540 nm and the minimum at around 450 nm for all Mg-concentrations.
 Fig. 5  UV-vis spectra of the photoanodes sensitized with DN216. (a) CS- and NP-type photoanodes show no dependence of dye adsorption on Mg-concentration. (b) TF-type photoanodes show increased light-scattering with increasing Mg-concentration. 
The increase in light scattering is probably caused by a decrease in particle size with an increasing Mg-concentration (Fig. S5, ESI†). Light scattering is far less pronounced for the CS-type and NP-type photoanodes (Fig. 2a). Both these types also show no correlation between dye loading and Mg-content and show a significantly higher loading than the TF-type photoanodes, with the CS-type samples showing the highest dye loading. Since all CS samples were prepared from the same 0% NP, it can be concluded that the CS-coating process increased the surface area of the photoanodes, leading to a higher dye loading. An increased surface area of the CS films is confirmed by a direct comparison of SEM images of NP, CS and TF samples (Fig. 2).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) under short circuit conditions (Fig. 6 and Fig. S6, S7, ESI†) directly follows the absorption spectra of the adsorbed dye for all cells studied. The EQE in DSSCs is given by the product of light-harvesting efficiency ηlh, electron injection efficiency ηinj, dye regeneration efficiency ηreg and electron collection efficiency ηcol: EQE = ηlhηinjηregηcol(1)
 Fig. 6  Measured EQE spectra (dots) and fits according to ref. 37 (lines) of NP-type photoanodes of varying Mg-concentration. The measured absorption spectra of the pure ZnO NP-type photoanode (dashed-dotted line) has been included for comparison. 
In order to analyse the significant differences observed in the measured EQE spectra of the NP-type photoanodes (Fig. 6) and CS-type photoanodes (Fig. S7, ESI†) with different Mg-concentrations, ηlh can be assumed to be constant within a given series NP or CS because of widely identical absorbance spectra within each series (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, ηreg can be assumed constant among the samples since identical energy levels and concentrations of dye and electrolyte components were used. As seen below in the photoluminescence measurements, ηinj in a first approximation can also be assumed to be constant for all cells. Therefore, the observed differences in EQE are caused by different ηcol values. In order to study ηcol, we determined the corresponding electron diffusion length LNP and LCS (Table 2) for the NP- and CS-type photoanodes, respectively, by a model using absorbance data and film thickness (fits in Fig. 6 and Fig. S7, ESI†).37 The measured spectra are well fit by the model, aside from fluctuations in EQE around 470 nm, which, however, did not appear in the absorption spectra and are probably caused by fluctuations in effective illumination intensity (interference, scattering) in this range. High L was found for pure ZnO and 5% MZO, while the 10% and 20% MZO samples showed a significant decrease in both LNP and LCS. The EQE data for the TF-type photoanodes (Fig. S6, ESI†) could not be fitted, which is due to the large errors caused by difficulties to accurately determine the film thickness and by the strong influence of light scattering on the optical absorbance spectra.

The electron diffusion length L is closely related to the recombination resistance Rrec and the transport resistance Rtr38–40 (2)
The decreased L (Table 2) and, thereby, a decreased ηcol, EQE and PCE (Table 1) found for higher Mg-concentrations in MZO hints at decreased Rrec or increased Rtr for increasing Mg-content. The significantly higher LCS compared to LNP at 10% and 20% MZO, therefore, hint at suppressed recombination or improved conductivity by utilizing pure ZnO as the core, leading to less-attenuated JSC and PCE for higher Mg-content in CS- compared to NP-electrodes. The integrated EQE resulted in JSC 5 to 15% lower than the values measured in the I–V curves, which is reasonable because of missing contributions below 430 nm in EQE (Fig. 6 and Fig. S6, S7, ESI†) as opposed to the AM 1.5 spectrum.
Intensity-dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in order to determine Rrec and Rtr quantitatively. The Nyquist-plots shown in Fig. 7 show an overall smaller impedance for the MZO with 5% Mg when compared to pure ZnO, for NP as well as CS-type cells. For larger Mg content (20%), the overall impedance increases. Furthermore, the shape of the central semicircle, dominated by properties of the photoanode (Rrec and/or Rtr) changes significantly with Mg-content, towards a strongly asymmetric shape for increasing Mg-content. These differences occur to a smaller extent for the CS- compared to the NP-type cells, indicating significantly suppressed impact of an increasing resistance in the CS-photoanodes. When trying to fit the curves with an equivalent circuit typically used for ZnO-based DSSCs,41 we realized that this model did not fit all measured cells. For the photoanodes with 10% or 20% Mg-concentration, the overall resistance increased and the semicircle developed an asymmetric shape, especially in the high-frequency regime (Fig. 7a, inset) where a 45°-slope appears, indicative of a Gerischer impedance.42 This phenomenon can normally be observed in TiO2-based DSSCs and occurs when the electron transport-time τtr exceeds the electron life time τn because of a high transport resistance Rtr.38,43 Such influence of Rtr obviously is smaller in the CS-type photoanodes with their core of pure ZnO since the asymmetric deformation of the semicircle is smaller. We utilized Rrec/Rtr determined from eqn (2) and the data of L (Table 2) to fit the measured EIS spectra upon addition of a Gerischer-type impedance (Fig. S1, ESI†). A fixed ratio Rrec/Rtr is needed for such a fit since the linear dependency of both values on each other would otherwise hinder a quantitative analysis.43,44 The corresponding capacitance was too large to assign it to a chemical capacitance but might represent a superposition with additional contributions by, e.g., space charges in the cells.
 Fig. 7  Nyquist-plot of EIS measurements of (a) NP-type photoanode and (b) CS-type photoanode at 300 mW cm−2 illumination by a 510 nm LED. The inset shows the high-frequency region of the measurement. 
The values for Rtr and Rrec extracted from the fit of the EIS data (Table 3) show the necessity of considering changes in both Rtr and Rrec to explain the present findings as opposed to earlier studies using either a decreased electron mobility26–28 or an increased recombination probability23,29 for MZO with a high content of Mg. Rtr decreases for both types of photoanodes from pure ZnO towards 5%, well in line with earlier findings of an increased mobility.26–28 A significantly increased Rtr was found for higher concentrations of Mg, as also seen in those earlier studies. The Rtr found for the CS-type photoanodes using the pure ZnO core show a much smaller increase compared to the NP-type photoanodes, explaining the much lower drop in L (Table 2), JSC and PCE (Table 1) of the CS-type compared to the NP-type as well as TF-type cells, both of which rely on conduction in fully doped MZO. Simultaneously, Rrec of NP- as well as CS-type photoanodes decreases monotonically with the increase in Mg-concentration leading to the observed optimum.

Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) was measured at open-circuit under varied light intensity to obtain a measure of the effective electron lifetime τn.45,46 To compensate the obtained values of VOC for different positions of the EF,n and obtain values of τn independent of the occupation of electronic states in the semiconductor and, hence, characteristic for the rate constant of recombination for the different photoanode materials, we used the observed change of Eg (Fig. 3 and Fig. S8, ESI†) relative to pure ZnO used as in ref. 17 and 21. Experimental IMVS results are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The effective electron lifetimes τn for all three types of photoanodes are compared at VOC = 400 mV (Table 4) All types exhibit the same trend of a monotonic decrease of τn with Mg-content. Such decrease of τn is expected for an increased rate constant of recombination with an increasing Mg-concentration corresponding to the decreasing Rrec as seen in the ESI† (see Table 3) and is also in good accordance with DFT simulations that predicted interstitial Mg2+ to function as recombination centres for electrons.29

Subsequent to the initial fast injection typically in the sub-ps range, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured in the ps time range to study the quenching of dye luminescence by electron transfer from a relaxed excited state to energy levels in the photoanodes with different Mg-contents. As reported before, the density of accessible acceptor states in the semiconductor can be probed.4,47 Electrons in the relaxed excited state of the dye are most sensitive to changes in the concentration of accessible acceptor states at a given energy. In similar experiments, an enhanced charge extraction in quantum dot and perovskite solar cells was found for MZO-photoanodes and attributed to a faster electron transport at a Mg concentration of 10%.26,28,48 In the present experiments (Fig. 8 and Fig. S10, ESI†), we found emission from the excited state of the dye at monotonically increasing intensity with increasing Mg-content and, hence, a monotonically increasing efficient lifetime of the excited state, indicating a decrease in electron transfer rate from the relaxed excited state of the dye to the semiconductor. A bi-exponential fit was used to determine the decay time constants from the measured TRPL spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†). The shorter time constants of about 10 ps were attributed to the instrument response time and fit the instrument specifications very well.
 Fig. 8  Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of NP-type DSSCs at varying Mg-concentrations. 
The longer time constants τPL are shown in Table 5 for all three types of photoanodes and show a systematic increase with the Mg-content in MZO. Differences in electron transport or recombination can be excluded as the origin, since both occur in the millisecond- rather than ps-range after injection.4,49 Instead, it can be assumed that the increased efficient life times are caused by an upward shift of the quasi-Fermi level (Fig. 9). We reported previously, that the quenching of the relaxed excited state of the dye can be significantly slowed down by applying a negative bias to the photoanode, simulating an upward shift in EF,n.50,51 Since similar characteristics resulted from the present experiments, we conclude that an upward shift in EF,n was achieved by doping of ZnO with Mg2+, leading to the observed increase in efficient lifetimes. However, because the electron transfer from the relaxed excited states, representing the slowest component of electron injection, is still completed within 35 to 190 ps for all types of photoanodes and all Mg-concentrations, fast injection in the sub-ps time regime from the initially excited dye into the semiconductor can be assumed for all present electrodes as generally found for dye-sensitized photoanodes.52–55

 Fig. 9  Use of differently doped MZO as ETL in DSSCs. The Mg-content is shown and the semiconductor energy levels shifted according to the observed change in EF,n. Observed differences in electron mobility are shown by differently long horizontal arrows and observed differences in recombination are shown by the intensity of the dashed arrows. 
Conclusions
The performance of DSSCs was shown to be greatly influenced by using MZO-based photoanodes instead of pure ZnO. Significantly enhanced VOC was obtained depending on the Mg-concentration as a consequence of the systematic tuning of the position of the quasi-Fermi energy EF,n in MZO. For high Mg-concentrations, however, smaller JSC led to a decreased performance. Unlike earlier findings, the present extended selection of characterization methods revealed the relevance of systematic variations in both electron transport as well as electron recombination caused by Mg-doping of ZnO in order to understand the observed differences in the photocurrent. These findings are summarized in Fig. 9. For intermediate Mg-contents of about 5%, optimum cell performance was found, caused by increased VOC and widely maintained or even slightly increased JSC. A decreased transport resistance led to an increased electron lifetime and supported the high current, despite a slightly increased recombination rate constant caused by additional trap-levels. Detailed variation of the Mg-content in the range below 10% will yield the respective optimum for a given device application, depending on the specific relevance of recombination relative to collection. Furthermore, the core–shell-type approach has shown the potential to attenuate the effects of decreased mobility in highly doped MZO by using a pure ZnO core, thereby preserving a larger current and providing the increased voltage for higher Mg-concentrations. Such an approach might also help to increase the success in applications of MZO in other solar cell types such as organic or perovskite solar cells. Finally, the increased chemical stability of MZO compared to ZnO as recently seen in perovskite solar cells19 may also bear some potential to increase the stability of MZO-based DSSCs compared to ZnO-based ones.
