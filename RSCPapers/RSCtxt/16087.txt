    , Accepted 28th May 2017First published on 30th May 2017AbstractTrivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have been extensively used as emitters in short-wave infrared (SWIR; 900–1700 nm) photoluminescence for many advanced applications. Herein, we report that some Ln3+ ions can also act as efficient emitters for SWIR persistent luminescence. Using Ca2SnO4 as a host, we achieved strong SWIR persistent luminescence from a group of six Ln3+ ions, Nd3+, Pr3+, Yb3+, Ho3+, Tm3+ and Er3+, with the emission wavelengths tunable from ∼900 nm to ∼1550 nm. A direct relationship between the depth of electron traps and the ionic radii of Ln3+ ions was obtained. This study greatly expands the field of persistent luminescence in the SWIR spectral region, and the Ln3+ ion-activated Ca2SnO4 SWIR persistent phosphors are expected to have promising applications in a variety of areas such as biomedical imaging and night-vision surveillance.
Introduction
Persistent luminescence is a self-sustained luminescence phenomenon, where a phosphor can continuously emit light for an appreciable time (from minutes to hours) after the excitation is ceased.1 The persistent luminescence phenomenon has found numerous applications in a variety of areas ranging from night-vision surveillance to bioimaging.2 For instance, green-emitting SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ persistent phosphors3 are widely used as security signs, emergency route signs, and traffic signage. Cr3+-activated persistent phosphors emitting in the near-infrared region (NIR; ∼700–900 nm) are proven to be promising imaging probes in bioimaging.4–6 Although extensive research and applications have been performed in the visible and NIR persistent phosphors, in recent years, there are increasing demands for persistent phosphors emitting in the longer-wavelength short-wave infrared (SWIR; ∼900–1700 nm) spectral region; this is because the SWIR light has some unique spectral features that are highly desired for some advanced applications in the military, anti-counterfeiting, and bioimaging. For example, for military applications, the SWIR light is more covert as compared to the NIR light and cannot be easily detected via common techniques (such as night vision goggles).7 Moreover, the SWIR light has high penetration power in extreme environments (such as haze, fog, smoke, and dust).8 For bioimaging, the SWIR light corresponds to the second biological window (∼1000–1400 nm),9 enabling ultra-sensitive, deep-tissue bioimaging. Contrary to the extensively studied visible and NIR persistent phosphors, the research and development of SWIR persistent phosphors is generally lacking, and only a few SWIR persistent phosphors have been reported in recent years.10–12
A good SWIR persistent phosphor should consist of a suitable emitter (i.e., luminescent ions) capable of emitting SWIR light and a proper host capable of creating appropriate traps that can store excitation energy during the excitation and release the stored charges to the emitter after the excitation.13 For SWIR photoluminescence, the most notable group of emitters whose ions are capable of SWIR emission is the lanthanide (Ln) series with the atomic numbers from 57 to 71.7 Trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have been widely used as photoluminescence centres in many advanced applications ranging from solid-state lasers to fiber amplifiers, solar energy conversion, and bioimaging.14–17 For instance, Nd3+, Yb3+, and Er3+ are common dopants in solid-state lasers;18,19 Er3+ and Nd3+ are common active species in fiber amplifiers;20,21 Ln3+–Yb3+ doubly doped quantum cutting phosphors are expected to help in increasing the efficiency of Si solar cells;22 and Er3+-, Ho3+-, Tm3+-, or Pr3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles are frequently used in bioimaging.23 Motivated by the strong desire of expanding the unique SWIR emission capability of Ln3+ ions in persistent luminescence, we conducted extensive research to develop Ln3+-activated SWIR persistent phosphors. As a result of this research, we recently discovered that Yb3+ ion could act as an excellent emitter for SWIR persistent luminescence at around 1000 nm when doped in MgGeO3 and some gallate-based hosts (e.g., LiGa5O8).24 Herein, we further report that besides Yb3+ ions, five other Ln3+ ions, including Er3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+ ions, also exhibit SWIR persistent luminescence when doped in appropriate hosts. Particularly, all these six Ln3+ ions emit strong SWIR persistent luminescence in orthorhombic-structured Ca2SnO4, as the schematic energy diagrams of possible electron transfer processes for SWIR persistent emissions show in Fig. 1. In this study, we report the remarkable SWIR persistent luminescence properties of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, or Tm) persistent phosphors.

Experimental
Materials and synthesis
The Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) SWIR persistent phosphors were fabricated using a high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of CaCO3 and SnO2 powders and 0.1 mol% Ln2O3 (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, or Tm) powder (the corresponding Ln3+ concentration is 0.2 mol%) were thoroughly mixed and ground to form a homogeneous mixture using an agate mortar. The mixed powder was prefired at 900 °C in air for 2 h. The prefired powder was again ground to a fine powder that was then pressed into preformed discs (∼15 mm in diameter and ∼1 mm in thickness) using a 16-ton dry pressing machine. The discs were then sintered at 1370 °C in air for 3 h to form solid ceramic discs.
Characterizations
The crystal structures of the as-synthesized Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors were investigated using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The spectral properties, including the photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra, decay curves, and persistent luminescence emission and excitation spectra of the phosphors were obtained using a Horiba FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450 W xenon arc lamp, a R928P photomultiplier tube (250–850 nm) and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled DSS-IGA020L InGaAs detector (800–1600 nm). All spectra were corrected for the optical system responses. Appropriate optical filters were used to avoid stray light in spectral measurements. The thermoluminescence curves were obtained using a homemade measurement setup (temperature range, 20–300 °C; heating rate, 4 °C s−1). Before all the spectral measurements, the samples were heat-treated in a muffle oven at 400 °C for 20 min to completely empty the traps. A 4 W 254 nm UV lamp was also used to charge the samples.
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction measurements show that the doping of a trace amount of Ln3+ ions does not change the orthorhombic structure of the Ca2SnO4 host (ESI,† Fig. S1).

Fig. 2 shows the normalized photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra of the six Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors at room temperature. The photoluminescence excitation spectra for all the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ materials cover both the ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral regions, but have different profiles, which are due to the different spectroscopic characteristics of Ln3+ ions in the Ca2SnO4 host. Under the excitation of UV or visible light, the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors exhibit strong photoluminescence in the 750–1550 nm wavelength range (1550 nm is the measurement limit of our DSS-IGA020L InGaAs detector), which mostly falls in the SWIR spectral region. All the doped Ln3+ ions show their characteristic transitions within the 4f electron configuration in the Ca2SnO4 host. Specifically, under the 380 nm light excitation, the Ca2SnO4:Er3+ phosphor shows two photoluminescence emission bands in the SWIR region: a weak band peaking at ∼985 nm and a strong band peaking at ∼1533 nm, which are attributed to the 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion, respectively. Under the 300 nm light excitation, the Ca2SnO4:Yb3+ phosphor exhibits two emission bands peaking at ∼980 nm and ∼1000 nm, owing to the transitions between the 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 manifolds of the Yb3+ ion, respectively. Under the 450 nm light excitation, the Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphor has five main emission lines in the SWIR region, which correspond to the Pr3+ ion's 1D2 →3H6,3F2 transition at ∼925 nm, 1G4 → 3H4 transition at ∼997 nm, 1D2 → 3F3 transition at ∼1040 nm, 1D2 → 3F4 transition at ∼1115 nm, and 1D2 → 1G4 transition at ∼1440 nm. Under the 365 nm light excitation, the Ca2SnO4:Nd3+ phosphor gives characteristic emissions of Nd3+ ion, showing three emission bands peaking at ∼900 nm, ∼1080 nm, and ∼1350 nm due to the 4F3/2 → 4IJ (J = 9/2, 11/2, and 13/2) transitions, respectively. Under the 360 nm light excitation, Ca2SnO4:Ho3+ phosphor gives rise to three emissions at ∼1026 nm, ∼1180 nm, and ∼1395 nm, which correspond to the 5S2,5F4 → 5I6, 5I6 → 5I8, and 5F5 → 5I6 optical transitions of Ho3+, respectively. Under the 470 nm light excitation, the emission lines of the Ca2SnO4:Tm3+ phosphor locate at ∼1195 nm for the 1G4 → 3H4 transition and ∼1460 nm for the 3H4 → 3F4 transition of Tm3+ ion.
 Fig. 2  Photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, Tm) persistent phosphors. The emission spectra (right panel) of the Er3+, Yb3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+ samples were obtained under the excitations of 380 nm, 300 nm, 450 nm, 365 nm, 360 nm, and 470 nm light, respectively. The excitation spectra (left panel) were acquired by monitoring at Er3+ 1533 nm, Yb3+ 1000 nm, Pr3+ 1115 nm, Nd3+ 1080 nm, Ho3+ 1180 nm, and Tm3+ 1190 nm emissions. 
Besides the commonly observed SWIR photoluminescence, the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors also exhibit strong SWIR persistent luminescence after the removal of the UV light excitation (the excitability of the persistent luminescence of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors under different excitation energies has been discussed later in Fig. 4). Fig. 3 shows the persistent luminescence decay curves of the six Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors after irradiation by a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min. The data was obtained as a function of persistent luminescence intensities versus decay time by monitoring the emissions at 1533 nm for Er3+, 1000 nm for Yb3+, 1115 nm for Pr3+, 1080 nm for Nd3+, 1180 nm for Ho3+, and 1195 nm for Tm3+. The measurements lasted up to 1 h. The Ca2SnO4:Er3+, Ca2SnO4:Yb3+, and Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphors exhibit much stronger persistent luminescence than the Ca2SnO4:Nd3+, Ca2SnO4:Ho3+, and Ca2SnO4:Tm3+ phosphors. After 1 h of continuous emission, the persistent luminescence intensities of the Ca2SnO4:Er3+, Ca2SnO4:Yb3+, and Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphors were still significantly high and were at the same magnitude as those of the MgGeO3:Yb3+ phosphor, whose afterglow could last about 100 h.24 ESI,† Table S1 summarizes the afterglow durations of the six Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ persistent phosphors as well as other SWIR persistent phosphors reported to date.10–12,24
 Fig. 3  Persistent luminescence decay curves of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) persistent phosphors. The phosphors were irradiated by a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min. The decay curves were acquired by monitoring Er3+ 1533 nm, Yb3+ 1000 nm, Pr3+ 1115 nm, Nd3+ 1080 nm, Ho3+ 1180 nm, and Tm3+ 1195 nm emissions. 
The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the SWIR persistent luminescence emission spectra of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors acquired at 5 min after the stoppage of the UV excitation (ESI,† Fig. S2 gives the persistent luminescence emission spectra of Ca2SnO4:Er3+, Ca2SnO4:Yb3+, and Ca2SnO4:Pr3+ phosphors at 3–12 h after the stoppage of the irradiation). The persistent luminescence emission spectrum of each of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors has a profile identical to that of its photoluminescence emission spectrum (Fig. 2), showing that the SWIR persistent luminescence originates from the corresponding Ln3+ ions.
 Fig. 4  Persistent luminescence emission and excitation spectra of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) persistent phosphors. The phosphors were irradiated by a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min and the persistent luminescence emission spectra (right panel) were obtained at 5 min after ceasing the irradiations. The persistent luminescence excitation spectra (left panel) were obtained by plotting the persistent luminescence intensities as a function of excitation wavelengths over the 270–650 nm spectral range. The data is obtained from ESI,† Fig. S3. 
We also determined the excitability of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors in producing SWIR persistent luminescence under different excitation energies. In the measurements, we excited the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors using monochromatic light with different wavelengths between 270 nm and 650 nm in 10 nm steps for 5 min and obtained the persistent luminescence decay curve by monitoring a specific SWIR wavelength of each Ln3+ ion after each excitation (ESI,† Fig. S3). For each phosphor, the intensity of persistent luminescence at 30 s decay (I30s) was used as the reference point to plot the persistent luminescence excitation spectrum, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. Although the SWIR photoluminescence of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ persistent phosphors can be effectively excited by both UV light and visible light (Fig. 2), Fig. 4 shows that their SWIR persistent luminescence can only be effectively achieved by the high-energy UV light excitation; moreover, the effectiveness increases as the excitation moves to shorter wavelengths. The onset excitation wavelengths for the Er3+-, Yb3+-, Pr3+-, Ho3+-, and Tm3+-doped Ca2SnO4 phosphors are at ∼400 nm, whereas that for the Ca2SnO4:Nd3+ phosphor is at ∼450 nm. The differences in the persistent luminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra indicate that the persistent luminescence has a different excitation mechanism from the photoluminescence.13,25 The need of high-energy UV excitation to achieve persistent luminescence in Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors can be briefly explained as follows. Like many other persistent phosphors,13,25 the electron traps in the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors are located close to the bottom of the conduction band, and the filling of these traps needs an ionizing excitation via the conduction band state. The visible photons from the xenon lamp in the spectrofluorometer just do not have the energy to reach the high-energy delocalization states of Ln3+ ions to fill the electron traps.
To further understand the SWIR persistent luminescence properties of the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors, we conducted thermoluminescence (TL) measurements that could provide information about trap distribution and the interactions between the emitters and the traps.26,27 Before the measurements, the Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors were irradiated by 260 nm UV light for 5 min. Fig. 5a shows the normalized TL curves of the six Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors acquired by monitoring a specific SWIR wavelength of each Ln3+ ion. The TL curve of the undoped Ca2SnO4 host was also acquired by monitoring the 470 nm emission, as the gray curve shows in Fig. 5a. All the TL curves, including that obtained from the undoped Ca2SnO4 host, share a similar spectral shape, but with varied band peak positions. The existence of TL emission in the undoped Ca2SnO4 host indicates that the electron traps in the phosphors are intrinsic, which are associated with the lattice defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) in the host.28–30 Note that due to the existence of electron traps in the host, the undoped Ca2SnO4 also exhibits persistent luminescence, but in the visible spectral region (ESI,† Fig. S4). The TL band maxima of the undoped Ca2SnO4 host are located at ∼80 °C. With the doping of Ln3+ ions, the position of the TL band maximum moves to a higher temperature in the order of Yb3+ (∼85 °C), Tm3+ (∼89 °C), Er3+ (∼91 °C), Ho3+ (∼92 °C), Nd3+ (∼100 °C), and Pr3+ (∼106 °C). Remarkably, the moving trend of the TL band position is closely associated with the ionic radius of the Ln3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 5b. From Fig. 5, we can deduce that the trap distribution in the Ca2SnO4 host is significantly affected by the introduction of Ln3+ ions; as the ionic radius of Ln3+ ions increases, the traps in the phosphors become deeper (i.e., moving to a higher temperature region). This TL band movement may result from lattice distortions caused by the difference in the Ln3+ ion sizes, where Ln3+ ions are closely coupled to the traps.31,32 Moreover, our TL measurements also show that while the trap depth of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ phosphors is reduced in the order of Pr3+ > Nd3+ > Ho3+ > Er3+ > Tm3+ > Yb3+ (Fig. 5b), the TL intensity, which can directly reflect the total number of charge carriers captured by the trap centres,33,34 decreases in the sequence of Er3+ > Yb3+ > Pr3+ > Nd3+ > Ho3+ > Tm3+, having the same trend as the persistent luminescence intensity (Fig. 3).

Conclusions
In summary, we found a new application for a group of six Ln3+ ions, including Nd3+, Pr3+, Yb3+, Ho3+, Tm3+ and Er3+ ions, as efficient emitters in SWIR persistent luminescence. By doping Ln3+ ions in a Ca2SnO4 host, strong characteristic SWIR persistent luminescence from the doped ions was achieved, with the emission wavelengths tunable from ∼900 nm to ∼1550 nm. This study greatly expands the field of persistent luminescence in the SWIR spectral region, and the Ln3+ ion-activated Ca2SnO4 SWIR persistent phosphors are expected to have promising applications in a variety of areas such as biomedical imaging and night-vision surveillance. Moreover, our work may stimulate the design and synthesis of other novel Ln3+-activated SWIR persistent phosphors.

The excitation spectra (left panel) were acquired by monitoring at Er3+ 1533 nm, Yb3+ 1000 nm, Pr3+ 1115 nm, Nd3+ 1080 nm, Ho3+ 1180 nm, and Tm3+ 1190 nm emissions.	 

 	Fig. 3  Persistent luminescence decay curves of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) persistent phosphors. The phosphors were irradiated by a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min. The decay curves were acquired by monitoring Er3+ 1533 nm, Yb3+ 1000 nm, Pr3+ 1115 nm, Nd3+ 1080 nm, Ho3+ 1180 nm, and Tm3+ 1195 nm emissions.	 

 	Fig. 4  Persistent luminescence emission and excitation spectra of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) persistent phosphors. The phosphors were irradiated by a 254 nm UV lamp for 10 min and the persistent luminescence emission spectra (right panel) were obtained at 5 min after ceasing the irradiations. The persistent luminescence excitation spectra (left panel) were obtained by plotting the persistent luminescence intensities as a function of excitation wavelengths over the 270–650 nm spectral range. The data is obtained from ESI,† Fig. S3.	 

 	Fig. 5  Thermoluminescence properties of the Ca2SnO4 host and Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Yb, Pr, Nd, Ho, and Tm) persistent phosphors. (a) Thermoluminescence curves acquired over 25–150 °C after the samples were irradiated by 260 nm light for 5 min. The monitoring wavelengths are 1533 nm for Er3+, 1000 nm for Yb3+, 1115 nm for Pr3+, 1080 nm for Nd3+, 1180 nm for Ho3+, 1195 nm for Tm3+, and 470 nm for the host. (b) Shift of the thermoluminescence peak position (i.e., temperature) of Ca2SnO4:Ln3+ relative to that of the Ca2SnO4 host.
