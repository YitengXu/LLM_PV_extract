    , Accepted 15th March 2023First published on 16th March 2023AbstractOxygen vacancy engineering is one of the most effective strategies for enhancing photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. In this work, an efficient TiO2−x nanofiber photoanode based on the thermal reduction of ethylene glycol (EG) was prepared and inhibited charge recombination by confining oxygen vacancies (OV) at the surface of the TiO2 photoanode. The optimized TiO2−x@160 °C nanofiber photoanode with enriched surface OV achieves a high water oxidation photocurrent of 1.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, with an outstanding surface charge separation efficiency of 78% and super photostability at 92% over 2000 s. Electrochemical analysis confirmed that the enhanced PEC performance was ascribed to the introduced Ov on the electrode surface, which acted as interband states to trapped photogenerated holes and facilitated the electrode/electrolyte interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the TiO2−x with enriched surface OV lowered the overpotential for accelerating water splitting reaction kinetics on the TiO2−x surface. This work demonstrated an approach that could be expanded to other electrode materials with tuned surface defects.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology can directly generate hydrogen and relieve greenhouse emission burdens by utilizing solar energy.1–3 PEC water splitting on semiconductor electrodes is a process limited by light absorption, charge transport properties and surface water oxidation kinetics.4,5 Since the discovery of titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductors as photoanodes for hydrogen generation converted from solar energy in the early 1970s,6 a wide spectrum of semiconductor oxides (e.g., WO3, Fe2O3, ZnO, BO6) have been discovered and used as photoanodes in PEC water splitting applications.7–12 The TiO2 semiconductor, the first semiconductor discovered in the PEC field, has become the most popular photoanode material and has been developed for 50 years due to its non-toxicity, low cost, unique photoelectric properties and good performance.12,13 However, the PEC conversion efficiency from solar to hydrogen (STH) is still far from the practical application. Therefore, intensive efforts, including defect construction, co-catalyst loading, morphology control and heterojunction fabrication, have been made to promote light energy conversion efficiency.14–20
Oxygen vacancies (OV) are prevalent defects in semiconductor oxides. The physical and optical properties of semiconducting oxides will be influenced by the introduction of OV, resulting in the formation of efficient semiconductor oxide photoanodes. Most recently, OV modification on semiconductor oxide photoanodes has been attracting much more research attention.21–23 Recent studies showed that the increased local charge density was caused by the introduction of OV, which can act as interband states thereby trapping photogenerated holes.24 Additionally, excess OV can also act as photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination centers.25–28 Because the PEC performance of TiO2 is inherently limited by its poor charge separation efficiency caused by the short diffusion length of minority carriers, the introduction of OV can be considered as a promising strategy to improve TiO2 PEC performance by suppressing the charge recombination.29
Herein, a TiO2−x photoanode with enriched surface oxygen vacancies was synthesized based on a two-step solvothermal method by thermal reduction of EG to generate oxygen vacancies on the TiO2−x photoanode. The as-synthesized TiO2−x photoanode was characterized in terms of its micromorphology, phase structure and valence state of elements. In PEC tests, the synthesized TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode achieved an optimum photocurrent of 1.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 2.9 times greater than that of pristine TiO2, with an approximately 0.07 V vs. RHE cathodic shift of onset potential. Moreover, the surface charge separation efficiency and the electronic behavior of the TiO2−x photoanode were investigated in detail. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculation is performed to understand the role of the surface OV in the oxygen evolution reaction in depth.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2 nanofiber photoanodes and TiO2−x nanofiber photoanodes
The TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method (Fig. 1). FTO glass was immersed in a clear TiCl4 (36 mmol L−1) solution until the solution was slightly turbid, then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min to obtain the TiO2 seeds. The TiO2 seed was transferred to an autoclave, followed by adding 60 mL of HCl (6 M) solution and 0.8 g of tetrabutyl titanate. The autoclave was kept at 170 °C for 6 hours. The as-prepared TiO2 electrode was then annealed at 400 °C for 2 h under air, denoted as the TiO2 photoanode.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the synthetic procedure of the TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes. 
The TiO2−x photoanode was further synthesized by solvothermal method. Typically, the TiO2 nanofiber was placed into a high-pressure kettle with 20 mL ethylene glycol, and kept for 10 h at different temperatures. Afterwards, the obtained samples were washed with ethanol and DI water, denoted as the TiO2−x photoanode.
Characterization
Crystal structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8). A scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3 LMU) instrument was used to observe the morphology of the samples. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4600. All the PL spectra were obtained at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer with an integration sphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi), with an Al Kα source (30 eV pass energy), were performed to examine the surface properties and compositions of the prepared samples.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard three-electrode system with a CHI760D electrochemical analyzer. The light source was simulated solar light, and the lamp was calibrated according to previous work.11 1 M NaOH with a pH value of ∼14 was used as an electrolyte at 25 °C. The measured potential was converted into potentials versus reversible hydrogen potential (RHE) using the relationship of ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0Ag/AgCl.

Calculation of the charge separation (ηsurface). 
The efficiency correlated to the surface trapping states (ηsurface) is quantified by introducing Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger. The ηsurface can be calculated based on the following equation: ηsurface = JWater/Jsulphite(1)


Calculation of applied bias photon to current conversion efficiency (ABPE). 
ABPE could be calculated using the following equation: ABPE (%) = (Jlight − Jdark) × (1.23 − VRHE)/Ptotal(2)Jlight and Jdark are the photocurrent density and dark current density (mA cm−2) obtained from a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation. VRHE refers to the applied bias versus RHE (V), and Ptotal is the power density of AM 1.5 G (100 mA cm−2).


Calculation of carrier density (ND) and the depletion width (Wd) through the Mott–Schottky plots. 
The Mott–Schottky plots are measured in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH 14) at frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions. The ND can be obtained using the equation:4 1/C2 = (2/qεε0ND)[(Eapp − EFB) − kT/q](3) ND = 2/qεε0[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(4)where q is the electron charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (86 for TiO2), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−14 F cm−1), C is the capacitance of the depletion region and V is the applied voltage, and d(1/C2)/dV is the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot. And the WD can be obtained using the equation: Wd = (2εε0(EOC − EFB)/qND)1/2(5)where EFB, k and T respectively represent the flat-band potential, Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1) and the absolute temperature (298 K).


Calculation of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE). 
IPCE values of the obtained photoanodes could be calculated using the equation below: IPCE (λ) (%) = [(Jmono × 1240)/(λ × Pλ)] × 100%(6)where Jmono is the measured photocurrent density at a specific measurement wavelength (mA cm−2), λ is the incident light wavelength (nm) and Pλ is the measured irradiance at a specific measurement wavelength (mW m−2).


Calculation of carrier lifetime (τ). 
The τ can be obtained using the equation:4 τ = −[(kBT)/q] × (dOCP/dt)−1(7)where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and q is the electron charge.

Theoretical calculation method
The Vienna ab initio simulation software package (VASP) was used to calculate all spin polarizations based on general density functional theory (DFT).30,31 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional that is corrected by gradient description describes electronic exchange correlation.32 Ion–electron interactions were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.33 The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV, and the total energy and force convergence for geometric optimization were set to 10−5 and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The models of TiO2 and TiO2−x adopted a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, and two layers were fixed at the bottom with one layer relaxed on the top. The vacuum layer was set to 15 Å in the vertical direction. The first Brillouin zone was integrated using 2 × 3 × 1 Γ centered k-points and the width of the smear was set to 0.05 eV using the Gaussian smear method.34 A semi-empirical correction of DFT-D2 (ref. 35) was adopted to account for the interaction of van der Waals forces.
In addition, we investigated the detailed OER mechanism on the pristine TiO2 and TiO2−x. The OER process in an alkaline environment can be summarized as 4 e− transfer reactions, including: OH− + * → *OH + e−(1) OH− + *OH → *O + H2O(l) + e−(2) OH− + *O → OOH* + e−(3) OH− + *OOH → * + O2 + H2O(l) + e−(4)and the intermediates involved in the process are OH*, O*, and OOH*, where * represents the active site on the substrate surface. The Gibbs free energy change of each oxidation step (1)–(4) is denoted ΔG1–ΔG4.
The overpotential η is obtained from the equation below: η = (ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG3, ΔG4)max/e− − 0.40(8)
Using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model,36 the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for each elementary oxidation step in the OER is defined as ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS(9)where ΔE represents the reaction energy obtained from the DFT calculation. ΔZPE and ΔS are the changes of zero-point energy and the entropy correction, respectively (summarized in Table 1). T represents room temperature (298.15 K).

Results and discussion
Structural and morphology characterization
The TiO2−x photoanode was synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 1). For a typical process, TiO2 seeds were vertically placed in an aqueous solution containing TiCl4 and HCl and then thermally oxidized at 400 °C for 2 hours (see details in the Experimental). Subsequently, the TiO2 photoanode was through the second thermal reduction of EG at 160 °C for 10 h, denoted as the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode. The photoanodes were primarily characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2, all the as-synthesized photoanodes exhibit nanofiber morphology arrays. From the large-scale SEM images, the nanofiber arrays were uniform and vertically aligned over the FTO substrate. Additionally, there were no obvious changes in the morphology of the nanofiber arrays after thermal reduction of EG, as shown in Fig. 2c and d.

Fig. 3a exhibits the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized TiO2 based photoanodes comprised only of the rutile phase (JCPDS no. 21-1276). The remaining diffraction peaks at 26.6°, 37.7° and 51.8° are assigned to SnO2 from the FTO substrates. It is noted that the XRD intensity of the as-synthesized TiO2 based photoanodes is almost unchanged, as compared with pristine samples. The results indicate that the morphology and crystal remained stable after thermal reduction of EG. To further clarify the surface changes, the composition and the chemical states of the TiO2 surface after thermal reduction were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The general survey XPS of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes showed the existence of Ti, Sn, O, and C elements (Fig. 3b). The two strong sharp peaks at 463.6 and 457.7 eV can be assigned to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 for the TiO2 photoanodes (Fig. 3c), respectively. Furthermore, no changes of the Ti 2p spectra after thermal reduction were observed. The O 1s spectrum of TiO2 can be subdivided into two sub-peaks at 529.1 eV and 531.0 eV (Fig. 3d), which are associated to the lattice oxygen (OL) and the surface chemisorbed OH− species (OC). After thermal reduction of EG, an additional peak at 530.1 eV appeared, which is associated to the oxygen ions in the oxygen deficient regions (OV) according to previous study.21–23 Additionally, compared to the pristine TiO2, the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode reached a high OV concentration, up to 19%. This indicates that the enriched OV was generated and modified over the TiO2 surface caused by thermal reduction of EG.

PEC water splitting performance
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the TiO2 based photoanodes was studied in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with 1 M NaOH (pH 14) solution, and the light was irradiated from the front under simulated sunlight exposure (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). Firstly, the preparation conditions of the TiO2−x photoanode with OV were optimized at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 4a. The as-synthesized pristine TiO2 electrode showed a photocurrent density of 0.37 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with an onset potential of 0.29 V vs. RHE. Notably, after the introduction of OV under thermal reduction of EG, all the as-synthesized TiO2−x photoanodes exhibit remarkable promoted photocurrent density and cathode displacement of initial potential. This reveals that the introduction of OV by thermal reduction of EG would significantly improve the TiO2 based photoanodes' photocurrent density. The TiO2 photoanode was treated with thermal reduction of EG at 160 °C for 10 h, which is the optimal reaction condition with the highest photocurrent density. More impressively, the as-synthesized TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode yielded the optimum photocurrent of 1.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 2.9 times that of pristine TiO2, with an approximately 0.07 V vs. RHE cathodic shift of onset potential. Additionally, the photocurrent density decreased after thermal reduction of EG at 190 °C, which may produce excess surface OV facilitating electron and hole recombination. Furthermore, the corresponding applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was obtained to evaluate the efficiency of PEC water splitting. It is found that the optimal TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode delivered a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.63% at 0.42 V vs. RHE, which is 3.9 times larger than that of the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of TiO2 and TiO2−x treated thermal reduction at different temperatures. (b) ABPE of TiO2 and TiO2−x treated thermal reduction at different temperatures. 
In the practical applications, electrode stability is an essential character for PEC water oxidation, which is evaluated by the J–t analysis at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The as-synthesized TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode maintained 92% of its initial photocurrent over the 2000 s test, which is more stable than that of the pristine TiO2 at 82% (Fig. 5a). This reveals the improved stability of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode after the introduction of OV. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent density with chopped light was employed to assess the charge recombination at the TiO2−x/electrolyte interface (Fig. 5b). The curves for both photoanodes show the immediately negligible and prompt photocurrent density appeared when the light was switched on or off. These photocurrent transient phenomena indicate that the rapid charge transfer occurred at the electrode/electrolyte interface. To probe the effect of monochromatic light on the photocurrent, the incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE with different wavelengths were measured. The photocurrent density for both photoanodes were mainly concentrated in the ultraviolet region (<400 nm). The TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode reached above 55% at wavelengths from 350–380 nm, more than 2 times larger than that of the TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 5c). The significant enhancement of the IPCE value was in accordance with their PEC performances. Obviously, the introduction of OV by thermal reduction can significantly enhance the PEC performance.

Charge separation efficiency and electronic behavior
As described above, the OV plays a key role in the robust PEC performance of the TiO2−x photoanode, and it is of great research interest to explore the electrochemical characteristics and charge transfer behavior. To begin, the relative electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes were measured by cyclic voltammograms with different scan rates in the non-faradaic potential region (Fig. 6a and b). Fig. 6c shows that the capacitance current has a linear relationship with the scanning rate, and the ratio of the linear slope exhibits the corresponding ECSA. Interestingly, although the morphology of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode was unchanged after thermal reduction, the ECSA of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode was 1.5 times larger than that of the TiO2 photoanode, indicating bulk extra active sites on the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode. Furthermore, after the thermal reduction of EG, the light absorption from the UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectra and the corresponding direct band gaps were unchanged (Fig. 6d). Both the photoanodes showed the same steep absorption onset at 400 nm, and the variation trends of the UV/vis absorption spectra corresponding to the IPCE test. This indicates that the influence of light absorption was negligible to PEC performance after the introduction of OV.

(d) UV/vis spectra of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes (the inset shows the corresponding Tauc plots of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes versus the energy of light). 
To further detect the charge separation and recombination, a series of characterization and experiments were carried out with the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes. The room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes are shown in Fig. 7a. The TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode displayed a quenching of the PL intensity compared with the TiO2 photoanode at 410 nm, indicating that TiO2−x@160 °C with enriched surface OV can effectively suppress the photogenerated carrier recombination on its surface. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) decay also revealed the charge separation behavior. As shown in Fig. 7b, the positive decay is consistent with its anodic photocurrent density, which indicates that the n-type electronically conductive of photoanodes. Under open-circuit conditions, an obvious slower Voc decay rate for the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode suggested slower decay kinetics with respect to more efficient charge separation. This result is then supported by the average electron lifetime (τ) calculated from the open-circuit potential, and the average electron lifetime exhibited an extended electron lifetime for the TiO2−x photoanode. This indicates that the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode possesses faster photogenerated carrier separation rates.

To further confirm this point, the surface separation efficiencies (ηsurface) of the TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes were evaluated by adding sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) as a hole scavenger under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 8). By adding sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) as a hole scavenger agent, the electrolyte can completely inhibit the surface recombination of carriers without affecting the charge separation in the electrode bulk. On the basis of the LSV curves of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes in 1 M NaOH (dashed lines) and without (solid lines) 1 M Na2SO3 solution, the surface charge separation efficiency of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode was significantly increased to 78% compared with that of the TiO2 photoanode at 43%. This demonstrated that the contributions of the introduction of OV improved the charge transfer and surface reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface.

To investigate the electronic behavior and interfacial kinetics, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves of the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes were obtained. From Fig. 9a, the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode presented low charge transfer resistance whether in the dark or under irradiation compared with pristine TiO2, indicating that the OV could enhance the charge transfer of the surface water oxidation reaction. Additionally, on the basis of the M–S plots relationship (Fig. 9b), the carrier density (ND) and the depletion width (WD) were calculated to describe the space charge region and are summarized in Table 2. Notably, the M–S plots indicate that the OV can significantly improve the ND, TiO2 (1.74 × 1019 cm−3) < TiO2−x@160 °C (3.75 × 1019 cm−3), resulting in the superior electronic conductivity and charge transfer efficiency of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode. Meanwhile, the WD of TiO2−x@160 °C decreases from 24 to 15 nm after the introduction of OV, implying a sharp band bending at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, TiO2−x@160 °C (0.91 eV) had a lower flat band potential than TiO2 (1.08 eV), suggesting the low overpotential which is consistent with the cathodic shift onset potentials of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode. The electrochemical character for the TiO2 and TiO2−x@160 °C photoanodes was further examined. It is assured that the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode possessed a lower overpotential than the TiO2 photoanode at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9c), implying that the TiO2−x@160 °C with enriched surface OV exhibited a much higher OER activity compared with the TiO2 photoanode.37 Based on the above discussion, the schematic illustrations of the charge transfer process for the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode are shown in Fig. 9d. The superior PEC performance of the TiO2−x@160 °C photoanode was achieved due to the introduction of enriched surface OV on the TiO2 photoanode. Therefore, it is clear that the OV could act as interband states which can trap photogenerated holes and suppress the charge recombination and thus dramatically promote PEC performance.

To obtain the in-depth comprehension of the role of surface OV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed based on the correlative theoretical models of TiO2 and TiO2−x. Fig. 10 shows the free energy profiles of the OER and the corresponding adsorption geometries of the intermediates on TiO2 and TiO2−x. The OER process in an alkaline environment can be summarized as four elementary reaction steps and these intermediates involved in the process are OH*, O*, and OOH*, where * represents the active site on the substrate surface. According to the calculation results, the formation of the HOO* exhibited the largest positive Gibbs free energy barrier (1.02 eV) for the pristine TiO2, which is the rate-determining step (RDS) of the OER process on TiO2. After the introduction of OV on the surface of TiO2, the Gibbs free energy change of oxidation steps (1) and (2) was less than zero on the TiO2−x models, which means that the TiO2−x interaction with HO* and O* species was too strong, leading to significant uphill formation of the subsequent HOO* and O* species. Notably, the energy barrier of TiO2−x for the RDS of the transition from *O to *OOH was decreased to 0.87 eV with a standard potential of 0.4 V (Fig. 6b). This indicates that the introduction of OV on the surface of TiO2 can lower the free energy barrier and further promote the reaction kinetics for PEC water splitting, which is consistent with the experimental results.

Conclusion
In summary, the present work proposed a thermal reduction method to generate oxygen vacancies on the TiO2−x photoanode. The synthesized TiO2−x@160 °C nanofiber photoanode achieved the optimum photocurrent of 1.08 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, 2.9 times greater than that of pristine TiO2, with an outstanding surface charge separation efficiency of 78% and super photostability at 92% over 2000 s. The electrochemical analysis and DFT calculations revealed that the improvement in PEC performance of the TiO2−x photoanode was ascribed to the introduction of OV on the electrode surface. These OV can act as interband states, slightly increase the relative electrochemical surface areas, and facilitate the TiO2/electrolyte interface charge transfer and water splitting reaction kinetics. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding on the roles of oxygen vacancies in metal oxide photoanodes.
