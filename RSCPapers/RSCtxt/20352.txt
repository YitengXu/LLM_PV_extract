    , Accepted 17th December 2012First published on 17th December 2012AbstractWe report on singlet–singlet annihilation and exciton diffusion in as-prepared p-type and annealed n-type thin films of the low-bandgap quinoidal quaterthiophene [QQT(CN)4] using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. The decay dynamics of exciton populations are well described by a one-dimensional diffusion-limited bimolecular recombination, indicating that the singlet excitons migrate preferentially along the stacking direction. Our results show that the exciton diffusion constants in QQT(CN)4 films do not vary significantly upon thermal annealing. Exciton diffusion lengths are measured to be as high as 4 and 5 nm in as-prepared and annealed QQT(CN)4 films, respectively. We also observe an influence of the excitation densities on the singlet exciton diffusion, which is attributed to phonon scattering. Because of the possibility of patterning p–n regions in QQT(CN)4 films by thermal nanolithography techniques, this study provides important insight not only into the photophysical properties of quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives but also for their future integration into high-performance p–n nanostructured near infrared light-sensing devices.
1. Introduction
Exciton diffusion plays a crucial role in the operation of light-emitting and light-harvesting organic devices.1,2 Exciton–exciton and exciton–charge carrier interactions are known to strongly affect the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) at high excitation densities.3 A critical step in the operation of organic solar cells and photodetectors is related to the migration of photogenerated excitons to an electron acceptor/donor interface where they can be dissociated into their constituent charges to produce photocurrent.4 To optimize the number of excitons reaching such an interface, the exciton diffusion length, which corresponds to the distance over which an exciton can migrate before it decays within its lifetime, should be comparable with the size of the donor and acceptor domains. In this context, the accurate determination of the exciton diffusion length is essential for the optimization of photovoltaic materials and device structures.
Quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives have been successfully used as n-type and ambipolar organic semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors with electron and hole mobilities as high as 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1.5 In addition to their good charge transport properties, long quinoidal oligothiophenes with four or more thiophene groups generally present a low bandgap and thus strongly absorb in the near infrared region,6 which makes them promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Recently, a majority carrier type conversion from p-type to n-type was achieved in organic thin films based on the dicyanomethylene-substituted quinoidal quaterthiophene [QQT(CN)4] upon thermal annealing.7,8 The chemical structure of this molecule and its absorption spectra in films are shown in Fig. 1. The effects of a thermal annealing on the charge transport and near infrared absorption properties upon annealing were attributed to the changes in crystalline structure caused by the thermal treatment. Patterning p–n regions in QQT(CN)4 films by direct laser writing was also demonstrated and this method was used to realize complementary logic circuits and p–n diodes.9–11 The realization of nanoscale interdigitated p–n stripes with widths approaching the exciton diffusion length could lead to the fabrication of an ideal photovoltaic device structure.12 Before working on the nanostructuration of p–n regions in QQT(CN)4 photovoltaic devices, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the photophysical properties of this material and to determine the values of the exciton diffusion length in both as-prepared p-type and annealed n-type films.

In this manuscript, we investigate the time-resolved photophysical properties of QQT(CN)4 thin films before and after thermal annealing using an ultrafast pump–probe experiment. The exciton diffusion constant and the exciton diffusion length are determined from the excitation density dependence of the transient absorption dynamics. The results provide crucial information on the excitonic processes in quinoidal oligothiophene thin films and should be taken into account for the future realization of high performance light-harvesting QQT(CN)4 p–n devices nanostructured by thermal nanolithography techniques.
2. Experimental
QQT(CN)4 thin films with a thickness of about 90 nm are prepared onto fused silica substrates by spin-coating from a chloroform solution. This organic material being extremely stable in an ambient environment,7–11 thermal annealing is carried out at 180 °C for 10 seconds using a hot plate and all optical measurements are performed in air. The absorption spectra of QQT(CN)4 films are recorded using a scanning absorption spectrophotometer (UV-3100PC; Shimadzu). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements are performed at room temperature using a conventional femtosecond pump probe setup.13,14 A Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Spitfire Pro 35F-XP, Spectra-Physics) is used as a light source that delivers >3.5 mJ-pulses at 800 nm with <35 fs width at a repetition rate of 5 kHz. The laser output is split to generate the pump and probe beams. Neutral filters are employed to modify the pump power and thus the excitation densities. The initial excitation densities immediately after the pump pulse excitation, denoted n0, are calculated using the following equation:15 (1)where d is the diameter of the excitation spot, L is the thickness, h is the Planck constant, c is the light velocity, f is the repetition rate of the laser pulses, P is the average excitation power and A is the absorbance of the film at the excitation wavelength λ. In our experiments, the laser spot diameter is measured to be around 130 μm. The time delay between the pump and probe beams is varied up to 800 ps via the use of a stable delay line. Pump light is modulated using a mechanical chopper at 230 Hz and the differential transmission ΔT/T of the probe beam is measured as a function of the delay time by a photodiode using a lock-in detection. The differential transmission is computed as ΔT/T = (Ton − Toff)/Toff, where Ton and Toff are the sample transmission with the pump beam on and off, respectively. Let us note that the experimental configuration is designed to study the dynamics of the excitonic population regardless of the coherent vibrational dynamics. On the time scale investigated here coherent processes associated with the coupling of the excitons to the vibration manifold have already relaxed. Such coherent behavior occurs on much shorter times, typically less than 100 fs, and can be observed via the excitonics wave-packet dynamics as known for example in polymers like polydiacetylene.16
3. Results and discussion
The absorption spectra in Fig. 1 show that the QQT(CN)4 films are nearly transparent in the visible and strongly absorb in the near infrared region. The changes in the absorption spectra upon annealing were previously attributed to variations in molecular packing resulting in two different aggregation states.8 It is important to note that no photoluminescence could be detected at room temperature from the films, indicating that the main deactivation channel for the photogenerated excitons is non-radiative.

Fig. 2 shows the transient absorption kinetics of the as-prepared p-type and thermally annealed n-type QQT(CN)4 thin films measured at different high excitation densities ranging from 3.2 × 1019 to 6.3 × 1020 cm−3. As expected, a positive signal (ΔT/T > 0) is observed with a pumping at 800 nm because of the ground state bleaching which occurs in the region of linear absorption of QQT(CN)4 films lying from 600 nm to wavelengths higher than 1.5 μm. At low excitation densities (<4 × 1018 cm−3), the dynamics can be described by a single exponential decay with a lifetime (τ) of about 240 and 205 ps for the as-prepared and annealed films, respectively. We attribute these lifetimes to the non-radiative decay of the singlet excitons. As the excitation density is increased above 1019 cm−3, it can be seen that the transient absorption decays become much faster and deviate from a single exponential. Similar behavior has been observed in various organic materials and is attributed to exciton–exciton annihilation.17–23 In the case of organic thin films, singlet–singlet annihilation arises at high pumping intensities when two singlet excitons are sufficiently close to fuse and to form a single higher energy exciton. The effect of this annihilation on the singlet exciton population n(t) is described by the rate equation:24 (2)where γ is the annihilation rate. The exciton density n(t) was calculated from the ΔT/T signals using the known exciton densities n0 at t = 0. The exciton–exciton annihilation process in polycrystalline organic thin films can be related to three different mechanisms: single step Förster-type energy transfer, three-dimensional (3D) exciton diffusion and one-dimensional (1D) exciton diffusion.25 In the first process, excitons do not diffuse and annihilation involves a single, long range energy transfer step. The efficiency of such a process directly depends on the overlap between the photoluminescence spectrum of the donor molecule and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Because no luminescence was detected from QQT(CN)4 in both solution and neat film, we can exclude this process to explain our results. For 1D and 3D exciton diffusion, the time-dependent annihilation rate is related to the exciton diffusion constant D by the equations:  and .25Ra is the annihilation radius, which corresponds to the exciton separation distance at which annihilation occurs, a is the 1D-lattice constant and N0 is the molecular density. From the above equations, the exciton densities can be calculated as:25 (3) (4)where c = 4πn0Ra2(Dτ/2)1/2 and erf corresponds to the error function. Note that this formalism is related to the problem of capture of particles by trapping centers and assumes that excitons act as non-interacting traps. This method has been previously applied to fit the decays associated with the excited state absorption of a perylene derivative25 and can also be applied to describe the excitation density dependence of our ground-state bleaching responses which are dominated by the non-radiative decay of singlet excitons. Our data were fitted using eqn (3) and (4). The value of Ra is difficult to find experimentally and has been previously assumed to be between 0.5 and 1 nm in thiophene derivatives.26,27 The fits shown in Fig. 3 were obtained with Ra = 0.75 nm. Note that we also checked that the use of other Ra values ranging between 0.5 and 1 nm does not lead to any significant improvement of the fits. The lattice plane spacing corresponding to close π–π stacking was taken as 3.49 and 3.66 Å for the as-prepared and annealed films respectively. These values and the molecular density of 9 × 1020 cm−3 were determined by X-ray diffraction.9,28 As shown in Fig. 3, the best fits were obtained using the 1D exciton diffusion model for annealed films. Similar results were obtained with the as-prepared films. It can be seen that the fits obtained from the 3D exciton diffusion model always lead to dynamics slower at early time and faster at longer time than those of the experimental data. These results indicate that exciton diffusion in QQT(CN)4 films is essentially one-dimensional along the π–π stacking direction. The diffusion coefficients D were determined from the fits of the transient absorption decays using the 1D diffusion model and are plotted as a function of the initial excitation density in Fig. 4. Note that the lifetime τ characteristic of the decays without annihilation was kept constant and thus was not a fitting parameter. This suggests that the as-prepared p-type QQT(CN)4 films were not converted into n-type after femtosecond pulse irradiation. It can be seen that the D values measured in the as-prepared and annealed films are similar. The slightly higher D values in annealed films could be due to the changes in the polycrystallinity of QQT(CN)4 films upon thermal annealing,7,8 resulting in a tiny variation of the exciton quenching at the grain boundaries.29 Noticeably, these results indicate that the thermal treatment does not affect significantly the exciton diffusion processes in QQT(CN)4 in comparison to what has been observed previously for the charge transport properties.7–9 It is worth noting as well that the D values in QQT(CN)4 films are about one and two orders of magnitude lower than those measured, respectively, in polycrystalline thin films made of phthalocyanine (Pc) and perylene derivatives, which are quasi-1D materials for exciton diffusion processes.19,25 We also found that D substantially decreases upon increasing the exciton densities in both as-prepared and annealed films and varies from about 6 × 10−4 to 3 × 10−5 cm2 s−1. Such a behavior can be observed in polycrystalline organic thin films when excitons migrate before the lattice relaxes around the excited molecules.30 When the mean free path of the excitons is reduced by phonon scattering, it has been shown that the temperature dependence of D should follow a T−1/2 law.30 Taking into account the fact that the main relaxation channel in QQT(CN)4 films is non-radiative and assuming that all excitation energy is converted into heat, the rate of the temperature increase in our samples is presumably proportional to the exciton density decay rate. The results displayed in the inset of Fig. 4 show that the diffusion constant linearly increases as a function of the inverse of the square root of the input fluence. This provides evidence that the decrease in the exciton diffusion constant at high excitation densities is essentially due to phonon scattering. Noticeably, this decrease in D goes in parallel with the absence of thermal activation of additional non-radiative decay channels.

 Fig. 4  Diffusion constants D calculated from the 1D-diffusion model plotted as a function of the initial excitation density n0 in as-prepared (open triangles) and annealed (close squares) QQT(CN)4 films. In the inset, D values are plotted against the inverse of the square root of the input fluence of the pump beam. 
In the case of 1D exciton diffusion, the exciton diffusion length (ld) is related to the diffusion coefficient D by the equation: . From the highest measured values of D, ld was calculated to be 4 and 5 nm in the as-prepared and annealed QQT(CN)4 films, respectively. These values are reported in Table 1, together with some earlier results obtained in various organic semiconducting systems.17,23,25,26,31–40 It can be seen that the ld values measured in spin-coated QQT(CN)4 thin films are comparable with those determined in regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)17,26,32 and poly(3-(2′-methoxy-5′-octylphenyl)thiophene) (POMeOPT)23 thin films. However, they are significantly lower than those typically obtained with thermally evaporated small molecules such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc),36,40 perylene bis-phenethylimide (PPEI)37 and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA).25,35,36 On the other hand, ld can be expected to be larger in QQT(CN)4 photovoltaic devices because of a significant reduction of the local heating effects at lower excitation densities. The ld values measured in QQT(CN)4 as-prepared and annealed films suggest that the realization of an ideal photovoltaic device structure would require the realization of interdigitated p–n stripes12,41 with a period of about 10 nm. The realization of p–n stripes with a period of few tenths of nm could be potentially achieved by techniques such as thermal nanoimprint lithography42 or temperature-controlled dip pen nanolithography.43

The measured ld values are one order of magnitude higher than the close π–π stacking distance between neighboring molecules in QQT(CN)4 films. This implies a limited number of diffusion steps during the lifetime of the singlet excitons. An average number of hops by an exciton during its lifetime can be deduced from the ratio kh/k where kh = D/a2 is the hopping rate for 1D exciton diffusion and k = 1/τ is the decay rate, the lifetime τ being taken here as the response time measured from the transient absorption decays in the absence of annihilation.36,44 In the excitation density ranges used in this work, the average numbers of hops are found to vary in as-prepared film from 6 to 79 and in annealed film from 6 to 91. The average distance of singlet excitons in the stack can also be calculated using the equation:25 Δx = aN0/n0. This leads to values of Δx equal to about 6.3 Å and 10 nm for excitation densities of 5 × 1020 cm−3 and 3 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. Thereby, the average distance of excitons in our experiments is lower than the exciton diffusion length at excitation densities higher than 4 × 1020 cm−3. In this case, the assumption of non-interacting traps used for the calculation of the annihilation constant in the frame of this exciton diffusion model is not fully verified. Although the pure 1D diffusion model leads to good fits for all our experimental data, independently of the input fluence of the pump beam, the small number of diffusion steps and the short average distance of excitons its applicability less reliable at the highest excitation densities.
In spite of the large number of studies on the charge transport in organic optoelectronic materials, little is still known on the exciton diffusion properties. The accurate determination of the exciton diffusion length is essential for optimizing the design of high-performance organic solar cells and electroluminescent devices. As shown in Table 1, the values reported so far vary typically from a few nanometers to a few microns. Determining the relevant parameters depends on the particular structures (bulk or heterojunctions for example) and the experimental methods employed. The commonly used techniques of static photoluminescence (PL) quenching, photocurrent response of Schottky diodes and solar cells present the strong disadvantages of being sensitive to the particular surrounding. Enhanced quenching at the metal surface, optical interference in multilayer structures, presence of quenching organic layers or penetration of metal electrodes during the deposition can introduce critical errors in the determination of ld.35 On the other hand, time-resolved PL and ultrafast pump–probe experiments provide direct access to the dynamics of the excitons independently of long lived interaction processes and recombination with charge centers present in “connected structures” or multi-layer devices. In this context, our study shows that ultrafast transient absorption measurements can be used for studying exciton diffusion processes in polycrystalline organic thin films based on weakly-emissive conjugated oligomers. We believe that the exciton diffusion parameters we have obtained, and which are gathered in Table 1, are indeed reliable for future use of such organic materials in optoelectronic devices.
4. Conclusion
In summary, singlet–singlet exciton annihilation has been investigated in as-prepared p-type and annealed n-type QQT(CN)4 films, using an ultrafast pump–probe experiment. The excitation density dependence of the transient absorption decays is well described by a 1D exciton diffusion model, which indicates that singlet excitons migrate preferentially along the π–π stacking direction before their non-radiative relaxation. The exciton diffusion constant was found to decrease when increasing the pump fluence, which is explained by local heating effects and phonon scattering. Exciton diffusion lengths were found to be 4 and 5 nm in the as-prepared and annealed films, respectively. Overall this work provides essential information not only on the photophysical properties and the exciton diffusion processes in quinoidal oligothiophene derivatives but also on their future incorporation into high performance light-sensing and photovoltaic devices.

 	Fig. 2  Normalized transient absorption decays of QQT(CN)4 films before and after thermal annealing for different excitation densities. The wavelength of the pump and probe beams was 800 nm. During this experiment, the fluence of the pump beam varied from 0.13 to 2.37 mJ cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 3  Kinetics of the exciton density measured in annealed film (open symbol) for different initial excitation densities n0. Fits based on the 1D (solid line) and 3D (dashed line) exciton diffusion models (eqn (2) and (3)) are also displayed.	 

 	Fig. 4  Diffusion constants D calculated from the 1D-diffusion model plotted as a function of the initial excitation density n0 in as-prepared (open triangles) and annealed (close squares) QQT(CN)4 films. In the inset, D values are plotted against the inverse of the square root of the input fluence of the pump beam.
