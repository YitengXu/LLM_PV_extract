    , Accepted 1st August 2022First published on 1st August 2022AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under visible light irradiation is a very promising path for green and sustainable hydrogen production. The PEC process has attracted enormous research interest due to the potential of direct conversion of solar power into chemical fuel. Herein, we present a covalent organic framework (COF), which shows promise as an ideal photoabsorber due to the combination of efficient light harvesting sites with a suitable band gap and catalytic sites for the HER. Under solvothermal conditions, a Schiff base type condensation between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylbiphenyl)benzene (TFBB), 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TAT) and 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-benzene (TAB) yields crystalline, 2-D covalent organic frameworks TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs, respectively. The as-prepared triazine containing TFBB–TAT COF shows better photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting compared to the non-triazine based TFBB–TAB COF. This work enriches the structural variety of COFs and plays an important role in PEC water splitting, also illustrating the intriguing electrochemical behaviour of this class of materials.
Introduction
The progressive decrease of fossil fuel reserves gives rise to an acute urgency for clean, sustainable and environmentally viable energy sources.1,2 Till now, solar energy has been the major sustainable energy source in the global energy supply. During the last few decades, several research groups around the world have continuously tried to develop and improve a visible light photocatalytic system as a green technology, which is capable of direct conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, stored in the bonds of “solar fuels” or “chemical fuels” such as hydrogen.3–5 However, the biggest challenges for large scale utilization of these green technologies are minimizing the hydrogen production cost whilst maximising the efficiency at a lower economic investment. This problem can be solved by using photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells, which directly split water in the presence of sunlight to hydrogen and oxygen at the cathode and anode respectively.6–8 Thus the development of an efficient photocatalytic system became an active field of energy research to design efficient photoelectrodes. For this purpose, the physicochemical properties of PEC catalysts such as a suitable band gap, favourable band edge positions, surface area, morphology, interfacial charge transfer kinetics and corrosion stability all play an important role.9–11 Various inorganic and organic photocatalysts have been developed, but compared to inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) tend to perform less efficiently. Despite this, g-C3N4 and many derivatives thereof have been widely exploited due to their tailored structure, excellent electronic properties and diverse synthetic modularity.12–16
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline porous materials in which organic monomers are integrated to form a periodic framework.17–20 In the last few years, COFs have been suggested and developed as new photoactive materials for light-induced hydrogen evolution because of their high electron density that comes with an extended π-stacked structure similar to g-C3N4 as well as distinct porosity.21 Furthermore, the photochemical activity can be precisely tailored by the selection of appropriate building units. COFs are modular, versatile, and adaptive as they are characterized by an easy tunability of the (opto) electronic properties, structure, crystallinity, and porosity. They are mainly composed of highly abundant organic elements (C, H, N, O, S etc.), which allows synthetic versatility. The extended in-plane π-electron conjugation together with the possibility of axial charge transport in the stacking direction by the overlap of π-orbitals can result in high charge carrier mobility.22,23 Such characteristics of supramolecular COF architectures promote light harvesting and charge transport capacity.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is mainly determined by two key factors. One is the suitable valence and conduction band position, in which the electrons are exited from the valence band by photon irradiation. Mostly, the photoactive characteristics of nitrogen-rich COFs are determined by the nitrogen group present in the COF system. In this context, the triazine moiety was found to be a promising photoabsorber site in various polymer or COF systems. The band position of triazine containing photocatalysts is mostly influenced by the N2p orbitals of the triazine moiety. The second PEC governing factor is the electrocatalytic activation of protons by charge recombination to generate molecular hydrogen. Up to now, modified g-C3N4 and its derivatives were used as a stable photocatalyst for proton reduction under visible light irradiation. However, their improper band alignment retards the efficiency of proton reduction. Recently, Jijia et al. reported a covalent triazine polymer/COF by changing the C and N ratio, making the band alignment suitable for proton reduction as well as water oxidation.24 Very few imine and hydrazine based COFs have been explored for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under visible light irradiation.25 There are some significant drawbacks for employing COF materials: their instability and poor energy conversion in neutral water. In our previous study, we reported a porphyrin based metal free COP/COF for electrochemical water splitting in acidic medium.26–28 In the last few years, Lotsch et al. have explored covalent triazine-based COF materials as photocatalysts with high thermal and chemical stability.29,30 The extended π-stacking in triazine based COFs promotes exciton separation and excellent charge transport properties, which is required for photocatalysis.31 So far, these COFs have been explored as potential sorbents and as catalytic supports.32 The exploration of related structures and comparison with triazine-based COFs with COFs with a similar structure but lacking the central triazine unit has not yet been directly explored for photocatalysis. Based upon the superior performance of the triazine containing Covalent Triazine Framework (CTF), herein we introduce a triazine based covalent organic framework (TFBB–TAT), which shows favourable water splitting compared with the triazine-free counterpart TFBB–TAB COF (Scheme 1). The diversity and easily tailored structures for tunable water splitting capacity may not only widen the scope of organic semiconductors but also provide a molecular level understanding and comparison of inherent heterogeneous photocatalysis.

Results and discussion
The crystallinity of both TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs was assessed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis (Fig. 1a and c). An intense peak at a 2θ value of 3.27° and 3.16° observed for TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs indicates the first (100) plane. Other minor peaks at ∼ 5.4° and 6.2° indicate the presence of (200) planes. The broad peak for the TFBB–TAT COF at ∼25° (2θ) stipulates the (001) facet, which is usually observed for amorphous polymers, indicating the presence of strong interlayer π–π stacking, which also suggests that the periodicity of the 2D COFs is extended to the third dimension.33 Although both the COF materials (Scheme 1) are non-planar, the large stacking of the TFBB–TAT COF is due to the planar triazine unit (coming from TAT) in the COF crystallites, which is absent for the TFBB–TAB COF. Due to the presence of the non-planar central phenyl ring (coming from TAB), interlayer stacking for the TFBB–TAB COF is very poor. The stacking distance between the two adjacent layers for TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COF is 3.58 and 3.61 Å respectively. Pawley refinement based on Density Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB) calculated structures was carried out to determine the exact lattice packing for both of these COFs. TFBB–TAT shows slipped-AA stacking with a stacking energy −83.27 kcal mol−1 and the TFBB–TAB COF also shows slip-AA stacking with −78.98 kcal mol−1 stabilization energy per unit cell. The calculated and experimental PXRD patterns match well with this stacking mode. After refinement, the unit cell parameter was calculated to be a = 33.25 Å, b = 34.26, c = 7.22 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 59° (Rwp = 2.59% and Rp = 2.11%) for TFBB–TAT COF and a = 33.04 Å, b = 34.18, c = 7.16 Å, α = 89°, β = 88°, and γ = 59° (Rwp = 3.40% and Rp = 2.41%) for the TFBB–TAB COF (Fig. 1b and d), respectively.34 The stabilization of this slipped-AA stacking over the eclipsed (AA) stacking is due to less repulsion between the atoms, where the atom lies slightly offset to the adjacent layers. To confirm the permanent porosity of these two COFs (TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB), N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out. A typical type IV adsorption isotherm was observed along with a sharp capillary condensation, indicating the presence of mesopores in TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COF (Fig. 2a and b) structures.35 The surface area of 729 m2 g−1, pore width = 3.48 nm and surface area of 130 m2 g−1 and pore width = 3.45 nm for TFBB–TAT (Fig. 2a) and TFBB–TAB COF (Fig. 2b) respectively. The surface area was calculated by taking the value of relative pressure (P/P0) from 0.07 to 0.2 with a total pore volume of 0.244 cm3 g−1 and 0.05 cm3 g−1 for TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB respectively at P/P0 = 0.99. A high surface area for TFBB–TAT was measured, due to the strong stacking throughout long channels of COF crystallites. It is reported that the central triazine moiety is more planar than the central phenyl ring with respect to the other phenyl ring in both the COFs. This makes the TFBB–TAT COF more planar and increases the interlayer stacking. H1 type hysteresis is observed (Fig. 2a and b) in both COF isotherms with a gradual increase in N2 uptake at higher pressure, indicating that mesopores were generated via the aggregation of spherical particles.36 A different carbon environment was confirmed by solid state 13C cross polarisation magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectroscopy. Characteristic imine bonded carbon (–CN–) was reaffirmed by a chemical shift of ∼164 ppm for TFBB–TAT and ∼162 ppm for TFBB–TAB. One extra deshielded peak at 173 ppm was confirmed as the presence of triazine carbon atoms of the TFBB–TAT COF, which are absent in the TFBB–TAB COF (Fig. 2k). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) reveals the presence of the aldehyde –C–H stretching band of TFBB at 2730 cm−1, which is impaired after the condensation reaction to form TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs (Fig. 2l). This indicates full depletion of the starting aldehyde. The total consumption of the starting amine is also confirmed by the attenuation of the –N–H stretch at 3470 cm−1 (TAT) and 3433 cm−1 (TAB) in both of the COFs TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB respectively. Imine bond (–CN–) formation was further confirmed by the appearance of a new peak at 1697 cm−1 for both the COFs, which was absent in all the precursors (TFBB, TAT, and TAB). Morphological studies were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2c–j). From the HR-TEM images, it is evident that both COFs form a hollow tubular morphology with a thickness of ∼400 nm, having an internal diameter of ∼200 nm. SEM images also support the same morphology shown by the TEM analysis. The presence of elemental carbon and nitrogen was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The high resolution XPS analysis shows the presence of two types of C1s peaks at ∼284.0 eV, ∼288.0 eV and ∼283.7 eV, ∼287 eV for TFBB–TAB and TFBB–TAT respectively (Fig. S4a and S5a†). This is due the presence of –CC and –CN carbon atoms in the TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COF moieties. Furthermore, the N1s XPS peak at ∼398.5 eV for TFBB–TAB and ∼397.5 and ∼400.7 eV for TFBB–TAT indicates the presence of –CN functionality for both COF materials. An additional peak arises in the TFBB–TAT COF due to the presence of the triazine moiety (Fig. S4b and S5b†). The chemical stability of the TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs has been verified by stirring the material in 2 M NaOH and 2 M H2SO4 solutions for 5 days, respectively. As shown in Fig. S6a and b ESI,† both the COF materials are relatively stable in 2 M NaOH and 2 M H2SO4 solutions for 5 days. These results suggested a high stability and robust organic framework of TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs.37 The TFBB–TAT COF shows acid responsive behaviour at low pH (1 to 3) (ESI, Fig. S7†). It becomes protonated in this pH range and shows colour change, which is absent in the case of the TFBB–TAB COF. The crystallinity of the TFBB–TAT COF decreases between pH 1 to 3 in the solid sample but at pH 4 it regains the original PXRD pattern (ESI, Fig. S8†).38 We performed post-synthetic modification of imine to amine of the TFBB–TAT COF material (detailed procedure is mentioned in ESI, PS1, Fig. S9†).39 FT-IR spectra revealed that after modification, a new vibration band appeared at 3300–3400 cm−1, which is attributed to a secondary amine (vN–H) stretching mode. The intensity of the imine vibration (vCN) at 1697 cm−1 gradually disappeared over a prolonged reaction time at 120 °C (ESI, Fig. S9†), which agreed with a previously reported procedure.39

Photoelectrochemical activity
The synthesized COFs were employed as photoelectrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water in PEC. The photocathodes were designed by employing the COF material on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) modified ITO surface. The PEDOT:PSS layer on the ITO substrate serves as a hole transporting candidate in the photocathode. Furthermore, the COF layer on the photocathode was in direct contact with the aqueous electrolyte. The cathodic water reduction capacity of the as-synthesized COFs in PEC was studied from polarization plots under dark and illuminated conditions. Fig. 3a shows the cathodic polarization plots of as-synthesized COF modified photocathodes under dark and illuminated conditions. A notable increment of cathodic current density was noticed on switching from the dark to the illuminated conditions. This enhancement of cathodic response was attributed to the photoreactivity of the as-synthesized COFs. The improved negative current density upon illumination originates from the electron–hole pair generation on the COF surface, followed by the transfer of the hole to PEDOT:PSS/ITO and the electron moves to the electrolyte, leading to water reduction.40 The water reduction efficacy of a photocathode is generally determined from the magnitude of current density at 0 V vs. RHE, which signifies thermodynamic bias free conditions. In the present study, the TFBB–TAT containing photocathode delivers a current density of 4.32 mA cm−2, which was found to be much superior to that of the TFBB–TAB based counterpart. The higher cathodic current density achieved with the TFBB–TAT photocathode reflects its potential for water reduction under visible light illumination. Moreover, the cathodic current response of the TFBB–TAT electrode was found to be superior to that of TFBB–TAB throughout the studied cathodic potential region. The reversibility of the photoreactivity of the synthesized COF was studied from the transient photocurrent response over several light on–off cycles. The transient photocurrent was recorded at a fixed potential of −0.5 V vs. SCE. Fig. 3b shows the transient photoresponse of the designed photocathodes. A sharp increase of negative current density was noticed under light illumination, whereas the current response reverts back to the initial value as the illumination is shut down. This rapid change of response current under dark and illumination states signifies good photoreversibility of the developed photocathodes. Moreover, the magnitude of transient photoresponse was found to be higher for TFBB–TAT as compared to TFBB–TAB. Similar characteristics were noticed for the polarization, which again reflects the better photoreactivity of TFBB–TAT than TFBB–TAB. The better photoreactivity of the TFBB–TAT COF arises from its low band gap as compared to the TFBB–TAB counterpart and more importantly, the presence of triazine functionalities helps to improve the photoabsorption capacity of TFBB–TAT.41 However, the TFBB–TAB counterpart does not have any such functionality for light harvesting. Thus, the photocurrent recorded in the TFBB–TAT electrode was found to be enhanced compared to the TFBB–TAB counterpart. The current response recorded with the present photocathodes was found to be comparable to that of many recently reported photocathodes.42–44

The efficiency of a photocathode for water reduction largely depends on its charge transfer characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In order to study the charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface we have executed impedance measurements. The complex impedance plot, known as the Nyquist plot, is mostly used to understand the charge transport characteristics of an electrode/electrolyte interface. Fig. 3c shows the Nyquist plots of the designed photocathodes. The Nyquist plots show a semicircle arc in the 5–25Z (Ω) region and a straight line evolved in the high frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle arc is generally used to evaluate the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of an electrode/electrolyte interface. A smaller diameter signifies lower charge transfer resistance and vice versa. Furthermore, the low charge transfer resistance ascertains good charge transport from the electrode to the electrolyte, which leads to higher redox kinetics at the electrode surface. In the present study, the TFBB–TAT electrode exhibits lower Rct (17.12 Ω) than the TFBB–TAB (21.74 Ω) electrode. However, charge transfer resistance is not only the parameter responsible for the higher proton reduction rate of the TFBB–TAT COF. The high surface area of the TFBB–TAT COF (729 m2 g−1) compared to the TFBB–TAB COF (130 m2 g−1) offers a large electrode–electrolyte interfacial area, which results in a promising proton reduction capacity.45 This corroborates the higher charge transfer across the TFBB–TAT/electrolyte interface as compared to the TFBB–TAB/electrolyte interface, which results in faster water reduction kinetics at the former electrode. Thus, the high photoresponse obtained with the TFBB–TAT electrode can be attributed to its good photoabsorption capacity together with efficient charge transport characteristics. The potentials for the HER of TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB COFs are linearly increased with the increase of the pH value (ESI, Fig. S10†) with a slope of 57 mV (ln10 × RT/F) at 25 °C (detailed description in the ESI section†).46,47 The long term photostability of the designed photocathodes was investigated by amperometric studies under illuminated conditions. The designed photocathode shows considerable retention of photocurrent density after 180 minutes of operation under visible light illumination (Fig. 3d). However, the TFBB–TAT photocathode (94% retention) exhibits better stability than the TFBB–TAB photocathode (73% retention). The high stability of the TFBB–TAT photocathode under illumination conditions makes it a potential candidate for efficient PEC water splitting application. The chronoamperometric study reveals that water reduction capacity of the evolved hydrogen during PEC water splitting at −0.5 V vs. SCE. Fig. 3e shows the PEC hydrogen production profile of TFBB–TAT and TFBB–TAB based photocathodes. The TFBB–TAT based photocathode offers a hydrogen production capacity of 137 μmol cm−2 after 180 minutes of PEC operation. Moreover, the hydrogen production capacity of the TFBB–TAT electrode is shown to be 7.6 times higher than that of the TFBB–TAB electrode. This superior hydrogen production activity of the TFBB–TAT photocathode was attributed to its low band gap, higher photoabsorption capacity, and efficient charge transport capacity as compared to the TFBB–TAB photocathode. Furthermore, the high surface area of the TFBB–TAT COF offers a large number of active sites for water reduction on the electrode surface. Previous reports on nitrogen rich COFs for electrochemical water splitting (proton reduction) revealed that –CN– functionalities serve as active centres for proton reduction by molecular hydrogen generation.30 In the present study, both the synthesized COFs have –CN– functionalities on their structural unit, which can serve as the active centre for water reduction. Thus, the number of –CN– functionalities will determine the water reduction capacity of the COF-modified photocathodes. In the case of the TFBB–TAT COF, the number of –CN– linkages per unit structure was found to be higher than that of TFBB–TAB. The availability of a higher number of electrocatalytic sites on TFBB–TAT offers better water reduction capacity than that of the TFBB–TAB COF. Moreover, the interconnected porous structure enhances the electrolyte diffusion onto the electrode surface resulting in faster electrode kinetics. The interlinked highly conjugated electronic structure of the synthesized COF helps achieve good electronic conductivity. The nitrogen rich TFBB–TAT electrode shows lower charge transfer resistance than the TFBB–TAB counterpart. This may be attributed to the better electronic conductivity of the former as compared to the latter. The performance of the present TFBB–TAT photocathode was found to be comparable to that of many previously reported photocathodes for PEC water splitting (Table T3, ESI†). In the case of the TFBB–TAT COF, the photoanode offers an oxygen production capacity of ∼ 70 μmol cm−2, whereas the TFBB–TAB COF offers ∼15 μmol cm−2 after 180 minutes through PEC via the water splitting reaction (Fig. S16, ESI†).48
Theoretical and mechanistic calculations
To further prove the exact electron excitation and charge recombination, the band edge position for both the COFs was calculated (Fig. 3f). The theoretical band gap for the TFPB–TAT COF was determined by DFTB calculation to be 2.347 eV with a valence band energy of +0.91913 eV (vs. NHE) and a conduction band energy of −1.428 eV (vs. NHE). The absorption spectrum is shown in ESI, Fig. S12.† The TFBB–TAT COF absorbs light in the visible range with an absorption threshold of around 540 nm and one absorbance maximum at 360 nm with a calculated band gap of 2.31 eV, which is very close to the theoretical band gap (2.336 eV) for AA stacking mode. The TFBB–TAB COF shows an absorption maximum at 430 nm. In the case of TFBB–TAB, it shows λmax at ca. 430 nm, and as a result, the calculated optical band gap is 2.88 eV, which is a little higher compared to the theoretical band gap (2.156 eV) for AA stacking.49 This band position shows that the driving force for the proton reduction is enough for the TFFB–TAT COF. However, the transfer of photogenerated holes becomes necessary to reduce the electron–hole pair recombination, which helps to improve the effective utilization of photoexcited electrons for proton reduction. Thus, the presence of an appropriate hole transporting layer will improve the water reduction capacity of the designed photocathode. In the present study, PEDOT:PSS was used as a hole transporting layer for hole transport from COFs to the ITO surface. The valence band maximum of PEDOT:PSS was observed at 0.6 eV vs. NHE (−5.0 eV vs. vacuum), which can easily extract a hole from the valence band of the synthesized COFs. Thus, the efficient charge separation in the presence of the hole transporting PEDOT:PSS layer offers a promising PEC performance. A schematic of the charge transport mechanism of the designed photocathode is depicted in Fig. 4.

This figure represents PEC water splitting at the COF/PEDOT:PSS/ITO modified surface as a photocathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a Pt anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under bias free conditions. TFBB–TAT with a bandgap energy (Eg) of 2.31 eV is photoexcited under ultraviolet-visible light irradiation.50 
Conclusion
In conclusion, we present a new triazine based covalent organic framework, which shows superior water splitting with respect to the non-triazine counterpart in a photoelectrochemical process. The triazine unit would be play an important role in light harvesting and electrocatalytic water reduction. The enhanced catalytic activity is due to the large surface area, satisfactory band gap and optimised planar structure leading to better electron charge separation. The photoelectrochemical HER performance of the TFBB–TAT COF is comparable to or even better in some cases than that of traditional metallic catalysts. The excellent stability and durability of the TFBB–TAT COF as a photocathode in the presence of light irradiation conditions made it a potential candidate for future efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) application. This finding should be of considerable interest to the materials chemistry as well as renewable energy community for next generation organic fuel cells.
