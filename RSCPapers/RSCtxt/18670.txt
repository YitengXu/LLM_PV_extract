    AbstractWe achieved the vertically aligned and ordered hematite hierarchical columnar arrays using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with polystyrene (PS) colloid spheres as templates. Crystallized hematite hexagonal-close-packed columnar arrays are fabricated at room temperature and can be transformed to hexagonal-non-close-packed columnar arrays at an annealing temperature of 450 °C. The hierarchical columns consist of assembled nanoplates or nanoparticles, depending on the oxygen pressures during the PLD process. The improved performance in field emission (FE), surface wetting, and photocatalytic properties of the hematite hierarchical columnar arrays is due to the unique morphology of the superstructures and controlled compositions.
Introduction
Since the landmark publication on carbon nanotubes,1 one-dimensional (1D) materials have been intensively researched because of their functions as model systems for studying the correlation between nanoscale structures and unique properties. Moreover, 1D systems can be used as building blocks for the next generation of nanoscale optical, electronic, photonic and biological devices. Because of their improved functional performance, fabricating ordered nanostructured arrays is one of the greatest challenges in nanotechnology and has attracted much interest, due to their applications in high-density magnetic memories, sensors, UV lasers, and photonic crystals.2 Conventional approaches to fabricating nanostructured arrays rely mainly on electron, UV, X-ray and laser interference lithography, which provide precise control of size, periodicity, and shape.3 However, these techniques are generally costly and time-consuming, and have low throughput; thus, they are impractical in large-scale industrial applications. In the past few years, cost-effective template-assisted methods have been investigated to fabricate nanostructured arrays4 of which the physical and chemical properties can be tailored by adjusting the structural parameters of templates. Among these methods, the monolayer colloidal crystal template has proved to be a successful and promising technique. Nanoparticle, nanopore, nanoring, and 1D-ordered nanostructured arrays can be prepared using the monolayer colloidal crystal as a mask or template.5
The 1D nanostructures, especially metal oxide (ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, etc.) nanowires or rods, have exciting potential applications in various areas (e.g., sensors, field emitters, solar cells, catalysis, and other optoelectronic devices).6 The hematite (α-Fe2O3), n-type semiconductor with a small band gap (∼2.1 eV), high stability under ambient conditions, and low cost has been used in sensor, photocatalyst, field emission (FE) cathode, water splitting, and solar energy conversion.7 Techniques such as the hydrothermal process, direct thermal oxidation of iron substrate, pulsed laser deposition (PLD)-assisted CVD, decomposition of organometallic iron precursors, and sol–gel have been proposed to produce 1D iron oxide nanostructures.8 It is obviously desirable to develop a generalizable protocol aimed at overcoming high temperature, long growth time, the use of toxic precursors, and complicated equipment.
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to use polystyrene (PS) monolayer colloidal crystals as templates and PLD as the deposition technique to fabricate vertically ordered and aligned hematite hierarchical columnar arrays. The basic experimental procedure is the same as our previous report.5f,g Compared with previous techniques of fabricating hematite nanostructures, the key attractive attributes of the present method are (a) the hierarchical structures of columns; (b) the uniform, vertically ordered, and aligned arrangement on the substrates; (c) room-temperature growth; (d) lack of a toxic organic precursor; (e) relatively short growth time from several minutes to 1 h; (f) no catalyst use; and (g) transferability onto any type of substrates. Good control on the morphology of columnar arrays enabled us to systematically investigate their unique applications. Here, as typical examples, we demonstrate the potential applications of hematite hierarchical columnar arrays in FE, photocatalysis and wetting behavior.
Experimental
Self-assembly of PS colloidal crystal sphere monolayer
Monodispersed PS (350 nm in diameter) suspensions (2.5 wt% in water, surfactant free) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Co. Colloidal crystal monolayers were fabricated on cleaned Si substrates by spin coating, as described previously.5 Briefly, a droplet of PS suspension was placed on a cleaned Si substrate with an area of 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 fixed on the spin coater. The rotating speed was kept at 1300 rpm for 10 min, and a colloidal crystal monolayer with an area of 2 cm2 was formed on the substrate by a self-assembly process.
Formation of hematite hierarchical columnar arrays
A third harmonic of the Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Precision 8000; wavelength 355 nm, pulse width 7 ns, repetition rate 10 Hz) was used as a light source for PLD deposition. A laser beam with a fluence of 100 mJ/pulse irradiated a hematite single-crystal target with a 2 cm diameter. The PS colloidal monolayer on the Si substrate was placed in an off-axis configuration in the PLD chamber. The substrate was rotated at 35 rpm, and the target was rotated at 30 rpm. After the deposition, some of the samples were annealed in a furnace at 450 °C for 3 h in air.
Morphology and structure characterization
The morphology was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800), the phase structures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV/PSK with Cu-Kα radiation λ = 0.154056 nm), and the chemical composition was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Perkin Elmer PHI 5600ci).
Property measurement
Field emission measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 2 × 10−6 Pa at room temperature. A rod-like aluminium probe with a cross section of 1 mm2 was used as an anode, and a hematite columnar array film served as a cathode. A dc voltage sweeping from 100 to 1100 V was applied to the sample, and the corresponding electrical current was recorded automatically.
Photocatalytic experiments were conducted as follows. The as-prepared samples were immersed in methyl blue (MB) solution (2 × 10−6 M, 30 ml) and kept for about 10 min, and then directly irradiated with UV light at ambient atmosphere. The UV light was supplied by a SLUV-6 light source with a wavelength of 254 nm and a power of 90 W (or light intensity of 1.27 W cm−2). After different irradiation intervals, 3 mL of the MB solution was removed at different times for analysis. The degradation of MB during UV illumination was investigated by measuring absorption spectra using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Solid Spec-3700 DUV, Shimadzu).
The water contact angle (CA) was measured with a VCA Optima XE from AST Products, Inc. A droplet was injected onto the surface of the columnar-array films using a 2 μL micro-injector.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–d depict SEM images of samples deposited by PLD at oxygen pressures of 6 Pa (Fig. 1a and b) and 60 Pa (Fig. 1c and d) at room temperature. The cross-sectional images (Fig. 1b and d) illustrate that the target materials were deposited on the top surfaces of each PS sphere and grew continuously along the vertical direction to form ordered columnar arrays. The top surface views (Fig. 1a and c) indicate that the columnar arrays replicate the hexagonal-close-packed arrangement of PS spheres. Obviously, all the columns bear hierarchical structures that are composed of nanoplates at 6 Pa and nanoparticles at 60 Pa.

To grow columnar arrays directly on the substrates, we annealed the samples in air at 450 °C for 3 h to decompose PS spheres. The SEM images (Fig. 2 and 3) of the annealed samples indicate that the columnar arrays have three characteristics that distinguish them from the as-deposited samples: (a) the arrangement of columnar arrays changes from hexagonal-close-packed to hexagonal-non-close-packed form; (b) each column preserves its hierarchical structure, although the sizes of nanoplates and nanoparticles change slightly; (c) PS spheres disappear, and the columns are attached directly to the substrate.

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the samples before (Fig. 4a) and after (Fig. 4b) annealing in air. Although PLD deposition was performed at room temperature, all the samples crystallized and could be readily indexed to pure rhombohedral phase α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS: 89-0599), which was obtained previously by another technique at relatively high temperatures.8 It should be also noted that the XRD peak intensity ratio of (110) to (104) for as-prepared nanostructures was much higher than that for standard bulk α-Fe2O3 data (Fig. 4a), indicating a preferential growth of (110) plane. From the structure model of hematite,7b O atoms are rich and Fe atoms are deficient in the (110) plane, which is generally considered to be the driving force for the preferential growth along the [110] direction. Annealing treatment improved crystallinity and further enhanced the peak intensity of (104) planes (Fig. 4b); particularly, the (104) plane has become dominant for the columns composed of nanoparticles obtained at 60 Pa. Obviously the annealing process induces sintering, resulting in nanoparticle size increase (Fig. 3 compared with Fig. 1c and d). Furthermore, the as-prepared sample at 60 Pa contains an amorphous phase from the XRD spectrum (Fig. 4a), probably due to the strong collision during PLD and thus the loss of kinetic energies of ejected species. The randomly oriented crystallites were formed by annealing from the amorphous phase to show the typical diffraction spectrum of bulk α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 4b).

Studies on the field-emission (FE) properties of hematite nanostructures are rather limited compared to those on other field emitters (e.g., carbon nanotubes and other semiconductor nanomaterials), mainly due to the lack of well-ordered and aligned nanoarrays. Here we have solved this problem, and FE measurements indicate that hematite columnar arrays are potential field emitters.

Fig. 5a plots the J–E curve for aligned hematite columnar arrays (composed of nanoparticles deposited at 60 Pa, hexagonal-non-close-packed arrangement after annealing) measured at different anode–cathode gaps (d). When the gap increases from 10 to 55 μm, the turn-on field during voltage increase (defined as E at which J becomes 0.1 μA cm−2) decreases monotonically from 64.0 V μm−1 to 48.5, 19.0 and 17.8 V μm−1. Meanwhile, the threshold field (defined as E at which J becomes 0.1 mA cm−2) decreases from 86 V μm−1 at 10 μm to 70.5 V μm−1 at 15 μm. The FE current–voltage characteristics can be expressed by a simplified Fowler–Nordheim (FN) equation.9 J = (Aβ2E2/ϕ)exp(–Bϕ3/2/βE)(1)or ln(J/E2) = ln(Aβ2/ϕ) − Bϕ3/2/βE(2)

(c) Relationship between the field-enhancement factor β and gap d. The straight line is the linear fit to experimental data based on the TRFE model. (d) Field-emission stability data over 3 h. 
Here A = 1.54 × 10−6 A eV V−2, B = 6.83 × 103 eV−3/2 V μm−1, ϕ is the work function of the emitting materials (5.4 eV for hematite), and β is the field-enhancement factor that describes how the electric fields can be enhanced by protrusions from the emitting surface. Generally, β is related to emitter geometry (such as the aspect ratio), crystal structure, and spatial distribution of the emitting centers. The linear variation of ln(J/E2) with 1/E (FN plot) (Fig. 5b) supports the hypothesis that the current is due to field emission, according to FN theory. It is noteworthy that two slopes are observed when samples are positioned at relatively small distances with low applied voltages because at relatively low voltages only a few electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band and subsequently emitted from the columns. At high voltages, all of the electrons contribute to emission and result in a high β.8d
From the slope of the linear part of the FN plot, β can be calculated to be 130 for d = 10 μm, 278 for d = 15 μm, 417 for d = 45 μm, and 463 for d = 55 μm. The 1/β versus 1/d plot is presented in Fig. 5c. Thus, we are able to establish the relationship between β and d. It is clear that 1/β follows the trend for 1/d (i.e., the larger the gap, the higher the β). Based on the two-region field-emission (TRFE) model,10 we found that the experimental data almost fit a straight line and can be approximated by 1/β = h/d + 1/β0, where h is the width of the field-enhancement region near the column surface and β0 is the absolute amplification factor, which is intrinsically determined by emitters and is independent of d and applied fields. Parameter h is 60 nm, and β0 (determined by fitting the slope and intercept value) is 1240.
Field-emitter stability is another important parameter related to potential applications. FE stability was measured by keeping an electric field at 83 V μm−1 for 3 h. As indicated in Fig. 5d, no notable current degradation was observed during this period. Good emission stability demonstrates that the hematite columnar arrays could find potential applications in cold-cathode-based electronics.
As a comparison, FE performance of the hematite columnar arrays composed of nanoplates is indicated in Fig. 6. From the J–E (Fig. 6a) and FN (Fig. 6b) curves, the turn-on voltage is 72 V μm−1, which is higher than that for hematite columnar arrays composed of nanoparticles; however, the field-enhancement factor β is 131, which is lower than that for hematite columnar arrays composed of nanoparticles. This discrepancy may be due to two factors: (a) a more intensive electrical field screening effect resulting from closer distance between the columns composed of nanoplates; (b) compared with nanoplates, nanoparticles have a sharper configuration on the top surface of each column. These features can be confirmed from SEM images.

From the above results, the field emission properties are still not comparable with carbon nanotubes, which have been extensively studied since 1990s. However, our fabricated hematite nanostructures have a perfect ordered and aligned arrangement, and showed promising FE performance without any optimization. In the next step, we can further improve FE properties by controlling the crystallinity, periodicity and density of columns.
The wetting of solid surfaces by a liquid is very important in the field of surface chemistry, which has potential applications in self-cleaning and antifogging coatings of window glasses and windshields of automobiles. When a liquid droplet contacts the surface of a solid substrate, it will either remain as a droplet or spread to form a thin liquid film, which is normally characterized using the contact angle (CA) to evaluate the wetting degree. When the CA of water exceeds 150°, it is called superhydrophobicity; when it is less than 10°, it is called superhydrophilicity. Inspired by superhydrophobic living organisms in nature (e.g., lotus leaves), artificial surfaces with controlled wetting characteristics are commonly fabricated by creating microstructures of nanostructures on the surface of substrates or adjusting the surface free energy and composition.11
Various transition-metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, and WO3) exhibit photoinduced hydrophilicity after UV light irradiation.12 However, the CA increases again and the superhydrophilicity disappears when UV light is removed. Therefore, searching for superhydrophilic materials without UV light irradiation is a challenge. Hematite, the most stable iron oxide under ambient conditions, is a good candidate; however, reports on superhydrophilicity are still scarce.13 Here, hematite columnar arrays have a hierarchical structure with improved roughness, demonstrating superhydrophilicity without UV irradiation.

Fig. 7 presents photographs of liquid droplet on the surfaces of hematite columnar arrays composed of nanoplates (Fig. 7a) and nanoparticles (Fig. 7b). The two samples had CAs of 8.7° and 7.0°, which was less than 10°; thus, superhydrophilicity was achieved. In general, the superhydrophilicity of metal oxides is attributed to the combined effect of rough surface and OH− radicals.14 Therefore, it is necessary to carry out XPS analysis on the surface of columnar arrays.

Fig. 8 plots the typical XPS spectra of the O 1s level with peak deconvolution analysis. Besides the main oxide peak at 529.9 eV, there is always one peak at 531.5 eV that typically is assigned to the OH− radical, which is related to oxygen defects. In the PLD process, the target material is irradiated by a laser beam with high energy and produces a plasma plume. In this restricted region, the evaporated species collide intensively, and oxygen atoms tend to be lost; thus, it is easy to obtain deposits with vacancies or defects, which makes the surface highly hydrophilic.

According to Wenzel's equation,15 cos θr = r cos θw(3)where r is the surface roughness, and θr is the CA on a rough surface, and θw is the CA on a smooth surface. For a hydrophilic surface where θw < 90°, the CA decreases further with increasing roughness, and water fills the grooves below the droplet. Thus, superhydrophilicity can be expected.
For further identification of the origin of superhydrophilicity, a hematite nanoparticle film was deposited under the same conditions as for the hierarchical columnar arrays at 6 and 60 Pa of oxygen pressure and then annealed at 450 °C for 3 h in air. Fig. 9 presents the SEM images of films and corresponding photographs of water droplets. The CA of the nanoplate film is 15.1°, and that of the nanoparticle film is 14.7°, indicating that the hierarchical columnar arrays increase surface roughness and thus induce a wettability change from hydrophilicity to superhydrophilicity. Therefore, the superhydrophilicity of hematite hierarchical columnar arrays results from improved surface roughness on the hierarchical columnar arrays and from the large number of OH− radicals induced by the PLD process.

The hierarchical structures and abundant content of OH− radicals facilitate interesting applications of hematite columnar arrays in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.16 The hematite columnar arrays were immersed in MB solution and irradiated using UV light. The time-dependent absorption spectra are depicted in Fig. 10a and b. The strong absorption bands of MB located at 663 nm and 292 nm steadily decrease with increasing irradiation time, clearly indicating that MB can be the degraded when the solution is put in contact with hematite nanostructures. MB can be decomposed either by the oxidative degradation of dye or by the two-electron reduction process to leuco-MB. We are unable to find the characteristic absorption band at 256 nm of leuco-MB; hence, the degradation of MB is attributed to the oxidative degradation of the dye.17Fig. 10c plots the degradation curves of MB solution after reaction with, hematite nanoparticle film, and hematite columnar arrays composed of nanoplates and nanoparticles. A bare Si substrate under UV irradiation and hematite nanoparticle film under dark condition were used for control experiments. Compared with the flat nanoparticle film, the hematite columnar arrays demonstrate obviously higher catalytic efficiency due to the hierarchical morphology. The catalytic activity of hematite columnar array composed of nanoparticles is higher than that of one composed of nanoplates, possibly due to the smaller substructures and larger pore sizes (Fig. 2 and 3) and the resulting easier diffusion and adsorption of MB solution. In contrast, the bare Si substrate under UV irradiation and hematite nanoparticle film under dark condition used as the control experiments almost did not produce degradation of the MB solution. Previously our group also measured the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanocolumnar arrays using IR spectrum as an evaluation technique and the same phenomenon was observed.18

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated well-ordered and aligned hematite columnar arrays by a simple PLD process with PS colloid spheres as templates. The hematite columns have hierarchical microstructures that are composed of nanoplates or nanoparticles that can be controlled by oxygen pressure during PLD deposition. Composition analysis demonstrates that hematite columns contain abundant OH− radicals produced during deposition. The combined effect of hierarchical structures and OH− radicals makes hematite columnar arrays demonstrate superhydrophilicity and photocatalytic activity. Superhydrophilicity is obtained without UV light irradiation. Moreover, the ordered and aligned arrangement facilitates the potential application of hematite columnar arrays in field emitters. The controlled fabrication of the hematite hierarchical nanostructure arrays also promises future applications in the other areas of sensors, batteries, and catalytic oxidation.
