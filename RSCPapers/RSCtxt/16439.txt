    , Accepted 7th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) devices for solar water splitting require not only high solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency but also high chemical stability in strong acidic or alkaline electrolytes for long-term operation. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been considered as a highly promising protection layer to achieve high chemical stability for solar water splitting devices, especially for silicon based monolithic photovoltaic electrochemical (PV–EC) systems, while there is a trade-off relationship between activity and stability in these devices: the high charge transport barrier at the PV (silicon based thin film solar cells)/TiO2 interface and the high ohmic loss in TiO2 films hinder the device performance, especially when a thick TiO2 protection layer (preferred to enhance the chemical stability in the electrolyte) is used. Herein, we show that a hydrogen doped TiO2 protection layer can break this traditional trend to increase the activity without deteriorating the stability, when thick protection layers are employed to ensure stability. We demonstrated significant performance enhancement in hydrogenated amorphous silicon/silicon germanium (a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H) photocathodes through this approach. On one hand, the H-doping can shift up the Fermi level and reduce the electron transport barrier at the interface of the PV/TiO2 protection layer. On the other hand, the higher carrier density via H-doping leads to the enhancement of electron transport in TiO2 films and a shorter depletion layer barrier. Thus, the H-doping results in a higher photocurrent output at 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), indicating the high potential of the H-doped TiO2 protection layer for achieving stable and efficient monolithic solar water splitting devices.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen generation by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using sunlight is a promising approach to store solar energy in the form of chemical fuels.1–5 From a commercial application point of view, in addition to the necessity of high solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, PEC devices made from cheap earth-abundant elements with long-term chemical stability under operating conditions are highly desirable.6 Photovoltaic electrochemical (PV–EC) coupled configurations have been considered as an efficient way to achieve high STH conversion efficiency.7–13 This structure can effectively separate the PEC process into photoelectric (PE) and electrochemical (EC) processes, in which PV devices absorb sunlight and provide photovoltage to meet the demand of thermodynamic overpotential for EC water splitting.14 Various PV devices have been employed in water splitting, such as dye-sensitized (DSSC),15 perovskite,10,16,17 Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS),18 III–IV19,20 and silicon based solar cells.21–23 Among various PV driven water splitting devices, silicon based thin film (STF) solar cells have attracted much attention due to the material abundance,21,24 high spectral utilization properties because of the tunable band gap (1.1–1.8 eV), suitable band edge positions, high operating voltage and multiple light absorbing materials.13,25
However, the major limitation of STF solar cells is that the electrode materials can be easily oxidized in acidic solutions to form an insulating layer or corroded in alkaline electrolytes.26,27 In addition, the band edge pinning of the PV junction at the semiconductor liquid junction (SLJ) extremely reduces the operating photovoltage.28–30 Studies have shown that a passivation layer can efficiently suppress photogenerated charge recombination by surface state passivation, extract larger photovoltages,28,31 and protect the semiconductor from corrosion in the electrolyte. TiO2 is a promising candidate as the protection layer and passivation layer due to its good stability and surface passivation effect.28,32–34 Meanwhile, the TiO2 protection layer plays a positive role in electron transport from the PV component to the protection layer, and bulk transport during the TiO2 and electron transfer at the SLJ. However, the STH efficiency and stability are strongly dependent on the protection layer thickness due to the involved tunneling and bulk carrier transport mechanisms.32 Generally, a thick protection layer is a necessary condition to ensure stability which, unfortunately, will affect the tunneling of photogenerated charges, resulting in ohmic loss. A thin protection layer is favorable for charge transport but unable to afford extended stability during the water splitting process. There is a trade-off relationship between activity and stability. Several methods have been employed to solve this problem, including electronically leaky TiO2 films and Ni islands on the surface of the semiconductor30,35 and using a buried p+n silicon junction to remove the effect of the protection layer thickness.34,36 All of these solutions were focused on eliminating the effect of the protection layer thickness. However, not much attention has been focused on the high energy barrier at the interface of PV (STF solar cells with the p–i–n structure) and TiO2 (IST), and the conductivity of the protection layer which leads to serious electron recombination and deterioration of the device performance.
Based on the above considerations, we propose a new strategy, employing thick H-doped TiO2 (HTO) as the protection layer, to simultaneously reduce the energy barrier at the IST and solve the problem of the limited conduction of thick TiO2. At the same time, the stability has not been deteriorated. It has been confirmed that H-doping can efficiently improve electron density and shift the Fermi level of TiO2 toward the conduction band,37,38 leading to the decrease of the energy barrier at the IST. Further, the increased electron density benefits electron transport in TiO2 and transfer at the interface of the SLJ. In this paper, we report an effective room-temperature fabrication method to prepare high quality HTO films through adjusting the amount of doped hydrogen. The obtained HTO films can significantly enhance electrical conductivity and reduce the depletion layer width, resulting in the increase of the electron transport and transfer rates. Therefore, our prepared thick H-doped TiO2 layer is capable of acting as a protection layer on high quality absorbers to enhance their solar hydrogen evolution without deteriorating stability.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of the pristine TiO2 and HTO thin films
The pristine TiO2 thin films were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering from an intrinsic TiO2 target (99.999%) with a constant Ar gas flow (55 Sccm). The HTO thin films were prepared on a FTO glass substrate by introducing a H2 and Ar gas mixture into the chamber during the preparation process, and the doping concentration was tuned by the H2 flow. During the deposition process of the pristine TiO2 and HTO, the distance between the target and substrate was kept at 70 mm, and the sputtering power was kept at the optimal value of 350 W in order to avoid any possible damage to the a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells. The working pressure was held at 4.5 mTorr. The thickness of TiO2 films deposited on FTO was 200 nm. The pristine TiO2 and HTO protection layers (80 nm) were deposited on the n-type a-SiGe:H layer of a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells using the same technique as above.
2.2 Fabrication of a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells
The a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells were fabricated on textured aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) substrates. The textured AZO substrates were obtained by chemical wet-etching in 0.5% diluted HCl solution for 20 s to achieve suitable lateral and vertical feature sizes for excellent light trapping. The thickness of intrinsic layers for the a-Si:H top and a-SiGe:H bottom was 150 nm and 160 nm respectively, using radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD).
2.3 Materials characterization
The structural analysis is carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rikaku, ATX-XRD). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using a PHI5000 Versa Probe.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements of photocathodes (buried a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cell) without and with a TiO2 protective layer were performed in a three-electrode configuration immersed in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH = 13.6) under 1-sun conditions [AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2] using a dual-beam solar simulator (Wacom WXs-156s-l2). A Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the photocathode working electrode were used for the three-electrode configuration. The potential of the working electrode was controlled with a Princeton potentiostat (PARSTAT 4000).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a represents the typical PV–EC configuration schematic of the a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathode with the protection layer. In order to discover the existing problems more intuitively, Fig. 1b shows the schematic energy band diagram of a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/pristine TiO2 and the electrolyte under illumination in equilibrium. The energy band levels of a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H and pristine TiO2 are derived either from previous studies39,40 or calculated in this work later (more details are shown in Table 1). It can be easily seen that there are at least three issues for the pristine TiO2 as the protection layer. First, the pristine TiO2 has a much larger work function compared to n type a-SiGe:H. This big work function difference will induce band bending upwardly at the IST resulting in an electron transport energy barrier (ETB) and hinder electron transport. Second, the poor conductivity of pristine TiO2 will lead to ohmic loss during the electron transport process (more details about conduction properties are shown in Table 2). Third, the depletion layer width (WD) changes as a function of carrier density (ND). However, the carrier density of pristine TiO2 is 1.26 × 1019 cm−3 resulting in a broader depletion layer width, which is harmful to electron tunneling. To avoid these issues, we propose that HTO as the photocathode protection layer can efficiently improve electron transport, reduce the difference of the Fermi level between n type a-SiGe:H and the protection layer, and further decrease the ETB (Fig. 1c). HTO has properties of higher carrier density and a smaller work function, which lead to a smaller depletion layer width, electron transport resistance and ETB, respectively. Though a small ETB caused by the Fermi level difference of the HTO and electrolyte can be seen at the interface of the SLJ from Fig. 1c, it is too small to affect the electron tunneling. Thus, all of these will be beneficial for electron transport and improve STH efficiency.

In order to verify our hypothesis, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to measure the work function of amorphous pristine TiO2 and HTO films (confirmed by XRD in Fig. S1†). This method can accurately determine the work function because it does not depend on any experimental parameters except for the photo-energy of the UV source (in our case He I discharge at hν = 21.22 eV) which is known. Besides, the samples measured under ultrahigh vacuum conditions exclude any possibility of modified surface properties due to contamination. Fig. 2a shows the He I UPS spectrum of the pristine TiO2 and HTO in the kinetic energy scale. The spectrum was taken for −8.000 V sample bias so that the sample inelastic cutoff could be distinguished, which is observable in Fig. S2a† as a small peak near 2.3 eV and 2.5 eV for the pristine TiO2 and HTO, respectively. The actual positions of the inelastic cutoff and Fermi edge are also shown in Fig. S2,† which are determined as the center of the slopes as indicated with vertical lines. So the work function (φ) of the pristine TiO2 and HTO can be calculated according to the following equation φ = 21.22 + Vcutoff − EFermi(1)

The relationship between spectrum width hν, and work function φ is illustrated. (b) XPS valence band spectra of the pristine TiO2 and HTO materials prepared on FTO glass substrates. 
Finally, we obtain that the work function of the pristine TiO2 and HTO are 4.44 eV and 4.21 eV respectively. The smaller work function of the HTO benefits the reduction of the energy barrier at the IST and improve electron transport performance which confirms our hypothesis.
The valence band maximum (VBM) can't be bypassed due to its effect on electron recombination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful tool to investigate information on both the binding energy of a specific element and the total density of states (DOS) of the valence band. The XPS valence band spectra (Fig. 2b) collected from the pristine TiO2 and HTO films are similar and an estimate of the VBM by linear extrapolation to the baseline derives a band edge position of 2.05 eV below the Fermi energy for both the samples. So the VBM of the pristine TiO2 and HTO can be deduced as −6.49 eV and −6.26 eV vs. absolute vacuum level (AVL), respectively. The smaller VBM of HTO may be attributed to the surface disorder.41,42 Compared to the VBM (−5.5 eV vs. AVL) of n type a-SiGe:H, more negative VBM for the pristine TiO2 and HTO used as the photocathode protective layer can efficiently block hole transport and reduce the charge recombination at the IST.43
A Princeton potentiostat (PARSTAT 4000) was also employed to record the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and PEC measurements were carried out in a three-electrode configuration with an Ag/AgCl reference, Pt counter electrode, and working electrodes in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6) with a well-defined area of 0.283 cm2. The Mott–Schottky plot was conducted at a frequency of 5 kHz (Fig. 3a). Both of the pristine TiO2 and HTO exhibit positive slopes which are expected as n-type semiconductors. Interestingly, a considerably smaller slope is found for the HTO compared with pristine TiO2, suggesting an increased carrier density after the H-doping. The carrier density of the pristine TiO2 and HTO is listed in Table 2 as calculated from Mott–Schottky plots by fitting the equation Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(2)where e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of TiO2 (ε = 73),44ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, Nd the donor density, and V the applied bias at the electrode. The carrier density of the HTO film is two orders of magnitude larger than pristine TiO2. The larger electron density of HTO shifts the Fermi level upward to the conduction band, which is favorable for electron transport.37 The changing of the Fermi level is also confirmed by the flat potential (Vfb), which can be calculated by the following equation (3)where C and A are the interfacial capacitance and area, respectively, k is Boltzmann's constant, T the absolute temperature, and e the electronic charge. Therefore, the Vfb can be determined from the intercept between the linearly extrapolated line and x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot, which is estimated to be −0.88 and −1.12 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the pristine TiO2 and HTO, respectively. Thus, in the ideal situation, the work functions of pristine TiO2 and HTO can be deduced as −4.432 eV and −4.192 eV vs. AVL respectively (more calculative details are shown in the ESI†). Although there is a little different from the results of UPS which may be attributed to the disregarded VHpzzp (defined in the ESI†), the smaller work function (0.23–0.24 eV smaller than that of pristine TiO2) of HTO is verified. In addition, the higher carrier density of HTO can improve the conduction properties which benefits the electron transport.

The depletion layer width of protection layers is another key factor in determining electron tunneling. To understand the electron transport mechanism from the n type of a-SiGe:H to the protection layer and finally to the electrolyte, the WD of the protection layer at the interface of both the IST (WD1) and SLJ (WD2) can be determined using the following equations respectively (4)
From eqn (4), it is clear that the WD1 is a function of the ND. Therefore, the increased carrier density will shorten the WD1. What's more, the WD2 is also a function of the ND; a larger ND means a shorter depletion layer width. The Vfb can be ignored due to the great difference (three orders of magnitude) of the ND of the pristine TiO2 and HTO. The WD of the HTO protection layer at both the IST and SLJ becomes smaller than that of the pristine TiO2, proving larger carrier density and easier electron tunneling in HTO.
To confirm that the HTO protection layer can favor electron transport and transfer, EIS analyses were carried out. EIS is an efficient approach to present the processes of electron transport in TiO2 and transfer at the SLJ. Nyquist plots from the EIS measurements under illumination are shown in Fig. 3b and the fitting results are shown in Table 2. The equivalent circuit model (the inset diagram in Fig. 3b) consists of a series Rs resistance representing the capacity of charge transport in the FTO substrate and external circuit, Rtransport representing charge transport resistance in TiO2, Rct representing the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte, and a space charge capacitance Cbulk of the bulk materials and surface capacitance Ctrap. From Table 2, the Rtransport and Rct of HTO are significantly reduced, demonstrating the enhancement of charge transport (Rtransport) and charge transfer (Rct). These ascensions of HTO are derived from the increased carrier density.
To understand the origin of increased carrier density by hydrogen doping, XPS spectra of the pristine TiO2 and HTO films were measured as shown in Fig. 4. The Ti 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 4a) are identical to Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks centered at binding energies of 458.9 eV and 464.7 eV, which are consistent with the typical peak values of the Ti4+–O bonds in TiO2.45,46 A slightly broader peak located at 457.4 eV is found in HTO in comparison to the pristine TiO2, which is attributed to Ti–H bonds or named substitutional hydrogen (Ho).47 Ho can improve the carrier density by passivating dangling bonds, which are coordination defects that can act as shallow donors. It is worth noting that passivated dangling bonds are beneficial for electron transport and reduce carrier recombination. This can be confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Oxygen vacancies or Ti interstitial can act as recombination centers for free carriers. PL spectra are employed to understand the behavior of light generated electrons and holes since PL emission results from the recombination of free carriers. PL spectra measurements in the wavelength range of 350–640 nm with the excitation at 330 nm are performed, as shown in Fig. 4b. Compared with the pristine TiO2, the PL peak intensity of HTO is significantly decreased, which means a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes.
 Fig. 4  The XPS spectra of the pristine TiO2 and HTO. (a) Ti 2p XPS spectra. (b) PL spectra of pristine TiO2 and HTO films. (c) O 1s XPS spectra. The O 1s XPS spectrum of HTO can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.4 and 531.6 eV (dashed curves). 
The HTO sample also exhibits a broader O 1s XPS peak with a higher binding energy (Fig. 4c). The peak deconvolution of the O 1s XPS peak of the HTO sample reveals a typical peak at 530.4 eV that corresponds to Ti–O bonds and an additional peak at about 531.6 eV that corresponds to Ti–OH bonds as a result of interstitial hydrogen (Hi). The energy levels of Ti–OH–Ti and Ti–OH have been reported to be located at 2.6 and 0.7 eV below the valence band respectively. These states are energetically stable and can't be oxidized by the valence band holes via electron transfer. This can efficiently improve the stability of HTO films. In short, all the results above indicate that hydrogen doping will passivate oxygen vacancies or Ti interstitial, and suppress recombination of free carriers. The enhancement of electrical conductivity is mainly attributed to the formed Ti–H and Ti–OH bonds after hydrogen doping. The stability of HTO is improved greatly due to Ti–OH–Ti and Ti–OH bonds.
Finally, to test the effect of H doping TiO2 strategy, HTO coupled with a STF solar cell system was built for water splitting with solar light. a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells had high open circuit voltages (1.68 V shown in Fig. S3†) and were employed as the light absorption elements that absorb incident light, produce photo-generated carriers, separate and transport the carriers by the internal electric field to the protection layer/electrolyte interface and then reduce the electrolyte. The corresponding illuminated three-electrode voltammograms were measured in a three-electrode configuration for unprotected, pristine TiO2 protected, and HTO protected a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes (Fig. 5a). The thicknesses of the pristine TiO2 and HTO protection layers are both 80 nm. Compared to the unprotected a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathode (Eon = 0.8 V vs. RHE), an obvious positive shift of the onset potential Eon (1.58 V vs. RHE) for water reduction can be clearly seen in the pristine TiO2 and HTO protected a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes, where the potential vs. Ag/AgCl can be converted into the potential vs. RHE as follows: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0Ag/AgCl (=0.197 V) + 0.0591 × pH(5)

(a) Three-electrode voltammograms of the unprotected, pristine TiO2 protected, and HTO protected a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes under illumination. The insets show the corresponding photographs of the solar cells. (b) Chronoamperometry J–t curves of the HTO and pristine TiO2 protected a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes measured at 0 V vs. RHE. 
In the meantime, the HTO protected photocathode shows a higher cathodic current density (−5.51 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE) than the pristine TiO2 protected one (−4.61 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE), suggesting that the HTO protected photocathode shows improved charge transport and transfer efficiency. This result is mainly attributed to the following three factors. First, the smaller ETB at the interface between the a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes and HTO protective layer after equilibration which is beneficial for electron transport and smaller interfacial recombination. Secondly, the increased catalytic activity facilitates the charge transfer at the SLJ interface which can be confirmed by the reduced Rct. Last but not least, better conductivity and a shorter depletion layer width barrier are beneficial to carrier transport and restrain carrier recombination. All of these issues are believed to contribute to the larger current density of the STF device with the HTO protection layer. It is noted that the pristine TiO2 protected photocathode shows lower saturation current density at a negative bias voltage (below −0.3 V vs. RHE) than the unprotected photocathode. This might be due to the high ETB at the interface of PV (n type a-SiGe:H) and pristine TiO2.
The stability of illuminated a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes with the HTO and pristine TiO2 protection layer was evaluated during 300 min operation in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The chronoamperometry J–t curves measured at 0 V vs. RHE were recorded as shown in Fig. 5b. As expected, the a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathodes with thick HTO and pristine TiO2 protection layers exhibit excellent stability in alkaline solutions. It is worth noting that the HTO protected photocathode demonstrates sharp spikes and higher photocurrent density than a pristine TiO2 protected one (see the magnified view in Fig. S4†). The higher sharp spikes of the HTO protected photocathode than those of the pristine TiO2 protected photocathode are caused by the higher photocurrent density. Meanwhile, the higher photocurrent density of the HTO protected photocathode further confirmed that the HTO protection layer can transport more electrons to the interface of the SLJ as discussed above. A slight degradation can be found for both photocathodes, which is mainly caused by the light-induced degradation of a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells under prolonged illumination.48,49 In a simple statement, all these results demonstrate the great potential of HTO conductive protection layers in forming highly stable and efficient solar-water-splitting devices.
4. Conclusion
In summary, in this work three problems in the pristine TiO2 protection layer coupled PV photocathode configurations are addressed: the high ETB at the interface of the PV device and protection layer, the poor electrical conductivity of the protective layer and the broader depletion layer width barrier. These problems have been solved successfully by preparing the as-grown HTO protection layer at room temperature with a scalable and matured magnetron sputtering process. By hydrogen doping, HTO attains a smaller work function to reduce the ETB at the IST, superior electrical conductivity and better catalytic activity in comparison to the pristine TiO2. As a result, the WD was efficiently reduced and the electron transport was largely promoted. Applying the developed HTO in the high-photovoltage a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem photocathode, the traditional trade-off trend between activity and stability was successfully resolved. The combination of our developed HTO with a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H tandem solar cells efficiently improves the current output of the photocathode without deteriorating the stability. More importantly, efficient hydrogen doping into TiO2 at room temperature opens up a new way to prepare hydrogenated TiO2 and considerably expands the range of practical applications of this material.
