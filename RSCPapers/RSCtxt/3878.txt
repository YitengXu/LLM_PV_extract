    , Accepted 15th January 2022First published on 17th January 2022AbstractHeterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising strategy for addressing the worldwide energy shortage and environmental pollution issues. Due to the dependence of catalytic properties on their composition, size and shape, rational design can improve the utilization efficiency and catalytic performance of iridium oxide for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here we have induced a cube to rod transition in nanostructured iridium oxide (NIO) by tuning the salt to precursor ratio in the molten salt synthesis (MSS) process. Furthermore, we have compared the electrocatalytic performance of these NIOs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media with that of commercial IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and its annealed derivative in terms of specific capacitance, total charge, most accessible charge, electrochemically active surface area, and roughness factor. Our NIOs synthesized using the MSS process showed enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 media compared to the commercial IrO2 NPs before and after annealing. A facile single-step synthesis of the IrO2 nanocubes and nanorods has been demonstrated and an electrochemical investigation suggested that the IrO2 nanorods exhibit the highest catalytic activities among all NIOs due to their high electrochemically active surface area, low charge transfer coefficient, high current density, high electrochemical stability, high accessibility to active sites and low overpotential, while the annealed commercial IrO2 NPs showed the worst performance. Our studies show a simple, reliable and scalable synthesis method from iridium tetrachloride salt to make shape tunable electrocatalytic NIOs which possess enhanced OER activity compared to commercial samples in acidic media.
1. Introduction
Energy requirements and consumption have increased continuously all over the world since 1850.1 Due to the soon-to-be-depleted fossil energy sources, current scientific studies are paying great attention to the conversion and storage of renewable energy, especially using hydrogen which is an ecofriendly and recyclable energy carrier that can be used as a replacement of traditional fuels.2 Designing efficient electro-/photo-catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to enhance the commercial viability of several electrochemical technologies such as water electrolysis, carbon dioxide reduction, metal–air batteries, and solar to fuel production is a challenging and demanding undertaking for scientists, which requires extensive and collaborative physico-chemical approaches.3–7
Several electrode materials based on iridium oxide (IrO2) are considered effective OER/HER electrocatalysts with appreciable current at low overpotentials that can support highly efficient fuel technologies. Nanostructured IrO2 (NIO) is reported to be among the best electrocatalysts for the OER for hydrogen-generating water-splitting devices.8–10 Moreover, NIO has been proved to possess enhanced electrocatalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline media.11 The electrochemical activity of NIO is highly dependent on particle characteristics such as size, shape, and synthesis protocol.
Shape-controlled nanosized catalysts are extremely fascinating materials owing to their highly attractive physical, electrical and chemical properties.12,13 As a result, there are intensive ongoing research activities to design shape-controlled nanomaterials pertaining to metals, metal alloys, metal oxides, etc.3,12,13 Lots of work has been carried out in the past decade, particularly in the area of property dependence of nanostructured metal oxides on their shape, size and facets. For example, Bai et al. carried out facet-dependent photocatalytic N2 fixation of Bi-Rich Bi5O7I nanosheets, and Huang and colleagues showed how the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O nanocrystals is influenced when its structure is changed from cubic to rhombic dodecahedral.14,15 Freitas et al. demonstrated the efficient electrocatalytic properties of the IrO2 sub-monolayer on Au nanoflowers.16 Kuo and coworkers showed the facet dependent catalytic properties of IrO2 (1110) towards the OER.17 Shim et al. and Liu et al. highlighted the superior electrocatalytic properties of hierarchical IrO2 nanowires and IrO2@NiO nanoflakes, respectively.18,19 Kim et al. reported the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of IrO2 nanoneedles.20 Our group also investigated the electrocatalytic behavior of IrO2 nanorods towards the OER and HER.21 Nanocubes are considered an excellent architectural evolution in nanotechnology owing to their compact dimensions and large surface/volume ratio. Co3O4 was also shown to have extraordinary credentials as an electrocatalyst for the OER as reported by Tung et al.22
Most NIO materials are commonly synthesized by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Furthermore, a variety of NIOs have been produced using other suitable strategies such as a phase transport process,23 electrochemical synthesis,24 arc vaporization,25 a hydrothermal method,26 reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS),27 a sol–gel method,28 a wet chemistry method,29 an Adams fusion method,30 a sulfite complex route,31 through thermal decomposition of a precursor (H2IrCl6),32 and oleylamine-mediated synthesis,9etc. However, all these synthesis techniques for NIOs require expensive, complex, unstable and not-environmentally-friendly iridium-containing precursors. In addition, some of the processes involve tedious synthetic procedures with complicated experimental setups. On the other hand, as demonstrated in the past two decades, the molten salt synthesis (MSS) process is a cost-effective, stable, and eco-friendly method compared to those mentioned above.33,34 There are several other transition metal oxide-based catalysts that have demonstrated efficient bifunctional electro-catalytic activities for the OER and ORR.35–37
In this work, we have synthesized NIOs using MSS and tuned their morphology by compositional variation of the molten salt used. The interesting part is that we could design NIO nanocubes and nanorods by changing the ratio of IrCl4:NaCl:KCl in the MSS. More importantly, the electrocatalytic performance of these NIOs by MSS for the OER was investigated systematically and compared with that of commercial NIO and its annealed derivative in terms of specific capacitance, total charge, most accessible charge, electrochemically active surface area, and roughness factor. The as-synthesized NIOs showed enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity compared to the commercial IrO2 NPs before and after annealing. Therefore, this study proves that the MSS method is a novel and desirable method, even when using simple iridium tetrachloride salt, to make electrocatalytic IrO2 nanostructures with variable morphologies, which possess enhanced OER activity compared to their commercial counterparts in acidic media.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and method
The following reagents were used in the synthesis of three NIOs using the MSS process: IrCl4 (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%), NaCl (Alfa Aesar, 99.0%), and KCl (Sigma Aldrich, 99.0%). These three NIOs were prepared using the MSS process following our previous procedure with minor modification.21 Specifically, the precursor and salts were used with a molar ratio (MR) of 1:10:10, 1:30:30, and 1:60:60 of IrCl4:NaCl:KCl and then ground together with an agate mortar and pestle for 20 minutes. The resulting mixture was transferred to a covered rectangular crucible and kept at 650 °C for 12 h in a programmable high temperature furnace with a heating and cooling rate of 5 °C min−1 in air. The resulting products were washed several times with de-ionized water and then dried at 80 °C overnight in an oven. Based on the three used molar ratios of the precursor IrCl4 to NaCl and KCl, the three as-prepared NIOs were labeled IO1 (MR = 1:10:10), IO2 (MR = 1:30:30) and IO3 (MR = 1:60:60), respectively. Commercial IrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) from Sigma Aldrich (99.9%, CAS# 12030-49-8) were used to compare the electrocatalytic activity with our as-synthesized NIOs. The commercial IrO2 NPs and its derivative by further calcination at 650 °C for 6 h in air with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1 were denoted as IO4 and IO5, respectively.
2.2. Materials characterization
The resulting fine black colored powders of the five NIOs were characterized initially using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. Diffraction patterns were recorded with a step size and scan speed of 0.01° and 1° min−1, respectively, on an aluminum sample holder. Raman scattering data were recorded by employing back-scattering geometries on a Bruker SENTERRA RAMAN microscope with a 20× objective lens of an optical microscope. The excitation line (785 nm) of an Ar+ laser beam was focused to a spot size of 5 μm with a laser power of 25 mW. The spectral resolution range used was 3–5 cm−1 with an integration time of 100 s. Morphological analysis of the NIOs was carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Sigma VP, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) operated at 5 kV. The chemical composition and oxidation state of the NIOs were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific™ K-Alpha™ XPS system).
2.3. Electrode preparation and electrochemical measurement
A three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration was used to obtain the electrochemical measurements. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode with an area of 0.5024 cm2, platinum wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. To prepare the working electrodes, we first prepared catalyst inks by dispersing one of the five powder catalysts as the active electrocatalytic material (1 mg) in 362 μL water and mixing with 57 μL Nafion solution before sonicating for 20 minutes to obtain the ink mixtures. For electrochemical measurements of each of the five NIO samples, 42 μL of the prepared electrocatalytic slurry was pipetted onto the surface of the glassy carbon electrode (which corresponds to 0.38 mg of the active catalyst material per cm2 of glassy carbon electrode), followed by drying overnight in a vacuum oven.38 Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammogram (CV) and linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 using an Autolab potentiostate/galvanostate (PGSTAT302) with Nova 10.11 software. Nitrogen gas was purged for 10 minutes prior to the electrochemical measurements to remove the dissolved air from the electrolyte. Current density was evaluated as a function of applied voltage ranging from 0 to 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at scan rates of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV s−1 for cyclic voltammetry characterization, while linear sweep voltammetry was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 for all five electrocatalysts in terms of their OER performance.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical characterization

3.1.1 PXRD patterns and Raman spectra. 
The phase purity of the as-synthesized NIOs and commercial NIOs before and after annealing was characterized using PXRD (Fig. 1a). The observed reflections from IO1, IO2, IO3 and IO5 could be perfectly indexed with the peaks of (110), (101), (200), (111), (210) and (211) as the rutile phase of IrO2 with a tetragonal crystal structure (JCPDS file # 88-0288) while the commercial IrO2 NPs were found to be amorphous in nature owing to the absence of sharp reflections. The Raman spectra of the five samples (Fig. 1b) show three characteristic bands at 560, 720 and 740 cm−1, assigned to the first order Eg, B2g and A1g bands of the rutile IrO2 structure, respectively.27 The Raman spectrum of the IO5 samples showed an extra peak around 437 cm−1, which could be due to impurities in the commercial IrO2 NPs as proven by the XRD patterns of IO4 and IO5 which showed an extra peak at 2θ = 40.7°.

The chemical nature of the as-synthesized NIOs and commercial NIOs before and after annealing was further characterized through XPS analysis (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).39 The XPS core-level spectra of both Ir 4f and O 1s of the NIOs depicted asymmetric profiles which have been proved to be an intrinsic property of IrO2.40 The Ir 4f peaks of the NIOs are located at 62.2 and 64.8 eV, which are close to IrO24f7/2 (61.7 eV) and 4f5/2 (64.7 eV) confirming the existence of iridium in the +4 oxidation state.40 The XPS profile and peak position do not have obvious changes for all five NIO samples. The O 1s peak of the NIOs depicted dual bands positioned at 530.1 and 531.5 eV, which can be ascribed to lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies (OVs), respectively.41 The OV density is different in these five NIO samples; it is prevalent in IO1 and gradually decreases from IO2 and IO3 to IO5. Though it is difficult to quantify OVs due to the very nature of the XPS O 1s peak, the commercial IO4 sample did not show the presence of OVs.


3.1.2 Morphology. 
Based on the SEM images of the five NIOs (Fig. 2), sample IO1 is composed of IrO2 nanocubes, sample IO2 of a mixture of IrO2 nanocubes and nanorods, IO3 predominately consists of nanorods with diameters ranging from 8–20 nm,21 the commercial IrO2 NPs (IO4) of spherical particles with an average size of ∼60 nm, and annealed commercial IrO2 NPs (IO5) of agglomerated spherical particles with an average size of ∼60 nm. During the MSS, various processing parameters affect the composition, size and morphology of the products, such as the concentration of precursors, identity of precursors, nature of salts, the ratio of precursors to salts, and the solubility of precursors in molten salts.42,43 For example, Rorvik et al. reported that sodium chloride played a significant role in the nucleation and growth of the nanorods of ternary oxides in the MSS while no rod-shaped products were formed without the addition of sodium chloride.42 In this article, we observed the morphology evolution from nanocubes to nanorods from the MSS of NIOs with eutectic NaCl and KCl as the molten salt in different ratios to the used iridium precursor. Specifically, on changing the MR of IrCl4:NaCl:KCl from 1:10:10 to 1:30:30 and then to 1:60:60, the morphological evolution of the NIOs is from nanocubes to nanorods. The same can be ascribed to the different extents of surface and interfacial energies between the IrCl4 precursor and the NaCl and KCl molten salt mixture during the synthesis of IO1, IO2 and IO3, resulting in the particle shapes with minimum energy by forming the NIOs with different morphologies.43 The growth of nanostructures in the MSS process involves interfacial reactions via liquid transport which are known to possess high fluidity and rate.44 A possible explanation for the shape evolution of these nanoparticles can be understood by the limited presence of molten salt. Molten salts not only act as solvents above their melting temperatures but also serve as protective layers to prevent agglomeration or coalescence of the formed particles due to charged surface layers. When the molten salts used in the MSS are in excess (e.g., 1:60:60), IrO2 nanorods are obtained as all growth directions except one are blocked by the presence of excess salts. However, when the amount of salt added was the minimum amount (e.g. 1:10:10), IrO2 nanocubes were made as all the possible growth directions were available equivalently during the MSS. A controlled experiment where the MR salts used were between 1:60:60 and 1:10:10, i.e. 1:30:30, actually resulted in a mixture of IrO2 nanocubes and nanorods suggesting the growth mechanism is possibly controlled by the limited presence of molten salts used in the synthesis. Similarly, Cai et al. observed thermally induced transformation of nanocubes into nanorods of NIOs along with the formation of induced defects and aggregates owing to the preferred growth of IrO2 along the [110] axis leading to the formation of rod-like morphology at a high synthesis temperature.45 Along the same vein but for different metal oxide nanostructures, Huang et al. tuned the shape of NiFe2O4 by altering the MR during the MSS and found that a lower MR led to the formation of nanosized octahedra whereas an increased MR resulted in the formation of nanosheets.46

3.2. Electrochemical characterization

Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of all five NIO electrocatalysts when used in 0.5 M H2SO4 supporting electrolyte in the potential range of 0.0–1.2 V (versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at 20 mV s−1. The generated currents from these five electrocatalyst modified working electrodes were normalized to the geometric area of the working electrode. These cyclic voltammograms exhibit the characteristic shape of IrO2. The presence of anodic and cathodic peaks corresponds to the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox transition at 0.77 V and 0.5 V (vs. RHE) and indicates a reversible reaction.47 Moreover, of the five NIO electrocatalysts, IO3 with the nanorod morphology possessed the highest current density while IO5 showed the lowest current density. This could be ascribed to the high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the nanorod-shaped IO3 sample which was calculated and is tabulated in Table 2. The variation of current density from the NIOs will be discussed in the next section.

(b) Nyquist plots of the five NIO-based electrodes plus the blank one as a comparison. Scan rate dependency of voltammetric charges by extrapolating (c) the total charges () and (d) the most accessible charges () for all five NIO samples. 
The Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra from these five NIO modified electrodes plus the glassy carbon used as the blank electrode (Fig. 3b) showed that the blank (no NIO active material), IO1, IO2, IO3, IO4 and IO5 modified glassy carbon electrodes had charge transfer resistance values (Rct) of 912, 365, 186, 135, 270 and 553 Ω, respectively. Rct calculated from the electrochemical impedance spectrum indicated that IO3 with the nanorod morphology possessed the smallest Rct of 135 Ω, which was much lower than the commercial IrO2 samples of IO4 and IO5. These results indicate the high charge transport efficiency from the glassy carbon electrode to the NIOs, and particularly that the IO3 nanorods are a promising catalyst for practical applications. This observation can be ascribed to the intrinsic high aspect ratio of the rod-like morphology which endowed the largest interfacial contact area in the fabricated electrode with the highest conductivity compared with the other four samples, and correspondingly IO3 possessed the best electrocatalytic OER performance among the five samples.
To determine the electrode capacity of all five electrocatalytic NIOs, capacitance measurements were performed at the electrode/catalyst interface to determine their charge accumulation. The two electrochemical reactions, i.e. faradaic process and proton absorption, are not associated at the potential range of 0 to 1.2 V for the NIOs. Therefore, to avoid faradaic contribution, here we calculated the specific capacitance (C in F g−1) from our NIO samples by integrating the CV curves between 0 and 1.2 V vs. RHE taken at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV s−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†) using eqn (1) below: (1)where ν is the scan rate (V s−1), m is the mass of the catalysts (in milligrams) deposited on the working electrode, E1 and E2 are the potential limits of the integration curves, and  is the integration of the voltammetric curve. The obtained specific capacitance values are summarized in Table 1. For all five NIO electrocatalysts, the specific capacitance values decreased with increasing scan rate (Fig. S4, ESI†) indicating the quasi-stationary mode of double layer formation.48,49 The specific capacitance values increased due to the charge accumulated on the surface of the active sites at lower scan rates and the higher oxidation state of Ir in the NIOs.50 At high scan rates, due to limited migration of the electrolytic ions, some active surface areas become inaccessible for charge storage. Moreover, the specific capacitance values of IO5 and IO4 were lower than those of IO1, IO2 and IO3. In general, the specific capacitance values of IO4 were higher than those of IO5. On the other hand, the specific capacitance values (63 and 43 F g−1) of IO3 were slightly lower than those of IO1 (67 and 45 F g−1) at 100 and 200 mV s−1, which probably occurred due to the morphology change leading to lower charge accessibility.51 Overall, the obtained specific capacitance values followed the order of IO3 > IO2 > IO1 > IO5 > IO4.

To improve the charge accumulation, it is important to increase the number of actives sites but also their accessibilities. The specific double-layer capacitances revealed that the IO3 sample with the nanorod morphology possessed a much higher accessible surface area for electrochemical reactions. For the IO3 sample, the presence of a well-defined nanorod shape on the catalyst surface could confer a high concentration of active site at the interface of the electrolyte and the active electrocatalyst plus high oxidation state changes, and therefore improved capacitive properties.21 The IO2 sample showed the next highest capacitance values due to its mixed morphology of nanorods and nanocubes in the active electrocatalyst.
Generally the number of active sites or the active surface area of catalyst is considered to be proportional to voltammetry charges q*.52 Calculation of q* can be done following the process as demonstrated by Thomas et al.53,54 Briefly, it consists of averaging the anodic and cathodic charges measured between 0.4 and 1.1 V (vs. RHE) shown in Table S1 (ESI†) by following eqn (2) below: (2)
Ardizzone and coworkers further established two relations as eqn (3) and (4), which depend on the basis of diffusion species phenomena at the electrode/electrolyte interface depending on the scan rate.51Eqn (3) and (4) determine the total charges () and the most accessible charges () when the scan rate approaches 0 and ∞, respectively.55 (3) (4)where q* is the calculated average charge for different scan rates (between 1 to 200 mV s−1), C1 and C2 are constants, and v is the scan rate. The total charges  and most accessible charges  values for the five NIO samples are summarized in Table 2. These values were derived by extrapolating the linear part of the curves presented in Fig. 3c and d based on eqn (3) and (4), respectively.

Based on the calculated values in Table 2, the  values of the IO2 and IO5 samples were the lowest, lower than that of IO1, and much lower than those of IO4 and IO3. The highest value for the outermost accessible charge  was obtained from IO3 (7.42 mC), followed by those obtained from IO5 (2.6 mC), IO2 (2.1 mC), IO1 (2.3 mC), and then IO4 (4.1 mC). Furthermore, with the help of the  and  values, the accessibility of the active sites was analyzed using the ratio of / and also tabulated in Table 2. From the data, it is clearly seen that the highest accessibility of active sites based on the / value was from the IO3 sample (1.002), followed by the IO2, IO5, and IO4 samples, whereas the IO1 sample (0.775) had the lowest value. Surprisingly, after annealing the commercial IrO2 NPs, the IO5 sample had a slightly higher accessibility of active sites of / than the IO4 one. Overall, the analogy established from the capacitance measurements was therefore confirmed, i.e. smaller particles have a larger active site density to facilitate efficient charge accumulation in catalysts.48 The nanorod-shaped IO3 sample provided the highest number of accessible active sites in the electrocatalytic layer, which was probably due to the highest concentration of active sites on the surface of the IrO2 nanorods.
3.3 Electrochemical stability
The long-term stability of NIOs as OER electrocatalysts under severe electrochemical conditions is critical for their commercialization. To evaluate the electrochemical activity and stability of the NIOs, repetitive CVs were taken.56,57 More specifically, 50 voltametric cycles (Fig. 4a–e) were carried out between 0.0 and 1.2 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at 20 mV s−1 for all five NIO samples to determine their aging performance in long-term stability tests through current density. It was observed that the voltammogram shape did not change significantly for these samples during the long-term cycling.

(f) Variation of the measured charge (q*) with cycling number from all five NIO samples during the stability measurements (the enlarged portion of the image is shown in Fig. S5a, ESI†). 
During the long-term stability tests there was no alteration of the CV shapes observed for the five NIO electrocatalyst samples indicating that there was no variation in their structure which contributed to the double layer. Moreover, the current density value decreased after the first few cycles and then tended to stabilize. During the stability test performed with CV, there were no extra peaks observed in the anodic and cathodic current densities indicating the high stability of the NIOs. The CV cycles of IO1, IO2, IO4 and IO5 overlapped between the 5th and 10th cycles, while for IO3, the overlapping started as soon as the 5th cycle was reached (Fig. 4a–e). The initial decreasing catalytic performance could be due to the loss of active sites at the catalytic layer through current evolution during the stability test. As a crucial parameter, charges q* were also calculated for all five NIOs to evaluate the loss of active sites and their electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 4f). In concurrence with the CV cycling observation in Fig. 4a–e, the charges decreased somehow during the first 5–10 cycles (Fig. 4f and Fig. S5a, ESI†). Especially for the IO1, IO4 and IO5 samples, an obvious decrease of q* happened until the 10th cycle, whereas for the IO2 and IO3 catalysts, the decrease was found to be less obvious and only slightly occurred during the first five cycles only. Moreover, the q* value of the IO3 sample tended to reach the most stable behavior over the fifty cycles.
The number of active sites (q*/) is considered to be proportional to the charges at the catalytic layer and can be quite useful in determining the active site losses with respect to cycle number (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The existing active sites of the initial charges for IO1, IO2, and IO3 after 50 cycles were 84%, 92%, and 95%, and those for IO4 and IO5 were 92% and 86%, respectively. The fact that no obvious change in the CV profile was observed during the stability test meant that the variation of the measured charge with cycling number could be assigned to catalytic layer degradation due to leaching of the catalyst at the interface with the electrolyte.58 It was observed that the IO3 sample had improved stability over the other samples in acidic media, which might be due to the good interaction between the unique IrO2 nanorods and the electrolyte at the double layer.
3.4 Electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and electrocatalytic OER performance
The ECSA for each NIO sample was determined from the electrochemical double-layer capacitance of the catalytic surface.59 The electrochemical capacitance was determined by measuring the non-faradaic capacitive current associated with double-layer charging from the scan-rate dependent CV curves (Fig. S3, ESI†).59,60 Ideal OER catalysts are considered to have a low overpotential, large stability window, and high specific activity (or low surface area).61Table 2 shows the ECSA value for all five NIO catalyst samples. The ECSA value of IO3 was found to be the highest (11400 cm2) which indicates that it is the best electrocatalyst for the OER and this is further supported by its lowest charge transfer coefficient, highest current density, highest electrochemical stability, highest accessibility of active sites, and lower overpotential.
The OER at the NIO modified electrode surface can be introduced with reference to the Ir metal cation presented at the surface as active sites (MIr) which are produced during the electrochemical catalyst/electrolyte interface formation. This electrochemical reaction is governed by electrosorption of OH− and the formation of a series of metal–oxygen intermediates such as MIr–OO, MIr–OH, MIr–OOH, etc.62,63 The following reactions are representations of metal cations on the active surface (S) interacting with a water molecule leading to the evolution of oxygen molecules.64,65MIr + OH− → MIr − OH + e−MIr − OH + OH− → MIr − O + H2O + e−MIr − O + OH− → MIr − OOH + e−MIr − OOH + OH− → MIr − OO + H2O + e−MIr − OO → MIr + O2
According to Viruthasalam et al., metal cations can be those oxidized and/or reduced during an electrochemical reaction over a modified electrode.65 Here in our NIO system under study, the M ion is Ir in the form of Ir3+ and Ir4+ during the OER reaction according to the preceding OER representations.66
The OER activity was tested initially by rotating disk electrode voltammetry (RDEV) at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. The slow scan rate of 0.05 mV s−1 was enough to get steady-state behavior at the electrode surface, and the rotation rate of 1600 rpm was too fast for product removal while resisting bubble formation from the evolved O2 at the electrode surface. To evaluate the electrocatalytic properties of all five NIO samples toward the OER and their behavior during this reaction, LSV measurements were performed in this study as shown in Fig. 5a. The horizontal dashed line at 10 mA cm−2 per geometric area is the current density needed for a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device.67–69 The overpotential required to reach this current density is considered a critical parameter for evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of different catalysts.69,70 Furthermore, the current density was first normalized to the geometric surface area of the working electrode to compare the catalytic performance of the NIO samples as the same mass amount of all five NIOs was deposited on the glassy carbon electrode.

It is well-known that a low OER onset potential of an electrode material is highly beneficial for the water splitting reaction. From the LSV curves, the onset potential for the OER was measured to be 1.56, 1.05, 0.65, and 1.09 V for the IO1, IO2, IO3 and IO4 samples, respectively. Our results clearly suggest that IO3 with a nanorod morphology is an efficient OER catalyst followed by the IO2 composed of a mixture of nanorods and nanocubes. From the LSV curves obtained with a catalyst loading of 38 mg cm−2, IO3 exhibited significantly higher OER activity compared with the other four samples. IO1 and IO5 showed poor OER activity owing to the low current density of 7.5 mA cm−2 and 3.9 mA cm−2 (with respect to the geometric area of the GC substrate electrode) compared to IO2, IO3 and IO4. At the potential of 0.37 V, the current density of the IO3 electrode was ∼84.1 mA cm−2 whereas IO2 and IO5 showed potentials of 33.5 mA cm−2 at 0.79 V and 21.2 mA cm−2 at 0.82 V, respectively. Table S2 shows a comparison of the OER activity of the IrO2 samples reported by different groups with ours. This table also clearly indicates that our IO3 as nanorods had superior catalytic activity among the other samples for the OER with a high current density of 84.1 mA cm−2.

Fig. 5b displays the overpotentials and corresponding Tafel slopes of all five NIO samples. IO3 showed the lowest over-potential (0.65 V) with the lowest Tafel slope of 110 mV per decay indicating the IO3 sample was the best electrocatalyst followed by IO2 which showed a Tafel slope of 125 mV per decay at an overpotential of 1.05. On the other hand, IO1 showed a Tafel slope of 152 mV s−1 at an overpotential of 1.56 V, IO4 showed a Tafel slope of 143 mV per decay at an overpotential of 1.08 V, and IO5 was the most inferior OER electrocatalyst with a Tafel slope of 184 mV per decay at an overpotential of 1.6 V. In general, a Tafel slope with 120 mV per decay as the high over-potential and 40 mV per decay as the low overpotential stipulates that a simple charge transfer controlled reaction occurs at the catalyst/electrolyte interface while one greater than 120 mV per decay indicates that there are side reactions taking place as well. Lodi et al. observed that a tightly packed catalyst over the electrode surface led to a higher value of Tafel slope than the loosely packed catalyst.64 According to the obtained Tafel slope values obtained in this study, it is believed that the IO1, IO4 and IO5 samples followed a different kinetic model compared to the IO2 and IO3 samples. Fig. 5c shows that the IO3 sample had the lowest overpotential with the lowest Tafel slope among all NIO samples at 10 mA cm−2 while Fig. 5d shows the corresponding overpotential histograms. This OER activity difference is in good agreement with the difference in the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) for all five NIO catalyst samples estimated with the CV charges, indicating that the activity difference between all five NIO catalyst samples mainly resulted from the difference in ECSA.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we reported the design of shape tunable NIOs by varying the salt to precursor ratio in the MSS and investigated their electrochemical performance in comparison with commercial NIOs before and after annealing. LSV measurements showed higher electrocatalytic activity for the OER of our synthesized NIO compared to the commercial NIOs before and after annealing. The as-synthesized NIO sample with the nanorod shape developed in the present study exhibited the smallest onset potential, the lowest Tafel slope, the highest current density, and the largest electrochemically active surface area among all five studied NIO samples highlighting its potential as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. In conclusion, facile synthesis, high catalytic activity and electrochemical stability make the NIOs with a nanorod shape highly promising for clean energy applications.
