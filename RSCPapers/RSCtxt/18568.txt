    , Accepted 7th July 2011First published on 22nd August 2011AbstractPlants have evolved highly sophisticated light-harvesting mechanisms that allow for increased environmental tolerances and robustness, enhanced photo-efficiencies and prolonged lifetimes. These mechanisms incorporate the dynamic, cyclic self-assembly of proteins necessary for continual plant regeneration. Synthetic solar conversion devices, on the other hand, are designed to be static devices. Material and processing costs continue to be important constraints for commercial devices, and the earth abundance of requisite elements have become a recent concern. One potential solution to these problems lies in the development of biomimetic solar conversion devices that take advantage of the low material costs, negative carbon footprint, material abundance and dynamic self-assembly capabilities of photosynthetic proteins. Although research in this area is ongoing, this review is intended to give a brief overview of current biomimetic strategies incorporated into light-harvesting and energy-conversion mechanisms of synthetic solar devices, as well as self-repair and regeneration mechanisms adapted from plant-based processes.Ardemis A.

Introduction
To become widespread for energy generation, solar cells must satisfy four essential criteria: efficiency, stability, cost effectiveness, and material availability. Although several solar cells to date meet, or even exceed, several of these criteria, the existence of a device that meets all these criteria remains an objective for scientific research. Mono-crystalline silicon-based solar cells,1–4 for instance, demonstrate efficiencies approaching the Shockley-Queisser limits of 33.7%5 with stabilities on the order of decades.6 The abundance in material availability, however, is offset by the relatively high processing costs affiliated with silicon purification.2,7 Thin-film technologies,8–13 which offer low-cost alternatives to silicon-based energy devices, tend to suffer from lack of material abundance14 and lower device efficiencies.15–17
Ongoing research in this area focuses on not only improving existing technologies by lowering processing costs,18–22 replacing scarce, high-cost, or unstable materials23–26 and enhancing device efficiencies,27–29 but also developing devices that are entirely new to the field by utilizing new materials27,30,31 or alternative mechanisms27,32,33 for solar energy conversion. Among the most promising of these candidates is the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC),34,35 which incorporates a Ru-based dye reminiscent of natural dyes found in the chlorophyll of plants. Like several solar cells that seek to minimize processing costs via self-assembling mechanisms,36,37 DSSCs rely on self-assembly of the Ru dye for solar cell fabrication.38–41 Though demonstrating promising efficiencies of up to 11%,42,43 limitations in Ru availability14 and the replacement of unstable, liquid-based electrolytic cells26,44–47 are the focus of ongoing research in this field.
This brief overview in solar cell technology outlines key transitions recurring in research developments: the transition from the inorganic to the organic realm,27,48,49 from rigid and static to thin, flexible, dynamic technologies,50,51 from high-cost, high efficiency to low-cost, low efficiency devices.7,52 These transitions parallel the underlying tendency of the field towards the utilization of biomimetic strategies for solar energy conversion.
In this review, we discuss in detail solar energy conversion in plants, reviewing plant physiology and discussing several key processes that occur during photosynthesis. We next provide a non-exhaustive, general overview of solar cell technologies that exploit biomimetic means of energy conversion to overcome deficiencies that currently plague leading devices in the solar technology field.
Plant physiology
In plants, the smallest unit of comprehensive energy conversion is the plant chloroplast (Fig. 1). The chloroplast converts solar photons into usable chemical energy viaphotosynthesis with an overall synthesis balance  
 Fig. 1  
          Chloroplast Structure. The chloroplast (left) consists of an outer membrane surrounding stacks of photoactive membranes, or granum. The thylakoid membrane contained within each of these stacks (right) is embedded with several protein complexes, including PSII, cyt b6f, PSI, and ATP synthase. Initial electron-hole separation occurs largely within PSII, with subsequent electron transportvia successive redox reactions occurring in the following complexes. Synthesis of ATP, the end product of the reaction scheme, occurs within the ATP synthase of the membrane. 
Like most organelles in the plant cell, chloroplasts are surrounded by outer and inner membranes. The inner membrane contains stacks of photoactive thylakoid membranes, or grana, surrounded by stroma fluid. Stroma lamellae serve to connect the multiple grana throughout the chloroplast. The stacks of thylakoid membranes that compose the grana are embedded with multiple protein complexes, including photosystem II (PSII), cytrochrome b (cyt b6f), photosystem I (PSI) and ATP synthase Each of the photosystems, PSII and PSI, is surrounded by light-absorbing antennas. The first stage of photosysnthesis, or the light-dependent reactions, occurs within these protein complexes within the thylakoid membrane.53–56
The series of light-dependent reactions are initiated in PSII, where light is initially absorbed by the P680 site to generate electron-hole pairs, with an overall half reaction of  
In addition to P680 absorption, light is also absorbed at various wavelengths by the pigments within the surrounding antenna. Electron excitation within the pigment is followed by resonance energy transfer to the P680 site, where electron-hole pairs are generated (Fig. 2a). The hole remains at the site, where it is used in the oxidation reaction of water to produce oxygenviaoxygen-evolving complexes (OECs). Meanwhile, the electron is initially transferred to the pheophytin (Phe) and QA sites, resulting in the reduction of QA. The potential difference between the reduced QA site and the oxidized QB site drives electron transport towards QB. Upon reduction of QB, an electron transport chain is used to extract the electron from the QB site to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane using cyt b6f. (This proton gradient aides in ATP synthesisviaATP synthase, as described below). Like PSII, the following protein complex, PSI, is responsible for photon absorption at the P700 site (Fig. 2b). Similarly, surrounding antennae also absorb light at various wavelengths, transferring energy to P700 through resonance transfer. Electrons gained from PSI are raised in energy via the photoelectric effect, expelling the excited electron to the ferredoxin site. From here, the electron may follow one of two possible pathways: cyclic or noncyclic phosphorylation. Under conditions where the plant produces excess NADPH relative to ATP, the cyclic phosporylation reaction takes place, where the electron is used to pump H+ across the membrane to create a proton concentration gradient that is ultimately used to power ATP synthase. Under conditions where NADPH concentration is less sufficient, the electron enters a noncyclic phosphorylation reaction which ultimately reduces NADP+ to NADPH in the stroma according to the reaction  
 Fig. 2  
          PSII and PSI Structure. (a) Photon absorption at the P680 site in PSII results in electron-hole separation. The hole is used in the oxidization of water to produce oxygen, whereas the electron is driven to the Phe and QA sites of the complex. The potential difference between the quinone sites drives electron transport to the QB site, where it is subsequently removed to enter the electron transport chain in cyt b6f. Except for the QA site, which is located on the D2 protein, the remaining sites (P680, Phe, QB), are located on the D1 protein, which is susceptible to damage with a high turnover rate. (b) Photon absorption at the P700 site in PSI results in electron excitation and expulsion. Subsequent electron extraction to the ferredoxin site occurs, leaving the P700 in the oxidized state. The electron in the ferredoxin site is then used to ultimately reduce NADP+ to NADPH. The surrounding antenna allow for increased absorption of light at wavelengths throughout the solar spectrum. Resonance transfer from the surrounding antenna to P700 is similar to that demonstrated by PSII. 
The final major protein complex, ATP synthase, extracts charged hydrogen atoms from previous oxidation reactions, such as water oxidization in PSII, to ultimately store energy in the form of the ATP with the addition of a phosphate group, PiADP + Pi → ATP
The energy released as protons are pumped from the interior of the thylakoid membrane to the stroma is used to carry out this reaction. Overall, the net yield of the first stage of photosynthesis becomes56–58  
The second stage of photosynthesis, or the light-independent reactions, occurs within the stroma of the chloroplast surrounding the grana. In these reactions, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose according to the Calvin-Benson cycle that occurs within the chloroplast, and the net yield of this subset of reactions becomes596CO2 + 12NADPH + 12H+ + 18ATP → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 12NADP+ + 18ADP + 18Pi

        Chloroplast generation and repair machinery
In addition to carrying out the carbon-fixation processes in the form of the Calvin-Benson cycle, the stroma of the chloroplast also contains genetic material needed to reproduce itself and synthesize necessary proteins, along with the necessary machinery to continually repair photodamaged proteins that accumulate during the first stage of photosynthesis.60 The D1 protein in particular, which contains the P680 site required for light absorption, and the Phe and QB sites required for electron separation, demonstrates the highest turnover rate.61 The self-repair cycle associated with photosynthesis is an evolutionary adaptation allowing plants and photosynthetic organisms a wide range of adaptability.60 These self-repair processes enable plants, for examples, to not only adapt in a manner that minimizes damage, but also fully recover from a state of excessive protein denaturation. Without these self-repair processes, plants would produce less than 5% of their typical photosynthetic yields60 with lifetimes on the order of minutes under intense illumination.62
Upon continuous illumination, the D1 protein in PSII becomes photo-damaged, resulting in the total photo-inactivation of the protein complex. Upon photo-inactivation, PSII partially disassembles to release the damaged protein. The damaged D1 protein is replaced with a newly biosynthesized D1 protein and PSII spontaneously re-assembles, incorporating the new protein to create a fully functional PSII (Fig. 3). In the meantime, the damaged D1 protein undergoes protease degradation.63
 Fig. 3  Self-Repair and Regeneration of D1 Protein in PSII. The self-repair process in plants is driven by the molecular recognition of parts as the system transitions through a series of metastable states. Upon photodamage (right), the photo-inactivated D1 protein becomes denatured, triggering the partial disassembly of the PSII complex (bottom). The damaged D1 protein diffuses towards the outer regions of the membrane scaffold for degradation in exchange with a newly synthesized D1 protein that diffuses towards the disassembled complex. Introduction of the new D1 protein triggers the spontaneous re-assembly of the complex (left) to create a functional, light-harvesting PS II (top). 
Under non-saturating light conditions, this D1 degradation and synthesis occurs at the same rate as D1 protein damage, which is determined by light intensity, among other factors. Thus, the D1 turnover rate increases with increasing light intensity. However, under excessive light intensities, the damage rate is too large for the repair rate to match, resulting in the overall inhibition in PSII activity. When stressed plant cells are returned to moderate, non-saturating conditions, they recover their photosynthetic activity via replacement of the photo-damaged D1 protein.64–67 However, after prolonged stress conditions, the cells reach an inactive, irreversible state from which there is no recovery,62 which is in part due to damage to the transcriptional and translational machinery used to synthesize D1 proteins, as well as other proteins involved in the cell cycle.
Although the exact nature of the cause behind PSII photo-damage and repair are still under investigation, several key players in the process have been identified. For instance, it is known that toxic oxygen radicals are produced under excessive light intensities.68 These radicals are not only responsible for protein cleavage and denaturation, but also for bleaching light-harvesting antennas that surround the photosystem and for general damage to the gene expression machinery used to synthesize new proteins. It is hypothesized that the production of the above reactive species is limited when cells are exposed to saturating light conditions for only limited periods of time, since the cells initially demonstrate virtually no decrease in photoactivity. This limitation may be due to the inherent presence of scavengers such as xanthophylls, carotenes, and specific enzymes that work to deactivate the oxygen radicals, until they are no longer sufficient to buffer against prolonged exposure to saturating light intensities.62 Further evidence also suggests that radical occupancy of the QB site of the D1 protein is specifically linked to photo-inhibition sensitivity69,70 and that it is the first target of high light stress.71,72 The D1 protein, which contains an abundance of proline, glutamine, serine, and threonine, is hypothesized to undergo cleavage at the Arg-238 or Phe-239 site upon photodamage.73Degradation at QB would account for the decrease in the electron transport from the QA to the QB site observed upon photo-inactivation, where QA remains in the reduced state.
Not only does the exact cause of photo-damage remain unclear, but also the precise mechanism by which the plant initiates protein degradation and synthesis is elusive.64 It has been suggested that phosphorylation may play an active role in regulating D1 degradation and synthesis.74 The steady-state level of D1 phosphorylation increases with increasing D1 protein photodamage,75 and degradation of the phosphorylated form of the protein is reduced.76 Several studies have examined protein self-assembly by artificially inducing phosphorylation66,67 at decreased temperatures and monitoring re-assembly at elevated temperatures. However, nothing is known about the D1 protein phosphorylation when PSII is under repair and new photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) have been formed.65 Regardless of the details of the molecular mechanism, one fact remains certain: for plant regeneration, both D1 protein degradation and synthesis must occur at a rate sufficient to match that of protein damage.
Biomimetic solar energy conversion devices
Although plants have evolved highly sophisticated, dynamic mechanisms that allow them to replace photo-damaged proteins to prolong lifetime and enhance efficiencies, as well as structures that seek to optimize light absorption, man-made energy devices lack this capability of dynamic assembly, repair and possible self-replication. Several studies have made progress towards applying energy conversion and self-repair processes used by plants to synthetic devices.77–85
Artificial photosynthesisviawater-splitting catalysis
As discussed, photosynthesis ultimately results in the formation of an electron-hole pair upon absorption of sunlight. The electron is captured and shuttled to PSI, whereas the hole is used by the OEC for the oxidation of water, resulting in the formation of hydrogen. In an effort to duplicate photosynthesis, researchers have sought the creation of a device capable of electron-hole separation upon light absorption where the hole is used in water oxidation such that solar energy is stored chemically in the bond formation of H2 and O2. For decades, researchers have focused on mimicking the OEC near PSII by creating catalysts capable of converting water, carbon dioxide and light into carbohydrates, releasing hydrogen as a source of fuel.79 A synthetic, non-protein based form of catalysis that can oxidize water as efficiently as the OEC is the ruthenium “blue dimer”, which requires activationvia a strong oxidizing agent (Fig. 4a).86,87

(Reprinted with permission from ref. 88. Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society).88 
However, unlike the OEC, this catalyst can only catalyze the reaction for a limited number of cycles prior to demonstrating decreasing efficiencies due to the generation of reactive catalytic intermediates. A tetra-ruthenium-based catalyst developed by Körgerler, Botar and co-workers82 is able to catalyze water oxidation with enhanced stabilities. The next generation of catalysts, which utilize an iridium-based complex, also requires a strong oxidizing agent (Fig. 4b). These catalysts maintain efficiencies on the order of 66% well over 2000 cycles.88 Though they are the first non-ruthenium-based catalyst for photochemical water oxidation with a known structure, unfortunately, they rely on the utilization of costly iridium.
In an alternative approach to address issues of stability, efficiency and cost of water splitting catalysis, Nocera and co-workers89 developed a homogenous rhodium-based catalyst with efficiencies less than those demonstrated by plants naturally. The most recent developments from the group have led to the synthesis of a biomimetic, Co-based catalyst capable of performing under ambient conditions (pH 7, 1 atm, 25 °C) using earth-abundant elements in an aqueous solution.90 To address issues of instability, this catalyst is capable of utilizing biomimetic mechanisms of self-repair wherein the different oxidative states occupied by Co during a catalytic reaction demonstrate varying degrees of solubility and reactivity. The suitable choice of an appropriate anion in solution can counter increased dissolution of the appropriately oxidized Co by establishing equilibrium in solution.
Coupling artificial photosynthesis with hydrogenases
An extension of the bio-inspired systems for hydrogen production interfaces natural photosystems for hydrogen production with synthetic hydrogenases.80 Like plants, cyanobacteria and green algae synthesize glycogen and starches from CO2 when under illumination. Under anaerobic conditions, hydrogenases catalyze the recombination of hydrogen ions with electrons to produce hydrogen gas according to the reaction2H+ + 2e− →H2
To couple the water-splitting reactions during photosynthesis with hydrogenases that remain active under aerobic conditions, a synthetic PSI-hydrogenase hybrid was assembled onto a gold electrode using a genetically engineered, cyanobacteria-derived PSI and a soil bacterium-derived hydrogenase. Light-activated hydrogen production in these biomimetic devices occurs at higher potential and lower energies than synthetic (bio)nanoelectronic devices that did not implement a photosynthetic apparatus. Although the high costs affiliated with protein isolation make future prospects of PS-based hybrid systems infeasible for solving the global energy crisis, cellular-based systems still hold promise in this field.91 In this sense, the future of this field will tend towards devices consisting of photosynthetic organisms and mechanisms, rather than just protein complexes. In fact, several recent studies have taken steps in this direction with the development of nanoprobes capable of direct electron extraction from intact algal cells.92 Some studies have even advocated for the development of biofuel cells that utilize algal cells,93 as well as living plants and bacteria.94
Biomimetic systems utilizing plant-derived photosystems
Conventional technology cannot equal the molecular circuitry found in photosynthetic complexes.95PSI, for example, which has yet to be synthesized synthetically, has external quantum efficiencies of approximately 100% and energy yields of 58%.96 Several studies have focused on the assembly of monolayers of PSI onto various substrates, including Au. One such study examined the adsorption of PSI extracted from commercial spinach leaves onto gold surfaces coated with various amine groups.97 Based on the result of these studies, PSI adsorption was conducted onto a hydroxyl-coated Au electrode surface.81 To fill in the electrode-exposed areas between the adsorbed PSIs, the interstitial, shorter hydroxyl chains were replaced with longer thiol chains, confining the protein layer between hydrocarbon chains. This incorporation of the PSI amongst long, hydrocarbon chains closely resembles the natural environment in the thylakoid membrane, thus stabilizing the PSI and conserving secondary structure upon exposure to various solvents.
In addition to PSI assembly, monolayer assembly has also been extended to RCs in photoelectrochemical cells.78 Immobilization of His-tagged RCs onto an electrode was demonstrated using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NI-NTA) terminated substrate. To enhance device efficiency, RC configuration was altered to more closely mimick the native orientation of the protein complex with cytochrome such that the primary donor is facing the electrode surface. Photoelectrochemical measurements were obtained with the immersion of the decorated electrode into a ubiquinone-contained redox solution, as the redox potential of ubiquinone closely matches that of the QB site for electron extraction.
The effect of varying orientations of PSI monolayers was studied by Greenbaum and co-workers.98Au electrodes were coated with negative, positive and hydrophilic surfaces and incubated with spinach-extracted PSIs for adsorption. Depending on the hydrophobicity and charge of the electrode surface, the PSI would orientate itself horizontally, upwards, or downwards, with I–V characteristics similar to semiconducting and diode-like behaviors. Monodispersion of PSI onto chemically treated Au surfaces allowed for the first single PSI photoelectric measurements using Kelvin force probe microscopy (KFPM).99
Covalent attachment of spinach-derived PSI through imine binding with lysine residues upon vacuum-assisted solution evaporation was also used in device fabrication.100 Upon evaporation, the decreased solubility of PSI and selective precipitation out of solution was used to create highly dense layers on a functionalized Au substrate. Using this fabrication, the PSI is orientated such that its electron transfer vector is directed away from the Au surface. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that such dense monolayers of PSI yield enhanced photocurrents of ∼100nA/cm2.
Alternative approaches for monolayer assembly have focused on obtaining covalent attachment of PSI in specific orientations. An approach to directly tether PSIs as a monolayer onto a gold surface required genetic mutation at various cysteine sites in the vicinity of P700.101 Since the PSIs were isolated from the cyanobacteriaSynechocystis sp., they require no stabilizing agents, since the antenna chlorophylls are integrated within the core subunits of the photosystem rather than as a peripheral attachment as in plants (Fig. 1). Although the fundamental optoelectronic properties of PSI remain conserved upon attachment to gold, attached PSI demonstrated an increase in spectral range and a loss in photopotential.
Dry multilayers of PSI onto gold substrates were also achieved to fabricate bio-inspired solid-state devices.102 As with the monolayer devices developed by Carmeli and co-workers in 2005,101 genetically-altered, cysteine mutants were attached viasulfide binding in the stacked configured shown in Fig. 5, with binding events occurring on the Au substrate for the first monolayer, and on sequentially depositing Pt for the subsequent layers. Such high-density devices resulted in enhanced absorption and increased device efficiencies.

(a) Multilayers of genetically altered PSI covalently attached to a Au substrate result in high-density arrays with enhanced absorption properties and increased efficiencies. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 102. Copyright 2005 Wiley).102 (b) Self-assembled device based on densely-packed, stacked PSII along a SWCNT substrate was proposed to enhance biomimetic device efficiency.83 
A more direct attempt at reconstructing leaf-like structures using PSI was obtained using similar lysine-binding chemistries onto a nanoporous gold leaf (NPGL), wherein PSI was immobilized onto structured, rather than planar, electrodes for increased surface area.84 Greater control in layer assembling mechanisms was shown to enhance photoelectrochemical efficiency.103 This surface enhancement quadrupled photocurrents, producing photocurrents of ∼400 nA/cm2.
Another attempt at enhancing surface area coverage of PSI onto electrode surfaces was made using nanoparticle-PSI hybrid systems.104Gold nanoparticles were deposited onto a planar gold electrode through sedimentation. Electrostatic deposition of cyanobacteria-isolated PSI onto the negatively charged gold nanoparticles to create a bio-nanohyrbid material with photoelectrochemical currents exceeding analogous planar-based electrodes.
As opposed to non-covalent deposition, direct tethering of PSI to a functionalized surface is another approach used by research scientists to extract photoelectrical output.105 In one such study, Au nanoparticles were decorated with artificial vitamin K1 tethers, and native vitamin K1 tethers were removed from bacteria-extracted PSIs. Incubation of the modified PSI complexes with the functionalized nanoparticles creates synthetically tethered PSIs with direct electron extraction from the quinine pocket. In a similar study, planar gold electrodes were coated with electrostatically adsorbed, synthetic vitamin K1 wires.77 Incubation of the adsorbed wires with PSI where natural vitamin K1 tethers have been removed covalently attaches the photoactive protein complex to the Au electrode surface.
An extension of this work also resulted in a similar, direct binding of PSI to carbon nanotubes106–108 and a tethered, indirect binding to a GaAs substrate.109,110 To improve the efficiency, Lebedev and co-workers used arrayed carbon nanotube electrodes.111 The RCs were encapsulated inside carbon nanotube arrays and bound to the inner tube walls in a unidirectional orientation using organic molecular linkers. The efficiency was considerably improved by increasing the number of RCs attached onto the electrode surface by about 5-fold compared to that obtained with the same proteins when immobilized on a planar graphite (HOPG) electrode. In an alterative study, carbon nanotubes were covalently functionalized with diazonium salt to attach RCs, and the his-tagged RCs were reversibly assembled to a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-NTA-Ni2+ complex.112
In contrast to liquid-based devices, photosystem-based solid-state versions were also explored in a research study by Baldo and co-workers wherein both PSI- and RC-based devices with 12% internal quantum efficiencies were developed.113 These photosynthetically-derived proteins were immobilized onto a gold-coated ITO substrate using NTA functionalized surfaces with His-tagged protein subunits. Self-assembly of the PSI onto the functionalized surface relies on the exchange of an intrinsic subunit from the PSI complexes with an immobilized, functionalized subunit. Such replacement is similar to the exchange process used by plants to naturally replace photodamaged subunits. To stabilize the immobilized protein in the solid-state device, peptide surfactants and amorphous organic semiconducting layers were deposited during device fabrication. These thin films impart the device with not only protein stability, but also “solid-state antennae” reminiscent of light-harvesting antennae used to enhance optical absorption in natural systems. Such studies85,101,106 often rely on the labor-intensive isolation of PSI and mutation of specific subunits in order to achieve densely packed layers with increased efficiencies.
The most recent development in photosystem-based solar energy devices not only incorporates intact RCs, but also utilizes the self-repair mechanism used by plants in D1 synthesis and degradation to develop the first photoelectrochemical cell capable of biomimetic regeneration.83 In our recent study, an aqueous solution containing RCs, carbon nanotubes, lipid, and surfactant is dialyzed to selectively remove surfactant. The remaining components spontaneously self-assemble into a photoactive complex where lipid bilayer disks align along the length of a nanotube, each housing an individual RC. The RC orientation within the lipid bilayer is reminiscent of that within naturally occurring thylakoid membranes: the hydrophobic regions of the RC are buried within the hydrophobic chains of the bilayer and the hydrophilic ends are pointed towards the aqueous solution. The self-assembly of this complex is completely reversible in that the re-addition of surfactant to the system spontaneously disassembles the complex into its initial micellar state. Hence, the cyclic assembly and disassembly of the photoactive complex is driven by the molecular recognition of parts, kinetic trapping of metastable thermodynamic states, and chemical signaling to switch between the assembled and disassembled states; the key components involved in the plant self-repair cycle. Photoelectrochemical measurements of the assembled complex realized a 40% per complex external quantum efficiency based on the produced photocurrent. Overall cell efficiency, which is strongly dependent on complex concentration, was increased by over 300% by utilizing a regeneration cycle incorporating the cyclic disassembly and re-assembly of the complex upon protein photodamage using the cell design shown in Fig. 6. As the light is irradiated, the photocurrent appears in the assembled state and decreases over time upon photodamage. When the photocurrent reaches about 25% of the initial value, the sodium cholate surfactant is introduced to break apart the complexes and remove the photodamaged components using the second dialyzer while maintaining the nanotube scaffold. The complexes are subsequently re-formed with new components by removing the surfactant using the first dialyzer, resulting in the recovery of the photocurrent to the previous maximum. This is the first demonstration of a synthetic photoelectrochemical complex mimicking the self-repair process used by plants, which is shown in Fig. 3. As with the previously discussed studies,102 enhanced device efficiencies are expected for high-density, stacked arrangements (Fig. 5).

(a) A solution consisting of RC-lipid bilayer-nanotube complexes and a dual mediator system comprised ferrocyanide/ferricyanide and ubiquinone/ubiquinol redox couples is illuminated at 785 nm. Photoresponse is measured using a SWCNT working electrode and a Pt counter-electrode. Surfactant removal is used for complex assembly (left dialyzer), and surfactant addition is used for complex disassembly (right dialyzer). (b) Photocurrent is measured under continuous illumination as photoresponse decreases over time. When approximately 25% of the initial photoactivity is achieved, surfactant is introduced into the system to initiate complex disassembly. The photodamaged proteins are replaced, and surfactant is once more removed from the system to re-assemble the complex, incorporating the photoactive proteins. This regeneration cycle is applied over 168 h, increasing overall cell efficiency by over 300% relative to efficiencies demonstrated in the absence of regeneration.

Bio-inspired light-harvesting antennas for enhanced efficiencies
As discussed above, enhancing biomimetic photoelectrical efficiency remains an active area of research. In addition to maximizing surface area exposure84,104 and synthesizing high-density arrays,83,102 researchers have also developed enhanced light-absorption antennas that mimick the light-harvesting antennas used by both PSI and PSII.114–117 These antennas absorb light at a broader range of wavelengths. The energy absorbed by the antenna complexes is directed to the RCs which absorb photons at a specific wavelength, where the electron-hole pairs are generated using the absorbed energy, and the electrons are transferred to electron acceptors. In another recent report from our group,118carbon nanotubes were used to synthesize multi-shell, one-dimensional optical antennas with different bandgap energies which consist of smaller bandgap nanotubes inside and (6,5) nanotubes outside (Fig. 7). This core-shell nanofiber funnels excitation to the photon energy of the smallest bandgap nanotubes in the core of the antenna, which is analogous to energy transfer mechanisms from antenna complexes surrounding PSI and PSII.

Conclusions and outlook
As it stands, the high costs affiliated with protein isolation and purification undermines the development of a low-cost, bio-based solar conversion device for both hydrogen generation91 and photoelectrochemical/photovoltaic applications. These high costs are partially offset by advancements that boost solar conversion efficiencies, whether it be via textured surfaces that resemble leaf-life porosity in plants,84,104 stacked arrays with densities that approach that of the stacked grana in chloroplasts,83,102regeneration cycles that rival the self-repair mechanisms used by plants,83 or solar concentrators that funnel energy to photoactive complexes analogous to light-harvesting antennae found in plants.118 Regardless of the device (water-splitting, photovoltaic, etc.), and regardless of the approach used to enhance device efficiency, the solution scientists converge to is consistently something already addressed in nature. As researchers continue to venture out of the realm of rigid, inorganic, pricey photovoltaics and into the realm of thin, flexible, organic, quasi-fluidic devices, one thing remains certain; the tendency towards biomimetic devices is a recurring theme in this field that will continue to sculpt the fabrication of solar cells for the future.

He was a postdoctoral research fellow from 2001 to 2003 at Rice University in the departments of Chemistry and Physics under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Richard E. Smalley.

          Chloroplast Structure. The chloroplast (left) consists of an outer membrane surrounding stacks of photoactive membranes, or granum. The thylakoid membrane contained within each of these stacks (right) is embedded with several protein complexes, including PSII, cyt b6f, PSI, and ATP synthase. Initial electron-hole separation occurs largely within PSII, with subsequent electron transportvia successive redox reactions occurring in the following complexes. Synthesis of ATP, the end product of the reaction scheme, occurs within the ATP synthase of the membrane.	 

 		 

 		 

 	Fig. 2  
          PSII and PSI Structure. (a) Photon absorption at the P680 site in PSII results in electron-hole separation. The hole is used in the oxidization of water to produce oxygen, whereas the electron is driven to the Phe and QA sites of the complex. The potential difference between the quinone sites drives electron transport to the QB site, where it is subsequently removed to enter the electron transport chain in cyt b6f. Except for the QA site, which is located on the D2 protein, the remaining sites (P680, Phe, QB), are located on the D1 protein, which is susceptible to damage with a high turnover rate. (b) Photon absorption at the P700 site in PSI results in electron excitation and expulsion. Subsequent electron extraction to the ferredoxin site occurs, leaving the P700 in the oxidized state. The electron in the ferredoxin site is then used to ultimately reduce NADP+ to NADPH. The surrounding antenna allow for increased absorption of light at wavelengths throughout the solar spectrum. Resonance transfer from the surrounding antenna to P700 is similar to that demonstrated by PSII.

 	Fig. 3  Self-Repair and Regeneration of D1 Protein in PSII. The self-repair process in plants is driven by the molecular recognition of parts as the system transitions through a series of metastable states. Upon photodamage (right), the photo-inactivated D1 protein becomes denatured, triggering the partial disassembly of the PSII complex (bottom). The damaged D1 protein diffuses towards the outer regions of the membrane scaffold for degradation in exchange with a newly synthesized D1 protein that diffuses towards the disassembled complex. Introduction of the new D1 protein triggers the spontaneous re-assembly of the complex (left) to create a functional, light-harvesting PS II (top).

 	Fig. 6  Biomimetic Regeneration for Cell Efficiency Enhancement. (a) A solution consisting of RC-lipid bilayer-nanotube complexes and a dual mediator system comprised ferrocyanide/ferricyanide and ubiquinone/ubiquinol redox couples is illuminated at 785 nm. Photoresponse is measured using a SWCNT working electrode and a Pt counter-electrode. Surfactant removal is used for complex assembly (left dialyzer), and surfactant addition is used for complex disassembly (right dialyzer). (b) Photocurrent is measured under continuous illumination as photoresponse decreases over time. When approximately 25% of the initial photoactivity is achieved, surfactant is introduced into the system to initiate complex disassembly. The photodamaged proteins are replaced, and surfactant is once more removed from the system to re-assemble the complex, incorporating the photoactive proteins. This regeneration cycle is applied over 168 h, increasing overall cell efficiency by over 300% relative to efficiencies demonstrated in the absence of regeneration.
