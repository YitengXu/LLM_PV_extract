    , Accepted 13th December 2019First published on 13th December 2019AbstractThe production of hydrogen by electrolyzing water, which stores the excess temporal fluctuations of solar and wind power in the form of chemical energy, is usually energy intensive and expensive. Therefore, developing highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts via a simple synthesis strategy for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has become a remarkable challenge in energy and environmental science. Herein, we report a new simple electrochemical deposition (ECD) method for the synthesis of a highly efficient carbon-cloth-supported PtRu HER catalyst (PtRu/CC1500) in a wide pH range, in which Pt in an ultralow loading amount (1.6 μg cmCC−2) is electrodeposited on Ru nanoparticles (NPs). This catalyst presents remarkable performance, with low overpotentials of only 8, 25 and 19 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (η10) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, as well as long-term stability (10000 cycles). Also, even at a high current density of 300 mA cm−2, it still displays small overpotentials of 37 and 95 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In addition, the PtRu catalyst achieves an excellent mass current density of 109.9 mA μg−1 (in 0.5 M H2SO4 at −30 mV) and 198.7 mA μg−1 (in 1.0 M KOH at −100 mV), which are 30 and 59 times higher than those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Density functional theory calculations suggest that PtRu nanoparticles (NPs) not only significantly improve hydrogen desorption (ΔGH* very close to zero) but also promote H2O dissociation, accounting for their enhanced catalytic activity. Due to the simple preparation strategy, excellent HER performance and long-term durability of the PtRu catalyst, it has great potential for commercial applications.
1. Introduction
The growing global climate problem has forced people to seek green energy sources as substitutes for conventional fossil fuels. Hydrogen is undoubtedly becoming one of the best choices for the development of green energy.1,2 As early as 1973, Winsche and coworkers put forward the concept of a hydrogen energy economy, in which developing the technology to transform hydrogen as an energy source into economic reality is considered to be a great challenge.3 Recently, the continued progress of fuel cell technology has provided a strong driving force for the development of hydrogen energy; this technology has the potential to become a major factor in catalysing the energy structure to a future sustainable energy system with low CO2 emissions.4 Therefore, producing hydrogen in a clean, economical and convenient way has become a key issue.
Water electrolysis has long been considered to be one of the most effective strategies for pure hydrogen production, and its significance is expected to increase in the future.3 Because of their efficient performance, Pt-based catalysts are still currently the major commercial options among HER electrocatalysts; however, their high cost has hindered their wide application. On the one hand, great efforts have been made to design non-noble metal electrocatalysts, such as non-noble metal alloys, transition metal oxides/nitrides/phosphides/chalcogenides and carbon-based materials.5–14 On the other hand, because of their relatively low cost,15,16 facile hydrogen desorption (the key step in HER),17–19 and comparable corrosion resistance and chemical stability,20,21 Ru-based HER catalysts have been proposed very recently as the most promising alternatives for Pt catalysts; thus, numerous Ru-based HER catalysts have been reported in the last few years, including metallic Ru, RuO2 and RuPx NPs and nanowires and nanosheets loaded on supports (graphene, carbon nitride, carbon nanotubes, TiO2 nanotube arrays, CeO2, etc.)16,20,22–24 However, these newly developed catalysts usually cannot simultaneously satisfy the key demands of commercial HER catalysts: (1) high catalytic performance with respect to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (especially at high current density), (2) low cost and high reliability, which usually requires simple preparation approaches, and (3) good durability in strong acidic or alkaline solutions after long-term catalytic reactions.
In this work, we successfully realized the electrodeposition of Pt on Ru NPs to form a PtRu/CC1500 bimetallic catalyst, in which trace Pt (1.6 μg cmCC−2) is dispersed on Ru NPs. The catalyst exhibits excellent HER activity in acidic (η10 = 8 mV), neutral (η10 = 25 mV) and alkaline (η10 = 19 mV) media. Even at a high current density, this catalyst displays superior performance compared with the benchmark metal catalyst Pt/C.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays a schematic that illustrates the electrochemical deposition (ECD) process for the preparation of the PtRu catalyst. During the ECD process, trace Pt ions can be electrochemically dissolved from the Pt mesh (counter electrode) and then electrochemically deposited on the working electrode of RuO2, as reported by Chen and coworkers.25 This trace supply of metal ions ensures slow growth and fine dispersion of the deposits.26Fig. 1b exhibits a TEM image of RuO2 nanocrystals peeled from the RuO2/CC sample by sonication, in which the nanocrystals with ultra-fine sizes (less than 3 nm) are well dispersed on a piece of carbon sheet; this indicates that this approach to prepare highly dispersed nanocatalysts by a simple dipping and heating process without using any organic surfactants is effective. Fig. 1c shows the HRTEM image of a single RuO2 nanocrystal; the lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.223 nm is marked by lines and corresponds to the (111) plane of tetragonal RuO2. Fig. 1d and e present TEM images of the metallic nanocrystals supported on a piece of carbon stripping sheet after 1500 ECD cycles. The images indicate that the crystallization degree of the nanocrystals is better than that of the RuO2/CC sample before the ECD process, and the particle sizes still remained around 3 nm (Fig. S1†). The HRTEM image (Fig. 1f) shows that the metallic nanocrystals are encapsulated by carbon matrices. These nanocrystals display an obvious lattice space of 0.205 nm, which is due to the (101) plane of metallic Ru, indicating that the initial RuO2 nanocrystals have been reduced to a metallic state during the ECD process; this was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2e). The HAADF-STEM image coupled with EDX element mapping images indicates the homogeneous distribution of the elements Ru and Pt (Fig. 1g–i), indicating that the Pt atoms preferably deposit on Ru to form bimetallic nanoparticles.

Fig. 2a shows the HER polarization curves of RuO2 after 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ECD cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The corresponding overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10) and different loading amounts of Pt are illustrated in Fig. 2b. The as-measured overpotentials at η10 present an obvious decrease with increasing ECD cycle number; meanwhile, after 1500 cycles, the overpotential at η10 stabilizes at around 8 mV. These changes indicate that the ECD process greatly enhances the HER activity of RuO2/CC up to 1500 cycles in acidic solution. Furthermore, the HER catalytic activities of RuO2 after 4000 ECD cycles were measured in both acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively (Fig. S5 and S6†). The results show that although the LSV curves were almost unchanged after 4000 cycles in acidic solution, their mass activity decreased noticeably. In alkaline solution, the catalytic activity shows an obvious decrease when the number of ECD cycles increases to 4000, indicating that excessive deposition of Pt results in attenuation of the synergistic effect between Pt and the Ru catalyst. Therefore, we used the precursor RuO2/CC electrode treated for 1500 cycles as the optimal sample for further characterization. The TEM images acquired during the ECD process reveal that there were few changes in either size or morphology (Fig. S7†), showing favorable stability. To determine the factors of the catalytic activity enhancement, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of bare CC after different ECD cycles was also performed (Fig. S8†). The ECD process improves the HER performance of bare CC, which may result from the continuous Pt deposition and CV process. As shown in Fig. S9,† after 1500 cycles, some Pt NPs with sizes ca. 3 to 5 nm were present on the carbon matrix. To explore the effects of the CV process, the same experiment was performed in an H-type electrolytic cell separated by Nafion film, which obstructed the migration and deposition of Pt ions on the cathode (Fig. S15b†). It was found that the CV process has little effect on their HER performance, indicating that the enhancement in the performance during the ECD process was due to the deposition of Pt on the Ru NPs. As shown in Fig. 2b and Table S1,† the ICP-MS analysis displays that the deposition amount of Pt obviously increases with increasing number of ECD cycles. Typically, in the sample of PtRu/CC1500, the loading amount of Pt measured by ICP-MS is only 1.6 μg cmCC−2, far below that of most reported HER catalysts on the basis of Pt. In addition, the signals of metallic Pt, Ru and RuO2 cannot be detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. S10.† The bare CC, RuO2/CC and PtRu/CC1500 show the same pattern form, further confirming the relatively low loading amounts of Ru and Pt species.
Tafel plots at different ECD cycles are shown in Fig. S11.† The linear portions are fitted to the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where b is the Tafel slope), and the obtained Tafel slopes are 59, 51, 36, 25 and 26 mV dec−1 for ECD cycles 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000, respectively; this reveals that the HER kinetics are evidently accelerated by increasing the number of ECD cycles. It is worth noting that the Tafel slopes below 30 mV dec−1 are generally obtained from the Pt-based HER catalysts, which indicates very fast reaction kinetics.27–29
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is generally used to estimate the number of active sites of a HER electrocatalyst on the basis of electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl).30–32 As illustrated in Fig. S12† and 2c, compared with the HER performance, the values of Cdl increase from 6.29 to 7.78 mF cm−2 when the ECD process increases to 1500 cycles, implying that PtRu/CC1500 provides more exposed active sites and easier electron transfer for HER. As the ECD cycles increase from 1500 to 2000, the Cdl value of PtRu changes only slightly, revealing that the increased Pt deposition after 1500 cycles does not greatly improve the number of active sites. In order to exclude the ECSA resulting from CC, bare CC was also tested via the same method as above for PtRu (Fig. S13†), except that the common electrolytic cell was replaced with an H-type electrolytic cell separated by Nafion film to prevent Pt migration. The Cdl values measured from the bare CC at the initial and final stages are 0.94 and 0.98 mF cm−2, respectively; this indicates that the ECSAs of the as-prepared samples are mainly contributed by the Ru and Pt species.
EIS measurements of RuO2, PtRu/CC500, PtRu/CC1000, PtRu/CC1500 and PtRu/CC2000 were performed and are shown in Fig. 2d. The Nyquist plots of RuO2/CC and PtRu/CC at different ECD cycles show near-semicircles, which can be well fitted by an equivalent circuit model. The fitting results suggest that PtRu/CC1500 (1.72 Ω) and PtRu/CC2000 (1.25 Ω) have much smaller charge transfer resistance than RuO2/CC (11.76 Ω); this confirms the higher charge transfer rate of the PtRu bimetallic catalyst, which is beneficial for accelerating the HER kinetics.33
To study the changes in the chemical states of Ru and Pt at different ECD cycles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed. Fig. 2e shows the Ru 3p3/2 regions in the spectra, which can be deconvoluted into metallic Ru(0) and RuOx. As the number of ECD cycles increases, the relative intensity of metallic Ru(0) in each individual region increases. The Ru 3d5/2 signals recorded from the sample after 0, 500, 1500 and 2000 ECD cycles present an obvious shift to the lower energy region (Fig. S14†). These results reveal that RuO2 is gradually reduced to metallic Ru(0) during the ECD process. In order to eliminate the effects of Pt on the reduction of RuO2, control experiments were performed in the H-type electrolytic cell separated by Nafion film. As shown in Fig. S15a,† the valence state of Ru displays a similar variation trend, implying that the RuO2 reduction is due to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) process. The Pt 4f areas of these composites contain two major peaks (Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2); the relative intensity of metallic Pt(0) in each individual region increased from 30.2% in PtRu/CC500 to 64.5% in PtRu/CC2000, indicating that the initially adsorbed Pt ions on the surface of the Ru crystals are gradually reduced to the metallic state after a long ECD process.
To investigate its electrochemical catalytic performance in HER, PtRu1500 was analysed by LSV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 3a). Bare CC, RuO2 and commercial Pt/C with the same Pt loading amount were also tested under the same conditions for comparison. Interestingly, PtRu/CC1500 showed excellent HER activity; the overpotential is only 8 mV at η10, while the Pt/C and RuO2/CC electrodes require overpotentials of 41 and 49 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S16†), respectively, which indicates that the enhanced HER performance of PtRu arises from the synergistic effect between Pt and Ru. It is worth noting that the η10 value of PtRu/CC1500 is also much smaller than those of previously reported HER catalysts (Table S2†). More importantly, at high current densities, PtRu/CC1500 still exhibits a much smaller η value compared with commercial Pt/C (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the current density at −0.03 V on PtRu/CC1500 is 175.7 mA cm−2, which is 30.2 and 35.1 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2/CC under the same overpotential, respectively. Even when the loading amount of Pt is increased to the total metal loading amount in PtRu/CC1500 (15.6 μg cm−2), their HER performance is still much lower than that of PtRu/CC1500 (Fig. S17†). We collected the generated H2 from the PtRu/CC1500‖IrO2 catalyst-driving cell via a Hoffman apparatus setup. The amount of produced H2 collected at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 matches well with the theoretically calculated value, corresponding to a faradaic efficiency of ∼100% (Fig. S18†).

The Tafel slope is generally used to kinetically evaluate the catalytic performance of HER catalysts; it can be extracted from the linear part of the Tafel plot (Fig. 3c). The Tafel slope is about 25 mV dec−1 for PtRu/CC1500, which is much lower than those of Pt/C (35 mV dec−1) and RuO2/CC (59 mV dec−1); this reveals that PtRu/CC1500 shows the fastest reaction kinetics in the Tafel step. Thus, the decisive reaction should be the recombination of adsorbed H* to release H2.34 The exchange current density (j0) is used to describe the ability of an electrode to gain or lose electrons and to reflect the difficulty of an electrode reaction; it can be obtained from the intersection of the extrapolated linear part of the Tafel plot and the X-axis.35 A high exchange current density often indicates that an electrode has stronger polarization ability.36 The PtRu/CC1500 electrode displays an exchange current density of 2.44 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.97 mA cm−2) and most other reported catalysts (Table S2†); this indicates superior intrinsic catalytic activity.
The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity was further investigated by calculating the turnover frequency (TOF), which reflects the generation rate of H2 molecules per active site.26,37–39 The TOF comparisons at different overpotentials of commercial Pt/C, PtRu/CC1500 and RuO2/CC are shown in Fig. 3d. At the overpotential of 0.05 V, PtRu/CC1500 gives a TOF value of 13.35 H2 s−1, which is 7.6 and 30.5 times higher than those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.76 H2 s−1) and RuO2 (0.43 H2 s−1), respectively; this reveals that the excellent performance of PtRu/CC1500 results from its higher intrinsic activity.
In addition to its excellent catalytic performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, PtRu/CC1500 exhibits excellent activity in 1 M PBS and 1 M KOH solutions; this is of great importance in some specific applications, e.g., seawater HER electrolyzers, water–alkali HER electrolyzers and microbial electrolysis cells. As shown in Fig. 3e and S20,† although the HER performance in neutral solution is inferior to that in acid, PtRu/CC1500 still exhibits a low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10 = 25 mV), which is much smaller than those of commercial Pt/C (η10 = 147 mV), RuO2/CC (η10 = 83 mV) and other reported catalysts (Table S3†). The current density of PtRu/CC1500 is 97.8 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V (Fig. 3f), which is 15.5 times higher than that of Pt/C. In addition, PtRu/CC1500 shows the highest exchange current density, the smallest Tafel slope (Fig. 3g), and the highest TOF among these catalysts (Fig. 3h).
As revealed in Fig. 3i, the bare CC demonstrates minimal background activity for H2 evolution in 1 M KOH solution. In contrast, PtRu/CC1500 presents excellent HER activities. Only 19 mV was required to generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much smaller than that of Pt/C (η10 = 147 mV) as well as many other catalysts (Fig. S22 and Table S3†). The current density of PtRu/CC1500 is 317.9 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 100 mV (Fig. 3j), which is 59.1 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C under the same overpotential. It is worth pointing out that the PtRu/CC1500 electrocatalyst performed well in a wide pH range, with activity outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst and most reported catalysts (Tables S2–S4†). In addition, even when the loading amount of Pt is increased to the total metal loading amount in PtRu/CC1500 (15.6 μg cm−2), its HER performance in 1 M PBS and 1 M KOH solutions is still much lower than that of PtRu/CC1500 (Fig. S21 and S23†). Significantly, the Tafel slope of PtRu/CC1500 is 28 mV dec−1 in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution, whereas it is 38 mV dec−1 for Pt/C; this proves that PtRu/CC1500 has a faster reaction pathway in alkaline solution (Fig. 3k). The exchange current density of PtRu/CC1500 (1.25 mA cm−2) is much higher than those of other catalysts (Table S3†), even RuO2/CC (0.93 mA cm−2) and commercial Pt/C (0.25 mA cm−2). The TOF value of PtRu/CC1500 in 1.0 M KOH solution at an overpotential of 100 mV is 13.01 H2 s−1 (Fig. 3l), which was found to be about 17.7 times that of commercial Pt/C.

Mass activity is another important issue for practical applications; it is closely related to the cost of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 4, the ECD process enhances the mass activity of PtRu/CC1500 at all studied potentials compared to RuO2/CC over a wide pH range, even when normalized to the total loading amount of Pt and Ru (Fig. S24–S26†). The mass activity of PtRu/CC1500 normalized by the content of Pt at −30 mV is 109.9 mA μg−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is 30 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (Fig. 4a and b). The mass activities of PtRu/CC1500 at −0.1 V are 61.1 mA μg−1 in 1 M PBS and 198.7 mA μg−1 in 1 M KOH, which are 16 and 59 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively (Fig. 4c–f). Comparisons of the mass activities on PtRu/CC1500, commercial Pt/C and RuO2/CC in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH solutions at different overpotentials are further shown in Fig. 4b, d and f, respectively. The results indicate that PtRu/CC1500 always shows the best mass activity, implying its great potential in practical applications.
Stability is also a significant figure of merit for comparative evaluation of an electrocatalyst. The long-term durability of PtRu/CC1500 was investigated by repeating CV scans between −0.1 and 0.2 V with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1 in N2-purged 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS and 1 M KOH solutions (Fig. 5a, c and e), respectively. After 10000 potential cycles, the HER performance of PtRu/CC1500 was detected by LSV in the above solutions, respectively. Obviously, the HER performance of PtRu/CC1500 remained constant. To gain structural information after the long-term durability test, we performed post-HER characterization of PtRu/CC1500. As shown in Fig. S27,† the ultrafine nanoparticles were largely maintained. No obvious aggregation can be observed. In addition, Fig. S33† presents that there were no distinct variations in the chemical states of PtRu/CC1500 after the HER test. The electrocatalytic durability of PtRu/CC1500 and commercial Pt/C was further evaluated by chronoamperometry. As shown in Fig. 5b, d and f, PtRu/CC1500 did not show any degradation in performance after running for 10 h; however, the Pt/C electrocatalyst degraded significantly with time under the same operating conditions. We believe that the excellent stability of PtRu/CC1500 is due to two key factors: (1) the synergetic effect between bimetallic components is helpful to improve the chemical stability of the catalyst; (2) the initial heating treatment and ECD process may be conductive to anchoring the catalyst on the C matrix and preventing its aggregation. Meanwhile, the poor durability of commercial Pt/C generally arises from the weak interactions between Pt NPs and the C substrate, resulting in their detachment and/or aggregation.40

The turnover frequency (TOF) and overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 are two important figures of merit that are used to evaluate HER electrocatalysts. To obtain a straightforward comparison, the TOF values of PtRu/CC1500 were compared with those of recently reported representative HER electrocatalysts in acidic and alkaline media, separately. Fig. 6a shows the TOF values of PtRu/CC1500 and Pt/C along with those of other recently reported HER electrocatalysts, including Ru/MeOH/THF,41 PtRu@RFCS,29 N-MoS2-3,42 Pt NC/N-graphene-2,28 CoP@PS/NCNT,43 Ce-doped CoP,37 TiS2 QDs,44 CoMoS345 and Co0.95V0.05SP,46 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The TOF value of PtRu/CC1500 at an overpotential of 50 mV (vs. RHE) is 13.35 H2 s−1, which is larger than those of reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the value obtained in 1 M KOH solution (13.01 H2 s−1 at 100 mV) is also much larger than those of MoNi4,47 a-Mo-Ni3S2,48 NiMoS4/Ti,49 Ru/NC,50 Co-Ni3N,51 Ni(OH)2/Ni3S2,52 NH2-BP53 and CoMoS345 (Fig. 6b). In addition, compared with recently reported noble metal-based HER electrocatalysts in acidic (Fig. S28†) and alkaline (Fig. S29†) media, the as-prepared PtRu/CC1500 catalyst is still in an advantageous position. Comparisons of the overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 of PtRu/CC1500 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS and 1 M KOH solutions with those of other recently reported electrocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6c. Obviously, PtRu/CC1500 only requires overpotentials of 8, 25 and 19 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH solutions, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2; these are much lower than those of other recently reported Pt and non-Pt electrocatalysts (Tables S2–S4†).

In order to understand the superior activity of the PtRu/CC1500 catalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions, we performed density functional theory (DFT) computations on the thermodynamics of HER on different metal surfaces. All the calculation details can be found in the ESI.† Single-Pt-doped Ru(101) and double-Pt-doped Ru(101), Pt1/Ru(101) and Pt2/Ru(101), in which one or two Ru atom(s) in the top layer are replaced by Pt atoms, were modelled to represent the as-prepared PtRu/CC1000 and PtRu/CC1500 catalysts, respectively. The Pt-layer/Ru(101) model indicates that all the Ru atoms in the top layer of the Ru(101) surface were covered by Pt, which represents the PtRu catalyst after 2000 or even 4000 ECD cycles. The pristine Ru(101) and Pt(111) surfaces, which represent the conventional Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively, were also calculated for comparison.
In general, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, ΔGH*, is one of the key descriptors in the theoretical prediction of the HER activity of an electrocatalyst in acidic solution. It has been shown in many previous studies that an optimum HER electrocatalyst usually has a ΔGH* value close to 0, which represents faster proton/electron transfer kinetics.24,54–57Fig. 7a shows the calculated hydrogen adsorption energies ΔGH* for five different surfaces. Compared to those of Ru(101) (0.25 eV) and Pt(111) (0.19 eV), Pt-doped Ru(101) catalysts have much smaller |ΔGH*| values, ranging from 0.05 to 0.09 eV. As the Pt doping increases, the |ΔGH*| value decreases; however, Pt-layer/Ru(101) has almost the same |ΔGH*| value (0.05 eV) as that Pt2/Ru(101) (0.06 eV). Consequently, from a thermodynamic point of view, the hydrogen evolution activity of the three surfaces follows the order of Pt-layer/Ru(101) ≈ Pt2/Ru(101) > Pt1/Ru(101) > Pt(111) > Ru(101). At the beginning, as the Pt doping increases, the HER catalytic activity of the PtRu/CC catalyst in acidic solution will increase. Then, after a given amount of Pt doping, the HER catalytic activity will become stable and will not increase further. These results readily explain the HER performance of the PtRu/CC catalyst in acidic solution.

HER in alkaline solution usually follows a pathway involving H2O adsorption, H2O dissociation to form adsorbed H (H*), combination of H* with a proton from adjacent H2O to form adsorbed H2, and H2 desorption from the surface.58 Previous studies found that among those steps, H2O dissociation to form adsorbed H (H*) is the key step.19,29,59,60 Consequently, the dissociation of one adsorbed H2O molecule to form H* and HO* on five metal surfaces was studied by the dissociation energy ΔGdiss, as presented in Fig. 7b. First, H2O dissociation on Pt2/Ru(101), Pt1/Ru(101), and Ru(101) is exothermic, while that on Pt(111) and Pt-layer/Ru(101) is endothermic. Second, Pt2/Ru(101) and Pt1/Ru(101) show the optimal levels for the hydrogen adsorption step, with ΔGdiss(Pt1/Ru(101)) = −0.22 eV and ΔGdiss(Pt1/Ru(101)) = −0.36 eV, respectively. However, the Pt-layer/Ru(101), Ru(101) and Pt(111) surfaces exhibit larger absolute values, with ΔGdiss(Pt-layer/Ru(101)) = +0.79 eV, ΔGdiss(Ru(101)) = −0.45 eV, and ΔGdiss(Pt(111)) = +0.51 eV, respectively. Therefore, in alkaline solution, the low Pt-doping catalysts Pt2/Ru(101) and Pt1/Ru(101) have better HER catalytic activity than the Pt(111) catalyst. However, if the Pt doping becomes high (as in Pt-layer/Ru(101)), the HER catalytic activity will decrease and even worsen. These results are in excellent agreement with the above experimental results of the superior HER catalytic activity of the PtRu/CC catalyst at about 1500 cycles and the decreasing HER catalytic activity after 4000 ECD cycles in alkaline solution.
Based on these explorations, the highly improved HER performance (durability and activity) of PtRu/CC1500 can be attributed to a combined result of its electronic synergistic effects, large ECSA, higher electrical conductivity and smaller charge-transfer resistance. First, the presence of Pt in the PtRu/CC1500 catalyst effectively modifies the electronic structure, which decreases the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and enhances the electrocatalytic HER activity. A similar phenomenon was observed in other bimetallic nanostructures.61–64 Second, PtRu/CC1500 processes a higher electrochemically active surface area than RuO2 and commercial Pt/C, which can favor effective accessibility of the intrinsic active sites and enhancement of the mass transport efficiency. Third, in the Nyquist plots, PtRu/CC1500 displays a smaller semicircle in the high frequency region than RuO2/CC, indicating higher electrical conductivity and smaller charge-transfer resistance; this is beneficial for fast charge transfer and electron transport during the HER process and thus greatly accelerates the HER kinetics.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed an organics-free, simple and efficient approach to synthesize a PtRu/CC1500 catalyst with Pt highly dispersed on Ru NPs supported by carbon cloth. This catalyst with ultralow Pt loading presents highly enhanced performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction and exhibits excellent stability in a wide pH range with respect to the commercial benchmark catalyst Pt/C. The overpotentials are only 8, 25 and 19 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS and 1 M KOH solutions, respectively. Typically, the Pt mass activity of the as-prepared electrode at η = 30 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution is 109.9 mA μg−1 (30 times higher than that of Pt/C), while the Tafel slope is only 25 mV dec−1; this is much smaller than those of Pt/C (35 mV dec−1) and RuO2/CC electrode (59 mV dec−1). In 1.0 M KOH solution, the Pt mass activity at η = 100 mV is 198.7 mA μg−1 (59 times higher than that of Pt/C) while the Tafel slope is 28 mV dec−1, smaller than that of Pt/C (38 mV dec−1). With DFT calculations, the hydrogen desorption energy (ΔGH*) on PtRu/CC1500 was found to be very close to zero, and H2O dissociation is also obviously promoted, which accounts for the enhanced catalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The simple preparation strategy, highly efficient catalytic performance, and long-term durability of this newly developed PtRu/CC1500 catalyst suggest the possibility of its commercialization, which will undoubtedly pave the way toward industrial applications such as energy conversion and storage.
