1. Introduction
Porphyrins are cyclic π-conjugated molecules with four pyrrole rings linked by methine (meso) carbons. Natural porphyrins, such as chlorophyll and heme, and artificial porphyrins, such as tetrabenzopophyrin and phthalocyanine (Pc), have an overwhelming presence as functional materials in science. Substitution of the peripheral carbon atoms of porphyrin rings with other elements is a promising approach for imparting various functions to porphyrins. Diazaporphyrins (DAPs) are a class of compounds that have two meso-nitrogen atoms. Porphyrins and DAPs, which are both aromatic compounds with 18π electrons distributed throughout the macrocyclic circuit, have very similar structures. However, DAPs exhibit characteristic electrochemical and optical properties that differ significantly from those of the porphyrins. These differences are not only attributed to the electronic effects of the meso-nitrogen atoms but also to the molecular symmetry intrinsic to the DAP ring.1,2 For example, Gouterman's four orbitals (i.e., HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1) of a nickel(II) complex of porphyrin with the intrinsic D4h symmetry point group become non-degenerate in the 5,15-DAP counterpart with the D2h point group (Fig. 1).3,4 In addition, both the HOMO/HOMO−1 and LUMO/LUMO+1 of 5,15-DAP are lower in energy than the corresponding porphyrin orbitals. These degeneracies allow the HOMO-to-LUMO transition of DAPs, leading to a red-shift in the Q bands and an increase in their intensity compared with those of porphyrins, as shown in Fig. 2.4 Furthermore, DAPs are more electron-accepting and resistant to oxidation than their porphyrin counterparts. Consequently, DAPs are attractive materials for diversifying the physical properties of porphyrin π-electron systems without significantly altering their frameworks. Furthermore, there has been a growing interest in the use of DAPs in materials science, such as organic solar cells, semiconductors, and biomedical agents for diagnostic imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, typical methods used to prepare porphyrins and Pcs are not applicable to the synthesis of DAP skeletons. In this context, establishing general methods for the synthesis of various DAP derivatives based on a well-elaborated molecular design is highly important.

This review primarily focuses on recent advances in the synthesis of DAPs and other peripherally aza-, oxa-, and/or thia-substituted porphyrinoids, including 5,15-diazaporphyrin (denoted hereafter as DAP), 5,10-diazaporphyrin (5,10-DAP), 5,15-disubstituted 5,15-diazaporphyrin (R2DAP or DHDAP), 5-substituted 5,15-diazaporphyrin (RDAP), 5-substituted 5-aza-15-oxaporphyrin (RAOP), 5-substituted 5-aza-15-thiaporphyrin (RATP), 5,15-dioxaporphyrin (DOP), 5,15-dithiaporphyrin (DTP) (Fig. 3), and some related tetrapyrrolic macrocycles with two meso- or β-nitrogen atoms. These peripherally modified heteroporphyrins exhibit a wide range of electrochemical and optical properties, depending on the number and combination of heteroatoms in their periphery.

The following sections have been divided according to the type of compound, and each of these sections has been further divided into subsections according to the synthetic method. In all these subsections, recent representative reactions that provide valuable guidelines for designing DAP-based materials are featured, in addition to some historically important methods reported earlier. This review includes several key reactions described in our previous review published in early 2017.2 These are also necessary for understanding recent research advances in the synthesis of meso-modified heteroporphyrinoids. The abbreviations for compounds, reagents, and technical terms are listed in section 10. Owing to page limitations, we have provided only a brief discussion pertaining to the structure–property relationships and applications of the reported DAP derivatives. With regard to DAPs, tetrabenzo-annulated and expanded DAPs have been excluded unless otherwise noted. It is strongly recommended that readers refer to the original references if they would like to use the synthetic methods and further develop the DAP-based materials described in this review. Note that we have not cited all the references concerning DAPs in this review. Several leading reviews and books on azaporphyrin chemistry including DAPs are currently available.5–9
2. Synthesis of 5,15-diazaporphyrins
2.1. Metal-free [2 + 2] type aza-annulation of dipyrrins
In the 1930s, Fischer et al. reported several DAPs substituted with alkyl groups at all β positions, which were produced by the reaction of 1,9-dibromo-3,7-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-2,8-dimethyldipyrrin hydrobromide with ammonia in pyridine10,11 at high temperatures or by the alkaline hydrolysis of 1,9-bis(ethoxycarbonylamino)-3,7-diethyl-2,8-dimethyldipyrrin, followed by condensation with the loss of ammonia, as shown in Scheme 1; however, the isolated yield of DAP 1H2 was extremely low (≤0.3%).
 Scheme 1  Fischer's synthesis of 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaalkyl-DAP 1H2. 
Comprehensive syntheses of partially meso-modified tetrabenzoazaporphyrins were achieved using condensation reactions of phthalonitrile derivatives with different ratios of Grignard reagents or metal salts (schemes are not shown here). In this protocol, tetrabenzo-5,15-diazaporphyrins (TBDAPs) are obtained together with other tetrabenzo-fused azaporphyrins; however, careful separation is often required to isolate pure TBDAPs. To circumvent this difficulty, Cheprakov et al. applied the [2 + 2]-type aza-annulation reaction of 5-aryl-1,9-bis(azidocarbonyl)dipyrrins to the selective synthesis of 10,20-diaryl-TBDAP free bases 2H2, in which the azidocarbonyl groups of the dipyrrin precursors were initially transformed to amino groups via Curtius rearrangement (Scheme 2).12

2.2. Metal-templated [2 + 2] type aza-annulation of dipyrrins
In 1966, Johnson et al. reported the first efficient metal-templated [2 + 2]-type aza-annulation reaction of 1,9-dibromodipyrrin using sodium azide and DMF as the meso-nitrogen source and solvent, respectively, for the synthesis of a copper(II) complex of DAP (CuDAP). Boiling a mixture of the copper(II)–bis(1,9-dibromo-3,7-diethyl-2,8-dimethyldipyrrin) complex and NaN3 in DMF for 15 min afforded 1Cu in 75% yield (Scheme 3).13 Nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10,20-diaryl-DAP 3M (M = Ni, Cu) were also prepared by metal-templated cyclization of the corresponding metal–bis(1,9-dibromo-5-mesityldipyrrin) complexes according to Johnson's protocol (Scheme 4).4 Although the distribution of the cyclized products and their yields vary considerably depending on the reaction conditions, some additives were found to be effective in obtaining 3M in good yields. For instance, the addition of copper(I) iodide, which is in situ converted to copper(I) azide, suppresses the formation of byproducts and improves the yield of 3M.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of CuDAP 1Cu. 
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of metal(II) complexes of 10,20-dimesityl-DAP 3M (M = Ni, Cu). 
Okujima et al. applied the metal-templated cyclization of bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (BCOD)-fused dipyrromethane for the synthesis of BCOD-fused CuDAP 4, although the yield was low (Scheme 5).14 When 4 was heated as a solid in a glass tube at 220 °C for 10 min, copper(II) complex of TBDAP (CuTBDAP) 5 was formed in a quantitative yield.
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of BCOD-fused CuDAP 4 and CuTBDAP 5. 
Recently, Yamada et al. reported an improved method for the synthesis of BCOD-fused CuDAPs 4 and 6 from their corresponding BCOD-fused 1,9-dibromodipyrrins (Scheme 6).15 Metal-templated cyclization was promoted by the addition of N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA) as a ligand. Heating thin films of 4 and 6 deposited on a glass substrate at 200 °C caused thermal conversion into CuTBDAPs 5 and 2Cu, respectively, via retro Diels–Alder reactions.
 Scheme 6  Synthesis of BCOD-fused CuDAPs 4/6 and CuTBDAPs 5/2Cu. 
As described above, the core skeleton of DAP is typically constructed via metal-templated [2 + 2]-type aza-annulation reactions. Berezin et al. applied this protocol to the synthesis of a free base of β-alkylated DAP.16,17 Heating a mixture of 1,9-dibromo-3,7-dibutyl-2,8-dimethyldipyrrin, NaN3, and lead(II) acetylacetonate [Pb(acac)2] in DMF afforded DAP free base 7H2 in 33% yield (Scheme 7). The yield of 7H2 decreased to 10%, when the same reaction was performed in the absence of Pb(acac)2. These results suggest that the lead(II) complex of DAP was initially formed, and its Pb–N bonds were hydrolyzed under the reaction conditions. The exclusive formation of 7H2 indicates that the lead(II) ion acts as a metal template and can be readily removed after aza-annulation.
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaalkyl-DAP 7H2. 
The lead(II)-templated aza-annulation method was also effective for the synthesis of 10,20-diaryl-DAP free bases. For example, heating a MeOH solution containing 1,9-dibromo-5-mesityldipyrrin, Pb(acac)2, and NaN3 at 65 °C resulted in the formation of a mixture of PbDAP 3Pb and H2DAP 3H2, which was subsequently treated with TFA to obtain 3H2 as the sole isolable product (Scheme 8).18 This protocol is commonly used to synthesize various DAP-free bases.
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of 10,20-dimesityl-DAP 3Pb and 3H2. 
Yamada et al. used a combination of the Pb-templated aza-annulation and retro Diels–Alder reactions to synthesize 10,20-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)tetrabenzo-5,15-diazaporphine 8, which was isolated in 14% yield based on the BCOD-fused 5-(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-1,9-dibromodipyrrin (Scheme 9).19 Single crystal FETs fabricated with soluble TBDAP 8 showed the maximum hole mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of 10,20-dialkynyl-TBDAP 8. 
Unsymmetrically substituted 10,20-diaryl-DAP 9 was also prepared using the Pb-templated cyclization method (Scheme 10).20 Heating a mixture of two different 1,9-dibromo-5-aryldipyrrins in propanol, together with NaN3 and Pb(acac)2, followed by treatment with TFA, yielded three different DAPs. Purification of this product mixture by column chromatography allowed for the isolation of 9 in 4% yield. Free base 9 was subsequently converted into a ZnDAP–fullerene dyad via stepwise transformation of the para-substituents and metalation, as described in Scheme 10.

Song et al. prepared meso–meso directly linked porphyrin–DAP–porphyrin triads 12MM′ using the conventional metal-templated method (Scheme 11).21 Metal complexation of Ni-porphyrin-appended 1,9-dibromodipyrrin 10 with M(OAc)2 (M = Ni, Zn) afforded the corresponding metal–bis(dipyrrin) complexes 11M, which were subsequently treated with NaN3 and CuI in DMF to afford the corresponding triads 12MNi (M = Ni, Zn) in 12–35% yields. When 12NiNi was treated with conc. H2SO4 in CH2Cl2, selective demetallation occurred on the two terminal porphyrin units to yield 12NiH2. Full free-base triad 12H2H2 was synthesized by the metal-templated reaction of 10 with Pb(acac)2 and NaN3 and subsequent demetallation, although the overall yield was low. The Q bands of the DAP chromophore in 12MM′ were intensified and red-shifted compared to those of the corresponding DAP monomers, indicating the expanded π-electronic network through the meso–meso linkages.

2.3. Synthesis of metal complexes of DAP from free bases
In general, metal complexes of DAPs other than CuDAPs and NiDAPs have been prepared by treatment of free bases with the corresponding metal salts. Scheme 12 shows the metal insertion reactions of 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaalkyl-DAP 7H2 and 10,20-diaryl-DAP 3H2, which afforded the corresponding metal complexes 7M and 3M, respectively. The central metals include zinc(II),18 indium(III),22 manganese(II),23 iron(III),24–28 ruthenium(II),29 cobalt(II),30 nickel(II),31 palladium(II),18,31,32 platinum(II),18,31 copper(II),31 and cerium(III).33,34 The peripheral complexation of DAPs with metal salts at the meso-nitrogen atoms is described in section 2.7.
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of metal complexes of DAPs 7M and 3M. 
In Miyake's synthesis of iron(III)–DAP complexes from 3H2 and other DAP free bases, μ-oxo-bridged FeDAP dimers were obtained as the initial products, which were converted without isolation to the corresponding Fe(Cl)DAPs, including 3Fe(Cl) by acidolysis with an aqueous HCl solution (Scheme 13).28 ESR spectroscopy and SQUID measurements revealed that the spin states of the iron(III) center in the Fe(Cl)DAPs were spin-admixed states (S = 5/2 and 3/2), in which the latter state was the minor component. The catalytic activities of 3Fe(Cl) in the direct oxidation of ethylbenzenes were also investigated.

Miyake et al. reported photo-induced axial-ligand exchange reactions of ruthenium(II) complexes of 10,20-dimesityl-DAP.29 The dissociation of the axial CO ligand from 3Ru(py)(CO) upon visible-light irradiation in the presence of excess pyridine afforded 3Ru(py)2 (Scheme 14). RuDAP complex 3Ru(py)(CO) showed no catalytic activity in the epoxidation of p-chlorostyrene with 2,6-dichloropyridine N-oxide.

Cheprakov et al. prepared metal complexes of TBDAPs 2M (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Zn) from 2H2 (Scheme 15) and investigated their structures and optical properties in detail.12

2.4. Peripheral functionalization of DAP: halogenation
In the last decade, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of general methods for the peripheral functionalization of the pyrrolic carbons of 10,20-diaryl-DAPs with various electrophiles and nucleophiles. Among them, regioselective bromination of the DAP ring is of utmost importance because β-brominated DAPs can be used as substrates in various metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to synthesize β-functionalized DAPs. Scheme 16 demonstrates the bromination of 10,20-dimesityl-DAPs 3M (M = Ni, Cu, Zn). By treating 3M with NBS in CHCl3, 3-bromo-MDAPs 13M or 3,7,13,17-tetrabromo-NiDAP 14Ni can be obtained in moderate to good yields.4 The exclusive regioselectivity of this bromination reaction may be attributable to the steric hindrance of the mesityl groups and the electronic effect of the meso-nitrogen atoms.
 Scheme 16  Regioselective bromination of 3M with NBS. 
Multiple bromination of DAP with NBS proceeds in a stepwise manner via mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrabromo-DAPs. To reduce the number of regioisomeric products, an alternative method was reported for the synthesis of 3,7-dibromo-DAP 15, in which 1,2,9-tribromo-5-mesityldipyrrin was used for metal-templated [2 + 2]-type aza-annulation (Scheme 17).35 The syn isomer was separated from its anti isomer using column chromatography. Similarly, 3,7,13,17-tetrabromo-DAP 14H2 was synthesized from 1,2,8,9-tetrabromo-5-mesityldipyrrin.36
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of brominated DAPs 15 and 14H2. 
Recently, Shinokubo et al. reported a different type of halogenation of 10,20-dimesityl-DAPs using a combination of gold(III) and silver(I) salts (Scheme 18).37 Treatment of 3M (M = 2H, Ni) with 3 equiv. of AuX3 (X = Cl, Br) in the presence of 6 equiv. of AgOTf in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) at 85 °C resulted in halogenation at the meta position of the mesityl rings, affording monohalo-DAP 16M-X and dihalo-DAP 17M-X (M = 2H, Ni; X = Cl, Br). Attempts to use catalytic amounts of AuX3 and AgOTf with the assistance of a stoichiometric amount of NBS resulted in peripheral bromination to yield 3-bromo-DAP 13M as the major product.

2.5. Peripheral functionalization of DAP: carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions
Brominated DAPs have been used as substrates in various transition-metal-catalyzed C–C-bond-forming reactions, such as Stille coupling, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, Sonogashira coupling, and reductive homo coupling. Scheme 19 summarizes the Stille reactions of 3-Br-MDAP 13M (M = Ni, Cu) and 3,7,13,17-tetrabromo-NiDAP 14Ni with aryltributylstannanes in the presence of the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst, which afforded the corresponding β-arylated DAPs 18, 19M, 20M, and 21.4,38,39
 Scheme 19  Synthesis of β-arylated DAPs via Stille reactions of 13M and 14Ni. 
3-Br-MDAPs 13M (M = Zn, Ni) also underwent Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with various arylboronic acids or esters to afford the corresponding 3-aryl-MDAPs.40,41 Selected examples are summarized in Scheme 20. The para-substituted phenyl groups were efficiently introduced under condition A to yield 22M, whereas Zn-porphyrin (ZnPor) units were introduced under condition B to produce ZnDAP–ZnPor dyads 23 and 24.
 Scheme 20  Synthesis of β-arylated DAPs via Suzuki–Miyaura reactions of 13M. 
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 3,7-dibromo-ZnDAP 15 with 4-(ethoxycarbonyl)phenylboronic acid afforded 3,7-diaryl-ZnDAP 25, which was then converted to 3,7-diaryl-13,17-dibromo-ZnDAP 26via regioselective bromination with NBS (Scheme 21).35 The second Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 26 with p-aminophenylboronic acids, followed by alkaline hydrolysis of the two ester groups, gave donor–acceptor-type 3,7,13,17-tetraaryl-ZnDAP dicarboxylic acids 27. TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using 27 exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 1.7–2.0%. Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of 14H2 with mesitylboronic acid yielded hexamesityl-DAP 28H2, which was then converted to iron(III) complex 28Fe.36
 Scheme 21  Synthesis of 3,7,13,17-tetraaryl-DAPs 27 and 28M. 
The Sonogashira coupling reaction of 3-Br-MDAPs 13M (M = Zn, Ni) with tris(isopropyl)silylacetylene, followed by treatment of the reaction mixture with Bu4NF yielded 3-ethynyl-MDAPs 29M, which further underwent several coupling reactions (Scheme 22).42,43 Sonogashira reactions of 29M (M = Zn or Ni) with ethyl p-iodobenzoate and 3-Br-NiDAP 13Ni gave 3-(4-carboxypheny)ethynyl-ZnDAP 30 and ethyne-bridged NiDAP dimer 31, respectively. Glaser coupling of 29Ni in the presence of copper(II) chloride in air afforded butadiyne-bridged NiDAP dimer 32.
 Scheme 22  Synthesis of β-alkynylated DAPs via Sonogashira reactions of 13M. 
The reductive homo-coupling reactions of 13M (M = Ni, Cu) proceeded in the presence of a catalytic amount of PdCl2(dppf) and stoichiometric amount of potassium acetate in DMF to afford β–β′-directly linked MDAP dimers 33M (Scheme 23).43 These dimers have highly flat structures with intramolecular N⋯H–C hydrogen bonding interactions, and the two DAP π-electron systems are efficiently conjugated.
 Scheme 23  Synthesis of β,β′-directly linked DAP dimers 33M. 
The treatment of 10,20-dimesityl-NiDAP 3Ni with an excess amount of alkyllithium reagents (RLi; R = Me, Bu, sBu, tBu) in toluene at −78 °C gave a mixture of the corresponding 3-R-NiDAPs 34 and nickel(II) complexes of 3-R-5,15-diazachlorin (3-R-NiDAC) 35 (Scheme 24).44 The relative yields of 34 and 35 varied considerably, depending on the nature of the R groups. When PhLi was used instead of RLi, 22Ni (X = H) was isolated in 18% yield, together with a trace amount of 3-Ph-NiDAC. Nucleophilic addition occurs exclusively at position-3, which highlights the directing effect of the neighboring meso nitrogen atom in 3Ni. Indeed, DFT calculations and isotope-labeling experiments supported that the nucleophilic attack of RLi is facilitated by the assistance of meso-N–Li coordination.

3-Bromo-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl-substituted DAP free bases 16H2-Br and 17H2-Br underwent Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with arylboronic acids using SPhos as the phosphine ligand, affording the corresponding meta-arylated products 36 and 37, respectively, in excellent yields (Scheme 25).37 Diarylated products 37 were found to exist as inseparable mixtures of rotational isomers.

2.6. Peripheral functionalization of DAP: carbon–heteroatom bond-forming reactions
Carbon–heteroatom (C–X; X = N, O, S, P) bond formation at the β-pyrrolic carbon of MDAPs has been achieved using several methods. Treatment of 3M (M = Ni, Cu) with copper(II) nitrate in acetic anhydride exclusively afforded 3-nitro-MDAPs 38M, which were converted to the corresponding 3-amino-MDAPs 39M by reducing the nitro group with SnCl2–HCl (Scheme 26).45 The C–N cross-coupling reaction of 39M with 3-bromo-MDAP 13M (M = Ni, Cu) under standard Buchwald–Hartwig conditions afforded NH-bridged MDAP dimers 40M, whereas the treatment of 39Ni with DDQ yielded pyrazine-fused NiDAP dimer 41via oxidative dimerization at the β-pyrrolic carbons. The effects of the intervening NH spacer on the optical and electrochemical properties of the NH-bridged dimers 40M were investigated.

The nucleophilic substitution reactions of 3-bromo-MDAPs 13M (M = Ni, Cu, 2H) with phenol and p-toluenethiol proceeded in the presence of Cs2CO3, affording 3-phenoxy-MDAPs 42M and 3-phenylthio-NiDAP 43, respectively (Scheme 27).46 C–S coupling between 13M and sodium sulfinate took place in DMF to give 3-tosyl-MDAPs 44M, whereas C–P coupling between 13M and R2P(O)H (R = OEt, Ph) occurred in the presence of Pd2dba3, rac-BINAP, and Cs2CO3 to give the corresponding 3-phosphoryl-MDAPs 45M and 46 (Scheme 27).
 Scheme 27  Reactions of 3-Br-MDAPs 13M with O-, S-, and P-nucleophiles. 
Our group established a convenient method for the direct amination of 10,20-dimesityl-DAPs 3M (M = Ni, Cu, Pd, 2H) with aromatic amines under mild conditions (Scheme 28).47 For example, 3Ni reacted with excess pyrazole and imidazole in the presence of Cs2CO3 and CuI in DMF at 120 °C to yield 3,7,13,17-tetraxis(1-pyrazolyl)-NiDAP 47 and 3,7,13,17-tetraxis(1-imidazolyl)NiDAP 48, respectively. The conversion of 3Ni to 47 occurred, albeit slowly, without the copper catalyst. The direct multi-amination of 3M (M = Ni, Pd, Cu) with secondary aromatic amines (Ph2NH, PhMeNH, etc.) also proceeded in the presence of excess NaOH and MS3A at room temperature to afford the corresponding 3,7,13,17-tetraamino-MDAPs 49M. This protocol requires an adequate amount of dioxygen to ensure complete conversion from 3M to 49M, which suggests that an addition–oxidative re-aromatization mechanism operates in this multiple direct β-C–N bond formation. The reaction of 3Ni with primary aromatic amines exclusively produced the corresponding 3-amino-NiDAPs 50.
 Scheme 28  Direct amination of MDAPs 3M with aromatic amines. 
Hydrophilic DAPs are potential PDT sensitizers because they exhibit high performance in the photosensitized production of singlet oxygen (1O2) under irradiation with visible light of long wavelength and/or near-infrared (NIR) light. Direct multiple amination via C–H activation was applied to the synthesis of NIR-responsive MDAPs bearing eight carboxy groups (Scheme 29).48 Pd complex 51Pd showed sufficient 1O2-generation efficiency and exhibited phototoxicity toward HeLa cells when irradiated at 720 nm with a pulsed laser.
 Scheme 29  Synthesis of NIR-responsive MDAPs 51M. 
Heating a DMF solution containing β,β′-dibromo-DAPs 15M (M = Ni, Cu) and excess TolSO2Na at 80 °C resulted in the formation of 3,7,13,17-tetrasulfonyl-DAPs 52M and 3,7,13,17-tetrasulfonyl-5,15-dihydro-DAPs 53M (Scheme 30).46 When 3Ni was used instead of 15Ni, 52Ni was obtained in a low yield, indicating that at least two sulfonyl groups are necessary to facilitate the direct substitution of the C–H groups. It is likely that the sulfinate ion undergoes nucleophilic addition onto the DAP ring, and the resulting anionic intermediate is oxidized by atmospheric dioxygen or sulfonylated 18π MDAPs.

2.7. Peripheral functionalization of DAP: meso-nitrogen–metal bond-forming reactions
DAPs behave as weak Lewis bases for protons and cationic species. For example, the meso-nitrogen atom of CuDAP 6Cu can be protonated in a H2SO4–CH3COOH medium with a pK value of 3.2.49 Chizhova et al. isolated a small amount of ternary complex 54 as a side-product in the synthesis of 7Pd from 7H2 and PdCl2 (Scheme 31).50 The structure of 54 was determined based on the results of elemental analysis; however, no other characterization data were reported for 54.

Shinokubo et al. reported the synthesis of several meso-N-coordinated metal complexes and successfully characterized their structures by X-ray diffraction analysis. When 3H2 was treated with 3 equiv. of AuCl3 in 1,2-dichloroethane, mono- and bis-gold(III) complexes of H2DAP 55 and 56 were isolated in 32% and 25% yields, respectively (Scheme 32).37 These peripherally coordinated gold(III) complexes were sufficiently stable to be separated using silica-gel column chromatography. Complexes 55 and 56 exhibited red shifts in their Q bands compared to the DAP ligand 3H2.

3-(2-Pyridyl)-NiDAP 18 behaved as a chelating ligand in complexation reactions with rhenium(I), ruthenium(II), and platinum(II) salts, affording the corresponding peripherally coordinated metal complexes 57, 58, and 59 in 71%–96% yields (Scheme 33).38 The N,N-chelation structures of these metal complexes were elucidated by X-ray diffraction analysis; the meso-nitrogen and neighboring pyridyl nitrogen were both coordinated to the metal centers.
 Scheme 33  Complexation reactions of 3-(2-pyridyl)-NiDAP 18 with Re, Pt, and Ru salts. 
Recently, the synthesis of reversibly redox-switchable double-pincer bispalladium–DAP complexes was reported by Shinokubo et al. (Scheme 34).39 The peripheral coordination between 3,7,13,17-tetrakis(2-pyridyl)-NiDAP 21 (R = 2-py) and Pd(OAc)2 followed by treatment with HCl afforded the cationic palladium(II) complex with the chloride counter ion 60-Cl, which was then converted to more soluble tetrafluoroborate 60-BF4via an anion exchange reaction with NaBF4. The 18π-electron DAP ring of 60-BF4 was reduced by treatment with triethylamine and hydrazine monohydrate to produce the corresponding 19π-electron radical cation 61 and neutral 20π-electron complex 62, respectively. The oxidation of 61 and 62 with tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl tetrafluoroborate regenerated 60-BF4 in quantitative yields (not shown in Scheme 34).

2.8. Peripheral functionalization of DAP: miscellaneous reactions
To improve the solubility of the DAP-based photosensitizer in aqueous media and enhance its penetration in cancer cells for PDT applications, Shinokubo et al. introduced D-mannose units on the meso-mesityl groups of 10,20-dimesityl-DAP free base, through the SN2 reaction of 37 (Ar = 4-HOC6H4) with a protected mannose-appended alkyl bromide (Scheme 35).51 The acetyl groups on the mannose moieties of coupling product 63 were cleaved cleanly upon treatment with NaOMe in THF at room temperature. The mannose-appended DAP 64, which was highly soluble in water containing DMSO (5%), showed low dark cytotoxicity and strong in vitro photodynamic activity not only at the nanomolar level but also at short light irradiation times under photoexcitation at 650 nm.
 Scheme 35  Synthesis of hydrophilic D-mannose-appended DAP 64. 
Ikeda et al. used a different approach to enhance the water solubility of DAPs, as shown in Scheme 36.52 Inclusion complexes of 10,20-diaryl-DAP 3H2 in trimethyl-β-cyclodextrin (TMe-β-CDx) were obtained using a mechanochemical high-speed vibration milling (HSVM) apparatus. In water, each DAP molecule of 65 was sandwiched between two TMe-β-CDxs. Under photoirradiation at wavelengths longer than 620 nm, 62 displayed high photodynamic activity toward HeLa cells.
 Scheme 36  Synthesis of inclusion complexes of DAPs in trimethyl-β-cyclodextrin 65. 
In our study on the synthesis of water-soluble DAPs, we established a new method for converting 5,15-dialkyl-CuDAPs 66 to the corresponding 5,15-unsubstituted CuDAPs 3Cu (Scheme 37).53 The treatment of 66 with NaOH in EtOH–H2O at 60 °C resulted in N-dealkylation, yielding 3Cu in moderate yields. The source of meso-N-alkyl substituents of 66 was β-alanine alkyl esters; hence, the meso-nitrogen was derived from its amino group.
 Scheme 37  Synthesis of 10,20-diaryl-CuDAPs 3Cu from 66. 
3. Synthesis of 5,10-diazaporphyrins
Osuka et al. reported the first rational synthesis of 5,10-diazaporphyrins (5,10-DAPs) 68 and 69H2via nucleophilic substitution reactions of α,α′-dibromotripyrrin 67 with 3,4-di(ethylsulfanyl)pyrrole-2,5-diimine and diiminoisoindoline, respectively (Scheme 38).54 Hydrogenative desulfanylation of 68 with RANEY® Ni afforded β-unsubstituted 5,10-DAP 70H2 in 10% yield along with 12,13-dihydro-5,10-diazachlorin 71 in 31% yield, whereas Pd-catalyzed reduction of 68 with Et3SiH afforded 70H2 in 22% yield along with 7,8-dihydro-5,10-diazachlorin 72 in 63% yield (Scheme 39).
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of 5,10-DAPs 68 and 69H2. 
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of 5,10-DAP 70H2 and 5,10-diazachlorins 71 and 72. 
Treatment of 5,10-DAP free bases 69H2 and 70H2 with Zn(OAc)2 yielded the corresponding zinc(II) complexes 69Zn and 70Zn, respectively, both of which were hardly soluble in halogenated solvents (Scheme 40).54
 Scheme 40  Synthesis of 5,10-ZnDAPs 69Zn and 70Zn. 
4. Synthesis of 5,15-diazaporphyrinoids with substituents on meso-N atoms
4.1. Hydrogenation of DAP on meso-nitrogen atoms
5,15-Dihydro-5,15-diazaporphyrin (DHDAP) has a 20π-electron circuit involving two lone pairs on two meso-nitrogen atoms. Therefore, DHDAP and its derivatives have isoelectronic structures corresponding to porphyrin dianions.
Recently, several approaches have been developed for the synthesis of 20π-electron DAPs. Shinokubo et al. reported the synthesis of 10,20-dimesityl-DHDAP as nickel(II) complex and free base; the reduction of 10,20-dimesityl-MDAPs 3M (M = Ni, H2) with N,N′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,4-dihydropyrazine in THF occurred exclusively at the meso-NC bonds, furnishing the corresponding DHDAPs 73M after methanolysis (Scheme 41).55 Both 73Ni and 73H2 are antiaromatic and exhibit paratropic ring-current effects in their NMR spectra. However, DHDAPs 73M are air-sensitive and readily oxidized to the corresponding DAPs 3M in solution under aerobic conditions. This contrasts with the behavior of 3,7,13,17-tetrasulfonyl-DHDAPs 53M, which show resistance to aerobic oxidation.46
 Scheme 41  Synthesis of DHDAPs 73M. 
4.2. Metal-templated [2 + 2] type aza-annulation of dipyrrins
Our group reported a metal-templated method for the synthesis of nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of 5,10,15,20-tetraaryl-5,15-diazaporphyrinoid (R2DAP; R = aryl) (Scheme 42).56,57 Metal(II) complexes of 1-arylamino-9-chloro-5-mesityldipyrrins 74M (M = N, Zn) were prepared from the corresponding dipyrrins and M(OAc)2 and then used for metal-templated [2 + 2]-type aza-annulation reactions. Heating DMF solutions of 74Ni in the presence of K2CO3 afforded R2NiDAPs 75Ni, while heating toluene solutions of 74Zn in the presence of NaOtBu afforded R2ZnDAPs 75Zn. In sharp contrast to the isoelectronic 73Ni, 75Ni involving the 20π-electron circuit is highly air-stable. The oxidation of 75M with AgPF6 produced hexafluorophosphate salts (X = PF6) of the corresponding 19π-electron radical cations 76M or 18π-electron dications 77M, depending on the amount of oxidant. When Magic blue was used as an oxidant instead of AgPF6, hexachloroantimonate complexes of R2DAP 77M (X = SbCl6) were obtained. Similar to 75M, R2DAP cations 76M and 77M could be handled in air. The one- and two-electron reductions of 77M with cobaltocene (CoCp2) produced 76M and 75M, respectively. Sodium borohydride can also be used as a reducing agent. These results indicate that the oxidation state of the DAP ring in R2DAPs is reversibly switchable. NMR spectroscopy revealed that 75M and 77M have antiaromatic and aromatic characters, respectively.
 Scheme 42  Synthesis of R2DAPs 75M, 76M, and 77M (M = Ni, Zn). 
When 1-amino-9-chlorodipyrrins were treated with one equiv. of Cu(OAc)2 in CH2Cl2–MeOH, 19π-electron R2DAP radical cations 76Cu (X = PF6) were obtained after the anion-exchange reaction with KPF6 (Scheme 43).57 The copper(II) salt most likely promotes the intramolecular N–C coupling of intermediary CuII-bis(dipyrrin) complexes, but also oxidizes the resulting 20π-electron DAP ring. The oxidation of 76Cu with AgPF6 afforded the corresponding 18π-electron dications 77Cu, whereas reduction with CoCp2 gave the corresponding 20π-electron complexes 75Cu. Similarly, cobalt(II) complexes of 19π-electron R2DAP radical cations 76Co and 18π-electron R2DAP dications 77Co were synthesized according to the reactions shown in Scheme 43.58 The oxidation state of the cobalt center varies by the axial coordination of pyridine.
 Scheme 43  Synthesis of R2DAPs 76M and 77M (M = Cu, Co). 
Nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of 5,15-dialkyl-10,20-diaryl-5,15-diazaporphyrinoid (R2DAP; R = alkyl) were also prepared by metal-templated cyclization of the corresponding metal salts with 1-(alkylamino)-9-halo-5-aryldipyrrins.53,59Scheme 44 shows the synthesis of copper(II) complexes of R2DAPs 78. The 19π-electron DAP ring in 78 was reversibly converted to the 20π- and 18π-electron DAP rings by redox reactions.
 Scheme 44  Synthesis of 5,15-dialkyl-DAPs 78. 
Our group reported the first examples of 5,10,20-triaryl-5,15-diazaporphyrinoids (RDAP; R = aryl).60 The treatment of Ni(OAc)2 with an equimolar mixture of 1-benzylamino-5-mesityl-9-chlorodipyrrin and 1-arylamino-5-mesityl-9-chlorodipyrrins in CH2Cl2–MeOH yielded nickel(II)–bis(dipyrrin) complexes 79 bearing different ligands, which were isolated using silica-gel column chromatography (Scheme 45). Metal-templated cyclization of 79 in the presence of K2CO3 or KOH in DMF at 110 °C, followed by treatment with AgPF6 afforded nickel(II) complexes of 18π-electron RDAP cations 80 in 15–33% yields. The N-benzyl group is eliminated during the [2 + 2] annulation step. The one-electron reduction of 80 with CoCp2 proceeded cleanly to give neutral 19π-electron RDAP radicals 81, which were isolated as air-stable solids by recrystallization from MeOH.
 Scheme 45  Synthesis of RDAPs 80 and 81. 
4.3. Peripheral functionalization of R2DAPs
The hydrophilicity of R2DAPs can be controlled by the diversification of the N-alkyl or N-aryl groups and the redox reactions of their DAP rings. Deprotection of the O-silyl groups in the N-alkyl chains of 78 (X = OSitBuMe2) by treatment with Bu4NF afforded 5,15-bis(3-hydroxypropyl)-DAP radical cation 82, which was further oxidized with AgPF6 to dication 83 (Scheme 46).59 It is noteworthy that 82 is not soluble but 83 is slightly soluble in water; the increase in the charge from +1 to +2 improves the hydrophilic character of the DAP chromophore.
 Scheme 46  Synthesis of hydrophilic R2DAPs 82 and 83. 

Fig. 4 shows amphiphilic R2DAPs prepared by the metal-templated cyclization of the corresponding metal–bis(dipyrrin) complexes 74M. Radical cation 84, bearing four para-carboxy groups, is hardly soluble in neutral water but sufficiently soluble in alkaline water as carboxylates.61 Dication 85, prepared from 84 and 3-aminopropane-1,2-diol, was soluble in neutral water.61 Interestingly, the water solubility of 85 almost disappeared when its DAP ring was reduced to the neutral 20π-electron state. The same was true for dications 86M (M = Zn, Cu, Ni) bearing four triethyleneglycol or tetraethyleneglycol arms.62 These results indicate that the water solubility of R2DAPs varies significantly, depending on the charge of the DAP ring.
 Fig. 4  Structures of amphiphilic R2DAPs 84, 85, and 86M. 
Ammoniumyl radicals generated by the electrochemical oxidation of doubly triphenylamine-appended R2DAP dications 87M (M = Ni, Zn, Cu) underwent intermolecular oxidative coupling at the para position of their N-phenyl rings to form the corresponding benzidine-linked R2DAP polymers 88M after the rapid elimination of two protons (Scheme 47).63 Polymers 88M exhibited multiple reversible redox processes over a range of 2.5 V. Notably, R2DAP–benzidine polymer 88Ni fabricated on a comb-shaped electrode exhibited the electrical conductivity of 2 × 10−3 S m−1, which is comparable with the conductivity of a P3HT-coated electrode measured under the same conditions.
 Scheme 47  Synthesis of 88M by electrochemical polymerization of R2DAPs 87M. 
Dehydrative condensation of 2,6-dihydroxyphenyl-substituted R2DAP dication 89 with nonanedioic acid, decanedioic acid, or undecanedioic acid in the presence of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in THF afforded the corresponding Cn-strapped 20π-electron R2DAPs 90-Cn (n = 7, 8, 9) with two –OOC(CH2)nCOO– bridges above and below the DAP π-plane (Scheme 48).64 The treatment of neutral R2DAPs 90-Cn with 2 equiv. of AgPF6 in CH2Cl2 yielded the corresponding 18π-electron R2DAP dications 91-Cn. The 1H NMR spectra of 90-Cn and 91-Cn showed paratropic and diatropic ring-current effects, respectively, on the methylene protons in their spatially separated alkyl-chain straps. These NMR data were used to evaluate the antiaromaticity and aromaticity of R2DAPs.
 Scheme 48  Synthesis of Cn-strapped R2DAPs 90-Cn and 91-Cn. 
4.4. Alkylation of DAP on meso-nitrogen atoms
Shinokubo et al. reported the highly site-selective methylation of DAPs to prepare 5-methyl-DAPs 92M (M = 2H, Ni, Zn), which was achieved by treatment of the corresponding DAPs 3M with methyl triflate (MeOTf) in DCE or 1,4-dioxane (Scheme 49).65 Even in the presence of excess MeOTf, the second N-methylation at position-15 did not occur in these combinations. It is also worth noting that the inner nitrogen atoms of the MeDAP free base 92H2 were not methylated. Deprotonation of 92H2 to neutral 18π-electron derivative 93 was accomplished using amino-functionalized silica gel (AFSG).
 Scheme 49  Synthesis of RDAPs 92M and 93. 
In a recent study, Miyake et al. reported stepwise N-methylation of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(II) complexes of N-free DAPs.30 Treatment of 3M (M = Ru(CO), Co) with 1–1.2 equiv. of MeOTf in 1,4-dioxane or DCE afforded the corresponding metal(II) complexes of MeDAP 92M in 33–70% yields (Scheme 49). Further N-methylation of 92M (M = Ru(CO), Co) with excess MeOTf in DCE at 60 °C provided the corresponding metal complexes of Me2DAP 94M in 72–82% yields (Scheme 50). The other MeDAPs 92M (M = Ni, Zn, H2) did not undergo a second N-methylation under the same conditions, indicating that the central Ru and Co metals play an important role in promoting the second N-methylation of the cationic DAP ring. The catalytic activities of 3Co, 92Co, and 94Co (Ar = Ph) for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 were evaluated.
 Scheme 50  Synthesis of R2DAPs 94M. 
5. Synthesis of other 5,15-diazaporphyrinoids
5.1. Synthesis of partially β-reduced DAPs
Shinokubo et al. reported the synthesis of 5,15-diazachlorin 95M, 5,15-diazaisobacteriochlorin 96, and 5,15-diazabacteriochlorin 97, which were prepared by the reagent-controlled chemo- and regio-selective reduction of the peripheral β-CC double bonds of the corresponding DAPs 3M (M = Ni, H2) (Scheme 51).55 When 3Ni was treated with NaBH4 in the presence of Pd/C in CH2Cl2/MeOH, 96 was isolated in 79% yield, along with a trace amount of 95Ni. In the absence of Pd/C, the yield of 96 decreased significantly, while that of 95Ni increased. The reduction of 3Ni with p-tosylhydrazide (TsNHNH2) under basic conditions produced 95Ni albeit in a low yield (7%). As described in section 2.5, direct addition of organolithium reagents to MDAP 3Ni resulted in the formation of 3-R-5,15-diazachlorins 35 (R = alkyl, Ph) in moderate yields (Scheme 24).43 The reduction of free base 3H2 with TsNHNH2 in the presence of Na2CO3 in pyridine at 100 °C afforded 95H2 and 97 in 3% and 86% yields, respectively.66 The in vitro and in vivo photodynamic activity of 95H2 and 97 was investigated.
 Scheme 51  Synthesis of 5,15-diazachlorin 95M, 5,15-diazaisobacteriochlorin 96, and 5,15-diazabacteriochlorin 97. 
Shinokubo et al. reported a Diels–Alder reaction of 5-MeDAP cation 92H2 with cyclopentadiene in chlorobenzene, which afforded bis-adduct 98 in 53% yield as a single isomer out of possible 28 isomers (Scheme 52).65 Under the same conditions, neutral DAP 3H2 did not undergo the Diels–Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene. The large difference in reactivity between 92H2 and 3H2 was attributed to their different LUMO energies; the LUMO level of 92H2 matches the HOMO level of cyclopentadiene well.
 Scheme 52  Synthesis of 98via Diels–Alder reaction of 92H2. 
5.2. Synthesis of fully β-methylated DAPs
Scheffold et al. reported the synthesis of cationic cobalt(III), nickel(II), and palladium(II) complexes of fully β-methylated 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octahydro-5,15-diazaporphyrin (OHDAP) 99M (M = Co, Ni, Pd), which were obtained by metal-templated cyclization of the fully β-methylated 2,3,7,8-tetrahydrodipyrrin 1,9-diimide with the corresponding metal salts, followed by acid-promoted elimination of the RO− ion (R = H, Me) from the macrocyclic intermediates, as shown in Scheme 53.67–701H NMR spectroscopy revealed that the antiaromatic character of the [16] annulene circuit in 99M is extremely weak or nonexistent.
 Scheme 53  Synthesis of fully β-methylated OHDAPs 99M. 
6. Synthesis of other diazaporphyrinoids
In this section, the syntheses of skeletal isomers of DAP with 18π-electron circuits are described. Bohme and Breitmaier reported the synthesis of 2,3-diazaporphyrins 100 containing two nitrogen atoms at adjacent β-pyrrolic positions; acid-promoted [3 + 1] condensation between tripyrrane α,α′-diesters and 4H-1,2,4-triazol-3,5-dicarbaldehyde, followed by oxidation of the resulting adducts with DDQ afforded 100 in 12–15% yields (Scheme 54).71 The 1H NMR spectra of 100 reflected the diatropic ring-current effects of the 18π-electron systems.
 Scheme 54  Synthesis of 2,3-diazaporphyrins 100. 
Shinokubo et al. reported the first examples of meso-diazacorrphycene (Scheme 55).72 The chlorination of a covalently linked bis(dipyrrin)–nickel(II) complex with excess CuCl2, followed by acidolysis gave free base 101H2, which was then metallated with Pd(OAc)2 or Cu(OAc)2. Treatment of the resulting metal complexes 101M (M = Pd, Cu) with hydrazine hydrate afforded the corresponding metal complexes of meso-diazacorrphycenes 102M in moderate yields. NMR spectroscopy revealed the aromatic nature of 102Pd.
 Scheme 55  Synthesis of meso-diazacorrphycenes 102M. 
Ng et al. reported the first examples of 1,10-phenanthroline-embedded diazaporphyrinoid (Scheme 56).73 The metal-templated nucleophilic substitution of 1,9-dibromo-5-phenyldipyrrin with 2,9-diarylamino-1,10-phenanthroline in the presence of Ni(OAc)2 and K2CO3 in DMF gave phenanthrodiazaporphyrin 103Ni in 37% yield. Unfortunately, this methodology cannot be applied to prepare other metal complexes from ZnII, CuI, AgI, CoII, and FeIII salts. However, the Buchwald–Hartwig amination was applicable to the synthesis of free base 103H2 from the same substrates using Pd(dppf)Cl2 as the catalyst and tBuOK as the base. Complexation of 103H2 with Ni(OAc)2 and Zn(OAc)2/diisopropylethylamine in DMF, followed by an anion-exchange reaction with KPF6 afforded the corresponding metal complexes 103M (M = Ni, Zn).
 Scheme 56  Synthesis of phenanthrodiazaporphyrins 103M. 
7. Synthesis of 5-aza-15-oxa- and 5-aza-15-thia-porphyrinoids
7.1. Synthesis of 5-aza-15-oxaporphyrinoids
Our group reported the first examples of 5,10,20-triaryl-5-aza-15-oxaporphyrinoid (RAOP) as zinc(II) complexes.74 Heating a DMF solution of a bis(dipyrrin)-zinc(II) complex bearing two different ligands in the presence of K2CO3 at 110 °C afforded the zinc(II) complex of 10-aryl-1,19-dichloro-5,15-dimesityl-10-azabiladiene-ac104 quantitatively (Scheme 57). The ring-closure reaction of 104 with 4-methoxybenzaldoxime/NaH afforded RAOP 105 in the neutral 20π-electron form. The oxidation of 105 with AgPF6 produced 19π-electron radical cation 106 or 18π-electron dication 107 depending on the oxidant content used; however, it was difficult to isolate 106 and 107 with high purity because they slowly decomposed in solution under atmospheric conditions. The paratropic and diatropic ring-current effects on the β-pyrrolic protons of 105 and 107, respectively, are slightly smaller than those observed for the related zinc(II) complexes of R2DAP.
 Scheme 57  Synthesis of RAOPs 105, 106, and 107. 
7.2. Synthesis of 5-aza-15-thiaporphyrinoids
Shinokubo et al. reported the first example of 5-benzyl-5-aza-15-thiaporphyrinoid (RATP; R = benzyl). Treatment of 1,19-dibromo-5,15-dimesityl-10-benzyl-10-azabiladiene-ac108 with sodium sulfide (Na2S) in DMF at 65 °C afforded the free base of RATP 109 in 40% yield (Scheme 58).75 NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that 109 had a weak but non-negligible antiaromatic character derived from the 20π-electron circuit. The chemoselective oxidation of 109 with excess mCPBA furnished RATP S,S-dioxide 110, which showed a nonaromatic character because of the lone pair loss on the sulfur atom.
 Scheme 58  Synthesis of RATP 109 and S,S-dioxide 110. 
8. Synthesis of 5,15-dioxa- and 5,15-dithia-porphyrinoids
Shimizu et al. reported the first example of 5,15-dioxaporphyrinoid (5,15-dioxa-5,15-porphodimethene; DOP) 111, which was synthesized by the reaction of bis(1,9-dibromo-5-aryldipyrrin)–nickel(II) complexes with benzaldoxime in the presence of NaH (Scheme 59).76 The intramolecular ether-forming reaction of the hydroxy-substituted intermediate proceeds in a one-pot manner. The 1H NMR spectrum of 111 exhibited a paratropic ring-current effect on its β-pyrrolic protons, indicative of the antiaromatic character of the 20π-electron DOP ring. In a recent study by Shimizu et al., the spontaneous assembly of 111 (Ar = 2-thienyl) was studied at the liquid–solid interface to elucidate its polymorphism in a monolayer and the facile formation of the stacked layer.77
 Scheme 59  Synthesis and reactions of DOPs 111. 
Peripheral functionalization of 111 (Ar = mesityl) was achieved using two different methods. The oxidation of 111 with AgPF6 in CHCl3–MeCN resulted in the formation of β,β′-linked DOP dimer 112 in 33% yield, whereas the treatment of 111 with excess NOSbF6 in CH2Cl2–MeCN afforded 3,7,13,17-tetranitro-DOP 113 in 23% yield.78 NMR spectroscopy revealed a diminished paratropic ring-current effect of DOP; the antiaromaticity of 113 was much weaker than that of β-free DOP 111.
The first example of 5,15-dithiaporphyrin (DTP) was reported by Grigg et al. in 1972.79 They used the acid-promoted condensation of a dipyrrolyl sulfide diacid with a dipyrrolyl sulfide dialdehyde to synthesize β-alkylated DTP free base 114H2 (Scheme 60). The complexation of 114H2 with M(OAc)2 afforded the corresponding metal complexes 114M in good yields.
 Scheme 60  Synthesis of DTPs 114M. 
Shinokubo et al. reported the synthesis of β-unsubstituted, 10,20-dimesityl-DTPs via two routes.80,81 One route is the metal-templated annulation of the zinc(II)–bis(1,9-dichlorodipyrrin) complex with Na2S·H2O, and the other is the direct sulfurization of a 1,9-dibromodipyrrin free base with the same sulfur source in DMF. Both of these reactions afforded the free base of 10,20-dimesityl-DTP 115H2 in 53–64% yields (Scheme 61). Metal insertion into the core of 115H2 with M(OAc)2 (M = Cu, Zn, Ni, Pd, Pt) furnished the corresponding metal complexes 115M. Refluxing of a toluene solution of 115M caused desulfurization to give the corresponding metal complexes of 10-thiacorroles.
 Scheme 61  Synthesis of DTPs 115M. 
The treatment of 115H2 with 6 equiv. of mCPBA in CH2Cl2 afforded 5,5,15,15-tetraoxo-DTP 116H2 in 72% yield (Scheme 62).82 Metalation of 116H2 with M(OAc)2 (M = Zn, Ni) in CH2Cl2–MeOH provided the corresponding metal complexes 116M coordinated with two axial MeOH ligands in 85–95% yields. Heating a solid of 116Ni at 35 °C under high vacuum for 1 h afforded the four-coordinate diamagnetic nickel(II) complex 117, whereas the addition of pyridine to 116Ni yielded the six-coordinate paramagnetic nickel(II) complex 118. NMR spectroscopy revealed that 116M, 117, and 118 were nonaromatic owing to the interrupted π-conjugation. These SO2-linked macrocycles have gable structures, in which the two dipyrrin units were significantly bent at the two sulfur atoms.

9. Conclusions
Recently, various diazaporphyrins and their chalcogen derivatives have been synthesized. Furthermore, several compounds have been investigated for application in organic solar cells, organic semiconductors, PDT, metal-catalyzed bond-forming reactions, and electrochromic materials, highlighting the potential of these compounds in materials science, medical applications, and organic synthesis. Despite the potential applications of partially meso-modified heteroporphyrins, there is a limited number of examples available, and the elucidation of their structure–property relationships remains a significant challenge. We hope that the physical properties and reactivity of diazaporphyrins and related heteroatom-embedded porphyrins will attract chemists in various fields, resulting in further development of useful synthetic methods for these macrocycles in the near future.
