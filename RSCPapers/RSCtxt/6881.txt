, Accepted 16th February 2016First published on 3rd March 2016AbstractInverted planar perovskite (PVSK) solar cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVSK/PC61BM/Al have emerged as a new generation solar cell owing to their advantages of high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low processing temperature and potential low cost. In this paper, the polar solvent treatment effect of the PEDOT:PSS anode interlayer on PVSK solar cell performance was investigated. The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film was found to increase by washing with polar solvents, including H2O, ethanol (EtOH), and a mixture solvent of ethanol and H2O (EtOH:H2O = 8:2 v/v), which was attributed to the removal of the PSS component from the PEDOT:PSS film, leading to a PEDOT-rich surface. However, the PCE of perovskite solar cells decreased from 9.39% for the pristine PEDOT:PSS film based device to 4.21%, 8.35%, 7.13% for the H2O-, EtOH- and EtOH:H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS film based devices, respectively, suggesting that the high conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film does not ensure a high device performance of the inverted PVSK solar cells. UV-Vis absorption spectra, AFM surface morphology and SEM images of the PVSK films deposited on different PEDOT:PSS surfaces were studied, and the results showed that PEDOT-rich surface is not favorable for the crystal growth of PVSK layer, and consequently leads to poor device performances. This conclusion was further supported by the improved device performance of PVSK solar cells based on a PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa anode buffer layer, where an additional poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) layer was deposited on the PEOT:PSS surface.
1. Introduction
Organo-lead-halide perovskite (PVSK) materials have recently attracted tremendous attention in photovoltaic applications due to their intensive solar light absorption ability, low non-radiative carrier recombination rates, and ease of device fabrication.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSK solar cells has been boosted from 3.8%2 to more than 20%3 in the past few years. Historically, PVSK solar cells derived from mesoporous dye-sensitized solar cells,4 however, various types of PVSK solar cells with different device structures have been developed up to now, including a TiO2 based meso-structure,4 TiO2 based planar structure5 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based inverted planar structure.6–9 In comparison with the conventional mesoporous type perovskite solar cells, the PEDOT:PSS based inverted planar perovskite solar cells (IP-PVSK) have advantages of ease of fabrication, low processing temperature and good compatibility with roll to roll processing. To date, high power conversion efficiency of 18% has been achieved in IP-PVSK solar cells.10
In organic/polymer solar cells, the influence of the solvent treatment on PEDOT:PSS films on the photovoltaic performance have been widely investigated. Results showed that conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films could be enhanced by washing with polar solvents, such as H2O, ethanol etc., and such solvent treated PEDOT:PSS film could serve as transparent electrode in organic/polymer solar cells.11–13 For PVSK solar cells, it has been demonstrated that the composition and property of the underlying layer plays an important role in influencing the crystal growth of the perovskite film, and consequently limiting the PVSK solar cell performance.14,15 Very recently, Ouyang et al. demonstrated that the electronic properties of the PEDOT:PSS layer was greatly influenced by the deposition of the perovskite precursor solution and consequently effected the device performance of the perovskite solar cells.9 However, the influence of solvent treatment of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the PVSK solar cell performance has not been reported yet.
Aiming to understanding the solvent treatment effect of PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer on solar cell performance, PVSK solar cells based on solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films were fabricated and tested in this paper. The conductivity, optical property, and surface morphology of the solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films, as well as the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite films deposited on these solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films were investigated carefully. Results showed that the PSS-rich surface is helpful to achieve high performance PVSK solar cells, whereas solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films, which have a PEDOT-rich surface, is not favorable for the crystal growth of perovskite film, and leading to poorer device performance. The current work provides an important guideline for the development of high performance IP-PVSK solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and preparation
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS Clevios PVP AI 4083) was purchased from Heraeus Precious Metals GmbH & Co. KG. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was purchased from Solenne B.V. Poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa, Mn = 70000 g mol−1) was purchased from Acros Organics. PbCl2 (99%), CH3NH2 (32 wt% in absolute ethanol), HI (30% in water) were purchased from Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd. and used as received. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized according to the literature.16
2.2 PEDOT:PSS films preparation and characterization
The PEDOT:PSS films for UV-Vis absorption, AFM morphology, and conductivity measurement were prepared by spin-coating the Clevios 4083 solution on quartz glass. These films were baked at 124 °C for 30 min inside the glove box. After that, 100 μL solvent (H2O, ethanol, or ethanol–H2O mixture (8:2, v/v)) was dropped onto the dried PEODT:PSS film and then spin-casting at 3000 rpm for 60 s in air. These solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films were further dried at 140 °C for 5 min in the ambient before measurement. To make sure that all these solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films have similar layer thickness, the layer thickness of the initial PEDOT:PSS films for solvent treatment were adjusted by changing the spin speed until similar final layer thickness of ∼35 nm was achieved after solvent treatment (see more details in ESI†). As for the films for the conductivity measurement, much thicker PEDOT:PSS films (around 120 nm) were prepared to provide a better measurement accuracy.
The layer thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films was measured using an AlphaStep profilometer (Veeco, Dektak 150). Conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film (ρ) was calculated according to the following formulation: ρ = Rs × d, where Rs and d represent the sheet resistance and the thickness of measured film, respectively. Rs was measured by a four-point probe method with a Keithley Instruments Model 4200-SCS. To minimize the effect of the contact resistance between the PEDOT:PSS film and the probe, 200 nm thick aluminum layer was thermal deposited on the PEDOT:PSS surface as top electrode. The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Lambda 750 UV/vis/NIR spectro-photometer (PerkinElmer). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were recorded by VEECO Dimension 3100. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using an HITACHI S4800 scanning electron microscope. XPS experiments were carried out in a Kratos AXIS UltraDLD ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface analysis system, consisting of a multiport carousel chamber, a deposition chamber, and an analysis chamber. Base pressures in the three chambers are better than 5 × 10−10, 5 × 10−10, and 3 × 10−10 Torr, respectively. A monochromatic aluminum Kα source (1486.6 eV) was used in the XPS measurements to study the interfacial chemical states. All measurements were performed at room temperature. The photo-electrons were collected by a hemispherical analyzer with a total instrumental energy resolution of 0.5 eV for the XPS measurements. The contact angle between DMF, H2O or CH2I2 on various PEDOT:PSS surface was measured by an contact angle meter Model SL150 (USA KINO Industry). 30 seconds delay was performed to stabilize the contact between the solvent and PEDOT:PSS film, and a circling fitting mode was used to fit the contact angle.
2.3 Solar cell fabrication and testing
Patterned ITO glass substrates were subsequently cleaned by ultrasonic in surfactant aqueous solution, deionized water, acetone twice, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each. After nitrogen blow drying, the substrates were explored in UV/ozone for 30 min. A thin PEDOT:PSS film (∼35 nm) was deposited according to the method described in Section 2.2. For the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) layer, a precursor solution of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 (mol/mol = 3/1) in anhydrous DMF (0.6 M) was spin-coated onto the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS layer at 6000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 95 °C for 70 min inside the glove box. Note that concentration of PVSK precursor solution was optimized in our lab, which leads to a thinner PVSK film than that reported in the literature (vide infra). After that, a solution of PC61BM in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin-casted onto the perovskite film at 1000 rpm for 60 s to form a 60 nm thin film. Finally, a 100 nm Al layer was deposited under 1 × 10−4 Pa via thermal evaporation through a mask to ensure an effective area of 16 mm2 or 9 mm2 of the devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement was carried out inside the glove box with a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) generated by white light from halogen tungsten lamp, filtered by a UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight blue filter.17 External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were measured under simulated one sun operation conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser (Changchun New Industries, MGL-III-532). Light from a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp (Osram 64642) was used as probe light and modulated with a mechanical chopper before passing the monochromator (Zolix, Omni-λ300) to select the wavelength. The response was recorded as the voltage by an I–V converter (QE-IV Convertor, Suzhou D&R Instruments), using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR 830). A calibrated Si cell was used as reference. The test device was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container during the EQE measurement.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Influence of solvent treatment on the conductivity and surface properties of PEDOT:PSS films
Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra and AFM surface morphology images of the pristine and solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films. As can be seen from Fig. 1a, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film showed two absorption bands peaking at 196 and 225 nm, which were attributed to the absorption of PSS component.11,12,18 Clearly, the absorption intensity of these peaks decreased for the solvent treated films. Note that all these films for UV-Vis absorption measurement have similar layer thickness (35 ± 5 nm). The decrease of absorption intensity was therefore not attributed to the decrease of the PEDOT:PSS layer thickness but to the decrease of PSS content in these films. The measured conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film increased from 22 mS cm−1 for the pristine film,19,20 to 1290, 1670 and 2110 mS cm−1 for the H2O, EtOH and EtOH:H2O treated films, respectively (see Fig. 1). In the meanwhile, AFM surface imaging (Fig. 1b–e) showed the roughness of the PEDOT:PSS films increased slightly from 1.09 nm for the pristine PEDOT:PSS film to 1.3–1.7 nm for the solvent treated ones, confirming that surface property of the PEDOT:PSS film changed by such solvent treatment. Such a conductivity improvement and surface morphology changes were also reported in the literatures, and was ascribed the removal of PSS component during the solvent processing.11,12,18
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis absorption spectra (a) and AFM surface topology images (b–e) of the pristine and solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films (35 ± 5 nm) deposited on quartz glass. For the AFM surface topology images, the high scale is 20 nm, and the scan area is 5 μm × 5 μm. The conductivity (σ) of thick PEDOT:PSS films (120 ± 13 nm) measured by a four-point probe method is also listed in the corresponding AFM image. 
To further confirm that PSS component was partially removed by solvent treatment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to determine the surface composition of the prepared PEDOT:PSS films. Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of the pristine and solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films. As can be seen here, all these PEDOT:PSS films showed two signed peak regions at 170–166 and 166–163 eV, which are corresponding to S(2p) of PSS and PEDOT moieties, respectively.21 The PEDOT:PSS ratio of the thin films, determined by the relative integral area of peaks at 163.5 eV and 167.5 eV, respectively, was increased from 0.09 for the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, to 0.28 for H2O-treated film, 0.16 for EtOH treated film, and 0.22 for EtOH:H2O-treated film, respectively, suggesting a more PEDOT-rich surface formed for these solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films. For comparison, PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa film, where an additional poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) layer was spun costed on the H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS surface was also fabricated and tested. Fig. S1 (in ESI†) shows the UV-Vis and XPS of this PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa film. As can be seen here, after deposition of an additional PSSNa layer, the absorption intensity at 196 and 225 nm increased greatly when compared to that of H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS film, suggesting that PSSNa was successfully deposited on PEDOT:PSS surface. In addition, only PSS component can be found in XPS spectrum (Fig. S1b†), unambiguously confirming that a PSS-rich surface formed on this PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface.

To further confirm the surface property change of these PEDOT:PSS films, the contact angles between the pristine and solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films with DMF, H2O or CH2I2 solvent were tested. Unfortunately, DMF and H2O were found to be able to penetrate into the PEDOT:PSS film, and it is not possible to get an equilibrium state for the contact angle measurement. This could be understood by the fact that PEDOT:PSS is highly dispersed in DMF and H2O. However, hydrophobic CH2I2 is able to form a stable droplet on the PEDOT:PSS surface, and the contact angels were measured to be 36.4° for the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, and 33.7°, 32.1°, 32.4°, and 41.0° for the H2O-, EtOH-, EtOH:H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa film surface (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The contact angle measurement results clearly showed that more hydrophobic surface formed after being treated with polar solvent, whereas hydrophilic surface formed after deposition of PSSNa. Together with the UV-Vis and XPS results, one can conclude that H2O, EtOH and EtOH–H2O treated PEDOT:PSS surface are PEDOT-rich surface owing to the removal of PSS by washing with solvents,11,12,18 whereas PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface is more hydrophilic for the high PSS content on the surface.
3.2 Perovskite thin film qualities on various PEDOT:PSS surface
Perovskite films were then deposited on the pristine and solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS surfaces by spin-coating the precursor solution and the following thermal annealing. For comparison, perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface was also prepared and tested. The surface morphology of these films were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Fig. 3 shows the top-view SEM, cross-section SEM and AFM surface topology images of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3a1, the perovskite film deposited on the pristine PEDOT:PSS showed reasonable condensed crystalline film with few small pin holes. AFM image (Fig. 3a3) confirmed a surface roughness of 10.7 nm for this film. The PVSK layer thickness was found to decrease slightly (less than 10%) for those PVSK films deposited on solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS film (see cross sectional SEM images). In addition, much rougher surface was found for those PVSK film deposited on the solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films (AFM images in Fig. 3b3–d3), among which the H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS film based PVSK film showed a roughest surface (MRS = 16.5 nm) and large pin holes (Fig. 3b). Slightly increased surface roughness was found for PVSK films deposited on EtOH and EtOH:H2O mixture treated PEDOT:PSS film (RMS = 12.2 and 12.8 nm, respectively), and reasonable condense PVSK film formed, suggesting that EtOH containing solvent treated PEDOT:PSS surface has less effect on the crystallinity of the PVSK films than H2O-only solvent. In contrast, PVSK film deposited on PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface showed more homogeneous film with larger and more condensed crystal domains (Fig. 3e1 and e2), suggesting a better perovskite thin film morphology was obtained on the PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface.
 Fig. 3  Top-view SEM (a1–e1), cross-sectional SEM images (a2–e2) and AFM surface topology images (a3–e3) of the perovskite layer based on pristine (a); H2O treated (b); EtOH treated (c); EtOH + H2O (8:2, v/v, d) treated (d); additional PSSNa on H2O treated PEDOT:PSS films. 
UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4a) and X-ray diffraction (Fig. 4b) were applied to further study the quality of the perovskite films. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, PVSK film on the pristine PEDOT:PSS showed a broad absorption band over 300–800 nm, which is similar to that reported in the literatures.22 The absorption intensity (over 300–500 nm) decreased for the PVSK film deposited on the solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films. Since the layer thicknesses of these PVSK films are all around 170 nm (Fig. 3a2–d2), such an absorption decrease was attributed to the decrease of the thin film quality of PVSK films, rather than to the PVSK layer thickness. The PVSK crystal quality was further checked with XRD measurements. Fig. 4b shows the XRD patterns of the PVSK films deposited on various PEDOT:PSS surface. As can be seen here, all these films showed typical diffraction peaks of PVSK film at 2θ of 14.1°, 28.4°, 43.1°, 58.7°, respectively.23,24 However, the intensity of the diffraction peak decreased for perovskite film deposited on solvent treated PEDOT:PSS film, demonstrating a decrease of crystalline property of the perovskite films, which is in good accordance with the SEM and AFM results.
 Fig. 4  (a): UV-Vis absorption spectra; (b): X-ray diffraction patterns of perovskite layers based on pristine, H2O-, EtOH-, EtOH:H2O mixture- (8:2, v/v) treated PEDOT:PSS films, and on PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface. 
Not surprisingly, higher UV-Vis absorption intensity over 300–400 nm (Fig. 4a) and more intensive XRD diffraction peaks (Fig. 4b) were found for the PVSK film deposited on PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa surface, confirming that improved PVSK thin film quality was obtained on PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa film. Knowing that perovskite film defects can be passivated by the amine group25 or other hetero atoms26 owing to the complexation ability of hetero atom with Pd cation, it is reasonable to speculate that PSS molecules are dispersed in the PVSK film when dropping the PVSK precursor solution onto the PEDOT:PSS surface. The oxygen anions of the sulfonic groups of PSS would passivate the boundary defect of the perovskite film through a Pd–O bond during the crystal growth of perovskite film, and consequently improve PVSK film quality. For those solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS film, since PSS moiety was partially removed by solvent-treatment, such a PSS passivation effect was limited, and consequently led to poor PVSK thin film quality. However, more experiments are still needed to fully confirm the interaction between PSS and PVSK film. Nevertheless, it is clear that PSS-rich surface is helpful in improving perovskite thin film quality, whereas PEDOT-rich surface is not favorable for the crystal growth of perovskite film and leads to poor thin film quality.
3.3 Performances of devices based on solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS layer
To further understand the influence of solvent treatment of the PEDOT:PSS film on PVSK solar cell performance, inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVSK/PC61BM/Al were fabricated and tested, where various solvent treated PEDOT:PSS layer was used as the hole transporting layer. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves and EQE spectra of these PVSK solar cells. The PV performance data are summarized in Table 1 and the statistics diagram of these devices are shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen here, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film based device gave an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 17.6 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.61 and an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.65%. The achieved PCE is slightly lower that reported in the literatures,8,16,27 but still reasonable for PVSK device with a PVSK layer thickness of 170 nm (Fig. 3, SEM cross section). Surprisingly, although the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film was improved by solvent treatment, devices based on the such solvent treated PEDOT:PSS films gave also poorer device performance and worst performance reproducibility than the reference cell (Table 1 and Fig. 6). The decreased device performance for the H2O-treated PEDOT:PSS based device is mainly due to the low open-circuit voltage (VOC = 0.65 V, Table 1). Although the detailed reason for VOC decrease is not clear yet, the rougher PVSK surface that leading to worse surface coverage of PC61BM was supposed to be the main reason. Short circuit (JSC) and fill factor (FF), on the other hand, are found to be slightly decreased after the PEDOT:PSS surface treatment with H2O. Less negative effect was found for EtOH based solvents (Fig. 6 and Table 1, entry 3 and 4), which is in good accordance to less effect on the crystal thin film (SEM results, Fig. 3). EQE spectra showed that all these PVSK device have high photon-electron conversion efficiency over 350–750 nm. Slight EQE variation for different cells was found, which could be due to layer thickness difference for different devices. This result demonstrated that PVSK device performance was more direct related to the PVSK thin film quality rather than to the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer (hole transporting layer).

To further confirm that PSS is necessary to achieve high performance for PEDOT:PSS based inverted perovskite solar cells, devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa/PVSK/PC61BM/Al were fabricated and tested (entry 5 in Table 1). The J–V cure and EQE curve of this PEDOT:PSS/PSSNa based device are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. As can be seen here, although JSC (17.56 mA cm−2) and FF (0.62) do not improved too much for this PSSNa layer associated device, the device performance was greatly improved owing to an improvement of VOC to 0.93 V, yielding an overall PCE of 10.27%, which is even higher than that of the reference cell (entry 1, Table 1). With that, one can conclude that PSS-rich surface is helpful in achieving high quality perovskite thin film, and the consequence device performance. However, for those solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS film, the PEDOT-rich surface leads to poorer perovskite thin film quality, and lower device performance was obtained for these solvent-treated PEDOT:PSS film, although conductivity of these films is improved by solvent treatment.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically studied the influence of solvent treatment on the properties of the PEDOT:PSS films, the subsequent perovskite thin films as well as the PVSK solar cell performance. UV-Vis absorption and XPS analysis confirmed that PSS component was partially removed by washing with H2O, EtOH or EtOH:H2O (8:2, v/v), leading to a PEDOT-rich surface with an enhanced conductivity. UV-Vis absorption spectra and XRD diffraction patterns analyses confirmed that perovskite film deposited on PSS-rich surface has better crystal quality, while decreased thin film quality was found for those perovskite film deposited on solvent treated PEDOT:PSS surface. Although the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films was improved by solvent treatment, perovskite solar cell performance decreased in those solvent treated PEDOT:PSS film based device, demonstrating that PVSK solar cell performance is more related to the quality of PVSK film rather than the conductivity of the hole transporting layer. Interestingly, an additional PSSNa layer could improve device performance, suggesting that making a PSS-rich surface would be a feasible way to improve the performance of polymer buffer layer based PVSK solar cells.
