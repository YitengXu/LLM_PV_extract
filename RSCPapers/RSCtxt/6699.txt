    , Accepted 27th March 2020First published on 30th March 2020AbstractCarbon-based hole transport layer-free carbon mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (MPSCs) are considered to be cell architectures with high potential for commercialization, due to their enhanced stability. In the standard process for large area and module fabrication, mesoporous layers of TiO2, ZrO2 and carbon are screen printed onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated with a compact TiO2 (cTiO2) layer. In this work, we sequentially replaced screen printing by slot die coating one by one for all layers until we achieved a fully slot die coated solar cell. Slot die coating is a manufacturing technique with a much higher throughput than screen printing. We demonstrate that slot die coated layers need not be sintered separately as opposed to the screen printed layers, but can rather be co-fired for increased manufacturing speed and efficacy. We characterize the inks, coating process, morphology and performance of these solar cells. The cells show efficiencies comparable to those of the screen printed control devices. The cells also show extraordinarily high shelf life stability. We also demonstrate that ellipsometry can be used as an efficient (in-situ) tool to characterize the stack structure of the cells.
Introduction
Rapid improvement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in just a few years triggered tremendous research and development efforts in this photovoltaic technology domain.1–9 Presently, most of the research is focused on exploring materials and device architectures leading to efficiency milestones and device stability. The record perovskite power conversion efficiency to date (NREL efficiency chart from February 18, 2020) lies at 25.2% with a so-called planar structure.1
The success of commercializing perovskite solar cells relies on key advantages to compete with established photovoltaic technologies. For example, PSCs can be processed from solution, resulting in low production cost and smaller capital expenditure. Historically, perovskites were first used as dye substitutes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), wherein the perovskite crystals grew in the mesoporous scaffold. Based on this device architecture, the carbon-based hole transport layer-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cell (MPSC) was developed. While this cell architecture cannot compete with planar structures in terms of efficiency, excellent device stability was demonstrated for fully screen printed devices.10–13 For this device geometry, the highest efficiency has been achieved with a mesoporous metal oxide TiO2/Al2O3/NiO layered framework with a carbon counter electrode and the triple cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.4MA0.6)0.95PbI0.8Br0.2. Devices were tested on an area of 0.129 cm2 and showed a record efficiency of 17.02%.14
The most followed route for up-scaling MPSCs is via screen printing, sometimes including a spray coating process for the cTiO2 layer.12,15 The infiltration of the methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) ink has been demonstrated using inkjet printing and slot die coating by Hashmi et al. and Cotella et al., respectively.12,16 Due to difficulties in controlling large area film formation, perovskite crystallization and high-quality interfaces, the maximum efficiencies drop dramatically with increasing device area, posing huge challenges to the research community. At the solar module level, poor module design causes a drop in efficiency at larger dimensions.17,18
Fully screen printed MPSCs have been manufactured by NTU Singapore, employing manual infiltration of the perovskite precursor ink (efficiencies of their cells reached maximum values of 10.74% on an active area of 70 cm2),15 and Swansea University with screen printed modules showing efficiencies of 6.6%.19 Apart from research institutions, a number of start-up companies, but also well-established electronic companies work on the development of perovskite solar cell modules.20 Attempts to scale-up other perovskite device architectures range from ink jet printing to slot die coating of individual layers.12,15,21,22
Not reported in the literature though is a holistic solution for PSC manufacturing, with the requirement to build the complete perovskite solar cell at industrially relevant speeds, preferentially with one and the same technique. While screen printing is comparatively fast and scalable, in terms of processing speed it cannot compete with printing and coating techniques such as gravure printing, flexo printing or slot die coating.23
Nevertheless, slot die coating has not surfaced in the literature as a promising coating technique for MPSCs. But, if successfully implemented, all the issues mentioned above can be addressed. Slot die coating is fully compatible with industry standards.24 With coating speeds ranging from less than 1 mm min−1 to more than 600 m min−1, it has been very successfully used to manufacture organic solar cells25 and has been used to apply single perovskite layers.26
Slot die coating is a non-contact large area processing method for the deposition of homogeneous, defect-free wet films with high cross-directional uniformity.27 Slot die coating is a pre-metered technique, with the major benefit that the wet film thickness can be preset and precisely calculated from the flow rate of the fluid and the coating speed. Finally, slot die coating is roll-to-roll compatible and stripe module design friendly. This makes slot die coating an a priori useful tool for printed electronics applications.28
Slot die coating covers inks within a wide viscosity window ranging from 1 mPa s to 10000 mPa s29 and final dry thicknesses from a few nanometers to tens of microns can be reached. Of major concern though is the determination of the operation limits which are needed to set the parameters of coating speed, flow rate and coating gap. Even though a couple of theories describe the operation limits,30 the mechanism behind coating instabilities is poorly understood. A number of competing forces, such as capillary, viscous, inertial and elastic forces, act on the coating bead.31,32 An operation near the operation limits can trigger coating defects.24,33
We here apply the visco-capillary model that only considers the fluid meniscus at the downstream lip of the slot die and is valid when air entrainment does not occur (Fig. 1). Useful in this context is the introduction of the capillary number Ca, which expresses the coating speed v in a dimensionless form including viscosity η and surface tension σ of the liquid: (1)Above a critical pressure in the coating bead, the film thickness is too low to form a stable wet film. This is the so-called low flow limit. Ruschak developed a theoretical model that defined a critical capillary number above which the flow field of the coating bead between the die and the substrate becomes unstable.34 (2)where G is the ratio of the height of the gap between the substrate and lip hG and the thickness of the wet film hwet: (3)Thus, increasing G will lead to unstable coating for larger capillary numbers.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the process of slot die coating. 
In this paper we describe the complete fabrication process of MPSC modules with competitive efficiencies using only slot die coating. The inks for slot die coating are based on pastes developed for screen printing. The different fluid dynamic requirements for the ink make composition adaption necessary, which will alter the final film properties, not to mention differences in wetting, drying and interface formation behavior. Manufacturing of all individual layers, and the influence of inks and solvents will be detailed below, and in the ESI.†
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows a schematic cross section of the monolithic perovskite solar cell structure. For module manufacturing, small stripes need to be serially connected, which can be realized by printing individual lines with an offset, or by scribing the lines P1, P2 and P3 in a large area coating. Slot die coating allows for large area coating, as well as for “module friendly” stripe coating. The second concept is implemented in our module fabrication process, but only for demonstration purposes. A diagram of the final manufacturing process is shown in Fig. 2b. To manufacture efficient modules, the line accuracy and width between the stripes would need to be further optimized. Consequently, we do not report module efficiencies here, but rather values for 0.64 cm2 areas on samples cut from the slot die coated substrates (Fig. 2c).

The connections can be realized by adapting the stripe width and offset of the corresponding layers or by laser scribing. (b) Schematics of the processing steps of a fully slot die coated MPSC cell using stripe coating. Compact titania (cTiO2), mesoporous titania (mTiO2), mesoporous zirconia (mZrO2) and carbon layers are sequentially slot die coated. In between the individual coating steps, the samples are dried as specified and only after the mesoporous multilayer film was completed was the entire stack sintered all together (co-firing). In the last step the solar cell is completed by automatic infiltration of the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution. (c) Making of small area MPSC solar cells for characterization from stripe coated samples: glass pieces of 25 mm × 20 mm size are cut from the substrates, and an active cell area of 16 mm × 12 mm is then defined by laser scribing. 
In the first step, inks for all individual layers were developed for slot die coating and the process was optimized for the required layer thicknesses. Images of the inks, substrates coated with stripes of cTiO2, mTiO2, mZrO2 and carbon, along with two videos demonstrating large area coating by slot die coating are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† In the second step, screen printed layers were replaced individually by slot die coated layers, starting from the bottom. Only when the devices attained an efficiency comparable to that of the reference cell was the next slot die coated layer used. Generally, all individual layers were dried and sintered after deposition. A further highlight of this work is the finding that slot die coating allowed the co-firing of the full solar cell stack before perovskite infiltration, presenting the possibility of continuously producing MPSCs with least down time possible. Differently, to reach the best efficiencies, screen printed cells required sintering after each deposition step.
To fabricate the reference device, we followed a recipe based on a fully screen-printed stack.35 The optimal thickness of the stack has been reported by many research groups.12,15
Ink formulation and layer coating

Compact TiO2. 
The compact titania layer acts as a blocking layer in the MPSC structure and thus requires a homogeneous conformal coating, free of defects and pinholes. A specific challenge is the roughness of the FTO substrate, as well as crack formation during drying or due to stress.
The titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetate) precursor (TAA) was used as the basis for ink development.36 In the following section, we exemplarily describe the strategies that led to the formation of a uniform cTiO2 coating. Ink formulation and parameter settings of the slot die coater depend on each other and are matched in several iteration steps. In the first attempt, the TAA precursor ink was slot die coated as supplied onto a FTO glass substrate. Here, a stable meniscus formed between the bead and the substrate, which is a mandatory prerequisite for successful coating. In our case, even though a stable meniscus was formed, the wet and dry films were very inhomogeneous. Too fast drying of the wet film was identified as the cause, and the precursor solution was thus diluted with high boiling point (BP) solvents like ethylene glycol (BP: 196 °C), tetralin (BP: 206 °C), and xylene (BP: 144 °C). In addition, to reach the desired thickness of 50 nm, a series of concentrations and flow rates were tested. While the first trials with all high boiling point inks had yielded immediately a homogeneous wet film, upon drying, the film started to de-wet, and showed bad pinning and uneven drying. The result of such a coating with a TiO2 (tetralin) (1:10) solution is shown in Fig. 3a. Applying the solution for the second time (wet on wet coating) improved substrate pinning (Fig. 3b). The strategy of using solvent mixtures (high and low BP) was adopted to improve thin film formation and counter the de-wetting of the film. Isopropanol alcohol (iPrOH) acted as a low boiling point solvent and tetralin as a high boiling point solvent. iPrOH has a BP of 82.5 °C and thus can facilitate uniform drying of the coated wet film. The new titania ink contains tetralin:iPrOH (1:1 vol) + TAA (1:10). The modified ink led to a homogeneous wet film, but even after double coating the dried film was very inhomogeneous (Fig. 3c). While adding a low BP co-solvent did alleviate de-wetting problems of the wet film, the addition of an even faster evaporating alcohol like ethanol (EtOH) was used to improve the homogeneity of the film after drying. With the introduction of a fast evaporating solvent into the ink mixture and optimizing the ratio of the solvents, a further improvement of the homogeneity of the dried film was possible (Fig. 3d). A mixture of the three solvents tetralin:iPrOH:EtOH (TIE) in a 1:1:1 mixture by volume, added with a volume fraction of 20:1 to the TAA precursor solution showed good wet as well as dry film formation (Fig. 3e). A line profile through the stripe showed a lower thickness at the edges than at the center due to poor leveling of the thin film. To improve the thin film profile we introduced a fluoro-surfactant into the solvent mixture. Both wet and dry films were homogeneous with levelled edge profiles as shown in Fig. 3f.

Besides improved pinning, double coating of wet on wet films proved to fill pinholes present in the first layer.
The compositions and printing parameters of the final TiO2 inks that yielded satisfactory coatings are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. After coating, the films were dried at 70 °C for 10 min at 200 °C for 1 h and then heated to 500 °C on a hot plate (under air) to form a compact TiO2 film.

Relevant for device fabrication is the final thickness after firing. The thickness has been determined via profilometry performed using films coated on glass and was found to be 47 nm after double coating.

Fig. 4a shows the critical capillary number describing bead stability during coating as a function of film thickness following eqn (3). For higher capillary numbers the coating bead became unstable. Due to the low film thickness of cTiO2, slot die coating at that speed is close to the critical value, and may not allow increasing the coating speed further. Besides the criteria decisive for ink development, substrate wettability can also be quantified with the help of wetting envelopes.

Fig. 4b shows the wetting envelope of FTO and the surface energies of EtOH, iPrOH, terpineol and tetralin (the solvents utilized during ink development). The surface tensions of the solvents lie well within the wetting envelope for FTO, which at least from a surface energy point of view guarantees proper wetting of the substrate with the ink.


Mesoporous TiO2. 
The mTiO2 layer plays a crucial role in the MPSC, and it serves as a selective contact for electron extraction and as a scaffold for the perovskite crystals. 25 nm was identified as the optimal diameter for the TiO2 nanoparticles.37 The screen printing paste Ti-nanoxide T165/SP used as a base ink has a very high viscosity requiring the dilution of the paste to adapt it for the slot die coating process. The paste was diluted first with the base solvent terpineol. Similar to cTiO2, this led to very slow drying and non-homogeneous film formation. To initiate fast drying as well as to keep the nanoparticle mesoporous ink suspension stable, only solvents from the alcohol group were added. Experiments were performed with iPrOH and EtOH. iPrOH led to very homogeneous wet as well as dry films. Ink composition and properties and processing conditions are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The low surface energy of the underlying cTiO2 makes wetting of the ink a more challenging task, while the coating bead is in the stable region and would allow for a higher coating speed (Fig. 4a). The deposited layers were then dried at 110 °C for 10 min and fired at 500 °C for 1 h on a hot plate.


Mesoporous ZrO2. 
The absence of a hole transport layer makes the introduction of a spacer layer between mTiO2 and carbon necessary to avoid short cuts in the cell. ZrO2 is frequently chosen for that purpose for its large band gap and the formation of large pores when processed from nanoparticle inks, which facilitates the infiltration with perovskites. Following the same strategy as for the development of the ink for the mTiO2 layer, the zirconia ink was developed (Table 1). The ink has a viscosity of 17.5 mPa s and a surface tension of 25.9 mN m−1. The desired thickness of 1000 nm was achieved using the ink with two times wet on wet coating with a speed of 0.9 m min−1 and a flow rate of 1.25 ml min−1 (Table 2). The wet film was then dried at 110 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions, and fired at 500 °C for 1 h on a hot plate.


Carbon back electrode. 
In the MPSC architecture, the carbon layer acts as a hole collector as well as an electrode. The required 12 μm film thickness after firing is still within the range of slot die coating. The screen printing paste was optimized with the addition of EtOH and iPrOH to reach good flowability and meniscus formation during slot die coating (Table 1). The ink was deposited with a speed of 0.2 m min−1 and a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1 and dried at 110 °C for 10 min. This procedure led to the formation of a homogeneous wet film, and a 10–12 μm thick film after firing (Table 2). We believe that due to the non-Newtonian behavior of the ink, the meniscus broke sometimes when coated at speeds in excess of 1m min−1 and sometimes it led to inhomogeneities in the wet film. The developed carbon ink has a surface tension of 23.4 mN m−1 as shown in Table 1.

Cell manufacturing, co-firing and infiltration
After optimizing the slot die coating parameters of individual layers of the device stack, solar cell devices were fabricated on FTO substrates. One set of fully slot die coated samples was prepared, where the completed stack was co-fired at 450 °C, skipping the individual firing steps after the deposition of each layer. For characterization, smaller cells were cut out from the substrates (Fig. 2c).
The metal oxide/carbon scaffold was infiltrated with MAPbI3 with a 5-ammonium valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) additive, which forms mixed-cation perovskite (5-AVAI)x(MA)1−xPbI3 crystals with lower defect concentration, better pore filling and a more complete contact with the TiO2 scaffold as compared to single cation MAPbI3.35 The complete cells were incubated by a humidity assisted thermal treatment.38
Characterization

X-ray scattering. 
To prove the full conversion of the perovskite precursor solution into the perovskite, and to exclude the decomposition of the perovskite into PbI2, XRD measurements were performed on the infiltrated samples. The spectrum is dominated by the diffraction peak of the TiO2 anatase at 2Θ = 25.3°. A zoom into the spectrum shows all characteristic perovskite peaks, while no peak at the position of PbI2 (2Θ = 12.5°) can be identified (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  X-ray diffraction patterns of the MSPC stack after MAPbI3 infiltration and annealing. The XRD spectrum is dominated by the (101) peak of TiO2 anatase at 2Θ = 25.3° (inset). A zoom into the peaks of lower intensity shows the characteristic peaks of the cubic phase of the perovskite crystal.50 No decomposition product of perovskites into PbI2 is present. PbI2 would have a characteristic peak at 2Θ = 12.5°. 


Cell morphology. 
Cross-sections of the samples were imaged via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fig. 6. Noticeable is a strong layering within the carbon layer, with large graphite flakes aligning parallel to the mZrO2 surface.39 Solid infiltration of the carbon layer with the perovskite seems important. A zoom into the metal oxide layers shows a very similar grain structure of nanoparticles about 100 nm in diameter for both mTiO2 and mZrO2, wherein the interface between the two materials can be hardly identified. The SEM images show uniform infiltration and crystallization of the mesoporous metal oxide structure, even though differences between non-infiltrated and infiltrated cells are hardly detectable (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). cTiO2 is too thin to be resolved in the SEM image, but a dark line follows the interface between mTiO2 and FTO. The interface is rather rough, originating from the granular structure of the FTO.40

The importance of the morphology of the cTiO2 hole blocking layer was pointed out. The cTiO2 coating must be defect free at the lowest thickness to avoid additional series resistance.41 For that reason an analysis of the FTO surface and the cTiO2 layer applied to FTO by slot die coating was performed by AFM and the results were compared to those of cTiO2 films deposited by other coating techniques (Table 3, AFM images Fig. 7). The roughness values of the cTiO2 films deposited by spray pyrolysis were closest to the values of the FTO substrate, while slot die coating is the most successful in smoothening the FTO surface. Here, a contour-chasing deposition technique would be more favorable, as long as the film is defect-free. XRD proved that independent of the coating technique similar cTiO2 crystals were formed (Fig. S3 in the ESI†).

AFM images of mTiO2, mZrO2 and carbon surfaces are shown in Fig. 8. The mTiO2 and mZrO2 surfaces look alike, and the similarity of the morphology of the two materials was already observed via SEM. Profiles of the scans show that slot die coating of mTiO2 and mZrO2 results in flat and smooth layers. Differently, the slot die coated carbon layer still shows a high surface roughness.

Analysis with ellipsometry. 
Spectrosopic ellipsometry allows obtaining layer parameters from non-destructive measurements on the sample manufactured under ambient conditions and would be compatible with an in-line assessment of the production quality. The optical parameters of the glass substrate were obtained after the removal of the FTO layer and was comparable to a BAK-1 glass. The FTO coating was modelled starting from the structure reported in ref. 42. This model includes two thin layers of SnO2 and SiO2 between the glass and the FTO layer. It was noted that the FTO layer had much less absorption in the near infrared compared to the values from the J.A.Woollam database. Adapting the corresponding Drude term by reducing the resistivity to 0.0004 Ω cm and increasing the scattering time to 7.5 fs led to a better fit and was in agreement with the fact that high conductivity FTO was selected for the PV devices. Further improvement of the model was achieved by accommodating a grading of the FTO layer, which hints to a top layer with reduced fluorine concentration. The final FTO substrate model consisted of the glass substrate, a 32 nm thick SnO2 layer followed by 25 nm of SiO2 and a total of 370 nm of FTO. Finally, a roughness of around 33 nm (Table 3) could be confirmed.
Upon depositing a layer of compact TiO2 on top of the FTO substrate, the roughness turns into an effective medium approximation (EMA) layer made up of the cTiO2 and FTO materials. As deposited, a cTiO2 thickness of 175 nm was measured, irrespective of the layer being modeled as a homogeneous oxide or a TiO2 layer with 40% porosity in the EMA according to Bruggeman,43Table 4 and Fig. 9.

The printed layer of mTiO2 on top of the cTiO2-FTO stack was added to the ellipsometer model, and a layer thickness of 800 nm with 15 nm roughness was fitted. The final layer of ZrO2 appeared inhomogeneous and measurements at different locations yielded a thickness variation of 570–800 nm. This thickness variation was most probably caused by the printing process itself.
In the sintered samples the layered structure changed strongly. For the first cTiO2 layer, a good fit is obtained for a thickness of only 32 nm with 15% void content, while the FTO layer with a fluorine-poor grading towards the top is confirmed. When the mTiO2 layer is added and sintered, a layer thickness of 500 nm with 50% void content is modeled. Finally, the ZrO2 layer is reasonably well fitted with a mere 175 nm ZrO2 thickness, again with a high void content of >50%. This value is inconsistent with the data obtained from SEM, and at the moment we have no satisfactory explanation for this.
Rather than sintering the device layer by layer after each printing pass, the entire stack was co-fired. The resulting layer thickness values have a tendency to be larger than the ones from individually sintered layers and imply a slightly higher void content (see Table 5). The ellipsometry layer model is based on a mixture of oxide and void according to the effective medium approximation to explain the lowering of the refractive index. While this model is inspired from a layer with porosity, the change of the refractive index can also be caused by a change in oxide content.

Photovoltaic properties. 
Photovoltaic parameters of the reference cell, the development cells and the fully slot die coated cells are shown in Table 6 and Fig. 10. The values are based on reverse scans. Typical J–V curves of forward and reverse scans of fully slot die coated cells are shown in Fig. 11. We show a device of the first generation with a lower efficiency. The devices showed hysteresis, which is also reflected in the different fill factors (FF). The reference cell (fully screen printed) reached an average efficiency of η = 12.3%, with Jsc = 23.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 66%.

 Fig. 11  
J–V curves with forward and reverse scans of a typical fully slot die coated solar cell measured 23 months after manufacturing (non-encapsulated and stored under ambient conditions). The solar cell is not hysteresis-free. 
When replacing the screen printed compact TiO2 layer with a slot die coated TiO2 layer (1 layer SC), a large drop in efficiency was observed. This is mainly due to the reduction of Jsc from Jsc = 23.7 mA cm−2 to Jsc = 19.1 mA cm−2. The explanation is rather straightforward: the slot die coated cTiO2 layer does not form a conformal thin coating on top of the FTO, but rather fills the valleys, and introduces a serial resistance. A minor drop in Voc may be due to the slight change in the chemical composition of the slot die coated TiO2.44,45
Interestingly, this negative effect was partially compensated when more metal oxide layers were applied by slot die coating (2 layers SC and 3 layers SC). Voc remained more or less constant, which indicates that the contact potential difference between hole and electron transport materials did not change and the ZrO2 insulation layer successfully prevented charge recombination. More difficult to explain is the simultaneous increase of Jsc and the decrease of the fill factor. Assuming a similar geometry of the samples, high reverse saturation current or high ideality can be excluded, as this would also affect Voc. Higher series resistance or lower shunt resistance would not increase Jsc. For a complete understanding of the process happening at the interfaces, a more detailed analysis of processes would be necessary, which is beyond the scope of this paper.
Moving to fully slot die coated devices, the trend from before was reversed: both Jsc and Voc decreased while the fill factor increased. Here the alignment of graphite flakes parallel to the substrate during slot die coating could be of disadvantage for current extraction. The fully slot die coated and co-fired samples showed the poorest performance, with efficiencies of η = 11.1%, but also the scatter in data is largest. Reasons for the poor performance may be found in the interfaces that get more diffuse during co-firing.
We also want to point out that comparing efficiency values of our cells to current state-of-the art values proved difficult not only due to the absence of a standard measurement protocol, the strong dependence of measured efficiency on cell area, and the detailed measurement routine,46 but also due to differences in cell manufacturing from one laboratory to another. This is also reflected in a large scatter in reported record efficiencies. Parameters of the best performing MPSCs were reported as Jsc = 23.40 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.08 V; FF = 72% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 17.02% on small areas (0.129 cm2), wherein the cells were manufactured by a combination of spray pyrolysis, screen printing and dipping.14 Differently, the champion cell reported by Hashmi et al. fabricated by similar means, but the infiltration of perovskites by ink jet printing remained below 10%.12
To evaluate the robustness of our measurement protocol, we followed different measurement routines for a number of selected cells (Table S1 in the ESI†). It was also suggested to report the efficiency from maximum power point tracking (mpp, Fig. S4 in the ESI†).47
Furthermore, we investigated the long-term device stability of slot die coated devices (Fig. 12). The slot die coated devices showed incredible shelf life stability when stored under ambient conditions. Non-encapsulated devices were stable for one year and only showed signs of degradation after that. The main cause of efficiency loss was the fill factor. The encapsulated devices were stable for more than two years. This indicates the stability of the slot die coated films and interfaces between the different layers of the device stack.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the development of a truly industrial coating process for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. All layers of the mesoporous hole transport free carbon-based perovskite solar cell architecture were deposited by slot die coating in stripes on areas up to 10 × 10 cm. Different from other coating techniques, a process developed for a small area can be directly scaled-up to larger areas, depending on the slot width and table length of the instrument. The PCE of the best performing cells exceeds 12% and is thus in the range of the values reported for cells manufactured by screen printing, which is the standard manufacturing process for this cell architecture. We also suggest spectroscopic ellipsometry as a powerful in-line characterization tool which can deliver similar information to that from AFM and SEM. Inks for slot die coating are more dilute and contain a smaller volume fraction of binders. This posed serious challenges in the multi-layer printing process in terms of de-wetting during drying, but was rewarded with a coating process that has tremendous advantages over screen printing, in terms of not only the coating speed but also the ink composition.
The low binder content proved most advantageous for attempts to co-fire the entire layered stack after printing. This process yielded very poor results with screen printed samples while slot die coated solar cells showed only a minor decrease in efficiency, but a major reduction in processing time.
We have also demonstrated the excellent shelf-life stability of fully slot die coated cells exceeding 1 year when stored under ambient conditions.
The next steps to bring this manufacturing process closer to commercialization include the use of laser ablation for interconnect locations (P1, P2 and P3, see Fig. 2) to achieve higher active areas, the deposition of MAPbI3 using slot die coating to make use of one coating technique for all layers, and improving the efficiency of film drying for roll-to-roll processing.
Experimental section
Printing equipment
Slot die coating was performed on a TSE Troller (Switzerland) table top slot die coater, with a 50 mm wide slot die with integrated shim foils to define a line pattern.
Screen printing was performed on a DEK148 printer with different meshes as specified below.

Materials. 
For all inks, screen printing pastes commercially available from Solaronix, Switzerland, were used as the base material. For the cTiO2 layer, the titania precursor ink titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 75 wt% in isopropanal (Sigma Aldrich), was applied; for the mTiO2 layer, the titania paste Ti-nanoxide T165/SP (Solaronix, Switzerland) was utilized, and for the mZrO2 layer, the zirconia paste Zr-nanoxide ZT/SP (Solaronix, Switzerland) was used. The carbon paste Elcocarb B/SP is a mixture of 25 wt% of carbon nanoparticles and graphite flakes (Solaronix, Switzerland).


Device fabrication. 
The MPSC stack consists of a multilayered system of cTiO2 (50 nm), mTiO2 (500 nm), mZrO2 (1000 nm) and carbon (10–12 μm).
Devices were fabricated on 100 mm × 100 mm glass plates coated with laser patterned FTO. The substrates were cleaned by sequential sonication in DI water with a pH neutral surfactant, acetone, and isopropanol. After wet cleaning, the substrates were dried with pressurized air and heated to 110 °C for more than 10 min to remove moisture. The FTO glass was also oxygen plasma cleaned to remove any organic residue.
The reference cells were fabricated by semi-automatic screen printing one layer after the other. On the 100 mm × 100 mm substrate, an array of 18 squares, 10 mm × 10 mm in size, were defined by the stencil (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Ti-Nanoxide BL150/SP, Ti-nanoxide T165/SP, Zr-nanoxide ZT/SP and Elcocarb B/SP were printed using a 150–30, 165–30, 90–48 and 43–80 mesh stencil, respectively. The screen printing inks of mTiO2 and mZrO2 are composed of metal oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm, and nano-particular carbon with a size of about 30 nm. The graphite flakes are in the range of several microns.
After printing the wet film, each sample was allowed to dwell for 10 min before drying at 120 °C for 10 min, followed by a firing step at 500 °C (or 400 °C for carbon) for 30 min, after a 30 min ramp.
For the development of suitable inks, we fabricated devices (hereafter called development cells), wherein the screen printed layers of the reference device were sequentially replaced by slot die coated layers, starting from the bottom, until all layers were slot die coated. The slot die layers consisted of stripes with a width of 15 mm (cTiO2 and mZrO2) or 14 mm (all other layers) defined by a shim foil. The mZrO2 and carbon layers were printed with an offset to fill the P1 scribe or connect to the FTO layer over the P1 scribe, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a. Similar to the reference cells, the screen printed layers consisted of 18 squares defined by the mesh. The following sample sets were fabricated: cTiO2 slot die coated, mTiO2, mZrO2 and carbon screen printed (1 layer SC); cTiO2 and mTiO2 slot die coated, mZrO2 and carbon screen printed (2 layers SC); cTiO2, mTiO2 and mZrO2 slot die coated, and carbon screen printed (3 layers SC). After coating the wet film, the screen printed layers were allowed to dwell for 10 min before drying at 120 °C for 10 min, followed by a firing step at 500 °C (or 400 °C for carbon) for 30 min, after a 30 min ramp. The slot die coated layers were dried at 70 °C for cTiO2 and 110 °C for the other layers for 10 min, and sintered at 500 °C (or 400 °C for carbon) for 30 min. The cTiO2 layer requires an additional drying step where the cTiO2 coated films were heated to 200 °C for 1 h before high temperature sintering. The lateral edges were defined by laser etching in order to form a rectangle similar to the screen printed electrodes. Only when the devices attained an efficiency comparable to the efficiency of the reference cell was the slot die coating of the next layer implemented. The ink development process is described in detail in the Results and discussion section.
In the fully slot die coated cells (fully SCs), all layers were deposited by slot die coating and sintered individually.
In co-fired slot die coated cells (co-fired SCs), all metal oxide layers were printed and dried, and the fully slot die coated stack was then co-fired at 450 °C for 1 h on a hotplate. Finally the carbon ink was applied and heated to 400 °C for 30 min. Coating was performed in a class 6 cleanroom.


Infiltration with perovskites. 
The freshly fired electrodes were masked with an adhesive polyimide gasket (Solaronix) to delimit the wet area. An empirically determined volume of 5.76 μl of the perovskite precursor solution was dropped in the center of each electrode using a micropipette. The solution was a methylammonium lead iodide perovskite precursor salt with a 5-aminovaleric acid iodide (5-AVAI) additive (Solaronix). The precursor salt was re-dissolved at 70 °C right prior to use.48 The infiltration of the MAPbI3 ink was done using a homemade semi- automated dispensing system. Infiltration is very critical and thus automating the process ensures a reproducible process, eliminating manual interference. The developed automated robotic dispensing system thus ensures controlled drop volume, timing, height of drop release and overall reproducibility. The wet samples were then moved to an oven set to 50 °C where they were dried for 60 min, thus forming the perovskite crystals in the porous electrode structure. The polyimide adhesive gasket was carefully peeled off, and the resulting solar cells were submitted to heat and damp treatment at 40 °C and 75% r.h. for 150 h.38 Special precautions were taken to avoid lead contamination, e.g. infiltration was done in a glove box dedicated to work on perovskites.


Characterization. 
Viscosity and density of the inks were measured on a falling ball viscometer from Anton Paar (LOVIS 2000 ME).
Surface tension of the inks was characterized with a drop shaped analyzer from Krüss (Fig. S6 in the ESI†).
Surface tension and wetting envelope of the individual layers were determined by following the theory of Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble49 and measuring the contact angle of water and diiodomethane on the surface to be investigated. Water has 51 mN m−1 of polar component and 21.8 mN m−1 of disperse component adding up to 72.8 mN m−1 surface tension. Diiodomethane, on the other hand, is a non-polar solvent with 50.8 mN m−1 of disperse component.
The thickness of the layers was determined with a profilometer (XP-1 Surface Profilometer, Ambios Technology). The surface topography was characterized by atomic force microscopy (ICON3 from Bruker) in tapping mode.
SEM images were taken with a FEI NanoSEM 230.
The crystallization behavior of the nanoparticles and the perovskite formation in the mesoporous structure were analyzed by XRD (Pan Analytics, X'Pet pRO).
Slot die printed samples were characterized after the addition of each layer before and after sintering using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam M-2000VI). Areas on the samples were identified by visual inspection where the coating seemed homogeneous. Measurements were performed at three incidence angles of 50°/60°/70°. All samples were prepared with a scotch tape on the backside to prevent backside reflections from reaching the detector.
Solar cell performance of the screen printed cells was measured on cells of 12 mm × 12.5 mm active area, and the solar cell performance of the slot die coated cells was measured on cells of about 12 mm × 12.5 mm size cut out of stripes. Silver paste was applied on both anode and cathode sides for current collection. The solar cells were fitted with an opaque black adhesive vinyl mask bearing a 0.64 cm2 aperture (Solaronix), and measured in a SolarSim 150 solar simulator (Solaronix) calibrated to 1000 W m−2. The voltage was scanned between −0.3 and 1 V, in 5 mV increments every 1.2 s. For comparison, this slow scanning method was compared to another protocol and to maximum power point tracking as well as to efficiency monitoring at a constant voltage (Fig. S4 in the ESI†).

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the process of slot die coating.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cross-section of a MPSC module, indicating the different layers, as well as the serial connections between adjacent stripes. The connections can be realized by adapting the stripe width and offset of the corresponding layers or by laser scribing. (b) Schematics of the processing steps of a fully slot die coated MPSC cell using stripe coating. Compact titania (cTiO2), mesoporous titania (mTiO2), mesoporous zirconia (mZrO2) and carbon layers are sequentially slot die coated. In between the individual coating steps, the samples are dried as specified and only after the mesoporous multilayer film was completed was the entire stack sintered all together (co-firing). In the last step the solar cell is completed by automatic infiltration of the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution. (c) Making of small area MPSC solar cells for characterization from stripe coated samples: glass pieces of 25 mm × 20 mm size are cut from the substrates, and an active cell area of 16 mm × 12 mm is then defined by laser scribing.	 

 	Fig. 3  Results of slot die coated stripe coatings (green arrows) after drying with the following inks. (a and b) TAA:tetralin 1:10 after single and double coating, respectively, (c) TAA:tetralin:iPrOH 1:5:5, double coating, (d) TAA:tetralin:iPrOH:EtOH 1:10:5:5, annealing at 70 °C, (e) TAA:tetralin:iPrOH:EtOH 3:20:20:20, annealing 70 °C, double coating, (f) TAA:tetralin:iPrOH:EtOH 3:20:20:20 + surfactant, annealing at 70 °C, double coating.

 	Fig. 5  X-ray diffraction patterns of the MSPC stack after MAPbI3 infiltration and annealing. The XRD spectrum is dominated by the (101) peak of TiO2 anatase at 2Θ = 25.3° (inset). A zoom into the peaks of lower intensity shows the characteristic peaks of the cubic phase of the perovskite crystal.50 No decomposition product of perovskites into PbI2 is present. PbI2 would have a characteristic peak at 2Θ = 12.5°.
