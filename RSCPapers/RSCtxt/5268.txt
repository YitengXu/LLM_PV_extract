    , Accepted 23rd April 2012First published on 24th April 2012AbstractThis paper reports a hot-injection method of preparing AgInS2 nanocrystals with different sizes and morphologies, starting with the capping agents of oleylamine and dodecylthiol, and varying the reaction conditions. The effects of the temperature and time on the growth of AgInS2 nanocrystals are investigated. These parameters have a tremendous impact on the size and morphology of the nanocrystals, allowing the controlled synthesis of shapes including nanoparticles and nanorods. It has been found that the size of the nanoparticles and nanorods can be controlled by changing the time of nanocrystal growth. The evolution from nanoparticles to nanorods can be controlled by the reaction temperature. The possible formation mechanism and growth process of the AgInS2 nanocrystals are discussed based on the experimental results. The AgInS2 nanocrystal ink with a bandgap of 1.90 eV can produce crack-free films. As a proof-of-concept, thin film solar cells made by using such AgInS2 films as absorber layers are tested for their viability as a type of solar cell material and are found to exhibit a measurable photovoltaic response.
1. Introduction
Semiconductor nanocrystals have received considerable interest because of their fascinating shape- and size-dependent properties, not only for fundamental scientific research but also for a wide range of technological applications, including biomedical tags, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors and solar cells.1–3 Among the known semiconductor nanocrystals, metal chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals might be one of the most significant categories which have been extensively studied and widely used as building blocks for linear and nonlinear optical devices and photovoltaic solar cells. In recent years, the use of nanocrystals as precursors for large-scale fabrication of films with applications in solar energy conversion and other optoelectronic applications is an emerging and important area in materials chemistry and materials science.4 Compared with the traditional physical deposition techniques, the application of suitable inorganic colloidal nanocrystal inks to form films is particularly appealing. This solution route enables lower fabrication costs in a scalable coating process and can lead to high efficiency as a result of advancements in colloidal hot-injection synthesis of high-quality nanocrystals. It is known that metal chalcogenide semiconductors have played an active role as absorber layers for thin film photovoltaic devices.5,6 Some of the highest confirmed efficiencies for single-junction polycrystalline devices have been achieved with CdTe and CuInGaSe2 layers.7,8 A variety of inks have been developed for the solution processing of metal chalcogenide thin films for solar cells. Inks for chalcopyrite materials such as CuInSe2, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2, and CuZnSn(S,Se)2, have enjoyed particular attention, along with deposition and processing strategies for achieving the desired compounds.9–12
As the quality of nanocrystals plays a decisive role for the performance of the nanodevices, the ability to control the size, shape, composition, mono-dispersity, and surface properties of the nanocrystals is critically important for studying their intrinsic properties and for exploiting their novel optical, electric, and magnetic properties for practical applications. Notably, great progress has been made in nanocrystals synthesis in recent years. Many synthetic methods have developed to produce uniform nanocrystals, including hydrothermal/solvothermal approaches, the single-source precursor approach, the hot-injection approach and the template-directed method.13–15 Among them, the hot-injection method has led to the successful synthesis of a variety of high-quality colloidal nanocrystals. The hot-injection-based method usually provides a better control of the nanocrystal size and has been widely used for the production of monodisperse CdS and CdSe nanocrystals.16,17 Therefore, the investigation of the nanocrystal growth process and optical properties during hot-injection synthesis could provide a powerful tool to control nanocrystal sizes and optical characteristics.
Compared with the significant progress in monodisperse Cu-based chalcogenide colloids, research on ternary Ag-based chalcogenide colloids has been limited, owing to the lack of suitable synthetic methods. As one of the most important ternary chalcogenides, AgInS2 is an intriguing functional material because of its promising applications in photovoltaic, optoelectronic and photocatalytic fields.18–20 Ternary AgInS2 has a distinctive absorption in the visible and near-infrared region because of its large absorption coefficient and its bandgap energy between 1.87 and 2.03 eV, which makes it promising for applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronic fields.21 All these advantages are stimulating scientists to synthesize AgInS2 nanocrystals with controlled sizes and morphologies. Up to now, many methods for preparing AgInS2 nanocrystals have been reported, such as the solvothermal synthesis approach, the spray pyrolysis technique and the single-source precursor approach.22–24 These approaches are important for understanding the formation process and mechanism of complex AgInS2. Due to the advantages of the hot-injection method, developing such facile methods to prepare AgInS2 nanocrystals with controlled shape and size remains of interest and importance for their further applications.
In this paper, the synthesis of AgInS2 nanocrystals with different sizes and morphologies has been realized by a hot-injection method. Control over the reaction time and temperature allows the nucleation, as well as the growth of AgInS2 nanocrystals, so that the sizes and morphologies of the nanocrystals can be adjusted. The AgInS2 nanocrystals can disperse readily in toluene solvent and form uniform, crack-free micrometer-thick films on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass by a drop-casting method. As a proof-of-concept, the AgInS2 films can be tested as a light-absorbing material for use in photovoltaic devices. The AgInS2 nanocrystals-based solar cell exhibited a reproducible photovoltaic response, with a conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 and illumination of 0.50%. These results demonstrate that the AgInS2 nanocrystals may be a viable photovoltaic material.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Silver acetate (AgAc, 99.99%), indium(III), acetate (In(Ac)3, 99.99%), octadecene (ODE, 90%), oleylamine (97%), n-dodecylthiol (99.9%) and sulfur powder (S, 9.999%) were purchased from Aldrich. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthetic method

Synthesis of AgInS2 nanocrystals. 
In a typical synthesis of 9-nm sized AgInS2, 0.02 mmol of AgAc, 0.02 mmol of In(Ac)3, 1 mL of n-dodecylthiol and 9 mL of octadecene were added to a 25 ml three-neck round bottom flask connected to a Schlenk line apparatus and de-gassed at 200 °C under vacuum for 30 min; afterward, the precursors were observed to be dissolved completely. Then a solution of 0.04 mmol sulfur dissolved in 5 mL oleylamine was injected under gentle stirring into the hot reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was held at 200 °C and stirred for 2 h. Finally, the solution was cooled to room temperature and the product was precipitated with the addition of 5 mL ethanol. The nanocrystals were separated from the solution through centrifugation. When the reaction was heated at 200 °C for 2 min, an aliquot was removed by a syringe and injected into a large volume of toluene at room temperature to quench the reaction. The AgInS2 nanocrystals with a smaller size of 4 nm were finally obtained.


Synthesis of AgInS2 nanorods. 
0.02 mmol of AgAc, 0.02 mmol of In(Ac)3, 1 mL of n-dodecylthiol and 9 mL of octadecene were added to a 25 ml three-neck round bottom flask connected to a Schlenk line apparatus and degassed at 140 °C under vacuum for 30 min. Then a solution of 0.04 mmol sulfur dissolved in 5 mL oleylamine was injected under gentle stirring into the hot reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was held at 140 °C and stirred for 2 h. The AgInS2 nanorods with a smaller size were obtained at 140 °C and stirred for 2 min.


AgInS2 nanocrystal film deposition and photovoltaic device fabrication. 
AgInS2 ink was obtained by dissolving 5 mL AgInS2 nanocrystals in 10 mL toluene and then sonicating for 30 min to make a uniform solution. About 1 μm-thick films of nanocrystals were deposited onto FTO glass substrates by dropping the AgInS2 nanocrystal ink. The films were fully dried by placing the substrates in a vacuum chamber at room temperature for 12 h. Furthermore, the obtained AgInS2 films were processed by heat treatment at 450 °C for 30 min in Ar and then sulfur atmospheres at 450 °C for 30 min. The photovoltaic devices based on AgInS2 electrodes obtained before and after heat treatment were constructed by a configuration of Au/polysulfide electrolyte/AgInS2/FTO. The active area of the cell was 0.16 cm2. The Au electrode was obtained by thermal evaporation, and the polysulfide solution electrolyte was a mixture of 1 M Na2S and 1 M S dissolved in 1 M NaOH. Cell I and Cell II were assembled by the AgInS2 electrodes obtained before and after heat treatment, respectively.

2.3 Characterization
The crystal structure and purity of the sample was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, using a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu K radiation) at a scanning rate of 4° min−1 in the range of 10–80°. The valence states of the films were detected by a Kratos xis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer at an accelerating voltage of 13 kV and a pass energy of 35.75 eV (PHI, PHI5300 system), in which the XPSPEAK software was used for the fitting of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement were prepared by depositing a drop of nanocrystals in toluene or hexane solution onto carbon-coated copper grids and leaving the solvent to dry. The size and morphology of the samples was determined by TEM performed with a Philips Tecnai F20 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, fitted with an energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) system. UV–visible absorption spectra were measured by a JASCO V-550. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on AgInS2 electrodes with a device configuration of Au/polysulfide electrolyte/AgInS2/FTO was evaluated using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The measurement of current density–voltage curves was carried out in the dark and under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), using a XES-151 S solar simulator (San-Ei, Japan). The standard irradiance level (1 Sun conditions, 100 mW cm−2) was set using a calibrated c-Si reference solar cell.
3. Results and discussions
The purities and crystal structures of the products were analyzed by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of a typical AgInS2 sample prepared by the hot-injection method, using metal acetate precursors at 200 °C for 2 h. All of the reflection peaks in the XRD pattern of the as-prepared sample located at 2θ = 26.9°, 28.6°, 44.5°, 48.2°, and 53.5° can be indexed to (002), (121/201), (320/040), (123)/(203) and (322) of the pure orthorhombic phase of AgInS2 (JCPDS 00–025–1328). No other impurities, such as In2S3, Ag2S, or oxides were detected by XRD analysis, indicating the phase purity of the AgInS2 product. Here the metastable orthorhombic AgInS2 nanocrystals were obtained at 200 °C, although the orthorhombic phase is less thermodynamically stable compared with the tetragonal phase. The reason might be that the solvent adjusted the chemical growth environment, leading to the reversion of the relative phase stability.13,23 Compared with those of the bulky counterpart, the peaks are relatively broadened, which indicates that the nanoparticles have small crystal sizes.

The valence state information of the AgInS2 sample fabricated at 200 °C for 2 h can be properly provided by XPS (Fig. 2). The full scan spectrum shows the presence of the Ag3d, In3d and S2p peaks, which confirmed the presence of these elements in the product (Fig. 2a). The Ag3d, In3d and S2p core levels were also examined, respectively. It is observed that the Ag3d core splits into 3d5/2 (367.0 eV) and 3d3/2 (373.5 eV) peaks (Fig. 2b). The binding energies of In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 can be assigned as 444.5 eV and 452.1 eV (Fig. 2c). The S2p1/2 peaks at 161.3 and 162.2 eV can be assigned to S coordinated to Ag and In in AgInS2 (Fig. 2d). The binding energies of Ag3d, In3d and S2p in AgInS2 are consistent with those reported in the literature.22 These results show that the chemical states of the sample are Ag+, In3+, and S2−. All the above results demonstrate that crystalline AgInS2 nanocrystals can be readily synthesized by using the metal acetate precursors at 200 °C for 2 h.

The morphology, particle size and structure of the product were characterized by SEM, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and EDS. Fig. 3a–d show the TEM and HRTEM images of the AgInS2 obtained at 200 °C for 2 h. It can be observed that the nanocrystals are composed of orthorhombic phase AgInS2 with an average diameter of 9 nm and a slightly irregular, faceted shape (Fig. 3a–c). The HRTEM images show lattice fringes that are well-matched to their XRD patterns, in which the d values of 0.332 nm in Fig. 3d correspond to the (002) peaks of the orthorhombic AgInS2 in Fig. 1. Fig. 3e shows the size distribution of the as- synthesized AgInS2 nanocrystals, which have sizes ranging from 7 to 11 nm and an average size of about 9 nm. The chemical composition of the orthorhombic AgInS2 nanocrystals was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and they have a Ag/In/S molar ratio of 24.3%: 26.8%: 48.9%, which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of AgInS2. The observation of carbon and oxygen as additional elements is attributed to the presence of oleylamine and dodecylthiol as surface capping molecules.25

In this work, the effect of the reaction conditions on the size and shapes of AgInS2 nanocrystals was investigated by manipulating their growth kinetics in different reaction times and temperatures. Fig. 4 reveals the TEM images of the AgInS2 products synthesized at a temperature of 200 °C for 2 min and a temperature of 140 °C for 2 min and 2 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the AgInS2 nanocrystals obtained at 200 °C for 2 min are relatively uniform and the size is as small as 4 nm. Nanocrystal nucleation was observed visually when the reaction solution rapidly changed from yellow to black after several seconds of injection at 200 °C. The continuous lattice fringes in the HRTEM image further confirms that the as-synthesized AgInS2 nanocrystals are highly crystalline (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that the use of capping agents oleylamine and dodecylthiol allowed the production of smaller AgInS2 nanocrystals in a comparatively short reaction time. The morphology evolution of the AgInS2 nanocrystals was conducted by changing the injection temperature. When the reaction temperature was decreased from 200 °C to 140 °C, some elongated objects with irregular profiles were produced, as shown in Fig. 4c. These primitive nanocrystals are relatively small and agglomerated. With the reaction time further increased to 2 h at 140 °C, the products are composed of longer nanorods (Fig. 4e). The average length and diameter of the nanorods were estimated to be 30 and 3 nm, respectively. The lattice fringes of the AgInS2 nanorods are clearly shown in the inset, with fringe spacing of about 3.32 Å and 3.12 Å. These fringes correspond to (002) and (121) lattice planes for the orthorhombic phase of AgInS2.

It is known that hot-injection synthesis is a representative synthetic method to produce nanocrystals of various materials.26 The rapid injection of precursors into a hot reaction solution can stimulate a short burst of nucleation, and the subsequent growth by aging at a mild lower temperature can result in the desired nanocrystals. Based on the above results, a possible reaction process is proposed as shown in Fig. 5. Inorganic AgAc and In(Ac)3 precursors are dissolved into the octadecene solvent. With injection of the S/oleylamine solution into the octadecene solution under vigorous stirring, the oleylamine is capped on the surface of the nanocrystals, preventing their agglomeration and endowing them with good colloidal stability. Furthermore, the use of dodecylthiol helps to reduce the reactivity difference of the precursors, which is beneficial for the successful formation of the homogeneous reversion stoichiometry-controlled AgInS2 nanocrystals.27 During the synthesis, oleylamine surfactant molecules rapidly form metal–oleylamine complexes with metal ions. After that, the nucleation simultaneously takes place between metal complexes and sulfur in the octadecene solution.28 The extremely fast reaction of the precursors directly leads to a sudden increase in the supersaturation level in the solution and the formation of nanocrystals commences immediately. Nanocrystal nucleation could be observed visually when the reaction solution rapidly changed from yellow to black after several seconds of heating at 200 °C. After nucleation, metallic cations are mainly used for the growth process via diffusion-controlled transfer, which indicates an Ostwald ripening mechanism.29 At this stage of growth, smaller nanocrystals are absorbed by larger nanocrystals, causing the AgInS2 dispersed ensemble as time progresses.
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of the nucleation and growth process of AgInS2 nanocrystals. 
In a hot-injection process, it is suggested that the balance between kinetic and thermodynamic control is an important factor to control the final shape of AgInS2 nanocrystals. At high temperatures, both surface diffusion and monomer desorption are favored.30 As a result, nuclei grow isotropically leading to the formation of somewhat faceted irregular shaped structures that minimize the surface energy for a given nanocrystal volume. In contrast, at relatively low reaction temperatures, the nanocrystal morphology is kinetically controlled. The nanocrystal grows preferentially in the kinetically most favorable direction, which is the one with the smallest activation barrier for the rate-limiting step in the growth process. In our experiment, the growth process appears to be under thermodynamic control at a high growth temperature of 200 °C. At this growth temperature, isotropic growth is favorable, and therefore, faceted irregular shaped AgInS2 nanocrystals are obtained at an early stage of the reaction. The high temperature also leads to higher nucleation rates and therefore a larger number of nuclei since the activation energy for nucleation is generally higher than that for growth. These nuclei compete for the remaining precursor, resulting in fast depletion of it. Further aging of the system is necessary for the growth of the shaped product, resulting in a larger size of the nanocrystals. In contrast, at the low growth temperature and in the presence of oleylamine and dodecylthiol, the growth may dominate the process, resulting in AgInS2 nanorods through anisotropic crystal growth.31 According to the theory proposed by Peng’s group, a high monomer concentration favors the growth of elongated nanocrystals.32 At a low temperature, the depletion of monomers in the nucleation process and the number of nuclei formed should decrease. This would keep the monomer chemical potential in the solution at a relatively high level, so that the formation of the nanorods can be promoted. Further aging of the system at this temperature promotes an Ostwald ripening process in which larger nanocrystals grow at the cost of smaller ones, increasing both the length and the polydispersity of the nanocrystals.
It is important to determine the optical properties of the AgInS2 nanocrystals for their photoelectrical applications. Fig. 6 shows the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the 9 nm AgInS2 nanocrystals in toluene solvent and a photo of the AgInS2 ink. It is found that the AgInS2 ink is a stable suspension of nanocrystals. The AgInS2 ink exhibits a broad absorption in a wavelength range from UV to visible light, with an especially strong absorption with a steep shape on the visible edge. The inset shows the bandgap of the AgInS2 film estimated from the plots of (αhν)2vs. hν, which was derived from its corresponding UV–vis absorbance spectrum. Due to the direct forbidden transition, the absorption characteristics of the sample obey the model equation: (αhν)2 = B(hν–Eg), where α is the optical absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, ν is the photon frequency, B is a constant, and Eg the energy gap. The extrapolated value (the straight line to the x-axis) of hν at 0 gives an absorption bandgap edge Eg corresponding to 1.90 eV, which is close to the reported value.21 Due to the appropriate bandgap, the AgInS2 has been considered as a promising candidate to produce solar cells.

As the creation of a suitable inorganic colloidal nanocrystal ink for use in a scalable coating process is a key step in the fabrication of low-cost solar cells, the obtained AgInS2 nanocrystals were used to prepare an ink by precipitation and redispersion in toluene easily. Then the AgInS2 absorber layer was formed simply by drop-casting the ink on FTO glass. Fig. 7a–d shows the top and cross-sectional SEM images of the AgInS2 films before and after heat treatment. After drying, the surface SEM image of the AgInS2 film shows that the AgInS2 nanocrystals interconnect with each other to present a waxy solid morphology, which may be due to the presence of the organic capping agents, oleylamine and dodecylthiol, on the AgInS2 surface. The films were annealed under a flow of Ar at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the organic capping molecules, and then under sulfur vapor at a temperature of 450 °C for 30 min.33 After heat treatment, the nanocrystals crystallized to form large crystal grains. Many grains extended across the entire film (Fig. 7d). Furthermore, the film is nearly free of drying cracks, which is crucial for obtaining functional photovoltaics without electrical shorts. This recrystallization process is similar to the reported heat treatment result of CuInSe2 film.4 The cross-sectional SEM image of the obtained AgInS2 film shows that the grain structures have a uniform thickness of 1 μm, which is not enough variation compared to the film before heat treatment (Fig. 7c and d). After sulfurization, the ratio of Ag:In:S is nearly 26.1%:24.3%:49.6%, and the estimated bandgap of the AgInS2 layer is approximately 1.92 eV.
 Fig. 7  Top (a, b) and cross-sectional (c, d) SEM images of the AgInS2 films before and after heat treatment, and EDS and (αhν)2vs. hν curves after heat treatment. 
The obtained AgInS2 nanocrystal-based films were tested as the light-absorbing layer in solar cells to determine their viability for that application. The photovoltaic test devices were constructed in a layered architecture of Au/polysulfide electrolyte/AgInS2/FTO (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b and c show the photovoltaic parameters and current density–voltage curves of the solar cells based on AgInS2 films obtained before and after heat treatment under AM 1.5 illumination. It is found that after heat treatment the total conversion efficiency of Cell II increases from 0.06 to 0.50% under AM 1.5 illumination. Correspondingly, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and the fill factor (FF) values of the solar cell after heat treatment are all higher than those of the solar cell before heat treatment. Thus, the heat-treatment of the films can improve the overall performance of the assembled cells. The reason is that heat-treatment removes the surface ligands and sinters the nanocrystals into a more continuous film, which should improve its carrier mobility.34–36 In addition, the increased grain size in the AgInS2 film can improve the charge transport through the film. It should be mentioned that the low efficiency of the solar cell is possibly caused by the combination of a high series resistance and a low shunt resistance, arising from many factors related to the device, including the holes or cracks in the nanocrystal film and poor contact among the AgInS2 absorber and the FTO glass. Although the efficiency of the AgInS2-based solar cell is limited, the photovoltaic response of the AgInS2 nanocrystal devices provides a proof-of-principle that the AgInS2 film obtained by the drop-casting process is viable in solar cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, orthorhombic AgInS2 nanocrystals with variable sizes and morphologies were prepared by a hot-injection process using octadecene solvent and mixed capping agents, oleylamine and dodecylthiol, with different reaction temperatures and times. Different sizes and morphologies of the AgInS2 nanocrystals were strongly dependent on injection temperature. Crack-free AgInS2 thin films with a uniform thickness of 1 μm could be obtained by drop-casting the AgInS2 toluene-based, stable colloidal ink and annealing at 450 °C in Ar and sulfur atmospheres for 30 min, respectively. The present approach provides an accessible way to produce the AgInS2 based light-absorbing layer by applying a solution-based process. The obtained AgInS2 nanocrystal film in the layered Au/polysulfide electrolyte/AgInS2/FTO presented reproducible photovoltaic responses with power conversion efficiencies up to 0.50%. These devices provide a baseline performance and demonstrate, as a proof-of-concept, that these nanocrystals can be used in photovoltaic devices. Further synthetic improvements and optimization of the device fabrication should lead to the enhancement of conversion efficiency. There are also opportunities to combine these nanocrystals with other materials, like inorganic or organic materials, to generate bulk heterojunction devices based on these nanocrystals. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy may be extended to fabricate other functional ternary semiconductor nanocrystals on various conducting substrates, which is beneficial for their applications in various optoelectronic and electronic devices, including solar cells, transparent electrodes, thin-film transistors, and memories.
