1. Introduction
The rapid progress in nanoscience and technology provides opportunities for manufacturing nanostructures via efficient processing routes. Nanostructures with a large surface area especially a large interface structure could enhance the effectiveness of these materials. Hence, hybrid nanolayered architectures based on two-dimensional (2D) structures are increasingly significant for the design and fabrication of next-generation structural nanomaterials that can provide outstanding physical, chemical and mechanical behaviors. 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid architectures are attracting attention in applied research for their potential applications in fields such as energy storage,1–3 energy conversion,4,5 catalysis,6,7 sensors,8 and electrochemistry.9 Research in 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures is relatively new and publication records are quite limited.10 However, this field is developing rapidly because many emerging high-efficiency clean energy devices are incorporated with such novel nanostructures. Generally, the inorganic components of layered organic–inorganic materials provide favorable physical, chemical and mechanical properties,11 while the organic components provide flexibility and low density to the material.11 Therefore, heterostructures based on 2D layered organic–inorganic architectures offer opportunities to develop new desirable materials with tunable properties that are intermediate between those of components.
There are several bottom-up film deposition techniques for the synthesis of 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterials including sol–gel,12 solution-processing,13–15 Langmuir–Blodgett (LB),16 layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly,17,18 and molecular layer deposition (MLD)/atomic layer deposition (ALD)19–22 techniques. Gas-phase techniques such as ALD/MLD are able to control the film thickness and composition at the atomic and molecular level; thereby having a capability to uniformly coat high aspect ratio structures.11 Among the above-mentioned techniques; solution-processing, ALD and MLD are three approaches that have been widely used for many applications.10,11,23 Solution-processing is an alternative possibility to traditional vacuum-based deposition techniques that is employed to deposit transparent thin films. This technique is favored because of its simplicity, scalability and low cost.24 The inorganic ALD structure demonstrates a conformal structure at the atomic level control (∼1 Å) on high aspect ratio structures (Table 1).25–29 These thin films are continuous and pinhole-free.28,29 The ALD technique is typically used for the synthesis of metal oxides and metal nitride binary materials.11

If a layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterial grows in a molecular way rather than in an atomic way, then the deposition method is known as MLD. The MLD technique has been adopted for the deposition of organic polymers since the 1990s.39,40 Research on MLD is limited and according to Meng's report,10 there are just 100 research papers recorded. The main reason is due to a shortage of appropriate coupling precursors. However, MLD is a promising technique for growing new polymers and hybrid composites with accurately controlled structures.10 MLD thus has recently attracted attention in technological areas such as clean energy and surface engineering for developing advanced organic and hybrid organic–inorganic materials that have unique properties.

Fig. 1 displays schematics of solution-processing (Fig. 1a), ALD (Fig. 1b) and MLD (Fig. 1c) techniques using sequential and self-limiting surface reactions. Metal alkoxide films could be grown from their metal precursors and various organic alcohols using the MLD technique.11 These metal alkoxide films are known as “metalcones”.41 The first metalcones were “alucones” that were fabricated by Dameron et al.42 using trimethylaluminum (C6H18Al2, TMA as a metal precursor) and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, EG as an organic precursor). A broad range of hybrid organic–inorganic films have been fabricated with other organic precursors such as carboxylic acids (R–COOH)22,43 or alkylsilanes [R–Si(OR)3].44–47

In the late 2000s, ALD and MLD approaches were combined to generate organic–inorganic hybrid composites.20 The feasibility to mix and match organic and inorganic precursors leads to the formation of a broad spectrum of hybrid multilayer films with various properties.11 The layered organic–inorganic nanostructures may not only possess properties from film constituents, but also have completely new properties. It is also possible to tune the mechanical, chemical and other physical properties by varying the film components and thickness. For example, the film properties of metal alkoxides may vary from soft, low dense (representative of the organic constituent) to hard, dense metal oxides that are based on the inorganic constituent.
The tunable properties of engineered hybrid organic–inorganic multilayers show high promise in fabricating advanced multilayer nanostructures with desirable properties. Hence, this review paper examines 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures and their important roles and applications in the research field of clean energy. This review starts with the introduction of a few versatile chemical approaches for the bottom-up fabrication of heterostructures based on 2D layered organic–inorganic materials. Subsequently, the tunable properties of layered organic–inorganic nanomaterials are discussed. The field of 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures is then segmented on the basis of the current status and high-performance applications, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs), water splitting, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and thermoelectric devices, as well as their challenges. The final section concludes with an outlook on future directions for layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanomaterials.
2. Bottom-up chemical approaches for the fabrication of 2D layered organic–inorganic heterostructures
Bottom-up chemical approaches play a substantial role in developing nanostructured materials at the atomic or molecular level. Therefore, these methods deliver superior chemical homogeneity in comparison to top-down physical techniques.50 Furthermore, chemical processing design and synthesis of new materials may be refined into the final end products.50 However, toxic reagents and solvents are regularly employed for the synthesis of nanostructured materials.51 There are several bottom-up chemical methods for fabricating 2D layered hybrid organic–inorganic nanostructures; of which several will be described briefly in the following section.
2.1. Solution-processing
Solution-processing is a versatile technique for depositing transparent thin films over substrate surfaces. It permits researchers to tune the composition and, therefore, the properties of the final coatings. Fig. 2a presents a flowchart for a typical solution-processing method. Solution deposition uses a precursor whose chemical structure includes the cation of interest and reacts to form the desired structure. The precursor selection depends on the chemical formulation of the thin film, solvent and processing route. The solution-processing route for transparent conducting oxide thin films usually engages acetates, chlorides or nitrates since these precursors are inexpensive and commercially available.24 There are some other precursor candidates that have been reviewed by Pasquarelli et al.24 After the selection of precursors, the formulation of coating solution is the second step which involves the selection of a solvent and an additive. There are two main types of formulations used for the coating solution: (i) metal–organic/ionic solutions and (ii) colloidal nanoparticle suspensions. Each type of formulation has intrinsic advantages and disadvantages.24

Panel (b and c) reproduced with permission from data published in ref. 53, Copyright 2017, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 
This film deposition that can be performed at atmospheric pressure with minimal equipment investment is the next step in a solution-processing technique. There are several scalable deposition approaches,24 as named in Fig. 2a, which are viable for uniform and large-area coverage.
Thermal processing is the last step of the solution-processing approach which is performed for (i) decomposition of the precursors and removal of any organics, (ii) crystallization or phase transformation, and (iii) controlling electron carrier concentration. Thermal processing can be performed on a hotplate or in an adjusted environment with a tube furnace. The curing and sintering temperatures during thermal treatment of nanoparticle thin films are different.52 Particles drop their organic capping shell at the curing temperature and begin displaying conductivity since they are in direct physical contact. However, sintering occurs at a higher temperature and leads to neck formation between particles. Therefore, sintering results in a dense film rather than nanoparticulate networks.
Chen et al.53 reported a facile solution-processing method to produce a monolayer or few layers of an organic–inorganic perovskite (Fig. 2b and c). They dissolved PbBr2 and C4H9NH3+Br2− in dimethylformamide (DMF) via a two-step solution process to form the perovskite precursor. The precursor directly crystallizes into a 2D cross star and layered cubic (C4H9NH3+)2PbBr42− perovskites upon evaporation (Fig. 2b and c). The fabricated cross star nanostructure has large dimensional 2D perovskites that are ultrathin and exhibit high stability and significant photoelectric conversion efficiency. This work demonstrated the successful synthesis of new 2D perovskite structures and confirmed improvements of optoelectronic devices primarily based on ultrathin 2D perovskites.
2.2. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)
ALD or atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) is a chemical deposition technique for fabricating high-quality, large surface area thin films with atomic size precision.54Fig. 3a demonstrates an ALD method where thin layers cyclically grow to form a binary compound from gaseous precursors. ALD can be described as a surface controlled LbL thin film deposition approach. It has the greatest advantages for developing thin films where film thickness and composition could be controlled at the atomic level. ALD can create a wide variety of film components with high density, low impurity and precise control of thickness. Deposition at low temperatures can relieve adverse influences on sensitive substrates. ALD has been employed for the deposition of selective metals or metal oxides on 2D nanomaterials such as the deposition of platinum (Pt) at graphene line defects55 or Al2O3 on 2D transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs).56

Panel (b and c) adapted with permission from data published in ref. 56, Copyright 2015, The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). 
The ALD technique has been considered by researchers in nanotechnology because of the nanoscale control of film thickness and the tunable chemical and physical properties.54 For instance, Wirtz et al.56 deposited ∼2 nm Al2O3 on pristine molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) via the ALD method (Fig. 3b) for electronic applications. Their study revealed that it is feasible to reliably seed the deposition using non-covalent functionalization with perylene derivatives such as perylene bisimide as the anchor unit (Fig. 3b and c). Their finding also indicated that the deposition reactivity depends on the number of TMD layers.
The slow deposition rate is the main drawback of the ALD method with only a portion of coverage usually deposited in each cycle. Nevertheless, a very thin layer is normally required for next-generation electronic devices and, hence, the slow growth rate of the ALD technique may not be a crucial issue.
2.3. Molecular layer deposition (MLD)
MLD is another chemical deposition technique. Similar to ALD, MLD is also a gaseous-phase process and has emerged for the deposition of organic constituents in nanoscale films. In fact, MLD has opened a new avenue for synthesizing novel nanostructured materials. This method can also grow high-quality thin films with controllable thickness and composition at the molecular-scale. Fig. 4a illustrates a MLD process using two homobifunctional precursors. The molecules of one precursor react with the surface by mechanisms of interlocking and chaining chemistry to form a molecular layer of the precursor on the surface with new reactive sites.10 This process continues with the molecules of another precursor until the thin film layers cyclically grow to establish a binary compound from gaseous precursors. The MLD method has been combined with the ALD technique to fabricate organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures.57 Jaggernauth et al.58 used the MLD method to functionalize the surface of graphene oxide with an organic–inorganic hybrid film using TMA (as a metal precursor) and ethylene glycol (EG) reagents (Fig. 4b). The analysis showed that thicknesses of 5, 8.5 and 12.5 nm were obtained after 20, 50 and 80 deposition cycles, respectively. Fig. 4c shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the deposited hybrid layer after 80 MLD cycles. The functionalized graphene oxide exhibits superior electrical, mechanical and thermal properties59–61 and, therefore, has great potential for applications such as energy-related materials, sensors or biomedical applications.

3. Tunable properties of 2D layered organic–inorganic heterostructures
The MLD/ALD layered nanostructures are prepared from at least two materials; for instance, hybrid organic–inorganic materials and their parent metal oxides. The sublayer and bilayer of the nanostructures, grown by using the metalcone MLD system and their parent metal oxide ALD system, can be adjusted by varying the relative cycle numbers of MLD and ALD. The organic sublayers fabricated by MLD exhibit a lower density that reflects the intrinsic properties of organic polymers, while the inorganic sublayers fabricated by ALD exhibit a much higher density. Thus, the density of layered nanostructures can be tuned from the low density of the pure MLD film to the high density of the inorganic ALD film.11 In addition to density, other properties such as conductivity, dielectric constant, mechanical and optical properties can be adjusted, as well. The following sections discuss the tunable properties of several noteworthy MLD/ALD layered nanostructures including Al2O3, zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), zinc oxide (ZnO) and lithium terephthalate (Li2C8H4O4, LiTP).
3.1. Al2O3-based layered organic–inorganic nanostructures
The layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures were manufactured using MLD/ALD methods at 135 °C by Lee et al.49,63 The layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures were deposited using several alucone MLD and Al2O3 ALD cycles in the reactant sequence. For instance, the 1:3 alucone/Al2O3 ultrathin nanolayer was grown using a repeated sequence of one cycle of alucone MLD and three cycles of Al2O3 ALD. The layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures with cycle ratios from 1:3 to 6:1 were synthesized and their electron density, refractive index, elastic modulus and hardness were studied (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  (a) A schematic demonstration of 1:1 alucone alloy film growth with Al2O3 ALD and alucone MLD using TMA and EG, respectively. (b) TEM image of the 1:1 alucone alloy film sandwiched between two Al2O3 ALD films. (c) Electron density (top) and refractive index (bottom) of Al2O3 ALD, alucone MLD and alucone alloys deposited with different ALD/MLD ratios (the results are plotted against the fraction of ALD cycles in the reaction sequence). (d) Elastic modulus (top) and hardness (bottom) of Al2O3 ALD, alucone MLD and alucone alloys grown with ALD/MLD cycle ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3.

Fig. 5a and b display a schematic reaction sequence of (TMA:EG)/(TMA:H2O) for the formation of the 1:1 alucone/Al2O3 ultrathin nanolayer and its cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image. The electron density and refractive index values (Fig. 5c) are altered from those of pure alucone and pure Al2O3. The electron density transitioned from a base level of 5.0 × 1023 e− cm−3 for pure alucone MLD films to a maximum of 8.9 × 1023 e− cm−3 for pure Al2O3 ALD films. The refractive index also shifted from 1.45 to 1.64 for pure alucone MLD and pure Al2O3 ALD films, respectively. The mass density increases for higher ALD:MLD ratios during the alucone alloy growth.11 This effect indicates that the density of the layered nanostructure can be tuned by varying the relative cycle numbers of ALD and MLD during the nanolayer growth. The other physical properties that depend on the film density may, therefore, be adjusted accordingly.
The mechanical properties of nanolayered alucone/Al2O3 structures change with the composition of the film. The elastic modulus of the pure alucone film (grown by MLD) and pure Al2O3 film (grown by ALD) is 21 ± 8 GPa and 198 ± 8 GPa, respectively (Fig. 5d). The elastic modulus progressively increases for the alucone/Al2O3 layered nanostructures with cycle ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1, before reaching 198 ± 8 GPa for the pure Al2O3 ALD film.11 The hardness values of nanolayers are also increased with the different ratios of ALD and MLD cycles (Fig. 5d). The hardness systematically increases for alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers with cycle ratios of 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1; and then move to 13 ± 0.2 GPa for the pure Al2O3 ALD film. The hardness value of the pure alucone MLD film is 1.0 ± 0.1 GPa.11
The stability of the alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers was investigated and compared to those of pure alucone films.11 The stability of the alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers was examined with respect to films of different MLD/ALD ratios deposited onto Si substrates. Pure 32 nm thick alucone MLD films showed a reduction of around 23% in thickness within the first seven days of fabrication, which is consistent with previous studies.11,42 The thickness of 78 nm thick alucone/Al2O3 nanolayer also deteriorated by 7% after one week. However, no thickness change was observed for the 1:1 and 3:1 nanolayers. These results indicate that the alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers containing a higher proportion of Al2O3 are more stable. The Al2O3 in the alucone alloy helps prevent any chemical change that can lead to film shrinkage.42
Xiao et al.64 examined the feasibility and barrier performance of layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures using O3 (at 80 °C) rather than H2O as the oxidant. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), SEM, water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), current–voltage–luminance (I–V–L), and lifetime measurements under ambient conditions of 20 °C and 60% relative humidity (RH) were performed. The AFM results indicated that the O3 fabricated nanolayer was smoother than the H2O-based material. The average roughness for the O3 nanolayer was 0.342 ± 0.016 nm. However, H2O-based nanolayers demonstrated a higher roughness of 0.843 ± 0.024 nm under identical conditions.64 O3-based nanolayers also exhibit a reduced trend in the WVTR from 3.22 × 10−3 g per m2 per day to 2.37 × 10−5 g per m2 per day as the nanolayers increase from one to three, respectively. Nevertheless, the WVTR result for H2O-based nanolayers was 1.83 × 10−3 to 5.92 × 10−4 g per m2 per day. I–V–L measurements for both fabricated nanolayers (O3-based and H2O-based) demonstrate that O3-based nanolayers are not a detriment to the performance of layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures when used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The lifetime of OLEDs that are O3-based was approximately two-fold longer than that of the H2O-based layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures.64
The superior barrier performance of O3-based layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures may be attributed to the alucone layers between Al2O3 layers. The cross-sectional SEM characterization demonstrated that, when H2O is used as an oxidizer, there is no obvious interface between alucone MLD and Al2O3 ALD. Thus, the alucone layer may not grow suitably if H2O is used as an oxidant since residual H2O adsorption degrades the reaction between TMA and EG.64 Therefore, O3-based layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures can improve the barrier performance because (i) the growth of an alucone layer in alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers serves as a resistive interlayer that reacts easily with water; thereby reducing the diffusion speed and prolonging the diffusion path of water vapor penetration, and (ii) layered alucone/Al2O3 nanostructures present properties that prohibit the propagation of defects through the multilayer structure. Both of these characteristics are beneficial because they improve the associated WVTR.65,66
3.2. ZrO2-based layered organic–inorganic nanostructures
Zirconium alkoxide (zircone)/ZrO2 nanolayers have been grown by changing the relative number of zircone MLD and ZrO2 ALD cycles at 145 °C.63Fig. 6a illustrates the reaction sequence of zircone/ZrO2 layered nanostructures deposited by alternating one zircone MLD with one ZrO2 ALD cycle; i.e., the growth of the 1:1 zircone/ZrO2 nanolayer is (ZTB:EG)/(ZTB:H2O), where ZTB is zirconium tert-butoxide, Zr[OC(CH3)3]4. The mechanical properties of zircone/ZrO2 nanolayers grown with different ratios of MLD and ALD cycles (i.e., pure ZrO2, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and pure zircone) were studied by nanoindentation (Fig. 6b).11 The elastic modulus and hardness values of the pure zircone MLD and pure ZrO2 ALD films are E = 27 ± 0.6 GPa, H = 1.8 ± 0.1 GPa and E = 97 ± 5 GPa, H = 4.8 ± 0.4 GPa, respectively. The elastic modulus and hardness of zircone/ZrO2 nanolayers increase gradually with the increasing ratio of ALD:MLD cycles. The elastic modulus and hardness are higher for larger ZrO2 portions in the zircone/ZrO2 nanolayer,11 as would be expected if the composite properties were considered from the rule of mixture viewpoint.

The electron density of zircone/ZrO2 nanolayers, measured from X-ray reflectivity (XRR) analysis, changes with respect to the different ratios of ALD and MLD cycles (Fig. 6c). The maximum electron density is 1.1 × 1024 e− cm−3 for pure ZrO2 ALD films and the minimum electron density is 6.2 × 1023 e− cm−3 for pure zircone MLD films. The mass densities of the pure zircone MLD film and ZrO2 ALD film are 2.17 and 4.0 g cm−3, respectively, if compositions of –ZrO(CH2)2O– and ZrO2 for zircone and ZrO2 are assumed.11 The refractive index of zircone/ZrO2 nanolayers changes on increasing the ALD:MLD ratio. The refractive index change of zircone/ZrO2 nanolayers, which was also observed for alucone/Al2O3 nanolayers as well, is expected since there is a relationship between density and refractive index given by the Lorenz–Lorentz equation.11,67 The refractive index values of pure zircone MLD and ZrO2 ALD films are 1.63 and 1.86, respectively.
Zlotnikov et al.68 studied the nanoindentation and toughening effects of layered ZrO2/organic nanostructures. They deposited dense ZrO2/organic nanolayers on Si wafers in a 3:3 proportion of ZrO2:organic, and an average thickness of 50 nm and 11 nm, for the ZrO2 and organic layers, respectively. The organic layers were deposited by using the LbL technique using alternating poly(styrenesulfonate) sodium salt (PSS-polyanion) and poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI – polycation) sublayers. ZrO2 layers were deposited on the LbL organic films using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering from a ZrO2 target. The fabricated layered nanostructures were characterized by TEM, XRD, nanoindentation and finite element (FE) simulations.
The ZrO2 bulk and ZrO2/organic multilayers exhibited different nanoindentation behavior. The indentation depth of the ZrO2/organic multilayer sample was twice that of the ZrO2 bulk sample at a maximum load of ∼300 μN. This suggested that the ZrO2/organic multilayer structure was softer than the bulk ZrO2. The elastic modulus and hardness values of the pure ZrO2 and ZrO2/organic multilayer films are E = 138 ± 2 GPa, H = 11.2 ± 0.1 GPa and E = 86 ± 5 GPa, H = 5.5 ± 0.3 GPa, respectively.68 On the other hand, the scratch tests demonstrate the high toughness of the nanolayered structure on ZrO2/organic multilayers compared to that of pure ZrO2.68 Further investigations of the toughening mechanisms that originate from different nanolayered structures of higher complexity are needed for adoption in engineering applications.
3.3. ZnO-based layered organic–inorganic nanostructures
ZnO ALD has been combined with zincone MLD to form a ZnO/zincone nanolayer. The nanolayer was expected to increase the electrical conductivity due to an electron band overlap between the π-electrons of the hydroquinone (HQ) ring and ZnO.69,70 Zincone MLD films can be fabricated by using diethyl zinc (DEZ) as a zinc metal precursor and HQ as an aromatic organic molecule.70,71 The 1:1, 1:3 and 2:2 ZnO/zincone nanolayers demonstrated higher electrical conductivity than pure ZnO films (with σ = 14 S cm−1), i.e., σ = 116 S cm−1 for 1:1, σ = 40 S cm−1 for 1:3 and σ = 170 S cm−1 for 2:2. Although the 1:5 and 5:5 ZnO/zincone nanolayers presented lower conductivity than pure ZnO films, i.e., σ = 6 S cm−1 for 1:5 and σ = 13 S cm−1 for 5:5. This range of electrical conductivity for ZnO/zincone nanolayers is comparable to that of the Al-doped ZnO thin films.72,73 These results demonstrated that ZnO/zincone nanolayers can be fabricated with high electrical conductivity and may be potential candidates to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) and have applications for flexible and conducting thin films in displays.11
Liu et al.74 fabricated layered organic–inorganic nanostructures using the (DEZ/H2O)/(DEZ/HQ), ALD/MLD and investigated the thermal conductivity of the 1:1 nanolayer. DEZ can react with aliphatic organic diols, i.e., EG or aromatic organic diols, i.e., HQ. The first reaction gives “type A” and the second one gives “type B” MLD zincone films (Fig. 7a). Furthermore, ZnO can be deposited by the ALD technique with DEZ and H2O (as a reactant). Then, the “type C” ALD/MLD nanolayer may be fabricated by sequential layering of ZnO ALD and zincone MLD (Fig. 7a). The ratio of DEZ/H2O is 1:1 and the sequence of DEZ/HQ is 1:1. The MLD cycles (DEZ/HQ section) for the “type C” deposition of the (DEZ/H2O)/(DEZ/HQ) nanolayer are the same as those for the “type B” deposition of MLD zincone films. However, the additive ALD cycles (DEZ/H2O section) dramatically change the atomic configuration of the “type C” ALD/MLD nanolayer. Furthermore, HQ in the MLD cycle can react with both the DEZ in the ALD and MLD cycles during the growth of the “type C” ALD/MLD nanolayer. This results in a much denser film compared to the “type B” MLD zincone film, as well as much lower average growth rate.74

The incoherent interatomic/molecular bonding and mass difference across organic molecules and inorganic atoms in the ALD/MLD zincone nanolayer can significantly hinder the phonon transport. Hence, the thermal conductivity of the zincone nanolayer is lower than its organic and inorganic counterparts (Fig. 7b).75–77 Therefore, such an ALD/MLD hybrid organic–inorganic nanolayer can find its uses as a high-efficient thermoelectric material due to its low thermal conductivity.78–80 The obtained thermal conductivity value is in the range of 0.13–0.38 W mK−1 for ALD/MLD zincone nanolayers.74 This thermal conductivity value is much lower than that of the W/Al2O3 nanolayer which is in the range of 0.6–1.5 W mK−1.78
3.4. LiTP-based layered organic–inorganic nanostructures
Crystalline organic LiTP ALD/MLD was combined with lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) ALD to form a LiTP/LiPON thin film.81 This high-quality electroactive nanolayer was prepared for use as an anode in high rate lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The Li(thd) (thd = 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate) and terephthalic acid (benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) precursors were selected to fabricate LiTP nanolayers using an ALD/MLD process (Fig. 8a).81 The LiTP film growth per cycle (GPC), film density and thickness versus precursor pulse length (time that precursor was pulsed into the vacuum chamber), and temperature were studied with respect to the ALD fabrication cycles (Fig. 8b). The results indicated that the growth rate of LiTP was ∼3.0 Å per cycle at 200 °C.
 Fig. 8  (a) A schematic indicating the growth of LiTP nanolayers using the ALD/MLD technique. (b): (i) GPC of LiTP nanolayers as a function of Li(thd) (black dots) and terephthalic acid (red dots) pulse lengths. The deposition temperature was 200 °C and the pulse/purge lengths of the other precursor were fixed to 4 s/4 s for Li(thd) and to 10 s/30 s for terephthalic acid. (ii) GPC (black dots) and film density (red dots) of LiTP as a function of deposition temperature. The pulse/purge lengths were 4 s/4 s and 10 s/30 s for Li(thd) and terephthalic acid, respectively. (iii) Film thickness (black dots) and density (red dots) of LiTP versus the number of deposition cycles. The deposition temperature was 200 °C and the pulse/purge lengths were 4 s/4 s and 10 s/30 s for Li(thd) and terephthalic acid, respectively. (c): (i) Rate capability of bare LiTP (black dots) and LiTP/LiPON (red dots) as distinguished from the charge capacity. Discharge curves at different current rates for (ii) LiTP and (iii) LiTP/LiPON.

(d) Nyquist plots of the EIS evaluations for LiTP (black dots) and LiTP/LiPON (red dots). (e) The cycle life of LiTP/LiPON evaluated at current rates of 3.2 and 6.4C. Reproduced with permission from data published in ref. 81, Copyright 2016, The American Chemical Society. 
The rate capability and electrochemical performance of the LiTP ALD/MLD nanolayers were tested by cyclic scanning of the electrodes at various current rates. Fig. 8c and d indicate that the performance of the LiTP ALD/MLD electrode could be further increased when it was covered by a thin protective LiPON ALD solid-state electrolyte layer. The cycle life of LiTP/LiPON thin films was measured at current rates of 3.2 and 6.4C (Fig. 8e). The cycle life outcomes demonstrate that the LiPON protective layer can stabilize the LiTP electrodes, even in LiPF6 (lithium hexafluorophosphate)-based liquid electrolytes.81 The LiTP/LiPON structure provided a capacity retention of up to 97% after 200 charge/discharge cycles at 3.2C (Fig. 8e). The findings over LiTP and LiTP/LiPON thin films for LIBs indicate that a higher specific energy can be obtained in such materials compared to the other electrode thin films such as TiO2 and Li4Ti5O12.82,83 Additionally, according to Zhang et al.,84 the volume transformation of LiTP through de-lithiation is 6%, which is moderately small. Therefore, the LiTP/LiPON nanolayer and its alloy films are good candidates for flexible energy storage devices.
4. Current applications of 2D layered organic–inorganic heterostructures
4.1. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
The miniaturization of LIB components (i.e., anode materials, separators and electrolytes) to scale down the LIB dimension size, as well as to embed improved energy density, cycle life and high rate capability for portable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles, is an increasing demand.82,85 Within this context, efforts have been made to search for anode and separator materials for LIBs.85,86Table 2 summarizes the properties of some well-known nanostructured materials for anode and membrane separators in LIBs. Among them, layered organic–inorganic hybrids possess diverse attractive features compared to the transition-metal based organic compounds.86,87

An ideal organic component of a layered organic–inorganic hybrid material should be (i) low-cost and (ii) environmentally friendly, and possess (iii) light elements and (iv) theoretical specific capacities in the order of several hundred milliampere hour per gram, mA h g−1.81 In addition, redox properties could be tuned by increasing the electron donating/retracting functional groups.81 So far, a few advanced deposition techniques such as LbL self-assembly, ALD, MLD, and in situ pyrolysis, have been successfully employed to fabricate organic–inorganic functional structures to be used as high-performance anodes and separators for LIBs.1,126,127
Long et al.1 have demonstrated the creation of a layered network structure of Fe3O4 (iron (II,III) oxide) nanoplates and carbon nanosheets (Fe3O4-NPs@C) (Fig. 9a) which provided a high reversible capacity of 1180 mA h g−1 and a high current density of 100 mA g−1. Among transition metal oxides, Fe3O4 is one of the most promising candidates that can be used as anodes due to its low cost and high theoretical capacity (924 mA h g−1), density (5.17 g cm−3) and availability.128,129 Nevertheless, Fe3O4 based anodes present low capacity and cycle life performances due to their low electrical conductivity and high volume transformation (93%).1 These deficiencies were addressed by Long et al. who fabricated a high-performance LIB anode using a porous Fe3O4-NPs@C composite, which was synthesized using in situ pyrolysis of inexpensive layered organic–inorganic precursors.1 The success of the synthesis of a Fe3O4-NPs@C porous network structure was based on the character of the layered organic–inorganic hybrid and the evolved gases during the decomposition of precursors. The microstructural analysis of the fabricated Fe3O4-NPs@C porous film revealed that the 3D carbon network was full of irregular voids, which were surrounded by 2D graphitic carbon thin films. The Fe3O4 nanoplates of polygonal shape were anchored/embedded in the carbon matrix homogeneously. This unique structure revealed excellent capacity, efficiency (high capacity in large cycle numbers) and cycling performance in comparison with pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. 9b and c).

A separator within a LIB plays an essential role in its safety performance because of its close proximity within the electrolyte. Therefore, in the same fashion as the anode of a LIB, the separator requires further development. The main purpose of a separator in a LIB is to separate positive and negative electrodes to eliminate any electrical short circuit and at the same time permit rapid transportation of Li-ions (Li+) without allowing electrons to pass. Hence, a separator is expected to exhibit (i) a large Li+ transference number, (ii) electrolyte uptake, (iii) electrolyte wettability and (iv) a large ionic conductivity.127 For this aim, Xu et al.127 synthesized a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)/ZrO2 modified polyethylene (PE) separator. A simple LbL self-assembly technique was employed to functionalize the surface of a commercial PE with an organic–inorganic hybrid thin film consisting of PAA and ZrO2, as shown in Fig. 10a. The LbL self-assembly technique provided a very dilute coating. The coating also did not sacrifice the porous structure of the final separator. These are two advantage factors in a separator that can be protected by LbL self-assembly.127

(b) Comparison of discharge and C-rate capacities with various discharge current densities (voltage range between 3.0 and 4. V).

The physical and electrochemical properties, and the performance of Li+ half-cells of the coated PPA/ZrO2 LbL-modified PE were also investigated. The discharge capacity and Nyquist plots of the LiCoO2/Li half-cell assembled with pristine PE and either (i) (PAA/ZrO2)1PAA-modified PE or (ii) (PAA/ZrO2)3-modified PE are displayed in Fig. 10b and c. It is observed that the LiCoO2/Li half-cell assembled with (PAA/ZrO2)1PAA-modified PE and (PAA/ZrO2)3-modified PE separators presents higher discharge capacities than pristine PE upon diverse discharge current densities from 0.2 to 7C. The Nyquist plots that are used to demonstrate the system stability are contained within two semicircles and a tilted line. The results indicate that the stability of the (PAA/ZrO2)3-modified PE sample is much better than those of pristine PE and (PAA/ZrO2)1PAA-modified PE. These improved properties of the layered organic–inorganic hybrid with notable characteristics have the potential to provide superior separators for high-performance LIBs.
4.2. Supercapacitors (SCs)
Supercapacitors (SCs) with superior charge and discharge rate capabilities, great power density and long cycle life efficiency are prospective candidates for electrochemical energy-storage devices that can be engaged in portable electronic, electrical and hybrid vehicles.130–133 Typical 2D metal–organic framework (MOF) assemblies are types of organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures that consist of inorganic metal ions (or clusters) that are coordinated to organic ligands. 2D MOFs have broad porosities, however, their pure nanostructures commonly exhibit low specific capacitance because of their poor conductivity. Nevertheless, 2D MOF nanostructures are often incorporated with other conductive components including graphene and conductive polymers to fabricate high conductivity 2D hybrid composites. This functionalization has developed into a new technique to enhance specific capacitance and energy density within a SC. Within this context, Xia et al.134 implemented a nitrogen (N)-doped graphene aerogel (NG-A) approach to fabricate metal oxide nanoparticles from a bulk cobalt-based MOF [Co(mIM)2 (mIM = 2-methylimidazole)], see Fig. 11a and b. The structure served as a robust platinum free electrocatalyst with an excellent catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline electrolyte solution. Additionally, when cobalt was eliminated through the structure; the aerogel composite of N-rich porous carbon–graphene displayed extraordinary energy storage with an exceptional capacitance, rate capability and an energy density of ∼40 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼103 W kg−1 in a SC (Fig. 11c). This novel strategy can furnish a method for manufacturing sophisticated 2D layered nanostructures from MOFs. In addition, this technique might deliver a new pathway for fabricating high-efficiency electrochemical components that satisfy both energy storage and energy conversion devices from a single MOF/NG-A derived nanostructure.

Another interesting work by Cao et al.135 used a 2D porphyrin paddlewheel framework-3 (PPF-3) of MOF nanosheets as a precursor to fabricate a 2D nanocomposite that included CoS1.097 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon (CoSNC). Preparation of layered organic–inorganic nanostructures by integrating high-quality 2D MOF nanosheets with other inorganic components such as noble metals136 and metal sulfides137 is an effective route to develop multifunctional composites that have novel and remarkable properties when compared to the individual components.138 Significantly, the synergetic effect due to the interactions between each component and layer can lead to performance enhancement comparable to the single elements.
In order to synthesize 2D CoSNC nanocomposites, 2D PPF-3 nanosheets were fabricated using a surfactant-assisted synthetic method.139 The schematic fabrication and microstructures of 2D PPF-3 nanosheets with specific thickness (42.7 ± 8.4 nm) are presented in Fig. 12a. Following this, the 2D CoSNC nanocomposites were acquired from the conversion of 2D PPF-3 nanosheets through the simultaneous sulfidation and carbonization procedure (Fig. 12b). The AFM image shows that the 2D CoSNC nanocomposites have a thickness of 24.5 ± 6.4 nm. The current density, potential, specific capacitance and capacitance retention of the obtained nanocomposites were examined to measure and compare the SC properties of 2D CoSNC nanocomposites with the bulk structure (Fig. 12c). The results indicated the high capacitance, high rate and long cycle life performances of the 2D CoSNC nanocomposites. Hence, this work demonstrates that the 2D MOF organic–inorganic nanosheet composites can be used to construct a variety of 2D functional layered organic–inorganic nanomaterials because of their distinctive structure, functionalizable nature and outstanding properties.

4.3. Water splitting
Water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts is one of the green and sustainable technologies for the generation of hydrogen as clean energy.140 Implementation of 2D layered components in the field of photocatalysis has driven certain interest and has quickly grown to be one of several most desirable research topics.141,142 The fabrication of 2D layered composite photocatalysts can create numerous distinctive properties that usually may not be found in other types of photocatalysts, which are valuable and effective for photocatalytic efficiency advancement.143 For instance, graphene (or reduced graphene oxide) exhibits massive charge transportation properties, which is frequently incorporated with other inorganic materials such as transition metal oxides for photocatalytic and photo conversion application in renewable energy.144,145 Therefore, 2D layered composite nanostructures have various extraordinary benefits that favor photocatalytic applications such as (i) a large surface-to-volume ratio which is able to provide a massive number of active sites on the surface to substantially boost the photocatalytic activity.146,147 (ii) Some 2D layered materials, for instance, graphene, possess excellent conductivity and outstanding electron mobility because of the π-conjugated framework. This can supply an ultrafast electron transfer platform to facilitate the splitting up of photogenerated electrons and holes within the photocatalyst.148,149 (iii) 2D layered materials with nano-size structures possess great catalyst activities, which are effective for catalyst dispersion. Additionally, the coupling of diverse 2D layered materials or nanoparticles/2D nanosheets will significantly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of the 2D combined materials because of an enhanced contact surface and effective interfacial charge transfer.140,150 The interfacial bonding strength of the coupled nanostructures could also be improved, resulting in more stable structures.151,152
Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been identified as the most stable allotrope of C3N4 with great photo-reactivity under ambient conditions.153 g-C3N4 has a stacking 2D layered structure like graphite with a band gap of 2.7 eV which makes it active in the visible light region.140 (Note: the visible light coverage range is between ∼1.8 and 3.1 eV, or ∼390 and 700 nm.) It shows high thermal and chemical stabilities against high temperature and acidic solvents, and has been extensively investigated in the field of photocatalysis.154,155 Wang et al.156 firstly investigated g-C3N4 in the field of photocatalysis for water splitting under visible light irradiation. Subsequently, Niu et al.157 fabricated 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 2 nm using a thermal oxidation etching technique for photocatalytic hydrogen production. 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets displayed much better photocatalytic activity than their bulk structure under visible light irradiation because of (i) a higher surface area that enhanced the electron transport capability along the in-plane direction, and (ii) a larger band gap that improved the oxidation and reduction of charge carriers.140 Recently, Cai et al.158 fabricated 2D g-C3N4/N-doped La2Ti2O7 (g-C3N4/NLTO) hybrid layered nanostructures using a facile two-step hydrothermal method followed by a modified thermal oxidation etching technique (Fig. 13a).

Perovskite La2Ti2O7 (LTO) with a layered structure is an effective photocatalyst for water splitting,158 however, its photocatalytic activity is frequently confined by the poor electron mobility. This limitation can be improved by hybridizing La2Ti2O7 with other efficient photocatalysts that have excellent charge carrier transport and visible light absorption. To achieve this goal, 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of ∼2 nm were conjugated with ∼7 nm thick N-doped LTO (NLTO) nanosheets to make 2D layered g-C3N4/NLTO nanostructures (Fig. 13b). g-C3N4 and NLTO in the constructed 2D nanostructure function as the hole receptor and electron conductor, respectively (Fig. 13a). Fig. 13c displays the photocatalytic degradation and H2 evolution of the LTO, NLTO, g-C3N4/LTO and g-C3N4/NLTO 2D layered hybrid nanostructures. Investigation on the fabricated 2D layered heterostructures demonstrated that the photocatalytic activities for generation of H2via the water splitting approach under visible light and UV irradiation are attributed to the interfacial charge transfer between their components. The 2D layered hybrid nanostructure with enhanced interfacial properties makes it possible for effective charge separation in a short interfacial range and a long lifetime. The aforementioned research demonstrated a prosperous employment of low-cost g-C3N4 as an innovative visible light photocatalyst that can be used as clean energy for generating hydrogen green fuel.
4.4. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials have attracted significant interest in scientific and industrial communities due to their (i) structural diversity, (ii) low fabrication cost, (iii) promising semiconductor properties in the visible light region, (iv) high-power conversion efficiency exceeding 20% in photovoltaic (PV), and (v) environmental and photostabilities under operating situations, in comparison with other solar cells like dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) (Fig. 14a.i).159–162 Hence, solar cells based on HOIP materials have made significant development in relation to enhanced efficiency during the past few years.163 (RNH3)2MAn−1AnX3n+1 is a generic formula for the layered HOIP materials, where R is an alkyl (or aromatic moiety), MA is CH3NH3, A is a metal cation like (i.e., Pb2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, etc.) and X is a halide (i.e., chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine(I)).160 The variable n index demonstrates the number of metal cation layers between the organic chain layers.164,165 Therefore, the different value of n can be modulated to tune the thickness of the layered HOIP as well as its optoelectronic properties. The structure of the layered HOIP turns into a 3D perovskite crystal when n = ∞, like traditional BaTiO3 (barium titanate). Likewise, when n = 1 then the structure becomes an ideal quantum well with just one atomic layer of AX42− divided by organic chains.160 The schematic in Fig. 14a.ii demonstrates the crystal structure of the 2D layered n-butylammonium (BA) lead iodide perovskite phase, (BA)2MA3Pb4I13 (n = 4), which belongs to Ruddlesden–Popper phase's family.162 The layered 2D perovskite films of Ruddlesden–Popper phases have desirable stability; however, they have presented a poor efficiency of only 4.73% when they are used for solar cells.166,167 This reasonably weak efficiency could be due to the blockage of out-of-plane charge transfer through the organic cations that behave similarly to an isolation space layer between the inorganic conductor sections.162 Therefore, in order to enhance effective charge transfer in layered perovskites and thus their efficiency, so far, researchers have focused on developing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite thin films that are close to atomically thick quality.160,162 Within this context, Dou et al.160 fabricated uniform square shape and large sized (C4H9NH3+)2PbBr42− 2D hybrid perovskites and their derivatives with approximately 4 nm thickness, using a solution-processing method (Fig. 14b). The 2D HOIP nanosheets grew on the surface of a flat Si/SiO2 substrate using a very dilute solution, followed by crystallization with mild heating and evaporation of solvent. The applied solution-processing method could overcome the limitations of the exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition techniques. The limitations typically lead to non-uniform (shape and thickness) plates. These non-uniform structures possibly influence their functions and applications.168,169 The fabricated 2D HOIP nanosheets are versatile and deformable. Despite their bulk structure, the 2D nanosheets demonstrate novel features including an unusual structural relaxation (lattice constant expansion), a photoluminescence (PL) shift and color tuning (Fig. 14b). This study on atomically thin 2D HOIP can provide a new avenue for substantial research on the synthesis and characterization of other perovskites.170,171 It can also demonstrate a new class of 2D semiconductors that can be synthesized by a solution-processing method for nanoscale optoelectronic instruments.172,173

A previous study by Dou et al.160 reported the deposition of 2D HOIP nanosheets on a flat Si/SiO2 substrate by the solution-processing wet-chemical method. However, the support substrate may limit some applications of 2D HOIP nanosheets. To overcome this issue, Yang et al.174 recently employed a facile and quick crystallization technique to synthesise a superior stable free-standing phenylethylammonium lead halide [(C8H9NH3+)2PbX42−, X = Cl, Br and I], at ambient temperature. Fig. 14c.i displays a schematic of the fabrication of single-layer (C8H9NH3+)2PbI4 nanosheets. The green arrows in the image show the interactions of C8H9NH3+ cations with solvent molecules and red bars indicate the interactions of C8H9NH3+ cations with the PbI4 platform. Fig. 14c.ii shows a typical Tyndall effect of solution after 10 minutes of mixing when a red laser irradiates on it. (Note: The Tyndall effect is light scattering by particles inside colloid or other debris in an extremely fine suspension.) Fig. 14c.iii shows the photoluminescence of (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− nanosheets in toluene. SEM, AFM, TEM, STEM and STEM-EDS images of the single-layer (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− are presented in Fig. 14c.iv–vii. It can be observed that the average lateral size and thickness of the synthesized 2D (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− nanosheets are 531 ± 62 nm and 2.0 ± 0.1 nm, respectively. Notably, the lateral size could be tuned by changing the solvents.174 According to the theoretical studies by Calabrese175 and Kikuchi,176 the interlayer distance in bulk (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− crystals is 1.64 nm. The obtained thickness clearly illustrates that single-layers of (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− nanosheets were formed by the solution-processing method. The PL spectra of (C8H9NH3+)2PbX42− nanosheets (X = Cl, Br and I) with different compositions (Fig. 14c.viii and ix) suggest that they have bright, spectrally narrow, highly efficient and tunable photoluminescence properties. Additionally, the single-layer (C8H9NH3+)2PbI42− nanosheets demonstrated better stability in ambient situations and greater light emission in comparison with the traditional 3D perovskites.174,177 The main potential applications of the synthesized 2D free-standing phenylethylammonium lead halide nanosheets could be in high-efficiency solar cells and photodetectors.
4.5. Thermoelectric devices
Thermoelectric systems are devices that generate electrical energy from heat. They are made of a type of semiconducting thermoelectric material and their energy conversion efficiency can be enhanced by improving their thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT).178ZT = (S2σT)κ−1, where S, σ, T and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature and thermal conductivity, respectively. The thermal conductivity κ is frequently demonstrated as κ = κp + κe, where κp and κe illustrate the phonon and electronic contributions, respectively. S2σ also reflects the power factor.82 The main barrier to feasible thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency is the failure to individually manipulate the σ and κ properties of the regular semiconductor materials because charge carrier density and mobility of the common inorganic thermoelectrics are generally interlocked with thermal transport and thermopower.5 Thus, increasing σ is usually associated with increasing κ. This phenomenon is an issue for increasing ZT and hence, thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency. To overcome this issue, organic materials such as conducting polymers have also been considered for thermoelectric applications because of their reasonably low thermal conductivity.179 However, the S value of organic materials is relatively lower than that of inorganic materials,5 which is a drawback for ZT. Hence, a great promising category of materials that has been emerging for thermoelectric applications is that of 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid materials.5,180,181 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid materials could improve the performance of thermoelectric materials because their thermal conductivity may well be suppressed without limiting the electrical transport properties.182,183 Ultrathin layered materials consisting of organic–inorganic superlattices have been used as flexible thermoelectric materials for high-efficiency power generation.178,182,183 The 2D layered structures could block phonon transport (κp) by interfacial coupling and scattering effects without negatively affecting the electrical properties.182,183
Intercalation is a chemical technique to reversibly incorporate guest species; ranging from ions, atoms or molecules, inside a crystal gap.180 2D layered materials usually possess strong in-plane covalent bonding but weak out-of-plane van der Waals interactions through the interlayer gap (Fig. 15a).184 Therefore, intercalation could be a possible way to insert organic molecules as guests in between the 2D layers to perturb phonon propagation and reduce κp.
 Fig. 15  (a) A schematic illustrating intercalation in the layered TMD materials, where guest species can be inserted into the van der Waals gap by different techniques. (b) A schematic displaying the fabrication of TiS2-based organic–inorganic superlattices. Initially, 2D layered TiS2 intercalated into a [(HA)x(DMSO)y] superlattice via an electrochemical approach, where a bilayer structure of the HA ions was formed due to DMSO stabilization. Subsequently, the [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z]–TiS2 layered hybrid superlattice was formed using the solvent exchange process after immersion in water, where the HA ions shift to a monolayer configuration. (c) HAADF-STEM characterization of the [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z]–TiS2 hybrid nanostructure indicating a wavy frame. (d) ZT value of the TiS2 single crystal and [(HA)0.08(H2O)0.22(DMSO)0.03]–TiS2 hybrid, respectively. Reproduced with permission from data published in ref. 182, Copyright 2015, Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Materials. 
Wan et al.182 implemented an electrochemical intercalation procedure to fabricate a 2D [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z]–TiS2 (HA = hexylammonium) layered hybrid superlattice (Fig. 15b), where polar organic molecules of [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z] were intercalated inside 2D layered TMDs of TiS2, driven by Coulomb force.182Fig. 15c displays the HAADF-STEM images of the layers in the fabricated 2D layered hybrid superlattice. It can be clearly seen that the formed layers have a wavy structure because the inorganic nanolayers tend to roll up and form nanotubes under specific developing treatments.182 The thermal conductivity obtained from the equilibrium molecular dynamic simulation studies is less than the experimental results.182 The lower simulated thermal conductivity could be due to their wavy layer structures that deliver an additional mechanism for minimizing the thermal conductivity of the 2D layered organic–inorganic structures.
The ZT values of the TiS2 single crystal and [(HA)0.08(H2O)0.22(DMSO)0.03]–TiS2 are exhibited in Fig. 15d. The ZT value at 373 K for the organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructure is 0.28, which is the highest value of n-type flexible composites. It is a challenge to achieve high values of ZT for n-type doped organic semiconductors because of their low electron affinity.182 The ZT value in the layered n-type structure is almost close to that of the most promising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) p-type organic material (highest ZT of 0.42).183 The ideal choices of organic molecules and inorganic materials with diverse sizes and functional groups could deliver strategies to improve the thermoelectric efficiency.
5. Challenges of 2D layered organic–inorganic heterostructures
2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures that can be employed as versatile platforms for the exploration of different phenomena at the nanoscale are still at the starting stage. 2D nanostructures can provide unusual physical, chemical and mechanical properties to the system. Many opportunities exist in this research area, especially with growing demands for high-performance clean energy devices. In a 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructure that was synthesized by combined ALD/MLD processes, organic molecules are covalently bonded to the inorganic metal atoms to form a periodic thin-film structure.20 The fabricated 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructures may possess properties combined from those of the two parent materials. The hybrid nanostructures may also have some other brand-new properties. By combining different inorganic, organic and hybrid layers into one thin film and superstructure, it is possible to further tune the material properties. For instance, accurate control of the refractive index in optical applications,185 control of the electrical properties and non-volatile memories for storage capacitors and for transparent thin-film transistors,186,187 and tunability of the surface roughness in gas sensors,188 as well as tuning the bandgap of the 2D hybrid perovskites in the range of visible light to achieve high photovoltaic efficiency have been achieved.189
The practical applications of organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposites for clean energy require solutions that are related to the material processing, such as the restacking problem of 2D materials. For instance, wet-chemical methods are usually used to synthesize 2D layered organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites by directly spreading the diluted precursor solution onto smooth substrates, along with crystallization upon solvent evaporation.160 However, it should be noted that inorganic nanosheets have a tendency to become either (i) re-stacked and agglomerated in solvents, or (ii) roll up and form nanotubes under certain treatment,190 which decreases the effective surface area. This drawback can be overcome by using strategies such as surfactants to modify the surface of nanosheets for homogeneous dispersion. It is also feasible to create porous structures by removing the organic parts from the organic–inorganic hybrid films using traditional annealing or wet-etching procedures.191,192 The porous structures are suitable for use in optics, electronics and catalysis. The fabrication of an efficient energy storage or conversion device is carried out by depositing or transferring the 2D organic–inorganic hybrid nanostructure onto an electronically conducting substrate.
Another challenge in electronic devices is how to strongly attach or bind layered nanosheets onto electrode/conducting frameworks to create efficient interfaces for facile charge transport. Based on the nature of the electrode and hybrid nanosheets, a variety of electrode treatment methods such as self-assembled monolayer modification and hydrogen/nitrogen/plasma treatments are typically implemented for better attaching nanosheets onto electrodes.193 The result is that charge carriers migrate quite easily through interfaces toward electrodes. On the other hand, because of the low conductivity of organic materials in the 2D layered organic–inorganic nanostructure, fewer charge carriers reach the electrodes. This could possibly be resolved by using an appropriate dopant especially surfactant and metal nanostructures such as graphene, gold, platinum, and silver that may facilitate charge movement towards electrodes. Furthermore, toxic elements, for example lead in 2D BA2PbBr4 (BA = C4H9NH3+, butylammonium ion) hybrid perovskite semiconductors, have detrimental effects for the environmental as well as health concerns.161 Thus, further studies are required; even on fundamental studies concerning the precise growth mechanisms of new types of thin films. Fundamental studies provide insights for the selection of complementary precursor combinations.
Recently, it has been indicated that periodically repeating organic layers inserted within thicker inorganic layers can block heat conduction.178 In another study, it has been shown that lead-free 2D BA2SnI4 and BA2GeI4 perovskites exhibited bandgaps of 1.45 and 1.74 eV, respectively.161 These results are encouraging for developing high-efficiency clean energy devices such as thermoelectrics and PSCs. 2D layered organic–inorganic nanostructures could also enhance the gas barrier coatings on biopolymer materials.20 Furthermore, they have potential for application in environmental monitoring; however, selectivity remains a significant concern. Thus, advancement of optimized target-analyte-specific hybrid nanostructures is required. Research and modifications designed for the interface between inorganic host materials and guest organic nanosheets are essential for the performance of hybrid nanostructures. Thus, the science of interfaces requires more clarity and knowledge.
6. Conclusions and prospects
This review presents recent research activities in the field of 2D layered organic–inorganic heteronanostructures. Details of the synthesis procedure, structural design, tunable properties, challenges and their applications in the state-of-the-art devices have been summarized. The 2D layered organic–inorganic nanostructures are an emerging research topic. Therefore, research has been directed towards the design and synthesis of new ultrathin 2D hybrid structures with tunable components and properties. Generally, the inorganic component can provide favorable mechanical, chemical, electrical and optical properties, while the organic component can, in addition, provide flexibility, reduced density and lower cost. Hybrid organic–inorganic thin films were then demonstrated to show great promise in advanced clean energy fields such as energy storage and conversion devices, flexible transparent conducting displays,70,71 solar cell applications,194,195 flexible electrical and optical thin film devices,196,197 catalysis,198,199 gas sensors200,201 and gas diffusion barriers.202,203
Progress has been made in the area of 2D layered hybrid organic–inorganic nanostructures by fabricating metal alkoxide films, as illustrated by “metalcones”, using MLD/ALD techniques. For instance, it has been demonstrated that hybrid organic–inorganic multilayers can efficiently block heat conduction and create ultralow thermal conductivity that is significant in the field of thermoelectrics.74 It is anticipated that MLD/ALD techniques provide a fashionable and versatile method to fabricate new materials and devices in a controlled and industrially feasible way.178 Hence, the current and future 2D layered organic–inorganic nanostructures will require continued investigation and identification for specific applications. With many efforts on the fabrication of 2D layered nanostructures on solid substrates, researchers have explored the synthesis of free-standing 2D organic–inorganic nanostructures. However, the application of free-standing 2D nanostructures may have been limited because of the less control over their geometric and surface properties. There is no doubt that the advancement of 2D layered organic–inorganic nanomaterials still encounters a range of challenges, such as (i) better understanding of the surface, structural disorder and structure–property relationships to anticipate the functionality of the resulting 2D hybrid organic–inorganic nanostructures and (ii) exploration of a simple and inexpensive process for large-scale industrial manufacturing. Overcoming these obstacles will help deliver 2D layered nanostructures with great potential for applications in advanced clean energy, nanoelectronics, sensing, catalysis and other related areas.

 	Fig. 15  (a) A schematic illustrating intercalation in the layered TMD materials, where guest species can be inserted into the van der Waals gap by different techniques. (b) A schematic displaying the fabrication of TiS2-based organic–inorganic superlattices. Initially, 2D layered TiS2 intercalated into a [(HA)x(DMSO)y] superlattice via an electrochemical approach, where a bilayer structure of the HA ions was formed due to DMSO stabilization. Subsequently, the [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z]–TiS2 layered hybrid superlattice was formed using the solvent exchange process after immersion in water, where the HA ions shift to a monolayer configuration. (c) HAADF-STEM characterization of the [(HA)x(H2O)y(DMSO)z]–TiS2 hybrid nanostructure indicating a wavy frame. (d) ZT value of the TiS2 single crystal and [(HA)0.08(H2O)0.22(DMSO)0.03]–TiS2 hybrid, respectively.
