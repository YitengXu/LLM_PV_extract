    , Accepted 27th April 2017First published on 10th May 2017AbstractUnderstanding the influence of external loads on the degradation behavior of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is highly important for gaining deep insight into the degradation mechanism of PSCs, as well as for establishing standard stability test protocols for PSCs. In this paper, the degradation behavior of inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells operated under different external load conditions were investigated. External load-dependent “burn-in” performance decays were demonstrated, i.e., devices degrade much faster in the open-circuit state than in the short-circuit state, where the short-circuit current (JSC) loss was found to dominate the decay in performance and is the parameter that is most sensitive to the load conditions. The device performance of aged cells maintained 84% of the initial value after thermal annealing, regardless of the load conditions during aging, demonstrating that the external load-dependent performance decay of the P3HT:PC61BM cells is partially reversible. Analyzing the light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage (VOC) characteristics and dark-current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the aged devices revealed that trap-assisted charge recombination increased in the aged devices. The appearance of PC61BM dimers was confirmed by analyzing the products of the blend film after light illumination, which is ascribed to the main reason for the “burn-in” performance decay. The faster formation of PC61BM dimers is directly correlated to a higher exciton concentration within the photoactive layer when the device is operated under higher load conditions, which explains the external load dependence of the performance decay. In addition to the formation of PC61BM dimers, formation of PC61BM clusters that leads to the nanomorphology changes during aging was ascribed to the second reason for the performance decay, which is external load independent and thermal irreversible. By blending the P3HT:PC61BM photoactive layer with piperazine, a triplet quencher for fullerene molecules, the external load-dependent “burn-in” loss was fully suppressed, which unambiguously confirms that the initial “burn-in” loss in P3HT:PC61BM solar cells is related to the PC61BM excited state. The present work not only clearly demonstrates the behavior and mechanism for the external load-dependent degradation of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells but also provides an effective way to improve the device stability.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted increasing attentions in the last few years, owing to their advantages of mechanical flexibility, light weight and potential low-cost mass production.1,2 Recent advances in materials development and device structure optimization have led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more 11%,3–8 demonstrating their excellent application prospects. In addition to the necessary high PCE, long-term stability has become the next key challenge before the commercialization of PSCs can be realized.9–12 Although lifetimes of a few years have been reported in the literature,13 the statistical data show that reliable PSC lifetimes are within a few months at the current stage, which is far from satisfactory.10 Understanding the degradation mechanism is therefore still highly needed to further improve the operation lifetime of PSCs.
Recent studies on the degradation of solution-processed PSCs have shown that most polymer cells suffer from an initial fast performance decay and a subsequent slow and linear degradation process.12–15 The initial fast performance loss, called the “burn-in” loss, can decrease the PCE to 20–50% within a hundred hours, which leads to a serious reduction of the lifetime and the consequent total power output of the PSC. A comparison between the degradation behavior of P3HT:PC61BM and PCDTBT:PC61BM proved that the burn-in degradation process is related to a photochemical reaction involving the photoactive layer, which leads to a broadening of the density of states and to a fast decay in the open-circuit voltage (VOC).14,16 This VOC loss can be suppressed by increasing the crystallinity of the polymers.17 On the other hand, the photoinduced dimerization of fullerene molecules in the photoactive layer has been proposed to be another important degradation pathway for PSCs.18–20 A very detailed study by Brabec et al. confirmed that the fullerene photodimerization yield is highly dependent on the morphology and electric field of the photoactive layer, which is in good agreement with the JSC decay of PSCs.20
In real applications, solar cells are typically operated under load conditions to match the maximum power output point (mpp). Therefore, to more accurately understand the degradation behavior of PSCs and to estimate the lifetime of PSCs under the operation conditions, it is highly recommended to determine the device performance output under an external load that matches the mpp point under continuous light illumination.21 However, no systemic investigation has been performed on the external load-dependent degradation behavior of PSCs yet. Most PSC stability test results reported in the literature were conducted either in the dark (shelf-life time)22 or at open circuit (VOC) under illumination,14,23 and rather limited research group reported stability tests of PSCs under mpp conditions.13,24–30 Understanding the effect of an external load on the degradation behavior of PSCs is therefore highly interesting, since this, on one hand, will provide useful guidelines for establishing standard stability test protocols for PSCs and, on the other hand, will enhance the understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanism in PSCs. Very recently, Brabec et al. reported that the JSC decay is much faster in polymer:fullerene solar cells under open-circuit conditions than under short-circuit conditions.20 This indicates that the decay in the polymer solar cell performance may be external load dependent. However, no detailed investigation on the influence of external load on the degradation behavior of PSCs was provided in that report.
Here, we report detailed investigations on the degradation behavior of prototype inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells operated under different load conditions. A clear external load-dependent “burn-in” degradation behavior was confirmed for the P3HT:PC61BM cells, which was ascribed to the photon induced dimerization of PC61BM. This fast “burn-in” degradation was found to be partially reversible after thermal annealing. Characteristics of the aged devices, including light intensity-dependent current density–voltage (J–V) curves, dark diode properties and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, were carefully investigated to better understand the influence of the external load on the device performance. The external load dependence of the “burn-in” performance was then correlated to the exciton concentration of fullerene molecules. Based on the understanding this degradation mechanism, method to suppress the external load-dependent “burn-in” process is reported, which, on one hand, further supports the proposed degradation mechanism, on the other hand, provides a very effective way to improve device stability.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, Mn = 5.0 × 104 g mol−1, PDI = 1.7, regioregularity Rr = 95%) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from Solarmer Energy, Inc. (Beijing) and Solenne B.V., respectively. Piperazine was purchased from J&K China Chemical Co. Ltd. ZnO colloidal particles were prepared through the reaction of KOH and Zn(OAc)2 in methanol solvent as reported by Beek et al.31 All materials were used as received.
2.2 Solar cell fabrication
The devices were fabricated on patterned ITO glass (Shenzhen Southern China City Hunan Technology Co. Ltd.). The substrates were sequentially sonically cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, and finally treated in a UV-ozone oven for 30 min. First, filtered ZnO (10 mg mL−1 in acetone) was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the samples were annealed at 120 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. A blend solution of P3HT and fullerene derivatives in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (1:1 (w/w), 40 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the top of the ZnO layer at 600 rpm for 60 s. The wet P3HT:PC61BM blend films were then put into covered Petri dishes for 1.5 hours. The samples were subsequently heated at 120 °C for 10 min. Finally, MoO3 (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially vacuum-deposited on the top of the active layer as the hole-extraction layer and the anode, respectively. The piperazine blended solar cells were fabricated according to the same method as used for the conversion cells. The size of the substrate was 2.5 × 2.5 cm2, and the effective photovoltaic area, defined by the geometrical overlap between the bottom cathode electrode and the top anode, was 0.09 cm2. Thin solid films (pure PC61BM and P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, w/w) blended films) for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis were prepared by the same method as that used for device fabrication. The prepared films were then illuminated with white LED light (D&R Light, L-W5300KA-150, Suzhou D&R Instruments, the same light source for device aging) for 50 hours. After that, the organic materials were washed out with chloroform. The obtained solution was concentrated and then analyzed with TLC (silica gel GF254) by eluting with chloroform.
2.3 Solar cell performance characterization
The PCE and light intensity dependence of the VOC and JSC values of the devices were measured in a N2-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination with simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (Verasol-2, LED 3A Sun simulator, Newport). The EQE spectra were recorded under illumination by a simulated one sun operation condition using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser. Light from a 150 W tungsten halogen lamp (Osram 64610) was used as a probe light and was modulated with a mechanical chopper before passing through the monochromator (Zolix, Omni-k300) to select the wavelength. The response was recorded as the voltage by an I–V converter (DNR-IV Convertor, Suzhou D&R Instruments), using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR 830). A calibrated Si cell was used as a reference. The device for EQE measurement was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen-filled container.
2.4 Solar cell performance decay testing
The long-term stability of un-encapsulated devices was conducted using a multi-channel solar cell performance decay test system (PVLT-G8001M, Suzhou D&R Instruments Co. Ltd.) under a testing condition in accordance with ISOS-L-1. The devices were put inside a glove box (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm), and continuously illuminated with white LED light (D&R Light, L-W5300KA-150, Suzhou D&R Instruments). The illumination light intensity was initially set so the output short-circuit current (JSC) equaled the JSC measured under standard conditions. The illumination light intensity was monitored by a photodiode (Hamamtsu S1336-8BQ). J–V curves of the devices were checked periodically, and the photovoltaic performances data (VOC, JSC, FF and mpp) were calculated automatically accordingly to the J–V results. After the J–V curve measurement, the load resistance to match the mpp point (R100) was then calculated according to the equation of R100 = Vmax/Imax, where Vmax and Imax represent the voltage and current at the mpp point. An external load was then attached to the cell according to the experimental settings. Four different aging conditions were applied in this study: at R100, at R50 (R50 = R100/2), open circuit (R = ∞), and short circuit (ideally, R = 0; in reality, R = 3–4 Ω due to the unavoidable resistance of the connection wires). The cell temperature was measured occasionally, and a temperature range of 40–45 °C was measured during aging.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 External load-dependent degradation behavior of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells

Solar cells fabrication and testing. 
In this study, inverted-structure P3HT:PC61BM solar cells were selected as model devices for their good reproducibility and reasonable stability. Fig. 1a and b depict the structure of the solar cells and the chemical structure of P3HT and PC61BM, respectively. Fig. 1c shows the J–V curves and EQE spectra (inset) of the best cells, and the statistical PCE data over 32 devices are shown Fig. 1d. As seen here, the best PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM cells was measured to be 3.55% with an open circuit (VOC) of 0.61 V, a JSC of 9.24 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63. An averaged PCE of 3.30 ± 0.12% was obtained from the cells, which is comparable to the data reported in the literature.32 The small variation in the photovoltaic performance of these cells suggests that the device fabrication processes are stable and reproducible in our lab, which are essential for solar cell stability tests, since case-by-case variation must be minimized as much as possible for this kind of study.

Degradation of P3HT:PC61BM cells under different load conditions. 
The influence of the external load on the long-term stability of the inverted P3HT:PC61BM solar cells was then systematically investigated by continuously recording the performance of the devices under different external load conditions (open circuit, R100, R50, and short circuit). The samples used in this study have a special design so that four individual solar cells are located on the same substrate (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), which should be able to further minimize case-by-case variations resulting from device fabrication processes. The four cells for the degradation test showed comparable initial device performance (Table 1). The decay curves of VOC, JSC, FF and PCE for the four cells on one substrate are shown in Fig. 2, and the decay curves averaged over four different substrates are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† For comparison, the shelf stability of the P3HT:PC61BM cell stored in the dark was also measured. As seen here, no obvious performance decay was found for the cell kept in the dark for 500 hours. In contrast, a much faster performance decay was found for cells aged under continuous light illumination. This demonstrates that light illumination accelerates the degradation process. Note that all the devices were aged inside a glovebox with low water and oxygen content, and the light source for device aging was a UV-free white LED light, so that photooxidation of the organics or electrodes could be excluded. In addition, the temperature of these cells under illumination was measured to be constant at 40–45 °C. Therefore, the fast degradation under light illumination was determined to result from light illumination, rather than thermal effects.

 Fig. 2  Evolution of the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of the inverted P3HT:PC61BM cells aged under different external load conditions. 
As seen in Fig. 2, typical “burn-in” losses were measured for the P3HT:PC61BM cells. In detail, JSC loss (35–40%) dominates the performance decay for all devices, while VOC and FF (approximately 15–20%) contribute much less to the overall PCE decay, which is in good accordance with the early findings.23 Very recently, the photoinduced dimerization of fullerene molecules within the photoactive layer was confirmed by different research groups,18–20 which was considered to be the main reason for JSC decay in organic solar cells.20 The formation of PC61BM dimers within the P3HT:PC61BM film was also confirmed in our lab by thin-layer chromatography (TLC, see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Therefore, we also ascribe the JSC decay to the formation of PC61BM dimers during aging.
Interestingly, JSC decays are found to be positively correlated to the external load attached to the device during aging, i.e., the larger the external load attached to the cell, the faster the JSC decay in the device. This is in good agreement with the results reported by Brabec et al., where JSC decays much faster when the device is aged in the open-circuit state than in the short-circuit state.20 In addition to JSC, both VOC and FF decays are also found to be external load dependent, but to a lesser extent. Overall, the PCE of the cells decayed to 51%, 47%, 43% and 40% of the initial value after aging for 500 hours under short-circuit, R50, R100, and open-circuit conditions, respectively. These results indicate that to more accurately estimate the lifetime of P3HT:PC61BM cells, it is highly recommended to test the cells with external loads matching the mpp. Otherwise, the lifetime would be underestimated if the device is tested under open-circuit conditions, while it may be overestimated if the device is tested under short-circuit conditions. On the other hand, since the open-circuit state is the simplest condition that can be achieved in the lab, testing the long-term stability of a polymer solar cell under open-circuit conditions could provide information on the minimum durability of the PSC, which is also important information concerning the stability of the PSC.

Fig. 3 depicts the J–V curves of the four cells after aging for 500 hours, measured under standard AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, where the PV performance data of the aged devices are listed in Table 1. As seen here, a large reduction in the JSC (35–45%) was found for the aged cells, whereas the VOC and FF showed rather small decays (17–20%). The external load-dependent degradation of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE can also be seen in this table, which is in good agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2.

J–V curves of the P3HT:PC61BM cells before and after aging. The four devices were on the same substrate and aged under different load conditions. The triangle line represents the aged device after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. 


Performance recovery of the aged devices by thermal annealing. 
Knowing that the fullerene dimers can be dissociated to monomers by thermal annealing.33 Therefore, it is highly interesting to see whether the “burn-in” performance decay is thermally reversible or not. Fig. 3 shows the J–V curves of the aged cells after thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min, and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 1 for comparison. As seen here, the photovoltaic performance of the aged P3HT:PC61BM cells was recovered after the thermal annealing process. A JSC of ∼7.5 mA cm−2 and a FF of ∼0.59 were measured for the aged devices after thermal annealing, which correspond to 87% and 95% recovery of the initial values, while the VOC was fully recovered to 0.61 V. Overall, the device performance was recovered to approximately 82% of the initial value (2.7% vs. 3.3%) for all devices, regardless of the aging conditions. It worth noting that the decomposition temperature for C60 dimer is around 175 °C,33 which is higher than the annealing temperature for performance recovery. This could be due to differences between the two compounds, as well as the different molecular packing environment. Nevertheless, the current results indicates that the external load-dependent performance decay is thermally reversible, which is similar to previous reports.34,35 On the other hand, the incomplete performance recovery indicates there is another degradation pathway for the P3HT:PC61BM cells, which was ascribed to the aggregation of PC61BM (vide supra).

3.2 Characteristics of the aged cells

Light intensity-dependent J–V characters of the aged cells. 
To better understand the external load dependence of the formation of PC61BM dimers, and the consequential influence of PC61BM dimers on device performance, photovoltaic behaviors of the aged devices were then investigated in detailed. The light intensity-dependent J–V characteristics of the aged devices were firstly measured. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of JSC and VOC of these cells on the light intensity, and Fig. S4 in the ESI† shows the J–V curves of the freshly prepared and aged cells measured under different light intensities. As seen in Fig. 4a, the JSC was found to be linearly correlated to the light intensity with a slope α of ∼1.0 for all devices, suggesting that bimolecular charge recombination and space charge effects are negligible for both the freshly prepared and aged cells.36,37 In addition, no difference was found for devices aged under different load conditions. This confirms that the aging process does not influence the charge transport or collection efficiency of the cells.
 Fig. 4  Light intensity dependence of the JSC and VOC of the P3HT:PC61BM devices before and after aging under different load conditions. 
The VOC, on the other hand, behaves differently for the cells before and after aging. It is known that the VOC is determined by the difference in the rates of charge generation and charge recombination.38 Therefore, analyzing the light intensity dependence of the VOC will induce charge recombination processes, since charge generation is linearly correlated to the light intensity. For ideal p–n junction solar cells, the VOC can be described by eqn (1):39 (1)where n is the ideality factor, KB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, Jph is the photon generated current, and J0 is the dark reversed saturated current. Since Jph is linearly correlated to the light intensity (Fig. 4a), a linear correlation between VOC and the logarithm of the light intensity should be expected, and the slope is equal to nKBT/q. As shown in Fig. 4b, a linear dependence of VOC on the logarithm of the light intensity was measured for all cells, and slopes of 1.25KBT/q, 1.45KBT/q, 1.54KBT/q, 1.55KBT/q and 1.69KBT/q were obtained for the pristine cell and the cells aged under short-circuit, R50, R100, and open-circuit conditions, respectively. As seen here, a small ideality factor n of 1.25 was measured for the freshly prepared cell, indicating low trap-assisted charge recombination,39,40 also called Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination,41 in the pristine cell. Higher n values of 1.45–1.69 were measured for the aged devices, indicating that formation of PC61BM dimers within the photoactive layer increased SRH recombination in the cells after aging. Not surprisingly, the n value is found to be positively correlated to the external load conditions as well. This can be understood by the fact that more PC61BM dimers formed when the device is aged at higher external load conditions, which produces more traps within the photoactive layer, and leads to more SRH recombination and consequently decreases the VOC of the device.


Diode properties of the aged devices. 
The diode properties of the aged devices were also analyzed. For an ideal p–n junction solar cell, the J–V curve can be described by the following eqn (2), according to a one-diode model:41,42 (2)where n, KB, q, T, J0, and Jph represent the physical parameters described before, while Rs and Rsh represent the series and shunt resistance, respectively. In the dark, JPH was assumed to be zero (Jph = 0). Fitting the dark J–V curve according to eqn (2) using a method reported previously43,44 provides the diode parameters of the cells. Fig. 5a depicts the semi-logarithmic J–V curves of the aged devices measured in the dark, Fig. S5 in the ESI† shows the fitting curves, and the fitted results are listed in Table 2. As seen here, n, J0, and Rs increased for the aged devices compared to the pristine cell, whereas Rsh decreased after aging. Note that all these n values obtained from the dark J–V analysis are higher than 1, which indicates that recombination in the aged cells is governed by trap-assisted recombination. In addition, the higher n value measured for the device aged under higher external load suggests that increased unwanted charge recombination is found for devices aged under high load conditions,40 which is in reasonable accordance with the results obtained from the light intensity-dependent VOC curves (Fig. 4b). According to Blom's report,39 the dark-current ideality factor n of a bulk junction solar cell is dominated by the fastest charge transporting material in the blend, which is PC61BM for the P3HT:PC61BM cells. Therefore, the increased n value for the aged devices suggested that more traps formed in the PC61BM component, which corresponds well the formation of PC61BM dimers within the photoactive layer. The lower Rsh implies higher leakage current, which may arise from increased recombination current, while the higher J0 implies the reduction in carrier lifetime in aged devices, assuming change of the charge carrier diffusion is negligible. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that the diode performance of the PSCs decreased after aging, which is also external load dependent.

EQE spectra of the aged P3HT:PC61BM cells and the formation of PC61BM clusters. 

Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the P3HT:PC61BM cells before and after aging. As seen in this figure, for the aged cells, lower EQE spectra over the whole visible-light range were measured. Such an EQE decrease was found to be external load dependent, i.e. the EQE decreased much more for cells aged under open-circuit condition than under short-circuit condition. This result corresponds well to the external load dependent JSC decay of cells. On the other hand, thermal annealing process increases the EQE of the aged cells over the whole wavelength range (Fig. S6 in ESI†), which explains the JSC recovery of the aged cells by thermal annealing. Based on the discussion above, photon induced dimerization of PC61BM that leads to the increase of defect density within the photoactive layer was ascribed to the degrease of overall EQE spectrum of aged cells, and the dissociation of PC61BM dimers was ascribed to the EQE recovery of the aged cells after thermal annealing.
On the other hand, the normalized EQE spectra clearly show an EQE increase over 350–400 nm and an EQE decrease at 550–620 nm after aging (Fig. S7a in the ESI†). These results are in good agreement with the change of the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the photoactive layers after aging, where slightly increased absorption over 350–400 nm and decreased absorption over 550–620 nm can be seen for the aged films (Fig. S7b†). The EQE and absorption bands at 550–620 nm are ascribed to the contribution of lamellar P3HT crystalline domains.45,46 Therefore, the decrease of EQE and absorption intensities over 550–620 nm indicates the decrease of crystallinity of P3HT domains, i.e. nanomorphology of the photoactive layer changes after aging. Interestingly, neither external load dependence (Fig. S7a and S7b†) nor thermal reversibility (Fig. S6†) was found for the EQE shape changes, demonstrating that nanomorphology changes of the photoactive layers should not be due to the formation of PC61BM dimers. Brabec et al. reported that formation of PC61BM dimers led to a decrease of EQE over 350–400 nm,20 further supporting the aforementioned conclusion. Knowing that formation of PC61BM clusters would increase the absorption over 350–400 nm,47–49 the EQE and UV-vis absorption results indicate the formation of PC61BM clusters during aging, which is then supposed to be reason for the decrease of crystallinity of P3HT domains and the consequent nanomorphology changes. In addition, the irreversible formation of PC61BM clusters explains also well the incomplete JSC recovery after thermal annealing (Fig. 3).
The top electrode was then removed by aqueous acid solution, and the surface morphology of the photoactive layers were measured with atomic force microscope (AFM). Fig. S8 in ESI† shows the AFM height images of P3HT:PC61BM films. The measured root mean square surface roughness (RMS) increased from 8.9 nm for the pristine P3HT:PC61BM film to 12–18 nm for the aged P3HT:PC61BM films, indicating a morphology change of the photoactive layers during aging. Interestingly, except for the device aged at open circuit state (with a RMS of 17.7 nm), no obvious surface morphology difference (with RMS around 12–13 nm) was measured for the device aged at short circuit, R100 and R50. The high RMS of the P3HT:PC61BM film aged at open circuit could be due to the large amount of PC61BM dimers aging, whereas the almost identical surface morphology of the devices aged at other three conditions indicates an insignificant external load dependence for the morphology changes. This result is in good agreement with the EQE and UV-vis absorption spectra, where no obvious external load dependence was found in the EQE and UV-vis absorption changes, demonstrating an external load independence for formation of PC61BM clusters.
Nevertheless, the EQE and UV-vis spectra as well as the AFM surface morphology results demonstrate that there are two different degradation pathways for the P3HT:PC61BM cells. One is the formation of PC61BM dimers that is thermally reversible and external load dependent, and the other one is the formation of PC61BM clusters, which is neither external load dependent, nor thermally reversible. The formation of PC61BM dimers explains the reversible and external load dependent performance decay, whereas the formation of PC61BM clusters explains the incomplete JSC recovery of the aged cells after thermal annealing (Fig. 3).

3.3 Further discussion on the degradation mechanism of the P3HT:PC61BM cells

Understanding the VOC and FF losses of the P3HT:PC61BM cells. 
The full recovery of the VOC of the aged devices after thermal annealing demonstrates that the VOC may also be related to the formation of PC61BM dimers. McGehee et al. demonstrated that in the PCPDTBT:PC71BM system, a photochemical reaction within the blend film increased the density of states (DOSs), which is thought to be the reason for the VOC decay.14,16 In the present case, the photon-induced dimerization of PC61BM may increase the disorder of the band state of the acceptors50 and therefore decrease the VOC of the devices as well. On the other hand, the increase in PC61BM dimers, which act as traps within the photoactive layer would increase the SRH recombination and consequently decrease the VOC. Thermal annealing dissociates the PC61BM dimer to monomer, which explains the reversibility of VOC losses.
The partially recovered FF of the aged devices after thermal annealing indicates that the FF decay may also be correlated to the formation of PC61BM dimers. The increased series resistance (Rs) and decreased shunt resistance (Rsh, Table 2) in the aged devices induced by the formation of PC61BM dimers could be the reason for the lower FF of the aged devices. In addition, the incomplete FF recovery of the aged cells after thermal annealing provides a hit that nanomorphology changes within the photoactive layer might the second reason for the FF decrease, through a change of interface charge separation and charge transportation. In addition, charge carrier mobility changes that caused by nanomorphology changes of the photoactive layer due to the formation of PC61BM dimers and PC61BM clusters could be another important reason for the lower FF. Understanding the charge carrier mobility changes within the photoactive layer will give a better understanding on the detail degradation mechanism, which is undergoing in our lab.
Nevertheless, the current work clearly confirmed that the formation of PC61BM dimers is thought to be the main reason for the initial “burn-in” performance decay, which leads to a fast and external load dependent JSC decay, as well as slower VOC and FF decays. This PC61BM dimerization related degradation process was found to be external load dependent and thermally reversible. In addition to this, molecule diffusion of PC61BM that leads to the formation of PC61BM clusters and the consequent disruption of P3HT crystalline domains could be the second important reason for the performance decay, which was found to be external load independent and thermally irreversible.


Correlation between external load and the formation of PC61BM dimers. 
As discussed above, the photon-induced dimerization of PC61BM is thought to be the main reason for the reversible and external load-dependent performance decay of the P3HT:PC61BM cells, which suggests that the formation of PC61BM dimers is external load dependent. Edman et al. confirmed that the dimerization of PC61BM occurs through a so-called “bi-excited” molecular reaction, where two triplet molecules are involved, as shown in the following equations:51 (3) (4) (5)where M, 1M*, 3M* and 1D* denote the ground state of the monomer, the singlet state of the monomer, the triplet state of the monomer, and the singlet excited state of the dimer of the PC61BM molecule. KISC and KD represent constants for the intersystem crossing and dimerization rate, respectively, and h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of photon.
To better understand the influence of the external load on the formation of PC61BM dimers, energy diagrams of the P3HT:PC61BM cells operated under different load conditions were established and are shown in Fig. 6. It is known that light illumination of the photoactive layer creates a large number of excitons within the photoactive layer, which are then charge separated to form polymer cations and fullerene anions. The separated charge carriers are then shifted to the electrode, driven by a built-in potential (Vbi), which leads to band bending within the photoactive layer.52 The internal potential difference within the device (Vinternal) is then determined by the difference between the total potential difference (Vtd) and the voltage output. Therefore, Vinternal decreases with an increased in external load, i.e., the highest Vinternal will be equal to Vbi when the device is shorted, while the lowest Vinternal will be equal to Vbi − VOC when device is in the open-circuit state (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the net current (Jnet) running through the entire device is also external load dependent, and the highest Jnet is equal to JSC when then device is shorted, whereas the lowest current is 0 when the device is in the open-circuit state. Therefore, the net exciton concentration (Cexcitonnet) can be described by eqn (6): Cexcitonnet = Cexcitontotal − Cexcitonrecom − (Jleak + Jnet)/q(6)where Cexcitontotal represents the total exciton concentration created by light excitation, Cexcitonrecom represents the concentration of the recombined excitons, and Jleak represents the separated charges that cannot be collected by the electrodes. Assuming that the light absorption ability of the cells is equal for all cells operated under different load conditions, and Cexcitonrecom and Jleak are negligible in comparison with Cexcitontotal, the highest Cexcitonnet is expected for the device operated in the open-circuit state, while the lowest Cexcitonnet should be detected when the device is in the short-circuit state (Fig. 6). Since PC61BM dimerization involves a triplet state related bi-molecular coupling reaction, a higher dimerization rate of PC61BM is expected for devices operated under open-circuit conditions, owing to the highest Cexcitonnet within the photoactive layer. Thus, the external load-dependent degradation of P3HT:PC61BM can be clearly explained.

(b) Energy level alignment of individual functional layer. (c) Energy band alignment of the photoactive layer under light illumination under different load conditions. 


Method to suppress “burn-in” degradation. 
To further confirm that the external load-dependent “burn-in” performance losses are PC61BM triplet-related process, piperazine, a triplet quencher for fullerene molecules,53,54 was used as an additive and blended in the photoactive layer. Very interestingly, upon blending with 3% piperazine, the P3HT:PC61BM devices showed comparable device performance to that of the device without piperazine. An average PCE of 3.30 ± 0.12% was obtained with a VOC of 0.61 ± 0.003 V, JSC of 9.32 ± 0.12 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.58 ± 0.01 (see Fig. S9 in the ESI† for the J–V curve of the best cell). Fig. 7 shows the evaluation of the photovoltaic parameters of the piperazine-blended cells over 200 hours. For comparison, a piperazine-free reference cell was also fabricated and tested under short circuit condition at the same run. The degradation curves of the reference cell are also shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen here, the PCE of the reference cell decays to around 60% of its initial value. In contrast, there is no performance degradation for the piperazine blended cells for aging 200 hours. Except for the JSC, which shows a slight decay, the VOC is extremely stable, whereas FF even increases slightly during aging, demonstrating that the “burn-in” degradation of P3HT:PC61BM cells is fully suppressed, and device stability greatly improved by blending with 3% piperazine. These results not only confirm that the “burn-in” degradation of P3HT:PC61BM solar cells is PC61BM exciton related, but also bring a very effective way to improve the stability of P3HT:PC61BM cells. In addition to the P3HT:PC61BM cells, device stability improvement of using piperazine as additive was also confirmed in PTB7-Th:PC61BM cells, demonstrating the generality of “burn-in” degradation suppression effect of piperazine (Fig. S10†). Investigations on the detail working mechanism of piperazine are undergoing.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the external load-dependent “burn-in” degradation behavior of P3HT:PC61BM cells was clearly demonstrated, where devices decay much faster in the open-circuit state than in the short-circuit state. Analyzing the products of the photoactive layer after light illumination confirms the formation of PC61BM dimers, which is ascribed to be the main reason for the “burn-in” decay in this type of solar cell. A higher exciton concentration within the photoactive layer under higher external load condition speeds up the dimerization of PC61BM molecules and consequently accelerates the performance decay, which is considered to be the reason for the external load dependence. In addition to the formation of PC61BM dimers, formation of PC61BM clusters that leads to the nanomorphology changes during aging was ascribed to the second reason for the performance decay, which is external load independent and thermal irreversible. Blending the photoactive layer with 3% piperazine, an exciton quencher for fullerene molecules, successfully suppress the external load-dependent “burn-in” degradation, which on one hand, confirms the proposed PC61BM exciton related degradation mechanism and, on the other hand, provides an effective way to improve the device performance.
