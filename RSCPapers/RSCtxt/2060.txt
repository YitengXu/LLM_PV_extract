    , Accepted 14th April 2022First published on 18th April 2022AbstractThe defects at the interface and grain boundaries of perovskite films downgrade the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) dramatically. Hence, improving perovskite film quality is essential for the achievement of high-performance solar cells. Herein, three new dicyclopentadithienothiophene (DCDTT)-based non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) IN-DCDTT (1), INCl-DCDTT (2), and INBr-DCDTT (3) are developed as a promising platform for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells to achieve simple preparation, high efficiency, and good stability. SEM and XRD data indicate that, with the addition of chlorinated NFA 2 in the active layer preparation, perovskite hybrid films exhibit larger grain sizes and higher crystallinity than pristine perovskite films. As shown by EDS and IR, all the non-fullerene acceptors (compounds 1–3) with functional carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN) groups have good interaction with undercoordinated Pb atoms and passivate the trap states in the perovskite films. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals that the molecule INCl-DCDTT (2) facilitates efficient hole extraction. Consequently, solar cells based on 2−perovskite hybrid films yield an excellent power conversion efficiency of 21.39% with an FF of 0.82, a Jsc of 23.71 mA cm−2, and a Voc of 1.10 V, which represents a significant improvement as compared to a PCE of 17% obtained for the control device. Meanwhile, devices based on IN-DCDTT (1) and INBr-DCDTT (3)−perovskite hybrid films also show enhanced performance with a slightly lower PCE of 19.21% and 20.59%, respectively than cells based on 2−perovskite hybrid films. The cost-effective chlorinated INCl-DCDTT (2) and brominated INBr-DCDTT (3) organic small molecules were successfully used as donor passivation agents to improve the photovoltaic performance of Pb-based PSCs. Furthermore, compound 1–3 derived PSC devices also exhibit excellent long-term stability enhancement. In particular, a device based on INCl-DCDTT (2) treated perovskite retains ∼90% of the initial PCE after 63 days in a glove box as compared to that (55%) of the control device. This simple surface treatment, by the addition of new NFAs, provides a new strategy to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance charge transport at the device interface.
Introduction
The energy demands of the world are continuously growing along with the increasing industrialization, causing serious pollution. Solar energy is a promising form of renewable energy that can be used to help address both the global energy crisis and environmental issues.1–5 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies for highly efficient solar energy production and have attracted tremendous attention due to the excellent photoelectric properties of the absorber, such as a low bandgap, a high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, efficient ambipolar charge transport, high carrier mobility, and long charge diffusion length and lifetime as well as solution processability.6–17 In the past decade, explosive progress in the research and development of PSCs18–21 has been observed, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has achieved an astonishingly rapid increase from 3.8% to over 25%,22,23 demonstrating the great potential for industrialization. Nevertheless, the stability of PSCs lags behind the requirements for commercialization, and it is still challenging to further improve both the PCE and stability of devices using solution-processing techniques.24–26 Previous results showed that the PCE and stability of PSCs are significantly influenced by the recombination loss at grain boundaries (GBs) via trap-assisted non-radiative recombination of perovskite films and the perovskite/charge transport layer (CTL) interface.27–29 In addition, it is also known that the degradation of perovskite films occurs preferentially on GBs.30–35 These phenomena indicate that the stability and PCE of PSCs can be improved by increasing the grain size and reducing the GB defects via regulating the perovskite crystallization process. In addition to the perovskite film quality, the energy level offsets between the perovskite layer and CTL also play an important role in the efficiency of PSCs. Therefore, more work on optimizing the energy level alignment between perovskite and the CTL and improving the quality (crystallinity and grain size) of perovskite films by passivating the GBs and interfaces is critical for the development of PSCs in terms of achieving both high efficiency and good stability.36
Numerous strategies, such as the use of more appropriate solvents for the precursor, thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and additive engineering, have been used to improve perovskite film quality.37–42 In particular, various additives, such as hydroiodic acid (HI),43,44 ionic liquid,45 Lewis base,40,46,47 alkali metal cations,48–50 and polymers,51–59 have been added into the precursor solution to manipulate the nucleation and growth process of perovskite films and passivate the trap states caused by undercoordinated Pb2+. Fullerene derivatives60–64 were the first electron transporting materials (ETMs) used in PSCs, and are also gradually used as interface-modifying materials and additives in perovskite films. Fullerenes possess a number of advantages, such as suitable energy level alignment, high electron mobility, and a trap-passivation function. Furthermore nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as ITIC-Th,65INIC2,66IDIS-Th,67 and DTP-4F (ref. 68) (their structures are shown in Fig. S1a†), used as n-type materials in organic photovoltaics for achieving high PCE, have also been used as passivation agents of perovskite films to achieve power conversion efficiencies of 19.2%, 21.7%, 20.01%, and 22.16%, respectively, of the corresponding PSCs.
The development of organic small molecular passivation agents has become an important topic worldwide because they are beneficial for not only carrier transportation, but also simultaneously passivating multiple surface defects of perovskites to further increase the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.69–71 In this connection some organic molecules such as SY2, SY4,72SGT-421, and SGT-422,73 as shown in Fig. S1b,† have been reported as donor passivation agents for the fabrication of PSCs exhibiting a PCE of 18.96%, 18.44% 17.27%, and 10.01%, respectively. Furthermore, A–D–A type molecules such as DERDTS-TBDT,74 and M1 (ref. 75) (Fig. S1c†) were utilized for efficient carrier transportation for PSCs and demonstrated a PCE of 16.20% and 13.20%, respectively.
Inspired by the above findings, herein we have designed and synthesized three structurally new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), IN-DCDTT (1), INCl-DCDTT (2), and INBr-DCDTT (3) (their structures are displayed in Fig. 1) through simple synthetic routes. Compounds 1–3 consisting of a central dicyclopentadithienothiophene (DCDTT) core flanked by three strong electron-accepting terminal groups, such as dicyanomethylene indanone (IN) and its chlorinated (INCl) and brominated (INBr) derivatives, were used as new passivation agents for perovskite films to systematically investigate their effects on the perovskite crystal growth and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding cells. Note that chlorinated (INCl) and brominated (INBr) derivatives of indanone were utilized for the exploration of new NFAs in this study because they could be synthesized from inexpensive starting materials as compared to the commercially available fluorinated derivative of indanone (INF).68 Regular PSCs based on IN-DCDTT (1), chlorinated INCl-DCDTT (2), and brominated INBr-DCDTT (3) passivated perovskite films exhibit the highest PCE of 19.21%, 21.39%, and 20.59%, respectively. In contrast, a PSC based on non-passivated perovskite shows a PCE of 17%. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of cost-effective chlorinated (2) and brominated (3) small molecular NFAs to be used as donor passivation agents for Pb-based perovskite to achieve a PCE of greater than 21%. Most importantly, sufficient experimental evidence has proved that defect passivation occurred at the perovskite grain boundaries.76,77 In addition, the branched alkyl chain of DCDTTs also plays an important role in preventing moisture from entering into the perovskite film. Therefore, the DCDTT-based PSCs exhibit excellent long-term stability. Our investigation provides new inexpensive and efficient chlorinated/brominated organic compounds and a practical/useful strategy for passivation of perovskite grain boundaries to achieve highly photovoltaic performance PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of DCDTT-based compounds 1–3
The synthetic route for DCDTT-based non-fullerene acceptors is depicted in Scheme 1 and S1-4 (see the ESI† for the detailed experimental part). First, diesterified DTT 6 was synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction of distannylated DTT 4 and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate (5) using a Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst. Then, a double nucleophilic addition of an alkoxyphenyl anion (7) to the ester groups of 6 led to the formation of the benzylic alcohol 8, which was then subjected to intramolecular annulation through an amberlyst-15/toluene mediated Friedel–Crafts reaction to furnish the new core of dicyclopentadithienothiophene (DCDTT; 9). Further, by treating DCDTT (9) with POCl3via the Vilsmeier–Haack condition, diformylated 10 was obtained. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of 10 with three indanonyl (IN) derivatives, 11-13, affords the final NFAs 1–3 in good yields. The new synthesized target compounds 1–3 and intermediates have been extensively characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry, and the related spectra are included in the ESI.† The solubility of the new DCDTT-based compounds 1–3 is significantly improved with the introduction of four branched ethylhexyl chains on the central core. Therefore, all compounds 1–3 have excellent solubility in common organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene and chloroform.

Optical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of DCDTT-based compounds 1–3
The optical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of compounds 1–3 are summarized in Table 1. These compounds exhibit good thermal stability, with 5% weight loss occurring from 380–406 °C as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S2, ESI†). The optical absorption spectra of compounds 1–3 in o-chlorobenzene are shown in Fig. 2. The halogenated INCl-DCDTT (2) and INBr-DCDTT (3) in solution show a maximum absorption at 781 nm whereas IN-DCDTT (1) does so at 754 nm. Both the maximum absorptions of INCl-DCDTT (2) and INBr-DCDTT (3) exhibit an obvious red-shift of 27 nm compared with IN-DCDTT (1), which indicates that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron rich moiety to the electron-withdrawing group is enhanced in the compounds INCl-DCDTT (2) and INBr-DCDTT (3).78–80 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of compounds 1–3 were determined by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in o-dichlorobenzene at 25 °C using Bu4N+PF6− as an electrolyte. The oxidation potentials of molecules 1–3 were calibrated using ferrocene as an internal standard and the latter was set at +0.64 V versus NHE. The oxidation and reduction potentials and derived energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 3a and b and S3, ESI.† The oxidation peaks of compounds 1–3 are located at +1.18 V (1), +1.25 V (2), and +1.25 V (3) and the reduction potentials are −0.43 V (1), −0.30 V (2), and −0.30 V (3), respectively. The derived EHOMO/ELUMO are thus estimated to be −5.62/−4.01 eV for 1, −5.69/−4.14 eV for 2, and −5.69/−4.14 eV for 3, using the equation: EHOMO/ELUMO = −(4.44 + 0.64 + Eox/Ered). As expected, the EHOMO energy levels of INCl-DCDTT (2) and INBr-DCDTT (3) exhibit relatively downshifted values compared to those of IN-DCDTT (1) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of chlorine and bromine on the end-capping IN units.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to gain further insights into the electronic structures of compounds 1–3 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of the Gaussian 03 W program. The HOMO of compounds 1–3 is primarily located on the central core while the LUMO is primarily located on the central backbone and end-capping moiety (Fig. 3c). The computed EHOMO are at −5.29, −5.49, and −5.46 eV, respectively, and the ELUMO are at −3.36, −3.59, and −3.57 eV, respectively, for compounds 1–3. Thus, the trend of the HOMO and LUMO energy values of compounds 1–3 obtained using DFT are consistent with those derived from the DPV data.
The ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum (UPS) shown in Fig. S4, ESI† was used to measure the VB levels of perovskites. The CB edge was estimated from the Tauc plot of the absorption spectrum displayed in Fig. S5, ESI.† The energy level diagrams of TiO2, perovskites, compounds 1–3 treated perovskite, and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 4 and the values are listed in Table S1, ESI.† The LUMO energy level of the INCl-DCDTT-passivated perovskite film (named 2-PSK) is located at −4.19 eV, which is very close to the TiO2 electron transporting layer (−4.2 eV), results in minimal voltage loss. The HOMO energy level of 2-PSK is located at 5.81 eV, which is suitable for extracting holes from the perovskite layer.

Furthermore, the UV−Vis absorption spectra of pristine perovskite and 1–3 treated perovskites showed that 2-PSK has the highest UV-Vis absorption in the range of 500–750 nm (Fig. S6†), which can absorb more light maybe because the film has denser morphology, larger grain size and higher crystallinity.13 However, the absorption edge of all perovskite films is similar, indicating that the quality of the perovskite film did not significantly affect the bandgap energy.
The morphology and photo-physics of the perovskite films w/wo passivation, as well as the photovoltaic performance and stability of the corresponding cells
The passivating of the perovskite films with compounds 1–3 was simply carried out by dissolving compounds 1–3 in the anti-solvent (chlorobenzene, CB) and dripping on the perovskite precursor films during spinning (see the experimental section). A perovskite film fabricated with pure CB (named pristine perovskite) as an anti-solvent was also examined as a parallel comparison. The surface morphology of the perovskite films using pure CB and 1–3(CB) solutions as anti-solvent was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with the results shown in Fig. 5a. The pristine perovskite film exhibits a rough surface with inhomogeneous grain size: containing small (∼100 nm) and big (∼600 nm) grains, with an average size of ca. 300 nm. Surprisingly, the perovskite films prepared using 1–3(CB) as an anti-solvent show a flat, densely packed morphology with large grains. 1-PSK has small (∼100 nm) and big (∼1000 nm) grains with an average size of ca. 500 nm. 2-PSK has an average size of ca. 800 nm with a very uniform grain size and 3-PSK has a larger average size (ca. 900 nm) but the grain size is not as uniform as that of 2-PSK. SEM images demonstrate that the addition of compounds 1–3 in the anti-solvent could modify the crystallization process of the perovskite films to grow larger grains. Fig. 5b shows cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite films. The pristine perovskite film exhibits some pin-hole defects and is loosely attached on the TiO2 surface. The pin-hole defects are detrimental to the charge transport and collection. Perovskite films treated with compounds 1–3, especially 2-PSK, were continuous films without any grain boundaries and were attached closely on the TiO2 surface. The crystalline phases of pristine perovskite and compounds 1–3 treated perovskite films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 5c–d). The XRD patterns of all perovskite films exhibit the same diffraction characteristics. Nevertheless, the intensity of the (100) diffraction peak of 2-PSK is the strongest (22.18) followed by that of 3-PSK (19.47) or 1-PSK (17.82), and the weakest peak (15.55) was detected in the pristine perovskite film. These results proved that the INCl-DCDTT (2) treatment significantly increases the crystallinity of the perovskite film. SEM X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping was performed (both on the top and cross-section of the perovskite film) to prove the successful introduction of INCl-DCDTT (2) into the perovskite film, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. It is interesting to note that more sulfur, oxygen, chlorine, and nitrogen of compound 2 are present in the grain boundaries of the perovskite film. This implies some interaction between grain boundaries and INCl-DCDTT (2). Moreover, the branched alkyl chains of INCl-DCDTT (2) also simultaneously exist in the grain boundaries, and these prevent water vapor from entering the film which would be damaged due to the frail grain boundary. Fig. 6b reveals that INCl-DCDTT (2) penetrated the entire perovskite layer and then was randomly distributed vertically. To further investigate the interactions between compounds 1–3 and under-coordinated Pb ions in perovskite films, we acquired the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of compounds 1–3 as well as their mixtures with PbI2 and are shown in Fig. S7a–c, ESI.† For compounds 1–3, the symmetric stretching vibrations of the CO bond located at 1771 cm−1, 1771 cm−1 and 1749 cm−1, respectively, and those of the CN bond appeared at 2211 cm−1, 2219 cm−1, and 2210 cm−1, respectively. When compounds 1–3 are mixed with PbI2, the vibrations of the CO bond (1768 cm −1, 1758 cm −1, and 1746 cm −1) and CN bond (2197 cm−1, 2205 cm−1 and 2195 cm−1) shift to lower wavenumbers, indicating that there is an interaction between the perovskite and compounds 1–3.67,81 As shown in Fig. 7a due to the low temperature solution-based fabrication processes and the ionic nature of perovskite materials, there are many defects such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and halide vacancies on the grain boundaries of the perovskite film, which will work as recombination centres and dramatically reduce device performance.

 Fig. 7  (a) Grain boundary defect and H2O penetration on the pristine perovskite. (b) Grain boundary passivated by compounds 1–3, which can prevent H2O entering to degrade the perovskite. 
Moreover, the water vapor quickly enters and damages the perovskite film through grain boundaries, reducing device stability. On the other hand, as depicted in Fig. 7b, perovskite films treated with the NFA 2 passivation agent having the carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN) functional groups, provide good binding or passivation to the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects besides facilitating the formation of dense films with large grain size. Therefore, a higher efficiency and more stable device was obtained when perovskite was treated with NFA molecules.
To investigate the effects of the passivation on the quality and hole transport efficiency of the resulting perovskite films, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the pristine and compounds 1–3 treated perovskite films on glass and coated with an extra layer of spiro-OMeTAD hole transporter were measured and are shown in Fig. 8a and b (the PL intensities of all perovskite films are given in Table S2, ESI† and the exciton life-times estimated from the TRPL are listed in Table S3, ESI†). The PL intensity of the perovskite film incorporated with compound 2 is lower than that of the compound 1 or 3 treated-perovskite film when a layer of hole transporter is coated on top of them. The result indicated more efficient charge transfer at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface. Without the spiro-OMeTAD overlayer, the PL intensity of the perovskite film with INCl-DCDTT (2) is the strongest, which suggests that it has the best quality (i.e. the least defect sites). The nano-second time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained with an optical-microscope-based system. The lifetime of the excitons (or the charge recommendation rate) can be resolved by fitting the normalized time-dependent photoluminescence using a 2-constant exponential decay function using the equation reported previously.64 The fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) lifetimes listed in Table S3† revealed that the pristine perovskite film (coated with spiro-OMeTAD) exhibited an average decay time of 1.73 ns. The PL decay time is shorter for compounds 1–3-treated perovskite films coated with spiro-OMeTAD. 2-PSK/spiro-OMeTAD showed the shortest average decay time of 0.44 ns. 2-PSK exhibits the most efficient hole transfer from perovskite to the HTL. The TRPL data clearly demonstrate the better hole transfer ability of perovskite when treated with the designed compounds 1–3 compared to the control device. Amongst them INCl-DCDTT (2) is the highest efficiency passivator for perovskite films.

To evaluate the passivation effects of compounds 1–3 on the solar cell performance, we fabricated regular (n–i–p) mesoporous PSC devices (with the cell structure of FTO (150 nm)/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Psk (ca. 500 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (ca. 200 nm)/MoO3 (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm)) by incorporating compounds 1–3 into perovskite absorbers (the device architecture and schematic of the grain boundary passivation by INCl-DCDTT (2) are shown in Fig. S8a and b, ESI†). The concentration of compounds 1–3 in the anti-solvent was first optimized to be 0.2 wt% and the I–V curves of the highest-efficiency PSCs are shown in Fig. 9a. The current-density–voltage (J–V) curves measured by the forward and reverse scan of the cell based on 2-PSK and pristine perovskite absorbers are illustrated in Fig. 9b and c. The cell based on the pristine perovskite film exhibits a max PCE of 17.00% with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 21.98 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.73. The device based on INCl-DCDTT (2) treated perovskite shows significant improvement of PCE to 21.39% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 23.71 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.82. Whereas devices based on 1-PSK and 3-PSK show an increase in PCE to 19.21% (with a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 22.52 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.79) and 20.59% (with a Voc of 1.09 V, a Jsc of 23.32 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.81), respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the champion PSCs based on four different perovskite absorbers are summarized in Table 2. Furthermore, the 2-PSK based device exhibits negligible hysteresis (hysteresis index = 0.5%, see Fig. 9b and Table S4, ESI†), as compared to the reference device with a hysteresis index of 18.94% (Fig. 9c and Table S5, ESI†). The integrated current density calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 9d and Table S6, ESI†) was 19.75 mA cm−2, 20.98 mA cm−2, 22.22 mA cm−2, and 21.77 mA cm−2 for the reference and compound 1–3-passivated devices, respectively, which is in line with the Jsc obtained from the J–V characterization.

We also measured the photo-current of the champion devices based on pristine perovskite and 2-PSK to determine the steady state power output and the results are shown in Fig. 10a and b. Thus, cells based on pristine perovskite and 2-PSK exhibit stabilized efficiencies of 16.5% and 21% respectively at the maximum power point (held at 0.83 V and 0.95 V, respectively). The efficiency distribution of PSC devices based on 2-PSK was also assessed and is shown in Fig. S9, ESI.† The efficiency distribution is quite narrow suggesting that the cells were reproducible. The trap state density and charge mobility in the vertical direction of the pristine perovskite and 2-PSK were evaluated to assess the key impact of morphological changes. The electron-only devices were fabricated with the architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag, as shown in Fig. 11a. The dark I–V characteristics for the representative cells are shown in Fig. 11b. The electron mobilities for the pristine perovskite and 2-PSK films were estimated to be 3.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.47 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The corresponding trap state densities were estimated to be 1.61 × 1016 cm−3, and 7.14 × 1015 cm−3. A comparatively better carrier mobility and lower trap state density are achieved for the 2-PSK film than the pristine perovskite film, which is expected to benefit charge collection in the corresponding solar cell. Furthermore, to compare the charge transport we measured the effective conductivity (Fig. S10, ESI†) of pristine and compounds 1–3 treated perovskites, and the values are listed in Table S7, ESI†. Devices for measuring the conductivity were fabricated with the architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/Au. The conductivities were estimated to be 1.33 × 10−2, 1.75 × 10−2, 2.64 × 10−2, and 1.75 × 10−2 mS cm−1 for pristine and compounds 1–3 treated perovskites, respectively. It was found that 2-PSK exhibits the highest conductivity amongst all perovskite films.

Note that all devices based on compounds 1–3 treated perovskite showed higher PCE than the reference device, and among these the INCl-DCDTT (2) treated cell showed the highest PCE. The enhanced device performance could be attributed to the effectiveness of the grain boundary passivation of compounds 1–3.82
Long-term stability is becoming an important parameter in PSC research.83 Therefore, we tested the stability of the noncapsulated devices. During the test interval the devices were kept at room temperature in a N2-filled glove box. The PCE of the reference device degrades to 55% of its initial performance after 63 days, whereas the cells based on compounds 1–3-passivated perovskite absorbers showed enhanced stability, maintaining at least 82% of their initial values (see Fig. 12a). It is reported that defects at the perovskite grain boundaries initialize degradation due to the interaction of perovskite materials with moisture and oxygen.842-PSK and 3-PSK are much more hydrophobic compared to the pristine perovskites, as seen in the water contact angles shown in Fig. 12b. The pristine perovskite film shows a 44° water contact angle, while the contact angles of compounds 1–3 treated perovskite films are 78, 83° and 85°, respectively. The improved stability might be attributed to the reduction of inherent defects by the hydrophobic surface, providing stronger resistance to degradation by ambient water. The significantly improved stability of PSCs based on 2-PSK may also be due to the high quality perovskite film, with large grain sizes and good crystallinity.85

Conclusions
We present a unique strategy to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs by introducing three new organic semiconductors (compounds 1–3) containing a novel fused-thiophene ring (DCDTT) flanked by electron-accepting terminal groups such as dicyanomethylene indanone (IN), and its chloro-(INCl) and bromo-(INBr) derivatives into the perovskite films, via anti-solvent dropping. The SEM and XRD data indicate that the perovskite films with INCl-DCDTT (2) exhibit larger grain sizes and bigger crystallinity relative to the pristine perovskite films. EDS and FTIR data suggest that INCl-DCDTT (2) with functional carbonyl (CO) and cyano (CN) groups can form coordination bonds with undercoordinated Pb cations and passivate the defects in the perovskite films. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals that INCl-DCDTT (2) facilitates the hole extraction of the cell. Further, regular perovskite solar cells based on INCl-DCDTT (2) treated−perovskite yield an excellent power conversion efficiency of 21.39% with an FF of 0.82%, a Jsc of 23.71 mA cm−2, and a Voc of 1.10 V, which represents a significant improvement as compared to the 17% obtained for the controlled reference device. Meanwhile, cells based on IN-DCDTT (1) and INBr-DCDTT (3) treated-perovskite films also show an enhanced PCE of 19.21% and 20.59%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples of cost-effective chlorinated (INCl-DCDTT (2)) and brominated organic small molecules to be used as passivating agents to improve the photovoltaic performance of Pb-based regular PSCs. The device based on INCl-DCDTT (2) treated perovskite retains ∼90% of the initial PCE after 63 days inside the glove box, while the control device loses 45% of its initial PCE. This work demonstrates that small molecule semiconductor passivation of perovskite films is a promising platform to fabricate organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells with simple preparation, high efficiency, and good stability.

Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO/glass, TEC-7) was washed in a detergent solution for 30 min by sonication, which was followed by consecutive rinsing with water, ethanol, and acetone. A dense, compact layer of TiO2 (30 nm, c-TiO2) was deposited onto FTO by spray pyrolysis, using a 0.25 M TTIP (titanium isopropoxide) solution (Aldrich) at 180 °C. To prepare the mp-TiO2 layer, the TiO2 nanoparticle (30-NRT, Dyesol) paste diluted in ethanol (1:5, weight ratio) was spin coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 10 s and calcined at 550 °C for 30 min, which led to an around 200 nm thick mesoporous film, mp-TiO2. A perovskite absorber layer was deposited on top of the ETL using a one-step, anti-solvent dripping method from its precursor solution. The Psk precursor solution was prepared by mixing FAI, MABr, PbI2, and PbBr2 in DMF/DMSO (6:4, V/V) to form a 1.3 M (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 solution. A 40 μL Psk precursor solution was coated on the ETL with a spin program of 1000 rpm for 10 s, and then 7000 rpm for 15 s; in the last 3 s, 100 μL chlorobenzene or IN-DCDTT derivatives in CB with various concentrations were used as anti-solvents for crystalizing perovskite films. The resulting (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (Psk) film was heated at 150 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, a doped spiro-OMeTAD HTL was spin-coated on Psk, followed by the vacuum deposition of 5 nm MoO3 and a 100 nm Ag electrode.92 The deposition of the Psk active layer and HTL was performed in a N2 filled glove box. The cells were further optimized by depositing an approximately 100 nm-thick NaF film on the back of the FTO glass as an anti-reflection coating.93 The physicochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of the PSCs were measured using the same methods as those previously reported.94,95
