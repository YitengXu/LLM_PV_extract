QD-based ECL sensors have numerous advantages and offer unique platforms for ECL signal transduction. Therefore, we review the sensing mechanisms and applications of QDs-based ECL sensors and their recent advances in this paper. First, the synthetic methods of QDs are summarized and compared. Then, we discuss the critical sensing mechanisms and construction strategies used to incorporate QDs into ECL sensing systems, focusing on the advantages and limitations of different sensing methodologies and modification methods. This article also highlights recent advances in representative examples of QD-based ECL sensors, including ECL resonance energy transfer, multiplex immunoassays, and ratiometric sensors.

1. Introduction
Electrochemiluminescence technology, also called electrogenerated chemiluminescence and abbreviated ECL, integrates the distinct advantages of electrochemistry and spectroscopy. Starting from the highly energetic electron transfer reaction at the electrode, the ECL process generates species in excited states and results in light emission.1,2 The incorporation of electrochemical and photoluminescence analysis can take advantage of each analysis modality and overcome the limitations of single sensing methods, which is preferable for precise detection. Therefore, ECL sensing shows fast response speeds, simple operation processes and excellent sensitivity.3–5 More importantly, ECL also addresses the deficiencies of both electrochemical and photoluminescence analysis. On the one hand, without an excitation light source, the background noise in conventional photoluminescence sensing systems (such as auto-fluorescence and scattered light) are largely reduced. On the other hand, the utilization of potential can initiate and regulate ECL signals with high reproducibility and accuracy, which overcomes the key limitations of electrochemical analysis. Furthermore, the time and position of ECL at the electrode surface can be accurately controlled for different practical test requirements. Therefore, ECL sensing techniques are being developed to fabricate sensors and biosensors.6–8
Research on the ECL of QDs has been in progress since 2002.9 Because the size of QDs is close to the exciton Bohr radius, resulting in quantum confinement effects, QDs have several unique optical, chemical, and electronic features. In contrast to natural atoms and bulk materials, the size-dependent electronic states of QDs provide modified photo-physical properties, such as the ability to change their optical properties based on size. The unique electronic and optical features of QDs have been utilized in nanoelectronics, solar cells, photocatalysis, and sensing applications.10–13 Although still in their infancy, QD-based ECL sensors have received increasing attention due to their advantages, including not only the outstanding nanostructures and multiple colors of QDs, which can be tailored by changing their sizes, shapes, and compositions, but also their advanced surface modification and conjugation technologies. Compared with conventional ECL luminophores (e.g. luminol and Ru(bpy)32+), QDs have good stability, functional flexibility, ideal optical properties, and low cost.14,15 For example, luminol is not suitable for labeling biomolecules, and the ECL of luminol requires alkaline media (pH 13.0). Therefore, the diverse functions of QDs have been employed in several different sensing strategies to provide more efficient ECL detection. Typical QD-based ECL sensors should incorporate novel QDs, coating materials, and functional ligands to improve their detection signals and specific targeting. The designed ECL methods should have high selectivity and valid experimental reproducibility and possess sensitive ECL signals with low required doses in the biological matrix. To date, various QDs, including classical chalcogenide QDs,16 carbon nanodots (CQDs),17 graphene QDs (GQDs),18 Si QDs,19 carbon nitride QDs (CNQDs),20 and doped QDs,21 have been employed as luminophores, coreactants, or energy transfer donors/acceptors in ECL sensors. The development of novel syntheses and modified methods can further reduce the toxicity of QDs and improve their sensing specificities. In addition, many kinds of functional nanoparticles are employed in novel QD-based ECL sensors, such as carbon nanotubes, Au NPs, Fe3O4 magnetic NPs, Au/Ag nanoclusters, and graphene nanosheets.22–26 Recently, QD-based ECL sensors have been flourishing as novel analytical tools and are playing increasingly important roles in analysis and sensor research (as shown in Fig. 1). QD-based ECL sensors have been explored for various detection and assay methods, including immunosensors, aptasensing, energy transfer, in situ label-free analysis, enzymatic amplification quantification, near-infrared (NIR) analysis, multiplex immunoassays, and cytosensors.26–30 When used with commercially available instruments, QD-based ECL sensors show higher economic efficiency and greater flexibility in clinical settings.

Although many excellent reviews have recently focused on the application of ECL analysis systems based on QDs and other NPs,26–32 these usually focus on electrical chemistry and are limited to sensing applications. There are few reviews about QD-based ECL sensors from the point of view of the design principles and critical construction strategies of QD-based nanomaterials. In this review, we aim to review recent advances in QD-based ECL sensors. Specifically, we focus on studies of various QDs with different roles in ECL sensing applications. We first outline several types of functional QDs utilized in ECL detection. Then, we focus on discussing design strategies with different principles of ECL sensors based on various QDs. Furthermore, the utilization of QD-based ECL sensors is discussed. Finally, we discuss some critical issues and some perspectives for the future development of QD-based ECL sensors.
2. Overview of QDs
Although many ECL studies have focused on NPs with remarkable optical and electrical properties, research on the ECL properties and sensing of QDs is still in the initial stage. Therefore, only the main types of QDs which have been used in ECL research, along with their synthesis methods and nanostructures, are introduced in this section. Especially, the intrinsic advantages and limitations of each type of QD used in ECL are summarized to show the potential functions of QDs in ECL sensing. More detailed ECL-related features of these QDs (e.g., quantum yields, lifetimes, Stokes shifts, etc.) are listed in Table 1.

2.1 Silicon QDs
Silicon QDs, which contain nontoxic elements, are essential for human health. More importantly, the degradation product of Si QDs, silicic acid, can be readily excreted via urine. In 2002, the first research on ECL of silicon QDs was reported by Brad et al.10 Because of the greater significance of surface states for charge injection as opposed to photo injection (as shown in Fig. 2), the ECL peak at 640 nm had a significant red shift from the photoluminescence peak of the Si QDs at 420 nm. The preparation of Si QDs is based on an etching method with a silicon source or a microemulsion technique with silane precursors. The etching procedure can reduce the size of the QDs and separate agglomerated QDs. Also, with the etching process, the size of the Si QDs decreases, resulting in a visible PL change from red to green. For example, using a cosputtering method, Si, SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 were simultaneously sputtered.33 The mixture film was deposited on a stainless-steel substrate, peeled from the plate, and annealed at 1100–1200 °C for 30 min to grow Si QDs in a BPSG matrix. Then, Si QDs were extracted from the matrix using a hydrofluoric acid solution and dispersed in methanol. In the microemulsion synthesis experiment, a phase transfer agent and surfactant (e.g. tetraoctylammonium bromide) was employed to stabilize the halogenated silane precursors. With the addition of lithium aluminum hydride, Si QDs can be precipitated homogeneously from micelles. The major limitation of Si QDs is their unstable photoluminescence and poor colloidal stability.

2.2 Chalcogenide QDs
Chalcogenide QDs are the largest category of quantum dots. Chalcogenide QDs are composed of elements from groups II–VI (e.g., CdSe, CdTe, CdS) or IV–VI (e.g., PbSe, PbS). Depending on the energy gaps and relative positions of their electronic levels, different chalcogenide QDs show different properties and emit different colors. In fact, QDs can be prepared with emissions from the ultraviolet (UV) region to the infrared (IR) region by changing their sizes and compositions in a relatively simple manner. Also, the full-width at half-maximum of chalcogenide QD emission bands is typically 20 nm. This narrow emission profile reduces spectral overlap and enables simultaneous discrimination of different-colored QDs for multiplex analysis. Moreover, QDs have long excited state lifetimes (30–100 ns) which are greater than those of organic dyes (5 ns). Cd-chalcogenide QDs are prepared via wet chemical synthesis methods.34 In this process, inorganic atoms first nucleate as highly symmetrical cluster compounds that eventually expand into nanocrystalline cores. After growth, surfactant molecules (e.g. trioctylphosphine oxide, mercaptopropionic acid) commonly surround the QDs and improve their solubility. Synthesis methods include the organometallic approach and aqueous phase colloidal synthesis. The organometallic approach starts from organometallic precursors in organic solvent at high temperature. For example, organometallic precursors of cadmium are formed from cadmium acetate.35 Under vigorous stirring at 300 °C, organometallic precursors of cadmium are rapidly injected into selenium in organic solvent (trioctylphosphine oxide or trioctylphosphine). After nucleation of the QDs, the reaction temperature is decreased to ca. 250–280 °C. The pyrolysis of organometallic precursors provides hydrophobic QDs, which have single crystalline structures and well-controlled sizes and size distributions. In addition to the organometallic approach, aqueous phase colloidal synthesis can be used to prepare biologically compatible QDs in water directly.36 For precursor preparation, CdCl2 is dissolved in water with stabilizing agents such as mercapto-alcohols and mercapto-acids. Sodium hydrogen telluride (NaHTe) is produced by the reaction of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) with tellurium powder and added to the precursor solution. The resulting solution is refluxed at 100 °C to control the dimensions of the CdTe QDs. It should be noted that because heavy metal elements are essential parts of most chalcogenide QDs (e.g. Cd and Pb), environmental concerns and toxicity problems limit the biosensing applications of Cd-chalcogenide QDs. To date, increasing ECL research has focused on chalcogenide QDs, especially CdS, CdSe, and CdTe QDs. Zhu's group first reported four ECL peaks of CdS QDs with an annihilation mechanism.37 A brief summary of the PL and ECL mechanisms of PbS QDs is shown in Fig. 3.38 More detailed ECL mechanisms and sensing methodologies of chalcogenide QDs will be discussed in the next section.

2.3 Carbon-based QDs
Carbon-based QDs, including carbon nanodots (CQDs) and graphene QDs (GQDs), are considered highly promising materials in analytical and bioanalytical applications. CQDs are spherical dots with small sizes of less than 10 nm; they consist of an amorphous or crystalline core with predominant sp2 carbon and an oxidized carbon shell with oxygen-containing groups.39 GQDs are thin (typically 3 to 20 nm) graphene nanosheets less than 100 nm in width with a crystalline network consisting of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice.19 Because of their similar compositions (carbon and nitride), CQDs and GQDs are both inexpensive and nontoxic. Environmentally friendly carbon group QDs also can be prepared easily and have better electrical conductivity than semiconductor QDs. Although the exact PL mechanism of CQDs and GQDs is still controversial, the broad optical absorptions and photoluminescence emissions of carbon-based QDs are related to π-plasmon and surface or edge defects. There are two approaches to prepare carbon-based QDs: “top-down” and “bottom-up”. In top-down approaches, the synthesis of carbon-based QDs is based on the carbonization of carbon-rich precursors (e.g. fruit juices, grass, plant leaves, carbon fibers, coal, carbon nanotubes, and graphene oxide) in “one-pot” processing. Compared with top-down approaches, bottom-up routes are more controllable and introduce fewer defects. By controlling the interactions and ratios of their elemental precursors, CQDs and GQDs can be synthesized with more uniform chemical compositions and suitable shapes and size distributions. For example, in a facile bottom-up method, pyrolysis of citric acid at 200 °C can provide GQDs within 2 hours.40 Currently, the major limitations of CQDs and GQDs in sensing applications are their low number of PL colors and their low quantum yields. Furthermore, surface passivation can also affect the ECL activities of CQDs. Oxidized CQDs without any surface passivation obtained by a top-down method have shown excellent ECL activities. However, CQDs passivated with capping reagents via a bottom-up route showed unstable ECL signals with high background interference.41
Recently, carbon nitride QDs (CNQDs) have been used in the ECL field as a novel ECL luminophore. CNQDs are graphite nanosheet-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) QDs. As a Lewis base, CNQDs have a high fluorescence yield with good chemical and thermal stability. Similar to CQDs and GQDs, the photoluminescence of CNQDs is in the blue wavelength region, with a band gap at 2.7 eV. CNQDs can also be prepared by simple thermal pyrolysis methods. For example, white melamine powder was heated at 550 °C for 4 h to directly obtain yellow CNQDs.21 The CNQDs must be ground to powder for further use. Like the GQDs synthesis route, yellow CNQDs can also be synthesized from urea and sodium citrate at 180 °C in 1 h. Cheng et al. first reported ECL sensors using Cu(II)-based CNQDs with K2S2O8 as the co-reactant.42 They found that the ECL spectrum (ca. 470 nm) matched closely with the PL spectrum of CNQDs, as shown in Fig. 4. The ECL spectral features of CNQDs indicate that the excited-state CNQDs generated from electrochemical reactions are similar to those generated from photoexcitation.

2.4 Doped QDs
Doping technology has been widely used to prepare novel QDs with desirable properties and functions. In the doping process, many elements can be incorporated into the host lattices of original QDs. For chalcogenide QDs, a variety of transition metals and lanthanide ions can function as dopants, such as Mn, Cu, Ag, Eu, and Tb. As a result, doped QDs have longer emission lifetimes and lower toxicities. Not only the PL properties but also the ECL performance of doped QDs have been altered. For example, the ECL of ZnS QDs was generated at a negative potential of more than −2.0 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode.22 After Mn doping, a new ECL peak at −1.5 V was observed. Similar to the synthesis routes of chalcogenide QDs, doped QDs can be prepared via aqueous and organic phase synthesis with three strategies, including introduction of dopant into (i) the host precursor solution, (ii) the nucleation process of the host, and (iii) the shelling growth process of the host. Currently, doped QDs (e.g., Se, Mn, Co, and Eu-doped QDs) are showing unexpected ECL behaviors.43,44 Liu et al. synthesized Eu-doped CdSe QDs through a one-pot process.45 The Eu3+ doping induced a 5-fold enhancement of the ECL response of the CdSe QDs.
The properties of carbon-based QDs also can be updated by changing the dopant elements. Nitrogen-doped GQD is the most typical example. Because of quantum confinement and edge effects, heteroatoms (e.g. S and N) can penetrate directly into the carbon lattices of GQDs to modulate their electronic and optical properties. As a result, the QY and fluorescence color of N-doped GQD can be improved and greatly altered. Doped GQDs can also be prepared via top-down and bottom-up approaches. For example, hydrothermal synthesis from GO as a carbon source with nitrogen sources such as ammonia is a widely used top-down route to prepare N-doped GQDs.46 From the view of bottom-up approaches, N-doped GQDs can be synthesized via hydrothermal carbonization of citric acid with ammonia. Although there are very few reports on the ECL of doped QDs, doped QDs with more reactive sites have particular potential in ECL research. This is because the ECL mechanism strongly depends on the surface states of the QDs. For example, Chi's group introduced hydrazide groups into single-layer GQDs.47 The hydrazide-modified single-layer GQDs had fewer oxygen-containing groups and higher PL quantum yields than GQDs. Because the hydrazide-modified single-layer GQDs possess luminol-like units and blue-shifted PL emissions, the hydrazide groups of the single-layer GQDs can be electrochemically oxidized in alkaline solution and produce strong anodic ECL signals with hydrogen peroxide.
3. ECL mechanism and sensing methodology
In ECL sensing research, enhancement, quenching, and “off–on” switching of ECL signals have been reported, which is similar to PL sensors.48–50 However, the inherent QD-based ECL mechanism and sensing methodology are quite different from those of previous QD-based PL sensors. Therefore, we introduce the ECL mechanism of QD in this section. Also, the sensing methodology, including the direct modulation of excited-state QDs, the generation or consumption of ECL coreactants, electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer, and surface-enhanced electrochemiluminescence, will be subsequently discussed.
3.1 ECL mechanism
The ECL emission light of QDs arises from highly energetic electron-transfer reactions on the electrode with controllable potential. The major ECL mechanisms of QDs include annihilation ECL and coreactant ECL. In annihilation ECL, QDs are electrochemically oxidized and reduced simultaneously.51 Based on the electron transfer reactions, the radical cation and anion of a QD species are annihilated to form the excited state of the QDs. Also, light is rapidly emitted from the excited state of the QDs. The general mechanism of annihilation ECL is outlined below: QD–e → QD+˙ (electrochemically oxidized)(1) QD + e → QD−˙ (electrochemically reduced)(2) QD+˙ + QD−˙ → QD* + QD (annihilation)(3) QD* → QD + hν (ECL emission)(4)
Although annihilation ECL was the first type to be fully studied, most QD-based ECL applications are carried out using the coreactant ECL mechanism, which can greatly enhance the ECL efficiency of QDs. In the coreactant ECL, an assistant reagent, called the coreactant (e.g. oxalate ion and peroxydisulfate), is required.52,53 In directional potential scanning, QDs can react with the coreactant and emit light. Coreactant ECL is classified as anodic ECL (‘‘oxidative reduction’’) or cathodic ECL (‘‘reductive oxidation’’) according to the polarity of the applied potential and the role of the coreactant as a reductant or an oxidant. Due to the significant increase in the ECL efficiency of the QDs, coreactant ECL is suitable for commercial ECL assays and available analytical instruments.54 The general mechanism of coreactant ECL with S2O82− as the coreactant is outlined below: QD + e → QD−˙ (electrochemically reduced)(5) S2O82− + e → SO42− + SO4−˙ (electrochemically reduced)(6) QD−˙ + SO4−˙ → QD* + SO42− (cathodic ECL)(7) QD* → QD + hν (ECL emission)(8)
3.2 Direct modulation of excited-state QDs
Because QDs play the role of the ECL luminophore, the most direct sensing methodology is to modulate the ECL signal via regulation of the excited-state QDs. There are two functional aspects in the modulation of excited-state QDs: activity and quantity. In the first aspect, some ions can deactivate the excited-state QDs directly. Note that the ECL signals can be quenched through static and dynamic mechanisms, as with PL signals. For example, the cathodic ECL signal of GQDs can be quenched by Cr6+ through a dynamic quenching effect.55 The electron transfer between negatively charged GQDs and SO4−˙ radicals leads to excited-state GQDs and a strong cathodic signal. According to the collisional deactivation process, the heavy atoms of Cr6+ can collisionally deactivate the excited state of GQDs, resulting in quenching of ECL. Regarding the high activity of QDs in the ECL sensing system, common quenchers (e.g. Hg, Fe, and chinone) can all change the ECL intensity, which can affect the selectivity in further analytical applications.
The second method depends on the effective recognition of different quantities of QDs on the electrode surface. This sensing method is especially employed in immunoassays with QDs as ECL tags or labels.56,57 After the analyte is captured by the functional electrode, QDs are added to recognize the special sites on the analyte or electrode surface. More QDs are conjugated, and stronger ECL intensity is detected. In this sensing model, the major limitation is that the ECL efficiency of QDs is still poorer than those of conventional ECL luminophores (e.g. Ru(bpy)32+). QDs with high ECL efficiency have promising implications. We have developed an ECL biosensor for Escherichia coli O157:H7 detection with N-GQDs as ECL tags.58 The modified electrode showed high specificity to E. coli O157:H7. Accordingly, E. coli O157:H7 polyclonal antibody was labeled with N-GQDs. The bioconjugation of E. coli O157:H7/pAb-N-GQDs on the electrode can generate intensive ECL irradiation with K2S2O8. As a result, E. coli O157:H7 was detected by recording the ECL intensity of the sensing system. For ECL detection of biomolecules and cells, delicate designs affected by steric hindrance and impedance of biorecognition reactions have also been reported.59,60 Because of the hindrance to mass transfer and deceleration of the interfacial electron transfer, the reactions of excited-state QDs are limited and the ECL signal can be reduced.
3.3 Generation or consumption of ECL coreactant
As introduced in the ECL mechanism section, ECL coreactants function as important factors in ECL sensing systems. Therefore, the generation or consumption of ECL coreactant can effectively and readily result in ECL enhancement or quenching of QDs. In this designated sensing methodology, the ECL coreactant must not only assist the ECL reaction of the QDs but must also participate in the specified reaction with the target analyte. The ECL coreactant is a highly reactive chemical substance, such as oxalate ion, peroxydisulfate, hydrogen peroxide, or even dissolved oxygen. Therefore, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are mainly used in these ECL analysis methods. As the term suggests, the generation of coreactant can be designed as “signal-on” ECL analysis with ECL enhancement. For example, CdS QDs with multiwalled carbon nanotubes can react with enzymatically generated H2O2 to produce strong and stable ECL emission.61 In contrast, the ECL coreactant is consumed in “signal-off” sensing systems. For example, the enzymatic reactions of acetylcholinesterase and choline oxidase can consume dissolved O2 to decrease the ECL signals of QDs.62 In fact, the sensing methodology involving the generation or consumption of the ECL coreactant is limited by the high reactivity and the few types of ECL coreactant. On the one hand, the highly reactive ECL coreactant can act upon numerous reactions and target species; however, the selectivity is poor, as with chemiluminescence analysis. On the other hand, only a few ECL coreactants have been described in QD-based sensing reports. We attempted to use diazonium products as a novel coreactant for N-GQDs.63 N-GQDs function as a highly active reagent and catalyst for rapid diazotization of anilines. In the diazotization reaction of nitroaniline, the diazonium product may require faster electron transfer with N-GQDs to generate a strong ECL signal from the N-GQDs.
3.4 Electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET)
Electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) is a nonradiative process whereby energy transfers through long-range dipole–dipole interactions from an excited state donor (D) to a proximal ground state acceptor (A).64 As with fluorescence (or Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET), after absorbing the energy, the acceptor can show brighter luminescence or not emit any luminescence, which is called dark quenching. The energy transfer efficiency depends on the relative orientation of the transition dipoles, the extent of spectral overlap, and the energy transfer distance. In addition to the lack of excitation light source, ECL-RET has some advantages compared with conventional FRET, such as a relatively long distance and initiation of the energy-transfer process by electrochemical potential. Regarding the above advantages, the ECL-RET sensing methodology shows ideal sensitivity and selectivity. Fortunately, QDs, with their unique electrochemical and photophysical properties, show ideal performance not only in FRET, but also in ECL-RET. QDs can function together with various materials (e.g. luminol and Au NPs) as ECL-RET donor–acceptor pairs. More importantly, efficient ECL-RET also occurs between different QDs. For example, Zhu's group used two different sizes of CdSeTe@ZnS–SiO2 QDs as a donor–acceptor pair.65 In order to obtain highly efficient ECL-RET, graded-gap CdSeTe@ZnS–SiO2 QD bilayers were fabricated via layer-by-layer assembly with a short interlayer distance and good spectral overlap. Therefore, excitons from trapped states can be effectively recycled, and the ECL enhancement is more than four times greater than that of the reference. It should be noted that ECL-RET is complicated, and the intrinsic mechanism remains undefined. For example, both ECL-RET and charge transfer can cause ECL quenching. Tang et al. reported that the ECL of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+/2-(dibutylamino)ethanol system can be quenched by various types of QDs independent of the core size and the surface charge of the QDs.66 A competitive relationship between charge transfer and energy transfer exists in the system. It is proposed that charge transfer between QDs and 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol +˙ cationic radicals causes the quenching effect. Furthermore, the electron transfer can be switched to energy transfer by increasing the distance between [Ru(bpy)3]2+/2-(dibutylamino)ethanol and the QDs.
3.5 Surface-enhanced electrochemiluminescence (SEECL) and coreactant roles
When energy transfer occurs between the excitons in QDs and plasmons in a metal surface, both the PL and ECL of QDs near the metal surface can be amplified significantly. ECL enhancement based on localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanoparticles is also called surface-enhanced electrochemiluminescence (SEECL). In contrast to the abovementioned competition between ECL-RET and charge transfer, SEECL (ECL enhancement) and ECL-RET (ECL quenching) are interesting competition pairs in QD-based ECL research. For example, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) played a special role in both SEECL and ECL-RET in a QD-based ECL sensing system with a high extinction coefficient, broad absorption spectrum, and surface plasmon resonance. On the one hand, Au NPs are the most popular acceptor in ECL-RET systems. Au NPs can readily quench the ECL emission of QDs. On the other hand, ECL emission from QDs can induce SPR of Au NPs, and the induced SPR can in turn enhance the ECL response of the QDs. In fact, the competition between SEECL and ECL-RET is distance dependent. ECL-RET is a short-range effect that becomes weak with increasing distance between the QDs and Au NPs. When the separation distance reaches a certain extent, ECL-RET can be negligible, while SEECL has superior influence. Xu's group used ssDNA–AuNP conjugates to design a separation length of ca. 12 nm between CdS QDs and Au NPs.67 Because of the long-distance interaction between the QDs and SPR of Au NPs, 5-fold enhancement of ECL intensity is observed compared to that without Au NPs (as shown in Fig. 5).

Recently, due to their unique surface structures, QDs have been studied not only as ECL luminophores but also as coreactants for conventional ECL luminophores. Although tri-n-propylamine (TPA) can produce strong Ru(bpy)32+ ECL emission, TPA is highly volatile, toxic, and insoluble and has slow oxidation speeds. Clearly, QDs possess many merits, including excellent water dispersibility, low toxicity, large specific surface area, and ease of biofunctionalization. Therefore, QDs can overcome these limitations of TPA. For example, Dong et al. used CdSe QDs as the coreactant in a Ru(bpy)32+ ECL system instead of TPA.68 Because of the electrocatalytic effect of QDs on the oxidation of Ru(bpy)32+, a strong anodic ECL signal of Ru(bpy)32+ was observed at 1.10 V. The ECL spectrum also showed that Ru(bpy)32+ emitted a main anodic ECL signal, and the QDs also generated weak ECL emission with the dissolved oxygen. The mechanism of the ECL process is proposed as follows: Ru(bpy)32+–e → Ru(bpy)33+ (electrochemically oxidized)(9) QD–e → QD+˙ (electrochemically oxidized)(10) Ru(bpy)33+ + QD+˙ → Ru(bpy)32+* + QD (anodic ECL)(11) Ru(bpy)32+* → Ru(bpy)32+ + hν (ECL emission at 600 nm)(12) QD+˙ + O2−˙ → QD* + O2(13) QD* → QD + hν (ECL emission at 550 nm)(14)
Long et al. used CQDs as coreactants for anodic ECL of Ru(bpy)32+.69 The benzylic alcohol units on the surface of the CQDs were oxidized and formed reductive radical intermediates. The reductive radical intermediates could transform Ru(bpy)33+ into Ru(bpy)32+*. As a result, the Ru(bpy)32+/C-dots mixture has a strong ECL signal at +1.15 V. The mechanism of the ECL process is proposed as follows: Ru(bpy)32+ − e → Ru(bpy)33+(15) Ru(bpy)33+ + CQD(C6H5CHOH) → Ru(bpy)32+ + CQD(C6H5CHO)˙ + H+(16) Ru(bpy)33+ + CQD(C6H5CHO)˙ → Ru(bpy)32+* + CQD(C6H5CO) + H+(17) Ru(bpy)32+* → Ru(bpy)32+ + hν(18)
4. Fabrication and modification strategies of QD-based ECL sensors
Effective and reliable fabrication technologies ensure the feasibility and responsiveness of sensing systems and analytical methods. Detailed descriptions and comprehensive reviews of the modification strategies of various QD-based sensors can be found in previous classical papers. Although research regarding modification technologies has accompanied the development of QDs in the last thirty years, many new problems have arisen in the fabrication of QD-based ECL sensors. Three main important issues of QD-based ECL sensors include decreasing the solubility of the QDs, amplifying the ECL efficiency of the QDs, and improving the reproducibility of ECL sensing on the electrode. Therefore, this section focuses on related fabrication and modification strategies of QD-based ECL sensors.
4.1 Ligand exchange and capping
Ligand exchange and capping technologies are common modification methods for QDs. However, research on ECL of QDs with surface state effects is lagging behind, which severely restricts the development of QD-based ECL sensors. Because the electron transfer occurs at the surface of the QDs, their surface energy levels decide their ECL emission behavior. Meanwhile, the surface states have narrower band gaps than the QD cores. Thus, the ECL of the surface traps has a large red shift compared to the PL of the QDs. Therefore, constructing QDs with unpassivated surfaces can provide more flexible ECL properties. For example, Ju et al. used meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid as a stabilizer to cap CdTe QDs.70 Compared with monothiol compound-capped stabilizer, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid has lower solubility and enables QDs to be immobilized on the electrode with a drop-coating method. Moreover, the prepared unpassivated surface of CdTe QDs can produce a low surface energy level (−0.87 V) and a narrow band gap. Therefore, the modified electrode showed stable ECL emission at a low applied potential by surface electron transfer. Hu et al. also found that 2-mercaptoethylamine-capped CdTe QDs and 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdTe QDs have different ECL responses.71 The ECL of MPA-capped CdTe QDs has two peaks at potentials of +1.2 and +1.8 V. Also, there is no ECL response of 2-mercaptoethylamine-capped CdTe QDs due to the amine group in the mercaptoethylamine stabilizer. Wang et al. prepared CdTe QDs capped with GSH and TGA at a molar ratio of 1:3.72 This coordinating combination is more efficient. The short carbon chain TGA could further cap the surface defects of the QDs. Therefore, the ECL intensity and stability of the QDs were improved dramatically. Ding et al. further controlled CdSe@ZnSe QDs via adjusting the ZnSe shell thickness.73 With the growth of the ZnSe capping shell, the size of the CdSe QDs increased from 3 nm to 5 nm. Because ZnSe has a wider band gap and type I band alignment to confine both holes and electrons in CdSe, the thick ZnSe shell capped on the surface of the CdSe QDs increased the potential barriers of the ECL reaction. As a result, the threshold voltage and peak potential of ECL were negatively shifted. Moreover, the maximum ECL of the CdSe@ZnSe QDs was obtained with a core–shell molar ratio of 1:3.
4.2 Polymer encapsulation
The immobilization of QDs on electrodes requires good integration between the QDs and the electrodes. Also, the modified layers should favor electron transfer and the ECL process. Polymer thin film materials have been used as ideal encapsulating materials for modified electrodes in electrochemical analysis and ECL research. Polymer encapsulating methods of QDs can be divided into three classes: direct mixing and casting on electrodes, layer-by-layer deposition, and electropolymerization. For example, QDs can be incorporated into a Nafion membrane by the direct mixed method.74 Nafion is one of the most widely used polymers in electroanalysis. It has outstanding capability to preconcentrate positively charged species. Therefore, positively charged core–shell CdSe/ZnS QDs can be effectively incorporated within Nafion films by electrostatic interactions and then casted on glassy carbon electrodes. The QDs retain their emission properties in the stable and uniform films on GCE electrode surfaces. Other polymers, such as chitosan and poly(allylamin hydrochloride), can also be used to incorporate QDs. Chitosan, which contains amino and hydroxy groups, can be used to disperse QDs. Then, the mixture solution is dropped on the electrode and dried in air to prepare the QDs–polymer.
According to actual work effects, layer-by-layer deposition and electropolymerization are ideal fabrication modification strategies to improve the reproducibility of ECL sensing on electrodes. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) is usually used in the layer-by-layer deposition technique with QDs. The poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) conducting polymer has good film-forming ability with a positive charge. The layer-by-layer deposition technique enables immobilization of multiple kinds of NPs in different layers by electrostatic interactions. In a typical layer-by-layer deposition process, Jie et al. prepared a CdSe QDs–CNTs composite film firstly on the electrode surface.75 Then, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) was electrostatically absorbed onto the CdSe QDs–CNTs/electrode. Finally, Au NPs were assembled onto the CdSe QDs–CNTs/PDDA/electrode surface. The amine groups of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) could also play a key role in the catalysis of the ECL reaction. The electropolymerization technique is a powerful method involving the synthesis of membranes in situ on an electrode surface. The flexible polymer membranes immobilize QDs in the same electropolymerization process. Furthermore, molecularly imprinted polymers or surface imprinted polymers can be prepared in the electropolymerization process. The molecularly imprinted polymers have superior properties, including high selectivity, chemical stability, and low cost. For example, Yang et al. electropolymerized Au NPs–CdSe/ZnS QDs and analyte on an Au electrode by crosslinking the NP aggregates with the bis-aniline bridging units.76 To form the molecularly imprinted polymers, extraction of the bound analyte was performed by shaking the electrodes in PBS solution for 20 min. We used dopamine to electropolymerize a GQDs/polydopamine film on an electrode.58 As shown in Fig. 6, E. coli O157:H7 was immobilized in the polydopamine film in the electropolymerization step and extracted to form the surface-imprinted polymer. Ju's group reported phenol formaldehyde resin polymer-stabilized QDs through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction.77 Phenol formaldehyde resin encapsulation led to uniform spatial distribution of the QDs with controllable surface states. There were two ECL peaks at 537 and 573 nm, which corresponded to the core and surface states of the QDs, respectively.

4.3 Microbead loading
Microbeads are commonly used as ECL luminophores and NP carriers. Microbead-based carriers can be loaded with a large number of ECL luminophores (e.g. Ru(bpy)32+ and QDs). Compared to a single ECL luminophore, microbeads with more luminophores have stronger ECL signals, which can be exploited for signal amplification. For ultra-low concentration detection, signal amplification techniques readily decrease the detection limits in highly sensitive ECL assays. In ECL detection, silica microbeads are a good carrier. The optically transparent silica has good water dispersity and biocompatibility and varied surface functionality. Furthermore, mesoporous silica microbeads have higher specific surface areas, larger pore volumes and chemical inertness. Yuan's group used Ru(bpy)32+-doped silica nanoparticles to label secondary antibodies.78 Based on the strong ECL response of Ru(bpy)32+-doped silica nanoparticles and TPA, an amplification analysis system based on a sandwich-type ECL immunosensor has been constructed. Among microbeads, nanoporous and mesoporous microbeads have attracted considerable attention due to their promising potential abilities. Zhou et al. incorporated mesoporous silica microbeads with CdTe QDs and Au NPs, which were assembled to enhance ECL signal detection, as shown in Fig. 7.79 Because of the large specific surface area and pore volume of mesoporous silica microbeads, the loading number of QDs markedly increased, and a more powerful ECL signal was produced. Further analytical applications with silica microbeads have been summarized and discussed in professional reviews.80 In addition, another method to obtain higher sensitivity and a lower detection limit is amplified quenching of ECL. For example, CdTe QDs can scavenge ECL energy from a CdS:Mn NCs film.81 Also, the quenching efficiency of ECL by CdTe QDs is dependent on the number of QDs. Therefore, the quenching of ECL emission can be amplified by the incorporation of a large number of QDs into the silica matrix. Based on the quenching amplification, a sensor for attomolar detection of thrombin was designed.

4.4 Nanohybrids and nanocomposites
Currently, increasing numbers of nanomaterials and QDs are being combined to form functional nanohybrids and nanocomposites and even fabricate novel ECL sensing systems. Many NPs and other nanostructure materials have been employed in QD-based ECL sensors to amplify the ECL signals of QDs and reduce the ECL applied potential, such as carbon nanotubes, magnetic NPs, and nanosheets. In addition to these nanomaterials, functional polymers (e.g. poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and chitosan) are also used to couple different NPs into nanohybrids and nanocomposites. Furthermore, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanoporous materials have been introduced to design nanohybrids and nanocomposites with expected structures. Due to the advantages of these nanomaterials, nanohybrids and nanocomposites with QDs have opened a new field in ECL detection. It is difficult to obtain a comprehensive snapshot of all nanohybrid and nanocomposite applications in QD-based ECL applications. We will attempt to extract some cross-sectional examples of the development of nanohybrids and nanocomposites with QDs in ECL sensors.
In QD ECL nanocomposites, carbon nanotubes can enhance the ECL of CdS QDs by reducing the injection barrier of electrons to the QDs. Meanwhile, multi-walled carbon nanotubes can also absorb light as black bodies. Therefore, they can act as efficient quenchers in QD-based ECL. For example, Zhang's group developed an ECL immunosensor based on a nanocomposite film of CdS QDs–carbon nanotubes combined with Au nanoparticles–chitosan. Au NPs–chitosan had excellent biocompatibility and stability for biomolecule modification. Moreover, the CdS QDs–carbon nanotubes showed highly intense ECL and good stability. Another example of amplified quenching of ECL from a CdS QDs electrode via CdTe–multi-walled carbon nanotubes was reported.82 As a result, a sandwich ECL immunoassay was accomplished by the multiple signal quenching of the black body-like CdTe–multi-walled carbon nanotubes nanohybrid.
Fe3O4 magnetic NPs show good performance in magnetic separation. In addition, the nontoxic Fe3O4 magnetic NPs have large specific surface areas for binding more biomolecules. Therefore, Fe3O4 magnetic NPs can selectively capture and remove biomolecules from a reaction mixture upon application of a magnetic field, which meets the requirements of clinical assays. Ding's group exploited an ECL immunosensor based on magnetic Fe3O4NP–Au as nanocarriers and CdTe QDs as ECL tags.57 Au NPs on the surface of Fe3O4 magnetic NPs provide plentiful binding sites to immobilize antibodies via strong coordination and electrostatic interactions. The sandwiched immunosensor is fabricated by incubating Fe3O4–Au/antibody1/BSA with antigen and QD-labeled antibody2 successively.
It has been reported that the introduction of polyamidoamine dendrimers in ECL reactions can amplify the signal. Deng and Li designed an ECL immunosensor based on CdTe QDs and polyamidoamine-modified grapheme oxide (CdTe QD–polyamidoamine–grapheme oxide composite) as a bioprobe.83 The electrode surface was coated with Au NP–ZnO nanorods composite film to increase the electronic transmission rate and enhance the ECL intensity. Zhang et al. also designed a sandwich type ECL sensor using CdS QD–polyamidoamine–aptamer as a recognition probe and signal reporter.84 Ke et al. also reported that chitosan can markedly enhance the ECL intensity of CdSe QDs.85 The –NH2 and –OH groups of chitosan can increase the stability and dispersion of QDs. Thus, MoS2 nanosheets with chitosan can load more CdSe QDs and decrease the contact resistance and excitation energy of CdSe QDs, resulting in excellent ECL properties. Wang et al. used a grapheme oxide–chitosan composite with a porous structure to load a higher number of CdSe QDs and provide a large interface for electrode reactions.86 Grapheme oxide can amplify the ECL of QDs. The as-prepared ECL sensor exhibited high ECL intensity and long term stability.
MOFs are advanced hierarchical nanostructures with the merits of large surface area and convenient charge transport. It has been reported that a luminescence-functionalized ruthenium metal–organic framework (Ru-MOF) can both readily transfer electrons to achieve high ECL emission efficiency and amplify quenching effects.87 This study indicates that Ru-MOF nanoflowers-modified electrodes with CdS QDs have stronger ECL generation ability and more stable ECL signals. Fe3O4 magnetic NPs and QDs@PtRu were combined to fabricate a novel ECL immunosensor.88 The nanoporous PtRu alloys are ideal carriers to load large amounts of QDs due to their interconnected skeletal framework. Therefore, QDs@PtRu exhibits good signal amplification. The nanohybrid immunosensor can be conveniently aggregated and separated with a magnet, which is highly necessary in clinical fields.
5. Applications
In this section, we will introduce the main applications of QD-based ECL sensors. These analytical applications integrate the ECL sensing mechanism and sensor fabrication strategies. Especially, QD-based ECL sensors have been shown to have great strengths in ratiometric sensing, multiplex detection and near-infrared analysis. Therefore, we hope not only to show the wide spread and high performance of QD-based ECL detection but also to present some brilliant and enlightening content for future research into QD-based chemical and biological ECL analysis. Because it is difficult to include all the excellent studies on QD-based ECL sensors, we do apologize to the authors of any missing papers.
5.1 Inorganic analysis
In early ECL sensing research, determination of H2O2 was developed based on the direct generation of QDs ECL emission.89 As a known effective coreactant, H2O2 participates in the ECL reaction of QDs. Thus, the ECL intensity of the QDs is linearly proportional to the concentration of H2O2. Similar to their photoluminescence properties, the ECL emission of QDs can be quenched dramatically by some metal ions. Ju's group first reported a CdTe QD-based ECL sensor for metal ions (Cu2+).70 Because the Cu–S interaction is stronger than the Cd–S bond, the thermodynamic tendency of Cu–S formation on the CdTe QD surface quenched the ECL of the QDs. Based on the similar high affinity of –COOH groups with metal ions on the surface of the QDs, Pb2+ can change the surface properties of CdSe/ZnS QDs and have the strongest quenching effect.90
Currently, many ions and anions are being detected by QD-based ECL sensing with more complex and ingenious designs. For example, Song et al. developed a CdTe QD-based turn-on ECL sensing system for Cd2+ detection.91 At first, S2− was bound on the surface of QDs. The resulting nonradiative recombination pathway led to ECL quenching. With the addition of Cd2+, the ECL of the QDs increased due to Cd–S passivation layers on the surface of the QDs. Hg2+ also can be detected via a CdSe QD-based ECL competitive immunoassay.92 Hg2+ and the methylmercury-6-mercaptonicotinic acid-ovalbumin coating antigen on the electrode competed for the binding sites of QD-labeled monoclonal antibody. Therefore, the decrease in the ECL intensity of the QDs was linearly related to the logarithm of the Hg2+ concentration. Wang and Guo utilized the dual ECL peak of carbon dots for iron ion detection.93 As shown in Fig. 8, the two emission signals arise from different ECL mechanisms. One ECL signal is due to the electron-transfer reaction between the coreactants and reduced carbon dots. The other ECL signal is produced from ion annihilation reactions, which induce direct formation of exciplexes. As with the internal standard method, the ratio of dual ECL intensity has a linear relationship to the concentration of iron ions.

Zhou et al. reported a CdTe QD-based thin film for nitrite analysis.94 CdTe QDs were combined with Co–Al-layered double hydroxide NPs via a layer-by-layer process. The ECL sensor with twelve QD layers showed strong anodic ECL intensity. This is attributed to the electrochemical oxidation inhibition mechanism. The quenching effect of nitrite on the ECL emission was employed for nitrite determination. The modified electrode also exhibits reversible transformation of the emissive intensity in the temperature range of 20 °C to 80 °C. Pan et al. also assembled six bilayer films with hemoglobin and multiwall carbon nanotubes–CdS QDs nanocomposite on chitosan-modified glassy carbon electrode for nitrite analysis.95 The ECL intensity decreased with the addition of nitrite. The ECL-RET between luminol and CdTe QDs can also be enhanced by oxygen.96 Due to the adsorption and catalysis of QDs for luminol and the formation of singlet oxygen, trace oxygen can be detected with a detection limit of 5 μg L−1.
5.2 Organic compound detection
Similar to the development of QD-based ECL sensing in inorganic analysis, early research into QD-based sensors for organic compound detection also used the analyte directly as a coreactant. For example, Dong's group developed ECL sensors based on oxidation of QDs to detect amines.97 They found that both aliphatic alkyl and hydroxy groups could enhance the ECL intensity of the QDs. As shown in Fig. 9, because 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol (DBAE) has the strongest ability to enhance the ECL response of CdTe QDs, the CdTe QD-based ECL sensor can detect DBAE at a relatively low potential. Recently, organic compound detection with QD-based ECL sensors has been mainly used in environmental analysis. A solid ECL-RET trinitrotoluene sensor was designed with luminal-layered double hydroxide NPs and CdTe QDs.98 Thus, ECL-RET occurred from luminol to the QDs. Following the addition of trinitrotoluene, the ECL intensity decreased. Electron transfer resistance, the reaction with the excited-state luminophore, and the electrochemical reduction of trinitrotoluene may cause this ECL quenching. Yang et al. used a CdSe/ZnS QD-based ECL sensor to detect a chlorinated herbicide, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid.74 The presence of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid in the environment is potentially hazardous to human health. Au NPs and CdSe/ZnS QDs were first electropolymerized on an Au electrode. Then, binding affinity for 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid was provided via molecularly imprinted polymers with specific imprinted sites. 2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid, which contains electron-withdrawing groups, can function as an electron acceptor. Therefore, electrons can transfer from the conductive bond of the excited state of the QDs to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid. As a result, addition of 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyaceticacid can quench the ECL intensity of the QDs. Wang et al. used g-CNQDs ECL to detect the content of riboflavin.99 Quenched ECL of the g-CNQDs was observed based on the ECL-RET between g-CNQDs (as the donor) and riboflavin (as the receptor). The proposed method has a lower minimum detection limit (0.63 nM) than fluorescence methods.

Fu et al. developed a dual-potential ratiometric ECL sensor to detect dopamine.49 Graphene-CdTe QDs function as the cathodic ECL luminophore, and self-enhanced Ru(II) composite functions as the anodic ECL luminophore. The ratiometric aptasensor can provide two self-calibration ECL signals (QDs and Ru(II)) to eliminate most ambiguous interference from the variable external environment, which gives more precise results than single-signal ECL measurement. With the addition of dopamine, Cu2O NPs and self-enhanced Ru(II) composite can be loaded at the electrode. On the one hand, the anodic ECL signal from self-enhanced Ru(II) can be activated. On the other hand, Cu2O NPs catalyze the reduction reaction of oxygen, which quenches the cathodic ECL signal of the QDs with dissolved O2 as the coreactant.
5.3 Immunoassays and aptasensing
In fact, current and future development of ECL sensing is mainly focusing on clinical diagnosis, especially immunoassays and aptasensing. In these immunosensor and aptasensor applications, the selectivity usually depends on the specificity and binding ability of immunological reactions or aptamers. Currently, many functional proteins (e.g. thrombin), tumor markers, and pathogenic genes in clinical analysis can be detected with ECL methods. For example, tumor markers can reflect the presence of a tumor, enable judgment of curative effects, and reflect the progression of illness. Early detection of tumor markers plays a significant role in clinical diagnosis. Ding et al. designed a double signal amplified immunosensor for ultrasensitive carcinoembryonic antigen detection.100 Carcinoembryonic antigens are a type of glycoprotein in colorectal cancer tissue; they are mainly present in the origin of the germ layer within cancers of the digestive system. In this sensor, the ECL of the CdSe@ZnS QDs can be initially enhanced by TiO2 NPs. After sandwich immunoreaction, polydopamine-decorated Au NPs cause proportional quenching of the ECL of the QDs with carcinoembryonic antigen. A detection limit of 0.35 pg mL−1 can be obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen. Han's group fabricated a ratiometric ECL thrombin aptasensor with near-infrared CdTe/CdS QDs and luminol.101 The formation of a three-dimensional G-quadruplex between the aptamer and thrombin triggered ECL-RET between the near-infrared CdTe QDs and the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, the nanocomposite can catalyze H2O2 to greatly enhance luminol ECL. As a result, as shown in Fig. 10, the cathodic ECL signal from near-infrared QDs decreased and the anodic ECL signal from luminol simultaneously increased. This aptasensor not only provides ratiometric ECL signals (QDs and luminol) to eliminate environment interference, but also emits near-infrared light with strong penetrative ability through whole blood and further minimizes tissue autofluorescence. It is thus clear that this ratiometric ECL aptasensor demonstrates ultrasensitive and accurate analytical performance to detect thrombin with a detection limit of 4.2 fg mL−1. More typical immunoassay applications of QD-based ECL sensors are shown in Table 2.

Dong et al. obtained strong cathodic ECL of Si QDs with K2S2O8 as a coreactant for DNA detection.119 This ECL biosensor can be used to detect DNA in the range of 0.1 fM to 1 pM based on the ECL-RET between Si QDs and Au NPs. Yuan and Cai designed a ECL-RET sensor with (Ru(dcbpy)32+) and CdSe@ZnS QDs in one nanostructure for microRNA-141 detection.120 The combined nanostructure can reduce energy loss and improve the ECL efficiency of QDs in ECL-RET with a short path of energy transmission. Furthermore, a double-output conversion strategy was developed to transfer trace microRNA-141 to a large amount of reporter DNA, resulting in an increase of the ECL intensity of Se@ZnS QDs. Thus, 100 aM to 10 pM miRNA-141 could be detected, with a detection limit of 33 aM.
As mentioned above, QDs have different colored optical signals and can be excited synchronously. Therefore, multi-color QDs have been used in multiplex fluorescence detection. Currently, researchers are attempting to design multiplex ECL analyses with QDs as a luminophore candidate. For example, Guo et al. used QDs525 and QDs625 to construct a multiplex ECL immunoassay for simultaneous determination of two different tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen.115 In the sandwich immunocomplex, QDs525 and QDs625-labeled secondary anti-alpha-fetoprotein and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibodies can be captured on the electrode to monitor tumor markers and produce ECL signals. We also prepared a multiplex ECL sensor to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) DNA with multicolor CdTe QDs.121 QDs551-captured DNAHBV and QDs607-captured DNAHCV were fixed on the electrode. After the target DNA hybridized with CdTe QDs-captured DNA, Au NPs–probe DNA hybridized with the unreacted site of CdTe QDs-captured DNA and then quenched the CdTe QD ECL intensity. Note that unlike ratiometric ECL signals, which are controlled by electrode potential, multiplex ECL analysis requires band-pass filters to separate the different wavelengths of each kind of QD ECL.
5.4 Cytosensors
Ju's group initiated QD-based ECL cytosensing with in situ label-free ECL analysis.122 CdS QDs were immobilized on a carbon nanotubes-modified electrode via a layer-by-layer method and then functionalized with mannan. Competitive recognition of mannan-CdS QDs and concanavalin A occurred on the mannan-expressed cell surface. The bound Con A could inhibit the ECL signal of the CdS QDs. When BGC cells were added to compete with the mannan-CdS QDs to bind concanavalin A, the ECL signal of the QDs was restored. In fact, the extent of expression of cell surface carbohydrates determined the magnitude of the QD ECL recovery. Yang's group performed many interesting studies on QD-based ECL cytosensors, including early apoptosis detection, mutiplex cytosensing, and single-cell analysis. In an early apoptosis detection study, similar in situ label-free ECL analysis was carried out.123 The CdS QDs were firstly immobilized on a polyaniline nanofibers-modified sensor via a layer-by-layer method. Then, Annexin V was loaded on the surface of the CdS QDs/polyaniline nanofibers. The ECL cytosensor was based on the specific interaction between Annexin V and phosphatidylserine. The interaction could enable early apoptotic cells to be captured on the CdS-QDs/polyaniline nanofibers, which resulted in steric effects on the ECL reaction with the co-reactants. Therefore, a lower ECL signal could be observed. They further used Au@luminol and CdS QDs as ECL luminophores to label concanavalin A and epidermal growth factor for multiple analysis of cell surface receptors.124 First, polyaniline nanofibers and Au NP-modified indium tin oxide electrodes were prepared via electropolymerization. Then, human mucin1 protein aptamer was immobilized onto the Au NPs to subsequently capture human mucin1 protein aptamer-positive MCF-7 cells. In the detection process, Au@luminol–concanavalin A and CdS QDs-epidermal growth factor could label the captured cells in two spatially resolved areas. Furthermore, QDs and luminol ECL signals were provided at −1.2 V and +0.5 V during one potential scan, respectively.
Recently, a single-cell ECL analysis platform with zinc-coadsorbed CQDs for breast cancer cell detection and CD44 expression level evaluation was reported.125 The zinc-coadsorbed CQDs were synthesized through coadsorption of zinc and self-prepared CQDs. Due to the good conductivity of metals and changes in the surface states of the CQDs, the zinc-coadsorbed CQDs had 120-fold ECL amplification compared to CQDs. The electrode was modified with folic acid to capture cancer cells (shown in Fig. 11). Then, the functionalized zinc-co adsorbed CQDs could label the captured cells though specific recognition of CD44. Even single or few cancer cells can be detected with this ECL analysis platform.

6. Summary and outlook
As presented above, QD-based ECL sensors have shown great power and numerous advantages in analytical and bioanalytical applications. QD-based ECL sensors are a novel analytical platform with potential superiority to conventional analysis, including excellent selectivity and high sensitivity. The research field of QD-based ECL sensors involves several disciplines, such as materials science, nanotechnology, optics, and electrochemistry.
However, research regarding QD-based ECL sensors is in the initial stage. There are several challenges in the development process of QD-based ECL sensors. Some intrinsic issues require further study, especially the stability of the nanocomposites on the electrode and the low ECL efficiency of QDs. On the one hand, modified electrodes always undergo undesirable changes with a series of interferences (e.g. design scheme, preparation technique, matrix ionic strength and pH), which may influence the reliability of sensing systems. On the other hand, because of the unclear ECL mechanism of QDs, the relationship of ECL behavior to the components and structures of QDs should be investigated deeply. Therefore, basic research regarding the ECL mechanism of QDs and electrode modification methods is still required to simultaneously improve electrode stability and ECL signals.
Regarding ECL analysis methods, further studies should focus on the development of QD-based sensors with high performance and reliable detection. The design of QD-based nanocomposites has furnished sensing systems with ECL signal amplification, excellent stability, and high selectivity of the sensing system. As discussed in the review, increasing numbers of nanomaterials have been incorporated in QD-based sensors. The QD-based ECL sensors can be used not only for ECL detection but also for sample separation and concentration. In addition to the development of the design of the QD-based ECL sensing systems, innovation of advanced instruments is urgently needed to enable the collaboration of technologies and QD-based ECL sensors. Only a few ECL analytical instruments have been reported. Moreover, QD-based in vitro and in vivo ECL assays lag far behind in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging and detection. Therefore, portable equipment, visual technology, and multiplex assays will be a new stream of research which has great exploration significance and commercial value in the application of QD-based ECL sensors. Because little is known regarding QD-based in vitro or in vivo ECL technology, deeper understanding of ECL analysis methods and QD technology is still needed.
From the point of view of QD research, exploration of the preparation of novel QDs is ongoing. To date, most QDs used in ECL analysis are conventional NPs in the nanomaterial field. Although the traditional synthesis methods of QDs can satisfy basic ECL research requirements, the preparation of ideal QDs with high ECL efficiencies and low cathodic potentials is still a critical step. Compared with traditional fluorescence, the application of QD-based ECL sensors in bioanalysis and clinical diagnostics requires further study. It is expected that QD-based ECL sensing systems will be used in more creative applications in the near future. Extensive efforts will be made to explore the properties and ECL performance of more efficient QD-based ECL sensors. Due to their unique optical and electrochemical properties, QD-based ECL sensors can be used in biomedical applications as a novel type of nanoprobe.
