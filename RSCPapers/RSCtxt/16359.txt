    , Accepted 15th June 2017First published on 15th June 2017AbstractConjugated polymers (CPs) with intensive near-infrared (NIR) absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) have emerged as a new generation of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents for cancer therapy. PTT + chemotherapy has been identified as a powerful modality to offer synergistic effects in the destruction and monitoring of cancer tissues. In this study, diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymers (DPP) were designed through a combination of donor–acceptor moieties. Then, doxorubicin (DOX) and DPP were co-encapsulated in tocopheryl polyethylene-glycol-succinate-cholesterol (TPGS-CHO) copolymers to build a combined theranostic system for tumor treatment. These combined NPs with high PCE (∼50%) and strong (NIR) absorption exhibit excellent real-time photoacoustic imaging detection and synergistic cancer inhibition.
1. Introduction
To systemically track a nanodrug and improve clinical therapeutic efficacy, theranostic nanomaterials, especially those combining multi-mode therapeutic and diagnostic functions within a nanoparticle, are urgently needed.1–4 However, the theranostic agents should have balanced imaging and therapeutic efficacy.5 Generally, the integration of imaging and therapeutic agents is not a natural fit. Thus, it is difficult to regulate and control the best ratio between imaging and therapeutic agents. A nanomaterial that possesses the intrinsic properties of both imaging and therapy seems perfect as a nanotheranostic agent. Moreover, real-time imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive scientific research interest.6,7 Nanoparticles (NPs) can absorb near-infrared (NIR, λ = 700–1100 nm) light in the interior of targeted tumors and generate an acoustic signal via thermal expansion that is suitable for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) application.8–10 Commonly used NIR photothermal agents are inorganic nanomaterials, which are difficult to be degraded or excreted in a biological environment.11,12 Therefore, it is critical to exploit NIR-absorbing organic nanomaterials for reducing the adverse effects due to the long term use of photothermal treatment.13,14 Recently, conjugated polymeric nanoparticles have shown promise as photothermal coupling agents due to their high photothermal transformation efficiency, robust photostability, good biocompatibility, and low expense.15,16 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers are widely used in polymer solar cells.17,18 Due to the push–pull structure of the DPP-based copolymers, their maximum absorption covers the ideal phototherapeutic window (from 800 to 850 nm), which enables light to perfectly reach high penetration depth to the targeted tumors and results in excellent photothermal conversion efficiency.19,20 This type of conjugated polymer can potentially serve as an alternative agent in PTT for effective cancer treatment. However, the application of a DPP-based conjugated copolymer, especially in combination with other treatment strategies, in PAI-guided phototherapy has not been reported and deserves further investigation.
Compared to various combination therapies, PTT + chemotherapy has been regarded as an optimized project to provide synergistic effects in the destruction and monitoring of cancer tissues.21–23 A combination of PPT and doxorubicin (DOX) showed synergistically higher therapeutic efficacy.24 Herein, NIR-absorptive tocopheryl polyethylene-glycol-succinate-cholesterol (TPGS-CHO) polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully developed by entrapping DPP-based conjugated polymers (DPP) and doxorubicin (DOX). TPGS has been approved in drug delivery systems as a pharmaceutically safe adjuvant.25 As a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E (VE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1000, TPGS has advantages that include prolonged drug half-life, enhanced cellular uptake, and inhibition of P-glycoprotein to improve bioavailability.26 Thus, the designed co-encapsulated NPs (DOX/DPP-NPs) can provide longer circulation time, greater EPR-induced accumulation at the tumor site, and a photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal/chemo combined therapeutic system (Scheme 1). It has great potential application in anticancer therapy.

2. Experimental
2.1. Cell culture
A HepG2 cell line was obtained from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products. Cells were grown in a DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.
2.2. 
          In vitro cellular uptake and chemo-photothermal treatment
HepG2 cells were maintained in 6-well plates. After incubation for 24 h, the culture media were withdrawn and culture media containing DOX/DPP-NPs were supplemented to confirm that the final DOX concentration was 10 μg mL−1. After incubation for 2 or 4 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4). Subsequently, the cells were stained with DAPI for 15 min. The cellular localization was visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (ZEISS LSM780, Germany). Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively study the cell internalization of DOX. Internalization signals were analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Japan).
HepG2 cells (1 × 104 cells per well) were seeded into a 96 well plate for the quantitative evaluation of the chemo-photothermal treatment efficacy of the DOX/DPP-NPs. These cells were incubated in 200 μL of medium with different NPs but containing the same concentration of the drug. The cells were irradiated with a 1.5 W cm−2 808 nm laser for 5 min for chemo-photothermal treatments. For chemotherapy alone, the cells were not exposed to laser. After 48 h, cell viability was quantified via the MTT assay.
To further visualize the cytotoxicity of the chemothermal, photothermal, and chemophotothermal treatment, HepG2 cells were seeded into 24 well plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and incubated overnight. The cells were then replaced with fresh media containing different NPs. After 24 h of incubation, cells treated with DPP were exposed to the 808 nm laser (1.5 W cm−2). The group treated with PBS and laser irradiation served as a control. After another 4 h, cells were washed with PBS and stained with calcein-AM for visualization of the live cells and with PI for visualization of the dead/late apoptotic cells. The cells were examined via an inverted florescence microscope system (Olympus, Japan).
The cytotoxicity of the chemo-photothermal treatment was also evaluated via quantification of the apoptotic HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 cells per well in 6 well plate and cultured overnight. Cells were treated with PBS, blank NPs, DPP-NPs, and DPP-NPs + laser (3 W cm−2, 5 min). To detect cell apoptosis, HepG2 cells were obtained. Then, the cells were stained using an annexin V-FITC and a PI staining kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The induction of apoptosis in HepG2 cells was examined using a flow cytometer.
Total cellular proteins were extracted from the cells treated with PBS + laser, DOX-NPs, DPP-NPs + laser, and DOX/DPP-NPs + laser using the cell lysis buffer from cell signaling technology. The protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay kit. The effects of chemo-photothermal treatment on the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were determined by western blotting.27,28
2.3. Animal xenograft model
Male BALB/C nude mice (4–6 weeks old, 18–22 g) were purchased from the Center for Experimental Animals, Jilin University. The mice were treated under protocols approved by the School of Life Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee of Northeast Normal University. The HepG2 tumor models were successfully established via the subcutaneous injection of 5 × 106 cells suspended in 100 μL PBS.
2.4. 
          In vivo imaging and biodistribution analysis
BALB/C nude mice-bearing HepG2 tumors were injected with DOX/DPP-NPs via tail vein. After 24 h, mice were irradiated by NIR laser (808 nm, 1 W cm−2) for 5 min. The temperature change in the tumor region under laser irradiation was obtained using an IR camera.
Photoacoustic imaging was performed using a MSOT scanner equipped with 128 ultrasound transduce elements (MSOT inVision 128, iThera Medical GmbH, Munich, Germany). Photoacoustic imaging at different times after injection was carried out using the MSOT system when the tumors were exposed to 808 nm laser light.
DOX and DOX-NPs were injected into tumor-bearing mice via tail vein with a dose of 3.0 mg kg−1 DOX equivalent. The mice were sacrificed at 2, 6, or 24 h post-injection. The major organs were immediately excised and subsequently washed three times with PBS for ex vivo imaging of the DOX fluorescence using the in vivo imaging system (Berthold, Germany).
2.5. 
          In vivo antitumor efficacy and histology analysis
The mice were directly injected via tail vein with different formulations (3.0 mg kg−1 DOX equivalent): (1) PBS; (2) PBS + laser; (3) blank NPs; (4) free DOX; (5) DOX-NPs; (6) DOX/DPP-NPs; (7) DPP-NPs + laser; and (8) DOX-DPP-NPs + laser. Laser treatment was conducted at 24 h after injection. For the laser treatment groups, the tumors of mice were exposed to a 808 nm laser of power density 1 W cm−2 for 5 min. Twice injections were performed on the first day and fifth day. Quantitative changes in the tumor volume and body weight of mice were measured. The tumor volume was calculated as length × width2/2.
To further confirm the effect of mediated chemo-photothermal therapy in vivo, tumor tissues at 2 h and the major organs (liver, lung, kidney, heart, and spleen) at 20 d after first treatment were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and characterization of the NPs
Based on previous literature, conjugated polymers (poly (diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiophene)) were synthesized.29 Then, TPGS-CHO NPs were prepared by the reaction of TPGS and cholesteryl chloroformate. The successful syntheses were confirmed by 1H NMR (Fig. 1A and B). The physicochemical characteristics of the NPs were examined via dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2A show that the diameter (Dh) measured by DLS at pH 7.4 was around 110 nm, which corresponded with the data of TEM. TEM demonstrates that the spherical NPs have a mean diameter of around 80 nm (Fig. 2B).

(D) Images of the nanoparticles solutions. (E) Time-dependent release of DOX from DOX/DPP-NPs. (F) Surface zeta potential of nanoparticles. The data are represented as a mean ± SD (n = 3). 
Subsequently, DOX, DPP, and DOX/DPP were loaded into the TPGS-CHO NPs. The drug loading content (DLC) and drug loading efficiency (DLE) of the NPs are crucial for their clinical application. The DLC of DOX-NPs and DPP-NPs was 5.34% and 1.82%, with a DLE of 58.74% and 38.22%, respectively. In dual-drug loaded NPs, the DLC and DLE were 4.32% and 49.68% for DOX, and 1.67% and 38.41% for DPP, respectively. Clearly, the values of both the DLC and DLE of DOX/DPP-NPs for DOX or DPP are slightly lower than those of DOX-NPs or DPP-NPs.

Fig. 2C presents the UV-vis spectra of NPs in PBS at pH 7.4. Both DPP-NPs and DOX/DPP-NPs exhibit a broad absorption from 700 to 1000 nm, and the maximum absorption peak was slightly higher than 808 nm. Thus, the DPP-NPs and DOX/DPP-NPs can be hopefully used as NIR absorbing photothermal agents. The colors of the DOX-NP, DPP-NP, and DOX/DPP-NP solutions were light red, light green, and brown, respectively (Fig. 2D). Drug release of the DOX/DPP-NPs with or without 808 nm laser stimulation was also studied. As shown in Fig. 2E, up to 60% of DOX was released from the DOX/DPP-NPs in PBS at pH 7.4 after 48 h; there is no obvious difference between the release rate of the DOX/DPP-NPs with and without the 808 nm laser. The results demonstrate that DOX/DPP-NPs have potential as sustained release antitumor drug delivery vehicles. In addition, the surface charge of the blank NPs was −16.3 mV ± 0.62 mV, whereas the zeta potentials of the DPP-NPs, DOX-NPs, and DOX/DPP-NPs were −15.9 ± 0.74 mV, −12.6 ± 0.43 mV and −11.3 ± 0.56 mV, respectively (Fig. 2F).
Next, the photo-thermal properties of the DOX/DPP-NPs were emphatically tested and studied. The temperature variations of the DOX/DPP-NPs solution were examined with the 808 nm NIR laser at various power densities. As exhibited in Fig. 3A, the temperature markedly increased with the increasing laser intensity. Temperature evolution with various concentrations was also examined under laser irradiation. The temperature of the 1.0 mg mL−1 DOX/DPP-NPs solution increased from 19 °C to 47 °C upon laser irradiation for 10 minutes. In contrast, the temperature of deionized water just increased from 19 °C to 29 °C (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency of NPs was calculated to be ∼50% (Fig. 3C and D), which is higher than those of Au NRs (21%), black phosphorus (28.4%), and melanin nanospheres (40%).30–32 In addition, thermal images of DOX/DPP-NPs are shown in Fig. 3E; the temperature of the DOX/DPP-NPs solution increased with time. These results demonstrate that the DOX/DPP-NPs have excellent NIR photothermal effect and great potential for use in thermal imaging and photoacoustic imaging.

3.2. 
          In vitro cellular uptake and chemo-photothermal treatment
In this study, the intracellular internalization of DOX/DPP-NPs was analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry. As displayed in Fig. 4A, the cells cultured with DOX/DPP-NPs for 4 h showed stronger red fluorescence intensity than those incubated for 2 h. The result of flow cytometry is consistent with that of the CLSM (Fig. 4B). All the abovementioned results confirmed that the NPs functioned to deliver drugs into the HepG2 cells.

(B) Flow cytometric profiles of HepG2 cells incubated with DPP/DOX-NPs with a 808 nm laser at 3 W cm−2 for 5 min. (C) In vitro evaluation of HepG2 cell viabilities. (D) FL images of the HepG2 cells after different treatment. Viable cells were stained green with calcein-AM, and dead/later apoptosis cells were floating and eluted, or stained red with PI. The data are represented as a mean ± SD (n = 3; **p < 0.01). 
Next, standard MTT was employed to verify and quantify the combined therapeutic effect (Fig. 4C). After treatment with formulas, obvious cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition of HepG2 cells were observed. Note that the death rate of the HepG2 cells was significantly increased after 5 min laser irradiation for DOX/DPP-NPs versus those without laser irradiation. The combined treatment of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy exerted stronger antiproliferative effects on HepG2 cells than the individual treatments.
Live/dead assay was performed to further demonstrate the highly effective in vitro cytotoxicity of the DOX/DPP-NPs. After treatment, the HepG2 cells were co-stained with calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Calcein AM) and propidium iodide (PI) to distinguish live and dead cells (Fig. 4D). The cells incubated with PBS show no observable cytotoxicity upon irradiation, whereas the cells treated with DOX/DPP-NPs + laser were mostly killed upon the combined action of PTT and chemotherapy. The result was consistent with that of the MTT assay.
Apoptosis, a programmed cell death, has an essential influence on development. After treatment, HepG2 cells were double-labeled with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) and analysed using flow cytometry to reveal the cell death mechanism of the NPs in PTT. As displayed in Fig. 5A and B, the percentage of total apoptotic cells (including early and late apoptosis) treated with the DPP-NPs plus irradiation increased dramatically to ∼58%. This was much more than that in the control group (∼3%) and suggested that DPP-NPs with irradiation were potentially and effectively used for PTT.

Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) is regarded as an executioner of the apoptotic pathway and its activation is required for the induction of apoptosis.33,34 The significant inhibition of DOX-assisted photothermal therapeutic towards HepG2 cells was once again verified via western blot analyses of the level of cleaved caspase-3 and full length caspase-3 after treatment. The highest levels of cleaved caspase-3 appeared in the DOX/DPP-NPs + laser group (Fig. 5C). A caspase-dependent program was clearly activated by the PTT treatment, and the DOX released from the DOX/DPP-NPs improved the effect.
3.3. 
          In vivo imaging and biodistribution
A thermal imaging camera was used for measuring the in vivo photothermal effect produced by the DOX/DPP-NPs. After 24 h intravenous injection of DOX/DPP-NPs, mice irradiated by the 808 nm laser had rapid tumor heating from 34 °C to 47 °C in 5 minutes (Fig. 6A). The temperature was held at 34 °C for DOX/DPP-NPs without irradiation. Moreover, no obvious temperature increase is detected from the control group (PBS) illuminated with the 808 nm laser. These results indicate that DOX/DPP-NPs have great potential applications in photothermal therapy and thermal imaging.

The area in the white circle is the tumor. (E) FL images of the major organs and tumors after injection of DOX and DOX/DPP-NPs at 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h. 
Furthermore, biodistribution of the DOX/DPP-NPs was monitored by photoacoustic imaging (Fig. 6B–D). The mice with HepG2 tumors were intravenously injected with DOX/DPP-NPs (3 mg kg−1 DOX). The highest PA signal was found in the livers. The PA signals in the liver were enhanced in 6 h and weakened in 24 h due to metabolism and clearance. Compared to the PA signal in the liver, the PA signal in the tumor was increased at all times, which demonstrated that DOX/DPP-NPs had a long circulation time and accumulated in tumors, ascribed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Thus, 24 h after the intravenous injection of DOX/DPP-NPs may be regarded as a proper time for performing PTT.
The ex vivo fluorescence images of the isolated major organs and tumors at 2, 6, or 24 h after injection of DOX/DPP-NPs through tail vein were obtained for the nude mice bearing HepG2 tumors. As shown in Fig. 6E, liver and tumor had slight DOX fluorescence at 2 h after injection. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of DOX/DPP-NPs in liver and tumor was higher than that of free DOX at 6 h. At 24 h post-injection, more signal was seen in the tumor and the liver for the DOX/DPP-NPs group, whereas the free DOX group had little signal due to liver metabolism. These data reveal that DOX/DPP-NPs are enriched in the tumor region as compared to free DOX, which might imply a stronger antitumor function in vivo.
3.4. 
          In vivo combinatory antitumor activity and histology analysis
In view of the multimodal imaging data, the PTT treatment was conducted at 24 h after intravenous injection of NPs. Irradiation was performed with the 808 nm laser (1 W cm−2, 5 min). Therapeutic effects were evaluated by detecting of the change in the tumor volume (Fig. 7A) and body weight (Fig. 7B). After treatment finished, images of the mice (Fig. 7C) and tumors (Fig. 7D) were obtained, and the tumor weights (Fig. 7E) were investigated. No tumor growth inhibition or tumor tissue necrosis was observed in the group with NIR only, suggesting that the power intensity was too low to have a photothermal effect. The blank TPGS-CHO NP group displayed a little therapeutic effect, suggesting that TPGS may, to some extent, inhibit growth of the tumors. Slight inhibition of tumor growth was seen in DOX-NPs or DOX/DPP-NPs groups, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. These two groups displayed better therapeutic effects than pure DOX, resulting from enhanced EPR-induced intratumoral accumulation. Tumors treated with DPP-NPs and DOX/DPP-NPs plus laser irradiation showed complete remission, leaving black scabs at the original site, which fell off about 10 days later. Moreover, four mice in the DPP-NPs group presented tumor recurrence over 20 days. Surprisingly, no tumor recurrence appeared in the DOX/DPP-NPs + laser group. These findings confirm that DPP-NPs has great potential for in vivo PTT cancer treatment. Furthermore, the combination of PTT with chemotherapy shows obvious anti-tumor effect as compared to single treatment alone.

To further investigate the antitumor effect of DOX/DPP-NP-mediated chemo-photothermal therapy in vivo, the tissue of the tumors (2 h after first treatment) and major organs (20 d treatment) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and emosin. The DPP-NPs and DOX/DPP-NPs plus laser irradiation groups showed typical features of thermal damage, including coagulative necrosis and obvious nucleocytoplasmic separation (Fig. 7F). Moreover, there was no obvious abnormality in the major organs (Fig. 8), suggesting no obvious toxicity during the experiment, which benefit from only twice treatments rather than repeated treatments.

4. Conclusion
In summary, DPP-based conjugated polymer was co-encapsulated with DOX in TPGS-CHO NPs to realize photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal/chemo combined therapy. The combination therapy showed greater toxicity than either chemotherapy or PTT alone in vitro. Furthermore, biodistribution of co-encapsulated NPs was monitored by photoacoustic imaging, suggesting the proper initiation time of PTT. It was surprising that complete remission was observed in mice treated with co-encapsulated NPs plus laser. This may be attributed to the high photothermal conversion efficiency of DPP and synergistic effect of the combination of DPP and DOX. This work provides new strategies for the design and construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms for precise imaging-guided combined treatment.
