    , Accepted 16th May 2019First published on 20th May 2019AbstractTo achieve efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs), it is important to overcome the energy loss (Eloss) from the optical bandgap to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device by properly matching donor/acceptor (D/A) photovoltaic materials. Here, we develop efficient PSCs based on the absorption complementary pairs of halogenated polymer donors (PM6 and PM7) and an asymmetrical non-fullerene acceptor (IDT6CN-M). The D/A pairs of PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M show very small highest occupied molecular orbital offsets (ΔEHOMO) of 0.10 and 0.08 eV due to the fact that the halogenation decreases the HOMO levels of polymers, which helps the PSCs achieve a high Voc of 1.04 and 1.05 V, and a small Eloss of 0.56 and 0.55 eV, respectively. Our studies show that the D/A pairs have good morphology compatibility, and the related devices have efficient photon capture and exciton dissociation, balanced and efficient charge transfer and extraction processes. As a result, the PSCs based on PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6VN-M achieved the same high device efficiency of 13.3%, which is one of the highest values for single-junction PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V.
1. Introduction
In the past four years, polymer solar cells (PSCs)1–5 have witnessed dramatic progress after tremendous efforts towards the development of new photovoltaic materials (including polymer donors6–9 and n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors10–15) and the optimization of device technology,16–22 and the recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction PSCs have reached 13–15%.23–29 Among the n-OS acceptors, narrow bandgap acceptors with the structure of a fused electron-rich core along with two strong electron-deficient end-groups possess adjustable molecular absorption, energy levels and crystallinity, and have dominated the efficient PSCs.30–38 Presently PSCs achieve short-circuit current density (Jsc) (∼27 mA cm−2)39 comparable to those of inorganic solar cells, and fill factor (FF) (0.75–0.80)21,32 comparable to those of perovskite solar cells. However, the relatively low open-circuit voltages (Voc) (most of which are in the range of 0.85–0.95 V) of PSCs result in a relatively high energy loss (Eloss, is defined as Eoptg − eVoc), which impedes the improvement of device efficiency. Thus, increasing the Voc of the devices would be an effective way to further boost the PCEs.
Recently, an asymmetric non-fullerene acceptor IDT6CN-M with a narrow bandgap and high LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level was developed.32 The research found that the dipole–dipole interactions and favourable anti-parallel molecule arrangements of IDT6CN-M facilitate the formation of stronger π–π stacking with the face-on orientation in the film, which helps the PSCs to achieve the minimization of the trade-off between Voc and Jsc. As a result, the IDT6CN-M-based PSCs achieved higher PCE than its symmetrical analogue-based PSCs. However, although IDT6CN-M has a high HOMO level, the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M-based PSCs still fail to maximize the Voc (0.91 V) and PCE (11.2%) values due to the high HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level of PBDB-T.40
It is known that the Voc of PSCs is proportional to the difference between the ELUMO of the n-OS acceptor and the EHOMO of the polymer donor.1,6 Thus, down-shifting the HOMO level of polymer donors could enhance the Voc and then increase the PCEs of the related PSCs. Recent studies have demonstrated that the introduction of halogens (such as fluorine and chlorine), which could induce a strong dipole along C–F/Cl bonds due to their strong electron-withdrawing ability, leads to down-shifted EHOMO of polymers.23–25,41–44 Moreover, halogenated polymers showed more ordered molecular stacking and increased charge mobility in comparison with their halogen-free counterparts due to the intermolecular non-covalent interactions such as F (Cl)–H (S). For example, the fluorinated polymer PM6 (ref. 42) and chlorinated polymer PM7,44 which were developed by our group, have shown down-shifted HOMO levels, thus promoting the Voc of the devices and consequently, the PCEs were clearly boosted (more than 13.0%) in comparison with halogen-free PBDB-T (the PCE of 5.8%).40 Although high PCEs were achieved for the PM6- and PM7-based devices, the relatively low Voc (less than 0.90 V) indicates that there is still room for further enhancing the PCEs through increasing Voc. Recently, Li1 and McCulloch18et al. found that the Voc of photovoltaic devices increases with the decrease of HOMO level offsets (ΔEHOMO) between the polymer donor and n-OS acceptor. However, in most cases, too small ΔEHOMO will decrease the driving force of hole hopping from the n-OS acceptor to the polymer donor and then restrain the exciton dissociation of devices, which results in increased the trade-off between Voc and Jsc. Recently, Chen et al. found that the occurrence of hole transfer can also be ultrafast on the time scale of ≤4.6 ps for the D:A electron pairs with a very small ΔEHOMO of 0–0.1 eV.45 This suggests that, by reasonably choosing electron pairs, the minimal positive ΔEHOMO may also be enough for hole transfer from A to D. However, highly efficient (PCE > 13%) single-junction PSCs with a Voc higher than 1 V are rarely reported. Since high Voc is urgently needed for achieving high device efficiency and practical applications, the fabrication of highly efficient PSC devices with a Voc higher than 1 V has become a challenging but interesting task and topic.
2. Results and discussion
Here, we developed two efficient PSCs based on fluorinated polymer PM6 or chlorinated polymer PM7 as the donor, and IDT6CN-M as the n-OS acceptor (Fig. 1a). The polymer donors and the n-OS acceptor have complementary absorption spectra in the wide wavelength range of 300–780 nm (Fig. 1b), and matched molecular energy levels with a very small ΔEHOMO of 0.08–0.10 eV (Fig. 1c) in the CV tests due to the halogenation of polymers. To double check ΔEHOMO between the polymers and IDT6CN-M, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. S1,† and the related HOMO levels of PBDB-T, PM6, PM7 and IDT6CN-M are at −5.01, −5.15, −5.20, and −5.29 eV, respectively. Although the HOMO levels of these active layer materials obtained from these two methods are different, these values demonstrate the same trend. Notably, the D:A pairs of PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M still show a very small ΔEHOMO of 0.09–0.14 eV. Moreover, the donors and the acceptor possess excellent morphological compatibility (Fig. 4). These advantages are conducive to achieving high Voc, Jsc and FF in PSCs simultaneously. The PSCs were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers (polymer:IDT6CN-M)/PNDIT-F3N-Br46/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) plots of the IDT6CN-M-based PSCs with different polymer donors, including the control polymer PBDB-T, fluorinated PM6 and chlorinated PM7, are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Compared to the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M-based PSCs with a Voc of 0.93 V, the PSCs based on PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M exhibited a higher Voc of 1.04 and 1.05 V. Usually, the Eloss is defined as Eoptg − eVoc, in which Eoptg is the optical bandgap of the polymer:IDT6CN-M films in this work. As shown in Fig. 2c, these polymer:IDT6CN-M blend films show almost the same absorption onset (λonset) at ∼775 nm, which is consistent with the onset of the EQE curves (Fig. 2b). The corresponding Eoptg is calculated to be 1.60 eV using the formula 1240/λonset, and Eloss is calculated to be 0.67, 0.56, and 0.55 eV for the PSCs based on PBDB-T, PM6 or PM7, respectively. The higher Voc and the lower Eloss are ascribed to the high LUMO level of IDT6CN-M and deep HOMO levels of the donors induced by the halogenation.24,44 Moreover, the optimal PSCs based on PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M achieved the same impressive PCEs of 13.3% with a high Voc of over 1.04 V, a Jsc of more than 16.4 mA cm−2, and a high FF approaching 0.78, while the PSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M displayed a PCE of 11.4% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 16.3 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.759. The average values of photovoltaic parameters calculated from 30 devices of the PSCs are shown in Fig. S2† and Table 1. As far as we know, the PCE of 13.3% is one of the highest values for single-junction PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V (see Fig. 5a). Note that this is the first time to achieve a Voc of over 1.0 V and an FF of over 0.75 simultaneously in single-junction PSCs. Moreover, the PM6- and PM7-based PSCs achieved high Voc (>1.0 V) and Jsc (>16.0 mA cm−2) simultaneously, indicating that halogenation can overcome the Eloss and reduce the trade-off between high Voc and high Jsc in this work.

To evaluate the photons harvesting and charge collection processes, and confirm the accuracy of the Jsc, we performed external quantum efficiency (EQE) tests. As shown in Fig. 2b, the IDT6CN-M-based PSCs exhibited similar EQE response spectra from 300 to 780 nm. Compared to the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M-based device, the PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M-based devices showed slightly improved EQE. Moreover, the PM6- and PM7-based devices also exhibit high EQE values in the range of ca. 600–775 nm which belongs to the absorption region of IDT6CN-M, which means that efficient hole transfer occurred from IDT6CN-M to PM6 or PM7 despite the ΔEHOMO between the halogenated polymer donors and IDT6CN-M being only 0.08–0.10 eV. The integrated Jsc from the EQE plots is 15.8, 16.1 and 16.0 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T-, PM6-, and PM7-based PSCs respectively, which agrees well with the J–V tests. A mismatch range smaller than 4% is reasonable. The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) by the SCLC method were estimated to be 6.32/3.76 × 10−4, 6.17/4.11 × 10−4, and 5.86/3.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the corresponding μh/μe ratios are 1.68, 1.50, and 1.49 for the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M, PM6:IDT6CN-M, and PM7:IDT6CN-M blend films (Fig. 3a and b and Table 2), respectively. The more balanced μh/μe for the PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6CN-M blends are beneficial to suppress the space charge accumulation and thus improve the charge extraction in PSCs.6

By measuring the curves of photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff), the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) were estimated to study the exciton dissociation and charge extraction properties of the PSCs (see Fig. 3c, Table 2 and the section of device characterization in the ESI†).23,47 Under the maximal power output conditions, the PM6- and PM7-based devices showed higher P(E,T) values of 87.1% and 88.1% compared to the PBDB-T-based device (86.0%), which indicates that the halogenated polymer-based PSCs have a higher exciton dissociation rate and more efficient charge extraction processes.25,47 To better understand the charge recombination properties of the devices, the effect of light intensity (P) on Jph was probed as shown in Fig. 3d and Table 2. The relationship between P and Jph can be defined as Jph ∝ PS. The S value would be close to 1 if the device has weak bimolecular recombination.43,47 All the devices exhibited high S values of 0.960–0.975 which are close to 1, suggesting low bimolecular recombination and efficient charge transport in the devices. Moreover, the PM6- and PM7-based PSCs showed higher S values compared to that of the PBDB-T-based PSCs, implying that the halogenation of polymers can decrease the bimolecular recombination of PSCs in this case.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PBDB-T, PM6, PM7, and IDT6CN-M pure films as well as the corresponding blend films were measured (as shown in Fig. 3e and f). In comparison with the PL spectra of the polymers and IDT6CN-M pure films, all the polymer:IDT6CN-M blend films exhibited very high PL quenching efficiencies of over 95% (Fig. 3e), which suggests that the polymers and IDT6CN-M were well compatible in bulk morphologies and that efficient photo-induced charge transfer occurred in the PSCs. Moreover, the blend films showed slightly improved PL quenching efficiencies from PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M to PM6:IDT6CN-M and then to PM7:IDT6CN-M (Fig. 3f), which is consistent with the slight variation trend of FF values in the PSCs.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements48 were carried out to study the molecular packing of PBDB-T, PM6, PM7, and IDT6CN-M pure films and the corresponding blend films. As shown in Fig. 4a and b and Table S1 of the ESI,† all the donor polymers PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 show preferential face-on orientation with almost the same lamellar peaks at qr ∼0.29 Å−1 (d-spacing ∼ 21.67 Å). The π–π stacking peaks of PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 are at 1.69, 1.75 and 1.70 Å−1, and the corresponding crystallite coherence lengths (CCLs) are 20.2, 22.4, and 18.4 Å, respectively. The pure IDT6CN-M film exhibits relatively lower crystallinity with face-on orientation compared with the polymer films. The lamellar peak is located at qr = 0.34 Å−1 (d = 18.5 Å and CCL = 31.7 Å) and the π–π stacking peak at qz = 1.83 Å−1 (d = 3.43 Å and CCL = 29.4 Å). As for the PBDB-T:IDT6CN-M, PM6:IDT6CN-M, and PM7:IDT6CN-M blend films, the lamellar packing peaks are all at qr ∼ 0.30 Å−1, which might originate from the donors (Table S1 in the ESI†). The π–π peaks are at 1.79, 1.78 and 1.74 Å−1 respectively, which may be due to the synergetic effect of donors and IDT6CN-M. Notably, compared to the polymer pure films, the blend films display more preferential face-on packing tendency and higher crystallinity, evidenced by the larger peak intensity and CCL of both lamellar (89.7–92.6 Å) and π–π stacking (26.2–30.2 Å), indicating their good morphology compatibility. Highly oriented and crystallized blend films are beneficial to charge transport and decreasing nonradiative recombination for the devices, resulting in a high photocurrent and FF.

As shown in Fig. 4c, the surface morphologies of the blend films were probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. All the blend films showed rather smooth surface morphologies with a small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.818–1.09 nm, which is consistent with the high FF values of these PSCs.

Fig. 5 and Table S2 (see the ESI†) summarize the correlation of Voc and Elossversus PCE obtained in this work and it was compared with that of the PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V reported in the literature. In most PSCs, the main reason for the decrease of PCEs is the loss of Voc. For the PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V, it is clear that most of the devices displayed Eloss above the empirical limit of 0.6 eV, and such devices showed PCEs of below 11.0%, i.e., few D/A pairs have achieved satisfactory PCE by minimizing the Eloss. In this work, the PSCs based on PM6 and PM7 achieved a low Eloss of 0.56 and 0.55 eV with a high Voc of 1.04 and 1.05 V, which are superior to those of the devices with similar blends reported in the literature (Voc of 0.84–0.88 V and Eloss of 0.62–0.65 eV).25,44 Consequently, the PM6- and PM7-based devices demonstrated excellent PCEs at low Eloss values.

3. Conclusions
In summary, efficient PSCs based on the D/A pairs of halogenated polymer donors (PM6 and PM7) and an asymmetrical acceptor (IDT6CN-M) were developed. Due to the fact that the halogenation decreases the energy levels of polymers, the D/A pairs show a very small ΔEHOMO of 0.08–0.10 eV, which helps achieve high Voc and low Eloss in PSCs. Moreover, the D/A pairs have complementary absorption spectra and possess excellent morphological compatibility, which helps the corresponding PSCs to achieve the minimization of the trade-off between Voc and Jsc. As a result, the PSCs based on PM6:IDT6CN-M and PM7:IDT6VN-M achieved the same high PCE of 13.3% with a high Voc of 1.04 and 1.05 V, Jsc of 16.6 and 16.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.771 and 0.775, as well as a low Eloss of 0.56 and 0.55 eV, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 13.3% is one of the highest values for single-junction PSCs with a Voc of over 1.0 V.
