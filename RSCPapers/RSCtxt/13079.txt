    , Accepted 18th February 2021First published on 18th February 2021AbstractNanocomposites are at the heart of the present nanotechnology revolution in several strategic fields, including Green Chemistry, sensors and pollutant remediation. The promising and extensively examined nanotitania photocatalysts have performances hampered by the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. To better understand these materials, here we generalize the 2D-heterojunctions physics to 3D patchworks of intimately associated anatase and brookite mixed crystallites, i.e. multi-phase polymorphs, MPPs. The synthesized composite material is fully characterized experimentally and by simulations. We demonstrate that the anatase–brookite interphase behaves as a ground-state nano-diode containing an almost ideal nanocapacitor, associated with a net migration of electrons from anatase to brookite. Implications of the direct observation of a polarized interphase on the understanding of nanotitania photocatalysts at the atomic scale are discussed.
Introduction
The spontaneous recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is the main drawback that impacts negatively the performances of photocatalytic materials,1–4 especially in promising titania-based nanocrystals.5,6 In this respect, extrinsic bulk impurity/defect states play a fundamental role,5,7,8 as they can create shallow mid-gap states and reduce the apparent bandgap9 at the expense of increasing the concentration of trapping centres10 for electrons (e−) and holes (h+), which slow down the recombination rate.11 Crystals of TiO2 anatase can also be doped on their growing surfaces, to stabilize the metastable {001} facets over the thermodynamically favored, but less reactive, {101} ones.12–14 However, neither doping or co-doping has turned pristine titania materials into efficient visible light catalysts.15,16 These approaches alone have not been proven to be particularly useful, which has led to the proposal of third generation materials consisting of either two or three interconnected semiconductors.17–19
In particular, an alternative strategy to fight the curse of recombination relies on hybrid materials,20,21 where different semiconductors are joined through a 2D-heterojunction,22 which spontaneously promotes a net flow of charge across the interface.23,24 This is due to the thermodynamic drive toward the equilibration of the chemical potential of the two phases, under the continuity constraints imposed by Poisson's equation.25 The resulting quantum mechanical picture is that of a 2D quantum well that traps some charge carriers at the junction, and produces an equilibrium electric double layer.26 Any further migration of electrons or holes across the phase boundaries is thus kinetically and thermodynamically hindered and the charge vectorial displacement originating from the contact between phases is correlated with the e−–h+ recombination delay. A variety of layered photonic devices relying on this physics are well known, including light emitting diodes,27 laser diodes,28 photocatalysts,24 and electro-analytical sensors.29
Specifically, even an interface between polymorphs of the same chemical system, like anatase and brookite phases of TiO2, can act as a diode, as the valence and conduction band edges of the two bulk crystals are different.30 However, the difference is often too small to be of any practical utility in macroscopic layered devices, which in fact are mostly composed of chemically different compounds.31
Here we investigate the atomistic details of nano double-layers in multiphase nanostructured powders of TiO2 that might be exploited to boost the photocatalytic performances even in the absence of a composite (multi-layered) architecture. It has been substantiated again and again that heterogeneous mixtures of TiO2 polymorphs with a predominance of anatase generally show greater photocatalytic yields than one-phase TiO2 (see Section S5, ESI†).32–35 Specifically, the photocatalytic visible-light performances of N-doped anatase are significantly enhanced in the presence of the brookite phase, even with respect to the rutile one.36–38 This has been explained by invoking a lower recombination rate of charge carriers, which in turn has been attributed to band alignment effects, and charge migration across the phase boundaries.39–41 However, this could be just part of the story. The intimate connection among nanocrystallites of anatase and brookite in well-defined ratios, i.e. nano-diode-like heterojunctions, might cooperatively produce a net measurable equilibrium (ground-state) effect. In other words, we look for “multi-phase polymorph” (MPP) nano-diodes. The latter are expected to spontaneously self-assemble between surfaces with similar meshes, such as the most stable (101)anatase and (210)brookite facets, which have almost commensurate translation periods (see below and Section S3.3, ESI†). To this end, we synthesized, characterized and tested multiple nanoheterojunctions in bulk N-doped anatase–brookite TiO2 nanostructured powders (details of the experimental procedures are reported in Methods – see below – and in Section S1 of the ESI†). These materials afford an ideal test case to probe the role of the phase composition, as nanopowders with nm-size crystallites bear a very small concentration of bulk grain boundaries that may act as recombination centres,42 and surface band bending is negligible.43 In our experiments, the main roles of the non-metal N dopant are (i) to provide the visible light chromophore center and (ii) to control the amount of brookite: the higher the nominal N/Ti molar ratio, the higher the anatase content.9,44 We show both experimental and computational evidence that statistically dispersed MPP nano-heterojunctions can cooperatively produce an effective capacitor layer. We also investigated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) how this may be correlated with the significantly improved photocatalytic performances of the material under UV illumination.
The paper is organized as follows. First, the equilibrium properties of the electronic ground-state system are described based on the outcomes of high-grade DFT simulations and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements in the dark. Then, the response of the system is probed by photocurrent experiments under UV illumination and PCA is performed to find relevant correlations among structural and composition parameters and recombination times. A final section summarizes the main findings and conclusions.
Results and discussion
Explicit DFT modelling of the anatase:brookite main interface
Semiconductors with very similar band gaps and type (anatase: ∼3.1 eV; brookite: ∼3.3 eV) were chosen to create extremely intimate surface contacts of complex 3D networks of statistically oriented nanocrystallites (Fig. 1a), in contrast to the artificial ones where the contact is created ad hoc on cm2-scale surfaces. HR-TEM analyses (Fig. 1a and Section S2, ESI†) demonstrate that the contact between the two phases generated in this way occurs frequently through the association of the most stable14,45 {101}anatase and {210}brookite facets. In particular, the electron diffraction of the overlapping portion of the two phases reveals the existence of {101}anatase:{210}brookite nano-junctions among the nanocrystals. The electron diffraction pattern of the interphase region (Fig. 1a, inset) is the superimposition of the diffraction images ascribable to either (101) anatase and/or (210) brookite exposed planes. The corresponding meshes are very similar but differently oriented.46 As shown in the ESI (Sections S3.3 and S3.4†), the 1 × 1 (210) brookite mesh is almost commensurate with a reconstructed 2 × 1 (101) anatase one, provided that the surfaces are mutually rotated by ∼10 deg around the non-crystallographic direction. This implies that the reconstructed (101) anatase surface could serve as a template for the epitaxial growth of (210) brookite (Fig. 1b and S5, ESI†); the energy gain due to brookite crystallization47 is more than enough to pay the cost of the reconstruction at the interface, as indicated by the fact that the simulations find stable geometries. The large amount of (101):(210) contacts found by the HR-TEM analysis (see also Fig. S1, ESI†), as well as the measured macroscopic capacitance (see below), suggests that such an intimate connection is more frequent than expected on a pure statistical basis. This can be explained by the relative abundance of the most stable {101}anatase and {210}brookite surfaces, possibly coupled through an epitaxy-driven heterogeneous nucleation mechanism.
 Fig. 1  From nanoparticle imaging to first-principles atomistic calculations. (a) HR-TEM image of anatase:brookite 77:23 w/w nanopowders (Section S2, ESI†). The insets represent the electron diffraction patterns relative to the two nanoparticles evidenced in blue (anatase) and white (brookite), respectively. The third electron diffraction, indicated as “Interface”, refers to the overlapping region (evidenced in red) between the two above examined nanoparticles. The material is highly crystalline, with neatly visible interference fringes with periodicity of anatase (101) and brookite (210) crystallographic planes. Spheroidal crystallites have average estimated diameters of 4–8 nm and the two phases statistically dispersed in a homogeneous mixture. (b) Atomistic model of the structure of the {101}anatase:{210}brookite interphase, fully relaxed at the DFT+U/PBE level of theory (see Methods and section S3, ESI†). Curly brackets indicate from above to below the brookite, the interphase and the anatase regions respectively. (c) Plane-averaged electrostatic potential (eV) for the mixed anatase/brookite system, as a function of the non-crystallographic Z coordinate, i.e. along the slab perpendicular. 
Accordingly, we simulated the (101):(210) contact at the DFT/PBE+U level of theory (full details in Methods and Section S3, ESI†). The optimized atomic arrangement presents an ∼1 nm thick interphase layer (Fig. 1b), which is somewhat more reminiscent of the brookite bulk structure. This is confirmed by the rumpling curve reported in Section S3.4 (Fig. S6, ESI†), where the averaged root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of each atom position from the respective bulk one is reported. The anatase-like region recovers the original bulk arrangement after 1 nm from the contact region, while the brookite-like one after 0.4 nm. The slab dimensions are chosen large enough to describe all relevant rearrangements that are taking place at the interphase. The slab surface layer atoms in contact with the vacuum are kept frozen at the bulk geometry and they are under-coordinated. Thus, the interphase region is immune from the surface–vacuum interactions and the optimization is driven only by the anatase and brookite original bulk configurations. The polarization effects induced by this choice on both sides of the slab compensate each other. Thus, they do not influence the charge distribution of the interphase layer, as it can be appreciated from the plane-averaged electrostatic potential along the non-crystallographic direction (Fig. 1c and Section S3.7, Fig. S11, ESI†).
Computed charge density and electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements
Integration of the DFT ground-state charge density within the topological atomic basins defined according to the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules48–50 estimates a net migration of ∼0.5 electrons from the anatase to the brookite side of the interface (see Section S3.6, ESI†). Atomic charges are reported in Tables S1 and S2 of ESI, and in Fig. S10a† using a color code. These are relatively constant throughout the slab; no specific oxidizing or reducing centers can be found. Accordingly, we do not focus on individual atomic charges, whose calculation and interpretation are still an open issue.51 Rather, the overall charge migration between the two phases corresponding to the electronic ground state, which involves an electronic rearrangement in the whole anatase and brookite structures, is much more informative, as it can also be accessed experimentally by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS, Fig. 2). The systems were studied without the addition of any electrochemical probe, to evaluate only phenomena deriving from the electrode material, the supporting electrolyte and the inert solution. Moreover, all the measurements were carried out in the absence of UV excitation, i.e. in the dark, to probe just the ground-state macroscopic properties of the MPP nanopowder. The potential was set to 0 V (SCE), very close to the open circuit potential of the electrochemical cell, to avoid phenomena driven by potential changes. The behaviour of FTO is very similar to that of a pure capacitor (vertical line with a slope very close to 90°, confirmed also by the corresponding Bode plot in Fig. 2b). Instead, the oxide samples deviate from the linear trend, as expected. In Fig. 2b more evidence for an additional RC element in the anatase/brookite sample is reported. The anatase sample presents two peaks, ascribable to RC of the two interphases, corresponding to the one with the solution and the other with the support. The mixed anatase:brookite sample is very similar to the pure anatase one (given the predominant presence of anatase), but a third peak is appreciable between 1 and 10 Hz, related to a new anatase and brookite contact (the third interphase).
 Fig. 2  Complex-plane plots in panel (a) and phase Bode plots in panel (b) for the following samples: pristine support (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide, FTO, black dots), pure anatase (Alfa Aesar 284, fourth row in Table 2, red dots), and anatase/brookite mixed oxide (T400, sixth row in Table 2, blue dots). Dashed lines represent the fitting, performed with the equivalent circuits shown in panel (c) for the solid–liquid (green), solid–solid (red) and solid–support (light blue) interfaces. Fitted parameters are shown in Table 1. Inset of panel (a) the double layer behaves as a nano-heterojunction where a complex 3D network of solid–solid interphases is acting as an intimately associated nanoscale capacitor with an EIS-estimated specific charge transfer of 4.2 μC cm−2 (see Methods). The agreement with the DFT estimate of 5.4 μC cm−2 is remarkable. 
The experimental data were fitted (Fig. 2b) using the equivalent circuits of one (FTO, support), two (pure anatase sample) and three (anatase/brookite sample) RC series (Fig. 2c). The results are summarized in Table 1. The capacitances at the interphases with the solution (CPE1) and with the support (CPE2) are fitted by a constant phase element CPE = [(Ciω)α]−1, considering the inhomogeneous surface of the oxide layers and the consequent non-ideal capacitor contact.

R
1 shows a typical value of the oxide/solution interphase, while R2 is greater, as expected from the oxide inhomogeneous layers in contact with the support. In any case, the anatase/brookite sample can be satisfactorily fitted only using 3 distinct RC elements. From the comparison among the order of magnitude of the three equivalent resistors R1, R2 and R3, we can observe that the resistance describing the anatase/brookite interphase (R3) is from 3 to 6 orders of magnitude lower (Ω vs. MΩ and kΩ) than those describing the contact between the oxides and the solution or the FTO support. This result can be explained by the very close contact, at the sub-nanometer scale, of the two phases, in agreement with the theoretical and HR-TEM outcomes. More specifically, DFT calculations have shown that the brookite phase can be interconnected to the anatase one by a network of bonds without loss of continuity. If we consider, for example, that in comparison the interactions of the nanoparticles with the solvent are typically not of this type, the resistor order of magnitude difference finds its atomistic explanation in our modeling. It is also worth noting that this interphase can be fitted with a pure capacitor instead of a constant phase element, demonstrating that the separation of charges leads to an almost ideal double layer capacitor with a specific capacitance of 19.6 μF cm−2 (Table 1). This double layer originates from the volume-weighted average of all the nanocapacitors that are associated with individual heterojunctions, which provide a high significance to the EIS estimate. DFT simulations predict a net charge migration of 5.4 μC cm−2 (Fig. S10, ESI† and Fig. 2a, inset) across the interface, in close quantitative agreement with the EIS outcome (4.2 μC cm−2, Fig. 2 and Table 1). The conformity of views between such estimates is noteworthy, even though it might be partly traced back to some kind of error cancellation, including intrinsic limits of DFT, non-ideality of surfaces and finite-T kinetic effects. However, the overall agreement between the impedance experiments and theory confirms that a significant amount of nanoheterojunctions involve the most stable {101}anatase and {210}brookite crystallite facets, as shown also by the HR-TEM images in Fig. 1a and S1, ESI† (see above). This is expected, as nanoparticles have been grown under thermodynamic control (Section 1, ESI†).
Eventually, an equilibrium double layer is formed (Fig. 2a, inset) only when both anatase and brookite are present in the nanostructured powder. DFT simulations suggest that the brookite (anatase) side is negative (positive) (see above). We searched for the confirmation of this charge sign in the experimental literature, since our impedance experiment cannot provide this information. Other simulations are not of any help. In fact, previous calculations, which are based on standard DFT band-gap alignment and that we reproduced in Sections S3.2 and S3.5, ESI,† where the two phases are calculated separately, could not reproduce this representation, as there the Valence Band (VB) of brookite is higher in energy by a fraction of eV compared to anatase. However, literature EIS measurements30 show that the brookite VB has a lower energy (i.e. a more positive reduction potential), even if for a small amount, in agreement with other experimental estimates (see Fig. 6 of ref. 30). This means that the anatase VB is bent at lower energies, the brookite one at higher energies, i.e., the brookite-like region can allocate extra electrons at the expense of the anatase-like one. This VB offset can be directly compared with our T = 0 K ground electronic state calculations results, where a partial electron migration is observed from the anatase-like phase to the brookite-like one, with the consequent formation of a double charge layer. In conclusion, experimental and computational evidence agrees that some ground state charge density flows into the brookite lattice, that is, this phase acts as a thermodynamic reducing agent in the anatase:brookite electrochemical pair.
This picture is further corroborated by inspecting the DFT plane-averaged electrostatic potential along the non-crystallographic direction, which was computed by averaging the quantum expectation values of the potential from the electronic wavefunction (Section S3.7,†Fig. 1c). Two quasi-plateaus, each for each polymorph, are neatly visible, the brookite-like one being the most negative. As the averaged potential reflects the distribution of the total charge density, a slight excess of negative charges in the brookite-like region is confirmed. We stress that this is the T = 0 K ground state electronic picture and it does not allow us to infer the direction of the charge transfer upon photoexcitation, which is investigated experimentally in the next section.
Photocurrent measurements
Now we want to see if for our composites, which we know to be characterized by the presence of a polarized interphase, the generated e−–h+ pair recombines significantly slower and by what extent. More specifically, we want to prove that the concomitant presence of the two polymorphs, and consequently of their interphase, is correlated with the e−–h+ recombination changes. Photocurrent experiments52 were performed under UV light (see Methods, Fig. 3a and S13, ESI†). Pristine anatase and the anatase/brookite mixed samples behaved differently, as the corresponding normalized j/j0 decays required two different least-squares models to provide a satisfactory fitting. This likely indicates the presence of neatly distinguishable decay mechanisms. Usually, the calculation of the transient time constant τ, an estimate of the recombination time, is based on the linearization of the first order exponential decay which describes the first 15/25 seconds of irradiation by the following empirical law:52,53 (1)In eqn (1), A1 is a pre-exponential factor and τ1 the time constant. The anatase/brookite mixed samples conform with this model (Fig. 3b and S14b, ESI†), which correspond to one decay mechanism that takes place on a second-long timescale (Table 2). A more complex function is needed to model the pristine anatase data (Fig. 3a and S14a, ESI†). We found that a bi-exponential decay curve properly fits the pristine anatase data (Fig. 3a and S14b, ESI†). (2)
 Fig. 3  Slow-down of the e−–h+ recombination time is correlated with the brookite phase presence. (a) Photocurrent measurements on commercial Alfa Aesar 130 anatase (see Table 2). Orange points: normalized j/j0 current density decay for the first 15 s (4th step of irradiation). Measured data are shown in the inset.

(b) Same as (a), for the 96:4 anatase:brookite composite TiO2 sample (blue points). A single exponential fit (black line) with a lower t → 0 slope (red line) accounts for these data. (c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-derived scores (black points) and loadings (black lines) for microstructural parameters of mono- (orange area) and bi-phasic (blue area) TiO2 powders, showing their correlation with photocurrent estimates (original variables in Table 2). A1 and A2 are fitted pre-exponential factors; τ1 and τ2 the corresponding recombination times (τ1 → 0 for biphasic samples, see Sections S4 and S5, ESI†). A strong positive correlation is apparent between the τ2 kinetic constant and the brookite content.

As shown in Table 2, the first time interval 0–3 seconds is mainly described by an exponential decay characterized by a fast (τ1 ∼ 0.4 s) and a slow (τ2 ∼ 4 s) recombination process, taking place on an order of magnitude larger timescale. Interestingly, these estimates are comparable with those found in multilayer Cr-doped titania52 and much larger than those attributable to fast e−–h+ recombination alone. Hence, in pure nano-anatase, two significant slowdown mechanisms are already active.
Overall, the fitted coefficients of eqn (1) imply substantially longer e−–h+ recombination times in composite MPP TiO2 nano-powders (Fig. 3b). We must conclude that the overall recombination mechanism is different in the biphasic samples, where either the fastest and most efficient recombination route is switched off, or else the slower path dominates. In either case, the effect is to enhance the current density j/j0 by ∼40 percent points with respect to pure anatase at t > 10 s (Fig. 3a and b).
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the main physical–chemical variables listed in Table 2 (see also Fig. 3c) shows that the decay time constant τ2 correlates with the weight percent of brookite. In other words, the phase composition, and not the amount of extrinsic point defects, determines the different e−–h+ recombination mechanism and, therefore, the photocatalytic performances. As expected, higher time constants almost invariably correspond to higher photocatalytic efficiencies (Section S5, ESI†). The correlation between τ2 and the brookite weight percent is not linear, though the N-free sample (score no. 6) has a higher decay rate (τ = 3.1 s) than the EIS-analyzed 77:23 w/w specimen (score no. 8), whose τ = 5.1 s implies that it is the best performant photocatalytic material (Fig. S16 and Table S3, ESI†). Brookite-poor and N-rich samples all display lower time constants (e.g. score no. 11, Table 2) and in fact are associated with lower conversion efficiency and smaller rate constants against the photodegradation of methylene blue, toluene and NOx pollutants (Table S3, ESI†). Likely, they do not bear solid–solid interfaces large enough to produce a net migration of the charge carriers. Moreover, the nanoparticle size might also influence the nature of the anatase:brookite double layer, and thus the decay rate. It has been shown that the band level alignment of anatase:rutile nanojunctions depends on quantum confinement effects:54 the electron migration at equilibrium might even switch from anatase → rutile to rutile → anatase upon increasing the dimensions of the nanoparticles in close contact. Whether and to what extent this is also true for anatase:brookite interphases remains to be investigated and might disclose intriguing opportunities to design complex circuit elements at the nanoscale.
Conclusions
This contribution provides a first-principles atomistic description of biphasic TiO2-based photocatalysts, revealing the formation of a 3D array of anatase–brookite nanodiode-like heterojunctions and correlating it with the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic behavior. In the first part of the paper, we focused on the ground state properties of the interphase nanocapacitor, finding a very good agreement between the hybrid supercell DFT modeling and the electrochemical impedance results. In the second part, we correlated photocurrent outcomes under UV illumination with several structural and composition parameters, finding a significant, non-trivial correlation between the brookite content and the recombination time. Our interpretative model, based on the atomistic details explaining the electronic interphase balancing, allows the generalization of 2D-heterojunctions to the more ubiquitous 3D case of coexistent crystalline nanoparticles of multi-phase polymorphs (MPP) photocatalysts. TiO2-MPP devices have several advantages in the context of Green Chemistry applications: in particular, they are easily synthesizable from cheap reactants and environmentally safe. Moreover, crucial parameters like the polymorph ratio and the distribution of the dopant across the nanoparticle can be finely tuned by adjusting a few chemical and physical degrees of freedom.44,55–57 Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism of e−–h+ recombination delay in the excited states, but our preliminary ground-state results are encouraging and could disclose a new point of view for visible-light devices based on this architecture. To this end, we stress the importance of investigating the physics of titania devices at the atomistic scale. The recognition of the central role played by MPP nanoheterojunctions could open new exciting scenarios for the tailored synthesis of TiO2-based semiconductor photocatalysts with superior performances, paving the way toward an entirely novel class of cheap, easily synthesizable and environmental friendly composite materials.
Experimental
Materials
Commercial single-phase TiO2 powders have been purchased by Alfa Aesar (Anatase 9.5, 42, 130 and 284), Sigma-Aldrich (brookite) and Sachtleben (Hombikat UV 100) and used without further treatments. Home-made powders, both undoped and N-doped, have been prepared by varying anatase/brookite quantity, following a previously optimized sol–gel synthesis.57 Nominal N/Ti ratios of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.5 have been included.
HR-TEM
HR-TEM images were obtained by means of a JEOL 3010-UHR Instrument equipped with a LaB6 filament (acceleration potential 300 kV). All digital micrographs were acquired using an Ultrascan 1000 camera, and the images were processed by Gatan Digital Micrograph program version 3.11.1. Samples were dry dispersed onto Cu grids coated with a “lacey” carbon film before the analysis.
DFT calculations
The computational procedure was originally developed by some of us (LLP, MC, GDL) at the Chemistry Dept. of Università degli Studi di Milano and then successfully applied to several other heterojunctions.58–60 Simulations have been performed with VASP61–63 through a plane wave approach. Projector-augmented pseudopotentials, including spin-polarization, have been used in conjunction with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof GGA parametrization64 for the exchange–correlation functional. A Hubbard DFT+U splitting65 has been considered and set to 3.0 eV for the Ti 3d states. The interface model has been built by exposing anatase (101) and brookite (210) surfaces of previously optimized pure phases, and then by putting them in close contact along the non-crystallographic direction as described in Section S3.3, ESI.† The final model consisted of a 3 nm thick anatase/brookite biphasic slab with 384 atoms, plus a 1.2 nm wide vacuum layer to separate translation-related images of the slab along the non-crystallographic direction. All atoms have been relaxed at a constant volume of the simulation box, without imposing any symmetry constraint, with the only exception of the terminal layers in contact with vacuum, which have been kept fixed at their optimized bulk geometries.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
An electrochemical cell with a Luggin capillary for ohmic drop abatement, a saturated calomel electrode for reference and an electrode setup consisting of two Pt wire counter electrodes perpendicular to working and reference, has been used. The working electrode has been a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass covered with a deposition of the desired sample. N2-deaerated NaClO4 0.1 M has been employed as a supporting electrolyte. Analyses are carried out by using a potentiostat/galvanostat PGStat30 (Autolab, The Netherlands) equipped with a FRA module and Nova 2.0 software.
Photocurrent and photocatalysis
Photocurrent measurements performed with the same setup as EIS were registered at a fixed potential of +1 V (step potential 0.1 s) under 500 W UV light irradiation (Jelosil HG 500, iron halides). The first 600 s represents the dark current, and then 200 s of irradiation is alternated with 100 s in the dark for 6 times. Photocatalytic experiments were performed using a 300 W solar lamp (Radium Sanolux HRC 300-280) emitting in the 380–600 nm range of wavelengths, with nominal intensity I = 1.2 × 10−5 Einstein dm−3 s−1. Reagent-grade methylene blue, NOx and toluene were the substrates examined.53,66
Spectroscopic, BET and diffractometric characterization
UV-vis spectra were recorded with a UV-vis scanning spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 35) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory. All spectra were acquired by working in reflectance mode and Kubelka–Munk elaboration is applied for the band gap evaluation. The BET surface area was determined by the multipoint BET method using the adsorption data in the relative pressure (p/p0) range of 0.05–0.3. Desorption isotherms were used to determine the pore size distribution using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method with a cylindrical pore size. XRD diffractograms are obtained with a Philips PW 3710 Bragg–Brentano goniometer equipped with a scintillation counter and 1° divergence slit, 0.2 mm receiving slit, and 0.04° Söller slit systems. We employed graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV × 40 mA nominal X-rays power. Volume-averaged crystallite dimensions have been estimated through the Scherrer equation on (101) anatase and (211) brookite reflections.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  From nanoparticle imaging to first-principles atomistic calculations. (a) HR-TEM image of anatase:brookite 77:23 w/w nanopowders (Section S2, ESI†). The insets represent the electron diffraction patterns relative to the two nanoparticles evidenced in blue (anatase) and white (brookite), respectively. The third electron diffraction, indicated as “Interface”, refers to the overlapping region (evidenced in red) between the two above examined nanoparticles. The material is highly crystalline, with neatly visible interference fringes with periodicity of anatase (101) and brookite (210) crystallographic planes. Spheroidal crystallites have average estimated diameters of 4–8 nm and the two phases statistically dispersed in a homogeneous mixture. (b) Atomistic model of the structure of the {101}anatase:{210}brookite interphase, fully relaxed at the DFT+U/PBE level of theory (see Methods and section S3, ESI†). Curly brackets indicate from above to below the brookite, the interphase and the anatase regions respectively. (c) Plane-averaged electrostatic potential (eV) for the mixed anatase/brookite system, as a function of the non-crystallographic Z coordinate, i.e. along the slab perpendicular.	 

 	Fig. 2  Complex-plane plots in panel (a) and phase Bode plots in panel (b) for the following samples: pristine support (Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide, FTO, black dots), pure anatase (Alfa Aesar 284, fourth row in Table 2, red dots), and anatase/brookite mixed oxide (T400, sixth row in Table 2, blue dots). Dashed lines represent the fitting, performed with the equivalent circuits shown in panel (c) for the solid–liquid (green), solid–solid (red) and solid–support (light blue) interfaces. Fitted parameters are shown in Table 1. Inset of panel (a) the double layer behaves as a nano-heterojunction where a complex 3D network of solid–solid interphases is acting as an intimately associated nanoscale capacitor with an EIS-estimated specific charge transfer of 4.2 μC cm−2 (see Methods). The agreement with the DFT estimate of 5.4 μC cm−2 is remarkable.

 	Fig. 3  Slow-down of the e−–h+ recombination time is correlated with the brookite phase presence. (a) Photocurrent measurements on commercial Alfa Aesar 130 anatase (see Table 2). Orange points: normalized j/j0 current density decay for the first 15 s (4th step of irradiation). Measured data are shown in the inset. Black line: double exponential fit (parameters in Table S3, ESI†). Red line: first-order Taylor approximation of the exponential function close to t = 0 s. (b) Same as (a), for the 96:4 anatase:brookite composite TiO2 sample (blue points). A single exponential fit (black line) with a lower t → 0 slope (red line) accounts for these data. (c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-derived scores (black points) and loadings (black lines) for microstructural parameters of mono- (orange area) and bi-phasic (blue area) TiO2 powders, showing their correlation with photocurrent estimates (original variables in Table 2). A1 and A2 are fitted pre-exponential factors; τ1 and τ2 the corresponding recombination times (τ1 → 0 for biphasic samples, see Sections S4 and S5, ESI†). A strong positive correlation is apparent between the τ2 kinetic constant and the brookite content.
