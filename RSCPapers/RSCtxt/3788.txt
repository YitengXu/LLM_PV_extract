    , Accepted 7th January 2021First published on 8th January 2021AbstractA novel multifunctional polymer ionic liquid poly(oxyethylene)-imide-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (POEI-TEMPO) was successfully prepared and used as an additive in iodide electrolyte in quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (QSS-DSSCs). The POEI segment in the electrolyte has good mechanical strength; meanwhile, the TEMPO organic radical contains nitroxide as the redox couple (RN-O˙/RNO+) acting as a superior mediator in DSSCs. TEMPO has a number of favorable properties, such as fast and reversible redox kinetics, large apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp), positive redox potential, and facile electron self-exchange reaction. As a result, DSSCs were composed of a POEI-TEMPO/iodide electrolyte and a Pt-coated FTO layer on glass as a normal counter electrode (PtCE), whereas the other side of the glass was coated with silver mirror coating (SMC) as the bifacial PtCE/SMC cell. DSSC exhibited a maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) of 9.83%, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 812.84 mV, and short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.60 mA cm−2 under 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), whereas the value of η reached 25.99% under an indoor condition with 6000 lux (1.89 mW cm−2). Moreover, when POEI-TEMPO is used as an additive, the bifacial cell maintains its high performance with a reasonable long-term stability. The finding is expected to have a practical impact on harvesting the ambient light energy and extending the cell lifetime.
1. Introduction
An innovative electricity generation from renewable resources with lower cost and higher efficiency has been required to deal with the worldwide energy consumptions and scarcity.1–6 The feasible efficiency with lower cost of DSSCs make them an attractive alternative for conventional solar collectors.7–11 Meanwhile, the suitable features of DSSCs for thin film technology are more favorable to the application even at lower internal temperatures.12–14 Moreover, the DSSCs are capable of maintaining a high photovoltage even in diffuse light conditions.15–19
The efficiency of DSSC has improved significantly by using the most efficient redox system (I−/I3−) electrolyte.20–23 However, there are some inherent drawbacks of the I−/I3− redox mediator:24–28 (1) light absorption in the visible range, (2) high corrosive power of I3− towards the Pt and other metal-based CEs, which can reduce the durability of DSSCs, (3) lower VOC and less excessive driving force due to the more negative redox potential, (4) charge recombination and larger energy loss due to the electron deficiency of I3−, and (5) delays the dye regeneration due to the multipart internal chemical reaction.
2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) is a stable organic molecule, which is extensively applied as a light-stabilizer and inhibiter of oxidation reaction.29 In 2008, TEMPO was first proposed for use in the field of DSSCs, and achieved a cell efficiency (η) of 5.4%. In this case, the low efficiency was obtained due to the fast recombination behavior of TEMPO+.30 A series of TEMPO derivatives were also explored. Nevertheless, the pristine TEMPO molecule is considered as a better candidate among the derivatives.31 Dhar et al. investigated two new series of TEMPO-based electrolytes (TEMPO-I and TEMPO-III) for DSSC applications. The incorporation of the conventional electrolyte with the TEMPO redox couple enhanced the thermal stability and conductivity. The long-term stability of both electrolyte-based devices, up to 500 h under 1 sun light illumination, demonstrated the advantage of these materials for large-scale DSSC applications.32 Chu et al. proposed the TEMPO-linked N-butyl imidazole iodide with a secondary amide group to form a novel type of ionic liquid, and achieved an η of 8.1%.33 Authors identified that this redox couple behaves as a TEMPO-iodide tandem redox system. Li et al. synthesized 1-butyl-3-{2-oxo-2-[(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl)amino]ethyl}-1H-imidazol-3-ium selenocyanate (ITSeCN), and subsequently combined this compound with imidazolium-functionalized TEMPO and selenocyanate. In this case, the imidazolium-functionalized TEMPO and selenocyanate act as the cathodic and anionic redox mediators. Thus, the compound comprising ITSeCN, imidazolium-functionalized TEMPO and selenocyanate can exhibit the favorable redox features, including a larger positive standard potential, higher diffusivity, and superior heterogeneous rate constant compared to those of iodide.28 In addition, the redox-active radical TEMPO molecule has been successfully utilized as an additive electro-active species and achieved a higher current-density and power-rate capability for rechargeable batteries.34–36 The feasible power-rate performance was ascribed to the fast charge-propagation, rapid redox reactivity and electron self-exchange activity of the TEMPO radical. Recently, the quasi-solid-state polymer gel has been recommended to the application of batteries owing to the features, such as the long cycle life and leakage-free property of the electrolyte.37 These features are so desirable to the successful application of DSSCs. In our previous research on polymeric ionic liquid-based electrolytes for DSSCs, a new polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) and poly(oxyethylene)-imide-imidazole (POEI-II) complex-coupled iodide anions were synthesized and used as the gel electrolyte for quasi-solid-state DSSCs (QSS-DSSCs). Simultaneously, POEI-II acted as a redox mediator and agent for the gelation of the organic solvent-based electrolyte.38 The presence of the POE segment in the structure of POEI-II could chelate the lithium cations (Li+) in the electrolyte to enhance the VOC of a QSS-DSSC, and make a strong dipole lone pair of electron interaction with iodide ions (I−). This led to the higher ionic conductivity (σ) and diffusivity of a redox couple in the gel electrolyte. Thus, the QSS-DSSC with POEI-II gel electrolyte achieved a high cell η of 7.19%. We also reported another polymer ionic liquid poly(oxyethylene)-imide-imidazolium selenocyanate (POEI-IS) based gel electrolyte for QSS-DSSC, and achieved a higher VOC of 826 mV and an η of 8.18%.39 Therefore, this multifunctional polymeric ionic liquid can be used as a promising electrolyte for developing the highly efficient QSS-DSSCs.
Owing to the above-mentioned advantages of the unique molecular structure, the TEMPO radical derivative-grafted POEI polymer chain (POEI-TEMPO) was successfully synthesized and used as a novel polymer ionic liquid for the application of QSS-DSSC. This device with the addition of 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in the liquid iodide electrolyte delivered an η of 8.67% under the condition of 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The obtained η is comparatively higher than the liquid iodide electrolyte (η = 8.2%). In this study, we proposed the fabrication of PtCE with silver mirror coating (PtCE/SMC) by using a simple chemical method, and studied its application to improve the performance of QSS-DSSC. In this case, the SMC can reproduce the photons through reflection and greatly reduces the photon waste. As shown in Scheme 1, PtCE/SMC reflects 93% of the incident light, while the PtCE gives only 9.48% of the reflection. In this study, a PtCE/SMC-based QSS-DSSC exhibited a higher η of 9.83% with a VOC (812.84 mV), and a large JSC (16.60 mA cm−2) under the same light incident, as mentioned above. In addition, we performed the PtCE/SMC-based QSS-DSSC under indoor conditions at 6000 lux and achieved η of 25.99%. Remarkably, the cells maintained their higher workability over a wide range of light intensities and spectral distributions, and excellent long-term stability (up to 90% of their initial η over 2000 h of testing). This indicates that the POEI-TEMPO is a promising candidate for exploring the highly efficient DSSCs.

Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 28.0–30.0%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and nitric acid (HNO3, ca. 65% solution in water) were supplied by J. T. Baker. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 95%) was procured from Teida. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glasses (7 Ω sq−1, UR-ITO007-0.7 mm) were obtained from NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA. The commercial light scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41; average particle size = 200 nm) were acquired from Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of the POEI-TEMPO polymer
The novel bifunctional gel compound, POEI-TEMPO, was prepared via a three-step synthesis as demonstrated in Scheme 2, including (i) the reaction of POE2000 and ODPA at a molar ratio of 2:1, whereas a solution of THF (15 mL) comprising ODPA (1.264 g, 2.5 mmol) was slowly added to POE2000 (16.30 g, 5 mmol) containing THF (15 mL) under stirring in a N2 atmosphere for 1 h. Subsequently, the mixture was maintained at 150 °C for 3 h to obtain a product of POEI (yield = 77%). In the second step (ii), the epichlorohydrin (0.407 g, 4 mmol) was added to the POEI solution at 60 °C for 24 h (yield = 69%). In the third step (iii), a solution of ACN (150 mL) comprising TEMPO (0.689 g, 4 mmol) was mixed into the above mixtures at 90 °C for 24 h to obtain the final product of POEI-TEMPO (yield = 58%). The final product of POEI-TEMPO was dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h.

2.3. Preparation of POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes
The liquid iodide electrolyte was prepared by the addition of 0.1 M LiI (2.677 g), 0.05 M I2 (2.5381 g), 0.6 M DMPII (31.92 g), and 0.5 M tBP (14.65 g) in 200 mL of ACN/MPN (volume ratio = 8/2). Subsequently, different concentrations of POEI-TEMPO (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt%) were added separately into the liquid iodide electrolyte to prepare the gel type electrolytes under magnetic stirring for 24 h. The liquid iodide electrolyte gradually changed to the gel type when the amount of polymer composite exceeded 20 wt%. Among them, the viscosity (ηvisc) values of various gel electrolytes containing 0–30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO were measured by the Wells–Brookfield cone and plate micro-viscometer (Model DV2TRVCJ0; Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc., USA). Fig. 1 shows the photographic images of the viscosity changes for different wt% of POEI-TEMPO in liquid iodide electrolyte.

2.4. Fabrication of the PtCE/SMC electrode
The FTO substrate was first cleaned using different solvents, such as acetone, diluted neutral cleaner (neutral cleaner/water = 1/10 in volume) and isopropanol. Subsequently, a thoroughly washed 100 mL round bottom flask was used to prepare the solution containing 0.6 M of AgNO3 (aq), 2.5 M of NaOH (aq) and 2.0 M of NH4OH (aq). In this preparation, 3 mL of NaOH (2.5 M) was added to 5 mL of AgNO3 (0.6 M). After mixing evenly, 5 mL of NH4OH (2.0 M) was further added to the above mixture and shaken well. This process was completed until the solid precipitate was completely dissolved. Finally, 10% of aqueous glucose solution was added dropwise and with continuous shaking to achieve the uniform mixing. Meanwhile, the change of the bottle wall into the mirror-like surface was observed, and the solution (1 mL) was evenly drop-cast onto the Pt sputtered FTO substrate (non-conductive surface). The reaction mechanism for the formation of the silver solution is shown in eqn (1): C6H12O6 + 2[Ag(NH3)2]+ + 3OH− → C5H11O5COO− + 2Ag↓ + 4NH3 + 2H2O(1)
2.5. Cell assembly
The TiO2 (100 nm) paste (TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio = 1/3)) was coated on cleaned FTO glasses as the thin compact layers, including the transparent layer (10 μm) and scattering layer (4 μm), with an active area of 0.196 cm2 by using the doctor blade technique. Herein, the commercial transparent paste (Ti-nanoxide T/SP) was used to prepare the transparent layer, while a homemade scattering paste was further used to prepare the scattering layer. Each layer was separately sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in ambient environment. After the sintering process, the TiO2 film was immersed in N719 dye solution (5 × 10−4 M of N719 in tBA and ACN (volume ratio = 1/1) solvent) for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode was coupled with a PtCE or a PtCE/SMC with a cell gap of 25 μm thick Surlyn® film as the spacer. The electrolytes were prepared by the mixing of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.5 M tBP and POEI-TEMPO (0–30 wt%) in ACN/MPN (volume ratio = 8/2). These electrolytes were injected into the cell gap between the two electrodes by capillarity.
The following three-step process was carried out to prepare the above-mentioned scattering paste: (1) The TiO2 colloid was synthesized by mixing 0.5 M TTIP solution with 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution, and the mixed solution was further stirred at 88 °C for 8 h. (2) The solution was then transferred into an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA), and maintained at 240 °C for 12 h. The TiO2 nanoparticles could reach an average diameter of 20 nm at this stage. (3) The scattering layer paste was acquired by the addition of 25 wt% PEG and 100 wt% of commercial scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41) (both with respect to the weight of TiO2). In this case, PEG was used for not only preventing the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles, but controlling the pore sizes on the TiO2 nanoparticles as well.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of POEI-TEMPO
In this study, the chemical structure of POEI-TEMPO was identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The resultant 1H and 13C NMR spectra were used to identify the chemical structure of the POEI-TEMPO polymer. The chemical shift assignment and corresponding integration results are shown in Fig. 2a. Herein, the signal for the hydroxyl proton of TEMPO appears in the range of 1.76 to 1.79 ppm, which would react with the Cl group of the POEI polymer to produce a C–O chemical bond and hydrogen chloride. Moreover, the chemical shifts of the –CH2 and –CH3 functional groups of TEMPO can be observed in the range of 1.43 to 1.45 ppm and 1.15 ppm, respectively. In addition, Fig. 2b shows the signal for the carbon of the TEMPO monomer. According to the results of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, all structural information can be summarized as 1H NMR (400 MHz; CDCl3): δ(ppm): 1.77 (t, H3, J = 7.7 Hz, 1H), 1.45 (d, H2,4, J = 6.7 Hz, 4H), 1.15 (s, H1,5, 12H); 13C (400 MHz; CDCl3): δ(ppm): 69.21 (C1,5), 68.36 (C1,5), 39.92 (C2,4), 17.04 (C3), 14.90 (CH3). These obtained results are well matched with previously reported literature.40–42
 Fig. 2  The (a) 1H and (b) 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of POEI-TEMPO polymer ionic liquids were obtained using CDCl3 as the d-solvent. 
In addition, Fig. S1(a)† shows the FTIR spectra of POEI-TEMPO and TEMPO, in which the polymer POEI exhibited the absorption peaks of functional groups, including the aromatic imide ((RCO)2NR′) and oxyethylene (–CH2–CH2–O–) groups. The oxyethylene group (–CH2–CH2–O–) absorption peak of POEI observed at 1355 cm−1 was associated to C–O stretching bond, while the peaks located at 2880 and 1120 cm−1 were related to the C–H and C–C symmetric stretching bonds, respectively. For the (RCO)2NR′ group of POEI, the peaks were observed at 1713 cm−1 and 1770 cm−1 due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the CO bond.39 The resultant characteristic absorption peaks clearly confirm the presence of the functional groups in POEI polymer. In this case of POEI-TEMPO, the characteristic absorption peak of the TEMPO molecule can be observed at 2931 cm−1, which is associated with the stretching vibration of the methyl groups.43 However, the methyl groups of the TEMPO molecule were not clearly distinguished in Fig. S1(a).† This is due to the overlapping characteristic absorption peaks of the –CH3 groups in TEMPO and C–H groups in POEI. From the results of the 1H and 13C NMR analyses and FTIR, the successful synthesis of the POEI-TEMPO polymer can be confirmed.
Fig. S1(b)† shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of TEMPO, POEI, and POEI-TEMPO. Among the three tested samples, the TEMPO molecule exhibited the lowest Td value of 64 °C. Meanwhile, the POEI polymer and POEI-TEMPO polymer showed the Td value of 220 °C, and 336 °C, respectively (Table 1). This phenomenon can be attributed to the POEI polymer grafted with TEMPO. The TEMPO molecule with high rigidity and large structural steric hindrance would reduce the thermal expansion coefficient and improve the mechanical strength of the POEI-TEMPO polymer. Thus, the POEI-TEMPO polymer exhibited the excellent thermal stability in excess of 300 °C.44 This reveals that the synthesized POEI-TEMPO polymer has the potential to be stable at high temperature. It is therefore most favorable to use as an electrolyte in DSSC.

3.2. Electrochemical properties of gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes
In order to investigate the electrochemical properties of the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes, various electrochemical methods were performed, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To be more specific, the properties of POEI-TEMPO, such as redox ability, apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp), and σ were investigated. First, the CV was used to analyze the redox capability of the POEI-TEMPO polymer for application as the QSS-DSSC electrolyte. The 4-hydroxy-TEMPO molecule was used as a standard redox species, which would facilitate a redox pair reaction (N–O˙/NO+). Fig. 3 shows the obtained CV curves for the ACN-based electrolytes (10.0 mM of TEMPO, POEI-TEMPO and iodide in 0.1 M LiClO4) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The resultant CV curves exhibited the anodic and cathodic peaks owing to the oxidation of N–O˙ and radical reduction of NO+, respectively.30 This observed redox reaction of the redox pair (N–O˙/NO+) is written as the following eqn (2): TEMPO˙ ⇌ TEMPO+ + e−(2)

Among various compounds, POEI-TEMPO possesses the highest redox potential owing to its imidazolium-functionalized TEMPO cation, which provides a minimized energy loss for dye regeneration (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the redox potential of POEI-TEMPO combined with liquid iodide electrolyte is higher than that of the iodide redox couple alone (I−/I3−).
 Fig. 4  Energy level diagram for various components: (a) TiO2, (b) N719 dye, (c) iodide, (d) TEMPO, and (e) POEI-TEMPO. 
Therefore, POEI-TEMPO provides a larger voltage difference to the Fermi level of TiO2. Thus, a higher VOC value for the cell can be expected. Moreover, POEI-TEMPO provides a small peak separation (ΔEP, namely, the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks) value of 0.24 V, which is very close to the value of a pristine iodide electrolyte (0.21 V). Thus, it is considered that POEI-TEMPO can provide a sufficient redox couple (N–O˙/NO+) for the desired redox reaction.45,46

Table 1 shows that the POE-TEMPO polymer possessed a more positive anodic peak potential (Epa) of 0.70 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which is comparatively higher than that of the TEMPO molecule (0.50 V vs. Ag/Ag+). Similarly, the POEI-TEMPO polymer gave a more positive cathodic peak potential (Epc) of 0.46 V vs. Ag/Ag+ compared to that of TEMPO (0.35 V vs. Ag/Ag+). Based on the above results, the formal potentials (E0) of the POEI-TEMPO polymer and TEMPO were calculated to be 0.58 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (1.07 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and 0.43 V vs. Ag/Ag+ (0.92 V vs. NHE).
In this case, the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode used was 0.01 M AgNO3 containing ACN-based buffer solution, whereas the potential of this reference electrode was calibrated to be 0.492 V vs. NHE.28 In addition, this study combined the POEI-TEMPO polymer with the liquid iodide electrolyte as the QSS electrolyte for use in a DSSC; thus, the electrolyte had double redox couples. Moreover, the imidazolium-functionalized iodide species and DMPII were used as the iodide redox mediators. The redox reaction involved in the iodide redox couple can be written as eqn (3) and (4): 2I3− ⇌ 3I2 + 2e−(3) 3I− ⇌ I3− + 2e−(4)
Moreover, the LSV was used to investigate the Dapp of the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes. The measured system was a symmetrical dummy cell (FTO/Pt/electrolyte/Pt/FTO), in which a portion of the electrolyte with 0–30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO was added. The LSV test results give the values of the limiting current densities (Jlim) for different compositions in electrolytes, as shown in Fig. S2.† The Jlim value was used to further calculate the corresponding Dapp by using eqn (5):47 Dapp = dJlim(2nFC)−1(5)where d refers to the cell gap (25 μm), F is known as the Faraday constant (96485.4 C mol−1), n represents the number of electrons transferred (n = 2 for the iodide system, while n = 1 for the TEMPO system), and C is the concentration of I3− or TEMPO˙ (0.05 M). For the system of POEI-TEMPO combined with iodide, the values of Dapp for the electrolytes containing 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO were calculated to be 2.56 × 10−6, 2.17 × 10−6, 1.81 × 10−6, 1.54 × 10−6, 1.32 × 10−6, and 1.02 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively (Fig. S2(a)† and Table 2). On the other hand, in the pristine POEI-TEMPO polymer (n = 1), the values of Dapp for the electrolytes containing 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO were calculated to be 1.04 × 10−6, 0.90 × 10−6, 0.74 × 10−6, 0.63 × 10−6, and 0.49 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively, which were obtained from Fig. S2(b).† In addition, in the pristine iodide system (n = 2), the values of Dapp for the electrolytes containing 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of iodides were calculated to be 7.05 × 10−6, 1.16 × 10−5, 1.54 × 10−5, 1.92 × 10−5, and 2.30 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, respectively, which were obtained from Fig. S2(c).†

It is clear that the Dapp value decreased with increasing content of POEI-TEMPO in the electrolyte. This is due to the increase of the viscosity of the electrolyte (ηvisc) by the presence of the additive.39,48 The ηvisc of the electrolytes with 0 wt% and 10 wt% of POEI-TEMPO cannot be obtained due to the detection limit (<1.6 cP) of the instrument. The ηvisc of the electrolytes containing 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO were 6.74, 346.1, 4298, and 5955 cP, respectively. It is noted that the value of ηvisc increased with increasing amount of POEI-TEMPO. Further addition of POEI-TEMPO would lead to higher ηvisc and a lower Dapp value, as seen in Table 2.
The EIS analysis was carried out to study the value of σ by using the symmetrical dummy cell, whereas the bias voltage was applied at −0.85 V. The bulk resistance (Rbulk) was measured from the first fitting semicircle of the EIS result49–51 (Fig. 5a), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The value of σ was calculated using the following eqn (6):47 σ = d(ARbulk)−1(6)where the cell constant d/A was calibrated by using a standard NaCl electrolyte (σ = 12.9 mS cm−1). The values of σ for the electrolytes containing 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO were found to be 13.44, 9.69, 9.31, 6.65, 6.56 and 5.41 mS cm−1, respectively (Table 2). It indicates that the σ value decreases steadily with the increase in the content of POEI-TEMPO in the electrolyte. From the LSV studies, it can be observed that the value of Jlim decreased with increasing wt% of POEI-TEMPO. According to eqn (5), the resultant value of Dapp, as shown in Table 2, follows the same order of Jlim, as given in Fig. S2.† The above-mentioned results reveal that both Dapp and σ would decrease with increasing content of the non-conductive additive.39,48

(d) Nyquist plots of the same DSSCs performed at 1 sun (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G) with an open-circuit bias. 
3.3. Charge transfer properties of gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes in DSSCs
The EIS technique was applied to study the charge transfer properties of the POEI-TEMPO polymer in the dark (Fig. 5b and c) and under 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) light illumination (Fig. 5d). The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2.
There are different processes occurring in the cell under the dark or 1 sun light illumination. At an open-circuit voltage and sunlight illumination, there is no net current flowing through the cell. All of the injected electrons are recaptured by TEMPO+ and I3− before being extracted to the external circuit. Meanwhile, the oxidized dye is regenerated by TEMPO˙ and I−. As a result, the absorbed photon energy is converted to heat through the two redox couples involving electron injection, dye regeneration, and electron recapture by TEMPO+ and I3−. The counter electrode is kept at equilibrium because there is no net current flowing through it. However, in the dark under the forward bias, electrons are transported through the mesoscopic TiO2 network and react with TEMPO+ and I3−. At the same time, TEMPO˙ and I− are oxidized at the counter electrode to form TEMPO+ and I3−, respectively.52–54 Under the dark conditions, the Nyquist plots were measured at −0.85 V and the three semicircles were observed, as shown in Fig. 5b. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte was obtained by calculating the diameter of the second semicircle in the EIS curve. The Rrec values are listed in Table 2, which shows a decrease of Rrec in the order of 30 > 25 > 20 > 15 > 10 > 0 wt% POEI-TEMPO. A larger Rrec value was noticed due to the lower recombination reaction at the interface. Fig. 5c shows the Bode phase plots of the cells collected under dark conditions. The electron lifetime (τdarke) in a photoanode can be measured by using the frequency value at maxima phase (fmax), as shown in eqn (7):47 τdarke = (2πfmax)−1(7)
Both values of Rrec and τdarke decrease as the wt% of the POEI-TEMPO decreases, in the order of 30 (58.59 Ω, 27.17 ms) > 25 (49.81 Ω, 23.11 ms) > 20 (42.33 Ω, 19.63 ms) > 15 (34.34 Ω, 16.67 ms) > 10 (34.05 Ω, 14.18 ms) > liquid iodide electrolyte (20.91 Ω, 12.06 ms). This reveals that the integration of POEI-TEMPO with the liquid iodide electrolyte would extend the electron lifetime and inhibit the charge recombination reaction. The following key functions of POEI-TEMPO contribute to the better performance: (1) The POEI-TEMPO could chelate Li+ potassium cations through the lone pair electrons of the poly-(oxyethylene) segment, and thus prevent Li+ from the TiO2 surface.39 (2) TEMPO serves as the cationic redox mediator, which offers a larger heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (k0) with a greater diffusivity than those of iodide.28 On the other hand, the cell with the iodide electrolyte (without POEI-TEMPO) retains the shortest τdarke due to the charge recombination of the electrons with Li+ and I3− ions. The tendency of the τdarke values (30 > 25 > 20 > 15 > 10 > 0 wt% of POEI-TEMPO) agrees with the trend of the VOC values.
The charge transfer properties of the DSSC were estimated under 1 sun from the EIS measurement. The EIS results can be classified into three parts: (1) charge transfer resistance at the interface of the Pt/electrolyte (Rct1), (2) charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte (Rct2), and (3) Warburg diffusion resistance (Zw).47
The values of Rct1, Rct2, and Zw were obtained from the diameters of the first, second, and third semicircles observed in the high, middle, and low frequency range of the Nyquist plots, respectively (Fig. 5d). As summarized in Table 2, the values of Rct1, Rct2, and Zw all decrease in the order of 30 > 25 > 20 > 15 > 10 > 0 wt% POEI-TEMPO. It can be seen from Tables 2 and 3 that both physical and charge transfer properties of the electrolyte in the DSSC affect its JSC value. In fact, the higher the values of the physical parameters, σ and Dapp, the higher the JSC value. On the other hand, the higher the values of the electrochemical parameters, Rct1, Rct2, and Zw, the lower the JSC value. This can be explained by the increase in the ηvisc of the electrolyte due to the addition of a non-conductive poly-(oxyethylene) segment. A similar observation has been reported.39,48 It is notable that the JSC values are highly consistent with the values of Rct1 and Rct2; meanwhile, the Zw values agree well with the Dapp values.

As mentioned earlier, Rct2 and Rrec represent the charge transfer resistances under light and dark conditions, respectively. The charge transfer resistance is represented by a semicircle in the intermediate frequency regime. In the case of a DSSC containing liquid iodine electrolyte (without POEI-TEMPO addition) under illumination, I3− is formed “in situ” by dye regeneration at the mesoporous TiO2/electrolyte interface. Therefore, a higher local I3− concentration can be generated in the porous network under light. This is expected to accelerate the capture of the conduction band electrons, and shorten the electron lifetime within the TiO2 film, thus causing the increase of Rct2. On the contrary, under dark condition with a potential bias, the presence of POEI-TEMPO can effectively inhibit the charge recombination reaction, resulting in an increase in Rrec and extension of the electron lifetime. That is to say that the resultant higher VOC can be ensured.52–55
3.4. Photovoltaic performance of the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes in DSSCs

3.4.1 Cell performance with the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes and liquid type iodide electrolytes. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for the DSSCs with various POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes and different counter electrodes, such as PtCE and PtCE/SMC, obtained at the illumination of 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 6a. The fabricated DSSCs and components are schematically represented in Fig. 6c. The resultant parameters, including the VOC, JSC, FF, and η, are listed in Table 3. Herein, the 0 wt% POEI-TEMPO is considered as the normal liquid type iodide electrolyte. Therefore, the J–V curves of the DSSCs with this liquid iodide electrolyte (i.e., 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPII, and 0.5 M tBP in ACN/MPN (volume ratio = 8/2)) and the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolytes (i.e., adding 0–30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in the liquid iodide electrolyte) were also measured for comparison, as shown in Fig. 6a. The DSSC with 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in liquid iodide electrolyte exhibited a higher VOC (813 mV), higher FF (0.73), and lower JSC (16.60 mA cm−2) than the cell containing liquid iodide electrolyte (VOC = 763 mV, FF = 0.67, and JSC = 18.04 mA cm−2), where PtCE was used as the counter electrode. The obtained larger VOC and FF hinged on each other due to the fact that the TEMPO redox couple (N–O˙/NO+) provides a higher standard redox potential than that of (I−/I3−). In our previous report, we scrutinized that the TEMPO redox couple (N–O˙/NO+) retains a superior redox behavior compared to the iodide redox couple (I−/I3−).28 Therefore, the Rct at the interface of the counter electrode/electrolyte in the case of (N–O˙/NO+) was lower than that of (I−/I3−). In brief, the gel type POEI-TEMPO-based electrolyte rendered higher VOC and FF with higher η when compared to the device based on the liquid iodide electrolyte. The above results indicate that the POEI-TEMPO with iodide redox couple (I−/I3−) is a preferred gel type electrolyte for efficient and stable DSSCs.
 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage curves of DSSCs using different concentrations of electrolytes and counter electrodes (PtCE (a and b) and PtCE/SMC (c)) under 1 sun illumination (with an open-circuit bias) and dark conditions (with an applied bias of −0.85 V), and (d) the bar graph shows the deviation between the values of JSC and JSC-IPCE at various concentrations. 


3.4.2. Variation in VOC of DSSCs with POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes. 
According to Table 3, the VOC values of the DSSCs increased from 763 to 860 mV by increasing the weight percentage of POEI-TEMO (0–30 wt%) in the iodide electrolyte. On the other hand, the pristine liquid iodide electrolyte (0 wt% of POEI-TEMPO) incurred only the negative recombination reaction, leading to a lower VOC value. The increasing weight percent of POEI-TEMPO in the electrolyte would decrease the recombination reactions, along with increasing the values of VOC. The above-mentioned VOC results were once again verified by the onset potential (Vonset), as obtained from the intersection of the two straight lines from the J–V plot (Fig. 6b). From this plot, the effective suppression of the charge recombination reactions and the resultant higher Vonset can be identified. As the POEI-TEMPO content in the electrolyte increases, the Vonset of the J–V curve shifted to higher potential. Moreover, the dark current decreases with increased POEI-TEMPO content at the same potential. These results show that the addition of POEI-TEMPO retards the charge recombination, leading to the enhancement of VOC and reduction in the dark current.56

Table 3 shows the value of Vonset for the corresponding weight percent of POEI-TEMPO in the order of 30 > 25 > 20 > 15 > 10 > 0 wt%. The proposed POEI-TEMPO-based electrolyte exhibited a higher VOC, as compared to the cell with the traditional liquid iodide electrolyte due to the important factors, such as (1) the poly-(oxyethylene) segment in POEI-TEMPO inhibits the recombination reactions and maintains the Fermi level of TiO2 at a more negative potential;28,57,58 (2) the TEMPO redox couple (N–O˙/NO+) in POEI-TEMPO provides a more positive standard redox potential.28,57,58


3.4.3. Variation in JSC for DSSCs with POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes. 
In the case of the POEI-TEMPO-based DSSCs, the changes of JSC relating to several abovementioned parameters, including σ of the electrolyte, Dapp of the redox species in the electrolyte, Rct2, and Zw of the cell. These parameters are listed in Table 2. For increasing the quantity of POEI-TEMPO from 0 to 30 wt% in the electrolyte, the JSC of the QSS-DSSC decreased drastically (from 18.04 to 15.54 mA cm−2). Moreover, the value of σ (from 15.78 to 11.87 mS cm−1), and Dapp (from 2.56 × 10−6 to 1.02 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) decreased significantly. Meanwhile, the values of Rct2 (from 11.85 to 21.80 Ω) and Zw (from 5.07 to 11.05 Ω) were apparently increased by the increase in the wt% of POEI-TEMPO. In fact, the physical parameters, σ and Dapp, decreased with increasing ηvisc, while the charge transfer parameters, Rct1, Rct2, and Zw, increased with increasing ηvisc.39,48
In addition, the bifacial PtCE/SMC counter electrode proposed in this study achieved a higher JSC value than that of the normal PtCE. The obtained results are tabulated in Table 3. By using PtCE/SMC as the counter electrode, the photocurrent density was significantly increased due to the maximum reflection of light through the silver mirrors coating, and a greatly reduced loss of light. The UV-vis spectra were used to further investigate the DSSC transmittance and reflectance, as shown in Fig. S3.† From this analysis, the transmittance of TiO2 was founded to be 23.4% and the reflectance to be 6.6%. Meanwhile, the average reflectances of PtCE and PtCE/SMC were measured to be 10.3 and 93.7%, respectively. The above results were calculated from the total incident light, as shown in Scheme S1.† Owing to the higher reflection and lower waste of incident light, the PtCE/SMC-based DSSC is considered as a promising candidate to achieve higher JSC values.

Fig. 7 shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm at the short-circuit condition. The IPCE values were calculated viaeqn (8), where λ is the wavelength, JSC (λ) is the specific short-circuit photocurrent density obtained at a specific wavelength, and φ is the incident radiation flux.56,59,60 (8)
 Fig. 7  Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of DSSCs with various wt% of POEI-TEMPO in the liquid iodide electrolyte. (inset) Digital photographic image for different wt% of POEI-TEMPO. 
The JSC value of a DSSC can also be calculated from the IPCE spectra (denoted as JSC-IPCE) by integrating the area under the IPCE curve. The JSC-IPCE values of DSSCs with 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in the liquid iodide electrolytes are found to be 13.77, 13.36, 13.14, 12.52, 11.91, and 11.44 mA cm−2, respectively. The trend of the JSC-IPCE values is consistent with that of the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves.
In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 6d that there is a 15% deviation between the values of JSC and JSC-IPCE. In general, the monochromator only allows the operating wavelength from 400 to 800 nm; it does not cover the ultraviolet (UV, 300–400 nm wavelength) light spectral region. Therefore, JSC > JSC-IPCE. According to previous literature, the contribution of JSC-IPCE from 300 to 400 nm is responsible for 10–20% deviation, which explains the difference between the values of JSC and JSC-IPCE.61–64


3.4.4. Variation in FF of DSSCs with POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes. 
The increasing value of FF is related to the factor that the increase of the non-conductive poly-(oxyethylene) segment in the electrolyte would facilitate an excellent retardation effect for the recombination reactions. The DSSCs containing 20 wt% or less of POEI-TEMPO in the liquid iodide electrolyte retain high FF values. This is due to the suppression of the charge recombination. On the other hand, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the POEI-TEMPO gel electrolyte decreases for the additive over 20 wt%. The polymer gel electrolyte is dominated by the crystalline polymer matrix, which exhibits inferior ionic transport performance and leads to the decrease in the FF. This slows down the supply of I3− ions to the Pt counter electrode, causing a depletion of I3− at its surface, thus decreasing the FF of the cell.65,66 In addition, POEI-TEMPO acts as an electrolyte additive, while TEMPO serves as the cationic redox mediator. This offers a larger heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (k0) than those of iodide, and it shows a higher FF value compared to the liquid iodide electrolyte.28
Meanwhile, the decreasing value of FF is ascribed to the overdose of the non-conductive poly-(oxyethylene) segment, which induces the rapid decrease in σ and Dapp (Table 3). From this table, a decreased value of FF was observed when the addition of POEI-TEMPO was more than 20%. Thus, DSSCs with more than 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO exhibited the reduced value of both JSC and FF. Therefore, the FF values follow a trend of first rising and then falling.
In fact, the PtCE/SMC-based DSSC device with 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO reached a higher η of 9.83%, with VOC (813 mV), JSC (16.60 mA cm−2), and FF (0.73). The obtained result is comparatively higher than that of the 0 wt% POEI-TEMPO (η = 9.29%)-based device (Fig. 6c). Table 3 shows the addition parameters for various electrolytes and different counter electrodes relevant to the content mentioned earlier.

3.5 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs containing POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes under indoor-light conditions
The standard indoor illumination possesses an intensity value between 900 and 6000 lux. The illuminance is similar to the irradiance (watts per square metre) of outdoor devices.13 As a comparison between the two units, a full solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) corresponds to 100000–110000 lux. Thus, the indoor light of 1000 lux is associated with ∼1% of the standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation.
For this experiment, a typical T5 fluorescent lamp (the standard for current indoor light testing) was chosen, and the DSSCs were tested under realistic indoor conditions. The light absorption of DSSCs is restricted to the visible part of the solar spectrum. It is estimated that the efficiency of DSSCs in the visible region (400–700 nm) can be doubled.67 In fact, the indoor-light sources emit mostly visible light. Taking this into consideration, the DSSC under full solar illumination is expected to achieve an η of ∼20%.
The DSSCs with 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO and different counter electrodes, such as PtCE and PtCE/SMC, were first tested in a T5 lamp environment with light intensity range of 900 to 6000 lux. The obtained results are shown in Table 4. The photoelectric conversion efficiency increased with increasing light intensity from 900 to 6000 lux. This phenomenon is divided into two parts: the first is about the role of the dye, which should be able to efficiently harvest both sunlight and artificial dim lights.68 The second part is the role of a PtCE/SMC, which offers a higher photocurrent density than that of a PtCE through the reflection of silver mirrors and the great reduction of wasted light. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 8, the PtCE/SMC-based DSSC with 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO exhibited improved performance with an excellent η of 25.99% with VOC (700 mV), JSC (944.9 μA cm−2) and FF (0.76) at 6000 lux. This proves that an efficient DSSC was developed in this study, and a successful estimation of the photovoltaics performance of the cells was achieved with high hope in commercialization. As mentioned earlier, the bifacial architecture (PtCE/SMC) is intended to increase the secondary reflection and to have better utilization of photons, so as to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency, as seen in Tables 3 and 4.69

3.6. Long-term stability of DSSCs containing POEI-TEMPO-based gel type electrolytes

Fig. 9 displays the long-term stability of the DSSCs based on the electrolytes comprising different wt% of POEI-TEMPO, and different counter electrodes (PtCE and PtCE/SMC). Various performance parameters (η, JSC, FF, and VOC) for the proposed DSSCs are normalized against their initial values. In this experiment, a 25 μm thick Surlyn® film was used to fix the cell gap and seal the cell by heating. To avoid the solvent evaporation, epoxy glue was used to cover the inlet holes, which are used to inject the electrolyte.
 Fig. 9  Various performance parameters for the proposed DSSCs over a period of 2000 h testing under 1 sun condition (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The trend shows the (a) normalized efficiency, (b) normalized short-circuit current density, (c) normalized open-circuit voltage, and (d) normalized fill factor. 
The solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) was used to simulate the DSSCs under 1 sun condition. The cell η was calculated for every 24 h over a period of 2000 h. When the solar simulator was operated, the surface temperature of the cell can rise to 50–80 °C under light soaking condition for 10 min.
Among them, it can be observed from Fig. 9a that the SMC plays an important role in enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency. As for the long-term stability testing up to 2000 h (3 months), it is seen that the PtCE/SMC cell decays slightly faster than the PtCE cell. On the other hand, 20 wt% POEI-TEMPO does enhance the conversion efficiency regardless of the bifacial or normal architecture CE. The best DSSC with 20 wt% POEI-TEMPO and PtCE retains around 90% of its initial cell efficiency at 2000 h. It is also observed from Fig. 9b that the JSC values follow a similar trend with the photoelectric conversion efficiency. In Fig. 9c, it can be seen that the deviation of the VOC value between the cells contain 20 wt% additive with PtCE, and 0 wt% additive with PtCE/SMC is only 0.01%. Fig. 9d shows that the FF value has a very small deviation of about 0.04% between these two cells. From these results, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) a significant decrease in the photoelectric conversion efficiency is mainly due to the decrease of the JSC value, whereas the influence of VOC and FF is negligible; (2) as for the long-term stability test, the thermal stress generated by the sunlight would strongly have an impact on the DSSC performance. This accelerates the degradation of the sensitizer and electrolyte, leading to a decrease of the JSC value;70 (3) finally, the two mentioned components, namely SMC and POEI-TEMPO, play different roles in enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability, respectively. It is concluded that our newly prepared POEI-TEMPO polymer not only improves the VOC, but also enhances the long-term durability. This offers unlimited possibilities for the future applications of DSSC.
4. Conclusions
A novel polymer POEI-TEMPO was synthesized and applied as a multifunctional gel electrolyte for QSS-DSSCs. The POEI-TEMPO polymer was well characterized using NMR, FTIR spectroscopies and TGA. The electrochemical properties of the polymer were characterized by measuring the EIS, CV, LSV and J–V performance. As a result, the desirable 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in liquid iodide electrolyte was found to be sufficient to form a gel and help in reducing the recombination side reaction. Furthermore, the JSC value was greatly improved by using the PtCE/SMC counter electrode. Moreover, the PtCE/SMC-based device with 20 wt% of POEI-TEMPO in 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) exhibited a good η of 9.83%. Using the proposed polymer ionic liquid electrolyte, the DSSC with a bifacial PtCE/SMC achieved a high efficiency (η = 25.99%) under the indoor light intensity of 6000 lux, while the DSSC with a normal PtCE showed a reasonably good long-term durability by maintaining 90% of its initial efficiency after 2000 h illumination. This revealed that the POEI-TEMPO polymer ionic liquid significantly improves the performance of DSSCs, and is thus suitable for practical applications.
