Pulsed ultraviolet laser irradiation of titania films is a simple process for making oxygen-deficient black titania (TiO2−x) films that use the solar spectrum efficiently. TiO2−x photoanodes were obtained by KrF laser irradiation under low-vacuum conditions for several minutes. The TiO2−x film had a larger absorbance than pristine TiO2 in the visible light region, and it exhibited a substantial increase in photoelectrochemical water splitting under simulated solar light. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of the TiO2−x photoanode reached 0.52%, which was 2.6-fold higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode. This rapid fabrication process for black titania photoanodes has great potential for industrial solar hydrogen production.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting has great potential for providing sustainable energy.1–5 Photoelectrodes containing semiconductor films for solar water splitting systems have been studied extensively. Improvements in the water splitting efficiency in the visible light region have been reported.6–9 The n-type semiconductor, TiO2, is the most common photocatalyst because of its high photocatalytic activity, stability, and low cost.10–12 The wide band gap (∼3.2 eV) of TiO2 reduces the photocatalytic response in the visible light region, which covers the majority of the solar spectrum. However, photocatalytic activity has been increased by improving the visible light response through the use of blackened forms of TiO2 such as hydrogen-doped TiO2 (TiO2:H),13,14 sulfur-doped TiO2 (TiO2:S),15 and oxygen deficient TiO2−x.16,17
However, blackening pristine TiO2 takes a minimum of several hours because of the low process temperature and hazardous conditions necessary for some methods. For example, TiO2:H requires annealing at 200 °C for 5 days in high-pressure H2 gas at 20 bar,13 TiO2:S requires annealing at 600 °C for 4 h in H2S gas,15 and TiO2−x requires annealing at 500 °C for 6 h under high-vacuum conditions below 0.5 Pa.16 Therefore, simple, rapid fabrication processes for black titania are desirable.
Recently, ultraviolet (UV) laser-induced crystal nucleation and the growth of oxide thin films from solution have been studied,18–20 and efficient polycrystalline growth of TiO2 thin films from a precursor has been reported.21–23 We have also studied oxygen deficiency induced in a rutile TiO2 single-crystal surface by pulsed UV laser irradiation.24 This treatment produced an unconventional metallic state in the oxygen-deficient TiO2−x that was not converted to TinO2n−1 Magnéli phases,25,26 and maintained its original rutile crystal structure with stacking faults. This oxygen deficiency was created by instantaneous photothermal heating under the pulsed UV laser irradiation. Against this background, we aimed to produce polycrystalline black titania photoanodes efficiently by UV laser irradiation of TiO2 films. We achieved very rapid conversion, within only a few minutes, of a pristine TiO2 film into an oxygen-deficient TiO2−x film. The blackened film showed a 2.6-fold higher solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency than the pristine film.
Experimental procedure
Sample preparation
The bottom electrode for the photoanode consisted of 10 mol% antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2:Sb) films with a thickness of 1.2 μm. (We employed SnO2:Sb as the bottom electrode in this study since the conducting property of SnO2:Sb is stable for thermal treatments.) A polycrystalline Al2O3 substrate (96%, Kyocera) was spin coated with a dispersion of SnO2:Sb nanoparticles (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) at 2000 rpm for 5 s. The films were preheated at 400 °C for 10 min and fired at 700 °C for 1 h in air. TiO2 films were prepared by metal–organic deposition. The SnO2:Sb/Al2O3 substrates were spin coated with the starting metal–organic solution (0.5 M Ti, SYM-TI05; Symetrix) at 3000 rpm for 10 s. The spin-coated films were preheated at 300 °C for 10 min to convert them into precursor amorphous oxide films by decomposing the organic components. The spin coating and preheating were repeated five times to increase the film thickness to 250 nm. The precursor TiO2 films were heated at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The TiO2/SnO2:Sb/Al2O3 specimen was treated as a pristine reference sample. Two post-treatments were carried out on the reference TiO2 films: (1) pulsed KrF laser (Compex110, Lambda Physik) irradiation at a fluence of 50–170 mJ cm−2 for 150 s at 50 Hz with a pulse duration of 26 ns at room temperature under a vacuum of 500 Pa using a rotary pump or in air, and (2) post-annealing at 700 °C for 6 h in air. For optical absorption and electrical resistivity measurements, silica glass substrates were used without the bottom electrode films. We also prepared a titania film by using KrF laser irradiation through the following procedure, called the “irradiation at each deposition” (IED) process. The SnO2:Sb/Al2O3 substrate was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 10 s from the same starting solution as the TiO2 film. The film was preheated at 300 °C for 10 min and then heated at 500 °C for 10 min in air. The precursor film was irradiated with the KrF laser at 80 mJ cm−2 for 100 s at 50 Hz under a vacuum of 500 Pa at room temperature. This process was repeated five times to increase the film thickness to 250 nm.
Characterization
The phase purity and crystallinity of the TiO2 thin films on the SnO2:Sb/Al2O3 substrates were determined by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) with an incidence angle of 0.5°. The surface morphology and cross-sectional structure were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S800). The surface area evaluation was carried out by using an atomic force microscope (AFM; Nanopics 2100, SII). The optical absorbance spectra of titania films on silica substrates were recorded with a UV-visible spectrometer (UV-3150, Shimadzu). The electrical resistivity (ρ) of the titania films on silica glass substrates under KrF laser irradiation was measured by using a digital multimeter (KT-2010, Kaise) with two probe contacts. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an Al Kα source. Raman spectra were collected by using a laser Raman spectrometer (NRS 7100, Jasco).
Temperature simulations for photothermal heating
Temperature variations during laser irradiation can be described by the heat diffusion equation simplified to describe one-dimensional heat flow27 (1)where T is the temperature function at time t and depth z, ρ is the mass density, C is the specific heat capacity, α is the optical absorption coefficient, κ is the thermal conductivity, and I(z, t) is the laser power density. Details of the calculation are explained in the ESI.†
PEC performance evaluation
Under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 simulated sunlight (1 sun) from a 150 W Xe lamp, linear sweep voltammetry for solar water splitting photocurrent measurements was performed in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 13.6) at 0.0–1.5 V vs. a reverse hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a quartz glass window. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode in saturated KCl solution and a Pt wire counter electrode were used, and the scan rate was 5 mV s−1. The measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl (VAg/AgCl) in the three electrode system was converted to the VRHE according to a following equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + V0Ag/AgCl, where V0Ag/AgCl = 0.1976 at 25 °C. The STH efficiency (η) of the photoanodes was measured by using the two-electrode configuration cell with the Pt wire as the counter electrode. The following equation was used for estimating STH values: η = J (1.23 − ECE)/IAM1.5, where J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), ECE is the applied bias voltage vs. the counter electrode, and IAM1.5 is the irradiance of AM1.5 simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was evaluated by the three electrode setup with the equation IPCE = 1240 J/λI, where λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), and I is the intensity of the light source at each wavelength (mW cm−2). The bias voltage was 0.55 VRHE. The monochromatic light was generated using a Xe lamp with optical narrow-band filters. The evolved H2 gas detection was carried out by using a thermal conductivity detector gas chromatograph (GC-8AIT, Shimadzu).
Results and discussion
Structural and physical properties

Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology of the pristine and laser-irradiated samples. As the irradiation fluence increased, a mud-crack pattern associated with volume shrinkage caused by rapid crystallite growth was observed. The in-plane discrete island size was 0.5–1 μm at fluences below 110 mJ cm−2 and 1–2 μm above 140 mJ cm−2. Above 110 mJ cm−2, the top TiO2 surface may have also partially melted, as indicated by the simulated pulsed photothermal heating profiles.

The crystallinity and structure of the samples were analyzed with the GIXRD patterns (Fig. 2a). The pristine TiO2 thin film crystallized at 500 °C showed a pure anatase phase. Post-annealing at 700 °C and pulsed UV laser irradiation caused a small amount of phase conversion from anatase to rutile TiO2. The GIXRD peak intensity of the TiO2 film increased by the laser irradiation in air up to a fluence of 110 mJ cm−2, and then it decreased above 140 mJ cm−2. For vacuum irradiation, the diffraction intensity decreased above 50 mJ cm−2 after crystallite growth at 50 mJ cm−2 compared with the pristine sample (Fig. 2b). Larger laser-induced crystallites should grow nearer to the surface than the interface, as reported for typical laser-irradiated oxide thin films.18,20,28 The reduction of the peak intensity indicates that there was no sufficiently coherent periodic structure for stoichiometric TiO2 near the irradiated surface. The rutile TiO2 peaks also appeared due to the laser irradiation in both air and under vacuum. The quantitative ratio of the rutile phase increased with the laser fluence (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 3 shows photographs of the color of the samples. The pristine TiO2/SnO2:Sb film was light gray because of the bottom electrode SnO2:Sb film. After pulsed laser irradiation in air and under vacuum, the film surface became darker. However, the samples irradiated under vacuum clearly exhibited a homogeneous color, in contrast to the uneven darkening exhibited by the samples irradiated in air. The blackening effect of the laser irradiation was also confirmed by the optical absorbance measurements of the TiO2 thin films on silica glass for laser irradiation under vacuum at 500 Pa (Fig. 4). The intrinsic optical absorption in the visible range (<400 nm) was clear in the samples irradiated with fluences greater than 80 mJ cm−2. The increasing optical absorption of visible light also indicates the presence of oxygen deficiency in TiO2.16 The light gray color was also confirmed in the sample after the laser irradiation as shown in the inset photographic image in Fig. 4. (The prepared TiO2 film on the silica substrate looked light pink due to the interference effect because of the compact and flat thin film form).

Fig. 5a shows cross-sectional SEM images of the reference sample. A compact TiO2 film on the bottom SnO2:Sb electrode is visible. The laser irradiation at 80 mJ cm−2 produced a mud-cracked TiO2−x film with curled edges which also caused the upper part of the SnO2:Sb bottom electrode to crack. The compact TiO2−x film only covered the top of the bottom electrode, and did not coat the surface in the cracks (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the roughened surface did not increase the surface area of the TiO2−x film. In contrast, the TiO2−x layer covered the entire surface of the mud-cracked bottom electrode in the sample prepared by the IED process at 80 mJ cm−2 (Fig. 5c) through repeated coating and irradiation. In this case, the coated cracks increased the surface area of the TiO2−x film, and thus the IED process was expected to enhance the PEC activity. Fig. 5d shows the AFM images for these samples. The surface areas of samples for the observed region (4 × 4 μm2) prepared by conventional and IED laser irradiation were actually calculated to be 123% (20.3 μm2) and 119% (19.6 μm2) of the reference sample (16.5 μm2), respectively. The surface morphology of each sample is summarized in Fig. 5e.

Fig. 6a shows the XPS survey scans of the samples. The peaks for the reference sample were assigned to Ti (2s, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2) and O (1s) from the TiO2 layer. In the TiO2−x film that was irradiated with 80 mJ cm−2, additional peaks assigned to Sn (3d3/2, 3d5/2, 3p1/2 and 3p3/2) and Sb (3p3/2) derived from the bottom electrode were observed because of the surface micro-cracks (Fig. 1d and 5b). However, the Sn and Sb peaks disappeared in the TiO2−x film prepared by IED. The top surface of the cracked SnO2:Sb bottom electrode in this sample was almost completely covered by TiO2−x. This also suggests that the surface morphology proposed in Fig. 5e is correct.

Fig. 6b shows the Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 XPS peaks of the titania films before and after irradiation at 80 mJ cm−2. The binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 were 464.3 and 458.5 eV, respectively, in both samples. These peaks were assigned as Ti4+ ions in TiO2. For the O 1s XPS peak, there were two signals assigned to the Ti–O bond at 529.8 eV and the Ti–OH bond at 531.2 eV.29 These results suggest that the top surface of oxygen-deficient TiO2−x was reoxidized in the ambient atmosphere after the laser irradiation. The lack of a shift in the Ti and O XPS peaks indicating reoxidization of the top surface has been reported previously for oxygen-deficient black titania.16,30 A slight increase in the XPS peak corresponding to the Ti–OH bond in the laser-irradiated sample originated from the adsorption of atmospheric humidity at the oxygen-deficient sites, which were created during laser irradiation.
The reoxidation of the top surface after the pulsed laser irradiation was confirmed by the XPS studies, nevertheless, the oxygen deficiency in the laser irradiated samples was clearly proved by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 7 shows the irradiated laser fluence dependence of Raman spectra. In the pristine TiO2 film, the observed peaks were assigned to the Eg modes at 144, 202, and 645 cm−1, the B1g mode at 397 cm−1, and the A1g mode at 515 cm−1. After the pulsed laser irradiation, these peaks were obviously weakened and broadened with the increasing laser fluence. Additionally, a slight blue shift of the peak at 144 cm−1 was observed due to an emergence of a new peak at around 150 cm−1 (Fig. 7a). This result strongly supports the oxygen deficiency of laser irradiated TiO2 films as reported in previous studies on the oxygen deficient TiO2−x.16,31,32

Fig. 8a shows the electrical resistivity (ρ) during laser irradiation. Before irradiation, the pristine TiO2 film had a very high resistivity of ρ > 1.5 × 105 Ω cm, which was above the measurement limit of the instrument. However, ρ dropped suddenly when laser irradiation at 80 mJ cm−2 under vacuum began, and reached 7.9 × 102 Ω cm at 180 s after the first laser pulse. This indicates that the conductivity was increased by the conduction electrons of Ti3+, which was generated by the oxygen deficiency. After the laser irradiation ceased, ρ gradually increased in air, and was saturated at 7.8 × 103 Ω cm. This result strongly suggests that oxygen was released by the laser irradiation and that the top surface reoxidized after the laser pulse ceased. The laser on/off dependence on ρ for the TiO2−x films is shown in Fig. 8b. ρ cyclically decreased and increased when laser was alternately switched on and off, respectively. This reversible behavior is also consistent with laser-induced oxygen release and subsequent reoxidation.

Next, we discuss the laser irradiation process for the TiO2 films using the temperature simulations shown in Fig. 9a and S1.† The calculation for the bottom SnO2:Sb electrode was approximated by undoped SnO2. The irradiated KrF laser pulse causes instantaneous heating, and the calculated temperature reaches a maximum of 1081, 1718, and 2354 °C at 35 ns after the incident pulse at fluences of 50, 80, and 110 mJ cm−2, respectively. Thereafter, the temperature is quenched to 20 °C. The depth profile reveals that the elevated temperature was highest at the film surface and it drops toward the substrate interface. In the Ellingham diagram,33 the calculated maximum temperature at 80–110 mJ cm−2 at the TiO2 film surface in air and under vacuum at 500 Pa was in the ideal region for oxygen-deficient TiO2−x, whereas TiO2 appeared to be still stable at 50 mJ cm−2 (Fig. 9b). The photothermal heating and rapid quenching achieved by pulsed laser irradiation successfully captured the high-temperature phase. The oxygen-deficient content (x) may have had a gradient profile because of the temperature gradient from the surface (Fig. 9a) if sufficient oxygen diffusion did not occur after the laser pulse ceased (quenching temperature). Irradiation at 110 mJ cm−2 would be suitable for creating oxygen deficiencies in the TiO2 film; however, it reaches temperatures above the melting point of TiO2 (1843 °C).34 This produced the large cracks observed in the samples irradiated with 140 and 170 mJ cm−2. Thus, on the basis of the optical absorption, electrical resistivity, and temperature simulations under laser irradiation, we conclude that the pulsed UV laser irradiation successfully induced oxygen deficiencies in TiO2 films, and this process was effective to form rapidly black titania photoanodes.

PEC property for solar water splitting
Linear-sweep photovoltammetry was carried out to evaluate the PEC property of pristine TiO2 and oxygen-deficient TiO2−x photoanodes for solar water splitting (Fig. 10a). The photocurrent density of the pristine TiO2 film at 1.23 VRHE was 0.503 mA cm−2, and the onset potential was 0.200 VRHE. The maximum η was 0.20% at 0.645 VCE (Fig. 10b). In the TiO2−x films prepared by laser irradiation under vacuum, the photocurrent density at 1.23 VRHE increased substantially with the irradiated laser fluence up to 110 mJ cm−2, and then decreased above 140 mJ cm−2. Moreover, the onset potential (Eonset) was lower in samples that were irradiated with laser fluences of 50–110 mJ cm−2 compared with the pristine TiO2 photoanode.
 Fig. 10  (a) J–V curves and (b) η of pristine TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes laser irradiated under vacuum, measured under simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6). (c) ηmax and EOP for the TiO2−x photoanodes irradiated under vacuum and in air as a function of laser fluence. 
The sample irradiated with 80 mJ cm−2 showed the highest maximum η (ηmax) of 0.45%, because the optimum potential for ηmax (EOP) reached a minimum (0.560 VCE) at this laser fluence (Table 1 and Fig. 10c). High laser fluences greater than 110 mJ cm−2 that resulted in excessive photothermal heating should negatively influence the extrinsic transport in TiO2−x/SnO2:Sb. The variation of EOP and ηmax as a function of the laser fluence for irradiation in air was the same as that under vacuum (Fig. 10c and S2†). However, the vacuum process produced a higher ηmax and reduced the effective bias voltage. This is probably because of the homogeneous oxygen release at the film surface (Fig. 3).

A concern generally arises for the origin of photocurrent in the oxygen deficient photoanodes whether the observed photocurrent is derived from the water splitting or self-oxidation of photoanodes. However, the possibility of the self-oxidation effect was eliminated in our samples by following the results. Fig. 11a shows photocurrent stability of pristine TiO2 and oxygen deficient TiO2−x photoanodes at 1.20 VRHE. The photocurrent of pristine TiO2 after 15 min from the starting excitation was maintained at 96% from the initial value. The laser irradiated samples also showed comparably high stability of photocurrent: they retained 92–107% at 15 min, indicating the continuous PEC reaction. Moreover, we successfully observed a H2 evolution from both samples with and without the laser irradiation under 100 mW cm−2 excitation at 0.55 VCE. The H2 gas evolution rates for pristine and laser irradiated (80 mJ cm−2) samples were calculated as 8.4 and 18.7 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively. The enhancement of the H2 evolution rate in the laser irradiated sample almost corresponded with the increase of photocurrent. These results evidence that the laser irradiated TiO2−x photoanode demonstrated the intrinsic water splitting and the enhancement of PEC property.
 Fig. 11  Time dependences of (a) photocurrent and (b) H2 evolution of pristine TiO2 and TiO2−x photoanodes laser irradiated under vacuum, measured under simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6). The inset of (a) shows the ratio of photocurrent at 15 min from the starting excitation as a function of irradiated laser fluence. 

Fig. 12a shows the photocurrent density and η of the TiO2 photoanode post-annealed at 700 °C. Post-annealing reduced Eonset, although it did not enhance the η value, indicating that the formation of the interface between the anatase and rutile phases did not increase the photocurrent in this system. In addition, we examined the continuous post treatment dependence of the photocurrent density of the TiO2−x(TiO2) photoanodes. Fig. 10a shows that the laser irradiation at 80 mJ cm−2 under vacuum produced a large increase in the photocurrent. This sample was post-annealed at 500 °C for 1 h, and the photocurrent of the sample was reduced to a value similar to that for the pristine TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 12b). After post-annealing, the sample was irradiated again with 80 mJ cm−2 under vacuum, and the photocurrent recovered to the original value for the TiO2−x photoanode. During these treatments, the peak intensity of the GIXRD patterns and the rutile content were almost unchanged (Fig. 12c). This means that the enhancement of the PEC property in the laser-irradiated samples did not originate from the heterointerface, but arose from the oxygen deficiency of the TiO2 films that improved the absorption of the excitatory light over a wide range of wavelengths.
 Fig. 12  (a) J–V curves and η of the pristine and post-annealed (700 °C) TiO2 photoanodes under simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6). (b) The J–V curves of TiO2−x(TiO2) photoanodes for first laser irradiation, oxidation, and second laser irradiation. (c) GIXRD spectra of the TiO2−x(TiO2) photoanodes corresponding to (b). The subscripts A and S represent Al2O3 and SnO2:Sb, respectively. 

Fig. 13a shows the photocurrent density of the laser-irradiated TiO2−x photoanode prepared by IED with an optimum fluence at 80 mJ cm−2 under vacuum. The Eonset was reduced to 0.175 VRHE, and the photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE reached 1.029 mA cm−2. ηmax was 0.52% at 0.560 VRHE (Fig. 13b). This high ηmax was 2.6-fold higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode, and was probably caused by the increase in the surface area by IED.

Fig. 14 shows the IPCE spectra of pristine TiO2 and laser-irradiated (80 mJ cm−2 under vacuum) TiO2−x photoanodes at 0.55 VRHE. The IPCE of the TiO2 photoanode was 6.9% at 340 nm, and decreased to almost zero at around 400 nm. However, in the laser-irradiated TiO2−x photoanodes, the photoresponse was maintained at 480 nm because of the large absorbance of visible light wavelengths (Fig. 4), and the IPCE in the UV range also increased to 12.5% at 340 nm. The IPCE reached 14.3% in the TiO2−x photoanode prepared by IED, and its visible range response was 20-fold greater than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode at 450 nm.

The main origin of PEC property enhancement in the oxygen deficient TiO2−x photoanodes would be the high IPCE in the UV wavelength range. The oxygen vacancy in TiO2 can increase the electron donor density, resulting in the improvement of charge transport and the shifting the Fermi level of TiO2 toward the conduction band.35–37 This would lead to stimulate the charge separation at the reaction interface, which is linked to the enhancement of water splitting. Moreover, the characteristic cross-sectional morphology in the laser irradiated samples would also contribute to the enhancement of PEC property. The structural and physical properties of the pristine and laser-irradiated photoanodes are summarized in Fig. 15. The crystallite size and stoichiometric oxygen content are uniform in the pristine TiO2 layer; therefore, the number of grain boundaries, conductivity, and reduced absorbance for visible light are also homogeneous. In contrast, the laser-irradiated samples would have a gradient distribution of crystallite sizes and oxygen deficiency; the crystallite size and oxygen deficiency increased toward the top surface, although the oxygen deficiency at the top surface was eliminated by reoxidation. The crystallite growth reduced the number of grain boundaries, and the oxygen deficiency enhanced the bulk conductivity. Both of them would increase the majority carrier diffusion length, which is crucial for improving the PEC activity.38,39 Furthermore, because visible light penetrate deeper into the photoanode than UV light, the improved absorption in the visible range means that the interior of the photoanode is used more efficiently. The extended diffusion length of the excited carriers and the efficient use of the excitatory light improve the solar water splitting properties of the laser-irradiated photoanodes.

Thus, we have shown that blackening titania photoanodes by the laser irradiation resulted in a high PEC property for solar water splitting. Moreover, the application of this technique to nanostructured TiO2 is expected to produce further high-performance photoanodes.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that pulsed UV laser irradiation of TiO2 films is a simple, effective process for making oxygen-deficient black titania (TiO2−x) films. The oxygen-deficient TiO2−x photoanodes were fabricated by KrF laser irradiation under low-vacuum conditions for several minutes. The resulting TiO2−x film had a larger absorbance for visible light than pristine TiO2, and it showed a higher PEC property for solar water splitting. The STH efficiency of the TiO2−x photoanode was 0.52%, which was 2.6-fold higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode. Our rapid fabrication process for black titania photoanodes has great potential for industrial solar hydrogen production.
