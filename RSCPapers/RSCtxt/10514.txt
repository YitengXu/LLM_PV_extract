1. Introduction
The great success achieved so far in graphene materials is triggering immense enthusiasm for exploring new two-dimensional (2D) layered inorganic materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),1–3 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),4,5 graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4),6,7 germanene8 and silicene,9 to meet new application requirements.10–15 When these bulk 2D materials are converted into forms with lateral dimensions generally smaller than 100 nm (typically <10 nm), quantum dots (QDs) could be produced resulting from the strong quantum confinement.16,17 As early as 1988,18 molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanoclusters with particle sizes of 10–35 Å were made via cleavage of the van der Waals layers of 2D bulk materials through penetrating solvent molecules.18 This stimulated researchers to explore new types of nanoclusters of graphene,19 h-BN,20 layered double hydroxides (LDHs),21 molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), etc.22 Such semiconductor nanoclusters represent clear quantum confinement effects, and thus are also classified as “QDs”.23 The as-prepared QDs are usually regarded as zero-dimensional (0D), however, they are just smaller forms of their native layered forms in terms of the lateral length dimension. Their 2D lattices in the bulk form can be still maintained by a certain degree when they are exfoliated into the nanoscale. Therefore, herein, “2D-QDs” is reasonably used as an abbreviation for “QDs derived from 2D inorganic materials”.24
2D-QDs maintain most intrinsic properties of their 2D layered forms. More importantly, they are endowed with enhanced or novel physico-chemical properties, such as a better dispersibility in both aqueous and non-aqueous media, easier functionalization or doping and more novel luminescence.16,17,25 Their unique and diverse properties make 2D-QDs applicable in various research fields, including bioimaging,26–30 cancer therapy,27,31,32 sensing,33–38 optoelectronics,28,30,32,39,40,63 catalysis,41,42 supercapacitors43–45 and batteries,46,47etc. (Fig. 1A).

As depicted in Fig. 1B, the numbers of publications on 2D-QDs show a booming trend in recent years, especially since 2010. Among the 2D-QDs, graphene QDs (GQDs) have been dominating this field, while QDs derived from other 2D inorganic materials, such as h-BN, MoS2, g-C3N4, have begun to attract more attention since 2012, but belong to a fairly nascent research domain. Much more efforts are thus required to explore new synthetic methods, their properties, application potentials and the corresponding mechanisms. Some high-quality reviews have been presented in the literature to summarize the studies related to GQDs.48–53 Moreover, Chen et al. took the lead in discussing several kinds of QDs derived from graphene-like 2D materials, including g-C3N4, TMDCs, h-BN and phosphorene, as well as their applications in catalysis and energy.24 However, the vast majority of 2D-QDs applications, including bioimaging, cancer therapy, sensing and optoelectronics, have not been systematically summarized until now. In addition, the 2D-materials family includes a broad range of compositions covering nearly the whole periodic table,24 with a flow of new 2D-QDs continuing in bursts as well as at a steady flow, which has aroused the sharply increasing interest of researchers, and thus they deserve a comprehensive review at this moment in time.
To fill the research gap mentioned above, this review will update the latest research advances and provide comprehensive and critical insights into the booming topic of “2D-QDs”. The categories, versatile synthetic techniques, unique properties, ingenious functionalization and extensive applications of the whole 2D-QDs family, especially the low-toxicity and heavy metal-free ones, will be addressed herein. In the Applications section, special emphasis is placed on the progress in bioimaging, cancer therapy, fluorescent sensing and optoelectronics. Meanwhile, the sections on catalysis and energy storage mainly covers the latest advances since 2015. Moreover, 2D nanoclusters, in particular QDs, are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospective in this field are discussed. This review will help open up and guide new research directions in studying 2D-QDs to meet the higher demands in diverse applications.
2. Categories of 2D-QDs
Heine et al. presented an atlas of 2D materials, which gave researchers referable data for an in-depth understanding in related fields.13 Our further review also enriches this atlas, based on the 2D-QDs discussed herein. The composition of the family of 2D inorganic compounds covers nearly the whole periodic table of chemical elements,3,11,13,54 including graphene, silicene, germanene, phosphorene, fluorographene, fluorosilicene, fluorogermanene, graphane, silicane, germanane, nitrides (e.g. h-BN, g-C3N4), carbides (e.g. silicon carbide, SiC), TMDCs, semimetal chalcogenides, transition metal halides (TMHs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), MXenes, clays, hydroxides, phosphonates, phosphates and ternary compounds (e.g. CuSbS2).11,55Fig. 2 presents most of the proposed 2D layered materials as well as a summary of the experimentally or theoretically studied 2D-QDs. Theoretically, QDs can all be produced from their native bulk layered forms. However, as a nascent field, 2D-QDs have been less studied than their native 2D layered forms.56 Thus, much development room remains for related future research. In addition, to identify whether one kind of QDs is 2D or not, not only the elemental composition but also the phase types should be considered.13 For example, ZnO can exist in various phases, where only α-ZnO belongs to the layered materials, and thus only QDs derived from bulk α-ZnO are classified as 2D-QDs.57–60 Other substances, such as α-CdTe, α-CdSe, α-CdS, α-CdO, α-ZnTe, α-ZnSe, α-ZnS, β-CdTe, β-CdSe, β-CdS, β-CdO, β-ZnTe, β-ZnSe, β-ZnS, h-BN, etc. are all considered in the same category.13 X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations are especially useful to identify whether one kind of material is 2D or not from the typical diffraction peaks, crystal lattice and thickness, respectively.

The background colours in orange, blue and grey represent the corresponding 2D-QDs that have been experimentally or theoretically studied or not studied, respectively, so far. The rectangles in red, green and grey stand for the publication numbers of the studied 2D-QDs as over 10, between 1 and 10, and 0, respectively. 
2.1 Graphene, silicene, germanene, phosphorene and their derivatives-based QDs
Graphene is a single-carbon-atom-thick honeycomb-shaped 2D material.61 The zero-band electronic structure of graphene seriously hinders its optoelectronic and electronic applications, but when it is converted into GQDs, discrete band gaps and typical semiconducting properties and excellent photoluminescence (PL) characteristics can be endowed, while also maintaining its pristine low toxicity and high chemical stability.62 It was identified that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were the building blocks of GQDs (Fig. 3A).63,64 QDs based on the derivatives of graphene, such as graphane and fluorographene, have also been theoretically studied based on first-principles calculations.65–67 The results show that fluorographene and graphane possess similarly large band gaps, exhibiting a strong type-II alignment. Supposing the QDs are circular with radii of more than 4 to 5 Å, localized states could be obtained in their band gap.65 Many theoretical calculations have also been carried out to investigate the magnetism in GQDs resulting from the edge states and the hydroxyl groups. It was reported that fluorine-doping could enhance the paramagnetism in the fluorographene QDs, which could be used as a metal-free contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).67

Due to the beneficial properties and widespread applications of GQDs, researchers began to enquiry whether other elements could form new members of GQDs-like species. QDs derived from the same main group IV elements as carbon, i.e. Pb, Sn, Ge and Si, were the most easily to be considered, and as a result, silicene9,68,69 and germanene8 have begun to attract scientists’ attentions. Since silicene and germanene are monolayers of silicon or germanium atoms forming 2D honeycomb structures, their QDs forms should have similar a structure as GQDs.13,70 However, the related studies were limited in the theoretical stage, such as covering only the energy spectra and optical transitions in germanene QDs,8 plasmon excitation68 and band inversion9 in silicene ones. It should be noted that the study of QDs from their derivatives, such as fluorosilicene, fluorogermanene and chlorogermanene, is still a blank, until now.
Phosphorene, also called black phosphorus (BP), is the most stable phosphorous allotrope.71–73 It has a unique puckered honeycomb configuration as well as a layer-dependent band gap from 0.3 to 2.0 eV as its thickness decreases from the bulk form to the monolayer.71 As shown in Fig. 3B, in every layer of phosphorene, each P atom forms bonds with three other ones. In addition, three of them are in the same plane while the fourth is located at the parallel adjacent surface.72,74 BP-based QDs (BPQDs) are especially of great importance because of their dependence of the electronic structure and physical properties on the dot size, boundary edges and the external magnetic field.72–77 To study the effects of the unavoidable intrinsic structural defects and oxidation on the electronic and optical properties of BPQDs, time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) was performed, and showed that the BPQDs were defect-tolerant, and exhibited excellent photoabsorption when the coordination number of defective P atoms was 3, while oversaturated or unsaturated P atoms could lead to complete quenching of the optical absorption and the in-gap states.78 The magneto-optical and electronic properties of triangular, hexangular and rectangular monolayer BPQDs were theoretically studied by the use of the tight-binding method. Edge states were observed in the band gap of all the three types of BPQDs due to anisotropic electron hopping within the monolayer phosphorene.79 In addition, the edge states in the band gap of the BPQDs were well separated from the bulk states.75 While the charge density of any edge state was just localized at specific BPQD edges, different from that of GQDs.79 The experimental synthesis of highly stable BPQDs (ca. 2–4 layers) was also achieved by utilizing sonication-based strategies. The as-prepared BPQDs showed absorption spanning from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near infrared.71,72
2.2 2D layered carbides-based QDs
SiC is the most representative and widely studied of the carbides80,81 and has a graphene-like honeycomb structure.82 Bulk SiC is a biocompatible semiconductor with a wide band gap. Because of their good stability in an oxygen atmosphere, it was suggested around 2003 that SiC QDs could be a competitive alternative to Si nanoparticles (NPs) as biological labels.83 It was reported that SiC had more than 250 crystalline structures (polytypes).84 Generally, SiC in the 6H phase is considered to be a 2D layered material; however, SiC QDs produced from different polytypes (e.g. 3C, 4H and 6H) of bulk crystals by utilizing an electrochemical (EC) strategy exhibited an uncanny-resemblance in terms of the PL properties. This unexpected phenomenon could be ascribed to the polytypic transformation of the colloidal SiC QDs driven by ultrasonic waves.85 Guo et al. further demonstrated the possibility for (hexagonal, 6H)/(cubic, 3C) phase transformation at ambient temperature and pressure in nanoscale SiC QDs rather than in the usual mandatory extreme conditions.84 Both theoretical and experimental studies confirmed the dependence of the SiC properties on the surface functionalization and defects.83–86
2.3 2D layered nitrides-based QDs
In this classification, the most popular examples are carbon nitrides and h-BN-based QDs (BNQDs). The most stable allotropes of binary carbon nitride phases are the graphitic ones, such as g-C3N4, which comprises a layered structure with tri-s-triazine connected via tertiary amines (Fig. 3C).87 Although g-C3N4 QDs have the same elements as in N-doped GQDs (N-GQDs), they have different structures and physico-chemical properties. g-C3N4 QDs should be regarded as N-substituted GQDs, formed via the sp2-hybridization of nitrogen and carbon atoms in π-conjugated graphitic planes.7,87,88 As can be seen in the periodic table, nitrogen and boron are neighbours of carbon, and thus they should be able to be used as electron accepters and donors, respectively, to dope carbon materials. It was found that when the carbon atoms are completely substituted with BN-pairs, a layered h-BN structures with honeycomb-shaped network can be obtained (Fig. 3D).64 However, the features of the h-BN nanostructures are significantly different from their carbon counterparts, and so are their QDs forms.64,89 For example, its nanosheet is an insulator with a large band gap of 5.0–6.0 eV. Different from the GQDs, the BNQDs can only weakly interact with heteroatomic dopants,89 although C- and O-doping from the solvent should not be neglected.90 First-principles calculations revealed that the substitutive C atom energetically prefers to locate in the minority sublattice of the BNQDs, while at the same time causing little interference to their planner structures.89 In addition, zigzag-edge hydroxylation can lead to the considerable energetic stabilization of BNQDs as well as a reduction of their electronic gap compared to their hydrogenated counterparts.91
2.4 TMDCs-based QDs
TMDCs have a band gap ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 eV. Their compositions are usually described by the stoichiometry of MX2, where M is generally Ni, Mo, Nb, W, V or Re, and X is usually Te, Se or S, respectively (Fig. 3E).4,92,93 There are about 40 different categories of TMDCs, with MoS2 regarded as the most prominent representative.5,28,42,54,94–97 Unlike GQDs, semiconducting TMDCs have a band gap large enough to prepare QDs using the electric field. These QDs reduce the effects of the edge states, which are major factors in limiting the performance of graphene-based nanodevices.98 Besides the diverse experimental synthesis and applications of TMDCs QDs,5,31,32,94–96,99,100 theoretical studies have also been conducted. An effective Hamiltonian was derived to evaluate the magnetic field dependence of the bound states in the TMDCs QDs.4 In addition, a new category of a single-photon source based on the TMDCs QDs was demonstrated. The result showed that photons were emitted (or absorbed) in the QDs with different energies but an invariable valley-polarization. Meanwhile, the absorption spectrum pattern changed greatly with variation of the Fermi energy.101
2.5 TMOs-based QDs
TMOs, where M = Mo, Cr, Sc, W; X = O, are different from TMDCs because of their relatively lower band-edge state densities and smaller band gaps.54 Here, MoOx (x < 3)102 and WO3−x QDs103–106 are the most prominent examples. MoOx is semiconductive with a larger band gap than MoS2. Their properties vary for the different allotropes and suboxide phases, including α-MoO3, β-MoO3, h-MoO3, MoO2, and Mo4O11,107,108 and thus so do their QDs forms. The synthesis of MoOx QDs was achieved via the oxidation of MoS2 with the assistance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).102 WO3−x is also an n-type semiconductor.109 It can also be used as the electrode material for charge delivery/storage resulting from the valence transformation between W6+ and W5+.104 The reported WO3−x QDs usually exist in the forms of WO3103,105,110 and W18O49,111 produced from the precursors of WS2 or WCl6. The band gap energy ranging from 2.6 eV in the bulk form to 3.7 eV in the sub-nano size can be achieved via tuning the size of the WO3 QDs.110
2.6 MXenes-based QDs
MXenes collectively refer to the transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides that have been emerging recently in the 2D family. Their general formula is Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M stands for the early transition metals of Mo, Ti, Sc, Zr, V, Hf, Ta, Nb, Cr, etc., while X represents the carbon and/or nitrogen element, and Tx is the surface terminations, such as hydroxyl, oxygen or fluorine.112,113 These unique structures make MXenes possess good metallic conductivity and hydrophilicity.114,115 Some representatives include Ti2CTx,116 Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 3F)117 and Nb4C3Tx.118 The first example of their QDs form (Ti3C2) was reported recently, whose size could be tuned by the reaction temperature.115 This research should open up the door for further versatile theoretical and experimental studies of MXene QDs in the near future.
2.7 Others
Besides the popularly studied 2D-QDs mentioned above, others, such as multicomponent alloys (e.g. Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4),119,120 and lamellar metal hydroxides,21 have also been studied. LDH, one kind of typical lamellar metal hydroxide accommodating anions in its interlayers, is suggested to be a promising green catalyst alternative. Tokudome et al. demonstrated the synthesis of LDH nanoclusters in benign aqueous reaction media, and studied their unique catalytic performances.21 Compared with the bulk 2D materials, 2D-QDs are much less studied than expected. For example, TMHs include a wide variety of composites with the general stoichiometry of MnYm, where M represents a transition metal while X stands for a halogen element. To date, only a few 3D layered TMHs materials, such as molybdenum and vanadium halides, have been experimentally observed.13 However, cutting the bulk TMHs into the monolayer as well as 2D-QDs forms is still a challenging endeavour to be achieved.
3. Synthetic routes
Synthesis methods for GQDs have been extensively developed in the recent decade.48,50 Due to the similar layered structure and binding force between layers (generally van der Waals forces) of other 2D bulk materials, such as graphite, the exfoliation strategies for GQDs were extended to the preparation of other 2D-QDs.96 Generally, the strategies can be divided into two groups: top-down and bottom-up methods.16,24
3.1 Top-down methods
In the top-down methods, 2D-QDs are usually synthesized via the cleavage of relatively large bulk precursors, such as graphite,121,122 carbon black,123 coal,124 3D graphene,125 GO,44,62,126–129 carbon nanotubes,130,131 C60,132 WS2 crystals,133 MoS2 powder,31 bulk g-C3N487,134 and h-BN flakes,135 into tiny ones, e.g. by chemical etching,7,84,130 EC exfoliation,35,85,96,131 Li/K intercalation,95,136,137 liquid exfoliation,138 hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment,87,126,134 microwave irradiation,139 ball milling,140 ultrasonication,27,31,141,142 the thermal plasma jet method143 and femto-second laser ablation.144 For most top-down methods, oxygen-containing functional groups were first created on 2D nanosheets, upon which defects could be created. The defects could serve as chemically reactive sites, allowing a layered structure to be cut into smaller ones, and then finally into QDs (Fig. 4A).139 The top-down methods have the superiorities of a simple operation, the use of abundant raw materials and large-scale production.145 But they are also limited in some shortcomings including a low production yield and the requirement for special treatments.1,146

Ultrasonication is one general, green and harmless method for the generation of 2D-QDs, via which most layered materials can be converted into QDs due to the acoustic cavitation and shockwave in a “good solvent”. Meanwhile, the intrinsic properties of the 2D bulk crystals can be well maintained.71,72,146,147 The “good solvent” is usually ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and is defined as a solvent with sufficient surface energy to get over the binding force, usually van der Waals force, between the layers of the bulk 2D materials as well as to make the 2D-QDs be well dispersed.148 Accordingly, BPQDs and MoS2 QDs have been prepared via the bath sonication and the probe ones in NMP.71,72,147 However, due to the use of organic solvents, especially NMP with a high boiling point of 203 °C, further applications of the 2D-QDs in aqueous suspension need complicated post-treatment, such as rotary evaporation and phase transfer. Even more, the rotary evaporation needs an ultrahigh temperature, which can influence the optical properties of the final 2D-QDs products. Thus, the development of simple and direct preparation methods for 2D-QDs in an aqueous environment is needed.31 For example, high-quality and high-purity GQDs were fabricated via the sonication of as-grown defective graphene by chemical vapour deposition directly in an aqueous medium.146 Wang's group prepared MoSe2 QDs via the ultrasonication of bulk MoSe2 powder in an aqueous solution of a non-ionic copolymer surfactant.31
However, the ultrasonication method has some drawbacks, including the need for a long sonication time and its low production yield and quantum yield (QY).148,149 Therefore, usually grinding142 and hydrothermal/solvothermal treatments1,2,28,148–150 are further applied to enhance the efficiency of the 2D-QDs preparation. As shown in Fig. 4B, a one-pot facile strategy was developed for the synthesis of uniform MoS2/WS2 QDs via the sonication and further solvothermal treatment of bulk MoS2 or WS2.148 Meanwhile, the synthetic parameters for the solvothermal treatment, including the reaction temperature and time as well as the filling factor of an autoclave, have great effects on the quality of the 2D-QDs.1,2 By optimizing these conditions, strongly blue-emitting BNQDs with a QY as high as 19.5% could be generated.1 Moreover, solvents with strong polarity, such as DMF or NMP, could usually result in much higher quantum yields (QYs) of the 2D-QDs.2,90,148 In addition, the exfoliation efficiency of the 2D-QDs could be greatly improved with the further assistance of a surfactant, e.g. hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).149 However, great efforts should be devoted to providing a convincing explanation of these phenomena.90
Despite the advantages mentioned above, sonication-hydrothermal/solvothermal treatments are usually time-consuming or have low repeatability.7,84,130,151 While EC methods have the advantages of a simple operation, eco-friendliness, low cost and good reproducibility.85,131,152,153 For example, GQDs could be prepared via EC means in 100 mM phosphate buffer solution using graphene film as the working electrode. The as-prepared GQDs suspension could be stably stored more than three months at room temperature without any aggregation or colour change.152 SiC QDs could also be fabricated from the bulk SiC crystals via the EC etching method in a HF/C2H5OH mixture solution for 40 min.85 Among the used electrolytes, ionic liquids, possessing a high ionic conductivity and wide EC potential window, tend to be regarded as much more efficient ones for generating 2D-QDs in high yield.96,125,154 Thus, high-quality GQDs125 or MoS2 QDs96,155 could be directly cut from defect-free 3D graphene or bulk MoS2 using ionic liquid-containing non-aqueous or aqueous solutions as the electrolytes, respectively. The obtained 2D-QDs had a narrow size distribution with a lateral diameter of about 3 nm and fewer than 2 layers.96,125
The potentiostatic techniques, while providing accurate control of selective oxidation followed by reduction, make the EC means act not only as a scissor to cut off the 2D bulk materials-based electrode into 2D-QDs but also allows precisely monitoring their size and shape, or can even allow pinpointing their highest QY point.156 More importantly, the EC methods also offer the opportunity for the large-scale synthesis of 2D-QDs in a short time.96,131 All these superiorities make the EC means great promising synthetic techniques for diverse 2D-QDs generation. In addition, it should be noticed that conductivity is a prerequisite for the electrode. Thus, the insulator materials, such as BN, should not be suitable for QDs generation via EC means. While for traditional EC means, the 2D precursors have to be in large bulk form, although this should not be absolutely impossible since genius design can always be conducted to overcome the problem. For example, an EC exfoliation and downsizing method with bipolar electrodes was introduced for BP NPs fabrication using BP macroparticles (BP MPs) as the precursors via applying a constant DC potential of 10 V between two platinum electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4C, the exerted DC potentials induced opposite potentials on the opposite ends of the BP MPs, thereby resulting in their exfoliation into NPs.157 Although 2D-QDs prepared via this bipolar EC method have not been reported so far, this provides a good reference for the following investigation of using non-large bulk 2D materials as precursors for the production of 2D-QDs.
The 2D-QDs synthesized by the above-mentioned means are generally multilayer rather than monolayer. Alkali metal (e.g. Li or K) intercalation is suggested to be the most possible strategy for the large-scale preparation of monolayer 2D-QDs.135,137 Hence, these methods, in particular, have attract great interest for fabricating QDs based on TMDCs recently.95,136,137 As schemed in Fig. 4D, the alkali metal could inhomogeneously intercalate into the layers of 2D native materials, leading to an expansion of the layer distance and certain defects (e.g. S/Mo vacancy for MoS2 or boundaries between the 2H and 1T phases) in the 2D layered nanosheets. These defects make the nanosheets fragile and open to being easily attacked, like in most top-town routes for the preparation of 2D-QDs.137,154 Accordingly, monolayered BNQDs with a lateral size of around 10 nm135 and WS2 QDs ranging from 8 to 15 nm136 were obtained from their multilayered bulk flakes. This latter result confirmed this method as a high-yield method since over 36 wt% native bulk WS2 could be converted to small QDs.136 However, it should be noted that the exfoliation process during the alkali metal intercalation was aggressive, since the formed LixMoS2/LixWS2 compounds were extremely air or water sensitive.135 Alternatively, sulfuric acid was discovered to be an intercalation agent to exfoliate the MoS2 layered materials into single-layer QDs with the assistance of ultrasonication under ambient and aqueous conditions.141
3.2 Bottom-up methods
Nearly all the mentioned top-down techniques can be used for the generation of 2D-QDs. The prominent difference between them is the different precursors, since the bottom-up methods usually need small organic or inorganic molecules as precursors. The bottom-up methods have the advantages of allowing precise manipulation of the size distribution and morphology or surface functionalization of the 2D-QDs.45,158 Generally, 2D-QDs are usually generated based on aggregation or growing-up mechanism.145 Recently, another reasonable mechanism was proposed as follows: the small organic or inorganic molecules are first crystallized or polymerized into quasi-bulk precursors, followed by a top-down-like cutting to yield the as-expected 2D-QDs.104 All these mechanisms should be further elucidated via further experimental data, characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. For example, Liu et al. synthesized hydroxyl and amino-functionalized BNQDs via a facile bottom-up hydrothermal approach using boric acid and ammonia solution as the precursors. DFT results revealed the distance between the N and B atoms was decreased from 3.113 Å in the precursors to 1.434 Å in the final BNQDs, confirming the feasibility of this strategy.159
Citric acid,38,158,160–164 pyrene,45,165 glucose166,167 and their mixture or derivatives are the most commonly used precursors for the preparation of GQDs either via pyrolysis or hydrothermal treatment or microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.158,166 Also, g-C3N4 QDs could be synthesized via CVD168,169 or calcination41,88 using dicyandiamide41,169 and melamine88,168 as precursors, or through hydrothermal treatment or the microwave treatment of urea and sodium citrate.6,170,171 Bottom-up hydrothermal/solvothermal methods are especially attractive for the synthesis of MoS2 QDs.33,34,42,172,173 In these synthetic strategies, sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4·2H2O) is usually used to provide the molybdenum source,33,42,172,173 while the sulfur sources could be varied as thiocarbamide,42 dibenzyl disulfides,172 cysteine33,173 or glutathione,173etc. In addition, (NH4)2MoS4 itself could provide both the molybdenum and sulfur sources simultaneously.34
2D ZnO QDs have been mostly synthesized via the sintering174 or hydrolysis56 or microwave treatment58 of Zn-salt precursors, e.g. zinc acetate. Here, the sol–gel approach is suggested to be the most successful approach to prepare ZnO QDs.59,175 Other metal oxide QDs, such as RuO2,46 MoOx102,176 and WO3−x,103–105,110 could also be prepared via bottom-up strategies. WO3−x QDs are usually prepared using tungsten chloride (WCl6)103–105,111 or peroxotungstic acid [WO2(O2)H2O] as a precursor in the presence of templates such as oleic acid,105 octylamine,104 ethylene glycol103 porous silicas,110via a microwave-assisted self-assembly103 or thermal heating.104 Generally, the synthetic procedures are composed of first a bottom-up method, such as polymerization of a tungsten–ethylene glycol complex103 or formation of bulk tungsten aryloxide (W(OC6H5)6),104 and then a dissolution process.103,104 Although the sizes of the WO3−x QDs are controllable by choosing a template with appropriate pore size, incomplete removal of the template from the WO3−x QDs could hinder their further applications. Thus, a template-free method for high-purity and high-quality WO3−x QDs is very necessary.111
The above-mentioned synthetic methods provide a good basis for the preparation of 2D-QDs, but simple and efficient procedures, low-toxicity precursors, mild reaction conditions, good crystallinity and monodispersity, high QY and the option for large-scale production are still needed for a method to be considered an ideal preparation method.62 The preparation of 2D-QDs based on BN, phosphorene and WS2 has not yet been fully explored. One possible reason for this could be due to the unavailability of appropriate precursors. For example, the reported hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment of tungsten-containing precursors could only result in WO3−x QDs,103–105 while it is difficult to apply for the production of WS2 QDs, even in the presence of plentiful sulfur sources.111 Therefore, not only precursors with prerequisite element sources but also appropriate conditions, such as reaction temperature, time, as well as oxygen removal from the reaction suspension, should be studied for the bottom-up generation of various 2D-QDs.
4. Characterization techniques
All the superiorities of the 2D-QDs result from their size, heteroatom dopants, functional groups, defects, edge configurations, etc.,24,64,78,177,178 which could be confirmed through various characterization techniques.111,125,147 To verify the formation of 2D-QDs and to further optimize the reaction conditions, AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are usually used and give the height profile and lateral-size information of the 2D-QDs, respectively. Although the size of the 2D-QDs is defined as less than 100 nm,13,179,180 the reported ones are usually smaller than 10 nm.35,72,103,104,110,123,146,158,181 The BNQDs, BPQDs, WS2 QDs or MoOx QDs prepared by liquid exfoliation or/and solvothermal treatments under different reaction conditions have an average size of ∼3.3 nm, 4.9 ± 1.6 nm, 2.7 ± 0.8 nm or 4.4 nm,1,2,71,72,133,176 respectively. Fig. 5A, B and E show the representative TEM images and corresponding size distribution of BPQDs. The AFM results indicate that the thickness of most reported 2D-QDs is less than 3 nm,28,71,72,102,123,124,135,141,148,176 suggesting that these 2D-QDs are highly exfoliated. Since most of the single-layer thickness of 2D materials is between 0.5 and 0.7 nm,73 the topographic heights of the 2D-QDs in the range of 0.85–2.17 or 0.9–2.1 nm correspond to 1–3 layers of BN,1 1.9 ± 0.9 nm to 4 ± 2 layers of BP (example given in Fig. 5F–I)72 and 0.7 nm to monolayer WS2,133 respectively.

Besides, the highly ordered and paralleled lattices in the HRTEM image suggest that the 2D-QDs have good crystallinity. The lattice fringes of the 2D-QDs, such as 0.215 nm,2 0.34 nm and 0.52 nm,71,72 0.21 nm133 and 0.27 nm27 correspond to the (100) plane of the h-BN, the (021) and (020) faces of BP (Fig. 5C and D), the (104) plane of WS2 and the (100) lattice plane of MoS227 crystals, respectively. The crystallinity of the 2D-QDs could also be further studied by XRD.2,41,121,182,183 For example, the main peaks at ∼26° (ref. 2), 26.7° (ref. 121) and 14.5° (ref. 27 and 173) in the XRD patterns are ascribed to the (002) face of raw h-BN,2 the (002) interlayer spacing of graphite121 and the (002) plane of MoS2,27,42 respectively. After the solvothermal treatment, the peaks are usually broadened, decreased2,121 or sometimes even disappear,27,42 resulting from the lack of interlayer action and the reduced crystallinity of the layered bulk materials upon the exfoliation process.27,42 In addition, the remaining typical peaks in the XRD pattern41,121,137,182,183 also provide one way to confirm the formation of 2D-QDs. For example, although the characteristic (002) diffraction peak disappears for MoS2 QDs, the two weak XRD peaks at 2θ = 32.6° and 58.4° can be attributed to the (100) and (110) diffractions, respectively – still evidencing the successful exfoliation of the QDs (Fig. 5J).34
Raman spectroscopy can be used to further characterize the crystal structure and thickness of 2D-QDs.2,27,73 The Raman spectrum of the GQDs could also provide information on the defect density based on the intensity ratio of D to G peaks at 1589 and 1331 cm−1, respectively. Interestingly, the Raman intensity of GQDs was ∼5-fold higher than that of graphite or few-layered graphene, which could be attributed to the additional fluorescence activity of the GQDs.16 Compared with bulk h-BN, the BNQDs exhibited a much weaker E2g phonon mode around 1366–1370 cm−1. The great decrease in this mode was indicative of the few-layer structure of BNQDs.2 Similarly, bulk MoS2 showed two strong Raman peaks at 407.1 and 380.5 cm−1, ascribed to vertical plane (A1g) and in-plane (E12g) vibrations of Mo–S bonds in 2H MoS2, respectively. While the corresponding bands of MoS2 QDs were shifted to 406.2 and 380.8 cm−1, respectively, indicating the A1g softening and E112g stiffening with decreasing the layer thickness, confirming the successful synthesis of the MoS2 QDs with a thickness of 1–2 layers (Fig. 5K).27 As reported, red-shifts in the Raman spectra were also observed for BNQDs135 and BPQDs compared to their respective bulk starting materials.73
To study the surface composition and chemical states of the 2D-QDs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are usually utilized.87,94,169,184,185 XPS provides a direct way to monitor the composition and dopant of 2D-QDs, via which the atomic ratio can also be figured out. For example, the XPS spectrum of as-prepared MoS2 QDs indicated the atomic ratio of Mo:S was 1:2.09, confirming the successful preparation of the MoS2 QDs.34 In addition, the functional groups on the surface of 2D-QDs can also be identified based on the deconvolution of the narrow scan spectra of each constituent element94,169,184 by fitting the corresponding peak using the multi-peak Gaussian method.1 Generally, the binding energy peaks at 284.5, 401.0, 532 eV, 225.9 eV and 190.1 eV correspond to C1s, N1s, O1s, S2s and B1s, respectively.1,134,135,172,185 As shown in Fig. 5L, the peaks at 229.6, 232.8 eV and 235.9 eV in the narrow scan spectrum of Mo could be attributed to Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo6+, respectively.34,150 In addition, XPS is one technique to discriminate the WS2 QDs of the 1T-phase from the 2H-one based on the deconvolution of the W4f7/2 and W4f5/2 peaks.133 Generally the C1s spectrum of GQDs or other carbon-containing 2D-QDs can be deconvoluted into several peaks. The peak at 284.83 eV corresponds to sp2 CC bonds and the peaks at 288.6, 286.8, and 284.6 eV are ascribed to carboxyl (COOH) (CO), ether (C–O) and neutral (C–C) carbons, respectively,184 which are indicative of the attachment of a solvent and oxygen-containing functional groups on the 2D-QDs surface. One confusion for the freshman is that the C1s can usually be detected in all the 2D-QDs despite the carbon element not being part of the composition. This could originate from the used organic solvent or may be inevitably imparted into the detected sample from the external ambient environment during the detection process.
FTIR usually gives information about the functional groups on the 2D-QDs surface.169 For example, the FTIR spectrum of GQDs exhibits absorption peaks at 1387, 1627 and 1727 cm−1, which can be assigned to the O–H deformation of C–OH, the stretching vibration of the graphitic domains and CO vibration in the carboxyl group, respectively.185 For the BNQDs, the peaks at ∼1390 and 809 cm−1 correspond to the B–N vibrations of the bulk BN. while the peaks of the N–B–O vibrations at around 1270–1000 cm−1 indicate the O atom doped into the BNQDs in the solvothermal process.2 One high-profile point that should be noted is that the functional groups on the 2D-QDs, such as the oxygen-containing ones, are of importance for their dispersibility in an aqueous medium as well as for the optical properties, further modification and applicability,139 which are discussed in detail in the following sections.
5. Properties
5.1 Optical property
2D-QDs are highly intriguing due to their varied, tunable and broadband emissions from the deep UV to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.186 These properties depend on the synergetic effects of the sizes (i.e. quantum confinement), surface chemistry and edge defects, resulting from the different reaction conditions, such as the solvents, filling factors, synthesis temperature, duration time and functional modifiers as well as ambient pH changes.30,187
Generally, the optical properties of 2D-QDs can be roughly identified by UV light irradiation with a UV lamp at 254 nm or 365 nm. Here, 365 nm is the most frequently used wavelength. Generally, 2D-QDs suspensions are transparent and colourless146,158,188–190 or light yellow2,27,38,62,72,135,136,148,176,191 or even brown under daylight,192 while they emit bright blue1,2,27,28,38,103,135–137,141,146,148,158,161,176,188,189,191,193 or green30,126,129,165,194,195 or sometimes red153,196,197 or white185 or even multicolours58,59,124,175,192,197,198 under UV irradiation (Fig. 6A).

The size and surface status are critical factors in determining the PL of the 2D-QDs.199 The green luminescence of GQDs likely originates from the defect states with oxygen-containing groups, such as –OH, O and –COOH,59 whereas the blue luminescence is controlled by the inherent states in the highly crystalline framework.17 Zhang et al. separated out crude GQDs to obtain different-sized GQDs with narrow size distributions centred at 5.5, 12.5 and 16 nm in diameter through gel electrophoresis, respectively. When GQDs are relatively small in size (e.g. 5.5 nm in their work), their surface status played major roles in their PL properties, while for the relatively larger GQDs (e.g. 12.5 and 16 nm), the larger carbon skeleton is the main contribution to their PL features.200
The PL of 2D-QDs could be tuned by the types of solvents or pH,164,199 which can result in different quantum size effects and surface states. For example, the sizes of ZnO QDs synthesized in methanol, ethanol and hexanol ranged from 3.3 to 7.7 nm, and exhibited strong green, yellow and orange florescence, respectively.175 Our recent work also discovered that when different solvents, such as ethanol, DMF or NMP, were used, the size of the as-prepared BNQDs changed from 4 to 2 nm, and the colour of the BNQDs suspension changed from blue to green, accordingly.90 For GQDs produced from electrolysis of a graphite rod, the dispersion exhibited a distinct colour variance from light yellow to brown and then to red with the pH changing from 1 to 14 due to the deprotonation of oxygen-containing functional groups as well as the corresponding electrostatic charging and doping.192
The PL colour could also be adjusted by the capping agents or the doping elements. Upon modification with 2-ethylenediamine, the GQDs changed from orange to yellow in daylight, while the PL colour was transformed from blue to green under UV light.30 For MoS2 QDs synthesized using OLA as both a reducing and stabilizing agent, the resultant MoS2 QDs showed tunable PL from blue to red through regulating the OLA amount and reaction time.94 While for the doping effects, it was suggested that heteroatom dopants, such as sulfur or nitrogen, could lead to a blue-shift, while boron- or fluoride-doping may result in a red-shift.182 Accordingly, S,N-co-doped GQDs (S,N-GQDs) with three-colour emission, namely blue, red and green, were prepared. As shown in Fig. 6B, the three states of S, N and O correspond to the π* orbital of the CS, CN and CO bonds in the as-prepared S,N-GQDs, respectively. When the excitation energy was about 3.35 eV, the luminophore containing CO bonds were blue emitting. The N or S dopants could lead to a red-shift of the emission and absorption band. Accordingly, green or red light emission was obtained under excitation light energy of 2.75 or 2.58 eV, respectively.164
The optical features of the 2D-QDs can be further studied by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.129,143,201 Generally, the UV-vis absorption of the GQDs between 200 and 269 nm (e.g. 228 nm and 262 nm185) should be ascribed to the π–π* transition of sp2 CC, while the peaks in the range of 270–390 nm (e.g. 306, 320, 333 and 340 nm) correspond to the n–π* electronic transition from the oxygen-containing functional groups (CO).129,143,185,201 Meanwhile, the N-GQDs can lead to a 56 nm blue-shift compared with that of the N-free GQDs due to the strong electronic affinity from the N-dopants.195 The UV-vis spectra of g-C3N4 QDs at ∼250 nm are due to the π–π* electronic transitions for s-triazine rings-bearing carbon nitrides.183 Upon being successfully exfoliated to QDs from bulk raw materials, the UV spectra of BNQDs exhibit absorption peaks below 190 nm, much lower than that of the multilayered h-BN nanosheets (peak at 230.5 nm).2,135 While the UV-vis absorption of MoS2 QDs represents the excitonic feature peaks in the near-UV region of λ < 300 nm (e.g. 207, 230 nm172 and 268 nm27).137,141,147,148 The UV-vis absorption of MoSe2 QDs at λ = 795 nm and 696 nm indicates that the MoSe2 QDs have preserved the native 2H-phase structure of the bulk form.31,142
The PL spectra of the 2D-QDs are generally surveyed under different excitation wavelengths, showing the excitation-dependent fluorescence emission features in most cases.1,7,34,170,177,185,195 For example in Fig. 6C, when the as-synthesized BNQDs were placed under excitation at wavelengths increasing from 290 to 400 nm, their PL peaks shifted to longer wavelengths accordingly.1 The emission signal increases first and then declines, with an utmost fluorescence at 395.5 nm upon 334 nm excitation.1,34,195 The excitation-dependent fluorescence was suggested to be due to the significant red-edge effect.195 In addition, the excitation-independent PL features can also be observed for some 2D-QDs.141,179 As depicted in Fig. 6D, the maximum emission wavelength is fixed at 445 nm via varying the excitation wavelengths from 230–380 nm.179 This is usually ascribed to their uniform size distribution and the surface state of the 2D-QDs. However, adequate evidence supporting their conclusion is still needed.170,175,177,197,200 In addition, some 2D-QDs also show ambient conditions (such as pH, metal ions)-sensitive PL excitation and emission properties, which are regarded as merits for 2D-QDs to be used as smart materials for bio- and chemosensing.125,202 Meanwhile, the environment insensitivity can also be an advantage, since the fluorescent stability of the 2D-QDs makes them suitable for practical application in complex matrices.141
Apart from the commonly studied strong downconversion PL feature, some 2D-QDs were also found to possess obvious upconversion PL (UCPL) properties,203–205 of which the emission photoenergy (short-wavelength light) is stronger than the excitation one (long-wavelength light).203 Accordingly, the 2D-QDs could convert NIR light to visible light.7 For example, a strong blue emission (around 450 nm) could be observed for one kind of GQDs under 800 nm excitation.204 There are two types of possible UCPL mechanisms: the anti-Stokes PL process and the multiphoton active process. Since the energy difference between the excitation and emission light is not unchanged, the UCPL properties of 2D-QDs are suggested to be attributable to the multiphoton active processes.7 However, in the study of 2D-QDs UCPL, it has been seen there is a possibility of getting a spurious UCPL phenomenon since some so-called UCPL can be obtained from the second order grating diffraction from a xenon lamp at λ/2, thus the normal downconversion PL might be mistakenly regarded as the UCPL.204,206,207 These misinterpretations can be avoided through experimental checks by plugging a long pass filter on the excitation pathway to remove the incorrect excitation. In addition, UCPL from 2D-QDs should be identified under excitation of a pulsed laser (Fig. 6E). Other ways to access the upconversion, such as through ordinary sunlight, are not easy to achieve yet for 2D-QDs.204
QYs and PL lifetimes are two important parameters for reflecting the advantageous features of florescent 2D-QDs. Absolute QYs can be measured using special equipment or relative QYs can be determined via the equation below:  where ST and X refer to the standard fluorescent dye and the studied 2D-QDs, respectively, Φ represents the QYs, Grad indicates the plot gradient of the integrated PL intensity vs. absorbance and η is the refraction index of the solvent for dispersing the fluorescent dyes or 2D-QDs.208 Generally, the QYs of 2D-QDs, which depend on their size, defects, surface chemistry, etc., are generally determined by the preparation methods and reaction conditions.209 Taking BNQDs as examples, Allwood et al. successfully fabricated monolayer BNQDs via three steps, namely potassium-intercalation, de-intercalation and disintegration of the BN edges, respectively, but their QY was only 2.5%.155 Recently, a sonication-solvothermal strategy was used to prepare BNQDs with a relatively high QY of 8.6%.2 Upon further optimization of the synthesis temperature, the reaction time and the filling factor in the solvothermal process, BNQDs with a higher QY of 19.5% have been realized.1 It was suggested that the solvent plays a crucial role in producing 2D-QDs, such as MoS2 QDs148 and BNQDs,90 with a high QY. Generally, DMF, DMSO and DMF are much better solvents for making 2D-QDs than ethanol and water.
To further enhance the QYs of 2D-QDs, surface modification and heteroatom doping have been suggested as being more efficient.48 Diverse functional molecules, like phenylalanine,162 ionic liquids,96 triphenyl phosphine210 and 1,2-ethylenediamine,30 could be used to passivate or functionalize 2D-QDs. After modification, the functional groups at the surface are changed, and the other defect traps are varied, which could significantly increase the QYs accordingly.211 Doped 2D-QDs could almost maintain all the superiorities of blank ones while additionally avoiding their self-quenching because of their substantial ensemble Stokes shift.182 The 2D-QDs could be either doped with a single heteroatom, such as B, N, O, S, F or Cl,48,209,212,213 or co-doped with two or more ones, such as B/N or N/P or N/S.182,213,214 Generally, the QY of GQDs with a clear graphitic structure is no more than 49%. While with in situ aromatic-nitrogen doping in the process of cutting the graphene oxide (GO) precursor, N-GQDs with an ultrahigh QY of 74% could be obtained without further surface passivation or modification.209 Until now, doping studies have mostly concentrated on carbon-based 2D-QDs, which have provided a valuable reference point but there remains a broad development space for other unexplored QDs, such as MoS2 QDs and BNQDs.
The reported PL lifetimes of most 2D-QDs are all in nanoseconds,24,135,141 which can be evaluated by time-resolved fluorescence microscopy.185 Taking GQDs prepared via chemically-oxidized carbon black as an example,215 the fast emission component, τ1, was attributed to the oxygen functional groups, thus contributing to the blue emission in the PL spectra, while τ2 likely resulted from the π*–π transition of the aromatic cores was responsible for the particle size distribution, and τ3 (10–14 ns), whose percentage was increased after reduction, was supposed to be related to the disordered structure, contributing to the red emission of PL.215 The PL lifetime of the 2D-QDs could also be influenced by the ambient conditions. For instance, the average fluorescence lifetime of MoS2 QDs rose from 2.75 ns to 3.06 ns and then to 3.43 ns with increasing the pH from 5.33 to 7.32 and then to 11.44.202
5.2 Catalytic property
The 2D-QDs possess a high surface area and plentiful active sites, making them ideal as photocatalytic,7,41,42,73,164,169,216 electrocatalytic,133,148,172,217–219 enzyme-like catalytic109,127,220–223 or other chemocatalytic21,224,225 materials. Both computational and experimental results have proven that the catalytic activities mainly originate from the edge sites rather than the basal planes.133,220 Thus, compared to the layered nanosheets, the 2D-QDs less than 10 nm present an increased edge to volume ratio and a higher specific surface area as well as more exposed edge atoms,148,217,218 leading to increased unsaturated bonds (e.g. the enrichment of S edges on MoS2 or WS2 QDs).133,172 The unsaturated state makes the atoms unstable and highly active, and thus easy to be combined with other atoms. As a result, high catalytic properties of the 2D-QDs could be obtained.148,169,217
In addition, chemical doping of the 2D-QDs brings them more active sites for advanced catalysis.48,197,216,226,227 Attributed to having a similar atomic size and valence-electron structure as the carbon atom, the nitrogen atom can be easily introduced into the GQDs structure via C–N bonds to form N-GQDs.216 As can be seen in the schematic structure in Fig. 6F, N-GQDs prepared via NH3-treatment and the further oxidization of GO were composed of diverse sized graphene layers assembled in an AB order. The nitrogen resides in the main body of the GQDs, while the oxygen functionalities are scattered on the basal and peripheral planes.216 The N-GQDs could efficiently catalyze the coordination reaction between 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin and Cd2+.224 The successful doping of the GQDs may provide lessons and guidance for preparing other 2D-QDs catalysts. Besides, some 2D-QDs could also accept electrons and act as active sites for photocatalytic reactions.42,73 The broad absorption in the visible light region and the UCPL property make 2D-QDs, such as S,N-GQDs and MoS2 QDs, good photocatalysts for energy harvesting and energy transfer.7,41,164
2D-QDs, such as GQDs, also show a peroxidase-like catalytic activity127,220–223 for catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2, generating HO˙. To investigate the substrate-binding and catalytic sites of GQDs as a peroxidase, Qu's group selectively deactivated the specific oxygenous functional groups on the surface of the GQDs, respectively. The ketonic carbonyl groups (–CO) were found to be the catalytically active sites, while the carboxylic groups (OC–O–) played the role as substrate-binding sites. The hydroxyl groups (–C–OH) could even impede the catalytic system. Apart from the oxygen-containing groups, the size and surface defects also influence the intrinsic enzyme-like activity of the GQDs. In addition, other kinds of 2D-QDs, such as WO3−x QDs109 with peroxidase-like activity or other enzyme-mimicking catalytic properties, should be still further explored. To date, the low catalytic efficiency of the 2D-QDs-based nanozyme is still a shortcoming that needs to be overcome.
5.3 ECL and CL properties
Besides their fascinating PL properties, ECL is another interesting optical feature for 2D-QDs. GQDs,35,139,228 g-C3N4 QDs,229 WO3−x QDs109 and BNQDs90 are considered to be promising ECL luminophores due to their advantages, including facile synthesis, chemical inertness, simple labelling and low toxicity.145 Most of the 2D-QDs ECL are usually involved in cathodic reactions using K2S2O8,109,228,230–232 or L-cysteine90 as coreactants (Fig. 7A). Typically, the 2D-QDs and coreactants are electrochemically generated to form radicals of the 2D-QDs (e.g. GQDs˙−, BNQD˙−) and the coreactants (e.g. SO4˙−, RSO˙, RSO2˙, RSO3˙), respectively. Subsequently, the electron-transfer annihilation between these two radicals occurs to form the excited-state 2D-QDs (2D-QD*), which produce an ECL emission signal when coming back to the ground state (Fig. 7B).90,231 Apart from the cathodic ECL mechanism, an anodic ECL behaviour of GQDs was also observed using K2S2O835 or H2O2233 or triethanolamine229 or 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol234 as coreactants. In addition, the buffer pH is a vital factor influencing the 2D-QDs ECL intensity (Fig. 7C). Usually a neutral or basic buffer pH solution is much more favourable for the ECL signal of the 2D-QDs.109,228,230–232 Under optimal conditions, the repeatability of the ECL emissions has been investigated to confirm the stability of the proposed 2D-QDs ECL system (Fig. 7D), as this is much more significant for the further following applications.

In addition, a strong CL emission was also observed when the as-synthesized g-C3N4 QDs6,235,236 or GQDs237 were added with a coreactant, such as NaClO,235,237 Ce(IV)–SO32–236 or K3Fe(CN)6.6 The mechanism for the g-C3N4 QDs–NaClO CL system is schematically shown in Fig. 7E. The radiative recombination of the oxidant-injected electrons and holes in the g-C3N4 QDs is responsible for the CL emission (reactions i and ii). Moreover, the reactive oxygenic species produced in the system can further deliver energy to g-C3N4 QDs and subsequently boost the CL emission (Fig. 7E).235 However, studies on the ECL or CL of 2D-QDs are fewer in number than those on the PL ones. To further reveal the 2D-QDs-based ECL or CL mechanisms and to enlarge the corresponding applications, much more effort is still needed on the exploration of new 2D-QDs-based ECL and CL emitters.
5.4 Chiral property
Chiral QDs derived from metals and semiconductors have attracted widespread interest in photocatalysis, specific antibacteria and cytotoxic drug delivery and for asymmetric synthesis and enantioseparation as well as for biomedical and analytical assays.238,239 The current chiral nanostructures are dominated by gold because of the spectral convenience of its plasmonic bands, chemical stability and exciting physics.240 However, chiral 2D-QDs have been barely explored due to their weaker polarization rotation. However, due to their higher chemical activity, they should exhibit distinctive chiroptical effects. Kotov's group synthesized chiral GQDs in dispersion a by covalent edge-modification with L- and D-cysteine, resulting in a twist in the nanoscale.240 Chiral GQDs could also be prepared by the modification of oxidized GQDs with enantiomerically (R) or (S)-2-phenyl-1-propanol. The transfer of chirality could occur from the chiral GQDs to small molecules, such as pyrene.121 Decoration using chiral molecules to endow the GQDs with chirality in the nanoscale is expected to be a general strategy to be used for the further development of other chiral 2D-QDs. Due to a number of advantages, such as being less toxic and the lower cost of the 2D-QDs, studies on chiral QDs are expected to continue for their promising applications in biology and medicine.121,240
6. Functionalization
As mentioned above, chemical modification and heteroatom doping can be utilized to tune the properties of 2D-QDs. Besides, various nanomaterials, such as graphene nanosheets,43,217 MoS2 nanosheets,147 inorganic–organic nanohybrids241 and mesoporous Bi2MoO6 frameworks,128 could be used as the signal carriers or amplification agents to improve the optical or catalytic performance of the 2D-QDs. For example, the MoS2 QDs or g-C3N4 QDs could be combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to offer a hybrid electrocatalyst with a large surface area and high-density edge states as well as acting as a highly conductive support.88,217 Furthermore, 2D-QDs could also act as enhancing reagents for other systems, such as for promoting the photocatalysis efficiency42,168 and ECL and CL signal intensities145,242 as well as the stability and dispersibility of graphene.243 For example, BPQDs can be used as an effective n-type dopant of MoS2 nanosheets to improve the source–drain current of backgated monolayer MoS2 transistors.244 All these synergistic effects between the 2D-QDs and other micro-/nanomaterials make the 2D-QDs useful for widespread application in various fields.
Besides the experimental evidence, theoretical calculations, such as first-principle computational methods,64,91,245,246 have also been performed to study the edge chemistry effects on the structural, electronic, optical and electric response as well as for finding ways to tune the properties of 2D-QDs. It was theoretically reported that the surface modification could result in a red- or blue-shift in the absorption spectrum and fluorescence enhancement of the GQDs.247 These studies are favourable for understanding the mechanism of the unique physico-chemical properties of the 2D-QDs, and will open up new ways for functionalizing 2D-QDs for more widespread application.
7. Applications
The efforts dedicated to the synthesis methods and the various outstanding properties make 2D-QDs suitable for promising applications in chemo-6,20,33,102,105,150,173,176,183/biosensing,34,149,170 imaging,2,26,28,35,94,134,141,182,248,249 cancer therapy,27,31,32 catalysis,7,41,88,96,147,168,172,217 energy storage devices,43,46,104,133,250 optoelectronics,39,87,119,120,174,251 as composite membranes,2 photochromism103 and electrochromism.104 As shown Fig. 1A, sensing, imaging and optoelectronics are the most popular applications for the 2D-QDs. Besides, herein, information on the recently emerging advance applications of 2D-QDs in catalysis and energy will also be updated.
7.1 Chemo-/biosensing
Due to their intrinsic fluorescent properties, 2D-QDs could be applied as powerful fluorescent probes for chemo-/biosensing on account of the PL change upon the addition of analytes such as metals,6,158,252 anion ions,176,183 explosives,33,102,253,254 drugs,37,38,149,170,173,255 enzymes34,36,167,256–258 and gas.20,105,150 The most widespread 2D-QDs-based sensing is derived from the “ON–OFF” fluorescent properties, which could be extended to more in-depth assay principles. Other properties, such as CL or ECL, could also provide more promising detection techniques for sensing.

7.1.1 Sensing based on an ON–OFF PL mechanism. 
Currently, the “ON–OFF” PL mechanism of 2D-QDs is widely utilized for analyte sensing. The quenching of most fluorescent probes results from the supramolecular interaction between the donors (e.g. metal ions) and acceptors (functional groups on the fluorescent probes).252 Since 2D-QDs are “pure surface” materials due to their special sp2 conjugation with a single or few atomic layer thickness, 2D-QDs are suggested to be efficient supramolecular recognition fluorescent probe for analyte detection.214,252,259–261
The detection of metal ions, especially Fe3+, has been the most frequently studied for sensing.90,111,125,158,214,259–262 Generally, the addition of Fe3+ results in strong PL quenching of the 2D-QDs, while there is no or a relatively less obvious fluorescence change upon the addition of other metal ions at the same concentration of Fe3+ (Fig. 8A and B). This indicates that the 2D-QDs could be used for specific and selective Fe3+ sensing.90,111,259 A wide linear range of 0–130 μM with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.07 μM and satisfying recoveries of 88.3–101.6% for real water sample analysis could be achieved (Fig. 8C).90,111,214,259 The most acceptable PL quenching mechanism was that due to the oxygenous groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl, on the surface and edge of the 2D-QDs, where the Fe3+ ion acts as a coordinating centre to bridge well-dispersed 2D-QDs individuals together via high-affinity interactions between Fe3+ and the oxygenous functional groups. Subsequently this affinity interaction results in aggregation-induced PL quenching of the 2D-QDs (Fig. 8D).90,125,259,261,263 Xu et al. further suggested that the coordinated Fe–GQDs complex was favourable for the charge transfer, and also inhibited the excitons recombination, thus leading to the corresponding PL quenching.262 The Fe3+-induced aggregation of 2D-QDs can be characterized by AFM, TEM or FTIR techniques.125,259 In addition, it was observed that the Fe3+ concentrations could be obviously decreased upon the addition of 2D-QDs. It was thus anticipated that the 2D-QDs could be used as an efficient reagent for Fe3+ removal in aqueous media, which should have great potential in the further treatment of wastewater containing excessive amounts of Fe3+.

2D-QDs could also serve as fluorescent chemosensors for the detection of Cu2+, Ag+ or Au3+via modifying the 2D-QDs with certain functional ligands.264–268 GQDs prepared by the hydrothermal treatment of reoxidized GO by choosing ammonia as the solvent could be used for selectively detecting Cu2+ due to certain possible mechanisms, such as ion binding, electron transfer or inner filter effects.264,265 Based on the UCPL of graphene oxide QDs (GOQDs), an optical biosensor for detecting Cu2+ with high sensitivity was also developed. The selectivity of the biosensor was enhanced with the assistance of the Cu2+-targeted aptamer. The fluorescence quenching for the UCPL of GOQDs was suggested to be dominated by the electron transfer between the GOQDs and Cu2+.203 Glutathione-functionalized GQDs could also be used as an internal standard to develop a dual-PL ratiometric fluorescent strategy for visual and sensitive Cu2+ detection, based on the fact that the presence of Cu2+ has little influence on the PL of the as-prepared GQDs but an obvious quenching effect on that of the CdTe QDs.266 Due to the strong specific affinity between Au3+ or Ag+ and the amine groups on the N-GQDs, Au3+ or Ag+ in N-GQDs aqueous media could also be selectively detected.269–272 The interference of Fe3+ could be efficiently avoided by using the masking reagent mercaptosuccinic acid.269 In addition, quenching of the as-synthesized N,S-GQDs PL in the presence of Au3+ was also ascribed to the formation of gold NPs (AuNPs). Such a sensing strategy could be extended to produce composite materials of 2D-QDs with AuNPs or with other noble metal nanomaterials for application in catalysis or imaging.269,273
The assays of toxic heavy metal ions, including Hg2+, Cr(VI), Pb2+ and Cd2+, are of great importance for human health.183,274–281 The PL of some 2D-QDs, such as GQDs prepared by chemical oxidation of graphene274 or by the carbonization of citric acid275,276 and g-C3N4 QDs from the microwave treatment of HCONH2,183 could be selectively quenched by Hg2+, leading to a label-free fluorescent Hg2+ sensor281 with a LOD of 0.1 μM274 or 1.0 nM.183 The highly efficient superquenching of 2D-QDs by Hg2+ is probably because of the generation of the non-fluorescent g-C3N4 QDs/Hg2+ complex.183 In addition, by using the dual-excitation fluorescence characteristic of the GQDs, simultaneous quantification of Fe3+ and Hg2+ could be achieved in ion mixture samples and in a practical water matrix.280 The detection of metal ions in complex samples, such as living cells or organisms, is especially significant in health risk assessment and environmental monitoring.277,278 Based on the fluorescence quenching of thymine-rich DNA-modified GQDs (DNA-GQDs) in the presence of Hg2+, the selective and sensitive determination of Hg2+ as low as 0.25 nM in HeLa cells could be achieved.277
The diverse range of 2D-QDs fluorescent probes has led to their excellent performance and extensive application prospects in metal ion detection. However, the most fundamental bottleneck is achieving an accurate PL quenching mechanism upon the addition of certain metal ions, and understanding how to manipulate their selectivity to different metal ions.252 In particular, the interaction affinity between 2D-QDs and alkali/alkaline earth metal ions is very week, so the design of appropriate 2D-QDs for the detection of these ions is more difficult than that for Fe3+ or Au3+.252,266 A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified N-GQDs were prepared via an alkylation reaction. The sensitivity and selectivity of the N-GQDs towards the alkali/alkaline earth metal ions was regulated through the polyether chain length on the N-GQDs. Thus selective and ultrasensitive fluorescent probes for Sr2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ and Li+ could be obtained, respectively.252 In regards to the mechanism study, the influences of the size and type of 2D-QDs and the kinds of oxygen-containing groups (–OH, CO, –COOH) on the metal-induced PL quenching should be investigated based on more experimental details and theoretical calculations.267
By choosing appropriate kinds of 2D-QDs, other analytes, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP)33,102,253,254 H2O2,282 dopamine (DA),38 tetracycline (TC)173 and ascorbic acid283 could also be analyzed based on the ON–OFF response of the 2D-QDs PL. Fluorescent methods based on 2D-QDs for their detection show advantages in terms of high sensitivity, good selectivity and easy operation. For example, TNT assays could be achieved since the PL intensity of MoS2 or MoOx QDs decreases gradually with the increasing TNT concentration due to the inner filter effect of the Meisenheimer complexes on 2D-QDs33,102 (Fig. 8E). Since the fluorescence of GQDs could be turned off by Cr3+ ions, which could be produced by the reduction of Cr2O72− in the presence of ascorbic acid, a simple and efficient fluorescence assay for detecting ascorbic acid was developed. Furthermore, as a phosphatase substrate, L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate could be hydrolyzed by acid phosphatase (ACP) to give ascorbic acid. The content of ACP thus could be determined by the Cr3+-modulated “turn-off” GQDs PL sensor with a LOD of 8.9 mU mL−1.283


7.1.2 Sensing based on ON–OFF–ON and ON–OFF–ON–OFF PL mechanism. 
The “ON–OFF” mechanism of 2D-QDs PL could be further extended to detect more interesting analytes.34,36,149,170,176,255,257,268,278 Since the fluorescence of a 2D-QDs/metal ion (e.g. Hg2+, Eu3+, Fe3+, Cu2+) system could be recovered by the addition of some molecules, such as iodide ions,183 biothiols,281 glutathione (GSH),170 lipoic acid149 and cysteine,268,276 the additional molecules could be subsequently detected via the “ON–OFF–ON” fluorescence response of the corresponding 2D-QDs. For example, the initial fluorescence from g-C3N4 QDs could be quenched by Hg2+ due to the electron-transfer mechanism, where upon the further addition of GSH, the PL of g-C3N4 QDs was transferred to the “on” state because of the higher binding affinity of Hg2+ with GSH than with the g-C3N4 QDs. As a result, the selective sensing for GSH (LOD: 37 nM) in complex food samples could be realized using the g-C3N4 QDs–Hg2+ system (Fig. 9A).170 Since the quenched fluorescence of WS2 QDs by Fe3+ could be restored upon the addition of lipoic acid (LA), resulting from the stronger interaction of Fe3+ to LA than to WS2 QDs (Fig. 9B), a “turn-on” sensor for LA was developed with a linear range between 1 and 10 μM with a LOD of 0.59 μM.149 Similarly, the PL of the MoOx QDs could be significantly turned off in the presence of Eu3+, where a further addition of phosphate could make the PL turn on, which was attributed to the fact that the binding affinity of Eu3+ ions to oxygen atoms from phosphate is much higher than that from the MoOx QDs surface. Under optimal conditions, the ON–OFF–ON mechanism of a MoOx QDs fluorescent sensor was utilized for phosphate determination in complicated lake water samples with an LOD of 56 nM (S/N−1 ≥ 3).176

(C) Schematic representation for the detection of Haase based on an hyaluronic acid (HA)-functionalized AuNPs/MoS2 QDs system via the photoinduced electron-transfer process.34 Reproduced with permission from ref. 34. Copyright 2016 American Chemical Society. 
Enzyme assays also benefit from the ON–OFF–ON PL of the 2D-QDs.34,36 In the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA)-functionalized AuNPs, the PL of MoS2 QDs could be quenched via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HA could be cleaved into proangiogenic fragments by hyaluronidase (HAase), leading to the aggregation of AuNPs. Then, the electron transfer was blocked and the PL of the MoS2 QDs could be recovered (Fig. 9C). Based on the ON–OFF–ON mechanism, the fluorescent sensing of HAase was established with a LOD of 0.7 U mL−1.34 Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as both a linker and fluorescence enhancer, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) could occur between the GQDs as the donor and the coumarin derivative as the acceptor. Meanwhile, the presence of trypsin could digest BSA to disassemble the FRET pair, leading to the regeneration of the emission peak of the GQDs as well as to an increase in the emission peak ratio between the donor and acceptor. Based on the FRET strategy, trypsin could be detected with a low LOD of 0.7 mg mL−1, which is much lower than the average trypsin concentration in pancreatitis patients’ urine, indicating the great application potential of the GQDs-based sensor in facile and low-cost clinical assays.256
Despite the abundance of 2D-QDs, not all the analytes can find a suitable fluorescent 2D-QDs probe for their selective sensing. A hybrid self-assembly of 2D-QDs with diverse biomolecules or polymers to fabricate synergistically functionalized nanostructures was suggested as an alternative to solve this bottleneck.255,284 The self-assembly of such nanostructures could be achieved through various weak interactions, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic effects and hydrogen bonds.255,284 The aggregation-induced PL quenching of GQDs is usually deduced upon ionic self-assembly, while the further addition of analytes could cause the release of the GQDs from the hybrids based on mechanisms such as a pH-responsive structural change, competitive binding and enzymatic digestion of protein; accordingly, the PL intensity of GQDs could be restored. Based on this ON–OFF–ON principle, multifunctional platforms could be designed for sensing heparin or chondroitin sulfate,255 glycosami-noglycans, pH and proteases,284etc. The integrative self-assembly of GQDs with a variety of functional molecules could open up new avenues for designing multifunctional 2D-QDs-based hybrid materials for more versatile applications.284
Besides, the detection principle could be extended to ON–OFF–ON–OFF ones. For example, the PL quenching of GQDs could be caused by Cu2+ addition, where the further addition of pyrophosphate (PPi) could efficiently recover the quenched fluorescence due to the strong affinity between PPi and Cu2+, while the presence of PPase could decompose the complex of PPi–Cu2+–PPi via catalytic hydrolysis effect, resulting in the re-quenched fluorescence. Based on this ON–OFF–ON–OFF principle, highly selective and sensitive PPase detection was achieved with an LOD of 1 mU mL−1 (S/N−1 ≥ 3). This strategy confirmed the great application potential of 2D-QDs in diagnosing PPase-related diseases.36 Similarly, the modulation of aggregation and disaggregation of the GQDs in the presence and absence of Cu2+, or (and) PPi, or (and) alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the sensitive detection of ALP could also be detected with an LOD of 0.017 nM.257 It should be noted that this ON–OFF–ON–OFF mechanism could be used not only in enzyme detection, but also in assays of other mediators, including Cu2+ and PPi. Based on this mechanism, the optical logic gate for analyzing a series of analytes could also be promisingly designed.


7.1.3 Sensing by other detection techniques. 
Besides the fluorescent detection methods, 2D-QDs-based colorimetric,285 CL,6 EC286 and ECL229 ones could also be used for diverse chemo-/biosensing.
(i) Colorimetric sensing. 
Colorimetric sensing based on 2D-QDs has been attracting much attention in chemo-/bioassays due to its low cost, simplicity and visually observed colour change.287 For example, based on the fact that the presence of Fe2+, Co2+ and Cu2+ could render brown, orange and blue colourations of the GOQDs-functionalized poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hybrid hydrogel, a simple and cost-effective colorimetric strategy for discriminating and sensing the corresponding metal ions was realized.285 Using N-GQDs or GQDs as photocatalytic agents287 or a reducing agent and stabilizer,288 GQDs/AgNPs hybrids could be formed for enhancing the catalytic performance of H2O2 reduction. The conversion between AgNPs and Ag+ resulted in a sensitive colour fading of the reaction solution, providing a colorimetric basis for the ultrasensitive detection of H2O2 with an LOD of 33 nM (Fig. 10A).288 In addition, the visual variation from colourless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to the blue coloured oxidized TMB (oxTMB) in the presence of H2O2 provided another ground for colorimetric sensing.222,223,287 Since GSH can reduce oxTMB, the solution colour and the corresponding UV-vis absorption of oxTMB depend strongly on the GSH concentration. Accordingly, the detection of GSH with an LOD of 31 nM was achieved.287 Based on the peroxidase-like catalytic feature of the GQDs, a colorimetric sensing platform for H2O2 detection could also be constructed.222,223 This colorimetric sensing system could be further extended to the detection of glucose223 or cholesterol222 in combination with the specific catalytic effect of glucose oxidase223 or cholesterol oxidase222 or the 2D-QDs-based mimicking enzyme and the corresponding product of H2O2.288

Copyright 2015 American Chemical Society. 
(ii) CL sensing. 
CL is powerful in optical chemosensing due to its superiorities of high sensitivity, facile instrumentation, little background light interference and versatile applicability. 2D-QDs could be used as a CL luminophore for chemosensing based on their distinguished CL emission properties in strong oxidants.6,235,237,289 Since NaClO could oxidize GQDs or g-C3N4 QDs to give rise to CL emission, the selective and sensitive measurement of hypochlorite237 or free chlorine in water235 could be directly achieved in strong alkaline solutions. Based on the quenching effect of Hg(II) ion6 or uric acid289 on the g-C3N4 QDs–K3Fe(CN)66 or GQDs–Ce(IV)289 CL systems, simple and sensitive chemosensors were established for the detection of Hg2+ or uric acid in practical samples, respectively.
2D-QDs-based CL sensors could also be developed through resonance energy transfer (RET) processes.236,242,290 The GQDs,290 g-C3N4 QDs236 or GOQDs242 could be used either as energy acceptors236,290 or donors242 during the CL-RET. Due to the excellent degree of spectral overlap between GOQDs with a maximum emission at 454 nm and fluorescein with a maximal absorption at 491 nm, GOQDs could be applied as the energy donor to enhance the CL signal of the fluorescein-H2O2-bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)oxalate system, in which fluorescein was used as the acceptor. Since the CL-RET process could be further boosted by 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), the determination of 4-NP with recoveries between 93.4% and 107.9% in spiked tap water and river water could be achieved accordingly.242 Meanwhile, using GQDs as an energy acceptor could avoid the photobleaching that commonly happens with traditional fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the hydrophilicity and abundance of oxygen-containing groups make GQDs favourable for conjugation to the biomolecules.290 Accordingly, an immunoassay was constructed for the detection of CA-125, an ovarian cancer biomarker, based on the RET from the luminol/H2O2 CL system to GQDs, reaching an LOD of CA-125 at 0.05 U mL−1.290
Besides, the roles of 2D-QDs as a catalyst or enhancer in traditional CL systems were also studied.236,242,290,291 It was found that approx. 60-fold CL enhancement of the Ce(IV)/rhodamine B (RhB) system could be obtained in the presence of GQDs. One possible CL mechanism is that the GQDs are much more favourable for RhB oxidation, thus accelerating the production of the CL emitting species, resulting in higher CL intensity. The enhanced CL system was further developed for quantifying 2,4-dichlorophenol at 25 nM based on its inhibition effect on the CL system.291 A significantly increased CL of the Ce(IV)/sulfite system of about 60-fold could also be achieved in the presence of the g-C3N4 QDs. The g-C3N4 QDs-enhanced CL system was used for I− determination in urine samples with good recoveries.236 The possible mechanism has not been well explained, but all the three roles of g-C3N4 QDs, including as an emitting species, CL-RET and catalyst have been speculated.
(iii) EC sensing. 
EC methods possess many superiorities, including high selectivity, rapidness, portability, facileness and low cost. 2D-QDs could be used as an electrode modifier to establish an efficient EC sensing platform due to their high electrical conductivity, large surface area, good stability and high electrocatalytic activity.178,286,292–296 GQDs could be used to modify electrodes for the sensitive detection of Pb2+ with a remarkable LOD of 7 nM,279 and for rapidly determining Cr(VI) concentrations with an LOD of 0.097 mg L−1.286 N-GQDs modified on the electrode could be used as a catalyst towards TNT, showing a higher EC activity towards TNT reduction compared with most graphene-related catalysts. The proposed sensor could be used for the sensitive detection of TNT with an LOD of 0.2 ppb and good stability and repeatability (RSD of ∼0.5%) (Fig. 10B).178 Moreover, GQDs297 or GQDs-based nanocomposites167 could be used as a immobilization platform for antibodies,292 enzymes (e.g. HRP, laccase)167,297 or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).298,299 The ssDNA immobilization benefits from the π–π stacking between the π-conjugated structure of 2D-QDs and ssDNA.298 As a result, the proposed biosensor could sensitively detect miRNA-155 and caffeic acid with LODs of 0.14 fM297 and 0.32 μM,167 respectively.
Due to the strong interactions between GQDs and chitosan, a regular and uniform composite film could be formed on the electrode, which was then used for the EC chiral recognition of tryptophan (Trp) enantiomers. Here, chitosan in the composite film provided the chiral microenvironment, while the GQDs enhanced the EC signals, and increased the recognition efficiency.293 Trp isomers could also be recognized by GQDs/β-cyclodextrin nanocomposites-based EC means.300 In addition, GQDs were suggested as an outstanding capping and reducing reagent for the formation of diverse noble metal NPs/GQDs e.g. AuNPs/GQDs with high catalytic ability.37,301 The as-prepared AuNPs/GQDs were used as a novel sensing material, and showed high selectivity for the EC detection of H2O2 with an LOD of 0.12 μM and p-acetamidophenol with an LOD of 0.02 μM, respectively.37,296
(iv) ECL sensing. 
Due to their excellent ECL property, 2D-QDs, such as GQDs or g-C3N4 QDs, were used as the ECL reagents to construct ECL sensing platforms for the assays of pentachlorophenol (PCP),302 metal ions,139,180,229,231 microRNA35,303 and antigens.232,234,304 Due to the specific quenching effect of PCP on the ECL signal of the N-GQDs–GO system, a promising ECL sensor for PCP detection was developed, achieving an LOD of 0.03 pg mL−1.302 Similarly, heavy metal ions, such as Cd2+ (ref. 139) or Cr(VI)231 or Pb2+,180 could be detected based on the inhibited ECL intensity of GQDs/Cys139,180 or GQD/S2O82–231 systems (Fig. 10C).180 Most of the ECL assays are based on the cathodic mechanism of the 2D-QDs. While Dong et al. reported a newly anodic ECL based on one GQDs using H2O2 as a coreactant.230 In addition, the lower anodic ECL potential at +0.84 V for N-GQDs was suggested to be much more favourable for bioassays compared with the traditional ECL probes, such as tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) at 1.15 V. The specific recognition of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) for the N-GQDs labelled antibody could lead to an increase in the ECL intensity, which was used for an AFP immunoassay with an LOD of 1.2 pg mL−1.234
Based on nanomaterials, such as SiO2 nanospheres,233 AuNPs,229,303,305 porous PtPd nanochains306 and CdTe/CdS QDs307 or biorecognition elements, such as DNA and antibodies, 2D-QDs ECL-emitting species could be immobilized on the electrode to establish solid-state ECL sensors for highly selective and sensitive chemo-/biosensing.35,229,234,303,304,308 For example, by using SiO2 nanospheres as a probe immobilization and amplification support, efficient SiO2/GQDs ECL labels were designed to develop a highly selective ECL aptamer sensor for adenosine triphosphate.233 By refluxing the hydrazide-modified GQDs with AuCl4−, HM–GQDs–AuNPs nanohybrids were formed. Since the nanohybrids possessed both the unique ECL properties of HM–GQDs and easy functionalization of AuNPs, they could be facilely immobilized on the glassy carbon electrode to construct a solid-state ECL immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen detection with an LOD of 0.01 ng mL−1.305 Using Au/Ag-nanomaterials-functionalized rGO as an electrode material to immobilize the GQDs with ECL-emitting properties, the selective and sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) could be achieved based on the fact that increasing the adsorption of PSA and its antibody on the electrode could lead to a gradual falling-off of the ECL intensity of the as-prepared solid-state ECL sensor.304 With the assistance of the magnetic nanocomposite, quasi-solid-state GQDs ECL could also be obtained, while a homogeneous PL was simultaneously achieved. Integrating the virtues of dual analytical modality, dual-channel aptasensing for OTA detection was realized (Fig. 10D). This strategy balanced the rapidity, sensitivity and dynamic range of both detection techniques, making it greatly promising to other analyte assays.308
The 2D-QDs-based ECL-RET process, in which ECL-emitting 2D-QDs act as a donor while AuNPs309,310 or graphene228,295 act as acceptors, could be applied for the evaluation of protein kinase activity,228,309 DNA damage310 and as an immunoassay.295 Using single-stranded DNA (cp53 ssDNA) as a linker, GQDs and AuNPs could be integrated together to form an ECL-RET pair, leading to ECL signal quenching of the GQDs. Upon further hybridization with the target p53 DNA, the quenched ECL signal of the GQDs could be recovered due to the disassembly of the ECL-RET system. Accordingly, the target p53 DNA as well as DNA damage could be detected via the GQDs-based ECL-RET.310 The ECL-RET strategy could be extended to an ECL ratiometric strategy. Using AuNPs as a mediator, the ECL of GQDs was inhibited by contacting with AuNPs from the ECL-RET process, while luminol ECL was enhanced by the same AuNPs.258 The simultaneous decrease in the GQDs cathodic ECL and increase in the luminol anodic ECL could be used for protein kinase activity assays.
In addition, some 2D-QDs could also be utilized as catalysts or amplification agents to enhance the sensitivity and sensing accuracy of other ECL systems based on CdS nanocrystals (NCs) or luminol reagents, etc., in chemo-/biosensing.258,308,311,312 For example, the presence of GQDs led to a 5-fold enhancement of the ECL from CdS NCs, accompanied with a positive shift by 80 mV of the ECL onset potential.311 The GQDs could also enhance the catalytic effects of Cu2O nanospheres on the luminol ECL oxidation by a factor of 3.5 fold with a 130 mV negative shift of the ECL onset potential. Both the GQDs-enhanced ECL systems could be used for PCP detection with LODs of 3 pg mL−1 (ref. 311) and 6.6 pg mL−1,312 respectively. These results offer new perspectives for applying signal amplification strategies based on 2D-QDs in practical determination.

7.2 Bioimaging and cancer therapy
Based on their favourable spectroscopic properties, 2D-QDs have been widely applied in chemo-/bioimaging, such as fluorescent or photoacoustic cell imaging,29,30,48,90,111,188,214,313 fibre staining90,111 and anti-counterfeiting.314 Owing to the benign nature of most heavy metal-free 2D materials, the as-prepared 2D-QDs usually show good biocompatibility in bioimaging, specifically, mostly in cell imaging.188 The tuneable PL GQDs could be utilized for labelling a variety of cells, such as murine breast cancer cells (4T1 cells),241 human umbilical vein endothelial cells,241 HeLa cells,5,26,27,148,153,179,182,189 293T cells,94 A549 cells164 and MCF-7 cells.196
2D-QDs such as GQDs,153 MoS2 QDs,94,148 BNQDs,90 g-C3N4 QDs249 and Ti3C2 MXene QDs115 showed little toxicity on the cells after being incubated for 24 h or even longer. Specifically, no obvious cellular morphology damage was observed for the tested cells after incubation with the 2D-QDs.196 The cytotoxicity of the 2D-QDs is usually evaluated via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation test. Typically, more than 80%, even over 90%,188 of the cell viability could be maintained when 2D-QDs at a concentration of 200 or 400 μg mL−1 or even higher were added to the cell samples. All these results confirmed the excellent biocompatibility, showing the cells are favourable for biomedical applications.29,30,188,196,214 To achieve long-term cellular staining or tracing, the fluorescence stability of the internalized 2D-QDs into the cells in vitro and in vivo is also another vital factor to be considered.5 Accordingly, the PL stability of 2D-QDs was studied under continuous light source excitation with a prolonged time of 30 h or 72 h or even longer.5,153,315 For example, when red fluorescent GQDs were swallowed into the HeLa cells, no intensity change of fluorescence was observed with repeated excitations, indicating the good photostability and anti-photobleaching feature of the as-prepared GQDs in the cells.153,204
Depending on their types and modification functional groups, the 2D-QDs may be able to selectively label different subnuclear structures, such as membranes or cytoplasm or nuclei.26,27,153,179,196 Generally, luminescent spots on the 2D-QDs, such as on MoS2/WS2, are usually present in the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of the cells, indicating the translocation of 2D-QDs from the outer cell membrane into the cytoplasm (Fig. 11A). The inability to penetrate into the nuclei suggested that the 2D-QDs are internalized in the cells by endocytosis without any other conjugations.27,148,153,196 The obvious cell imaging results also showed that the 2D-QDs could act as bioprobes for the localization of tumorous tissue.196 Meanwhile, the genetic sequence is not disrupted upon fluorescent imaging, again indicative of the low cytotoxicity of the 2D-QDs.148

In a eukaryotic cell, the nucleus is the most important cellular organelle in determining the cell functions. Thus variations of the nucleus are usually related to an occurrence of disease, and thus fluorescent imaging of the cellular nucleus is of great significance for cell-state monitoring and disease diagnosis, etc. Besides, some GQDs have been reported as being able to diffuse throughout the whole cell,164 while some 2D-QDs have suggested to be efficient as a fluorescent nanoprobe for nucleus imaging, since the 2D-QDs can be prepared at a size less than the diameter of the nucleus pore (∼8 nm). In addition, 2D-QDs upon further modification could interact specifically with the nucleic acids and chromatin.30,249 For example, the modification of GQDs with diamine could manipulate the intracellular permeation of the GQDs from just the cytoplasm to the nucleoli-rich position. As a result, due to the positive functional groups and ultrasmall average size of 2.5 nm, the GQDs have been successfully used for selectively illuminating the nucleoli of the HepG2 cell.30 In addition, Xie's group developed one type of single-layered g-C3N4 QDs that could specifically interact with chromatin and was thus effective for labelling of the cellular nucleus (Fig. 11).249 These g-C3N4 QDs were much more cost-effective than other traditional nuclear dyes, such as 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). All in all, the 2D-QDs have promising application potential as nuclear staining agents or as effective drug/gene carriers.316
Furthermore, the UCPL of 2D-QDs offers the opportunity to harvest NIR light for cell imaging, thus allowing avoiding harmful damage from the high-energy laser source. For example, it was reported that MoS2 QDs could translocate successfully through the cell membrane to enable bioimaging under NIR excitation. Thus the good biocompatibility together with the strong stable UCPL feature make the as-prepared MoS2 QDs promising biological imaging labelling agents.27,141
Although many 2D-QDs show excellent fluorescence efficacy, investigation into the two-photon excitation ones is still an intense challenge.28 The development of 2D-QDs feasible for two-photon imaging is highly desirable for tracking biological species in vivo.29 Compared with one-photon nuclei fluorescence imaging, the two-photon ones based on g-C3N4 QDs are more effective in visualizing and discriminating nuclei because two-photo imaging is much more distinguishable on nuclei, including the nucleolus positions (Fig. 11B).249 In addition, the single-colour fluorescence changes of most 2D-QDs limit their quantitative detection.29 An interesting alternative to solve this problem is to design a rational strategy using two-photon GQDs as a fluorescent probe, combined with merocyanine fluorophore as a dual-emission fluorescence modulator. Under the two-photo excitation at 740 nm, the proposed fluorescence system could be used for the sensitive and specific quantification of H2O2 ranging from 0.2 to 40 μM with an LOD of 0.05 μM in living cells and deep tissues.29
MRI is a popularly used imaging tool, in which gadolinium (Gd3+)-based contrast agents are mostly used, but with a high inherent side effect.67 The magnetic property of GQDs was reported recently based on vacancies and element substitutional defects, which facilitate their application potential in MRI.317 Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that fluorographene QDs67 and boron-doped GQDs could be used as metal-free, cytocompatible contrast agents with a higher spatial resolution.67,317 The presence of functional groups and their small size is favourable for the internalization of these agents into the tissues, giving higher retention times and imaging efficiency compared with the conventionally used metallic contrast agents.67,317
In addition, endowing the fluorescent 2D-QDs with specific functionalities, such as therapeutic agents, for targeting could lead to their great enhancement in tracing sensitivity and imaging efficiency. Inspired by these requirements, simultaneous targeting and imaging tumour cells were achieved based on nanohybrids with a recognition moiety of a multifunctional protein nanofibre (PNF) and an imaging probe, i.e. GQDs. It was verified that the cellular internalization of the nanohybrids by tumour HeLa cells was much stronger than by non-tumorous COS-7 cells (Fig. 12A).189 Targeted imaging could bring a more critical thrust to disease prevention, early diagnosis and timely cancer therapy while reducing the side effects.27,31,32,71,241

Recently, the utilization of 2D-QDs for simultaneous imaging and therapeutic applications was also reported, since they possess not only excellent optical properties but also a superior singlet oxygen (1O2) production ability27,318–321 or strong absorption of NIR light.31,71 Besides imaging, GQDs or MoS2 QDs could be used for photodynamic therapy (PDT), in which the 2D-QDs generate reactive oxygen species e.g.1O2, under the irradiation of 470 nm or 635 nm light to kill tumour cells via causing oxidative stress.27,321 The as-prepared GQDs could also produce 1O2via a multistate sensitization process with a QY of 1.3, about twice as high as that of traditional PDT agents. In addition, the as-prepared GQDs agents could be applied both in vivo and in vitro PDT tests.319 Moreover, the application of GQDs was also able to avoid the possible toxicity in PDT due to the non-specific activation and poor targeting selectivity of the photosensitizer. To avoid off-target effects, the photosensitizer chlorine 6 (Ce6) was integrated onto the π-conjugated planar structure of GQDs to form a hybrid nanosystem, named GQDs-ss-Ce6, showing great fluorescence quenching and low phototoxicity even under light irradiation, while the photoactivity of Ce6 could be selectively restored upon the addition of a reducing agent. The nanosize of the GQDs could also enhance their tumour accumulation through the increased permeation and retention effect (Fig. 12B).318
In addition, photothermal therapy (PTT) is a highly efficient oncotherapy approach with fewer adverse effects. Besides a strong absorption ability of NIR light, low toxicity, good biocompatibility, high stability and tiny dimensions are also prerequisites for a PTT agent. While 2D-QDs such as MoSe2 QDs31 and BPQDs could well meet the requirements. Using ultrasonication-assisted liquid exfoliation, ultrasmall (2–3 nm) MoSe2 QDs with superior PTT-agent properties were prepared, and showed a photothermal conversion efficiency as high as 46.5%. It was confirmed that the MoSe2 QDs had little toxicity, and could effectively induce the death of HeLa cells under 785 nm NIR irradiation.31 Similarly, the BPQDs (2.6 nm in diameter) prepared via liquid exfoliation–sonication also presented an outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency at 28.4%, and showed a large extinction coefficient of 14.8 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm. Furthermore, the PEG conjugation was applied to enhance the stability of the BPQDs while endowing no obvious toxicity to various healthy cells. As a result, the BPQDs in PTT treatment could kill MCF7 and C6 cancer cells efficiently.71
Despite these unbeatable advantages, there are some shortcomings in 2D-QDs-based PTT treatment. Applied alone, it always fails to completely deracinate tumours because the NIR laser intensity inevitably weakens with the increasing located depth of the tumours.32,241 Applying in combination with another tumour therapeutic strategy, such as radiation therapy (RT) or PDT, is one strategy to overcome this drawback. In addition, the MoS2 and WS2 QDs were anticipated to be excellent alternatives as radiosensitizers for RT due to their high Z number.32,241,322 By forming an inorganic–organic platform with polyaniline, the MoS2 QDs exhibited good performance in terms of not only strengthening the photoacoustic (PA) imaging/X-ray computed tomography (CT) signal but also efficient synergetic RT/PTT for tumour treatment (Fig. 13A).241 More interestingly, due to their high NIR absorption and strong X-ray attenuation, WS2 QDs alone could be used as a contrast medium for both PA and X-ray CT imaging of the tumours, and also showed synergistic effects in the combination of PTT and RT simultaneously (Fig. 13B–D).241 Compared with PTT or RT alone, the WS2-enhanced RT/PTT treatment exhibited accurate tumour positioning and efficient cancer cell growth inhibition.32 All these studies provide new opportunities for exploring ultrasmall but multifunctional nanoplatforms for bioimaging and tumour treatment simultaneously.

Apart from biomedical imaging, 2D-QDs could be used in chemical imaging applications, such as in security ink134,323 or as a fluorescent staining agent for fibres, hydrogels, animal fur, feathers and skin.324,325 For example, in one anti-counterfeiting application, the information written by the g-C3N4 QDs was invisible in daylight and UV light, but became readable via a fluorescence microplate reader. In addition, the information could be encrypted and decrypted though treatment using oxalic acid and sodium bicarbonate as the encryption and decryption agents, respectively. These findings provide reference for higher-level anti-counterfeiting technology by using water-soluble 2D-QDs as invisible security inks.134,323 Also, self-healable hybrid hydrogels could be prepared when GQDs were embedded into the N-anthracenemethyloxycarbonyl (Amoc)-capped aromatic amino acid-based hydrogels. The GQDs were stably and well distributed on the nanofibrillar 3D networks. The Amoc amino acid/GQDs assemblies in hydrogel states were more favourable for blue light emission under 365 nm UV irradiation.325
7.3 Optoelectronics
Many 2D-QDs, such as GQDs,40,122,326–329 MoS2 QDs141 and SiC QDs,86 are outstanding electron acceptors and donors in their photoexcited states, which make them promising for application in optoelectronics, such as solar cells,87,122,326–328 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),185,251,330 photodetectors,39,40 spintronics136,331 and optical switches.329
Two methods are normally used for adjusting the 2D-QDs with the appropriate energy level and band for optoelectronics applications.328,332–334 One effective method is cutting or manufacturing the size of 2D inorganic materials. For example, large-area graphene behaves as if it had a metallic nature due to its zero band gap.328 However, reducing the size of the graphene layer to that of GQDs endows it with semiconductor properties, whose band gaps are tunable through the change of size and shape owing to the strong quantum size and confinement effect.332,333 Another important method to regulate the energy levels and band gaps of GQDs is by chemical modification by introducing functional groups.328 For example, by modifying GQDs with nitrogen moieties, including primary amine (NH2-), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), diaminonaphthalene (DAN) or azo, the electronic structure of GQDs could be systematically tuned through the efficient orbital resonance between the GQDs and the nitrogen moieties. In addition, the as-obtained N-GQDs are endowed with tuneable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Fig. 14). This kind of N-GQDs could be used as a potential electron extraction layer for photovoltaics.328 Similarly, QDs generated from SiC, a wide band gap semiconductor with excellent thermal conductivity, possess a tuneable band gap by the size and surface functionalization. DFT results showed that –H-, –OH-, and –NH2-functionalized SiC QDs possessed tunable HOMO–LUMO gaps.86 The –H-functionalized SiC QDs showed the largest HOMO–LUMO gap. Accordingly, 2D-QDs with a tunable band gap could act as electrodes, carrier transport layers and active layers in optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, LEDs, phototransistors or spintronics.

7.3.1 2D-QDs-based solar cells. 
The development of solar cells aims for a high conversion efficiency, low cost, environmental friendliness and easy production.334 2D-QDs could provide a large range of light absorption, ultrafast electron transfer, and multiple exciton generation, which will open the door towards high-performance solar cells.335
(i) Si-Based solar cells. 
The commercial market for solar cells is dominated by Si-based solar cells due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), ample silicon resources and mature Si semiconductor production technique.326,327,334 However, most of the absorbed light cannot contribute to the photocurrent due to the defects density on the surface of the Si layers, which causes the recombination of electron–hole pairs.326 The GQDs, as excellent down-converter materials, can convert UV light into visible light with an efficient QY. Owing to the longer extinction distance, the probability of photons arriving at the Si layers is increased obviously, thus reducing the subsequent power loss. Besides the outstanding optical properties, GQDs can also increase the conductivity of the organic layer due to their inherent high mobility.326,327 Furthermore, the superior aqueous dispersibility of GQDs makes them possible to be uniformly deposited on a variety of surface structures as well as well compatible with other commercially available fabrication processes.326 A supersonic air jet could further accelerate the deposition of GQDs uniformly onto the crystalline–silicon solar cell surfaces by kinetic spraying of the GQDs suspension.336 An example fabrication process of PEDOT:PSS/Si hybrid solar cells with GQDs is shown in Fig. 15A.327 The application of the GQDs could assist in harvesting the full solar energy, thus enhancing the photovoltaic effect, and as a result, high efficiencies of 16.55% for Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells and 13.22% for Si/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells were achieved. When introducing 0.3 wt% GQDs into the Si layers, the filling factor (Jsc) and short circuit current of the SHJ solar cell were increased from 70.29% to 72.51% and 35.31 to 37.47 mA cm−2, respectively.326 These results open up new ways to develop photon-managing, low-cost and highly efficient Si-based solar cells based on diverse 2D-QDs in the future.

(ii) Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells. 
OPV solar cells, including both polymer and small-molecule ones, possess more unique characteristics compared with Si-based solar cells, such as lightness, flexibility, large area, low cost and easy production.337 However, the low conversion efficiency, poor stability and short working life are bottleneck issues hindering their rapid development. The addition of semiconductive heavy metal-containing QDs has been suggested as an option to solve these problems but the toxicity and use of expensive raw materials appear to again impede the wider applications.122
Based on the advantages of tunable energy gaps, size-dependent light excitation, high stability, low toxicity, cost effectiveness and good dispersive ability in various organic solvents, many 2D-QDs, including GQDs, MoS2 QDs and g-C3N4 QDs, have been widely used to enhance the PCE of OPV solar cells.87,122,211,338–343 First, the solution-processable GQDs341,344 and UV-ozone treated MoS2 QDs345 were confirmed to be excellent hole extraction layers (HTLs) in either polymer solar cells or small-molecule ones. Besides the deduced high PCE (e.g. 8.66%),345 the 2D-QDs have also shown much better film-forming capability, reproducible performance and a longer lifetime, indicating the great potential of 2D-QDs for replacing PEDOT:PSS in producing high-performance and stable OPV cells.341,345 Second, GQDs-functionalized Cs2CO3 or tetramethylammonium (TMA) could be used as the electron-selective layer (ESL) or cathode interlayer (CIL) in OPV solar cells.211,340,342 In comparison with pure Cs2CO3-buffered devices, the GQDs-based ones showed a 56% enhancement in PCE and a 200% improvement in stability, resulting from the inhibited Cs+ ion diffusion, suppressed leakage current and better electron extraction.340 In addition, the GQDs–TMA performed well as the CIL when using high working function metals, such as Ag or Au, as the cathode. Accordingly, the obtained PCE (8.80%) was much larger than those (<6.5%) using Ca, ZnO or LiF as the CIL.211
2D-QDs, including GQDs and g-C3N4 QDs, could also be blended with other donor/acceptor materials as an active layer to dramatically improve the PCE.87,343 The application of 2D-QDs as an active layer has led to many positive consequences, such as an enhanced interfacial contact between the HTL and the active layer, accelerated PET from the donor to the acceptor, increased conductivity of the active layer and refined charge transport.87 In addition, to give a comprehensive explanation of the mechanism of PCE enhancement upon the application of GQDs as active layers additives, a study of the relationship between poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) absorption and GQD-induced charge-transfer kinetics was conducted for solar cells based on P3HT:phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM). It was demonstrated that although the surface roughness showed no obvious dependence on the GQD type, the fast P3HT exciton dissociation generated from the addition of PEG-functionalized GQDs was the main contributor to the 36% improvement in the PCE for the solar cells.122
(iii) Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 
DSSCs have been attracting great attention because of their advantages of cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness.346 The search for a new efficient and stable sensitizer with high absorption coefficient and suitable band gap to efficiently harvest solar light is crucial to the improvement of DSSCs.119,347 Among the photosensitizer materials, semiconductor QDs have shown unique characteristics, such as a tunable band gap and multiple electron–hole pairs per photon. Cd- and Pb-based QDs are usually employed due to their unique strong PL; however, their high toxicity limits their widespread use.120 Low-toxicity 2D-QDs have been suggested as competitive substitutes to the Cd-/Pd-based ones.
To date, the most commonly studied 2D-QDs in DSSCs are GQDs, which play the roles of modifiers for the photoanode348,349 and counter electrode350–352 and as a co-sensitizer,353,354etc. Upon the addition of GQDs into TiO2-based photoanodes, the DSSCs could achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of 6.22% and improved PCE of 29.31%. Moreover, the GQDs could be used for the fabrication of Pt-free count electrodes, such as graphene foam nanosheets,351 polyaniline352 and PPy film on F-doped tin oxide glass.350 The presence of the GQDs could provide more edge defects for the hybrid counter electrode, with examples showing outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of tri-iodide.351,352 The as-prepared DSSCs using the optimum hybrid counter electrode showed an energy conversion efficiency as high as 9.59% with open-circuit voltage, fill factor and Jsc values of 0.75 V, 66.5% and 19.23 mA cm−2, respectively. This work provides an cost-effective alternative to substitute the platinum in DSSCs.350–352 Furthermore, the role of GQDs as co-sensitizers in hybrid DSSCs have also been studied.353,354 The results showed that the GQDs could act as energy donors for an acceptor of N719 dye in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based DSSCs, which was endowed with an enhanced efficiency (η) of 7.96% with a Jsc of 16.54 mA cm−2.354 These performance enhancements of the DSSCs was due to the GQDs-deduced effect of efficient visible light harvest, increased photogenerated electron transfer, enhanced dye adsorption and reduced charge recombination.348,349,353 Considering the problems of long-term durability and with the large-scale production of DSSCs, more 2D-QDs with high stability and extinction coefficients are attracting much more attention.355
(iv) Other kinds of solar cells. 
For other kinds of solar cells, GQDs are the most employed 2D-QDs to date.327,356 In perovskite solar cells, the insertion of GQDs between perovskite and TiO2 could significantly improve the PCE from 8.81% to 10.15%, owing to the faster electron extraction of GQDs.356 BPQDs have also been applied to enhance the hole extraction at the anode side of perovskite solar cells, and the PCE could reach up to 16.69%.357 The PCE of monolayer MoS2/InP heterostructure solar cells could be improved from 2.1% to 4.1% after the addition of GQDs due to the enhanced electron transfer from the GQDs to the MoS2 layers.358


7.3.2 Photodetectors. 
The main requirements for new types of photodetectors are high sensitivity, a short response time and low cost, and indeed, the limited sensitivity and the long response time of current photodetectors are the primary problems that need to be solved. The performance of a photodetector greatly depends on the interfacial states and the photogenerated screening field.359 Due to their tunable band gap, great optical absorption ability and effective carrier generation, 2D-QDs are regarded as promising candidates for photodetectors to be applied in the fields of remote sensing, imaging and chemical analysis, etc.39,40,360
GQDs could effectively improve the properties of photodetectors due to their ultrahigh response to the incoming photons and high absorption property.40,360,361 Moreover, the optical transitions are up to ∼6 eV in GQDs, which are especially useful for UV photodetectors.362 With the aid of GQDs, photodetectors with the asymmetric Au–Ag electrode could detect short deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light (254 nm) (Fig. 15B). Under 254 nm light illumination, the rectification ratio was measured as 20 at ±5 V (Fig. 15C), and the current on/off ratio (Ilight/Idark) at +5 V was 5882, much higher than for other DUV photodetectors (Fig. 15D). The GQDs-based device also showed the fastest response speed with a decay time (td) and rise time (tr) of 43 and 64 ms, respectively (Fig. 15E).40 An ultrasensitive photodetector designed with graphene and plant-derived GQDs on lead zirconatetitanate (Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3) (PZT) substrates exhibited a stable performance over a wide range of illumination powers with a short response time.359 The FRET from silica nanoparticles (SNPs) as donors to GQDs as acceptors could also enhance the responsivity of the photodetector by a factor of 0–10/100–1000 fold under forward/reverse biases, respectively.363 In addition, the large band gap of TMDCs, e.g. MoS2, makes them applicable in photodetectors, but their performance is limited by the light absorption and gain mechanisms. Whereas covering the multilayer MoS2 film with a thin layer of GQDs could lead to a photoresponsivity of approximate 104 A W−1 and a photogain of about 107 electrons per photon.364 The as-prepared photodetectors also have a great possibility to be produced in the large scale in practical applications. In addition, the high photoabsorption of 2D-QDs with or without functionalized groups could be combined with other materials to obtain high-performance photodetectors with excellent sensitivity, fast response and multifunction. For practical applications, precisely designed functional 2D-QDs-based photodetectors in the nanoscale should be developed.365


7.3.3 Light-emitting diodes (LEDs). 
The development of high-brightness LEDs with different colours is a rapidly growing field, especially white ones, and as such they offer a new-generation of light source with improved safety, energy conservation and green environmental protection.60,360 The LEDs using QDs as emissive species are regarded as promising components for next-generation displays. However, the toxic and hazardous nature of Cd-/Pb-based QDs seriously impede their applications in eco-friendly opto-electronic devices. GQDs as a “green” alternative took the lead in the use of 2D-QDs in LEDs recently.366–368 Although white-light emission is not a common feature of GQDs, it can be achieved by appropriate functionalization. By reacting edge-oxidized GQDs (GQD-1) using 4-propynyloxybenzylamine, white-emitting functionalized GQDs i.e. GQD-2 and GQD-3a–c, could be obtained (Fig. 16A) due to the dendritic wedges, steric protection and self-aggregation prevention (Fig. 16B–D).360 The GQDs-LEDs devices presented a very low turn-on voltage of ∼2.5 V and a bias-dependent electroluminescence resulting in colour adjustability from blue to deep cyan.366 The light conversion efficiency and luminous efficiency of the white LEDs could reach 61.1% and 42.2 lm W−1, respectively. The LEDs showed high stability even after hours of successive operation.368 All these works demonstrated the strong application possibility of 2D-QDs to be used as inexpensive and eco-friendly electronic materials in LEDs applications.

7.4 Electrocatalysis and photocatalysis

7.4.1 Electrocatalysis. 
Recently, 2D-QDs have been considered as the powerful metal-free nanocatalyst for electrocatalysis, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). All of these reactions are vital for the conversion and storage of clean energy.88 Compared with 2D nanosheets, 2D-QDs possess defect-rich structures and abundant active sites. Designing nanocatalysts with a few layers and ultrasmall size is efficient to increase their electrocatalytic ability in the HER and OER processes.133,172 Besides the GQDs,369,370 MoS2 QDs and WS2 QDs have been mostly studied in regard to the HER recently.96,133,147,172,217 By decorating MoS2 QDs on rGO, low-cost and stable electrocatalysts were prepared for hydrogen production through electrolysis and showed a small overpotential of 64 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 63 mV per decade.217 As shown in Fig. 17A, for liquid-phase exfoliated WS2 QDs (either in 2H- or 1T-phase) used as a catalyst in the HER, the onset potential was 90 mV vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the polarization curve, much lower than those of the control groups including WS2 NDs-300 (WS2 QDs annealed at 300 °C), bulk WS2 and bare glass carbon electrode. In addition, the Tafel slope was estimated to be 51 mV per decade, further indicating the good catalytic performance of such 2D-QDs.133

Because of their natural conductivity, robustness and high surface area, GQDs have been used as promising supporting substrates for precious metal NPs as efficient catalysts for the ORR.371 Based on the structural defects, GQDs were used to increase the ORR activity of supported platinum, palladium and copper NPs via tuning the electronic structure of the metal NPs.371–373 The GQDs were abundant with oxygenous groups, being able to anchor onto the NPs surface or g-C3N4 nanosheets, and thus were favourable for the stability of NPs via avoiding particle aggregation.226,372 In addition, theoretical studies also suggested that the electronegative oxygen moieties could withdraw electrons from the bound metal NPs, thus promoting charge transfer from metal to oxygen during the ORR process.374 As a result, the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting nanocomposites between Pt NPs and GQDs showed a significantly increased ORR catalytic activity, 9-times specific activity higher than that of commercial Pt/C.371 In addition, the original edge defects of GQDs themselves were also used for enhancement of the ORR performance. For example, Wang et al. reported a pure carbon-based composite by nesting GQDs in the graphene hydrogel, and used it as an excellent electrocatalyst for the ORR. The GQDs immobilized in the graphene hydrogel could provide more catalytic active sites. Meanwhile, the graphene hydrogel acted as a conductive substrate to facilitate the electron transfer and disperse the GQDs to avoid the GQDs aggregation.181 Since the inclusion of nitrogen into the catalyst is vital for ORR,372 g-C3N4 QDs was anchored onto the graphene surface to produce a nanocomposite of g-C3N4 QDs@graphene. The electrocatalytic activity for ORR of the N-doped nanocomposites was comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst with regard to the half-wave potential and catalytic current density.88


7.4.2 Photocatalysis. 
2D-QDs are promising candidates for photocatalysis owing to their low toxicity, unique photochemical robustness, tunable optical properties and excellent catalytic abilities.375 In particular, they could be excited via a broad spectrum ranging from the visible to the NIR, and also exhibit attractive UCPL features. Accordingly, 2D-QDs are regarded as promising visible-light catalysts for photocatalysis.7,41,42,130,376,377
GQDs can be used as an effective promoter for UV-activated TiO2 photocatalysts. The presence of GQDs could enhance the light harvesting, which expands their absorption to the visible-light region. Since the carbon nanostructures possess a large electron-storage ability, GQDs could play the role as an electron acceptor and accelerate the charge transfer.130 In addition, the GQDs could be applied to uniformly modify traditional mesoporous photocatalysts, such as bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6). The GQDs could not only make contact with the outside surface of mesoporous materials, but could also be completely dispersed into the porous channels.128
Tuning GQDs with both n- and p-type conductivity could result in an efficient photocatalyst for overall water-splitting. N-GQDs were thus synthesized by treating GO in NH3 at 500 °C accompanied with a modified Hummers’ method. The sp2 clusters in the N-GQDs were used to connect the p- and n-domains as well as the reunion sites for multitude carriers from the two domains (Fig. 17B).216 In addition, g-C3N4 QDs could facilitate the fabrication of the effective photocatalyst.41,378–380 The UCPL of g-C3N4 QDs could also be applied as general energy-transfer components in photocatalytic systems to promote the visible-light-driven photocatalytic capability.7 Visible light (>420 nm) irradiation on N-GQDs or g-C3N4 QDs could produce the simultaneous evolution of H2 and O2 with a molar ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 17B).7,41,216 All these results confirmed the important roles of the N element in the catalysts.
Besides the commonly used 2D-QDs, exploiting more novel photocatalysts is undoubtedly interesting in the photocatalytic field.21,375,376,381,382 MoS2 or WS2 nanoclusters integrated into TiO2 by an in situ photoreduction deposition strategy showed obvious superiority in reducing the power of the photogenerated electrons from TiO2 particles.382 When MoS2 QDs were used to combine with polyimide (PI) to form the photocatalyst (MoS2 QDs/PI), the strong quantum confinement effect of MoS2 QDs resulted in a blue-shift of the absorption band edge of PI, while the interfacial electronic interaction between MoS2 QDs and PI enhanced the charge-transfer rate of MoS2 QDs/PI, thus leading to a 360% photocatalytic enhancement in hydrogen production compared with that of Pt/PI at the same loading amount of Pt.375

7.5 Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors, also called EC capacitors, have been attracting great attention owing to their short-recharge time, long-cycle lifetime and high power density.383 Although 2D-QDs were tested in various applications as mentioned above, their utilization as electrode materials in EC reactions remains a tremendous challenge because of the poor conductivity of most of the available 2D-QDs. Overcoming this shortcoming would be useful to understand the EC processes and to develop high-performance supercapacitors.104
Accordingly, composites of GQDs doped into the conducting polymer polyaniline were confirmed to be efficient electrode materials in supercapacitors. Meanwhile, the application of GQDs made the polyaniline more stable due to their good dispersion and high specific surface area.384,385 WO3−x QDs with aliphatic amines surface functional groups were designed to endow the QDs with uniform distribution and excellent conductivities. The obtained QDs exhibited wonderful EC behaviours and surprising robustness to be charged and discharged without obvious deformation of the CV shape even at a high scan rate of 500 mV s−1.104 In addition, heterostructures with a continuous mesoporous FeOOH QDs nanofilm tightly anchored on the graphene surface were prepared to be used as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
The as-developed supercapacitors showed superior pseudocapacitive performance, ascribed to the disordered structure, which was far superior to the crystalline iron oxides/hydroxides-based materials.43 Besides, GQDs with plentiful acidic oxygeneous functional groups, including –COOH and –OH, can be used as solid- or solution-state electrolytes for the supercapacitors. Neutralizaton of the acidic functional groups can enhance the ionic conductivity and ion-donating ability of the GQDs. These neutralized-GQDs electrolytes-based supercapacitors showed a significantly improved rate capability and capacitive performance.44
7.6 Batteries
Na-ion and Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are also considered to be charming energy storage units in portable electronic vehicles, etc., owing to their environmental friendliness and high energy density.46,129,250 2D-QDs can be used to overcome some bottlenecks of traditional electrode materials, such as poor stability, low electrical conductivities and slow Li+ diffusion, in these battery studies.46,47
Phenylalanine-functionalized GQDs were prepared to modify silicon, which is one of the most outstanding anode materials for LIBs but suffers from a large volume variation and fast capacity loss upon continuous cycling. The GQDs coating layer could enhance the electrical conductivity and efficiently avoid the direct contact of electrolyte molecules with the silicon surface.162 As a result, the composite electrodes showed high and stable EC capacities, which remained as 3068 mA h g−1 even after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1.162 In addition, the introduction of S,N-GQDs into lithium titanate anode could enhance the power density and high-rate performance of the LIBs due to the improved storage lithium capacity and electron transfer.386 Meanwhile, integrating with GQDs could also enhance the stability of VO2 as effective cathodes for Na-ion and Li-ion batteries. Accordingly, a capacity of more than 110 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles at 18 A g−1 could be achieved for the Na-ion battery.47 Furthermore, nanostructure of RuO2 QDs@V2O5 as a cathode provides more reaction sites for Li+ and short pathways for the electron transportation.46 All these works provide facile, eco-friendly and economic ways for fabricating next-generation high-performance batteries.
8. Conclusions and outlook
As an advanced branch of two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D-QDs are attracting increasing attention due to their outstanding physical and chemical properties. In particular, many new types of 2D QDs, such as h-BN, MoS2, phosphorene, MXenes, germanene and silicene, are emerging to meet the higher application requirements. The booming advances in exfoliation techniques have promoted the preparation of 2D-QDs with a variety of unique properties, such as excellent PL properties, low toxicity, good biocompatibility and high selectivity to target analytes, which set the foundations for the more widespread applications of the 2D-QDs in sensing, bioimaging, cancer therapy, optoelectronics, catalysis and batteries, etc. Despite the great achievements, there are still many fundamental and technical gaps and challenges for this attractive but nascent area.
Although the compositions of the 2D-material family cover nearly the whole periodic table of elements, the works on 2D-QDs are much less studied than their bulk materials. Therefore, QDs derived from phosphorene, TMDCs and MXenes are especially attracting more attention. They can be converted into QDs via the commonly used hydrothermal method. In addition, transition metal carbides, such as Mo2C, W2C, WC1−x, TaC and NbC, possess high conductivity, which endow them the great probability to be synthesized using an EC generation method. The bipolar EC system makes it possible to produce 2D-QDs using non-large semiconductive and conductive bulk 2D materials as precursors. Besides, the high production yield of high-purity solid-state 2D-QDs is one main goal to be pursued, which is important for the accurate quantification as well as their mass production. In addition, the definition of nanoclusters (usually less than 2 nm) has rarely been mentioned in the field of 2D materials to date. With new characterization techniques with more precision and higher resolution, nanoclusters derived from the 2D materials will continue to attract much attention.
As for the properties of the 2D-QDs, their optical, catalytic and the EC properties of other TMD QDs, such as ReS2, TaS2, WSe2 and NbSe2 QDs, have also been less characterized. Besides the PL properties, the ECL, CL and enzyme-like catalytic properties are particularly interesting, which could also open more alternatives for 2D-QDs-based sensing applications. To date, the induced chirality by the chiral stabilizing ligands have only been referred to with GQDs, which provides great space for the chirality study of other 2D-QDs. The chiral 2D-QDs can not only be obtained by modifying the small chiral organic molecules, but can also be expected to be synthesized by choosing appropriate chiral precursors. In addition, the unexplored applicability of the chiral 2D-QDs will be possibly addressed through in chiral recognition of enantiomers. In addition, it is expected that a chiral 2D-QDs study would play a great role in molecular recognition and nanomedicine. Moreover, it would further the understanding of the fundamental concepts relevant to chirality in nanostructures. In addition, the mechanism of the optical and catalytic as well as chiral properties of 2D-QDs still remains open to question, hindering the deepening application potentials. Therefore, a thorough and systematic investigation focusing on the mechanism explanation is still in urgent need. For example, by selectively deactivating the oxygen-containing groups, and studying the corresponding enzyme-like catalytic activities of 2D-QDs, the main catalytically active sites could be determined, which would provide a basis to enhance the catalytic performance of the biomimetic enzymatic activity.
As mentioned above, chemical modification and heteroatom doping could be applied to tune the properties of 2D-QDs. It should be noted that the introduced functional groups and heteroatoms could possibly alter the size, defects charge density and size distribution of the 2D-QDs simultaneously, thus all the related properties, such as PL, catalytic features and ECL as well as the QYs or lifetime, may be varied with functionalization. In addition, it also endows 2D-QDs with a variety of new and interesting properties. The high tuneability makes 2D-QDs be promisingly synthesized for task-specific applications. Even though the 2D-QDs have shown various impressive activities, they still possess limitation in terms of their low intrinsic electrical conductivity.
The recent developments of 2D-QDs have far-reaching diverse applications, but the research into 2D-QDs is now in great need of unambiguous and tremendous evidence to assist controlling the functional groups or capping agents on 2D-QDs to achieve supramolecular recognition or selectivity. Besides optical chemo-/biosensing and bioimaging, ECL, CL and EC sensing as well as ECL imaging will attract much more attention in the future. While for bioimaging, target cell imaging, imaging based on the UCPL of the 2D-QDs and two-photon imaging are the key goals in these areas to deduce the side effects in cancer cell therapy. In addition, the inherent catalytic properties of the 2D-QDs can not only be used in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis for energy generation, but can also be designed to be used as EC signal probes for impacting on electrochemistry, which will open more widespread chemo-/bioassays in the future. The 2D lamellar materials have proven potential applications as solid lubricant additives due to their easy interlayer sliding, ascribed to the relatively weak van der Waals forces. The 2D-QDs are suggested to be promising lubrication additives due to their larger surface-to-volume ratio and better amenability to hybridize with other nanomaterials. The novel architecture of 2D-QDs has opened a new strategy for designing smart materials in aerospace and mechanical automation fields. In addition, the GQDs-based QDs dominate in these research areas. It is anticipated that the newly explored kinds of 2D-QDs and corresponding freshly unique properties would provide new insights for the construction of more efficient probes, catalysts and additives in more diverse application areas.
