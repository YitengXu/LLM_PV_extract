    , Accepted 8th August 2020First published on 10th August 2020AbstractPerovskite white light-emitting diodes were realized by using a mixture of sky-blue MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and orange-red rhodamine 6G as the emissive layer. The influences of rhodamine 6G on the properties of perovskite films were investigated using absorption spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy. The emissions from MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and rhodamine 6G were mixed to realize white light. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.33, 0.4) and (0.36, 0.40) were obtained for devices with 2 wt% and 3 wt% rhodamine 6G, respectively.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent electrical and optical properties. Optically pumped lasers with a low amplified spontaneous emission threshold have been realized by using perovskites as the gain media.1,2 Perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency of 25.2% based on perovskites with a high absorption coefficient.3 Because of their tunable bandgap and high color purity, perovskites are promising candidates for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) were first used as the emissive layers to realize perovskite red and green LEDs with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of 0.76 and 0.1%, respectively.4 The EQE of the perovskite green LEDs was later increased to 8.53% by means of nanocrystal pinning.5 The possible applications of perovskite quantum dot LEDs have also been demonstrated.6–8 Recently, near infrared and visible LEDs based on perovskites have been demonstrated to exhibit EQEs greater than 10%.9–13
Perovskite LEDs with white emission were also realized by a variety of methods. The white emission is typically generated by mixing two complementary colors because of the simplicity of fabrication. For instance, an orange polymeric material was blended with blue perovskite nanocrystals to form an emissive layer that generates white light.14 In addition, a blue chip was used to pump perovskite quantum dots in order to generate white light.15,16 Furthermore, an emissive layer was prepared by stacking a layer of cyan perovskite quantum dots on a layer of two-dimensional red perovskite material with an organic interlayer in between the two layers.17 Moreover, a lead-free double perovskite that exhibits intrinsic white light emission was demonstrated.18
Our group recently realized a perovskite white LED with a single emissive layer by mixing emissions from a sky-blue perovskite material, MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 (λem,max ∼ 500 nm), and an orange-near infrared (NIR) organic compound (λem,max ∼ 700 nm).19 The CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.3, 0.49) were achieved. A NIR organic compound was used in our previous work because four commercially available organometallic or organic red dopants that were tested exhibited limited solubility in the solvent, namely, dimethylformamide (DMF), used for perovskite materials. As a result, only a small part of the emission of the NIR organic compound was in the visible range. Therefore, molecules with orange-red emission are desired.
In this work, a well-known highly fluorescent dye and probe that is used for molecular imaging and bio-labeling, namely, rhodamine 6G,20,21 was used as the orange-red component to realize LEDs with white emission. It was found that rhodamine 6G shows broad emission from 550 to 850 nm (λem,max ∼ 620 nm) and exhibits high solubility in perovskite precursors. The light from MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and that from rhodamine 6G which cover different wavelength ranges are mixed to generate white light. Absorption spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping techniques were utilized to understand the properties of the blended perovskite films. Perovskite LEDs were realized with the CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.33, 0.4) and (0.36, 0.40) for the emissive layers with 2 wt% and 3 wt% rhodamine 6G, respectively. Compared to our previous work,19 these coordinates are closer to the ideal pure white emission coordinates.
Results and discussion
In order to realize a perovskite white light-emitting diode with a single emissive layer, a sky-blue component and an orange-red component must be uniformly mixed to form a precursor to be used as the emissive layer. In this work, MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 was used as the sky-blue component and rhodamine 6G was used as the orange-red component. The chemical structure of rhodamine 6G is shown in Fig. 1(a). The precursor of 1 M MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 in a mixture of DMF and DMSO (3:1 v/v) formed a clear and transparent precursor solution, as shown in Fig. 1(b). This precursor was then used to dissolve rhodamine 6G at various concentrations. The color of the blended solution changed to red. No residues of these compounds were observed in the vials, even at concentrations as high as 8 wt%, as shown in Fig. 1(c–f). Therefore, these mixtures were found to be suitable for the preparation of the emissive layers.

SEM was used to investigate the influence of the blending of rhodamine 6G on the morphology of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films, as shown in Fig. 2a–h. No remarkable pinholes were observed. For the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, the grain size was in the range of 200 to 300 nm in diameter (Fig. 2a), and almost every grain was found to be in contact with the bottom PEDOT:PSS layer and to reach the upper surface of the perovskite thin film. However, the grain size of the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films was found to be smaller, with many grains having a diameter less than 100 nm being observed. These small grains were primarily located in the upper part of the films (Fig. 2c, e and g).

The XRD patterns of the pure and blended perovskite films were also investigated, as shown in Fig. 2i. For the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, a (100) reflection peak at 15.1° and a (200) reflection peak at 30.6° were observed, which is consistent with previous reports.22,23 According to the equation d = λ/(2sinθ), the lattice constant was determined to be 5.87 Å. For the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films, the intensity of the diffraction peaks decreased, and peaks belonging to the ITO/PEDOT underlayers were detected. This result confirmed that the crystallinity of the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film decreased, which is in agreement with the results observed from the SEM images.
The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of rhodamine 6G solutions and the rhodamine 6G thin film were first compared, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The absorption spectrum of the 10−7 M rhodamine 6G solution shows a peak at ∼530 nm (Fig. S1b, ESI†), which is consistent with our previous report.24 The intensity of the absorption increases with the increasing concentration of rhodamine 6G (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Part of the absorption spectra of the 10−5 M and 10−3 M rhodamine 6G solutions cannot be shown completely because the intensity of absorption is higher than the upper limit of detection of our instrument. The absorption spectrum of the rhodamine 6G solid thin film exhibited different features compared to the solutions, with two remarkable peaks being clearly observed. The photoluminescence spectrum of the 10−7 M rhodamine 6G solution shows a peak at ∼553 nm (Fig. S1c, ESI†), which is in agreement with a previous report.25 Similarly, the photoluminescence spectra of the rhodamine 6G solutions change with the increasing concentration. The photoluminescence peak shifts from 553 nm for the 10−7 M rhodamine 6G solution to 574 nm for the 10−3 M rhodamine 6G solution. The rhodamine 6G solid thin film shows a broad peak with a maximum at 622 nm. The changes of the absorption and photoluminescence spectra are attributed to the increasing molecular packing with the increasing concentration.
From the absorption spectra of the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film shown in Fig. 3a, an exciton absorption peak was observed at 472 nm, which is in agreement with previous reports.23 No absorption signal from rhodamine 6G was observed. In the case of the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films, the exciton absorption peak exhibited a slight shift from 472 to 469 nm with the increasing concentration of rhodamine 6G. The blue shift in the exciton absorption peak indicated an increase in the exciton binding energy, which is consistent with the result from the SEM images indicating a decrease in the grain size with the increasing concentration of rhodamine 6G.26 Furthermore, the contribution of the absorption from rhodamine 6G increases with the increasing concentration of rhodamine 6G, confirming the existence of rhodamine 6G in the blended films. The PL spectra of the blended perovskite films also showed one pronounced peak corresponding to MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and another pronounced peak corresponding to rhodamine 6G. Because the contributions from rhodamine 6G in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra are similar to those from rhodamine 6G in the spectra of the solid thin film, we speculate that rhodamine 6G molecules are in the aggregated form in the blended films.

The spectra of pure rhodamine 6G are also included for comparison. (c) Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films with various concentrations of rhodamine 6G. 
The time-resolved PL spectra of the pure and blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films were also recorded, as shown in Fig. 3c. The PL decay curves can be well fitted by a biexponential curve. The lifetime decreases with the increasing concentration of rhodamine 6G. However, the curves of the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films with 2 wt% and 3 wt% rhodamine 6G both approach the instrument response function, i.e., their lifetimes are too short to be detected using our instrument; therefore, their behavior will not be discussed here. A short lifetime (τ1) of 1.07 ns and a long lifetime (τ2) of 3.2 ns were obtained for the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, whereas τ1 was 0.24 ns and τ2 was 0.99 ns for the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film with 1 wt% rhodamine 6G. The fast decay component, τ1, was attributed to the nonradiative decay at the grain boundaries, whereas the slow decay component, τ2, was attributed to the radiative decay.27,28 The decrease in lifetime with the increasing rhodamine 6G concentration is attributed to the decrease in the crystal size, which is in agreement with the results observed from the SEM images. The decrease in lifetime with the decreasing crystal size has also been observed in previous works.29–31 This phenomenon can be explained as follows. As the crystal size decreases, electrons and holes are confined in a smaller region, thereby increasing the chance for electron–hole recombination. Furthermore, the crystal size determines the total amount of trap states at grain boundaries. The crystal size is a function of the radiative rate, which primarily originates from the presence of trap states.31
The distribution of rhodamine 6G in MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films was investigated. A confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope with a wide scanning range was first utilized for this purpose, as shown in Fig. 4. For the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, the spectral image collecting light in the wavelength range between 480 and 540 nm shows only sky-blue color, whereas the spectral image collecting light in the wavelength range between 570 and 760 nm shows black color, as shown in Fig. 4a and b. This result confirms that the film is a pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, with no noticeable signal of rhodamine 6G. A low-magnification SEM image showed a wave-like pattern of the pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film (Fig. 4c), which is in agreement with the spectral image shown in Fig. 4a. For the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films, in addition to the sky-blue color from MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 (Fig. 4d, g, and j), the spectral images collecting light in the wavelength range between 570 and 760 nm show red color (Fig. 4e, h, and k), indicating the presence of rhodamine 6G in the MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films. The low-magnification SEM images of the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films revealed flat films, which is consistent with their corresponding spectral images. All these spectral images indicate uniform distribution of rhodamine 6G in the MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films.

EDS mapping was also used to understand the uniformity of rhodamine 6G in the MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The Pb signal present in the upper part of these images and the In signal present in the lower part of these images indicate a perovskite film on an ITO substrate. However, the differences in the oxygen signal from the blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 films with various rhodamine 6G concentrations are similar to the background noise. This result is attributed to the fact that rhodamine 6G contains no specific element that is different from the MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film and the substrate, unlike the organic compounds used in our previous work that contain sulfur for signal detection.19 In addition, the concentration of rhodamine 6G might still be too low and be influenced by the oxygen signal from the ITO substrate.
The perovskite LEDs with white emission are demonstrated based on a simple device structure and energy band diagrams, shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), the perovskite emissive layer, and 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) were deposited using the spin coating method. The LiF/Al electrode was prepared using vacuum deposition. The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS, emissive, and PBD layers were estimated to be 35 nm, 260 nm, and 70 nm, respectively. PEDOT:PSS and PBD were used as the hole injection layer and the electron transport layer, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and rhodamine 6G were estimated as reported in the literature.22,32 During the device operation, the hole carriers are injected from ITO/PEDOT:PSS to the emissive layer, and the electron carriers are injected from LiF/Al and transported through PBD to the emissive layer. The properties of these devices are shown in Fig. 5c–f and Fig. S3, S4 (ESI†). No signal from rhodamine 6G was observed from the electroluminescence peak of the device based on pure MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of (0.09, 0.69) changed slightly with a bias voltage (Fig. S4c, ESI†). In such a simple device structure, the EQE, at room temperature, is approximately 0.003%, which is better than those reported in previous works.22,23

Regarding the LEDs based on blended MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3, two electroluminescence peaks were observed (Fig. 5c, e and Fig. S4d, e, ESI†); these peaks are attributed to the emission from MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and rhodamine 6G. The color rendering index (CRI) values of these devices at various bias voltages are also shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The CIE chromaticity coordinates change with the increasing bias voltage (Fig. 5d, f, Fig. S4f (ESI†), and Table 1). The CIE chromaticity coordinates that are closest to the ideal pure white emission coordinates (0.33, 0.33) were obtained at 9 V and 10 V for the devices with the rhodamine 6G concentrations of 2 wt% and 3 wt%, respectively. The CIE chromaticity coordinates, CRI, and color temperature for the 2 wt% device were (0.33, 0.41), 39.0, and 5627 K, respectively. The corresponding values for the 3 wt% device were (0.36, 0.40), 57.5, and 2769 K. Compared with our previous work,16 the CIE coordinates were closer to the ideal pure white emission coordinates, and the CRI was higher. The change of CIE chromaticity coordinates with bias voltage is a typical feature in organic LEDs.33,34 However, all the explanations35–39 for organic white LEDs were based on the band diagram, in which the HOMO and LUMO levels of the emitter of long-wavelength emission are inside the HOMO and LUMO levels of the emitter of short-wavelength emission. In contrast, rhodamine 6G exhibits a higher LUMO level, and MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 exhibits a deeper HOMO level, as shown in Fig. 5b. Therefore, the explanations appropriate for organic white LEDs might not be suitable for the device realized in this work. To discuss the mechanism of the color shift of our device, spectra normalized to the peak of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 were prepared, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The contribution from rhodamine 6G to the spectra increased when the bias voltage was increased. First, we consider the case where rhodamine 6G is uniformly distributed in MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3. The charge carriers are first injected into the HOMO and LUMO levels of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3. Some hole carriers may then relax to the HOMO level of rhodamine 6G and recombine with electron carriers in the LUMO level of rhodamine 6G. With the increasing bias voltage, more electron carriers can be injected into the LUMO of rhodamine 6G because of its higher LUMO level, leading to a higher electroluminescence intensity from rhodamine 6G. Second, we consider the case of the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3/rhodamine 6G/PBD/LiF/Al. The hole carriers are injected into MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3, and the electron carriers are injected into rhodamine 6G. With the increasing bias voltage, more hole carriers can be injected into the HOMO of rhodamine 6G, leading to a higher electroluminescence intensity from rhodamine 6G. Third, we consider the case of the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/rhodamine 6G/PBD/MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3/LiF/Al. The hole carriers are injected into rhodamine 6G, and the electron carriers are injected into MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3. With the increasing bias voltage, more electron carriers can be injected into the LUMO of rhodamine 6G, leading to a higher electroluminescence intensity from rhodamine 6G.

A preliminary study of the stability and a study of the influence of the perovskite emissive layer thickness on the device performance were also performed, as shown in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†), respectively. The stability of the present device is low. The EQE decreases with multiple operations of the device. With the increasing operation time, the contribution of the perovskite in the EL spectra decreases, possibly indicating the degradation of the perovskite during the device operation. In addition, by using the diluted perovskite precursor solution blended with 2 wt% rhodamine 6G (0.75×, 0.50×, and 0.25× its original concentration) perovskite emissive layers with the thicknesses of approximately 211, 132, and 57 nm, respectively, were obtained, as shown in Fig. S7a–c (ESI†). The conditions for the preparation of perovskite emissive layers using various perovskite precursor solutions were the same. The thickness of the emissive layer decreases with the decreasing concentration of the perovskite precursor solution. Preliminary data showed that the device performance decreases with the decreasing concentration of the perovskite precursor solution, as shown in Fig. S7d–f (ESI†). Moreover, the contribution of the perovskite material in the EL spectra also decreases with the decreasing concentration of the perovskite precursor solution, as shown in Fig. S7g–i (ESI†). The absorption spectra (Fig. S7j, ESI†) were examined to understand the poor device performance. When the concentration of the perovskite precursor solution decreases, the contribution of the perovskite material relative to that of rhodamine 6G in the absorption spectra decreased. Therefore, we conclude that the fabrication conditions for the original perovskite solution might not be suitable for the diluted perovskite solutions. Further experiments are required to gain further understanding.
Much work is required to enhance the device performance. Because the carrier transport properties of rhodamine 6G are not good enough, devices with high rhodamine 6G concentrations showed lower current density and efficiency, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Thus, organic materials with high solubility and appropriate carrier transport properties that can serve as orange-red components for white emission are required to be developed.
Conclusions
In summary, a sky-blue perovskite material MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 and an orange-red organic material rhodamine 6G were mixed to form a material that generates white light with the CIE chromaticity coordinates approaching those of pure white emission. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.33, 0.41) and (0.36, 0.40) were observed for the devices with 2 wt% and 3 wt% rhodamine 6G, respectively. Their morphology and optical and electrical properties were studied. It is expected that the device efficiency can be enhanced by using organic materials with high solubility in a perovskite precursor, orange-red emission, and appropriate carrier transport properties.
Experimental
The perovskite light-emitting diodes were fabricated on ITO glass substrates, which were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and de-ionized water, successively. Then PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI4083) was spin-coated (2500 rpm) onto the ITO glass substrates pretreated with ultraviolet–ozone. The substrates were transferred to a glove box after baking the PEDOT:PSS layer at 120 °C for 20 min for the following fabrication processes. The perovskite precursor (1 M) of MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 (MABr:PbBr2:PbCl2 = 1:0.4:0.6) was prepared in a mixture of DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a 3:1 volume ratio. The perovskite precursor was used to dissolve rhodamine 6G at various concentrations. The emissive layer was prepared by the toluene-dripping method. The precursor solution was filtered and spin-coated on the substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and toluene was dripped on the substrate at 3 s after spin-coating. The emissive layer was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. A PBD solution in toluene (2 wt%) was then coated on the substrate at 2000 rpm for 90 s. LiF/Al was then deposited as the cathode.
The film morphologies were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). The photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (tecSpec MMS NIR enh.) with a 405 nm laser as the excitation source. The UV-vis absorbance was measured using a microspectrometer (SD1200-LS-HA, Stream-Optics Co.). The spectral resolution of the microspectrometer is 1.3–5.0 nm FWHM, with the detection wavelength in the range of 300–1000 nm. X-ray diffraction data were obtained using a Philips X’pert Pro MRD diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, l = 0.15418 nm). The confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy images were taken using a ZEISS LSM 880 with a 488 nm laser as the excitation source. The images of the MAPb(Br0.6Cl0.4)3 film and the film blended with rhodamine 6G were recorded in the wavelength ranges of 480–540 nm and 570–760 nm. The electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. The EL spectra, radiance, and EQEs were recorded and calculated using a spectrometer (USB2000+, Ocean Optics) and the ISM-Nit software (Isuzu Optics Corp.). This ISM-Nit software connects the Keithley 2400 SourceMeter and the USB2000+ spectrometer such that the spectrum, radiance, and luminance can be obtained at the same time for each voltage bias. The spectrometer was calibrated with a spectroradiometer (specbos 1211, JETI). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were measured using a micro-PL system with a 100× objective lens (UniRAM, Protrustech). The wavelength, pulse duration, repetition rate and average power of the excitation were 405 nm, 200 ps, 20 MHz, and 0.1 mW, respectively.
