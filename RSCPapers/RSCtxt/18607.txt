    , Accepted 24th January 2023First published on 27th January 2023AbstractAs the population increases sharply around the globe, huge shortages are occurring in energy resources. Renewable resources are urgently required to be developed to satisfy human demands. Unlike the lithium-ion batteries with safety and cost issues, the redox flow battery (RFB) is economical, stable, and convenient for the development of large-scale stationary electrical energy storage applications. Especially, the aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB) further exhibits a promising potential in larger power grids owing to its unique structural features of storing energy by filling the tank with electrolytes. The ARFB is capable of modulating battery parameters by controlling the volume and concentration of the electro-active species (EAS). Further, halogens show excellent properties, such as low cost and appropriate potential as an EAS for ARFB, further showing an efficient, safe, and affordable energy storage system (ESS). Moreover, to attain the demands of strong activity, high sensitivity, convenience as well as practicality, further attention needs to be paid to material (electrode) design and adjustment. In this mini-review, novel electrode materials, including their potential internal mechanisms and effective regulatory means, are summarized and applied in the zinc-halogen, hydrogen-halogen, and polysulfide-halogen ARFB systems, promoting the development of valuable material systems and the innovation of the energy storage/conversion technologies.Guolong LuGuolong Lu received his B.S. degree (2018) and M.S. degree (2021) from the Wenzhou University, China.

1. Introduction
With the dramatic growth of population in the world, the resources of the earth are becoming finite and gradually decreasing in supply. Globally, environmental issues and energy crises have been perplexing during the past decades.1 Therefore, it is becoming increasingly critical to increase renewable and clean new energy sources in the energy structure, including solar energy, wind power and hydropower developed rapidly. Regretfully, there is an intrinsically intermittent and fluctuating nature of these new energies to scale up and directly integrate into the existing electricity grid systems.2,3 For this, the ESS, especially electrochemical energy storage devices (EESD) are adopted to be a potential pattern to alleviate these issues. Therefore, devotion to the development of effective EESD is accepted to achieve utilizable and efficient conversion of new energy in the grids.4,5
EESD mainly relies on storing electrical energy as chemical energy and achieving the inter-conversion process. Recently, lead-acid and Li-ion batteries have been considered as the two types of the most common energy storage batteries (ESB), showing lower storage efficiency and environmentally hazardous, high-cost, and risky flammable organic electrolytes, respectively, restricting and making them powerless to applications in practical large-scale energy storage applications (LSESA).6,7 Among the most effective ESS for stationary applications, a special place is occupied by RFB technology, encompassing easy scalability of power density and energy capacity, low self-discharge, long cycle life, and cost efficiency to LSESA.8–10 Relative to the traditional Li-ion ESB storing energy methods such as “rocking-chair type”, RFB stores the electrical energy by virtue of the soluble redox couples, converting excess electrical energy to chemical energy and vice versa. It has easy scalability with independent scaling of power density and energy capacity and no detrimental effects of deep discharge, very low self-discharge, low cost for a large system compared to other types of batteries and sup-long cycle life, which is essential for development in tandem with renewable power stations to meet LSESA demands.11,12 RFB enables the megawatt level capability to cooperate with electricity grids by simply changing the volume of the reservoir or the concentration of adjusted storage capacity.13,14
Relative to organic RFB systems with flammable organic solvents, the ARFB systems as a typical RFB with aqueous electrolytes exhibit competitive advantages in LSESA, with respect to Li-ion ESB that show lower electrolyte resistance, higher power density, lower cost, and better environmental friendliness.15,16 The EAS is usually highly soluble to achieve high energy densities and possesses highly reversible kinetics to minimizing activation over-potential losses in both the oxidation and reduction reactions. These are all properties that the halogen-based redox couples (mainly Cl2/Cl−, Br2/Br−, I2/I−) possess.17–19 Here, the F2/F− couple is not considered because the technical dilemma of compatibility and separation that exists with F-based materials has not been better resolved and the corresponding reports about the F2/F− the couple are rare.20 Recently, several review articles relating to RFB were reported to reveal their great promise in various applications.20–22 As well as, reviews on halogens in the RFB systems.18,23,24 However, there are a few attempts to summarize the current advanced work on electrode design in halogen ARFB. In this mini-review, we summarize and generalize the frontier research for the halogen ARFB, mainly for zinc-halogen, hydrogen-halogen, and polysulfide-halogen systems. Introduce through design and modify the electrode to improve the catalytic activity and promote the reaction kinetics. Moreover, we investigate the advancements, and prospective to conducting research directions for novel ARFB systems development and design selections that are more suitable for energy storage devices for LSESA (Scheme 1).

2. Zinc-halogen redox flow battery
Zinc (Zn) is a non-toxic, earth-abundant, and low-cost metal material.25 Due to the highly soluble and the more negative potential (−0.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) in aqueous systems, the Zn/Zn2+ couple is more attractive as the negative electrode in ARFB.26,27 These halides salts (i.e., ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and ZnI2) can be highly dissolved in water at a cheap price, forming the minimal volume factor to achieve the high energy density. Therefore, Zn-halogen RFB has the potential for the development of ESS.28
The Zn-Cl2 system has been proposed early, while the Cl2 needs a cool temperature to dissolve in the electrolyte maximally and reduce the hazards of the spill.29 With complex operation and difficulty in storage and conversion, the sluggish reaction kinetics of Cl2/Cl− develops a limited system that can be abandoned.30 The zinc-bromine RFB (ZBRFB) is arguably the most promising and researched ESS for load balancing to LSESA. Which has been considered a very promising alternative due to its higher energy density, excellent coulombic efficiency (CE), and energy efficiency (EE).31 The ZBRFB electrode reactions are as follows:      
At the current stage, the Br2 in its complex state limits the kinetics of the Br2/Br− redox reaction and thus influences the performance of the ZBRFB system. One way to address this issue is to increase the electrochemically active surface area of the electrode.32 Nowadays, the ZBRFB usually uses carbon felts (CFs) and graphite felts (GFs) as electrode materials, owing to the high specific surface area, high conductivity, high mechanical strength, and chemical stability, etc.33,34 Adding specific catalytic centers such as oxygen functional groups or nitrogen (N) centers to the surface of the electrode is also proposed to increase the kinetics of the Br2/Br− redox reaction.35 Dixon et al. by modifying the GFs electrode by thermal treatment and plasma treatment with the oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, which increased the surface area, fabricated oxygen functional group defects as well as N doping in the GFs.36 The excellent charge transfer/adsorb between the electrode and polybromide phase is expected through halogen/hydrogen bonding, and between the complexed Br and oxygen/proton of the phenolic or carboxyl functional groups. Heteroatom (like N) doping is an effective strategy to alter the electron distribution and local bonding environment of carbon.37 The N-doped carbon spheres (N-CS) fabricated by Fu et al. developed for the Br2/Br− redox couple, which yielded a decent EE (82.5%) at 80 mA cm−2.38 Moreover, the low-dimensional N-doped carbon (NOMC-2D) as the electrocatalyst for the ZBRFB was investigated, NOMC-2D acted as the active sites of the electrodes, yielding a decent electrocatalytic activity toward the Br2/Br− redox couple.39–41 The characteristic dimensions of carbon have a significant effect on the exposure of the active sites and the mass transfer of the reactive species, more effective in constructing porous electrodes in ZBRFB, which could yield an EE (84.3%) at 80 mA cm−2. Fan et al. introduced the electrochemical active coordination site Br2 to the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Br-Ti3C2Tx) host and constructed an advanced ZBRFB using a facile electrodeposition process.42,43 The ex situ experimental characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) simulations have validated the intrinsic affinity between MXenes and Br species by focusing on both the starting Br2 and possible reaction products, Br−/Br3− showed the optimized interaction sites of Br species and the Ti3C2Tx host, which are located above Ti, C, and O atoms, respectively. Given the dominant O groups on Ti3C2 surfaces, the Ti3C2O2 slab was constructed by saturating the superficial Ti atoms with O terminations. Inherent mutual attractions were verified as the calculated adsorption energy for all sites and all Br species were negative, suggesting a spontaneous behavior. It was demonstrated as their spontaneous fixation accompanied by rapid transfer of electrons in the interface region and interlayer confinement.
In addition, Br2/Br− reactions in the electrode materials were relatively inferior and polarization was relatively high, leading to a low power density and short cycle life in ZBRFB. Zhang et al. designed a multifunctional carbon felt-based electrode (NTCF) with abundant N-rich defects (Fig. 1A), which had a high-power density and long-cycle life in ZBRFB.44 The plentiful N-rich defects on its carbon fibers increased the specific surface area and roughness and made NTCF achieve higher hydrophilicity, and provided more reaction sites to decrease the diffusion polarization. Moreover, the NTCF exhibited improved absorption ability to bromine molecules and zinc atoms (Fig. 1B), which was proved by DFT calculations. Platinum (Pt) is one of the most effective electrocatalysts, which is used in a wide variety of applications, due to its selective catalytic activity, oxidation–reduction potential, and more resistivity to electrochemical oxidation.45,46

Ragupathy et al. designed a ZBRFB (Fig. 1C) using a pulsed laser deposition physical process to deposit a very minimum quantity of Pt on the surface of GFs with heat treatment (Fig. 1D), which was utilized to improve the Br2/Br− redox reaction kinetics of the electrode in ZBRFB.47 Best ever avg. CE (99.96%) and avg. EE (∼88%) were observed for the ZBRFB tested at 50 mA cm−2. Besides, Dixon et al. modified the GFs by using Co ions; it was expected that the well-aligned nanostructures as well as oxygen functional groups were formed on the electrode surface.50,51 It is a transition metal-assisted thermal treatment that can facilitate better mass transport of the dense polybromide groups into the bulk of the electrode, leading to a better charge transfer between the polybromide and CFs.52 Kim et al. attempted to use the titanium-based mesh to replace the conventional polymer mesh as the electro-active material to impart versatile functionality, retaining the dimensional space upon deposition and stripping, and sufficient electrolyte diffusion at the anode side.53 He et al. employed an anion-conducting polymer containing the poly (biphenyl pyridine) (PBP) backbone to function as the bromide conductor and polybromide confiner.54 Lu et al. used lamella-like porous carbon nitride nanosheets (PCNS) with adsorption and spatial confinement effects to modify cathodes for ZBRFB.48 The large specific surface area and plentiful N-containing groups enabled PCNS with excellent adsorption capacity (Fig. 1E), which captured bromine species into the pores on the PCNS layers (Fig. 1F). The captured bromine species were subsequently confined in the PCNS interlayers due to the strong interaction between the bromine species and N-containing groups, thus effectively suppressing bromine diffusion/migration. Various ZBRFBs of different positive and negative electrodes are summarized in Table 1.

There are several noticeable drawbacks to ZBRFB. Br2 is insoluble in aqueous solutions and leads to the production of hazardous substances. Polybromide would diffuse and shuttle to react with the counter electrode, leading to undesirable side-reactions and the degradation of the Zn electrode, resulting in low efficiency and poor cycling stability in the systems, and the kinetics of the Br2/Br− couple conversion reaction is relatively low.55 Hence, I2 is abundant, lower cost, and less toxic than Br2; the zinc-iodide RFB (ZIRFB) shows outstanding kinetics of the I−/I3− redox couple for the highly soluble triiodide (I3−) ions, which is promising to replace ZBRFB as the next generation LSESA.56,57 The ZIRFB electrode reactions are as follows:      
Since Li et al. proposed the first concept of ZIRFB emphasizing its huge energy capacity value,58 various porous carbon-based materials have been developed as an iodine cathode, causing the large surface area of carbon materials that can efficiently increase available active sites. Moreover, the pore features of porous carbon are closely related to the adsorption behavior of I− and I3−.59 Introducing defects is a common way to improve the electrocatalyst activity for I2 species. Liu et al. fabricated modified-graphite felt with sulfur-deficient MoS2 (MoS2@GF) as the cathode to enhance the electrochemical performance in the ZIRFB (Fig. 1G).49,60 Heinzel et al. reported a novel 100 cm2 cell design for this battery type. Graphite compound plates with three different flow field types (flow-through, serpentine, interdigitated) were fabricated.61 In this ZIRFB, the highest current density of more than 500 mA cm−2 could be achieved. Xu et al. designed a highly stable static ZIRFB constructed using graphene quantum dots coated with GFs, which improved the stripping of the plated zinc and decreased complexation between zinc and iodine ions due to the smaller oxidation, consistent on the GFs surface.62 Overall, these reflected that the electrode through a design could be an effective strategy to suppress the iodine species shuttling and increase current densities, thus improving the performance of ZIRFB.
3. Hydrogen-halogen redox flow battery
Hydrogen-Halogen RFB is regarded as the traditional static batteries and fuel cells that unite and abide by the basic electrochemical principles in the system. Hydrogen (H2) is used as a reducing agent combined with halogen (oxidizer) dissolution aqueous solution in the ARFB system.63 Therefore, Cl2 and Br2 are most promising to use in such RFB systems as their standard potentials of the corresponding redox couples are the highest (1.36 V for Cl2/Cl−, and 1.09 V for Br2/Br−). For the Hydrogen-Halogen RFB, the reactions are as follows (X representative halogen):        As the reaction equation shows, the protons are transferred from the anode through the membrane into the electrolyte with the charge/discharge. There is research investigating bromine with different chemical agents in aqueous electrolytes for the complexation of RFB systems.64 The bromine vapor pressure variation, the insoluble matter storage halogen, and the solid material form show the bromine high concentrations (13.6 M) stored in the fused salt, with the theoretical energy capacity rushing up to 730 Ah L−1.63,65 Recently, it was found that the hydrogen-bromine RFB (HBRFB) possesses higher specific power with a voltage efficiency of more than 90% and higher solubility in an aqueous solution, and is an interesting subject for research. In typical HBRFB systems, Pt catalysts are often used as electrode materials (Fig. 2A).66 Wlodarczyk et al. explored the new concepts and models and developed the concentrated solutions for bromine cathode thermodynamics in HBRFB chemistry, which made polybromides formation concentrations up to 7.7 mol L−1 (HBr) and 3.85 mol L−1 (Br2) and a significant impact on the open-circuit potential.67 Chlorine RFB has appealing properties such as fast kinetics and high reduction potential. Wang et al. reported chlorine RFB that reversibly processes electrolysis in NaCl aqueous solution with RuO2-TiO2@C, then Cl2 is generated and transformed into the carbonaceous tetrachloride (CCl4) (Fig. 2B).68 For the hydrogen-chlorine system and hydrogen-bromine system both are toxic and corrosive, especially to the concentrated solution stored in a tank. Another risk is the catalytic layer degradation when halogen crossover occurs through the separator.67,69 That is possible to achieve an energy capacity of about 170 Wh kg−1, whereas it is still much lower than that of lithium-ion batteries that limit their application, and halogens show insufficient solubility in water. Therefore, all lead to limitations on the value of the specific energy capacity and its development.

4. Polysulfide-halogen redox flow battery
Sulphur is abundant on earth and polysulfides have very high solubility and reversibility in aqueous media. The polysulfide species have higher active redox and a higher energy density of batteries.70–72 The polysulphide-bromine RFB (PBRFB) has been reported since the early 1980s,73,74 and then by employing sodium bromides and sodium polysulfides as the electrolytes, a standard battery voltage arrived at 1.36 V.75
The system has serious crossovers issues that cause precipitation of the sulfur species and over-accumulation on carbon electrodes. Moreover, the formation of Br2 is a volatile and toxic obsession of this large-scale ARFB system.76 Comparatively speaking, iodide shows better solubility relative to bromine, therefore, it has a higher volumetric capacity of the electrolyte and faster kinetics as for ARFB. Lu et al. reported the polysulfide-iodide RFB (PIRFB) (Fig. 3A),77 they employed highly soluble KI and K2S2 as the redox-active materials as the catholyte and anolyte, respectively (Fig. 3B). Then, Brushett et al. made use of the sodium polysulfide and sodium polyiodide as the base of electrolytes in a similar PIRFB system, to investigate the individual electrolyte and full cell performance characteristics.78 Which makes the PIRFB has good redox reversibility of both the sulfide- and iodide-based electrolytes in the symmetric battery experiments and showed 200 cycles at 20 mA cm−2 with a duration of ca. 530 h in the galvanostatic cycle. PIRFB is as high as the theoretical energy density, and its working principle is as follows:

Regulating the electrode structures of the active sites via different methods, such as forming solid solution, heteroatom doping, and phase controlling, can effectively improve the catalytic activity by optimizing the host–guest electronic interactions and the specific adsorption-free energy for reactants.79,80 Therefore, Ma et al. through the in situ one-step solvothermal method on GFs synthesized the CoS2/CoS n–n heterojunction.81 The uneven charge distribution of semiconductor junctions via enhanced charge transfer activities improves the activity of cobalt sulfide-based electrocatalysts.82 Positive and negative electrodes can significantly boost the electrochemically catalyze activities of I−/I3− and S2−/Sx2− redox reactions, meanwhile, improving the absorptivity of the charged ions and promoting charge transfer. Copper-based chalcogenides have been widely investigated as electrodes to efficiently catalyze the redox reactions of the polysulfide couple to improve the conversion efficiency. These materials exhibit superior activity and stability in the polysulfide system.83 Herein, Huang et al. utilized the Kirkendall effect and oriented growth via a self-template process to design a skeletal Cu7S4 nanocage (Fig. 3C),84 which improved the electrocatalytic activities of S2−/Sx2− redox reactions for its high selection, in addition to suppressing the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Moreover, the unique 3D skeletal hollow-opening nanostructures would provide more active sites, accelerating the electrolyte transport and promoting the charge transfer process. The sandwiched electrode was constructed using the skeletal Cu7S4 nanocages coated graphite felt to overcome the falling of nanoparticles. The PIRFB with such an electrode could deliver excellent performance. Liu et al. synthesized a morphology of crystal structure, and surface components for the Cu7S4/CNT composite bifunctional catalyst (Fig. 3D) for PIRFB to enhance the efficiency and simplify the system.85 The high electrical conductivity of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could guarantee fast electron transfer, and Cu7S4 could efficiently facilitate the S42−/S22− and I3−/I− redox reactions, and could run for over 500 h without detectable efficiency decay.
Ge-based sulfides have a higher ionic potential that could promote the adsorption of electrolytes and enhance electrocatalytic efficiency. Zai et al. through the hot injection method synthesized Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals, and then uniformly coated them onto the surface of GFs as electrodes.86 The ones containing nanocrystals can selectively boost the electrocatalytic activities of the S2−/Sx2− redox reactions and suppress HER. PIRFB with Cu2CoGeS4 could produce a high EE (77.2%) at 20 mA cm−2, a power density of 40.7 mW cm−2, and a stable EE retention (92%) after approximately 250 continuous cycles.
Dehkordi et al. first proposed the concept of the magnetic flowable electrode (MFE) by using a magnetic nano-fluid electrolyte (MNE) to improve the performance of the PIRFB test system.87,88 The MFE has a high active surface area, without the need to fabricate a self-supporting three-dimensional structure, and the MNE was effectively dispersed through the battery electrolyte with a low mass concentration that can aggregate on the electrode. MFE strengthens the entanglement of the nanoscale conductors in the conductive networks. MNE can increase the electrochemically active surface area of the electrodes without reducing the porosity due to their high surface area per volume of nanoparticles and no increased pump loss. Relatively, Wang et al. reported a thiolate negolyte prepared by an exchange reaction between a polysulfide and an organosulfide, preserving the low crossover rate of the organosulfide and high reaction kinetics of the polysulfide.89 Various PIRFBs of different positive and negative electrodes at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 under relatively similar operating conditions are summarized in Table 2.

5. Conclusions
ARFB has much potential for ESS with the increasing commercial viability of renewable energy sources. The defects in RFB held back their further development for applications; generally low energy densities, high-cost materials, and design, and modifying the electrode material would improve reaction kinetics and enhance the properties, alleviating these issues. In this mini-review, we mainly introduced the application of halogen ARFB with electrode modification. The three types of RFB systems are summarized in Table 3.90–99 Presently, the bromine and iodine-positive electrodes appear to be more promising, owing to their high solubilities and kinetic reversibility as common electrode materials (CFs or GFs).100–106

So far, the ZBRFB has already been applied to LSESA. Long energy storage times and the potential to deliver full power in seconds have led RFB to be considered one of the most promising electrochemical ESS. With iodine merits revealed and utilized to suit the ARFB, promising to next generation feasible ESS, especially for it as an anode relative to Zn and S, for ZIRFB and PIRFB. Despite their promise, there is still much room for research and improvement, and future research and development on those ARFBs need to focus on those technical issues and challenges:
 [1] Electrode structure constructed. The electrode greatly affects the transformation kinetics of the active materials, which can increase absorption and catalytic activity sites. An excellent and rational electrode structure would improve the electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance, and promote the catalytic effect and conversion efficiency to reduce polyhalide species generating shuttles and specie crossover issues.
 [2] Further focus on improving the iodine electrode, rather than much attention directed merely toward the bromine electrode. Therefore, future studies should focus on novel iodine electrode materials, studying and applying some of the advanced designs.
 [3] Moreover, improvements to energy and power density. Despite the ZBRFB and ZIRFB systems demonstrating the highest energy densities of ARFB, they are still only able to achieve a fraction of their theoretical value. Hence, the establishment of an appropriate catalyst to electrode/electrolyte to enhance the conversion capacity, etc. is needed.
