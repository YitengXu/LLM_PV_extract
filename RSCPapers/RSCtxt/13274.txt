    First published on 22nd January 2020AbstractMesoporous metal-based materials (MMBMs) have received unprecedented attention in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage and conversion owing to their unique electronic structures, uniform mesopore size and high specific surface area. In the last decade, great progress has been made in the design and application of MMBMs; in particular, many novel assembly engineering methods and strategies based on amphiphilic block copolymers as structure-directing agents have also been developed for the “bottom-up” construction of a variety of MMBMs. Development of MMBMs is therefore of significant importance from both academic and practical points of view. In this review, we provide a systematic elaboration of the molecular assembly methods and strategies for MMBMs, such as tuning the driving force between amphiphilic block copolymers and various precursors (i.e., metal salts, nanoparticles/clusters and polyoxometalates) for pore characteristics and physicochemical properties. The structure–performance relationship of MMBMs (e.g., pore size, surface area, crystallinity and crystal structure) based on various spectroscopy analysis techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculation is discussed and the influence of the surface/interfacial properties of MMBMs (e.g., active surfaces, heterojunctions, binding sites and acid–base properties) in various applications is also included. The prospect of accurately designing functional mesoporous materials and future research directions in the field of MMBMs is pointed out in this review, and it will open a new avenue for the inorganic–organic assembly in various fields.

1. Introduction
Functional materials have attracted extensive interest in human civilization and industry modernization.1–5 According to the characteristics of materials, these nanomaterials can be divided into two broad categories: non-porous materials and porous materials. Compared with non-porous materials, porous materials are of great interest due to their abundant pore structure, fast mass transfer capability and high specific surface area.6–8 Many research studies have indicated that porous materials exhibit higher application potential and practical value, and particularly, inorganic porous materials have been regarded as environmentally friendly, low-cost and efficient functional materials.9–11
With the development of nanomaterials and nanotechnology, inorganic porous materials have received great attention in various fields, such as energy storage and conversion, catalysis, gas sensing, environmental remediation, etc., owing to their unique physicochemical properties, including high stability, adjustable pore structures and high surface area.12–15 According to the pore size distribution, porous materials can be divided into three categories (IUPAC), namely, macropores (>50 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm) and micropores (<2 nm).16–18 Among these porous materials, mesoporous materials as a new material have been considered as the unprecedented candidate in gas separation, drug delivery and industrial catalysis.17,19–22 After decades of progress, many efficient synthesis strategies have been proposed to synthesize well-defined mesoporous structures with long-range ordered frameworks, including the typical template technique, sol–gel chemistry and the hydrothermal method.23–27
Benefiting from the templating synthesis concept, numerous mesoporous materials have been designed via the hard-template or soft-template methods, including mesoporous silica-based materials,28–35 carbon-based materials13,36–40 and metal-based materials.19,25,41–44 The hard-template technique based on pre-synthesized mesoporous silica or carbon as the sacrificial template is time-consuming and costly and lacks synthesis flexibility. In comparison, the soft-template synthesis based on small surfactants or amphiphilic high-molecular weight block copolymers as structure-directing agents and templates has been regarded as an efficient method for the designed synthesis of various mesoporous materials. This method is a typical “bottom-up” synthesis and has unique advantages of high flexibility and universal applicability.23,45–48 Mesoporous structures are mainly synthetically generated from the soft templating approach based on the interface coassembly of amphiphilic molecules and framework precursors. Typical amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs) consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, which can be synthesized by various controllable living polymerization methods, such as sequential living anionic polymerization, atom transfer free radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization processes.49–52 Anionic polymerization is relatively difficult for freshman to grasp because it usually requires a strict operation without water and oxygen, while the ATRP method is easy to carry out because it has very high tolerance to impurities, and even those without a polymer background can synthesize block copolymers via this method after a simple training. The composition, molecular weight and hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio can be adjusted easily by changing the reaction temperature/time and monomers, and these physicochemical properties can affect the assembly behavior and pore structure (e.g., pore size, pore volume, thickness of pore walls, etc.). Interestingly, ABCs with segments containing sp2-hybridized-carbon can be converted into residual carbon through high-temperature calcination in an inert atmosphere to support the rigid mesoporous architecture and maintain the ordered and stable framework.13,53 To date, various ABCs have been used as the mesostructure directing agents, such as poly(styrene-b-2-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PVP-b-PEO),54 poly(isoprene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO),55,56 poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(styrene) (PEO-b-PS),57–59 and poly(styrene)-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP).60–62 In these ABCs, the hydrophilic blocks segments can interact with inorganic precursors via weak non-covalent interactions, namely hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals forces.63–66 As shown in Fig. 1,67 a typical ATRP technique can be easily used to synthesize ABCs (poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene (PEO-b-PMMA-b-PS)) via sequential polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene by using an efficient macro-initiator (PEO-Br). It is easy to control the polymerization reaction by changing the initiator and monomers.

The easy availability of various ABCs and flexibility of coassembly have opened up their application in many areas of chemistry and materials, especially for an effective “bottom-up” synthesis of functional mesoporous metal-based materials (MMBMs). Compared to other assembly materials, MMBMs have raised extensive interest in various fields, especially in catalysis and gas sensing.23,31,68–70 Most of them are based on semiconducting metal oxides, transition metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal carbides and so on. In various applications, the physicochemical properties of metal-based materials play an important role in deciding the reaction activity, including surface energy, composition, active facets and band energy.20,68,69,71 Semiconducting metal oxides of n-type or p-type can exhibit distinct electron–hole transfer behaviour, and their heterojunction is an important candidate in many applications.72–75 Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest advances in assembly engineering between amphiphilic block copolymers and metal-based precursors, including molecular precursors, nanoparticles and polyoxometalates. All research directions based on MMBMs are illustrated in Fig. 2, with the hope of increasing the awareness of microstructure adjustment of ordered mesoporous frameworks, such as surface area, pore size, exposed active facets, hetero-interfaces, etc., and more attention will be focused on their intriguing applications in various fields, especially in catalysis and gas sensing. The implication of this review is the attractive precisely tuneable assembly of MMBMs to achieve improved performance in catalysis/gas sensing application, and the theoretical guidelines for building active interface-microstructures will be discussed as well.

2. Assembly engineering of MMBMs
2.1 Assembly principle and mechanism of ordered mesoporous materials by the ABC template
Different mechanisms, including packing of rod-like composite micelles, charge matching and folding mechanism, have been proposed for the ABC assembly process. In addition, ABCs can coassemble with various metal-based precursors to form stable polymer/inorganic oligomer composites via different interactions, such as electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals force and coordination.76–78 Under the driving force of good solvent evaporation, the as-prepared ABCs/inorganic micelles can spontaneously pack into ordered mesostructures, which can be further converted into ordered mesoporous materials through the removal of organic templates via ozone treatment or high temperature calcination or solution extraction.17,79–81 Along with the in-depth understanding of assembly behaviour, cooperative self-assembly (CSA)82 and a true liquid-crystal templating mechanism83 have been widely accepted in the community of mesostructured materials. In terms of the synthesis of MMBMs, the CSA concept is more suitable for the assembly process, especially in the case of high-molecular weight ABCs as templates. In 1994, Stucky's group proposed the classic cooperative self-assembly mechanism,84,85 and the molecular precursors could be hydrolyzed into oligomers that interact with hydrophilic segments of ABCs in polar solvents, where oligomers could change the charge density of the inorganic components and form ordered mesoporous structures with lowest interfacial energy. ABCs can self-assemble into discrete spherical, prolate or cylindrical micelles via hydrophobic interactions between hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments.11,48,76–80 Typically, Yang et al.86 synthesized a series of large-pore mesoporous metal oxides with semi-crystalline frameworks via this CSA approach, including unary metal oxides (i.e., TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, WO3, HfO2 and SnO2) and binary metal oxides (i.e., SiAlO3.5, SiTiO4, ZrTiO4, Al2TiO5 and ZrW2O8). The CSA approach opened up a door for the synthesis of mesoporous metal oxides with crystalline architecture via the soft-template route. All the abovementioned understanding about the synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials provided a solid foundation for the development of MMBMs (Fig. 3).87

Owing to the development of the CSA concept, a series of efficient synthesis techniques and strategies have been applied to design novel MMBMs, where the solvent evaporation induced coassembly (EICA) and solvent evaporation induced aggregation assembly (EIAA) have been considered as the most useful and flexible methods for the synthesis of high-quality MMBMs.58,88,89 For example, the principle of the EICA strategy relies on the evaporation of organic solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, dichloromethane, ethanol, etc.) under gradient thermal treatment, and the inorganic precursor species and ABCs can form uniform composite micelles when the concentration of ABCs reaches a critical concentration. In particular, ABCs can self-assemble into various mesophases by adjusting the polymer concentration or the length of hydrophobic blocks (Fig. 4A), and the mesostructure can also be tuneable by changing the composition or concentration of solvents (Fig. 4B), which makes it possible to create MMBMs with various mesoporous structures. The coassembly of ABCs and inorganic precursors can occur at various heterophase interfaces (e.g., solid–solid, air–solid, air–liquid, liquid–liquid, solid–liquid, etc.), where the as-formed organic–inorganic composite micelles can spontaneously pack into an ordered mesoscopic liquid crystal phase.57,90,91 By adopting the residual carbon supported crystallization strategy, ABCs consisting of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms can be converted into a rigid carbon framework in the mesostructured organic–inorganic hybrids via pyrolysis to support the crystallization of the metal oxide wall and prevent the collapse of ordered mesoporous structures.10,52

2.2 Coassembly of molecular metal salts and ABC templates
Inorganic metal salts, including metal alkoxide and anhydrous chlorides or nitrates, are the most frequently used precursors for the construction of MMBMs. Depending on the properties of metal salts, a specific synthesis strategy can be developed by adjusting or controlling the hydrolysis of inorganic precursors so as to ensure their coassembly with ABCs via noncovalent bonding in organic solvents (e.g., THF, cyclohexane, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethanol).57,92,93 In general, the existing methods for regulating hydrolysis rely on small molecular ligands, such as acetylacetone,70,94,95 hydrochloric acid,96,97 acetic acid,98 nitric acid,55 citric acid,99 and p-hydroxybenzoic acid.52 With the evaporation of good solvents, these hydrolysates can further undergo poly-condensation and form inorganic–organic nanocomposites with a mesoscopic liquid crystal phase due to the increased concentration. After annealing or ageing the nanocomposites, various strategies can be used to remove the soft ABC template, such as calcination, extraction and ozone treatment.100–103 For example, high-temperature calcination (>400 °C) in an inert atmosphere can not only convert the organic ABC template into sp2-hybridized-carbon to support the mesostructure but also promote the crystallization of the mesoporous metal-based framework (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, the obtained ordered mesoporous TiO2 exhibited a highly crystalline framework with a polycrystalline anatase phase.104 Through this method, various MMBMs with a highly crystallized framework have been synthesized, such as WO3, SnO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, In2O3, ZnO, etc. These materials possessed excellent texture features such as high specific surface areas, long-range ordered structures, highly interconnected uniform pores, tuneable pore structures and huge interfaces, which enable their wide application in various fields.

In principle, the type of metal salt plays an important role in the design of MMBMs due to the charge and affinity difference of metal atoms. Metal salts show different hydrolysis rates and interactions with different solvents. Taking the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 as an example,98,103–108 metal halides as a common precursor can interact with ABCs mainly through complexation interactions between metal atoms and oxygen or nitrogen atoms of ABCs, and it can exhibit feasible hydrolysis/condensation rates of the metal species and prevent fast crystallization.109,110 In addition to titanium tetrachloride,103,111,112 other metal halides can also be employed as efficient precursors to design target MMBMs. Moreover, with the introduction of the “acid–base pair” synthesis concept (Fig. 6), various titanium precursors, such as soluble peroxytitanate, tetraethyl titanate, tetra-n-butyl titanate and titanium alkoxide, have been used as precursors to synthesize mesoporous titanium oxide.113 The coassembly between ABCs and precursors relies on typical charge interaction and electrostatic interaction, which involves direct surfactant–inorganic interaction (S+I−, S−I+ and S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+X−I+ and S−X+I−), where “I” represents an inorganic species and “S” represents an ABC in this synthesis system, and “X” is a mediator like small molecular ligands.113,114 It is worth noting that the synthesis of MMBMs based on “acid–base pair” theory is very sensitive to reaction conditions, including solvent composition, temperature and relative humidity.

In addition to choosing appropriate metal salts, attention should also be paid to utilizing suitable ABCs as structure-directing agents for the controllable synthesis of MMBMs. The reported block copolymers for the synthesis of MMBMs can be roughly grouped into two categories, i.e., Pluronic and non-Pluronic type copolymers, where commercial Pluronic-type ABCs consist of triblock copolymers poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)–poly (ethylene oxide), abbreviated as PEO–PPO–PEO (i.e., F127, P123, P103 and F108), diblock copolymers PPO–PEO and stellate block copolymers.67,115–117 By contrast, non-Pluronic block copolymers possess more abundant components with hydrophilic segments like poly(2-vinylpyridine, P2VP), poly(4-vinylpyridine, P4VP), and poly(ethylene oxide, PEO) and hydrophobic segments like polystyrene (PS), poly(isoprene) (PI), and poly(butadiene) (PB), and higher glass transition temperature (Tg) and carbon content.60,118 Over the last few decades, both Pluronic and non-Pluronic ABCs have been widely used to synthesize MMBMs, and various MMBMs with a novel microstructure, including the pore size, pore wall and crystalline framework, have been reported.106,119,120 Traditional commercial ABCs, such as P123, F127 and F108, were used to synthesize MMBMs through the classic coassembly route, however, it was difficult for these templates to support the ordered mesoscopic structure during calcination treatment due to the low thermo-stability. Smarsly et al.108 made a comparison of the mesoporous TiO2 templated from F127 and from the poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) polymer (KLE), and found that the mesoporous TiO2 derived from the KLE template exhibited larger pore size (ca. 10 nm) and higher stability even at 700 °C, which demonstrated the superior stability of the mesoporous framework. Similarly, Fattakhova-Rohlfing et al.121 used KLE as a soft template to synthesize mesoporous TiO2, and the mesoporous TiO2 was found to possess an amorphous mesostructure when treated below 450 °C and maintained a mesoscopic crystalline structure at 550–700 °C. By contrast, mesoporous titania derived from P123 showed 50% crystallinity even at 400 °C and exhibited a collapsed structure at higher temperature. Such a difference is attributed to the fact that KLE polymers possess a higher segregation strength and molecular weight, which endows mesoporous TiO2 with thicker pore walls and generally improved robustness. In addition, block copolymers can exhibit different microphase separation behaviours and form different micelle assemblies in solutions, and the morphology of these micellar structures can vary in the coassembly system upon changing the conditions, such as pH, solvent composition, annealing temperature, and precursor concentration. For example, Yin et al.122 employed dendritic amphiphilic core–double-shell macromolecules as soft templates to synthesize mesoporous TiO2, where titanium tetra-isopropoxide as a precursor was incorporated in the outer poly(acrylic acid) (PA) shell via coordination bonds and underwent hydrolysis/condensation in a single micelle. Interestingly, those ABCs with similar segment compositions but different molecular weights or hydrophilic/hydrophobic volume ratios can lead to mesoporous materials with different mesostructures. Our group designed amphiphilic PEO-b-PS with three different molecular weights by changing the length of PS chains, such as PEO117-b-PS186, PEO117-b-PS232 and PEO117-b-PS297, and the corresponding three samples of ordered mesoporous WO3 were found to possess different specific surface area (136, 95 and 76 m2 g−1) and pore size (10.6, 12.1 and 15.3 nm) under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 7).70 In general, ABCs with longer hydrophobic chains can generate larger pore size and lower surface area due to larger spherical micelles derived from their longer hydrophobic PS segment. Therefore, it is very convenient to tune the pore parameters of mesoporous materials by changing the molecular weight or composition of the ABC templates.

Although most MMBMs such as TiO2, WO3, and In2O3 can be obtained through direct interfacial coassembly between ABCs and inorganic metal salts, it is usually difficult to synthesize some special metal-based materials (e.g., noble metals, ZnO, Co3O4, SnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) through this method owing to the weak interaction between template molecules and precursors and the fast crystallization dynamics at low temperature that can lead to microphase separation between organic templates and inorganic oxides.123 Thus, small molecular ligands containing functional groups such as thiol, hydroxyl, citrate, amino, and carboxyl groups can act as efficient bridges to chelate or bind inorganic metal species and enhance the interaction between ABCs and inorganic precursors.99,124–126 In addition, some special ligands can also control the hydrolysis/condensation behaviour of inorganic metal salts, and thus facilitate the synthesis of MMBMs particularly in the case of metal salts, with a rapid hydrolysis rate. Acetylacetone (AcAc) is a typical coordination agent that is frequently used to retard the hydrolysis/condensation of many inorganic salts through stabilizing the hydrolyzed metal hydroxide sol derived from titanium isopropoxide, tin chloride, tungsten chloride and so on.70,104 Although mesoporous TiO2 and WO3 can be obtained through the direct assembly process without ligands, the AcAc-assisted coassembly process can endow mesoporous TiO2 or WO3 with highly reproducible, reliable, and scalable production in a broader synthesis window. The strong chelation of metal species and AcAc can intensify the organic–inorganic coassembly and make the synthesis more tolerant to allow multicomponent coassembly for producing functionalized MMBMs through element doping or forming solid solutions and binary/ternary oxides (Fig. 8).8

Tin salts such as SnCl2 and SnCl4 are highly sensitive to humidity and are prone to precipitate in solution, and therefore, the synthesis of high-quality mesoporous SnO2 is a great challenge.127,128 Inspired by the ligand-assisted synthesis concept, Xiao et al.129 employed AcAc as a chelating agent to retard the hydrolysis of the SnCl4 precursor and form tin oxide nanoclusters stabilized by AcAc, and these nanoclusters can interact with PEO segments of the PEO-b-PS ABCs to generate ordered mesoporous SnO2 with large pore size (ca. 18 nm) and a crystalline framework. Apart from AcAc, other small molecular ligands can also be utilized to synthesize MMBMs. Citric acid or citrate as a water-soluble chelating agent has been used in the synthesis of mesoporous ZnO, and it can form hydroxide nanoclusters stabilized by citrate groups that can effectively interact with ethylene oxide (EO) moieties of PEO-b-PS ABCs through hydrogen bonds (i.e., Zn2+–O–C–O⋯H+⋯EO) and electrostatic interactions.99 The chelation effect significantly improves the organic–inorganic coassembly and decreases the energy barrier caused by charge difference of organic–inorganic species. Interestingly, resol as a soluble macromolecule bearing multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups can be regarded as a special ligand because it possesses the function of the abovementioned ligands in chelating metal atoms and bridging ABCs and inorganic precursors. Moreover, resol can be converted into residual carbon to assist the synthesis of MMBMs because it has high content of sp2-hybridized-carbon.81,130 For example, Luo et al.131 designed ordered mesoporous Nb2O5 through the resol-assisted EICA strategy using PEO-b-PS as the structure-directing agent and NbCl5 as the inorganic salt. The hydrophobic PS segments can aggregate to produce rod-like micelles, and the resol can function as an “adhesive” to interact with hydrophilic PEO segments via hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, resol molecules can chelate Nb5+ species and decorate PEO domains to form cylindrical core–shell micelles, which ensure a controllable coassembly process. Consequently, by using suitable mediating agents, the subtle coassembly between inorganic metal salts and organic ABCs can proceed in a controllable and flexible way to finally produce various MMBMs.
2.3 Coassembly of nanoparticles and ABC templates
The coassembly of ABCs and molecular inorganic precursors (or amorphous nanoclusters) requires a precise control over the synthesis conditions including pH, hydrolysis and condensation of inorganic precursors, solvent composition and annealing/ageing treatment, and the resultant assembled nanocomposites should be thermally treated by following a specifically optimized calcination procedure at high temperatures to generate ordered mesoporous structures via significant reorganization of inorganic domains for crystallization of pore walls, accompanying the decomposition of ABCs. Most of the MMBMs possess a polycrystalline pore wall consisting of ultrafine grains. As an important alternative method, the direct co-assembly of pre-synthesized ultra-small nanocrystals with ABCs has attracted great attention in designing MMBMs. This coassembly method based on pre-synthesized nanocrystals as building blocks possesses distinct advantages because no hydrolysis of precursors is involved.132 In addition, owing to the pre-crystallized structure, the complex of block copolymers/nanoparticles can be easily converted into target MMBMs under lower calcination temperature and the slight structure shrinkage during the template removal process can enhance the stability of the mesoporous framework.133–136 With the development of interface assembly chemistry, various metal-based nanoparticles have been employed as building blocks to coassemble with ABCs to synthesize target mesoporous materials, such as In2O3, CeO2, TiO2, SnO2, Au, CdSe, NaYF4, FePt, etc.137–141 These nanoparticles possess similar characteristics, including high crystallinity, ultrafine size (less than 5.0 nm), excellent dispersibility in organic solutions and good mobility in the assembly matrix, which favour their controllable coassembly with ABCs. Nanocrystals are typically produced via solvothermal synthesis and high-temperature solution-phase synthesis (e.g., reduction, pyrolysis and alcoholysis), and most of these methods rely on inorganic metal salts and the assistance of special solvent reactions.142–147 Remarkably, these methods allow in situ tailoring of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, crystallinity, composition and hydrophilicity) in the synthesis process, which makes it possible to flexibly and conveniently synthesize MMBMs with new functions and application values.74,148–151 These pre-synthesized nanoparticles can interact with ABCs via hydrogen bonds, coordination and van der Waals force to coassemble into mesostructures. For example, pre-synthesized uniform Au nanoparticles can interact with the thiol-terminated poly(styrene-b-1,2-/3,4-isoprene) (PS-b-PI) copolymer through strong hydrogen bonding (Fig. 9A).58 Similar to the self-assembled structure of block copolymers, the coassembly of nanoparticles and block copolymers can lead to various meso-phases with various volume fractions of inorganic nanoparticles (Fig. 9B).135 The block copolymers with H-bonding acceptors can specifically assemble with inorganic nanoparticles bearing ligands as H-bonding donors, forming an ordered mesostructure and a functional framework (Fig. 9C).141 In this regard, surface-functionalized Pt nanoparticles made of a 1.8 nm Pt core and an 1.4 nm ligand shell can readily and flexibly co-assemble with poly(isoprene-block-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate) (PI-b-PDMAEMA) to form ordered mesoporous Pt films upon removing the organic template from the as-made nanocomposite materials (Fig. 9D).25

Pre-synthesized nanoparticles can be divided into two categories according to their surface features, including ligand-free and ligand-coated nanoparticles, and the difference is mainly caused by their synthesis conditions (i.e., pH, solvent and type of ion or group).152–154 Among these metal-based nanoparticles, only a very few nanoparticles can directly assemble with block copolymers to construct MMBMs (Fig. 10A).9 The as-made nanoparticles possess various surface properties, including surface charge, high surface energy, chemical groups and hydrophilicity, and even some of them are difficult to disperse in polar solvents and are prone to aggregation, which limits their direct assembly with block copolymers. In order to realize a controllable coassembly and flexible interaction with polymer templates, surface ligand exchange or surface modification is usually required prior to coassembly.155–161 The basic principle of ligand exchange is to create favourable surface properties (e.g., hydrophilic surface, appropriate groups, positive/negative surface charge, and high dispersion) by introducing extra ligands or stripping original ligands, and the ultimate goal is to reduce the surface energy of nanoparticles and improve the affinity or binding ability of nanoparticles toward block copolymers. Various molecular ligands have been used to tune the surface properties of nanoparticles, such as 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA), octadecylphosphonate, nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4), allylamine, N,N-di-(2-(allyloxy)ethyl)-N-3-mercaptopropyl-N-methylammonium chloride, triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate (Et3OBF4), 4-hydroxythiophenol, and so on. By using these ligands, many nanoparticles have been demonstrated to assemble successfully with block copolymers via electrostatic interactions and ionophobic interactions.

Compared to the synthesis system involving metal salt precursors, the coassembly of nanoparticles and block copolymers often requires stronger driving force because of the difference (i.e., mobility, anti-aggregation and solvability) between nanoparticles and molecular precursors (Fig. 10B).132 Typically, Corma et al.146 designed 5.0 nm ACA-coated CeO2, La-doped CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 nanoparticles with high dispersibility in aqueous solutions, and commercial P123 as an efficient template could interact with these nanoparticles to synthesize high-quality MMBMs. The mesoporous materials maintained large pore volumes, high surface areas, hexagonal structures and good thermal stability. It implies that the assembly of nanoparticles and ABCs is a flexible and controllable process. Inspired by these assembly strategies, Buonsanti et al.140 synthesized a series of ligand-stripped nanoparticles with various sizes (4.5–8.0 nm) and shapes (spheres and rods, Fig. 10C), including metal oxides (i.e., Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), CeO2, and TiO2), metals (FePt) and metal fluorides (Yb,Er-doped NaYF4). The native ligand (BF4−) was selected to modify the surface of nanoparticles, which facilitates their interaction with poly(methyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene (PMMA-b-PS) copolymers during EICA via the strong enthalpic driving force, and ordered MMBMs could be obtained after removing copolymer templates. Therefore, the assembly between block copolymers and nanoparticles possesses general applicability, and can be used to design many novel MMBMs with multiple components and functionalities, including metals, noble metals, metal fluorides and in situ doped materials. These mesoporous materials derived from nanoparticles can exhibit abundant exposed active sites and crystal facets and quantum effects, due to which they possess potential advantages for practical application involving host–guest interactions, especially in catalysis and energy conversion and storage. It is precisely because the assembly behaviour is dependent on the properties of nanoparticles, such as the size, shape, surface ligands, components, surface charge, hydrophilicity, etc., adjusting the above parameters effectively is a critical development for the synthesis of MMBMs in the future.
2.4 Coassembly of polyoxometalates (POMs) and ABC templates
Apart from molecular metal salts and pre-synthesized nanoparticles, some polyoxometalates (POMs) can also be employed as inorganic precursors for the synthesis of MMBMs. POMs are a class of discrete nanoscale stable transition-metal oxide clusters with diverse composition and properties, such as charge, size and shape, and most of the lab-made or commercial POMs possess functional moieties with negative surface charge.162–168 Keggin-type POMs have attracted extensive attention in catalysis, energy storage and host–guest chemistry owing to their hydrophilic surface, cage-like structure and abundant composition.100,169 Compared with precursors of metal salts and nanoparticles, these POMs usually consist of various elements, such as non-metals (e.g., P and Si) and multiple metals (e.g., W, V and Mo), which is favourable for the synthesis of MMBMs with an in situ co-doped framework. Benefiting from the abundant surface charges, the coassembly between ABCs and POMs is dependent on electrostatic interactions to form ordered mesoporous frameworks with multi-components.76,118,167,170–173 As shown in Fig. 11, the morphologies of PS-b-P4VP/POMs can be readily modulated from spherical micelles to wormlike networks by changing the type of POM with different charges or by adjusting the ratio of ABCs:POMs. However, this driving force is strongly dependent on the cationic chains of ABCs and solvent of strong polarity, and thus generalizing the co-assembly of POMs with block copolymers into mesostructured hybrid architectures remains a great challenge.

Despite the above-mentioned challenge, great efforts have been made to synthesize MMBMs by exploring some unique ABCs with abundant sp2-hybridized-carbon as structure-directing agents to assemble with POMs, and a series of molecular assembled mesostructured composites with different morphologies based on POMs and block copolymers have been reported, such as nanofibers, nanosheets, nanospheres, etc. Nevertheless, up to now, the synthesis of MMBMs from POMs has made little progress. For example, early in 2012, Lunkenbein et al.174 adopted phosphomolybdic acid (H3[PMo12O40]) as a precursor and synthesized inverse hexagonal (P6mm) polyoxometalate composite films based on poly(butadiene-block-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PB-b-PDMAEMA), where H3[PMo12O40] units were selectively incorporated into the PDMAEMA domains based on electrostatic interactions between the protonated PDMAEMA and PMo3− anions. In addition, long solvophilic PB chains can stabilize the PDMAEMA/H3[PMo12O40] aggregates in solution and reliably prevent microphase separation. In this method, although ordered mesostructured organic/inorganic composite films can be obtained, it was difficult to convert these films into pure MMBMs by calcination in air, due to their low thermal stability and high oxygen fugacity. Regardless, the idea of coassembly based on POMs opened up the possibility of exploring new synthesis strategies for MMBMs. For example, Lunkenbein et al.175 used Keggin-type H3[PMo12O40] as a molybdenum precursor, and novel poly(butadiene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PB-b-P2VP) with high molecular weight (30 kg mol−1), which is particularly rich in sp2-hybridized-carbon, was used as a template and carbon source to synthesize hexagonally ordered mesoporous molybdenum carbide/carbon (MoC/C). During thermal treatment in an argon atmosphere (740 °C), MoC/C can retain the mesostructure supported by the rigid inorganic carbon framework (Fig. 12). Therefore, by using novel block copolymers with abundant sp2-hybridized-carbon as the structure directing agents to assemble POMs, ordered MMBMs with high stability and low residual carbon incorporated in the framework can be readily synthesized.

It is worth noting that, in many cases of MMBMs, residual carbon can remain in the framework matrix either originating from metal precursors or derived from ligand-capped nanoparticles, or organic template molecules. The existing methods for the removal of the soft template in the ABC/POM coassembly system can be divided into three categories (Fig. 13): i.e., direct calcination in air, a two-step thermal treatment, first in an inert atmosphere and then in air, and a combination of thermal and plasma treatment. As to mesoporous materials derived from POMs, previous studies indicated that both direct calcination in air and two-step thermal treatment can cause serious structural collapse before complete carbon removal.100,176 It is usually caused by the framework reorganization due to the crystallization of amorphous walls, chemical reactions of the wall constituents and polymorphic transformation. In comparison, the residual carbon in situ generated by pyrolysis of sp2-hybridized carbon-rich ABCs can effectively support ordered mesoporous structures based on POMs and can prevent mesostructures from collapse under H–O-plasma etching to remove residual carbon. Thus, not only the type of block copolymer and precursor has an influence on the synthesis of MMBMs, but also the way of removal of the block copolymers is very critical for producing stable ordered mesostructures. As summarized in Table 1, various MMBMs can be designed and synthesized using different ABCs and metal-based precursors such as metal salts, nanoparticles and POMs.177–222 The texture features of the obtained MMBMs, including the pore size, mesostructure and specific surface area, can be readily tuned by controlling the coassembly of the precursors and ABCs. Moreover, the assembly engineering between ABCs and inorganic precursors is colourful and can be extended to multicomponent and multifunctional MMBMs with tailored properties.
 Fig. 13  Three various strategies for the removal of templates in the ABC/POM coassembly system: direct calcination in air; two-step heat treatment, first in argon and then in an oxidative atmosphere; and a combination of thermal and plasma treatment, wherein argon heat treated samples were exposed to H–O plasma.

3. Characteristics of MMBMs
3.1 Mesoporous metal materials
Metallic materials, especially those based on noble metals (e.g., Pt, Au, Pd, Rh and Ag), have been extensively explored because of their distinctive physicochemical properties that are highly important to their applications. Various metal based nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibers and mesoporous materials, have been reported.11,125,216 Among these nanostructures, mesoporous metal architectures can expose abundant active sites and reaction interfaces due to their large specific surface areas and accessible porous structures. In addition, the inherent conductive advantage of these mesoporous metals can accelerate the electron transfer efficiency inside a mesoporous network, facilitating mass transfer throughout the entire structure. However, due to their high surface energies and reactivity of metals, the synthesis of mesoporous metal materials has remained a challenge for a long time. Recently, owing to the recent advance in interface coassembly, some mesoporous metal materials have been designed successfully via using special organic block copolymer templates and assembly strategies. In the early development stage, the mesoporous metals obtained from the soft templating approach have been limited to 2D hexagonal mesostructures with small pore size (2–10 nm).15,22,25,102,186,217–219 In order to realize the soft-templated synthesis of mesoporous metals with tuneable composition, pore size, surface area and morphology, it is necessary to explore new assembly strategies, new templates and metal precursors.
In reality, early research studies were restricted to the synthesis of mesoporous ABC/metal composites rather than pure mesoporous metals based on traditional small molecule templates followed by reduction reactions, which contained a small length scale and low metal volume fraction. In 1997, Attard et al.220 for the first time reported mesoporous Pt films from lyotropic liquid crystalline phases of nonionic surfactants [octaethyleneglycol monohexadecyl ether (C16EO8)] and hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6). It was found that when the surfactant concentration was over 40 wt% while the metal volume fraction was lower than 60%, the mesoporous structure can be damaged while removing the templates. The above method opened the door for the synthesis of mesoporous metals based on soft templates and metal precursors. Inspired by the concept of lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), mesoporous metals with various compositions and microstructures have been reported (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Rh and Sn).58,117,141,186,218 For example, Yamauchi et al.189 synthesized novel mesoporous Pt particles with giant mesocages about 15 nm based on ABCs (PS3800-b-PEO4800) and H2PtCl6, which was a breakthrough in exploring mesoporous metal materials with large pore sizes. In addition, the final mesostructures of mesoporous metals can be readily tuned by adjusting the feeding ratios of the surfactants/metal salts/water. In addition to mesoporous metals, mesoporous metal binary alloys can also be designed through the LLC template strategy, such as Pt–Ru and Pt–Au alloys (Fig. 14).187,223 As mentioned above, although mesoporous metals can be achieved via the indirect assembly process between soft templates and metal precursors (metal salts), these mesoporous metals templated from LLCs usually possess low mechanical and thermal stability with even dendritic metal deposition, which is ascribed to the weak interaction and high viscosity of the synthesis system. Thus, a more effective and direct synthetic strategy is highly desired for the production of high-quality mesoporous metals.

In a typical synthesis of mesoporous metals, molecular metal precursors were absorbed and reduced to ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs), while these NPs with high surface energy should be capped with ligands to prevent irreversible aggregation or growth.22,216,224–227 Owing to novel ABCs and the ligand-assisted strategy, high-quality pure mesoporous metals with large pores can be fabricated successfully by the coassembly between ABCs and ligand-capped NPs. In this regard, Warren et al.25 for the first time constructed ordered mesoporous metal Pt films through the co-assembly of ligand-stabilized Pt nanoparticles and block copolymers (PI-b-PDMAEMA), where lamellar CCM-Pt-4 and inverse hexagonal (CCM-Pt-6) hybrid mesostructures could be produced by changing the hydrophilic volume fraction. Pyrolysis of the CCM-Pt-6 hybrid can result in an ordered mesoporous platinum–carbon nanocomposite with open and large pores (>10 nm), and then removal of the carbon through Ar–O plasma leads to mesoporous inverse hexagonal Pt. During the assembly process, N,N-di-2-propoxyethyl-N-3-mercaptopropyl-N-ethylammonium chloride as the ligand plays an important role in adjusting the interactions and solubility of nanoparticles, because its excellent hydrophilic property allows favorable enthalpic interactions with a hydrophilic block and meanwhile, it still shows good solubility in solvents that can dissolve the ABC templates.
Besides, some novel techniques have also been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous metals, including the dual-template strategy, electrochemical deposition and wet chemical reduction. The dual-template strategy usually adopts a combination of both silica colloidal crystals (hard template) and block copolymers (soft template). Kuroda et al.188 used silica nanoparticles and P123 as the dual template to induce the synthesis of mesoporous Pt with smooth and rough pore surfaces (ca. 30 nm) in the absence and presence of ABCs, respectively, which further extended the pore range and made the mesopores interconnect via the large windows of mesopores. In addition, this strategy possesses wide applicability for various metals. For example, 3D ordered macro-/mesoporous Ni monoliths can be designed based on organic polymer colloidal crystals as the hard template and Brij 58 as the soft template.186 Nevertheless, the dual-template strategy inherits the drawback of the hard template strategy, such as a complex procedure and time consumption. In comparison, electrochemical deposition based on block copolymers exhibits advantages in the controllable synthesis of mesoporous metals. Yamauchi's group11,15,102,187–190,218,223,228–230 reported a series of mesoporous metals through electrochemical deposition, using nonionic surfactants, including F127, PEO4500–PPO3200–PEO4500 and Brij 58, as structure-directing agents to synthesize mesoporous Pt films with tuneable pore sizes from 5 to 30 nm. The mesoporous Pt films were electrodeposited via the coassembly of copolymer micelles and metal units. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can be extended to the synthesis of mesoporous metal alloys, such as mesoporous Pt–Pd films and mesoporous Pt–Cu films. As displayed in Fig. 15A, mesoporous Au films can be easily obtained through micelle assembly based on PEO-b-PS block copolymers. By changing the type of organic structure-directing agent, various mesoporous metals can also be fabricated via the above electrochemical deposition micelle assembly process, including cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (cationic surfactant) for mesoporous Pd films with small pore size (ca. 2.1 nm), PS18000-b-PEO7500 for mesoporous Au films (pore size up to 25 nm) and PS63000-b-PEO26000 for mesoporous Cu films (pore size 48 nm). Wet chemical synthesis is a simple, efficient reaction route to synthesize some unique mesoporous metals, such as mesoporous Rh nanoparticles. Jiang et al.190 for the first time reported mesoporous metallic rhodium nanoparticles through chemical reduction on polymeric micelle block copolymers (PEO-b-PMMA), and the assembly process involved multiple steps (Fig. 15B), including self-assembly into spherical micelles, hydrogen bonding between the PEO and aqua-complexes, reduction of Rh species and removal of templates by solvent extraction, and the as-prepared mesoporous Rh nanoparticles exhibited high stability at 400 °C. As mentioned above, the synthesis of mesoporous metals is strongly dependent on the micelle assembly and template strategy, and changing the assembly conditions, such as the feature of NPs or ligands, the type of solvent or ABC, pH or the ratio of ABCs:NPs, can precisely regulate the assembly behaviour and kinetics of ABCs/NPs.

3.2 Mesoporous metal oxides
Recently, mesoporous metal oxides, especially transition metal oxides, have aroused great interest in both fundamental research and industry fields because of their intrinsic physicochemical properties, attractive pore structures and a wide range of applications in various fields including transparent high power electronics, piezoelectric transducers, surface acoustic wave devices, sensors and heterogeneous catalysts.54,69,91,182,231 Most of these applications are based on various guest–host interactions (e.g., liquid electrolyte–metal oxide interactions and gaseous molecule metal oxide interaction), and therefore, it is desired to develop highly porous metal oxides that have high surface area and large interfaces to significantly improve the guest–host interaction. Compared with mesoporous metals, the synthesis of mesoporous metal oxides is more flexible and easier in terms of controlling their microstructure, composition and properties. Many classic strategies have been reported for the design of various mesoporous metal oxides, including EICA, EIAA, combined assembly by soft and hard (CASH) chemistries,180 ligand-assisted coassembly and carbon-supported crystallization strategies. These methods have brought a brand-new spring for the development of mesoporous metal oxides. It is worth mentioning that besides mesoporous metal oxides, other MMBMs can also be achieved via the above mentioned methods by controlling the respective synthesis conditions.
Most of the early reports on mesoporous metal oxides rely on ionic surfactants as structure-directing agents. In 1994, some mesoporous metal oxides, including WO3, Sb2O5 and Fe2O3, have been synthesized through direct co-condensation with surfactants via electrostatic interactions between opposite charges or indirect co-condensation via similar charges assisted by counter ions (e.g., Na+ and K+).85 This method led to mesostructured metal oxides with low stability and crystallinity due to the limited supporting effect of small surfactants and uncontrollable hydrolysis of precursors. Due to the development of new synthesis strategies based on novel ABCs and the EICA method, many functional mesoporous metal oxides with highly crystallized walls have been synthesized and applied in various fields. The first report on mesoporous metal oxides with block copolymers can be traced back to Yang's work on various metal oxides with semi-crystalline architectures.86 In this synthesis system, various ABCs have been employed as surfactants, such as Pluronic F127 and P123, and anhydrous inorganic chloride as an efficient precursor can undergo controllable hydrolysis/condensation and assemble with ABCs to form an ordered semi-crystalline meso-framework, and then mesoporous metal oxides can be obtained after removing the templates through the calcination process. The possible assembly mechanism can be divided into three stages: (1) alkylene oxide segments of block copolymers can chelate with inorganic ions via weak coordination bonds; (2) metal salts were hydrolysed and incorporated into the matrix of hydrophilic segments directly or indirectly via electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces; and (3) the above inorganic/organic hybrids can self-assemble into ordered structures via microphase separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks. Interestingly, mesostructured block copolymer/inorganic species composites for oxides (e.g., Ga, Ge, V, Zn, Cd, In, Sb, Mo, Re, Ru, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn and Cu) can also be obtained through the above inorganic/organic assembly method, and most of them can be converted into mesoporous metal oxides with partially crystalline walls and retained the mesostructure by calcination.191,192,197,232 In the following decades, great efforts have been made to explore new strategies to construct mesoporous metal oxides with high crystallinity and thermal-stability.193,233,234 Fortunately, after nearly 20 years of development, a series of mesoporous metal oxides with high crystallinity and an adjustable pore structure have been designed and exhibited unprecedented performance in hot fields. Most typically, Lee et al.180 for the first time provided the “CASH” strategy to achieve highly crystalline mesoporous transition-metal oxides with large, uniform pores, which has made tremendous progress and brought new opportunities for the design of mesoporous metal oxides without severe structural collapse. Based on this concept, our group developed a novel residual-carbon supporting strategy to enhance the crystallinity and prevent collapse of the mesostructure during calcination treatment, and meanwhile adopting the “ligand-assisted strategy” to retard the hydrolysis of inorganic precursors and promote their interaction with ABCs. A series of ordered mesoporous metal oxides with high crystallinity has been designed via the EICA technique or the modified EICA strategy based on lab-made ABCs, including TiO2, WO3, Al2O3, In2O3, NiO, ZnO, SnO2, CeO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, etc.104,131,177,178 The versatile EICA technique has enabled the synthesis of a great variety of mesoporous metal oxides of different compositions based on single component oxides, element doped oxides, nanoparticle embedded oxides, binary or ternary metal oxides and so on. For example, ultra-small Au nanoparticles can co-assemble with PEO-b-PS and tungsten precursors to construct highly ordered mesoporous WO3/Au hybrids, where the introduced ligand group (–SH) can first firmly adhere to the PS segment to form functional PEO-b-PS-SH and then coordinate with Au nanoparticles through strong Au–SH coordination interactions; in addition, PEO segments can also interact with W6+ ions via coordination interactions (Fig. 16).184

To date, the solvent evaporation induced coassembly has been demonstrated as a reliable and reproducible method for designing various metal oxides with tunable microstructure composition, pore size, wall thickness, framework crystallinity, exposed facets and porosity. The underlying principle for all these syntheses regardless of specific pathways or strategies is similar, that is, they are based on the flexible and controllable interaction between amphiphilic molecules and inorganic precursors of either molecular salts or pre-synthesized nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals forces. However, due to the rapid hydrolysis rate and thermal growth of inorganic species, some metal oxides such as Co3O4, CuO, MnO2, and MoO3 are difficult to synthesize by simply following the above coassembly process.120,235,236 To solve this challenge, it is often necessary to explore optimal synthesis conditions using suitable structure-directing agents (e.g., ionic surfactants, Pluronic surfactants, and non-Pluronic surfactants), inorganic precursors (e.g., metal salts, nanoparticles, and POMs) and chelating agents, and favorable solvent compositions. In this regard, Brezesinski et al.231,237 developed a surfactant-mediated methodology and successfully synthesized ordered mesoporous metal oxide films with crystallographically oriented crystals, such as MoO3, α-MoO3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, V2O5 and perovskite. In these syntheses, Pluronic or KLE copolymers together with inorganic/organic species in solutions were dip-coated onto a polar substrate, and the components experience the so called “soft epitactic assembly” starting from aqueous–ethanolic or water-free solutions, leading to the unique surfactant-mediated oriented nucleation of the mesostructured composite from the substrate surfaces. Despite these advances, some important mesoporous metal oxides including Co3O4, CuO, and MnO2 based on the soft-templating synthesis have not been reported yet, and thus more efforts should be made to develop effective new methods or strategies for the synthesis of high quality mesoporous metal oxides.
3.3 Mesoporous metal carbides
Metal carbides, efficient catalysts with high thermal stability, are produced by incorporating carbon atoms into the sites of their parent metals. They have been considered as promising candidates for application in electrocatalysis and energy conversion owing to their outstanding physicochemical properties, such as high melting temperature, extreme hardness/corrosion resistance and attractive electric/thermal conductivity.9,194,238 Compared with metal oxides, metal carbides have high stability under reducing conditions with metal-like properties. As the synthesis of metal carbides requires a high temperature carburization process (usually >1100 K), great attention should be paid to avoid carbon accumulation on the surface of metal carbide particles because it is difficult to achieve carbon diffusion across partially carburized domains. Although the synthesis of metal carbides via the hard-template approach has made great progress, only a few examples of mesoporous metal carbides have been reported using the soft-template technique.20,192,193,196 Typical examples include WC, Mo2C and TiC. For example, commercial cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as a soft template to synthesize mesoporous WC with a hexagonal crystal structure through the carbonization treatment of the as-made organic–inorganic composites at 1173 K under Ar flow.234,239 Nonetheless, limited by the weak interaction between CTAB and salt precursors, these as-prepared mesoporous WC materials exhibit low surface area (76 m2 g−1), a disordered microstructure and poor stability. Therefore, it is of great importance and interest to develop reliable methods to flexibly and controllably synthesize ordered mesoporous metal carbides.
Despite the difficulty in the synthesis of mesoporous metal carbides, much efforts have been continuously made to explore new methods to overcome this challenge. Hu et al.33 reported an indirect synthesis strategy by firstly synthesizing mesoporous WO3/SBA-15 composites through a similar surfactant directed synthesis technique, which employed P123 as the structure-directing agent, and then carbonizing mesoporous WO3/SBA-15 to form mesoporous WxC/SBA-15 via temperature-programmed carburization within 700 °C under CH4/H2 flow. Clearly, the above method requires a complicated multi-step reduction process with low production yield of target materials, and therefore a direct assembly strategy is urgently needed for the synthesis of mesoporous metal carbides. In order to overcome the above bottlenecks, Wang et al.191 for the first time designed ordered 2D hexagonal mesoporous carbon/WC composite nanomaterials through the typical EICA strategy by using ABC F127. After carbonization at 900 °C in N2 flow, a highly ordered mesoporous carbon/WC composite with high specific surface area can be obtained. Similarly, titanium carbides, as an efficient energy material, exhibit high electric conductivity, high mechanical stiffness, low density, and catalytic activity resembling the metals. Yu et al.195 for the first time designed highly ordered mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium carbide/carbon composites based on amphiphilic block copolymers (F127) and a titanium precursor (titanium citrate) via the EICA method in combination with subsequential in situ carbothermal reduction (Fig. 17). The synthesis process contains two steps: (1) the coassembly of organic and inorganic species into mesoporous amorphous TiO2/C composites and (2) further conversion of the composites into mesoporous crystalline TiC/C composites via carbo-thermal reduction above 950 °C. Mesoporous amorphous TiO2/C composites are intermediate products under in situ carbonization, and the target materials can be obtained through one-step thermal treatment. Interestingly, the mesoporous crystalline TiC/C composites possess a 2D hexagonal mesostructure (space group P6m) with TiC nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous carbon matrix. These mesoporous TiC/C composites have various morphologies and tunable Ti/C mass ratios, and the crystalline phase can be converted into anatase, rutile, and Magneli phases and then to target TiC. These novel mesoporous metal carbides will demonstrate magical performance advantage and potential application values in various fields in the future.

3.4 Mesoporous metal nitrides
Metal nitrides have been widely used as both efficient catalysts and catalyst support materials based on their attractive intrinsic properties, such as high electrical conductivity, outstanding thermal and electrochemical stability, exceptional hardness and corrosion resistance, and good catalyst–support interaction. Endowing metal nitrides with an ordered mesostructure can significantly increase their high surface area and mass transfer efficiency for various applications.198,199,240 However, limited by the high nitridation temperature and weak structure self-supporting capability, the synthesis of mesoporous metal nitrides strongly relies on the traditional hard-template process which usually involves three steps: (1) incorporation of the metal precursors into the channels of hard-templates (e.g., mesoporous silica) to form hybrids via impregnation or other methods; (2) conversion of the obtained hybrids into mesoporous metal oxides inside the pores under calcination in air; and (3) further conversion of template-supported mesoporous metal oxides into metal nitrides via high-temperature ammonia treatment, followed by removal of the silica template via chemical etching. With the advance of soft-templating synthesis, the EICA method based on the controllable interaction between ABCs and inorganic precursors has turned into a facile, reproducible and reliable method to synthesize mesoporous materials of various compositions.101,197,221 Many researchers have made a series of attempts to synthesize mesoporous metal nitrides based on ABCs via the traditional assembly route.
Although many early attempts have been made to synthesize mesoporous metal nitrides via the soft-template strategy, most of them failed due to the difficulty in preventing the phase separation of organic ABCs and inorganic species during nitridation treatment at high temperatures. For example, Hisatomi et al.198 employed an indirect assembly strategy to prepare crystallized mesoporous Ta3N5. Mesoporous Ta2O5 was first synthesized through the EICA route by using the triblock copolymer P123 as a soft template, and the obtained mesoporous Ta2O5 was then employed as a precursor to construct mesoporous Ta3N5 by the “silica scaffold method” under NH3 flow at 773–1123 K. Clearly, it is not a direct coassembly approach to construct mesoporous metal nitrides. In 2012, Lee's group197,221 synthesized mesoporous TiN–C composites via the typical one-step EICA approach (Fig. 18 and 19A), where Pluronic F127 was employed as the structure-directing agent. However, these as-prepared mesoporous TiN–C composites were found to consist of ultra-small TiN nanocrystals incorporated in the amorphous carbon framework with 2D hexagonal mesopores (Fig. 19A). In order to solve the problem, subsequently, their group221 used lab-made ABCs PEO-b-PS with high molecular weight (Mn = 25 kg mol−1) as a soft template to replace common F127, and the hydrolyzed TTIP could interact with hydrophilic PEO segments via hydrogen bonds (Fig. 18). Then typical microphase separation between hydrophilic PEO/TTIP segments and hydrophobic PS segments can induce the formation of mesoporous TiO2, and the target product of mesoporous TiN was obtained through nitridation treatment under NH3 flow at 700 °C. This indicates that ABCs with high molecular weights and rigid hydrophobic segments are favourable for the co-assembly process and the construction of high-quality mesoporous metal nitrides with a free-standing or self-supported structure. The strong driving force induced by solvent evaporation can enhance the coassembly between ABCs and inorganic precursors, and extra nitridation treatment will produce highly crystalline mesoporous metal nitrides.

Similarly, niobium nitride (NbN) as an efficient catalyst support candidate has also aroused great interest in energy storage devices, electrochemical catalysts and high critical field superconductors. In this regard, Wiesner's group23,101,199,240 systematically studied the synthesis of mesoporous NbN based on ABCs via the self-assembly directed sol–gel strategy. They first designed a monolithic 3D networked mixed mesoporous metal oxide (Ti1–xNbxO2) via the coassembly of triblock terpolymers and sol–gel derived precursors, and then converted the as-prepared mixed mesoporous Ti1−xNbxO2 into mixed mesoporous Ti1−yNbyN by nitridation under NH3 flow at 600 °C. During the synthesis process, the amphiphilic triblock terpolymers poly(isoprene-block-styrene-block-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PS-b-PEO, ISO) with three molar masses (59600, 63800 and 69000 g mol−1) were used as soft-templates, respectively, and the obtained mesoporous Ti1−yNbyN materials have gyroidal network structures, various sizes and lattice parameters. In order to obtain pure mesoporous NbN, their group adopted the above PI-b-PS-b-PEO with different molecular weights (63800 and 86200 g mol−1) to synthesize pure mesoporous NbN via the typical EICA strategy combined with nitridation treatment at 600 or 700 °C, and the pore sizes could be adjusted from 16 to 31 nm with decreasing treatment temperature (Fig. 19B). For further reducing the formation and crystallization temperatures, a dual-template strategy has been proposed by the same group, where PI-b-PS-b-PEO and F127 (poloxamer/Pluronic block copolymers) as templates could reduce the nitridation temperature to 550 °C, giving rise to hexagonally ordered mesoporous NbN with sub-10 nm pores. Based on soft templating synthesis, many mesoporous metal nitrides have been constructed and applied in catalysis. For example, Liu et al.241 designed a series of 2D layered mesoporous mono- and binary-transition metal nitride/graphene nanocomposites made of different metals such as Ti, Cr, W, Mo, TiCr, TiW and TiMo. These mesoporous metal nitrides exhibit excellent performance as electro-catalysts and behave as ultra-efficient supports for mono-Pt nanoparticles.242 Moreover, it is expected that this method is promising for the construction of other 2D layered mesoporous metal nitrides, carbides, and phosphides.
3.5 Other MMBMs
Besides mesoporous metal carbides and nitrides, other MMBMs have also been explored in multidisciplinary fields, such as mesoporous metal chalcogenides (e.g., sulfides, selenides and tellurides),42,43,91,137,200,243 mesoporous metal phosphonates (e.g., Ti, Zr, V, and Al)97,112,114,119,120,202,203,244–251 and mesoporous metal–organic frameworks.8,19,21,41,68,204–206,252,253 These MMBMs possess integrated merits of mesoporous materials and the inherent characteristics of metal-based materials, including high electrical conductivity, favourable thermo-stability and high chemical activity. After decades of development, although emerging synthetic strategies have been exploited to construct various mesoporous materials, the surfactant-assembly induced synthetic method is still the most attractive and reliable route for the design, synthesis and application of mesostructured functional materials.
Mesoporous metal chalcogenides (e.g., Cd, Zn, In, Cu, Ge, Sn, Sb, Mo, and W) as an important semiconductor family have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent electronic, catalytic, optical, semiconducting properties, etc.96,200 Several research groups have made some progress in synthesizing mesoporous metal chalcogenides via the soft-template approach, and a variety of mesoporous metal chalcogenides with different morphologies (e.g., films, nanoparticles and bulk) have been reported by using different synthesis strategies, including cation-exchange, electrodeposition, coordination reactions and precipitation reactions. Typically, Tohver and co-workers254 firstly reported the synthesis of mesoporous CdS with a hexagonal mesostructure based on oligoethylene oxide oleyl ether as a template, and the distinct cation–ethylene oxide interaction prevented the collapse of the mesostructure during the in situ transformation of CdS. Later on, various commercial cationic surfactants and Pluronic-type nonionic surfactants have also been used as soft-templates to construct mesoporous metal chalcogenides.243,255–257 The synthesis process mentioned above is relatively complicated and lacks universality limited by the weak hydrophilicity of the soft templates and less controllable inorganic–organic interactions. Recently, befitting from the flexible design of ABCs via ATRP or RAFT polymerization, a series of tailor-made block copolymers have been employed in the assembly synthesis of mesoporous metal chalcogenides. Rivest et al.137 used pre-synthesized Meerwein's salt-stripped metal chalcogenide nanocrystals as building units and novel ABCs (PS-b-PDMA and [PDMA-r-PAA]-b-PS) as templates, and synthesized successfully mesoporous metal chalcogenides with large mesopores of about 38 nm, such as CdSe, Cu2Se, PdSe, Ag2Se and CdSe. During the assembly process, the surface coordination sites of nanocrystals can easily interact with the side-chains of block copolymer templates, and after interface assembly between copolymers and nanocrystals and thermal annealing to remove copolymers, the target mesoporous metal chalcogenides were obtained. Based on this assembly strategy, various mesoporous metal chalcogenides, such as CdS(Se), ZnS, PbS and PbS/CdS, have been designed based on various amphiphilic block copolymers, including PEO-b-PBO, PS-b-PMMA and Brij 58.42,43,91,200 In addition to pre-synthesized nanocrystals, inorganic metal salts can also be used as precursors to synthesize high-quality mesoporous metal chalcogenides, and most of them are mesoporous metal sulfides derived from the “oxide-to-sulfide” strategy. Cook et al.96 designed mesoporous MoS2 thin films via the EICA strategy combined with thermal sulfurization, and the synthesis originated from sol–gel type precursors containing inorganic MoCl5 salts and amphiphilic block copolymers PEO-b-PBO (Mn = 11500). High-quality mesoporous MoO2 materials can be obtained through a typical coassembly process, which can be further converted into mesoporous MoS2 by thermal sulfurization in a H2S atmosphere.
By contrast, mesoporous metal phosphonates show high thermal and chemical stability because of their corresponding tetrahedral nature and the strong affinity interaction between organophosphorus and metal ions, and therefore, they possess great potential in catalysis, adsorption, biotechnology, energy conversion and chemical sensing. Various methods, including ligand extension, surfactant-free self-assembly and surfactant mediation, have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous metal phosphonates. Among these methods, the surfactant-mediated synthesis based on amphiphilic block copolymers is the most versatile, flexible and effective method to synthesize high-quality mesoporous metal phosphonates with adjustable pore sizes.10,248,258 Commercial surfactants, such as C16TABr, C16TACl, C18TACl, Brij 56, F127 and P123, have been widely used to synthesize mesoporous metal (Ti, Zr, V, Al, etc.) phosphonates, and organophosphonic acids with their derivatives as a phosphor source played an irreplaceable role in the assembly and formation of mesoporous metal phosphonates. These phosphor sources, including alendronate sodium trihydrate, propylene diphosphonic acid, ethylenediamine tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (EDTMP), amino tri(methylene phosphonic acid) and hexamethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-(methylphosphonic acid), serve as the main components and coupling agents to bind metal ions to form crystalline walls.97,112,247 Because of the rapid hydrolysis of metallic precursors and strong coordination interaction between organophosphonic groups and metal ions, some effective strategies should be adopted to weaken these effects, including adjusting the synthesis conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, and solvents) and introducing tailored organic chelating agents.114,119,120,203,249–251 For example, Ma et al.202 used commercial F127 as a soft-template and EDTMP as a phosphor source and designed a series of hexagonal mesoporous metal phosphonates (Ti, Zr, V and Al) through the surfactant-assisted sol–gel approach combined with microwave-assisted annealing. The as-prepared mesoporous EDTMP–Ti hybrids have a hierarchically porous structure with uniform mesopores (7.1–7.5 nm) and micropores (1.3–1.7 nm), and these mesoporous metal phosphonates maintained high thermal-stability up to 450 °C without structural collapse. Similarly, Brij 56 can be employed as an efficient template to design periodic mesoporous titanium phosphonates (Fig. 20), and the as-prepared mesoporous titanium phosphonates exhibit a highly ordered mesoporous structure and high crystallinity, which can find application in various fields such as catalysis.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as a unique kind of metal-based material, are derived from the assembly of metal ions or metal clusters with organic linkers. Due to their outstanding features such as an adjustable structure, ultrahigh specific surface area, abundant active sites and multi-functionality, MOFs have emerged as star materials for various applications spanning from adsorption and separation, to catalysis, to biomedicine, and to energy storage and conversion.259–261 However, most of the MOFs possess a microporous structure with a pore size of less than 2.0 nm, which limits the diffusion and transport of guest molecules especially macromolecules. Thus, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring new methods and strategies to synthesize mesoporous MOFs, including ligand extension (Fig. 21A), supercritical fluid, metal–ligand–fragment co-assembly, and a templating synthesis method. Inspired by the concept of surfactant assembly, many research groups have succeeded in extending this method to the synthesis of mesoporous MOFs. Qiu and co-workers253 for the first time reported a simple and versatile supramolecular template strategy to design mesostructured Cu-based MOFs with adjustable surface areas, pore volumes and pore sizes by using cationic surfactants. CTAB was employed as a structure-directing agent to synthesize a series of MOFs with pore size ranging from 3.8 to 31.0 nm. It is found that the synthesis conditions, such as pH, solvent ratio and pore expanding agents like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) or auxiliary surfactants (e.g., citric acid and amino acid), have a dramatic effect on the pore structure. MOFs are largely synthesized in organic solutions in which most surfactants, especially those with low molecular weight, are completely dissolvable, the coassembly of surfactants and MOFs’ precursors into ordered mesostructures can be prevented, and therefore, only several kinds of mesoporous MOFs were successfully synthesized through the surfactant-template method. However, this method opened up a door for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs. Later on, some non-ionic amphiphilic block copolymers with high molecular weights, such as F127, P123, P104 and PS-b-P4VP, have been used to synthesize various mesoporous MOFs. For example, Ma et al.205 adopted commercial F127 as a structure-directing agent and synthesized ordered mesoporous Cd-based MOFs through a rational bottom-up strategy using complicated disulfonate acids as ligands (Fig. 21B), and the coassembly process was triggered by strong coordination interaction and can be extended to design other mesoporous MOFs with various metals (e.g., La, Cu and Sr). Similarly, PS-b-P4VP copolymers have also been used to synthesize mesoporous MOFs under acid conditions, such as Zn-based and Cu-based MOFs, and these protonated PS-b-P4VP can self-assemble into uniform micelles and interact with the MOF precursor metal ions (Cu2+ and Zn2+), and then the remaining organic ligands can induce the nucleation and crystal growth to form MOF nanocrystallites with a mesostructure after etching the templates by selective dissolution in THF and DMF.260 However, it is difficult to remove the surfactants from the as-assembled surfactant–MOF composites for generation of a mesoporous structure without compromising the mesoporosity. Thus, in 2019, Li and co-workers19 employed the typical EICA strategy to synthesize highly ordered macro-mesoporous MOFs using colloidal polystyrene (PS) microspheres as the hard-template for macropores and commercial P123 as the soft-template for mesopores. During the coassembly process, these two templates can interact with MOFs’ precursors and the rigid hierarchical pore structure can be introduced into the MOF structure after removing these templates. These research studies show that ABCs are not only frequently regarded as the most flexible surfactants to synthesize common mesoporous materials, such as mesoporous carbon, mesoporous silica, and mesoporous metal oxides, but are also of unprecedented value in the synthesis of peculiar MMBMs, including mesoporous metal chalcogenides, mesoporous metal phosphonates and even mesoporous MOFs, and necessary attention should be paid for the development of MMBMs.

3.6 Typical characterization and identification of MMBMs
In general, MMBMs can be easily evaluated through traditional structural characterization techniques, such as XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, Raman spectra, etc. Among these methods, SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) as an important technique has been used to evaluate the pore structure, such as the crystal phase, orderliness and space group, where the SAXS patterns of MMBMs usually have typical scattering peaks with various q-values (q = 4πsinθ/λ, “θ” represents the diffraction-scattering angle and “λ” represents the wavelength), and the distance of the crystal plane “d” can be obtained from q-values (d = 2π/q). According to the specific values of 1/d, the type of crystal structure can be easily determined; for example, when the scattering peaks accord with 1/d = 1:3:2:7, they are assigned to a hexagonal mesostructure (space group P6mm).36,55,100,262 In addition, according to the diffraction intensity, the orderliness and density of pore walls can be obtained, and thus SAXS has been regarded as one of the most efficient techniques to evaluate the pore structure. By contrast, nitrogen adsorption–desorption testing is the most convenient method for the quantitative evaluation of pore types, and the derived Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods (or Broekhoff –de Boer (BdB) spherical model method) have been developed as the standard methods to calculate the surface area and pore volume/pore size, respectively. Interestingly, the classical adsorption isotherms can be divided into six types (I-, II-, III-, IV-, V- and VI-type), where IV- and V-type isotherms represent the typical mesoporous materials. For most of the MMBMs, the IV-type curve with an H1-type hysteresis loop is the most typical feature, and thus it is considered as the efficient method to define the MMBMs.55,124,263 With the development of theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, various advanced characterization techniques, such as spherical aberration corrected Transmission Electron Microscopy (ACTEM), X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) and in situ spectroscopic methods, have been employed to analyze the structure in qualitative or quantitative manner. In addition, advanced DFT calculations and theoretical models have also been used to explain the interaction mechanism, including assembly behaviour, strong interfacial interaction, surface properties and application mechanism. With the help of DFT calculations and the XAFS technique, many complex mechanisms of interactions or reactions are gradually being understood.264–267 For example, Zhang et al.268 adopted DFT calculations and the XAFS technique to evaluate the interaction mechanism between the Pt single-atom and mesoporous Al2O3, and the relative coordination mode could be easily resolved. Moreover, supported by in situ technology, such as in situ FT-IR, in situ XPS and cryo-electron microscopy, the relative assembly process and reaction behaviour will be easily dissected in the future. With the aid of these technologies, more structural information of MMBMs can be obtained which can provide more feedback or understanding of the synthesis, assembly and application principle.
4. Structure–performance relationship of MMBMs
4.1 Microstructure adjustment of MMBMs
The microstructure of nanomaterials plays an important role in optimizing their performance, and thus it is of great significance to study how to rationally control and adjust the microstructure of MMBMs. In recent years, considerable efforts have been focused on the relationship of the microstructure and performance of MMBMs with respect to the microstructure, such as pore size and interconnectivity, physicochemical properties and surface/interface features. With the appearance and development of ABCs, the microstructure adjustment can be achieved by changing the synthesis conditions for MMBMs during the block copolymer induced assembly process, which brings new opportunities for the development of MMBMs in various applications, such as catalysis, separation, gas sensing, energy conversion, environmental remediation, etc.

4.1.1 Pore characteristics of MMBMs. 
Mesoporous materials attracted increasing attention due to their unique pore features, such as uniform and tuneable pore size, pore volume, surface area, connectivity of channels and wall thickness. These pore parameters and texture properties can largely determine the activity and selectivity of mesoporous materials in various applications, such as separation, adsorption, catalysis, energy conversion and gas sensing.10,33,36,67,269–271 The suitable pore size or connectivity can not only enhance the diffusion rate of guest molecules but also reduce the energy barrier of chemical reactions. However, it remains an enormous challenge to adjust the pore features of MMBMs, and although traditional hard-templating synthesis can produce MMBMs, the pore structure is strongly dependent on the features of initial hard templates whose pore size and wall thickness are difficult to tune within a large range. By contrast, the synthesis of MMBMs based on ABCs as templates exhibits attractive flexibility in the regulation of pore features, and the pore size can be easily tuned by adjusting the molecular weight or the hydrophobic/hydrophilic segment ratio of ABCs.53,66,117,263 Most of the abovementioned syntheses are carried out at liquid–solid or liquid–liquid interfaces based on the noncovalent bonding interaction between ABCs and various precursors. Therefore, extra pore-enlarging agents can be readily used to adjust the pore size for MMBMs to optimize their application performances. In addition, the other pore features (e.g., pore volume and surface area, connectivity of channels and wall thickness) can also be adjusted conveniently via using various calcination temperatures or template removal methods.
Taking pore size as an example, the synthesis of MMBMs based on ABCs relies on the surfactant-induced co-micellization and coassembly mechanism; the ABCs can possess different lengths of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, and can coassemble with inorganic precursors into uniform micelles of various morphologies (e.g., spherical, cylindrical, and layered configuration) with the evaporation of polar solvents (e.g., THF, ethanol, chloroform, and dichloromethane) when the solution reaches the critical micelle concentration of precursor-associated ABCs.122,229,233,272,273 To some degree, the pore size and wall thickness of mesoporous materials are determined by the volume of hydrophobic segments and the volume of precursor-associated hydrophilic segments.14,26 We synthesized three ordered mesoporous WO3 with various pore sizes (10.6, 12.1 and 15.3 nm) by using lab-made PEO-b-PS ABCs with different molecular weights (PEO117-b-PS186, PEO117-b-PS232 and PEO117-b-PS297), respectively.70 It is worth noting that these PEO-b-PS copolymers are prepared by a simple ATRP method and the molecular weights can be easily adjusted by changing the chain length of hydrophobic PS blocks. The as-prepared mesoporous WO3 materials templated from PEO-b-PS with lower molecular weight polymers possess smaller pore size and larger surface area. Similarly, Li et al.66 used triblock copolymer PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO with various chain lengths, including PS31-b-P2VP12-b-PEO409, PS192-b-P2VP143-b-PEO613, and PS432-b-P2VP247-b-PEO1862, as a soft template and designed mesoporous Pt nanospheres with tuneable pore sizes. The hydrophobic PS chains enable the production of an aggregated core of about 7, 14 and 38 nm, respectively, which correspond to pore sizes of 8, 14 and 35 nm for the mesoporous Pt nanospheres, respectively. This indicates that even without using traditional pore-expanding agents like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB), homopolystyrene (PSn) and 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB), the pore size can be changed by using ABCs with different hydrophobic volumes. Similarly, Wang et al.117 adopted commercial templates with small molecular weights (F127 (EO100–PO65–EO100) and Brij 58 (C16–EO20)) and larger molecular weight (PEO4500–PPO3200–PEO4500) as soft templates to synthesize mesoporous Pt films. It can be seen that the pore size of the as-prepared mesoporous Pt films is around 7 nm for Brij 58, about 10 nm for F127 while 17 nm for PEO4500–PPO3200–PEO4500. Interestingly, using a pore-expanding agent (TIPB) on this basis, the pore sizes can be expanded up to 12 nm for Brij 58, 18 nm for F127 and 31 nm for PEO4500–PPO3200–PEO4500, respectively.
In addition to the chain length of block copolymers, the synthesis conditions, such as calcination temperature, solvents, mediating agents and even the type of precursor, can also have a significant influence on the pore feature of MMBMs. In order to synthesize high-quality MMBMs, some functional assisting molecules or interface regulating agents (e.g., resol and silica) can be employed to enhance the interaction between organic ABCs and inorganic precursors. For example, resol could act as a carbon source to generate extra pores in the wall. In this regard, our group designed mesoporous CoOx/C,81 Nb2O5/C,131 and WO3/C130 composites based on lab-made amphiphilic block copolymers PEO-b-PS, and further removal of residual carbon by calcination treatment could form pure mesoporous Nb2O5 and WO3. The obtained mesoporous WO3 synthesized in the presence of resol molecules possessed well-connected bimodal pores (5.8 and 15.8 nm) due to the template effect of carbon derived from resol (Fig. 22A). Additionally, to some degree, the pore parameters of MMBMs can be influenced by the calcination conditions because treatment at higher temperature can cause structure shrinkage due to reorganization of the pore wall to higher crystallinity. Treatment at too high temperatures can even lead to uncontrolled grain growth and structure collaspe.274 Alumina has been widely used in catalysis and adsorption, and it usually exhibits an amorphous phase at temperature less than 600 °C and can be converted into a crystalline phase at higher temperature.55 The pore size of mesoporous Al2O3 materials can be easily adjusted within a certain range by changing the calcination temperature (Fig. 22B). Typically, our group57,182 synthesized mesoporous crystalline γ-Al2O3 with ultra-large pore size (16.0–18.9 nm) using lab-made PEO-b-PS ABCs. The higher calcination temperature (900 °C) gave rise to smaller pore size (16.0 nm) and surface area (114 m2 g−1), as compared to the sample obtained at 600 °C (18.9 nm, 197 m2 g−1). The type of precursor can also affect the pore structure. Cai et al.182 synthesized ordered mesoporous alumina and alumina-supported metal oxides (e.g., Ni, Mg, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ce, La, Y, Ca and Sn) via the facile soft-template method using commercial P123 block copolymers. During the synthesis, the mixed and single oxide precursors, such as Al(OC3H7)3–AlCl3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O–AlCl3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and AlCl3, were found to exhibit various assembly behaviours, which resulted in a significant difference in pore features, including pore size, surface area and pore volume. In contrast, the usage of Al(NO3)3·9H2O as the main precursor led to mesoporous alumina oxide with the largest pore size (11.1 nm), lower surface area and lower pore volume, while instead Al(OC3H7)3 showed the smallest pore size (4.1 nm).

Moreover, other pore parameters like wall thickness and pore symmetry can also be adjusted by changing the synthesis conditions or the kind/composition of template molecules. In general, the wall thickness of MMBMs can be tuned by changing the chain length of hydrophilic segments of ABCs (e.g., PEO, PMMA, and PVP block) and the feeding ratio of precursor/ABC.14,79,275 For instance, Buonsanti et al.140 designed mesoporous ITO with tailored wall thickness (10–14 nm) via a typical EICA method using various ultra-small nanocrystals as metal precursors and amphiphilic PDMA-b-PS as the template, and it was found that the wall thickness was dependent on the molecular weights of the PDMA block while the mesopore size relied on the molecular weights of the PS block. The pore structure or symmetry can vary from inverse Im3m, Pn3m mesophase, Fm3m, P6mn, and so on.23,272,276–278 The above mesopore structure is dependent on the assembly behaviour of block copolymers and the packing means of template–precursor hybrid micelles determined by the volume fraction of the hydrophobic moiety.279 Taking block copolymer PEO-b-PS as an example, when the volume fraction of the PS segments is relatively high (ca. 90.3–94.9%), PEO-b-PS can easily assemble into three typical colloidal particles, such as inverse Im3m, Pn3m mesophase (Im3m or Pn3m cubosomes) and hexasomes with an inverse hexagonal structure (P6mm).54,212 Therefore, it can be expected that, by controlling the composition, molecular weight of ABCs and the used precursors, the pore features or parameters of MMBMs can be tuned for various specific applications.


4.1.2 Crystallinity of MMBMs. 
Framework crystallinity as an important feature can significantly influence the physicochemical properties of MMBMs, and higher crystallinity can accelerate electron transfer and provide a huge active interface for various applications involving host–guest interactions. Compared with the amorphous counterpart, crystalline materials usually consist of inter-packed nanocrystals with regular/irregular morphology, and possess exposed active facets and reaction interfaces, long-range translational order and directional arrangement.263,280,281 Thus, more and more researchers pursue high-quality MMBMs with highly crystallized architectures, and the existing methods to improve crystallinity include annealing at high temperatures, assisted induction of crystallization and pre-crystalline assembly. In general, calcination treatment is the most useful method to improve the crystallinity of MMBMs; however, high temperature annealing can easily reduce the long-range order degree of the mesostructure, lead to low surface area and even cause serious structure collapse. Traditional ionic organic Pluronic ABCs are difficult to be implemented in the synthesis of MMBMs with crystalline walls, which is attributed to their features of low glass transition temperature (Tg) and low decomposition temperature. These features are good for the convenient synthesis of amorphous mesoporous materials like silica and carbon, and they failed to provide a supporting effect for the formation of mesostructured MMBMs during annealing and high temperature calcination. Therefore, commercial ABCs, such as F127 and P123, mainly lead to MMBMs with poor crystallinity.8,183,202,272 In order to obtain a highly crystalline framework without structure collapse, a quick annealing treatment in an oxygen atmosphere can be used to remove surfactants and accelerate the crystallization process. The strategy of repeating thermal treatment can also be used as an efficient strategy to enhance the crystallinity of MMBMs.263 In recent years, ABCs with high Tg, high carbon content, and larger molecular weight have been employed as efficient templates to synthesize MMBMs with high crystallinity. Most of these ABCs have hydrophobic segments with sp2-hybridized-carbon and high Tg, which can be in situ converted into carbon residuals in mesopores to support the crystalline framework without structure collapse.52,55,131,180 As an extension of the template-derived residual carbon strategy, resol as an additive component for coassembly has been used to generate residual carbon for supporting the crystallization of MMBMs. Luo et al.131 reported large-pore mesoporous niobia spheres via the typical EICA method based on lab-made PEO-b-PS and resol, where the introduced resol with sp2-hybridized-carbon as the extra carbon source could be converted into carbon to support the crystalline frameworks even below 550 °C in N2. This indicates that amorphous carbon plays an important role in supporting the crystalline architectures under annealing at high temperatures.
In addition to annealing temperature, auxiliary additive can also play a similar role in controlling the crystallinity within a certain range. Some inorganic salts (e.g., NaCl, KCl and CaCO3) can induce the crystallization of MMBMs and “modify” the initial crystallization temperature. In2O3 as an attractive n-type semiconductor has aroused great interest in various fields owing to its low resistivity and wide band gap,178,282 but it is difficult to obtain mesoporous In2O3via the EICA method, because of its low crystallization temperature (300–400 °C) which is lower than the starting decomposition temperature of amphiphilic block copolymers. Ren et al.177 successfully designed ordered mesoporous In2O3 with crystalline walls based on amphiphilic block copolymer PEO114-b-PS187via the CaO2-assisted calcination strategy, where the introduced CaO2 could accelerate the decomposition of the surfactant through the burst release of oxygen and induce crystallization of the amorphous In2O3 framework. In fact, the CaO2 additives during calcination can also be regarded as extra support to protect the crystalline walls from collapse. In addition, using pre-crystalline nanoparticles or nanocrystals as precursors the synthesis of MMBMs with high crystallinity can also be realized, and these pre-crystalline nanoparticles have high crystallinity even without extra thermal-treatment.135,136,225 Based on the pre-crystalline feature, the derived MMBMs inherit a highly crystalline feature and the removal of surfactants via direct calcination in air can prevent the collapse of the mesostructure.


4.1.3 Crystal structure of MMBMs. 
The chemical activity of MMBMs is largely dependent on the crystal structure, including crystal forms (i.e., single crystals, polycrystalline and mixed crystals),98,103,202,231,283,284 crystal phases (i.e., α-, β-, γ-, and ε-)20,193,285 and exposed crystal facets (i.e., {001} and {110} for TiO2, {110}, {100} and {101} for SnO2).103,264,286 In terms of crystal forms, most of the MMBMs templated from ABCs are polycrystalline or mixed crystals (such as meso-crystalline) with abundant surface defects and crystal boundary. Generally speaking, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) can be regarded as the most effective and direct tool to confirm the crystal forms, and typical spotted diffraction rings can imply a polycrystalline structure, when these lattice rings with definite orientation can be considered as a single crystal.202,231,287 For example, Wu and co-workers288 designed P123-templated mesoporous titania films through the soft-template method, and the as-prepared mesoporous titania films had a 3D hexagonal structure with an ordered “ABAB” stacking of mesopores. SAED patterns and cross-sectional high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveal the polycrystalline structure consisting of ultra-small anatase nanocrystallites (ca. 2–13 nm). In reality, the traditional polycrystalline structure can exhibit colorful features and even a certain orientation. Brezesinski et al.280 used ABC “KLE” as the soft template to design mesoporous WO3 with a polycrystalline structure, and the crystalline-film framework was composed of phase-pure monoclinic WO3 nanocrystals, where these nanocrystals could randomly orient with respect to the pore walls. In comparison, single-crystal MMBMs are more attractive in various applications based on their perfect crystal array and internal structure, but it is relatively difficult to synthesize them through the ABC templating approach.
Despite the challenge, some research groups achieved single-crystal MMBMs in some cases.276,281,289,290 Typically, Brezesinski et al.291 synthesized mesoporous CeO2/TiO2 films with a single-crystal structure using KLE copolymer templates via the EICA method, and the as-prepared mesoporous CeO2/TiO2 films have ultra-high thermal stability and a fcc mesoporous structure and lattice with oriented mesopores and a quasi-“single-crystalline” pore wall. Besides, MMBMs with the pore wall made of mixed crystals have also been reported, which exhibited features between single-crystals and polycrystalline, and were named as meso-crystalline structures. Meso-crystallinity has been proposed over 10 years, which can be traced back to the report by Cölfen and Antonietti in 2005,292 which described the inorganic superstructures prepared from highly parallel crystallization and controlled alignment. Many reports indicated that the meso-crystalline structure exhibited great potential in catalysis, sensing and energy fields owing to its novel oriented mesostructure and magical electronic conductivity. Zhao's group90,105,126,293 first explored the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 with various crystal forms such as single-crystal, polycrystalline and even meso-crystalline features. They adopted a novel solvent evaporation driven oriented assembly strategy to grow olive-shaped mesoporous TiO2 mesocrystals (denoted as FDU-19), and the single FDU-19 mesocrystal exhibited identical elongated single-crystal-like diffraction spots based on the same crystallographic orientation. The slightly elongated diffraction spots imply the dislocations and some lattice mismatches at crystal grain boundaries within FDU-19. Interestingly, after annealing treatment in air at 400 °C, the above FDU-19 can be converted into structure-defect-free mesoporous anatase single-crystals. Similarly, triblock copolymer PEO–PPO–PEO can also be regarded as a magical template to design oriented mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with single-crystal-like anatase walls (Fig. 23). Single-crystalline MMBMs hold promise in exhibiting better application performance than other forms of crystals. However, the carrier mobility of single-crystals is not sensitive to the grain boundaries but strongly relies on the crystal lattice. Once the grain boundaries produce considerable limitation on the mobility of carriers, much smaller Hall mobilities can arise in the polycrystalline material than in the single crystals.

Metal oxides can exist in the form of various crystal phases, and these crystal phases can exhibit distinct stability and chemical activity. For example, Fe2O3 as an industrial catalyst has various crystal phases owing to its intricate crystallization behavior, including α-Fe2O3, β-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, δ-Fe2O3, η-Fe2O3 and ε-Fe2O3.283,294–296 However, it is difficult to obtain the above crystal phases in the form of mesoporous materials via soft-templating synthesis using the ABC template, due to the poor stability of the metastable structure at high annealing temperature. The common crystal phases are mesoporous Fe2O3, α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3. In this regard, Smarsly's group studied in detail the crystalline features of mesoporous Fe2O3-family materials,108,121,237,280,281,284,287,291,297,298 and used poly(isobutylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PIB–PEO) or KLE copolymers as templates, and designed crack-free mesoporous α-Fe2O3 films through the EICA method. The mesoporous α-Fe2O3 was formed by typical crystal-to-crystal phase transitions from goethite (α-FeOOH) to hematite (α-Fe2O3). The as-prepared mesoporous α-Fe2O3 can be converted into Fe3O4 spinel by the reduction reaction and further converted into γ-Fe2O3 by oxidation. Furthermore, the exposed active crystal facets of MMBMs can have a significant influence in various applications, especially for catalysis and gas sensing. In general, dissimilar facets or surfaces usually possess various geometric and electronic structures which can generate brand new performance. For example, the exposed active crystal facets can have a great influence on the efficient reaction activity in energy storage and conversion.264,286,299 Zheng et al.103 designed a series of mesoporous single-crystal TiO2 materials with dominant {001} facets based on a simple silica-templated hydrothermal method, and it was found that the {110} facets of rutile mesoporous TiO2 could be regarded as reductive sites with a key role in the photo-reduction, while the {001} facets of anatase mesoporous TiO2 possess great promise for building energy conversion devices. While designing MMBMs with specific exposed crystal facets still remains a great challenge for surfactant-assembly chemistry, Liu et al.293 designed single-crystal-like walls of TiO2 microspheres with exposed dominant {101} facets using F127 as a template via novel evaporation-driven oriented growth, and they showed excellent potential in photoelectric conversion. In short, designing novel mesoporous materials with excellent crystal structure features can optimize the macroscopic properties in various applications.

4.2 Application of MMBMs in catalysis
After decades of development, MMBMs have been widely applied as catalysts in various catalytic reactions, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, asymmetric catalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.106,187,255,300 Various factors can influence the catalytic performance of MMBMs, such as composition, morphology, pore size, surface area, crystallinity and exposed crystal facets. Among them, the composition of catalysts is usually considered as the key factor that influences the catalytic properties, and the most effective method for tuning their performance is element doping using either non-metal elements (e.g., C, N, I, Si, P and S) or metal elements (e.g., Ni, Fe, Co, Sn and Ce). The introduced hetero-atoms can incorporate into the lattice or substitute atoms in the lattice, which can cause local atomic rearrangement and produce abundant internal defects, resulting in superior catalytic activity.40,124,235,301,302 Owing to the flexibility of soft template synthesis, the in situ element-doping during the assembly process has little influence on the formation of the mesoporous structure. For example, the doped N atoms usually locate at the interstitial sites in TiO2 and form narrow band gaps, which can remarkably increase the electronic conductivity, oxygen adsorption capability and conductivity of mesoporous TiO2, giving rise to N-doped mesoporous TiO2 with superior photocatalytic performance.124 Construction of mesoporous metal alloys is also a highly effective way to create catalytically active materials, combining the advantages of two or more metals.187,229,230 Fang et al. reported the synthesis of 3D mesoporous Au–Ag networks, and the obtained materials exhibited outstanding catalytic activities in an electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (Fig. 24), which is significantly better than pure mesoporous metals, including 3D mesoporous Au, Ag nanowires, Pt networks and Au nanoparticle superlattices.22 The novel mesoporous structure possesses high catalytic stability without apparent structural collapse. The superior performance is attributed to the high density of the low coordinated atoms, the high-index facets and atomic steps on the curved surface. In addition, in order to achieve a synergistic catalysis effect, much efforts have been focused on designing mesoporous metal-based composite catalysts by integrating MMBMs with inorganic carrier materials, such as graphene-family materials and g-C3N4. These composites can exhibit enhanced electrical conductivity and higher activity.38,106,191,241,262 Typically, Liu and co-workers241 designed a series of 2D layered mesoporous mono- and binary transition metal nitride/graphene, including mono-CrN/G, TiN/G, WN/G, Mo2N/G and TiCrN/G, TiWN/G, and TiMoN/G, and these composites were found to show much better electrocatalytic properties than pure single-component based materials.

Owing to the abundant porosity and adjustable pore structure, MMBMs can not only function as the active component in catalysis but also serve as an ideal catalyst support for noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt, Au, Pd, Rh, and Ag) and ultrafine active metal oxide nanocrystals (e.g., CuO, MnO2, Cr2O3, and CaO).128,236,267,285,303–310 The common mesoporous metal-based catalyst supports mainly consist of titania, ceria and alumina, where most of the noble metal nanoparticles can interact with these mesoporous catalyst supports via the well-known strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) (Fig. 25), and active metal oxide nanoparticles can interact with MMBM supports through strong metal oxide support interaction (SMOSI). These loaded or incorporated guest nanoparticles can provide extra reactive sites and form oxygen vacancies, especially the surface synergistic oxygen vacancies (SSOV) between metal ion (I) and metal ion (II). For instance, Jin et al.128 synthesized a series of highly ordered mesoporous metal oxides including CeO2, Co3O4, Mn2O3, SnO2 and TiO2, and highly active Pd nanoparticles could be highly dispersed on the surface of these mesoporous metal oxides. Interestingly, the obtained composites exhibited excellent low-temperature CO oxidation performance, and the mesoporous Pd/CeO2 showed the highest catalytic activity after H2 reduction attributed to the stronger SMSI interaction and formed abundant oxygen vacancies. Traditional element doping can mainly enhance the internal defects and adjust the band gap of MMBMs which is usually efficient for photocatalysis. The loading or incorporation of guest active nanoparticles not only provides new catalytic sites, but also generates abundant oxygen vacancies for reactions in applications such as electrocatalysis. Hence, it is of great importance to explore methods or strategies for rational tuning of the composition via element doping, interface interaction between guest nanoparticles and the supporting matrix and microstructure of MMBMs to improve their catalysis performance.

4.3 Application of MMBMs in gas sensing
With the advent of internet-connected automation and internet of things (IoT), chemiresistive gas sensing has been developed as one of the most effective methods for the real-time detection and monitoring of toxic gases, explosive compounds, and even volatile compounds in patients’ breath, and therefore, gas sensors can find wide applications in industrial production, industry, food safety and environmental security, public health and military field. MMBMs, especially for low-resistance transition metal oxides, have been designed as outstanding sensing materials to detect harmful environmental gases or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) owing to their unique semiconducting properties. In general, chemiresistance metal oxide semiconductors can be divided into two major categories according to various sensing mechanisms: n-type (e.g., ZnO, WO3, In2O3, SnO2 and Fe2O3) and p-type (e.g., NiO, CuO, Cr2O3, Mn3O4 and Co3O4).52,70,88,99,129,311 The fundamental difference between n-type and p-type semiconductors is with respect to the current carrier and resistance variation. The current carrier for the former is electrons (e−) and their resistance can decrease upon contacting reducing gases (e.g., H2, CO, CH4, acetone and ethanol), while it can increase under oxidizing gases (e.g., NOx, Cl2 and SO2). The current carrier for p-type semiconductors is holes (h+) and the resistance variation is opposite to n-type materials based on the depletion layer theory. The sensing mechanism for both n-type and p-type is strongly dependent on surface adsorbed oxygen species (i.e., O2−, O− and O2−).81,94,312,313 The main evaluation parameters for gas sensing performance include sensitivity, response–recovery time, selectivity, operating temperature, and stability. Compared with conventional non-porous oxide powders, mesoporous metal oxide semiconductors can significantly enhance the gas sensing performance based on their highly accessible porosity, high surface area and huge gas–solid interaction interfaces with high-density active sites. In addition, similar to surface catalysis, the gas sensing performance is also strongly dependent on the pore structure, such as surface area, pore size, pore volume, crystallinity and thickness of walls. Thus, it is extremely important to develop an effective approach to design MMBMs with crystalline features, rationally designed composition and high porosity for use as sensing materials for fabrication of high-performance gas sensors.
By using commercial Pluronic surfactants or lab-made ABCs (PEO-b-PS and PS-b-P4VP) as structure-directing agents, we have synthesized various mesoporous metal oxides and their composites for gas sensing applications, such as In2O3,177,282 WO3,53,70,130 Pt-doped WO3,95 CoOx,81,314 ZnO/Co3O4,311 WO3/NiO,94 ZrO2,315 Fe2O3,316 Pd-doped In2O3,178 SnO2,127 NiO,317 ZnO99,313,318 and N-doped TiO2.88 Additionally, amorphous components, such as silica, can be introduced in the metal oxide nanostructure to enhance the gas sensing performance based on its unique surface area (Fig. 26). It can maintain structural stability and high activity even during long cycle testing. For most of mesoporous metal-based semiconductors, the pore feature plays an important role in adjusting the gas sensing performance. As shown in Table 2, various mesoporous metal-based materials can exhibit great differences with respect to target gases and response sensitivity, where ethanol and acetone can be regarded as the common gases during sensing measurement.319–349 In general, large surface area can provide a high density of active surface sites for plentiful surface reactions between test gases and adsorbed oxygen species. Our group designed a series of mesoporous WO3 with various surface areas based on ABCs, and it was found that the as-prepared WO3 with larger surface area showed a rapid response, superior sensitivity and highly selective detection of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone.70 In addition, crystallinity and crystal structure can also affect the gas sensing activity based on various surface oxygen adsorption capacities. Typically, Zheng et al.319 synthesized mesoporous single crystals (e.g., SnO2, CeO2 and TiO2) and mesoporous mesocrystals (e.g., CeO2 and ZrO2), and mesoporous SnO2 single crystals exhibited excellent ethanol sensing performance than other SnO2-based sensors (e.g., mesoporous polycrystalline SnO2 and non-porous SnO2). The excellent sensing activity of the single-crystal framework is attributed to its enhanced gas diffusion and mass transportation as well as improved active surface and electron transfer. Furthermore, noble metals (e.g., Au, Pt, Ag and Pd) can be incorporated into the mesoporous metal oxide framework to enhance their gas sensing performance via either the physical or chemical sensitization effect. The sensing process is dependent on electrical conductivity and the interfacial effect, such as the Schottky barrier and heterogeneous interface (e.g., p–n, n–n, n–p–n, etc.). Among these heterojunction structures, the p–n junction is the most effective and common interface, where the high-energy electrons can easily transfer through the surface oxide layer at the interface to the unoccupied lower energy state to equalize the Fermi energy and generate a “band bending”. The resultant energy transition can vary flexibly the energy structure of the p-side and/or n-side, which can provide superior sensing performance based on the interfacial effect and synergistic effect.94,311 Zhang et al.311 synthesized mesoporous ZnO/Co3O4 microspheres which showed five times higher sensing response than pure ZnO gas sensors due to the extended electron depletion layer via the p–n heterojunctions. As displayed in Fig. 27, the abundant surface defects and hetero-structure can accelerate the electron transfer and the adsorption of surface oxygen species. Thus it can be seen that the key factor to enhance sensing performance is the unique electronic structure and interfacial effect benefit from element-doping or heterojunction structure, and thus in order to obtain higher sensing activity for pure MMBMs, essential surface modification will be a research focus, including doping, heterojunctions and even dual mesoporous structures.

4.4 Other applications
Besides catalysis and gas sensing, MMBMs have also inspired prominent research interest in adsorption, drug delivery, energy storage and conversion, etc. By changing the composition and microstructure, MMBMs with new features and functions can find many applications with outstanding performances as compared with traditional mesoporous non-metal materials, such as mesoporous silica and mesoporous carbon.
Owing to their large surface area and strong coordination ability, MMBMs can be considered as outstanding adsorbents for heavy ions, organic dyes and even common gases, such as CO2, H2, CH4 and O2.21,57,202,250 For example, Ma et al.114 synthesized periodic mesoporous titanium phosphonate materials with abundant bridged-organic groups based on the commercial Brij 56 template, and showed multifunctional features displaying not only excellent organic dye degradation capacity (ca. 68.4%) but also selective adsorption of Cu2+ (3.21 μmol g−1) over Cd2+ (2.10 μmol g−1) and Pd2+ (2.05 μmol g−1). This implied that the large organic motif containing numerous ethylene diamine bridging groups has a strong contribution to selective adsorption of Cu2+ based on innate selective affinity and high complexation ability. In addition, the high specific surface area of the as-prepared adsorbent (ca. 1066 m2 g−1) played an important role in dye adsorption and degradation owing to ample surface reaction sites. Li and co-workers19 designed an ordered macro-mesoporous metal–organic framework with a hierarchical structure based on the PS microsphere and P123 surfactant. It showed high CO2 adsorption capacity (ca. 49.51 cm3 g−1), which was attributed to the large surface area (592 m2 g−1) and high activity for chemical fixation of CO2 (yield of 77%).
Controlled drug-delivery systems (DDSs) have developed into a flexible treatment means via the availability rate and period of drug delivery in target cells (i.e., oral, nasal, skin, liver or pulmonary), and the drug carrier is the key component for DDS application. As everyone knows, mesoporous silica-based materials (e.g., MCM-41 or nanoparticles) have been regarded as an ideal drug carrier for DDSs owing to their ordered pore network that can control the drug load and release kinetics, high volume that can determine the amount of pharmaceuticals, large surface area for drug adsorption and the silanol-containing surface.30,31,350 With the rapid development of MMBMs, especially mesoporous metal–organic frameworks, these materials have exhibited an attractive ability in drug delivery and even better performance than traditional mesoporous silica in terms of drug loading capacity and release kinetics. Many reports have shown that MMBMs (e.g., TiO2 and MOFs) can be applied as an efficient drug delivery system to selectively release drugs based on their versatile pore feature and unique porosity.112,351,352 In general, to achieve an optimal drug delivery effect, surface functionalization with small organic or inorganic molecules, such as carboxylate ligands and phosphonate, is usually adopted to enhance the surface adsorption, affinity and biocompatibility. Li et al.112 prepared mesoporous phosphonate–TiO2 nanoparticles capped with fluorescein labeled oligonucleotides, and they showed excellent drug (ibuprofen) loading capacity and controlled drug release.
Various nanostructured materials have been studied in the field of energy storage and conversion.26 MMBMs as a family of highly porous materials have been considered as the most promising energy conversion materials in various systems, including solar cells (perovskite solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells and solar fuel production),104,107,111,197 rechargeable batteries (lithium–sulfur batteries, lithium-ion batteries and lithium–air batteries),7,58,105,194,353–355 fuel cells272 and supercapacitors (electrochemical double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors),139,196,231,295,356–358 owing to their exceptional properties, such as ultrahigh surface area (providing abundant reaction sites), large pore volume (enhancing the loading of guest molecules), adjustable pore structure (facilitating mass transport and diffusion) and superior metal activity. For example, Docampo et al.107 designed bicontinuous mesoporous TiO2 films via the coassembly strategy based on triblock terpolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide). It was found that the as-prepared TiO2 could be used as a highly porous photoanode with distinct advantages over the state-of-the-art nanoparticle-based photoanodes employed in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. Considering the versatile coassembly methods based on the flexible ABCs, various innovative MMBMs are expected to be created to exhibit improved performances in nanoscience and nanotechnology in the future.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
The state-of-the-art interface assemblies between tailor made organic ABCs and inorganic framework precursors (i.e., metal salts, nanoparticles or nanoclusters and POMs) for the design of various MMBMs and their potential applications (e.g., catalysis, gas sensing, environmental remediation and energy conversion) have been overviewed. Advanced progress in assembly methods and strategies for MMBMs have been explored, including: (i) interaction of inorganic metal salts with ABCs at the solid–liquid interface via hydrogen bonds, van der Waals force, coordination and electrostatic interaction, and the influence of interface assembly condition has been discussed and compared, such as type of polar solvents, ratio of the template and precursor, and post treatment conditions. In addition, typical assembly strategies, including EICA, EIAA, ligand-assisted coassembly, soft–hard (CASH) chemistries and carbon-supported crystallization, have been discussed in detail. (ii) The interaction between ultra-small nanoparticles as building units and ABCs via hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interaction has been discussed in detail, where surface ligands as a “bridge” play an essential role in inducing assembly. It is found that in situ tailoring of the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles (e.g., size, shape, crystallinity, composition and hydrophilicity) in the synthesis process provides a flexible and convenient route to create new functions for the target MMBMs, especially for multicomponent materials and heterojunction materials. (iii) POMs can be regarded as brand-new building blocks to interact with ABCs to form multifunctional MMBMs, and POMs of Keggin-type have exhibited extensive potential in catalysis, gas sensing, energy storage and host–guest chemistry based on their hydrophilic surface, high electron conductivity and unique composition. Benefiting from their unique features of POMs consisting of non-metals (e.g., P and Si) and multiple metals (e.g., W, V and Mo), POMs can be used to synthesize MMBMs with an in situ doped or co-doped framework. Furthermore, the review provides a comprehensive discussion about the surface properties/microstructures and the potential application of MMBMs. Importantly, the review introduces critical comment of the recent assembly/synthesis strategies, adjustment of surface properties, the assembly mechanism and structure–function relationship in various applications, especially for catalysis and gas sensing.
Based on this review, several important points can be expected for future research avenues on supramolecular template directed MMBMs with different functions. (i) The assembly behaviour between amphiphilic block copolymers and metal precursors is dependent on interface/surface energy and the assembly environment. It is of great importance to further develop novel assembly methods and strategies to enhance the interaction and affinity between ABCs and metal precursors, and explore multicomponent MMBMs with programmed heterojunctions and tailor-made inorganic–organic (e.g., oxide–oxides, oxide–metal, alloy interface, and crystalline–amorphous) interfaces. (ii) Considering that the pore structure, including pore size, pore volume, crystallinity, thickness of the pore wall and pore symmetry, is determined by the chain length, type, and volume ratio of hydrophilic segments and hydrophobic segments, exploiting multifunctional, multi-block and novel ABCs holds great promise in creating high-quality MMBMs. The brand new assembly mechanism will come out based on advanced spectrum technology and in situ electron microscopy. (iii) Because many application performances can be enhanced by surface/interface properties and the microstructure of host mesoporous materials, such as compositions, surface area, exposed facets, porosity, internal defects, band gap, morphology, oxygen vacancies and crystal structure, multicomponent assembly and in situ doping with noble metals (e.g., Pt, Au, Ag, Pd, and Rh) and non-metals (e.g., C, N, Si, S, and P) or traditional metals (e.g., Ni, Zr, Ce, Fe, and Cr) are promising methods for the controllable design and precise regulation of universal MMBMs. (iv) Semiconductors as electron-conducting functional materials are usually limited by their conductivity and surface activity, while heterogeneous structure (e.g., p–n, n–n, n–p–n, etc.) can provide synergistic effect and high crystal surface activity, which is the most efficient and flexible strategy to boost the development of MMBMs through the decrease of steric hindrance and the transition distance of electrons/holes. It is believed that the future research concerns will specially focus on multi-component co-assembly and the heterogeneous interfacial structure–activity relationship for mesoporous metal-based materials. Particularly, the development of new MMBMs based on amphiphilic block copolymers is beneficial for their application in various fields such as catalysis, environmental protection, and energy conversion and storage. The coassembly will attract great attention and bring new vitality in the community of Chemistry, Materials Sciences, Energy, Physics, etc.
