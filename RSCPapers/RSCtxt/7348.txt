    , Accepted 27th February 2023First published on 9th March 2023AbstractPhotothermal nanomaterials have shown great potential for photothermal therapy. In this study, we developed a simple green method of magnesiothermic co-reduction for the synthesis of mesoporous, magnetic and biodegradable iron silicide nanoparticles (FeSi NPs) as applied to photothermal therapy (PTT). Starting from biogenic tabasheer extracted from bamboo and Fe2O3, the resultant FeSi NPs with a much lower band gap exhibited excellent optical absorption with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 76.2%, indicating a good photothermal performance. The weight extinction coefficient was measured to be 13.3 L g−1 cm−1 at 1064 nm (second near-infrared window, NIR-II), which surpassed the performance of other competitive Si-based and Fe-based photothermal agents. Results of the cell viability assay showed that cells could be killed by NIR-II laser irradiation with the synthesized FeSi NPs. In vivo results on mice showed clearly an efficient suppression of tumour growth by photothermal treatment with FeSi NPs. FeSi NPs were found to be biodegradable in simulated body fluids. The results from our work indicate that FeSi NPs are a new class of promising photothermal agents (PTAs) for application in cancer therapy.
1. Introduction
Photothermal therapy has attracted considerable attention in cancer treatment due to its nature of physical treatment for many types of cancers with few side effects.1–3 During the past 20 years, many photothermal agents4–6 have been developed for photothermal cancer treatment. However, the photothermal agents reported to date suffer from several limitations, such as low efficiency in delivering with the help of only enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, poor photothermal performance, nonbiodegradable nature, and/or unclear long-term biological side effects, which limit their clinical use.7,8 Among the photothermal agents, semiconductors9–11 have attracted a considerable attention due to their relatively low cost, good photothermal performance and biocompatibility, and become the choice of materials. Si-based materials have been investigated for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, biosensing, and photoluminescence due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, rich abundance and unique electronic and optical properties. Therefore, several silicon-based nanomaterials, such as porous silicon (pSi),12–16 black silicon,17 silicon oxide,18 silicon quantum dots,19 silicon nanosheets20 and silicene,21 have been investigated for photothermal therapy. Porous silicon nanoparticles have been shown to be readily degraded into water-soluble orthosilicic acid (Si(OH)4) and eliminated from the body in one week.22 Fe-based materials have also been extensively investigated for biomedical applications, such as MRI imaging,23,24 magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic targeting,25,26 due to their unique magnetic properties, rich abundance27 and benign nature. Many Fe-based photothermal agents, such as iron oxide,28–31 iron sulfide,32–34 FeSe2,35 Fe5C236 and Fe3+,37 have also been reported for photothermal therapy. Iron oxide nanoparticles have been found to release Fe ions into the blood during metabolic processes.38 Based on the knowledge above, iron silicides are hypothesized to be bio-harmless as they are composed of no toxic elements and are an abundant resource on the Earth's crust.39,40 As shown in Fig. S1 of ESI‡, several phases exist in the Fe–Si phase diagram,41 such as Fe2Si, Fe5Si3, FeSi and FeSi2. Among them, ε-FeSi is known to have a narrow band gap (0.13 eV).42,43 A narrow band gap means that more light can be efficiently absorbed, more free carriers are generated, more non-radiative recombination occurs, and finally more heat is emitted. With these characteristics, we hypothesize ε-FeSi to be an excellent photothermal material for cancer photothermal therapy. To the best of our knowledge, ε-FeSi has not been explored for photothermal therapy, which is the focus of the current study.
Until now, various methods such as chemical vapor deposition,44,45 magnetron sputtering,46 and molten-salt method47 have been developed to fabricate ε-FeSi phase in the form of membranes, nanowires (lengths from a few hundred nanometers to tens of micrometers) or small particles (∼1 μm). For photothermal therapy, the morphology and size of photothermal agents are critical properties. In this work, mesoporous ε-FeSi NPs were synthesized using a simple and green magnesiothermic co-reduction method from Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and biogenic tabasheer.48 The fabrication method is green, safe and easily scalable for quantity production. No toxic chemicals, such as HF solution, are used during the synthesis. Clearly, such mesoporous ε-FeSi NPs would be an ideal candidate for cancer therapy. In addition, the mesoporous structure of ε-FeSi NPs could potentially provide other additional functions such as drug delivery and chemotherapy.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China); tabasheer (biogenic silica, SiO2) was purchased from Bristol Botanicals (Bristol, UK); ethanol (C2H5OH) was purchased from Xilong (Shantou, China); magnesium powder (Mg) was purchased from Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China); potassium chloride (KCl) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China); hydrochloric acid (HCl) was purchased from Dongjiang (Dongguan, China); commercial FeSi particles were purchased from Jiuding Chemical (Shanghai, China) and used as a control for comparison.
2.2. Synthesis of porous Si (pSi), Fe and FeSi NPs
The pSi nanoparticles (pSi NPs) were synthesized using a green magnesiothermic reduction from tabasheer in a similar manner as used in the previous reports.49–51 Metallic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) were synthesized from Fe2O3, also using magnesiothermic reduction with NH4Cl solution washing. The synthesized pSi NPs and Fe NPs were used as comparative controls for evaluating photothermal performance. The porous FeSi NPs were synthesized from tabasheer and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O using green and low-cost magnesiothermic co-reduction method, with the fabrication process being shown in Fig. 1. In a typical synthesis, iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) was dissolved in ethanol, and tabasheer powder was then added to the resulting solution. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature for impregnation of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O into the pores of porous SiO2 during the evaporation process of ethanol. The mixture was heated to 400 °C in an oven to obtain a porous SiO2/Fe2O3 mixture by removing ethanol and bound water, followed by the decomposition of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O to Fe2O3. After grinding the solids, the resulting powders were mixed with Mg and KCl at a desired proportion, followed by magnesiothermic co-reduction in a tube furnace at 650 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 3 h at a heating ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. The product was washed with 1 M HCl solution under magnetic stirring for 5 h, washed again with water three times, and then dried in the oven to produce powders of FeSi NPs. After treatment with an ultrasonic homogenizer (JY92-IIN, Scientz), the narrowly-sized FeSi NPs were obtained by gradient centrifugation.

2.3. Surface modification of FeSi nanoparticles
A biocompatible polyethyleneimine (PEI) was utilized to modify FeSi NPs. FeSi NPs (1 mg) were dispersed in 1 mL deionized water and added at 1 drop/2 s speed to a stirring solution containing excess PEI (Mw = 25 000) dissolved in 5 mL DI water and left for spinning overnight at room temperature. Then, the mixture was sonicated for 2 min with a probe sonicator in an ice-water bath. The resultant product was subjected to centrifugation and washed multiple times with water to eliminate any residual excess PEI. The PEI-modified FeSi NPs were concentrated by centrifugation to prepare the stock solution.
2.4. Characterization techniques
An X-ray diffraction system (XRD, D8 Advance ECO) of Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54060 Å) was used to characterize the crystal structure and material phases of synthesized samples. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN MIRA3) was used to investigate the morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to obtain high-resolution images and information on crystal lattice and element composition by Talos F200X G2. Dynamic light scatterer (DLS, BI-200SM) was used to determine the hydrodynamic size distribution and polydispersity index (PDI) of particles in suspension. A ZetaPALS was used to obtain the zeta potential of the materials. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was used to obtain the IR reflectance spectra of materials on a Bruker Vertex 70v. Lambda 750s UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to obtain UV-vis-NIR spectra of nanoparticles. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, ASAP 2020 Plus) was used for quantitative analysis of specific surface area and porous structure, such as pore size distribution and pore volume. PPMS-14L (Quantum Design) was used to obtain the magnetization curve and saturation magnetization. ICP-MS (7700X) was used to obtain ion concentration of the solution. XPS (PHI 5000 VersaProbe III) was used to obtain surface elemental composition and chemical valence state.
2.5. 
          In vitro photothermal performance
To determine in vitro photothermal performance of synthesized NPs, 200 μL of NP aqueous suspensions at the same solid concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 was added to a cell culture dish. The sample was irradiated by a 1064 nm laser (1 W cm−2, 10 min), while an IR image camera (FLIR E6) was used to record the temperature during the irradiation. Temperature changes of FeSi NPs aqueous suspension containing different amounts of NPs (10 to 500 μg mL−1) under 1064 nm laser radiation of different power densities (0.4 to 1.2 W cm−2, 10 min) were also monitored. The photostability of NP suspensions was evaluated through five cycles of heating and cooling. The photothermal conversion efficiency of FeSi NPs was calculated using the data from the heating and cooling profiles.
2.6. Cell viability assay
4T1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 5000 cells per well and incubated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 24 h of cell adhesion. Various concentrations of FeSi NPs were added to the new culture medium for further incubation for 12 h before the cells were exposed to a 1064 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 power density irradiation for 10 min. After irradiation, the cells were further incubated for another 12 h for the light cytotoxicity study. On the other hand, cells were treated with FeSi NPs without laser irradiation for 24 h to test the cytotoxicity under dark conditions. After treatment, culture media was discarded and replaced by fresh media (100 μL of 10% CCK 8 solution) and incubated for another 2 h. The absorbance value at 450 nm was measured with a Tecan microplate reader. The cell viability was calculated by the ratio of the absorbance of the cells incubated with each sample to non-treated cells.
2.7. 
          In vivo photothermal therapy (PTT)
All animal operations were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Southern University of Science and Technology. Mice were obtained from the Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Centre. Mouse colonic epithelial 4T1 cells (2 × 106 cells, total volume 0.05 mL in 1× PBS buffer) were injected into mice (Female BALB/c nude mice, 4–6 weeks) legs subcutaneously to establish tumours. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (4 mice per group) for a photothermal therapy experiment when the volumes of the tumours were about 60 mm3 as calculated and measured by a calliper. Two groups of 4T1 (murine breast cancer cells) tumour-bearing mice were intratumorally (i.t.) injected with 20 μL of 2 mg mL−1 of FeSi NPs in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), equivalent to a dose of 1.78 mg kg−1. Another two groups of 4T1 tumour-bearing mice were intratumorally injected with the same amount of PBS solution (20 μL) for comparison. The FeSi-treated group and PBS-treated group were exposed to the 1064 nm laser at a laser power density of 1 W cm−2 for 15 min. The other two were not treated by laser for comparison. An infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera (FLIR E6) was used to monitor the temperature of tumours. The size of the tumour was recorded by a calliper every other day after treatment to calculate the tumour volume based on the approximate volume equation, V = (tumour length) × (tumour width)2/2. For easy comparison, the relative tumour volumes were calculated as V/V0 (V0 was the tumour volume measured at the beginning of the treatment). The body weight of each mouse was determined and recorded every other day until the sacrifice of the mice. All data are reported as the means ± standard deviations (SDs). The sections of the tumour were collected on the 14th day and stained with H&E for histological analysis.
2.8. 
          In vivo biocompatibility of FeSi NPs
4T1 tumour-bearing mice were intratumorally injected with FeSi NPs PBS suspensions and PBS only, followed with or without laser irradiation. On the 14th day after treatment, the organs (lung, liver, heart, spleen and kidney) were harvested from the sacrificed mice. Then, these organs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and embedded in paraffin for preparation of 5 μm thick sections, followed by an H&E study. Images were randomly taken from 200 locations in each section.
2.9. Biodegradation test of FeSi NPs
Degradation tests of FeSi NPs were carried out by incubating the particles in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 36.5 °C. Sample analysis is carried out in sextuplicate by adding 20 mL of SBF solution (0.5 mg mL−1) in 6 plastic bottles, and placing the 10 mg of specimens in the SBF solutions. The entire sample should be submerged in the SBF. The plastic bottles are kept in the incubator at 36.5 °C. There are sampling points on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7, day 14 and day 21. At each sampling point, the specimens are withdrawn and centrifuged to separate the NPs. 5 mL of supernatant is analyzed with the ICP-MS to determine the concentration of the dissolved Si.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization of FeSi NPs
Both Fe2O3 and SiO2 can be reduced by Mg based on the oxygen-potential diagram. The product of the reduction in the form of molten Fe and Si is anticipated to form a Fe–Si binary phase. In our experiments, high-quality FeSi NPs of uniform sizes and morphologies were synthesized from Fe2O3/SiO2 under Ar atmosphere using a simple magnesiothermic co-reduction method shown in Fig. 1. The bulks of tabasheer were first ground into white powders. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in ethanol, and a certain amount of tabasheer powders were added to the solution. After evaporation of ethanol and subsequent heating at 400 °C, a Fe2O3/SiO2 mixture was obtained. From the insets of Fig. 1, we can see that the colour of tabasheer powders changed from white to yellow when mixed with Fe2O3 and thermally treated at 400 °C. The magnesiothermic co-reduction and acid washing of the Fe2O3/SiO2 mixture resulted in a dark powder of FeSi NPs.
The XRD patterns in Fig. 2(a) confirmed the phases of the original amorphous SiO2, Fe2O3/SiO2 mixture, and final cubic FeSi (JCPDS card, no. 38-1397) of the final product. The space group of FeSi was identified as P213 with a = b = c = 4.488 Å. No other XRD peaks outside these phases were detected, indicating the high purity of the final product, with noisy baselines indicating incomplete crystallization. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 2(b) reveals the diameters of as-made FeSi NPs, mostly around 60 nm. Some larger particles may be the result of the aggregation of small particles.

The synthesized FeSi NPs were also found to be porous, which arises from the porous nature of precursor tabasheer (SiO2) and the removal of MgO as a by-product by acid washing using HCl solutions. The image taken by spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope (STEM) in Fig. 2(c) clearly shows the porous structure of FeSi NPs with a wide pore size distribution. Fig. S2a and b (ESI‡) also confirm the porous structure of the FeSi NPs. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of FeSi NPs in Fig. S2c (ESI‡) are of the IV isotherm type, indicating the presence of mesoporous structure in FeSi NPs. The BET surface area of FeSi NPs was determined to be 90 m2 g−1, and the pore volume was 0.21 cm3 g−1. The average pore diameter was estimated to be around 9.4 nm according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) fitting.
HRTEM image in Fig. 2(d) shows uniform lattice fringes across the whole particle, with the characteristic interplanar distances corresponding to cubic ε-FeSi (210). The EDX spectrum in Fig. 2(e) shows the relative content of Fe and Si with the atom percentage being 44.2% and 55.8%, respectively, with an atom ratio of Fe to Si close to 1 in FeSi NPs. Note that elements of C, O and Cu in the spectrum come from carbon-coated copper TEM grids. The chemical composition of the sample was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characteristic peaks of Si 2p and Fe 2p element in survey spectrum of Fig. 2f confirm the element composition of FeSi nanoparticles. The peak of C is ascribed to the carbon film used for sample loading during the test. XPS survey spectrum of the sample in Fig. 2(f) exhibits characteristic peaks of O, which could be attributed to the surface oxidation of FeSi NPs. This limited surface oxidation, however, does not cause substantial changes in the photothermal conversion efficiency but provides needed surface properties of dispersion for their targeted applications.
Surface modification of FeSi NPs by PEI was investigated to achieve better dispersity and stability. As compared with the XPS spectrum of FeSi NPs, the XPS spectrum of FeSi NPs in Fig. S3a (ESI‡) exhibited characteristic peaks of N arising from PEI, indicating successful surface modification of FeSi NPs by PEI. After surface modification, the average hydrodynamic diameter of FeSi NPs (Fig. 2(g)) measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in deionized H2O increased from 71.5 nm, which is similar to the size measured from SEM images, to 141.4 nm (Fig. 2(h)). This increase in hydrodynamic radius indicates the grafting of PEI on FeSi NPs. The successful modification of FeSi NPs by PEI was further confirmed by an increase in the zeta potential of FeSi NPs from −19.57 mV to 8.04 mV with the addition of PEI, as shown in Fig. 2(i). The modification of FeSi NPs by EPI led to a more stable suspension of FeSi@PEI NPs than that of FeSi NPs, as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI‡), by a quicker sedimentation just after ultrasonication as compared with FeSi@PEI NPs. The dispersion and stability properties of the FeSi@PEI NPs in the PBS solutions of different pH values were investigated. These suspensions exhibited similar sedimentation characteristics as shown by two groups of photographs in Fig. S4 of ESI‡ representing the time of just being treated (1st row) and 6 h after the treatment (2nd row) by ultrasonic cell crusher (pH from left to right: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3). The pH seems to have less effect on the dispersion and stability properties of the FeSi@PEI NPs in PBS solution.
In addition, the magnetic property of the sample was determined. The results in Fig. S5 of ESI‡ showed that the fabricated FeSi nanoparticles were paramagnetic with a saturation magnetization of 4.6 emu g−1 at room temperature.
3.2. Photothermal characteristics and in vitro performance of FeSi NPs
The photothermal conversion mechanism of semiconductors can be understood as follows. Electron jumps from the valence band to the conduction band after being irradiated by laser. The heat is generated during the non-radiative relaxation of free electrons and holes. For the laser of 1064 nm NIR-II wavelength, the ideal band gap of the materials to best absorb the light and convert its optical energy to heat should be below 1.17 eV as calculated. The penetration depth of such a laser could be as high as 10 cm. The Fourier transform infrared reflectance spectra in Fig. S6 (ESI‡) show an absorption threshold of 9.68 μm for our FeSi NPs, which corresponds to a band gap of 0.128 eV as calculated using Eg (eV) = hν. A similar value of 0.13 eV was reported in the literature.42,43 The results suggest that the laser irradiation of 1064 nm wavelength may be effectively absorbed by the FeSi NPs.
To confirm these theoretical calculations, the optical properties of FeSi NPs were determined. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the FeSi NPs exhibited a strong and broad absorption band in the NIR region. The open circles indicate the large fluctuation of the absorption spectrum at around 856 nm, which arises from the change of optical grating during the measurement. The results in the inset of Fig. 3(a) also show a linear dependence of the absorption on FeSi concentration. The extinction coefficient of FeSi suspension was determined from the slope of the linear plot to be 13.3 L g−1 cm−1 at 1064 nm, which is comparable to that of FeS (15.5 L g−1 cm−1)34 and black phosphorus quantum dots (14.8 L g−1 cm−1)52 and higher than that of graphdiyne (10.1 L g−1 cm−1),53 graphene oxide (5.94 L g−1 cm−1),54 Ta4C3 (4.06 L g−1 cm−1),55 and black phosphorus (2.1 L g−1 cm−1).56

All the measurements used 200 μL of FeSi NPs aqueous suspensions. 
As anticipated, the FeSi NPs synthesized in this study had desirable photothermal properties under 1064 nm NIR laser irradiation. At a given solid concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1, the FeSi NPs showed a much better photothermal performance than porous pSi and Fe NPs, both synthesized using magnesiothermic reduction method from their respective oxides, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Fig. 3(b) also shows a much better photothermal performance of FeSi than that of the physical mixture of Fe NPs and pSi NPs at the same Si–Fe ratio as in FeSi NPs. The aqueous suspension (200 μL) containing 0.5 mg mL−1 fabricated FeSi NPs under irradiation by a 1064 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 can be heated to 80 °C within 10 min. The superior photothermal performance of the FeSi NPs synthesized in this study is attributed to their much narrower band gap, low density, and large specific surface area of the mesoporous structure. It is interesting to note in Fig. 3(c) the increase in the heating rate and final temperature of FeSi NPs aqueous suspension with increasing the concentration of FeSi NPs, although nonlinear. A linear increase in heating rate and final temperature of FeSi NPs aqueous suspension with increasing the power of radiation laser is shown in the insert of Fig. 3(d), as anticipated. Such findings allow us to fine-tune the heating rate and final temperature as desired by changing either FeSi NPs concentration or applying different laser power in practical applications.
Photothermal conversion efficiency (η) can be calculated from the cooling profile using the method proposed by Roper and co-workers.57 The cooling profile of 200 μL FeSi NP aqueous suspensions (0.5 mg mL−1) irradiated by a 1064 nm laser at 1 W cm−2 and natural cooling with laser off at 10 min is shown in Fig. 3(e). The η value of FeSi NPs was calculated using equations given in ESI‡ with parameters derived from Fig. 3(e) to be approximately 76.2%. This value is much higher than the values for some current photothermal agents, such as SiO0.92 (48.6%),18 black phosphorus (36.8%),56 Bi2S3 (28.1%),58 black phosphorus quantum dots (24.8%)59 and Fe/Fe3O4 (20.3%).60 A much lower band gap and mesoporous structure (low density) of FeSi NPs give it high photothermal conversion efficiency. As shown in Table S1 (ESI‡), there are some materials with high photothermal conversion efficiency. Researchers choose different concentrations of materials, setups for photothermal performance, and testing parameters for the calculation of photothermal conversion efficiency for the convenience of the experiments, which makes a comparison of the results from different laboratories extremely difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, our photothermal material ranked quite favourably. More importantly, the nanoplatform in the present work possesses superior advantages in its biodegradable nature with a high photothermal conversion efficiency in NIR-II window and paramagnetic properties. Furthermore, the mesoporous structure and magnetic property could expand the application fields of the material to magnetic imaging, magnetically-driven target drug delivery, etc.
As an important factor for photothermal therapy, the photothermal stability of FeSi suspensions was also investigated. Temperature variations of 0.1 mg mL−1 FeSi NP aqueous suspensions were recorded over 5 cycles of heating at 1 W cm−2 and natural cooling. The results in Fig. 3(f) show a similar level of photothermal efficiency of FeSi NPs after five cycles of NIR laser-induced heating (1064 nm laser at 1 W cm−2, 10 min irradiation for each cycle) and natural cooling, demonstrating the excellent photothermal stability of FeSi NPs. The strong photothermal performance and excellent photostability of FeSi NPs make them an encouraging nano-agent for photothermal cancer therapy.
3.3. Degradation test of FeSi nanoparticles and in vitro cell test
The biodegradability of FeSi nanoparticles was investigated. The extent of degradation of FeSi NPs was calculated as the ratio of the final concentration of Si ion in the solution to the initial concentration of element Si. The results in Fig. 4(a) show a slow but progressive biodegradation of FeSi NPs in SBF. The extent of FeSi degradation is around 12% after a week and 15% after three weeks, which is a good sign for photothermal therapy.

From the promising photothermal efficiency and stability of FeSi NPs without any anticipated biohazard, a photothermal agent was tested for in vitro cell treatment with 4T1 cells. The results in Fig. 4(b) show concentration-dependent cell viability with laser irradiation. When the concentration of FeSi NPs was only 25 μg mL−1 with laser irradiation, 80% of the cells were killed. Under dark conditions without laser irradiation, no obvious cytotoxicity (>80% cell viability) was observed when FeSi NPs concentration as high as 25 μg mL−1 was applied, exhibiting good in vitro biocompatibility.
3.4. 
          In vivo photothermal therapy
The materials were also tested as a photothermal agent for in vivo cancer treatment. One group of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were i.t. injected at a dose of 1.78 mg kg−1 FeSi (20 μL of 2 mg mL−1). The mice were then exposed to a 1064 nm laser of 1 W cm−2 power density for 15 min. Tumor-bearing mice, i.t. injected with the same volume of PBS without FeSi NPs, were also exposed to the 1064 nm laser (1 W cm−2) as a control. An infrared (IR) thermal imaging camera was used to monitor the temperatures of tumors under laser irradiation. As shown in Fig. 4(c), when exposed to the laser at 1 W cm−2, the temperature of the tumor injected with FeSi reached ∼55 °C within 5 min, which is sufficiently high to kill tumor cells and inhibit their growth in vivo. The temperature of the tumor surface increased for both cases, as shown in Fig. 4(d), more so for the case with FeSi NPs. The observation that the body temperature of the FeSi NPs groups is higher than that of the PBS group is attributed to the photothermal effect of FeSi NPs with laser radiation. In contrast, the temperature of tumors without FeSi showed only a marginal increase in temperature under laser irradiation of the same intensity.
The efficiency of PTT with FeSi NPs to kill and prohibit tumors was estimated by measuring the size of the tumor. The mice bearing 4T1 tumors (volume ∼ 60 mm3) were randomly divided into four groups: (1) i.t. injection of 20 μL PBS, (2) i.t. injection of 20 μL PBS with laser irradiation, (3) i.t. injection of 20 μL FeSi NPs in PBS (dose of 1.78 mg kg−1) without laser irradiation, and (4) i.t. injection of 20 μL FeSi NPs in PBS (dose of 1.78 mg kg−1) with laser irradiation. The laser of 1064 nm at 1 W cm−2 was applied for 15 min whenever applicable. The tumors, after injection of FeSi followed by laser irradiation, were found to be eradicated without recurrence within 14 days, as shown in Fig. 4(e). It should be noted that higher temperatures, as observed in our test, could cause severe side effects of cell damage, such as eschar, although it showed effective suppression of cell growth. Therefore, it is extremely important to lower the concentration of agent or laser power density to reduce the local temperature of the tumour in real applications. The tumors of all other groups, in comparison, did not show any trend of growth inhibition. The changes in tumors can also be seen in Fig. 4(f), showing the eventual disappearance of the tumor after injection of FeSi NPs followed by laser irradiation. Fig. 5(a) shows a typical tumor growth profile by recording the relative volume of the tumor every two days after irradiation treatments. Superior tumor suppression two weeks after the irradiation treatment was observed in the group of FeSi NPs with laser radiation, owing to the effective photothermal effect. It is interesting to note insignificant change in the mouse body weights during the therapeutic course for all the groups, as shown in Fig. 5(b), suggesting a negligible toxicity and short-term side effect of the treatment. To compare the tumor obliteration effect, tumor sections were collected and processed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. From the H&E staining, Fig. 5(c) shows the most severe occurrence of necrosis in the FeSi NP + laser group among all groups. To ensure the low toxicity of FeSi NPs for in vivo application, the histology and morphology of major organs on day 14, including the lung, liver, heart, spleen and kidney, were visually inspected. As shown in Fig. 5(d), there is no abnormal cell damage or tissue inflammation in the organ tissues as compared with the control group. As a result, FeSi NPs have shown good biocompatibility, which is safe for organisms. In summary, our results demonstrate excellent in vivo cancer therapy of PTT mediated by FeSi NPs.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a novel kind of FeSi NPs, as a new class of transition-metal silicide photothermal agents, were fabricated using the green chemistry method of magnesiothermic co-reduction from biogenic tabasheer for photothermal therapy. The low band gap of 0.128 eV of the synthesized FeSi NPs helped enhance the optical absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency. The materials showed a good optical absorption with a mass extinction coefficient of 13.3 L g−1 cm−1 at 1064 nm, which compared favourably with many other Si-based and Fe-based photothermal agents. The photothermal conversion efficiency was measured to be 76.2%, which is higher than the values of many existing photothermal agents. In vitro cell tests and in vivo animal tests showed effective photothermal treatment in killing the tumour cells and prohibiting tumour growth. Our work suggests that FeSi NPs are likely to be a new class of photothermal agents for the NIR-II tissue window, thereby highly promising in cancer therapy. The mesoporous structure can help achieve drug delivery and chemotherapy. The magnetic and biodegradable FeSi NPs may be used for targeting function and MRI contrast agent. The findings provide new insights towards understanding the role of transition-metal silicides based on the photothermal conversion in photothermal therapy and other potential applications such as multifunctional therapy, photothermal membranes, photothermal catalysis, and desalination.
