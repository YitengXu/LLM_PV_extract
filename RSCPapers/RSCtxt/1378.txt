Here, InN nanoplates are prepared by using In2O3, NaNH2 and sulfur as starting materials in a stainless steel autoclave at 190 °C. This method has the advantages of requiring a low temperature and without using an ammonia flow. Field-emission scanning electron microscope shows that the length of InN nanoplates is about 400 nm with the thickness of 50 nm. Finally, the formation mechanism is also investigated.
In the past decades, group III nitrides have drawn much attention for their potential applications in optoelectronic devices as well as in high power and high temperature applications.1–3 As one of group III nitrides, indium nitride (InN) has received considerable attention, since its band gap has been found to be about 0.7 eV (much lower than the previously believed value of 1.9 eV).4,5 Consequently, the InN materials have possible application in high efficiency solar cells, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes.6,7 Up to now, nanostructured InN with varied morphologies, for instance, nanoparticles,8,9 nanorods,10 nanowires,11–16 nanotubes,13,15 nanonecklaces,16 fibers,17 microtubes,18 and nanobelts19 have been prepared and investigated.
Compared with the other group III nitrides (AlN and GaN), the preparation of InN is the more difficult for its poor thermal stability, decomposing with releases of N2 at low temperatures (427–550 °C).20 Therefore, more and more efforts are made to develop novel synthetic routes of the InN nanomaterials. So far, InN materials have been prepared by various methods, such as organometallic precursor route,17 pyrolysis of In(NH2)3,21 high-pressure synthesis,22 high-temperature ammonolysis,11 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),12,13 molecular beam epitaxy,23 reactive magnetron sputtering,24 vapour phase epitaxy (VPE)10 and solvothermal reactions,25,26 and other methods.27,28 However, most of the above mentioned synthesis methods require critical reaction conditions, which influence the large-scale application. Recently, Miura et al. synthesized high crystalline InN in an autoclave. The process involves two steps reaction: preparation of LiInO2 by a solid state reaction between Li2CO3 and In2O3 at 750 °C and nitridation of LiInO2 at 240 °C.29 Nitride (BN, AlN, TiN and ZrN) can be synthesized by additive-assisted approach.30
In the present work, a sulfur-assisted one-pot chemical route is developed for the synthesis of wurtzite InN nanoplates in an autoclave at 190 °C. To the best of our knowledge, InN nanoplates have been prepared for the first time from indium oxide. The starting materials used in the synthesis process are commercially available, relatively inexpensive and easily handled. In addition, the formation mechanism is also investigated.
X-ray diffraction is used to examine the crystal structure of the obtained sample. Fig. 1 shows a typical XRD pattern of the obtained sample. All the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern can be indexed to be a pure hexagonal phase InN with high crystallinity. The refined lattice parameters a = 3.551 Å and c = 5.716 Å are extracted from the XRD data, which agree with the reported values of hexagonal phase InN (JCPDS cards, no. 65-3412, a = 3.540 Å and c = 5.704 Å). No impurity peaks from elemental In or In2O3 are found in the experimental range.

The composition of the obtained hexagonal InN materials could also be derived from XPS spectra. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the In 3d and N 1s regions of XPS spectra, respectively. The binding energy of In 3d5/2 is 444.8 eV and the binding energy of In 3d3/2 is 452.4 eV, which are in good agreement with the reported values (In 3d5/2: 444.3 eV and In 3d3/2: 451.9 eV). The binding energy of N 1s peak at 396.2 eV is corresponding to the value of the bulk InN from the literature.31

The morphology of the obtained InN sample is further analyzed by FESEM and TEM. A typical FESEM image shown in Fig. 3(a) reveals that the InN sample are composed of nanoplates and nanoparticles. The yield of InN nanoplates in the sample is estimated to be over 50% based on the FESEM view. The length of InN nanoplates is about 400 nm with the thickness of 50 nm. The TEM image further indicates that the InN sample are composed of nanoplates with hexagonal platelet-shaped as shown in Fig. 3(b). From the HRTEM image (Fig. 3(c)), the two sets of well-resolved lattice fringes at an angle of 53° with the same d spacing of 0.27 nm, which should correspond to the (101) and (10) crystal planes of the hexagonal phase InN. The typical SAED pattern (shown in Fig. 3(d)) of the sample reveals the (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) planes of hexagonal InN, which correspond to the indexed diffraction peaks of InN (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) in XRD measurement (Fig. 1).

A typical Raman spectrum of the obtained nanosheets was shown in Fig. 4. The peaks centered at 484 and 582 cm−1 can be found in Fig. 4, which can be assigned to the phonon vibration frequencies of the E2 and A1(LO), respectively. The Raman spectrum agrees with the other reports.32 All the above characterization results have proved that hexagonal phase InN nanosheets have been successfully synthesized via our designed reaction route.

All the above characterization results have proved that hexagonal phase InN nanoplates have been successfully synthesized via our designed reaction route. To understand the reaction process of preparing InN materials, a series of relevant experiments are carried out through similar processes to find the factors played important roles in the formation of InN.
The effects of the reaction time are investigated first. In the reaction system, the excess NaNH2 is added in the autoclave to guarantee the conversion of In2O3 to InN completely. Because NaNH2 is sensitive to the water and oxygen in the air during the XRD characterization, the unreacted NaNH2 in the raw product can be washed out by ethanol and water for further XRD characterization. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the XRD patterns of the samples with different times of 10 h and 15 h, respectively. From the Fig. 5(a), all the reflection peaks can be indexed to that of In2O3 (JCPDS card, no. 06-0416). The diffraction peaks in Fig. 5(b) can be indexed to be NaInS2 (JCPDS cards, no. 74-0135, labeled as ▼), InN (JCPDS cards, no. 65-3412, labeled as ◆) and In2O3 (JCPDS cards, no. 06-0416, labeled as ▽).
 Fig. 5  The typical XRD patterns of the obtained samples with different reaction time: (a) 10 h, (b) 15 h. 
From the above results, the formation process should include several stages. In the first stage of the reaction process, the In2O3 is not involved in the reaction. NaNH2 as a strong reducing agent could react with sulfur to generate NaHS, which can be expressed as reaction (1). 
3NaNH2 + 3S → 3NaHS + N2 + NH3
(1)
Although detailed information about this stage is incomplete and the intermediate compounds cannot be detected, reaction (1) can be proposed in this stage. The second stage of the process, when the reaction time is prolonged to 15 h, the most of In2O3 transforms to NaInS2 by the reaction of In2O3, NaNH2 and NaHS, which could be indicated as 
In2O3 + 4NaHS + NaNH2 → 2NaInS2 + 3NaOH + NH3
(2)
From the result of the XRD characterization (Fig. 5(b)), the NaInS2 as intermediate compound is formed in the product. It is worth noting that the relative intensity of the (00l) reflections (l = 3, 6, 9) is higher compared with those of bulk NaInS2, which may indicate an anisotropic growth of the NaInS2. It may be a premise of the formation of InN nanoplates in the next stage of the process. The last stage of the process, when the reaction time is prolong to 30 h, the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1) can be indexed to hexagonal phase InN. The diffraction peaks of the NaInS2 and In2O3 are not found in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1), which proves that the hexagonal phase InN is obtained by the reaction of the intermediate compound NaInS2 and NaNH2. This stage of the reaction process can be described as: 
NaInS2 + NaNH2 → InN + 2NaHS
(3)
Thus, the total reaction can be expressed as:In2O3 + 3S + 6NaNH2 → 2InN + 3NaHS + N2 + 2NH3 + 3NaOH
Form the above analysis, the addition of sulfur should be essential for the formation of indium nitride, which has been further verified in our experiments. Without adding sulfur in the similar reaction, indium nitride cannot be obtained in the product. Besides the reaction time, the effect of reaction temperature is also investigated. If the reaction temperature is below 180 °C, indium nitride cannot be obtained. When the reaction process is run at 300 °C for 10 h, the XRD pattern of the obtained product (shown in Fig. 6(a)) reveals the product is purity hexagonal InN, which indicates that In2O3 is completely transformed to InN within 10 h. Thus, relative high reaction temperature can increase the rate of the chemical reaction and reduce their reaction time. The SEM image of the InN sample obtained at 300 °C for 10 h (Fig. 6(b)) reveals that InN nanoparticles were the major product. The yield of InN nanoplates is estimated to over 10% on the basis of the SEM view. When the reaction temperature is increased, the yield of InN nanoplates decreased. Our present understanding of the formation mechanism of InN is still limited, and the formation mechanism of InN may be more complex. Further work is desired to identify the formation mechanism of InN.

In summary, we have successfully prepared hexagonal phase InN nanoplates by a sulfur-assisted synthetic route at low temperature of 190 °C. The formation mechanism is also studied to indicate that it proceeds with NaInS2 as the probable intermediate. We believe that this simple method has potential applications in preparation of other group nitrides. The precursors used in our method are commercially available, cheap, and easily handled, therefore, this approach may be exploited for practical industrial InN production.
Experimental
All the reagents used in the experiments were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co. To prevent oxygen contamination, all manipulations were carried out in a glove box purged with nitrogen gas. Details of a typical experiment are as follows: In2O3 (0.54 g), NaNH2 (4.00 g) and sublimed sulfur (0.32 g) was put into a 20 mL stainless-steel autoclave. Then the autoclave was sealed and heated from room temperature to 190 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1 and kept for 30 h. After it was naturally cooled to room temperature, the raw product was washed with ethanol and distilled water for several times, finally dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h for further characterization.
XRD measurements were carried out with a Philips X'pert X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα λ = 1.54178 Å). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image was taken by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL-JSM-6700F). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were taken on a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope with the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALab MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using Mg Kα X-ray as the excitation source.
