    , Accepted 28th January 2020First published on 28th January 2020AbstractThe aim of this study is to investigate the photoelectrochemical performance and behavior of mixed-phase titanium oxide, which was prepared through a high voltage method, and a manganese oxide heterojunction (Ti–TiOx–MnOx). In addition, the obtained results for Ti–TiOx–MnOx have been compared to the photoelectrochemical performance and behavior of titanium oxide nanotubes with a rutile phase, which is widely accepted as a reference due to the well-known photoelectrochemical performance, and manganese oxide heterojunction (Ti-nanotube–MnOx). The photoelectrochemical experiments showed that the application of stabilization potential and the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen significantly affected the photoelectrochemical properties of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode. Exposing the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode to a stabilization potential of 1200 mV in the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen altered its oxidative photoelectrochemical response to a reductive photoelectrochemical response. However, the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode was not sensitive to the aforementioned conditions and always exhibited the same oxidative photoelectrochemical response. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy were exploited to characterize the prepared electrodes. These experiments showed that the deposited manganese oxide layer on both electrodes has a layered structure without long-range order. However, only the manganese oxide on the surface of the mixed-phase titanium oxide exhibited the expected photoelectrochemical response according to previous studies conducted on manganese oxide. Furthermore, according to the characterization experiments, it can be concluded that the different chemical environments of mixed-phase titanium oxide, containing both anatase and rutile phases, with oxygen vacancy sites may be one discernible reason for the observed different photoelectrochemical response of manganese oxide compared to titanium oxide nanotubes with a rutile phase.
Introduction
The industrial revolution commenced with the invention of the steam engine, which relied on wood and coal as fuel, about 250 years ago. Afterwards, internal combustion systems were invented, which exploit petroleum distillates as fuel. This sequence of historical events has left the legacy of the industrial age for humanity, the greenhouse effect, and exhausted oil fields in the near future.1 Thus, harvesting solar energy without the harming environment has become a widely accepted answer to society's energy demand because it provides a decentralized and infinite source of energy with the capacity of 130 million 500 MW power plant at any instant. However, fulfilling this goal depends on cost-effective solar energy conversion and storage in order to overcome the periodically fluctuating nature of sunlight during day and night.2–6 Furthermore, hydrogen has been considered an alternative to fossil fuels because of its clean combustion products.7 Moreover, after the pioneering report of photo-electrochemical water splitting on the surface of an irradiated TiO2 electrode by Fujishima,8 converting and storing sunlight energy by the utilization of semiconductor materials for splitting water to hydrogen and oxygen have been considered as one possible answer to the most critical part of the solar energy harvesting process.2–4,6
Photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting are equipped with a semiconductor electrode in contact with an aqueous solution and possess some advantages over systems based on photovoltaic solar cells for electrochemical water splitting cells such as simplicity and low-cost. Additionally, photoelectrochemical cells equipped with semiconductor electrodes in contact with the aqueous solution has another attractive advantage for water splitting, which is the facile development of an electric field at the semiconductor/liquid junction.2–4,9
There have been many reports on diverse preparation methods resulting in different nanostructures and phases of TiO2.10–44 Electrochemical methods have some interesting features such as being solution based with easy manipulation of solution composition and precursors, inexpensive, operable in ambient conditions or relatively mild conditions, controllable operational current density and voltage, and most importantly, already industrialized.14,45,46 Thereby, due to the abovementioned features, a wide range of materials and almost all catalysts and semiconductor photocatalysts can be prepared with diverse morphologies and compositions through the electrochemical synthesis method.14
P-25 (Degussa) is still considered to be the standard photocatalyst owing to its superior photochemical and photoelectrochemical properties.47 After the initial studies on P-25 (Degussa),48–51 the most widely accepted explanation for its excellent performance is the synergetic effect between anatase and rutile nanoparticles, which leads to spatial charge separation and hindered recombination.52,53 Accordingly, many authors agree that the preparation and study of mixed-phase TiO2 can lead to a better understanding for future studies.50,52,54
Nature uses a manganese-oxide-based structure to oxidize water.55–57 Although manganese oxide is well-known for its electrochemical water-splitting properties,58–62 its photoelectrochemical water-splitting ability has been subjected to study. The earliest report in 1994 by Suib et al. was about the photo-oxidation of 2-propanol to acetone instead of the more interesting water oxidation reaction.63 Further studies on the photo-oxidation ability of manganese oxide by Suib et al.55 offered persuasive evidence to other researchers to conduct studies on the photoelectrochemical properties of layered manganese oxide.62,64,65 Layered manganese oxide has also been subjected to band structure modification in order to amplify its absorption ability toward visible light, and its charge separation efficiency has been enhanced via the addition of a polyaniline layer.66,67 Combining manganese oxide with other semiconductor metal oxides is another strategy that has been applied for the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency.68–73
Another issue in photoelectrochemical water splitting or solar energy harvesting is charge carrier recombination, which is considered a major obstacle for photoelectrochemical processes. Charge carrier recombination results in deterioration in the efficiency of the photoelectrochemical process.74 After excitation by photons with an appropriate energy, electron and holes may migrate to the surface of semiconductor particles in the picosecond time-scale to participate in favorable oxidation or reduction reactions.74 If the oxidation or reduction reactions have too slow kinetics to occur at this speed, the photo-excited electrons and holes may recombine.74 Unfortunately, the aforementioned issue is the case for the photoelectrochemical water splitting process.74
There are some approaches to overcome the issue of electron and hole recombination. One method is the exploitation of electron and hole scavengers capable of efficiently removing either electrons or holes, preventing their recombination.75 Manipulation of the morphology of photocatalysts has been proven to be another efficient solution for the problem of recombination, which improves photoactivity by shortening the diffusion pathways for photo-excited electrons and holes to the surface of the photocatalyst or providing a greater surface area for oxidation or reduction reactions to occur.76,77 Another interesting approach for tackling the recombination problem is mimicking the step-by-step separation of charge carriers in photosystem II in biological systems. In this method, by exploiting the energetics of the conduction and/or valence band edges of semiconductors, which are in contact in the heterojunction, charge transfer from one semiconductor to another leads to more efficient charge separation.78
Accordingly, herein, the aim was to investigate mixed-phase TiO2, which was prepared previously through a facile and straightforward electrochemical method by our research group and showed interesting photoelectrochemical features,79 and manganese oxide heterojunction, which has been proven to have electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic ability toward water splitting.79,80 This study also investigated the photoelectrochemical performance and characterization of the heterojunction via different methods to provide insight for further studies and the preparation of new sophisticated photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.
Results and discussion
Photoelectrochemical investigations
The previous studies on the photo-electrochemical behavior of manganese oxide and mixed-phase titanium oxide revealed that the applied bias potential together with the solution composition, the presence or absence of oxygen, the application of a stabilization potential and the excitation wavelength play an important role in the photocurrent response profile of these photo-catalysts, especially in the case of manganese oxide.79,80
Accordingly, the photo-electrochemical response of the Ti-nanotube–MnOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrodes was recorded in the presence and absence of oxygen, and before and after the application of a stabilization potential to study their photo-electrochemical behavior. Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrate the results from the photo-electrochemical experiments conducted on the manganese oxide-modified electrodes before the application of a 1200 mV stabilization potential in the presence of dissolved oxygen. There are two critical issues to mention about the results presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. The first issue is the higher photoelectrochemical response observed for the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode compared to that of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode. This issue may be due to the difference in the amount of manganese oxide layer resistance or electron and hole recombination rate. The second issue is the appearance of a higher photoelectrochemical response at longer wavelength and higher applied bias voltages for the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode in contrast to that of the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode. The latter issue was previously observed in the photo-electrochemical behavior of manganese oxide.80

(a) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (b) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the presence of dissolved oxygen and before exposing the manganese oxide-modified electrodes to 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (c) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (d) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the absence of dissolved oxygen and before exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (e) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (f) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the presence of dissolved oxygen and after exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (g) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (h) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the absence of dissolved oxygen and after exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (All experiments were conducted in a two-electrode system, KOH (0.1 M) electrolyte solution, and the applied light source was a 2 W LED. The color scale, on the upper side of the charts, is added for better expression of the effect of illuminated light with different wavelengths and color. A full description of the calculation methods used for data presentation is available in the ESI†). 
Hypothetically, it is expected that Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode will show a photoelectrochemical response similar to layered manganese oxide in the absence of dissolved oxygen in contrast to the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode. In the subsequent experiments, the photoelectrochemical responses of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes before the application of a 1200 mV stabilization potential in the absence of dissolved oxygen were recorded. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. As expected, similar to layered manganese oxide, the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode showed a reductive photocurrent in the absence of dissolved oxygen at wavelengths longer than 410 nm in contrast to the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode, which exhibited the opposite response.
The next factor previously confirmed to have a substantial effect on the photoelectrochemical response of manganese oxide is the application of a stabilization potential.80 Accordingly, in the next experiments, the photoelectrochemical responses of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes after the application of a 1200 mV stabilization potential in the absence and presence of dissolved oxygen were recorded. Fig. 1(e) and (f) show the photoelectrochemical responses of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes after being exposed to a 1200 mV stabilization potential for 2 h in the presence of dissolved oxygen, respectively. As can be seen, again, at wavelengths longer than 460 nm, the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode showed a reductive photoelectrochemical response in contrast to the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode, which showed no reductive photoelectrochemical response. The Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode only exhibited a significant oxidative photoelectrochemical response at wavelengths shorter than 520 nm.
In the final step of the photoelectrochemical experiments, the photoelectrochemical responses of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes after the application of a 1200 mV stabilization potential in the absence of dissolved oxygen were recorded. As presented in Fig. 1(g) and (h), both the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes showed an oxidative photoelectrochemical response, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that in the case of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode, similarly to the manganese oxide photocatalyst, the application of a stabilization potential and the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen have a significant effect on its photoelectrochemical response. However, in the case of the Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrode, the manganese oxide layer on the titanium nanotubes may not be able express its photoelectrochemical properties and it is more likely that the manganese oxide layer acts as an electrocatalyst rather than as a photoelectrocatalyst.
The underlying reason for this difference in photoelectrochemical behavior for the manganese oxide layer may be related to the different properties of the photocatalyst substrates. It is an interesting fact that the mixed-phase titanium oxide provides a better environment for the second layer of the photocatalyst. Moreover, it should be mentioned that there may be an opportunity to optimize the ratio of the anatase and rutile phases in order to obtain a better photoelectrochemical performance from the second photoelectrocatalyst layer. Additionally, any attempt to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms resulting in the interesting photoelectrochemical behavior of mixed-phase titanium oxide may be an important step toward efficient and cost-effective solar energy harvesting.
SEM and EDS characterization
To study the morphology and composition of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes, SEM imaging, EDX spectroscopy, and EDX mapping were conducted. The results of the SEM imaging experiments are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) Ti electrode, (b) Ti–TiOx, (c) Ti-nanotube, (d) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (e) Ti-nanotube–MnOx surface. The SEM images of Ti–TiOx and Ti-nanotube were recorded after the electrodes were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. 
As can be seen, Fig. 2(a) shows the normal surface of the titanium electrode with scratches on its surface resulting from the polishing step. The EDX and EDX mapping results of the titanium electrode are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which indicate that the electrode surface is almost pure metallic titanium. In the case of the Ti–TiOx electrode, as can be observed in Fig. 2(b), it possesses a wrinkled morphology on its surface. Additionally, small lace-like structures (ca. 5–10 nm) can be observed on the surface of Ti–TiOx, covering the surface of the electrode. The thickness of these layers based on the SEM images was estimated to be less than 50–70 nm, which is consistent with the color of the titanium after the electrochemical operation.82 The EDX experiment and EDX mapping results are illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The results indicate the presence of titanium and oxygen, confirming the existence of an oxygen-containing layer on the electrode surface. The results of the SEM studies conducted on the TiOx-nanotube electrode are shown in Fig. 2(c). As it can be observed, the nanotube morphology is noticeable in the images, but there are defects in the nanotubes, which may be due to the calcination step. The EDX and EDX mapping results are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which show that there is a large amount of titanium and oxygen on the surface of the electrode, confirming the appearance of an oxygen-containing layer on the electrode surface.
In the case of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes, as presented in Fig. 2(d) and (e), respectively, there is a noticeable difference in the observed morphologies. In the case of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode, the observed morphology is crumpled sheet-like; however, in the case of the TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrode, there is a joined spherical morphology. The EDX and EDX mapping results for Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx are presented in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), respectively.81 The results show that these electrodes are composed of titanium, oxygen, and manganese, confirming the existence of a manganese and oxygen-containing layer on the electrode surface.
UV-Vis spectroscopic characterization
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy was exploited to study the optical properties of the TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrodes, and the results for Ti–TiOx–MnOx are presented in Fig. 3(a). As can be seen, the peak at 220–270 nm corresponding to the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti species in the titanium metal electrode is diminished for the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti–TiOx electrodes, which is evidence of the titanium oxide layer.83 The existence of the broad peak at 510 nm for Ti–TiOx can be attributed to the oxygen vacancies in Ti–TiOx.79,84 In the case of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrode, a broadened peak was observed at 260–410 nm instead of a peak in the wavelength range of 300–380 nm observed for the Ti–TiOx electrode, which is believed to be attributed to the characteristic d–d transitions of the manganese ions in the octahedral sites of manganese oxide nanosheets.85,86 Furthermore, another broad absorption peak was observed in the wavelength range of 500–800 nm, which can be attributed to the formation of layered manganese oxides.87
 Fig. 3  Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the Ti, Ti–TiOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrodes (a) and Ti, TiOx-nanotube and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes (b). The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the manganese oxide-modified electrodes were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. 
Similar experiments were conducted on the TiOx-nanotube and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). As can be seen, the formation of the titanium oxide layer on the titanium electrode is observable due to the disappearance of the peak at 220–270 nm, corresponding to the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti species in the titanium metal electrode. A broad peak in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm was observed after the addition of the manganese oxide layer on the titanium nanotubes. Surprisingly, manganese oxide prepared through the same method produces different oxide layers on different titanium oxide substrates. According to the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy experiments, it can be concluded that the mixed-phase titanium oxide prepared through the high voltage oxidation of titanium metal in alkali solution offers a different chemical environment for manganese oxide compared to titanium nanotubes.
XRD characterization
The XRD patterns of Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx were recorded to determine the reason for the different photoelectrochemical behaviors of the manganese oxide layer on the TiOx-nanotube and Ti–TiOx electrodes. The results of the XRD experiment conducted on the titanium electrode are presented in the ESI.† The results of these investigations are presented in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c), the XRD peaks of metallic titanium (reference code 00-001-1197) in both the TiOx-nanotube and Ti–TiOx electrodes are dominant. However, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the characteristic XRD peaks for the anatase and rutile phases of titanium oxide are observed in the XRD pattern of the Ti–TiOx electrode (2θ = 25.156°, 35.912°, 37.402°, 47.721°, and 53.327°, which are consistent with Reference Code 01-079-1169 for the anatase phase and 2θ = 27.816°, 39.061°, 54.927°, 68.724°, 76.133°, consistent with Reference Code 01-076-0319 for the rutile phase). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4(c), in the case of the TiOx-nanotube electrode, only the XRD peaks of the rutile phase together with the metallic titanium phase are present in its XRD pattern. In the case of the manganese oxide-modified electrodes, the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes, as is clear from Fig. 4(b) and (d), respectively, there are no observable patterns of crystalline manganese oxide phase. Additionally, the peak located at 27.816° was not detected in the XRD pattern of Ti–TiOx–MnOx; however, other peaks for the rutile phase with higher intensities were observed. This may be due to the addition of the manganese oxide layer on top of the titanium oxide layer, making the peaks with a lower intensity difficult to detect. Besides the aforementioned issues, a broad shoulder-like peak located at 10–15° appeared in the XRD patterns of both the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes. According to the information available from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopic experiments and considering the detection of manganese and oxygen in the EDX and EDX mapping experiments, the shoulder-like broad peaks observed in the XRD patterns of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes can be considered as possible evidence for the presence of manganese oxide. Although the observed morphologies for the manganese oxide layer of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes in the SEM imaging experiments were different, the XRD results reveal that the structure of the manganese oxide layer for both electrodes is very similar. Furthermore, there are reports on the conversion of manganese oxide catalysts with different phases and structures to manganese oxide after being exposed to positive potentials in water oxidation experiments.88–90
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the (a) Ti–TiOx, (b) Ti–TiOx–MnOx, (c) TiOx-nanotube, (d) TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and (e) titanium electrodes. The XRD patterns of the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The XRD patterns of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. 
Considering the results of the XRD experiments, it is reasonable to conclude that the surprising oxidative and reductive photoelectrochemical response observed for the Ti–TiOx electrode may have resulted from the difference observed in the phase structure of the TiOx-nanotube and Ti–TiOx electrodes, which may play an important role in the photoelectrochemical response of the manganese oxide layers.
ATR-FTIR spectroscopic characterization
To gain more in-depth insight about the structure of the Ti–TiOx, TiOx-nanotube, Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes, further investigations were performed by conducting ATR-FTIR experiments. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a), (b) and (e) illustrate the ATR-FTIR spectra of the Ti–TiOx, TiOx-nanotube and titanium electrodes, respectively. The comparison of these spectra shows the appearance of peaks in the wavenumber range of 700–850 cm−1 and 1100–1200 cm−1, which can be attributed to the formation of a titanium oxide layer on the surface of the titanium electrodes.91 Additionally, the broad and intense peak at 3500–3600 cm−1 in the case of Ti–TiOx compared to the TiOx-nanotube electrode is evidence for the more pronounced presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the Ti–TiOx electrode.91 The results of the ATR-FTIR experiments conducted on the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 5(c), after the addition of a manganese oxide layer on the surface of the Ti–TiOx electrode, a relatively strong peak at 450–700 cm−1 appeared in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of Ti–TiOx–MnOx. This peak can be considered as evidence for the presence of manganese oxide. It worth mentioning that the appearance of this peak in the wavenumber range of 400–650 cm−1 is recognized as evidence for the presence of layered manganese oxides.92 As observed in Fig. 5(d), the aforementioned peak at 400–650 cm−1 is also present in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of the TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrode. Although FTIR spectra cannot provide a perfect picture about the structure of inorganic compounds, the analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectroscopic experiment results suggests that the titanium oxide substrate may have a significant effect on the photoelectrochemical response behavior of the manganese oxide layer.

The ATR-FTIR spectra of the TiOx-nanotube and Ti–TiOx electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The ATR-FTIR spectra of TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. 
Conclusions
Considering the photoelectrochemical results from the studies in the present work, it is reasonable to conclude that the observed results for manganese oxide are consistent with the previous studies conducted on manganese oxide. It was shown that the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen together with the application of a stabilization potential could determine the photoelectrochemical behavior of manganese oxide on the surface of the mixed-phase titanium oxide photocatalyst substrate. Interestingly, in contrast to the mixed-phase titanium oxide, on the surface of titanium oxide nanotubes with a rutile phase, the manganese oxide photocatalyst only exhibited oxidative photoelectrochemical behavior. The results of the SEM, EDX, and EDX mapping experiments confirmed the successful electrodeposition of manganese oxide on the surface of titanium oxide. The results from the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy experiments showed that the mixed-phase titanium oxide prepared through the high voltage oxidation of titanium metal in alkali solution offers a somewhat different chemical environment for manganese oxide compared to titanium nanotubes. Furthermore, the XRD experiments revealed that despite the different morphologies observed in the SEM imaging experiments, the manganese oxide layers on the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes have an almost similar phase structure. Additionally, the different phase structures observed for the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes may be the only detectable origin for the different photoelectrochemical behaviors of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes. Finally, the results of the ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopic experiments also support the same conclusion from previous characterization methods. In summary, it can be concluded that mixed-phase titanium oxide can provide an interesting environment for manganese oxide photocatalysts and is beneficial for activity in both oxidation and reduction processes. Additionally, we believe that further investigation of Ti–TiOx with mixed-phase structures may provide valuable information for the preparation of more sophisticated photocatalysts for solar energy conversion.

 	Fig. 1  Photocurrent response of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and Ti-nanotube–MnOx electrodes recorded by pulsed light amperometric experiments versus bias voltage and excitation wavelength under different conditions. (a) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (b) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the presence of dissolved oxygen and before exposing the manganese oxide-modified electrodes to 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (c) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (d) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the absence of dissolved oxygen and before exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (e) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (f) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the presence of dissolved oxygen and after exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (g) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (h) Ti-nanotube–MnOx in the absence of dissolved oxygen and after exposure to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h. (All experiments were conducted in a two-electrode system, KOH (0.1 M) electrolyte solution, and the applied light source was a 2 W LED. The color scale, on the upper side of the charts, is added for better expression of the effect of illuminated light with different wavelengths and color. A full description of the calculation methods used for data presentation is available in the ESI†).	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) Ti electrode, (b) Ti–TiOx, (c) Ti-nanotube, (d) Ti–TiOx–MnOx and (e) Ti-nanotube–MnOx surface. The SEM images of Ti–TiOx and Ti-nanotube were recorded after the electrodes were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h.	 

 	Fig. 3  Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the Ti, Ti–TiOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx electrodes (a) and Ti, TiOx-nanotube and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes (b). The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra of the manganese oxide-modified electrodes were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h.	 

 	Fig. 4  XRD patterns of the (a) Ti–TiOx, (b) Ti–TiOx–MnOx, (c) TiOx-nanotube, (d) TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and (e) titanium electrodes. The XRD patterns of the Ti–TiOx and TiOx-nanotube electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The XRD patterns of the Ti–TiOx–MnOx and TiOx-nanotube–MnOx electrodes were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h.	 

 	Fig. 5  ATR-FTIR spectra of the (a) Ti–TiOx, (b) TiOx-nanotube, (c) Ti–TiOx–MnOx, (d) TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and (e) titanium electrodes. The ATR-FTIR spectra of the TiOx-nanotube and Ti–TiOx electrodes were recorded after they were calcined at 550 °C in air for 12 h. The ATR-FTIR spectra of TiOx-nanotube–MnOx and Ti–TiOx–MnOx were recorded after they were exposed to a 1200 mV bias potential for 2 h.
