    , Accepted 6th October 2019First published on 7th October 2019AbstractEfficiently harvesting solar energy for photocatalysis remains a challenge because near infrared (NIR) light with low excitation energy cannot be directly utilized by general semiconductor photocatalysts, although it makes up 46% of the solar spectrum. Herein, a broad-spectrum photocatalyst with pollutant adsorption-enrichment capability to enable natural sunlight-driven photocatalysis was synthesized by decorating a small amount of silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) nanodots on mesoporous silica (mSiO2)-functionalized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs; NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4). The UCNPs play the role of broadening the absorption spectrum by upconverting NIR light into visible light, which can be absorbed by the Ag3PO4 nanodots. The functionalized hydrophilic mSiO2 shell not only facilitates the decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots but is also capable of adsorbing and enriching pollutants around the Ag3PO4 nanodots to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Upon natural sunlight irradiation, the as-prepared photocatalyst (UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4) exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity with degradation rate constants of 0.24 and 0.051 min−1 under stirring and static conditions, exceeding that of the pure Ag3PO4 sample by factors of 4.2 and 12.5, respectively. Thus, it can be anticipated that the design of photocatalysts with the synergy of broadband absorption and pollutant adsorption-enrichment will be a promising strategy to realize efficient sunlight-driven photocatalysis, even without extra mechanical stirring for future scaled-up water treatment.
1. Introduction
Environmental pollution and energy shortage are the two serious problems encountered by society nowadays. Accordingly, developing semiconductor photocatalysts with enhanced photoactivity for the degradation of pollutants under natural sunlight is an attractive way to address these problems.1–4 It is well known that the solar spectrum consists of 5% ultraviolet (UV), 49% visible (Vis), and 46% near infrared (NIR) light. One big challenge for semiconductor photocatalysts is their narrow absorption spectrum, which can only utilize UV or Vis light.5–7 Therefore, the preparation of broad-spectrum photocatalysts that can utilize the main Vis-NIR light, which occupies 95% of the solar spectrum, is highly desirable.
The Ag3PO4 semiconductor has been proven to possess excellent photooxidative capabilities for the degradation of organic pollutants and O2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation.8 It was reported that Ag3PO4 can achieve high quantum efficiency (∼90%) at wavelengths longer than 420 nm, which is higher than that of most reported semiconductors.9 Thus, it has been regarded as one of the most promising photocatalysts for harvesting solar energy for clean energy production and environmental purification. Although various Ag3PO4-based composite photocatalysts, including TiO2/Ag3PO4,10 C3N4/Ag3PO4,11,12 AgX/Ag3PO4,13,14 WO3/Ag3PO4,15 Ti3C2/Ag3PO4,16 and La,Cr:SrTiO3/Ag3PO4,17 have been developed for simulated sunlight-driven photocatalysis, there is still some room for improvement. First, the NIR light of sunlight remains untapped for Ag3PO4 due to its limited band gap. Second, Ag3PO4 and most of its composites possess low organic pollutant absorption abilities owing to their low specific surface areas,18 limiting their photocatalytic performance. Adsorbent materials such as bentonite,19 covalent organic frameworks,20 porous carbon,18,21 and graphene22,23 can be adopted for combining with Ag3PO4 to increase its pollutant adsorption ability for enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. Third, the particle size and silver usage of Ag3PO4 photocatalysts remain relatively large,12 which result in a low specific surface area and high synthetic cost, respectively, hindering their large scale applications. Thus, developing broad-spectrum absorption and small-sized Ag3PO4 photocatalytic systems with high pollutant adsorption capability for efficient utilization of sunlight is highly desirable.
To broaden the absorption spectrum of semiconductors for the utilization of Vis-NIR light, incorporating UCNPs with semiconductors as composited photocatalysts has been considered as one of the promising strategies.24–31 Specifically, UCNPs serve as light transducers to upconvert NIR light into UV and Vis light, which is absorbed by semiconductors.32 Lanthanide-doped fluoride, exemplified by NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals are popular UCNPs owing to their high upconversion efficiency.24,28,33,34 Core–shell structured NaYF4:Yb,Tm@TiO226,28,32 and NaYF4:Yb,Tm@ZnO33,35 were first reported for NIR light-driven photocatalysis. In these studies, NIR light is split into the stronger Vis light and weaker UV light after upconversion by NaYF4:Yb,Tm. However, this leads to a low utilization efficiency of NIR light because the wide-bandgap TiO2 and ZnO can only harness weaker UV light. Recently, Yu et al.36 and Li et al.37 hybridized UCNPs with narrow-bandgap CdS, which can absorb the stronger upconverted Vis light to enable a better photocatalytic performance. However, a major limitation for these UCNPs is that their hydrophobic surface hinders their dispersion in aqueous solutions, thus making the direct composition of UCNPs with semiconductors difficult.37 Accordingly, coating hydrophobic UCNPs with a hydrophilic mesoporous SiO2 shell (UCNP@mSiO2) is a general strategy for providing a hydrophilic surface,38,39 which also facilitates the subsequent incorporation of semiconductors. In addition, the mesoporous structure of the mSiO2 shell can adsorb and enrich organic pollutants according to the literature.40–42
Considering the advantages of broadening the absorption spectrum and pollutant adsorption-enrichment by UCNP@mSiO2 and the limitations of the Ag3PO4 photocatalytic system, in this study, we synthesized a UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite by decorating a small amount of Ag3PO4 nanodots on UCNP@mSiO2 for natural sunlight-driven photocatalysis. The designed UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 features several unique merits for the photodegradation of organic pollutants as follows: (1) the UCNP core expands the absorption spectrum into the NIR light range for the efficient utilization of natural sunlight; (2) mSiO2 can adsorb and enrich pollutants around the Ag3PO4 nanodots to enhance their photocatalytic performance; and (3) the particle size and silver usage of the Ag3PO4 nanodots remain relatively small, which provide a much large specific surface area for enhancing the photocatalytic performance and reduce the synthetic cost, respectively. The resulting UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite achieved highly efficient natural sunlight-driven or NIR light photocatalysis of organic pollutants compared with other UCNP or Ag3PO4-based photocatalysts owing to the synergy of broad-spectrum absorption and pollutant adsorption-enrichment. Moreover, the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite also exhibited excellent sunlight-driven photocatalysis without extra mechanical stirring, which has potential for future scaled-up water treatment.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite
The UCNPs (β-phase NaYF4:Tm3+ 0.5%,Yb3+ 30%@NaLuF4) were synthesized according to a literature protocol.43 The as-prepared UCNPs (0.02 mmol) in 1 mL cyclohexane were mixed with 200 mg cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 8 mL double-distilled water in a 50 mL beaker. The above mixture was heated to 80 °C to slowly remove the cyclohexane.44 After the solution became transparent, 20 mL deionized water was added, followed by adjusting the solution pH to 9–10 with 0.2 mol L−1 NaOH solution. Thereafter, 200 μL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in 1 mL ethanol was added dropwise and stirred for another 24 h. The as-synthesized UCNP@mSiO2 with template CTAB was collected by centrifugation, and washed with methanol three times. Finally, mesoporous-structured UCNP@mSiO2 was obtained by removing the surfactant template (CTAB) via ion exchange.45
The obtained UCNP@mSiO2 (30 mg) was dispersed in 150 mL ultrapure water. 1 mL AgNO3 (0.15 M) was added dropwise to the above solution under stirring. Subsequently, 10 mL Na2HPO4 solution (0.005 M) was added under sonication. The alternating addition of AgNO3 and Na2HPO4 was repeated three times. After reaction in the dark for 5 h, the final UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was precipitated by centrifugation and rinsed several times with ultrapure water.
2.2 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was performed on a JEOL-1400 TEM at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Gemini SEM 300 microscope. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary50, Varian). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm). Upconversion emission spectra were recorded under the excitation of a commercial 980 nm diode laser (BWT Beijing Ltd, China). The emitted UC fluorescence was recorded by a lens-coupled monochromator (Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd, Beijing) with an attached photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu CR131). N2 adsorption/desorption isothermal curves were measured on a Belsorp Mini system (Microtrac BEL).
Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Chen Hua Instrument Company, Shanghai, China) with a standard three-electrode cell. A Pt plate and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The as-synthesized photocatalysts were deposited on an indium-tin oxide glass as the working electrodes with the deposition area of around 1 cm2. The working electrodes were then immersed in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. Electrochemical impedance spectra illustrated as Nyquist plots were recorded in the frequency range of 0.01 to 105 Hz with an AC perturbation signal. Irradiation was performed by a 150 W Xe lamp with an NIR bandpass (800–2500 nm).
Electron spin resonance (ESR) tests were carried out to detect the active radicals in situ. For the detection of ˙OH, 1.5 mg UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 was dispersed in 3 mL deionized water. Then, 150 μL DMPO solution (37.5 mM) was added to 200 μL of mixture, and irradiated with stimulated sunlight for 2 min. The ESR signals of the DMPO-OH adducts were measured on a Bruker model ESR A200S-95/12 spectrometer at room temperature. The detection of ˙O2− was performed under the same conditions in methanol solution instead of deionized water.
2.3 Photocatalytic measurement
Simulated sunlight-driven photocatalysis was evaluated via the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp. Pure Vis or NIR light-driven photocatalysis was carried out using the following filters: Vis light bandpass (420–800 nm) and NIR light bandpass (800–2500 nm). Typically, 8 mg photocatalyst was suspended in 15 mL RhB aqueous solution (10 mg L−1). Before light irradiation, the mixture was kept in the dark for 60 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between RhB and the photocatalysts. During the photocatalytic process, 1 mL aliquots were taken from the solution at predetermined times and measured on a UV-Vis spectrometer to detect the concentration of the RhB solution. Before the measurement, the sample was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 5 min) to remove the photocatalyst from the photocatalytic reaction system. In the recycling experiment, the photocatalysts were collected by centrifugation at the end of each cycle and washed three times with water. The washing liquid was then collected and residual RhB molecules could be detected.
The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared photocatalysts was also measured via the degradation of RhB under natural sunlight irradiation (Harbin, China) keeping the other conditions same as those of the degradation under simulated sunlight irradiation. 980 nm NIR-light driven degradation was performed by dispersing 8 mg photocatalyst in 2 mL RhB solution (3 mg L−1). Low RhB concentrations were used to ensure that the degradation of RhB could be detected owing to the low power of the diode laser (3 W) and narrow light spot (around 6 mm). The light source was a commercial 980 nm diode laser.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite
The procedure for the synthesis of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite is illustrated in Scheme 1. To realize efficient NIR-to-Vis conversion, core–shell structured UCNPs (NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4) were first prepared by coating a NaLuF4 layer on bare NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals through epitaxial growth (Scheme 1a). After the NaLuF4 layer was introduced, the upconversion efficiency of NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4 greatly increased by 15 times compared with that of the bare NaYF4:Yb,Tm owing to the reduced non-radiative decay losses of the surface luminescence.43 The as-prepared UCNPs were further functionalized with an mSiO2 shell through a sol–gel method to improve their adsorption capacity and hydrophilicity (Scheme 1b). Finally, the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was synthesized through an in situ growth strategy (Scheme 1c). The Ag+ ions from silver nitrate were bound to the surface of mSiO2via electrostatic attraction between the positive Ag+ ions and negative Si–O−. These Ag+ ions were converted into Ag3PO4 nanodots due to ion exchange with the addition of Na2HPO4. During the photodegradation of the model pollutant RhB, RhB molecules in the solution were continuously adsorbed and enriched around the photocatalyst Ag3PO4 by the mSiO2 shell (Scheme 1d). Upon sunlight irradiation, Vis light was directly absorbed by the Ag3PO4 nanodots and the NIR light was converted to Vis light and utilized by the Ag3PO4 nanodots for the degradation of RhB (Scheme 1e).

TEM and SEM characterizations were first conducted to investigate the surface morphology and the structure of the as-prepared nanoparticles. The TEM image (Fig. 1A) shows that the as-prepared UCNPs (NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaLuF4) are monodispersed with an average diameter of 40 nm. The size distribution analysis of UCNPs is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† After coating with the hydrophilic mSiO2 shell, the size of the formed UCNP@mSiO2 nanoparticles increases to around 75 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the UCNP@mSiO2 nanoparticles could be well dispersed in water for the subsequent decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots. Fig. 1C shows three representative Ag3PO4 nanodot-decorated UCNP@mSiO2 nanoparticles. The TEM image clearly demonstrates the modification with nanodots of 2–15 nm in diameter on the previously smooth UCNP@mSiO2 (also see Fig. S2†). To obtain more information about the nanodots, HRTEM analysis was carried out in the red box in Fig. 1D. The lattice fringes of 0.187 and 0.209 nm match well with the (310) and (220) planes of cubic Ag3PO4 crystals, respectively. The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image (inset of Fig. 1D) also demonstrates the coexistence of (310) and (220) planes.

It is worth noting that the mSiO2 shell surface is not fully covered by deposited Ag3PO4 nanodots, which indicates that the mSiO2 shell retains its mesoporous structure. The preservation of the mSiO2 structure after Ag3PO4 decoration is crucial for pollutant adsorption and enrichment. The corresponding N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms before and after Ag3PO4 decoration further confirm the existence of the mesoporous structure (Fig. S3†). The pore diameter of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 is about 3.4 nm, which confirms that there was almost no change after the decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots (the inset of Fig. S3†). The specific area of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 decreased from 210 to 42 m2 g−1 owing to the decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots. The decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots on the mSiO2 surface without forming an Ag3PO4 shell is highly desirable because the dispersed Ag3PO4 nanodots will provide a much larger specific surface area for photocatalysis and avoid the shell shield effect of Ag3PO4.25,28 Most importantly, the preservation of the mesoporous structure after Ag3PO4 decoration enables the adsorption-enrichment of pollutants around Ag3PO4 for enhancing its photocatalytic performance.
The successful preparation of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was further confirmed by XRD measurements (Fig. 1E). All the index peaks of UCNPs and Ag3PO4 can be indexed to the hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 16-0334) and the cubic crystalline phase of Ag3PO4 (JCPDS No. 84-0512), respectively. Both UCNP and Ag3PO4 phases can be observed in the XRD pattern of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4. Moreover, no other peaks appeared in the XRD pattern of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4, confirming the high purity of the product. Additionally, the XPS analysis results (Fig. S4 and Table S1†) also confirm the co-existence of F, Y, Na, Yb, Tm, Lu, Si, Ag, P, and O elements in the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite.
3.2 Optical properties and NIR-responsive photocatalysis
It is well known that a good match between the absorption spectrum of photocatalysts and the emission spectrum of UCNPs is crucial in determining the photocatalytic efficiency. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of Ag3PO4 and UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 and the upconversion light spectrum of UCNP@mSiO2 are presented in Fig. 2A. The pristine Ag3PO4 shows strong absorption with an absorption edge at about 520 nm (curve a), consistent with previous reports.19 Also, the UV-Vis absorption of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 (curve b) is similar to that of Ag3PO4, exhibiting obvious absorption in the Vis region. According to previous reports, UCNPs (NaYF4:Yb,Tm) can emit upconversion light at 345, 360, 450, 475, and 800 nm owing to the 3P6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3H6, and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ ions, respectively.46 As expected, blue-light emissions at 450 and 475 nm were observed in the upconversion light spectrum of UCNP@mSiO2 upon NIR light irradiation (curve c). The emission spectrum of UCNP@mSiO2 at 450 and 475 nm matches well with the absorption spectrum of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 in the region of 425 to 520 nm, which may facilitate energy transfer from the UCNPs to Ag3PO4. The energy transfer from the UCNPs to Ag3PO4 is justified by Fig. 2B, showing “blue-light quenching” at 450 and 475 nm for UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 (curve b) in contrast to that of UCNP@mSiO2 (curve a) when the upconversion emission intensities were normalized at 800 nm. Additionally, the blue-light quenching could be easily judged by the naked eye, as shown in the inset image.

(B) Emission spectrum of UCNP@mSiO2 before and after Ag3PO4 decoration under 980 nm laser irradiation. The upconversion light intensity was normalized to the Tm emission at 800 nm, and the insets are the corresponding emission photos. UCL: upconversion light. 
The NIR light-driven photocatalytic activity of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 was further evaluated by the degradation of RhB upon 980 nm NIR irradiation. After 60 min of NIR irradiation, the degradation rate of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 with NIR was much higher than that without NIR (Fig. S5†). The control sample of pure RhB solution did not show any degradation. These results demonstrate that the as-prepared UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite functions under NIR light irradiation. In addition, the NIR light driven-photocatalytic activity of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 was compared with that of other UCNP-based photocatalysts in Table S2 (ESI†), from which it can be seen that the photocatalytic performance of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 is comparable with that of most of the reported UCNP-based photocatalysts.
To further investigate the NIR light-responsive charge carrier separation and transfer in the as-prepared photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed under NIR light irradiation. The photoexcited electron transfer in the photocatalysts was first studied by measuring their photocurrent response under repeated on–off cycles of NIR light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3A, a prompt and reproducible photocurrent density (around 0.7 μA cm−2) was detected for the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite electrode upon NIR irradiation, which reveals its sensitive photoelectrochemical activities. In contrast, no photocurrent response was observed for UCNP@mSiO2 and a very low photocurrent response was detected in Ag3PO4. In addition, electrochemical impedance (EIS) analysis was also carried out to investigate the interface charge carrier separation efficiency. Fig. 3B presents the EIS Nyquist plots of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4, UCNP@mSiO2, and Ag3PO4 under NIR irradiation. The smaller arc radius represents more efficient separation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers. The arc radius of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 electrode was significantly smaller than that of UCNP@mSiO2 and Ag3PO4, suggesting the highly efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers in the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite, which agrees well with the photoelectrochemical measurements.

3.3 Photocatalytic performance under stimulated and natural sunlight irradiation
The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was first evaluated by assessing the photodegradation of RhB under stimulated sunlight irradiation. Fig. 4A shows the photodegradation performance of RhB in the presence of different photocatalysts. The control experiment in the absence of catalyst showed the negligible degradation of RhB. Compared with pristine Ag3PO4 (curve d), the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite showed much higher photoactivity with 91% of RhB degraded in 20 min (curve a), indicating that UCNP@mSiO2 plays a crucial role during the photocatalytic process. To further investigate the role of UCNPs and mSiO2, a physical mixture of UCNP@mSiO2 and Ag3PO4 and the UCNP@SiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite with a solid silica layer were prepared as control samples. The UCNP@SiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite showed higher photocatalytic efficiency than that of the physical mixture of UCNP@mSiO2 and Ag3PO4 because more NIR light in the stimulated sunlight could be upconverted by the UCNPs in the UCNP@SiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite than that in the physical mixture of UCNP@mSiO2 and Ag3PO4. This also demonstrates that the hierarchical structure is very crucial for the efficient upconverted energy transfer.

Additionally, the photocatalytic performance of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 (curve a) was much higher than that of UCNP@SiO2-Ag3PO4 (curve b) owing to the absorption-enrichment of mSiO2. Thus, the above results demonstrate that the absorption-enrichment by mSiO2 enhanced the photocatalytic performance of the broadband photocatalyst UCNP@SiO2-Ag3PO4. Consequently, the absorption band broadening ability of UCNPs also promotes the photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4. Thus, the synergy of broad-spectrum absorption and pollutant adsorption-enrichment results in highly efficient sunlight-driven photocatalysis. Additional evidence for the absorption-enrichment effect is presented in Fig. S6,† in which the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 powder showed a colour change from yellowish-green to red after RhB adsorption, while the color reverted to yellowish-green at the end of the photodegradation process, indicating that the absorbed RhB in the mSiO2 shell was completely degraded.
To investigate the reaction kinetics for the photocatalytic degradation, the photocatalytic data of the different photocatalysts was fitted to pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig. 4B). All the fitting curves of ln(C0/C) against irradiation time (t) are linear with a high correlation coefficient of around 0.98. Thus, the reaction kinetics for the decomposition of RhB can be described by using the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. As expected, the order of the reaction rate follows the same trend mentioned above. The as-prepared UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite showed an enhanced photocatalytic activity with a photo-degradation rate constant of 0.113 min−1 (k = ln(C0/C)/t), which is 2.4 times higher than that of the pristine Ag3PO4.
Next, the pure visible or NIR light-driven photocatalytic performance of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4 toward the degradation of RhB is shown in Fig. 5. The UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite exhibited higher photoactivity than that of the pristine Ag3PO4 under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5A). This further confirms that mSiO2 could capture more RhB molecules to the vicinity of the Ag3PO4 nanodots, speeding up the photoreaction process. For the NIR light-driven photoactivity (Fig. 5B), the photoactivity of Ag3PO4 itself was quite poor, which was close to that of the control group without photocatalyst because the NIR light cannot be directly absorbed by Ag3PO4 nanodots due to their limited bandgap. In contrast, the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite exhibited an efficient photocatalytic performance with nearly 85% RhB degraded in 120 min, which is comparable with that of many UCNPs-based photocatalysts.28,29,47 Overall, the pure visible or NIR light driven photocatalytic results further reveal the important role of mSiO2 and UCNPs for pollutant-enrichment and broad-spectrum absorption, respectively. Also, highly efficient sunlight-driven photocatalysis using UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 was realized through the synergy of pollutant-enrichment and broad-spectrum absorption.

The stability of photocatalysts is also important for their practical applications. Pristine Ag3PO4 often suffers from stability issues because Ag+ ions can be reduced to Ag by receiving photoexcited electrons during photocatalysis.26 The cycling degradation experiments of the pristine Ag3PO4 nanodots and UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite were carried out for comparison. The performance of Ag3PO4 deteriorated more significantly after three cycles compared with that of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite (Fig. 6). The improved stability of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 photocatalyst may be attributed to the presence of the mSiO2 layer. The Si–OH bonds on the surface of mSiO2 can promote the adsorption of O2 so that the adsorbed O2 may capture photogenerated electrons to partially prevent Ag+ from being reduced to Ag.48,49

For a promising photocatalyst to be used for practical applications, its capability to utilize natural solar energy for photocatalysis is very meaningful in view of energy saving. Thus, we further evaluated the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples under natural sunlight irradiation. In addition, traditionally powerful agitation is an indispensable approach used to disperse photocatalysts into pollutant solutions with strong turbulence, which ensures sufficient contact between the pollutants and the photocatalysts. However, this mechanical stirring treatment is not suitable for practical industrial demand since it is not energy saving and makes the post-separation of the photocatalyst from the reaction media difficult. Considering the absorption-enrichment capability of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4, herein, we attempted to carry out the natural sunlight-driven photocatalytic experiments under static (without mechanical stirring) and dynamic (with stirring) conditions for comparison.
The dynamic degradation of RhB in the presence of pristine Ag3PO4 nanodots and the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 7A. The as-prepared UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite (curve a) exhibited excellent catalytic activity with 90% of RhB degraded in 10 min, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine Ag3PO4 nanodots (curve b) (see Video S1† for the actual experimental demonstration). The rate constant of the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite was calculated to be 0.24 min−1 (Fig. S7†), which is 4.2 times higher than that of the pristine Ag3PO4. The static photodegradation performance of RhB is shown in Fig. 7B. For static photodegradation, it can be expected that the photocatalytic reaction rate is slower in comparison with the dynamic condition considering that the photocatalytic reaction only occurs at the static interface between the photocatalyst and RhB solution. The performance of the Ag3PO4 nanodots (curve b) was rather poor, which is close to the blank experimental result (curve c). However, the UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite (curve a) still showed excellent catalytic activity with 90% of RhB degraded in 40 min, which is surprisingly higher than that of the pristine Ag3PO4. The rate constant of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 (Fig. S7†) reached 0.051 min−1, exceeding that of the pristine Ag3PO4 by a factor of 12.5. The efficient utilization of natural sunlight without extra mechanical stirring and ease of post-separation of the photocatalyst from the reaction media indicates that UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 may have potential for scaled-up water treatment.

3.4 Photocatalytic mechanism of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4
It is well known that the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes is normally activated by reactive species including superoxide radicals (˙O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and photo-generated holes (h+).50,51 Thus, to detect the reactive species of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 in the photocatalytic degradation, ESR and radical trapping experiments were carried out. The content of ˙O2− and ˙OH was first measured by ESR. As shown in Fig. 8A, DMPO-˙O2− has a strong signal under stimulated sunlight irradiation, while no obvious signal was observed in the dark. Similarly, a weak four-line spectrum with the ratio of 1:2:2:1 (Fig. 8B) was observed, which is attributed to DMPO-˙OH.

The possible active species generated from UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 were further determined by radical trapping tests. Three types of scavengers, namely, isopropanol (IPA), EDTA, and benzoquinone (BQ), were separately added to the reaction medium for the decomposition of RhB dye for consuming ˙OH, h+, and ˙O2−, respectively.26,48,52 After being trapped by the corresponding scavenger, the active species will be quenched in the photocatalytic process, and thus, the degradation efficiency will decrease, which indicates the existence of the corresponding active species. As shown in Fig. 8C, the degradation efficiency of RhB decreased after the addition of IPA, BQ and EDTA, implying that ˙OH, ˙O2− and h+ all existed in the photocatalytic process. The degradation efficiency decreased from 63% to 25% and 20% with the addition of BQ and EDTA more significantly than that of IPA, suggesting that ˙O2−and h+ play an important role during the photocatalytic process, respectively.
Based on the detected reactive species and the upconversion spectra of UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4, the sunlight-driven photocatalytic mechanism for UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 is illustrated in Scheme 2. During the photodegradation process, RhB molecules in solution will continuously be adsorbed and enriched around Ag3PO4 by the mSiO2 shell (pollutant enrichment). Upon sunlight irradiation, the Vis light is directly absorbed by Ag3PO4 and the NIR light is converted to Vis light and utilized by Ag3PO4. The detailed upconversion process can be illustrated as follows. Firstly, the sensitizer ions Yb3+ absorb the NIR light of sunlight in the Yb3+ and Tm3+ co-doped UCNPs. When the excited Yb3+ ions relax from the 2F5/2 level to the 2F7/2 level, the energy is transferred to the nearby Tm3+ ions.53,54 The sequential energy absorbance from Yb3+ to Tm3+ ions populates Tm3+ to 1D2 and 1G4. Then the excited Tm3+ falls to lower energy levels with 1G4 to 3H6 and 1D2 to 3F4 transitions emitting blue light at 475 and 450 nm, respectively. The band gap of Ag3PO4 is around 2.36 eV,55 and thus, upconversion emissions from UCNP can be absorbed by the Ag3PO4 nanodots deposited on the silica layer. Under the activation of these upconversion emissions, the excited Ag3PO4 can produce h+ and electrons (e−) in the valence band and conduction band, respectively. Then the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of silver phosphate move to the interface between Ag3PO4 and mSiO2 nanoparticles.48 The electrons trapped in the interface supposedly react with the dissolved oxygen molecules and generate ˙O2−.48,56 The h+ in the valence band is trapped by surface hydroxyl groups or H2O at the catalyst surface to yield ˙OH. These reactive species can oxidize organic pollutants in the solution. The above steps can be summarized into five equations as follows: UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 + hv → e− + h+(1) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(2) h+ + H2O/OH− → H+ + ˙OH(3) ˙O2− + RhB → degraded products(4) ˙OH + RhB → degraded products(5)

Overall, through the synergy of broadband absorption and pollutant adsorption-enrichment, UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 can effectively utilize sunlight for highly efficient photocatalysis.
4. Conclusion
A hierarchical broad-spectrum photocatalyst with pollutant adsorption-enrichment capability to enable natural sunlight-driven photocatalysis was synthesized by decorating Ag3PO4 nanodots on mSiO2-coated UCNPs. The UCNPs play a role of broadening the spectrum by upconverting the NIR light into visible light, which can be absorbed by Ag3PO4 for photocatalysis. The functionalized hydrophilic mSiO2 shell not only enables the decoration of Ag3PO4 nanodots but is also capable of adsorbing and enriching pollutants around Ag3PO4. Upon natural sunlight irradiation, UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 showed a superior photoactivity with k = 0.24 and 0.051 min−1 under dynamic and static conditions, exceeding that of pure Ag3PO4 by a factor of 4.2 and 12.5, respectively. The UCNP@mSiO2-Ag3PO4 nanocomposite also showed excellent photodegradation efficiency without extra mechanical stirring owing to its pollutant absorption capability, which may have potential for future scaled-up water treatment. The synergistic effect between broadband absorption and pollutant adsorption-enrichment can be a promising strategy for realizing efficient sunlight-driven photocatalysis.
