    , Accepted 2nd August 2017First published on 2nd August 2017AbstractThe concept of efficient electrolysis by linking photoelectrochemical biphasic H2 evolution and water oxidation processes in the cathodic and anodic compartments of an H-cell, respectively, is introduced. Overpotentials at the cathode and anode are minimised by incorporating light-driven elements into both biphasic reactions. The concepts viability is demonstrated by electrochemical H2 production from water splitting utilising a polarised water–organic interface in the cathodic compartment of a prototype H-cell. At the cathode the reduction of decamethylferrocenium cations ([Cp2*Fe(III)]+) to neutral decamethylferrocene (Cp2*Fe(II)) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solvent takes place at the solid electrode/oil interface. This electron transfer process induces the ion transfer of a proton across the immiscible water/oil interface to maintain electroneutrality in the oil phase. The oil-solubilised proton immediately reacts with Cp2*Fe(II) to form the corresponding hydride species, [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+. Subsequently, [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+ spontaneously undergoes a chemical reaction in the oil phase to evolve hydrogen gas (H2) and regenerate [Cp2*Fe(III)]+, whereupon this catalytic Electrochemical, Chemical, Chemical (ECC′) cycle is repeated. During biphasic electrolysis, the stability and recyclability of the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) redox couple were confirmed by chronoamperometric measurements and, furthermore, the steady-state concentration of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ monitored in situ by UV/vis spectroscopy. Post-biphasic electrolysis, the presence of H2 in the headspace of the cathodic compartment was established by sampling with gas chromatography. The rate of the biphasic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was enhanced by redox electrocatalysis in the presence of floating catalytic molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) microparticles at the immiscible water/oil interface. The use of a superhydrophobic organic electrolyte salt was critical to ensure proton transfer from water to oil, and not anion transfer from oil to water, in order to maintain electroneutrality after electron transfer. The design, testing and successful optimisation of the operation of the biphasic electrolysis cell under dark conditions with Cp2*Fe(II) lays the foundation for the achievement of photo-induced biphasic water electrolysis at low overpotentials using another metallocene, decamethylrutheneocene (Cp2*Ru(II)). Critically, Cp2*Ru(II) may be recycled at a potential more positive than that of proton reduction in DCE.
Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) production from water splitting using electricity produced from diverse renewable resources (wind, solar, hydro, etc.) is a technological concept that lies at the heart of current efforts to power society with limitless clean energy.1 Innovative approaches to water electrolysis are subject to intense research efforts,2 particularly to minimise overpotentials (energy losses) for the half-reactions, the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic water oxidation reaction (WOR).3
Liquid–liquid interfaces, or interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), possess features suitable to engineer innovative artificial photosynthetic Z-schemes capable of driving energetically uphill chemical reactions.4 Water–organic interfaces can be “dye-sensitised” with molecular photosensitisers,5 or trap semiconductor nanomaterials through interfacial surface tension.6 A hydrophobicity gradient across the ITIES facilitates spatial separation of charge carriers on either side of the interface.7 Aligning the latter with the interface's defect-free nature, electron–hole pair recombination can be reduced. Importantly, water–organic interfaces can be polarised either via application of external voltage by a potentiostat or chemically by dissolving a common ion in both phases.8 This key feature provides a mechanism to controllably enhance the efficiency of interfacial charge transfer, ranging from ion transfer (IT), to electron transfer (ET) to photo-induced electron transfer (PET).
Rastgar et al. demonstrated that such a Z-scheme can enhance the photochemical behaviour of hyperbranched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) semiconductor nanostructures for visible light-driven oxidation of water.9 BiVO4 nanoparticles were assembled at a water–butyronitrile interface, the interface was polarised chemically by distribution of hydrophobic tetraalkylammonium cations, and an oil soluble Co(III) complex, [Co(bpy)3](PF6)3, was present in the organic phase to act as an electron acceptor. Detrimental interfacial recombination of electron–hole pairs was minimised through the advanced high-surface area hyperbranching structure of the BiVO4 nanoparticles and defect-free nature of the water–organic interfacial support. Combining the latter with the additional thermodynamic driving force for interfacial PET from water to the Co(III) acceptor molecule provided by chemically polarising the water–organic interface, ultimately, led to improved WOR activity compared with BiVO4 photocatalyst powders dispersed in homogenous aqueous solutions.9
A key aspect of Rastgar et al.'s research is the electrochemically reversible nature of the Co(III)/Co(II) electron acceptor redox couple. This feature allowed the PET process taking place at the BiVO4 functionalised interface to be probed by recycling the Co(III)/Co(II) species at the tip of a microelectrode immersed in the organic phase using a scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) configuration.9 The reversible nature of the Co(III)/Co(II) electron acceptor redox couple also facilitates integration of this light-driven biphasic approach to the WOR into the anodic compartment of an electrolysis H-cell (Scheme 1). The advantage is that the overall energy required to achieve the WOR is split between energy provided electrically (to electrochemically oxidise photo-reduced [Co(bpy)3]2+) and energy provided from light (to induce the interfacial PET process). Thus, the electrical energy provided from renewable resources can be utilised much more efficiently than via an approach where 100% of the driving force for the WOR is provided electrochemically.
 Scheme 1  Concept of water splitting by electrolysis using an H-cell incorporating photo-driven biphasic H2 evolution in the cathodic compartment and photo-driven biphasic water oxidation in the anodic compartment. 
Polarised water–organic interfaces can also act as “proton pumps”.10 Positive polarisation of the interface (by a potentiostat or chemically) may induce either direct transfer of protons from the water to organic phase, or protons may undergo facilitated ion transfer (FIT) if a suitable molecule in the organic phase is capable of interfacial proton complexation.10 In a series of articles, Girault and co-workers demonstrated that various metallocenes are capable of the latter, forming hydride species.10–13 Depending on the nature of the metallocene-hydride, H2 is evolved homogeneously in the organic phase either spontaneously or by photo-exciting the hydride (see ESI-2, ESI† for a more detailed discussion on this point).

Table 1 summaries the relative formal reduction potentials of a series of metallocenes in a 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) organic phase. Proton reduction is thermodynamically more favourable in an organic solvent, such as DCE, than in water.14 By harnessing the “proton pumping” capabilities of the water–organic interface, H2 is evolved using mild oil soluble electron donor species with high (positive) redox potentials. Thus, in one respect, less electrical energy needs to be applied to an electrode surface to recycle the oxidised species after H2 evolution with such electrochemically reversible electron donors. However, it must be noted these energy gains are negated by the Gibbs energy expended to transfer the protons from the water to oil phase initially.

To overcome the latter, Rivier et al. established that decamethylruthenocene (Cp2*Ru(II); Cp* = C5Me5) is capable of reducing organic solubilised protons (through a hydride intermediate) under photo-activation via a catalytic Electrochemical, Chemical, Chemical (ECC′) mechanism (Scheme 2).18 In the ECC′ mechanism the overall energy required to achieve proton reduction is split between energy provided electrically (to electrochemically reduce photo-oxidised [Cp2*Ru(III)]+) and energy provided from light (to excite the hydride to evolve H2). Therefore, as with the biphasic WOR, the driving force for the HER is not solely electrochemical in nature. This is reflected by the regeneration of [Cp2*Ru(III)]+ at a more positive potential than that of proton reduction in DCE.18
 Scheme 2  Mechanism of the catalytic Electrochemical, Chemical, Chemical (ECC′) reduction of protons by Cp2*Ru(II) in the presence of protons in DCE (adapted from ref. 18). Cp2*Ru(II) is a weak reductant, requiring photoactivation of the hydride to reduce organic solubilised protons . 
A key finding was a set of experimental conditions to stabilise [Cp2*Ru(III)]+ on a time-scale sufficient to permit its electrochemical regeneration.18 Thus, as illustrated in Scheme 1, the latter allows the reversible nature of [Cp2*Ru(III)]+/Cp2*Ru(II) to be exploited by integration of this light-driven biphasic approach to the HER into the cathodic compartment of an electrolysis H-cell. Critically, with Cp2*Ru(II), the energy saved recycling the oxidised mediator species in DCE after photo-induced H2 evolution (in comparison to directly reducing aqueous protons) is greater than the energy required to pump protons across the interface.
Considering Scheme 1 in its totality, protons released during the photo-driven WOR in the anodic compartment are subsequently pumped across the water–organic interface in the cathodic compartment to facilitate the photo-driven HER in the organic phase. Electrons released during the WOR are shuttled to the anode via the Co(III)/Co(II) redox species and used to regenerate the oxidised [Cp2*Ru(III)]+ species at the cathode. As discussed vide infra, matching the redox potentials of the redox species in both H-cell compartments is of the upmost importance. The electrochemical driving force required to drive water-splitting is provided from renewable sources and overpotentials at the cathode and anode are minimised by incorporating light-driven elements into both biphasic reactions.
Herein, the aim is to develop an electrolysis H-cell prototype to highlight the feasibility of using biphasic chemistry to achieve the cathodic HER half-reaction. The purpose is to optimise the general chemistry underpinning the use of metallocenes in such an H-cell. Thus, the biphasic HER was carried out with well-characterised decamethylferrocene (Cp2*Fe(II)) via an ECC′ mechanism (Scheme 3). Ultimately, Cp2*Fe(II) will not be suitable for the final biphasic electrolysis design as the driving force for the reaction is purely electrochemical and, thus, presents no advantage in comparison to electrolysis in aqueous solutions. However, lessons learned with this model system are vital to inform the design of the energy efficient biphasic photo-electrolysis cells incorporating Cp2*Ru(II).
 Scheme 3  Mechanism of the catalytic Electrochemical, Chemical, Chemical (ECC′) reduction of protons by Cp2*Fe(II) in the presence of protons in DCE. Cp2*Fe(II) is a strong enough reductant to reduce organic solubilised protons  without the need for photactivation. 
Experimental methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were used as received. All aqueous solutions were prepared with ultra pure water (Millipore Milli-Q, specific resistivity 18.2 MΩ cm). The solvents used were 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE, ≥99.8%, Fluka), dichloromethane (DCM, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), diethyl ether (Et2O, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Merck) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, Merck). Decamethylferrocence (Cp2*Fe(II), 99%) and ferrocene (Cp2Fe(II), 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Molybendum carbide (Mo2C, ∼325 mesh, ≥99.5%), silver nitrate (AgNO3, ≥99%), type II 3.5 mm silica gel beads, tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, ≥97%), tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate (THxABF4, ≥97%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, ≥99%), bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium chloride (BACl, 97%) and the Nafion® perfluorintaed membrane (Nafion® 117, thickness 0.007 in.) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate diethyletherate ([Li(OEt2)2]TB) was received from Boulder Scientific Company.
BACl and [Li(OEt2)2]TB were used to prepare bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (BATB) by metathesis of equimolar solutions of BACl and [Li(OEt2)]TB in a methanol–water (2:1 v/v) mixture. The resulting precipitates were filtered, washed and recrystallised from acetone. The synthetic procedures to prepare dry powders of the strong organic tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate diethyl etherate acid ([H(OEt2)2]TB) and the decamethylferrocenium cation ([Cp2*Fe(III)]TB) are described in detail in the ESI† (ESI-1).
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed in organic media, namely DCE, with either 100 mM THxABF4, 100 mM TBAPF6 or 100 mM BATB as the organic supporting electrolyte salt. Thus, to facilitate these measurements it was essential to prepare a robust Ag+/Ag double-junction organic reference electrode (DJ-ORE) capable of operating in solvents, such as DCE, that damage typical Vycor® tips and polyolefin tubing. Previously, Vycor® was successfully replaced by porous silica gel beads (type II 3.5 mm silica gel beads from Sigma-Aldrich, typically used for desiccation) by Vrubel et al.19 These silica gel beads require pre-treatment steps if the reference electrode is used in an aqueous solution. However, herein with organic solutions, the silica gel beads did not need to be pre-treated and were directly attached to the electrode. When the organic reference solutions were inserted into the electrode the silica gel beads became “wet”. Once this occurred it was essential that they were not left to dry out at any stage or else they would crack. A detailed description of how to construct the DJ-ORE is provided in the in the ESI† (ESI-1).
Electrochemical measurements to determine the onset potential of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) at the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (geometric area of 0.264 cm2) in DCE were carried out in a three-electrode configuration, with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and the organic DJ-ORE discussed above as the reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were obtained using a PGSTAT 30 potentiostat (Metrohm, CH), under anaerobic conditions in a glovebox and using degassed DCE solutions.
The electrolysis H-cell prototype is shown in Fig. 1. Further images of the H-cell are provided in Fig. S1 and ESI-1, ESI.† This experimental setup allowed the continuous measurement of the UV/vis spectra of the organic phase in situ as a set potential was applied to the glassy carbon working electrode during chronoamperometry. Post-electrolysis the head-space gas was analysed by gas chromatography. Three different biphasic electrochemical cell configurations were studied, as described in Scheme 4, probing the influence of the nature of the organic electrolyte salt and the presence of an interfacial H2 evolution catalyst on the biphasic electrolysis induced HER.

Chronoamperometry measurements with the sealed H-cell were carried out under aerobic conditions with no degassing of aqueous or organic solutions. The organic phase was stirred to enhance diffusion of the metallocene species to the glassy carbon electrode surface. Initial biphasic electrolysis experiments (data not shown) indicated that 50 mM BATB did not provide adequate conductivity to the DCE phase to obtain high current densities. Thus, 100 mM BATB was found to be optimal, i.e. the lowest concentration of BATB that gave large current densities.
Analysis of H2 gas evolved
Post-biphasic electrolysis, one milliliter samples of the headspace gas in the working electrode compartment were obtained using a lock-in syringe with a push–pull valve (SGE Analytical Sciences) and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography (GC) using a Perkin-Elmer GC (Clarus 400, with 5 Å molecular sieves, an 80/100 mesh and a 20 μL injection loop) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The carrier gas was argon.
UV/vis spectroscopy
UV/vis spectra of the decamethylferrocenium cation, [Cp2*Fe(III)]+, were measured in situ in the DCE phase during biphasic electrolysis on an Ocean Optics CHEM2000 spectrophotometer with an Ocean Optics DH-2000-BAL balanced deuterium halogen light source. An Ocean Optics T300-UV-VIS transmission dip probe was coupled to both the light source and spectrometer with two optical fiber cables. The stainless steel probe tip is resistant to the DCE solution. Light is directed via one fiber through the open path containing the DCE solution, then is reflected by a mirror and redirected back to a receiver fiber that returns the light to the spectrometer. The total path length was 10 mm. UV/vis scans were taken at regular intervals over a period of 22 hours. A molar extinction coefficient (ε) of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ in DCE (λmax = 779 nm) was determined previously to be 0.632 mM−1 cm−1.20
Results and discussion
Matching the redox potentials of the lipophilic mediators in the anodic and cathodic compartment of the biphasic electrolysis H-cell to achieve efficient electrolysis
The concept of mediated water splitting by electrolysis using an H-cell incorporating biphasic systems, as described in Scheme 1, can be summarised by the following set of equations:
Anodic light-driven biphasic water oxidation reaction (WOR):9 (1) 2[Co(III)(bpy)3]3+(o) + 2e− → 2[Co(II)(bpy)3]2+(o)(2)
Cathodic light-driven biphasic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER):13,18 (3) (4)
Regeneration of the lipophilic electron acceptor and donor species: (5)where (w), (o), (g) and (int.) denote the aqueous phase, organic phase, gaseous phase and liquid–liquid interface, respectively. IT means “ion transfer”.
To maximise the efficiency of this system it is critical that the reversible redox couples in the anodic and cathodic compartments can regenerate each other spontaneously (from a thermodynamic viewpoint) as described by eqn (5). In other words, it would be ideal if no, or an absolute minimum, additional external electrochemical driving force (from renewable resources as described in Scheme 1) need be applied to drive the reduction of [Cp2*Ru(III)]+(o) by [Co(II)(bpy)3]2+(o). The possibility of the latter is determined by their formal reduction potentials in the oil phase. Thus, the formal reduction potential of the reversible electron acceptor [Co(III)(bpy)3]3+/[Co(II)(bpy)3]2+ redox couple was determined in DCE, see Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the reversible [Co(III)(bpy)3]3+/[Co(II)(bpy)3]2+ redox couple in DCE. All CVs were calibrated versus the [Cp2Fe(III)]+/Cp2Fe(II) redox couple by using the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) redox couple as an internal calibrant. The formal reduction potential of the latter is −0.600 V vs. [Cp2Fe(III)]+/Cp2Fe(II) (see Table 1). The black CV is of 0.1 mM [Co(II)(bpy)3]TB2 and 0.1 mM Cp2*Fe(II). The blue and red CVs are of 0.1 mM [Co(II)(bpy)3]TB2 only recorded over shorter and longer polarisable potential windows, respectively. The organic supporting electrolyte was 100 mM TBAPF6. All CVs were obtained under anaerobic conditions, using degassed DCE solutions, in a glovebox and at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Glassy carbon and platinum disc electrodes were used as the working and counter electrodes respectively, while the reference electrode was a Ag+/Ag DJ-ORE. 
From the CVs shown in Fig. 2,  was determined as −0.046 V vs. [Cp2Fe(III)]+/Cp2Fe(II). Therefore,  Since the latter is more negative than  (see Table 1), [Co(II)(bpy)3]2+ can spontaneously reduce [Cp2*Ru(III)]+ as described in eqn (5).
Proof-of-concept biphasic electrolysis experiments
Initially, in the cathodic compartment of the H-cell, the reversible electron donor was present 100% in its oxidised form [Cp2*Fe(III)]+; synthesised with a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-borate counter anion (TB−). During biphasic electrolysis a sufficiently negative potential was applied to the glassy carbon working electrode to reduce [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) (using electrons released from the WOR at the platinum electrode in the anodic compartment), but not so negative as to induce direct H2 evolution at the working electrode surface. This precise potential was determined by cyclic voltammetry in acidified DCE solutions containing [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ as −1.164 V vs. [Cp2Fe(III)]+/Cp2Fe(II) (Cp = C5H5), Fig. S2 and ESI-3, ESI.† On top of the organic phase was an acidified aqueous solution. Consequently, to maintain electroneutrality of the organic phase upon reduction of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+, either a cation must transfer from water to DCE, or an anion from DCE to water. During biphasic H2 evolution the former occurs with a proton undergoing FIT to form the hydride species, [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+. Thus, the organic electrolyte anion must have a more positive formal ion transfer potential from water to DCE  than that of a proton (i.e., more energy is required to transfer the anion from DCE to water than the proton from water to DCE). To highlight the critical role of the organic electrolyte anion in achieving biphasic H2 evolution in the cathodic compartment, two biphasic electrolysis cells were tested (Scheme 4); cell 1 with tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate (THxABF4) and cell 2 with bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene) ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (BATB) as the organic electrolyte.

 values for all aqueous and organic electrolyte ions studied, and also [Cp2*Fe(III)]+, are summarised in Table 2. BF4− has a less positive  than a proton. Thus, during biphasic electrolysis no protons were transferred from water to DCE, [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+ was not formed, and consequently no H2 evolved. The latter also means [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ cannot be regenerated (Scheme 5(A)). The complete conversion of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) was demonstrated by chronoamperometry with the current density at the electrode (corresponding to the reduction of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+) approaching zero after 3 hours of electrolysis (Fig. 3A, black trace). Furthermore, total charge passed (Q = 1.688 C) precisely matched the quantity of charge required to fully convert 17.5 μmol of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ present to Cp2*Fe(II) (Fig. 3(B), black trace). Finally, the UV/vis absorbance signal for [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ at 779 nm completely disappeared after 3 hours (Fig. 3(C), black trace) and no H2 was detected by GC in the head-space of the cathodic compartment post-biphasic electrolysis (Fig. S3 and ESI-4, ESI†).

 Scheme 5  Mechanisms taking place in the three biphasic electrolysis cells investigated, highlighting (i) the critical role of the organic electrolyte anion on the ability to recycle the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) redox couple at the glassy carbon electrode and (ii) the change in mechanism in the presence of an interfacial H2 evolution catalyst. The latter dramatically increases the rates of H2 evolution at the interface and, concomitantly, recycling of the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) redox couple at the glassy carbon electrode.

(A) Current density (j/mA cm−2) and (B) total charge passed (Q/C) as a function of time for each biphasic electrochemical cell. (C and D) Monitoring changes in the UV/vis absorbance (λmax = 779 nm) for [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ during biphasic electrolysis. The dashed black lines in (A–C) represent the time period during which dissolved O2 in the DCE phase was fully consumed. The dashed orange line in (B) represents the theoretical quantity of charge that must be passed for the complete conversion of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) in DCE (Q = znF = 1.688 C, where z = 1 and n = 17.5 μmol), assuming Cp2*Fe(II) formed does not subsequently undergo oxidation. 
The organic anion TB− has a more positive  than a proton. Thus, during biphasic electrolysis protons are transferred from water to DCE, [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+ is formed, H2 evolved and [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ regenerated (Scheme 5(B)). Two plateaus in the current density were observed during electrolysis (Fig. 3(A), blue trace). As the aqueous and organic solutions were not degassed before sealing the biphasic electrolysis cell, O2 was present upon commencing electrolysis. Thus, the plateau covering the initial 3 hours represents proton reduction in DCE via Cp2*Fe(II) to H2O2, and not H2, as discussed previously.21 Once all O2 was converted to H2O2, a new plateau was observed until electrolysis ceased representing subsequent proton reduction to H2. The reduction of O2 to H2O2 is thermodynamically more favourable than H2 evolution in DCE.14,21–25 Thus, kinetically the rate of H2O2 formation far exceeds that of H2 evolution (especially in the absence of a H2 evolution catalyst). Accordingly, during H2O2 formation, [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ was regenerated at a much faster rate as reflected in the higher current densities (Fig. 3A, blue trace) and quicker accumulation of total charge passed (Fig. 3(B), blue trace) during electrolysis prior to O2 depletion. The total charge passed with TB− as the organic anion (Q = 10.505 C) indicates that, over 22 hours, each [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ molecule was consumed at the electrode and regenerated in the organic phase over 6 times. Both plateaus were again observed by UV/vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3(C), blue trace). The transition from H2O2 to H2 formation via Cp2*Fe(II) is clearly evident, and the rapid kinetics of H2O2 formation and [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ regeneration were indicated by a marginal dip in absorbance (approximately 4 to 8%) initially. Finally, H2 was detected by GC in the head-space of the cathodic compartment post-biphasic electrolysis (Fig. S3 and ESI-4, ESI†).
The kinetics of biphasic H2 evolution via Cp2*Fe(II) can be dramatically improved by either generating H2 evolution catalysts in situ at the interface (e.g., by reducing aqueous soluble Pt or Pd salts at the interface in the presence of an oil-based electron donor)15,29 or, more simply, by floating pre-formed H2 evolution catalytic nanoparticles20,30–39 or nanocomposites40–42 at the water–organic interface (Scheme 5(C)). These floating catalysts can significantly improve efficiency in terms of turnover frequency of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ consumption/regeneration cycles. To demonstrate the latter, biphasic electrolysis was performed with Mo2C microparticles floating at the interface and 100 mM BATB as the organic electrolyte (cell 3, Scheme 4). Mo2C is capable of catalysing both O2 reduction and H2 evolution.43,44 As the rates of O2 reduction are already rapid with Cp2*Fe(II), improvements in the rate (as indicated by higher current densities during electrolysis) are difficult to discern. However, after O2 depletion, the rate of H2 evolution was clearly enhanced in the presence of Mo2C, with significant increases in current density (Fig. 3(A), red trace) and quicker accumulation of total charge passed (Fig. 3(B), red trace) during electrolysis in comparison to the identical experiment without Mo2C (Fig. 3(A) and (B), blue traces). The current density with Mo2C present is steady over the 22 hour period studied, indicating stability of the catalyst during biphasic electrolysis. The total charge passed with Mo2C present and TB− as the organic anion (Q = 13.801 C) indicates that, over 22 hours, each [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ molecule was recycled over 8 times. This represents a significant 25% improvement in the efficiency of biphasic electrolysis over non-catalysed conditions. UV/vis spectroscopy indicated a small improvement in the kinetics of H2O2 formation and major improvement in kinetics of H2 evolution with Mo2C present (Fig. 3(C), red trace). After O2 depletion, the absorbance plateau for [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ increased from 84% of the maximum possible (Fig. 3(D), blue trace) to 94% (Fig. 3(D), red trace) for uncatalysed versus Mo2C catalysed conditions. Finally, H2 was detected by GC in the head-space of the cathodic compartment post-biphasic electrolysis (Fig. S3 and ESI-4, ESI†).
Determination of the interfacial Galvani potential difference (Δwoϕ) established at the polarised water–organic interface for each biphasic electrochemical cell during electrolysis
The UV/vis spectroscopic data provides a precise measurement of the concentration of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ during the course of electrolysis. Thus, with this information, the concentrations of protons pumped into DCE (for cells 2 and 3) and BF4− extracted to water (for cell 1) to maintain electroneutrality upon reduction of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ were determined. The complexation constant of Cp2*Fe(II) with protons is quite small (5 × 102 L mol−1 s−1),21 and [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+ formation has been noted as being reversible with the weakly coordinating proton.21 Therefore, all of the missing [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ at any time (t = x s) during electrolysis (due to its reduction at the glassy carbon electrode) is assumed to be present as Cp2*Fe(II) with effectively zero [Cp2*Fe(IV)(H)]+ in the DCE. From UV/vis spectroscopy, the concentration of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ is known both initially at  and at , and therefore the concentration of Cp2*Fe(II) present in DCE at t = x s was calculated as  
For biphasic electrochemical cells 2 and 3 with BATB electrolyte present, the concentration of protons present in DCE to maintain electroneutrality upon reduction of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ at t = x s was calculated as  
With this knowledge, the Nernst equation for ion transfer at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) was applied to determine the interfacial Galvani potential difference (Δwoϕ) at any particular time during electrolysis,  where  (see Table 2) and . For all experiments . The volumes of the aqueous and organic phases in the cathodic compartment of the H-cell were approximately equal.
As discussed extensively, upon reduction of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ during electrolysis with THxABF4 organic electrolyte, protons are not transferred to the DCE phase and instead BF4− is transferred to the aqueous phase. Thus, the concentration of BF4− remaining in DCE at t = x s is  
For all experiments . Again, it is important to note that the volumes of the aqueous and organic phases in the cathodic compartment of the H-cell were approximately equal. With this knowledge Δwoϕ for biphasic electrochemical cell 1 was calculated by applying the Nernst equation for BF4− ion transfer as follows,  where  (see Table 1) and . Δwoϕ was plotted versus time for each of the three biphasic electrochemical cells studied in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Variation of the interfacial Galvani potential difference (Δwoϕ) at the polarised water–organic interface during biphasic electrolysis. 
The positive polarization of the water–organic interface to 0.441 and 0.411 V for cells 2 and 3, respectively, with the exceptionally hydrophobic TB− organic electrolyte anion induced proton transfer from water to DCE. On the other hand, with cell 1 and the less hydrophobic BF4− organic electrolyte anion, the moderate positive polarization of 0.093 V was not sufficient to induce any proton transfer considering  (see Table 2).
Determination of the Nernst potential established in the organic phase for each biphasic electrochemical cell during electrolysis: evidence of redox electrocatalysis by floating Mo2C
The Nernst potential in the organic phase versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at any particular time during electrolysis was determined as follows,  and plotted versus time for each of the three biphasic electrochemical cells studied in Fig. 5. ,15 see Table 1.
 Fig. 5  Variation of the Nernst potential in the organic phase versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), , during biphasic electrolysis.  was calculated as −0.099, 0.081 and 0.115 V for biphasic electrolysis cells 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

 depends only on the ratio of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) in DCE during biphasic electrolysis. With THxABF4 as the supporting organic electrolyte, as no protons were pumped into the DCE phase, bulk electrolysis of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) took place,  moved to more reducing (negative) values and the ratio of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) reached a steady-state with the electrode (the glassy carbon electrode was polarised versus a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in the organic phase, and thus Δwoϕ did not influence the Nernst potential for cell 1).
With BATB as the supporting organic electrolyte, protons were pumped into the DCE phase (cell 2). Once more, the ratio of [Cp2*Fe(III)]+ to Cp2*Fe(II) reached a steady-state. However, this was not a steady-state with the electrode. Instead, a substantial current flowed for the entire duration of electrolysis and  was a measure of the driving force for the reaction at the electrode and the driving force for the homogenous H2 evolution reaction in DCE. A 35 mV positive shift in  to less reducing potentials was observed when Mo2C was present (cell 3) and this indicated that a process known as redox electrocatalysis takes place with Mo2C.30,45–47 When more than one redox couple is present in DCE, as is the case for the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) and H+/½H2 redox couples herein, a thermodynamic equilibrium will be reached between both redox couples. However, due to kinetic limitations, the system may remain out of equilibrium. Thus, Mo2C can catalyse Fermi level equilibration between the two redox couples in solution. The net result is that higher current densities were obtained when Mo2C was present (see Fig. 3(A)), yet 30 mV less polarization at the ITIES and 35 mV smaller driving force for the hydrogen evolution (as calculated from the Nernst potential for the [Cp2*Fe(III)]+/Cp2*Fe(II) couple) was required to achieve this.
Conclusions
A completely new approach to electrolysis incorporating photoelectrochemical biphasic H2 evolution and water oxidation processes into the cathodic and anodic compartments of an H-cell, respectively, is introduced. Critically, both are achieved using reversible redox couples in the organic phases. The purpose of the polarised water–organic interface is multifold, ranging from acting as a proton pump to providing an ideal environment to facilitate photo-generated electron–hole separation. Using an H-cell prototype capable of biphasic H2 evolution with a lipophilic, electrochemically reversible electron donor (Cp2*Fe(II)), the vital necessity of super-hydrophobic organic electrolyte anions in the cathodic organic phase (to ensure proton transfer) was identified, as was the ability to enhance biphasic electrolysis efficiency by redox electrocatalysis using interfacial floating catalytic nanomaterials. Of course, the utilization of halogenated solvents on a large scale is very problematic from an environmental and health and safety point of view. However, for practical systems, toxic DCE could be replaced by less toxic trifluorotoluene,48 nitriles9 or a series of recently proposed ketone49,50 solvents suitable for electrochemistry at liquid–liquid interfaces.
