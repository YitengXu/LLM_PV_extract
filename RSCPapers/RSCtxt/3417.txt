The fine hierarchical butterfly wing structures of BVOB@xC were confirmed by the SEM and TEM observations. The doped carbon in BVOB@xC was formed in situ from the biotemplate during a calcination process and the amount of doping could be controlled from 0.6–2.4 wt% by adjusting the calcination temperature. It was found that the sample calcined at 400 °C with a carbon content of 1.5 wt% (BVOB@1.5C) demonstrated the best photocatalytic activity in both photocatalytic degradation and O2 evolution from water splitting (ca. 800 μmol L−1). Under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the photocatalytic O2 evolution from BVOB@1.5C (ca. 800 μmol L−1, after 5 h) is 16 times higher than that of pure BiVO4 powder (BVOP) (ca. 49 μmol L−1), and the photocatalytic decomposition efficiency of MB for BVOB@1.5C is 6.3 times higher than that of pure BVOP. The improved photocatalytic performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of the unique morphology and composition control. It is believed that the hierarchical butterfly wing structures of BVOB@1.5C contribute significantly to the absorption enhancement under visible light (480 to 700 nm), which was supported by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements. The photocatalytic performance was further enhanced by the C-doping as it improves the efficient separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and holes, as evidenced by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. This strategy provides a simple one-step method to fabricate a high-performance photocatalyst, which enables the simultaneous control of the crystal phase, morphology, and carbon element doping.1 IntroductionArtificial photosynthesis (APS), which aims to emulate natural photosynthesis (NPS), is a potential technology for the solar-to-chemical energy-conversion process.1 The major breakthrough of a single-step system that uses a semiconductor was reported in 1972 by Honda and Fujishima, who used a TiO2 film as a photoelectrode to produce oxygen and hydrogen from water.2 Since then, intense research has been carried out and a few of novel photocatalysts, such as CdS, NiO, ZnS, SrTiO3, etc., were developed,3–6 however they are only active under UV light irradiation due to their wide band gaps. As compared with NPS, it remains a great challenge to construct efficient photocatalysts, which are active under visible light. To meet the challenge, a significant amount of effort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of visible-light responsive photocatalysts, such as BiVO4, BaCrO4, WO3, etc.7–9 Among them, bismuth vanadate has received significant attention in recent years.Monoclinic BiVO4 (mBiVO4), which is nontoxic and chemically stable in aqueous solution under irradiation, is a well-known photocatalyst under visible light owing to a suitable band-gap energy (Eg = 2.4 eV).7 A number of approaches, such as co-precipitation, hydrothermal treatment, electrodeposition method, and sol–gel method, have been developed to synthesize mBiVO4.10–13 Among them, the sol–gel approach performs perfectly as it can be used to form complicated morphology at lower reaction temperatures and the first BiVO4 thin film fabricated by using this method was dated to 1957.14 However, the photocatalytic activity of pure BiVO4 is limited due to its poor charge-transport characteristics and the weak surface adsorption abilities.15 Numerous attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4, including heterojunction structure formation,16–18 loading co-catalysts,11,19 impurity doping,20–22 and morphology control.23–25Recently, researchers have found that hierarchical structures can play a significant role in the photocatalytic performance of some photocatalysts.26,27 It is considered that hierarchical structures can enhance the capture efficiency of incident light and the transfer rate of reactant molecules and provide more active sites. In 2012, a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3D-OM) BiVO4 was prepared using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-templating, which showed a promising photocatalytic degradation of phenol in the presence of H2O2 under visible light, owing to the high surface area (18–24 m2 g−1) and surface oxygen vacancy density.28 Unfortunately, the multiple processing steps and long reaction time make it difficult for practical use. In fact, doping with a suitable element (N, Mo, C, P, etc.) is another easier route to improve the photocatalytic properties and it has been shown that the electronic and catalytic properties of the base material can be altered by the doped cations.20–22 For example, doping with molybdenum to replace a small fraction of vanadium in a BiVO4 photoanode was found to improve the photocatalytic activity for water oxidation because of the enhanced conductivity and a possible increased hole diffusion.22 Furthermore, Hong et al. investigated carbon-loaded BiVO4 composites prepared by an impregnation method and found that the 3 wt% carbon-loaded BiVO4 showed the best photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B dye solution under visible light irradiation (95% after 180 min irradiation). They believed that more active sites were created and optical absorption was improved by the existence of carbon nano-islands deposited on the surface of the BiVO4.29 Meanwhile, studies have proven that carbon can act as a sensitizer and transfer electrons to trigger the formation of very reactive radicals and facilitate the interface reaction of photocatalysis.30 Therefore, the combination of morphology and doping control is expected to result in a much better performance. Carbon-modified BiVO4 microtubes embedded with Ag nanoparticles (BVO@C/Ag MTs) were prepared by a two-step fabrication route. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was contributed from a high separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs aroused by the photo-synergistic effect among BiVO4, carbon, and Ag, where the improved visible light utilization was caused by the carbon layers.31 However, the introduction of the elements was complex with a very low yield. How to fabricate BiVO4 with both morphology and doping control in one step remains a significant challenge.In fact, nature offers an astonishing variety of materials with interconnected hierarchical structures, which are not easily synthesized using available nanotechnology. Hierarchical structures from nature often display a higher absorption range to visible light and the abundant biogenic elements, endowed from biological systems, that can be preserved and incorporated into the final biotemplated materials, lead to a new way to obtain photocatalysts.32 Fiber-like N-doped TiO2 with a mixed phase of anatase and rutile was fabricated through the biomineralization process by using a β-sheet peptide nanofiber as an organic template, which showed wonderful photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B under UV irradiation.33 However, for ternary oxides, such as BiVO4, it is very hard to duplicate sophisticated structures from bio-templates, because the synthesis processes are tedious and the grains easily grow up. To the best of our knowledge, nothing has been reported about using biological templates to synthesise BiVO4, let alone the in situ element doping into BiVO4 with hierarchical structures.To address the challenge above, herein, we design and fabricate C-doped BiVO4 with hierarchical structures templated from Papilio paris butterfly wings by a novel sol–gel method that enables simultaneous control of BiVO4 crystal phase, morphology, and in situ C-doped in a single process. The Papilio paris butterfly wing we chose possesses an advantage of a quasi-honeycomb structure that can absorb visible light to an utmost degree—over 95% absorption rate.34 The effects of the carbon content on the visible-light driven photocatalytic activity of O2 production from water and the degradation of methylene blue (MB) were also investigated.2 Experimental section2.1 Synthesis of materialsCommercial BiVO4 powders for comparison were bought from Color Pigment Company, China. Butterfly wing biotemplates were purchased from Shanghai Natural Wild-Insect Kingdom Co., Ltd. Analytic grade reagents bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O), ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), ethanol, acetic acid, nitric acid, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) were purchased from Sinopharm Reagent Chemical Co., Ltd. In a typical synthesis, firstly, Papilio paris butterfly wings as biological templates were air dried before use. The biological samples were pretreated with a mixture solution of acetic acid and ethanol for 12 h at room temperature and then washed with deionized water and air-dried for 24 h. Then, a BiVO4 sol–gel solution was prepared as follows: (i) Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added into a mixture solution of glycerol and ethanol at 80 °C for 30 min with magnetic stirring, where glycerol acted as a surfactant and made the solution mild; (ii) NH4VO3 was dissolved in 5 mL TMAH with magnetic stirring; (iii) these two solutions were mixed together in a 1:1 molar ratio (Bi:V) to get a stable mixture with magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 15 min, and a few drops of 65% (w/w) nitric acid were added to the mixture solution until the solution became clear transparent. The pretreated butterfly wing samples were carefully dipped into the BiVO4 sol–gel solution and kept at 36 °C for 24 h. After that, the butterfly wings were taken out and washed with a mixture solution of glycerol and ethanol and dried at 50 °C for 48 h under vacuum. Finally, the samples were calcined in air at 380 °C, 400 °C, 430 °C, and 500 °C respectively with a constant heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to crystallize the BiVO4 and control the carbon content from the organic templates. The obtained sample was denoted as BVOB@xC, where x signifies the carbon content in percentage. The prepared samples were BVOB@2.4C, BVOB@1.5C, BVOB@0.6C, and BVOB, respectively. Pure BiVO4 powder was denoted as BVOP. The synthesis process is illustrated in Scheme 1.

X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a physical electronics PHI5400 using Mg Kα radiation as the X-ray source and Raman scattering measurements were obtained in back scattering geometry on a Via+ Reflex from 150–1000 cm−1. The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were characterized using a FEI QUANTA TEG 250 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a JEOL2011 transmission electron microscope (TEM). TEM specimens were prepared by dispersing the synthesized samples in pure ethanol and the powder was picked up by copper grids. The carbon contents of the samples were detected by a High Frequency Infrared Ray Carbon Sulphur Analyser (CS-206) and a Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) on Pyris 1 TGA (PerkinElmer). UV-Visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra of all the samples were recorded using a PerkinElmer UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (750S) in the spectral range of 200–800 nm. Electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out on a Bruker EMX-8/2.7 X-band EPR spectrometer operating in the X-band at 9.86 GHz and 1.07 mW. Portions of the solid samples (14 mg) were introduced into a spectroscopic quartz probe cell and the measurements were taken at room temperature under visible light irradiation in air.2.3 Photocatalytic activity testWater splitting for O2. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the amount of hydrogen and oxygen split from water (Labsolar-H2, Perfect Light, China) in an AgNO3 aqueous solution under visible light from a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Perfect Light, China) equipped with a cutoff filter L42. The visible light intensity is about 15 mA. 35 mg of the photocatalyst was poured into 90 mL of AgNO3 aqueous solution (0.05 mol L−1) in a reactor at room temperature in air. Subsequently, the reactant solution was irradiated under the 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm). The evolved gases were analyzed by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (GC7890II, Tianmei, Shanghai; N2 carrier gas).Degradation of MB. The photocatalytic degradation of MB activity was assessed in aqueous solution in a water-cooled quartz triangle conical flask. The as-prepared semiconductor material (50 mg) was mixed with an aqueous solution of methylene blue (MB) (50 mL, 20 mg L−1), followed by magnetic stirring in the dark for at least 1 h to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium of MB on the surface of the material. The reaction system was then subject to visible-light irradiation by a 300 W Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm). A series of aqueous solution samples (3 mL) were collected and separated from the suspended catalyst particles for analysis every 10 min. The concentration of MB was determined by monitoring its characteristic absorption at 665 nm on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.3 Results and discussionAs shown in Fig. 1a, the wings of Papilio paris are about 6–8 cm, the forewings appear black and have aeneous scales on their surfaces. The black scales are neatly arranged on the surface of the wings and have an over-all rectangular shape with jagged ends (Fig. 1b). The high resolution image in Fig. 1c reveals that the black wing scales have structures including inverse V-type ridges and three hole arrays. The ridges are decorated with nano-scale ribs of about 400 nm wide and the space between each ridge is filled with a net-like structure, which is called the quasi-honeycomb structure. The cross-section of the scales is shown in Fig. 1d and it reveals that the scales are constructed of three-layers, the hole layer with a quasi-honeycomb structure has one or two tentacles connected with the bottom substrate.35 The quasi-honeycomb structure can absorb visible light to an utmost degree over 95% absorption rate. Sunlight can be highly absorbed by the black wing in two ways (Fig. 1e). When light reaches the ribs, it will be scattered and reflected in the holes with attenuated intensity and be absorbed by the quasi-honeycomb structure. The incident light of which directly pass through the hole layer will be absorbed by the bottom substrate finally. The reasons of the high absorption of solar energy by the quasi-honeycomb structure were also supported by the optiFDTD simulation.36 The optimal prototypes from the black scales can be extracted for absorption, which could assist the design of photocatalysts.

(e) 2D model from the FESEM images, showing the ways to absorb solar energy by a Papilio paris butterfly wing. 3.1 X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum and XPS spectraXRD patterns of the obtained samples are compared in Fig. 2. All the peaks in Fig. 2a can be indexed as (110), (011), (121), (040), (200), (002), (141), (211), (150), (132), (240), (042), (202), (161), (321), and (123) planes, which can be identical to that of pure monoclinic BiVO4 (clinobisvanite; space group: I2/a, JCPDS card no. 014-0688) without any impurity phase, such as Bi2O3 and V2O5. As a result, the average grain size of the samples calculated via the Scherrer formula is 27.2, 19.3, 18.7 and 14.2 nm, corresponding to BVOB, BVOB@0.6C, BVOB@1.5C and BVOB@2.4C, respectively, while the pure BiVO4 powder (BVOP) shows 28.5 nm (Table 1). It seems that higher C content favors the formation of BiVO4 with a smaller crystalline size. This suggests that C, which is in favour of assisting the replication of butterfly wings, may act as a support to suppress the grain growth, and thereby avoid BiVO4 particle agglomeration. Fig. 2b exhibits a magnified view of (121) and (040) peaks, which show gradual shifts to lower angles with the increase of the C-doping and the maximum shifting of 0.318° for the (121) peak is reached at 1.5% C-doping and the peak shift drops back a little at 2.4% C-doping. The BVOB@1.5C shows the largest peak shift by 0.318, this may be ascribed to the lattice expansion due to the slight portion of carbon atom incorporation, and indicates that C may have a certain influence on the d(121) and d(040) spacings of the BiVO4. These XRD results indicate that C has been well inserted into V sites of the host BiVO4 lattice and induces lattice expansion without forming any segregated impurity phase.29 It has been reported that impurity doping endows higher photocatalytic activity for the increased reactive sites and promoted electron–hole separation efficiency.37 Therefore, the as-prepared BVOB@xC samples are expected to show enhanced photocatalytic performance. However, BVOB@2.4C does not show less peak shift toward lower angles compared with that of BVOB@1.5C. Fig. 2  XRD patterns of (a) BVOP and BVOB@xC (x = 0–2.4 wt%).

The bands at 827, 712, 367, 324, and 210 cm−1 correspond to the typical vibrations of monoclinic BiVO4. The bands at 827 is assigned to the typical symmetric V–O stretching mode, and with a weak shoulder at about 712 cm−1 assigned to the antisymmetric V–O stretching mode, whereas those at 367 and 324 cm−1 are attributed to the typical symmetric and antisymmetric bending modes of the vanadate anion. The external mode appears at 210 cm−1.38,39 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the BVOP and BVOB@xC (x = 0–2.4 wt%). As seen from Fig. 3, it is clear that a continuum shift of the Raman band to the lower wave numbers, from 827 to 818 cm−1 assigned to symmetric V–O bond stretching mode, reveals that the average long-range symmetry of the VO4 tetrahedral becomes less regular with an increase of the carbon content from 0 to 2.4 wt%. The blue-shift is due to the C-doping effect where C has been inserted into the V sites of the BiVO4 lattice to form the C–O bond, which has the bond length shorter than that of the V–O bond. Furthermore, with the decrease of the sintering temperature, the distinct reduction of the band intensities is decreased accordingly.Moreover, the chemical states of the samples are further revealed through XPS analysis. As shown in the overall XPS spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†), only the characteristic peaks of Bi, V, O, and C elements were detected. The red-shift in all the peaks of Bi, V, O, and C elements is due to the C inserting into the V sites of the BiVO4 lattice to form the C–O bond. The higher the carbon content is, the more the red-shift increases. Although the raw material NH4VO3 contains nitrogen element, no XPS peaks of N1s were detected at around 400 eV, indicating that no nitrogen is present in the products. The peaks located at 158.7 and 164.0 eV are assigned to the Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 (Fig. 4a), respectively, confirming that the bismuth species in the BiVO4 are Bi3+ cations. The samples show an XPS signal of O1s at 530.2 eV, which correspond to the O2− anions in the BiVO4 crystallites (Fig. 4b). The photoelectron peaks at 529.3 and 516.5 eV are assigned to the V2P1/2 and V2P3/2 peaks (Fig. 4c), respectively, indicating that the V is in the samples as V5+.40Fig. 4d shows the C1s XPS spectra of the samples with peaks located between 280 and 295 eV (C1s). The binding energy of 284.6 eV is due to non-oxygenated ring C, and 285.9 eV is due to the C in C–O bonds (Fig. S2, ESI†). The peak shifts of Bi4f, V2p, O1s, and C1s are caused by the variation of the C content in the BVOB@xC samples, suggesting that in situ C-doped BiVO4 from the butterfly wings was successfully obtained, which was consistent with the XRD and Raman results. Fig. 4  X-ray photoelectron spectra of the samples: (a) Bi4f5/2 and Bi4f7/2 peaks, (b) O1s peak, (c) V2P3/2 and V2P1/2 peaks and (d) C1s peak. 3.2 UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectraTo investigate the optical absorption properties of the samples, UV/Vis spectroscopy was conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. Compared with the pure BiVO4 powder (BVOP), the main absorption edge of the BVOB has a red-shift of more than 30 nm. It indicates that the band-gap energy of the butterfly BiVO4 samples was affected by the quasi-honeycomb structure of the Papilio paris butterfly wing, and the quasi-honeycomb structure can enhance the visible light absorption. Moreover, BVOB@xC exhibits an increased photoabsorption at wavelengths between 480 and 700 nm which is caused probably by the C doping. This suggests that carbon can indeed extend the semiconductors into the visible light range. The optical band-gap energies of the five samples were estimated from the absorption spectra by using the following relationship:αhν = A(hν − Eg)nwhere Eg, h and A are the band-gap energy (eV), Planck's constant (6.626 × 10−34 J s) and a constant, respectively, and α and ν are the absorption coefficient and light frequency respectively. The value of n depends on whether the transition is direct (n = 1/2) or indirect (n = 2). For BiVO4, a direct band gap, the value of n is 1/2. The band gap energy of the samples can be thus estimated from a plot of (αhν)1/2versus photon energy (hν) to the energy axis at a = 0 as shown in Fig. 5b. The band gap energy for BVOB is measured to be about 2.33 eV, which is smaller than that of BVOP (2.46 eV). It also shows a systematic decrease with the C doping level, that is, BVOB@0.6C (ca. 2.40 eV), BVOB@1.5C (ca. 2.39 eV), and BVOB@2.4C (ca. 2.28 eV). Thus the band-gap energy of the samples was affected by the quasi-honeycomb structure of Papilio paris butterfly wings and the level of the carbon doping. The small difference in the band gap will have a significant influence on the photocatalytic performance which will be discussed later with the results of oxygen production from water split and the degradation of MB. Fig. 5  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of the samples. (b) The calculation diagram of their band gaps. 3.3 Scanning and transmission electron microscopyThe effects of the carbon content on the structures and morphologies of the replicas are shown in Fig. 6. The scales are neatly arranged on the surface and the structure of the Papilio paris butterfly wings is completely retained by the BiVO4 (Fig. 6a, d, g and j). Compared with the original butterfly wing (Fig. 1b), the BVOB@xC samples show 10–30% shrinkage after the calcination. With the increase of calcination temperatures, the quasi-honeycomb and three-layer structures of the scales can still clearly be seen in the BVOB@xC samples (Fig. 6b, e, h and k), but the further finer and elaborate architectures in the ribs disappear (Fig. 6f), because the grain sizes of BiVO4 particles grow up significantly when the calcination temperature reaches 500 °C (Fig. 6c), which was consistent with the XRD results. However, the parallel ridges of the scales and nanoscale ribs were retained in the BVOB@1.5C and BVOB@2.4C even after being calcined at 400 °C and 380 °C, indicating an extremely fine duplication of the original scale structures can be obtained by using the sol–gel method (Fig. 6i, l). It seems that C with an appropriate level may suppress the grain growth and thereby limit the agglomeration of the BiVO4 particles and enhances the structural replication from the butterfly wing. The morphology of BVOP (Fig. S3, ESI†) suggests that BiVO4 particles agglomerated extensively and thus a poor photocatalytic performance is expected. Fig. 6  FE-SEM images of the BVOB@xC samples: (a–c) different magnification SEM images of BVOB calcined at 500 °C; (d–f) different magnification SEM images of BVOB@0.6C calcined at 430 °C; (g–i) different magnification SEM images of BVOB@1.5C calcined at 400 °C; (j–l) different magnification SEM images of BVOB@2.4C calcined at 380 °C. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images provide further insight into the morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared samples (Fig. 7). Take BVOB for example, the TEM image reveals that the replica retained the overall scale morphology of the original butterfly wing (Fig. 7a), however the finer and sophisticated structures of the scales were disordered or distorted through the synthetic process due to the larger grains (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7d shows a selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the BVOB without C-doping and the (121), (110) and (020) diffraction planes are indexed as shown, and the corresponding high resolution TEM image taken from the nanoscale ribs is shown in Fig. 7c. The observed lattice distances of 0.308 nm and 0.475 nm match those of the d121 and d110 of monoclinic BiVO4. Clearly the walls of the hollow structures were composed of numerous small nanocrystals. In addition, the sophisticated structures of the scales were shown in the BVOB@1.5C and BVOB@2.4C (Fig. 7i, g, m and n), indicating an extremely fine duplication of the original scale structures was retained in the BVOB@1.5C and BVOB@2.4C. The crystal structure of the BVOB@1.5C was determined from the SAED pattern (Fig. 7l), which could be indexed consistently to the (110) and (121) planes of monoclinic BiVO4. The spacing between two adjacent lattice planes was about 0.308 nm (Fig. 7k), corresponding to the d121 of monoclinic BiVO4. The diffraction rings of BVOB@2.4C in Fig. 7p were indexed to the (121) and (110) planes; lattice fringes with interplanar distances d121 = 0.308 nm are obviously discernible in the HR-TEM images in Fig. 7o. Moreover, the SAED pattern in Fig. 7h could be indexed to the (051), (011) and (110) planes of monoclinic BiVO4 for BVOB@0.6C. The spacing between two adjacent lattice planes was about 0.475 nm which could be seen in the HR-TEM images in Fig. 7g, corresponding to the d110 of monoclinic BiVO4. It is clear that BVOB@xC is polycrystalline in nature, which also indicates that the quasi-honeycomb structure is organized by the nanocrystalline subunits, which is consistent with XRD results. It would be expected that BVOB@xC should perform better photocatalytic O2 production and the degradation of MB experiments. Fig. 7  (a) TEM image of BVOB calcined at 500 °C with 0 wt% C.

The working electrode was irradiated from the FTO side with visible-light through a cutoff filter (L42). The incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) was calculated as follows:[IPCE/%] = 1240 × [Photocurrent density/μA cm−2]/([Wavelength/nm] × [Photo flux/W m−2])Fig. 8 shows an action spectrum of the electrodes for IPCE at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl using monochromatic light controlled with band pass filters. The BVOB@1.5C electrode gave an excellent anodic photocurrent with 3.8% of an IPCE at 440 nm at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, whereas a trivial IPCE of BVOP at 0.3% (at 440 nm) was observed. One order of magnitude enhancement in photoconversion efficiency indicates that BVOB@1.5C may have the best photocatalytic activity. Fig. 8  Action spectrum of the electrodes for IPCE (1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). 3.5 Photocatalytic activityThe photocatalytic activities of the samples were tested for O2 evolution from water splitting and the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under the visible light range. Fig. 9a shows the amount of evolved O2 by solar light from an aqueous solution containing Ag+ as an electron acceptor. The amount of evolved O2 from the aqueous solution after 5 h from BVOB@1.5C was ca. 800 μmol L−1, which was the highest photocatalytic O2 evolution among all the tested samples. It is 16 times and 8 times as much as that of BVOP (ca. 49 μmol L−1) and BVOB (ca. 112 μmol L−1), respectively. The rank order of the activity was BVOP < BVOB@2.4C < BVOB < BVOB@0.6C < BVOB@1.5C. Fig. 9b shows that the degree of MB photodegradation which was obtained by calculating the change of concentration (C/C0) from the variation of absorbance (A/A0) at 665 nm. The absorption peaks at 612 nm and 665 nm in Fig. S4† correspond to dimers and monomers of MB, respectively. Another peak at 603 nm corresponds to the formation of the demethylated MB during oxidative decomposition.18 The rank order of the activity was different from that of the O2 evolution: BVOP < BVOB < BVOB@0.6C < BVOB@2.4C < BVOB@1.5C. The results suggest that the amount of 1.5 wt% C is optimized for the C-doped BiVO4 photocatalyst with the butterfly wing structure. When the content of C reaches 2.4 wt%, the excessive amount of C doping seems to form defect sites in the monoclinic BiVO4 lattice, which act as electron–hole recombination sites and decrease the photocatalytic activity. Compared with the N-doped photocatalysts from bio-templates,42 the C-doped here reported is much more attractive in photocatalyst fabrication, because the content of N element is ultimately determined by the biotemplate itself. Actually, the most important element in organisms is carbon that is known as the source of the life, which can be easily adjusted by using different calcination temperatures. Fig. 9  (a) Photocatalytic O2 evolution of the samples from aqueous AgNO3 solutions (0.05 mol L−1, 90 mL) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), and (b) the photocatalytic degradation of MB at an initial concentration of 20 mg L−1 (50 mL) of BVOP and BVOB@xC under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The amount was kept the same for all the samples. The degree of MB photodegradation was obtained by calculating the change of concentration (C/C0) from the variation of absorbance (A/A0) at 665 nm. 3.6 Reaction mechanismIt is well known that the sunlight absorption capability of the photocatalyst and separation of excited electron–hole pairs are two crucial factors influencing the photoactivity. To clarify the reaction mechanism of the photocatalytic activities of BVOB@xC, we employed an electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trap technique to probe the active oxygen species generated under the visible light illumination. As shown in Fig. 10, the peak with a g factor of about 4 could be assigned to V in all the samples. No signals (around g = 2) can be detected for the BVOP and BVOB compared with BVOB@0.6C and BVOB@1.5C, where the peaks of g = 1.987 and g = 2.008 are assigned to O2− radicals.11,18,43 Thus, these results provide the evidence of O2− formed in the presence of the photocatalysts BVOB@0.6C, BVOB@1.5C, and BVOB@2.4C, and the BVOB@1.5C showed an enhanced intensity signals of O2− compared to BVOB@0.6C, indicating that BVOB@1.5C has the best charge transportability. Fig. 10  The EPR signals obtained from BVOP and BVOB@xC after visible light irradiating for 5 min. When the carbon content reaches 2.4 wt%, the EPR signs become complex, because the excess carbon which is not inserted into the BiVO4 lattice becomes detrimental to the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalysis. These results provide a strong indication that the photogenerated charge carriers in the signals obtained after irradiating for 5 min not only possess strong redox ability but also are long-lived enough to react with the surface adsorbed O2 or H2O to produce ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals. The generated ˙O2− and ˙OH play a pivotal role and are recognized as the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of pollutants.From all the results presented above, a possible mechanism for the photodegradation of MB and O2 evolution from water splitting by the BVOB@xC composite catalysts has been proposed and is illustrated in Scheme 2. We attribute the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of BVOB@1.5C under visible light to the more absorption of visible light as well as more efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons. The effect of the in situ C on the activity of BVOB@xC can be explained in terms of its action as a charge carrier and a photosensitizer. However, the role C as a charge carrier is more likely to be the key factor accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity, which is clearly demonstrated in EPR. As a photosensitizer, C may enhance the absorption of the visible light due to the synergistic effect of the finer hierarchical structure derived from Papilio paris butterfly wings, and the enhanced separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Scheme 2  The mechanism proposed for illustrating the role of hierarchical structures from butterfly wings and carbon in the photocatalytic performance of BVOB@1.5C: (i) photon absorption by the C-doped butterfly wing material. (ii) The hierarchical structures and carbon help the photogenerated electron–hole pairs separated and transported to the surface of the BVOB@1.5C. (iii) The electrons and holes reach to the surface by diffusion to cause oxidation and reduction reaction. In the photocatalytic oxygen evolution process, h+ was directly involved in the reaction. AgNO3 was used as the scavenger. The Ag+ would react with photogenerated electrons as an electron acceptor to reduce the recombination of electron–hole pairs (eqn (3)). (1) 2H2O + 4h+ → 4H+ + O2(2) 4Ag+ + 4e− → 4Ag(3)The total equation for the photocatalytic O2 production may be summarized as follows:  In the degradation of methylene blue, the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs on the BVOB@xC semiconductor would be enhanced and the recombination rate could be inhibited by the C-doping. The photoinduced electrons in the composite catalyst are then captured by O2, triggering the formation of a very reactive superoxide radical ion (˙O2−) (eqn (5)). Simultaneously, the resulting holes can then react with the OH− derived from H2O and form a hydroxyl radical ˙OH (eqn (7)). The generated ˙O2− would further interact with H2O adsorbed to produce more ˙OH radicals (eqn (6)). These radicals group are responsible for the decomposition of organic compounds (MB) (eqn (8)). (4) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(5) ˙O2− + H2O → ˙OH + OH−(6) h+ + OH− → ˙OH(7) ˙OH + MB → degradation product(8)There are at least two reasons for the high performance of BVOB@1.5C: the unique quasi-honeycomb structure inherited from the Papilio paris butterfly wings which allow more sunlight waves to penetrate deep inside the BiVO4, thus improving the visible light absorption capability and the hierarchical porous structure and the doped-C which enhances the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and further reduces the charge recombination rate as evidenced by the EPR analysis.4 ConclusionIn summary, C-doped BiVO4 with hierarchical structures was fabricated by a novel one-step sol–gel and templating method, which enables the simultaneous control of the crystal phase, morphology, and carbon element doping in a single process. The fine replication of butterfly wing structures in BVOB@xC down to the nanometer level was confirmed directly by SEM and TEM. The carbon has been well inserted into the V sites of the host BiVO4 lattice and induces lattice expansion without forming any segregated impurity phase. The effect of the carbon content (0.6–2.4 wt%) on the structures was investigated and the results showed that C formed from butterfly wings may act as a support to suppress the grain growth, and thereby limit BiVO4 particles' agglomeration. The measured photocatalytic activity results indicate that BVOB@1.5C with 1.5 wt% C exhibits the best photocatalytic performances in both the photocatalytic O2 evolution (ca. 800 μmol L−1, after 5 h), which is 16 times as much as that of BVOP (ca. 49 μmol L−1) and BVOB (ca. 112 μmol L−1), and the decomposition of MB under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), which is 6.3 times higher than that of the pure BVOP. However, when the content of C reaches 2.4 wt%, the excessive amount of C seems to form defect sites in the monoclinic BiVO4 lattice, which act as electron–hole recombination sites and decrease the photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of BVOB@1.5C is attributed to not only the unique quasi-honeycomb structure inherited from the Papilio paris butterfly wings but also the in situ carbon doping, improving the visible light absorption capability as well as enhancing the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. This strategy provides a simple one-step method to fabricate a high-performance photocatalyst, which may open new possibilities to design semiconductor materials for future applications.AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research from the National Science Foundation of China (No. 51072117, 51171110), National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program, 2012CB619600), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (0JC1407600) and the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20120073130001).
