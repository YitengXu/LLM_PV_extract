    , Accepted 30th January 2016First published on 1st February 2016AbstractAn iodoplumbate-based hybrid, [C7-Apy][PbI3] (1), where C7-Apy+ = 1-heptyl-4-aminopyridinium, was prepared using a simple solution process. Three sequential phase transitions occur in the range of 402–443 K. In both the lowest and highest temperature phases, hybrid crystal 1 is composed of discrete [Pb2I6]∞ twin chains surrounded by C7-Apy+ cations. The connectivity between PbI6 octahedra within a [Pb2I6]∞ twin chain and the arrangement of cations are quite difference between the lowest and highest temperature phases. Hybrid crystal 1 shows switchable ion conductivity due to the structural phase transition and white light emission attributed to the broad band semiconductor emission of the twin chain. The former functionality has potential application in ion conductor devices; the single-phase white light emitter is a useful material in low-cost, easily-made, high-efficiency white light-emitting diodes.
Introduction
Haloplumbate-based hybrids have received considerable research interests due to their tunable structures from the discrete mononuclear or polynuclear species (zero-dimensional; abbr. 0-D) to the infinite variety with higher dimensionality1–8 (one-dimensional,1,3–6 two-dimensional7,8 or three-dimensional;2 hereafter abbr. as 1-D, 2-D and 3-D, respectively) and the wide range of novel physical properties, beneficial in optics9–13 and electronics.14–16
In the context of haloplumbate-based hybrids, the perovskite-type ones have attracted tremendous research interest. The 3-D haloplumbate-based perovskites, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, with much lower exciton binding energies and intense light absorption over the whole visible light region have been employed as absorbers in solar cells. It is remarkable that the records of certified power conversion efficiencies have being constantly updated and over merely a few years, the power conversion efficiency has been enhanced to 20%.14 Most recently, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites have been found to show amazing bipolar and bistable resistive switching behavior with small on–off voltage of <1.0 V in a simple metal-dielectric-metal capacitor configuration device of Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate, revealing their additional promising application in the nonvolatile device memory field.17 The 2-D haloplumbate-based hybrids, (N-MEDA)[PbBr4−xClx] (N-MEDA = N1-methylethane-1,2-diammonium, x = 0–1.2), are single-phase white-light emitters, and their broadband emission across the entire visible spectrum arises from corrugated lead halide sheets. Interestingly, the emission is tunable through halide substitution to afford both “warm” and “cold’ white light in such haloplumbate-based wide-band gap semiconductors.9 The 1-D iodoplumbate-based hybrids were reported to display ferroelectricity, wherein the polarization is switchable under an alternating current electrical field.18
In addition, a 3-D open-framework hybrid, (EDAMP)2n(Pb7I18)n·4nH2O (EDAMP2+ = Et2NHC6H4–CH2C6H4NHEt2), in which the inorganic framework is built from purely octahedral PbI6 units and behaves as a quantum-wire array, shows a fascinating wavelength-dependent photochromic behavior.19 Its color changes from yellow to olive green under illumination with λ = 500 nm light and further to dark green with light of λ < 500 nm. Most interestingly, the reversion of the color for the hybrid can be accomplished by heating, indicating that this hybrid possesses switchable photochromic nature. It is well known that a material with switchable functionality through external stimuli, such as thermally-triggered, irradiation-induced and applied pressure, is very useful for application in the fields of sensors, memory and data storage.20–23
In this study, we report an iodoplumbate-based hybrid, [C7-Apy][PbI3] (1) (C7-Apy+ = 1-heptyl-4-aminopyridinium), which shows fascinating switchable ion conductivity and white light emission.
Results
Yellowish needle-shaped crystals of 1 were obtained by slowly evaporating a DMF solution containing PbI2, KI and [C7-Apy]Br. The hybrid crystals were insoluble in common organic solvents, besides DMF and DMSO, as well as water. The purity of 1 was examined using elemental analyses for C, H and N and powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. S1†). This hybrid is thermally stable up to ca. 300 °C (ref. Fig. S2†).
Ionic conductivity
The ion conductivity of 1 was measured by AC impedance spectroscopy under dry N2. The AC frequencies span from 1 to 107 Hz. The corresponding Nyquist plots between 333 and 415 K are displayed in Fig. 1a and S3.† Below 373 K, the −Z′′ vs. Z′ plot shows a pitch arc, indicating the existence of high resistance owing to the ions being immovable in the crystal lattice; above 373 K, each Nyquist plot at a selected temperature shows a semicircle and the semicircle diameter becomes smaller with increasing temperature. At higher temperatures (above 373 K), two semicircles appear in the complex impedance plots in the high frequency region, although these plots seem to give a single semicircle at a first glance (ref. Fig. S3b†). Two semicircles in the complex impedance plots correspond to the bulk and grain boundary resistances of the powdered crystals.24,25 The complex impedance data at selected temperatures were fitted using an equivalent circuit (EC) consisting of two series of parallel RC (Resistance and Capacitance) circuits.26–28 The best fits gave, for instance, σ = 7.93 × 10−9 S cm−1 at 393 K and 8.55 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 403 K. The temperature-dependent conductivities (σ) are plotted in the form of log(σ) vs. 1000/T, showing a linear relationship in the temperature range of 333–393 K and 403–413 K (ref. Fig. 1b); the activation energy was estimated to be 1.348 eV. Surprisingly, as the temperature increased, the electrical conductivity sharply increased by about two orders of magnitude and reached 8.55 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 403 K, and the conductivity continuously increases in the temperature range of 403–413 K with increasing temperature; the corresponding activation energy was estimated to be 1.078 eV, being slightly less than that in low temperature phase.

Dielectric behavior
In the ion-type hybrid crystal 1, the applied electrical field probably induces dipole motions, which include intrinsic dipole-orientated motions and ion-relative displacing motions. In addition to the electron transport, the conduction of 1 is also contributed to by the dipole motions in the AC impedance measurement. In order to investigate the dipole motions in 1, its dielectric behavior was further analyzed.
The dielectric permittivity (ε′) and loss (tan(δ)) as a function of frequency are displayed in Fig. 2; ε′ and tan(δ) as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. S4† for 1 at selected temperatures. The ε′ value is less than 9.0 at low frequency (f = 1 Hz) and is almost constant (ε′ ≈ 7.3) in the high frequency region (f > 103 Hz) when the temperature is below 323 K. At high temperatures, the dielectric permittivity drops rapidly with increasing frequency to 103 Hz (when the temperature is below 383 K) or 105 Hz (when the temperature is above 393 K; ref. Fig. 2a) in the plot of ε′ vs. frequency. These results indicate that the dynamic dipole motion cannot follow the rapid switching of the applied electrical field at higher frequencies. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2b, a dielectric loss peak becomes visible at temperatures above 343 K. The maximum of the dielectric loss peak in the plot of tan(δ) vs. frequency shifts toward higher frequencies with increasing temperature, demonstrating the existence of thermally-active dielectric relaxation. Dielectric relaxation originating from electronic transitions or molecular vibrations has a frequency above 1012 Hz, whereas slow dielectric relaxations originating from dipole orientation motion or ionic displacement polarization occur in the range of 102–1010 Hz. The frequency of dielectric relaxation in 1 falls within the regime of the dipole orientation or ionic displacement polarization relaxation mechanism, revealing that the thermally-active dielectric relaxation in 1 is related to the dynamic dipole orientation and ionic displacement polarization motion that gives rise to ion conductance.

DSC analysis
To reveal the novel switchable ion conductivity of 1, we performed the DSC measurement in the temperature range of 193–483 K and observed three thermal anomaly events in the heating run (Fig. 3), indicating the existence of three sequential phase transitions. The three thermal anomalies are close to each other, and the onset temperature occurs at ca. 402 K for the thermal event on the low temperature side. Interestingly, only one exothermic peak (Tpeak = 359 K) appears in the DSC plot in the cooling run; such a phenomenon is analogous to the frequent observations in ion-liquid crystals,29 which is due to the fact that the thermal motion of the alkyl chains cannot follow the temperature change during the heating-cooling cycle.

Crystal structures
In line with the DSC analysis, we collected X-ray single crystal diffraction data at 296 and 393 K in the lowest temperature (LT) phase and at 421 K in highest temperature (HT) phase to determine the crystal structures. Hybrid 1 crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pbcn in the LT phase; an asymmetric unit comprises two distinct Pb2+ ions and six different I− ions together with two non-equivalent C7-Apy+ cations (Fig. 4a and b); all atoms occupy general positions. Pb(1) and Pb(2) form distorted PbI6 coordination octahedra, where four I− ions lying in the equatorial plane and one I− ion located at the axial site are shared and referred to as bridging iodides; one I− ion in the axial position of each octahedron undergoes no sharing and is referred to as the terminal iodide (I(2) in the Pb(1) coordination octahedron and I(5) in the Pb(2) coordination octahedron). In the Pb(1)I6 coordination octahedron, I(1) occupies two equatorial positions and I(3) and I(4) the other two equatorial positions; I(2) and I(6) occupy two axial positions. In the Pb(2)I6 coordination octahedron, I(6) occupies two equatorial positions and I(3) and I(4) the other two equatorial positions; I(1) and I(5) occupy two axial positions. At 296 K, the coordination geometry of the Pb2+ ion shows equatorial Pb–I bond distances to be similar in the ranges of 3.1380(9)–3.2691(8) Å within the Pb(1)I6 coordination octahedron and 3.0950(9)–3.3097(8) Å within the Pb(2)I6 one, whereas two axial Pb–I bond distances are the longest (dPb(1)–I(6)#1 = 3.5016(8) and dPb(2)–I(1)#2 = 3.5446(9) Å; symmetry codes: #1 = x, −1 + y, z; #2 = x, 1 + y, z) and the shortest (dPb(1)–I(2) = 3.0477(8) and dPb(2)–I(5) = 3.0416(8) Å). The Pb(1)I6 and Pb(2)I6 octahedra share one equator-to-apex edge, made up of I(1) and I(6), to form a Pb2I62− subunit; the neighboring subunits are connected into a twin chain of {Pb2I6}∞ along the b-axis via sharing corners (μ2-I(4)) and triangular faces (I(1)–I(3)–I(6)); the relative rotation occurs between the equatorial planes of the neighboring Pb2I62− subunits (for instance, the dihedral angle is 52.4° between two I(1)–I(1)–I(4)–I(3) planes versus 50.7° between two I(6)–I(6)–I(3)–I(4) planes). Such anionic twin chains are rarely seen in the lead iodide hybrids.30

Two non-equivalent cations adopt bent conformations, with alkyl chains slightly distorted close to the pyridyl rings with almost completely trans-planar conformations. At 296 K, charge-assisted H-bonding interactions appear between the NH2 groups and the I− ions with parameters dH(1B)⋯I(2)#3 = 3.024, dH(3A)⋯I(5)#4 = 3.025 and dH(3B)⋯I(4) = 2.892 Å (ref. Fig. S5† and symmetry codes: #3 = 1.5 − x, 0.5 + y, z and #4 = x, 2 + y, z). The π⋯π stack occurs between two adjacent pyridyl rings containing N(3) atoms, with a dihedral angle of 10.4° and the shorter interatomic distances dC(15)⋯C(17)#6 = 3.396, dC(16)⋯C(16)#6 = 3.200 Å (ref. Fig. S6† and symmetry code: #6 = 1 − x, y, 1.5 − z). The packing diagram of 1 viewed along the b-axis is shown in Fig. 4c.
The crystal structure of 1 at 393 K (in the LT phase) is quite similar to that at 296 K. From 296 to 393 K, the a- and b-axes expand by 1.46% and 1.18%, respectively, and the cell volume increases by 1.61%, while the c-axis shrinks by 1.03%. The typical bond parameters in the crystal structures at 393 K, shown in Tables S2 and S3,† are in good agreement with those at 296 K, whereas the displacement parameters are obviously larger than those at 296 K.
Upon heating from 393 K to 421 K, the structural phase transition occurs in the hybrid crystal of 1. It is notable that with respect to 296 K, the reduced cell volume increases by ca. 1.6% from 296 to 393 K (with the temperature interval ΔT = 98 K) in the LT phase, while by ca. 3.0% from 393 to 421 K (with the temperature interval ΔT = 28 K) across the structural phase transition. Moreover, the space group switches from Pbcn in the LT phase to P in the HT phase (ref. Table S1†). This is an extraordinary situation wherein the structural phase transition leads to the lattice possessing higher symmetry in the LT phase.
In the HT phase, the asymmetric unit is still composed of two distinct Pb2+ ions and six different I− ions with two C7-Apy+ cations (Fig. 5a and b). Two distinct Pb2+ ions are also situated in distorted octahedral coordination environments. At 421 K, the Pb–I distances fall in the ranges 3.0241(18)–3.4156(15) Å in the Pb(1) coordination octahedron versus 3.0106(18)–3.6093(16) Å in the Pb(2) coordination octahedron. With respect to the crystal structure in the HT phase, the Pb(1) and Pb(2) coordination octahedra show much more distortion in the LT phase.

Between LT and HT phases, the noteworthy changes of crystal structure of 1 concern the aspects shown in Fig. 4b, 5b and Table S3:† (1) the equivalent and anisotropic displacement factors in the inorganic units [Pb2I6]2− and the 4-NH2Py moieties at 421 K in the HT phase are comparable to those at 393 K in the LT phase, whereas the alkyl chains are heavily disordered in the HT phase. (2) The relative orientation of neighboring cations is significantly different (Fig. 4c and 5c–e). The neighboring cations show a staggered arrangement (ref. Fig. 4c, where the cations are in red or olive color) in the LT phase, while a head-to-tail alignment (ref. Fig. 4c, where the cations are in red or olive color) was observed in the HT phase when viewed along the inorganic chain direction. (3) For the inorganic {Pb2I6}∞ twin chain, the connectivity of Pb(1)I6 coordination octahedra is different. As shown in Fig. 5f, each Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedron, in the LT phase, is connected to two equivalent Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedra via sharing an apex, and three equivalent Pb(2)/Pb(1) coordination octahedra via sharing an apex, an edge and a face, respectively. While each Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedron, in the HT phase, is connected to one Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedron and four Pb(2)/Pb(1) coordination octahedra, amongst them, each Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedron is linked to one Pb(1)/Pb(2) coordination octahedron and three Pb(2)/Pb(1) coordination octahedra via sharing one edge, one Pb(2)/Pb(1) coordination octahedron via sharing an apex, which is displayed in Fig. 5g.
Absorption and photoluminescence spectra

Fig. 6 shows the solid state optical absorption spectrum of 1 at room temperature. Two intense absorption bands centered at 226 and 302 nm appear in the spectrum of 1 together with a shoulder around 285 nm and a broad band around 406 nm. The absorption bands with λmax < 400 nm show narrow half-peak widths and are more intense than the band around 406 nm; the former bands are assigned to the π → π* transition within the pyridyl ring of the cation; the broad band around 406 nm arises from the electron transition between the valence and conduction bands of the inorganic [Pb2I62−]∞ chain.
 Fig. 6  UV-Visible absorption spectrum of 1 in the solid state at ambient temperature. 
It is interesting that the room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of 1 depends on the excitation wavelength. As shown in Fig. 7, hybrid 1 shows a broad and weak emission band at room temperature; this band spans from ca. 400 to 700 nm and is almost across the whole visible region, giving rise to white light emission, when excited by light with λex < 370 nm. The image of white light emission is shown in the Fig. 7c when the powdered sample of 1 was illuminated by a UV lamp (wavelength ranging from 330 to 380 nm) at an ambient temperature. The band center of PL emission red-shifted and the emission intensity become stronger as the excitation wavelength increases. The emission band in the long wavelength side extends to 750 nm upon the excitation of λex > 470 nm and shows a clear shoulder when λex > 490 nm. The excitation wavelength-dependent emission indicates the existence of several excitation states emitting luminescence in 1. Theoretically, the pyridyl ring in the cation moiety and the inorganic [Pb2I62−]∞ chain probably emit luminescence in 1, on the basis of the absorption spectrum of 1 in the solid state; the π* level of the pyridyl ring is over the conducting band level of the inorganic [Pb2I62−]∞ chain. Thus, the emission band in the shorter wavelength region with the maximum of λem = 453 nm (see the section of the low temperature luminescence at 10 K) is attributed to the π → π* transition within the pyridyl ring and the emission bands in the longer wavelength region with the band maximum of λem > 500 nm have a contribution from the emission of the intrinsic and trap state of the [Pb2I62−]∞ inorganic twin chain. The trap states are related to the lattice defects. The pyridyl rings emitting weak fluorescence is due to the existence of π⋯π stacking interactions between them (see the crystal structure section); such π⋯π stacking interactions lead to the stacked pyridyl rings easily forming the excimers which quench fluorescence. With respect to the emission using longer wavelength light excitation (λex > 470 nm, ref. Fig. 7a), the emission arising from the intrinsic and trap state of the inorganic [Pb2I62−]∞ chain of 1 is also weak when excited by light with λex < 470 nm. This fact reveals the presence of absent efficient energy transfer processes between the higher π* level of the pyridyl ring and the lower conducting band and trap state levels of the [Pb2I62−]∞ inorganic twin chain.

Hybrid 1 shows not only the excitation light wavelength-dependence but also temperature-dependent emission spectra. Fig. 8a shows the PL spectra of 1 at selected temperatures; the intensities of emission bands centered at 453 nm and 547 nm increase as temperature is lowered. Moreover, the relative intensity between the two emission bands changes with temperature variation. It is noted that, for example, the emission bands at 453 nm and 547 nm are comparable in intensity when λex = 330 nm at 223 K, this gives rise to nearly white light with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) and CCT of 5611 K (the CIE coordinates are (0.33, 0.33) for pure white light). Under the same excitation wavelength, when T = 173 K, the band with maximum at 547 nm is more intense than the band centered at 453 nm. Besides this difference, even if the emission is located in the white light region, the CIE coordinates move to (0.35, 0.41).

Discussion
In the ion-type hybrid 1, the whole conductivity obtained from the impedance measurement comes from both electron transport and ion conduction. It was demonstrated experimentally that the dark conductivity of PbI2 crystals with layered structure was distinct along different crystallographic axes. Dark conductivities of the PbI2 crystal were 5.9 × 10−10 and 7.1 × 10−12 S cm−1 at room temperature, when the electrical field was applied perpendicular (within intra-layer of PbI2) and parallel (between inter-layer of PbI2) to the c-axes of the crystal,31 respectively. The main pathway of electron transport in 1 is through the inorganic {Pb2I6}∞ twin chains. With respect to the 2-D PbI2 crystal, the conductivity contributed by the electron transport should be much lower in 1 owing to the existence of discrete {Pb2I6}∞ twin chains only. On the other hand, the conductivity contributed from electron transport can be gotten from DC electrical measurement, and, theoretically, the conductivity obtained from AC measurement should be close to that gained from DC measurement when the applied AC frequency is close to zero. The conductivity of 1 is 3.55 × 10−12 S cm−1 at 293 K when f = 1 Hz, which is still comparable to the electrical conductivity of PbI2 crystal at room temperature. The results show that ion conduction plays an important role in the electrical conducting mechanism of 1.
On the basis of the structural analysis, it is found that significant lattice expansion occurs across the structural phase transition and the cations show a heavy dynamic disorder from the LT to the HT phase. These observations confirm the orientation and displacement motions being more favorable under an applied electrical field in the HT phase than in the LT phase. Enhanced cation mobility in the HT phase corresponds to the conductivity jump when proceeding from the LT to the HT phase.
To date, compounds with switchable magnetic or optical properties caused by thermally-induced structural change have been widely studied.21,32,33 On the other hand, although switchable conductivity materials were discovered mostly in inorganic semiconductors,34–37 a few polymers or organic supramolecular compounds and, latterly, switchable conductance related to the conformational changes or electroreduction,38–40 to the best of our knowledge, hybrid 1 is the first example showing switchable ion conductance in a hybrid material.
In the context of a white light emitting material, white light semiconductor nanocrystals have being widely studied and became a class of promisingly useful white light emitter. However, most of them require specialized processing techniques for preparation. In contrast to the complicated process of preparation for semiconductor nanocrystals, this hybrid is formed in solution using a simple self-assembly approach. In addition, most of white light emitting materials are generally produced by a combination of different emitters (red/blue/green or blue/orange) to cover the visible range from 400 to 700 nm. Obviously, the drawback of such a multi-phase strategy is fabrication complications and high-cost problems for the device.41–44 Thus, it is desirable to develop a single-phase white light emitter which is easily fabricated with perfect color reproducibility and stability. Single-phase emitters have been discovered in organic compound45–48 and metal complexes,49–54 however, they are scarce in organic–inorganic hybrid semiconductors.55–58
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully achieved an iodoplumbate-based hybrid using a simple self-assembly approach in solution. This hybrid shows switchable ion conductance, resulting from the structural phase transition, as well as both excitation light wavelength- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence behaviors. The excitation light wavelength-dependent photoluminescence arises from multiple band emission, which originates from the π → π* transition within the pyridyl ring of the cation and the electron transition between the valence and conducting bands of the inorganic [Pb2I62−]∞ chain. The white light emission was achieved via illumination by a UV lamp with light wavelength between 330 and 380 nm at room temperature and excited by λex = 330 nm at 223 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a crystalline hybrid semiconductor displaying the features of both white light emission and switchable ion conductance. Our result offers promising prospects for creating molecular crystals potentially applied in switchable ion conductor devices and high-efficiency lighting-emitting diodes.

Preparation of 1
A mixture of PbI2 (0.926 g, 2 mmol) and KI (3.320 g, 20 mmol) with a molar ratio of 1:10 in DMF (50 mL) was heated under reflux with stirring for 25 min. After the clear yellow solution was formed, DMF solution of [C7-Apy]Br (0.546 g, 2 mmol) was slowly added to the mixture, which was stirred for 4 h and filtered to remove insoluble compounds. The filtrate was evaporated at ambient temperature to produce light-yellowish needle-shaped crystals in ca. 70% yield. Anal. Calcd for C24H41I6N4Pb2: C, 18.46; H, 2.64; N, 3.58.

Thermogravimetric (TG) experiments were performed with a TA2000/2960 thermogravimetric analyzer from 283 K to 873 K at a warming rate of 10 K min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the polycrystalline samples were placed in an aluminum crucible. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out on a Pyris 1 power-compensation differential scanning calorimeter for 1 with a warming rate of 10 K min−1 during the heating process. The solid-state fluorescence measurements were performed at 298, 223, 173 and 10 K on a Fluorolog-3-tau spectrofluorimeter. Temperature- and frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity and AC impedance measurements were carried out on a Concept 80 system (Novocontrol, Germany) in the range of 173–413 K; the powdered pellet, with a thickness of ca. 0.66 mm and 132.6 mm2 area, was coated by gold films on the opposite surfaces and sandwiched by copper electrodes and the AC frequencies spanned from 1 Hz to 107 Hz.

The diffraction data were collected for the same crystal with graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) on a CCD area detector (Bruker SMART) for 1 at 296, 393 and 421 K (heating mode). Data reductions and absorption corrections were performed with the SAINT and SADABS software packages,59 respectively. Structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedure on F2 using the SHELXL-97 program.60 The non-hydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined, and the hydrogen atoms were introduced at calculated positions for refinement of data from 1 collected at 296 and 393 K. It is mentioned that it is really difficult to obtain good single crystal X-ray diffraction data for the HT phase because the structure is heavily disordered upon heating. Disorder models for carbon atoms of the alkyl chain were used in the structure refinements of 1 at 421 K; the occupancy factors of the C atoms were refined but they were not refined anisotropically and the H atoms were not attached. In addition, the pyridyl rings were fixed in the refinement using the model of the six atoms being coplanar. The crystallographic details of data collection and structural refinement are summarized in Table S1.† Selected bond lengths and angles for 1at 296, 393 and 421 K together with their estimated standard deviations are listed in Table S2.†
