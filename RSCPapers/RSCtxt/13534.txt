    , Accepted 3rd January 2014First published on 13th February 2014AbstractTailored fabrication of non-stoichiometric semiconductors has attracted considerable interest since the oxygen vacancy is the fundamental and intrinsic defect in reduced semiconductors and has critical impacts on their physicochemical properties such as tuning optical absorption, increasing conductivity, etc. Therefore, it is highly important to have a comprehensive understanding of the methods and the techniques of Ti3+ generation as well as Ti3+ property exploration. Here we have developed an effective strategy for the large-scale synthesis of blue titania with Ti3+ localized in the core of TiO2−x nanoparticles (NPs) based on Le Chatelier's principle. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra confirm the presence of Ti3+ in as-prepared samples, which is attributed to be the origin of its excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity. Further analysis based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ti 3d indicates that only the rhombic Ti3+ is localized in the bulk, rather than on the surface of obtained TiO2−x NPs. It can be inferred that the electronic structure of blue titania NPs is determined by the unique defective and non-stoichiometric TiO2−x core and stoichiometric TiO2 shell structure. As a consequence, our samples show excellent stability and retain their blue color upon storage in ambient atmosphere for at least one year. The structure, crystallinity and morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized systematically. The blue TiO2−x NPs exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for the photooxidation of methylene blue than the commercial P25 NPs under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). It is found that the molar ratio of Ti4+–Ti3+ in the reaction system plays a key role in the photocatalytic activity of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x under visible light since the electronic structures of the resulting TiO2−x NPs can be finely tuned by the molar ratios of Ti4+–Ti3+ in the precursors. The optimal molar ratio of Ti4+–Ti3+ is 1:40, at which the obtained titania NPs display a deep blue appearance and the highest catalytic activity. Therefore, our present work highlights the feasibility of simultaneous engineering of surface energetics and optical properties for designing novel TiO2-based nanomaterials.
Introduction
Since Honda and Fujishima first discovered their ability to decompose water and produce hydrogen under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation,1 TiO2-based materials have been intensively studied and used as water-splitting photocatalysts due to their large availability, low cost, non-toxicity and high chemical stability.2 However, their relatively wide band gap (3.2 eV for anatase) significantly limit their photocatalytic applications, because only about 4% of the available sunlight energy can be utilized.3 The increasing demand for low-cost and high-efficiency materials capable of solar energy generation is highly desired. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to regulate the band structure of TiO2, making it sensitive to visible light. Many studies have been reported to shift the absorption of TiO2 toward the visible light region such as doping titania with metal ions (e.g., V, Fe, Cu, etc.) or nonmetal (e.g., N, C, I) or rare earth elements.4 However, later studies, both theoretical and experimental, have demonstrated that doping does not translate into higher photocatalytic activity because the impurity or defect states can trap electrons and facilitate non-radiative recombination, which will reduce the photocatalytic performance.5 Thus, great efforts remain to be made on the band gap engineering of TiO2 based materials into visible light response.
More recently, self-doping by Ti3+ and/or oxygen vacancies in TiO2 has been reported as an effective way to extend the light absorption of TiO2-based materials into the visible-light region due to the fact that the energy of the localized state is (0.75–1.18 eV) below the conduction band minimum.6 Compared with the conventional doping methods, oxygen vacancy is a kind of self-doping without introducing any impurity elements, which is considered to be more favorable for preserving the intrinsic crystal structure of TiO2, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, a low Ti3+ doping concentration only creates localized oxygen vacancy states that usually deteriorate the electron mobility and exhibit negligible visible light photoactivity. Several techniques were reported to produce reduced TiO2 containing a high concentration of Ti3+. Zuo et al.7 reported the synthesis of nonstoichiometric blue TiO2 using a combustion reaction. Zheng et al.8 used a metallic zinc-assisted method to synthesize Ti3+ doped TiO2−x with tunable phase composition for the visible-light photocatalytic reaction. Chen et al.9 obtained black TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with ∼1.0 eV band gap through high pressure hydrogenation of crystalline TiO2. Some other methods were also employed to produce TiO2 containing Ti3+ species such as UV irradiation,10 plasma treatment,11 laser,12 or γ-ray,13 bombardment. Although these methods have their own advantages, they are much limited by high cost and complicated procedures and not suitable for large-scale production. Moreover, there have been very limited reports paying close attention to the relationship between phase structure, oxygen vacancy concentration and photocatalytic activity up to date.
In this work, we have developed an effective strategy for the synthesis of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x NPs with abundant defects using a simple solvothermal approach. In contrast to the previous reduction-based procedure14 and oxidation-based techniques,15,16 the incorporation of Ti3+ into the TiO2 matrix is directly originated from the precursor of TiCl3, which is an abundant and widely used industrial material. The aim of Ti4+ addition in the reaction system is to inhibit oxidation of Ti3+ during the solvothermal treatment:Ti3+ + oxygen species ⇆ Ti4+which is governed by Le Chatelier's principle. Ti3+ will not be completely oxidized to Ti4+ during a solvothermal process, and thus the oxygen vacancy formation is dominantly derived from Ti3+. Based on the above analysis, Ti3+ self-doped and oxygen-deficient anatase TiO2−x NPs can be fabricated by a one-step solvothermal method using TiCl3 and TiF4 as starting materials. The as-prepared samples show enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity and stability due to the large surface area and high concentration doping of Ti3+ in the bulk of TiO2−x NPs. Our developed solvothermal method could lead to a large-scale and low cost production of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x photocatalysts with highly efficient performances.
Experimental section
Photocatalyst preparation
Titanium trichloride (TiCl3) and anhydrous ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, and titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4, 98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by the solvothermal method using TiCl3 and TiF4 as precursors. Briefly, a desired amount of TiF4 powder was mixed with 5 mL of anhydrous alcohol under vigorous stirring. The suspension was continuously stirred for 30 min at room temperature until a homogeneous solution was obtained. After that, 2 mL of TiCl3 was added, the solution color turned into light purple immediately. Finally, the mixed solution was transferred into a dried, Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 15 mL, and then heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the blue or light-blue precipitates were collected, washed three times with deionized water and absolute ethanol. In a similar procedure, a series of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x (with different molar ratios of Ti4+–Ti3+, r = 0, 1:5, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80 and 1:120, respectively) nanoparticles were synthesized using different TiCl3 to TiF4 feed ratios by varying the amount of TiF4. The corresponding samples with color ranging from white to deep blue were dried in an oven overnight for measurements.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
The photocatalytic activity of the samples reflected by decolorization of methylene blue (MB) aqueous solutions was measured at room temperature with exterior irradiation. Prior to photocatalytic activity measurements, the fluorinated surface of the samples was cleaned with 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution and distilled water for three times to remove the adsorbed fluorine ions, and dried at 80 °C.17 The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300/300UV, Trusttech Co., Ltd. Beijing) equipped with an ultraviolet cutoff filter to block light in the ultraviolet (UV) region. Briefly, 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 25 mL of a 2 × 10−5 M aqueous solution of MB in a reactor with a double layer cooled by running water to keep the temperature unchanged. Prior to irradiation, the suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and MB. Then, the suspension was illuminated by the Xe lamp combined with a UV cutoff filter under magnetic stirring. At given time intervals, about 2 mL aliquots were sampled, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter to remove the remaining particles. The quantitative measurements of the MB concentration at different time intervals can be determined by the absorption peak at λ = 664 nm using a UV 1800PC spectrophotometer (Shanghai Mapada Instruments). For comparison, blank experiments without catalyst were also carried out. Additionally, the recycle experiments were performed for 5 consecutive cycles to test the durability. After each cycle, the catalyst was filtered and washed thoroughly with distilled water several times to remove residual impurities, and then dried at 60 °C for the next test.
Photoelectrochemical test systems were composed of a CHI 660D electrochemistry potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Limited, China), a 300 W xenon lamp with cutoff filters (λ ≥ 400 nm), and a homemade three-electrode cell with Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and 1 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. TiO2 and Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x electrodes were prepared by depositing suspensions (the concentration of TiO2 or Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x dissolved by absolute ethanol is 15 mg mL−1) onto Ti foil using the doctor-blade coating method with a glass rod and scotch tape as a frame and spacer, respectively. The electrodes were annealed at 90 °C for 12 h. During the measurements, the electrodes were pressed against a shape of an electrochemical cell with a working area of 4.0 cm2.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using a Rigaku/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The SEM images were taken using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6701F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images were obtained using a JEOL-2010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed. All the samples were prepared by depositing a drop of diluted suspensions in ethanol on a carbon-film-coated copper grid. A Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Model 2501 PC) was used to record the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples in the region of 220 to 800 nm. BaSO4 was used as the reflectance standard material. Raman spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer 400F Raman Spectrometer using a 514.5 nm laser beam. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed with a Perkin-Elmer RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer (140 K, 9064 MHz, 0.998 mW, X-band). The g values were determined using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) standard. FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus spectrometer on samples embedded in KBr pellets. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system utilizing Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) calculations for surface area.
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of as-prepared blue Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x nanoparticles (denoted as TiO2−x NPs) was investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. As shown in Fig. 1a, all the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the tetragonal phase of anatase TiO2 crystals with calculated lattice parameters of a = 3.76 Å and c = 9.39 Å without any impurity phases according to Bragg's law, consistent with the standard diffraction data (JCPDS no. 84-1285). The broadening of the diffraction peaks is indicative of the small size of the obtained nanoparticles. The change in the molar ratios of Ti4+–Ti3+ in the reaction system has little effect on the crystal phase of TiO2−x NPs and all samples well crystallized into an anatase phase following the solvothermal treatment (Fig. S1 of ESI†). The SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1b and c) of the obtained TiO2−x NPs reveal that these NPs have a small and uniform size with an average size of ca. 15 nm. The average grain size of obtained TiO2−x NPs is about 16.7 nm, as calculated from the (101) reflection of the samples using the Debye–Scherrer formula, which is consistent with the TEM observation. The change of the raw material molar ratio does not significantly affect the grain size of the NPs (see Fig. S2 of ESI†). Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM image of a representative nanocrystal. The distinguished two-dimensional lattice fringes indicate that the obtained TiO2−x sample is well crystallized. Two sets of lattices with an equal lattice fringe spacing of 0.36 nm and an interfacial angle of 82°, corresponding to the (011) and (101) planes of anatase TiO2, can be observed. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirms that the sample contains only the elements Ti and O (Fig. S3†).

The optical response of reduced titania compared to that of commercially available anatase is shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that commercial stoichiometric anatase only responds to ultraviolet light due to its intrinsic wide band gap. For the Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x sample (Fig. 2, blue line), the considerably large absorption tail in the visible and NIR regions is observed, which is consistent with the change in color of the powders from white to deep blue (inset in Fig. 2a), thus giving clear evidence that the non-stoichiometric TiO2−x NPs contain a large number of oxygen vacancies.6a,18 As titania is an indirect semiconductor, the plots of (αhν)1/2versus the energy of the absorbed light would give the band gap of the titania samples. As shown in Fig. 2b, the calculated band gap of TiO2−x NPs is ∼3.25 eV, which is very close to the typical band gap of 3.2 eV reported for anatase. These results indicate that Ti3+ induced visible-light absorption would be formed as isolated states between the forbidden gap in TiO2, as reported previously,19 rather than a shift in the position of either band edge, as typically occurs as a result of doping with foreign atoms.20,21 Theoretical studies also demonstrated that a high oxygen vacancy concentration could form an electronic state vacancy band below the conduction band.22

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to investigate the chemical state of Ti to gain more insight into the oxygen vacancies in the TiO2−x samples and the XPS spectrum of Ti 2p is shown in Fig. 3, which exhibits two peaks at 458.1 and 463.8 eV with a spin–orbital doublet splitting (Δ, Ti 2p1/2–Ti 2p3/2) of 5.7 eV, which are assigned to the 4+ oxidation state of titanium as Ti4+.23 No peak corresponding to Ti3+ is detected, which should appear around 457.6 eV.24 These results demonstrate that the surface of blue TiO2−x is dominated by Ti4+, ruling out the presence of Ti3+, indicating that a stoichiometric TiO2 nanoshell was formed on the surfaces of non-stoichiometric TiO2−x core-nanocrystals. The thickness of the TiO2 shell is more than 5 nm, larger than the detection limit of XPS.25 Notably, there is no change in blue color of TiO2−x NPs when kept in air for at least one year, this is due to the fact that the surface stoichiometric TiO2 shell protects the TiO2−x core with high stability. This is in sharp contrast to previously reported TiO2−x NPs such as titania reduced by H2, which are not stable, because oxygen vacancies stay at the surface of NPs.26

Low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to identify the presence of Ti3+ in TiO2−x cores. The EPR spectra were recorded at 140 K. At this temperature the anisotropic g tensors for the sample cannot be resolved. The sample TiO2−x (r = 1:40) gives rise to a very strong EPR signal at g = 1.93, which has previously been attributed to subsurface paramagnetic Ti3+ centers.27 It is worth noting that no signal is seen for the sample prepared only from TiCl3, indicating that Ti3+ is unstable and susceptible to oxidation by dissolved oxygen in solvent during the solvothermal treatment process in the absence of TiF4. Even more important is the fact that the EPR data exclude the presence of Ti3+ on the surface of our reduced TiO2−x since surface Ti3+ can efficiently govern O2 adsorption by trapping atmospheric oxygen molecules on defect sites, to form ˙O2−, and generating an EPR signal at g ≈ 2.02,28 which is absent in our spectrum (Fig. 4). These results are in good agreement with XPS measurements. To this end, it is concluded that our obtained blue titania NPs have a core–shell structure; the core is non-stoichiometric TiO2−x, the shell is stoichiometric TiO2, thus each NP is readily considered as a TiO2−x@TiO2 core–shell structure with Ti3+ localized in the core. Previous studies reported that the removal of lattice oxygen atoms can occur when stoichiometric TiO2 was heated at high temperature with reduced gas or vacuum. The interior Ti3+ can only be produced by heat treatment at high temperatures above 900 K.29 However, we obtained Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x with a high concentration of Ti3+ located in the bulk by a mild solvothermal process, the color of our sample was almost identical after storage in ambient atmosphere for at least one year. This excellent stability makes our TiO2−x NPs find high potentials in many practical applications. It is worth mentioning that blue TiO2−x can be fabricated at a large-scale: using a large autoclave (1000 mL) for the solvothermal treatment, several tens of grams of blue titania NPs can be obtained.

How does this observed phenomenon explain? Based on the data we have, the mechanism of formation of reduced TiO2 with self-doping can be proposed as: (i) Le Chatelier's rule is based on the principle that, if a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change, the equilibrium shifts to counteract the imposed change and a new equilibrium is established. In our system, TiF4 acts as the competitor, inhibiting the oxidation, and plays a key role in the crystal growth of self-doped blue titania. Oxidation is inevitable in the absence of TiF4, as shown in Fig. 3 and 4, and Ti3+ is almost completely converted to Ti(IV). Ti(III) oxo species are produced in the present solutions by alcoholysis of TiCl3, consisting of partly dehydrated polymeric Ti(III) hydroxide, which is assumed to be an important intermediate between Ti3+ and TiO2−x. The chemical reactions for the synthesis of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x can be expected to follow non-hydrolytic processes as reported before,18,24a,30 however, more detailed studies are underway. (ii) Interestingly, nano-scale TiO2 shells have indeed grown on the surface of self-doped TiO2−x core-crystals. The thin TiO2 layer on the surface protects Ti3+ from being oxidized by oxygen dissolved in solvent, making it beneficial for the catalytic reaction in the aqueous phase. Thus, this unusual photocatalyst could be expected to exhibit greatly enhanced stability in the photocatalytic reaction without the loss of catalytic activity. Further extension of this new approach for the synthesis of other non-stoichiometric nanomaterials and the deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of this novel TiO2−x@TiO2 core–shell NP are under study.
Structural characters of self-doped TiO2−x were further examined by measuring Raman scattering. The Raman-active modes of the anatase phase were detected, appearing at around 144, 399, 518, and 639 cm−1 for TiO2−x NPs and commercial anatase titania, as shown in Fig. 5. The results confirm that the Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x sample is composed of the anatase phase, consistent with the XRD results. It is well known that Raman spectroscopy, which is originated from the vibration of molecular bonds with high measuring sensitivity, is a simple, efficient, well-established technique and accurate alternative approach to study the significant structural changes in titania.31 The right inset in Fig. 5 is the Raman spectrum between 90 and 200 cm−1. The Eg mode appeared at 144 cm−1 for commercial anatase titania shifts to a higher frequency (150 cm−1) and accompanied by a peak broadening effect in comparison with blue TiO2−x NPs. This is attributed to the presence of lattice disorder resulting from non-stoichiometric TiO2−x NPs as a result of oxygen vacancies.32

The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared blue TiO2−x samples was evaluated by the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) irradiation. A blank experiment in the absence of catalyst was also performed as a control. TiO2−x samples show good catalytic activity and the blue color of the MB solution gradually diminishes upon visible light irradiation, indicating the degradation of MB. Total concentrations of dye aqueous solution were simply determined from the maximum absorption (λ = 664 nm) measurements by UV-vis spectra. C/C0 was used to describe the degradation efficiency which stands for the concentration ratio after and before a certain period of reaction time. The molar ratio (r) of Ti4+–Ti3+ in the solvothermal reaction system is an important factor affecting the photocatalytic activity of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x. The effects of the as-obtained samples with different Ti4+–Ti3+ molar ratios on the photocatalytic activity were systematically studied. Fig. 6a shows the dependence of the photodegradation of MB over samples prepared at different molar ratios of Ti4+–Ti3+. With an increase of r, the photocatalytic activity first increases and then decreases. The sample prepared at r = 1:40 exhibits the highest photodegradation efficiency of MB, about 94.4% of MB dye molecules was degraded within 90 min, and it took about 120 min to completely decompose the dye molecules. In contrast, sample TiO2 (r = 0) only decomposed 55.3% of MB under the same experimental conditions. The characteristic absorption band of MB at 664 nm diminishes quickly, accompanied by a slight concomitant blue-shift from 664 to 610 nm of the maximum absorption, as shown in Fig. 6b. This hypsochromic shift of the major absorption peak has been attributed to a step-by-step N-demethylation derivative generated from the MB reduction process.33 The inset photographs in Fig. 6b show the corresponding color changes of the dye solution with the increasing reaction time. It is found that the relative order of reactivity for the various synthesized catalysts is TiO2−x (r = 1:40) > TiO2−x (r = 1:80) > TiO2−x (r = 1:20) > TiO2−x (r = 1:120) > TiO2−x (r = 1:5) > TiO2 (r = 0). The color of the samples gives an additional information about the effect of the molar ratio of Ti4+–Ti3+ on the photocatalyst properties: the samples exhibit white, off white, sky blue, deep blue, sky blue and light blue color from TiO2 (r = 0) to TiO2−x (r = 1:120), respectively, reflecting their different absorption in the visible light region. Remarkable absorption enhancement in the visible light region is beneficial for efficient photocatalytic activity. It is noted that the pure MB solution almost does not decompose without a catalyst (Fig. 6a). The photodegradation ability on MB solutions of P25 TiO2 in comparison to TiO2−x samples was also investigated. The degradation rate for P25 is slightly higher than that of TiO2−x (r = 0) and about 38% of MB remains in the solution after 2 h irradiation. We have carried out additional control experiments for synthesizing TiO2 and measuring photocatalytic activity (Fig. S6†) using TiF4 as a second reference. This sample shows lower photocatalytic activity than that of TiO2−x under visible light irradiation (see Fig. S6† and 6a). Obviously, more F− introduced in TiO2 did not enhance visible light photocatalytic performance. We ascribe the superior photodegradation activity of TiO2−x to the incorporation of Ti3+ into the bulk TiO2−x lattice matrix and the introduction of isolated states in the band gap instead of the influence of F species. It might also be argued that the larger surface area expected for the sample with a smaller grain size is a leading cause for the performance improvement. We measured the surface area of obtained samples to quantitatively compare the photocatalytic performance, and find that TiO2−x (r = 1:40) has a lower BET surface area (SBET) than P25 (37.2 m2 g−1versus 52.1 m2 g−1). As these catalysts have different specific surface areas, their specific rates of dye degradation (per unit surface area of catalyst), which represents the intrinsic photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2. The apparent rate constant for MB photodegradation (kMB) was calculated using the pseudo-first-order approximation. Dividing kMB by SBET gives the normalized rate constant of MB photodegradation (k′MB).34,35 As shown in Fig. S8,† the surface area normalization constant for TiO2−x (r = 1:40) is 6.2 times higher than that of commercial Degussa P25. The significant photocatalytic enhancement is due to the considerable enhancement of light absorption and the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs that is exclusively achieved by self-doping. In order to exclude the possibility that the dye was photodegraded instead of being adsorbed on the surface of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x powders, FTIR analysis of samples before and after photocatalytic degradation was carried out. All the samples for the FTIR measurements were recovered and dried in an oven at 60 °C without washing by water. As displayed in Fig. S9,† the IR features of TiO2−x before and after the photocatalytic reaction remain almost identical, no characteristic IR peaks belonging to MB were observed after photodegradation on TiO2−x, further confirming that MB molecules can be thoroughly mineralized.

To further confirm the high electron–hole pair concentration and efficient charge emigration to the surface of Ti3+ self doped TiO2−x NPs, the photocurrent response experiments were carried out on a photoelectrochemical test device fabricated by drop casting TiO2 and Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x (r = 1:40) NP dispersed alcohol onto an Ti foil substrate (see the Experimental section). These photocurrent results support the photocatalytic activity measurements very well (Fig. 7). It is found that the photocurrent response of as-prepared TiO2−x NPs is fairly reversible and stable, implying that the current can reproducibly increase violently under each irradiation and recover rapidly in the dark. Otherwise, the photocurrent response of stoichiometric TiO2 reveals a lower photocurrent under several on/off irradiation cycles as compared to TiO2−x. Higher photocurrent means lower recombination of electron–hole pairs, efficient photoelectron emigration, and more light absorption for the Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x electrode, which will eventually contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. The stability and enhancement of the photocurrents have clearly demonstrated the advantages of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x for the highly improved photocatalytic activity.

In addition to the photocatalytic activity, the stability of photocatalysts is another important issue for their practical applications. Therefore, we carried out cycling experiments and all the conditions were kept unchanged during the cycling tests. As described in Fig. 8a, the obtained Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x sample for the degradation of MB shows a slight decline in the five successive cycling experiment tests, in which the removal of MB was found to be 98.6, 96, 96, 93 and 86%, respectively, at a reaction time of 2 h. In addition, the EPR spectra for the used blue titania recorded after the reaction and comparison with that of the fresh blue titania sample are shown in Fig. 8b, from which it can be clearly observed that the area representing the reduced Ti3+ sites was almost identical after the reaction without obvious change, further confirming that our Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x is stable enough during the photocatalytic process.
 Fig. 8  (a) Cycling runs in the photodegradation of MB in the presence of TiO2−x (r = 1:40), and (b) EPR spectra of the sample measured before and after the photocatalytic reaction by visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). 
Based on the above results, several factors have been considered for the improved photocatalytic efficiency of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x NPs.
(i) It is well known that photocatalysis over titania (or other semiconductors) is usually considered to be initiated upon absorbing a photon whose energy is greater than the band gap energy and generating photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Then the photoexcited electrons and holes separate and migrate to the surface of the catalyst to participate in the next step of redox reactions. Therefore, a strong absorption in the visible region is a prerequisite for the visible light photocatalytic reaction. We ascribe the superior photodegradation activity of TiO2−x to the incorporation of Ti3+ into the TiO2−x lattice matrix. In general, the existence of Ti3+ in the TiO2 lattice matrix indicates that the oxygen vacancies will be generated to maintain the electrostatic balance according to the following chemical equation:364Ti4+ + O2− → 4Ti4+ + 2e−/□ + 0.5O2 → 2Ti4+ + Ti3+–□–Ti3+ + 0.5O2
The □ represents an empty position originating from the removal of O2− ion in the lattice. It has been reported that the Ti3+ doping and accompanying oxygen vacancies can produce isolated states in the forbidden gap.15 These Ti3+ defects (abbreviated here as Vo–Ti3+) are occupied states and usually act as electron donors. Thus, the relative position of energy band of Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x is proposed in Scheme 1. Electrons in these isolated sites are excited to the conduction band (CB) by visible light illumination. Meanwhile, the electrons in the valence band (VB) can be excited to these unoccupied sites. Therefore, electronic transitions from Vo–Ti3+ localized states to the CB, and from the VB to Vo–Ti3+, are responsible for the blue TiO2−x vis-NIR absorption (λ ≥ 400 nm). The excited electrons and transferred electrons can be trapped by surface oxygen to form ˙O2−, ˙HO2 and H2O2, then the ˙OH can be formed by reacting ˙O2− or electrons with H2O2. The reactive species, such as ˙O2−, ˙HO2, ˙OH and holes, could attack the organic pollutants until dye molecules are completely degraded. Because the reaction ability of these oxygen-containing active free radicals is high enough to attack any organic molecules, it has been assigned as key species in the mineralization mechanism of the photooxidation of dye molecules.37 In our system, the potential of the VB can be kept at a deep level with strong oxidation power without shifting the band edge. Holes accumulated on the VB could react with surface-bound H2O or OH− in the solvent, generating ˙OH radicals adsorbed at the surface. The relevant reactions occurring at the blue titania surface and transfer of photogenerated carriers involved in the MB degradation process under visible-light irradiation are shown in Fig. S10 in the ESI.†

(ii) A high photocatalytic activity of reduced TiO2−x under visible light illumination was observed as previously reported by Hamdy et al.38 Although their blue titania catalysts showed better photoactivity and higher ketone selectivity than the commercial titania catalysts, they could not maintain such activity for a long period of time and were largely deactivated after the first run. Xing et al.26 used a low-temperature vacuum-activated method to modify the commercial titanium to generate Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies in P25. However, the grey color of vacuum activated P25 gradually became lighter after light illumination, needing further vacuum de-activation to return back. It is worth noting that a new break-through in developing reduced TiO2−x was reported by Murray's group.18 They reported the non-aqueous surfactant-assisted synthesis of highly uniform anatase TiO2 NCs obtained through a seeded growth technique. The introduction of titanium(IV) fluoride (TiF4) preferentially exposes the {001} facet of anatase through in situ release of hydrofluoric acid (HF) and results in TiO2 NCs that are blue in color and display a broad UV-visible-IR absorbance. XPS studies indicated a fraction of Ti3+ species present on the surface. The blue color was stable in air for months without noticeable changes in the absorbance, which is probably due to the fact that the as-prepared nanocrystal surfaces were capped and stabilized by surfactants, and Ti3+ defects existed on nanocrystal surfaces. While in our case, the obtained blue titania sample is pure and stable without any surfactant protection. The Ti3+ defect sites in the self-doped TiO2−x bulk are highly stable in water under light irradiation and the photocatalyst can be repeatedly used without a significant decrease in activity. From XPS and EPR analyses, as shown in Fig. 3 and 4, it can be observed that no Ti3+ defects are present on the surface of these self-doped samples. It is suggested that the unique crystalline structure of blue TiO2−x NPs is composed of a defective and disordered core (TiO2−x) and an intact shell (TiO2); oxygen vacancies are present in the bulk core, while the outer shell appears to be stoichiometric. The shell of blue TiO2−x NPs might originate from the partial oxidation of Ti3+ during the solvothermal treatment. Moreover, the TiF4 added initially together with TiCl3 forms a Ti4+–Ti3+ pair, which can effectively inhibit the further oxidation of Ti3+ in the core during the solvothermal process. This unique core–shell nanostructure plays a key role in a significant increase in the photocatalytic activity for MB degradation. The stoichiometric TiO2 shell effectively blocks oxidation between the Ti3+ and dissolved oxygen in water, thereby allowing long-term usage. Therefore, it is not surprising that our Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x sample for the degradation of MB still shows very high photocatalytic activity after 5 cycles without obvious decline.
(iii) We have optimized the experimental conditions like the molar ratio between TiCl3 and TiF4 in precursors, as shown in Fig. 6. The molar ratio of Ti3+ to Ti4+ in precursors seriously influences the Ti3+ defect concentration of final Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x NPs, which is important for efficient visible light activity. With the TiCl3 content in the precursors increasing, the photodegradation rate of obtained samples first increases and then decreases. The optimal molar ratio of Ti4+–Ti3+ is 1:40, at which the sample shows a deep blue appearance and displays the highest catalytic activity. The surface area normalization constant k′MB for Ti3+ self-doped TiO2−x is 6.2 times higher than that of commercial P25. The influence of the varied molar ratio of Ti4+–Ti3+ on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2−x NPs is two-fold: the addition of a small amount of Ti4+ in the solvothermal system should allow incorporation of more Ti3+ into the self-doped TiO2−x lattice matrix according to Le Chatelier's principle on the one hand, and excessive Ti4+ to Ti3+ would lead to a decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration in the final NPs, thus weakening the absorption capability of the samples in the visible light region on the other. The former is favorable for the photocatalytic reaction because it extends the photoresponse of TiO2−x from UV to visible light and provides important reactive agents for adsorbates and leads to the reduction in the recombination rate of an electron–hole pair, whereas the latter shows a negative effect on the catalytic reaction. These results show that a high content of Ti3+ is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic activity of self-doped TiO2−x NPs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized novel blue colored TiO2−x NPs exhibiting a defective and disordered core and a stoichiometric shell through a one-step solvothermal method. The as-prepared samples have been demonstrated to be highly photocatalytically active under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm), and the highest photocatalytic activity is found for the sample prepared at the molar ratio of TiCl3/TiF4 = 1:40, which is more active than either P25 or other reduced TiO2−x synthesized under the same conditions. On the basis of TEM, UV-DRS, XPS, EPR, and Raman spectra analyses, the high photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the unique disordered core/ordered shell. The stoichiometric TiO2 shell protects the TiO2−x NP core from further oxidation, and effectively blocks oxidation between the Ti3+ and dissolved oxygen in solvent, thereby allowing long-term recycling stability. A high concentration of bulk Ti3+ defects which can generate midgap electronic states within the band gap of TiO2 NPs significantly improves the e–h separation efficiency, thus greatly enhancing the photocatalytic activity. As a result, its efficient visible light activity is highly stable in water and can be repeatedly used for a long period of time. Our present strategy has some advantages, such as simplicity, convenience, controllability and reproducibility. We believe that the findings of this work may also be applicable to fabricate other nanostructures and provide potential applications of tailored solar energy conversion devices with a low cost.
