    , Accepted 18th May 2022First published on 1st June 2022AbstractIn this work, we introduce in situ diluted (ISD) hydrothermal synthesis of a titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanode and suggest a novel microwave-assisted surface attachment (MASA) method for fabricating an aluminium–titanium co-doped photoanode. The charge-carrier density of a hematite photoanode increases with Ti4+ doping, which offers lower bulk resistance. Through MASA treatment, Al3+ ions can be attached homogeneously on the surface of a Ti–FeOOH film from aqueous aluminium chloride. The charge recombination is weaker after the successful diffusion of Al3+ and partial formation of self-induced Al2O3, which acts as a surface passivation layer. The synergistic interaction of Al co-doping and surface passivation cathodically shifts the onset potential by 120 mV and enhances the photocurrent density to 1.32 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. RHE). MASA treatment not only improves the bulk characteristics of the photoanode but also enhances the surface injection efficiency which promotes water-splitting. The charge-transfer mechanism for the prepared photoanodes was also studied extensively.
1. Introduction
Using solar energy to power photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen is one of the most promising approaches to producing clean, renewable fuels.1 The main component of a PEC cell is its semiconducting photoelectrode, which should effectively absorb solar energy and convert that energy to the chemical form. In recent years, oxide semiconductors have been extensively investigated for their use in PEC water-splitting.2 Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is a promising metal-oxide candidate because of its favorable bandgap of 2.1 eV, chemical stability, maximum theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (14–16.8%), lack of toxicity, and low cost.3 However, the PEC performance-related advantages of hematite are undermined by an improper conduction-band position, a short diffusion length (2–4 nm) for photogenerated holes, poor conductivity, and reduced oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.4,5 To overcome these drawbacks, a variety of approaches have been explored. For example, nanostructure techniques can help suppress electron–hole recombination issues and increase light absorption efficiency, while introducing metal dopants into the lattice can increase charge-carrier density.6,7
Doping hematite with various metal ions, such as silicon, titanium, zirconium, manganese, and aluminium, can improve conductivity and enhance PEC performance.8,9 Aluminium in particular is a promising candidate for reducing surface defects and balancing the charge valence in bulk hematite.10 Al3+ contracts crystal lattices by isovalent replacement of Fe3+, which encourages small polaron migration and improves conductivity. Surface passivation with Al3+ was recently reported. Fu et al. demonstrated a cathodic shift (100 mV) of the photocurrent onset potential after surface treatment of Al3+ on titanium-doped Fe2O3.11 A similar result was reported by Jeong et al., in which aluminium–zirconium co-doping showed a cathodic shift in the hematite onset potential of approximately 560 mV as well as an increase of 0.7 mA cm−2 in photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).12
Over the past few decades, efforts to find alternatives to conventional energy-intensive heating technologies have led the scientific community to consider microwave energy, which offers the potential for rapid and selective heating.13 Microwave heating is a volumetric process in which rapid and selective heating is generated within the material itself via solvent molecular dipole moments. Ghobadifard et al. prepared pure single-phase ZnFe2O4 using microwave irradiation in a short period of time.14 Other reports describe the synthesis of nanomaterials through microwave heating, and these nanomaterials have proved to be effective in various applications, including PEC applications.15–19 However, microwave heating, and the selective heating of synthesized compounds for surface treatment in particular, requires more study before it can be widely deployed.
Here, for the first time, we introduce in situ diluted (ISD) hydrothermal and novel microwave-assisted surface attachment (MASA) methods for co-doping of Ti/Al into a crystal lattice of Fe2O3. Photoelectrochemical characterization of the prepared photoanodes revealed the role of each dopant in water oxidation kinetics. The synergistic effect of Ti4+ doping increases charge-carrier density and lowers bulk resistance, while Al3+ doping decreases surface defects and contributes to cathodic onset shifting. An optimized Co-Pi/Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode can maintain stable photocurrent density and impressive hydrogen–oxygen gas evolution kinetics in an alkali-based electrolyte for 5 h.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes by an in situ diluted hydrothermal method
Fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in a mixed solution of deionized water (DI), ethanol, and acetone for 30 min. The ISD hydrothermal method refers to the low-concentration FeOOH film-synthesis procedure we reported previously.20 In a typical procedure, a piece of cleaned FTO substrate (1 cm × 2.5 cm) is placed inside a vial with a volume of 20 mL and containing 10 mL of an aqueous solution of FeCl3·6H2O (4.5 mM; Fe), NaNO3, and sufficient HCl to adjust the pH to 1.5. Next, 1 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide-bis(acetylacetonate) precursor solution (4 mol% iron) dissolved in ethanol was added dropwise to the resulting solution. The concentration of the titanium precursor in the hydrothermal solution varied with respect to the concentration of iron but was optimized in the range of 0–8 mol% iron. A hydrothermal reaction then took place at 100 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the deposited thin-film FTO was rinsed several times with DI water and dried under an air stream. The prepared photoanodes were thermally quenched at a high temperature (800 °C) for 10 min to enable a phase transition from β-FeOOH to α-Fe2O3; the sample was denoted as Ti(x%):Fe2O3 (where x refers to the number of moles). For comparison, we also prepared a titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanode without dilution. The experimental details of the without-dilution sample is discussed in the ESI.† To prepare the ethanol-based, undoped reference photoanode, 1 mL of ethanol solvent was added to the in situ hydrothermal precursor solution as a substitute for titanium.21 The prepared sample, EtOH:FeOOH, can be converted to EtOH:Fe2O3 through high-temperature quenching. The calcination conditions remained similar to preparing titanium-doped photoanodes.
2.2 
          Ex situ aluminium doping by microwave-assisted surface attachment on Ti:FeOOH
To prepare the Al/Ti co-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, MASA was applied to the as-prepared Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanode, two pieces of which were mounted on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrate holder. Then, a PTFE bottle (Teflon autoclave) was filled with 50 mL of a 5 mM AlCl3 aqueous precursor solution. The Teflon bottle was placed in a household microwave oven (2450 MHz, 800 W) for 2 min. Finally, the treated Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanodes were washed gently with DI water and dried at room temperature. The naturally dried aluminium-deposited film was sintered at 800 °C for 10 min, and the prepared sample was denoted as Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3. For comparison, an ex situ titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanode was prepared by conventional dip-coating. The experimental details of the ex situ titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanode are discussed in the ESI.†
A Co-Pi (cobalt phosphate) co-catalyst was electrodeposited on the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes using an electrolyte containing cobalt nitrate (0.5 mM) and potassium phosphate (0.1 M) as the aqueous solution, as described previously.22 The electrodeposition, the conditions for which are fixed as demonstrated in our previous work,12 was carried out in a three-electrode cell using Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode at an applied potential of 0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 10 min. A current density between 2 and 4 μA cm−2 was observed during electrodeposition.
2.3 Characterization
The crystal structure and the preferential orientation of the prepared photoelectrodes were studied using synchrotron-radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) measurements in the BL5A materials science beamline at Pohang Light Source II (PLS-II) in Korea. A wavelength of 0.1072 nm (11.57 keV) was used and data were recorded as conventional 2θ measurements. The morphology of the prepared photoanodes on the FTO substrate was examined using high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (HR-FESEM, Hitachi SU8230) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) at the Jeonju Center of the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). The absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu ultraviolet (UV)-visible light spectrophotometer (UV-2600). The bandgap energy (Eg) of the samples was estimated using eqn (1):23 (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg),(1)where, h is Planck's constant, ν is the photon frequency, α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the bandgap energy, A is a proportionality constant, and n is an exponent that depends on the nature of the electronic transitions (n = 2 for indirect transitions in Fe2O3). For the synthesized samples, the chemical state was examined and elemental quantification performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (ℏν = 1486.6 eV, 25 W, 15 kV) at the Center for Research Facilities of Kongju National University. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Frontier spectrometer via attenuated total reflection with a diamond/KRS-5 (thallium bromoiodide) crystal. To reveal the local structure of the photoanodes, X-ray absorption experiments were conducted on the 7D beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II, 3.0 GeV). Fluorescence spectra were recorded for the iron K-edge (E0 = 7112 eV) on undoped, titanium-doped, aluminium-doped, and Al/Ti co-doped hematite photoanodes. The incident X-ray beam was detuned by 20% to 7112 eV to attenuate the flux from higher-order Bragg diffraction of silicon (111) crystals in the monochromator, and beam intensity was monitored with a helium-filled ionization chamber (IC Spec, FMB Oxford). The fluorescence signal from the sample was measured using a Lytle-type detector combined with a passivated implanted planar silicon diode. The backgrounds were removed from the obtained spectra, which were normalized using ATHENA from the IFEFFIT suite of programs.24 Structural and chemical information for the prepared samples was obtained using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL ARM-200F) operated at 200 kV and equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometer at the Center for University-Wide Research Facilities at Jeonbuk National University. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) studies were performed using a confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, PicoQuant, Germany) at the Daegu Center of the KBSI. A pulsed diode laser (379 nm with a 30 ps pulse width and approximately 100 μW average power) was used as an excitation source, and emitted photons were detected using an avalanche photodiode (PDM series, MPD) and a time-correlated single-photon counting system (PicoHarp300, PicoQuant GmbH). Steady-state PL spectra were obtained in the spectral range of 420–730 nm using a tunable optical filter (KURIOS-VB1, Thorlabs) placed in front of the avalanche photodiode detector.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a three-electrode electrochemical cell, with a hematite photoanode as the working electrode, Hg/HgO as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution of 1.0 M NaOH (pH 13.6) was used as the electrolyte throughout the PEC measurements. The photoanode area was kept constant at 1.0 cm2 for all PEC measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (J–t) were performed using an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat. A standard global solar light AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 solar simulator was used for front illumination. The measured potential at the Hg/HgO electrode was converted to an RHE value using the Nernst equation (eqn (2)):25 (2)
Current density–potential (J–V) curves were recorded in the range of 0.3–1.7 V vs. RHE with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in 1 M NaOH under visible-light illumination at 1.10 and 1.23 V vs. RHE over a frequency range of 3 × 106 Hz to 5 × 10−1 Hz. An equivalent circuit was used to fit the Nyquist plots; it consisted of a series resistance (Rs) circuit, which is composed primarily of the sheet resistance of the FTO substrates, and two resistor–capacitor circuits, where R1 and CPE1 represent the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance across the bulk photoanodes (FTO/photoanodes), while R2 and CPE2 represent the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance across the surface states at the electrolyte interface, respectively.26 Mott–Schottky (MS) plots of the samples were obtained from 0.3–1.7 V vs. RHE at a frequency of 100 Hz in the dark. The donor density (Nd) can be estimated using eqn (3):27 (3)where, e0 is the charge of an electron (1.602 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of hematite (80), ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), A is the area of the photoanode, and C is the capacitance derived from the electrochemical impedance at varying values of potential (V). EFB is the flat band potential, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), and T is the temperature. The current density according to PEC performance (JPEC) can be described by eqn (4):28 JH2O = Jabs × ηbulk × ηsurface(4)where, Jabs is the photocurrent density if the absorbed photons are perfectly converted into current (i.e., absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) = 100%). It is important to note that the value of JH2O2 is measured for the as-prepared photoanodes by adding 0.5 M H2O2 to 1 M NaOH electrolyte and is independent of the surface H2O2 oxidation kinetics (when ηsurface ≈ 100%). Therefore, ηbulk and ηsurface can be calculated according to eqn (4), that is: ηsurface = JH2O/JH2O2(5) ηbulk = JH2O/Jabs(6) (7)where, JH2O is the photocurrent acquired from PEC water oxidation, JH2O2 is the photocurrent acquired from H2O2 oxidation, and P(λ) indicates the solar irradiance at wavelength λ.
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were performed on the same cell, using a green light-emitting diode with a peak wavelength of 520 nm and driven by a frequency-response analyzer. Light intensities were modulated to a depth of 10% and the frequency was swept from 10 kHz down to 0.1 Hz. The PEC solar hydrogen–oxygen generation tests were carried out in a three-electrode cell at room temperature with an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat under standard global solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). For the PEC water-splitting experiment, the Co-Pi/Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode served as the working electrode, while Pt wire and Hg/HgO acted as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Prior to the experiment, a blank test performed without irradiation indicated a lack of hydrogen/oxygen evolution. The evolution of oxygen and hydrogen was monitored using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (Agilent 7820, U.S.A.) and a 5 Å molecular sieve column.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis of Al/Ti co-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes via ISD hydrothermal synthesis was followed by MASA as shown in Scheme 1. First, Ti(4%):FeOOH nanocoral arrays were grown hydrothermally on an FTO substrate at 100 °C for 6 h. The samples were then exposed to microwave radiation, which rapidly generated hot spots on the surface of the Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanode due to selective absorption of microwave energy. As a result, “fluffy” Al(OH)3 clusters were formed and distributed homogeneously on its surface during 2 min of heating and were immobile due to their strong attachment to the surface of the nanocorals. The formed Al2O3 was observed to be amorphous. Finally, the Al3+ diffused into the hematite lattice after high-temperature quenching at 800 °C for 10 min, while residual Al2O3 formed on the surface of the Al/Ti co-doped Fe2O3.

To reveal the morphological changes in the prepared hematite photoanodes, the corresponding surface and cross-sectional images were recorded by HR-FESEM. As shown in Fig. 1, EtOH:Fe2O3 and titanium-doped Fe2O3 samples exhibited similar planar structures with some cracks. However, their morphologies varied significantly at different concentrations of titanium. According to the cross-section shown in Fig. 1d, the EtOH:Fe2O3 nanocorals grew on average to ca. 416 nm. However, when Fe2O3 samples were doped with 4% and 8% titanium, nanocoral growth was closer to 327 nm (Fig. 1e) and 212 nm (Fig. 1f), respectively. The diameter of the prepared samples decreased with increasing amounts of titanium (Fig. 1a–c), indicating that titanium influenced the morphology of FeOOH (on FTO). Fig. S1† shows the cross-sectional HR-FESEM images of EtOH:FeOOH, Ti(4%):FeOOH and Ti(8%):FeOOH photoanodes. When the amount of titanium precursor was increased from 0% to 8%, the average length of the prepared samples decreased from approximately 444 nm to 248 nm. This is due to the fact that, because titanium promotes rapid nucleation of hematite, the Fe3+ concentration fell quickly to a point where it was too low to support nanocoral growth.29 However, shortening the nanostructures also improved the rapidly photogenerated charge transport in Fe2O3-based photoanodes due to the reduced diffusion length.20

Fig. 2a depicts the synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) patterns of EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, and Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. The main characteristic diffraction peaks are indexed to the hematite phase (α-Fe2O3, JCPDS #33-0664, denoted as ‘H’) and one of the phases of iron oxide, while the remaining peaks can be attributed to the FTO substrate (F:SnO2, JCPDS #41-1445, denoted as ‘F’). No diffraction peaks of TiO2 or other iron oxide phases were observed in any of the samples. The absence of β-FeOOH (akaganeite) diffraction peaks indicates that all of the akaganeite phases were transformed into hematite during high-temperature quenching. Fig. 2b shows an enlarged view of the XRD profiles near the hematite (104) and (110) diffraction peaks. A change in the preferential orientation from hematite (110) to hematite (104) is evident in the relatively strong (104) peak for EtOH:Fe2O3. This change in orientation may be related to the formation of nanocoral. The tendency for orientational change can be described simply by applying the integrated intensity fraction (or ratio) of the (104) peak against the combined (104) and (110) intensity, i.e., I(104)/(I[104] + I[110]); the intensity ratio of the (104) peak is displayed in the inset of Fig. 2b. The Ti(4%):Fe2O3 sample has a weaker (104) intensity compared to the EtOH:Fe2O3 sample. However, the Ti(8%):Fe2O3 sample has a preferential orientation of (110). A study by Annamalai et al. demonstrated that in situ tin doping generated substantial numbers of grain boundaries (nanocorals) and less-conductive (104) phases. However, compared with ex situ tin doping, it retains the highly conductive (110) crystal plane and nanocoral morphology, which promote photocurrent density.29 The UV-vis absorbance spectra of EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, and Ti(8%):Fe2O3 hematite photoanodes are shown in Fig. S2a.† The optical indirect bandgap of the prepared photoanodes evaluated by Tauc plots is shown in Fig. S2b.† According to the Tauc plots, the optical bandgaps of the as-prepared photoanodes were near 2.1 eV, which is identical to the previously reported values for α-Fe2O3.6

The chemical composition and valence state of the EtOH and titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S3† depicts the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p, O 1s, Ti 2p, and Sn 3d for EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, and Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. The Fe 2p core-level spectra consist of two peaks at binding energies of 710.9 and 724.6 eV, which correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. S3a†). The deconvolution of Fe 2p reveals eight consistent peaks of Fe2+ and Fe3+ distribution; detailed information is shown in Table S1.† The satellite peak at 718 eV indicates that Fe3+ is the dominant species in the prepared samples, with decreases evident as the doping concentrations of titanium increase. The main O 1s peak is near 529.9 eV, which is consistent with the typical value for O 1s observed in Fe2O3 (Fig. S3b†).11 As shown in Fig. S3c,† the Ti 2p spectra for the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanodes consist of doublet peaks for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at binding energies of 458 and 463 eV, respectively. These can be attributed to the +4-oxidation state of titanium.30 Also, the intensity of the Ti 2p peaks increases with concentrations of the titanium dopant from the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode to the Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanode. Fig. S3d† depicts narrow-scan spectra for Sn 3d, which reveals two intense peaks near 486.4 and 495.8 eV, corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively. The peak intensity of tin in Ti(8%):Fe2O3 was higher than that of Ti(4%):Fe2O3, which suggests that a higher concentration of titanium dopants suppresses the growth of FeOOH and favors Sn4+ diffusion from the FTO substrate.
Prior to adopting ISD for preparing titanium-doped photoanodes, we prepared titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes without dilution and compared them with samples prepared via ex situ deposition. The Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a higher photocurrent density of 1.103 mA cm−2 compared to without-dilution (0.971 mA cm−2) and ex situ (0.932 mA cm−2) photoanodes, as shown in Fig. S4a.† Charge-transfer resistance of the photoanodes, as measured by EIS, was fitted with Nyquist plots (measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE) as shown in Fig. S4b,† and the corresponding EIS fitting results are listed in Table S2.† The in situ photoanode exhibited less charge transport resistance compared with the without-dilution and ex situ counterparts. Mott–Schottky (MS) plots are shown in Fig. S4c.† The in situ Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a higher donor density (Nd) value (5.73 × 1020 cm−3) compared with the photoanodes prepared without dilution (4.82 × 1020 cm−3) and ex situ (4.22 × 1020 cm−3). These results confirm that the improved PEC performance is mainly a result of facile charge transfer in the in situ Ti(4%):Fe2O3 due to more effective titanium doping in Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. The morphological changes due to titanium doping can be observed in the FESEM images; the in situ photoanode shows more evenly and highly distributed nanocoral morphology which implies the role of optimum facet size to facilitate the photogenerated charge carriers.

Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent density vs. potential (J–V) curves of the EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, and Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. The EtOH and titanium-doped photoanodes were found to have similar photocurrent densities at 1.23 V vs. RHE. As the applied potential continued to increase, the titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes achieved superior performance (1.66 and 1.38 mA cm−2 for 4% and 8% Ti doping, respectively) compared to the EtOH:Fe2O3 photoanode (1.36 mA cm−2) at 1.4 V vs. RHE.

Titanium doping in a hematite crystal lattice encourages bulk charge separation and suppresses electron–hole recombination. However, ISD titanium doping generated more surface trapping sites (surface states).11 These irregular surface states can trap the photogenerated holes, which do not participate in the water-oxidation reactions until a more positive potential is applied.20 In addition, Ti(8%):Fe2O3 exhibited a lower photocurrent density compared with Ti(4%):Fe2O3 due to the fact that higher concentrations of titanium promote rapid nucleation of hematite. As a result, the Fe3+ concentration fell quickly, making its concentration too low to support nanocoral growth.30 Table S1† depicts the XPS fitting of the Fe 2p core peak, which corresponds to a decrease in the intensity of the satellite Fe3+ peak. The XPS results confirm that the shoulder peak near 718 eV corresponds to Fe3+, decreases after 4% Ti doping, and decreases further after 8% Ti doping. It is also evident that Ti 2p peaks improved with 8% titanium doping compared to 4% doping, and in the case of Sn 3d, 8% titanium doping produced a higher peak due to diffusion of tin from FTO. A higher concentration of titanium therefore cannot support further improvement of photocurrent density. EIS recordings were made at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte under 1 sun illumination. The fitted impedance values are listed in Table S3.† The corresponding equivalent resistor–capacitor circuit used to fit the EIS plots is shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. After titanium doping, the R1 value decreased dramatically from 182.7 Ω for EtOH:Fe2O3 to 34.36 Ω for Ti(4%). However, R1 then increased to 47.63 Ω for Ti(8%):Fe2O3. This demonstrates that a suitable amount of titanium dopant (4%) effectively suppresses bulk resistance and hinders bulk recombination. To determine the donor density of the prepared photoanodes, MS plots were recorded at a frequency of 103 Hz, as shown in Fig. 3c. The Ti(4%):Fe2O3 had a higher Nd value (5.73 × 1020 cm−3) compared with that of EtOH:Fe2O3 (1.67 × 1020 cm−3). Additionally, the Ti(8%):Fe2O3 photoanodes achieved almost the same Nd value (5.89 × 1020 cm−3) as the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. This implies that a higher concentration of dopant does not guarantee a higher photocurrent (at 1.23 V vs. RHE) along with donor density. The flat band potentials (VFB) in Fig. 3c suggest that titanium-doped samples should have superior theoretical onset potentials, which contradicts the onset potential depicted in Fig. 3a, likely because the MS measurements are free from PEC water oxidation kinetics when estimating EFB. In PEC water-splitting, photogeneration of holes depends mainly upon the scanning potential, until and unless a redox reaction is involved when the potential reaches 1.23 V vs. RHE. However, at the optimal titanium concentration (4%), the photocurrent density was also higher at 1.4 V vs. RHE. To study the photo-responses of the EtOH and titanium-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes, their transient photocurrent densities were recorded in 1 M NaOH electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped-light illumination (Fig. 3d). All photoanodes achieved rapid and reproducible photo-responses after less than 10 s of illumination, signifying an effective charge transport in the samples.
To control surface defects and enhance surface charge transfer in the photoanodes, Al3+ was introduced to the hematite nanocoral arrays. Previous reports suggest that attaching Al3+ to the surface of hematite will passivate the surface trapping states by decreasing the recombination of charge carriers at the surface and increasing the charge-transfer rate.11 For this reason aluminium ex situ doping was carried out for the optimized Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanode. Aluminium hydroxide was attached to the surface of the photoanode via MASA and aluminium ion was doped into the crystal lattice of Fe2O3 using high-temperature quenching. After the MASA treatment, morphological changes in the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes were inspected using HR-FESEM. Fig. 4a and b show the top and cross-sectional images of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanode, revealing fluffy Al(OH)3 homogeneously deposited on the surface. After quenching, the fluffy deposits remain as brighter spots on the surface of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. The effect of aluminium co-doping on the crystallographic orientation was also investigated by SR-XRD, with the resulting profiles depicted in Fig. S5.† The intensity ratio of the (104) peaks to the (104) and (110) peaks was nearly independent of aluminium doping because the titanium-doped Ti/Al co-doped hematite samples achieved almost identical (104) preferred orientations (Fig. S5b†). This indicates that aluminium co-doping maintains the hematite crystal structure and the (104) preferred orientation and causes no crystallographic changes. The measured UV-vis absorbance spectra and estimate of the optical bandgap of the Al/Ti co-doped hematite photoanode are shown in Fig. S6.† The bandgap energy was unchanged compared with the hematite photoanodes.

The chemical state and elemental composition of the prepared Fe2O3 photoanodes were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The high-resolution spectra in Fig. 5a–e and S7† represent the Fe 2p, O 1s, Ti 2p, and Al 2p core element orbitals analyzed for EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, Al(5 mM):Fe2O3, and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and for Al(5 mM):FeOOH and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanodes. The Fe 2p core-level spectra for the aluminium-deposited samples exhibit the same binding energies as those shown in Fig. 5a with a slight decrease in satellite intensity. Deconvolution of O 1s and Al 2p peaks from the prepared photoanodes before and after thermal quenching is shown in Fig. 5b and d, and c and e, respectively. The four distinct peaks of oxygen species observed upon deconvolution of O 1s were obtained from the photoanodes before thermal quenching. Those peaks, at binding energies of 529.6, 531, 532.3, and 533 eV, can be attributed to oxygen atoms in the metal oxide lattice (M–O), lattice hydroxyl groups (M–OH), aluminium hydroxide state (Al–OH), and water present in the oxide surfaces as a result of the adsorption and dissolution of water (H2O)ads, respectively.31–33 The strong peak near 532.3 eV confirms the formation of Al–OH on the surface during MASA treatment (Fig. 5b). The surface-adsorbed water content appeared only in aluminium-deposited samples. The associated Al 2p spectra obtained before the photoanodes were thermally quenched are shown in Fig. 5c. The Al 2p peaks near 74.4 eV agree with the reported Al–OH binding energy.34 However, after high-temperature quenching, the surface-adsorbed hydroxyls were removed, and a high-contrast, recrystallized α-Fe2O3 phase appears in the XPS spectra. The O 1s and Al 2p XPS spectra for thermally quenched photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. The O 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 5d can be deconvoluted into three oxygen species, a metal-oxide lattice (M–O), an adsorbed metal hydroxide (M–OH), and an aluminium oxide state (Al–O) at 529.8, 530.6, and 531.8 eV, respectively; confirming that amorphous Al2O3 formed on the surface of MASA-treated photoanodes after thermal quenching.35 The binding energies of the Al 2p core-level spectra from aluminium-doped photoanodes are located near 73.7 eV, closely matching the reported binding energy value of Al–O (Fig. 5e).35 The shift of the Al 2p peak before thermal treatment (74.4 eV) toward lower binding energy after thermal treatment (73.7 eV) can be attributed primarily to the decrease in the concentration of OH− ions, confirming the Al3+ oxidation state of Al2O3.36 As Fig. S7a† shows, the Ti 2p spectra obtained for the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes consist of doublet peaks for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at binding energies of 458 and 463 eV, respectively. The existence of Ti 2p doublet peaks corresponds to the +4 oxidation state of titanium.30 The elemental compositions of the as-prepared samples obtained by XPS are summarized in Table 1. In general, XPS analysis provides the elemental composition measured from depths of a few angstroms to the surface of a sample. The higher oxygen content was observed for (3′) and (4′) photoanodes. It comes from the oxygen source of iron hydroxide (β-FeOOH) and Al(OH)3 attachment. Compared to the Al(OH)3 attached iron hydroxide photoanodes (3′) and (4′), the elemental ratio of Al:O and Fe:O is 1:3 and 1:2, respectively. Therefore, the content of the oxygen element is higher than that of the Al and Fe elements in the sample. During the high-temperature quenching process, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 in the as-prepared samples (3) and (4) are formed and the elemental ratio of Al:O and Fe:O becomes 1:5 and 1:5, respectively. Although the elemental ratio of Al:O and Fe:O decreases and the content of oxygen element also decreases slightly in the composition of the as-prepared photoanodes, the oxygen can come from both Al2O3 and Fe2O3 in the samples. Therefore, the content of oxygen element is still higher than that of Al and Fe elements in samples (3) and (4) as shown in Table 1. Interestingly, the ratio of Fe:O is not desirable at 2:3 for quenched photoanodes (1) and (2) attributed to the extrinsic doping (or diffusion) of the element into the hematite during heat treatment.12,30

To determine the qualitative relationship between MASA treatment time and the actual amount of aluminium attached on EtOH:FeOOH, we conducted an additional experiment with a reaction time of 30 s and MASA of Al(5 mM):FeOOH-30 s, and compared the results with those for Al(5 mM):FeOOH-120 s. The detected aluminium content (in atomic percentage) in the samples treated for 30 s and 120 s was 5.49% and 23.16%, respectively, indicating that the longer the microwave reaction time, the greater the amount of aluminium attached to the surface of the photoanode (as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S7b†). To elucidate the effects of the MASA treatment, we prepared an additional photoanode with aluminium attachment by physical adsorption rather than by the MASA (denoted as Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH-W/O MASA) and compared the results with Fig. 5c and S7c.† The XPS Al 2p spectrum of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH-W/O MASA sample included a weak peak near 74.3 eV, implying that MASA involved a strong preference for aluminium ions over the iron oxide substrate.
The FT-IR spectra of the Ti(4%):FeOOH and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):FeOOH photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5f. These samples show similar spectral features with slight modification in intensities, which may be attributable to the MASA treatment. The broad region ranging from 3200 to 3600 cm−1, a broad bending at 2074 cm−1, and a sharp peak at 1627 cm−1 belong to O–H stretching vibration from adsorbed and combined water in the structure.37–39 The peaks at 1052, 877 and 794 cm−1 correspond to Fe–O–H bending vibrations.40 The slight increment in peak intensity at 1052 cm−1 is due to the presence of Al–O bonding.41 The band at 607 cm−1 is associated with C–H and Al–O stretching vibrations.42,43 In addition, the wavenumber of the combination band of water exhibits a peak shift from 2074 to 2006 cm−1. This indicates that the presence of the ionic solute Al(OH)3 leads to a new set of interactions with water molecules that on average weakens H-bonding.44
Changes in the local structure of the hematite due to doping with titanium and aluminium atoms were examined by synchrotron-based XANES and EXAFS spectroscopy. Fig. 6a depicts similar results for the iron K-edge XANES spectra in all samples, which, with the exception of the Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 sample have slightly decreased intensities at the absorption peak position (shown in the inset). In the EXAFS spectra shown in Fig. 6b, the single-element doped Fe2O3 sample has almost no change in peak intensities at 0.6–3.8 Å compared with EtOH:Fe2O3. However, Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 exhibits reduced intensity in the second shell (2.0–3.8 Å), the peak of which is indicated by an asterisk. This peak is related primarily to four Fe–M (M refers to titanium and aluminium) scatterings, with bond distances of approximately 2.90–2.97 Å, although Fe–Fe and Fe–O scatterings with longer bond distances partly overlap this peak. The bond orderings of Fe–M for Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 are decreased, indicating that the outermost electrons in Fe3+ are delocalized compared with single-element-doped Fe2O3 and EtOH:Fe2O3.

Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent density vs. potential curves for the EtOH:Fe2O3, Ti(4%):Fe2O3, Al(5 mM):Fe2O3, and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. According to previous reports, aluminium doping produced a significantly enhanced photocurrent relative to the hematite photoanode and shifted the onset potential in the cathodic direction.9,11 Here, Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 also showed a large cathodic shift in onset potential, but the photocurrent density was poor and saturated early at low applied potentials, which indicated inappropriate behavior toward water oxidation reactions. An Al2O3 coating layer can act as trapped sites for photogenerated holes, and therefore promote charge separation, lower onset potential, and accelerate oxygen-evolution rate kinetics. A thick Al2O3 layer on the surface of the photoanode hindered the photocurrent because of a lack of diffusion of Al3+ into the hematite lattice.45 However, the photocurrent onset potential of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode shifted in the anodic direction while its photocurrent density improved for all scanning potentials compared to the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode.

We conducted additional experiments to determine the photocurrent behavior of the Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes at varying MASA reaction times. Fig. S8† shows the photocurrent density vs. potential curves for the Al(5 mM)-doped and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%) co-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared over different MASA treatment times (30, 60, and 120 s). The photocurrent density of the prepared Fe2O3 photoanodes decreased from 1.194 to 0.721 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. S8a†). In contrast to the EtOH:Fe2O3 sample, the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%) co-doped Fe2O3 photoanode showed enhanced photocurrent density with increasing microwave reaction time (Fig. S8b†). The photocurrent densities at different reaction-time intervals for the deposited substrates (EtOH and/or Ti[4%]) are depicted in Fig. S8c.† The photocurrent density for an aluminium-doped photoanode is far lower compared with a photoanode co-doped with titanium and aluminium when prepared over a longer MASA reaction time. These results indicate that the successfully attached aluminium ions diffused into the crystal lattice of Fe2O3 while the residual aluminium hydroxides were converted into the Al2O3 surface by thermal quenching. This Al2O3 passivated the surface trapping states, which induced a cathodic shift in the photocurrent onset potential of Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes, as shown in Fig. 7a. This is because an Al2O3 coating layer can act as a trapping site for photogenerated holes, promoting charge separation, lowering the onset potential, and accelerating the water-splitting kinetics. Fig. 7b depicts the EIS curves of four photoanodes recorded at 1.1 V vs. RHE. The fitted values are listed in Table 2. A larger, semicircular curve was evident for Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 compared with the other photoanodes, and relatively higher R1 and R2 values were found to be surface derived from an excessive Al2O3 layer. The R2 value decreased remarkably from 180.1 Ω for the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 to 81.39 Ω for the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode, indicating the significance of a passivation layer that reduces surface defects and suppresses surface charge-recombination and passivates the surface defects near the surface electrolyte interface. Fig. 7c provides the donor concentrations of the prepared photoanodes calculated by MS plots. The Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode shows a higher donor density (6.36 × 1020 cm−3) compared to the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. This provides clear evidence that a suitable amount of Al3+ diffused into the crystal lattice of Fe2O3, effectively increasing donor concentration and ultimately resulting in a photocurrent enhancement. However, the donor density for Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 decreased slightly from 1.67 × 1020 cm−3 to 1.27 × 1020 cm−3 compared with bare EtOH:Fe2O3. This indicates that Al3+ ions find it more difficult to diffuse into the crystal lattice of EtOH:Fe2O3 compared with that of Ti(4%):Fe2O3. Moreover, all samples are observed to have photocurrent onset potentials more positive than the flat band potential. This is undoubtedly due to the slow water oxidation kinetics that lead to hole accumulation at the surface, and consequently surface recombination occurs until an adequate positive potential is reached for substantial charge transfer across the interface. Thus, the onset potential is 0.1–0.2 V higher than the flat band potential and a slight overpotential is always required.46Fig. 7d shows the long-term stability of the prepared photoanodes. All samples show excellent photostability at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The LSV curve measured to calculate the charge separation and charge injection efficiencies in mixed electrolytes (H2O2 + NaOH) is shown in Fig. S9.†Fig. 7e shows the charge separation efficiency (ηbulk) of the as-prepared samples. The ηbulk of EtOH:Fe2O3 was 7.1% at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while bulk efficiency (ηbulk) increased to 7.9% for Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and to 9.5% for the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode. This shows that Ti/Al co-doping effectively suppresses bulk electron–hole recombination and strongly affects bulk charge-transfer efficiency. The charge injection efficiency (ηsurface) of Ti(4%):Fe2O3 was 30.5% at 1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7f), which is much lower than that of the Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 (73.2%) photoanode. The highest ηsurface for the Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 photoanode is associated with a low overpotential because the surface Al2O3 passivates surface trapping states and decreases surface defects. However, the ηsurface of Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 (52.7%) was higher than that of the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode. This shows that Al/Ti co-doping and Al2O3 surface modification play roles in the charge-transfer process of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode. To understand the effect of the MASA treatment, we compared the LSV curves of the prepared samples. Fig. S10† shows the LSV curves for the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared with and without MASA treatment. The Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3-W/O MASA photoanode showed no improvement in photocurrent.

To investigate the distribution of aluminium in the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode, TEM analysis was performed. Fig. S11† shows the low-magnification TEM images of Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared with and without 5 mM aluminium co-doping, with nanocoral structures evident. Fig. 8a and b show low-magnification TEM images of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode. The HR-TEM images in Fig. 8c show lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 2.70 Å (in yellow), which is consistent with the d-spacing of (104) Fe2O3.20 Additionally, the fast-Fourier transformation patterns suggest that Fe2O3 has a semi-crystalline form in the Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. Moreover, the ADF-STEM image reveals that a thin amorphous Al2O3 layer formed on the surface to cover the hematite nanocoral. EDS elemental mapping images (Fig. 8d) reveal that aluminium is homogeneously distributed throughout the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 sample. Moreover, Fig. 8i displays the EDS spectra of the corresponding elements. Moreover, the average transport time of the photogenerated electron (τet) can be computed from the angular frequency of the minimum given by the following equation:47 (8)where, fmin is the frequency for the minimum imaginary component in intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). The IMPS measurement was probed under illumination with light of 520 nm wavelength at 1.23 V vs. RHE and the results are depicted in Fig. 9a. The fmin and corresponding τet for the prepared samples are listed in Table S4.† Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 had the highest τet of approximately 645 μs, while the lowest τet was observed in the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode at approximately 218 μs. This verifies that the synergistic effect of Al/Ti co-doping leads to decreases in charge transport resistance while enhancing photocurrent density.

The inset shows the steady-state PL spectra of the corresponding photoanode materials. The excitation source for the steady-state PL spectra and time-resolved PL decays was a 379 nm pulsed laser. 
We conducted a time-resolved PL study to provide quantitative information on the photo-excited carrier dynamics, as displayed in Fig. 9b. The Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode showed multiple component lifetimes, indicating various recombination pathways inside the material after photo-excitation. The averaged PL lifetime decreased in the order Ti(4%):Fe2O3 (1.8 ns) > Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 (1.5 ns), whereas the PEC activity increased in the reverse order. The highest PEC activity was achieved in Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3; enhanced charge transfer, therefore, appears to play a key role with photo-excited carriers producing high-efficiency photoanodes.12,40,41 For the fitted lifetime parameters (Table 3), the shorter lifetime components (τ1 and τ2) can be attributed to non-radiative transition, including charge trapping or transfer in bulk states, whereas the longest lifetime component (τ3) may have originated in deeply trapped states such as certain surface or interfacial states.21,42,43 In the case of Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3, all three lifetime components had faster recombination rates compared with Ti(4%):Fe2O3. According to the fundamental theory, the PL recombination rate (kPL = τPL−1) is the sum of radiative (kr) and non-radiative recombination rates (knr).48 Therefore, the estimated shorter PL lifetime in Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 means that the photoexcited electron–hole recombination process involves greater contribution of a non-radiative recombination route, such as charge transfer, particularly in the τ3 related states. In this study, the charge-transfer process, as a non-radiative route, may proceed in both surface and interfacial states as well as in the bulk states of the photoanodes.

Fig. S12† provides LSV curves for the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 and Co-Pi/Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanodes. After Co-Pi deposition, the overall PEC performance improved, and the representative OER catalyst Co-Pi was used to demonstrate the gas evolution kinetics of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode. Stable PEC solar water-splitting in 1 M NaOH under AM 1.5G light (100 mW cm−2) is shown in Fig. S13a.† The gas evolution experiment was repeated twice and averaged values were used to draw the faradaic efficiency shown in Table S5.† For the Co-Pi/Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode, O2 was produced linearly as a stoichiometric amount of H2 evolved at the counter-electrode with respect to reaction time under illumination. After 5 h, the evolved amount of O2 and H2 gases reached 74 and 130 μmol, respectively. The calculated faradaic efficiency of the Co-Pi/Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode, i.e., the faradaic efficiency between the measured and theoretical H2 and O2 generation rates, was 85%, signifying that almost-photogenerated charge carriers were utilized for water-splitting (Fig. S13b†). However, the observed faradaic efficiency differed from the theoretical value by 15%, which could be the result of side reaction(s) in solution (a redox reaction of dissolved oxygen species) or a redox reaction of the electrode material or surface species.49 Another probable reason for the low faradaic efficiency is, in part, gas leakage during sampling and manual sampling into the gas chromatograph.50
Based on these results, a possible electron charge-transfer mechanism can be proposed to explain the role of each dopant and elucidate the synergistic effects of Al/Ti co-doping (Scheme 2(1)–(4)). The main recombination pathways of bulk recombination (I) and surface recombination (II) for photogenerated electron–hole pairs are depicted in the schematic. In general, electron–hole pairs are generated in semiconductors under illumination; these photogenerated electrons move toward the bottom of the conductive side of the FTO substrate through the internal bulk semiconducting metal oxide. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes move toward the surface of the bulk metal oxide. In the Al(5 mM):Fe2O3 photoanode shown in Scheme 2(3), the self-formed Al2O3 passivation layer (which formed due to the limits of aluminium doping into the bare hematite lattice) lowered the surface defects and cathodically shifted the onset potential, indicating passivation of surface trapping states. However, excess Al2O3 led to the formation of a resistance layer that decreased surface conductivity and increased its bulk resistance. The net photocurrent, therefore, returned to a low level and became saturated early at low potentials. However, Ti4+ doping effectively increased donor density as the doping generated surface defects and anodically shifted the onset potential of the photoanode. For the Al/Ti co-doped Fe2O3 photoanode depicted in Scheme 2(4), bulk and surface charge recombination were strongly inhibited (R1, R2) due to the successful diffusion of Al3+ into the hematite lattice, which contributed to an increase in charge-carrier density and formed the partial Al2O3 layer that contributed to the passivation of surface trapping states.51,52 Shortening of the nanostructures was also responsible for improving the rapidly photogenerated charge (electron) transport (τet) in Fe2O3-based photoanodes due to the shorter diffusion length for photogenerated holes. Due to a lack of bulk doping and surface passivation layer, bare EtOH:Fe2O3 was associated with poor PEC performance, as shown in Scheme 2(1). MASA treatment gave greater coverage to aluminium ions, which synergistically enhanced the PEC performance of the Al(5 mM)/Ti(4%):Fe2O3 photoanode through doping and passivation, as depicted in Scheme 2(4). This suggests a facile and effective strategy of co-doping and surface modification to improve PEC performance via ISD hydrothermal synthesis and MASA treatment of photoanodes.

The main electron–hole recombination pathways were represented as (I) and (II): (I) bulk recombination, (II) surface recombination. 
4. Conclusions
We successfully fabricated an Al/Ti co-doped photoanode via ISD hydrothermal synthesis and MASA treatment. In situ dilution Ti4+ doping resulted in improved performance compared with ex situ and without-dilution Ti4+ doped photoanodes. We found that Ti4+ doping enhanced charge-carrier density, while leading to lower bulk resistance and increased bulk charge separation efficiency. However, this also produced defects on the surface of the photoanode, promoting surface recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and inducing an anodic onset shift. Aluminium co-doping by MASA treatment reduced surface defects and bulk charge transfer resistance due to the successful diffusion of Al3+ ions into the crystal lattice of Fe2O3, while passivation by partially available Al2O3 suppressed the surface charge-recombination at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. This accelerated the charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, thereby improving the water oxidation kinetics. Mott–Schottky plots and EIS measurements indicate that the enhanced photocurrent (1.32 mA cm−2) and cathodic onset shift (120 mV) are due primarily to an increase in donor density and a decrease in surface charge resistance. In addition, due to the rapid selective heating enabled by the use of microwaves, MASA allowed us to effectively attach aluminium to the photoanode surface. The amount of aluminium attached can be controlled by varying the MASA treatment time. Results from XPS clearly show the relationship between MASA treatment time and the amount of attached aluminium. This indicates that ISD hydrothermal synthesis and MASA treatment can improve the PEC water-splitting performance and open up a range of possibilities when it comes to the synthesis of new materials.
