    , Accepted 27th December 2020First published on 28th December 2020Abstractvan der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively recognized as promising candidates for fabricating multi-functional novel devices. In this work, we investigated the structural and electronic properties of the InS–arsenene vdWH in some detail by using the first principles calculation method to explore its potential application in nanoelectronics. Numerical results show that the InS–arsenene vdWH possesses a stable structure, excellent flexibility, high carrier mobility and direct band gap semiconducting behavior. In particular, its electronic properties can be regulated effectively by vertical strain, in-plane strain and an external electric field. Vertical strain can tune the band gap of the semiconducting vdWH in a wide range with stable type-II band alignment. However, in-plane strain and an external electric field can even realize phase transitions from semiconducting to metallic behaviors, which implies great application potential of the InS–arsenene vdWH in multi-purpose nanoelectronic devices, optoelectronic devices and tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs). This theoretical work would provide valuable guidance for fabricating the InS–arsenene vdWH and extending the application of InS and arsenene monolayers.
1 Introduction
Inspired by the great success of graphene,1 exploring novel 2D materials with peculiar physical and chemical properties has become a promising research field in recent years.2–7 A feasible and efficient method to realize new 2D materials is the combination of heterojunctions by stacking several existing layered materials together.8–12 A suitable heterojunction may preserve superior performances of the constructing layers, and even reveal some novel properties and a new quantum phenomenon lacking in each component. For example, in a graphene–hexagonal boron nitride van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH), nontrivial gaps can be opened by inversion symmetry breaking and second-generation Dirac cones.11 In addition, in view of different band alignments of the components, i.e., straddling type-I, staggered type-II and broken-gap type-III, the binary semiconducting vdWHs reveal abundant physical and material properties, and have presented extensive application prospects in the aspects of nanoscale luminescence, photocatalysis, light detection and field-effect transistors (FETs).13–19 For example, the black phosphorus–MoS2 vdWH presents high external quantum efficiency, sensitive photo-response and a strong rectification effect, showing promising application potential in nanoscale photo-electronic detection.20 A graphene–MoS2 vdWH based FET shows a high on/off ratio and fast transit time of current at room temperature, implying possible utilization of nanoscale RF electronics or photoelectronics.21
Arsenene, as a younger brother of phosphorene, has been experimentally manufactured and has attracted more attention recently due to its typical electric properties and good stability.5,22–24 Previous research indicated that there are three feasible configurations of monolayer arsenene, i.e. puckered, planar and buckled ones.5 The planar arsenene shows metallic behavior, while the puckered and buckled ones present indirect band-gap semiconducting behavior. For each configuration, the electronic properties can be tuned effectively by applying strain and an external electric field. Different arsenene-based vdWHs were also researched theoretically and experimentally to explore the material properties and potential applications in nanoscale electronics.25–30 For example, an arsenene–C3N vdWH shows semiconducting behavior with type-II band alignment, whose band structure and photo absorption can be effectively tuned by strain and an external electric field. The arsenene–FeCl2 vdWH shows obvious spin splitting properties, and the spin splitting direction and energy can be adjusted by an external electric field. According to the anomalous Hall effect, the electric control of spin splitting inversion can be converted into an electric potential difference. By using arsenene and arsenene/graphene vdWHs as alternative anodes to replace Mg metal, the specific capacity and diffusion probability of the Mg2+ ion can be effectively increased, which indicates that arsenene and arsenene-based vdWHs might be promising anode materials in emerging magnesium-ion batteries.31
Group III–VI compound MX (M = Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) is another important and widely studied class of layered semiconducting materials.32–41 For example, the InX monolayers exhibit a suitable band gap, high carrier mobility and large power conversion efficiency, which can be further improved by external strain and indicate potential utilization in solar energy conversion and FETs.42 Recently, an InS nanosheet was successfully synthesized, which shows great potential application in the field of ultrafast lasers and nonlinear optics due to its excellent saturable absorption characteristics.43 Besides, great efforts have also been focused on MX-based lateral and vertical heterostructures to improve and expand their potential applications.36,37 Compared to monolayer materials, the multilayer MX-based lateral heterostructures show largely improved power conversion efficiencies,36i.e., 18.84% for a bilayer and 20.96% for trilayer InS/InSe, which are higher than that of the bilayer phosphorene/MoS2 lateral heterostructure (16–18%) and even comparable to those of the polycrystalline CdTe thin film (21.5%) and perovskite (22.1%) solar cells. For the vertical M1X1/M2X2 vdWHs, more unique properties than the individual MX materials can also be found. For example, the type-II InS/GaSe and GaS/GaSe vdWHs show significantly improved photocatalytic properties by producing hydrogen and oxygen at the opposite parts.37 The type-II GaSe/GaTe heterostructure is predicted to be a promising solar cell material due to its roughly 18% high power conversion efficiency and direct band gap compatible with silicon. The gapless semi-metallic InTe/GaS vdWH can be used as a promising Li-ion battery anode material based on three-step lithiated analysis.
Although some research studies have been carried out to explore the electronic properties and potential applications of arsenene and MX materials, the indirect band-gap characteristics greatly limit their application as luminescent or photoelectric materials. In this case, the design of arsenene and MX-based vdWHs with a stable structure and adjustable direct band-gap becomes interesting and meaningful. In this work, we designed an InS–arsenene vdWH by stacking the InS monolayer and arsenene vertically with appropriate lattice mismatch, and explored its structural and electronic behaviors in detail by using the first principles calculation method. Numerical results show that the InS–arsenene vdWH has a very stable configuration and perfect flexibility and ductility. In particular, the InS–arsenene vdWH shows a suitable direct band gap through forming a type-II band alignment of each component. By tuning vertical strain, in-plane strain and external electric field, the band gap of the vdWH can be adjusted effectively in a large energy range, and the semiconductor–metal phase transition can even occur. This work indicates that the application prospect of the InS–arsenene vdWH as a nanoscale optoelectronic device and TFET is greatly improved compared to the individual InS and arsenene monolayers.
2 Computational method
Both structural optimization and electronic property calculation were performed by using the plane-wave-based Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).44,45 The ion–electron interaction was implemented by the projector-augmented plane wave (PAW) pseudopotential, and the exchange–correlation interaction was handled by both the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional46 and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional.47 The energy cutoff was fixed equal to 450 eV, and the reciprocal k-points for the InS–arsenene vdWH (InS or arsenene monolayer) was set to 5 × 5 × 1 (15 × 15 × 1) in structural relaxation and electronic calculation, respectively. A weak vdW interaction between the InS and arsenene layers was described by the DFT-D2 functional with Grimme correction.48 Finally, the convergence criteria of force and energy were set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. In addition, the thermal stability of the 2 × 2 supercell of the vdWH at room temperature was examined by using the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations49 for 10 ps with a time step of 3 fs.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure and stability
Before exploring the physical properties of the hybrid InS–arsenene vdWH, the structural and electronic behaviors of the individual InS monolayer and arsenene were investigated firstly. Fig. 1(a–e) show the optimized crystal structures, Brillouin zone, band structures and projected density of states (PDOS) of the InS monolayer and arsenene. The InS monolayer consists of two nonequivalent InS layers, and there are two S atoms and two In atoms in a primitive cell. It shows a regular hexagon configuration from the top view and an irregular hexagon configuration from the side view. Previous research indicated that there are three feasible structures of arsenene, i.e. puckered, planar and buckled, where the buckled one as shown in Fig. 1(c) has the lowest cohesive energy.5 Thus, the buckled arsenene was selected in our work to construct the vdWH with InS. At the PBE level of the exchange–correlation functional, both the InS monolayer and arsenene are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps roughly equal to 1.66 eV and 1.60 eV. For the InS monolayer, the valence band maximum (VBM) is located between the Γ point and K point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point. The VBM is mainly contributed by the p orbitals of In and S atoms, while the CBM is dominated by the p orbital of S atoms and the s orbital of In atoms. For arsenene, the VBM is located at the Γ point, and the CBM is located between the Γ point and M point, but both of them are mainly derived from the p orbital of arsenene atoms. These numerical results are in good agreement with previous studies,26,37 and their comparison is listed in Table 1. More accurate calculation was also implemented by employing the HSE exchange–correlation functional. The band gaps are increased to 2.48 eV and 2.20 eV, respectively, for the InS monolayer and arsenene as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), while their indirect band gap behaviors are retained.

In order to overcome the lattice mismatch in constructing the InS–arsenene heterostructure, the  supercell of the InS monolayer and the 3 × 3 supercell of arsenene are employed and stacked vertically. The lattice mismatch is reduced to 3.75% (3.89%) between InS (arsenene) and the heterostructure, which meets the general requirement for experimental fabrication. The fully optimized structure of the InS–arsenene heterostructure is shown in Fig. 2(a), where the lattice constant is 10.46 Å and the average interlayer distance d0 is 3.2 Å. d0 is larger than the summation of the covalent radii of arsenene and S atoms, suggesting a vdW interaction between the InS monolayer and arsenene.

(c) The Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratios ν(θ) of the InS monolayer (blue curve), arsenene monolayer (orange curve) and InS–arsenene vdWH (purple curve) along arbitrary in-plane directions. 
For the constructed InS–arsenene vdWH, the structural stability must be verified at first under different external conditions. Firstly, the binding energy Eb = (EInS–As − EInS − EAs)/S was calculated to examine the energetic stability, where EInS–As, EInS and EAs denote the total energy of the InS–arsenene vdWH, individual InS monolayer and arsenene, respectively. Four possible stacking patterns for the InS–arsenene vdWH are considered, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†); the I stacking pattern has the lowest binding energy indicating the most stable configuration. Thus, we only focus on the I stacking pattern in the rest of this paper. The calculated Eb of the I stacking pattern is equal to −113 meV Å−2 including the vdW correction. This value is lower than those of many previously reported vdWHs, such as InSe–g-C3N4 (−93 meV Å−2)38 and C2N–WS2 (−92.9 meV Å−2)50 vdWHs, indicating that the InS–arsenene vdWH is energetically stable. Secondly, the thermal stability of the vdWH was confirmed by calculating the total energy evaluation at a temperature of 500 K for 10 ps through performing an AIMD simulation. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the total energy oscillates with small fluctuations around a fixed value, and the snapshot of the dynamic configuration of the vdWH does not have broken bonds or geometry reconstruction, which reveals excellent thermal stability of the InS–arsenene vdWH even at high temperature.
Finally, the elastic constants Ci,j were also calculated to verify the mechanical stability. As shown in Table 2, the Born criteria C11C22 − C122 > 0 and C66 > 0 are satisfied for both the isolated monolayers and the vdWH, which suggests the mechanical stability of all the structures.51 Based on Ci,j, the Young's modulus Y(θ), Poisson's ratios ν(θ) along the in-plane angle θ and layer modulus γ were also calculated according to the following formulae,52 which indicate the flexibility, rigidity and resilience of the materials, (1) (2) (3)where A = (C11C22 − C122)/C66 − 2C12 and B = C11 + C22 − (C11C22 − C122)/C66. As shown in Fig. 2(c), Y(θ) and ν(θ) are almost mechanically isotropic for the InS monolayer and InS–arsenene vdWH, while they exhibit weak anisotropy for arsenene. The Young's modulus and layer modulus are smaller than those of monolayer graphene (340 N m−1 and 215.9 N m−1),53 BN (318 N m−1 and 177.0 N m−1)54 and SiC (179.7 N m−1 and 116.5 N m−1),55 while comparable to those of monolayer MoS2 (129 N m−1).56 It's also worth mentioning that Y(θ) and γ of the InS–arsenene vdWH are roughly the summation of the isolated InS monolayer and arsenene, which is in good accordance with the mechanical properties of multilayer graphene55 and PC3.57 As for Poisson's ratio ν(θ), it is quite similar to those of other 2D materials (0–0.5).58 These properties mean that the InS–arsenene vdWHs are more flexible and stretchable than most of the other common 2D materials, indicating potential application in flexible electronic devices.

3.2 Electronic properties of the InS–arsenene vdWH
In the following, we present the electronic properties of the InS–arsenene vdWH from various aspects. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the InS–arsenene vdWH displays direct band gap semiconducting properties with a band gap roughly equal to 0.36 eV (PBE) at the Γ point. The VBM is mainly contributed by the lower InS layer, while the CBM is derived from the upper arsenene layer. It is this typical staggered type-II band alignment that converts the indirect band gap of individual monolayers to the direct band gap of the vdWH. More accurate calculation based on the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional also confirms the type-II band alignment and the direct band gap of the vdWH as shown in Fig. S1(c) (ESI†), although the band gap is increased compared to that from PBE calculation. Considering that the results based on PBE and HSE06 functional are qualitatively consistent, and the HSE functional requires huge computational costs, we adopt the PBE functional in most of the following calculation in this work due to the qualitatively consistent from the PBE and HSE06 functional and huge computational costs of the latter. Furthermore, the band decomposed real space distributions of charge density of the VBM and CBM were also calculated to confirm the type-II band alignment. As illustrated in Fig. 3(b), it is clear that the electrons and holes are localized in the InS monolayer and arsenene, respectively. The type-II band alignment greatly facilitates the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, providing promising application of the InS–arsenene vdWH in optoelectronic devices.

The blue and red triangles represent the contributions from the lower InS layer and the upper arsenene layer. (b) The band decomposed charge densities of the VBM and CBM of the InS–arsenene vdWH with an isovalue of 0.0008 e Å−4. (c) The band alignment between the monolayer InS and arsenene before and after the formation of the InS–arsenene vdWH. (d) The averaged electrostatic potential and averaged electron density difference of the vdWH along the z-direction. 
Furthermore, to gain a more intuitive feeling of the inherent mechanism of the band alignment, we also present the band edge positions of each constituent and their vdWH relative to the vacuum level in Fig. 3(c). For the individual InS monolayer and arsenene, the Fermi level of the former is much lower than that of the latter. Correspondingly, both the VBM and CBM of the former are lower than those of the latter leading to a possibility of forming type-II band alignment, which is embodied in the difference in work functions. The calculated work functions of the InS monolayer and arsenene are 5.68 eV and 4.57 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with previous reports.26,37 The valence band offset (VBO) is defined as |EVBM-InS − EVBM-As| and the conduction band offset (CBO) is equal to |ECBM-InS − ECBM-As|, the calculated VBO and CBO are 1.01 eV and 0.96 eV before forming the vdWH, respectively. After the stacking of the heterostructure, the Fermi level is pushed up for the InS layer and pulled down for the arsenene layer to the same value. Due to the vdW interlayer coupling, the 4.85 eV work function of the vdWH is as expected slightly higher than that of the arsenene layer and lower than that of the InS layer. Meanwhile, the VBO and CBO reduce to 0.80 eV and 0.72 eV, respectively, but the type-II band alignment remains. Thus, the electrons can spontaneously transfer from the arsenene layer to the InS layer, and the holes transfer in the opposite direction. As a result, the accumulation of positive and negative charges induces a built-in electric field pointing from the upper arsenene layer to the lower InS layer, which in turn hinders the transfer of charges and finally reaches an electrostatic balance inside the vdWH. The large band offset can prolong the lifetime of an interlayer exciton, which further improves the carrier separation efficiency.59
To further understand the type-II band alignment and built-in electric field, we calculated the electrostatic potential and plane-averaged differential charge density of the InS–arsenene vdWH along the z-direction as shown in Fig. 3(d). The different electronegativity of S (2.58) and arsenene (2.18) atoms leads to a little deeper potential of the InS layer than that of the arsenene layer in the vdWH. Meanwhile, it induces a 1.39 eV potential drop ΔV, which implies a weak built-in electric field across the interface from the arsenene layer to the InS layer as also reflected in the band alignment in Fig. 3(c). The presence of a built-in electric field would reduce the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. To see more clearly the charge transfer inside the vdWH, the plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) and the 3D isosurface of the charge density difference are also presented in Fig. 3(d). Δρ(z) is calculated by  with ρInS–As(r), ρInS(r), and ρAs(r) denoting the real space charge density of the vdWH, isolated InS and isolated arsenene monolayers, respectively. Obviously, charge redistribution occurs at the interface of the heterojunction due to the interlayer interaction. Concretely, the charge depletes in the arsenene layer while accumulates in the InS layer. Moreover, the Bader charge analysis suggests that 0.117 electron is transferred from the arsenene layer to the InS layer in the vdWH, further validating the charge transfer mechanism mentioned above.
3.3 Carrier mobility of the InS–arsenene vdWH
As a critical factor affecting the performance of materials in electronic devices, the carrier mobility of the isolated InS monolayer, arsenene monolayer and InS–arsenene vdWH was systematically calculated based on the deformation potential theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley,60 which is widely used to predict the carrier mobilities of 2D materials. In general, it is expressed as:61,62 (4)where kB, T, e and ħ represent the Boltzmann constant, room temperature (300 K), electron charge and reduced Planck constant, respectively. The effective mass m* of different type carriers in different transport directions is determined by m* = ±ℏ2(d2Ek/dk2), and the averaged effective mass md is defined as . The elastic modulus C of the longitudinal strain is derived from C = (∂2E/∂2ε)/S0, with E and S0 denoting the total energy and area of the equilibrium system. The deformation potential constant EDP = dEedge/dε is given by the ratio of change of band edges with strain. Herein, the strain is set as ε = (l − l0)/l0, where l and l0 are the lattice constants of strained and unstrained structures. As summarized in Table 2, the elastic modulus C of the InS–arsenene vdWH is direction independent for both electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the effective mass of electrons exhibits obvious isotropy, while the effective mass of holes is highly anisotropic. Thus, for both electrons and holes, the deformation potentials EDP strongly depend on the directions of charge transfer. The calculated carrier mobilities reach the same order of magnitude (2 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1) except for the holes in the x direction (865.85 cm2 V−1 s−1). It deserves to be mentioned that the carrier mobilities of the InS–arsenene vdWH are obviously superior to those of the InS monolayer and arsenene monolayer, which is mainly attributed to the much higher elastic modulus and smaller effective mass, as clearly listed in Table 3. Moreover, they are comparable and even higher than those of monolayer black phosphorus (1100 cm2 V−1 s−1),62 MoSSe (530 cm2 V−1 s−1),63 InSe–WS2 (223 cm2 V−1 s−1),64 and InSe–GaTe (963.83 cm2 V−1 s−1).65 The high and anisotropic carrier mobilities of electrons and holes substantially improve the performance of InS–arsenene vdWHs as promising electronic and photoelectric devices.

External strain and electric field are common and effective means to regulate the electronic properties of the heterojunction. In the following, we discuss the modulation to the electronic properties by external out-plane vertical strain, in-plane biaxial strain and external electric field in turn.
3.4 Tunable band gap under vertical strain
The vdW interaction plays an important role in regulating the electronic properties, which is mainly determined by the interlayer distance of the heterojunction. Experimentally, the interlayer distance can be modified by applying a vertical strain,26,66,67 which can be achieved by imposing pressure with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip, vacuum thermal annealing, and ion irradiation.68–70 Normally, the vertical strain is defined as the interlayer distance difference Δd between a strained vdWH and the equilibrium one (Δd = d − d0). In this work, Δd is adjusted from −0.8 Å to 1.8 Å, and the corresponding band gap Eg and the binding energy Eb are presented in Fig. 4(a). Obviously, when Δd = 0, Eb is the lowest indicating the most stable configuration of the vdWH, while negative Eb regardless of Δd demonstrates that the heterostructure is still energetically stable under vertical strain. For all Δd from −0.8 Å to 1.8 Å, the vdWH always presents semiconducting behavior with a finite gap. Moreover, the band gap Eg decreases versus interlayer distance, and the decreasing ratio is more sensitive to the compressive strain (Δd < 0) than the tensile strain (Δd > 0).
 Fig. 4  (a) The variation of band gap and binding energy versus interlayer distance difference Δd of the vdWH at the PBE level; (b) the band edge positions and Bader charge transfer at interlayer distance difference Δd; and (c) the projected band structures of the vdWH with interlayer distance difference Δd equal to −0.8 Å, −0.4 Å, 0.4 Å and 1.8 Å. 
The variation of band gap is mainly attributed to different interlayer interactions under vertical strain, reflecting as the band edge positions change and charge transfer. Fig. 4(b) shows the layer-projected band edge positions of the vdWH as functions of vertical strain. With the increase of interlayer distance, both the VBM and CBM from the arsenene layer change little, while those from the InS layer shift down markedly at first (compressive strain) and then slowly (tensile strain). Note that from compressive strain to tensile strain, the CBM of the InS layer is always higher than the VBM of the arsenene layer, although their difference decreases which results in a slowly decreasing band gap. In other words, the InS–arsenene vdWH retains the original type-II band alignment with robust direct band gap behavior. Beyond this, the Bader charge ΔQ is also calculated to quantitatively evaluate the charge transfer from the upper arsenene layer to the lower InS layer. As the vertical strain changes from −0.8 Å to 1.8 Å, the charge transfer from the arsenene layer to the InS layer reduces significantly at first and then marginally. It is reasonable because the interlayer interaction dies down versus vertical strain, which further annihilates the built-in electric field. Similar results based on the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional are also obtained as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). To see more clearly the band alignment, the projected band structures of the vdWH at four typical interlayer distances of −0.8 Å, −0.4 Å, 0.4 Å and 1.8 Å are presented in Fig. 4(c). Obviously, for all Δd, both the VBM and CBM are located at the Γ point showing direct band gap behaviors, and the vdWH always presents type-II semiconducting behavior although the band gap is decreasing.
In short, under vertical strain, the InS–arsenene vdWH can not only preserve its primal type-II direct band-gap semiconductor character, but also possesses a wider tunable band gap from 0.18 eV to 0.76 eV (0.80 eV to 1.24 eV in HSE06 calculation). This result further confirms that the vertical strain can serve as an effective way to modify the band gap of the vdWH, and provides more potential for the application of the InS–arsenene vdWH in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.
3.5 Tunable band alignments under in-plane biaxial strain
The in-plane biaxial strain has been proved to be an effective way to tune the electronic properties of 2D materials and vdWHs,69,71,72 which can be introduced by flexible substrates and external forces.73 In this subsection, we discuss the influence of in-plane biaxial strain on the electronic properties of the vdWH. The in-plane biaxial strain is defined as ε = (a − a0)/a0 = (b − b0)/b0, where a(b) and a0(b0) are the lattice constants of strained and equilibrium structures, respectively. The evolution of binding energy Eb and band gap Eg of the vdWH under moderate biaxial strain from −8% to 8% is shown in Fig. 5(a). Eb is always negative under all strains and varies like a parabola, guaranteeing the energetic stability and flexibility within the elastic limit. When compressive strain (ε < 0) is applied, Eg decreases obviously and finally reduces to zero at ε = −6% indicating a transition of the vdWH from semiconductor to metal. A similar phase transition can be observed at ε = −8% for the HSE06 calculation as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). However, under tensile strain (ε > 0), the semiconducting behavior is always maintained although it turns to the indirect band gap when ε ≥ 3%. The largest band gap of 0.55 eV appears when ε ≈ 4%.
 Fig. 5  (a) The variation of band gap and binding energy under different in-plane biaxial strains at the PBE level; (b) band edge positions as a function of in-plane biaxial strain; and (c) the projected band structure of the InS–arsenene vdWH at ε = −6%, −2%, 2% and 4%. 
The different transition behaviors of the InS–arsenene vdWH under compressive strain and tensile strain could be ascribed to the corresponding changes of band edge positions and band alignments. As shown in Fig. 5(b), when applying a compressive strain from −2% to −4%, the VBM of arsenene shifts up and the CBM of the InS layer shifts down, which induces a significant decrease of the band gap of the vdWH. With further increases of compressive strain to ε ≤ −6%, the VBM of the arsenene layer located at the Γ point lies above the Fermi level, while the CBM of the InS layer changes from the Γ point to the K point and is located below the Fermi level (see Fig. 5(c)). In other words, the VBM of the arsenene layer is higher than the CMB of the InS layer showing typical characteristic of broken-gap type-III band alignment. In this case, the so-called band-to-band tunnel (BTBT) transport is allowed to take place, and the electrons prefer to tunnel directly from the VBM of the arsenene layer to the CBM of InS layer, which is eagerly expected for tunneling field effect transistors. When applying a tensile strain (ε > 0) to the vdWH, the VBM of the InS layer continuously shifts up, while the VBM of the arsenene layer is pushed down slightly. As a result, the VBM of the InS layer shifts above the VBM of the arsenene layer when ε ≥ 4%, and thus the type-II band alignment changes to straddling type-I band alignment. Meanwhile, the band gap increases firstly and then decreases under the tensile strain. More intuitively, to present the metal–direct semiconductor–indirect semiconductor phase transition and band alignments, we present the projected band structures of the vdWH under specific biaxial strain (ε = −6%, −2%, 2%, 4%) in Fig. 5(c) (PBE) and Fig. S3 (ESI†) (HSE06). When ε decreases from 2% to −6%, all the band edges are always located at the Γ point, and the direct band gap tends to zero gradually. However, when ε reaches 4%, the VBM of the arsenene layer changes from the Γ point to the M point, and the CBM of the arsenene layer is still located at the Γ point, giving rise to the transition from a direct band gap semiconductor to an indirect band gap semiconductor.
In brief, three different band alignments (type-I, type-II and type-III) can be obtained for the InS–arsenene vdWH by varying the biaxial strain implying great application prospect of the vdWH in many fields. In general, the vdWH with type-I band alignment possesses fast recombination of electrons and holes, which is appropriate for utilization in luminescent devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs).74 The vdWH with type-II band alignment shows great superiority in many optoelectronic devices due to the effective separation of electrons and holes. However, the vdWH with type-III band alignment is widely used in high electron tunneling efficiency TFETs benefiting from its unique BTBT transport mechanism.75,76 In addition, the intriguing phase transition between type-II and type-III (type-I) is extremely desirable for designing multi-valued logic devices.
3.6 Tunable band alignments under an external electric field
An external electric field is another widely used method in experiments in tuning the electronic properties of 2D materials and nanoscale devices in view of its operability and reversibility.77–79 Therefore, we also imposed an external electric field on the InS–arsenene vdWH to trigger its interesting electronic effects. A variable external electric field ranging from −0.8 V Å−1 to 0.8 V Å−1 is applied perpendicular to the stacking layers, and its positive direction is from the lower InS layer to the upper arsenene layer, which is opposite to the intrinsic built-in electric field in the InS–arsenene vdWH. Fig. 6(a) shows the variation of band gap Eg and charge transfer ΔQ as functions of external electric field Eext. Positive ΔQ represents the transfer of the electrons from the upper arsenene layer to the lower InS layer, while negative ΔQ represents the opposite charge transfer. When Eext reduces from zero to −0.8 V Å−1, Eg decreases monotonically, and the semiconducting vdWH converts to a metallic one ultimately. However, when Eext increases from zero to 0.8 V Å−1, Eg increases roughly linearly from 0.36 eV to 0.95 eV and then drops to zero rapidly. In other words, a semiconducting-metallic phase transition occurs at both positive and negative external electric fields for the InS–arsenene vdWH. Similar electric field controlled semiconducting–metallic phase transitions have been observed in other vdWHs in previous studies.29,30 Correspondingly, when Eext changes from −0.8 V Å−1 to 0.8 V Å−1, ΔQ decreases from 0.4 to −0.2 indicating a reversal of the charge transfer direction.
 Fig. 6  (a) The variation of band gap and Bader charge transfer versus external electric field at the PBE level; (b) band edge positions versus external electric field; and (c) the band alignments of the vdWH under four typical Eext. 
In order to recognize the band gap variation and charge transfer reversal in detail, the evolution of band edges projected to the InS layer and arsenene layer versus external electric field is illustrated in Fig. 6(b). When Eext is [−0.4 V Å−1, 0.6 V Å−1], the VBM of the arsenene layer varies slightly, while the CBM of the InS layer is pushed up continuously, resulting in a monotonic increase of the band gap roughly from 0.03 eV to 0.95 eV (from 0.46 eV to 1.57 eV at the HSE level), presenting an obvious quantum-confined Stark effect. When Eext ≤ −0.5 V Å−1, a significant overlap of the VBM of arsenene and the CBM of the InS layer occurs, indicating a phase transition of the vdWH from the type-II semiconductor to type-III metal. Such a phase transition is also observed in HSE calculation when Eext = −0.8 V Å−1 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). However, when Eext increases furthermore from 0.6 V Å−1 to 0.8 V Å−1, both the CBM and VBM of the InS layer drop abruptly, leading to a rapid decrease of the band gap. Even more, when Eext = 0.8 V Å−1, the CBM of InS is even lower than the VBM of arsenene, and the semiconducting vdWH turns to a type-III metal ultimately. In such a wide range of external electric fields, both the VBM and CBM of the vdWH are always located at the Γ point.
In fact, the increase of band gap as a function of external electric field is intelligible, while its sudden decrease is suspicious. To understand this strange band gap variation, the band alignments of the vdWH under four typical Eext values are schematically presented in Fig. 6(c). When Eext = 0, the chemical potentials of the arsenene and InS layers are the same. Electrons transfer from the CBM of arsenene to the CBM of InS, while holes transfer from the VBM of InS to the CBM of arsenene. Meanwhile, an intrinsic build-in electric field exists inside the vdWH directing from arsenene to InS. When Eext is negative with the accordant direction of build-in electric field, the chemical potential and band edges of the InS layer are pushed down accompanied by more charge transfer. As a result, the band gap determined by the CBM of InS and the VBM of arsenene decreases and even reaches zero when Eext = −0.5 V Å−1. When Eext is positive, the chemical potential and band edges of the InS layer are pushed up accompanied by descending charge transfer. When Eext reaches 0.6 V Å−1, the external and internal electric fields just cancel out. In this case, the charge transfer between arsenene and InS layers becomes zero, and the band gap reaches the maximum. With a further increase of Eext (the last panel), ΔQ decreases less than zero as shown in Fig. 6(a), and electrons start to transfer from the InS layer to arsenene. It is this reversion of the charge transfer direction that reduces the chemical potential and band edges of InS enormously, because its effect is much stronger to counteract the promotion of chemical potential by the external electric field. As a result, the band gap decreases obviously again. In other words, the band gap variation of the vdWH is determined by the competition between the external electric field and charge transfer. The effective regulation of the band gap by an external electric field can greatly extend the application of the InS–arsenene vdWH in the optoelectronic devices and TFETs.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have built the InS–arsenene vdWH and investigated its electronic behaviors by using the DFT method at both PBE and HSE levels. The vdWH possesses a stable structure, excellent flexibility, high carrier mobility and direct band gap semiconducting behavior. More importantly, its electronic properties can be effectively tuned by out-plane vertical strains, in-plane biaxial strain and an external electric field. Based on these regulatory measures, the vdWH can undergo multiple band alignment transitions (type I, type II and type III) and transfer between semiconductor and metal. The highly tunable electronic properties and multiple band alignments make the InS–arsenene vdWH suitable to be applied to design multi-purpose devices and tunnel FETs.
