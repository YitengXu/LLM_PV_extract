    , Accepted 17th October 2014First published on 3rd November 2014AbstractA rational design strategy of novel fluorophores for luminescent down-shifting (LDS) application was proposed and tested in this paper. Three new fluorophores (1a–c) with specific intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics were synthesized as LDS molecules for increasing the output short circuit current density (Jsc) of a CdTe solar cell. Photophysical studies of their solution and solid states, and photovoltaic measurements of their PMMA solid films applied on a CdTe solar cell suggested that the specific spectroscopic properties and Jsc enhancement effects of these molecules were highly related to their chemical structures. The Jsc enhancement effects of these fluorophores were measured on both a CdTe small cell and a large panel. An increase in the output Jsc by as high as 5.69% for a small cell and 8.88% for a large panel was observed. Compared to a traditional LDS molecule, Y083, these fluorophores exhibited more superior capabilities of LDS.
Introduction
The cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cell has been considered to be one of the most promising photovoltaic (PV) technologies in recent years and accounts for a significant portion of the PV market in the future because of its low-cost and easy-manufacture, compared to the traditional crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell.1,2 However, the CdTe solar cell exhibits a poor spectral response to the short-wavelength region (<500 nm) due to the absorption of the n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS, Eg = 2.42 eV) ‘window’ layer in the cell structure, which inevitably leads to some degree of output current loss.3,4 To eliminate or minimize this issue, numerous efforts have been made to optimize the cell structure to reduce the absorption effect of the CdS layer.5–7 However, the most effective and efficient approach is to use a luminescent down-shifting (LDS) layer that is placed on the front surface of the cell to modify the spectrum of the incident light.8,9 A LDS layer is typically a polymer sheet with luminescent molecules (fluorophores) embedded in it, which can convert the short-wavelength photons into long-wavelength photons by the process of photon absorption and emission.
Until now, BASF Lumogen F dye Yellow 083 (Y083) has been the most widely used fluorophore in research for the LDS application to improve the output short circuit current density (Jsc) of the CdTe solar cell.10–12 Early studies showed that applying a LDS film of Y083 on the front surface of a CdTe solar cell could enhance its output Jsc by as high as 33% through conversion of photons from a wavelength below 500 nm to over 500 nm.9 However, as the cell fabrication with new technologies is improved, the poor short-wavelength response of the cell is gradually solved at the cell structure level. Compared to an old type CdTe solar cell, the new one exhibits a nearly doubled short-wavelength spectral response. Consequently, the Jsc enhancement effect (ΔJsc%) of Y083 on the new type of CdTe solar cell decreases to 4%.13 Such a significant decrease in the ΔJsc% value is attributed to two aspects – an increase of the parasitic absorption effect and an insufficient emission spectral match. The increased parasitic absorption effect of Y083 is the result of significantly increased spectral overlap between absorption of Y083 and the spectral response of the new type of CdTe solar cell in the wavelength region of 400–500 nm. Such an increased parasitic absorption effect gives rise to the Jsc loss (Jloss%) of 6.6%, compared to 3.8% for the old type cell (Fig. S1, ESI†). The insufficient emission spectral match originated from the mismatch between the emission spectrum of Y083 and the maximum spectral response (600–800 nm) of the CdTe solar cell. The emission spectral matching factor (Fem) is 0.70 for the old type CdTe solar cell and 0.84 for the new one (Fig. S2, ESI†). Besides the high Jloss% and low Fem, application of Y083 as a LDS material also suffers from its fluorescence self-quenching in the solid state because of its perylene-based planar molecule, possessing the potential for π–π stacking. The fluorescence self-quenching enables Y083 to have a quantum yield of 0.92 compared to its near unity value (0.99) in solution,11,14 which results in about 7% loss in photon conversion efficiency during the LDS process.
To avoid these problems and improve its application in LDS, a fluorophore should have a more blue-shifted absorption and a more red-shifted emission than that of Y083, i.e. have a large Stokes shift. In addition, a minimized potential π–π stacking effect and an optimized fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state are also desired. To increase the Stokes shift of a fluorophore, one approach is to construct a molecular system structured with donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties to achieve an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).15,16 For such a D–A type fluorophore, its absorption spectrum is dominated by the photophysical properties of the donor while its emission is related to the charge transfer (CT) rate from the donor to the acceptor upon molecular excitation. A high CT rate will result in a large change in the transition dipole moment of the molecule, and consequently induces a large Stokes shift.17 Our previous studies have shown that the absorption and emission spectra as well as the Stokes shift can be fine-tuned by manipulating the charge densities of the donor and/or the acceptor to achieve various CT rates.18,19 On the other hand, the π–π stacking effect associated with Y083 can be minimized or prevented if the molecular structure is more flexible.20,21 Recent studies show that fluorophores with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) structures exhibit aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics that can help prevent the π–π stacking effect and thus increase the solid state fluorescence quantum yield.22,23 The mechanism of AIE is probably due to the molecular restricted internal rotation (RIR) of the free-rotated phenyl rings that impedes the non-radiative decay pathway during the emission process.24
Therefore, to overcome the disadvantages of Y083, we propose a rational design strategy to take advantage of both molecular ICT and AIE mechanisms in designing more effective and efficient LDS molecules. In this paper, we report three newly-designed fluorophores (1a–c) with specific ICT and AIE characteristics. Their photophysical properties as well as their Jsc enhancement effects as LDS molecules are highly related to their chemical structures. Compared to Y083, all synthesized fluorophores exhibit large Stokes shifts (up to 170 nm) with a blue-shifted absorption and a red-shifted emission as well as high solid state fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.99). Thereby, they have a less parasitic absorption effect (Jloss% as low as 4.0%) and/or higher degree of emission spectral matching (Fem up to 0.86) with the CdTe solar cell than that of Y083 (6.2% and 0.81, respectively) for the CdTe solar cell used in our experiment. Their Jsc enhancement effects were measured on both a small CdTe solar cell and a large CdTe solar panel. Applying their solid PMMA films on a small CdTe solar cell and a large CdTe solar panel enhances the output Jsc by as high as 5.69% and 8.88%, respectively.
Results and discussion
Molecular synthesis
The molecular structures of fluorophores 1a–c and their synthetic routes are demonstrated in Scheme 1. All synthesized fluorophores contain the structures of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and a di-cyano (DCN) group. The major synthetic techniques are the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling to form the TPE group and the Knoevenagel condensation to form the DCN group. In addition to the synthesis of fluorophores 1a–c shown in the Experimental section, the detailed synthetic procedures and characterization of other compounds are described in the ESI.† Since our molecular design strategy is to use the TPE group as a charge donor (D) and the DCN group as a charge acceptor (A), fluorophores 1a–c can be considered as D–A, D–A–D and A–D–A type fluorophores, respectively.

After synthesis, the thermal stabilities of these fluorophores were investigated by TGA and DSC (Fig. S3, ESI†). The decomposition temperature (Td) of fluorophores 1a–c is 263 °C, 365 °C and 308 °C, respectively. The melting temperature (Tm) of fluorophores 1a and 1b is 156 °C and 270 °C, respectively. Fluorophore 1c did not show apparently melting down during the measurement. The results of the thermal stabilities of these synthesized fluorophores suggest that they are highly thermally stable and worth for further photophysical studies and photovoltaic applications.
Photophysical studies
The photophysical properties of fluorophores 1a–c were studied in both solution and solid states. Solution samples were prepared by dissolving each fluorophore in 1,4-dioxane. Solid samples were prepared by doping each fluorophore in PMMA to form solid films. Fig. 1a depicts their absorption and emission spectra in 1,4-dioxane solution while Fig. 1b depicts their absorption and emission spectra in solid PMMA film. For comparison, absorption and emission spectra of Y083, the spectral response of a CdTe solar cell and an AM1.5G solar spectrum (photon distribution) are also shown in Fig. 1b. The pertinent photophysical parameters are summarized in Table 1.

It is noted in Table 1 that there is not much difference in the maximum absorption wavelength (λabs) of fluorophores 1a–c between their 1,4-dioxane solution samples and PMMA solid samples. This can be explained by the Franck–Condon principle that the absorption process is environmentally insensitive because the transition speed of the electron is very fast in femtoseconds than that of the molecular structure relaxation.26 A slight difference is found in their maximum emission wavelength (λem) because the emission process is more environmentally dependent. It is well-known that 1,4-dioxane has low solvent polarity. Therefore, the large Stokes shift (147–167 nm) of these fluorophores is believed not coming from the solvent effect of 1,4-dioxane but the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process that is intrinsically associated with fluorophores 1a–c. Such an ICT process also leads to large Stokes shifts (139–170 nm) of these fluorophores in the solid state, which are much larger than Y083 (64 nm). Besides the difference in the Stokes shift, large differences in the molar absorption coefficient (ε) and fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) are also found among these fluorophores. The low ε value in the solid state suggests that these fluorophores exhibit a low photon absorption probability due to the fixed molecular conformation, compared to the free-rotating molecular conformation in solution. The lower Φf value in solution than that in the solid is known to be due to the AIE phenomenon that TPE-based AIE fluorophores usually exhibit extreme low fluorescence quantum yields in solution but high fluorescence quantum yields in the solid. Compared to Y083, except for fluorophore 1c (0.81) other two fluorophores exhibit higher quantum yields (0.99 for 1a and 0.98 for 1b) than that of Y083 (0.92). It is believed that their large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields are due to their intrinsic ICT and AIE characteristics, which will be further studied.
We believe that the large Stokes shifts associated with these fluorophores are due to the ICT process that occurred within the fluorophores upon excitation. Their ICT characteristics were investigated by solvatochromism measurements and theoretical calculations. In the solvatochromism measurements, each fluorophore was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane–acetonitrile mixtures and the absorption and emission wavelengths were measured to obtain the Stokes shifts. The Stokes shifts (in wavenumber) are plotted vs. solvent orientation polarizability (Δf) – a parameter described in the Lippert–Mataga equation (Δf = (J − 1)/(2J + 1) − (n2 − 1)/(2n2 + 1), where J is the dielectric constant and n is the refractive index),27–29 – in Fig. 2a. The theoretical calculations were performed using DFT and TD-DFT methods at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The molecular charge distribution on the HOMO and LUMO of each fluorophore is depicted in Fig. 2b. The maximum Stokes shift change upon Δf (Δ(Δυ)/Δ(Δf)), transition dipole moment change (|μe − μg|) and the calculated charge transfer (CT) rate are listed in Table 2. The detailed experimental and theoretical procedures and methods are described in the ESI.†

It is noted that all the synthesized fluorophores exhibit ICT characteristics suggested by changing their Stokes shifts non-linearly with the increase of Δf in solvatochromism measurements (Fig. 2a), and the charge transfer processes were observed from the ground state to the excited state based on the charge distribution of the HOMO and LUMO in theoretical calculations (Fig. 2b). In Table 2, fluorophore 1b exhibits the highest Δ(Δυ)/Δ(Δf) value (9418 cm−1), indicating that it possesses the strongest ICT characteristic among all fluorophores. Such strong ICT characteristic of fluorophore 1b comes from the huge transition dipole moment change (27.5 D) from the ground state to the excited state associated with a high CT rate that 57% charge flows forward from the TPE group to the DCN group upon molecular absorption and 54% flows backward upon molecular emission. For fluorophore 1c, its Δ(Δυ)/Δ(Δf) value (3984 cm−1) is the lowest with a relatively small change in its transition dipole moment (12.6 D). Its CT rate is only 39% during the absorption and 27% during the emission. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the ICT characteristics of these fluorophores are closely related to their molecular structures. Compared to fluorophore 1a, fluorophore 1b has one more TPE group (charge donor) in its structure while fluorophore 1c has one more DCN group (charge acceptor). Fluorophore 1b exhibits the strongest ICT characteristic while fluorophore 1c exhibits the weakest. The order of transition dipole moment change in solvatochromism measurements and the calculated CT rate in theoretical calculations of fluorophores 1a–c is 1b > 1a > 1c. Therefore, the strength of ICT characteristic of fluorophores 1a–c is 1b > 1a > 1c.
It is noted in Table 1 that fluorophores 1a–c exhibit a huge increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) from their 1,4-dioxane solution to the solid PMMA film. Such an increase in Φf can be attributed to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics of these fluorophores. The AIE characteristics of these fluorophores were investigated by measuring Φf and the fluorescence lifetime (τf). Φf values were measured in acetonitrile–water mixtures from 40% to 95% water fraction. τf values were measured in 95% water fraction of the acetonitrile–water mixture (fitted by a two-exponential decay equation) and solid PMMA films (fitted by a single-exponential decay equation, the fitting methods are described in the ESI†). The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 and the fluorescence lifetime parameters are listed in Table 3.

Because all fluorophores are structurally hydrophobic, they are expected to precipitate out as nanoparticles (aggregation phenomenon) in high water content solutions. And such an aggregation will lead to the increase in fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) of these fluorophores if they possess AIE characteristics. A significant increase was found in fluorescence intensity measurements of fluorophores 1a–c in 40% and 90% mixtures (Fig. S4, ESI†). In Fig. 3a, with the increase in the water fraction in the mixture, the Φf values of fluorophores 1a–c began to increase at the point at 70%, 50% and 80%, indicating that all fluorophores exhibit AIE characteristics and fluorophore 1b has the highest degree of aggregation while fluorophore 1c has the lowest. The AIE characteristic is from the molecular restricted internal rotation (RIR) of the TPE group in the fluorophore in the solid, which impedes the non-radiative decay pathway and thus boosts the fluorescence quantum yield. The AIE mechanism was further investigated by measuring the fluorescence lifetimes of fluorophores 1a–c in the solvent mixture and solid state. In Fig. 3b, it is noted that the fluorophores 1a–c exhibited a two-exponential decay pattern in 95% water fraction solution while a single-exponential decay pattern in the solid PMMA film. This is because there were two components in 95% water fraction solution – free molecules in solution and the aggregated molecules in the solid form. As shown in Table 3, the shorter lifetimes (1.00–1.37 ns) can be ascribed to the molecules in solution while the longer ones (3.89–4.67 ns) to those in solid, which are consistent with the lifetimes (2.95–3.32 ns) directly measured from the solid PMMA films. From the point of view of the molecular structure of each fluorophore, fluorophore 1b exhibits the highest fluorescence quantum yield with the longest lifetime in its solid state due to one more TPE group in its structure while fluorophore 1c exhibits the lowest fluorescence quantum yield and the shortest lifetime due to one more DCN group. Therefore, the strength of AIE characteristics of fluorophores 1a–c is 1b > 1a > 1c.
Photovoltaic application
From Fig. 1b, it is noted that the absorption spectra of fluorophores 1a–c cover the weak spectral response region of the CdTe solar cell while their emission spectra are under the strong spectral response region of the cell. Therefore, it is worth investigating the luminescent down-shifting (LDS) effect of these fluorophores on the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the CdTe solar cell. To evaluate the Jsc enhancement effects of these synthesized fluorophores, LDS films containing each of the synthesized fluorophores as well as Y083 with the weight concentration from 0.2 to 2.0% were prepared. The detailed preparation method is described in the Experimental section. The spectral response (EQE) of the CdTe solar cell used in the measurement is depicted in Fig. 1b, which is similar to that of the large CdTe module depicted in Fig. S1b (ESI†). Three different methods were used in the LDS measurements to evaluate the Jsc enhancement abilities of the LDS films. The first method is to directly measure the photocurrent (Iph) using a multimeter under the incident light from a solar simulator. The second method is to measure the I–V curve using a sourcemeter to obtain the short circuit current (Isc) under the same incident light as the first method. The third method is to measure the cell EQE and the results were integrated with the AM1.5G solar spectrum to afford the Jsc value. The Jsc enhancement values (ΔJsc%), calculated from the three methods are denoted ΔJsc%ph (= Iph/Iph,0 − 1), ΔJsc%I–V (= Isc/Isc,0 − 1) and ΔJsc%EQE (= Jsc/Jsc,0 − 1), respectively, where the subscript ‘0’ stands for the bare cell without the LDS layer. The ΔJsc% values of 2.0% LDS films for each method are listed in Table 4 and the average values (ΔJsc%avg) are also given.

It is shown in Table 4 that values of ΔJsc% obtained from these three methods are not exactly equal to each other. The differences in ΔJsc% are mainly caused by using different instruments and light sources in the measurements. The difference between ΔJsc%ph obtained directly from photocurrent (Iph) measurements and ΔJsc%I–V obtained from short circuit current (Isc) measured using a multimeter is caused by different external electrical loads applied in the measuring system. In addition, ΔJsc%EQE values are lower than the others because the light from a solar simulator is not exactly the same as the AM1.5G solar spectrum. The xenon lamp in the solar simulator may have more short-wavelength light than that of the AM1.5G sunlight. In order to make meaningful comparisons between these fluorophores, average values of ΔJsc% were used and believed to be more reliable. The ΔJsc%avg value of 2.0% LDS films containing fluorophores 1a–c is 3.95%, 5.69% and 1.74%, respectively. Compared to Y083, fluorophores 1a and 1b exhibit stronger Jsc enhancing effects while fluorophore 1c exhibits less effects. The differences in ΔJsc%avg between these fluorophores can be explained by the three critical parameters listed in Table 4 – Jloss%, Fem and Φf,solid. As discussed before, Jloss% indicates the parasitic absorption effect of the fluorophore, and high Jloss% means the fluorophore exhibits red-shifted absorption and thus exhibits much spectral overlaps with the spectral response of the CdTe solar cell. Fem indicates the degree that emission spectrum matches with the spectral response of the CdTe solar cell, and high Fem means the fluorophore exhibits red-shifted emission. Φf,solid is the solid state fluorescence quantum yield of a fluorophore, indicating the photon conversion efficiency from photon absorption to photon emission. The calculated Jloss% and Fem values are consistent with the spectral shift observed in Fig. 1b as well as the photophysical parameters listed in Table 1. The order of absorption spectral shift of these fluorophores from red to blue is Y083 > 1b > 1c > 1a (Table 1), which is consistent with the order of Jloss% in Table 4. The order of emission spectral shift of these fluorophores from red to blue is 1b > Y083 > 1c > 1a (Table 1), which is also consistent with the order of Fem values in Table 4. From the analyses of the impacts of three parameters on ΔJsc%avg in Table 4, it can be concluded that to achieve high ΔJsc%avg, the fluorophore should exhibit low Jloss% but high Fem and Φf,solid, i.e. with blue-shifted absorption but red-shifted emission and near unity solid state fluorescence quantum yield. Among the three fluorophores, fluorophores 1a and 1b exhibit higher ΔJsc%avg (3.95% and 5.69%, respectively) than that of Y083 (3.28%) because they have either a low Jloss% (4.0% for 1a) or a high Fem (0.86 for 1b). For fluorophore 1c, the lower ΔJsc%avg (1.74%) than that of Y083 (3.28%) is mainly caused by its low Φf,solid (0.81), which is at least over 10% lower than that of Y083 (0.92), fluorophores 1a (0.99) and 1b (0.98), suggesting more than 10% photon loss during the LDS process.
In order to further investigate the Jsc enhancement effects of these fluorophores, ΔJsc%ph was recorded with the LDS films with various fluorophore concentrations of each fluorophore. Moreover, the effect of a 2.0% LDS film of each fluorophore on the spectral response (EQE) of the CdTe solar cell was also studied. The experimental results are depicted in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  (a) ΔJsc%ph of the LDS films containing various concentrations of each fluorophore and (b) the spectral response (EQE) of a CdTe solar cell with a 2.0% LDS film of each fluorophore. 

Fig. 4a shows, with the increase in the concentration of each fluorophore in the LDS film, ΔJsc%ph gradually increases and reaches the plateau. The estimated concentration of ΔJsc%ph to reach its plateau is 1.2% for each fluorophore. The observed increasing patterns of ΔJsc%ph with the fluorophore concentrations in LDS film are governed by the Beer–Lambert law. An increase in the concentration of the fluorophore in LDS films within the lower concentration range can significantly affect the absorbance of the LDS film, i.e. the more fluorophores in the LDS film the more short-wavelength photons will be absorbed and converted into long-wavelength photons, therefore increase the ΔJsc%ph. However, since the concentration is an exponential function of absorbance, a further increase in the fluorophore concentration in the LDS films within the higher concentration range will attenuate the concentration effect on ΔJsc%ph and ultimately lead to a maximum effect on ΔJsc%ph (Fig. 4a). Also, a further increase in the concentration (>4%) will block the incident light and affect the cell performance.11 For fluorophores 1a–c and Y083, this maximum is estimated to be 4.12%, 5.94%, 1.61% and 3.48% (Table 4), respectively. As the maximum effects on ΔJsc%ph are achieved, it is expected that the spectral response of the CdTe solar cell to a short-wavelength will be significantly enhanced. The expected enhancements in the spectral response (EQE) to a short-wavelength for each fluorophore are shown in Fig. 4b. The EQE of a CdTe solar cell at 400 nm was enhanced from 0.35 to a magnitude between 0.49 and 0.67 by these fluorophores while EQE over 500 nm was not affected, showing the same response level with the bare cell. It is noted that these EQE enhancements in short-wavelength by LDS films are significant, compared to any other methods upon modifying the cell internal structure.5–7
The superior Jsc enhancement effects of fluorophores 1a and 1b over Y083, demonstrated by these small CdTe solar experiments, encouraged us to do further investigation on the effects on a large CdTe solar panel. 2.0% LDS film samples containing each fluorophore (1a and 1b) as well as Y083 (Fig. 5a) were doped on the surface of a large CdTe solar panel. For the large CdTe solar panel, the measurements of its spectral response (EQE) and the I–V curve are impossible due to its bulk and heavy weight. Therefore, an alternative method was developed, in which the CdTe solar panel was placed directly in the sunlight and its output photocurrent (Iph,panel) at various solar power densities (H) was recorded. The slopes of the obtained Iph,panel and H relationship were derived by linear fitting (Fig. 5b). Comparing the slope of the Iph,panel and H relationship of the bare panel to the slopes of the Iph,panel and H relationship of the panel with LDS films enables us to obtain the Jsc enhancement percentage (ΔJsc%ph,panel) of each fluorophore. The detailed data processing protocols are described in the Experimental section.
 Fig. 5  (a) Surface images of a LDS film doped CdTe solar panel and (b) the linear relationship between photocurrent (Iph,panel) and solar power density (H) of the bare solar panel and the LDS film doped solar panel. 
From Fig. 5a, it is obvious that all LDS films were uniformly doped on the CdTe solar panel surface without any air bubble between interfaces. The color of the LDS films containing fluorophores 1a, 1b and Y083 is green, deep green and dark yellow, respectively. For both bare and LDS film doped CdTe solar panels, their output photocurrent (Iph,panel) exhibit good linear relationship with the incident solar power density (H). ΔJsc%ph,panel of fluorophores 1a, 1b and Y083 calculated from linear fitting the results in Fig. 5b is 6.02%, 8.88% and 4.01% (Table 5), respectively. In Table 5, Δ(ΔJsc%ph)% is defined as the percentage increase in ΔJsc% between the CdTe small cell and large panel experiments. The Δ(ΔJsc%ph)% values of these fluorophores are 46%, 49% and 15% higher than the ΔJsc%ph value obtained from the small CdTe solar cell. Such an increase in ΔJsc% of the CdTe solar cell from a small unit to a large module can be attributed to the minimized photon side loss in the larger device because of the large surface area (225 cm2) of the panel compared to the area (1 cm2) of the small cell. Among the fluorophores tested with the large panel, Y083 only exhibits 15% increase in its Δ(ΔJsc%ph)% value, which is due to its weak photo-/thermo-stability under intensive sunlight during the long time course of the measurement.30

Conclusion
In conclusion, in this work, we proposed the rational design of a series of fluorophores as effective and efficient LDS molecules. In these fluorophores, the TPE group serves as a charge donor as well as an AIE functional group while the di-cyano group serves as a charge acceptor. All fluorophores possess the advantage of both molecular ICT and AIE mechanisms, exhibiting large Stokes shifts (up to 170 nm) and high solid state fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.99). Their photophysical properties are highly related to their chemical structures. Compared to a traditional LDS molecule, Y083, they have less parasitic absorption effect (Jloss% as low as 4.0%) and/or higher degree of emission spectral matching (Fem up to 0.86) with the CdTe solar cell. Applying their solid PMMA films on a small CdTe solar cell and a large CdTe solar panel can enhance the output Jsc by as high as 5.69% and 8.88%, respectively, which are superior to Y083 (3.28% and 4.01%).

Thermal stability measurements
Thermal stabilities were studied on Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 and DSC 7. TGA analysis was performed under ambient conditions from 30 °C to 450 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The typical mass used for DSC runs was 3.0–3.5 mg. The scans were performed from 50 °C to 325 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Decomposition temperature (Td) is defined at the point of 5% mass loss.
Spectroscopic measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Beckman Coulter DU730 Life Science UV-Vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Emission spectra were collected on an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer at room temperature. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON fluorocube using 459 nm LED as the excitation light source with a 500 nm long pass filter at room temperature.
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 09 package. All fluorophores were calculated in the gas phase without using the SCRF method to reduce the computational effort. Ground state (S0) geometries were optimized by using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d) function. Excited state (S1) geometries were optimized by using the time-dependent (TD) method with the same function. Single point calculations for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were conducted at S0 and S1 optimal geometries.
LDS film preparation
Briefly, 7.5 g of PMMA powder (purchased from TCI America) was dissolved in 100 g of toluene in a 250 mL flask. The mixture was stirred overnight and the insoluble PMMA was filtered off. Then, 2 g of the PMMA solution was finely mixed with variable amounts of each synthesized fluorophore in a 10 mL vial. The fluorophore–PMMA mixture was poured into a Petri dish (R25 × 15 mm). The solvent was evaporated under ambient conditions and further dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 1 h. The films were finally cut and peeled off from the Petri dish in warm water. The thickness of the prepared films is estimated to be about 50 μm.
Photovoltaic measurements
For the LDS measurements on the small CdTe solar cell (provided by Professor Alvin Compaan, University of Toledo),31 a 150 W solar simulator (model# 96000, Newport Corporation) equipped with a xenon lamp and an AM1.5G filter (model# 81092, Newport Corporation) was used as the light source. The incident power density was 100 mW cm−2, measured using a solar power meter (Amprobe SOLAR-100). Photocurrent (Iph) was measured directly using a digital multimeter (GB electrical GDT200A). Short circuit current (Isc) was obtained from the I–V curve measured using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2420 3A). EQE was measured from 370 to 800 nm in 10 nm steps on a modified fluorometer by using the same CdTe solar cell as the reference. Due to the small size of 1 cm2 with the thickness of 3 mm of the cell, a large portion of photon loss (over 10%) from the side was expected during the measurements.8 Index matching fluid was used to fill the interface between the LDS film and the front surface of the CdTe solar cell to reduce the refractive photon loss.
For the LDS studies on the large CdTe solar panel (First Solar FS-272), the LDS film was directly doped on the front surface (selected area of 225 cm2) of the solar panel by the preparation method described previously but without the index matching fluid. For 2.0% LDS films, the amount of each fluorophore used for doping is 27 mg. The thickness of the LDS film was the same as the one studied on the small cell. The solar panel was set up in the campus (Washington State University, Pullman, United States) and mostly sunny with a little cloudy weather was chosen to achieve various power densities (H) of the incident sunlight ranging from 800 to 1200 W m−2 during the measurement. The measured photocurrent from the solar panel (Iph,panel) shows a linear relationship with H for both the bare solar panel and the LDS film doped solar panel:Iph,panel,0 = k0 × H (bare) and Iph,panel,LDS = kLDS × H (with LDS film)
The Jsc enhancement effect of the fluorophore in the doped LDS film was calculated using:
