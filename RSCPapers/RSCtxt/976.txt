    , Accepted 7th June 2017First published on 7th June 2017AbstractTo overcome the problems of thermal, moisture and photo-stability of existing methylammonium based perovskites, formamidinium-based compositions are introduced for photovoltaic application. Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) mixed compositions of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite type solar cells have shown the highest efficiency of 22.1%. For FAPbI3, two different polymorphs exist at room temperature: one is the hexagonal non-perovskite phase (δ-phase) and the other is the perovskite cubic phase (α-phase). The non-perovskite phase can be detrimental to the solar cell performance. To eradicate the undesired phase, a systematic evaluation of phase formation and crystallization is necessary. Here, we investigated the room temperature crystallization of the perovskite and non-perovskite phases of FAPbI3 by solvent and antisolvent induced crystallization methods using a two-step sequential deposition method. For each phase, the volume fraction is estimated using the X-ray diffraction technique. At room temperature, the δ-phase is found to grow as long one-dimensional nanorods and its volume fraction increases with the dipping time. It is observed that the presence of an antisolvent has a moderate control on the δ-phase growth. Experimentally, with the detailed solvent-induced time dependent crystallization study, we have proved the effective elimination of the δ-phase and the stability of the FA1−xMAxPbI3 perovskite phase.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites are under intense investigation for their aptness as absorber materials in photovoltaic devices. Since the first report on methylammonium lead iodide/bromide (MAPbI3/MAPbBr3) perovskites as light absorber materials with 3.8% power conversion efficiency, researchers have made tremendous efforts towards developing new synthetic routes and device engineering to bring out the current highest reported efficiency of 22.1% for hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSC).1,2 Out of several compositions reported in the literature, MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells have taken the majority part showing high power conversion efficiencies including the highest efficiency of 19%.3–5 However, MAPbI3 was reported to undergo reversible phase transition from the tetragonal to the cubic phase at 55 °C, which is in the range of the solar cell operating temperature.6 The structural phase transition is expected to have an ill-effect on the photo- and thermal stability of perovskite solar cells. Also MAPbI3 was reported to be unstable against light and heat due to its low crystallization energy. Its poor stability against light, moisture and temperature demanded the search of new compositions similar to MAPbI3 perovskite.7,8
In view of these aspects, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) is introduced as a solar absorber material which has comparatively better thermal stability than MAPbI3.9,10 FAPbI3 perovskite materials have a narrower band gap of 1.48 eV than MAPbI3, at 1.55 eV, and these can be tailored between 1.48–2.23 eV with the compositional variation of halides.11 The narrower band gap facilitates absorption of light with longer wavelengths up to the near infrared region. In addition, FAPbI3 has two-fold higher effective charge carrier mobilities than MAPbI3.12–14 Inspite of the above mentioned outstanding properties, FAPbI3 suffers from polymorphism at room temperature, resulting in phase purity issues. Two crystalline phases exist for FAPbI3 at room temperature: one is the perovskite cubic phase with a lattice parameter a = 6.362 Å, which belongs to the Pm3m space group, and is called the α-phase,15,16 and the other is the hexagonal non-perovskite phase (lattice parameters, a = b = 8.622 Å and c = 7.945 Å), which belongs to the p63mc space group, and is called δ-phase.16,17 The β-phase (trigonal, p3 space group) occurs at much lower temperatures (150 K).17 The α-phase is black in colour with a band gap of 1.48 eV and possesses desired characteristics for an appropriate light absorbing material and has a perovskite structure; the δ-phase possesses a yellow colour and does not have the required high light absorbing capability. The presence of the non-perovskite yellow polymorph (δ-phase) can diminish the photovoltaic performance of a device.
The morphology and the film quality of a perovskite absorber material is one of the most significant factors that influence the overall photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. An unprecedented amount of efforts have been devoted toward controlling MAPbI3 perovskite crystallization for improved film quality, and gaining better understanding of the crystallization kinetics.18–21 In the case of the MAPbI3, it has been shown that rapid nucleation of MAPbI3 crystals can be induced through antisolvent treatments.22–26 This is also found to be an effective strategy to achieve large-area, pinhole-free, high quality MAPbI3 films. Even though the solution crystallization behavior has been studied extensively, it is almost exclusively limited to MAPbI3 perovskite thin films. Few reports have dealt with the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite. For the crystallization of FAPbI3 in the δ-phase, possible attempts have been reported in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge there is no report yet which deals with the systematic time-dependent microstructure evolution of the α and δ phases of FAPbI3. Understanding the crystallization behavior of FAPbI3 perovskite in different phases is critical for reproducibility and reliability in PSC fabrication.
In this work, we performed a detailed investigation of the impact of growth duration on the microstructure evolution of the α and δ phases of FAPbI3. Experiments were carried out by simple two-step sequential formation of FAPbI3, which comprises of deposition of PbI2 films and the sequential dipping into the formamidinium iodide (FAI) solution. During the dipping process, the conversion of the yellow PbI2 film into FAPbI3 took place. This current method of variable dipping times facilitates identification of the optimized dipping time for PbI2 conversion into α-FAPbI3 with ‘no’ or ‘minimal quantity’ of δ-FAPbI3 and evaluation of their corresponding microstructures. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) is added to the FAI solution and the stability of the achieved α-phase of FA1−xMAxPbI3 is evaluated.
Experimental
Materials
Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), lead iodide (PbI2, 99%), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), diethyl ether (anhydrous, 99.7%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%) and alumina dispersion (Al2O3, <50 nm, 20 wt% in isopropanol) were procured from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Methylamine (40 wt% in methanol) was procured from TCI chemicals. Toluene (99.9%) was bought from Merck Millipore. Titania paste (TiO2, 18 NR–T) and fluorine doped tin oxide on glass (FTO glass, 7 Ω sq−1.) were obtained from Dyesol. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was procured from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals, China.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction studies were carried out using a PANalytical–MRD™ diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. In situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse model fluorescence spectrophotometer. For excitation, a wavelength of 480 nm (laser) was used for all PL measurements. In situ absorbance measurements were obtained using a Jasco V-650 model UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy images were captured using SEM (Zeiss Ultra 55).
FAI and MAI synthesis
For FAI formation, an equimolar ratio of formamidinium acetate and hydriodic acid was mixed together in a round bottom flask at room temperature. After reacting them for 30 min, ethanol (absolute) was added. With the help of a rotary evaporator, ethanol was removed at 60 °C resulting in the formation of white crystals of FAI. To remove the by-product (acetic acid), the as formed FAI was washed with diethyl ether three times and re-dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized using the rotary evaporator at 60 °C by extracting ethanol. Methyl amine evaporates at room temperature, therefore MAI synthesis was carried out with the help of an ice bath. For MAI synthesis, a round bottom flask was immersed in an ice bath and methylamine was added; hydriodic acid was added drop wise to it in an equimolar ratio. After reacting for 30 min, the round bottom flask containing the mixture is removed from the ice bath and subjected to rotary evaporation at 60 °C. After this step, a similar method to that mentioned for FAI was followed to obtain MAI. For methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) crystallization, a Buchi rotary evaporator was used. (Here, MA: CH3NH3+ and FA: HNCHNH3+).
Perovskite formation under in situ measurements
Plain and FTO glasses were cut and cleaned with soapy water, DI water and ethanol by ultrasonication for 15 min with each of them. These cleaned substrates were heated to 450 °C for 1 hour to remove the presence of any residual organics. After cooling, they were spin coated with titania or alumina slurry (titania and alumina are mixed with ethanol (1:4 w/w) to make the slurry suitable for spin coating) and heated to 500 °C to get mesoporous layers (mp-alumina: glass/mp-Al2O3 or FTO/mp-Al2O3 or for mp-titania: glass/TiO2 or FTO/TiO2). 1 M PbI2 solution in DMF was prepared and spin coated on to the mesoporous substrates and heated to 100 °C for 20 min and brought back to room temperature. The spin coating parameters at all stages were fixed to be 5000 rpm for 30 s. Later, these substrates were used for in situ perovskite formation.

In situ photoluminescence (PL) or absorbance measurements were carried out in the following way. First, solutions were prepared in three formulations: F1, F2 and F3. For F1, FAI was dissolved in 2-propanol, with a resulting concentration of 8 mg ml−1. For F2, FAI was dissolved in (toluene + 2-propanol, 1:10 v/v), with a resulting concentration of 8 mg ml−1. For F3, a mixture of FAI (6.8 mg ml−1) and MAI (1.2 mg ml−1) was dissolved in 2-propanol, with a resulting concentration of 8 mg ml−1. For in situ measurements, solutions from one of these three formulations were taken into the cuvette and then the sample glass/mp-alumina/PbI2 was dipped into the solution. The measurement scans for PL or absorbance of the evolving perovskite film were then subsequently started. The scans were carried out for specified time intervals. The choice of mp-alumina for PL measurements is due to the fact that alumina does not quench the PL intensity as its energy band levels do not match that of perovskite. Therefore, the porous structure only acts as a scaffold for the distribution of the materials. For XRD measurements, substrates were withdrawn from the dipping solution after a specific dipping duration and immediately washed with pure 2-propanol to arrest further crystallization and a similar procedure was followed for SEM studies also. As the mp-titania is being used as electron transport materials for PSC devices, the microstructure evolution on mp-titania justifies the crystallization and phase evolution study. Hence, mp-titania substrates were used for PbI2 coating and dipping in the FAI solution for SEM and XRD studies. It is important to mention that during spin coating, the mesoporous structures help to distribute the PbI2 and at the dipping stage, FAI effectively reaches PbI2via mesoporous layers to react with it to form perovskite.
Perovskite formation for initial assessment
For the initial assessment to evaluate the formation of various perovskite compositions and to identify the various phases, the films are made in the following way.
1 M PbI2 was dissolved in DMF, spin coated on to plain glass and heated at 100 °C to remove the solvent and then cooled down to room temperature. The as-formed PbI2 film on plain glass was dipped into the FAI solution (formula F1). After 2 min of dipping, the substrate was removed from the solution and cut into two pieces. One piece of substrate was heated to 150 °C for 10 min, with the aim of forming α-FAPbI3 and the other was stored for 3 days at room temperature in a desiccator, with the aim of forming δ-FAPbI3. Since the evaluation of crystallization is on the FTO/mp-TiO2 substrates, the perovskite compositions were also made on these mesoporous substrates as described below and their structural characterization results were compared with the films made on glass in the subsequent section.
For FAPbI3: 1 M PbI2 is coated on to the FTO/mp-TiO2 and dipped in the FAI solution (formula F1) for 2 min, then removed from the solution; no heating was provided.
For FA1−xMAxPbI3: 1 M PbI2 is coated on to the FTO/mp-TiO2 and dipped in the FAI–MAI solution (formula F3) for 2 min, then removed from the solution; no heating was provided to achieve the α-phase.
For MAPbI3: 1 M PbI2 is coated on to the FTO and dipped in the MAI solution (MAI dissolved in 2-propanol, 8 mg ml−1) for 2 min, then removed from the solution; no heating was provided.
Results and discussion
In general, the optical properties of a given material, especially photoluminescence (PL), indicate its light absorbing and emitting nature. The α-FAPbI3 shows PL emission around 796 nm (for 480 nm excitation) as shown in Fig. 1(a). PL kinetics was tracked by monitoring the PL intensity at 796 nm during the conversion of PbI2 into FAPbI3 (in situ conversion) as shown in Fig. 1(b). From Fig. 1(b), it is evident that the PL intensity reaches its maximum value within approximately the first 2 min of PbI2 dipping. This maximum value of PL intensity continues to stay up to approximately 5 min and then drops to a lower value. The observed PL intensity at various times in the kinetics study is proportional to the corresponding material's volume fraction. Therefore, based on the photoluminescence kinetics study, five different growth durations were chosen to examine the phase evolution: 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes. XRD, SEM and absorption measurements were carried out for the samples under these time durations (dipping time) to understand the formation of different phases for FAPbI3 with time. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature in ambient air (with relative humidity around 50%) unless stated otherwise.

Before attempting the detailed time-dependent crystallization study, FAPbI3, FA1−xMAxPbI3 and MAPbI3 were formed on FTO/TiO2 and FTO by the sequential deposition method (their formation was described in the Perovskite formation for initial assessment section). The XRD for the same is given in Fig. 2(a); various phases were identified in comparison with the films formed on plain glass. From Fig. 2(a), the XRD result for the sequentially deposited FAPbI3 film on glass, which is stored for 3 days, confirms that the majority of the components is the δ-phase. And the diffractogram corresponding to the two-step deposited FAPbI3 confirms the presence of both α and δ phases. The presence of this δ-phase needs careful evaluation with dipping time. The peaks corresponding to TiO2 for FTO/TiO2 substrates are not apparently visible in the diffractograms due to their low intensity. For ease of comparison, XRD for FTO is also recorded and plotted along with other diffractograms in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the XRD patterns for the α-FA1−xMAxPbI3 in comparison with α-FAPbI3 and α-MAPbI3 around 2θ values of 14 and 28 degrees, respectively. The highest intensity peak at 2θ = 14.1° is attributed to (100) of α-MAPbI3. When the smaller cation MA is replaced with the larger cation FA, the peak of the Bragg plane (100) shifts towards a lower diffracting angle, i.e. to 2θ = 13.94 degrees, for α-FAPbI3. When MA and FA are mixed, if these two ions form a composite (with respect to the pristine perovskite structures of MA or FA), then the peak around 2θ = 14 degrees can be deconvoluted into two, one at 13.94 (α-FAPbI3) and the other at 14.1 (MAPbI3). Since the diffractogram of FA1−xMAxPbI3 shows a single peak (confirmed with the single peak fitting as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c)), it can be concluded that the MA was successfully incorporated into FA to form α-FA1−xMAxPbI3. A similar kind of observation can be made from the diffractogram in Fig. 2(c). This observation is in accordance with the previous report.27

Upon obtaining the preliminary information, we proceeded to the time-dependent crystallization process for FAPbI3. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns obtained for PbI2 films dipped into the FAI solution (formula F1) for different durations. At 30 s of dipping time, the XRD pattern indicates the presence of α-FAPbI3 with some unconverted PbI2 and no apparent signature is observed for peaks corresponding to δ-FAPbI3. For 2 min of dipping time, peaks corresponding to both α and δ-FAPbI3 are prominent (peaks at 2θ = 13.94° and 2θ = 11.77°, respectively). For the samples under higher dipping time, the peak height corresponding to δ-FAPbI3 increases at the expense of the peak height of α-FAPbI3. To quantify the volume fraction of the crystalline phases, quantitative analysis using XRD data is carried out. A point worth mentioning here is that for thin films (with few hundred nm thickness) which have the preferred orientation, the conventional Rietveld refinement for the volume fraction estimation may lead to erroneous results. Under such conditions, one can utilize the classical ‘direct comparison method of intensities’ for the quantification of the volume fraction.28 The direct comparison method requires the structure factor values for the Bragg planes under consideration (for each phase). In the present case, we need the structure factor values for the (100) plane of α-FAPbI3, the (100) plane of δ-FAPbI3 and the (001) plane of PbI2. A detailed structure factor calculation is carried out by extracting the crystallographic information (lattice parameters, fractional coordinates, atomic scattering factors, etc.) from the available literature.15,16 Volume fractions are estimated with the help of the following equations28 (1)

The qualitatively observed results from the diffractograms (in Fig. 3(a)) are quantified with the estimation of volume fractions for all the phases that are arising at a given dipping time. From Table 1, at 30 s, about 80.77% of α-FAPbI3 (Cα) is present with residual PbI2 (Cx) of about 19.22% and the δ-FAPbI3 (Cδ) volume fraction is zero. For 2 min of dipping time, the volume fraction for α-FAPbI3 increased to 89.92%. The residual PbI2 volume fraction has decreased to 0.89% with the additional growth of the δ-FAPbI3 phase, which has an observed volume fraction of 9.17%.

At higher dipping times, the volume fraction of δ-FAPbI3 increased at the expense of α-FAPbI3. These observations of the initial α-FAPbI3 formation and subsequent growth of δ-FAPbI3 indicate that the α-FAPbI3 is the kinetically favored product that is formed when PbI2 films are dipped in the FAI solution. The higher volume fraction of δ-FAPbI3 at higher dipping times indicates that the δ-FAPbI3 is the thermodynamically stable phase over the α-FAPbI3. A point worth noting is that for all the phases considered, the volume fraction of each is dependent on three parameters: the intensity of the diffraction peak of the Bragg plane under consideration, the corresponding structure factor and the R factor as understood from eqn (1). For higher dipping durations, even though the intensity of the diffraction peak of the Bragg plane under consideration for the δ-phase is higher than that of the Bragg plane corresponding to the α-phase, the significantly higher values of the structure factor and the R factor for the δ-phase (see the ESI†) lead to its lower volume fraction (as C ∝ 1/R) than the α-phase. The volume fraction of the α and δ phases is plotted against the dipping time as shown in Fig. 3(b), which indicates quantitatively the decay of the α-phase and the growth of the δ-phase. For up to 2 min of dipping, the formation of α-FAPbI3 is dominant. For the first approximation, to estimate the δ-FAPbI3 growth rate, its curve is fitted with the observed volume fraction vs. dipping time data. Fig. 3(c) shows the fitted equation, which turned out to be an exponential form, Cδ ∼ (1 − exp(−k1t)), where the constant k1 is proportional to the growth rate. This is the typical form of an equation for the kinetics of phase change in the case of one dimensional growth given by Melvin Avrami.29 The fitting parameters are given in the ESI† section 2.

In situ time-dependent absorbance measurements were carried out by dipping the PbI2 substrate in a FAI solution and monitoring the change in the absorbance during the transformation from PbI2 to FAPbI3. The absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The crystalline phase α-FAPbI3 has a long absorption range (from far UV to near IR) and, as seen from XRD results, its volume fraction increases up to 2 min of dipping time and then decreases. Therefore, the absorbance should follow the same trend as that of the volume fraction with respect to the dipping time. In Fig. 4, for 2 min of dipping, an overall increase in the absorbance and the appearance of the typical absorption profile for the α-FAPbI3 perovskite are observed with an absorption onset at about 800 nm. A steep rise in the absorbance over the entire visible region indicated the formation of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite. For prolonged dipping beyond 2 min (for in situ scanning), the absorbance starts to decrease gradually proving that the α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase formed is unstable in the FAI solution. With dipping times longer than 40 min, the black films turned completely yellow in colour. This yellow phase is the δ-FAPbI3. This transformation of the black film (at 2 min dipping) into yellow (beyond 40 min dipping) is shown in the ESI† Fig. S1.

Fig. 5 shows the microstructural evolution of PbI2 films to FAPbI3 with different dipping durations in the FAI solution. With 30 s of dipping duration, α-FAPbI3 started to form (Fig. 5(b)), showing a change in the microstructure from pure PbI2 (Fig. 5(a)). It must be noted that, if the volume fraction is less the 3% for a phase, XRD is not sensitive enough to detect but it can be seen from the SEM images if the microstructure of that particular phase is different from that of the matrix. For 30 s of dipping, in Fig. 5(b) at one or two regions, rod-like structures are visible, which means the δ-FAPbI3 started to form which was not detected in XRD. The reason for this might be the very low volume fraction. Fig. 5(c) shows the SEM images after 2 min of transformation and shows a uniform grain size distribution of about 1 μm for α-FAPbI3. A significant amount of rod-like structures is also visible along with α-FAPbI3 grains. With the increase in dipping time initially formed, the micrometer-sized grains become smaller and the rod-like structures grow bigger as shown in Fig. 5(d–f). It is also evident from the microstructures in Fig. 5 that the δ-phase grows (nanorods) at the expense of the α-phase.

Now, from comparison of the SEM images in conjunction with XRD results, the observed PL kinetics (Fig. 1(b)) can be justified. The initial increase in the PL intensity is due to the formation of larger grained α-FAPbI3 perovskite crystals, resulting in the increase in the PL intensity. With the increase in the dipping time, the α-FAPbI3 formed converted to δ-FAPbI3 as verified from the XRD data, because of which the PL at 796 nm started to decay. With the longer dipping times, the conversion of the α-phase to the δ-phase resulted in a stationary value of PL. On visible inspection, the δ-phase is initially not prominent since the black colour of the α-phase dominates the yellow appearance of the δ-phase. At the end of the experiment, the completely converted yellow (δ-phase) substrate is collected from the longer dipping time (beyond 40 min) and heated to 150 °C for 10 minutes. Upon heating, a complete conversion of the yellow (δ-phase) phase into the black α-phase is observed as shown in Fig. S2(a),† which is supported by the XRD studies shown in Fig. S2(b).† The absorption spectrum for the 150 °C heated sample is incorporated in Fig. 4.
An antisolvent crystallization approach was used previously to obtain 0D (quantum dots or QDs), 1-D (nanorods, nanobelts and nanowires) and 2-D (nanosheets) CH3NH3PbX3-based perovskites.30,31 This antisolvent crystallization approach was also used to obtain films of 3D hybrid perovskites and shown to improve the photovoltaic performance of hybrid solar cells.32,33 To understand the growth mechanism and the role of the antisolvents on the crystallization of the most favourable FAPbI3 phase at room temperature, the crystallization kinetics studies were carried out by using an anti-solvent crystallization method. The anti-solvent effect of toluene was previously reported in the literature for morphology control of MAPbI3 perovskites.34 Here, we used two kinds of non-polar solvents, toluene and chlorobenzene, as anti-solvents for the crystallization. The results with toluene are discussed here, and similar results were observed with chlorobenzene, which are shown in the ESI† Fig. S3. The dipping solution formulation considered for the anti-solvent crystallization study is F2. Time-dependent XRD and microstructural evolution of FAPbI3 were carried out with the addition of an anti-solvent.

Fig. 6 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 6(a)) obtained with the different dipping durations for the transformation of PbI2 into FAPbI3 using toluene as an anti-solvent (formula, F2). In the XRD pattern, the peak corresponding to the δ-phase is visible even for 30 s of dipping time along with the peaks corresponding to the α-phase, as shown in Fig. 6(a). With the increase in the dipping time, both the α-phase and the δ-phase started to increase, which is similar to the formula F1 case. For the formula F2, from the XRD results, the volume fractions for various phases with respect to the dipping time are estimated and given in Table 1. From Table 1, for formula F2, one can see the low volume fraction values of the δ-phase up to 10 min of dipping compared with the formula F1 case. But, for higher dipping time, the δ-phase increases at the expense of the α-phase. For formula F2, the trend in the volume fraction with the dipping time for the α and δ phases is shown in Fig. 6(b). The equation fitted with the volume fraction vs. dipping time for the antisolvent method also shows the form of Cδ ∼ (1 − exp(−k2t)), where K2 is the proportionality growth rate constant (Fig. 6(c)). The K2 value is 0.016 (F2), which is 3.68 times smaller than K1 (0.059, F1). The smaller value of K2 indicates the slow growth rate of the δ-phase. But, at the higher dipping times (for 20 min and 40 min), the volume fraction of the δ-phase is higher for formula F2 than that of formula F1. Fig. 7(a–e) show the SEM images for the antisolvent study showing 1D growth of nanorods, in support of the observed XRD results as discussed.

The presence of the δ-phase at room temperature is unavoidable due to its high entropy over the α-phase during FAPbI3 formation.16,34 Recently, to obtain the α-phase, an alternative method was reported i.e. to mix FAPbI3 with other cations by replacing a fraction of FA with smaller MA or Cs ions.27,35,36 First-principles calculations show that α-phase stabilization is achieved remarkably with entropic gain and smaller internal energy inputs for the formation of a perovskite solid solution containing FA and Cs ions.34 In a similar way, mixing FA with smaller MA ions (15 wt%) is expected to form an α-perovskite solid solution.36 The solid solution of α-FA1−xMAxPbI3 needs to be tested for its stability under growth conditions. To evaluate the effect of MA ions on α-phase stabilization, a rigorous time-dependent crystallization study as described for the solvent and antisolvent method is helpful. The PbI2 coated samples were dipped in the FAI + MAI solution (formula, F3) for prolonged time up to 40 min. The conversion of PbI2 to the perovskite phase was achieved, avoiding the δ-phase as confirmed from the XRD results shown in Fig. 8. It was found that residual PbI2 exists even up to 40 min of dipping time. The residual PbI2 may be beneficial for the increment in the power conversion efficiencies as reported previously.37–39

These structural analysis results by XRD (Fig. 8) are also supported by the microstructure evolution studies by SEM as shown in Fig. 9(a–e) for different dipping times. On examining the microstructures, it is clear that the grain structure of the samples up to 10 min of dipping time is almost similar for all with a typical grain size distribution of about 1–2 μm and for 20 min of dipping time, the microstructure transformed into very fine grains. For 40 min of dipping time, the grain structure is further modified, forming segregated larger crystals with poor coverage. For all samples from 30 s to 20 min of dipping time, the film coverage is uniform. To further evaluate the stability of the α-FA1−xMAxPbI3 (x = 0.15) phase, time-dependent absorbance studies are carried out by dipping PbI2 coated substrates in the FAI + MAI in 2-propanol solution (formula, F3). Fig. 9(f) shows the absorption spectra obtained with different dipping durations. In contrast to the earlier seen absorbance results with the pure FAI solution where absorbance decreases with dipping time (Fig. 4), here with the addition of 15 wt% MAI the absorbance does not change significantly over a long period of time, indicating the stability of the light absorbing α-phase of FA1−xMAxPbI3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the incorporation of MA into the FAPbI3 lattice can effectively form the light harvesting α-phase of FA1−xMAxPbI3 perovskite and also additionally has the ability to alter the grain size of the resulting material.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have studied the crystallization kinetics of the FAPbI3 perovskite using a two-step sequential deposition procedure of dipping the PbI2 films into an FAI solution. At room temperature, FAPbI3 exhibits polymorphism and shows the presence of two phases, α and δ-FAPbI3. We found experimentally that the phase composition and morphology of solvent engineered perovskite films are strongly dependent on the solvent and processing time. It is confirmed from the solvent and anti-solvent crystallization study that the α-phase is kinetically favored whereas the δ-phase is thermodynamically favored and the growth of the δ-phase is found to increase at the expense of the α-phase, as confirmed from the detailed volume fraction analysis. The antisolvent toluene has moderate control over δ-phase formation. The stabilization of α-perovskite is obtained by mixing FA with MA, forming a solid solution of FA1−xMAxPbI3, and the stabilization of α- FA1−xMAxPbI3 is confirmed by the crystallization kinetics study.
