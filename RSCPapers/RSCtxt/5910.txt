    , Accepted 8th May 2015First published on 11th May 2015AbstractA series of perylene diimide (PDI) dimers (PnTP, n = 0–3) with oligothiophenes as bridges were designed, theoretically calculated, synthesized, and developed as electron acceptors for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The effects of oligothiophene bridge length on the absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the molecules were investigated. These molecules exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 367–413 °C, broad and strong absorption in the visible region (400–700 nm), and appropriate HOMO (−5.74 to −5.61 eV) and LUMO (−3.84 to −3.72 eV) energy levels. When blending these PDI acceptors with a low bandgap polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T, the PSCs exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 0.76–3.61%.
Introduction
Solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ)1 polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to some advantages, such as low cost, light weight, flexibility and large area fabrication.2–6 Nowadays, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been achieved for PSCs based on blends of narrow bandgap polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.7–14 The development of novel electron acceptors has lagged behind relative to the rapid development of new electron donor materials.15 Fullerenes and their derivatives have been the dominant electron acceptors in BHJ PSCs, because of their high electron affinity and electron mobility, isotropy of charge transport, and good ability to form favorable nanoscale networks with donor materials.16,17 However, there remain incentives to develop novel electron acceptors which will not only maintain the favorable properties of fullerenes, but also overcome their deficiencies, such as narrow and weak absorption in the visible region, and limited energy level variability.18,19
During the past years, considerable efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of fullerene-free acceptors for PSCs,19–22 and introducing electron-withdrawing building blocks, such as cyano,23–25 imide,26–31 amide,32–34 thiadiazole,35–37 and other units38,39 was a popular strategy for adjusting the properties of electron acceptors. So far, the PCEs of fullerene-free PSCs have exceeded 6%;40–44 the highest PCE of non-fullerene PSCs even reached 6.8%.45 Rylene diimides, such as perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI), have been widely used as building blocks in fullerene-free acceptors,46–59 due to their good thermal, chemical and light stabilities, strong electron-accepting abilities and high electron mobilities. When blending with narrow bandgap polymer donors, rylene diimides-based acceptors showed PCEs up to 6%,40–43 which are close to those of fullerene-based PSCs. However, the parent rylene diimides possess high planarity and strong intermolecular interaction, and form large crystalline domains (typically micrometer scale) and result in large scale phase separation in BHJ films, leading to reduced exciton diffusion/separation efficiencies and finally to low PCEs of the PSCs.60 Therefore, one of the design principles for rylene diimides-based electron acceptors is restricting the crystallinity without adversely weakening the charge transport properties of rylene diimides.40,48,61,62
In this paper, we designed, theoretically calculated and synthesized a series of PDI dimers (PnTP, n = 0–3, Scheme 1) with oligothiophenes as bridges. The steric hindrance twisted the molecular structure of the PDI dimers with dihedral angles >50°. We investigated the effects of oligothiophene bridge length on the absorption, energy level, charge transport, morphology and photovoltaic properties of the molecules.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
PDI molecules were synthesized by simple and facile reactions (Scheme 1). The known intermediates N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)-1-bromo-7-(n-butoxyl)-3,4:9,10-perylene diimide (PDI-Br), 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene, 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene and 5,5′′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene(oligothiophene-2Sn) were synthesized according to the literature procedures.63,64 The new compounds PnTP (n = 1–3) were synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction between PDI-Br and oligothiophene-2Sn using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Meanwhile, P0TP was synthesized via the Cu-catalyzed Ullmann reaction. All compounds were fully characterized by MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. These molecules are readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature, owing to solubilizing alkyl substituents. The thermal properties of these compounds were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These PDI dimers exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 367–413 °C in nitrogen (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized spectra of optical absorption of these PDI dimers in dichloromethane solution (10−6 M) are shown in Fig. 2. Compounds P(0–3)TP in solution exhibited absorption maxima at 538–570 nm (Fig. 2a, Table 1), and with increase in the number of thiophene units and the π-conjugation length of the molecule, the absorption spectra in solution red shifted slightly and the maximum extinction coefficients increased from 5.3 to 6.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In thin films, P(0–3)TP exhibited broad absorption spectra from 450 to 700 nm (Fig. 2b), and the optical band gaps of these molecules estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film were 1.80 to 1.92 eV (Table 1).

The electrochemical property of P(0–3)TP was investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with films on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3a, these molecules exhibited irreversible reduction waves and oxidation waves. The HOMO and LUMO energies (Fig. 3b, Table 1) were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum65 (the oxidation potential of FeCp2+/0versus Ag/AgCl was measured to be 0.46 V). Compound P0TP showed the lowest energy levels with HOMO of −5.74 eV and LUMO of −3.84 eV. Increase in thiophene number up-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which can be attributed to the electron-donating property of the oligothiophene unit. The HOMO and LUMO energies of P(0–3)TP were obviously lower than those of the classical low bandgap polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T (LUMO/HOMO: −3.25/−5.11 eV);66 the LUMO gaps (0.47 to 0.59 eV) and HOMO gaps (0.50 to 0.63 eV) between the polymer donor and PDI acceptors were large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation.67 The difference between the HOMO level of PBDTTT-C-T and the LUMO of these acceptors was as large as 1.27–1.39 eV, which could lead to a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells.68

The photoluminescence spectra of PBDTTT-C-T and P(0–3)TP in neat and blended films are shown in Fig. 4. PBDTTT-C-T and P(0–3)TP neat films exhibited strong fluorescence, while PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP (1:1, w/w) blended films showed over 90% and 75% of fluorescence quenching compared to PBDTTT-C-T (Fig. 4a) and P(0–3)TP (Fig. 4b) neat films, respectively. Strong fluorescence quenching indicated effective photoinduced charge transfer between the PBDTTT-C-T donor and P(0–3)TP acceptors.

Theoretical calculation
To provide an insight into the molecular architecture of these molecules, molecular simulation was carried out for P(0–3)TP on molecular geometries with the density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian program at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Fig. 5 shows the optimal geometries and LUMO and HOMO distribution of these molecules. The dihedral angles between PDI planes (P0TP) or PDI/oligothiophene (P(1–3)TP) in these molecules are listed in Table 2. These molecules exhibited a twisted structure due to the steric hindrance. P0TP exhibited a dihedral angle of 62.7°, while P(1–3)TP showed smaller dihedral angles of 50.7–52.3°. The twisted molecular structure could restrict aggregation among the PDI molecules and facilitate exciton diffusion/separation. For P0TP, LUMO and HOMO were delocalized on the whole molecule; for P(1–3)TP, LUMO was concentrated onto the electron-accepting PDI units and HOMO was mainly distributed on the electron-donating oligothiophene units. It is expected that the large electron-accepting area as well as the strong electron-accepting ability of the PDI unit on the outer and sterically exposed space will be beneficial to charge transport.39

Mobilities
The hole and electron mobilities of the blended films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Au for holes (Fig. 6a) and Al/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Al for electrons (Fig. 6b). In blend films, the hole and electron mobilities varied from 10−6 to 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 10−6 to 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 3). Among these blended films, the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend exhibited the highest hole and electron mobilities of 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Because P0TP exhibited the largest dihedral angle and steric hindrance among the four PDI dimers, which led to poor π–π stacking, the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend showed the lowest electron mobility. Oligothiophene-bridged PDI dimers possessed smaller dihedral angles, and PBDTTT-C-T:P(1–3)TP blend films exhibited higher electron mobilities. The high charge carrier mobility and balanced charge transport were beneficial to better device performance.

Photovoltaic properties
We used PBDTTT-C-T as the donor and P(0–3)TP as acceptors to fabricate BHJ PSCs with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Ca/Al. Table 4 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices at different donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios. Devices based on the PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP blend at a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 gave the best performance. Based on the optimal D/A ratio of 1:1, the effect of the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) content on the device performance was investigated. For P0TP, the devices based on PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP with 3% DIO gave the best performance: VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 2.11 mA cm−2, FF of 0.427 and PCE of 0.76%. Compared to P0TP, PDI dimers with the oligothiophene bridge gave better performance due to broader absorption and higher electron mobilities. The devices based on PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP with 3% DIO gave the best performance among these molecules: VOC of 0.89 V, JSC of 7.78 mA cm−2, FF of 0.521 and PCE of 3.61%, owing to the highest hole and electron mobilities of all the molecules. With increase in the number of thiophene units, the PDI dimers showed poorer performance: VOC of 0.83 V, JSC of 3.05 mA cm−2, FF of 0.313, PCE of 0.79% for P2TP, and VOC of 0.77 V, JSC of 3.38 mA cm−2, FF of 0.350, PCE of 0.91% for P3TP (Fig. 7a), which was caused by the decrease of hole and electron mobilities. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP blended films with DIO are shown in Fig. 7b. The JSC values of the best devices were calculated from integration of IPCE spectra to evaluate the accuracy of photovoltaic results (Table 4). The PSCs showed broad IPCE spectra from 350 to 750 nm, suggesting that both the donor and acceptor contributed to IPCE and JSC. The trend of IPCE was similar to that of JSC; PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blended film exhibited the highest IPCE.

Blend film morphology
The BHJ active layer morphology was examined by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique in tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM height and phase images of PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP (1:1, w/w) blended films are shown in Fig. 8. PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend film exhibited a rough morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 11.8 nm, while PBDTTT-C-T:P(1–3)TP blend films showed relatively smooth and uniform morphology with RMS roughness of 5.85 nm, 2.40 nm, and 1.43 nm, respectively. Suitable crystalline domains and phase separation of the blend film were beneficial to achieving a high JSC and PCE. The AFM height and phase section curves (Fig. 9) show that large aggregation domains (around 100 nm) were formed and large phase separation occurred in the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend film, suggesting poor miscibility between the donor and acceptor. Phase separation as large as hundreds of nanometers reduced exciton diffusion/separation efficiencies and finally led to low PCEs. As for PBDTTT-C-T:P2TP and PBDTTT-C-T:P3TP blend films, smooth morphology and small aggregation domains (around 10 nm) were observed, suggesting good miscibility between the donor and acceptor, which was beneficial to exciton diffusion/separation but not favorable for charge transport and finally led to low mobilities and low PCEs.69,70 In the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film, suitable aggregation domains (tens of nanometers) and phase separation facilitated both exciton diffusion/separation and charge transport, thus the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film exhibited the highest hole and electron mobilities and the best device performance. TEM images of PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP (1:1, w/w) blend films (Fig. 10) were consistent with AFM results. In the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend film, large aggregation domains (around 100 nm) were observed, while in PBDTTT-C-T:P2TP and PBDTTT-C-T:P3TP blend films, the domain size was much smaller (around 10 nm). In particular, favorable interpenetrating networks with a suitable phase separation scale were observed in the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film, which was beneficial to high performance.

Conclusions
We have designed, theoretically calculated and synthesized a series of oligothiophene-bridged PDI dimers (PnTP, n = 0–3). The steric hindrance twisted the molecular structure with >50° dihedral angle. With increasing number of thiophene units and the π-conjugation length of the molecule, the absorption spectra red shifted slightly and the maximum extinction coefficients increased. Due to the electron-donating property of the thiophene unit, increase in thiophene number up-shifted HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The morphology of PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP blend films affected the device performance directly. Rough morphology with large crystalline domains and phase separation was beneficial to charge transport, while smooth morphology with small crystalline domains promoted exciton diffusion/separation. In the PBDTTT-C-T:P0TP blend film, an ordered structure caused by π–π stacking can hardly form among P0TP molecules due to the highly twisted molecular structure, thus large crystalline domains formed with PBDTTT-C-T and large scale phase separation promoted hole transport but restricted electron transport. On introduction of the oligothiophene bridge, the dihedral angles were reduced, the molecules had a more planar structure and better miscibility with the polymer donor, which led to smoother morphology in blend films. In PBDTTT-C-T:P(2–3)TP blend films, the small aggregation domains and phase separation led to low mobilities and PCEs. As for the PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP blend film, appropriate crystalline domains and phase separation were beneficial to both charge transport and exciton diffusion/separation. As a result, the PSCs based on a blend of PBDTTT-C-T and P1TP showed a PCE as high as 3.61%, owing to the highest hole and electron mobilities among the blends studied.
Experimental section
Molecular modelling
Computational details are presented as follows: density functional theory calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program,71 using the B3LYP functional.72,73 All-electron double-ξ valence basis sets with polarization functions 6-31G* were used for all atoms.74 Geometry optimizations were performed with full relaxation of all atoms in the gas phase without solvent effects. Vibration frequency calculation was performed to check that the stable structures had no imaginary frequency. Charge distribution of the molecules was calculated by Mulliken population analysis.

Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 300 MHz or 400 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF Analyzer using MALDI mode. Elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Solution (dichloromethene) and thin film (on a quartz substrate) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen on a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in CH3CN using a computer-controlled CHI660C electrochemical workstation, a glassy-carbon working electrode coated with the sample film, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. Potentials were referenced to a ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0) couple by using ferrocene as an internal standard. Photoluminescence spectra were measured for PBDTTT-C-T and P(0–3)TP neat films and PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP (1:1, w/w) blended films (spin-coated on a quartz substrate) by using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The nanoscale morphology of the blend film was observed by using a Veeco Nanoscopy V atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode. TEM measurements were performed on a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
Polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Ca/Al. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 10 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. An o-DCB solution of PBDTTT-C-T:PnTP (n = 0, 1, 3) or a chloroform solution of PBDTTT-C-T:P2TP was subsequently spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 110 nm). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. Calcium (ca. 15 nm) and aluminium (ca. 50 nm) layers were subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit (Agilent Technologies). An XES-70S1 (SAN-EI ELECTRIC Co., Ltd) solar simulator (AAA grade, 70 × 70 mm2 photobeam size) coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. A 2 × 2 cm2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-1000-TC-QZ) was purchased from VLSI Standards Inc. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell.
Mobility measurements
Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Au for holes and Al/PBDTTT-C-T:P(0–3)TP/Al for electrons. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.75 The J–V curves of the devices were plotted as J0.5versus V using the equation J = 9ε0εrμh(μe)V2/8d3 for holes and electrons, where J is the current density, d is the film thickness of the active layer, μh is the hole mobility, μe is the electron mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes (for hole-only diodes, Vbi is 0.2 V; for electron-only diodes, Vbi is 0 V).
