    , Accepted 1st September 2022First published on 1st September 2022AbstractCharging electrochemical devices by light irradiation may bring an essential change in energy-storage technologies. Herein, nickel copper mixed oxide (NiCuOx)-based bifunctional photoelectrodes for integrated energy conversion and storage were developed to achieve significant capacitance enhancements by a photocharging process. NiCuOx nanosheets have been directly grown on carbon cloth (CC) by a simple electrodeposition/annealing method. NiO/CuOx heterojunctions have been formed in the CC@NiCuOx nanosheet structures, which presented an intimate interfacial contact, endowing the materials with bifunctional properties for realizing photoenergy conversion and electrochemical charge storage simultaneously. When used as three-electrode supercapacitors, the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx photoelectrodes demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance of 2937 mF cm−2 under light irradiation, corresponding to 17.5% of enhancement compared to those delivered without light irradiation. Such a significant enhancement could be contributed by the in situ photocharging process, where the photo-generated holes from CuOx (including CuO and Cu2O) were transferred to neighboring NiO and then promoted the oxidation reactions of NiO. This work has provided a tentative study to show how photo-generated charge carriers can promote electrochemical charge storage.
1. Introduction
Solar energy has received intensive scientific and technological attention because of its green, sustainable, and environment-friendly nature.1 Solar cells are one of the most important energy devices that convert solar energy to electricity using photosensitive semiconductors.2,3 Since 1954, a great many of research studies have been reported to advance solar cells, from silicon-based devices to perovskite solar cells.4–8 Unfortunately, a major issue in the present solar cells is that the power output is highly influenced by the irradiation intensity as well as variable weather conditions, leading to unstable electricity generation. Thus, it is significant to connect solar cells to energy storage devices for efficient and timely charge storage. In recent years, some energy storage devices, such as lithium ion batteries (LIBs)9–11 and supercapacitors (SCs)12–14 have been employed and developed to match up solar cells to store photoenergy for later utilization, which has largely alleviated power fluctuations caused by variable weather conditions.
A simple and direct connection of solar cells to battery cells may indeed actualize the co-work of the two devices for energy conversion and storage; however, it still results in many practical challenges, such as high cost, low energy efficiencies, and limitation of miniaturization.15–17 To address these issues, great efforts have been made to integrate solar cells and battery cells into a single unit for developing highly efficient, light-weight and portable devices.18–20 For example, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were integrated with LIBs to assemble a power pack using double-sided TiO2 nanotube arrays.21 Similarly, bi-polar TiO2 nanotube arrays were built in thin films to obtain stack-integrated photo-supercapacitors composed of DSSCs and SCs, which exhibited 5.1 times-enhanced areal capacity with an overall photoelectric conversion and storage efficiency up to 1.64%.22 Recently, a two-electrode photo-rechargeable LIB was reported by using LiFePO4 nanocrystals as the cathode, which undergoes direct photo-oxidation in the presence of a dye, and Li metal as the anode; de-lithiation of LiFePO4 to FePO4 was promoted by holes generated in the photoexcited dye.23 However, one remaining common problem is that the reported systems are still composed of two different separated parts, which work for energy conversion and storage independently, leading to sluggish separation and migration of charge carriers. In addition, those two functional parts use different electrodes or electrolytes, which gives rise to great difficulties in sealing and packing for large-scale manufacturing. Thus, it is extremely demanded to develop a highly integrated system to address this critical issue. Recently, Liu et al. described a LiF-rich interface toward long-life lithium metal batteries,24 giving us more confidence to develop different types of energy storage devices associated with solar energy.
Nickel oxide (NiO) is an important pseudocapacitive electrode material due to its low cost, high electroactivity, and good chemical stability.25–28 Meanwhile, copper oxides (CuO, Cu2O) are typical p-type semiconductors, which have been considered promising candidates for both energy storage and conversion applications because of their good photoelectric properties, high electronic conductivity, and nontoxic nature.29–32 It is anticipated that an optimized combination of NiO and CuOx (including CuO and Cu2O) can delicately realize photo-assisted pseudocapacitive charge storage in one integrated composite electrode. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, NiCuOx nanosheets grown on carbon fibers of CC have been rationally constructed to integrate photoelectric conversion and charge storage in a single photoelectrode. The conductive CC was used as a flexible substrate for the electrodeposition of Cu–Ni layered double hydroxides (LDH), which were then transformed into mixed metal oxides (NiCuOx) through a simple heat treatment in air. The as-formed NiO and CuO components in the NiCuOx mixed electrode have shared a lattice-scale contact, which could facilitate charge separation and migration during charging in the presence of light irradiation. When used as photoelectrode materials for three-electrode supercapacitors, such an NiCuOx-based electrode can co-operate for charge storage and conversion simultaneously, where the photoinduced electrons of CuOx can be easily passed to neighboring NiO, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of NiO. The left photogenerated holes were probably accumulated in the valence bands of CuO/Cu2O, which is favorable for oxidation kinetics of the neighboring NiO during a charging process, thereby promoting the pseudocapacitive charge storage of NiO. As a result, the as-prepared NiCuOx photoelectrode demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 2937 mF cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 under light irradiation, delivering a 17.5% enhancement compared to the value obtained without light. In addition, an excellent capacitance retention (∼100%) can be achieved after 5000 cycles upon light irradiation compared to the electrode without light irradiation (99%), which shows the good stability of the as-prepared NiCuOx photoelectrode materials under light.
2. Experimental section
All the solvents and chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade and used without any purification. Prior to the electrodeposition, the commercial carbon fiber cloth substrates (WOS1009, Cetech Co., Ltd.) were cut into 3 × 3 cm2 and cleaned ultrasonically with deionized (DI) water and ethanol for 30 min. Then the cleaned CC substrates were treated with concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) by a gradient heating method to make the CC surface hydrophilic.
2.1 Synthesis of CC@Ni–Cu LDH nanosheets
The CC@Ni–Cu LDH nanosheets were prepared by a facile electrodeposition/calcination method. In a typical process, a mixed solution of 50 mL DI water and 50 mL ethanol containing 1 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was used as the electrolyte. The electrodeposition was performed in a standard three-electrode system at room temperature (RT). Then the CC, platinum foil and saturated calomel electrodes (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. The electrodeposition process was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) within a voltage window from −1.2–0.2 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 for 6 cycles,33 using an electrochemical workstation (IVIUM, V38120). The obtained samples were cleaned with DI water and ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C in an air-flow oven overnight. For control samples, CC@Cu(OH)2 was prepared by the same CV method using 5 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, while CC@Ni(OH)2 was prepared by potentiostatic electrodeposition at −1.0 V for 360 s using 5 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O.
2.2 Synthesis of CC@NiCuOx nanosheets
The dried films of CC@Ni–Cu LDH nanosheets were heated to 300 °C (heating rate at 5 °C min−1) and kept at the temperature for another 2 h in a muffle furnace to obtain CC@NiCuOx nanosheets. Meanwhile, the control samples (CC@CuOx and CC@NiO) were also prepared following the same annealing process using CC@Cu(OH)2 and CC@Ni(OH)2 as precursors, respectively.
2.3 Materials characterization
The crystalline structures of the obtained samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2500, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154 nm). The surface chemical compositions and states were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha ESCALAB 250XI) with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486 eV). The morphologies were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta FEG 250) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Titan G2 60-300) equipped with a mapping system. An ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS, Thermo Escalab 250Xi) was employed to detect the energy levels of the materials. Room-temperature electronic spin resonance (ESR) spectra were measured using an ESR spectrometer (Bruker A300) at 300 K. The frequency of microwave used is 9.853 GHz with a power of 2 mW. The magnetic center field is 3515.45 G with a sweep width of 200 G. The module amplitude is 4 G with a sweep time of 40.96 s.
2.4 Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated using an electrochemical workstation (IVIUM, V38120). The as-prepared CC@NiCuOx materials (1 × 1.5 cm2) were directly used as working electrodes in a 2 M KOH aqueous solution. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum foil (1 × 1 cm) were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCCD) tests were carried out at different scan rates and current densities. The specific capacitances were calculated from the discharge curve according to the following equation:  where C (F cm−2) is the specific areal capacitance, I (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, A (cm2) is the area of the electrode, and ΔV is the discharge voltage window.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in a sealed quartz glass cell. The three-electrode electrochemical system and the electrolyte remained unchanged. A 300 W xenon arc lamp (Perfect Light PLS-SXE300) was used as the light source (light power = 50 W; spotlight radius = 30 mm). At the same time, circulating cooling water was used to keep the temperature of the test cell at 18 °C to exclude the photothermal effects. All the photo-enhancement measurements, including CV and GCCD, were conducted using the chopped mode of light irradiation. The photocurrent measurements were carried out under the conditions of open-circuit, 0.1 V bias, and 1 mV s−1 of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, −0.3–0.4 V) in the chopped light irradiation mode, respectively. All the potentials mentioned in the text and figure captions throughout the manuscript are versus SCE if there is no specific instruction.
2.5 Theoretical calculations
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials with an exchange–correlation functional of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formulation that was implemented in VASP.34,35 An energy cutoff of 520 eV was adopted for CuO and NiO primitive cells. A vacuum layer with a thickness of 12 Å was adopted for the surface slabs to avoid unwanted interactions between neighboring mirrors. After construction, the CuO (010) surface slab contains 32 Cu and 32 O atoms with a size of 20.56 × 5.88 × 16.41 Å3; the NiO (110) surface slab consists of 30 Ni and 30 O atoms with a size of 21.13 × 5.98 × 14.99 Å3. The CuO/NiO heterostructure contains 32 Cu, 30 Ni and 62 O atoms, respectively, with a size of 20.85 × 5.93 × 22.15 Å3. For surface slab and CuO/NiO heterostructure calculations, an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used. The k-point sampling was obtained using a Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 6 × 6 × 6 mesh for the NiO primitive cell, 6 × 6 × 5 mesh for the CuO primitive cell, and a 1 × 3 × 1 mesh for the surface slabs and CuO/NiO heterostructure, respectively.
The convergence criteria for self-consistent field (SCF) iteration and force were set to 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom and 0.01 eV Å−1 for the primitive cell, 1.0 × 10−4 eV per atom and 0.03 eV Å−1 for surface slabs, and 1.0 × 10−4 eV per atom and 0.05 eV Å−1 for the CuO/NiO heterostructure, respectively. During the surface calculations, dipole correction was adopted along the z-axis and van der Waals interactions were considered using the DFT-D method. The drawing of the calculated data was performed using VESTA.36 Some pre- and post-treatment processes were carried out with the assistance of VASPKIT.37
3. Results and discussion
To illustrate the photo-assisted pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism in the NiCuOx composite photoelectrode, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed and are presented in Fig. 1. The electronic density of states (DOS) plot of bulk NiO (Fig. 1a) shows a calculated bandgap (Eg) of ca. 2.47 eV, indicating its semiconductive character with a lower Eg than that of the experimental value (∼3.7 eV). The underestimation of Eg has been commonly observed in many transition metal oxides by a semiempirical DFT method mainly due to the overly delocalized d electrons. In comparison, the Eg comes across the energy band in the CuO due to its even smaller Eg value (∼1.7 eV experimentally). Nonetheless, the DFT simulation results suggest that the CuO has a smaller Eg and thus higher electronic conductivity than that of NiO. After forming a heterojunction, the DOS of the resulting NiCuOx still has its Eg crossing the energy band, indicating improved electron transport in this NiCuOx composite. The interfacial characteristics of forming a possible NiO/CuO heterojunction were estimated subsequently. The work function (Wf) of selected NiO (110) and CuO (010) crystal slabs was then calculated (Fig. S1a and b†). The two surfaces possess a calculated Wf of 4.7 eV for NiO (110) and 6.3 eV for CuO (010), respectively (Fig. 1b). Thus, it is anticipated that when a heterointerface is constructed between NiO (110) and CuO (010), a spontaneous electron flow from NiO towards CuO occurs until their respective Fermi levels (EF) are aligned. As a result, a self-building electric field pointing from NiO to CuO will be created as further revealed by the optimized heterostructure with the formation of new chemical bonds at interfaces and charge density difference contours (Fig. S1c†). Upon light irradiation, the photoinduced electrons in CuO can travel through NiO with the assistance of the interfacial electric field to enhance the electronic conductivity of the NiO electrode, and then transport to an external electric circuit under the applied potential. The left photoinduced holes are accumulated at the CuO/NiO interfaces or in the vicinity of NiO, thus promoting the oxidation kinetics of NiO for an additional charge transfer. Thus, an increased pseudocapacitive charge storage capability can be expected by the in situ photocharging in this NiCuOx composite photoelectrode.

The fabrication process of the CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode materials is displayed in Fig. 2a, where HNO3-treated CC was first used as a flexible substrate for the growth of Cu–Ni LDH nanostructures. Through a subsequent electrodeposition process, Cu–Ni LDH nanosheets were uniformly deposited against the hydrophilic carbon fibers of the CC backbone. Finally, the as-formed Cu–Ni LDH was converted into NiCuOx with the nanosheet structure well retained, generating a highly conductive photoelectrode material. The overall structure of CC@NiCuOx was examined by SEM, in which one-dimensional (1D) fibers encapsulated by uniform nanosheets are clearly observed (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c is a magnified SEM image that shows the structural details of nanosheets, and an average thickness of individual nanosheet can be determined to be ∼250 nm. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) results were also collected to obtain the lattice information of this material. The lattice distances of 0.237 and 0.205 nm can be attributed to CuO (111)38 and NiO (200),39 respectively, probably forming a NiO–CuO heterojunction in the nanosheets (Fig. 2d).

In addition, the lattice structures of the two components have shown an intimate interface, thus ensuring instantaneous transfer of charge carriers. To confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ni and Cu species, TEM elemental mapping of a single nanosheet was conducted, as shown in Fig. 2e–h. It can be seen from the results that the Ni, Cu, and O elements are highly overlapped and uniformly distributed on the nanosheet, again validating the homogeneous mixing of NiO and CuO. The relevant EDS results (Fig. S2†) have revealed that the atomic ratios of Ni, Cu and O are 11.8%, 6.86%, and 25.47%, respectively. The homogenous mixing of the Ni and Cu may render an opportunity for more convenient transfer of charge carriers, which is significant to the in situ photocharging process. As a comparison, SEM images of CC@CuOx and CC@NiO were collected and displayed, where detailed structures of thickened particles (Fig. S3†) and cracked screws (Fig. S4†) were seen for CC@CuOx and CC@NiO, respectively.
To examine the crystalline phase and chemical states, XRD and XPS measurements were carried out, respectively, and the results are exhibited in Fig. 3. The identified XRD peaks in Fig. 3a can be assigned to a mixed phase of NiO (PDF no. 71-1179)40 and monoclinic CuO (PDF no. 80-0076). The broad XRD peak located at ∼25° can be attributed to the presence of the CC substrate.41 The crystalline phases of single-components electrodes CC@CuOx and CC@NiO were also examined and compared. The XRD peaks of CuOx shown in Fig. S5a† can be assigned to mixed phases of Cu2O (PDF 05-0667) and Cu (PDF 04-0836), while peaks of CC@NiO shown in Fig. S5b† can be assigned to NiO (PDF 47-1049). Fig. 3b shows the XPS results of Ni 2p, where the split peaks located at 854.5 and 872.4 eV correspond to Ni2+, while peaks at 856.1 and 874.3 eV can be attributed to the presence of Ni3+.42 For the Cu 2p, peaks located at 932.5 and 952.4 eV can be assigned to Cu+, while peaks at 934.1 and 954 eV can be attributed to Cu2+ (Fig. 3c).43,44 It should be noted that no XRD peaks can be distinguished for Ni-III or Cu-I based oxides, which may be due to their low ratios in the phase. However, the co-existence of O− and O2− in the O 1s spectra (Fig. 3d) has indicated the multiple states of Ni and Cu in the as-prepared MMO. In addition, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to study the density of states below the Fermi level (EF) of the CC@NiCuOx, CC@CuOx and CC@NiO, respectively. The energetic gaps between the EF and the valence band (VB) can be determined to be 1.6, 0.63, and 0.8 eV for CC@NiO, CC@CuOx and CC@NiCuOx, respectively (Fig. S6†). These UPS results have shown that the introduction of Cu species into NiO can reduce the band gap of NiO, leading to more efficient charge separation and migration of the photoelectrodes under light activation.

The heat treatment process of CC@Ni–Cu LDH at 300 °C in air for 2 h has induced the formation of oxygen vacancies (VO), and part of the VO can be preserved within the sample after the LDH was converted into mixed oxides. ESR tests were then carried out for all three samples to detect the VO. The obtained ESR results (Fig. S7†) have shown the existence of VO in all three samples with g values of 2.0. In addition, both CC@NiCuOx and CC@CuOx samples exhibit much higher ESR signals than that of CC@NiO, suggesting that the introduction of copper species into NiO may bring more VO within the lattices. It has been proposed that the presence of VO is related to the formation of defect levels, which can facilitate charge transfer among the energy levels.45
Before the measurements of pseudocapacitive performances, photoelectric properties of the CC@NiCuOx electrode are evaluated, as displayed in Fig. 4. The light-on/off LSV curve was obtained in a potential window of −0.3–0.4 V with a switching time interval of 20 s (Fig. 4a). An instant current increase can be clearly observed upon light irradiation, indicating a high photoactivity of the CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode. In addition, higher current enhancements can be obtained when the electrode was scanned with higher potentials, which suggests that more photogenerated charge carriers of CuOx were separated and transferred to amplify the overall LSV current densities. Fig. 4b displays the curves of photocurrents delivered with the open-circuit potential (−0.045 V) under a light on/off mode, which reflects the intrinsic photoelectric effect of the material. A stable current density of −0.03 mA cm−2 can be delivered for the electrode without light irradiation. Upon light irradiation, the current immediately jumped to −0.095 mA cm−2 and then stabilized at −0.054 mA cm−2, which presents an enhancement of 1.8 times the stabilized current delivered without light (−0.03 mA cm−2).

To further evaluate the photocurrents generated from the photoelectric effect, the current densities were measured with a potential bias of 0.1 V (Fig. 4c). An average current density of 0.06 mA cm−2 can be observed when the light is off, and the photocurrent was increased to 0.08 mA cm−2 averagely upon light irradiation, clearly revealing the photoelectric effect of the CC@NiCuOx electrode. Moreover, sharp current changes can be found when switching the light on and off. This could be caused by the compensation between the photocurrents and external currents driven by the potential bias. Fig. 4d exhibits the EIS results of the CC@NiCuOx electrode (the inset is an equivalent circuit), for which the impedance values before and after cycling tests (5000 cycles) under light on/off mode were measured, respectively. Before the cycling tests, the solution resistances (Rs) of the photoelectrodes were determined to be 1.336 and 1.562 Ω with/without light irradiation, respectively. The values were then changed to 1.748 and 0.982 Ω, respectively, after the cycling tests. Meanwhile, the contact resistances (Rct) were 0.44 and 0.12 Ω before cycling under light off/on, respectively, and then increased to 4.38 and 2.86 Ω after the cycling tests. The changes of the impedances before and after cycling tests clearly indicated that light is favorable for reducing the overall resistances of the electrode system.
To compare the pseudocapacitive performances of the as-fabricated CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode, CV and GCCD measurements were carried out with various scan rates and current densities under light on/off modes. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the electrode obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, where higher anodic and cathodic currents can be delivered under light-on mode compared to those under light-off mode. More comparison results between light-on and off conditions can be seen from the CV curves delivered from different scan rates (Fig. 5bvs. Fig. S8a†), which reveals that the redox reactions that are associated with pseudocapacitive energy storage can be significantly strengthened. Fig. 5c displays the GCCD curves of the electrode obtained at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and a much longer discharge time was recorded under light irradiation compared to that without light irradiation. In addition, GCCD curves performed at different current densities were collected under light irradiation (Fig. 5d), which further validates the photo-assisted charge and discharge process, compared to those obtained without light irradiation (Fig. S8b†). Based on the discharge curves, specific capacitances with light irradiation can be calculated to be 2937, 2450, 2121, 1672, 1383, 1065, and 625 mF cm−2 at current densities of 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much higher than respective capacitances obtained without light irradiation.
 Fig. 5  CV curves performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 with light on/off (a) and various scan rates under light (b), GCCD curves performed at a current density 10 mA cm−2 with light on/off (c) and various current densities under light (d), and cycling performances performed at of 50 mA cm−2 with light on/off (e) of the CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode. 
The CV (Fig. S9†) and GCCD (Fig. S10†) curves obtained at a specific scan rate or current density were presented and compared, where larger CV shapes or longer GCCD time can be clearly observed under light irradiation compared to without light irradiation. As a result, the capacitance enhancements induced by in situ photocharging are determined to be 17.5%, 12.1%, 25.7%, 22.3%, 21%, 23.8%, and 25.5% at the respective current densities based on the capacitances calculated without light irradiation. The as-obtained electrochemical performance is comparable to those of other photoelectrodes for supercapacitors reported previously (Table S1†).
In addition, CV and GCCD of CC@CuOx and CC@NiO under light-on and off conditions were also performed and compared to validate the light-enhanced electrochemical performances of the Ni or Cu based oxides. Larger CV shapes and longer GCCD time have been demonstrated for both two samples under light irradiation for the samples CC@CuOx (Fig. S11†) and CC@NiO (Fig. S12†), respectively, which reflects the light enhancements of the two electrodes. The capacitance enhancements by light energy for CC@CuOx range from 10.6–15.4% (Fig. S13†) with different densities from 5–50 mA cm−2, while the values of CC@NiO range from 4.6–27.9% at respective current densities (Fig. S14†). The relatively slight enhancement of CC@CuOx could be due to the high photoelectric effect and poor pseudocapacitive properties. Interestingly, light enhancement in CC@NiO was also observed, which suggests that the pseudocapacitive charge storage of NiO can be strengthened by the photoelectric effect of itself. However, the maximum specific capacitance of CC@NiO is less than 2250 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 no matter with or without light irradiation, which is much lower than those of the CC@NiCuOx electrode. Prolonged cycling tests were also conducted with/without light irradiation at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2 to evaluate the photo-stability of the CC@NiCuOx photoelectrodes (Fig. 5e). An initial capacitance of 400 mF cm−2 was delivered without light irradiation, and 348.8 mF cm−2 was retained after 5000 cycles, revealing a capacitance retention of 87.2%. Under light irradiation, a higher initial capacitance of 510 mF cm−2 was calculated, and a comparable retention of 82.5% can be retained after 5000 cycles. A slight lower retention obtained under light compared to that without light is probably due to the photocorrosion of CuOx during the long-term light irradiation. It can be also noted that the cycling performances in both with and without light irradiation are good, suggesting a high stability of the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode.
The GCCD curves obtained under light on/off (at 10 mA cm−2) are displayed and compared in Fig. 6a to study the charging mechanisms, where positions I and II indicate the fully charged states of the photoelectrode without and with light irradiation, respectively. The photoelectrode was charged by an external electric field only (positive charger carriers h+) in the absence of light, while photogenerated holes h* were additionally utilized during the charging process as well as the h+ under light (the arrows in Fig. 6a indicate the charging process with/without light).
 Fig. 6  GCCD curves obtained under light-off and on, respectively (a), capacitance enhancements calculated from various current densities (b), and XPS spectra of Ni 2p and Cu 2p collected from the samples and states in (a), respectively (c–h), of the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode. 

Fig. 6b presents the capacitance enhancements caused by the light energy at different current densities, where a maximum enhancement of 25.5% can be delivered at 50 mA cm−2. To further study the mechanism of pseudocapacitive energy storage by photocharging, XPS tests were carried out for the complete charging states with and without light (Fig. 6c–h). For the Ni 2p, binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 (852.5 eV, from position I) and Ni 2p1/2 (872 eV, from position I) were increased to 853.5 eV (from position II) and 873 eV (from position II) under photocharging (Fig. 6c), respectively, suggesting the enhanced oxidation of Ni species. In addition, the areal ratio of Ni3+/Ni2+ was increased from 1.32 (from position I) to 2.22 (from position II) under photocharging (Fig. 6d and e), which further clearly reveals that more Ni2+ ions were oxidized to Ni3+ during the light-on charging process.
Such an enhancement may promote the pseudocapacitive charge storage of the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode. Similarly, for the Cu 2p, binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 (932.5 eV, from position I) and Cu 2p1/2 (952.5 eV, from position I) were decreased to 932 eV (from position II) and 952 eV (from position II) under photocharging (Fig. 6f), respectively, which is possibly due to the formation of more Cu2O in the interfacial nanosheets. A detailed comparison between Fig. 6g and h has shown that the areal ratio of Cu+/Cu2+ was increased from 1 (from position I) to 1.22 (from position II) under photocharging, further confirming that more Cu2+ ions were reduced by the photogenerated electrons during the light-on charging process. Accordingly, the presence of CuO and Cu2O in the CC@NiCuOx electrode is effective in promoting the oxidation kinetics of NiO under light irradiation.
To better illustrate charge transfer during the energy storage process, a possible mechanism of in situ photocharging occurring within the CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode is proposed in Fig. 7a. Under light irradiation, charge separation and accumulation occurred in the CuOx (including CuO and Cu2O), forming an in-built electric field (IBEF) localized in the electrode. Driven by the IBEF and external electric field (external charging), the photogenerated electrons travel through NiO to increase the electronic conductivity. Meanwhile, the photoinduced holes were left and accumulated in the CB, which may further promote oxidation of the neighboring NiO species, bringing about an additional charge storage. During a charge process, the drained electron flux moved rapidly within the electrodes due to the ohmic contact between NiO and CuOx as well as the presence of the highly conductive CC substrate. In this way, the pseudocapacitive energy storage of NiO components was largely strengthened, which can deliver a higher specific capacitance of the electrode and probably even higher energy density for the fabricated supercapacitor full cells. Fig. 7b further presents the band structure alignments of the hybrid electrode, where the valence bands (VB) of CuO and Cu2O are lower than that of NiO, making it difficult for the photogenerated holes to inject from CuOx to NiO directly. However, the presence of O vacancies in NiO may lead to localized acceptor states (VO) above the VB of NiO.46,47 Thus, it is reasonable to infer that these acceptor states can serve as the possible pathways for the holes transferring from CuO/Cu2O to NiO. Meanwhile, it is hard for the photogenerated electrons to inject from the conduction bands (CB) of CuOx to the CB of NiO due to the more negative CB position of NiO, however, this electron flux can be easily realized by an external electric field.
 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration of the in situ photocharging (a), band structure alignments (b), and GCCD curves obtained under light off/on modes (c) of the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx photoelectrode. 
As additional evidence for photocharging, GCCD results with different capacitance retentions obtained under light on/off modes are demonstrated in Fig. 7c. All the GCCD curves were collected at a current density of 15 mA cm−2. It can be seen from the curves that the retention was decayed to 99.6% after 3 charge–discharge cycles. The value suddenly jumped to 103.4% upon light irradiation during charging. The retention then gradually increased to 109.6% under a light on/off mode (charge with light, and discharge without light). After 10 cycles, light irradiation was removed, which resulted in a quick decline of retention to 99.6% at the 10th cycle. Once the light was switched on again, capacitance retention was remarkably increased to 107.4%, and then further rose to 118.7% after another 10 cycles. These results have again clearly confirmed that the light effect demonstrated a positive effect on capacitance enhancements, which also verified the in situ photocharging mechanism proposed in this work.
4. Conclusions
CC@NiCuOx photoelectrodes composed of 1D carbon fibers and NiCuOx nanosheets were synthesized by an electrodeposition/annealing method. By virtue of the photoelectric CuO/Cu2O and pseudocapacitive NiO, the as-fabricated NiCuOx photoelectrodes have shown enhanced properties for electrochemical charge storage via a photocharging process. A possible photocharging mechanism has been proposed, and theoretical calculation was also performed to predict the photoelectric conversion and storage of the CC@NiCuOx materials. As a result, the as-fabricated CC@NiCuOx photoelectrodes demonstrated a maximum capacitance enhancement of 25.5% under light without sacrificing the cycling stability after 5000 cycles. This work may provide a new path to promote pseudocapacitive charge storage using light energy. Based on the obtained results, the as-prepared CC@NiCuOx materials could be promising for transparent photo-rechargeable energy storage devices.
