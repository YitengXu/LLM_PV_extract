1. Introduction
The substantial development of urban areas and society has raised concerns such as energy shortage and consequent environmental pollution worldwide.1–5 This has brought huge challenges in the sustainable development of human society.6,7 Intensive research was carried out in the past decade on the development of feasible measures to address the energy crisis and realize environmental remediation. Fortunately, sunlight-driven photocatalytic technology demonstrates great potential in eliminating environmental pollutants and producing solar fuel. It is also recommended as a promising countermeasure to solve these problems.8–10 A typical semiconductor photocatalytic process includes electron and hole production using photocatalysts under light irradiation, the transfer of produced electrons and holes to the photocatalyst surface, and required redox reactions through photogenerated electrons and holes.11,12 Unquestionably, the photocatalyst lies at the core of photocatalytic technology and plays a crucial part in harvesting light and driving reactions (Fig. 1).

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a metal-free semiconductor that is considered as a potential material in photocatalysis due to its unique physicochemical properties such as convenient preparation, non-toxicity, proper electronic structure, moderate bandgap, and resistance to acidic and alkaline conditions.13–16 As shown in Fig. 2, g-C3N4 consists of s-triazine or tri-s-triazine (s-heptazine) units connected to each other and exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) planar π conjugation structure similar to graphite.17 This 2D π conjugation structure can reinforce electron transfer because of its exceptional electronic conductivity. These excellent properties make g-C3N4 an extensively utilized material for energy and environmental restoration, including H2 generation from water splitting, CO2 photoreduction, degradation of organic contaminants, N2 fixation, and H2O2 production.18–22 Usually, the bulk g-C3N4 powder is compounded conveniently through the inexpensive thermal polycondensation of the nitrogen-containing precursor (urea, melamine, dicyandiamide) at a high temperature (500–650 °C). The photocatalytic activity of the pure bulk g-C3N4 often shows low efficiency for a low specific surface area, inadequate utilization of visible light, and fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Hence, various strategies like morphology tuning, foreign elements doping, and constructing heterostructure have been explored for designing effective g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.23–25 Of all these, preparing a heterojunction using cocatalysts or other semiconductor materials possess advantages in modulating the electronic structure, enhancing light absorbability, and promoting photoinduced charge carrier separation. Typically, incorporating appropriate cocatalysts to the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts has been demonstrated as a facile and efficient strategy to improve the photocatalytic properties.26,27 Particularly, 2D materials are often served as efficient cocatalysts for g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.28–30 Significantly, the unique 2D layered structures of the cocatalysts have a large number of exposed active sites and high specific surface area, which not only enable the easy access of reactants to the photocatalysts, but also facilitate the probability of photogenerated carriers reaching the surface, thus leading to an improved photocatalytic process.30 Moreover, the 2D/2D layered heterostructures can be desired, once the 2D cocatalysts are coupled with g-C3N4.10 As compared to other types of 2D-based contact interfaces (e.g., 0D/2D, 1D/2D and 2D/3D), the face-to-face stacking of 2D/2D heterostructures possesses the largest interfacial contact area with band alignment, which enhances the transfer and separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus contributing to a totally improved photocatalytic performance.10 For example, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides were widely used as cocatalysts to enhance the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts because of the suitable band alignment between them.27,30

Recently, MXenes, the new intriguing family of 2D transition metal carbides or carbonitrides, have triggered extensive concerns in energy storage and conversion for prominent physicochemical traits.31–35 The general formula for MXenes is Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M represents a transition metal like Ti, Nb, and Mo; X means carbon and/or nitrogen; T represents surface-terminated functional groups like –OH, –O, and –F. As shown in Fig. 3, Mn+1XnTx sheets are often combined via van der Waals interactions and/or hydrogen bonds,36 and are widely synthesized by direct HF etching and indirect in situ HF etching. In the past few years, MXenes have become a worthy contender for boosting the efficacy of semiconductor photocatalysts.35–37 To date, different kinds of MXenes (e.g., Ti3C2, Ti2C Nb2C, Mo2C) were explored as effective cocatalysts for some typical semiconductor photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2, CdS, Bi2WO6, g-C3N4) in various photocatalytic applications.35–37 In particular, there has been an increasing interest in exploring MXenes as cocatalysts in g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for the following remarkable superior properties.38–40 First, the several terminal functional groups of the MXene surface are advantageous in reinforcing the reactant adsorption performance of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for diverse photocatalytic reactions.36 These functional groups consolidate the interface chemical connection with g-C3N4. A Schottky junction usually forms between MXenes and g-C3N4 and serves as an electron trap, inhibiting the recombination of the photoexcited electrons and holes of g-C3N4.36 Second, the prominent metallic conductivity of MXenes renders the rapid separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Third, the large specific area of 2D layered MXenes and the large portion of exposed transition metal atoms can provide abundant active catalytic sites, and improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. Moreover, MXenes are employed as semiconductor precursors to construct composites, during which MXenes are partly or fully oxidized to the corresponding metal oxide. This fact suggests that the coupling of MXene derivatives with g-C3N4 can bring about the formation of diverse heterojunction types with close interfacial contact, such as Type II, S-scheme, and Z-scheme, which can energetically facilitate the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation.36 As compared to other g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives also exhibit some unique advantages in various photocatalytic applications, as follows:38–40 (i) MXenes possess higher electrical conductivity than most representative cocatalysts, which enables them to be promising reservoirs to trap and shuttle the photoelectrons generated from g-C3N4, thus promoting the separation of charge carriers; (ii) the electronic structures of MXenes are easily modulated by surface modification, which prompts the charge carrier separation in g-C3N4/MXenes-based hybrid photocatalysts; (iii) the large surface-to-volume ratio of MXenes can not only improve the adsorption of the reactants of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, but also endow sufficient sites for photocatalytic reactions.

With the facts mentioned above, a combination of g-C3N4 and MXenes or their derivatives can improve the charge carrier separation and transportation significantly, providing expanded specific surface area and adequate adsorption sites, which assure excellent photocatalytic performance. Owing to these advantages, many researchers employ MXenes and their derivatives to be incorporated with g-C3N4-based photocatalysts (Fig. 4), and a fast-growing number of related research papers have been published in recent years.41–45 Different from the reported works, the current review mainly focuses on the combination of g-C3N4 and MXenes, as well as their derivatives (Fig. 5).14,34,35,46 First, we begin with a discussion of the fundamental photocatalytic mechanism over g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives. Then, we provide a brief review to discuss various synthetic routes and design strategies for the incorporation of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts with MXenes and their derivatives. Subsequently, a systematic review of recent studies addressing the environment and energy applications of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes or MXenes derivatives is provided, including H2 generation from water splitting, CO2 conversion, pollutant degradation, N2 fixation and H2O2 production. Finally, we conclude this review with a description of the challenges and an invigorating prospective outlook for future research directions in the field.

2. Fundamental photocatalytic mechanism over g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives
2.1 g-C3N4-Based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes

2.1.1 MXenes coupled with pristine g-C3N4 photocatalysts. 
Generally, the MXenes are often coupled with single g-C3N4 to form a Schottky junction system, which is an effective way to promote the photogenerated charge transfer.45,47–49 As shown in Fig. 6(a), the photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 can flow from g-C3N4 to MXene through the formed interface, which is driven by the potential difference of Fermi levels in these two materials, as well as the excellent electrical conductivity of MXene. Therefore, g-C3N4 possesses positive charges, while MXene has excess negative charges near the interface. This fact would lead to the formation of a space charge layer at the interface, which induces a Schottky junction between g-C3N4 and MXene. Consequently, the formed Schottky junction can act as an electron trap to efficiently capture the photoinduced electrons from g-C3N4, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 6  (a–c) Schematic diagrams of the representative heterojunctions for g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes. 


2.1.2 MXenes coupled with g-C3N4-based heterojunctions. 
When MXenes are coupled with g-C3N4-based heterojunctions, they often act as a ‘bridge” or solid-state-electron mediator to accelerate the charge carrier transfer.44,50 Typically, the implanted MXenes can respectively form hybrids with g-C3N4 and another semiconductor, thereby forming strong interface contacts. As for the first case, MXenes are coupled with a g-C3N4-based Type II heterojunction system with a staggered energy band alignment (Fig. 6(b)). During the photocatalytic process, the electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 can quickly migrate to the surface of MXenes by acting as a ‘bridge”, and then the electrons are accelerated to migrate to the CB of the paired semiconductor. Meanwhile, the holes on the VB of the paired semiconductor passed through the MXenes as the same role, and the holes were migrated to the VB of g-C3N4. As a result, the recombination of charge carriers in this hybrid system could be effectively prevented, which leads to efficient photocatalytic activity. In another case, MXenes are coupled with a g-C3N4-based Type II heterojunction Z-scheme system (Fig. 6(c)). During the photocatalytic process, the introduced MXenes with high conductivity served as a solid-state-electron mediator, which can make a faster electron transfer from the CB of the paired semiconductor to the VB of g-C3N4. Thus, the photogenerated electrons and holes are respectively accumulated in the CB of g-C3N4 and VB of the paired semiconductor, leading to the effective photoinduced charge separation.

2.2 g-C3N4-Based photocatalysts incorporated by MXene derivatives
Many research works reported that MXenes can be oxidized to the corresponding metal oxide semiconductor because of the high proportion of exposed transition metal atoms on the surface of MXenes.51–54 When g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are coupled with these MXene-derived photocatalysts, some typical heterojunctions are accordingly built for various photocatalytic applications. For example, a Type II heterojunction system is formed between the g-C3N4 and MXene derivatives when MXenes are fully oxidized (Fig. 7(a)). During the photocatalytic process, the electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 can quickly migrate to the CB of the MXene derivatives semiconductor, while the holes on the VB of the MXene derivatives semiconductor would migrate to the VB of g-C3N4, which favors the separation and transfer of charge carriers and thus the photoactivity enhancement of the g-C3N4-based composite. In addition, when MXenes are partly oxidized, it would result in the formation of metal oxide semiconductor-MXenes–g-C3N4 composites. The ternary system has the synergistic effect of Schottky junctions and type-II heterojunction (Fig. 7(b)), which can promote the separation of charge carriers in semiconductors, and thus enhance the photoactivities of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.

3. Strategies for exploring g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives
Many synthesis approaches have been proposed recently for g-C3N4 or MXene with different morphologies.55–57 Here, we will focus not on the synthetic method of the pure g-C3N4 or MXene, but their composites instead. With assembly strategies for g-C3N4 and MXene or MXene-derived nanostructures, the major synthetic approaches are electrostatic self-assembly, in situ thermopolymerization, solution mixing, and mechanical grinding-assisted calcination methods. We elaborate on these approaches below.
2.1 Electrostatic self-assembly method
Electrostatic self-assembly refers to a functional finishing method for manufacturing complex composite materials, which utilizes the electrostatic interaction of differently charged materials.58–61 The approach has gained successful application in the synthesis of g-C3N4/MXene composite photocatalysts.62–64 Generally, the prepared g-C3N4 and MXene are of opposite charges before the self-assembly. The assembly is then derived by the electrostatic attraction between opposite charges in an aqueous solution. In a recent study, Yang et al.48 adopted the electrostatic self-assembly method to synthesize 2D/2D Ti3C2 MXene/g-C3N4 composites. During synthesis, the positively charged porous g-C3N4 nanosheets were synthesized by HCl-assisted ultrasonication, while the negatively charged Ti3C2 nanosheets were prepared under DMSO-assisted ultrasonication (Fig. 8(a)). Thus, the 2D/2D Ti3C2 MXene/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 8(b)) were obtained by spontaneous electrostatic interaction between the positively charged porous g-C3N4 and negatively charged Ti3C2 nanosheets. Similarly, Hu et al.65 also reported the preparation of 2D/2D Ti3C2 MXene/porous g-C3N4 using a one-step electrostatic self-assembly method (Fig. 8(c)).

Apart from the fabrication of 2D/2D structures, the electrostatic self-assembly method was adopted for preparing g-C3N4/MXene composites with other fascinating microstructures. In a recent study,43 positively charged inverse opal g-C3N4 with carbon vacancies (IOCNCV) and negatively charged Ti3C2 quantum dots (TCQDs) were first produced by hard-template approach and top-down process, respectively (Fig. 9(a)). Then, 0D/3D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 9(b and c)) were obtained by electrostatic self-assembly of the positively charged IOCNCV and negatively charged TCQDs. Kang et al.66 designed another 3D MXene/g-C3N4 hybrid material by combining the electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly and template-assistant approach. As shown in Fig. 9(d), the negatively charged Ti3C2Tx MXene was covered on the positively charged polystyrene (PS) microbeads via the electrostatic assembly process. Then, the positively charged g-C3N4 nanosheets were attached to the Ti3C2Tx/a-PS hybrids by a second electrostatic interaction process. Finally, the 3D p-gC3N4/Ti3C2Tx hollow spheres (Fig. 9(e and f)) were produced by pyrolysis of the PS template in an inert atmosphere.

2.2 
          In situ thermopolymerization method
The simple in situ thermopolymerization method was also found to be effective for loading g-C3N4 on MXene or a MXene-derived support.67–69 In a typical synthesis process, MXene was pre-synthesized by a known etching process. Then, urea or melamine molecules were penetrated in MXene. Since the MXene surface is usually combined with multiple terminal groups, such as –F, –O, and –OH, their strong interaction enables urea or melamine molecules to be attached closely to the MXene surface. The incorporation of g-C3N4 with MXene or MXene-derived support is obtained by subsequent calcination under air or inert atmosphere. Yang et al.69 synthesized a 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunction successfully via in situ thermopolymerization. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the authors first synthesized an accordion-like structured Ti3C2 by HF etching. Then, the as-prepared layered Ti3C3 was dispersed in urea solution through sonication so that the urea molecules could penetrate the Ti3C2 interlayers. Finally, ultrathin 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 10(b and c)) were obtained by calcination of the sandwich-like Ti3C2-urea precursor under the N2 atmosphere. By utilizing a similar in situ thermopolymerization process, Li et al.70 also synthesized a Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunction by using melamine instead of urea. While coupling g-C3N4 with a MXene-derived nanostructure, there are two possible ways based on the in situ thermopolymerization method. For example, Liu et al.52 reported the preparation of MXene-derived TiO2@C/g-C3N4 heterojunctions. As displayed in Fig. 10(d), Ti3C2Tx MXene/melamine precursor was first prepared using the same method described above. The only difference was the calcination of the formed MXene–melamine precursor in air, and the MXene-derived TiO2@C/g-C3N4 heterojunctions (Fig. 10(e)) were produced in this in situ thermopolymerization process. In another recent study, Jiang et al.54 reported a different method for coupling g-C3N4 with a MXene-derived nanostructure. In the synthesis process (Fig. 10(f)), Nb2O5/C/Nb2C was first prepared by calcination of Nb2CTx MXene in a CO2 environment. Then, melamine molecules were anchored on the surface of Nb2O5/C/Nb2C, and the resulting Nb2O5/C/Nb2C/g-C3N4 composite (Fig. 10(g)) was obtained by an in situ thermopolymerization process under N2 atmosphere calcination.

2.3 Solution mixing method
In this route, g-C3N4 and MXene powders are often pre-synthesized using a known thermopolymerization and etching method, respectively. The mixing or sonication of the g-C3N4 powders and required MXenes is then carried out in water or organic solvent solution. While blending, the composites are prepared during the evaporation of water or organic solvent solution. For instance, Ti3C2(OH)2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts with different Ti3C2(OH)2 MXene loadings can be synthesized smoothly by mixing two compounds with an aqueous solution for 12 h.71 The composites are then centrifuged three times and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. Song et al.44 reported the synthesis of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 photocatalysts having different mass ratios in which the g-C3N4 and the Ti3C2 nanosheets could be mixed ultrasonically through an ethanol–water system, followed by overnight drying to evaporate the organic solvent. Moreover, BP quantum dots (BQ) were loaded on the g-C3N4/Ti3C2 composite by grinding and subsequent sonication process in Milli-Q water (Fig. 11(a)). In another study,72 the Ti3C2/TiO2 composite was first prepared by acid-oxidation treatment of the pre-synthesized Ti3C2 MXene, and subsequently by a solution mixing process to assemble the g-C3N4 nanosheets in an ethanol–water system. Another Ti3C2/TiO2/g-C3N4 ternary heterojunction was reported by Khan and coworkers73 by adopting the solution mixing process. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the g-C3N4 sheets were made after the melamine thermal decomposition, while Ti3C2 nanosheets were synthesized by etching and sonication exfoliation process. The Ti3C2/TiO2/g-C3N4 composites were then obtained by vigorous mixing of the layered Ti3C2, g-C3N4 sheets, and TiO2 nanoparticles in ethanol solution and a subsequent drying process.

2.4 Mechanical grinding-assisted calcination method
Mechanical grinding suggests the physical mixing of pre-synthesized g-C3N4 and MXenes. The method improves the interface between MXenes and g-C3N4 without introducing an agent. Besides, a further calcination process could significantly improve the interaction between the components. For instance, Han et al.74 first prepared the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite with a different weight ratio of Ti3C2 by grinding the g-C3N4 power and Ti3C2 in an agate mortar with an appropriate dose of alcohol. Then, a C–TiO2/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was made by one-step calcination of the finely ground Ti3C2/g-C3N4 mixtures (Fig. 12(a)). Typical TEM (Fig. 12(b)) and HRTEM (Fig. 12(c)) images of the as-prepared C–TiO2/g-C3N4 revealed nanosheet-like morphology and the intimate connection of g-C3N4 with TiO2.

In a brief summary of this section, the different strategies for assembling g-C3N4 with MXenes or MXene-derived nanostructures have been discussed, mainly including electrostatic self-assembly, in situ thermopolymerization, solution mixing and mechanical grinding-assisted calcination. The advantages, disadvantages and applicable situations of these strategies are preliminarily summarized, as shown in Table 1.

4. Photocatalytic applications of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives
With respect to the metallicity of MXenes with a lower Fermi level than g-C3N4, a Schottky barrier is often formed between the g-C3N4 and MXenes for facilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the coupling of g-C3N4 with MXene-derived photocatalysts with matched energy alignment is able to form some efficient heterojunction, such as Type-II, Z-scheme and S-scheme, which also can significantly promote the photogenerated charge separation. Thus, it is expected that the performance of g-C3N4 photocatalysts can be enhanced considerably by incorporating them with MXenes or their derivations. Also, this incorporation can expand their scope of application in solar photocatalysis-based energy and environmental fields. Their application in the photocatalytic field primarily involves the formation of H2 from water splitting, CO2 conversion, pollutant degradation, N2 fixation, and H2O2 production (Table 2). The performance and mechanism of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes or MXene derivatives will be observed in the current section.

4.1 H2 generation
Hydrogen (H2), an environment-friendly energy resource, has been regarded as an ideal candidate to replace traditional fossil fuels in the last few years.75–77 Of all the methods of H2 generation, the splitting of water into H2 by semiconductor-based photocatalysts can be a feasible approach under normal pressure and temperature.78–81 The photocatalytic water splitting process of H2 generation involves the formation of electrons and holes by the photocatalysts under light irradiation, migration of the produced electrons and holes to the photocatalyst surface, and water reduction reaction through photogenerated electrons to produce H2 (Fig. 13).79–82 It has been reported that the pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and hole scavenger in the solutions had a profound influence on the photocatalytic water splitting to produce H2.83,84 Besides the solution properties, another crucial requirement for efficient H2 production is a suitable photocatalyst, which includes an appropriate band position, an ideal bandgap to absorb more light, and the rapid carrier migration and recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Thanks to the abundance, stability, and suitable band structure, g-C3N4 is considered as a potential photocatalyst in the visible-light-driven H2 generation from water splitting. However, the high rate of photoinduced charge-carrier recombination prohibits the use of blank g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic H2 generation. Recently, constructing a g-C3N4-based compound system via incorporating MXenes or MXene-derived nanostructures is a hot topic in improving the photocatalytic H2 production activity.
 Fig. 13  Schematic diagram of the photocatalytic H2 production mechanism over a semiconductor photocatalyst. 
In 2017, Shao et al.67 revealed the potential of Ti2Cx MXenes as a highly efficient cocatalyst in improving the performance of g-C3N4 during H2 evolution. The Ti2C/g-C3N4 heterojunction displayed a higher activity of photocatalytic H2 evolution than the pure g-C3N4 heterojunction. In this case, the produced Schottky barrier might have captured the photogenerated electrons. Apart from Ti2C and Ti3C2, another member of MXenes has been extensively used as a high-efficient cocatalyst of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts via constructing 2D/2D heterojunction.44,45,62,65,68,85 Su et al.85 synthesized 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Under visible light irradiation, the optimized Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite had seven times greater photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capacity than the pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 14(a)). It has been demonstrated that the formation of Schottky junction facilitates the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, but the 2D/2D interfaces further afford a large channel of charge transfer to promote the photoinduced electron transfer, which systematically enhanced the g-C3N4 photocatalytic activity (Fig. 14(b)). In a similar example,86 the authors highlighted the introduction of other H2 evolution cocatalysts (Pt) to further increase the hydrogen evolution rate in 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts. The prepared g-C3N4/Ti3C2/Pt demonstrated a hydrogen evolution rate as high as 5.1 mmol h−1 g−1, around three times greater than g-C3N4/Ti3C2. Besides the 2D/2D Schottky heterojunction, coupling g-C3N4 with Ti3C2 to form 2D/3D and 0D/2D composites was also reported for realizing efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution. For instance, Li and coworkers70 reported a 2D/3D g-C3N4/Ti3C2 heterojunction that was prepared for effective visible-light photocatalytic H2 evolution. As shown in Fig. 14(c), Li et al.87 prepared a 0D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite for photocatalytic H2 generation by the decoration of Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots (QDs) for g-C3N4 nanosheets.

Ti3C2Tx-based MXenes are also considered efficient cocatalysts that hybridize with g-C3N4 during photocatalytic H2 evolution. In comparison with Ti3C2, Ti3C2Tx possesses some hydrophilic functional groups that facilitate strong interaction with water molecules and function as excellent cocatalysts during the photocatalysis reaction. For example, 3D nanostructured Ti3C2Tx hollow spheres may be combined with protonated g-C3N4 (p-g-C3N4) nanoshells to achieve effective photocatalytic H2 evolution.66 The optimal p-g-C3N4/Ti3C2Tx had a 3.5-fold H2 production rate, higher than pure p-g-C3N4 (Fig. 14(d)). Xu et al.88 adopted Ti3C2Tx MXene after plasma treatment as cocatalysts for improving the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4. They concluded that Ti–O functional groups increased on the layered Ti3C2Tx MXene surface following the plasma treatment, which may strongly capture photoinduced electrons from g-C3N4 and significantly promote the separation of electrons and holes to enhance the H2 generation rate.
Not only MXene-based cocatalysts, but also MXene-derived nanostructures involving partly and completely oxidized MXenes, have aroused great interest in facilitating the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4. Zhang et al.51 reported the preparation of heterostructured d-Ti3C2/TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites to enhance the photocatalytic H2 production activity under visible light, where d-Ti3C2/TiO2 was obtained by partial conversion of Ti3C2 MXenes. Type-II heterojunction formed between TiO2 and g-C3N4. The residual d-Ti3C2 could serve as an efficient cocatalyst, which synergistically inhibited the photoinduced charge recombination. Therefore, the Ti3C2/TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite had a higher H2 evolution rate than the pure g-C3N4. C–TiO2/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts may be produced via incorporation of the C–TiO2 obtained by complete oxidation of Ti3C2 MXene and g-C3N4 nanosheets.74 Under visible light irradiation, the prepared C–TiO2/g-C3N4 photocatalysts showed an 8-fold H2 production rate in contrast to pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 14(e)) because of the closed Type-II heterojunction conformation between C–TiO2 and g-C3N4 that can promote the transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 14(f)).
4.2 Conversion of CO2
Global warming is becoming a serious concern because of the excessive emission of greenhouse gases like CO2. Among the proposed solutions for this crisis, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals with sunlight as the only energy input is regarded as the most promising technology.89 Mimicking photosynthesis can achieve CO2 reduction. Photosynthesis in green plants is also called the “holy grail” reaction, as it can solve the problems of the greenhouse effect and energy shortfall simultaneously without additional consumption of energy and pollutant emission.90–93 Generally, the process of CO2 photoreduction involves four main steps: (I) CO2 adsorption, (II) generation of a photoinduced electron–hole pair over a semiconductor photocatalyst, (III) electron–hole pair separation and migration, (IV) CO2 reduction on the photocatalyst surface (Fig. 15). Herein, the adsorption capacity of semiconductor photocatalysts for CO2 molecules and the charge separation migration efficiency are the crucial aspects to determine its photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Typically, the overall process can be divided into two half-reactions, including water oxidation and CO2 reduction. As for the oxidation process, the water could be also regarded as a hole scavenger reagent to promote the CO2 reduction. With regard to the CO2 reduction, it is worth noting that CO2 could be reduced into multifarious products by obtaining different numbers of electrons, such as CH4, CO, HCOOH, and CH3OH.94 Thus, the product selectivity of CO2 reduction is also of great significance for its practical application.94 It was proposed that many factors affected the selectivity of CO2 reduction, mainly including the reduction capacity of photogenerated electrons over the used photocatalysts, surface photogenerated electron density, surface catalytic active sites and reaction rates, and adsorption/desorption properties of reactants/intermediates.95 Thus, the main strategies for controlling the product selectivity are available from tuning the band structure, charge separation efficiency, adsorption and activation of reactants, surface catalytic reactions/active sites, as well as the adsorption/desorption properties of the semiconductor photocatalysts.95
 Fig. 15  Schematic diagram of CO2 photoreduction over a semiconductor photocatalyst. 
As an emerging photocatalyst, g-C3N4 was also widely studied for CO2 photocatalytic reduction under visible light irradiation.96–99 However, the efficiency of g-C3N4 seems relatively low in practice because of insufficient surface-active sites, restricted CO2 molecule adsorption activity, and sluggish charge separation and migration. MXene possesses abundant adsorption sites for CO2 molecules and remarkable electron capture ability, which is considered to be one hopeful cocatalyst capable of dramatically reinforcing the g-C3N4 photocatalytic CO2 reduction capability.100 For instance, ultrathin Ti3C2 nanosheets were often combined with g-C3N4 to form 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, which were used for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction.65,69 As displayed in Fig. 16(a), Yang et al.69 revealed that an intimate interface contact was created when the 2D g-C3N4 photocatalyst and 2D Ti3C2 cocatalyst were coupled together to generate a Schottky junction to facilitate the spatial separation efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers. As a 10% amount of Ti3C2 is in the heterojunction, the evolution rate of CO reaches the maximum value, 5.19 μmol h−1 g−1, higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 16(b)), indicating that the g-C3N4 photocatalytic activity is greatly motivated by 2D Ti3C2 as the cocatalyst. Similarly, Hu et al.65 prepared a 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 conversion to CH4, in which the ultrathin 2D Ti3C2 MXene cocatalyst was fixed on porous g-C3N4 2D nanosheets. The resulting Ti3C2/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst possessed a markedly improved CH4 production rate compared to pure g-C3N4. According to another report,101 the photocatalytic CO2 conversion efficiency of 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 is enhanced by incorporating 2D bentonite (Bt) nanosheets for constructing a 2D/2D/2D heterojunction (Fig. 16(c)). The optimized g-C3N4/Bt/Ti3C2 heterojunction achieved a boosted photocatalytic CH4 evolution rate that was 4.42-fold more than that of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 (Fig. 16(d)). The boost is due to introducing a 2D Bt-mediator in the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 Schottky junction, which can provide new electron transfer channels. The more efficient adsorption of CO2 is also conducive to the enhancement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. It has been reported that generating various terminal functional groups on the MXene surface may reinforce the CO2 adsorption capacity of the MXene/g-C3N4 systems. In a sample study,71 alkalinized 2D Ti3C2 MXene (TCOH) was combined with 2D g-C3N4 as the cocatalyst for improved CO2 reduction performance (Fig. 16(e)). The optimized g-C3N4/Ti3C2 composite exhibited a 5.9 times greater CO2 reduction rate than the pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 16(f)), which is because the surface-alkalinized Ti3C2 (TCOH) cocatalyst improves the charge-carrier separation and also provides several adsorption sites for CO2 molecules.

Besides using MXene as a cocatalyst, MXene-derived nanostructures were also reported to incorporate with g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for highly efficient and steady photocatalytic CO2 conversion. According to this report, some g-C3N4-based heterojunctions are often fabricated for boosting the efficient spatial charge separation significantly. For example, Yang et al.102 reported the combination of g-C3N4 with a monolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene-derived TiO2/C for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (Fig. 17(a)). The prepared g-C3N4/TiO2/C composites exhibited better photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance than the pure g-C3N4, as it built an S-scheme heterojunction between g-C3N4 and the MXene-derived TiO2/C (Fig. 17(b)). In another interesting study,72 anatase/rutile (A/R) TiO2 nanoparticles were imbedded in 2D Ti3C2-exfoliated sheets through the partial conversion of MXene. Then, Ti3C2/TiO2 (A/R) was coupled with g-C3N4 for constructing the 2D/2D heterojunction. In this system, one type-II semiconductor heterojunction was prepared by combining TiO2 (A/R) with g-C3N4, while Ti3C2 MXene acted as an electron receiver that promoted electron transfer (Fig. 17(c)). Therefore, this composite photocatalyst showed a better CO evolution rate compared to pure g-C3N4.

4.3 Pollutant degradation
In the past few decades, environmental pollution problems have attracted great attention because of their intensely adverse effects on the sustainability of human society. There is an urgent need to look for available technologies for solving the growing environmental crisis. Semiconductor photocatalysis, driven by solar energy, featuring greenness, efficiency, economic efficiency, and eco-friendly properties, is considered a promising alternative technology for contaminant degradation.103–106 Attention should be paid to these problems for achieving highly-efficient photocatalytic pollutant degradation (Fig. 18). As this reaction is often carried out in solution, some key parameters of the solutions would inevitably influence the performance of photocatalytic pollutant degradation, such as solution pH and pollutant concentration in water.107,108 Certainly, the used photocatalyst is another critical factor to determine the pollutant removal efficiency. (i) The photocatalyst needs to absorb more irradiated light to produce photoinduced electron–hole pairs. (ii) The photocatalyst should have the ability to separate effectively and transfer the photoinduced electrons and holes, making them participate in the subsequent reaction. (iii) It is necessary to generate more superoxide (·˙O2−) and hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals through the reaction of photoinduced carriers for pollutant degradation.
 Fig. 18  Schematic diagram of the photocatalytic pollutant degradation over a semiconductor photocatalyst. 
Recently, g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been considered as one of the hot spots in photocatalytic pollutant degradation studies.109–111 In particular, many recent surveys proved that g-C3N4-containing MXene-based and MXene-derived photocatalysts may be combined in pollutant degradations,49,63,68,112–115 like antibiotics, endocrine disruptors, and dyestuff. The generated heterojunction may enhance the photoinduced carrier transfer remarkably and promote photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the strong O2 adsorption property of MXene guaranteed the conversion from O2 to ˙O2−, improving the photocatalytic degradation activity. For example, Liu and coworkers63 used Ti3C2 as a cocatalyst to design the g-C3N4/Ti3C2 Schottky heterojunction, which demonstrated superior photocatalytic capacity for ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation to g-C3N4. Similarly,49 a robust heterostructure photocatalyst for tetracycline hydrochloride degradation was constructed by introducing a few-layer Ti3C2Tx to alkalized g-C3N4 nanosheets. As displayed in Fig. 19(a), the formed Schottky junction between alkalized g-C3N4 and Ti3C2Tx would promote the charge separation effectively to generate more superoxide radicals for pollutant degradation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance (Fig. 19(b)). Ding et al.116 used Ti3C2 MXene as a precursor to fabricate TiO2@Ti3C2/g-C3N4 ternary heterojunction heterostructures for aniline and RhB photocatalytic degradation. Compared to pure g-C3N4, the TiO2@Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite showed superior photocatalytic performance, attributable to the generation of a n–n heterojunction and n-type Schottky heterojunction between the interfaces of TiO2@Ti3C2/g-C3N4. The generation of these heterojunctions makes more electrons react with O2 to generate highly oxidative reactive radicals like the superoxide radicals. More recently, Wu et al.53 also employed Ti3C2 MXene as a precursor in TiO2/g-C3N4/graphene (GTOCN) hybrid photocatalyst preparation, which was applied in the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), bisphenol A (BPA), and rhodamine B (RhB). Under visible light irradiation, GTOCN exhibited better photocatalytic capability, as compared to pure g-C3N4 for TC, CIP, BPA, and RhB degradation, due to the enhanced interfacial transfer and separation of photogenerated charges through the produced Z-scheme heterojunction (Fig. 19(c)). Additionally, g-C3N4 incorporated by MXene or MXene-derived photocatalysts was used to purify NO. For example, Li et al.42 fabricated a Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite for the photocatalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO). The directional electron transfer channel formed between Ti3C2 and g-C3N4 generated more ˙O2−, ˙OH−, and the photogenerated holes could participate in the subsequent NO reaction (Fig. 19(d)), which achieved the improved NO photocatalytic oxidation. In a recent report,117 the ternary g-C3N4/TiO2/Ti3C2–MXene photocatalysts with S-scheme heterojunctions were proposed, which was able to restrict the recombination of electron–hole pairs, thus resulting in an improved NO removal efficiency.

4.4 N2 fixation
It is well known that nitrogen (N) is an indispensable element in all living organisms. It serves as a fundamental material in synthesizing major biological compounds like amino acids and nucleotides.118,119 Although the content of nitrogen (N2) accounts for around 78% of Earth's atmosphere, living organisms normally cannot use the N2 molecules directly because of its inert feature, which is derived from the strong and steady triple bond (NN), large ionization energy, high first-bond cleavage energy, large energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, as well as the low solubility in water.119–122 Thus, it is necessary to transform molecular nitrogen into some nitrogen-containing compounds. Reducing N2 to ammonia (NH3) should be considered the foremost process in nitrogen fixation because NH3 is a major fertilizer material and a potential carrier of clean energy. At present, the Haber–Bosch (HB) process, which uses N2 and hydrogen (H2) as sources and iron or ruthenium-based catalysts, is the main way of industrial NH3 synthesis.119,121,122 However, this process requires not only substantial energy input, but also emits considerable greenhouse gases. It is estimated that the energy consumption of the Haber–Bosch process accounts for more than 1% of the total global fossil energy and produces over 300 million tons of CO2 per year.119,121,122 Thus, developing a sustainable and environment-friendly method suited for N2-to-NH3 conversion is necessary.119,121,122
In theory, NH3 generation in the HB process (N2 + 3H2 → NH3) would happen spontaneously at atmospheric pressure and room temperature because the standard Gibbs formation energy of this reaction is −16.047 kJ mol−1.123,124 Significantly, it was also found that N2 can be reduced by enzymes under ambient atmosphere in some nitrogen-fixing creatures.123,124 Thus, designing an appropriate catalytic system that can simulate the nitrogen-fixing creatures enzymes in nature would be feasible to produce NH3 under mild conditions.120,123,125 Up to date, different catalytic methods have been proposed, such as electrochemical, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical.120,124 Since the pioneering study on photocatalytic N2 fixation over a TiO2-based photocatalyst in 1977, it has been considered that such photochemical way is one of the cost-effective and eco-friendly N2 fixation processes.121,126,127 It can proceed in ambient conditions and use renewable solar energy as the driving force. Fig. 20 describes the general process of the semiconductor photocatalytic production of NH3 from water and N2. First, the used semiconductor photocatalyst is stimulated to create electrons and holes for the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) under sunlight irradiation, respectively. Then, H2O is oxidized to O2via photogenerated holes of VB, while N2 is reduced to NH3, following multi-step injections of photogenerated electrons and water-derived protons, which can be described by the following equations: 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+(1) 2N2 + 6H+ +6e− → 2NH3(2) 2N2 + 6H2O → 4NH3 + 3O2(3)
 Fig. 20  Schematic of the photocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 over a semiconductor-based photocatalyst. 
To achieve the photocatalytic nitrogen-fixation reaction, there are some key factors that are required. On the one hand, it is noted that water plays crucial roles on the photocatalytic nitrogen-fixation reactions, which not only offers the protons of the reactant, but also acts as a hole sacrificial reagent.128 More importantly, the semiconductor should possess an appropriate energy band structure, in which the CB position must be more negative than the N2/NH3 reduction potential, and VB is more positive compared to the oxygen evolution potential. Specifically, g-C3N4 possesses a suitable electronic band structure that can reduce N2 to NH3 under visible-light irradiation owing to its very negative CB position and moderate bandgap.129–132 However, the thwarted electronic conductivity prohibits the quick recombination rate of the photoinduced charge carriers of the g-C3N4 photocatalytic N2 fixation activity. MXene or MXene-derived nanostructures have excellent electrical conductivities, which can match favorably with g-C3N4 to form composites. Accordingly, the g-C3N4 incorporated by MXene or MXene-derived nanostructures was effective in N2 photoreduction due to the boosted interfacial electron transfer. Additionally, it is worth noting that the N2 adsorption and activation on the surface of the photocatalyst play decisive roles on the followed reduction. MXenes often have rich surface chemistry and selective adsorption capability, which is favorable for N2 adsorption and activation.120 Furthermore, the nitrogen adsorption and activation can also be further promoted by the surface modification of MXene.120 This implies that the incorporation of MXenes with g-C3N4-based photocatalysts can improve the adsorption of molecular nitrogen, thus leading to a boosted photocatalytic nitrogen fixation process.
For example, Liu et al.52 investigated the photocatalytic N2 fixation capability of g-C3N4 nanosheets by coupling to Ti3C2Tx MXene derived 2D planar carbon nanosheet-supported TiO2 nanocrystals containing multiple Ti3+ species. Under visible light irradiation, the resulting TiO2@C/g-C3N4 heterojunctions delivered a superior photocatalytic NH3 generation rate of 250.6 μmol g−1 h−1, around 18 times greater than the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 21(a)). In this system, the formed heterojunction reduced the photoinduced electron recombination, but the Ti3+ species became the adsorption sites for activating N2 and trapping the sites for photoexcited electrons; thus, synergistically promoting nitrogen reduction efficiency. In another study, Jiang and coworkers54 reported the combination of MXene-derived Nb2O5/C/Nb2C and g-C3N4 nanosheets for efficient N2 photo-fixation. Attributed to their superior photogenerated electron and hole separation efficiencies, the optimized Nb2O5/C/Nb2C/g-C3N4 heterojunction exhibited a higher nitrogen reduction rate as 365 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about five times greater than the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets. The increase was because of the produced Type-II heterojunction between g-C3N4 and Nb2O5, along with a Schottky junction formed at the Nb2O5/Nb2C intimate interface, which could synergistically strengthen the photogenerated electron and hole separation efficiency, leading to efficient N2 photo-fixation activity (Fig. 21(b)). Apart from MXene-derived nanostructures, MXene was also reported to be used directly to enhance the g-C3N4 photocatalytic N2 fixation capability. In a recent study, Sun et al.133 demonstrated the photocatalytic N2 fixation capability of 2D/2D Ti3C2/N-defect g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalyst prepared by coupling Ti3C2 nanosheets (MXenes) with N defect-rich g-C3N4 nanosheets. According to Fig. 21(c), the Ti3C2/N-defect g-C3N4 showed a significantly improved photocatalytic N2 fixation activity compared to that of the pristine Ti3C2 and g-C3N4. This activity enhancement was explained by the formation of the 2D/2D heterostructure, and the induced N-defects synergistically expedited the transfer of a photoinduced charge. Their work also confirmed that the exposed edge Ti in Ti3C2 could act as the active site for N2 adsorption and activation, and such active Ti sites may curb competition for H2 evolution reactions, resulting in a desirable N2 reduction reaction selectivity (Fig. 21(d)).

4.5 H2O2 production
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important clean chemical resource, has great applications in disinfection, organic synthesis, pulp and paper industry, and fuel cells.134 It is agreed upon that the dominating industrial H2O2 generation synthetic method should be the anthraquinone (AQ)-based approach, which contributes to over 95% of the gross production of H2O2.135,136 Unfortunately, the AQ process has some shortcomings, such as high cost, complicated synthesis, toxic by-products routes, and considerable investment in energy and raw materials.135 Besides, the alternative approach for direct synthesis by noble metal catalysts confronts a big problem of explosion risk because of the mixture of H2 and O2.135 Thus, a cheap, safe, and environment-friendly method for H2O2 production should be developed. In recent years, the production of H2O2 by a semiconductor-accommodated photocatalytic process has aroused many concerns. This method requires earth-abundant water and O2 as the only precursors and reproducible sunlight as an energy source, and no pollution is caused.137–140 Thus, the photocatalytic production of H2O2 is an environment-friendly and sustainable method, which has broad application prospects in this area. Typically, the photocatalytic H2O2 production process also follows basic photocatalysis principles. The primary feature of this process is that the photoinduced electron can react with O2 and H2O to produce H2O2. Generally, H2O2 is produced by two-electron direct reduction (O2–H2O2) or sequential two-step single-electron indirect reduction (O2–˙O2−–H2O2), which is determined by the used semiconductor photocatalysts (Fig. 22). In addition, the two key factors, including the reaction solution (e.g., sacrificial electron donors and solution pH) and the used photocatalysts, are decisive to the establishment of a system for the efficient photocatalytic production of H2O2.140
 Fig. 22  The possible generation pathways of H2O2 through a photocatalytic process. 
Many types of photocatalysts have been prepared and studied widely for H2O2 production.140 Of major interest, g-C3N4 is deemed to be one of the most promising photocatalyst candidates for the production of H2O2, owing to its non-toxicity, proper conduction band edges, efficient visible light absorption, great chemical stability, as well as eco-friendly superiority.141,142 However, the pristine irregular bulk morphology of common g-C3N4 often shows an unsatisfactory production of H2O2 due to its small specific surface area and fast recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. For enhancing the photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production, some works have already been reported related to the use of MXenes to incorporate with nanostructured g-C3N4. For instance, Yang et al.48 adopted Ti3C2 MXene sheets to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 production activity of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of the optimized Ti3C2 MXene/porous g-C3N4 (TC/pCN) heterostructures reached 2.20 μmol L−1 min−1, which is around 2.1 times greater than that for the pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 23(a)). The introduction of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets creates a Schottky junction with the host porous g-C3N4 nanosheets to boost the spatial charge separation and provides active sites in H2O2 generation, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity (Fig. 23(b)). In another study, Lin et al.43 reported the incorporation of Ti3C2 quantum dot (TCQDs) with defective (carbon vacancies) inverse opal g-C3N4 (TC/CN) for photocatalytic H2O2 production. A Schottky junction was formed between the intimate interface of the Ti3C2 quantum dot and defective g-C3N4, realizing the spatial separation for electrons and holes to efficiently avoid the recombination of charge carriers at defect sites (Fig. 23(d)). Thus, the optimum TC/CN photocatalyst had an H2O2 yield of 560.7 μmol L−1 h−1, which is 9.3 times greater than that for the bulk CN, under visible light irradiation (Fig. 23(c)).

5. Summary and outlook
The incorporation of MXenes and their derivatives is an effective route to totally enhance the performance of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for energy conversion and pollution degradation. The roles of incorporated MXenes and their derivatives mainly involve: (i) MXenes and their derivatives, as one of the excellent candidates of 2D materials, can act as the ideal platform for supporting g-C3N4 photocatalysts with a large surface area; (ii) the formed heterojunction with solid interfacial 2D/2D contact among g-C3N4 and MXenes profoundly enhances the Schottky barrier with accelerated excitonic dissociation for improved apparent conversion efficiency, which not only provides adequate charge transport and electron trapping channels to limit the charge recombination, but also facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers for boosted H2 production from water splitting, CO2 conversion, pollutant degradation, N2 fixation, H2O2 production, and so forth. Nevertheless, despite significant advances made in the photocatalytic field, there are some defects and challenges that need to be solved of the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and MXene derivatives. In particular, the photocatalytic efficiency of the hybrid photocatalyst is still far from what is needed for practical applications. The following suggestions and outlooks might be of some meaningful to meet the challenges.
First, regardless of the fact that the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and their derivatives can work under visible light, the ability for harvesting sun light is still poor because of the relatively large band gaps. To further enhance the light harvesting ability, the surface sensitization could be considered since the MXenes often have surface termination sites. In addition, doping with foreign elements is useful for tailoring the band gaps to broaden the spectral response range.
Second, despite the incorporation of MXenes with g-C3N4 offering excellent charge separation and migration process by forming an intimate interfacial contact, the prime challenge is still involved in the rapid charge transfer process to further accelerate the photocatalytic performance. Recently, it was proposed that constructing a S-scheme heterojunction photocatalytic system could facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers in space with improved charge-separation efficiency, which might be interesting for g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and their derivatives.
Third, the MXene derivatives in g-C3N4-based composites are often obtained by the surface oxidation of MXenes. How to precisely control the oxidation degree of MXenes should be a critical issue to be addressed. In this regard, the oxidation pathways and the reaction mechanisms of MXenes must be further understood, which is the key to accomplishing the incorporation of MXene derivatives with g-C3N4 in a controllable manner.
Fourth, regardless of the fruitful MXenes that have been widely reported, Ti3C2Tx-based counterparts were mainly applied for incorporation into g-C3N4. The incorporation of other typical MXenes, such as Mo2ScC2, Mo2C, TiNbC, Ta4C3 and V2C, into g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, deserve to be explored.
Fifth, with respect to the techniques for incorporating MXenes and their derivatives, the electrostatic self-assembly was applied as the popular one. Some more facile strategies are highly desired for the large-scale fabrication of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts incorporated by MXenes and their derivatives, which is one of the critically important points to push forward their practical applications.
Sixth, the in-depth physics on the correlation among the microstructure, morphology and photocatalytic behaviors are still not very clear, which must be investigated. For example, besides the improved charge carrier transfer, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the surface catalytic reactions need to be further explored, which can be assisted by some in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations.
Finally, the potential applications of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are mainly focused on photocatalytic water splitting and organic pollutant degradation. Some other interesting applications, for instance, degradation of tolerant contaminants, Cr(VI) reduction, and organic synthesis, are meaningful to be presented.
