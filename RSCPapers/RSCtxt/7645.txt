    , Accepted 22nd December 2021First published on 22nd December 2021AbstractThe overwhelming improvement in performance and the cost-effective solution processing enable perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) as a promising technology in the photovoltaic industry. Doped hole transport material (HTM)-based high-efficient PVSCs are facing challenges from device cost, stability, and scale-up fabrication. The development of highly-efficient dopant-free HTMs evolves as an effective approach to realize high-performance and stable PVSCs. In this review, we update herein the recent advances in the molecular design of undoped HTMs from the viewpoint of perovskite defects passivation and enhancing the PVSCs performance. Rational design strategies are proposed on the basis of constructing the interfacial interactions with perovskite layers. Taking successful HTMs as examples, we elaborate the design principles of dopant-free HTMs for highly-efficient and stable PVSCs. The correlation study between molecular structures and device performance and long-term stability of PVSCs is presented. Finally, a perspective on the development of dopant-free small organic HTMs is given for efficient and stable PVSCs toward their commercialization.
1. Introduction
By converting solar energy into electrical power, photovoltaic technologies are effective and reliable approaches to solve the energy crisis and environmental pollution for a sustainable and green world.1 In photovoltaic devices, light-absorbing materials are responsible for harvesting photon energy to form charge carriers, which can be collected by electrodes to generate electricity. The emerging perovskites with typical crystalline structure of ABX3 (Fig. 1a) demonstrate unique optoelectronic characteristics,2 such as high extinction coefficient (∼105 cm−1),3 tunable optical bandgaps (1.18–2.43 eV),4 high charge carrier mobility (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1),5 and long carrier diffusion length (∼1 μm for polycrystals and ∼175 μm for single crystals).6,7 These properties are feasibly tuned through judicious composition engineering.8–12 Since 2012, great efforts have been made to harness the full potential of perovskites in solar cells,13–16 enabling a surged power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5% for single-junction perovskite solar cell (PVSC).17 The prominent performance is on par with that of commercial crystalline silicon solar cells and copper indium gallium selenide (GIGS) solar cells.

In a typical PVSC, the perovskite absorber layer is sandwiched by an n-type electron transport layer (ETL) and a p-type hole transport layer (HTL). The device configurations can be classified into mesoporous n–i–p, planar n–i–p, and planar p–i–n structures based on the component deposition procedures (Fig. 1b). Generally, both the mesoporous and planar n–i–p type (conventional) PVSCs readily show superior PCEs compared to p–i–n type (inverted) ones. The inverted devices, however, are advantageous for easier fabrication processes, better compatibility with flexible substrates, and higher possibility of assembling tandem cells. Looking back at the development history of PVSCs, we can find the crucial trigger for the rapid improvement of the device performance is the exploitation of solid-state hole transport materials (HTMs), which effectively suppress the perovskite degradation in the liquid electrolytes and facilitate the hole extraction from the perovskite to improve both the device PCEs and operation stabilities.18 The development of low-cost and efficient HTMs has thus been one of the hot topics in the pursuit of high-performance and stable PVSCs.19
HTMs include inorganic compounds, organic polymers, organometallic composites, and small organic molecules. Among them, small organic molecules have attracted much attention because of their simple synthesis, easy-to-adjust structures, and less batch-to-batch variation, making them promising for large-scale application in the industry.20 The state-of-the-art HTM is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) for n–i–p type PVSCs and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) for p–i–n structured ones (Fig. 1c). Their suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (−5.2 eV for both spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA) match with most perovskites, while their good solubility in commonly used organic solvents and ability to form transparent films are ideal for device fabrication via solution-processing techniques. However, they exhibit relatively low intrinsic hole mobility (ca. ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1),21 relying heavily on the doping when used as HTMs to achieve high-efficiency PVSCs. The commonly-used dopants are depicted in Fig. 1d, which include tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tri(bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) (FK209), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP). The charge transfer reaction between the dopants and HTMs accounts for the basic p-doping processing. The high electron affinity of these p-type dopants causes the electrons to be extracted from the HTM molecules, endowing HTMs with high hole density and conductivity. However, the hygroscopic nature of the dopants may accelerate the degradation of the perovskite, and the plasticizing effect of t-BP for HTMs may decrease the glass transition temperature (Tg) of HTMs. The additional dopants hence not only make device preparation more complicated but also make the PVSCs sensitive to moisture and thermal impact during device operation.22
Despite the gratifying progress in efficiency, relatively poor long-term stability (few months) hinders PVSCs to substitute the current mainstream silicon-based solar cells, which have a lifetime of more than 20 years. To push the PVSC technology toward commercialization, chemists are working hard to develop more stable additives to replace hygroscopic Li-TFSI dopants, such as F4-TCNQ,24 CuSCN,25 and Cu(II) pyridine.26 On the other hand, numerous dopant-free HTMs with high intrinsic hole mobility and conductivity have been designed to avoid the use of the dopants, simplifying the device manufacturing process as well as reducing the cost of the whole cell.27 Several representative reviews pertaining to dopant-free HTMs have been published in the recent years.19,22,28–32 For example, an excellent review has summarized existing dopant-free HTMs into four categories including inorganic compounds, organic molecules, polymers, and metal composites in 2018. The correlations between the properties of HTMs (ca. ionization potential, bandgap, conductivity, hole mobility) and PVSCs parameters were well analyzed, together with the stability test behavior intrinsic HTMs.32 Among different groups of HTMs, p-type small organic molecules are promising due to their cost-effective synthesis, abundant resources, and adjustable functionalities. In this respect, dopant-free small molecular HTMs were reviewed by Xu's group with the performance evaluated on the basis of molecular structure analysis.30 Recently, the efforts in minimizing the energy loss at the interfaces have aroused our attentions, which encouraged us to engineer the HTM/perovskite interfaces through reasonable molecular design. In this review, we try to elaborate on the development of new dopant-free small organic molecules and emphasize the importance of interfacial interactions in the device performance. Firstly, we elucidate the motivation of removing the dopants from the hole transport layers by clarifying the working mechanism of the dopants and their specific effects on the device stability. Then, the major factors in the device efficiency and stability losses and the way to mitigate these negative effects through rational molecular designs will be highlighted. Thirdly, we will systematically analyze the relationships between the molecular structure and the photovoltaic performance by selecting the representative HTMs. Ultimately, we provide our perspectives in molecular design and device applications, especially for all-inorganic or lead-free PVSCs. We hope that this review can stimulate more attention and attempts for developing efficient dopant-free HTMs.
2. Motivation of removing dopants from HTMs
The main purpose of HTM doping is to improve the hole mobility and conductivity of HTL. For spiro-OMeTAD, the large intermolecular distance weakens the hole hopping among adjacent molecules, resulting in low intrinsic hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity (∼10−8 S cm−1).31 This causes the holes to be inefficiently extracted and separated in time, leading to increased non-radiative recombinations. After doping with p-type dopants, spiro-OMeTAD exhibits ten-fold improved hole mobility to over 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and almost three orders of magnitude increased conductivity (∼10−5 S cm−1).33 The doping mechanisms are shown in Fig. 2. Induced by light or thermal excitation, pristine spiro-OMeTAD generates radical cation spiro-OMeTAD˙+ O2˙− when it reacts with oxygen. LiTFSI then moves the equilibrium forward by forming weakly bound spiro-OMeTAD˙+ TFSI˙−,34 which possesses a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) slightly deeper than the HOMO of the pristine material (Fig. 2a). With the promotion of charge hopping between the pristine spiro-OMeTAD and radical cation species (spiro-OMeTAD˙+), the HTL can achieve significantly increased hole mobility and conductivity. Cobalt(III) complex such as FK209 also induces molecular p-doping because of its electron affinity similar to the ionization energy of spiro-OMeTAD.35 When these p-dopants are used, liquid additive t-BP is usually employed as the morphology controller to form complexes with lithium salts, dispersing the ionic dopants and enhancing the moisture resistance of the HTM films (Fig. 2b).36–38

Despite the raised efficiency, the detrimental impacts of the dopants and the additive on the device long-term stability are not negligible. For example, the ionic dopants are hygroscopic and tend to absorb moisture from the environment, causing slow degradation and decreased the interfacial adhesion of moisture-sensitive perovskites (Fig. 2c).39 In addition, since the dopants are not covalently bonded to the HTM, they will migrate under the electric field and affect charge separation at the interface, causing serious current–voltage (J–V) hysteresis (Fig. 2e and f).42 The permeation of t-BP causes the chemical corrosion of perovskites, raising the formation of the [PbI2-t-BP] complexes that are harmful to the long-term stability of the devices (Fig. 2d).41,43 Even at room temperature, t-BP can gradually evaporate in spite of its boiling point of 197 °C. This is an important reason for the morphology change of HTL during the long-term storage or operation. The plasticization effect of t-BP also lowers the thermal stability of HTM more or less.44 Very recently, the spectroscopic evidence of spiro-OMeTAD de-doping caused by t-BP was provided, which made it difficult to conserve the structural and electrical properties for a long time (Fig. 2d).40
Besides the degradation and corrosion effects, the use of dopants also causes more complex device fabrications. The feeding ratio of the dopants and additive needs to be carefully optimized to achieve the best efficiency and stability. In the case of spiro-OMeTAD, Meng's group declared the realization of the best solar cell performance using 4:1 (molar ratio) t-BP:LiTFSI mixtures rather than the empirical value of 6:1.38 In practice, the amount of oxidized HTMs is not equal to the added dopants amount. Precise quantifying protocols are thus desired and proposed to precisely determine the radical cations in the HTL. Forward et al. built a calibration curve on the basis of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra, using which the effective doping can be calculated.45 Although some stable PVSC devices with doped HTMs have been reported so far, the development of dopant-free HTMs is an efficient and fascinating strategy for promoting the commercialization of PVSCs.46–48
3. Design principles of dopant-free HTMs
To achieve high-efficiency and stable PVSC devices, we need to understand the main sources of efficiency and stability losses before designing molecular structures. We divide HTM-related impacts on devices into three aspects: carrier extraction and transport, interfacial non-radiative recombinations, and chemical reactions of perovskites. The corresponding design principles of dopant-free organic molecules are summarized in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Design principles of dopant-free organic molecules. 
3.1 Hole extraction and transport
When organic molecules are coated onto the perovskite surface, an organic–inorganic interface is formed. Owing to the high hole mobility of perovskites (100–102 cm2 V−1 s−1),49 the light-induced holes quickly transfer to the perovskite/HTL interface. They will accumulate at the interface if HTMs cannot be extracted and transport these holes in time, resulting in serious non-radiative recombination losses. Therefore, designing an ideal HTM that can efficiently extract and transport holes is the first consideration to improve the device efficiency.

3.1.1 Energy level matching. 
In PVSCs, HTMs are expected to selectively extract and transport the holes while blocking the electrons.19 The built-in electric field generated by the energy level difference at the hybrid interfaces is the main driving force for hole extraction.50 Therefore, it is important for HTMs to have energy levels matching with those of the perovskite layers. Generally, HTMs should possess appropriately higher HOMO energy levels than the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskites, while its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are shallower than the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the perovskites.19 Based on the experience, a HOMO energy level about 0.15–0.25 eV higher than the VBM of perovskite is beneficial for dopant-free HTM to extract the holes.51–55 When the energy level difference is too large, an energy spike will be formed to hinder the hole extraction.56 A small energy level difference will make the generated carriers unable to be transferred out in time, whose accumulation at the interfaces results in self-recombination and trap-captured recombination.50
The energy levels of organic HTMs greatly depend on not only the electron density across the entire π-conjugated backbone but also the delocalization of π electrons.27 Therefore, researchers can feasibly modulate the energy levels of the organic HTMs with careful molecular engineering on the given promising structures. The experiences can learn from the design of organic materials for various optoelectronic devices (i.e., organic solar cells,57,58 dye-sensitized solar cells, and59–61 field-effect transistors62). In principle, the introduction of electron-donating functionalities (such as –N–, –O–, –S–, and alkyl chains) onto conjugated backbones can afford an increase in the HOMO energy levels, while the incorporation of electron-withdrawing groups (i.e., –F, –Cl-like halogen atoms, and –CN) leads to reduced LUMO energy levels.27 To better evaluate the energy levels of the designed molecules before synthesis, we can conduct theoretical simulation with density functional theory to screen suitable substituents to regulate both the molecular conformation and orbital energy levels, aiming to develop efficient HTMs alternates to spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA.


3.1.2 High intrinsic hole mobility. 
High intrinsic hole mobility is the priority consideration in HTM design for efficient hole extraction and transport to electrodes. Though spiro-OMeTAD possesses matching energy levels (HOMO/LUMO = −5.2/−2.1 eV) with most perovskites, its undoped HTMs endow PVSCs with relatively low PCEs (<13%) in almost all cases.63 This highlights the importance of high intrinsic hole mobility for dopant-free HTMs. Generally, dopant-free HTMs requires a hole mobility as high as 10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for n–i–p type PVSCs. For p–i–n devices, however, the reduced transport length due to the much thinner HTMs layer allows relatively less stringent requirement for the hole mobility, i.e., some HTMs with hole mobilities even lower than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (<10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) can still work efficiently.31 Furthermore, the conductivity of HTMs is closely associated with the series resistance in PVSCs, which particularly affects the fill factor (FF) at high current densities. Neher et al. identified the carrier transit time through the organic hole transport layer as the bottleneck in efficient charge extraction.64 They fabricated stable PVSCs using ultrathin undoped PTAA layers and capped the (CsPbI3)0.05[(FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17]0.95 perovskite with C60 as the ETL, which contributed high FFs up to 84% and PCEs over 20% for 6 mm2-sized pixels and 18.9% for 1 cm2 devices. At the present, the improvement of the FF values is regarded as an effective approach to push the efficiency of the PVSCs toward the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limitation.65
Unlike inorganic semiconductors, organic molecules possess many intermolecular interactions in the solid state such as van der Waals force, hydrogen bonding, dipole–dipole interactions, or π–π interactions.66 Their molecular conformation and stacking behaviors in thin films thus directly determine the intra- and intermolecular charge transfer. Planar conjugated systems can enhance intermolecular electronic coupling through effective π-orbital overlapping, thereby facilitating charge transfer between the molecules. To meet the need for cost-effective solution-processing techniques, researchers are keen to develop organic semiconductors with careful molecular engineering on conjugate backbone, side chains, or linkage to modulate the intermolecular interactions and thus their molecular orientation and aggregation behaviors in solid states.67–70 Importantly, the introduction of heteroatoms into conjugated systems is found be effective for inducing non-covalent interactions for π–π stacking in thin films, which is beneficial for charge transport in optoelectronic devices. For instance, HTMs adopting dominant face-on orientation in π–π stacked film can facilitate vertical hole transport across the HTL to electrodes (or perovskite) in planar n–i–p (or p–i–n) PVSCs (Fig. 4a).71

Besides molecular orientation, the crystallinity and solubility of organic semiconductors should be carefully controlled since they are closely related to their hole mobility and film-forming ability. The molecules with strong crystallinity tend to form films with pinholes, resulting in deficient interfacial contact and decreased shunt resistance (Rsh). To balance the charge transport and film quality, Li et al. proposed a symmetry lowering strategy by replacing the spiro-core of spiro-OMeTAD with the spirobisindane core, where the resultant twisted V-shaped HTMs formed uniform pinhole-free films with suppressed crystallinity and decreased hole mobility.48 Zhu's group established a molecular locking strategy using a semi-locked tetrathienylethene (TTE) core to replace the spiro-core of spiro-OMeTAD for well modulating the molecular planarity.51 Featuring both orthogonal and planar conformation, the TTE-cored HTM exhibits a deep HOMO (−5.30 eV), high Tg (158 °C), and hole mobility (6.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Its doping-free HTM-based PVSCs with the structure of glass/ITO/SnO2/(FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05/HTM/Au exhibits a highest PCE of 20.04%, with a open-circuit circuit (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.26 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.77. The unencapsulated device retained 85% of its original PCEs after 1000 h storage under the ambient air with a humidity of 35% at 20–25 °C.

3.2 The interfacial non-radiative recombinations
The best efficiency of single-junction PVSC is still below the S–Q limit because of the non-radiative recombination losses, which are linked to the defect-assisted recombination. However, the defects in the perovskite crystals, especially polycrystals, are inevitable during solution-processing fabrication. Environmental factors such as moisture and heat would give rise to the reorganization and irregularity because of the weak interaction between the ionic components.72 With respect to the defect density, the value of polycrystalline perovskite film is of the magnitude of 1016–1018 cm−3, which is much larger than that of typical crystalline Si (108 cm−3).73 Most of these defects are zero-dimensional point defects, including vacancies, interstitials, and anti-site substitutions. Take MAPbI3 as an example; the possible point defects are MA (VMA), Pb (VPb), and I (VI) vacancies, MAi, Pbi, and Ii interstitials, and MAPb, PbMA, MAI, PbI, IMA, and IPb anti-site substitutions.74 On the basis of the state of the energy level in the band gap, they can be further divided into shallow- and deep-level defects, where shallow-level defects lie in the positions near the VBM or VBM, whereas the deep-level defects are in the middle transition levels within the band gap.75 These defects, especially the deep-level defects, are prone to trap photogenerated carriers and decrease the charge density in the steady state, thereby reducing the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels of the electrons and holes and lowering the VOC.76 The deep-level point defects of MAPbI3 are IPb, IMA, Pbi, PbI, and VI.74 As for the all-inorganic perovskites α-CsPbI2Br, which is the mainstream among the family of CsPbX3, there are six kinds of deep-level point defects, namely, PbBr, PbI, ICs, IPb, BrCs, and BrPb.77 In addition, defects on the surface and at the grain boundaries also affect the extraction efficiency of the carriers, resulting in decreased JSC and FF.78 Moreover, the migration and accumulation of defects under an electric field also cause a series of negative effects, such as band bending,79,80 phase separation,81–83 and hysteresis.84,85
To minimize the trap-assisted recombinations, understanding the distribution of defects and their suppression methods is necessary. Studies have shown that the trap density at the interface is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that inside the perovskite film.86–88 For instance, Stolterfoht et al. used transient and absolute photoluminescence imaging to visualize non-radiative recombination pathways in planar PVSCs with the architecture of ITO (150 nm)/PTAA (8 nm)/CsPbI0.05[(FAPbI3)0.89(MAPbBr3)0.11]0.95 (400–500 nm)/C60 (30 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Cu (100 nm). Their study revealed that interfacial recombination resulted in an additional free energy loss of 80 meV at each individual interface, which limited the VOC of the complete cell (Fig. 4b). They further optimized the cell performance (average 18–20% improvement in PCEs) through an increase in VOC and FF by inserting an ultrathin PFN-P2 interlayer between the perovskite and PTAA; on the other hand, an ultrathin LiF interlayer was inserted between perovskite and C60. The carriers' lifetimes were found to be significantly elongated and the interfacial losses were thus dramatically suppressed at both the p and n contacts (Fig. 4c and d).88 Very recently, Ni et al. used drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) technology to accurately measure the spatial and energetic distributions of the trap states in planar PVSC with the structure of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Cu.87 A symmetric distribution of the trap density was observed and the trap density near the interface region was found to be ∼10-fold higher than that inside the MAPbI3 single crystal (Fig. 4e), indicating that the dangling bonds on the surface formed the charge traps.
Due to the ionic character of the perovskite lattice, defects are always positively or negatively charged. This enables defect passivation approaches through interaction between the functional groups and defects on the basis of the Lewis acid–base theory. The defects and the corresponding passivation strategies are shown in Fig. 5a.65 The defects in the perovskite may include point defects (i.e., interstitials, MA or I vacancies, and Pd–I antisites), 2D extended defects on surface and grain boundaries (i.e., undercoordinated I− or Pd2+ ions), and 3D defects (i.e., iodine or lead cluster). For example, undercoordinated I ions and Pb–I antisite defects result in negatively charged defects that can then be passivated by a Lewis acid through coordinate bonding or by cations through ionic bonding; undercoordinated Pb2+ has the ability to accept electrons and can be passivated by Lewis bases or anions.89 Until now, various strategies have been used for the purpose of defect passivation, where most of these works have been devoted to passivate uncoordinated Pd2+. The electron-rich heteroatoms with unpaired electrons in the molecule can passivate the defects by forming strong coordination with Pb2+, thereby further increasing VOC and FF. In addition, the surface passivation treatments are able to trigger the band bending at the interface, promoting the interfacial hole extraction.90–92

Lessons learned from the defect engineering can guide us to design novel HTMs that form special interactions with perovskites to passivate the surface defects. As shown in Fig. 5b, the functionalities include pyridine,93 carbonyl,94–97 amino,98 and halogen,99 which serve as the interaction sites for reducing the defect density. By integrating them into the chemical structures of organic HTMs, we can avoid the use of additional passivators. For example, Zhu et al. intentionally introduced Lewis base-type pyridine units into polymer HTMs, which effectively passivated the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects on the surface of the perovskite film.100 In the absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using pyridine-based polymer HTM delivered an encouraging PCE up to 22.41% with a small VOC loss (0.40 V).
It should be pointed out that integrating the interaction sites into HTMs can not only passivate the interface defects but also has an impact on the molecular orientations at the interface, thereby affecting the charge transfer at the interface. For instance, Nazeeruddin et al. developed a simple dissymmetric fluorene-dithiophene-cored HTM FDT, which showed an additional interaction between the dithiophene FDT core and the perovskite surface in comparison to spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 5c).101 This allowed a stronger adhesion and enhanced interfacial coupling between the HTMs and the perovskite, which is favorable for effective hole transport at the interface. As a result, the FDT hole transporter reached a high PCE of 20.2% for the mixed perovskite. Recently, the peripheral substitutes were reported to affect the stacking of spiro-OMeTAD analogs on the perovskite surface.102 Contributing to the introduction of fluorine atoms at the methoxyphenyl groups, the folded structure can be modulated and the adsorption state of the HTM molecules on the perovskite was tailored by the steric hindrance. As depicted in Fig. 5d, fluorene and phenyl groups of spiro-mF adsorb together on the perovskite surface, which is favorable for effective hole transport. The fabricated PVSCs with spiro-mF as HTM featured a high PCE up to 24.82%, along with long-term stability in wet conditions without encapsulation (87% efficiency retention after 500 h).
3.3 Chemical reactions of perovskites
With the rapid progress in the efficiency, the device stability is becoming ever-increasingly important to address whether PVSCs are able to reach commercial deployment. The stability of perovskite materials in photovoltaic technology are unsatisfactory. Under prolonged exposure to harsh real-world conditions, the environmental factors have dramatic influence on the stability of PVSCs. As discussed in Section 2.1, the intrusion of external moisture will cause the degradation of the perovskite. This requires the HTM, especially in the n–i–p structure, to have good hydrophobicity to protect the underlying perovskite. Snaith et al. reported the method to enhance the water resistance of HTM by functionalizing the molecule with alkyl chains, which allow for both a high material solubility in useful solvents and a high hydrophobicity.104 Regardless of the influence of moisture, the heat accumulation inside the device, which can be conducted from the outside environment or generated by the solar cell assembly, is difficult to be controlled. Organic semiconductor with a low Tg tends to undergo a thermal transition from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase at high temperatures, which has been established to be responsible for the poor device thermal stability.44,105 Therefore, a high Tg is desirable for developing robust PVSCs in the practical applications. In this respect, reducing the symmetry of the molecule and using rigid fused units (such as carbazole) to replace the triphenylamine (TPA) end groups are proven to be effective methods to realize thermostable HTMs.44,106–109
4. Dopant-free small organic HTMs
To get rid of the dependence on dopants, HTM needs to have relatively high intrinsic hole mobility and conductivity. This requires the molecule to have a suitable configuration to realize good inter- and intra-molecular interactions. TPA and its derivatives are preferably applied as the terminal groups of the HTMs due to their inexpensive synthesis, good solubility, and ease of forming positively charged holes. In this context, the design of suitable molecular frameworks is of vital importance to construct ideal dopant-free HTMs. In recent years, many dopant-free HTMs with modified spirobifluorene skeleton or new twisted core have been developed.110–112 Numerous planar conjugated building blocks, which exhibit efficient π-orbital overlap, have also showed great potential in developing new materials.113,114 In order to reduce the non-radiative recombination losses, selecting construction units containing heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.) to enhance the interactions between the HTM and the perovskite has become an important idea for the development of high-efficiency dopant-free HTMs.52,53,55 In this section, we focus on the recent progress of dopant-free small organic HTMs based on the choice of conjugated building blocks, together with various chemical modifications on the side substitutes, conjugation extension, and end-capping units. The chemical structures of typical HTMs are shown in Fig. 6, 7, 10, and 12, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The structure–property relationship between the molecular structures and the photovoltaic properties will be elucidated emphatically.

4.1 HTMs with spatially twisted skeletons
Due to the large intermolecular distance caused by spirobifluorene skeleton, spiro-OMeTAD suffers from low intrinsic hole mobility and conductivity. The complex synthetic steps and hard purification also render it with a high-cost preparation and limit large-scale application.115 To improve the hole mobility, modify the energy levels, and simplify the preparation of HTMs, several attempts have been made to fine-tune the spirobifluorene core of spiro-OMeTAD.
Liao et al. developed a twisted HTM SAF-OMe by incorporating the main unit of PTAA (N-benzene-N structure) into the spiro-structure.110 While the high solubility and thermal stability are inherited by SAF-OMe, the new material also displayed better hole-transporting ability compared to PTAA and less aggregation, favoring charge transport and film-formation. As a result, dopant-free SAF-OMe realized a PCE of 12.39%, much high than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (5.91%). Fan and co-workers inserted one carbonyl group into the spirobifluorene framework of spiro-OMeTAD and got a novel phenanthrenone-based HTM spiro-PTOMeTAD.116 The introduction of one carbonyl group not only increased the stiffness of the skeleton, leading to improved thermal stability, but also expanded the conjugation range and enhanced the hole mobility of HTM. Hence, spiro-PT-OMeTAD-based PVSC yielded a PCE of 13.83%, while spiro-OMeTAD only delivered a PCE of 10.5%. A fluorinated spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]-based HTM 2mF-X59, which delivered a dopant-free PCE of 15.45% in MAPbI3 PVSC, was reported by Wang's group.117 The introduction of F atoms into the framework effectively decreased the HOMO energy level and increased the hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the molecule. Benefiting from the removal of dopants, 2mF-X59-based PVSCs showed good long-term stability, maintaining 95% of their initial PCEs for more than 500 h under air exposure. They further introduced the naphthalene group into spiro-[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] to construct X62.63 Because of the increased conjugation system, X62 showed more efficient π–π stacking, thus enhancing the charge transport ability. The corresponding PVSCs based on X62 achieved a PCE of 15.96% without the dopants, outperforming that of spiro-OMeTAD (10.84%).
In addition to modifying the orthogonal skeleton of spiro-OMeTAD, researchers have also developed other conjugated skeletons with twisted structures. Grätzel et al. synthesized a novel HTM using the 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene] derivative (spiro-CPDT) as the core and TPA as the end groups.111 The resulted HTM 1 exhibited a suitable HOMO energy level (−5.0 eV) and comparable hole mobility to spiro-OMeTAD (3.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Coupled with the good film forming property, it yielded a PCE of 13.4% in MAPbI3-based PVSCs without the use of any dopants. A twisted HTM PST1 comprising spiro-bipropylenedioxythiophene as the spiro-type core and TPA as the terminal units was developed by Nazeeruddin's group.118 Although the four carbon atoms directly connecting to the spiro carbon do not lie in a plane, the two thiophene rings and four oxygen atoms are almost coplanar due to two seven-membered alkylenedioxy rings are large enough to smooth away the distortion. This quasi-planar core endowed PST1 stronger intermolecular interaction than that of spiro-OMeTAD, thus showing superior charge transport ability (Fig. 8a and b). The implementation of PST1 in n–i–p PVSCs exhibited a dopant-free PCE of 12.74%. Based on the N,N′-bicarbazole building block, which possesses a perpendicular twisted kernel similar to 9,9′-spirobifluorene, and two inexpensive HTMs 3,6 BCzOMeTAD and 2,7 BCzOMeTAD were synthesized.119 Featured with the twisted structure, both of them exhibited suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent film-formation abilities. With only ≈30 nm thick 3,6 BCz-OMeTAD and 2,7 BCz-OMeTAD, 1 cm2 Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16PbI2.49Br0.51 PVSCs achieved high PCEs up to 17.0% and 17.6%, respectively. Using cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) as the core, Li et al. developed a saddle-shaped HTM α, β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD.120 Compared with the rigid spirobifluorene in spiro-OMeTAD, COTh is a more flexible saddle-shaped structure, which leads to better interactions with the perovskite. The S atoms contained in α, β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD can serve as Lewis bases to react with the perovskites, reducing the surface defects of the perovskite film and enhancing the stability of the whole device (Fig. 8c and d). As expected, mesoporous PVSCs with α, β-COTh-Ph-OMeTAD exhibited a high PCE of 17.22%, a little higher than that of devices based on doped spiro-OMeTAD (16.83%).
By integrating the 1,3-dioxane moiety at the sp3-hybridized C9 atom of fluorine, Berlinguette and coworkers developed a novel HTM called as DFH, which showed strong intermolecular C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions between the neighboring dioxane groups, as revealed by X-ray crystallographic results (Fig. 8e).121 The redox-active TPA groups in this material were drawn close to each other without the growth of large crystals, which are responsible for the high hole mobility of ∼1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the annealed films. Powder XRD confirmed that the crystallization of this molecule began to occur at 120 °C (Fig. 8f). After annealing at 135 °C, a PCE over 20% for inverted MA0.9FA0.1PbI3−xClx PVSCs was realized. Recently, a spirofluorene-based HTM (SFDT-TDM) comprising methylthiol (–SMe) as the end groups was designed by Zhu et al.112 Compared with the common spirobifluorene core, spirofluorene-dithiolane exhibited less steric hindrance and enhanced C–H⋯π interactions in adjacent molecules (Fig. 8g), thus showing high hole mobility of 1.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the –SMe groups featuring negative charges served as Lewis bases to coordinate with the Pb2+ defects, facilitating the interface charge transport and reducing non-radiative recombination losses. As such, SFDT-TDM realized PCEs of 21.7% and 20.3% for small-area (0.04 cm2) and large-area (1.0 cm2) CsxFA1−xPbI3 devices, respectively.
On the basis of the tetraphenylethylene core, Ke et al. synthesized a simple twisted HTM with four TPA units.122 The as-obtained TPE possessed a slightly shallower HOMO level (−4.99 eV) and a higher thermal stability (Tg = 159 °C) in comparison to spiro-OMeTAD. For the PVSC devices with mixed-cation MA/FA tin iodide as the light absorbers, dopant-free TPE afforded a PCE of 7.23%. This result surpassed the value of those devices based on doped PTAA (6.67%) and doped spiro-OMeTAD (5.20%). Similar to SFDT-TDM, the strategy of using –SMe as the end groups is also applied to the tetraphenylethylene core, resulting in a new HTM TPE-S.123 The electrostatic potential surface image demonstrated more negative charges distributed at the S atoms, which can serve as the Lewis base anchors to passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Besides, the strong interaction with perovskite enabled TPE-S to modulate the crystallinity of the perovskite and facilitate the formation of dense, high-quality perovskite polycrystalline. As a result, excellent PCEs of 15.4% and 21% were yielded from inorganic (CsPbI2Br) and hybrid (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3) inverted PVSCs, respectively. Furthermore, TPE-S-based device showed superior photo-stability without encapsulation, retaining 82% of its initial PCE under the stimulated sunlight for 400 h.
4.2 HTMs with planar conjugated skeletons

4.2.1 HTMs with carbon aromatic cores. 
Unlike the spatially twisted skeleton, the planar conjugated core contributes to enhance the molecular stacking in the solid films and improve the intrinsic hole mobility. The flexible alkyl chains or rigid conjugated branches are usually introduced to improve the solubility and film-forming properties of the molecules. Among numerous organic building blocks, aromatic-fused fluorine is one of the most promising building blocks for synthesizing conjugated materials due to its good thermal and chemical stability, high solubility in common organic solvents, and low cost. The adjustable structure makes it possible to control the solubility and accumulation of the molecules by introducing different branches into the conjugated skeleton. As shown in Fig. 7, many dopant-free HTMs were developed based on fluorine. To broaden the library of materials, other aromatic fused-rings with larger conjugated units, such as fluoranthene, cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene, anthanthrone, and truxene are also employed as the building blocks to develop inexpensive HTMs.

Getautis and co-workers used fluorene as the central scaffold to construct inexpensive HTMs with the synthetic cost of approximately few euros per gram through a one-pot reaction.124 The synthesized V1275 exhibited a high hole mobility of up to 3.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a suitable HOMO energy level of −5.39 eV, enabling the fabricated PVSCs to realize PCEs of 19.3% and 17.1% with/without dopants. Sonar et al. developed a fluorine-based HTM TPA-2,7-FLTPA-TPA by selectively substituting TPA on the 9,9-bis(4-diphenylaminophenyl)fluorene core.125 By introducing aromatic groups into the sp3-hybridized C9 atom of fluorine, they successfully enhanced the solubility and thermal stability of the materials. Owing to the linear conjugated structure, the resultant TPA-2,7-FLTPA-TPA showed a suitable HOMO energy level of −5.45 eV and good hole transport ability, which enabled it to deliver 17.1% PCE in p–i–n PVSC without any dopants. Another fluorine-based example was VB-MeO-FDPA, which contains side vinyl groups on the fluorene core. Under mild conditions, it can be cross-linked to form 3D networks.126 This not only improved the solvent resistance of HTL but also the morphological stability. As such, it showed an impressive PCE value of 18.7% in MAPbI3−xClx-based p–i–n PVSCs with a JSC of 20.89 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.15 V, and an FF of 77.8%, together with negligible electrical hysteresis and excellent stability. Recently, Yip et al. utilized electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole to bridge fluorene with two TPA ending moieties and thus obtained DTB-FL.54 Single crystal structure analysis and grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) depicted a lamellar packing structure of the fluorene core that was favorable for charge transport (Fig. 8h). Furthermore, both the S and N atoms in benzothiadiazole could donate the lone pair electrons to the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+via the coordination interactions, minimizing the trap states and thus reducing the trap-induced interfacial recombination. The corresponding trap density was significantly decreased from (7.47 ± 1.43) × 1015 cm−3 for spiro-OMeTAD covered perovskites to (2.25 ± 0.67) × 1015 cm−3 for DTB-FL-based samples. As expected, a high PCE of 21.5% (average PCE of 20.9 ± 0.4%) with a simultaneous increase in the VOC of 1.14 V, JSC of 23.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.1% was observed for DTB-FL-based Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 devices. In addition, DTB-FL can also be used as an efficient HTM for all-inorganic CsPbI3−xBrx-based PVSCs, providing an impressive PCE of 17.0% with a high VOC of 1.30 V. More importantly, the as-fabricated device also exhibited long-term stability due to the good molecular hydrophobicity, which was far superior to the spiro-OMeTAD-based device.

Ding et al. reported a linear molecule FMT comprising two hexyl chains at the C9 atom of fluorene and two peripheral methylthiophenylamines.127 The methylthiol groups, rather than the methoxy groups, were beneficial for lowering the HOMO energy level of the corresponding HTM (−4.89 eV for FMT). Besides, the methylthio groups can also induce the formation of homogeneous films by interacting with the perovskites, leading to a increase in the PCE from 15.15% for the freshly prepared device to 19.06% after 24 h storage (Fig. 9a and b). If the C9 atom of fluorene is modified into the sp2-hybridized conformation, the planarity and molecular stacking will be enhanced. Accordingly, YC-1 was synthesized based on the dibenzofulvene core by varying the number of terminal methoxy groups on the three TPA units.128 In the absence of methoxy groups, a high Tg (124 °C) and a suitable HOMO energy level (−5.28 eV) were realized for YC-1. When it was employed as the bottom layer, micrometer-sized perovskites were allowed to grow on its surface (Fig. 9c). In an inverted device combining YC-1 and inorganic NiOx, the champion PCE was as high as 19.37%. Besides, the as-fabricated device can afford 96.3% efficiency retention after storage in air and dark for over 1000 h (Fig. 9d).

Fluoranthene is a typical cyclopentene-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which exhibits a rigid planarized structure that can favor enhanced π–π stacking. Li's group developed an HTM, called BTF4, by adopting 2,3-dicyano-fluoranthene as the building block.129 The introduction of cyano substitutes into the fluoranthene core not only endowed the molecule with more suitable energy levels but also enabled highly ordered and strong molecular packing in the solid state, both of which could facilitate hole extraction and transport. Thus, with dopant-free BTF4, an efficiency of 18.03% and 17.01% was realized for the planar n–i–p and p–i–n devices, respectively. Subsequently, they systematically investigated the structure–property correlation of the fluoranthene-based HTMs by tuning the structural geometry (linear vs. branched), connection between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties (single bond vs. ethylene), and the substitution position of the methoxy side-groups (para- vs. meta-).130 The results showed that replacing DPA with TPA as the capping unit of the D–A type HTMs can effectively down-shift the HOMO energy levels, whilst introducing ethylene as the connecting π-bridge can increase the hole mobility due to enhanced π–π interactions. With the highest hole mobility (2.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), deepest HOMO level (−5.07 eV), and excellent antioxidant capacity and film-forming ability (Fig. 9e), FBA3 was thus able to afford a champion PCE of 19.27% in the n–i–p PVSC, outperforming that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (17.57%). The cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene possesses a larger fused structure than fluoranthene, which can enhance the electron delocalization and intermolecular π–π interactions, leading to the superior charge transport ability. Based on cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene, YN3 was successfully acquired.131 The authors demonstrated its good generality as hole extractors for both hybrid (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and all-inorganic CsPbI2Br absorbers, achieving an efficiency of 18.84% and 12.15%, respectively. Similarly, pyrene, which possesses four fused benzene rings, was also used as the skeleton of HTM.
By introducing N4-[4-[bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino]phenyl]-N1,N1-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-benzenediamine to the 1,6- and 2,7-positions of the pyrene core, Wang et al. investigated the position effect of the arylamine branches on pyrene-based HTM.132 Theoretical calculation results showed that 1,6-substituted PYR16 possessed smaller dihedral angles, lower level of planarity, and a more polarized structure compared with the 1,6-substituted counterpart, which endowed it with better film formation, lower HOMO energy level, and higher hole mobility. As expected, the PYR16-based n–i–p PVSC achieved a PCE of 17.00% without any dopants, much higher than that based on 2,7-substituted HTM-based (14.67%). Furthermore, PYR16 also had a relatively high Tg (142 °C) because of its rigid pyrene core and large molecular weight, enabling its devices to maintain 98% of the initial values after 1080 h at 80 °C in an ambient environment. Sonar et al. chose anthanthrone dye as the building block on account of its high molar absorption coefficient, facile structural tuning, easy charge carrier mobility modulation, and simple synthesis.133 Then, 1,2-dihydroacenaphthylene (ACE) as well as TPA were introduced as the end capping groups to regulate the energy levels and charge transport properties of the molecules. The resultant TPA-ANT-TPA with TPA end groups showed a suitable HOMO energy level (−5.41 eV) and high hole mobility (2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), delivering a champion efficiency of 17.5% in MAPbI3-based PVSCs. Chen and coworkers synthesized Trux-OMeTAD by modifying the planar truxene core with arylamine terminals and hexyl side-chains.134 The fully conjugated structure with a C3h geometry made it possess ordered assemblies for better charge transport in the solid state. After annealing at 150 °C, the hole mobility of the films was further improved to 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, thus facilitating the extraction of carriers at the interfaces. Furthermore, six aliphatic chains on the truxene core endowed Trux-OMeTAD with good hydrophobicity, which is beneficial for achieving high-quality perovskite films (Fig. 9f). As a result, in a MAPbI3-based inverted device, a high PCE of 18.6% was achieved together with minimal hysteresis (Fig. 9g).


4.2.2 HTMs with planar cores containing N or S. 
Heteroatoms such as S and N atoms in the aromatic rings can well tune the electronic properties of the organic semiconductors. Because of the unshared electron pairs, they can also act as Lewis bases to interact with Pb2+ in the perovskite layer, passivating defects, and reducing lead leakage. Motivated by these ideals, many dopant-free HTMs based on heteroatom fused-rings were developed (Fig. 10). Carbazole is a typical electron-donating fused ring due to the p-π conjugation effect of the sp2 equivalent hybridized N-atom. The introduction of the side chains on the N-atom can well adjust the solubility and film-forming properties of the molecules. Until now, this low-cost unit and its derivatives have been widely used to synthesize various HTMs. In addition to carbazole, many N-containing aromatic rings with a larger conjugation range, such as triazatruxene and 1,10-phenanthroline, have also proved to be good choices for HTM construction. Similarly, conjugated rings containing S or N, S, O heteroatoms have also been used to develop efficient HTMs, and show good defect passivation effects.

An A–D–A type HTM SY2 was recently developed with a carbazole as the donor core and amides as the acceptor units.135 The terminal amide groups in the molecule could play the role of bifacial passivation toward NiOx and perovskites, enhancing the crystal quality of the absorbers. Together with a gradient energy alignment at the interfaces of the NiOx/SY2/perovskite, SY2 as both HTM and the interface layer achieved an improved efficiency of 18.96% in p–i–n MAPbI3 PVSC. Recently, a self-assembled, methyl-substituted carbazole HTM Me-4PACz was reported by Al-Ashouri et al.136 Due to the phosphonic anchoring group, it can form densely packed, uniform monolayers on indium tin oxide (ITO). This not only shifted the work function of the ITO toward higher absolute numbers, resulting in a higher built-in potential throughout the device, but was also conducive for fast hole extraction at the interface (Fig. 11a and b). As a result, the p–i–n single-junction PVSC based on Me-4PACz achieved a PCE of 20.8%, with a VOC of up to 1.234 V, and an FF of up to 84%. More importantly, the single-junction improvements transferred into tandem devices, which allowed them to fabricate perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with a certified PCE of 29.15%. Indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) is a type of rigid conjugated electron-rich aromatic ring with facile synthesis, low cost, and flexible modification. On the basis of this building block, C202 was obtained via three-step reactions without using expensive catalysts.137 The introduction of two additional biphenylamino groups into the molecule improved its spatial configuration, thus enhancing its solubility and film-forming property. C202 capping layer exhibited a homogeneous and uniform surface morphology, which effectively reduced the charge recombination losses and facilitated the interfacial charge extraction. The optimized devices employing C202 as the dopant-free HTM delivered a PCE of up to 17.7%.

Nazeeruddin's group developed two star-shaped molecules FA-CN and TPA-CN by incorporating rigid quinolizino acridine or flexible TPA cores with thiophene bridges and malononitrile terminals.138 Because of the good planarity of the rigid core, FA-CN possessed close intermolecular π–π stacking and thus a higher hole mobility (1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the as-resulting films. As a comparison, an optimized efficiency of 18.9% was received by FA-CN, higher than that of TPA-CN-based devices (17.5%). Impressively, the maximum power output of the FA-CN-based device retained 65% of its initial value after 1300 h of continuous light soaking, which is superior to the device employing doped spiro-OMeTAD (15%). In the same year, they developed another planar core triazatruxene to get KR321 and investigated the influence of the π-bridges between the triazatruxene donor and the malononitrile acceptors.139 Owing to the different conjugation extension structure, the self-assembly characteristics of the as-synthesized molecules varied significantly. GIWAXS revealed face-on organization with a smallest d-spacing of 0.38 nm for KR321, which was favorable for the fast vertical charge carrier transport. Together with the suitable HOMO energy level, KR321-based (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PVSC achieved a high PCE of 19%. To overcome the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 caused by doped HTM, they replaced the malononitriles of KR321 with a fluorinated Lewis base, 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IN–2F), to develop a new D–π–A type molecule CI-TTIN-2F and applied it as a dopant-free HTM in inorganic CsPbI3 PVSCs.140 Featured with the D–A structure, CI-TTIN-2F exhibited strong intramolecular charge transfer and dipolar intermolecular interactions, facilitating hole extraction and transmission. Moreover, various heteroatoms (N, O, S, F) in the molecule also endowed CI-TTIN-2F multisite defect passivation effects on the surface of the CsPbI3 films, effectively reducing the interfacial defects and non-radiative recombination losses. As a result, all-inorganic CsPbI3 PVSCs with CI-TTIN-2F achieved impressive PCEs of 15.9% on small-area devices and 11.0% on modules with a record area of 27 cm2.
The basic sites of pyrrole can efficiently coordinate with the exposed Pb2+ sites.141 Kim et al. demonstrated the feasibility of metal-free H2-phthalocyanine (Pc) as the dopant-free HTMs in n–i–p PVSCs.142 Compared to the devices applying metal phthalocyanine CuPc, the Pc-based device showed better hole extraction and higher VOC due to the interactions between the pyrrole units' inner ring and uncoordinated Pb2+ sites (Fig. 11c). As a result, the optimized efficiency of 20.1% was observed in the Pc-based PVSC, which was 2% higher than that of CuPc-based one. Moreover, the encapsulated Pc-based devices could withstand thermal-humid environment (85 °C – 85%) for 1000 h. Pyridine is another commonly used functionality in those molecules that can passivate the surface defects.143 It is attractive for us to synthesize the molecules containing pyridine moieties for constructing strong interfacial interactions with perovskites.100 1,10-Phenanthroline containing two adjacent pyridines is a widely used ligand for heavy metal ions, e.g., Pd2+ and Pb2+. Loo and coworkers synthesized two novel HTMs YZ18 and YZ22 by linking 1,10-phenanthroline/phenanthrene with TPA groups.52 The coordination effect of pyridine N on Pb2+ on the surface of Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 (CsFAPbI) was elaborately characterized by GIWAXS and XPS (Fig. 11d and e). The out-of-plane line cuts of these GIWAXS profiles for YZ22/CsFAPbI revealed that new reflections appeared at qz (q vector along out-of-plane) due to the strong complexation between YZ22 and Pb2+. This phenomenon cannot be observed for perovskite coated with phenanthrene cored molecule YZ18. The XPS depth profiling of the Pb 4f core level only showed the peaks associated with the fully coordinated Pb2+ for YZ22/CsFAPbI, while the undercoordinated Pb2+ peaks were observed in the control sample. Consequently, the PVSCs with YZ22 exhibited a champion PCE of 22.4%, representing the highest value among the PVSCs using small organic dopant-free HTMs. Furthermore, the strong interfacial interactions and the absence of dopants enabled an efficiency retention of over 60% for the YZ22-based device after 1000 hours of operation, while the doped spiro-OMeTAD device decreased to 10% under the same conditions.
Aromatic rings containing S atoms (e.g., thiophene) are charming building blocks for organic semiconductors with high conductivity. The S atoms can serve as Lewis bases to form coordination bonds with the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, thereby passivating the surface defects of the perovskites.144 Feng et al. reported a thienoacene-based molecule DPh-DNTT, which delivered a remarkable PCE of 20.2% for the MAPbI3-based p–i–n device.71 The molecular orientation was modulated to the face-on orientation with strong π–π interactions along the substrate normal by controlling the substrate-temperature from 160 °C to 25 °C. As a result, the as-prepared film showed five times enhanced intrinsic hole mobility of 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the out-of-plane direction, outperforming the HTMs reported so far. Besides, the molecular hydrophobicity and the strong S–Pb coordination at the interface also endowed the resultant PVSCs with superior long-term ambient stability (retaining 90% PCE retention, 45 d, 60 ± 10% relative humidity (RH), in dark). Simple XY1 was synthesized by decorating four TPA units on a fused thieno[2,3-b]thiophene core.145 The twisted molecular structure caused by the crowded substitutes contributed to a good solubility and a high Tg (223 °C). The interfacial interactions with the perovskites enabled a more smooth surface of the absorber layers than PEDOT:PSS. Consequently, the inverted PVSC devices using XY1 as the dopant-free HTMs demonstrated a VOC of 1.11 V and a hysteresis-free PCE up to 18.78%. The original efficiency can be maintained as 95% after light soaking for 200 h, indicating the substantially improved operational stability. A large-area (aperture 1.00 cm2) device also showed an excellent PCE of 17.82%. In addition to the adjustment of the conjugated cores, the introduction of S with the passivation function in the end groups is also a method to develop new HTMs. DBTMT, which has a dibenzo[b,d]thiophene core with four methylthio-terminated diphenylamine arms, was reported to be a dopant-free for the inverted MAPbI3 devices.146 The rich sulfur atoms in the molecules can strongly interact with the perovskite components, controlling the perovskite crystal growth. As expected, a champion PCE value of 21.12% was achieved with an FF of 83.25%.
Several small organic HTMs were developed based on the weak electron-donating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) unit. Cheng et al. developed M7-TFSI by performing the terminal ionization toward the end-capped pyridine units based on the BDT core, which lead to improved hole mobility and conductivity.147 Accordingly, the device efficiency was increased from 13.5% for neutral reference molecule to 17.7% for M7-TFSI. Due to the higher hydrophobicity of M7-TFSI, the corresponding devices showed better stability than that of the spiro-OMeTAD-based ones. Li et al. tailored the conjugated side chains on the BDT-TPA backbone to carefully control the molecular conformation.148 The planar BDT-TPA-sTh showed favorable parallel-displaced π–π stacking effects and additional S–π weak-bond supramolecular interactions in the solid states, thus achieving increased hole mobility. Its marginal solubility enabled the inverse diffusion into the perovskite precursor solution for assisting the absorber film growth as revealed by the depth-dependent element profiles. The p–i–n PVSCs exhibited a champion PCE of 17.83% and 20.5% for the absorbers of MAPbI3 and FA0.81MA0.10Cs0.04PbI2.55Br0.40, respectively, accompanied with poor thickness-photovoltaic dependence. Furthermore, a large-area modularized device (1 cm2) with blade-coated BDT-TPA-sTh as the HTM achieved an efficiency up to 15.30%. On the basis of the BDT unit, another group used the fluorine-methoxytriphenylamine hybrid strategy to further adjust the characteristics of the material, and applied them as HTMs in the p–i–n devices.149 The introduction of the strong electron-withdrawing F atoms was found to lower the HOMO energy level of HTM while it increased the hole mobility by an order of magnitude. Due to the interactions with perovskite, F atoms also created a better contact at the HTM/perovskite interface, enabling the growth of high-quality perovskite active layer. Hence, the H2-based PVSC exhibited an excellent PCE of 18.69% with a negligible hysteresis, approaching the record PCE value for conventional MAPbI3 PVSCs with dopant-free small molecular HTMs. Two BDT-based D–π–D molecules BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ were synthesized by Chen et al. by connecting N-(6-bromohexyl)phenothiazine (PTZ)/N-(6-bromohexyl)phenoxazine (POZ) as the donor units.99 The terminal bromohexyl groups facilitated the ordered assembly through the dipole–dipole interactions between the molecules, resulting in diverse packing tendencies. Meanwhile, the lone pair of electrons of the bromine atoms were anticipated to efficiently passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions (Fig. 11f). Consequently, inverted PVSCs using BDT-PTZ and BDT-POZ as the HTMs achieved a PCE of 18.26% and 19.16%, respectively. Recently, they further presented an ingenious strategy to develop self-assembled HTM using 4,8-di(n-hexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as the π-linker and 10-bromohexyl-10H-phenoxazine as the end groups.113 With bromine-terminated alkyl substituents, N01 tended to from a two-dimensional conjugated network via synergistical weak intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions involving C–H⋯O, C–H⋯Br, and π–π interactions. Such self-assembly promoted hole transport, eliminated thermal phase transition, modulated surface properties, and induced perovskite growth. XPS also manifested that O atoms and bromo-hexyl groups in the molecules strongly interact with the Pb2+ ions, favoring defect passivation and interfacial charge transport. As a result, the inverted PVSC with N01 realized a high PCE of 21.85%.
One polycyclic-conjugated small molecule 2,5,9,12-tetra(tert-butyl)diacenaphtho[1,2-b:1′,2′-d]thiophene, named as PCA-1, was reported by Peng and coworkers.150 The peripheral tert-butyl groups prevented π–π stacking during the spin-coating process, resulting in uniform and amorphous films. Interestingly, further thermal annealing made the amorphous films highly crystalline with improved hole mobilities (8.3 × 10−2 ± 0.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). Although the value was lower than that of the reference molecule, PCA-1 demonstrated more smooth film morphology due to the interfacial bonds between the sulfur atoms and the perovskites. Using PCA-1 as the dopant-free HTM endowed n–i–p planar and mesoscopic devices with an efficiency of 15.59% and 18.17%, respectively. This indicated the importance of the balance between the mobility and film morphology for the overall photovoltaic performance. In this regard, Zhu's group and coworkers established a molecular locking strategy to balance the two properties by tuning the molecular conformation.51 On the basis of tetrathienylethene, semi-locked TTE-2 possessed a specific hybridization of the orthogonal and planar structure, enabling the formation of an amorphous film with a higher hole mobility than the unlocked counterpart (6.18 × 10−4vs. 8.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The best-performing cell with dopant-free TTE-2 showed a PCE of 20.04%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, a JSC of 23.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 77%. The efficiency was much superior over that of the unlocked device (13.68%) (Fig. 11g). More importantly, the unencapsulated device stored under ambient air with a humidity of 35% at 20–25 °C retained about 85% of its original PCE after 1000 hours.


4.2.3 HTMs with planar cores containing multiple heteroatoms. 
Heteroaromatic hydrocarbons containing diverse heteroatoms (O, N, S, Si) are promising backbones for organic semiconductors, where the properties can be controlled by modulating the conjugation of the heteroatom orbitals with aromatic π orbitals. A D–A–D HTM YN2 was designed by utilizing electron-deficient thienopyrazine (TP) as the core and electron-denoting TPA as the ending units, where intramolecular charge transfer was expected.151 Owing to the strong electron-withdrawing property of TP, YN2 possessed a deep HOMO energy level (−5.40 eV) and a high mobility (9.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Accordingly, this material in the mesoporous n–i–p device showed an efficiency of 19.27%, accompanied with an excellent long-term device stability (91.3% retention after 1000 h storage in an ambient environment).
Zhu's group introduced rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the quinoxaline core, obtaining two molecules with completely different molecular arrangement (TQ3 and TQ4).53 Single crystal analysis showed that coplanar π-extended quinoxaline-based molecule TQ4 formed tight π–π stacking with short plane-to-plane distance of 3.31 Å and enriched intermolecular interactions. The thin film of TQ4 thus delivered a hole mobility of 2.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was almost twice that of its analogue TQ3. Besides, XPS results revealed the strong interactions between the sulfur/nitrogen heteroatoms in the quinoxaline core and the perovskite. Upon systematical optimizations on the HTM layer, n–i–p PVSC employing TQ4 as the dopant-free HTM achieved a champion PCE of 21.03% (Fig. 11h). Meanwhile, the hydrophobicity of this molecule is beneficial for the perovskite durability against moisture, which contributed to the good long-term PCE retention (PCE loss <10% after 1000 h storage) (Fig. 11i).

Dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) is a strong electron-donating on which versatile chemical modifications are available. Conjugated ICTH1 and ICTH2 were attained by bridging DTP and dicyanovinylene with thiophene or thiazole, respectively.152 Such D–π–A structure imparted high intramolecular charge transfer nature to these molecules and eliminated the need of dopants. With a device configuration of FTO/meso-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag, ICTH1 and ICTH2 delivered an optimized PCE value of 17.91% and 18.75% in an active area of 2.04 and 2.18 cm2, respectively. Wu et al. adopted indeno[1,2-b]carbazole to replace the state-of-the-art TPA terminals, combining the characteristics of carbazole and fluorene.106 The resultant M129 exhibited high hole mobility, good film-forming ability, and a high Tg of 170 °C. For the PVSCs of ITO/SnO2/Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3/HTMs/Au, this molecule enabled a high efficiency of 20.35% and 17.50% with/without dopants, respectively. The M129-based device also demonstrated excellent stability, retaining 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h in 30% humidity. Our group established molecular engineering on the DTP core through π-conjugation extension and N-alkylation strategy, obtaining DTPC8-ThTPA and DTPC13-ThTPA.153 The flanking thiophene units between the DTP core and the TPA arms fine-tuned the hole mobility and energy levels for the HTMs while the N-alkyl chains on the DTP core can modulate the crystallinity and solubility of molecules. The increase in the number of end-capping units efficiently improved the thermal stability of the conjugated molecules.159 Due to the high electron densities of the DTP core and the thiophene-spacers, the DTP-based HTMs showed strong coordination effect with under-coordinated Pd2+ cations. This not only improved the hole collection at the interface of perovskite/HTM but also promoted the growth of high-quality perovskite films. Ultimately, a larger ionization potential (5.04 eV) was obtained for DTPC13-ThTPA films in comparison to DTPC8-ThTPA (4.94 eV), together with a higher hole mobility (2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 3.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The former molecule as the dopant-free HTMs in the planar regular devices afforded a champion efficiency of 20.38% at the reverse scan, with a VOC of 1.135 V, a JSC of 22.82 mA cm−2, and an FF of 78.7%. In contrast, the devices based on DTPC8-ThTPA delivered a relatively lower PCE of 18.37%. We further introduced 2-hexylthiophene to the N-atom to get DTP-C6Th, realizing an improved hole mobility of 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the enhanced intermolecular interactions.154 Due to strong interaction with the perovskite, the hole extracted at the DTP-C6Th/perovskite interfaces was much more efficient than that of spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 13a). Together with the mixed halogen ions and an ultrathin interfacial poly(methyl methacrylate) layer, a high PCE of 21.04% with a steady-state value of 20.36% was achieved, accompanied by good stability (Fig. 13b–d). Recently, a large conjugated electron-deficient 12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro[1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4,5]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole (BTP) was incorporated by Yin et al. as the skeleton to construct D–A type HTMs.114 With the large coplanar backbone, HTM exhibited reduced hole hopping distance and increased intermolecular interactions, thus enhancing the hole transport capability. By inserting a thiophene bridge to extended π-conjugation length as well as tuning the side chain length, the molecular stacking of Y-T was further optimized. Ultimately, Y-T delivered a champion PCE of 20.29% in MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 PVSCs with the help of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) passivation. Jang et al. synthesized novel HTM mDPA-DBT by fusing two strong electron donating moieties, 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DBTP) and TPA.155 The fused ring of DBTP enhances the backbone planarity and π–π intermolecular stacking, which enabled these HTMs to transport holes efficiently without dopants. By tuning the position of the alkoxy units on the arylamine wings, the energy levels of the DBTP-based HTMs were easily controllable. With a suitable HOMO energy level (−5.31 eV) and relatively high hole mobility (6.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), mDPA-DBTP delivered a high PCE of 18.09% with negligible hysteresis in planar PVSC. Sonar et al. reported the use of a quinacridone (QA) dye as the core for the development of new HTMs (ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA, and DPA-QA-DPA).156 Two electron-withdrawing ketonic groups in the conjugated backbone not only lead to a low-lying HOMO level of HTM but can also act as the Lewis bases to passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Ultimately, three novel quinacridone (QA)-derived HTMs with acenaphthylene (ACE), diphenylamine (DPA), and TPA as the end-capping donors were successfully synthesized. The substitution resulted in deeper HOMO levels and increased the hole mobility with an order of ACE > TPA > DPA; the dopant-free efficiencies of 18.2%, 16.6%, and 15.5%, respectively, were obtained accordingly.

Three D–A–D type HTMs (BTTI-C6, BTTI-C8, and BTTI-C12), based on electron-deficient 4H-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (BTTI), was designed and synthesized by Guo's group.157 With reduced length of the side-substituted alkyl chains on the N-atom, the hole mobility and film-forming capability of HTMs were simultaneously improved. Accordingly, normal planar devices based on BTTI-C6, BTTI-C8, and BTTI-C12 delivered a PCE of 19.69%, 18.89%, and 17.49%, respectively. In addition, the hydrophobic BTTI-C6 also significantly improved the long-term stability of the device (Fig. 13d). Impressively, BTTI-C12, also named as MPA-BTTI, demonstrated more powerful capability as the dopant-free HTMs in the inverted devices.55 Besides the well-aligned energy levels and appropriate hole mobility, the good thermal stability of MPA-BTTI was essential for device fabrication and shelf-life stability of PVSCs. MPA-BTTI-based PVSCs exhibited an outstanding PCE of 21.17% with a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 23.23 mA cm−2, and an FF of 81%, showing one of the highest efficiencies among the inverted devices using dopant-free small molecule HTMs (Fig. 13e). Meanwhile, MPA-BTTI-based PVSCs also showed good long-term stability, maintaining 94% of its initial PCE after 800 h thermal stress at 80 °C (Fig. 13f). They further reported the synthesis of a simple molecule MPA-BT-CA by incorporating a traditional anchoring group (2-cyanoacrylic acid) into the D–A backbone.158 The carboxyl group can cause the molecule adsorb onto the surface of the ITO electrode through chemical adsorption, thereby modifying the work function of ITO. This made the ITO electrode and the perovskite have better energy level matching, which was conducive for the effective extraction and transport of holes at the interfaces. The sulfur atom in benzothiadiazole and terminal carboxyl group could also coordinate with uncoordinated Pb2+ so as to passivate the interface defects. As a result, the MPA-BT-CA-based inverted PVSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 21.24% with good long-term stability (Fig. 13g and i). Encouragingly, using the nontoxic solvent ethanol to prepare MPA-BT-CA films for inverted PVSCs also delivered an efficiency of up to 20.52% with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 13h). This work showed the great potential of self-assembled HTMs based on the anchoring mechanism.

5. Conclusion and prospects
The past decade has witnessed a leap forward in the development of high-efficiency PVSCs, wherein the solid-state HTMs played a crucial role in extracting and transporting holes from the perovskites to the metal electrodes. However, the PCEs still lag behind the SQ limit and the long-term conservation of efficiency needs to be further improved. However, compared to the cases employing dopant-free polymers and certified record values (Fig. 14a), substantial efforts should be made for developing small organic semiconductors. To get rid of the dependence on dopants, the conjugated units with good planarity are often selected as the core. This can enhance the intermolecular interaction, thereby increasing the intrinsic hole mobility. Furthermore, the defects in the perovskite films not only cause serious non-radiative recombination but are also detrimental to the device stability. Inspired by defect engineering, the introduction of the heteroatom-containing functional groups into the molecules has become an important method to develop dopant-free but efficient HTMs. When applied to devices, the balance between film formation and charge transport of the HTM layers is very important. By tuning the molecular spatial structure, introducing branched-chain substituents or cross-linkable groups, a uniform organic film with good hole extraction and transport ability can be obtained. In inverted devices, HTMs with anchoring groups (phosphate groups, carboxylic acid groups, alkoxy groups, and hydroxyl groups) have shown great potential in stabilizing the interfaces. In the past five years, various dopant-free small organic HTMs have been developed to avoid the negative influences of ionic dopants and additives.

The mismatched energy level alignment can result in the interfacial non-radiative recombination losses, causing high VOC loss and decreased FF. A reliable hole-extraction layer must be able to maintain a difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of HTM and the perovskites while ensuring sufficient majority hole extraction. Beside the rational molecular design, brilliant methods of processing the HTMs is also able to tune the energy level alignment and to further promote interfacial carrier extraction. Tu et al. performed the gradient engineering of HTMs for developing monolithic series-type large-area PVSCs.160 In their method, spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved into the anti-solvent, resulting in the formation of a gradient region between the perovskite and the same HTM layer. PL and TRPL confirmed the more efficient hole transport owing to the tailored energy levels. For organic semiconductors, the fine-tuning of the electronic bands can be realized by alloying structurally similar analogs.161 Our group synthesized two carbazole-cored HTMs CZ-TA and CZ-STA (Fig. 14d) with different terminal heteroatoms at the TPA units.162 By changing the contents of CZ-STA, the HOMO levels of the organic films can be linearly tuned in a wide range, allowing optimized interfacial energy level alignments (Fig. 14d). This strategy extended the feasibility of the obtained organic HTMs toward different light absorbers. Alternatively, the use of binary HTMs is capable of forming gradient energy-level alignment at the interface, facilitating hole extraction, and decreasing the VOC loss of the PSC devices.163,164 For example, Hemasiri et al. placed 2D a dichalcogenide material (MoS2) at the perovskite/HTM interface in a dopant-free PVSC device, forming a gradient energy-level alignment (Fig. 14b and c). Together with the reduced trap density, the interfacial losses were significantly mitigated and higher VOC was obtained. The integration of the interfacial layers can also improve the device stability by taking advantage of the unique properties of inorganic species.
The most reported high-efficiency PVSCs adopt organic–inorganic perovskites as the light-absorbing materials. By replacing the organic cations of Cs+, the resultant all-inorganic compounds showed superior thermal and light stability.166 At present, all-inorganic PVSCs still use traditional HTMs (i.e., spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, or PEDOT:PSS).167–169 Only several cases have been reported employing dopant-free polymers.122,170–172 The PCEs of this type of PVSCs are much lower than that of hybrid perovskite-based devices. One critical reason is the presence of a large number of defects, resulting in significant energy loss. Therefore, the HTMs with passivation effects are also recommended for all-inorganic PVSCs. Except for the interactions with the Pd-related sites, the interactions with the Cs+ ions need to be purposely designed, which can be learned from the organic doping-tailored growth of the all-inorganic perovskite films.173,174 On the other hand, the use of Sn2+-based perovskites is another tendency to avoid toxic Pd2+.175 In this respect, how to reduce Sn4+ concentration is important for achieving high efficiency and stability. This demands us to construct interactions with the Sn2+ ions (Fig. 14e), which is associated with special functional groups. However, dopant-free organic HTMs for all-inorganic and lead-free PVSCs are rarely reported. The design and synthesis of such HTMs are challenging but meaningful.
