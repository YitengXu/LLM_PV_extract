    , Accepted 2nd June 2023First published on 6th June 2023AbstractIn past decades, antifogging surfaces have drawn more and more attention owing to their promising and wide applications such as in aerospace, traffic transportation, optical devices, the food industry, and medical and other fields. Therefore, the potential hazards caused by fogging need to be solved urgently. At present, the up-and-coming antifogging surfaces have been developing swiftly, and can effectively achieve antifogging effects primarily by preventing fog formation and rapid defogging. This review analyzes and summarizes current progress in antifogging surfaces. Firstly, some bionic and typical antifogging structures are described in detail. Then, the antifogging materials explored thus far, mainly focusing on substrates and coatings, are extensively introduced. After that, the solutions for improving the durability of antifogging surfaces are explicitly classified in four aspects.

1 Introduction
Fogging is a common phenomenon in nature. In terms of form, surface fogging is a sort of phase transition. When encountering a low-temperature interface (the temperature is lower than or equal to the dew point of the water vapor under the corresponding pressure), the water vapor cools to saturation and condenses on the solid surface, forming discrete droplets or eventually irregular water layers.1 Dew point refers to the temperature at which the water vapor in the air reaches the saturation state (relative humidity of 100%).2 Surface fogging has been proved to not only adversely affect people's productivity and life, but also causes safety problems. In the fields of automobile and aviation (trains, vehicles, aircraft, etc.), fog droplets on windshields and rearview mirrors cause refraction and diffuse reflection of light, resulting in a substantial decline in light transmittance, which is also the leading cause of traffic crashes; in the medical domain, the surfaces of some optical devices and protective appliances are prone to fogging in a low-temperature environment. During an epidemic, wearing goggles is an indispensable part of the daily work of medical staff.3,4 However, the visual impairment caused by obvious fogging during the wearing of goggles will seriously affect the work efficiency and safety of medical staff, and pose an unnecessary threat to the safety of patients.5,6 In the photovoltaic field, tiny droplets on the surface will obviously decrease the energy transformation efficiency of photovoltaic cells;7 similarly, in agriculture, dew on the surface of greenhouse covers will affect the light utilization rate and plant metabolism, thus damaging the quality and yield of crops to a certain extent.8 In addition, surface fogging is deleterious not only to the optical properties of transparent materials, but also their aesthetic and sanitary aspects. In the food industry, the fogging of food packaging surfaces will not only affect the visual appearance of the food but also lead to deterioration and decay of the food.9 Similarly, water mist formed on a metal surface will accelerate the corrosion of materials and cause energy loss, which is relevant for construction engineering, machinery manufacturing and other fields.10–12 It is apparent that the problems and disadvantages caused by fog exist in various aspects of production and life. Therefore, people have an imperative demand for antifogging surface technology.
In recent years, the development of antifogging surface technology has received close attention in scientific and industrial circles. Hitherto, the effectiveness of two antifogging strategies has been fully confirmed. One is to regulate external environmental factors, including ambient relative humidity, material surface temperature, and airflow. For example, when applying an external voltage to control the surface temperature to avoid fogging, such methods rely primarily on a conductive coating to achieve the antifogging function.13,14 Increasing the airflow rate is another approach for preventing fogging. Airflow is used to promote water vaporization and reduce the number of latent condensation points.15,16 However, such strategies have evident drawbacks, such as the complexity and cost increase due to the introduction of external equipment, maintenance difficulties, etc. Therefore, its application has significant limitations. The second is to regulate the avidity between the solid interface and water droplets by indirectly introducing a coating or directly modifying the microstructure and chemical properties of the substrate surface to realize the antifogging function. There are two ways to achieve this antifogging strategy: the first is to alter the surface chemical properties by introducing functional groups—for example, using polymers with polar groups (such as hydroxyl (OH), amino (NH2), carboxyl (COOH), ester (COOR), etc.) and inorganic materials (such as ZnO, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, etc.). The second is to change the surface roughness of the substrate, or “carve” the micro and nanostructures with specific geometric morphology on the surface. For example, the hierarchical condensation of a micro-hill system can promote the shedding of the condensed droplets from the surface.  For the design of antifogging surfaces, the second strategy has the advantages of simple preparation processes and higher cost-effectiveness. Based on such antifogging strategies, many techniques for preparing antifogging surfaces have already been reported, such as laser processing, chemical etching, sol–gel, chemical vapor deposition, etc. Or they can be divided into the top-down method and the bottom-up method. Although functional surfaces with excellent antifogging performance have been progressively developed, these surfaces still have severe defects in practical applications, such as poor resistance to mechanical and chemical damage. At present, the commonly used mechanical damage test methods include the sandpaper wear test, tape-peeling test, pencil hardness test, drop impinging test, twisting test, etc. Common chemical damage test methods include ultraviolet radiation, acid/alkali/salt corrosion, high temperature, etc. In addition, it is crucial to control the surface roughness of transparent materials. It is reported that roughness greater than 100 nm will lead to transparency loss due to light scattering and inferior mechanical properties.17 Given the above considerations, it is crucial to achieve a balance between surface wettability, optical properties, mechanical stability, and durability when designing antifogging surfaces.
In this review, we have mainly analyzed and summarized the latest developments in antifogging surfaces in recent years from the two aspects of structure and materials. Section 2 is divided into the bionic structure and other typical structures from the perspective of structures. After millions of years of biological evolution, nature has created and singled out many almost indefectible structures to achieve numerous exceptional performances. Inspired by natural organisms, many researchers acquire antifogging functional surfaces by imitating biological structures. Moreover, some characteristic structures have also been designed for fog prevention, such as the mesh porous structure, hierarchical structure, fold structure, and others (Table 1). These structures not only change the surface roughness, but also play a critical role in changing the formation process of droplets and their behavior on the surface. Section 3, from the perspective of materials, is divided into substrate materials and coating materials. In published articles, much information has been reported about the application of antifogging structures and coatings to various substrate materials. In various antifogging coating material systems, according to the chemical properties of materials, they can be mainly divided into the organic coating, inorganic coating, and organic–inorganic composite coating. Section 4 primarily analyzes the chief measures to improve the durability of antifogging surfaces and boost their practical application in life. The last section briefly analyzes the challenges and research directions in antifogging.

2 Structures for antifogging
2.1 Bionic structures
After billions of years of natural selection and continuous biological evolution, multitudinous organisms have created abundant complex structures with special functions, inspiring for the exploration and design of biologically inspired, bionic, and biologically copied antifogging systems.18 Many articles have been published on how to obtain excellent surface wettability and properties by mimicking biological structures, and these have been applied to various fields—for example, the superhydrophobic surface with high adhesion mimicking the rose petal hierarchical micro–nano structure,19 the antifogging surface mimicking the mosquito compound eye hexagonal protuberances array structure,20,21 the shark skin striated microgroove structure for drag reduction and self-cleaning,22 and the pine needle-like multistage asymmetric structure for liquid titration and transportation.23 Here, several typical biological structures applied in the antifogging field are introduced and analyzed, and the effects of different biomimetic structures on droplet behavior and fog control performance are highlighted.
A single mosquito compound eye consists of hexagonally close-packed (hcp) ommatidia (with a diameter of ≈26 μm). The surface of each ommatidium is covered with non-close-packed (ncp) protuberances with an average diameter of 101.1 ± 7.6 nm and a distribution interval of 47.6 ± 8.5 nm (Fig. 1A(i)). Similar to mosquito compound eyes, fly compound eyes are composed of thousands of hcp ommatidium with a diameter of ≈20 μm. The surface of each ommatidium is covered with near hcp bubble-like protuberances (with diameters of ≈100 nm) (Fig. 1A(ii)).24 This unique micro-/nanostructure effectively prevents condensate droplets from dipping in the interstice between the ommatidia.

(E) Mechanism analysis of coalescence-induced droplet jumping. Reproduced from ref. 26 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2021. 
Inspired by mosquito compound eyes, He et al.26 successfully obtained superhydrophobic and ultra-low adhesion transparent glasses with a hexagonal micro-pits array by laser direct writing (LDW) micromachining and facile fluorination modification (Fig. 1B). Here, a femtosecond laser system was used to scan the sample surface in parallel to etch the designed pattern. By adjusting the laser scanning speed, scanning spacing and laser energy, the micro-pit structures with different spacing and diameter were realized. The results showed that the sample had the best water-repellency (contact angle ∼165°, sliding angle ∼1.7°) and transparency (<2% loss of RT to the pristine glass (PG)) when the pit diameter was 12 μm and the dot pitch was 24 μm. As shown in Fig. 1D, the biomimetic microstructure can efficaciously induce condensate droplets to in situ coalesce (more than two and up to 8-plus) to release surface energy and jump off the surface, thus obtaining many drying regions. The spontaneous coalescence and bouncing motion of surface droplets is the key to getting outstanding antifogging performance. The concrete transversion of droplet coalescence can be subdivided into three stages (Fig. 1E): stage I is from the formation of the capillary bridge (CB) to the dilation of the CB until it impacts on the surface. At this gradation, due to the symmetrical deformation of the droplet relative to the x-axis of coalescence, the net upward velocity (Vup) and the upward kinetic energy (Ekin,up) of the droplet are both zero. Stage II is from the CB impacting on the surface until becoming a maximum solid–liquid contact region. During this period, the Esurf,ex is partially converted to Ekin,up because the symmetry breaking of the CB impacts on the hydrophobic surface, which prompts the upward movement of the droplet, leading to a net upward velocity Vup,t. As the liquid in the high-pressure regions on both sides flows to the middle area, the droplets reach the maximum contraction condition and maximal solid–liquid contact area simultaneously, which leads to the maximal upward reaction force Fup,max. Stage III is from the maximum solid–liquid contact area until the droplet leaves the surface. At this phase, under the effect of Fup ultimately, an upward acceleration will be formed to impel the liquid droplets to accomplish the self-propelling behavior. In addition, droplets can form an air cushion layer on the microstructure surface, preventing water droplets from pinning and preventing droplets releasing phase transformation energy to the base material, thereby giving the glass self-cleaning and delayed icing capability (Fig. 1C). The micro-pit array structure not only improves the roughness of the modified glass surface and enhances the wettability of the surface, but also establishes a stable air cushion between the droplet and the substrate, which greatly reduces the contact area and adhesion strength of the droplet. It is the key to the droplet jump and to prolonging the icing time.
Analogously, the leaf surface of Euphorbia myrsinites has non-close-packed microsized papillae, with a height of about 10 μm and a spacing of around 40 μm, and the whole surface is overspread with schistose wax with a width of about 40 nm (Fig. 2A). Inspired by E. myrsinites, Baba et al.27 fabricated biomimetic microcolumn arrays with superhydrophobicity and low adhesion on silicon wafers. Optical observation by microscope revealed that when the height of the microcolumn reached 6.5 μm, the mass transfer coefficient increased rapidly with the steam diffusion rate, and the greater disturbance of the local mass transfer boundary layer provided the corresponding abundant steam for the formation and growth of the bottom droplets; thus tiny droplets are formed at the bottom of the coalesced droplets, which grow and merge with the secondary droplets to motivate the continuous jump of surface droplets (Fig. 2B and C(i)). In particular, when the diameter of the micropillar was 5.6 μm and the height was 19.5 μm, the surface droplets condensed and ejected from the surface, which effectively prevented the reattachment of the agglomerated droplets, and no droplets of 35 μm or more could exist on the surface (Fig. 2C(ii)). On the one hand, the microcolumn array structure provides sufficient conditions for droplet nucleation, which leads to droplet growth, polymerization, and transition to the top of the structure. On the other hand, the structure provides support for large droplets on the surface, preventing the droplets from wetting the inside of the structure. At the same time, the smaller contact area and stronger water resistance make the droplets have more energy to jump off the surface. Through the research on the behavior of condensate droplets on the surface of the bionic structure, the condensation mechanism on the plant surface was revealed, and the heat transfer of condensate droplets was markedly promoted by optimizing the microstructure to improve the heat exchange process.

Furthermore, researchers have found similar tapered nanostructures on the surface of moth eyes, glasswing butterfly wings and cicada wings (Fig. 3A(i–iii)).28–30 This combination of small feature sizes and optimal shapes provides excellent surface properties. Inspired by this, Mouterde et al.31 studied the influence of the texture's feature size and feature shape on the antifogging performance of solid surfaces by analyzing both condensation-induced adhesion and feature shape effect. The following conclusions were drawn (Fig. 3B(i–v)): (i) the minimum texture size (height h = 88 nm, radius a = 15 nm, spacing p = 52 nm) kept the surface droplets in the Cassie state over a wider range of temperatures. The condensed water in the gap of the texture is avoided to establish a firm bridge between the droplet and the substrate, so that the droplet can transition from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state. (ii) Under the same structure size and spacing (h = 115 nm, p = 52 nm), the nanocone structure further enhances the water repellency (θa = 170 ± 2°, θr = 163 ± 2°—the advancing angle increases by 10° and the hysteresis decreases by 10°) and antifogging ability of the hydrophobic surface. The conical geometry hinders the condensation of droplets at the bottom of the structures, and the special geometry uses the Laplacian pressure difference to expel droplets from the structural gaps. The research confirmed that the conical surface nanostructures have excellent antifog capabilities from two aspects of size and shape (antifogging efficiency close to unity and water departure of droplets smaller than 2 μm) (Fig. 3C(i–iii)). This special tapered microstructure is not only of great significance for improving the surface wettability, but also has significant advantages in anti-fog structures by virtue of its geometric shape.

It is striking to observe the multiscale hierarchical morphologies of the original wing scales of the male Morpho menelaus terrestris butterfly, and it is found that the wing scales can be divided into two types: transparent cover scales (CSs) and blue ground scales (GSs). CSs and GSs overlap each other, and possess ridge–trench complex arrays with different periodic spacing. Each ridge is composed of several layers of parallel portions. There are numerous evenly distributed micro ribs between two adjacent slices, forming rows of window-like pits. The cross-section of a single ridge presents a typical “pagoda” shape (Fig. 4A(i–iii)). Han et al.32 prepared SiO2 biomimetic monolayer film (BMF) by an optimized bio-template-assisted wet chemical method: using original wings as bio-template, solid biomimetic multiscale hierarchical pagoda structures (MHPSs) were fabricated using the sol–gel method. The active antifogging mechanism of the bionic structure surface can be divided into two steps: “fogdrop capture” and “anisotropic spread” (Fig. 4B). The hydrone monolayer formed by the spontaneously adhered tiny drops attracts adjacent water clusters, and the droplets gradually grow up; due to the unbalanced force, the grown fogdrop diffuses fastest along the narrow layered passageways and slowest along the vertical direction due to the physical obstruction of the MHPSs. The process forms an active antifogging cycle of “fogdrop capture – anisotropic spread – rapid evaporation”. The special micro-geometric structure provides inspiration for the design of superhydrophilic antifogging surfaces, and the anisotropy of the structure provides strong support for the rapid diffusion of droplets.

In summary, bionic antifogging structures can withstand the test of the actual harsh environment due to their natural selection, which is the primary reference for designing artificial antifogging structures. There are many seductive secrets in nature that are unknown. It is necessary to reveal the mystery of this huge treasure house through long-term scientific exploration, so as to provide more valuable references for the solution of humans’ anti-fog problem.
2.2 Typical structures
Many organisms in nature furnish near-perfect unique structures that can be directly applied in the field of antifogging. The antifogging properties of these structures have been constantly confirmed. For the continuous improvement of the application of bionic structures, researchers have been paying attention to a whole string of similar structures derived from biological prototypes. Furthermore, to obtain exceptional antifogging performance, the design and research of some unique structures are emerging in an endless stream. The research on typical structures has continuously deepened the significance of microstructure for surface droplet behavior and antifogging performance.

2.2.1 Micro-feature array structures. 
Very recently, Yoon and colleagues33 prepared a polymer–silica nanocomposite hydrophilic reservoir using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly on a transparent glass surface. They then transferred the low-surface-energy micropillar array structure to the heterostructured nanofilm by two-step lithography technology (Fig. 5A(i)). Due to the nanoporous structure and the hydrophilic characteristics of the materials, the condensed water is preferentially immersed in the bottom layer and rapidly diffuses, which effectively inhibits surface fogging and light reflection (refractive index: 1.49, the average transmittance value in the visible region: 94.8%). At the same time, the low-surface-energy micropillar array structure composed of perfluoropolyether (PFPE) can form an air–solid compound interface on the substrate surface, bringing about a superhydrophobic character to the water droplets (the advancing contact angle of 162°, and the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of 3°) (Fig. 5A(ii and iii)).

(iii) Time-dependant change of contact angle on the films. Reproduced from ref. 34 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2018. 
In addition, the micropillar array structure is also used for superhydrophilic surfaces. Duan et al.34 prepared Fe3+-doped TiO2 films with anatase crystallites and a micro/nanometer-scale hill–valley hierarchical arrays structure using the surface photosensitive sol–gel method (Fig. 5B(i and ii)). The patterned TiO2 thin film with the shortest period of 2 μm showed the lowest contact angle of 2° (Fig. 5B(iii)). Repeated water wetting–drying treatment experiments were carried out without any UV activation. The results showed that the film had stable super-hydrophilicity. The droplet spreading speed and contact angle remained unchanged. A large number of studies have shown that TiO2 has photocatalytic activity and strong oxidation ability, which is regarded as a promising photocatalyst and has been applied in the field of antifogging.
Similarly, Han et al.35 fabricated a nanopillar arrays structure on quartz substrates by nanosphere lithography and controlled the tip size of nanopillars with a hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. By controlling the HF treatment time, the spacing between the prepared nanopillars was about 360 nm, the tip diameter decreased from 210 nm to 10 nm, and the height was reduced from 620 nm to 300 nm (Fig. 6A(i)). In the sterilization, antifogging and antireflection experiments, the needle-shaped nanostructure surface (treated with HF solution for 150 s) presented the highest bactericidal activity. Concurrently, the contact angle of the surface reached 0°, showing super-hydrophilicity. It will not fog, and maintains high transparency in a water vapor environment (Fig. 6A(ii)). The versatility of the surface of nanopillar array structure, including superhydrophilic, antifogging, antireflection, and sterilization properties, can provide definite advantages for application in optical equipment.

As well as the pillar-array structure, the surface composed of nanocones exhibits a more powerful antifogging performance. To explore the origin of the difference, Lecointre et al.36 systematically studied the influence of the nanotexture family transiting from pillars to sharp cones on the behavior of droplets. Three kinds of nanocone families were specifically considered: homogeneous (differing in the spacing and height but with constant apex angle), extruded (differing in the height and apex angle but with constant spacing), and truncated (with given design and different truncation degrees) (Fig. 6B(i)). The combinations of texture scale (sub-micrometer), shape (circular conical), and density (dense array) were studied. By comparing the contact angle, breath figures, and droplet jumping rate of different surface droplets (Fig. 6B(ii)), the antifogging efficiency of sharp nanocones was found to be generally applicable to various texture sizes (50–420 nm), apex angles (15–38°), and cone shapes (straight/convex, with sharp/round tips). However, the influence of the physical and chemical properties of the nanocone surface on the droplet jumping mechanism remains to be studied.
In summary, such array structures form a sufficiently small texture size on the surface of the substrate, which can effectively prevent tiny fog drips from being caught in the gap. They develop a high-energy ice crystal nucleation barrier owing to the relatively low adhesion and the minimum solid–liquid contact area at the tip of the structures. What is more, the special nanoarray structure makes the refractive index of the material surface gradually decrease along the normal direction of the substrate towards the air, suppressing the light reflection to a considerable extent.


2.2.2 Porous structures. 
The porous structure improves the surface wettability mainly by changing the porosity and roughness of the material surface to get a superb antifogging function. Appropriate porosity can not only effectively improve the surface roughness, but also the tiny micropores use capillary action to make the water droplets captured on the surface quickly diffuse into a thin water film, which weakens the reflectivity of the surface to light and accelerates the evaporation of surface water. These structures are deposited mainly by nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes on different substrate surfaces (including glass, quartz, silicon, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)): specific assembly units of solid nanoparticles or “building blocks” with double size roughness are used to construct porous structures. These nanoparticles chiefly involve inherent hydrophilic materials (such as graphene oxide and SiO2) and photocatalytically active materials (such as TiO2 and ZnO). Among them, because SiO2 nanoparticles (including silica nanosheets, silica nanorods, solid silica nanoparticles (SSNPs), hollow silica nanospheres (HSNs), hollow and solid raspberry-like/mulberry-like silica nanospheres, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MPSNPs), among others) have the advantages of refractive index and inherent hydrophilicity, they are more widely used in the construction of antifogging and antireflection porous structures than other materials.
For example, Li et al.37 reported that a highly porous superhydrophilic antifogging coating was deposited on a glass substrate using a coating solution prepared using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and colloidal silica.38 A superhydrophilic porous structure was obtained by adjusting surface roughness and porosity via changing the branch length of dendritic SiO2 nanoparticles and drying temperature (Fig. 7A(i)). The results show that when the branch length of dendritic SiO2 nanoparticles is around 60 nm, the coating exhibits superhydrophilicity (contact angle ∼1.7°) and high transmittance (the maximal transmittance of the coating is increased by 2.2%) (Fig. 7A(ii and iii)). Eshaghi et al.39 used poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) solution and Polycation poly(diallyl dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-silicate complexes to circularly deposit (PAA/PDDA-silicate)n multilayer films on glass substrates. Nanopores with sizes between 30 nm and 80 nm were distinctly perceived in the film ((PAA/PDDA-silicate)12) calcined at 300 °C (Fig. 7B(i)). The transmittance spectra showed that the transparency of SiO2 nanoporous film increased from 91.8% to 97% at 550 nm. In addition, the WCA of the glass surface was reduced from 67° to 3° by SiO2 nanoporous films (Fig. 7B(ii and iii)). The porous structure promotes the quick diffusion of water by wicking effect and capillary attraction.

Moreover, due to the combined action of increased surface roughness and high content of hydroxyl groups on the surface, the coated glass presents durable super-hydrophilicity, antifogging and antireflection properties. Yao et al.40 used silica to optimize the hydrophilicity of titanium dioxide under natural light and obtained nanoporous thin films by dipping the prepared SiO2&TiO2 double-shell hollow nanospheres (DSHNs) sol onto the glass substrate and calcining at 550 °C (Fig. 7C(i)). Due to the unique double-shell structure and strong photocatalytic ability, the nanocomposite SiO2–TiO2 film showed high light transmittance and super-hydrophilic antifogging properties (Fig. 7C(ii and iii)). Using the potassium hydroxide (KOH) hot alkali solution etching process directly, dense nano-sized pores were formed on the surface of glasses with different compositions.41 Porous structure and etching thickness were controlled by glass composition and etching time. The etching thickness of soda lime glass with 27.42% Na content (glass A) reached 480 nm after etching for 4 hours (Fig. 7D(i)). Besides, the wettability of aluminosilicate glass (etched for 24 h) can be converted from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic (contact angle >150°) by a suitable octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) (Fig. 7D(ii)). Due to the porous structure and abundant hydrophilic Si–OH bonds produced in the etching process, the glass surface is superhydrophilic (contact angle <5°) and has fantastic antifogging properties (Fig. 7D(iii)).
Similarly, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were oxidized by (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and acted as an anionic nano-component TOCN with carboxyl groups on the surface. Chitosan was used as a cationic polymer adhesive interacting with TOCN. Moon et al.42 repeatedly and alternately deposited double-layer composite thin films on the surface of glass substrates via LBL assembly techniques. Three complex properties can be precisely tuned by controlling the number of bilayers: antireflection, structural coloration, and antifogging. With the increase of bilayer number (1–20 layers), a large number of nanofibers cross to form a uniform gradient 3D-nanoporous reticular structure (Fig. 8A(i)). Using this principle, the visible light transmittance of glass at 400–800 nm can be increased from ∼91% to ∼98.2%, and the most effective antireflection occurs between 15 and 20 bilayers. Concomitantly, it is worth mentioning that the transmittance and structural color of the CNFs capped by polydopamine (PDA/TOCN) films change periodically in the range of 1–100 layers: taking 1 to 33 bilayers as a cycle, the structural color appears in yellow, purple and blue order (Fig. 8A(ii)). Superhydrophilic and antifogging properties of LBL films can be induced by special progressive nanoporous structure and capillary effect (Fig. 8A(iii)). Furthermore, like fingerprints, the randomly deposited CNF has physical uncloned nanostructures, showing a new dimension for stealth security applications. Manabe et al.43 extracted chitin nanofibers (CHINFs) from crab shells and then controlled the porosity of a porous-mesh structure by adjusting the LBL assembly number and pH value of the solution. Finally, antireflection and hydrophilic antifogging coatings were successfully prepared on the glass surface. Among them, the refractive index of (CHINFs 5.0/PAA 5.0)10 film demonstrated the lowest value (1.30), and the transmittance of the coating at 550 nm wavelength was 96.4% (4.8% higher than that of the glass substrate) (Fig. 8B).

2.2.3 Hierarchical structures. 
Micro-/nanoscale interfacial structures are ordinarily responsible for irregular interactions between liquid and solid surfaces.44–48 At the micro/nanoscale, the interface structure can exhibit properties that cannot be observed at the macroscale.49–51 In general, the existence of nanostructures helps to reduce the energy barrier of heterogeneous nucleation, and the higher specific surface area effectively improves the nucleation efficiency of droplets.52 High-density condensation nucleation and the small-scale droplet self-separation effect can significantly improve condensation heat transfer performance on hydrophobic micro–nanostructure surfaces, while ultrahigh condensation heat transfer has the potential to enhance the efficiency of thermoelectric power generation, high heat flux thermal management and water distillation.
In addition to the steam side and hydrodynamic constraints, surface durability and nucleation-mediated overflow impose additional restrictions on the condensation of jumping droplets. To uncover the effect of droplet condensation on the overall heat transfer performance and achieving ultra-efficient droplet shedding, Yan et al.53 processed hill-like microstructures on mirror-finished Cu plates by laser ablation and then etched CuO nano blades on the whole surface by hot alkali solution to obtain micro/nanostructures (Fig. 9A(i)). The test results indicate that the hierarchical structure can assist the droplets’ self-transmission to the large suspension Cassie–Baxter (CB) state via both coalescence and divergence trajectories, allowing the condensation droplets to coexist with the smaller droplets (<1 μm) below. The presence of large CB state droplets accelerates the growth of a single potential droplet by ∼21% (Fig. 9A(ii and iii)). The hierarchical structure has the latent possibility to break the minimum droplet departure size limit determined by the finite surface adhesion and viscosity effect via inducing droplet coalescence, self-transport, and restructuring the length scale of the structure. Reasonable design of a hierarchical micro hills structure can induce continuous circulation of stratified condensation process, which can effectively remove the sub-10 μm condensed droplets on the surface (Fig. 9A(v)). The stable droplet shedding makes the droplet size distribution shift to the smaller size, which opens up a new direction for the design of micro/nanostructures on antifogging surfaces.

It is fascinating to reveal the behavior of nano-droplets on sophisticated surfaces. Peng et al.54 obtained hierarchical microgroove structures (with a depth of 260 μm, a width of 400 μm and an interval of 380 μm) by mechanical milling on mirror-finished Cu plates and then synthesized a sharp blade-like CuO nanostructure by self-limiting chemical oxidation reaction (Fig. 9B(i)). The microgroove structures play an important role in regulating the hydrodynamics of droplet coalescence, thereby affecting the droplet jumping speed and energy conversion efficiency. Various coalescence-induced jumping patterns on superhydrophobic surfaces of layered microgrooves have been observed from the two dimensions of droplet radius and position, including self-jumping of deformed droplets inside microgrooves, coalescence-induced jumping between deformed and undeformed droplets, coalescence-induced jumping of suspended droplets on contiguous microgrooves, and jumping of droplets coalescing on adjacent plateaus (Fig. 9B(ii)). Compared with the traditional coalescence-induced droplet jumping on the smooth superhydrophobic surface, the droplet jumping speed and energy conversion efficiency of the hierarchical microgroove structure surface increased by 1.93 and 6.67 times, respectively. The hierarchical structure breaks the limit of droplet jump energy conversion and improves the efficiency of droplet shedding on the surface to a certain extent. To improve the condensation heat transfer and increase the surface water removal rate, coalescence-induced droplet jumping is not only of wide interest in the field of antifogging but also has great potential in many fields such as self-cleaning, anti-icing, anti-frost, water collection, and so forth.
Furthermore, Li et al.55 fabricated hierarchical micro/nano-imaging systems by compounding photolithography, inkjet printing, and chemical growth. Specifically, this hierarchical structure is similar to the natural compound eye and lotus leaf coupling. The introduction of nano hairs into the side wall of the microcone arrays signally ameliorates the non-wetting effect of the surface (contact angle >160°, sliding angle ∼5.5°, and CAH ∼ 3.8°) and does not affect the transparency of the substrate (light transmittance ∼95%) (Fig. 9C). Chu et al.56 fabricated highly uniform 2D periodic hemispherical arrays on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) via femtosecond laser Bessel beam. The surface is covered with extensive porous network nanostructures. The micro/nanostructure results in a contact angle of 160° for water and 166° for oil on the surface and a sliding angle of 7° and 0.5°, respectively. More importantly, by tailoring the cycle of 2D-pattern structures, the adhesion of the surface can be controlled from ultra-low to ultra-high. The surface with ultra-low adhesion has good antifog and anti-icing performance, while the ultra-high adhesion surface can be applied for oil and water collection (Fig. 9D).
In summary, compared with the single micron structure, the introduction of nanostructures can significantly enhance the stability of the microstructure gap air layer. At the same time, the nanoscale structure is conducive to the nucleation of droplets, and the droplets on the surface of the hierarchical micro/nanostructure can maintain a stable Cassie state without being easily pinned to the structural surface. In addition, smaller contact area and stronger hydrophobicity give droplets higher energy conversion efficiency and surface droplet renewal rate. Compared with single nanostructures, micro/nanostructures can better protect nanostructures from being broken in the presence of microstructures, thereby prolonging the service life of antifogging surfaces. Therefore, hierarchical micro/nanostructures have gradually become a research hotspot in the field of antifogging structures.
In addition to the above regular structures designed and applied by researchers for fog prevention, some irregular structures have appeared in the preparation process, such as lattice fringe structure,57 flower-like structure,58,59 closed-pore structure,60,61 and wrinkled structure.62 These structures may not be pre-designed, but they exhibit excellent wettability and fog resistance.
For example, Yuan et al.4 prepared hydrophilic coatings by dipping core–shell polyacrylate/polypropylsilsesquioxane nanocomposite particles’ sols on the glass surface and then calcining it at 500 °C for 4 h under an air atmosphere. The surface roughness and microstructure of coatings can be controlled by altering the content of propyltrimethoxysilane. The results demonstrated that the maximal transmittance of the coating containing 8.0 g of propyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS-8) was 99.1%, and the average transmittance achieved 98.0% in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm (9.3% higher than that of the bare glass substrate). The coating containing 10.0 g of propyltrimethoxysilane (PTMS-10) showed worm-like nanostructures on the surface after calcination. The minimum contact angle was close to 0° within 0.5 s and remained transparent in a hot steam environment. The co-action of surface roughness and special worm-like nanostructures gives the coating special wettability, antifog, and antireflection capabilities (Fig. 10A). Similarly, Xiang and Liu63 dispersed triethanolamine-modified Ecokimera (ECO) nanoparticles in the binder formed by the combination of Konjac Glucomannan (KGM) and water-soluble silicone fluid, and prepared a dried rice field and pear-like double-layer coupling rough structure on the glass surface by spin-coating technology. The WCA of the coating surface reaches 2.51 ± 1°, so it has excellent antifog performance (Fig. 10B).

With the deepening of research on the microstructure of the antifogging surface, it is recognized that the reasonable design of the texture structure can effectively improve the surface roughness and improve the wetting effect. For the hydrophilic surface, the favorable structure mainly promotes the spread and evaporation of droplets on the surface, so as to realize the fog-free state. On the other hand, the introduction of microstructures can accelerate the whole process of nucleation, growth and merging of droplets on the hydrophobic surface, reduce the energy loss of droplets on the solid surface, and further promote the removal of surface droplets to achieve a fog-free state. For the design of the structure, people mainly focus on obtaining more reasonable geometric shapes and more subtle microstructures, so as to improve the behavior of droplets on the antifogging surface.

3 Materials for antifogging
3.1 Substrate materials
As mentioned in the introduction, fogging easily occurs on various supercooled surfaces, involving aviation, medical, photovoltaic, agriculture, food, and other fields. Therefore, the research process in antifog technology also involves a wide variety of substrate materials, including transparent materials such as glass, lenses, and polymer films, and opaque materials such as metals, fabrics, and cement.64,65
Different substrate materials have slightly different performance requirements for antifogging surfaces. For transparent substrates, it is not only necessary to obtain characteristic wettability to achieve the good antifog effect but also to ensure that the substrate material has high transparency and reduce light reflection—for example, solar cells, glasses, and optical lenses. Due to the inseparable relationship between antifog performance and antireflection, the influence of fog droplets on light is briefly introduced here. When water vapor condenses on the solid surface in a drop mode, each droplet appears as a light-scattering point. Previous studies66,67 have indicated that when the contact angle between water droplets and solid surface is <48.8°, fogging can be effectively prevented; when the WCA is greater than the critical value, the incident ray will have a total internal reflection at the air–water interface, changing the direction of the transmitted light. Additionally, the relative area of scattered light will be reduced by the droplets growing up through continuous coalescence (Fig. 11). Hence, the degree of scattered light of tiny droplets is greater than that of large droplets. Owing to the curvature of the droplet at the air–droplet interface, the light will scatter in all directions, resulting in more significant deflection at a higher contact angle. It is not difficult to understand that when water vapor condenses on the solid surface in a filmwise mode (contact angle ∼0°), the light will not change in the direction of propagation, so the transparent surface maintains good transparency.

Besides, the microstructures and coating parameters of the transparent material surface are also the key factors affecting its reflectivity. Combined with the different structures mentioned above, the interaction between incident light and surface structure will produce distinct effects at different scales:68,69 for the macrostructures whose size is far greater than the wavelength of light, the light incident on them will usually engender reflection and dispersion after being partially assimilated (Fig. 12(A)); when the interval and depth between the surface morphology of the structure have the same light wavelength size restraints, the light will be caught in the gap, leading to multiple internal reflections to minimize the light reflection (Fig. 12(B)); for subwavelength patterns or nanostructures with sizes smaller than the wavelength, light interacts completely with these structures (Fig. 12(C)). Therefore, the research on hierarchical micro/nanostructures has attracted much attention to obtain the maximum light transmittance and the minimum light diffraction and scattering. For the antifogging coating discussed in the next section, the antireflection effect is mostly achieved by designing multilayer films in a longer wavelength. At the same time, because the refractive index of light is greatly affected by the material itself, it needs to be optimized by utilizing numerical algorithms to obtain the precise thickness of each layer.70,71

The methods for endowing antifog performance to different substrate surfaces can be roughly divided into top-down and bottom-up approaches. The top-down approach is mainly based on the definition of patterns. Through laser processing,72–76 lithography,77 plasma etching,78,79 template-assisted method80–82 and other technologies, the patterns can be directly transferred to the substrate material to obtain a functional surface with antifog ability. Compared with the bottom-up method, this method can accurately control the size parameters (e.g., diameter, height, angle) and morphological characteristics (e.g., nanopillar/cone/hole arrays structure, hill/groove microstructure) of the microstructure. Specific structures and parameters are important elements affecting surface wetting behavior and optical properties. The bottom-up method mainly includes sol–gel (solution) coating,83,84 LBL assembly,85–87 chemical vapor deposition,88–91 physical vapor deposition, and redox reaction,92 which can be used to prepare antifogging coatings with patterned structures or rough surfaces on different substrate materials. In addition, there are some unconventional methods, such as casting,36,93 sparking,94 hot pressing,95,96 and blow molding,97 used to directly fabricate the antifogging surface.

3.1.1 Transparent substrates. 
Through LDW micromachining technology, He et al.26 prepared a series of superhydrophobic glass with a hexagonal micro-pit arrays structure (Fig. 1B) to effectively promote the coalescence and falling off of condensation droplets. The appropriate structure size gives the surface antifog performance and efficaciously suppresses the reflection of light. Li et al.55 used lithography technology to obtain a microlens array on the glass substrate. The graded micro/nanostructure surface composed of the microlens array and nano-hairs has superhydrophobic and antifogging properties (contact angle >160°) (Fig. 9C). Similarly, using ordinary UV lithography technology, Feng et al.98 successfully copied papillae-like microstructure arrays to the surface of PDMS film. After silylation, Krytox 1506 lubricant was applied to the surface of the film. The antifogging efficiency of the bionic slippery film was close to 100%, and the maximum transmittance in the visible light range was close to 90% (within the 90 s gradient spray).
The method of depositing a coating on the surface is theoretically applicable to any type of substrate, but the weak adhesion between the coating and the substrate makes it prone to deformation or shedding. To solve this problem, physical (such as surface roughening or etching processes) and chemical (such as plasma or corona treatments) “activation” pretreatment procedures are usually implemented before the coating deposition process to change the material activity of the substrate surface and promote its bonding strength with the coating material.99–104 For example, to ensure that the glass surface is negatively charged and has hydrophilic oxygen-containing functional groups, Wang et al.105 treated the glass with oxygen plasma in an environment of −101.4 kPa for 2 minutes and subsequently spun the mixed solution of carboxymethyl cellulose/FeCl3·6H2O/poly (acrylic acid) (CMC–Fe3+–PAA) onto the glass substrate, and dried it at 150 °C for 2 hours to obtain a multifunctional environmental protection transparent coating. The coated glass presented superhydrophilicity (WCA ∼ 4.6°) and underwater superoleophobicity (contact angle ∼154.9°, sliding angle ∼3.1°). After 80 repeats of the tape-stripping tests and 96 h of UV irradiation, the coating was able to maintain its antifogging performance (Fig. 13A). Bai et al.106 synthesized polyelectrolyte-based copolymers (P(DMAEMA-co-FMA)-b-PIM) containing different ionic monomers (cationic 2-(methacryloyloxy)-ethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (METAC), zwitterionic SBMA, or anionic 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium (SPMA)) via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.107 Then a certain amount of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) was added to the polyelectrolyte-based coating and coated on the surface of glass slides modified by plasma treatment and (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS). After UV-curing, a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) coating was formed. The results showed that the coatings containing cations and amphoteric ions had excellent antifog performance, showing the polymer–water interaction controlled by strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the coatings containing anions had a higher content of unfrozen water, showing better frost resistance (Fig. 13B).

Furthermore, in addition to the surface activation of the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) substrate through corona treatment, a thin primer (0.5 wt% aziridine homopolymer water/ethanol solution) was laid on the LDPE surface. Then the pullulan solution was coated on the surface to prepare an antifog packaging film. Due to the inherent hydrophilicity of pullulan, a continuous thin water layer was formed on the surface of the film after refrigeration, which proved that the coating had good antifogging performance and high transmittance (Fig. 13C). In addition, pullulan coatings may be of great significance as a “green” substitute for traditional antifogging additives in future applications.9 Similarly, Sason et al.108 prepared proteinoid prepolymers by adding active double bonds to proteinoid with α-amino acids via thermal step-growth polymerization and Michael addition reaction and then coated various mixtures of polyethylene glycol diacrylate, proteinoid prepolymers, and photoinitiator on corona-pretreated PET films. An array of antifogging cross-linked films was prepared after drying and UV curing. The cyclic thermal vapor fogging test and tape-stripping test showed that the coating had good durability and intense interaction with the substrate (Fig. 13D).


3.1.2 Opaque substrates. 
Unlike the transparent substrate, which is limited by the transmittance, the processing method for the opaque substrate is more extensive. Zhao et al.109 successively used ultrafast laser processing, chemical etching, and vapor deposition to process micro-cone arrays and nano-flake hierarchical structures on the surface of metal aluminum. The behavior of surface condensate droplets was studied by designing different structural sizes. The research has shown that the reasonably designed surface structure features (microcone size: 10–40 μm) make the condensate droplets go from an initial high-adhesion partial wetting (PW) state to a low-adhesion Cassie state, significantly improving the removal rate of surface jumping droplets, and showing an excellent delayed frosting effect and anti-icing performance (Fig. 14A).

Additionally, Xu et al.110 prepared the superhydrophobic 1060 Aluminum alloy mesh surface with triangular pyramidal nano-Ag structure via a facile chemical deposition method. The WCA can reach 163 ± 1°, and the contact angle of glycerol droplets can reach 158 ± 1°, showing excellent self-cleaning properties. Superhydrophobicity can reduce the corrosion rate and endow 1060 aluminum alloy with specific corrosion resistance in a simulated seawater immersion test (Fig. 14B). Liu et al.111 sprayed F323/PFOA/Al2O3 aqueous suspension on the clean substrate five times and heat treated at 130 °C for 1 h to prepare a solid water-based coating with self-healing ability. The advancing and receding contact angles of water droplets on the coated fabric surface reached 157.4° and 155.1°, respectively, and the corresponding CAH was 2.3°. The contact angles of organic droplets with different surface tensions from 72.8 to 27.47 mN m−1 remained above 150°, and the sliding angles gradually increased from 4° to 20°, showing ultra-high liquid repellency and low adhesion. In addition, the coating prepared by this method showed excellent robustness and self-repairability in sandpaper wear, sand particle impact, tape-peeling, and O2-plasma cyclic etching tests (Fig. 14C).

3.2 Coating materials
In the early stage of antifog research, considering the harm of droplets in different fields, researchers aimed to use antifog strategies to improve the affinity between a solid surface and droplets to achieve rapid fog-free state. Therefore, the study of superhydrophilic surfaces has attracted wide attention. At the same time, a hydrophilic liquid film can effectively reduce light scattering and inhibit condensation. With this in mind, antifog performance can be achieved by depositing special materials that are more hydrophilic than the substrate. Polymers are widely used in the design of hydrophilic/hydrophobic antifogging coatings due to their excellent processability, high transparency, and flexibility in adjusting their functionality through appropriate chemical reactions and preparation methods. Here, according to their chemical properties, antifog coatings are divided into three different categories, namely organic, inorganic and organic–inorganic.

3.2.1 Organic coatings. 
3.2.1.1 Natural polymers. 
Natural water-soluble polymers usually have the advantages of being non-toxic, ensure environmental protection, and are nature friendly. They can be chemically modified to boost their hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity to adjust the wetting behavior, which has widely attracted the attention of researchers.112–117 For example, Introzzi et al.9 coated the bare LDPE surface with pullulan aqueous solution twice after corona discharge of LDPE and activation of primer to prepare the coating of pullulans from the yeast-like fungus Aerobasidium pullulans. Compared with the commercial antifogging films AFa and AFb, the coated LDPE film has higher hydrophilicity (WCA ≈ 24°; the WCA values of AFa and AFb were 52° and 39°, respectively), so it has good antifogging performance (Fig. 13C). However, pure pullulan films have some drawbacks, such as poor mechanical properties, high hydrophilicity and poor antioxidant capacity.118 The results showed that the addition of other polysaccharides could effectively improve the hydrophobicity and mechanical properties of the composite films.119–121 Ding et al.122 prepared pullulan-based composite films by doping bacterial cellulose (BC) and ferulic acid (FA). The introduction of an appropriate amount of BC can improve the crystallinity of the composite film, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties, hydrophobic properties and thermal stability; it is expected to be a potential target for bioactive packaging.
Cellulose and chitosan have also been shown to be potential candidates for antifogging coatings.123,124 Manabe et al.43 extracted chitin nanofibers (CHINFs) from crab shells and used LBL self-assembly of deacetylated chitin nanofibers (dCHINF) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) thin layers to prepare porous mesh coatings with highly controllable optical properties and stability (Fig. 8B). The formation of aggregates was avoided by regulating the pH value of the solution. A uniform network structure and high porosity were produced on the surface. Further research on CHINFs as biomass resources will provide potential candidate materials for miscellaneous real applications, especially as optical applications for durable and fog-resistant surfaces working under broadband visible light wavelengths. Qian et al.125 obtained translucent CMNC–COOH dispersions by uniform carboxymethylation and protonation of a slurry of bleached softwood cellulose (SWC). Subsequently, SWC and carboxymethyl cellulose nanofibers were mixed and further modified using HMDS-SiNPs/PMMA hybrids to construct superhydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 15A(i)). The surface WCA of the prepared multifunctional cellulose-based film reached 158°. The composite film maintained excellent superhydrophobicity after bending cycles (120 times), or treating with corrosive liquids (HCl/NaOH, pH = 1–12) or moisture (at 90% RH for 120 h), suggesting that the composite film had excellent durability.

Moreover, owing to the synergistic effect of the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the protonated carboxyl groups and the potential barrier function of the superhydrophobic layer (Fig. 15A(ii)), the thin films exhibited excellent dimensional stability, such as low water expansion rate (21.79%), water absorption rate (25.12%), and wet tensile strength (∼50 MPa). These properties endow the composite films with great application potential in food packaging materials, flexible electronic devices, books, etc. Wen et al.126 prepared a series of polyvinyl alcohol/carboxymethyl chitosan/citric acid (PVA/CMCS/CA) composite films by the casting method via regulating the different mass fractions of CA. The addition of CMCS and CA affected the crystallization situation of PVA composite films, and contributed to the degradation of soil microorganisms. CA enhanced the cross-linking between PVA and CMCS, improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of PVA/CMCS/CA films, and reduced the water vapor permeability and expansion characteristics (Fig. 15B). The fabricated biodegradable films are non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and fog-proof. They have latent application value in food preservation and packaging materials. Mussel-inspired chimeric protein MP-KE is also used in the design of antifogging coatings. Based on mussel-inspired protein and zwitterionic polypeptide, Qi et al.127 prepared multifunctional protein coatings with good biocompatibility on clean glass surfaces using spraying technology. The protein coating showed super-hydrophilicity (contact angle <5°) and high light transmittance (about 88% ∼ 92%, close to 90% of the bare glass substrate), indicating that the coating has good fog resistance (Fig. 15C(i–iii)). In addition, the protein coating also delayed freezing (about 44 s later than that of bare glass), antibacterial property (98.1% reduction in colony number), and excellent hemocompatibility (Fig. 15C(iv)).
3.2.1.2 Synthetic polymers. 
Synthetic polymers used for antifogging surface design usually contain abundant hydrophilic groups on the surface, such as hydroxyl (OH), carboxyl (COOH), sulfonic acid (SO3H), phosphate (PO4H2), amino (NH2), thiol (SH), etc., which can quickly capture droplets to promote evaporation on the surface or form hydrate molecules into the polymer. Synthetic polymers have good operability, and many researchers are committed to improving the performance of coatings by adjusting the composition of synthetic polymers.
For example, inspired by the self-healing function of DNA molecules, Zhang et al.128 used poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) for esterification reaction to form a partially cross-linked network structure, thus obtaining polymer coatings with robust mechanical properties and self-healing ability. By controlling the optimum molar ratio of hydroxyl groups in PVA and carboxyl groups in PAA, the coating surface had many stable free hydroxyls, and showed excellent antifogging properties. Under the synergistic effect of PVA chain flow and surface hydroxyl, the free hydroxyl at the scratched interface will be recombined to generate hydrogen bonds so that the polymer coating can heal itself in a short time (Fig. 16A).

Studies have shown that the structural stability of PVA-containing films can be enhanced by applying multifunctional cross-linking agents. Wang and his colleagues129 prepared stable and robust polymer coatings on plasma-treated glass slides by spin-coating with PVA as the bulk material and salicylic acid (SA) as the cross-linking agent. The synergistic effect of polymer chain entanglement and hydrogen bond cross-linking gave the coating a strong water-absorption capacity, and the coating had excellent fog/frost resistance over a wide temperature range (ca. −196.6 ∼ 85 °C). The razor scraping and Young's modulus tests showed that the coating components after water swelling became mobile. The PVA and SA components diffused into each other in the scratched interface, and the destroyed hydrogen bonds could be reconstructed so that the polymer coating was healed and restored (Fig. 16B). Moreover, the stability of the PVA coating can also be improved by introducing hydrophobic monomers into the polymerization process of polymer materials. Shi et al.130 formed a solid adhesive coating of a hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymer heterogeneous network through hydrophilic PVA and hydrophobic poly 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (PTPM). The hydrophobic PTPM network had dual functions: it provided sturdy interface bonding by forming siloxane bonds with glass; and the excessive local expansion of the hydrophilic PVA network was prevented to avoid the interfacial failure and creases caused by expansion under typical fogging conditions (Fig. 16C(i and ii)). The antifog coating successfully maintained fog-free vision in two distinct scenarios (Fig. 16C(iii)).
Very recently, Lin and his colleagues131 proposed a stretchable antifogging tape (SAT), which consists of three layers: a stretchable and tough middle layer with high elastic recovery made of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which can be used for transparent materials with different curvatures; the hydrophilic top layer made of non-cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAAm) that is insensitive to environmental humidity so that it has a lasting fog-prevention ability; and a robust and reversible adhesive bottom layer made of loosely cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that is used to form adhesion between transparent materials (including glass, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and PDMS) and SATs, avoiding interface damage and surface folds (Fig. 17A(i and ii)). The fogging test results showed that SAT could effectively prevent the surface fog of glasses and goggles (Fig. 17A(iii)). In addition, SAT retains high total transmittance (>90%) and low scattering transmittance (<5%) within a longer service lifetime (193 days) under various mechanical deformation modes or high humidity.

Further down the line, linear and cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) films with acrylic acid (AA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as monomers were prepared by the iCVD process and adding tert-butyl peroxide (TBPO) initiator in the reactor (Fig. 17B(i)).132 The contact angle measurement and the antifogging test showed that the hydrophilicity of as-deposited PAA film was the strongest, and the WCA was 7.0°. The cross-linking with EGDMA raised the WCA value to 51.7°, and the copolymer coating had superior antifog performance (Fig. 17B(ii and iii)). It is worth pointing out that in the process of plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), energetic plasma glow will cause ion bombardment and a large number of monomer fragmentation problems. An initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process uses heated filaments instead of plasma to initiate polymerization, which can effectively avoid the above problems. Initiator molecules have heat-resistant chemical bonds and can easily split into free radicals at low temperatures. Free radicals react with monomer molecules to trigger chain-propagation polymerization. Deposition under low energy input can produce polymers with high retention of functional groups.
In particular, Ren et al.133 drop-cast the PEI–TA precursor solution composed of polyethylene branched (PEI) and tannic acid (TA) on the surface of clean substrates (including glass slides, Si, PS, PC, and PMMA), and dried at room temperature to obtain multifunctional coatings (Fig. 17C(i)). The bionic adhesion of TA enables the composite coating to be effectively and stably applied to the surfaces of various substrates.134 It gives the substrate surface exceptional antifogging and self-cleaning properties (WCA < 10°, PEI–TA coated safety goggles are fog-free for 2 h under 65 °C vapor condition) (Fig. 17C(ii and iii)). Antifogging, self-cleaning and antibacterial coatings have broad potential applications in optical and medical equipment.


3.2.2 Inorganic coatings. 
Inorganic materials utilized in antifogging coatings can be loosely divided into two types: (i) inherent hydrophilic materials, such as graphene oxide, SiO2, or In2O3–SnO2; and (ii) photoactive materials, such as ZnO or TiO2. Among them, the surface of SiO2 shows inherent hydrophilicity due to the silanol groups (Si–OH), its reflection index is low, and the light transmittance is higher. TiO2 thin films are transparent and change from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity under UV light irradiation so that they can be used in some special circumstances. Besides, the combination of different inorganic materials will also show acceptable wetting characteristics and antifogging effect.
In recent years, nanoporous silica materials have attracted significant attention owing to their tunable refractive index and inherent hydrophilicity. Various sizes and morphologies of SiO2 building units obtained excellent antifogging properties by increasing surface roughness and hydrophilic groups. For example, Ai et al.135 synthesized acidic sols containing poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (propylene glycol)-block-poly (ethylene glycol) (F127) using TEOS as silane precursor for dip-coating. The coating was then subjected to the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process and heat treatment at 100 °C, and then exposed to UV-O3 and ammonia vapor to prepare mesoporous silica coatings (MSCs) (Fig. 18A(i)). Among them, the maximum transmittance of UV visible light of PI/MSCs was 99.55% (10.9% higher than that of bare PI). At the same time, the more Si–O–Si bonds in the MSCs, the stronger wear resistance of the polymer. After the abrasion test, the transmission loss was low (Fig. 18A(ii)). Because the surface was relatively hydrophilic, the MSCs coating matrix showed good antifogging performance (Fig. 18A(iii)). This work revealed a general method for preparing multifunctional antireflection coatings on flexible polymers. In particular, its excellent optical and mechanical properties may promote its potential applications in the field of flexible electronics.

In addition, Xiong et al.136 immersed glass substrate directly into a solution including titanium precursor, purged and dried with N2 flow, and finally annealed in the air to form ultra-smooth transparent TiO2 film. There was no need to prepare sol or gel in advance, and the prepared films had superhydrophilicity without UV irradiation. In the nitrogen-assisted environment, the coating had a super-smooth surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 2.6 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 18B(i)). The transmittance in the visible spectral range was >87%, and the water droplets were wholly diffused within 60 ms. In addition, the hydrophilic stability test for 15 days showed that TiO2 maintained super-hydrophilicity and had excellent antifogging performance (Fig. 18B(ii)). It is worth noting that appropriate calcination and annealing temperature are very important for the fabrication of superhydrophilic TiO2 coatings with antifogging properties. Heat treatment affects the surface roughness of the material, thereby affecting the optical transparency and antifog performance of the coating.
Although TiO2 nanocoatings can obtain excellent hydrophilicity and photocatalytic decomposition ability of organic compounds under UV irradiation, thus endowing the coatings with antibacterial, self-cleaning and antifog properties, the refractive index of TiO2 (n = ca. 2.52 for anatase) seriously deviates from the optimal refractive index (n = 1.22–1.23) of nanocoatings on the glass substrate (n = 1.5). To ameliorate the transmittance of TiO2 nanocoating, the usual approach is to load nano-TiO2 on nanomaterials with low refractive indexes, such as SiO2 (n = ca. 1.5) or porous/hollow SiO2 (n = 1.0 –1.5). Taking this into account, Xi et al.137 used dendritic porous silica nanoparticles (DPSNs) loaded with small TiO2 nanoparticles as the construction block and acid-catalyzed silica sol (ACSS) as the binder to successfully construct a solid transparent antifog and self-cleaning nanocoating. The size of TiO2 nanoparticles was adjusted by controlling the amount of TiO2 precursor (Fig. 19A(i)). Among them, DPSNs@10% TiO2@ACSS showed high transmittance (90.31%), hydrophilicity (WCA ∼ 6.2°), fog resistance, and the highest photocatalytic activity and antibacterial properties (Fig. 19A(ii)). The appropriate amount of ACSS can play an essential role in the cross-linking process and significantly improve the mechanical stability of multifunctional nanocoatings.

Another major problem of TiO2 is that the broad bandgap limits its light absorption only in the ultraviolet region of sunlight. It loses its super-hydrophilicity without ultraviolet radiation. However, a coating containing TiO2 combined with a second metal oxide (such as WO3, ZnO, SiO2, or ZrO2) has been proved to induce the absorption spectrum of TiO2 to extend from ultraviolet to visible light, enhancing the hydrophilicity of TiO2 under natural light.136–139 In addition, researchers found that Fe3+ is the best effective ion to induce the absorption spectrum of TiO2 to extend from ultraviolet to visible light.34,140–142 With this in mind, Yang and his colleagues57 prepared a series of Fe3+-doped TiO2 films using the sol–gel method. The results showed that the films doped with 1.0 mol% Fe3+ could restore the super-hydrophilicity of the film under visible light irradiation, and the antifogging performance lasted for 60 days (Fig. 19B(i and ii)). From the XPS characterizations and DFT calculations, Fe3+ doping played two roles: (i) the cooperative effect of the substituted Fe3+ and the adjacent oxygen vacancy enhanced the adsorption of hydroxyl groups, thereby significantly extending the super-hydrophilic state of the film (Fig. 19B(iii)); and (ii) the adjunction of impurity levels in TiO2 reduced the energy required for photolysis and expanded the response range to the solar spectrum. The doped Fe3+ can not only improve the photolysis ability of TiO2 under sunlight, but also reinforces the stability of the hydroxyl adsorbate on the TiO2 surface.
Meanwhile, to achieve composite coatings with antifog, self-cleaning and energy-saving effects, Zheng et al.143 prepared a new multifunctional TiO2(R)/VO2(M)/TiO2(A) multilayer film by mid-frequency reactive magnetron sputtering. The bottom TiO2 layer containing the rutile phase played a role of antireflection; the VO2 layer with a dominant monoclinic phase performed automatic solar/thermal control to save energy; the top TiO2 layer including anatase and rutile mixed phase possessed remarkable photocatalytic activity and photoinduced properties (Fig. 19C(i)). The multilayers exhibited photoinduced super-hydrophilicity (∼2.1°), solar energy regulation efficiency (ΔTsol = 10.2%), and applicable luminous transmittance (Tlum-L = 30.1%), and high photocatalytic activity (Fig. 19C(ii and iii)). And further down the line, Hossain et al.144 developed a self-cleaning transparent composite coating with super-hydrophilicity (WCA ∼ 0°) and good antifogging properties by depositing a layer of KH-500-modified anatase crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles on a glass substrate (the maximum transparency in the visible region (380–780 nm) is about 70%). The addition of KH550 silane agent can effectively prevent TiO2 nanoparticles from agglomerating on the surface of the film and enhance its adhesion to the glass substrate. It is worth mentioning that compared with the TiO2 film coating modified by silica, which loses hydrophilicity due to hydroxyl groups being replaced by oxygen in the air in the dark environment, the composite coating exhibits a stable super-hydrophilicity in the dark environment.


3.2.3 Organic–inorganic coatings. 
The polymer coating can establish a tight bonding effect with the substrate, but the thickness of the coating will influence the optical properties of the transparent substrate. Inorganic components can improve the roughness of the coating and then regulate the surface wetting characteristics and optical properties. To sum up, combining inorganic materials and polymers to prepare coatings with superior performance and diversified functions has become a new approach to forming antifog surfaces.145–148
To avoid the reduction of optical transmittance caused by the thick polymer coating in the previous study,128 the authors conducted further research and deposited a layer of HSN on the top layer of the antifogging polymer formed by partial cross-linking of PVA and PAA, creating a composite film with antifogging polymer inner layer and anti-refraction outer layer (Fig. 20A(i and ii)). Condensate droplets entered the polymer layer through holes, voids, and cracks on the surface and interacted with their hydroxyl groups to prevent fog formation (Fig. 20A(iii)). In addition, due to the low refractive index of the hollow silica nanoparticles layer, the maximum transmittance of the composite coating in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm was 98.9%, and the average transmittance was 97.2% (Fig. 20A(iv)). This research put forward a novel idea for the structural design of antifogging coating: that is, the antifog layer does not inevitably need to be installed in the outermost region directly in contact with the air. Zhang et al.149 prepared a TiO2-PHEA nanocomposite coating by uniformly compounding modified anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) without any solvent and spin-coating the pre-polymerized dispersion on the substrate (Fig. 20B(i)). Due to the enhancement of inherent hydrophilicity and the increase of surface roughness, the composite showed outstanding inherent super-hydrophilicity (WCA < 3° within 0.45 s), high transmittance (>90% in the visible wavelength), and the super-hydrophilicity of the material could last for 330 days in the laboratory environment (Fig. 20B(ii and iii)).

In the process of exploring materials for the preparation of robust coatings, it is not problematic to imagine that diamond has a unique combination of excellent physical and chemical properties, such as the highest hardness, excellent wear resistance,150,151 transparency from ultraviolet to infrared,152 and good biocompatibility. Huang and his colleagues88 utilized [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (TMAEMC) to stabilize a colloidal solution of nanodiamond seeds through electrostatic self-assembly seed nucleation and hot-filament CVD growth. They attained an exceedingly high nucleation density (5 × 1011 cm−2), thus forming an ultra-thin (∼50 nm), continuous and smooth (5 nm RMS) diamond nanofilm. TMAEMC was selected as the stabilizer to make the ND surface with a positive charge, and the quaternary ammonium groups with a positive charge were used as the anchoring of NDs on the substrate surface with a negative charge to achieve a uniform and dense adsorption (Fig. 21A(i and ii)). The transmittance of coated quartz glass in air was as high as 90%, and the underwater transmittance in the UV-Vis range was 98%. After oxygen plasma treatment, the diamond film exhibited superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity, resulting in antifogging competence in air and underwater self-cleaning of oil (Fig. 21A(iii)). Furthermore, the friction coefficient of diamond-coated quartz glass decreased dramatically from 0.18 to 0.05, forming a self-lubricating surface. Ultrathin diamond nanofilms had high transparency from ultraviolet to infrared, combined with mechanical stability, antifogging and self-cleaning, and were suitable for the special requirements of optical lenses and window coating in aircraft and marine exploitation environments.

Moreover, considering that microwave dielectric heating technology has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into heat to drive chemical reactions,154,155 Okkay et al.156 used this technology to obtain a tetramethyl orthosilicate/polyvinyl alcohol (TMOS/PVA) hybrid solution (TMPV) with different PVA ratios through the optimal microwave reaction time. A superhydrophilic PVA–TMOS composite film, optically transparent and mechanically stable was prepared by coating TMPV onto glass (Fig. 21B(i)). The results showed that PVA with 0.096 (wt%) content had high mechanical properties and was superhydrophilic (Fig. 21B(ii and iii)). In the development of antifogging coatings, zwitterionic polymers stand out among hydrophilic polymers due to their excellent ability to bind water molecules. At the same time, to make these zwitterionic polymers play a role on the solid surface, it is necessary to immobilize the polymer on the solid surface effectively. It was found that the catechols in polydopamine (PDA) were easily coordinated with diverse metal ions. Therefore, catechol can be utilized as anchor sites of zwitterionic polymers by selecting appropriate metal ions. For example, Kim et al.157 screened out ZrIV metal ions inspired by mussel and successfully prepared a nano-thick zwitterionic polymer layer by grafting poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) and poly(carboxy betaine methacrylamide) (pCBMA) onto the surface of pDA coating (Fig. 21C(i)). The results showed that the polymer coating had excellent hydrophilicity (contact angle <10°), antifog ability, and high resistance to bacterial adhesion (Fig. 21C(ii)).

4 Enhancing the durability of antifogging surfaces
In the previous sections, we introduced the specific characteristics and preparation methods of antifogging surfaces in detail. Nevertheless, in real life, the durability of the antifogging surfaces is an inevitable topic, and it is also a challenging problem that many researchers aim to break through. Mechanical damage, chemical corrosion, ultraviolet radiation, etc., will seriously impair the stability of the antifogging surface. To better comprehend the methods of obtaining durable antifogging surfaces, we will focus on the following four ways to improve the durability of the antifogging surfaces, hoping that researchers in related fields can get inspiration from them.
4.1 Well-designed textured structure
Different from the self-growth recovery of the structure of the organism itself, the microstructure of the artificial antifogging surface is usually damaged or disappears due to destruction by external factors. The resulting performance failure seriously affects the wide application of antifogging structures in real life. In recent years, different surface morphologies have emerged in the field of antifogging surface preparation, such as the array structure, porous structure and hierarchical structure mentioned in the antifogging structure section. These structures appearing on different substrates or coating surfaces can be summarized as nanostructures, microstructures and hierarchical structures. Compared with nanostructures, microstructures can withstand greater pressure and play a role of buffering and shielding. Reasonable design of the structure can not only improve the antifog performance of the surface, but also improve the durability of the surface structure. In addition, using materials with the same properties at the bottom to compensate for the performance failure caused by the damage of the surface structure is undoubtedly an effective way to improve the durability.
For example, Xiang et al.63 prepared a dried rice field and pear-like double-layer coupling rough structure (Fig. 22A(i)). The WCA of the original coating surface was 2.51 ± 1°. The WCA of the coating reached 6° after 60 cycles of sandpaper abrasion. In the further wear experiment, the coating surface gradually becomes very smooth and the hydrophilicity is weakened (Fig. 22A(ii)). The friction resistance of the coating was as high as 24 m. The experimental results show that the excellent mechanical stability of the sample comes from a special structure similar to the combination of dried rice field and pear-like double-layer coupling structure. As mentioned above, the hierarchical micro-/nanostructure obtained by the coupling of the hill-like microstructures and CuO nanosheets can induce a continuous cycle of stratified condensation process,53 breaking the minimum droplet departure size limit. In the abrasive wear experiment, the micron-scale hill-like structure on the surface largely protects the nanoscale texture from mechanical wear. After four wear cycles at a pressure of approximately 550 Pa, the surface remained hydrophobic (Fig. 22B(i)) and a large number of shadow droplets were observed in the mechanically undamaged valley area (Fig. 22B(ii)). The surface remains in a cycling stratified condensation process.

Reproduced from ref. 158 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2019. 
In addition, Varshney et al.58 prepared a superhydrophobic surface with a flower-like microstructure on brass substrate by a two-step process (chemical etching with a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, followed by treatment with lauric acid), achieving high WCA (>173°) and low sliding angle (<4°) (Fig. 22C(i)). The microstructure surface showed excellent mechanical strength and chemical stability in water jet, sandpaper wear (0.2 g, >90 cm), bending and folding (180°), tape stripping (>60 times) and immersion (3.5% NaCl solution, >8 days) tests (Fig. 22C(ii)). More importantly, after the sample has lost its surface hydrophobicity due to continuous high temperature treatment, it was immersed in lauric acid ethanol solution again for 24 hours, and the static contact angle and sliding angle of the surface were restored to 170° and 5°, respectively, showing strong reproducibility. Similarly, Tran et al.73 recently reported a superhydrophobic surface prepared using laser-textured titanium, aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and nickel substrates, using nontoxic silicone oil for surface modification. The laser-treated Ti surface formed a micro–nano composite hierarchical structure, including clear microburrs and microgrooves along the laser beam path. After 150 days of aging in air, the superhydrophobic Ti surface maintained its superhydrophobic properties (contact angle ∼170°) after abrasion 110 cm (2.5 kPa). In the wear experiment, the top of the surface microburrs was removed, but the surface microgroove structure remained intact. Thus, a simple repair process of the worn hydrophobic surface by silicone oil heat treatment will restore the superhydrophobicity (contact angle >150° and sliding angle >10°) (Fig. 22D(i and ii)). In addition, the superhydrophobic surface has good acid stability and can be used in harsh acidic environments (Fig. 22D(iii)).
Due to its superhydrophobicity, the reasonably designed textured surface reduces the contact area between the surface structure and the liquid, thereby improving its ability to resist solution immersion and acid/alkali corrosion to a certain extent. In addition, the robust micro-/nanostructure can effectively resist the damage caused by wear, and the undamaged parts can be quickly restored to their original function after simple treatment, reflecting the durability of the surface structure.
It is worth mentioning that Yamauchi et al.158 reported a monolithic superhydrophobic material prepared from micrometer-scale ZnO-tetrapods and PDMS. This porcupinefish-like structure not only provided a “2D needle-like surface” but also provided a “3D porous framework” (Fig. 22E(i)). Therefore, it had excellent superhydrophobicity on any cut surface. After 1000 bending, torsion and wear tests, the superhydrophobicity remained unchanged (Fig. 22E(ii)), which was attributed to the exposure of the internal spines of the structure to the surface after the surface is worn or scratched, resulting in the formation of a new needle-like structure (Fig. 22E(iii)). The material can be used as a superhydrophobic coating for the design of durable antifogging surfaces.
4.2 Promoting molecular cross-linking
Polymer materials are widely used in the preparation of antifog coatings or films due to their excellent flexibility. Unfortunately, most of these antifogging materials made of polymer molecules are prone to dissolution failure in a long-term high humidity environment due to the low degree of intermolecular cross-linking, thus failing to provide long-term structural stability and durable antifogging activity. In order to improve the stability and durability of polymer materials, researchers usually enhance the degree of cross-linking between polymer molecules by adding cross-linking agents, UV-induced cross-linking and heat-induced cross-linking.159–162
For example, Liu and his colleagues163 synthesized an amphoteric terpolymer (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-co-butyl methacrylate-co-benzophenone, BPMPC) and covalently grafted it onto alkyl-modified glass and plastic lenses under UV irradiation (Fig. 23A(i)). The test results showed that the BPMPC copolymer coating could form a strong polymer network on the surface of the plastic and alkyl-modified glass, which remarkably improved the durability of the coating (Fig. 23A(ii)). As a cross-linking agent, benzophenone (BP) is more chemically stable than other organic cross-linking agents. It preferentially reacts with C–H bonds to form C–C bonds in various chemical environments, which is an ideal choice for cross-linking organic films.164,165 Analogously, Wen and his colleagues126 prepared a series of PVA/CMCS/CA composite films by the casting method. CA enhanced the cross-linking between PVA and CMCS, improved the mechanical properties and thermal stability of PVA/CMCS/CA films, and reduced the water vapor permeability and expansibility (Fig. 23B(i and ii)).

(iii) Changes in transmittance after repeated falling sand abrasion tests/healing cycles of the composite film (α = 1%). Reproduced from ref. 167 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2022. 
Furthermore, Maeda et al.166 prepared hybrid antifogging materials of poly(3-aminopropyl)sesquisiloxane (PAPS) and poly(3-(2-aminoethylaminopropyl)sesquisiloxane (PAEAPS) by sol–gel reactions that were autocatalyzed by the amine moieties of the monomers. Among them, PAEAPS film has high transparency and good antifogging ability under humidified conditions (Fig. 23C(i)). Based on the highly cross-linked Si–O–Si network structure, the scratch resistance of PAEAPS film is 3.2, which is 4–6 times that of the corresponding PVA film (Fig. 23C(ii)). Recently, Sato et al.167 developed a composite film with different molecular weights of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), nano-clay particles (NCPs), and amino-terminated organosilane (AOS). The cross-linking degree between PVP matrices and NCP was adjusted by controlling the weight percentage of crosslinking agent AOS added to PVP matrices (Fig. 23D(i)). When the molecular weight of PVP was the lowest (55 K) and the weight percentage of AOS was 0.01–1%, the samples were highly transparent, with durable antifogging and sand falling resistance (>90% T at 550 nm; >80% RH, 7 days without fog; a scratch with a width of about 30 μm can fully heal within hours) (Fig. 23D(ii and iii)).
4.3 Endowing self-healing ability
Through mechanical damage and environmental pollution, the antifogging surface usually loses its antifogging performance after a while. Recently, artificial self-healing materials, which can maintain their exceptional wettability throughout their life cycle, have been used as a smart strategy to facilitate the mechanochemical durability of antifogging surfaces and extend their service life.168–173
As mentioned above, Wang105 reported the CMC–Fe3+–PAA multifunctional environmental protection transparent coating. The coating formed scratches after cutting, and then under the condition of water vapor (relative humidity from 50% to 85%) wetting, the scratches disappeared rapidly. The transparency recovered completely, showing excellent self-healing performance (Fig. 24A(ii)). The self-healing ability was ascribed to the ample amounts of free hydroxyl groups of CMC scratched interfaces, which could reform hydrogen bonds in a humid environment (Fig. 24A(i)).

(ii) Optical microscopic images and photographs of the coating before and after healing. UV-vis spectra of the composite coating. Reproduced from ref. 175 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2019. 
Furthermore, Zhang et al.174 reported a highly transparent and healable antifogging coating made of biomass (pectin and TA) on PET film. In the self-healing performance evaluation test of PET-pectin/TA film, the coating could completely heal a scratch caused by sandpaper grinding and knife cutting and restore to the smooth surface within 4 minutes upon being triggered by water. The healing process was highly reproducible (Fig. 24B(i)). The healing coating could retain its antifogging performance. The self-healing mechanism could be interpreted as that the permeated water molecules would undermine the hydrogen-bonding network of the pectin/TA composite membrane, thus promoting the softening, flowability, and deformation of the coating and then triggering the rearrangement of the pectin and TA polymer chains (Fig. 24B(ii)). Liang175 demonstrated a robust, transparent antifog coating p(SBMA7-co-HEMA3) (containing 5.0 wt% silica nanoparticles) based on a silica nanoparticles-reinforced zwitterionic copolymer. The coating was subjected to repeated sandpaper friction and blade cutting, and then the damaged coating was immersed in deionized water for 2 s. The scar was completely repaired, and the transparency was recovered within 6 min at room temperature (Fig. 24C(ii)). Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions were the main strengths connecting linear polymer chains and sulfobetaine-modified nanoparticles, which revealed powerful reversibility with the assistance of water, endowing the material with water-promoted healing competence (Fig. 24C(i)).
4.4 Increasing adhesion strength
In practical applications, the coating usually peels off due to the poor stick force between coatings and substrates. Therefore, improving the adhesion between them is crucial to boost the durability of antifog coating. Generally, researchers add polymers, including PDA,176–178 PDMS,179,180etc., as adhesives or graft polymer coatings onto the surface of the substrate181 to enhance the bonding strength between interfaces.
For example, Kim et al.157 reported a novel approach for grafting zwitterionic polymer on solid substrate using pDA as the intermediate layer. In other words, pSBMA and pCBMA were grafted onto the surface of pDA coating respectively by metal coordination grafting zwitterionic polymer. Nano-thick zwitterionic polymer layers with high resistance to bacterial adhesion and fog formation were successfully prepared (Fig. 21C(i)). Additionally, pDA, as adhesive, can also be used to modify nanometer materials in addition to changing various solid substrate and film materials. In the stretchable adhesive tape proposed by Lin and his colleagues,131 an impregnable and reversible bonding bottom made of loose cross-linked PDMS was formed between transparent materials and SAT, avoiding interface damage and surface fold. In the adhesion characterization experiment, SAT still had a reversible adhesion strength of 4 kPa after 1000 cycles of attachment and detachment (Fig. 25A). Similarly, Syafiq et al.182 used the combination of aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) and PDMS as binder systems to improve the adhesion and hydrophobicity of nanoparticles to the glass substrate, and synthesized a transparent self-cleaning coating with PDMS and inorganic nano-CaCO3 as raw materials. Moreover, the collection of nanoparticles would increase the surface roughness and WCA but reduce the transparency and robustness of the developed coating.183,184 It is worth mentioning the PVA/PTPM HN strong adhesive coating developed by Shi et al.130 Here, the hydrophobic PTPM network formed covalent bonding with the glass surface by condensation with the silanol groups, which significantly increased the bonding strength of the coating. The adhesion of two slides reached 1171 ± 147 kPa and 1153 ± 58 kPa under dry and wet conditions, respectively (Fig. 25B). The interfacial toughness of the coating on the glass substrate as measured by the peeling test exceeded 350 J m−2. In addition, even for two surfaces of different materials, PVA/PTPM NH could still adhere to them.

Therefore, the coating formulation had a powerful adhesion to glass and polymer substrates under wet conditions and had the potential to be used as underwater glue. Analogously, Das et al.185 immobilized nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur co-doped carbon dots (NPSC-dots) on nonpolar plastic films (polypropylene, PP) via a photochemical covalent grafting strategy (Fig. 25C(i)). The NPSC-dot-coated PP film exhibited excellent oxidation resistance and antifogging properties. After boiling and soaking tests, the fluorescence intensity of the coating film was not changed, indicating that the coating had not deteriorated or been seriously damaged (Fig. 25C(ii)). Xu et al.186 obtained a series of terpolymers poly(AA-co-TFOA-co-BPA) by thermal polymerization of acrylic acid (AA), 1H,1H,2H,2H-tridecafluoro-n-octyl acrylate (TFOA) and 4-benzoylphenyl acrylate (BPA). Subsequently, poly(AA-coTFOA-co-BPA) was covalently grafted onto different substrate surfaces (glass slides, PC, PET, and PVC) by UV-triggered BPA anchorage (Fig. 25D(i)). The coating had excellent antifogging ability in a wide temperature range of 20 °C–8.5 °C, and the light transmittance was 90% (Fig. 25D(ii)). Among them, the coating C-5 showed high tensile strength (4.7 MPa) and no damage after 30 wear test cycles (Fig. 25D(iii)).
5 Conclusions and perspectives
In this paper, the latest research progress on antifogging surfaces is reviewed from the aspects of structure and material. The results show that the antifogging performance of solid surfaces is primarily owing to the special wettability. In general, wettability is affected by both chemical composition and microstructure of the surface, and surface chemistry determines wettability strictly. Nature is like a huge resource base. After long-term natural selection and evolution, organisms living in different environments have created many organizational structures with unique functions that inspire the exploration and design of fog-proof surfaces (Section 2). However, it is always a challenge for researchers to reveal the relationship between the composition, structure, and characteristics of biological surfaces and antifogging performance, and to explore effective bionic methods to create an artificial surface.187 Furthermore, based on the study of natural biological structures, this paper also introduces the mechanism of influence of a series of typical microstructures on the surface droplet behavior and its internal relationship with the antifog ability.
The antifogging surface obtained by microstructure has higher mechanical stability and durability than coatings, and has the advantages of not needing to introduce additional materials and not polluting the environment.188 However, due to the limitations of transparent materials at the surface microstructure scale and the excellent wetting properties, strong machinability, high transparency and adjustable function of the polymers used to prepare the antifogging coating, depositing a polymer coating directly on the surface of the substrate material is one of the simplest and most effective ways to obtain an antifogging surface (Section 3). This paper introduces the preparation method, material, and antifog performance of antifog coating in great detail. The results indicate that both natural polymers with non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and bio-friendly characteristics and synthetic polymers with a wealth of functional groups have been applied with advantage in antifogging, giving the substrate surface exceptional antifog performance. It is worth mentioning that by reasonably controlling the coating thickness and surface roughness, the antifog coating also shows outstanding antireflection ability and anti-adhesion characteristics.
In practical production and life, the interface failure and surface folding caused by mechanical damage or chemical erosion seriously affect the mechanical stability and chemical durability of antifogging coatings. Therefore, this paper introduces the latest methods and research progress for achieving durable antifogging surfaces (Section 4). These methods are mainly focused on improving the coating material itself and the adhesion strength between coatings and the base materials to improve the durability of the antifog surfaces. For the coating itself, researchers mostly utilize self-healing materials to achieve self-repairing properties after mechanical damage to extend the operation life of the coating. For strengthening the adhesion between interfaces, the treatment methods for different substrate materials, such as plasma treatment, corona treatment, and other pretreatment methods, are introduced to improve the surface chemical activity of materials. On the other hand, the ability of the coating to resist the external environment is facilitated by forming a stable chemical bond between coatings and the substrate materials. While the appeal covers a fairly comprehensive range of mainstream approaches to dealing with the problem, there are still some non-mainstream approaches that deserve attention, such as adding support structures to prevent functional surfaces from being damaged.72,189,190
Given the hazards caused by fogging in all aspects of human production and life, durable antifog surfaces suitable for a variety of specific harsh environments need to be studied urgently, as follows: (i) Exploring natural resources, constantly excavating and revealing the antifogging mechanism implied in nature and developing effective methods for bionic manufacturing; (ii) preparation of multifunctional antifog surfaces (such as anti-icing, antireflection, self-cleaning, self-lubrication, anti-biological adhesion, or sterilization) based on reasonably designed structures and materials;191–193 (iii) stimuli-responsive (force, magnetism, light, electricity, temperature, humidity, pH value, etc.) antifogging surface research, used to control surface wettability, adhesion, and liquid behavior, would expand the application scope and prospects of antifogging surfaces (liquid transport and harvesting, water energy collection, microfluidics/droplet manipulation, etc.);194–198 (iv) through the research and development of new materials, break through the dependence of the self-healing process on the external environment and promote the application of self-healing materials in practice. Simultaneously, to further enhance the adhesion strength between the antifogging coating and the substrate material, more efforts are needed to study the material and its treatment methods. We believe that with the deepening of research and the help of natural resources and advanced technology, durable antifogging surfaces can be developed to truly benefit humanity.
