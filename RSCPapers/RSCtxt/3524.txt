    , Accepted 5th March 2020First published on 6th March 2020AbstractEfficient hole transport materials in n–i–p structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been confined to 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA). However, the need for hygroscopic dopants has limited improvements in the stability of the devices. Here, we have successfully fabricated stable PSCs using a dopant-free poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) HTL. Through introducing a polyelectrolyte buffer layer (P3CT-BN), the P3HT film morphology, perovskite built-in electric field, surficial defects and the hole transfer speed were all optimized, along with significant suppression of interfacial recombination. Hence, the efficiency was improved from 13.13% to 19.23%, with a substantially improved VOC from 0.90 V to 1.10 V and FF from 63.1% to 74.2%. Simultaneously, the un-encapsulated devices also exhibited improved stability, retaining 80% of the peak PCE in the atmosphere (50% relative humidity) for 2300 h or heating at 85 °C in N2 for 400 h and 79% of the original PCE under simultaneous damp heat (60 °C/60–70% humidity) in air.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a new paradigm in the photovoltaic field because their unparalleled efficiency has increased from 3.8% (ref. 1) to 25.2% (ref. 2) in the last decade. The high efficiency of PSCs benefits from their excellent optoelectronic properties, including high absorption coefficient values,3 ambipolar charge transport properties,4 tunable energy levels,5 and high charge-carrier diffusion lengths.6 In spite of the rapid growth in photovoltaic performance, the large-scale deployment of perovskite materials is restricted by issues about their stability. Perovskite materials are sensitive to humidity,7 O2,8 heat9 and UV light,10 which could accelerate material decomposition. Recently, researchers have been inclined to focus on the scale production of devices under practical application conditions.
The perovskite active layer is typically sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL) in both normal (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structured devices. In addition to the charge transport function, these interfacial layers also play an important role in device stability.11–13 For instance, hygroscopic and acidic poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) may accelerate the degradation of the perovskite layer and corrode the FTO or ITO glass substrate;14,15 a TiO2 ETL may influence the stability of PSCs due to its instability to UV.16 In normal structured PSCs, doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) are two routinely used HTLs to achieve a state-of-the-art performance.17,18 However, the use of dopants to increase mobility is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the hygroscopic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) makes the HTL highly hydrophilic and the lithium ion is apt to migrate toward the perovskite layer, showing a tendency towards chemical degradation, negatively influencing the stability of the entire device.19 The gradual evaporation of tert-butylpyridine (tBP) dopants in the HTL and its corrosive reaction with perovskite led to a new threat to the long-term stability of PSCs.20,21 On the other hand, as a small molecule, the spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD film usually forms many pinholes with an uneven surface due to its amorphous nature and the immiscibility of the Li-TFSI. The presence of pinholes largely degrades the optoelectronic properties and long-term stability of the resulting device.22 It has been reported that using Zn(II)-TFSI instead of Li-TFSI as a dopant could improve the maximum power output stability for the lower migration of Zn ions.23,24 In addition, another strategy was to develop new hole transport materials (HTMs) which could reach high performances and good stabilities simultaneously. Different categories of HTMs, such as small molecular, π-conjugated polymers, organometallic complexes and inorganic salts, have been developed and employed in normal structured PSCs.25–27
Among these, commercialized poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a potential alternative because of its excellent photovoltaic properties,28 low cost,29 ease of fabrication30 and high hydrophobicity. Despite these advantages, devices with P3HT usually exhibited poor performance, especially low open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to non-radiative recombination,31 relatively lower electron lifetime32 and inefficient charge transfer33 at the perovskite/P3HT interface. To overcome these issues, P3HT has been doped with Li-TFSI,34 tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (Co(II)-TFSI),35 tetrafluoro-tetracyano-quinodimethane (F4TCNQ),36 carbon materials,37–39 copper(II) phthalocyanine (N-CuMe2Pc)41 and triphenylamine derivatives,42 but the efficiency of their devices was not comparable to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD based devices, especially in a planar structure.43 All of them were dependent on additives which were harmful to the reproducibility and stability of the device. What is inspiring is that Noh and Seo et al. inserted a thin layer of wide-bandgap halide perovskite between the narrow-bandgap light-absorbing layer and the P3HT HTL, which could effectively reduce recombination at this interface and reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.7% and also achieved high stability both under 85% relative humidity and under operational conditions in a mesoporous structure device.44 To give an intuitive display, representative work focusing on improving the efficiency and stability of P3HT based devices is listed in Table 1. A more comprehensive display of the performance of control and modified devices along with the device structure based P3HT HTL can be seen in Table S1.†

This work




In this work, we introduced a polyelectrolyte interlayer (poly [3-(4-carboxylatebutyl) thiophene] (P3CT)) between the perovskite active layer and the P3HT HTL. In our previous work, P3CT was used as a highly effective HTL in both normal and inverted structured PSCs when reacting with butylamine (P3CT-BN, Fig. S1†) and methylamine (P3CT-MA), respectively.45,46 P3CT-BN could dissolve in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol solvent (Fig. S2†) which did not damage the perovskite underlayer during the spinning process. The effective charge transfer and passivation function of P3CT-BN were also proved. Therefore, we utilized these advantages of P3CT-BN to improve the charge transfer and reduce the recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface. Because of the analogous structures of P3CT-BN and P3HT, the P3HT film growth on perovskite was optimized. Moreover, the highly hydrophobic P3HT could act as a water proofer and dramatically improved the device stability. As a result, we achieved an efficiency improvement from 13.13% to 19.23% after introducing P3CT-BN, with an apparent increase in VOC (from 0.90 to 1.10 V) and fill factor (FF) (from 63.1% to 74.2%) in a planar structured device, benefiting from the reduced charge recombination and improved charge transfer at the perovskite/HTL interface. More importantly, the dopant-free P3HT HTL gave the relevant devices stability to high humidity and thermal stability, retaining 80% of the original PCE after aging in a 50% humidity atmosphere for 2300 h or at 85 °C heating in N2 glovebox for 400 h, and 79% of the original PCE after heating at 60 °C in air (60–70% humidity). The operational stability in an N2 atmosphere also apparently improved (retaining 97% after operating for nearly 34 hours) for the reduced traps states at the perovskite/HTL interface.
Results and discussion
We fabricated a normal structured PSC with the configuration ITO/SnO2/perovskite/P3CT-BN/P3HT/Au, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The energy level of each functional layer is shown in Fig. 1b.43 The energy band levels of the CsFAMA based active layer were measured and calculated from ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS) and UV-Vis absorption measurements (Fig. S3†). P3HT had a shallow HOMO level (−4.96 eV) which does not match any valence band level of perovskite (VB, −5.61 eV) and may result in energy loss when charges transfer at this interface. A matched energy band level was formed after inserting a thin P3CT-BN layer (∼10 nm) benefiting from the matched HOMO level between P3CT-BN (−5.22 eV) and perovskite. Fig. 1c and d shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite film with and without a P3CT-BN overlayer, which was thin enough to discern the perovskite grain underneath it. Along with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image (Fig. 1e–l), the P3CT-BN could form a dense and uniform film on the perovskite layer. The film root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreased from 13.1 nm to 12.1 nm after coating P3CT-BN on perovskite, and decreased further to 7.97 nm when the P3HT layer was deposited. However, when the P3HT was directly deposited on perovskite film, an uneven film with a high RMS of 24.3 nm resulted, which is also shown in the SEM images (Fig. S4†). It seems that the existence of a P3CT-BN interlayer improves the P3HT molecular orientation and the P3HT film smoothness, which is important to obtain satisfactory electrical contact with an Au electrode.47 We measured the hole mobility of pristine P3HT and a P3CT-BN/P3HT bilayer using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method from a hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au. An increased mobility from 1.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.14 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved with the existence of P3CT-BN (Fig. S5†), because the charge–transport properties of the P3HT polymer are highly dependent on the morphology.28 In the hole-only device, the P3HT film morphology was in accordance with that in the PSCs; therefore, the calculated hole mobility could represent that in the real cells (Fig. S6†).

In addition to morphology and energy level, it has been recognized that the polymer molecule of P3HT could not completely infiltrate into the pinhole traps at the perovskite surface, and the charges tended to recombine before finding a suitable site for charge transfer.33 Therefore a buffer layer that could interact with perovskite and act as a bridge for hole transfer from perovskite to the HTL was necessary for P3HT based PSCs. Here, we have conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements combined with low-energy Ar+ cluster ion sputter depth profiling to probe the interactions on the P3CT-BN/perovskite interface. The ITO/perovskite (A), ITO/perovskite/P3CT-BN (10 nm) (B) and ITO/perovskite/P3HT (10 nm) (C) samples were all etched layer-by-layer with each step having a thickness of 10 nm (Fig. 2). The intensities of the Pb 4f and I 3d XPS spectra were monitored at each step in the depth profiling. The “surface” curve indicates the XPS signal before etching for sample A, while the XPS signals after one-step etching (10 nm per step) are indicated for sample B and C. It was apparent that even the bare perovskite sample showed a shift to high binding energy after etching owing to the Pb-rich surface of the perovskite film synthesized by a two-step method. However, the peak position of sample B was always higher than that of sample A at the “surface” and at “−10 nm depth”, and was consistent with sample A at “−20 nm depth”. Meanwhile, the peak position of sample C was higher than that of sample A at the “surface”, indicating the interaction between Pb and the thiophene unit in P3HT,48 and was consistent with sample A at “−10 nm and −20 nm depth”. The shift in Pb 4f and I 3d XPS signals to higher core-level binding energies of sample B indicated the presence of interaction between P3CT-BN and the Pb atom, which still existed under this interface of ∼10 nm.44 The peak positions with corresponding values in Fig. 2 are also shown in Tables S2 and S3.† These results were in accordance with our previous work where the CO have strong interactions with bare Pb at the perovskite surface (Fig. 2e). As a result, we concluded that P3CT-BN could passivate the perovskite surface and up to dozens of nanometers below it. This sufficient contact and passivation facilitated charge transfer at the perovskite/HTL interface, consequently reducing the interfacial trap states and the recombination rate.

After optimizing the P3HT film morphology and perovskite/P3HT interfacial contact, the device performance underwent a dramatic improvement. Fig. 3a illustrates the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion solar cells based on a P3HT HTL with and without a P3CT-BN interlayer. The highest PCE of 19.23% was achieved after inserting a P3CT-BN layer between perovskite and P3HT at a reverse bias scan. Meanwhile, the serious hysteresis behavior was largely suppressed (Fig. S7 and Table S4†). A stabilized PCE of 18.90% and a stabilized JSC of 21.97 mA cm−2 were achieved when biased at 0.86 V in a maximum power point tracking system for nearly 34 h (Fig. 3b). This efficiency was comparable with doped Spiro-OMeTAD based devices (Fig. S8†) and at the top of the P3HT based devices, as shown in Table 1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 3c) showed high quantum conversion efficiency throughout the whole wavelength range with an integrated JSC of 22.52 mA cm−2 calculated from the full EQE spectrum, which was highly consistent with the JSC value obtained from the J–V measurement. Yet the J–V curves and the detailed photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2 both showed a poor PCE of 13.13% for the control device, and the VOC (0.90 V) and FF (63.1%) were especially low. To validate the reproducibility of these parameters, we analyzed the photovoltaic parameters of 15 randomly collected devices from two batches (Fig. 3d and S9†). The statistical data showed that the control devices delivered a VOC lower than 1.0 V and an FF of around only 60%, which were substantially improved even when only several nanometers of P3CT-BN were employed. However, when the P3CT-BN layer was too thin, it could not form a dense coverage on perovskite with a wider efficiency distribution. Conversely, when its thickness increased (3 mg ml−1) the FF and PCE also declined dramatically, which was caused by the increase in charge transfer and transport resistance at the perovskite/P3HT interface. Consequently, an excellent and highly reproducible performance was achieved based on a 10 nm thick (2 mg ml−1) P3CT-BN interlayer.

To further correlate the relationship between the improved VOC, FF and the interfacial charges transfer/transport behavior, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of the perovskite film covered with different HTLs were measured. The PL spectra of perovskite film, perovskite/P3CT-BN/P3HT and perovskite/P3HT are shown in Fig. 4a. The P3CT-BN interlayer showed a remarkably higher quenching efficiency than the single P3HT HTL, indicating that promoted charges separate at the perovskite/P3CT-BN interface. The existence of P3CT-BN at this interface significantly facilitated the PL decay rate, exhibiting a shorter PL decay than pristine perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 4b. The PL decay curves of pristine perovskite and perovskite/HTL bilayer were fitted by two-exponential models, in which the PL lifetime was considered to be the sum of fast- and slow-decay components that gave a short-lifetime τ1 and a long-lifetime τ2, respectively.49 The lifetimes of pristine perovskite film were 65 ns and 650 ns for τ1 and τ2, respectively. In the case of glass/perovskite/P3HT, the fast-decay lifetime τ1 was 17.68 ns with a 32.4% ratio and the slow-decay lifetime τ2 was 432 ns with a 67.4% ratio. In the case of glass/perovskite/P3CT-BN, the fast-decay lifetime τ1 was 12.76 ns with a 40.28% ratio and the slow-decay lifetime τ2 was 302.76 ns with a 60.42% ratio. For glass/perovskite/P3CT-BN/P3HT, both τ1 and τ2 were shortened to 5.58 ns and 204 ns with ratios of 42.7% and 57.4%, respectively. The average recombination lifetimes (τave) were estimated with the τi and Ai values from the fitted curve data using the equation: (1)

The τave for perovskite and P3HT, P3CT-BN, P3CT-BN/P3HT HTL covered perovskite were 622 ns, 424 ns, 295 ns and 200 ns, as listed in Table S5.† The shortened τave with the presence of P3CT-BN could be interpreted as the improved interfacial charge transfer or increased recombination at the interfacial trap states. To exclude the latter possibility and prove the decreased trap-state density, we measured the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) for different bias voltages using the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/P3CT-BN/P3HT or P3HT/Au), as shown in Fig. 4c. The trap filled limit voltages (VTFL) of the perovskite films covered with P3CT-BN/P3HT and P3HT are 0.49 and 0.64 V, respectively. The trap-state density can be determined from the VTFL using the equation:50  where q is the elementary charge of the electron, L is the perovskite film thickness, and ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity. Therefore, the trap-state density was reduced from 1.41 × 1016 cm−3 to 1.08 × 1016 cm−3 after inserting a P3CT-BN interlayer, indicating its trap passivation function in accordance with our previous report.44 We also measured the light intensity dependence of the VOC of two devices with and without P3CT-BN, which provided more details about the predominant trap-assisted recombination process caused by deep-level trap states (Fig. 4d). The light intensity–VOC slope represented the recombination process caused by trap states in the optoelectronic devices. It could be seen that the slope values of devices with and without P3CT-BN were 1.56 and 2.12, respectively, which indicated that P3CT-BN could reduce interfacial traps. Simultaneously, it was concluded the shortened τ1 was the result of effective interfacial charge transfer.
In order to further explore the interfacial characteristics as well as the recombination process of the devices, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis were performed. EIS was measured under light over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz under simulated AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination at 1.2 V bias with an oscillation potential amplitude of 20 mV. The Nyquist plots of two devices with and without a P3CT-BN interlayer consisted of one arc at high frequencies and a second arc at low frequencies (Fig. 4e). The absence of transmission line (TL) behavior, which is usually associated with significant tail states of SnO2, is likely to be due to the very thin SnO2 layer employed in the devices.51 Therefore the simplified circuit model shown in the inset represents the case in which no TL is observed. Since the ETL and perovskite active layer were the same, the high-frequency arc in the Nyquist plots was attributed to the diffusion resistance of holes through the HTM (RHTM), in parallel with HTM capacitance (CHTM). The lower frequency arc was attributed to a recombination resistance (Rrec), in parallel with the chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the system. Consequently, the decreased RHTM and increased Rrec with the presence of P3CT-BN indicated the improved extraction/transport of charge, as well as the weakening of the accumulation of charge at the perovskite/HTL interface. In addition, Mott–Schottky analysis from the capacitance–voltage measurements at a frequency of 1 kHz also helps to find how the interfacial charge accumulation affects the potential barrier (Fig. 4f). It has been reported that the capacitance spectrum of PSCs presents three clear regions that have been associated with different mechanisms (Fig. S10†), including a capacitance excess (Cs) arising from electrode polarization phenomena, the geometrical capacitance per unit area (Cg) governed by the polarizability of the material, and the depletion layer capacitance Cdl at the interfacial region, and the MS analysis was meaningful only when Cdl was clearly identified.52 The Cdl can be approximated as a function of the applied bias V as: (2)where Vbi is the built-in potential, V is the applied bias, A is the active area, and q is the elementary charge. ε is the static permittivity. ε0 is the permittivity of free space. NA is the interfacial charge density. Fig. 4f illustrates C−2–V characteristics of the P3CT-BN based and control devices without an electron transport layer (ETL). The intersection of the dotted straight line with the bias axis gave Vbi, and its slope in the Cdl region gave NA. The Vbi of the P3CT-BN based device was 0.86 V, which was much higher than that of the control device (0.71 V). The decreased flat-band potential for the control device may stem from the trap-assisted charge recombination at the perovskite/P3HT interface which reduced the energetic offset between the quasi Fermi level of perovskite and P3HT. Moreover, the slopes were estimated to be −3.08 × 1014 and −1.67 × 1014 for devices with and without the P3CT-BN interlayer; accordingly the interfacial charge densities were 1.59 × 1017 cm−3 and 2.94 × 1017 cm−3, indicating the effective charge transfer at the perovskite/P3CT-BN interface. Therefore, our strategy of inserting a polyelectrolyte layer between perovskite and P3HT was effective at improving interfacial transfer and reducing interfacial recombination.
The stability of HTMs in regular structured PSCs is a hot issue due to the necessity of dopants to a Spiro-OMeTAD HTL. To detect the effect of dopant-free and hydrophobic P3HT on the device stability, we monitored the long-term stability of devices based on a P3CT-BN/P3HT HTL under 50% relative humidity at room temperature (Fig. S11†), which maintained 80% of its original efficiency after 2300 h. The improvement in humidity stability profited from the proof function of the P3HT layer, in accordance with the static contact angles (α) of a deionized water droplet on P3HT (109.63°) (Fig. S11b†). In addition to humidity stability, thermal stability is also a tricky problem concerning solar cells which will typically have to operate at temperatures up to 85 °C. We tested the thermal stability of the two devices heated at 85 °C in N2. The bilayer HTL devices retained 80% of their original efficiency after heating for 400 h, whereas the control devices broke down within only 2 days (Fig. 5a). It has been reported that small-molecule Spiro-OMeTAD would crystallize and low-boiling tBP additive would volatilize under thermal stress and create pathways that allow for an interaction of the perovskite and the metal electrode (Fig. S12†). The polymeric P3HT film with high uniformity could avoid this degradation pathway. This P3CT-BN/P3HT based device also showed improved stability under simultaneous damp heat (60 °C/60–70% relative humidity) in air, retaining 79% of its original performance after 386 h (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the P3CT-BN incorporated full devices could maintain 96% of the original stable PCE tracked at maximum power point (MPP) for nearly 34 hours, whereas the devices with only P3HT HTL degraded completely (Fig. 5c). This phenomenon indicated that the better contact and reduced trap states at the perovskite/HTL interface facilitated device stability against bias and light.

Conclusions
We inserted a polyelectrolyte buffer layer (P3CT-BN) at the perovskite/P3HT interface and used them as a dopant-free HTL in regular structured PSCs. The P3CT-BN buffer layer improved the P3HT film quality on perovskite and showed a suitable energy level with perovskite. The interaction between P3CT-BN and perovskite reduced the perovskite/HTL interfacial trap states and improved hole transfer at this interface. As a result, the performance of P3CT-BN/P3HT based devices reached 19.23%, with a VOC up to 1.10 eV. Furthermore, the dopant-free P3CT-BN/P3HT bilayer also improved the stability of the PSC, especially with 80% of the original PCE being retained after heating at 85 °C for 400 h in N2 atmosphere, and 79% of the original stable PCE after heating at 60 °C for 386 h in an atmosphere with 60–70% humidity.
