    , Accepted 14th July 2020First published on 1st September 2020AbstractBased on 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBrTBT), novel solar cell materials are designed via silicon-doping with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the GGA/PW91/DNP level. Comparison and selection of stable configurations, stable energy, and frontier orbital energy gaps indicate that DBrTBT-Si(1) is the optimal configuration when the C(1) atoms on the benzene ring of DBrTBT are replaced by Si atoms. To further explore the photovoltaic properties of DBrTBT-Si(1), DFT calculations of the periodic plane slab model are used to investigate DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorbed on ZnSe(100) and ZnSe(111) surfaces, respectively. The stable structures, Mulliken charges, frontier orbitals, and density of states are further discussed in detail. The results indicate that the band gap between valence band and conduction band becomes wider when DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, and the Eg (1.31 eV) of the ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) is close to that of the single-crystal Si. This study potentially guides the development of future photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have been under extensive research in recent years as potential materials for applications in optoelectronic devices like organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, and organic field-effect transistors.1,2 Therefore, organic optoelectronics has played a major role in both academic and industrial research.3 Harvesting energy directly from sunlight using PV cells, which is a renewable resource, is a rather important way to alleviate the growing global energy needs, while minimizing harmful effects on the environment.4 The highly electron-deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit is one of the most popular building blocks in organic electronics.5 In recent years, molecular design based on element doping and introducing functional groups into molecular skeletons have been widely used to change OSCs and enhance the performance of OPV devices.5–12 The relevant band gaps, energy levels, and geometries are all crucial factors to determine the power conversion efficiencies in terms of the short-circuit current density, the open-circuit voltage, and the fill factor.13 To further modulate the frontier molecular orbitals as well as other important material parameters, chemical modifications of the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit have received much interest.3,5,12,14–16 One of these intelligent design strategies is the addition of silicon in the chemical structure of 4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT)7,17 according to the fact that most better-performing OSCs have silicon atoms.18,19 Although many proposals of changing the DTBT structures have been proposed to regulate the power conversion efficiency of solar cells, it is still a great challenge to design a low band gap structure.3,12,20–23 Inspired by these facts, we have designed three solar cell materials via silicon-doping on the benzene ring of 4,7-di(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (abbreviated as DBrTBT in subsequent discussions, and the corresponding structure is shown as Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Our interests mainly lie in understanding fully the stable configurations, stable energies and frontier orbital energy gaps in order to harness their utility in prospective solar cell device applications.
ZnSe is an important wide band gap II–VI polar semiconductor with a high electron mobility (200–280 cm2 V−1 s−1)24,25 and has been used in various optoelectronic devices, for instance, the blue-ultraviolet photodetectors, light-emitting diodes, sensors, photocatalysts, blue laser diodes, etc.26–30 Recent studies have shown that hybrid organic–inorganic nanomaterials are promising devices for inexpensive, large-scale solar energy conversion,31,32 can well combine the advantages of organic and inorganic nanomaterials, and have high research value.33–37 For example, the synergistic effect of rGO and nanoparticles can give rise to enhanced performance and sometimes can even lead to novel properties, which are not present in their individual counterparts.37–40 To further understand the PV properties of silicon-doped DBrTBT, our present work also discussed the microscopic properties of heterostructures formed by organic DBrTBT/DBrTBT-Si(1) and semiconductor ZnSe. The surface energy of the ZnSe(111) plane is known to be significantly lower than those of others surfaces,24 and Zhou et al.27 have also discussed the ZnSe triatomic monolayer (100) plane by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, DFT combined with the periodic plane slab model (PPSM) method41 was used to simulate the adsorption of silicon-doped DBrTBT on the semiconductor ZnSe(100), and (111) surfaces, respectively. The electron transfer, frontier orbital and density of states of the heterojunctions were discussed, and good results were obtained. The present theoretical study is of vital significance for optimizing nanostructured devices, guiding relevant experiments and providing reasonable explanations for experimental observations.42
2. Model construction and computational methods
The establishment of ZnSe(100) and (111) surface models is similar to the model that Zhang et al.43 studied for the SF6 molecule interacting with an Ag(111) surface. The 4 × 4 × 5 PPSM was constructed to simulate the ZnSe(100) and (111) surfaces with a vacuum space of 30 Å perpendicular to the slab surface. For ZnSe(100), the cell origin of the lattice parameters is (−5.668, 0.000, and 0.000) Å, and it has a three atom single-layer thickness of 3.0 Å. For ZnSe(111), the cell origin of the lattice parameters is (−3.778, −3.778, and −3.778) Å, and it has a four atom single-layer thickness of 3.3 Å. The calculation model shown in Fig. 1 has four side views and two top views, respectively. In the calculation process, the relaxation was taken into account only for the organic molecule and two layer atoms on the top, while the three layer atoms at the bottom were fixed.44

In the calculation, the spin polarized calculation with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PW91 functional was utilized for the exchange–correlation function.45,46 The double numerical polarization (DNP) basis set was adopted. For the H, C, N and O atoms, the whole electronic basis set was applied; for the Si, Se, Br and Zn atoms, the effective core potential pseudo-potential basis set was used. The integral quality was set as fine, and only the gamma point is involved in our calculations. All these calculations have been performed using the Fine quality setting and with a real space cutoff of 4.4 Å. The convergence criteria for geometry optimization are 1 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1, 0.005 Å, and 1 × 10−6 Ha for the energy, force, displacement, and self-consistent field density, respectively. In the calculation, all structures identified as stationary points are subject to full-frequency analysis to verify their classification as equilibrium geometries (zero imaginary frequencies). All these calculations have been performed using the Dmol3 code as implemented in the Accelrys Materials Studio 5.5.47,48
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Performance analysis of Si-doped DBrTBT
The silicon-doped DBrTBT was modified as described in the study by Zhang et al.49 on Co-doped MoS2 clusters. The C atomic numbering and new molecular design process of the benzene ring C atom in DBrTBT replaced by a Si atom at the 1, 2 and 6 positions are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), there are three kinds of position isomers of benzene ring C via the single C-to-Si substitution due to the C2v symmetry of DBrTBT, which are the 1 (4), 2 (3), 6 (5), positions on the benzene ring, respectively. When the C atom in the 1, 2, and 6 positions on the benzene ring was replaced by a Si atom, the compound was named DBrTBT-Si(1), DBrTBT-Si(2), and DBrTBT-Si(6), respectively. All three optimal configurations are presented in Fig. S2–S4 in the ESI.† From the structural parameters in Fig. S1–S4 (ESI†), the bond lengths were as follows: C–C, 1.368–1.484 Å; C–Si, 1.757–1.822 Å (1.774–1.941 Å50); N–Si, 1.692 Å; C–N, 1.343–1.353 Å; N–S, 1.636–1.660 Å; C–S, 1.730–1.770 Å; C–Br, 1.896–1.905 Å; C–H, 1.090 Å; and Si–H, 1.478 Å, which were all within the normal range. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the distance between the H atom on the benzene ring and the S atom on the thiophene was 2.634 Å, which was consistent with the value reported in the literature (2.64 Å),5 which thus further verified the validity of the selected calculation method.
 Fig. 2  The C atomic numbering and new molecular design process of the benzene ring C atom in DBrTBT replaced by a Si atom at the 1, 2 and 6 positions, respectively. 
In particular, from the side view, all the molecules still remain in a perfect planar structure when the C atoms of the benzene ring are replaced by Si atoms (Fig. 2). Although Si prefers sp3 to sp2 hybridization, a planar structure could be formed by mixing C and Si.50 Wang et al. synthesized compounds with a CSiSiC chain structure, where the Si atoms were sp2 hybridized.51 Thus, when the C atoms in the 1, 2, and 6 positions on the benzene ring were replaced by Si atoms, respectively, the structure remains as a planar structure.
The relative energies (ΔE) and the frontier orbital energy gaps (Eg) of the DBrTBT and the silicon-doped DBrTBT are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, when the C atoms of the benzene ring are replaced by Si atoms, the calculated ΔE shows the following trend: ΔE(2, 5) < ΔE(3, 4) < ΔE(6, 7), and the calculated Eg shows the following trend: Eg(2, 5) < Eg(6, 7) < Eg(3, 4). Thus, when the C(1) atom on the benzene ring was replaced by a Si atom, the structure was more stable, and the Eg (1.35 eV) was relatively low.

To elucidate the PV performance of the DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(x) (x = 1, 2, and 6), the UV-vis absorption spectra of DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(x) were simulated by the GGA/PW91 function and the RPA TD-DFT method, which are presented in Fig. 4. All data required for Fig. 4 are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† In Fig. 4(a), DBrTBT exhibits two distinct absorption bands; one was located at the high-energy region (300–400 nm) with the strongest absorption located around 384 nm, and the other one exhibiting a relatively broader absorption was located at the low-energy region (530–580 nm) with the strongest absorption wavelength peaking at 574 nm, induced by a typical intramolecular charge-transfer.6

In Fig. 4(b), DBrTBT-Si(1) also exhibits two distinct absorption bands; one located at the high-energy region (300–450 nm) with three peaks at 351, 397, and 431 nm, respectively; and the other relatively broader one located at the low-energy region (570–620 nm) and the strongest absorption wavelength is 593 nm. In Fig. 4(c), except for an additional absorption peak at 444 nm in the high-energy region, DBrTBT-Si(2) overall exhibits the same spectrum as that of DBrTBT. In Fig. 4(d), DBrTBT-Si(6) also exhibits two distinct absorption bands, at the high-energy region (300–430 nm), the strongest absorption wavelength is 402 nm, and a relatively broader one at the low-energy region was basically the same as that of DBrTBT-Si(1). Data show that when the benzene ring C(1) and C(6) of the DBrTBT are replaced by Si atoms, respectively, the absorption band is red shifted. This is consistent with Chen et al.'s7 results, which indicated that the Si-bridged DTBT exhibits a red-shifted absorption peak.
Additional data analyses show that, when the C(2) and C(6) atoms are replaced with Si atoms, respectively, there are two absorption wavelengths falling within the range of the visible region (400–700 nm52), however, when the C(1) is replaced by a Si atom, there are three absorption wavelengths falling within the range of the visible region, and the strongest absorption peak appeared at 397 nm.
3.2 Analysis of Mulliken charges
To analyze Mulliken atomic charges and frontier orbital characteristics, the DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorbed on the ZnSe(100) and the ZnSe(111) surfaces were examined, respectively. Fig. 5 lists the Mulliken atomic charges of the C and Si atoms on the benzene ring of the DBrTBT and the DBrTBT-Si(1); the charges of the Si atoms are set in bold italics. All of the other Mulliken atomic charges are presented in Fig. S5–S12 (ESI†), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, when C(1) is replaced by Si, both C(2) and C(6) adjacent to Si gain electrons, and their charges change from 0.173 and −0.087 e to −0.181 and −0.483 e, respectively, while the charges of the other three C atoms do not change much. During adsorption, on the benzene ring of the ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, all of the C atoms gain electrons except C(3) and C(6), and all of the C atoms gain electrons except C(2) on the benzene ring of the ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT. When DBrTB-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(100) surface, the Si, C(2), and C(6) atoms lose 0.017, 0.044 and 0.028 e charges, respectively, while C(3), C(4), and C(5) gain charges. When DBrTB-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, the Si, C(2), C(3), and C(6) atoms lose 0.036, 0.074, 0.055, and 0.067 e charges, while C(4) and C(5) gain 0.001 and 0.026 e charges, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the charge of the Si-doped benzene ring atoms changed more during adsorption.

For Fig. S5–S12 (ESI†), data analysis indicates that, when DBrTBT is adsorbed on the ZnSe(100) and (111) surfaces, 0.892 e and 0.475 e are transferred from the ZnSe(100) and (111) surfaces to DBrTBT, respectively. On the other hand, when DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(100) and (111) surfaces, 0.441 e is transferred from the ZnSe(100) surface to the DBrTBT-Si(1); in contrast, 0.109 e is transferred from the DBrTBT-Si(1) to the ZnSe(111) surface.
3.3 Analysis of the frontier orbital
The properties of organic monomers and adsorption configurations were evaluated by frontier orbital analysis based on optimized molecular geometries.53 Zhang et al.49 discussed the HOMO and LUMO of Co-doped MoS2 clusters by the functional GGA/PW91, and Lin et al.54 also discussed the HOMO and LUMO of the molecules and crystals of terraphenyl derivatives of group IVA elements by the functional GGA/PW91. Similarly, we have studied the frontier orbitals of all configurations by the functional GGA/PW91.The electron density plots (EDPs)8 of the HOMO and LUMO for DBrTBT, DBrTBT-Si(1), and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) are presented in Fig. 6, and the others are provided in Fig. S13 (ESI†). For Fig. 6(a1) and (a2), the HOMO EDPs are well-delocalized over the whole conjugated backbone, while LUMO EDPs are mainly distributed on the electron accepting benzothiadiazole, distinguished from the HOMO level, which is consistent with previous reports.8,12,15,21,51 As shown in Fig. 6(b1) and (b2), although the EDPs of the HOMO and LUMO in DBrTBT-Si(1) are mostly clustered on the conjugated double bonds, a significant change in DBrTBT occurs because of the heteroatomic substitution.6,7,55 Notably, DBrTBT-Si(1) has a large off-domain π bond, owing to the particular orbital interactions (σ*–π* conjugation) between Si and the π-conjugated framework,7 the HOMO EDPs are more hypertrophic on the Si atoms in DBrTBT-Si(1); however, more hypertrophic LUMO EDPs are found near the Si atoms.
 Fig. 6  Electron density plots (EDPs) of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). (a1) DBrTBT-HOMO, (a2) DBrTBT-LUMO, (b1) DBrTBT-Si(1)-HOMO, (b2) DBrTBT-Si(1)-LUMO, (c1) ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1)-HOMO, and (c2) ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1)-LUMO. 
As shown in Fig. S13(a1) and (a2) (ESI†), the HOMO EDPs are mainly distributed on the Zn3d orbitals, while the LUMO EDPs are mainly distributed on the Zn4s and Se5s orbitals. However, as shown in Fig. S13(d1) and (d2) (ESI†), the HOMO EDPs are mainly distributed on the Zn3d and Se4p orbitals, and the Se4p orbital is the main contributor, while the LUMO EDPs are mainly distributed on the Zn4s and Se5s orbitals, and the Se5s orbital is the main contributor.
As shown in Fig. S13(b1–2) and (c1–2) (ESI†), when DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorb on the ZnSe(100) surface, respectively, the aggregation locations of the HOMO and LUMO EDPs are no longer organic molecules, but are concentrated on the Zn3d and Se4p orbitals. The reason for this change is that the ZnSe(100) surface transfers charge to DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) molecules during the adsorption process, resulting in the loss of electrons of the already full Zn3d and Se4p orbitals. The specific data of partial atomic charge in several configurations are shown in Fig. S5–S7, S9, and S10 (ESI†).
As shown in Fig. S13(e1–2) (ESI†) and Fig. 6(c1–2), when DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorb on the ZnSe(111) surface, respectively, the EDPs of the HOMOs and LUMOs are not changed. Because charges transfer from the ZnSe(111) surface to the DBrTBT during adsorption, in the ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, the HOMO EDPs are concentrated on the benzothiadiazole, and LUMO EDPs are still concentrated on the Se4s and Se5s orbitals. In contrast, charges transfer from the DBrTBT-Si(1) to the ZnSe(111) surface when the DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, the HOMO EDPs are still concentrated on the Zn3d and Se4p orbitals, and the LUMO EDPs are concentrated on the benzothiadiazole and thiophene rings of the DBrTBT-Si(1). The specific data of partial atomic charge in several configurations are shown in Fig. S8, S11, and S12 (ESI†).
The variation is more impressive for the energy levels. Fig. 7 shows the associated energy levels of ZnSe(100), ZnSe(111), ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1), ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the HOMO energy level of DBrTBT is elevated about 0.09 eV compared to that of DBrTBT-Si(1), resulting from the electron delocalization in the benzothiadiazole and thiophene rings, and the energy gap (HOMO–LUMO) of DBrTBT is thus decreased as well. These results suggest that the structural modification on the benzene ring alters the orbital electron distribution severely, consequently leading to the variation of the energy levels. The HOMO energy level of the ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT is the highest among the heterostructure configurations owing to the strongest donor ZnSe(100), whereas the LUMO levels of the ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT and the ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1) are 0.10 eV, which were determined by acceptor units, DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1). The energy levels of the ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) are very different when DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) are adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, respectively, The LUMO energy level of ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) is −4.32 eV, showing a perceptible electron-withdrawing ability.13 Consequently, the calculated band gap of the configurations show the following trend: ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT (0.19 eV) < ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1) (0.25 eV) < ZnSe(100) (0.37 eV) < ZnSe(111) (0.53 eV) < ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT (0.76 eV) < ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) (1.31 eV) < DBrTBT-Si(1) (1.35 eV) < DBrTBT (1.57 eV). Thus, when DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, the Eg (1.31 eV) is close to the value of Si (Eg = 1.1 eV56).
 Fig. 7  Energy levels of the DBrTBT, DBrTBT-Si(1), ZnSe(100), ZnSe(111), ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1), and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1). 
As discussed above, the HOMO and LUMO EDPs changed during the DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorption on the ZnSe surface and electron transfer and charge redistribution occur between the organic molecules and the ZnSe surface during the adsorption. The HOMO and LUMO EDPs in ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT and ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1) showed more change. The results are consistent with the Mulliken charge analysis. Considering the molecular configuration, orbital EDPs, and band gap, when the DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the surface of ZnSe(111), the blend films formed are more promising precursors of solar cell materials.
3.4 Analysis of density of states

Fig. 8 shows partial density of states (PDOS) diagrams of the ZnSe(100), ZnSe(111), ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1), ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1), respectively. The dashed lines at 0 eV indicate the relative Fermi energy levels (FELs). For Fig. 8(a–c), near the FEL between −1.5 and +0.10 eV, the PDOS electrons on the ZnSe(100) surface series mainly consist of the Zn4s, Zn4p, and Se4p orbitals, and the Zn4s orbital is the greatest contributor in ZnSe(100) and ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, respectively. On the other hand, in ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1), owing to the silicon-doped benzene ring C atom, the DOS electron of Zn4p is enhanced, and the Zn4s orbital is the greatest contributor below the FEL, but the Zn4s and Zn4p orbitals contribute the same above the FEL. The valence band energy edge of the ZnSe(100) surface series are about 1.0 eV above the FEL. For Fig. 8(d–f), the valence band (VB) high-energy edge of the ZnSe(111), ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) are about 1.0 eV, 0.5 eV, and 0.5 eV above the FEL, respectively. The conduction band (CB) of the ZnSe(111) surface mainly consists of the Zn4s, Zn4p, Zn3d, Se4s, Se4p, and Se3d orbitals, and the Zn4s and O2p orbitals are the main contributors. However, the CBs of ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) increased the sum of the organic molecule, and the sum is the main contributor.
 Fig. 8  Partial density of states (PDOS) diagrams of (a) ZnSe(100), (b) ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT, (c) ZnSe(100)-DBrTBT-Si(1), (d) ZnSe(111), (e) ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, and (f) ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1). 
Comparing Fig. 8(e) and (f), we find that the Eg between VB and CB begins to disappear when the DBrTBT compound is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, and in contrast, the Eg between VB and CB becomes wider when the compound DBrTBT-Si(1) is adsorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface. We can also see that the peaks of the CBs of ZnSe(111), ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT, and ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) lie at 1.8, 2.0, and 2.4 eV, respectively. This means that the CBs move to the higher energies in Fig. 8(e) and (f). With Eg, DOS, and molecular configuration considered, ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) is a more promising solar cell material.
4. Conclusion
In summary, DBrTBT-Si(x) (x = 1, 2, and 6) based on DBrTBT are designed via silicon doping by using DFT at the GGA/PW91/DNP level. By comparison and selection of the stable configuration, stable energy, and frontier orbital differences, i.e. band gaps and Eg, the most suitable configuration for the OPV usage is determined to be DBrTBT-Si(1), where the C(1) atom on the benzene ring of DBrTBT is replaced by one Si atom. Moreover, DFT and the PPSM method are combined to investigate DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1) adsorbed on the ZnSe(100) and (111) surfaces in order to evaluate the PV properties of DBrTBT and DBrTBT-Si(1), respectively. The stable structures, Mulliken charges, frontier orbitals, and DOS of the configurations are discussed, and the corresponding results reveal that the band gap between VB and CB is wider when DBrTBT-Si(1) is absorbed on the ZnSe(111) surface, and the Eg (1.31 eV) of ZnSe(111)-DBrTBT-Si(1) is closer to that of the single-crystal Si. The results presented are a potential guide for the development of future PV materials. Specifically, the theoretical study of this problem is of vital significance for optimizing nanostructured devices, guiding relevant experiments, and providing reasonable explanations for experimental observations.
