    , Accepted 21st January 2021First published on 22nd January 2021AbstractA novel visible-light absorbing silver dimethyl amino phenyl substituted phthalocyanine photoinitiator (dmaph-Ag(II)Pc) for free-radical (FRP) and cationic (CP) polymerizations in laminate and under air is reported. The photoinduced electron transfer reactions of excited dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in the presence and absence of an iodonium salt (Iod) resulted in the formation of a Brønsted acid and radical species capable of initiating CP and FRP, respectively. The photophysical and photochemical properties of the photoinitiator are evaluated in detail by computational and spectroscopic investigations, and the kinetics of the polymerizations are studied. It was demonstrated that the described photoinitiating system is highly efficient in the simultaneous cationic or free-radical polymerization and silver ion reduction. The nanocomposites formed this way contain spherical shaped silver nanoparticles homogenously dispersed in the polymer matrix with a narrow size distribution between 5 and 20 nm.
Introduction
For decades, photochemistry has continued to evolve with the synthesis of new performing photosensitive systems that are becoming more and more efficient for initiating free-radical (FRP) and cationic (CP) polymerizations under light activation. Alongside the development of new emission sources, visible light-mediated photopolymerization has also received significant attention, overcoming the problems associated with the use of UV irradiation. Owing to these advances, a wide range of visible and/or infrared absorbing photoinitiators1–18 have been developed, providing new opportunities in the synthesis of complex materials.
Although visible light-mediated photopolymerizations are now well described, only a few examples of phthalocyanine (Pc) derivatives as photoinitiators for FRP or CP have been reported despite their very high absorption in the visible range. Pcs are valuable macrocyclic organic compounds with high chemical resistance and light stability and are widely used in the biomedical field as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment,19,20 as dyes and pigments for industrial applications,21 for molecular electronics or solar cells,22,23 and as fluorescent and electroactive molecules for sensor and electrocatalytic applications.24–30
In recent years, the fascinating Pc chemistry has led to a multitude of new chemical structures with different peripheral/non-peripheral substituents and different metal centered atoms. One of the noteworthy applications in the context of photoinitiation is the report of Boyer et al. who highlighted the role of a new AlPc as a photosensitizer of peroxides in the controlled living polymerization of methyl acrylate31 by far-red light activation. A conceptually similar approach32 was extended to the photoinduced electron transfer process between Mg-, Zn- and Al-based Pcs and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to initiate FRP of vinyl monomers in solution. Another approach33 concerns the attachment of ZnPc to a type 2 photoinitiator such as thioxanthone. Breloy et al. incorporated a thioxanthone structure to Zn-phthalocyanine. Long wavelength irradiation in the presence of a hydrogen donor such as methyl diethanol amine (MDEA) resulted in the successful FRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The Pc structure was also combined with anthraquinone photoactive groups.34 In combination with several co-initiators such as iodonium salts, thiols or amines, the FRP and CP of acrylate and epoxy monomers were successfully achieved under visible light exposure. Zn-phthalocyanine was also used as a photosensitizer and electron donor for phosphotungstic acid, applied to in situ FRP to form a biomedical hydrogel.35 A recently reported cationically polymerizable phthalocyanine-based monomer is likely to form a smooth hybrid polymer surface for potential solar cell applications.36
Polymer/silver nanocomposite materials37–39 have high scientific and technological importance, because of their excellent optical, conductivity and antimicrobial properties. The general methodology for the preparation of silver nanocomposites is the reductive processes in homogeneous or micellar solution or in the preformed polymer films, but it suffers from the tendency of the nanoparticles to agglomerate resulting from their high surface reactivity. Such behavior affecting the mechanical properties can be overcome by simultaneous photoinduced electron transfer and polymerization processes. The approach was successfully applied for the preparation of silver40–43 or gold44,45 nanocomposites.
In this paper, the synthesis of a new dimethyl amino phenyl substituted silver phthalocyanine (dmaph-Ag(II)Pc) and the evaluation of its photophysical properties using computational calculations, steady state photolysis and fluorescence technique are reported. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been used to support the proposed mechanism for the initiation of FRP and CP under visible light irradiation using a dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/iodonium salt photoinitiation system. Finally, TEM experiments have highlighted the main role played by dmaph-Ag(II)Pc to form Ag NPs and polymers simultaneously in solution or in bulk through concurrent electron transfer and polymerization processes without the addition of silver salts in contrast to previously described investigations.
Experimental
Materials
Cyclohexene oxide (CHO), (3,4-epoxycyclohexane)methyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX), bis(4-methylphenyl) iodonium hexafluorophosphate (Iod), 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.0)undec-7-ene (DBU), 4-(N,N-dimethylamino) phenylboronic acid pinacol ester, dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and the spin trapping agents, i.e., 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, distilled prior to the application), N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) and nitrosodurene (ND), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) was obtained from Cytec and used as received. Solvents (acetone, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), ethyl acetate and chloroform) were dried prior to use.
Synthesis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc complexes
The dimethyl amino phenyl substituted phthalonitrile compound (1) was synthesized and isolated according to the literature46 (Fig. S1–S4†). To perform the cyclotetramerization reaction, 110.0 mg (0.3 mmol) of 1 was dissolved in 1.5 mL of DMAE solvent under an argon atmosphere. When the temperature reached 100 °C, 50.0 μL of DBU was added into the reaction tube, and then the temperature was increased to 140 °C and the mixture was stirred slowly for 16 h. The crude octasubstituted dmaph-H2Pc was poured into 10.0 mL of methanol to precipitate the metal-free phthalocyanine. The collected compound was successively washed by centrifugation with several solvents: acetone, DMF and ethyl acetate (yield: 38.0%). Then, 42.0 mg of dmaph-H2Pc and 14.5 mg (0.09 mmol) of AgNO3 (3 eq.) were dissolved in 4.0 mL of DMF and the reaction proceeded under an argon atmosphere at 140 °C for 2 h. When the color of the reaction mixture turned from black to dark green, indicating the completion of the reaction, the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The obtained dmaph-Ag(II)Pc was washed twice with distilled water and methanol (yield: 90.0%). For dmaph-H2Pc: FTIR, cm−1 3290 (N–H stretching), 2917–2846 (C–H aliphatic), 1603 (N–H bending), 1528, 1438, 1352, 1198, 1100, 1012, 815. MS: (m/z) 1464 [M − 3H]+. The 1H-NMR spectra of dmaph-H2Pc and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc could not be obtained in common organic solvents because of their low solubility and high aggregation tendency. For making water-soluble in order to solve the structure of dmaph-H2Pc by NMR, it was, therefore, dissolved in a 5.0 mL solution of 1.0 M HCl and mixed at room temperature for 5 min. Then, water was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was washed with acetone and dichloromethane. This process yields water-soluble dmaph-H2Pc·nHCl which was characterized by 1H-NMR in D2O (deuterium oxide). 1H-NMR (500 MHz,) δ; 7.78 (s, 7H), 7.38 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 15H), 7.29 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 16H), 3.13 (s, 48H). For dmaph-Ag(II)Pc: FTIR, cm−1 2917–2846 (C–H aliphatic), 1645, 1441, 1352, 1343, 1100, 1182, 1018, 842. MS: (m/z) 1572 [M]+, 1467 [M–Ag + 2H]+, 1453 [M–Ag–CH3 + 3H]+. The MALDI-TOF, FTIR and 1H-NMR spectra of dmaph-H2Pc and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc are shown in Fig. S4–S8 in the ESI.†
Computational method
Standard B3LYP47 geometry optimization with Grimme's GD3 dispersion correction48 of neutral dmaph-H2Pc in singlet and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in doublet ground spin states in chloroform using the cc-pVDZ-PP pseudopotential and basis set for Ag49 and cc-pVDZ basis sets for the remaining atoms50 was performed. Solvent effects were approximated by the SMD modification51 of the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model. The stability of the optimized structures was confirmed by vibrational analysis (no imaginary vibrations). Excited state energies with the corresponding electron transitions were evaluated using the time-dependent DFT method52–54 for 70 and 99 states, respectively. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian1655 program package.
Spectroscopic investigations
UV-vis absorption spectra were measured in the 200–800 nm wavelength range using a PerkinElmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc was recorded in CHCl3 on a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set at 630 nm and the quenching of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc fluorescence was recorded upon progressive addition of Iod solution according to previously described procedures.34,56 NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent VNMRS 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C, and chemical shifts were referenced internally using the residual solvent resonances. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was performed on a BRUKER Microflex LT system. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer.
Photolysis experiments
Photolysis of the different photoinitiating systems was performed in CHCl3, under air upon LEDs@385 nm and 405 nm exposure.
Photopolymerization kinetic studies
For each sample, dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (0.25 wt% with respect to the monomer) was dissolved in a few drops of DMSO. Then, Iod (2.5 wt% with respect to the monomer) and 200 mg of monomer solution (EPOX 33 wt%/CHO 33 wt%/TMPTA 33 wt% or EPOX 50 wt%/CHO 50 wt%) were added. A comparative formulation consisting of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (0.25 wt%)/TMPTA in the absence of Iod was prepared in the same way. The dissolution in each case was ensured by stirring followed by ultrasonication. The formulations were then deposited on a BaF2 pellet and irradiated under air with different light sources. The thickness of the coatings was 12 μm for all the experiments. The decrease of the epoxy and acrylate groups was continuously followed by Real-Time Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (RT-FTIR, JASCO FTIR 4700) at 790 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1, respectively.
Light sources
Three light emitting diodes (LED@385 nm at 130 mW cm−2, LED@405 nm at 160 mW cm−2 and LED@660 nm at 6 mW cm−2) were used for the polymerizations.
EPR experiments
The EPR spectra in the X-band (modulation frequency of 100 kHz) were measured by means of an EMXplus spectrometer (Bruker) with a high sensitivity probe-head (Bruker) using thin-walled quartz EPR tubes (Bruker). The solutions prepared in benzene or chloroform carefully saturated with argon were irradiated at 293 K directly in the EPR resonator using a LED@385 nm source (λmax = 385 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology), and the EPR spectra were measured in situ during/after a defined irradiation time as described previously.57 The spin trapping agents, i.e., DMPO, PBN and ND, were used. The experimental EPR spectra were processed using WinEPR software (Bruker) and the simulated spectra were calculated using the EasySpin toolbox working on the MATLAB® platform.58 The detailed information of the EPR spectrometer settings is noted in the figure captions.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments
The microstructural observations of Ag NPs in solution and in a polymer matrix were investigated by bright-field conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) according to a previously described procedure.17 The TEM analysis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc-derived solutions ([dmaph-Ag(II)Pc] = 3.9 × 10−5 M and [Iod] = 8.4 × 10−5 M) was performed in CHCl3 after their irradiation under LED@385 nm (400 mW cm−2 for 10 min). The photoinduced polymer pellet was obtained by dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod/CHO/EPOX formulation under LED@405 nm (160 mW cm−2) in a round silicone mold of 1.3 cm diameter and 2 mm thickness for 800 s. The corresponding analysis of the polymer solid sample was performed in a similar way to previously described.17
Results and discussion
The overall synthetic procedure for dmaph-Ag(II)Pc is shown in Scheme 1. Accordingly, the precursor compound (1) was synthesized by reacting 4,5-diiodobenzene-1,2-dicarbonitrile and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenylboronic acid pinacol ester by the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, in accordance with the literature.46 The new compounds (dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and dmaph-H2Pc) were elucidated by miscellaneous spectral methods (MALDI-TOF, FT-IR and UV-vis). To obtain dmaph-Ag(II)Pc, first dmaph-H2Pc was prepared by cyclotetramerization of 1 in DMAE with a yield of 38%. The conversion can be followed by the disappearance of the characteristic CN vibration band at 2226 cm−1 (Fig. S5†). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of dmaph-H2Pc shows the mass (m/z) value as 1464, indicating [M − 3H]+ (Fig. S6†). Due to the limited solubility of dmaph-H2Pc in common deuterated organic solvents, dmaph-H2Pc was protonated with hydrochloric acid solution to facilitate its dissolution in water. In Fig. S7,† the 1H-NMR spectrum of dmaph-H2Pc·nHCl in D2O shows signals at 7.28–7.79 ppm and 3.13 ppm corresponding to the aromatic and methyl protons, respectively. dmaph-H2Pc was reacted with silver nitrate in DMF to give dmaph-Ag(II)Pc with 90% yield. In Fig. S8,† the MALDI-TOF spectrum of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc exhibits 1572 and 1467 peaks, indicating the M+ of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and its demetallated forms (dmaph-H2Pc).

Photophysical and photochemical properties of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc
The UV-vis absorption spectrum of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (compared to that of dmaph-H2Pc, Fig. S9†) shows two intense absorption bands; the first one is located in the UV region at ca. 300 nm (Soret band) and the other one in the visible region centered at ca. 700 nm which is referred to as the Q-band (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. S9,† the visible-region absorption is a typical Q-band absorption. According to TD-B3LYP calculations, the absorption at 723 nm is due to (α-HOMO) → (α-LUMO+1) and (β-HOMO) → (β-LUMO+1) excitation with an oscillator strength of 0.9 and the absorption at 724 nm is attributed to (α-HOMO) → (α-LUMO) and (β-HOMO) → (β-LUMO) transitions with an oscillator strength of 0.79. This splitting can be ascribed to a pseudo-Jahn–Teller effect.59–61 The electron density of both α-HOMO and β-HOMO is entirely localized on Pc rings and dimethyl amino phenyl groups with the π character. The (α-LUMO+1), (β-LUMO+1), (α-LUMO) and (β-LUMO) are a mixture of π* (Pz ring) and a small part of the d (Ag) orbital. Therefore, the Q-band absorption is ascribed to π–π* transitions which are common for all metal Pcs having D4h symmetry. This was also observed for dmaph-H2Pc in which the Q-band splits into two peaks because of the D2h symmetry of dmaph-H2Pc (see Fig. S10†).
The Soret band absorption can be assigned to the TD-B3LYP electronic transitions (α-HOMO−13) → (α-LUMO), (β-HOMO−12) → (β-LUMO), (α-HOMO−17) → (α-LUMO) and (β-HOMO−16) → (β-LUMO) at 359 nm with an oscillator strength of 0.76. As clearly seen in Fig. 1, the α-HOMO−13 (and α-HOMO−17, not shown) of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc are orbitals mixed with p(N) and π* (Pz moiety) orbitals in character so that the HOMO → LUMO transitions of this complex are mainly attributed to π–π* transitions which are also common for all metal Pcs having D4h symmetry.

Steady-state photolysis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc
The overall photochemical reactivity of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in the presence and absence of Iod is investigated by steady-state photolysis. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the dmaph-Ag(II)Pc absorbance decreases under LED@385 nm exposure. A sharp decrease in the absorbance corresponding to the Q- and Soret band absorption transitions observed at 359 and 723 nm along with the appearance of the split Q-band (Fig. 2A) indicates the removal of Ag ions from dmaph-Ag(II)Pc. The observed global decrease of absorbance may also be due to the photobleaching of the Pc ring. This could be attributed to the interaction between the Pc ring and singlet oxygen, which leads to the degradation of Pc into its lower mass phthalimide fragments.62 A similar behavior was observed when steady-state photolysis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod was carried out under LED@405 nm irradiation, but with a slower decrease (Fig. S11†). Interestingly, a rapid increase of a large band with a maximum at 450 nm can be assigned to the well-known silver surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs. The NP formation can be explained by the reduction of Ag ions by the Pc containing amino group under light activation with or without Iod (see the EPR results). Morphological analyses were carried out in order to confirm the presence of Ag NPs in the metallic form (Fig. S12 and S13†). TEM experiments demonstrate the presence of well-dispersed and spherical Ag NPs in solution with an average diameter of 9 nm. Fig. 2B and D show the formation of Brønsted acids after the photolysis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod systems with a previously described procedure involving the rhodamine (RhB) test. Indeed, the photogenerated H+ are captured by RhB, thus resulting in the increase of the absorbance of the acid form of RhB at 550 nm. Interestingly, dmaph-Ag(II)Pc is able to generate photoacids. Notably, the addition of Iod has an incremental effect on the production.

Note that the plasmon resonance band of AgNPs does not appear after 1 min of irradiation in the presence of an excess of RhB (Fig. 2B and D). This could be an effect of the RhB base, in which the carboxylate group could slow down NP formation. Indeed, citrate ions are frequently used in the synthesis of AgNPs for improving the size control of the NPs, by interacting with the silver surface and slowing down the crystal growth.63 In the presence of a smaller concentration of RhB, the fast AgNP formation can be observed as soon as the acidification of RhB is complete (Fig. S14†).
Fluorescence quenching
A gradual increase of the Iod concentration in a chloroform solution of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (Fig. 3) leads to high fluorescence quenching and the corresponding fluorescence quenching constant KSV(dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod) was evaluated at 7.5 M−1. This suggests a probable electron transfer reaction from the dmaph-Ag(II)Pc excited singlet state to Iod. The negative ΔGS1 value for 1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod (−0.34 eV), calculated from the Rehm–Weller equation, the oxidation potential of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (Eox, dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (vs. SCE) = 1.16 V, Fig. S15†), the reduction potential of Iod (ERed, Iod (vs. SCE) = −0.2 V) and the energy of the singlet excited state (ES, dmaph-Ag(II)Pc = 1.7 eV) are consistent with a possible electron transfer reaction from 1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc to Iod. The electron transfer quantum yield, ϕeT, from 1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc to Iod (according to ϕeT (1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod) = KSV [Iod]/(1 + KSV [Iod]) with [Iod] = 58.6 × 10−3 M) is estimated to be 0.3. The high value for ϕeT with 1dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod indicates the formation of a relatively high quantity of the initiating species.

EPR experiments
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first example of EPR spin-trapping experiments on a phthalocyanine derivative under light irradiation. The EPR spectra of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (the central atom Ag2+ with a d9 configuration) in chloroform or benzene measured at room temperature are characterized by a broad signal with poorly resolved hyperfine couplings due to the interaction of the Ag nuclei (107Ag, 109Ag, I = ½) with four equivalent nitrogens (14N, I = 1). The spin-Hamiltonian parameters elucidated from the simulation (aAg = 4.74 mT, aN(4N) = 2.75 mT; g = 2.040) correlate well with those previously reported for Ag2+ porphyrins64 or Ag2+ tetra-azamacrocycles.65 Upon in situ photoexcitation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in CHCl3 using LED@385 nm, a very low signal at g = 2.0021 was detected; the intensity of this signal was enhanced when dmaph-Ag(II)Pc was irradiated in the presence of Iod (Fig. 4); consequently, it was assigned to the corresponding π-radical cation. This species is characterized by low stability and most probably is transformed into the nitrogen-centered radical species (A in Scheme 2) detected as the corresponding PBN or DMPO adducts. Fig. 5A shows the experimental EPR spectra measured upon LED@385 nm irradiation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in benzene under argon in the presence of PBN along with their simulations. The 450 s in situ UVA photoactivation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc led to the generation of a six-line signal (aN = 1.449 mT, aβH = 0.224 mT; g = 2.0061) attributed to the PBN-adduct of an aromatic carbon-centered radical,66 whose structure is comparable with a phenyl-derived radical (D, Scheme 2), and is superimposed with two low-intensity signals representing most probably the PBN-adducts of carbon- (aN = 1.446 mT, aβH = 0.366 mT; g = 2.0062, D in Scheme 2) and nitrogen-centered radicals (aN = 1.514 mT, aβH = 0.432 mT, aβN = 0.313 mT; g = 2.0062, A in Scheme 2). Analogous spin trapping experiments were performed using a DMPO spin trap; the experimental and simulated EPR spectra obtained upon in situ LED@385 nm irradiation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc in deoxygenated benzene solutions are illustrated in Fig. 6A. The photoexcitation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/DMPO/benzene resulted in the formation of two superimposed low-intensity signals (Fig. 6A). The spin-Hamiltonian parameters extracted from the simulations correspond to the DMPO-adducts of the carbon-centered radical (aN = 1.409 mT, aβH = 2.003 mT; g = 2.0060) and most probably the carbon-centered radical in the vicinity of nitrogen (aN = 1.408 mT, aβH = 2.068 mT, aγH = 0.0728 mT, aγH = 0.0561 mT; g = 2.0060, B in Scheme 2).

When Iod is introduced in a chloroform solution of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc, LED@385 nm irradiation under argon led to the generation of a single-line EPR signal (g = 2.0021; ΔBpp = 0.44 mT; * in Fig. 4); no hyperfine couplings were detectable under the given experimental conditions. The analogous signal was detected also in the Iod-free photoinitiating system, but its intensity was very low. Considering the electron transfer between the photoexcited states of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and Iod and the g-factor (g = 2.0021) of the photogenerated radical, it may be assigned to a π-radical cation centered on dmaph-Ag(II)Pc.67 The proposed reaction pathway and the generation of (4-methyl)phenyl radicals upon LED@385 nm irradiation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod/benzene/argon were confirmed using the EPR spin trapping technique using DMPO, PBN and ND spin traps as is shown below (Fig. 5B, 6B and 7).

The photoexcitation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod/benzene/PBN (Fig. 5B) resulted in the immediate generation of a ˙PBN-(4-methyl)phenyl spin-adduct (C in Scheme 2) with well-resolved 13C satellites,68 evidencing the efficient electron transfer between photoexcited dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and Iod, coupled with the generation of a (4-methyl)phenyl radical.17,34 Also, here the signal of ˙PBN-(4-methyl) phenyl is superimposed with the six-line signal of the carbon-centered radical PBN-adduct (aN = 1.446 mT, aβH = 0.365 mT; g = 2.0062, D in Scheme 2), which is detectable due to the applied EPR spectrometer settings (microwave power, 1.3 mW, modulation amplitude, 0.025 mT); most likely it represents a PBN-derived radical adduct. The spin-Hamiltonian parameters of (4-methyl)phenyl spin-adducts elucidated from the simulations of the experimental EPR spectra measured upon irradiation of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod in deoxygenated benzene solutions containing PBN, DMPO and ND spin trapping agents are presented in Table 1. Interestingly, the irradiation of a benzene solution of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod in the presence of DMPO led to the generation of EPR spectra as shown in Fig. 6B. The signals were simulated involving the six-line signal characteristic for the ˙DMPO-(4-methyl)phenyl spin-adduct (Table 1), along with a carbon-centered radical adduct (aN = 1.398 mT, aβH = 2.092; g = 2.0061, D in Scheme 2). In order to obtain more convincing evidence for the generation of a (4-methyl)phenyl radical, EPR experiments under similar experimental conditions using a ND spin trap were also performed (Fig. 7). Notably, the generation of a complex signal clearly evidences the trapping of a (4-methyl)phenyl radical ultimately yielding the stable ˙ND-(4-methyl)phenyl spin-adduct (Fig. 7, Table 1). The most probable radical structures trapped by PBN, DMPO or ND are presented in Scheme 2.

Kinetic studies
The reactivity of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc photoinitiating systems for CP and FRP is investigated by RT-FTIR and compared with dmaph-H2Pc-derived systems. According to Fig. S16,† the FRP of TMPTA can be performed (20% of acrylate conversion, Table 2) with dmaph-Ag(II)Pc alone, thus confirming the EPR results and the formation of radical species after the photolysis of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc. However, the acrylate conversion is limited because of the low reactivity of the hindered aromatic carbon-centered radicals towards acrylates: indeed, the steric hindrance and electronic effects of molecules possessing a benzyl radical structure are well known to lead to low reactivity toward acrylates.69 Surprisingly, the amino alkyl radicals, which are useful candidates for FRP, did not counterbalance this time the limiting initiating properties of aromatic-centered radicals. Indeed, the three-electron interaction between the carbon-centered unpaired orbital and the nitrogen lone pair in this type of aromatic derived aminoalkyl radical is low due to the presence of aromatic groups on the nitrogen atom, greatly reducing the nucleophilic character of the carbon-centered radicals and decreasing the reactivity of the corresponding aminoalkyl radicals;70dmaph-Ag(II)Pc is also tested for its photoacid generation capability under irradiation. Under air, 25% or 22% ring-opening reaction of the EPOX/CHO system was attained at 385 nm and 405 nm, respectively (Table 2, Fig. S17†). Interestingly, the ring-opening of the CHO epoxy group was performed in an NMR tube and under our conditions, the yield reaches 11%. Expectedly, the addition of Iod to dmaph-Ag(II)Pc results in higher epoxy and acrylate conversions (Table 2, Fig. S18†). Regarding the cationic polymerization of CHO/EPOX, epoxy final conversions increase by a factor of 2 in the presence of Iod (Fig. S18†). The observed higher efficiency can be attributed to the possibility of the electron transfer reactions of the photoexcited Pc moiety with both Ag and iodonium ions (vide infra). This is consistent with the higher production of H+ in the dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod system compared to dmaph-Ag(II)Pc alone, as demonstrated by the RhB test in the photolysis experiments (Fig. 2B and D). This also confirms the capability of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod to generate both cationic (Brønsted acids) and radical species as demonstrated by steady-state photolysis and EPR results. Note that the cationic photopolymerization can be conducted by using dmaph-H2Pc coupled with Iod and dmaph-H2Pc alone (Fig. S19†). The results are similar to those of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc. The presence of Ag is therefore not crucial for the photopolymerization process. These results thus highlight the role of the Pc ring in the polymerization.

Concerning FRP, and despite the increase of acrylate final conversions with the addition of Iod, we could have expected higher acrylate conversion due to the formation of a highly reactive MePh radical, but this is not the case. This interesting result points out that a H-abstraction side reaction between the MePh radical and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc may likely occur to form low reacting aromatic derived aminoalkyl radicals (as described above) and MePh-H (see Scheme 4). As expected, FRP does not work well under air as oxygen strongly inhibits radical species.1 All polymerization experiments described above were also carried out under LED@660 nm (6 mW cm−2); unfortunately no polymerization occurred. This could be explained by the lower intensity of LED@660 nm, and it could be hypothesized that the reachable excitation state under red light is not sufficiently high in energy to lead to the formation of initiating radicals. Finally, it is interesting to note that no competitive effect between the formation of AgNPs (by silver ion reduction) and the polymerization process is observed, as the initiating properties of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc-derived systems are similar to those of metal-free dmaph-H2Pc in CP (Fig. S18 and S19†) or FRP (Fig. S16 and Fig. S20†).
 Scheme 3  Photoinitiation mechanism of FRP and ring-opening of epoxides using dmaph-Ag(II)Pc under light irradiation. 
 Scheme 4  Photoreactivity of the dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod system. 
Consequently, an in situ formation of the blend epoxy/acrylate polymer network was successfully achieved through a concomitant CP and FRP of the CHO/EPOX/TMPTA (33.3%/33.3%/33.3% w/w/w) system under LED irradiation in laminate and under air (Fig. S21 and S22†). In this case, epoxy conversions of EPOX and CHO in the EPOX/CHO/TMPTA system are higher than those observed without TMPTA under air (Table 2). This incremental effect is attributed to the MePh radicals that are involved in a hydrogen abstraction reaction with EPOX and CHO to form additional free-radical species which are subsequently oxidized by Iod,10,34 thus promoting CP to the detriment of FRP. Epoxy conversions are however not influenced by the atmosphere conditions in contrast to acrylate conversions. Indeed, oxygen is a well-known scavenger of radical species,1 reducing the FRP efficiency.
Generation of polymer nanocomposites
The interesting feature of the described photoinitiating system (also supported by EPR results) is the electron transfer reaction between the electron donor moiety of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and the centered-Ag ion. The latter is concomitantly reduced to generate homogenously dispersed Ag NPs (with a 9 nm diameter range) in the polymer matrix which prevents agglomeration (Fig. 8). In the system, the photoexcited Pc moiety reacts with both Ag and iodonium ions without the requirement of an additional silver salt and a photoinitiator which provides significant advantage compared to the multicomponent systems reported.

(C) Optical image of the photosynthesized dmaph-Ag(II)Pc/Iod/EPOX/CHO polymer material. Irradiation time = 800 s. Light intensity = 160 mW cm−2. 
Mechanism
In light of the spectroscopic and polymerization studies, the most plausible mechanisms shown in Schemes 3 and 4 are outlined as follows:
Upon irradiation, the electron transfer reaction between the photoexcited states of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc (Scheme 3, step 1) leads to the reduction of Ag(II) to Ag(I) and generates simultaneously the nitrogen-centered radical cation (dmaph-Ag(II)Pc˙+, Scheme 3, step 2). The structure of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc˙+ is shown in Fig. S23.† In step 3, Ag NPs (as demonstrated in the TEM experiments in Fig. S13†) and aromatic carbon-centered radicals (according to an electron transfer process described by EPR results) are formed. Subsequently, a hydrogen transfer reaction occurs between dmaph-Ag(II)Pc˙+ and dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and leads to dmaph-Ag(II)Pc˙ (aromatic-derived aminoalkyl radicals) and H+ (Scheme 3, step 4); such a reaction was previously described by Versace et al.56 The Brønsted acids generated this way initiate the ring-opening reaction (Scheme 3, step 5). Finally, the aromatic carbon-centered radicals and aromatic-derived aminoalkyl radicals can initiate the FRP of acrylates (Scheme 3, step 6). However, the reactivity of the generated radicals toward the acrylate monomer is low due to the steric hindrance, the electronic effects of the aromatic structures, thus limiting the acrylate conversions of TMPTA.
When Iod is added to dmaph-Ag(II)Pc, the previously described reactions occur (Scheme 3) but an additional electron transfer reaction can be considered between dmaph-Ag(II)Pc and Iod (Scheme 4). Upon irradiation, the excited dmaph-Ag(II)Pc forms an exciplex with Iod which undergoes electron transfer forming a diaryliodo radical and the radical cation dmaph-Ag(II)Pc˙+ (Scheme 4, step 1). Similar electron transfer reactions already described in Scheme 3 within the excited dmaph-Ag(II)Pc result in the formation of Ag NPs, aromatic carbon-centered radicals, aromatic derived aminoalkyl radicals and photoacids which promote CP or ring-opening of the appropriate monomers such as epoxides. Similar initiation mechanisms were proposed for conjugated aromatic compounds.71 The intermediate diaryliodo radical thus produced is relatively unstable and prone to decompose into the aryliodo compound and (4-methyl)phenyl radical (Scheme 4, step 2). The simultaneously formed phenyl radicals could be involved in a side H-abstraction reaction with the dimethyl amino group of dmaph-Ag(II)Pc to yield an aromatic derived aminoalkyl radical (Scheme 4, step 3). All the generated radicals (aromatic carbon-centered radicals and aromatic derived aminoalkyl radicals) are prompt to initiate the FRP of acrylates.
Conclusions
A new visible photosensitive system based on a Ag-derived Pc in combination with an iodonium salt was reported. EPR and steady-state photolysis experiments have clearly highlighted the formation of a radical and cationic photoinitiating species under UV and visible-light activation. This described system when used alone or in combination with an iodonium salt has demonstrated a dual role as (i) a photoinitiator or a photosensitizer of the iodonium salt for the FRP of TMPTA and the cationic ring opening polymerization of epoxides and (ii) an efficient promoter for the formation of Ag NPs under visible-light irradiation. The latter is particularly important for the in situ preparation of nanocomposites without using additional metal salts. This is the first example of one- or two-component Pc photosystems showing such properties.
