    , Accepted 20th June 2012First published on 22nd June 2012AbstractWe developed a facile one-step route to three-dimensional hybrids with Mn3O4 nanoparticles well and homogeneously embedded within ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) for lithium ion battery applications. The Mn3O4/OMC hybrids with good rate capability and cycling stability display a high specific capacity up to 802 mA h g−1, and a high coulombic efficiency of up to 99.2% even after 50 cycles at a high current density of 100 mA g−1. This value is 1.6 times higher than the discharge capacity of 512 mA h g−1 for pure ordered OMC materials, and more than 5.4 times higher than the discharge value of 148 mA h g−1 for pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The enhanced capacity and cycling performance of the Mn3O4/OMC hybrids could be attributed to their unique robust three-dimensional composite structure and the synergistic effects between the Mn3O4 nanoparticles and OMC. The ordered mesostructured channels of Mn3O4/OMC hybrids are expected to buffer well against the local volume change during the Li uptake/removal reactions and thus to enhance the structural stability. The OMC matrix wall with a thickness of <10 nm greatly reduces the solid-state transport length for Li diffusion, and the hierarchical ordered mesoporosity facilitates the liquid electrolyte diffusion into the bulk of the electrode material and hence provides fast conductive ion transport channels for the conductive Li+ ions. The improved cycling performance can also be mainly attributed to good electrical contact between the Mn3O4 and OMC in the three-dimensional nanocomposites during phase transformation of Mn3O4 upon lithiation/delithiation that usually leads to capacity fading. This facile strategy can be extended to fabricate other ordered mesoporous carbon-encapsulated metal oxides.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical energy storage has been receiving great attention for potential applications in electric vehicles and renewable energy systems from intermittent wind and solar sources. Currently, the lithium ion battery (LIB) is prevailing in many portable electronic devices such as cell phones, digital cameras/videos, and laptop computers due to its longer cycling life and higher energy density than other rechargeable batteries.1 In terms of active electrode materials, the possible use of transition metal oxides as anode materials for lithium batteries has drawn extensive research attention since they can provide not only double-layer capacitances but also pseudocapacitances resulting from Faradaic redox reactions.2,3 Among the transition metal oxides, manganese oxide has been used in primary lithium batteries and alkaline batteries for decades, and is a well accepted electrode material for clean energy storage because of its low cost, low toxicity, and chemical stability.4,5
However, the application of manganese oxide in secondary lithium ion batteries has been hindered by some practical problems, such as its relatively low intercalation capacity and poor cycle stability; bulk manganese dioxide film can only deliver a capacity of less than 120 mA h g−1 and the host structure is easily distorted by lithium-ion insertion/extraction reactions, and thus it suffers from poor stability over long-term cycling.6,7 In addition, the charge–discharge reversibility of manganese oxide nanoparticles is generally low because of the large volume changes that lead to pulverization of the active material upon successive cycling.8 Furthermore, the low conductivity and poor stability of manganese oxide materials usually necessitate adding conductive phases to enhance electron transport and electrical contact of the active materials in the electrode of Li-ion batteries. In most of these studies, the approach used to prepare the composite materials has been mechanical mixing of metal oxides with conductive materials such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.9,10 In spite of these studies, a well-controlled architecture of the conductive material and metal oxide is difficult to achieve.
Carbonaceous material11,12 is a major material for anodes in rechargeable lithium batteries because it exhibits both a higher specific capacity and a more negative redox potential than most metal oxides,13–15 chalcogenides,16,17 and polymers.18–20 Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC), since their first discovery in 1999,21 have found various applications in areas such as adsorption,22 catalysis,23 energy storage,24 and biosensors25 due to their high specific surface area, pore volume, controlled pore structure, and high electrical conductivity. OMC materials have been recognized as good anode candidates, because of their beneficial characteristics: (i) the short diffusion path of lithium ions within the nanosized pore walls, (ii) easy electrolyte penetration through the mesopores, and (iii) highly available charge storage sites due to the high surface area.26,27 Addition of porosity in OMC materials to enable expansion does provide some improvement in the cycling stability for Li battery applications.28 Recently, there have been increased research activities on lithium storage properties of OMC materials.29–31 Typically, mesoporous nanocomposites of OMC with metal oxides such as CoO, SnO2, NiO and TiO2 have exhibited improved anode performances.32
Compared with other types of manganese oxides, there are few reports on the study of Mn3O4 as anode materials for lithium ion battery applications,33 maybe because of its extremely low electrical conductivity (∼10−7 to 10−8 S cm−1). It is reported that34 the incorporation of Co into Mn3O4 could lead to a dramatic increase in electrochemical performance to a capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at a current density of 33–50 mA g−1. Lu et al.35 obtained a Mn3O4/carbon aerogel composite as an outstanding supercapacitor electrode material, which displays outstanding capacitive characteristics in all of the important aspects of supercapacitors, including high specific capacitance, excellent cycling stability, ideal cycle efficiency, well-retained CV-loop rectangularity at high scan rates, and exceptional energy and power densities. Recently, Dai et al.36 reported a Mn3O4–graphene composite as an anode material for lithium ion batteries with a greatly improved capacity, while the synthetic process is complex and the graphene is costly. To the best of our knowledge, there is almost no report on Mn3O4/OMC composites and their applications for lithium ion batteries.
Herein, we first report the self-assembled three-dimensional composite of Mn3O4/OMC for high performance lithium-ion battery anode materials. The incorporation of nanocrystalline Mn3O4 nanoparticles into a three dimensional ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) matrix can provide the advantages of both materials, and at the same time, avoid the disadvantages. The Mn3O4/OMC hybrid materials display a high specific capacity up to 802 mA h g−1 even after 50 cycles, with good rate capability and cycling stability. The improved cycling performance can be attributed to good electrical contact between Mn3O4 nanoparticles and the OMC matrix during phase transformation of Mn3O4 upon lithiation/delithiation that usually leads to capacity fading. The homogeneously distributed Mn3O4 nanoparticles of about 10–15 nm within the three-dimensional OMC matrix allow for the electrically insulating Mn3O4 nanoparticles to be wired up to a current collector through the underlying conducting OMC network. OMC stacks can improve the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites by increasing the conductivity of the electrode materials and by stabilizing the electrode structure with a good electric contact between Mn3O4 and conductive OMC during the charge–discharge process.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)37 was synthesized using SBA-15 (ref. 9) as a template and sucrose as a carbon source. To modify the OMC, KMnO4 was used as a Mn source. Mn3O4/OMC was synthesized using KMnO4 as the Mn source by a one-step process. The detailed synthesis route is as follows: 1.0 g of SBA-15 was immersed in a solution containing 0.32 g of KMnO4, 0.3 g of C2H4O2, 1.25 g of sucrose, 0.4 g of H2SO4 and 5.0 g of H2O. After keeping the mixture at 373 K and 433 K for 6 h separately, the silica sample, containing partially polymerized and carbonized sucrose, was treated again at 373 K and 433 K after the addition of 0.16 g of KMnO4, 0.15 g of C2H4O2, 0.8 g of sucrose, 0.2 g of H2SO4 and 5.0 g of H2O. The composite was carbonized at 1173 K in a nitrogen flow with a heating rate of 3.0 °C min−1 and kept under these conditions for 6 h to complete the carbonization. The silica template was dissolved with 5 wt% hydrofluoric acid at room temperature. The template-free product was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried.
2.2. Material characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were determined by a Rigaku D/Max-rB diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and components of the synthesized products were analyzed using SU-70 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and attached X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), respectively. The morphology and structure of the synthesized products were analyzed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) of Tecnai 20U-Twin at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined at 77 K using an adsorption porosimeter Micromeritics ASAP2020. The surface area measurements were performed according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution was obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Kelvin equation by means of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under a flow of air with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1 from 40 °C to 800 °C on a TG-209C instrument.
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical tests were performed using two-electrode cells assembled in an argon filled glove box. The galvanostatic charging–discharging tests were conducted using standard 2032 type coin cells with copper foil as the current collector, lithium foil as reference electrode and 1.0 M LiPF6 in mixed ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (EC:DEC, 1:1 by volume) as the electrolyte. A cut-off voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V was used. The working electrode is composed of Mn3O4/OMC composites and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 85:15. The mass of active materials is around 1–2 mg, depending on the thickness of the film formed on the Cu current collector. The 2032 coin-type cells were galvanostatically cycled on a LAND CT2001A instrument (Wuhan, China) at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study was conducted using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 2273) between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD and N2 sorption analysis of the samples
The structure of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples was investigated by powder XRD measurements. Fig. 1a shows the small-angle XRD patterns of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples. The XRD patterns of both the samples in Fig. 1a exhibit a high-intensity diffraction peak of (100) and two additional well-resolved diffraction peaks of (110) and (200), which can be assigned to a hexagonal lattice (space group P6mm), similar to that of the SBA-15 silica host. It can be seen that the structural order of Mn3O4/OMC, synthesized via a one-step process, does not show much of a decrease compared with the OMC sample. The minimal decrease in structural order may be due to a slight pore blockage caused by some small Mn3O4 particles incorporated within the OMC matrix. The unit cell constants calculated from XRD patterns of the samples are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 1b shows the wide-angle XRD patterns of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples. Both the two XRD patterns show the broad diffraction peaks of the graphite structure at 26°. It can be seen that in the pattern of Mn3O4/OMC, the hausmannite structure of Mn3O4 is clearly shown, which means that Mn3O4 particles were incorporated within the OMC matrix. The corresponding lattice planes are labelled on the pattern of Mn3O4/OMC.

Fig. 2 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions (inset) of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples. The isotherms of both samples exhibit type IV characteristics (according to the IUPAC classification) with a pronounced narrow capillary condensation step, and a uniform mesopore size distribution. The textural parameters such as specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples are summarized in Table 1. The pure OMC sample shows the higher specific surface area of 1152 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 1.25 cm3 g−1. After being decorated with Mn3O4 particles, the surface area and pore volume of the Mn3O4/OMC sample decrease to 708 m2 g−1 and 1.09 cm3 g−1, respectively. There are two reasons for this phenomenon, one is due to the decrease of the structural order of the OMC matrix of Mn3O4/OMC, and the other is due to the blockage of Mn3O4 particles in the pore channels. Both reasons result in the decrease in surface area and pore volume of the Mn3O4/OMC composite samples.

From the pore size distribution of the samples, the pore diameter of the OMC is 4.2 nm, while the pore size is enlarged to 5.3 nm for the Mn3O4/OMC sample (as shown in the inset of Fig. 2). It is inferred that the Mn3O4 particle incorporation within the OMC samples expands the channel width of the OMC matrix in the process of synthesis.
3.2. FE-SEM, HR-TEM and EDS analysis of the samples
The surface morphology and structure arrangements of the obtained OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples are observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples. The OMC sample shows rod like morphology (Fig. 3a) and is about 1.0 μm long, which is similar to the original silica template, and the sample exhibits bundles of well-ordered isotropic channels seen in Fig. 3b, showing that after the template replication process, the products retained the original morphology and structure of the ordered silica template well. From the FE-SEM images of Mn3O4/OMC samples in Fig. 3c and d, it is clearly shown that the Mn3O4 particles are well distributed on the surface of the supported OMC matrix with an average particle size of 10–15 nm. It is suggested by the FE-SEM images that the Mn3O4 particles homogeneously decorate the OMC carbon matrix. Further detailed structural information about the ordered mesoporous structure of OMC and the distribution of Mn3O4 nanoparticles within the three dimensional OMC matrix can be analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization.

The more detailed structural arrangement of the OMC and Mn3O4/OMC samples is characterized by HR-TEM. Fig. 4 shows the planar (Fig. 4a and c) and cross-sectional (Fig. 4b and d) HR-TEM images of the samples. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that the OMC sample consists of well-ordered arrays of mesopores, which are interconnected with some randomly distributed nanorods, and the cross-sectional HR-TEM image (Fig. 4b) clearly displays a hexagonal (honeycomb-like) arrangement of the mesopores with a pore diameter of about 4 nm, indicating that the hexagonal meso-structure is preserved after the carbonization process and hydrofluoric acid (HF) dissolution. From the images of the Mn3O4/OMC sample, we can see that the mesoporous structural order remains almost the same as that of the pure OMC sample, only with some Mn3O4 particles homogeneously incorporated into the pore channels of the OMC carbon matrix. The pore diameter of the Mn3O4/OMC sample is about 5 nm, and the Mn3O4 particle size is 10–15 nm, consistent with the FE-SEM images and N2 sorption results. The chemical composition of the Mn3O4/OMC sample is characterized by X-ray dispersive spectrometry (EDS), as shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the Mn3O4/OMC sample is mainly composed of carbon, manganese and oxygen elements. The presence of oxygen mainly comes from Mn3O4, and a little from atmospheric O2, or CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the sample. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†) indicates that the weight content of Mn3O4 incorporated in the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid is about 20.3 wt%.

3.3. Electrochemical performance of Mn3O4/OMC
The Mn3O4 nanoparticles well-embedded within the three-dimensional OMC material make it promising for application in energy storage. The electrochemical performance of the Mn3O4/OMC nanocomposite as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the voltage profiles of the 1st, 2nd, 50th cycles for the Mn3O4/OMC electrode cycled between 0.01 and 3 V at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The first discharge and charge capacities are 1843 and 773 mA h g−1, respectively. The second discharge and charge capacities are 893 and 795 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 89%. The loss in capacity could be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the irreversible reaction of the samples. After cycling to the 50th cycle, the discharge and charge capacities are 802 and 795 mA h g−1, respectively, and the coulombic efficiency is up to 99.2%. It is noted that in the first discharge curve, at ∼0.8 V and ∼0.3 V there appeared two voltage plateaus, although not very apparent, indicating the formation of the SEI and the reduction of lithium to carbon and Mn3O4. This is very similar to the result that no characteristic plateau was observed in the charge–discharge profiles associated with a composite of TiO2/multiwalled carbon nanotubes.38 Furthermore, the disappearance of the characteristic plateau for Li+ storage in TiO2 has been observed in other reports when OMC composites with CoO and NiO were used as anodes.39 Of course, this interesting profile behavior may be related to the amorphous structure of OMC and the formation of the Mn3O4/OMC nanocomposite and needs to be studied further. The oxidation peak above ∼1.0 V demonstrates an electrochemical oxidation reaction. The second and 50th discharge and charge cycles overlap well, indicating good electrochemical reversibility and structure stability.

Fig. 7 shows the cyclic performance of the Mn3O4/OMC electrode cycled between 0.01 and 3 V at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 50 cycles. It is found that the Mn3O4/OMC electrode exhibits a relatively stable cycling performance. In the first 10 cycles, the discharge and charge capacity of the Mn3O4/OMC electrode are almost stable, only showing a tendency to drop slightly. However, from the 15th to the 33rd cycles, the capacity gradually increased. This may be due to the decomposition of Mn3O4 nanoparticles during cycling. At 34 cycles, the discharge and charge capacity of the Mn3O4/OMC electrode increased to 792 and 773 mA h g−1. At 38 cycles, the discharge and charge capacity of the Mn3O4/OMC electrode decreased slowly to 700 and 682 mA h g−1. After 38 cycles, both the discharge and charge capacity of the Mn3O4/OMC electrode increased with increasing cycle number. At 50 cycles, the discharge capacity remained at about 802 mA h g−1, showing good reversibility, with a higher coulombic efficiency of 99.2%. In contrast to the reported result that the capacity of other hybrids decreases with increasing cycle time, it is very interesting to note that the electrode of the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid maintains high cyclability, and its reversible capacity even gradually increased. Other researchers have also previously observed similar results in other hybrids of MoO2/graphene40 and ordered mesoporous metallic MoO2 materials.41 The capacity firstly decreased in the first 10 cycles, and then increased in the following charge and discharge curves. This interesting phenomenon may be due to the addition of Mn3O4. In the initial cycles, because of the poor electrical conductivity of Mn3O4, the capacity decreased. More importantly, the Mn3O4 nanoparticles blocked the movement of electrolyte in the mesoporous OMC, so the capacity reduced gradually. With increasing cycle number, the Mn3O4 nanoparticles can be etched by the electrolyte, and their size diminished, which is helpful for the contact of electrodes and lithium ions in the electrolyte, so the capacity of Mn3O4/OMC increases somewhat. Fig. 8 depicts the coulomb efficiencies of the OMC/Mn3O4 hybrids and OMC samples. It is clearly shown that the coulomb efficiency of the OMC/Mn3O4 hybrids is higher than 99.2% even after 50 cycles. It should be noted that the coulomb efficiency of the OMC/Mn3O4 hybrids has been greatly improved compared with that of the OMC samples.

Note that direct comparison with other results in the literature is difficult, because the electrode loading and its fabrication condition differs from those in previous studies. Only the comparison of lithium storage performance between the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid, pure OMC, and pure Mn3O4 samples (see Fig. 9 for SEM image and XRD pattern of the pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles) in the present work is therefore meaningful. For comparison, the charge and discharge capacities of the pure mesoporous OMC electrode as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries were investigated. The first discharge and charge capacities are 1443 and 562 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 38.9%. When cycled 50 times, the discharge and charge capacities are 512 and 501 mA h g−1, and the coulombic efficiency is 97.9%. The hybrid of Mn3O4 nanoparticles formed within the ordered mesoporous three-dimensional OMC materials showed a good rate performance as well. The discharge value of 802 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for the three-dimensional Mn3O4/OMC hybrid is 1.6 times higher than the discharge value of 512 mA h g−1 for pure ordered OMC materials under the same experimental conditions. It is shown that the coulombic efficiency of the Mn3O4/OMC samples is higher than that of the OMC sample. The enhancement of electrochemical performance was due to the addition of metal oxide, reducing the number of active sites of OMC, and thus reducing the irreversible capacity.

Fig. 10 depicts the capacity vs. cycle number curves of the Mn3O4 nanoparticle electrodes cycled between 0.01 and 3 V at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for 50 cycles. For comparison of the discharge capacity between the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid and pure Mn3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. 9), the discharge capacity of the pure Mn3O4 samples is only 148 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, and the coulombic efficiency is 97.9%. The discharge value of the Mn3O4/OMC hybrids is more than 5.4 times higher than the discharge value of 148 mA h g−1 for pure Mn3O4 under the same experimental conditions.

To better illustrate the redox reactions, cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves for the first five cycles of the Mn3O4/OMC samples are shown in Fig. 11. The two reduction peaks at ∼0.3 V and ∼0.7 V in the first cycle are related to the electrochemical reduction of Mn3O4/OMC with Li and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.42 One oxidation peak at ∼1.2 V in the first cycle can be observed, indicating that the electrochemical oxidation reaction only has one step.43 During the first cycle, the formation of Mn and Li2O and the re-formation of Mn3O4 can be described by the electrochemical conversion reaction.33Mn3O4 + 8Li ⇔ 4Li2O + 3Mn
 Fig. 11  CV curves for the Mn3O4/OMC electrode for five cycles at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.0–3.0 V. 
From the second cycle, the extraction of lithium from carbon occurred at 0.1–0.5 V with a broad shoulder. Above 1.0 V (versus Li/Li+), an electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) charge–discharge process can be observed.30 Except for the first cycle, all reduction and oxidation peaks overlap well with those in the second cycle, indicating good electrochemical reversibility and structural stability.
As indicated by the above results, the lithium capacity of the Mn3O4/OMC nanocomposite is more stable upon lithiation/delithiation over 50 cycles than that of the OMC material. The Mn3O4/OMC hybrids display a high specific capacity up to 802 mA h g−1 even after 50 cycles at a high current density of 100 mA g−1, with a good rate capability and cycling stability. This value is 1.6 times higher than the discharge value of 512 mA h g−1 for pure ordered OMC materials, and more than 5.4 times higher than the discharge value of 148 mA h g−1 for pure Mn3O4 under the same experimental conditions.
It is believed that the significant improvement of the electrochemical Li storage performance of the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid materials is attributed to the unique structural characteristics of the ordered mesoporous hybrid of Mn3O4/OMC, which has a variety of favorable characteristics and properties.
(i) The hierarchical ordered mesoporosity facilitates the liquid electrolyte diffusion into the bulk of the electrode material and hence provides fast conductive ion transport channels for the conductive ions (e.g., solvated Li+ ions).44,45
(ii) The ordered mesostructured channels of the Mn3O4/OMC materials are also expected to buffer well against the local volume change during the Li uptake/removal reactions and thus to enhance the structural stability. The OMC in the obtained composite not only provides an elastic buffer space to accommodate the volume expansion/contraction of Mn3O4 nanoparticles during the Li ion insertion/extraction process, but also efficiently prevents the aggregation of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and the cracking or crumbling of the electrode material upon continuous cycling. It thus contributes to the high capacity, good coulombic efficiency, high rate capability and cycling stability.
(iii) Li-ion diffusion strongly depends on the transport length and accessible sites on the surface of the active materials. So, due to the large electrode/electrolyte contact area, short path length for Li transport, and good stability for nanostructured electrodes, the OMC matrix wall with a thickness of <10 nm greatly reduces the solid-state transport length for Li diffusion. Therefore, it is expected that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles as well as the OMC matrix in the nanocomposite offer improved energy storage capacity, coulombic efficiency, and better cycling stability.
(iv) The improved cycling performance can also be mainly attributed similarly to good electrical contact between Mn3O4 and OMC in the three-dimensional nanocomposites during phase transformation of Mn3O4 upon lithiation/delithiation that usually leads to capacity fading. OMC stacks can improve the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites by increasing the conductivity of the electrode materials and by stabilizing the electrode structure with a good electrical contact between Mn3O4 and the conductive OMC matrix during the charge–discharge process. The OMC in the composite has a good electrical conductivity and provides the conductive channels between Mn3O4 nanoparticles, which decreases the inner resistance of the lithium ion battery and is favorable for stabilizing the electronic and ionic conductivity, therefore leading to a higher specific capacity.
(v) The presence of Mn3O4 nanoparticles distributed among the three-dimensional OMC matrix effectively prevents the agglomeration of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and consequently maintains their high active surface area, which is favorable for increasing the Li storage capacity of the ordered mesoporous composite. On the basis of the above analyses, it is concluded that the synergetic effect between the conducting OMC matrix and Mn3O4 nanoparticles is responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the overall electrode via the maximum utilization of electrochemically active OMC and nanosized Mn3O4.
4. Conclusions
We developed a facile one-step route to Mn3O4/OMC hybrids with Mn3O4 nanoparticles homogeneously embedded within a three-dimensional OMC matrix for lithium ion battery applications. The presence of Mn3O4 nanoparticles homogeneously distributed within the three-dimensional OMC carbon matrix effectively prevents the agglomeration of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and consequently maintains their high active surface area, which is favorable for increasing the Li storage capacity of the ordered mesoporous composite. The Mn3O4/OMC hybrids display a high specific capacity of up to 802 mA h g−1 even after 50 cycles at a high current density of 100 mA g−1, with good rate capability and cycling stability. This value is 1.6 times higher than the discharge value of 512 mA h g−1 for pure ordered OMC materials, and more than 5.4 times higher than the discharge value of 148 mA h g−1 for pure Mn3O4. The enhanced capacity and cycling performance of the Mn3O4/OMC nanoarchitectures may benefit from the synergistic effects of the nanohybridization between Mn3O4 nanoparticles and the three-dimensional OMC. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements on the Mn3O4/OMC hybrid materials suggested that there exists good electrical contact between Mn3O4 nanoparticles and the OMC matrix during phase transformation of Mn3O4 upon lithiation/delithiation that usually leads to capacity fading. The homogeneously distributed Mn3O4 nanoparticles of about 10–15 nm within the three-dimensional OMC matrix allowed for the electrically insulating Mn3O4 nanoparticles to be wired up to a current collector through the underlying conducting OMC network. OMC can hinder the agglomeration and enhance the electronic conductivity of the active materials. OMC stacks can improve the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites by increasing the conductivity of the electrode materials and by stabilizing the electrode structure with a good electrical contact between Mn3O4 and conductive OMC during the charge–discharge process. This facile strategy may be extended to fabricate other ordered mesoporous carbon-encapsulated metal oxides.
