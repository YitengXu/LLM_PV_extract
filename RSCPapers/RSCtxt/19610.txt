In this study, we present a comparative theoretical study on the organic solar cell (OSC) performance of a fluorine-based non-fullerene acceptor FENIDT and the representative fullerene derivatives, PC61BM, based on the dependent/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TDDFT) calculations. Remarkably, according to the investigation on relevant parameters with OSC performance, FENIDT not only shows a much higher charge separation rate and lower recombination rate at the donor/acceptor interface, but also possesses a larger open circuit voltage and better electron mobility than that of PC61BM, which suggests that FENIDT might be more suitable as an acceptor material. Some speculations were provided to explain the superiority of PC61BM in experiments such as the simplified model method. Moreover, according to the advantages of FENIDT, a series of acceptors were designed. The results illustrate that the designed molecule 3 with a p-phenylenediamine unit based on the FENIDT shows better performance than others and may act as a promising acceptor material for OSCs. Finally, we hope our investigations in this study could provide a theoretical guideline of further optimization of the acceptor materials for OSCs.
1. Introduction
With the increasing complexity of environmental degradation contributed by the consumption of fossil fuels, particularly in Asian countries, increasing attention has been paid to the safe and clean energy resource, i.e., solar power. An organic solar cell (OSC) is a device that converts renewable solar energy into electric energy and has attracted tremendous interest in recent years because of several advantages such as low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1–4 However, compared with other solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs, which is an important index to evaluate the performance of a solar cell, is relatively lower, although a 10.6% record has been reached based on a single layer device.5 In the past three years, the development of OSCs has almost ceased to advance in light of no improvement in the PCE of OSCs. Therefore, extensive efforts by scientific researchers are still required in order to achieve a breakthrough in OSCs.
A typical OSC is usually composed of electron donor and acceptor materials, which together complete the conversion of light to electricity at the heterojunction interface. For instance, a blend of poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) constitutes a classical OSC, which has been widely investigated experimentally and theoretically in recent years.3,6,7 In comparison to several other designs, syntheses and theoretical studies of electron donor materials,8–10 the electron acceptor materials almost adopt fullerene derivatives all the time.11 Some advantages of fullerene derivatives (fullerenes),12–15 such as unique π-electron system, outstanding charge photogeneration property, large electron affinity, and favorable nanoscale morphology, make them particularly suitable for electron acceptor materials in OSCs. However, there are some inherent drawbacks for fullerene derivatives such as wide bandgaps, limited light absorption, poor solubility and high cost of most efficient derivatives, which may limit the effective improvement in PCE of OSCs. Aroused by the attempt to address the limitations of fullerene derivatives, massive syntheses of non-fullerene acceptor materials have been performed, particularly for small molecule acceptors.16–23 Compared to fullerenes, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have aroused numerous researchers' interests by the light of readily tunable electronic energy levels, high absorption coefficients and easy synthesis.24 In addition, hole transfer from an electron acceptor to a donor, which has been proven by recent work,25 may enhance the PCE to a great extent if the light absorption of the acceptor is highly improved. Therefore, seeking acceptor materials that not only retain the favorable properties of fullerenes but also overcome their disadvantages may become a means to overcome the current dilemma in OSCs.
The designs and syntheses of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors are long standing and many of them have been applied in OSCs.20,25–28 However, there is almost no non-fullerene acceptor material whose cell performance can outdo the ones of fullerenes to date. Recently, Troisi et al. attributed this to be due to the exceptional property of fullerene derivatives, namely, the existence of low lying (0.2–0.4 eV) excited states in their anions.29 It is also ascribed to the weaker electron transport abilities of non-fullerenes than fullerenes, which could induce a low short-circuit current density (Jsc) in OSCs.30 Many other reasons were also provided by experimentalists simultaneously.31,32 However, the primary reason remains to be confirmed. Thereby, it would require significant work to perform a deep theoretical comparative study on fullerenes and non-fullerene acceptors at the molecular level, which not only helps us understand the superiority of fullerenes but also provide support for designing new non-fullerene acceptors.
Recently, a new family of acceptors based upon the 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1,3-dione template was designed and synthesized. Among them, FENIDT (Fig. 1)33 can deliver PCE of up to 2.43% when it was blended with P3HT in the bulk heterojunction devices. While under the same condition, the OSC devices prepared by P3HT donor and PC61BM acceptor give the best PCE of 3.16%. It means that the non-fullerene material FENIDT is also an excellent acceptor for OSCs. In this study, a comparative investigation on PC61BM and FENIDT was presented based on density functional theory (DFT)34/time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)35 calculations. Combining with the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface model constructed by the same donor P3HT and the two acceptors mentioned above, some important parameters determining the PCE of OSC were evaluated and analyzed such as the energy levels related to Voc,36–38 the charge separation/recombination (CS/CR) rates and charge transport ability related to short-circuit current density (Jsc). These parameters, particularly for the CS/CR rates, were used to estimate the superiorities and defect of PC61BM and FENIDT.

Finally, based on the advantages of FENIDT, some derivatives 1–5 were designed to enhance the cell performance of non-fullerene acceptors in OSCs.
2. Computational methods
2.1 Quantum chemical calculation
First, it should be stated that the polymer P3HT and FENIDT were simplified during the calculation to reduce the computational cost. Both the n-hexyl chains of octamer P3HT and alkyl chains of FENIDT were replaced by methyl because it has been confirmed that the side alkyl chain has little influence on the electronic structure and optical properties of the materials.39–41 The geometries of all molecules depicted in Fig. 1 at ground state were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level, since the B3LYP42 were proven, by a large number of works, to give results that are in good agreement with the experimental structure.9 Our comparison of optimized geometry with the experimental one for FENIDT collected in Table S1† also affirms it. Based on the optimized geometries, we performed the vibrational frequency calculations at the same level, which confirmed that all the optimized structures are stable. As for the absorption, we used BP86, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP and BH and HLYP functions to simulate the absorption spectrum of FENIDT with 6-31G(d, p) basis set. The results (Fig. S1†) show that B3LYP are more reasonable than other functions and it could provide similar estimates of the transition wavelength and excitation energy with an experimental one (the difference is 0.18 eV). Moreover, the ground state and cationic state energies of all molecules were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level for retaining consistency. The transfer integrals were calculated by the site-energy corrected method43 with a PW91 function through the ADF44,45 package, as in our previous work.46–48
For the D/A interface model, it may be better to use molecular dynamics simulation to generate the packing structures only if appropriate force field parameters are employed. However, a method in which the initial separation distance between P3HT and PC61BM (FENIDT) is set as 3.5 Å is also widely used in interface model studies.3,8,49 The ground-state geometries of P3HT/PC61BM and P3HT/FENIDT interface models were then optimized by the dispersion-corrected functional B3LYP-GD2 with 6-31G(d, p) basis sets to consider the weak intermolecular interaction. To study the relevant parameters at the D/A interface, all calculations related with excited states were evaluated based on the TDDFT theory at CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level. The range separation function CAM-B3LYP,50 taking long range correction into account, has been proven to be appropriate for evaluating the excitation energies for D/A dimer system.51 Moreover, charge density difference (CDD) maps and absorption spectra were simulated by Multiwfn 2.3.52 All the abovementioned calculations were implemented in the Gaussian 09 program package.53
2.2 Charge separation/recombination rate
Considering the very weak coupling at the D/A interface, the non-adiabatic electron transfer theory was adopted. Both charge separation and charge recombination correspond to an electron transfer reaction, whose rates can be estimated by the semi-classical Marcus theory54 
(1)where VDA represents the electronic coupling between the initial and final states, ΔG is the Gibbs free energy of the reaction, and λ is the reorganization energy. T is the temperature (set to 300 K); kB and h denote the Boltzmann and Plank constants, respectively. Since this theory is based on many approximations, the accurate absolute charge separation/recombination rate is not the aim of this work. The comparisons and rate trends are more important to understand the cell performance of PC61BM, FENIDT and designed molecules.
The electronic coupling VDA was evaluated by the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) formalism,55,56 which refers to a vertical transition from the initial state to the final state. VDA is written as 
(2)where Δμ represents the dipole moment difference between the initial and final states, ΔE is the energy difference and μtr is the transition dipole between these two states.
Gibbs free energy change of charge recombination process (ΔGCR) can be estimated with57 
ΔGCR = EIP(D) − EEA(A)
(3)where EIP(D) represents the ionization potential of the donor and EEA(A) is the electron affinity of the acceptor. The ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor are normally estimated from the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, respectively.58 As an approximation, the Gibbs free energy change of charge separation process (ΔGCS) is estimated from the Rehm–Weller equation.57 
ΔGCS = −ΔGCR − ΔES1 − ΔEb
(4)ES1 and Eb are the energies of the lowest excited state of the free-base donor and exciton binding energy, respectively. Although there are other expressions to estimate the Gibbs free energy change,40,51 in this study, the values calculated using this method for P3HT/PC61BM are in good agreement with the experimental ones.59–61
Moreover, the calculation of reorganization energy (λ), which consists of internal energy (λi) and external energy (λs), is presented in the ESI.† Furthermore, we also evaluated the electron transport abilities of PC61BM, FENIDT and the designed systems by employing the Marcus charge transfer theory, which was also detailed in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The comparative study on PC61BM and FENIDT
In order to discuss the difference between PC61BM and FENIDT, we calculated some parameters related to PCE of OSCs such as Voc, energetic driving force (ΔE), interface charge separation/recombination rates at the D/A interface, and absorption spectra and electron transport ability related to Jsc.
3.1.1 Voc and energetic driving force. According to the expression of PCE, as a key parameter determining devices' efficiency, Voc has been studied extensively. Voc is contributed by some relative factors such as energetic distribution of the HOMO and LUMO levels of donor and acceptor, respectively, work functions of the electrodes, and charge recombination on the device.8,62 Many researchers have verified that the energy difference between the HOMO of donor and the LUMO of acceptor is a crucial factor for Voc.36,38,63 The estimation of Voc by considering the EIP(D)/EEA(A) offset is given in eqn (5). 
(5)where EIP(D) and EEA(A) correspond to the ionization potential of the isolated donor and the electron affinity of the isolated acceptor, respectively. The value of EIP(D) − EEA(A) have been normally estimated from the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. e is the elementary charge and ΔV is an empirical term that corresponds to the exciton binding energy. It is reported that the value is in the range of 0.1–1 V for the exciton binding energy. Herein, we assumed a median value of 0.5 V for it.8,36 Therefore, in terms of eqn (5), we estimated the Voc of FENIDT and PC61BM based on the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) value obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level with the same donor P3HT. All the FMO energies and Vocs are presented in Table 1. It suggests that Vocs of FENIDT and PC61BM are 1.24 and 0.96 V, respectively. Therefore, FENIDT could possess a larger Voc than PC61BM because the introduction of 1H-indene-1,3-dione units increases the LUMO level of FENIDT. This fact has been proved in the experiments and it also indicates the advantage of FENIDT in application of OSC.

To separate the exciton into free charge carriers during the interface charge transport process, enough energetic driving force (ΔE) is required, which is also related with the FMO energies.9 It has been previously suggested that a large ΔE at the organic D/A interface will increase the probability of separation exciton into the fully dissociated carriers and the ΔE should be larger than 0.35 eV,64 which can ensure the effective exciton splitting. It is known that ΔE can be obtained from the energy difference between the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor.64 When taking P3HT as an electron donor, ΔE for FENIDT and PC61BM is 0.79 eV and 1.07 eV, respectively, as shown in Table 1. They are both larger than 0.35 eV, which can guarantee the effective exciton dissociation at the D/A interface. Moreover, it is found that PC61BM has a larger ΔE than FENIDT, which also originates from the lower LUMO energy level of PC61BM. It suggests that PC61BM could possess a stronger ability to separate the exciton into free charge carriers than FENIDT.

3.1.2 Charge separation/recombination at the donor/acceptor interface. For a typical OSC, charge separation and recombination at the D/A interface, which compete with each other, definitively influence Jsc and further determine the entire PCE of the cell apart from exciton formation and migration to the D/A interface.1,2 The following discussion mainly focuses on the charge separation/recombination processes. In general, high PCE requires the rate of CS process (kCS) to be as high as possible and the rate of CR process (kCR) to be as low as possible.First, we established the D/A interface models as many other theoretical works did.63 The separation distance and relative position between P3HT and PC61BM (FENIDT) are referred to in the previous reports whose parameters have been commonly used in theoretical calculations of interface models (Fig. 2).8 The interface geometries were optimized by employing the B3LYP-GD2 function, which add the D2 version of Grimme' dispersion with the original D2 damping function and could give a better description of weak intermolecular interactions.65 Based on the optimized interface geometries, kCS and kCR could be estimated by adopting the semi-classical Marcus theory (shown in eqn (1)). According to eqn (1), kCS and kCR were calculated by taking into account the relevant parameters, electronic couplings (V), Gibbs free energies (ΔG) and reorganization energies (λ).

In order to evaluate the electronic coupling, finding the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) excited states is the first thing to do. As mentioned in previous works,39 the excited state, whose hole is only localized on the donor and the electron is only localized on the acceptor, is identified as the intermolecular CT excited state. We have calculated 12 excited states for each interface model and plotted the corresponding CDD maps in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). Referring to the CDD maps, we inferred that S1 and S7 states are the CT excited states for the P3HT/PC61BM interface, and S1, S3 and S7 states are the CT excited states for the P3HT/FENIDT interface. The CDD maps for these CT excited states are also exhibited in Fig. 3. In light of eqn (2), we calculated electronic couplings of the CT excited states for two systems and listed them in Table 2. The computational details are displayed in ESI.† It can be easily observed that the electronic coupling values of P3HT/FENIDT are larger than P3HT/PC61BM, which is closely related to the molecular structure characteristics. For FENIDT, it has a stronger interaction with P3HT than PC61BM due to its almost planar geometry structure,33 which may form large-area π–π interactions with simplified P3HT. Consequently, it is reasonable that P3HT/FENIDT possesses larger electronic coupling values in the case of relative unchanged positions. Herein, the hexyl groups on P3HT and 2-ethylhexyl groups on FENIDT are replaced by methyl groups, though the side alkyl chain has no significant influence on the electronic structure and optical properties of the materials but may impede forming favorable molecular stacking and accordingly influence the calculation results. It is worth noting that that the large electron coupling values of P3HT/FENIDT are inseparable from the idealized model. Accordingly, if the acceptor molecule has a short side chain or side chain with the appropriate direction, the electronic coupling strength can be enhanced highly through the formation of a favorable intermolecular packing at the D/A interface.

According to eqn (1), we can find that compared with electronic couplings, the reorganization energy as an exponential parameter undoubtedly affects the charge separation/recombination rate as well. The reorganization energy λ is normally decomposed into internal (λi) and external contributions (λs). The former mainly originates from the geometrical changes of the donor and acceptor, whereas the latter mainly derives from the change in electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium upon charge transfer. In accordance with eqn (S3)–(S8) (ESI†), we evaluated the λis of the P3HT/PC61BM and P3HT/FENIDT interfaces for both charge dissociation (λi-CS) and charge recombination (λi-CR) processes and listed them in Table 3. For the P3HT/PC61BM interface, the relaxation energy for P3HT required from the corresponding equilibrium geometry in the excited state to the optimal one in the cation state is equal to 0.069 eV and from the charged state to the excited state in D+A− is 0.073 eV. As for PC61BM, 0.075 eV is required from the ground state geometry to the radical anion and 0.075 eV is required from the anion state to the ground state. In particular, the λi1 and λi2 are thus equal to 0.144 eV and 0.148 eV, respectively, and thus λi-CS (0.15 eV) results from an average value between λi1 and λi2. In the case of charge recombination, λi-CR (0.17 eV) equals an average value between λi2 (0.148 eV) and λi3 (0.191 eV). For the P3HT/FENIDT interface, the λi-CS averaged between λi1 and λi2 is 0.20 eV and λi-CR is 0.23 eV. Comparing these two different interfaces, it is found that the λi between P3HT* FENIDT and P3HT+ FENIDT− states, namely, λi-CS, is larger than the value between P3HT* PC61BM and P3HT+ PC61BM− states, and the λi-CR, which is the λi between P3HT+ FENIDT− and P3HT FENIDT states, also presents the same trend. When the same donor P3HT was employed, the differences in λi are contributed by the different geometrical change of acceptors, which indicates that FENIDT has a larger geometrical relaxation during charge transfer than PC61BM. The sphere structure may make PC61BM more stable.

It is difficult to accurately calculate external reorganization energy λs at the D/A interface by employing quantum chemical methods. In this study, a simple model named “two-sphere model” was adopted, which is detailed in the ESI.† In term of eqn (S9) (ESI†), we estimated λs both for P3HT/PC61BM and P3HT/FENIDT interface models. It has reported that εo is in the range of 3.4–4 for the P3HT/PC61BM blend from the experiments.66,67 As a consequence, 3.4, which is the lower limit value, was used as a constant for εo in our calculations. εop is the optical-frequency dielectric constant and the typical value of 1.96 was adopted in our calculations.3 The calculated external reorganization energy is 0.34 eV, which is close to the results in ref. 51 where both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium solvent model were employed. As for the P3HT/FENIDT interface, the calculated external reorganization energy is also 0.34 eV. It is clear that there is almost no difference for the λs values between the P3HT/PC61BM and P3HT/FENIDT interfaces. Finally, λi plus λs gives the total reorganization energies, which are collected in Table 3. It shows that the non-fullerene acceptor FENIDT contributes larger reorganization energy than PC61BM, which is mainly induced by larger geometrical relaxation of FENIDT when it obtains an electron compared to PC61BM in terms of eqn (S3)–(S8) (ESI†).
In order to obtain the final CS and CR rates, in addition to the reorganization energies and the electronic couplings, we also need to estimate the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG), which is another important parameter. In general, both the interface CS and CR processes are considered to be exothermic reactions (ΔG < 0). Thus, according to Marcus theory, the rates would be significantly increased if the absolute value of the sum of ΔG and λ decreases, and the rates would reach a maximum value with the absolute value being equal to zero. For simplicity, we assumed that the electronic polarization contribution to the CT state is equal to that in the bulk materials. In terms of eqn (3) and (4) in Section 2.2, ΔGCR and ΔGCS would be obtained. Combining eqn (3) with eqn (4), the ΔGCS can be estimated by adding the energy of the lowest excited state and the exciton binding energy to ΔGCR. As can be seen from the calculation results in Table 3, for PC61BM, the ΔGCS and ΔGCR are −1.07 and −1.46 eV, respectively, while for the FENIDT, the ΔGCS and ΔGCR are −0.79 and −1.74 eV, respectively. Using the same donor P3HT, the higher LUMO energy level of FENIDT than that of PC61BM led to the smaller absolute value of ΔGCS for P3HT/FENIDT, which will prominently increase the kCS by reducing the sum of ΔGCS and λ at the interface according to Marcus theory. The kCR for P3HT/FENIDT is considered to be lower than that of P3HT/PC61BM, due to its larger absolute value of ΔGCR.
On the basis of the abovementioned parameters obtained, the kCS and kCR were evaluated in the light of the Marcus formula shown in eqn (1) and all the results along with relevant parameters are collected in Table 3. It is found that kCS is 5 orders of magnitude larger than kCR for P3HT/PC61BM. The kCS and kCR of the P3HT/FENIDT interface were calculated in the same way and all parameters are listed in Table 3. The detailed comparison reveals that the P3HT/FENIDT interface has the larger charge separation rate (kCS) and smaller charge recombination rate (kCR) than P3HT/PC61BM, which can be promoted to obtain the higher Jsc.

3.1.3 Absorption spectra and electron transport ability related to Jsc. To gain an insight into the difference of the FENIDT and PC61BM on other parameters in close connection with Jsc for OSCs,4 absorption spectra and electron mobility were investigated. The electronic transition properties of the investigated molecules were evaluated at B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level and shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, FENIDT has a wide absorption spectrum from 400 to 600 nm, and the spectrum consists of two absorption peaks at 502 and 359 nm, which are traced to the electronic transitions of HOMO → LUMO and HOMO−1 → LUMO+1, defined as π–π* of fluorenyl unit, π–π* of thiophene unit and charge transfer from fluorenyl to 1,3-indanedione unit, respectively. Moreover, we find that FENIDT possesses a red-shifted maximum absorption and a broader absorption band in the visible region compared with the PC61BM, suggesting that FENIDT may enhance the Jsc through realizing the hole transfer from acceptor to donor, since the light absorption of the acceptor is highly improved.

After the exciton dissociate into free charge carriers, the electron and hole will migrate towards the cathode and the anode, respectively. Consequently, the charge transport ability of the donor and acceptor is also a crucial factor to affect Jsc and further influences the entire efficiency of the OSC. As mentioned in the ESI,† the reorganization λ and transfer integral V are also two key parameters in determining the electron transfer rate. The total reorganization λ also consists of both the internal reorganization and the external reorganization,68,69 which is similar to the case at the D/A interface. However, the external reorganization influenced by the electronic and nuclear polarization by the surrounding medium were neglected here as performed by many papers.70 The reorganization energies calculated using the approximate method of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces at B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level are listed in Table 1. The reorganization energy of PC61BM and FENIDT is 0.15 eV and 0.26 eV, respectively. Referring to Marcus theory (eqn (S13), ESI†), the transfer integral, which requires a large overlap area between neighboring molecules, is an important parameter for assessing charge transport ability. Based on the crystal structures,33 the main carrier hopping pathways of FENIDT and PC61BM were selected and shown in Fig. 5 and 6. Moreover, the transfer integrals were calculated by the site-energy corrected method43 with the PW91 function. The differences in transport performance between PC61BM and FENIDT would originate from the different reorganization energy and the different intermolecular packing modes in the solid, which determine the intermolecular transfer integral. The intermolecular distance for each pathway and the corresponding transfer integral are collected in Tables 4 and 5. The transfer integrals of PC61BM are smaller than those of FENIDT because of the small orbital overlap between adjacent molecules for PC61BM (Fig. 5 and 6). In terms of the transfer integrals and reorganization energies mentioned above with eqn (S10) (ESI†), the electron mobilities were evaluated at the room temperature (300 K) and summarized in Table 1. The electron mobility of FENIDT (1.40 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) exceeds that of PC61BM (6.60 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which can effectively increase Jsc. Therefore, FENIDT could be expected to be a good alternative to fullerenes as acceptor materials for OSCs.

Finally, we summarize the comparison of the parameters related to Jsc between FENIDT and PC61BM. According to the abovementioned discussions, FENIDT could be found to have superiority in the effective charge separation at the D/A interface, light absorption and electron mobility abilities. However, this phenomenon is contrary to the experimental one. We conclude the cause as follows: (i) the simplified model selected: the hexyl groups on P3HT and 2-ethylhexyl groups on FENIDT are replaced by methyl groups, which would largely influence the practice stacking manner of the donor and acceptor, although the side alkyl chain has little effect on the electronic structure and optical properties. This simplified model may result in the primary difference between the theoretical results and experimental data. In order to demonstrate our speculation, we also investigated a P3HT/FENIDT dimer containing all hexyl groups and 2-ethylhexyl groups (P3HT/FENIDT-style1) at the same theoretical level. The parameters related to charge separation and recombination rates are collected in Fig. S4 and Table S2.† The kCS of 1.12 × 1015 s−1 and kCR of 1.06 × 108 s−1 suggest that P3HT/FENIDT-style1 has a slightly smaller kCS and a much larger kCR than simplified P3HT/FENIDT, which proves that the simplification of hexyl groups and 2-ethylhexyl groups can influence the stacking manner and finally lead to a great change in kCS and kCR. (ii) The pattern of molecule donor/acceptor blends: it is associated with the operation in the experiment and the physical properties of the materials. The spherical shape of PC61BM may give it an advantage in forming favourable donor/acceptor blends. (iii) Device structure: the real situation of the electrode is difficult to simulate. In particular, the relationship between the molecular orientation of the active layer and the electrode is mysterious. Therefore, the environment in our theoretical simulation is surely different from that in the experiment, which is inevitable for theoretical calculations nowadays. Nevertheless, it also provides an idea: since the side chains slightly influence the electronic structure, if the side chain of the designed molecules can be reduced as far as possible or controlled in the position and direction, the favourable 3D stacking structure of the molecules would be formed and the OSC performance would be improved.

3.2 The designed molecules based on the FENIDT
According to the advantages of FENIDT, the higher the Voc, the better light absorption and the higher electron mobility. We simultaneously designed some molecules based on FENIDT aiming to improve the performance of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors.
All the designed molecules shown in Fig. 7 employed the same theoretical methods with FENIDT, and the calculated molecular orbital energy levels and the FMOs are shown in Table 6 and Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), respectively. As seen in Table 6, all molecules have a larger ΔE than 0.35 eV, which can ensure the effective exciton splitting and charge dissociation. As for another factor related to the FMO energy level, Voc, they show in the order of 3 > 4 > 2 > 1 = FENIDT > 5 with the same donor P3HT as reference, implying that the designed molecules 2–4 could possess higher Voc than FENIDT. Herein, molecule 3 has the highest Voc because the introduction of the p-phenylenediamine unit increases the LUMO energy level.

Fig. 8 shows the absorption spectra of designed molecules along with FENIDT in o-dichlorobenzene for comparison. The maximum absorption peak with large oscillator strength originates from S0–S1, which mainly corresponds to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO. It can be seen that the maximum absorption of molecules 1, 4 and 5 is red shifted in comparison with the FENIDT, which can be explained by introducing the different central units. The red shift of the absorption spectra will facilitate more sunlight in the visible area and increase the Jsc of OCSs. Then, we studied the reorganization energy by potential energy surface curve method for all designed molecules, and the results show that the reorganization energy of all designed molecules increases in order of 3 < 4 < 2 < 5 < 1 < FENIDT. Referring to Marcus theory, if temperature is constant and we assume that the electronic coupling is similar to each other, reorganization energy is one of the key parameters governing the charge mobility. Herein, they are all smaller than that of FENIDT, which may make a better contribution to the transport properties for acceptor materials. As a result, molecule 3 could become a potential candidate in high-performance OSCs due to its outstanding performance. Then, a calculation was carried out to verify the speculation. We optimized the geometry of the P3HT/3 dimer by employing the same methods as mentioned in paragraph 3.1.2. The parameters related to CS and CR rates at the interface were evaluated at the same theoretical level. Here, two charge transfer states (S1 and S2) were found in S1–S10 (Fig. S5†). The parameters and results summarized in Table S3† suggest that 3 has comparative kCS with FENIDT and a much lower kCR than FENIDT and PC61BM due to the smaller sum of ΔGCS and λCS and a larger sum of ΔGCR and λCR according to the Marcus theory. Combining the advantages presented above, we further proved the superiority of our designed material 3.

4. Conclusions
In this study, a comparative study between an experimental molecule (FENIDT) and a classical acceptor molecule (PC61BM) concerning the interface model and single molecule level for OSCs was performed by DFT and TD-DFT methods. The results suggest that FENIDT not only maintains high Voc but also has a sufficient ΔE, which can ensure the effective exciton splitting from donor to acceptor. Moreover, it is also found that P3HT/FENIDT has a faster kCS and a slower kCR than that of P3HT/PC61BM at the interface model, which promotes effective exciton dissociation. In addition, FENIDT has an advantaged absorption spectrum favoring higher solar light absorption and larger electron mobility, which both have a positive effect on Jsc. The OSC performance of FENIDT is greater than PC61BM in theory, which is contrary to the experimental results and was ascribed to the huge difference between the theoretical model and practical case. Furthermore, according to the FENIDT, we designed a series of acceptor molecules. The parameters are also investigated to preliminarily evaluate the OSC performance designed materials. It confirms that molecule 3 with a p-phenylenediamine unit would be a promising acceptor for superior performance OSCs due to its high Voc, broad photo absorption and small kCR. Finally, we hope that these results might be favorable for further improving the performance of the OSCs.
