The non-fullerene OSC device based on PBDB-T:NTIC showed a highest PCE of 8.63%. With a relatively high-lying LUMO level of NTIC-OMe, the PBDB-T:NTIC-OMe based device obtained a comparatively high Voc of 0.965 V and a PCE of 8.61% simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the naphthalene core is a promising building block for constructing highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors and further boosting the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are one of the most promising technologies for solar energy conversion due to their attractive advantages such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and solution processibility.1–3 Over the last decade, thanks to the dramatic development of donor materials, including polymers and small molecules, as well as device optimization, fullerene-based OSCs have gained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 12%.4–10 Fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) have been widely used as acceptor materials, partially due to their high electron affinity and electron mobility, isotropic charge transportation, and formation of appropriate phase separation.11,12 In spite of the great success achieved by fullerene-based OSCs, the intrinsic drawbacks, such as their weak absorption of visible light, poor chemical and electronic adjustability, are the constraints for further improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. To tackle these issues, great attentions have been paid to develop non-fullerene acceptors with highly efficient absorption, facile synthesis and easily tuned energy levels.13–16
From the perspective of molecule design, the strategy of the incorporation of π-fused conjugated moieties, such as perylene diimide (PDI), naphthalene diimide (NDI), fluoranthene-fused diimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), has been widely explored.17–27 For small molecules, the successful donor materials are mostly with backbone structures of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) and have been widely used in highly efficient fullerene-based OSCs.28–32 Similarly, small-molecule acceptors with the A–D–A architecture have drawn great attention towards constructing devices with high efficiency.33–36 So far, the performance of non-fullerene (NF) based OSCs has surpassed those of fullerene-based opponents.37–41 Zhan et al. reported some pioneering A–D–A type NF small-molecule acceptors using an extended fused-ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as central building blocks, such as IDIC, ITIC and ITIC-Th. Recently, a series of NF small-molecule acceptors ITIC and their analogues have been synthesized, and excellent photovoltaic performance has been achieved for the devices using these materials.42–47
Recently, we reported two NF small-molecule acceptors FDICTF and NFBDT for highly efficient OSCs,48,49 in which the π-extended donor cores are fluorenedicyclopentathiophene and heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene), respectively. Since these two NF small-molecule acceptors have good light absorptions and high and balanced charge mobilities in blend films, they exhibited excellent photovoltaic performances with PCEs over 10%. In A–D–A type NF acceptors, planar π-extended donor cores could deliver red-shifted absorptions for harvested photons and enhanced Jsc. Thus, the strategy of using the ladder-type fused π-extended ring as a core unit should be a wise choice for constructing highly efficient NF OSCs.
Here, we report a new series of ladder type NF small-molecule acceptors with the A–D–A architecture utilizing hexacyclic naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene) as the core unit and 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile (INCN) as the end group, named NTIC. The fused naphthalene(cyclopentadithiophene) core unit has good planarity and rigidity because it is covalently bridged by the sp3-carbon with an alkyl phenyl group as the side chain. The resulting planar backbones could guarantee NTIC avoiding strong aggregation in the solid state to meet the requirements for efficient OSCs, such as good absorption, high mobility, and ideal morphology in the photoactive layer. We synthesized four non-fullerene small molecule acceptors as depicted in Scheme 1, namely NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F, with different substitutes on the end group. With this, we systematically investigated the substitution effect of end groups on the morphology of the BHJ layer and the photovoltaic performance of NF OSCs. From the perspective of complementary absorptions and energy levels, a wide band gap polymer poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) was selected as the donor material to fabricate devices with NTIC and its analogues as the electron acceptor materials. The highest PCE of 8.63% could be obtained by the device based on PBDB-T:NTIC. The device based on PBDB-T:NTIC-OMe could deliver a PCE of 8.61%, while in the meantime, a comparatively high Voc of 0.965 V could still be obtained.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic route for NTIC is depicted in Scheme 1. The Suzuki coupling reaction between compound 1 and ethyl 2-bromo-3-thiophenecarboxylate could deliver compound 2 in a yield of 88%. Compound 2 was nucleophilically attacked by excess aryl lithium reagents to get the tertiary alcohol, which could be used in the next step without purification. The intramolecular Friedel–Crafts reaction of the tertiary alcohol was catalysed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and gave the π-fused ring core 3. The dialdehyde compound 4 was prepared by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with POCl3 and DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) as a light-yellow solid. The desired NTIC was then obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation of the dialdehyde compound 4 with INCN in a good yield. NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F were synthesized by a similar procedure using different substituted INCN. NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). All the non-fullerene acceptors exhibit good solubility in common solvents (such as dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene). The thermal properties of the four compounds were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the data are shown in Table 1 and Fig. S1.† They all show good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) over 340 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. From the curves of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in Fig. S2,† no obvious melting point or recrystallization point was observed.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The photophysical properties of NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F in CHCl3 solution and as thin films were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and are depicted in Fig. S5† and 1d, respectively. These four molecules in diluted chloroform solution exhibit strong and broad absorption in the region of 500–700 nm, which is complementary to that of PBDB-T. NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F in CHCl3 solution showed an absorption peak at 650, 646, 651 and 657 nm, respectively, and the maximum molar extinction coefficients were determined to be 6.8 × 104, 8.5 × 104, 1.1 × 105 and 7.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. NTIC, NTIC-Me and NTIC-OMe films showed a red-shifted absorption peak at 694, 670 and 675 nm, respectively, while the NTIC-F film shows a more bathochromic-shift of 56 nm compared with that of its solution, indicating a more-ordered structure and closer π–π stacking in the thin film. The electrochemical behaviour of NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. The energy levels were estimated from the oxidation and reduction curve in CV spectra, and the measurement was referenced to the energy level of Fc/Fc+ (−4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The electrochemical and optical data are listed in Table 1. The LUMO levels of NTIC-Me and NTIC-OMe are estimated to be −3.73 eV and −3.70 eV, respectively, which are 0.03 and 0.06 eV higher than that of NTIC (−3.76 eV). In contrast to these typical electron acceptors, the comparatively high-lying LUMO levels of NTIC, NTIC-Me and NTIC-OMe indicate that a higher Voc could be obtained when used in non-fullerene OSCs. In addition, the LUMO offsets between PBDB-T and these four acceptors (NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F) are all larger than 0.7 eV, which are sufficient enough to transfer electrons from PBDB-T to the NF acceptor.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure donor/acceptor and the blend films were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† Compared with the neat film of NF acceptors (NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F), each blend film of the donor/acceptor exhibits significant fluorescence quenching, indicating that effective photo-induced charge transport occurs between PBDB-T and acceptors in the blend films, and almost all excitons dissociate, which is a prerequisite for efficient photovoltaic performance.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the four new non-fullerene acceptors, conventional OSCs based on PBDB-T:acceptor (NTIC, NTIC-Me, NTIC-OMe and NTIC-F, respectively) were fabricated with a device structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):poly-(styrenesulfonate))/active layer/PDINO (N,N′-bis(propylenedi-methylamine)-3,4:9,10-perylenediimide)/Al, where PDINO, developed by Li,50 is an effective cathode interlayer for efficient charge extraction and reducing recombination losses. After a series of optimization (Table 2), by using chloroform as the processing solvent, the optimal D/A weight ratio for all blends is 1:0.8, and the thickness of the active layer is about 100 nm. OSC devices based on the as-cast PBDB-T:NTIC/NTIC-Me/NTIC-OMe/NTIC-F films showed PCEs of 7.43%, 7.80%, 8.12% and 6.50%, respectively. With further chloroform solvent vapour annealing treatment, the PCEs of the four devices increased to 8.63%, 8.30%, 8.61% and 8.10%, respectively. Benefitting from the relatively high-lying LUMO energy levels of NTIC, NTIC-Me and NTIC-OMe, these three devices obtained a comparatively high Voc of 0.935, 0.963 and 0.965 V, respectively. Since NTIC-F has more red-shifted UV-vis spectra absorption, the device based on NTIC-F gave a relatively higher Jsc of 15.04 mA cm−2 compared with the other three devices. The current-density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs based on PBDB-T:NTIC/NTIC-Me/NTIC-OMe/NTIC-F with the optimal photovoltaic performance are summarized in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2.

The EQE spectra of devices with SVA are depicted in Fig. 2b. As indicated by the complementary UV-vis absorption of acceptors and the donor shown in Fig. 1d, the broad and high EQE curves ranging from 300 nm to 720 nm indicate that both polymer donor PBDB-T and NF acceptors made a separate and complementary contribution to the overall Jsc values. The EQE values of all the devices with SVA were higher than those of the as-cast ones, which is indicative of high photoelectron conversion efficiency in the devices with SVA treatment. The device based on PBDB-T:NTIC-F with SVA reached a highest EQE value of 74% and over 70% from 560 to 720 nm, while the other three devices gave relatively lower EQE values. This could be ascribed to their blue-shifted absorption spectra.
The plots of photocurrent (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff) for the four devices with SVA were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties in the devices (Fig. 2c). Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the dark. Veff = Vo − Va, where Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero.51 As depicted in Fig. 2c, when Veff reaches ∼2 V, Jph values for all the four devices reach saturation (Jsat), suggesting that charge recombination is minimized at higher voltage due to the high internal electric field in the devices. The charge dissociation and charge collection probability (P(E, T)) in the devices could be estimated by calculating the value of Jph/Jsat.52 Under the conditions of the short-circuit and the maximal power output, P(E, T) values are 95%, 78% for the NTIC based device, 92%, 74% for the NTIC-Me based device, 95%, 78% for the NTIC-OMe based device and 94%, 80% for the NTIC-F based device, respectively. The higher P(E, T) values of NTIC and NTIC-OMe based devices indicate that these two devices exhibit higher exciton dissociation and more efficient charge collection efficiency compared to the other devices.
The light-intensity (P) dependence of Jsc was measured to further investigate the charge recombination properties in the devices (Fig. 2d). The relationship between Jsc and P can be described by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pα, where the power-law exponent α implies the extent of bimolecular recombination. As can be seen in Fig. 2d, the α value for the device based on PBDB-T:NTIC, PBDB-T:NTIC-Me, PBDB-T:NTIC-OMe and PBDB-T:NTIC-F is 0.96, 0.96, 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. This indicates that small bimolecular recombination occurred in the devices based on this series of non-fullerene acceptors.
Morphology characterization and charge transport
The morphology of the active layers was studied by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As can be seen in the AFM images in Fig. 3a–d, the root-mean-square roughness of the SVA-treated blend films of PBDB-T:NTIC/NTIC-Me/NTIC-OMe/NTIC-F gave low values of 1.30, 1.80, 1.99 and 1.50 nm, respectively. The TEM images of the four optimized blend films are showed in Fig. 3e–h. All the blend films are uniform and without large phase separation. Among all the blend films, the PDBD-T:NTIC and PDBD-T:NTIC-OMe films exhibited increased nanofibrils and the more desired bi-continuous interpenetrating network between the donor and the acceptor, benefitting charge carrier generation and transportation. The bulk charge transport properties of the blend films with SVA were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole and electron mobilities were measured with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and Al/active layer/Al. The PBDB-T:NTIC, PBDB-T:NTIC-Me, PBDB-T:NTIC-OMe and PBDB-T:NTIC-F photoactive layers showed a hole/electron mobility of 19.1 × 10−5/9.15 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 7.29 × 10−5/6.93 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, 8.49 × 10−5/7.86 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1 and 8.00 × 10−5/6.59 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The comparatively higher hole and electron mobilities of the PBDB-T:NTIC blend film lead to an enhanced FF and the best PCE of the devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new series of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors with the ladder type fused ring using naphthalene as the central unit. Through the modification of substituents (H, Me, OMe and F) on the end group, a highest PCE of 8.63% was achieved in the OSC device based on PBDB-T:NTIC. Due to the high-lying LUMO levels of NTIC, NTIC-Me and NTIC-OMe, the OSC devices fabricated with PBDB-T as the donor showed relatively high Voc of up to 0.935, 0.963 and 0.965 V, respectively, which could be further used as the front cell in the tandem device in the near future. Therefore, the incorporation of the naphthalene core into an A–D–A backbone structure is an effective strategy for designing non-fullerene acceptors for high performance OSCs. With the versatile chemical structure of naphthalene, NF-acceptors based on the naphthalene core have great potential to be designed and modified for screening highly efficient OSCs.
