Although high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 17% have been achieved using non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in thin-film OSCs, the performance of thick-film OSCs lag behind those of thin-film OSCs owing to the increased probability of charge recombination in thick film. To realize a transition from the laboratory-scale to industrial high-throughput manufacturing, the foremost aspect is to develop highly efficient photoactive materials that are capable of exhibiting attractive performances under a thick film with an optimal morphology for charge generation and transport. In this review, we summarize the developments of materials used for efficient thick-film OSCs over the last decades and present the remaining challenges for realizing the practical application of OSCs.Yilin ChangYilin Chang received her B.S. degree from Shanxi Agricultural University in 2016 and M.S. degree from University of Science & Technology Beijing in 2019.

1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention from academia and industry owing to their advantages, such as low toxicity and easy processability and film deposition, as well as the prospect of fabricating large-scale and flexible photovoltaic modules through inexpensive coating or printing techniques.1–4 Over the past two decades, remarkable achievements have been made in the field of OSCs through the design of novel photoactive materials,5–10 the optimization of active layer morphology,11–14 the introduction of new device structures15–18 and interface engineering.19–22 Currently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have reached over 17%.23–25 Notably, most of the high efficiencies of OSCs reported have been achieved with an active layer thickness of approximately 100 nm and an area of less than 1 cm2.26,27 This is mainly because the optimal thicknesses of the reported active layers are accurately controlled, and even small changes in thickness will result in sharp declines in device performance and a poor reproducibility.28 In addition, because a thin film on a rough substrate is prone to spot defects, which will increase exponentially with an expansion of the active area,29,30 a scaling-up of such devices from the laboratory scale to the industrial scale may incur serious losses in efficiency.27,31,32 Therefore, to obtain pin-hole free and uniform films through scalable deposition techniques, thick active layers of over 200 nm are usually required during roll-to-roll or other printing processes.33–36 Clearly, the development of highly efficient OSCs with a relatively thick active layer, suitable for large-area printing processes, is an inevitable requirement for commercialization in this field.
Optimal PCEs are generally achieved with an active layer of as thin as 100 nm for most OSCs. However, for these thin-film OSCs, a low charge carrier mobility, space charge accumulation, and charge carrier recombination will inevitably occur as the thickness increases to more than 200 nm.8,37,38 Accordingly, some typical and high-mobility organic semiconductors, such as P3HT, have been gradually introduced into thick-film OSCs.39,40 For many years, P3HT has been a hot topic in this research, owing to its thickness insensitivity and reproducible device performance. When blended with indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA), a high PCE of 7.4% with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 75% has been obtained with an active layer thickness of 200 nm.40 The high FF can be attributed to the high hole mobility (μh) of 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and favourable film morphology.39,41 However, because the solar light harvesting of the active layer is limited by the wide optical bandgap of P3HT (∼2 eV), the lower short-circuit current density (JSC) in combination with modest open circuit voltage (VOC), which is caused by the high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of P3HT, limits its further practical applications.29,42 Relevant studies have focused on the development of highly efficient donor materials with modified bandgaps and energy levels. Before the rise of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), owing to the high mobility and isotropic charge transporting properties of fullerene acceptors,43,44 many studies have been carried out to improve the charge mobility and planarity of donors through the design of new chemical structures or effective treatment, aiming for a balanced mobility and optimized film morphology.12,45,46 Among them, a series of conjugated polymers with strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) properties have achieved success for use in thick-film OSCs with PCEs of over 10%.6,44 Unlike ball-like fullerene, NFAs with planar backbones exhibit low mobility and anisotropic transport characteristics, mainly because the charge transport ability is significantly affected by its molecular π–π stacking.47–49 Therefore, it is much more challenging to achieve highly efficient thick-film NFAs-type OSCs with a balanced charge transport and ideal nanoscale film morphology. However, this issue has been effectively addressed by means of continuous adjustments of the molecular structures. To date, a series of NFAs based on ladder-type (such as ITIC and its derivatives)7,50,51 and Y-type structures (such as Y6 and its derivatives)8,38,52,53 have been successfully introduced into thick-film OSCs. Benefiting from the extremely high efficiencies of this type of NFA-based OSC with a thin active layer thickness, such devices can still exhibit particularly high PCEs of approximately 15% with an active layer thickness of up to 200 nm.3,38 In addition, introducing a third component into the host binary system is also beneficial for enhancing the performance of thick-film OSCs by improving the charge mobility, reducing the recombination of carriers and optimizing the morphology of the active layer.54,55Fig. 1 illustrates the development status of thick-film OSCs in the past decades.

In this review, we first briefly summarize the factors that limit the efficiency of thick-film OSCs and then simply discuss the key issue, the physical processes of the charge generation and extraction in thin and thick heterojunctions, through carrier drift-diffusion models. Readers interested in these models or mechanisms are referred to several articles dedicated to their development.29,38,42,56–60 The focus of this review is to summarize the development of photoactive materials for high-efficiency thick-film OSCs during the past decades and highlight the correlation between chemical structures, physical properties, morphological characteristics, and the resulting device performance. We attempt to provide an unambiguous understanding from material design to morphology control, thereby promoting future commercial applications of OSCs.
2. Key factors impacting performances of thick-film OSCs
2.1. Optical interference
In general, most highly efficient OSCs exhibit an optimal performance with an active layer thickness of ∼100 nm. With such a thin film, 20–40% of the incident photon flux is wasted, limiting the JSC of the corresponding OSCs.29,57,60 In any case, the absorption of the photoactive layer cannot reach 100% because the active layer is embedded within a stack with different complex refractive indexes. When the thickness of the active layer is less than the coherence of light, the optical interference between the incident light and the reflected light allows a part of the light to be absorbed by the active layer, thus displaying different maximum values at different thicknesses.29,57 Ko et al. investigated the relationship between the optical properties and photocurrent of OSCs based on four material systems. For each system, a series of devices based on PC61BM/PC71BM with thicknesses ranged from 35 to 450 nm were fabricated in both conventional and inverted architectures.61 As shown in Fig. 2, in both conventional and inverted devices, the theoretical maximum JSC (Jopt) increases with the thickness of the active layer and shows local maximum, including the first maximum interference (80–100 nm) and second maximum interference (at approximately 200 nm). Although in these devices, the active layers still absorb additional light when the film thickness exceeds the second maximum interference, for most OSCs, the FFs decrease significantly with increasing thickness, and these OSCs exhibit the maximum performances near the first maximum interference.

2.2. Charge generation and transport
In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, the generation of free carriers by exciton dissociation is an extremely fast process, which can be assumed to be instantaneous compared with the carrier transport.42,62 According to the transfer matrix model, the charge carrier distribution profiles in the thin and thick films are obviously different. In a thin film, the carriers are generated within the bulk, whereas in a thick film, most carriers are produced near the transparent electrode. The difference in carrier distribution in these two cases also leads to the difference in carrier transport physics.42 As shown in Fig. 3, in thin-film devices, although the mobility ratios of the three material systems are significantly different, there is no significant difference between the free carrier distribution of conventional and inverted devices, and the charge recombination is negligible. As the film thickness increased to 700 nm, the effects of the device structures on the charge generation and recombination have been highlighted, particularly for BHJ films with an unbalanced hole and electron mobility. In a thick-film device, the electrons or holes must transport a long distance before being collected by the electrode. Consequently, to reduce the carrier recombination probability caused by a long-distance carrier transport, the appropriate device structure should be carefully selected according to the imbalance of the hole and electron mobility. In addition, it is worth noting that solution processed ZnO electrode also has huge impact on charge recombination and thus device performance, since ZnO film still has unreacted organic residual and other chemical species, which are possible to formulate the recombination centres.63 In terms of the charge carrier transport, drift and diffusion play different roles.56,64,65 Free charge carriers are transported through a drift under the assistance of a build-in electric field, and through diffusion under the region without an electric field. Previous studies have shown that the photocurrent generated in OSCs can be correlated with the width of the depletion region associated with the junction thickness.66–68 As shown in Fig. 4, when the electric field extends to the entire depletion region under a 100 nm device, the dominant charge transport mechanism is the drift of the carriers. When the thickness increases to 300 nm, only a part of the active layer is the depletion zone, and there is little electric field in the other part; thus, carrier diffusion plays a more significant role to avoid a loss in the photocurrent.56 However, a purely diffusive transport does not lead to an efficient charge extraction. In this case, improving the hole and electron mobility should be an effective way to increase the carrier diffusion capability, thus promoting carrier transport.

2.3. Charge recombination
From the above analyses, we know that a charge recombination is the main factor affecting the performance of thick-film OSCs owing to the extended carrier transport distance and the lowered build-in electric field. To date, a large number of studies have been devoted to achieving a high mobility of the materials and a balanced charge transport to inhibit a bimolecular recombination and obtain a high FF.55,69,70 These requirements for a charge transport have become the foundation for the construction of thick-film OSCs. However, the density of the trap state, which has rarely been studied, also merits serious consideration in the field. Very recently, Hou's group demonstrated that a higher trap-state density is also a major issue hindering the photovoltaic performance of thick-film OSCs. The authors fabricated two types of OSCs by employing PBDB-TF as the donor and IT-4F and BTP-4Cl as the acceptor, respectively.38 The blend films of PBDB-TF:IT-4F and PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl showed similar mobilities and high FFs in thin-film (∼100 nm) devices. However, when the film thickness increased to 1000 nm, although they both exhibited remarkable and balanced mobilities, PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based OSCs exhibited a low PCE (4.72%) with a severely decreased JSC and FF. By contrast, PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl-based OSC was still able to achieve an excellent PCE of 12.1%. According to the mobility results shown in Fig. 5a and b, it can be concluded that the hole and electron mobilities of these two types of blend films are at the same level, regardless of the film thickness. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, by monitoring the recombination kinetics of the four devices, they found that the bimolecular recombination was mostly negligible in the four devices, whereas trap-induced monomolecular recombination dominated in the thick-film devices, and the trap-state density of PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl-based devices was less than that of PBDB-TF:IT-4F-based devices. A lower trap-state density leads to a lower trap-induced recombination and longer carrier lifetime, which are beneficial for maintaining a high JSC and FF for a thick-film OSC. These results indicate the important impact of the trap state density on the performance of a thick-film OSC and provide a new idea for the construction of high-performance thick-film OSCs. Besides, another form of recombination, surface-trap assisted recombination cannot be ignored.71 Since VOC tends to decrease slightly as the film thickness increases in most of thick-film systems, while surface trap-assisted recombination is the main loss mechanism reducing the VOC.72,73 Although this type of recombination is likely less impacted by an increased film thickness, it can be predicted that the relationship between the two will be more clarified as the research moves along.

2.4. Active layer morphology
It is well known that a nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating network structures are central targets for the morphology optimization of the active layer. To address these issues, a range of treatment methods, such as solvent additive processing,13,74,75 thermal annealing76 and solvent vapor annealing77 have been intensively studied and widely used for active layer morphology control. By means of these methods, the morphology of the thin active layer can be effectively controlled. However, when it comes to the thick film, some adjustments must be employed to maintain the desired morphology. For example, for PTB7:PC71BM-based OSCs, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), with a high boiling point of 332.5 °C, is often used to optimize the active layer morphology.13 Such an effect mainly stems from the different solubility of PTB7 and PC71BM in DIO based on Hansen solubility parameters.78 During spin-coating of the blend solution, as the host solvent (chlorobenzene) with a low boiling point (132.2 °C) rapidly volatilizes, the donor phase, which is insoluble in the DIO, is established earlier than the acceptor phase. The removal of the DIO, through vacuum drying or inert solvent washing, makes it possible for the acceptor phase to be established, from which nanoscale phase separation with an interpenetrating network is successfully achieved. However, when the active layer thickness increases to 300 nm, the DIO existing at the surface area of the active layer is removed first, and the DIO in the underneath area is moved slowly toward the surface, causing an additional solvent vapor annealing effect and further leading to large PC71BM domain aggregation, which is unfavourable for charge extraction and transport (Fig. 6a–c). However, when o-chlorobenzaldehyde (CBA) with a low boiling point of 212 °C is applied as a new solvent additive to the thick film, relatively uniform morphologies can be obtained (Fig. 6d–f) largely because the CBA can be volatilized rapidly during the spin-coating process, and excessive solvent vapor annealing does not occur in the thick active layer. The relatively favourable morphology for a thick active layer has been a key driver owing to its high performance.

Ideally, the optimal active layer morphology not only requires a nanoscale phase separation with bicontinuous interpenetrating network structures for a reduced charge trapping it also needs a proper vertical phase gradation for a suppressed carrier recombination, particularly for thicker films. Guo et al. reported an inverted thick-film OSC with an extremely high FF of over 70%.11 The authors found that a vertical phase gradation plays a significant role in realizing a high FF. More specifically, owing to the difference in surface energies between the polymer and PC71BM, as well as the interaction with ZnO in the inverted device, the polymer donor aggregates on the blend/air interface, and the PC71BM concentrates in the blend/ZnO interface, thus resulting in a vertical phase gradation. Fig. 7a shows the corresponding schematic of the vertical phase gradation in the inverted device. The cross-sectional TEM image (Fig. 7b) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. 7c) fully demonstrate that PC71BM is enriched around the active layer/ZnO interface. As mentioned above, most excitons are generated and disassociated near the transparent electrode side. In such an inverted structure and vertical phase gradation, PC71BM enriched on the ZnO side is conducive to electron transport and collection, while suppressing the hole leakage to the ZnO-coated cathode. Similarly, the distribution of the polymer donor facilitates hole transport and collection and inhibits electron leakage to the MoOx-coated anode. This type of vertical phase gradation is particularly effective in reducing a recombination at the contacts. The ideal vertical phase gradation combined with the appropriate device structure is conducive to improving the efficiency of the charge transport and collection, suppressing the carrier recombination, and resulting in a high FF and PCE for thick-film OSCs.

3. Highly efficient material systems for thick-film OSCs
3.1. Representative polymer donors for fullerene-type thick-film OSCs
Over the past decades, alternating conjugated copolymers composed of electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient (A) building blocks have been considered the most promising strategies for constructing high-performance donor materials.5,79,80 Because the energy level, light-harvesting property, planarity of the backbone, intermolecular interaction, and charge transport characteristics can be fine-tuned using a proper combination of D and A units.81–84 To date, many building blocks with enlarged planar structures and a strong electron-donating/withdrawing capability have been developed and successfully applied to the construction of fullerene-type thick-film OSCs. These relevant polymer donors are divided into four categories according to the chosen electron-deficient units (Fig. 8) and summarized in this section, the corresponding chemical structures are presented in Fig. 9, 11, 12 and 14, and the detailed photovoltaic performances with optimal film thickness are listed in Tables 1–4.

3.1.1 Fluorine substituted benzothiadiazole (FBT)-based polymers. 
Benzothiadiazole (BT)-based conjugated polymers show attractive performances in OSCs, benefiting from their unique electro-optical characteristics.85 It is well known that the electron-withdrawing ability and small steric effect derived from fluorination can increase the VOC of the corresponding device by lowering the HOMO energy levels of the difluorobenzothiazole (FBT)-based copolymer.45,86 Moreover, the introduction of fluorine atom to the conjugated polymer can also enhance its intermolecular interaction by improving the coplanar property of the polymer through weak intramolecular non-covalent interactions (C–H⋯F, S⋯F).87–89 Therefore, a series of D–A copolymers based on a FBT unit and its derivatives have been developed and applied in the construction of highly efficient thick-film OSCs. Wang et al. synthesized a series of FBT-based conjugated copolymers with two distinctive side chains on benzodithiophene (BDT) units.79 Among them, PBDTHDO-DTHBTff, of which the bulk branched alkoxy groups were introduced as substituents, showed good solubility and high crystallization capability. Blending it with PC71BM, an optimal PCE of 8.3% was achieved with a ∼100 nm thick active layer. When the film thickness increased to 200 nm, the corresponding device still exhibited a high PCE value of 7.27%. The superior performance is associated with the high hole mobility of the polymer and better nanoscale morphology of the thick active layer. Compared with the alkoxy-substituted BDT-based polymer, two-dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers based on alkylthienyl-substituted BDT always exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra, lower HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, and significantly higher hole mobility.90 Based on this molecular design strategy, Duan et al. also synthesized an FBT-based polymer (BDT-FBT-2T) containing thienyl-substituted BDT and FBT units, which possessed an ideal bandgap, relatively deep HOMO energy level and high hole mobility.86 Benefiting from these features, the BDT-FBT-2T/PC71BM based device showed a high PCE of 7.7% with an optimal active layer thickness of ∼250 nm. Generally, the enhanced coplanarity of polymer will largely promote charge carrier transport. Nguyen et al. synthesized a FBT-based polymer, PPDT2FBT, with dialkoxyphenylene unit, FBT unit and two thiophene bridges.45 By virtue of the noncovalent attractive interactions between S (in thiophene) and O (in alkoxy groups), between S (in thiophene) and F (in BT), and between C–H (in thiophene) and N (in BT), the torsional angle of polymer chain was obviously minimized, thus maximizing the coplanarity. Accordingly, PPDT2FBT showed a highly ordered structure, tight interchain packing and extremely high hole mobility. Furthermore, the PPDT2FBT/PC71BM-based device afforded a high PCE of 9.39% and FF of 73% with active layer thickness of 290 nm. In addition to the special molecule structure, balanced hole and electron mobilities as well as well-distributed nano-fibrillar morphology also played significant role in this thick-film OSCs.
Quarterthiophene with solubilizing alkyl chains has been widely used in the construction of highly efficient thick-film OSCs. A conjugated polymer, FBT-Th4(1,4), based on quarterthiophene with second-position branched alkyl chains as electro-donating unit and FBT as electron-withdrawing unit was synthesized by Chen's group.91 The polymer possessed strong temperature-dependent aggregation property, exhibiting strong interchain aggregation in solution at room temperature. This aggregation property results in field-effect hole mobility up to 1.92 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the neat film and space charge limited current (SCLC) hole mobility of 7.22 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for FBT-Th4(1,4)/PC71BM blend film. And FBT-Th4(1,4)-based OSC with active layer thickness of 230 nm afforded a PCE of 7.64%. By replacing 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) chain in FBT-Th4(1,4) with 2-octyldodecyl (OD), Yan's group explored the influence of size of alkyl chain on the polymer crystallinity and domain purity while maintaining the temperature-dependent aggregation property.44 As a result, the average purity of the polymer/polymer-rich domains in PffBT4T-2OD:PC71BM film is 100% with a small domain size of 40 nm. The highly crystalline polymer, combined with sufficiently pure and small polymer domains, exhibits excellent SCLC hole mobility of 1.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and high-performance of 10.5% with FF up to 74% when the active layer is 300 nm thick. Removing the fluorine atoms from BT to thiophene, the new polymer, PBTff4T-2OD, still exhibited similar properties to PffBT4T-2OD, producing a PCE of 10.4% with same film thickness. By fine-tuning the alkyl chain, PffBT4T-C9C13 showed similar performance as PBTff4T-2OD under the same preparation conditions.12 However, when processed by non-halogen solvent, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and new additive, 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN), the blend film of PffBT4T-C9C13/PC71BM showed a face-on-dominant orientation, improved domain purity and reduced domain size. The efficient and more balanced carrier transport results in a high PCE of 11.7% with film thickness around 350 nm. Based on these structures, He et al. reported a similar FBT-based copolymer, but with alkylthiophene instead of alkyl as side chains for thiophene bridge and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) instead of 2,2′-bithiophene (part of quaterthiophene).92 The new polymer (P-TT) also displayed temperature-sensitive aggregation in solution and favourable face-on packing mode in solid state. The photovoltaic performances of P-TT/PC71BM-based devices are insensitive to the film thickness and corresponding PCEs are all above 9% with film thickness of 200–360 nm, owing to the balanced charge carrier mobilities and desired nanoscale morphology.
Besides fluorination, chlorination is also an effective approach to lower the HOMO energy levels of polymers. He's group reported a new chlorinated benzothiadiazole (ClBT) unit and synthesized a series of ClBT-based polymers. Through side chain engineering, a high-efficiency polymer, PBDTHD-ClBTDD, was finally obtained, which also present favourable applicability for thick-film OSCs.93 To be specific, the corresponding device showed PCEs as high as 9.11% for a 250 nm thick active layer. In addition to the regular polymer, random conjugated copolymer also can be applied for thick-film OSCs. Chen's group introduced the siloxane-terminated side chains to the polymer backbone of FBT-Th4(1,4) and synthesized three random copolymers with different amount of siloxane-terminated side chains.94 Among them, PFBT4T-C5Si-25% exhibited face-on orientations and high hole mobility both in lateral and vertical direction. Moreover, the polymer also maintained the strong temperature-dependent aggregation property (Fig. 10a), suggesting much stronger interchain aggregation in the room temperature. After blended with PC71BM, the device presented a outstanding feature of high thickness tolerance. With the film thickness increased from 270 nm to 600 nm, the corresponding PCEs are all above 10% and FFs are above 71% (Fig. 10b).
The success of FBT unit for thick-film OSCs has inspired the synthesis of other similar units, such as replacing the sulfur atoms in FBT with nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Compared with BT, benzotriazole (TAZ) based polymer is more electron-rich, leading to higher LUMO energy level for the corresponding polymer. You's group reported a relevant polymer (PBnDT-FTAZ) which incorporates BDT as the electron-donating unit and fluorinated TAZ as the electron-withdrawing unit.46 The PBnDT-FTAZ/PC61BM-based device yielded an optimal PCE of 7.1% with 250 nm film thickness. More excitingly, it still maintained 6% efficiency even at an unprecedented thickness of 1 μm. Moreover, they also attempted to introduce electron-withdrawing element into the TAZ core and reported a series of polymers with low HOMO energy levels. Among them, PBnDT-PyCNTAZ with cyano substituted pyridine-fused triazole gave the optimal PCE of 8.4% and an extremely high VOC of 0.96 V with active layer thickness of 300 nm.95 Yan's group also reported a TAZ-based polymer (PffT2-FTAZ) with very similar structure as PBTff4T-2OD.96 Although limited by its large optical bandgap, PffT2-FTAZ-based device exhibited a moderate PCE of 7.8% and an impressive FF of 71% with a thick active layer of 250 nm. Replacing the BT unit with its analogue benzoxadiazole (BX), which has higher electronegativity, could lead to a higher VOC for the OSCs by downshifting the HOMO energy levels of polymers. Using fluorinated BX (ffBX) as the electron-withdrawing unit, Yan's group reported a new polymer, PffBX4T-2DT,97 possessing very similar polymer backbone as PffBT4T-2OD. The polymer exhibited low HOMO energy level, high crystallinity, high mobility and favourable molecule orientation, leading to a respectable PCE of 9.4% and high VOC of 0.88 V with a thick film of 250 nm. Another high efficiency BX-based polymer, BDT-ffBX-DT, was reported by Huang's group.98 BDT unit was introduced to the backbone mainly due to its weak electron-donating ability and excellent planarity. When blended with PC61BM, the same performance as PffBX4T-2DT was achieved even with the same film thickness, but showing significantly improved VOC of 0.93 V.


3.1.2 Naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (NT)-based polymers. 
Compared with BT, NT, containing two fused BT units, has an enlarged planar aromatic structure, which is beneficial for enhancing interchain packing and thus improve carrier mobility.99 The initially reported NT-based polymer, PBDT-DTNT, showed more red-shifted absorbance, higher hole mobility and significantly improved photovoltaic performance compared to the analogous BT-based polymer, PBDT-DTBT.99 Then, with the inverted device structure and new electron extraction layer (PFN-OX), PBDT-DTNT exhibited a PCE of 8.62% with an active layer thickness of 280 nm.100 Notably, a PCE of 7.24% can still be obtained even with the film thickness of up to 940 nm. This result suggests that NT is a very promising building block for developing highly efficient thick-film OSCs, which will be fully demonstrated by the following discussion. Osaka et al. reported another type of NT-based polymer, composed of NT and naphtho-[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT).101 When linear alkyl chains were introduced to the 5,10-positions of the NDT unit, a dramatic change in polymer orientation was observed, and the most favourable face-on orientation for OSCs was successfully achieved in an alkyl-substituted NDT-based polymer (PNNT-12HD), which also exhibited a much higher solubility than its counterpart of PNNT-12DT. Consequently, the PNNT-12HD:PC71BM-based conventional device delivered an optimized PCE of as high as 8.2%, of which the active layer thickness was 300 nm.
In the aforementioned study reported by Yan's group, an NT-based polymer (PNT4T-2OD) also displayed excellent properties for thick-film OSCs,44 in addition to two BT-based polymers (PffBT4T-2OD and PBTff4T-2OD). Vohra et al. reported an NT-based polymer (PNTz4T) similar to PNT4T-2OD, composed of NT unit and quaterthiophene with different alkyl chains.18 The two polymer-based inverted OSCs both presented high efficiencies of ∼10% with an active layer thickness of approximately 300 nm. However, in Vohra's work, the distributions of face-on and edge-on crystallites along the film thickness in conventional and inverted devices were revealed through GIWAX analyses of the blend films, providing a convincing explanation for the significantly improved JSC and FF in the inverted architecture. Takimiya's group and Cho's group reported the same NT-based polymer, comprising the NT unit and fluorine-substituted quaterthiophene, but with the different name, i.e., PNTz4TF2102 and P4TNTz-2F.103 Interestingly, the two OSCs showed almost the same PCEs, but with a different optimal active layer thickness of 230 nm for the PNTz4TF2-based device and 350 nm for the P4TNTz-2F-based device. This difference may be attributed to the bicontinuous interpenetrating donor/acceptor networks containing narrow polymer nanowire (PNW) structures and acceptor crystalline nanostructures for the P4TNTz-2F/PC71BM-based blend film, which effectively increased the interfacial area between the donor and acceptor and facilitated charge separation and transport even in the thick active layer.
Unlike the above quaterthiophene and NT-based polymers, Jin et al. replaced 2,2′-bithiophene (part of quaterthiophene) with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), thiophene (T) and benzodithiophene (BDT) and reported three new NT-based polymers, NT812,104 PNTT105 and PNTBDT,105 respectively. These NT-type polymer-based OSCs all exhibited PCEs of greater than 10% and FFs of above 70% with active layer thicknesses of approximately 300 nm. It is worth mentioning that the PCE of the PNTT-based OSC was still greater than 9% even with an active layer thickness of up to 1 μm. In addition, more slender fibrous structures and continuous interpenetrating features of high molecular weight PNTT-based blend films are also impressive, which effectively facilitate charge carrier transport in the thick film. Naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]oxadiazole (NO) is a newly fused heterocycle as an oxygen analogue of NT. Presumably, NO-based polymers also have the advantage of the thick-film OSCs owing to the same conjugated backbone as NT-based polymers. Takimiya's group demonstrated that a NO-based polymer (PNOz4T) affords an optimal PCE of 8.9% with an active layer thickness of 225 nm.106 Importantly, PNOz4T showed deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels with a narrower bandgap of 1.52 eV than those of the NT-based counterpart polymer (PNTz4T), leading to a remarkably high VOC of 0.96 V and a small photon energy loss (Eloss) of ∼0.5 eV.


3.1.3 Imide- and lactam-based polymers. 
Thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), with a strong electron-withdrawing property and coplanar structure, is a very functional building block for organic semiconductor materials. The 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI) unit can be considered as the derivative of the TPD unit, possessing a more expanded conjugated structure than that of TPD. Guo et al. synthesized two D–A copolymers (PTPD3T and PBTI3D) with similar structure, using terthiophene as an electron-donating unit and TPD and BTI as electron-withdrawing units, respectively.11 Impressively, both PTPD3T-and PBTI3D-based inverted OSCs showed extremely high FFs of 76–80%, attributed to the highly ordered face-on orientation of the polymer for high carrier mobility and vertical donor/acceptor phase gradation for suppressed carrier recombination. Owing to these points, the corresponding thick-film OSCs also exhibited relatively high PCEs of over 6% and FFs of over 70% with a film thickness of 200 nm. In our previous study, we also reported a TPD-based thick-film OSC.107 Unlike the most commonly used electron-rich units, such as terthiophene, quaterthiophene and BDT, the 2D-NDT unit was employed because of its lower HOMO energy level and more expanded conjugate surface. By changing the substitution position of the alkyl chain on the thiophene bridge, an enhanced crystallinity, ordered molecule orientation and improved hole mobility were finally realized for PzNDTT-TPD1. The corresponding inverted device presented an optimal photovoltaic performance of 7.5% with an active layer thickness of 203 nm. This research also helped pave the way for subsequent thick-film OSC-related studies, which will be discussed in the upcoming sections. Yang's group also carried out research on BTI-based polymers. However, their main concern was the influence of molecular weight on the performance of the OSCs.108 They synthesized four batches of PBTIBDTT-S, a copolymer consisting of 2D-BDT and BTI units, with different molecular weights, and found that the polymer with the highest molecular weight of 38 KDa exhibited the optimal photovoltaic performance, owing to the enhanced hole mobility and crystallinity, suppressed charge recombination and finer fibrillar structures. More excitingly, the film thickness corresponding to an optimal performance of 10.11% is approximately 210 nm, which is obviously thicker than those of three other devices employing low-molecular-weight polymer donors.
In addition to TPD and BTI units, a tricyclic aromatic lactam unit, thieno[3,2-c]isoquinolin-5(4H)-one (TIQ), with strong electron-withdrawing capability and good planarity was also introduced into the construction of thick-film OSCs. Li et al. reported a TIQ-based polymer, PTIQ4TFBT, comprising of TIQ, FBT and bithiophene.109 PTIQ4TFBT:PC71BM-based OSC presented an optimized PCE of 10.16% with an active layer thickness of 267 nm. Moreover, a PCE of over 8% could still be achieved for an extremely thick film of approximately 508 nm.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units are commonly used to construct narrow bandgap and high-mobility semiconductors for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and OSCs, largely owing to their strong electron-withdrawing ability and large coplanar structure. Janssen's group reported a DPP-based polymer, DT-PDPP2T-TT, with an extremely narrow bandgap of 1.35 eV and a high hole mobility of 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is suitable for fabricating highly efficient thick-film OSCs.110 An optimal PCE of 6.9% with 70% FF was achieved for a 220 nm thick active layer. Not only the high charge mobility but also the nanomorphology composed of a fibrous interpenetrating structure played an important role (Fig. 13). Utilizing the same polymer (DT-PDPP2T-TT) as the donor (P2 for short), Choi et al. reported a highly efficient thick-film OSC with a remarkable PCE of 9.4% with an active layer thickness of 340 nm.111 This extremely high performance mainly resulted from the formation of a bicontinuous interpenetrating donor/acceptor network in both the lateral and vertical directions of the thick active layer through morphology engineering with the optimal additive (diphenyl ether). According to these two studies, it can be concluded that the choice of processing additive also plays a significant role in the construction of highly efficient thick-film OSCs. Compared with the thiophene-based DPP, the furan-substituted DPP (FDPP) unit has the advantages of lower costs, higher yield, and improved solubility, which can also be applied to develop low-bandgap donor materials for OSCs. Yang's group reported two new FDPP-based polymers incorporating different linear side chains on the FDPP units.112 One of the polymers with n-decyl side chains, PBDTTFDPP-C10, showed an enhanced structural order and higher carrier mobility, leading to an excellent photovoltaic performance of 6.9% with an active layer thickness of 200 nm.
The inherent characteristics of strong electron-deficient and high degree of co-planarity of isoindigo (IID) units have made IID-based polymers more attractive for highly efficient OSCs in recent years. For example, a high efficiency of 10.7% was successfully achieved based on P4TIF as the polymer donor and PC61BM as the acceptor.113 P4TIF has an extremely similar structure to BT and NT-based polymers (PBTff4T-2OD, PNTz4TF2 and P4TNTz-2F), composed of IID units and fluorine-substituted quaterthiophene. As another similarity, P4TIF can form an ideal morphology of interpenetrating networks with fine fibril-like structures in the active layer, resulting in an extremely high PCE even at a film thickness of 300 nm, making it one of the highest photovoltaic performances among PC61BM-based OSCs. In addition, there is also a noteworthy feature of IID-based polymers. It was suggested in Geng's previous study that introducing one fluorine atom in the IID unit can improve the solubility of the polymer in non-chlorinated solvents, mainly owing to the random distribution of fluorine atoms along the conjugated backbone.114 According to this strategy, they designed a single fluorine-substituted IID type polymer P(1FIID-BT), which displayed an extremely good solubility in o-xylene. The corresponding device delivered an optimal PCE of 7.46% with an active layer thickness of 270 nm, which was processed with non-chlorinated solvents (o-xylene), making it more responsive to the needs of environmental protection.


3.1.4 Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based polymers. 
Ester substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) unit was first reported by Yu's group.115 They have developed a series of D–A copolymers by employing BDT as the electron-rich unit and TT as the electron-deficient unit. The stabilized quinoidal structure and rigid backbone of TT enable most of these polymers to possess narrow bandgap and excellent hole mobility. Among them, PTB7 is certainly the most famous one, since PTB7:PC71BM-based device is the first OSC presenting a PCE over 7%.116 However, as reported by Marks' group, when the film thickness increased to nearly 300 nm, the PCE had fallen to 4.23%, which can be attributed to the drastically decreased FF caused by severe trap-assisted recombination.117 It is essential that creating a bicontinuous network with appropriate phase separation in blend film for exciton diffusion and charge transport, especially in thick-film OSCs. Fortunately, it has been proved that using proper solvent additives, such as o-chlorobenzaldehyde (CBA),13 and diphenyl ether (DPE)74 can effectively optimize the morphology of thick active layers. For example, Chen et al. used CBA as a new solvent additive instead of DIO with high boiling point, which could prevent the formation of large PC71BM domain aggregation and is conducive to the realization of good nanoscale phase separation in the thick film. Finally, an enhanced PCE of 8.24% for the 200 nm-thick device has been achieved.13
According to the photovoltaic performances of PTB7-based devices, it is pretty easy to find that the relatively high HOMO energy level is the obvious drawback for PTB7, resulting in the low VOC. As illustrated in previous work, the introduction of thienyl-substituted BDT (BDTT) is conducive to decrease the HOMO energy levels of the BDT-based copolymers without blue-shifting the absorption edge, compared with their corresponding alkoxy-substituted analogues. So, PTB7-Th, incorporating BDTT and TT units, was naturally developed.118 Interestingly, PTB7-Th also have the potential to be applied in the thick-film OSCs. For example, Zhang et al. demonstrated that after quickly removing the residual DIO in high vacuum condition after spin coating, an remarkable PCE of over 10% for PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based device has been achieved.119 In addition, they found that using single-component green solvent (2-methylanisole, MA) to process the active layer could also improve the thickness tolerance of active layer, thus delivering high PCEs of over 9% with thicknesses ranged from 100–270 nm. The further study revealed that timely removal of residual additive and adoption of MA can effectively prevent PC71BM evolving into large-area clusters, thus eliminating trapping centers and reducing carrier recombination for the thick active layer. What is more, Huang et al. reported an inverted off-centre spin-coating method that can improve vertical D:A composition gradient of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based BHJ.120 Such a gradient enhanced electron mobility while keeping adequate hole mobility for the thick BHJ film. In consequence, the corresponding device displayed a significantly improved device performance of 10.95% and a high FF of 70% with over 215 nm-thick active layer. These contributions suggest that for a specific material system, in order to achieve its full potential under the state of thick-film, effective regulation of the nano-morphology is imperative and above-mentioned techniques are really worthwhile to make references for seeking a more appropriate way.

3.2. Representative material systems for non-fullerene-type thick-film OSCs
Although fullerene-based thick-film OSCs have achieved success in academic laboratories, it is relatively difficult to realize large-scale modules due to their intrinsic drawbacks, such as high cost, limited optical and electronic adjustability, and poor morphological stability.121,122 The non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) would facilitate the large-scale implementation of opaque and semi-transparent OSCs123,124 because of their synthetic flexibility, easily tuneable photoelectric property, and high efficiency.76,125–128 However, compared with fullerenes which possess high mobility and isotropic characteristics, NFAs often show lower electronic mobility and anisotropic charge transport, resulting in the increased bimolecular recombination in thick-film devices. Therefore, it is both urgent and challenging to obtain high performance NFAs with high mobility and optimal morphology for highly efficient charge transport in thick-film OSCs. In the following section, the NFA-based material systems that can realize high performance for thick-film OSCs will be summarized.

3.2.1 Electron-rich-core-based NFAs and matched polymer donors. 
NFAs with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have attracted much attention, because their molecular energy levels and absorption spectra can be effectively tuned by manipulating aromatic cores, terminal functional groups and side chains. Up to now, ladder-type indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) have been widely used as the central core to design high-performance NFAs.122,129 Among them, ITIC and IDIC have become the representative NFAs. By incorporating electron-rich groups like methyl or electron-deficient elements like fluorine atom into the end-capping group (2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile, INCN for short), the optical absorption properties and energy levels of ITIC derivatives, such as IT-M, ITIC-(2)F, IT-4F, can be effectively tuned.76,130,131 Combining with wide bandgap copolymers, these blend films show complementary absorption and matched energy levels, which provide great potential to achieve remarkable photovoltaic performances. Fan et al. reported a wide-bandgap polymer PTzBI, which consists of imide-functionalized unit TzBI and moderate electron-donating unit BDT. When blended with ITIC, the PTzBI:ITIC-based device showed flat surface morphology and slender fibril network, delivering a PCE of 7.09% with active layer thickness of 300 nm.52 Another wide-bandgap D–A copolymer PFBZ showed low HOMO level of −5.36 eV and strong intermolecular aggregation. The blend films of PFBZ:ITIC showed the obvious phase separation with appropriate domain sizes and high pure domains, which are beneficial to obtain high JSC and FF. Then a PCE of 8.9% was achieved with a thickness of 200 nm.122 Compared with ITIC, IT-M exhibited a higher LUMO energy level. After thermal annealing, PBDB-T:IT-M-based thick film device (∼250 nm) afforded an impressive PCE of 9.37%, due to the efficient charge transport and ordered packing by thermal annealing.76 ITIC-(2)F and IT-4F can be synthesized by attaching fluorine atoms with strong electronegativity to the terminal groups of ITIC. By eliminating steric hindrance and increasing non-covalent interactions between F and H/C/S, fluorinated ITICs show improved crystallinity, deep energy levels and red-shifted absorption. As-cast OSCs with a new combination of ITIC-(2)F and PBTIBDTT maintain over 9% PCEs as thickness increases to 350 nm and deliver PCE of 8.6% with active area of 3.48 cm2.130,132 Halogenation of conjugated side chains of polymer is also beneficial to enhance crystallinity and lower energy levels. Compared to the counterparts of PBDB-T, PM6 (PBDB-T-2F) and PM7 (PBDB-T-2Cl) show lower HOMO energy level, higher absorption coefficient, enhanced crystallinity and higher carrier mobility. When blended with same acceptor (IT-4F), PM6 exhibited a high PCE of 12.2% with the thickness of 285 nm,131 while PM7 showed a slight decrease in JSC and PCE.50
In comparison with terminal functional groups manipulation, “side-chain engineering” strategy133–135 can remarkably affect intermolecular interaction. For example, by isomerizing the ITIC molecular structure with the substituent of meta-alkyl-phenyl, the resulting new NFA, m-ITIC shows a higher absorption coefficient, stronger crystalline and higher electron mobility. For the J61:m-ITIC blend film, the balanced hole/electron mobilities and reduced charge recombination can account for the high FF and the thickness-insensitive behaviour in the range of 100–300 nm.136 As a result, the PCEs of devices are over 8.5% with a thickness of 250 nm and maintain over 8% until the thickness increased to 360 nm. It is well known that, the film morphology is related to the matching degree of the surface energy between the donors and acceptors. Lee et al. replaced the alkyl chains on the meta-phenyl groups with branched alkoxy chains to develop a new NFA (m-ITIC-O-EH) with surface energy similar to that of the donor polymer (PBDB-T), leading to the bicontinuous network structure without strong aggregation and then efficient charge transport.137 The morphology change depending on the thickness of photoactive layers is illustrated in Fig. 16. Thus, the thickness-insensitive OSCs can be achieved even using a doctor blade technique under the air. Previous studies have shown that replacing phenyl groups attached on central core with alkyl side chains facilitates π–π stacking and endows NFA with higher electron mobility. In combination with the synergistic effect of functional groups, such as methyl and fluorine atoms, the small molecule MF2 synthesized by Gao et al.51 showed ordered π–π stacking and suitable domain size after blending with PM7. The device based on PM7:MF2 delivered over 11% PCEs at the active layer thickness over 400 nm. In addition to the adjustments of side chains and terminal groups, narrow bandgap molecule acceptors can also be obtained by optimizing the central core. While designing selenium substituted analogue is simply an effective strategy, since selenium-substituted heterocycles possess more quinoidal character and enhanced planarity, facilitating the realization of the narrower optical bandgap.138 Wang et al. replaced thiophene of central core with lower aromatic selenophene to increase the planarity of structures and lower optical bandgap.70 Integrating the chlorinated terminal units, SeTIC4Cl showed small optical bandgap of 1.44 eV and improved crystallinity with high electron mobility. Therefore, PM6:SeTIC4Cl blend film exhibited significant PCEs over 11% even with the thickness of 300 nm.
Another type of acceptors, widely used in the construction of high-performance NFA OSCs, are IDIC and its derivatives with low HOMO energy levels. PM6/IDIC-based thick-film PSC afforded a high PCE of 11.3% with the thickness of 255 nm.129 Noted that, the ΔEHOMO of PM6:IDIC is only 0.15 eV, helping to realize the higher VOC and reduce the energy loss. Luo et al. synthesized IDIC-derived small molecular IDTPC with thiophene-fused ending group, which exhibited high electron mobility of 8.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and compact molecular packing.139 The combination of IDTPC and a wide bandgap polymer (PTQ10) is insensitive to the active layer thickness ranging from 70 to 505 nm, and gives a PCE of 10% at the thickness of 400 nm. Small molecular acceptor MF1 was synthesized by extending alkyl chains and fusing functional end group INCN with fluorine and methyl moieties, which processes small optical bandgap of 1.54 eV, compact π–π stacking with small d-spacing of 3.32 Å and high electron mobility of 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.51 Due to the excellent mobilities and minor bimolecular recombination, the PM7:MF1-based device exhibited high FF of 70% and over 11% with the thickness of over 400 nm. Considering π–π interactions are mainly formed by the end-capping units of acceptors with polymer donor or/and adjacent acceptors in blend film, a new NFA (IDTN) was synthesized by extending the conjugate area of end-group, which displayed strong molecular aggregation and high electron mobility.49 Using PM6 as the donor, the corresponding device exhibited a high FF of 78%, suggesting the minimized charge recombination in the blend film. Finally, PCEs of over 10% can be achieved for the film thickness ranging from 70 to 300 nm. When inserting alkoxyl-thiophenes between IDT core and fluorinated INCN, a newly designed NFA, IEICO-4F, has been developed, exhibiting a red-shifted absorption onset of approximately 1000 nm and an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.24 eV.140 Using abovementioned BT-based polymer, PFBT4T-C5Si-25% (Si25), as the donor, the blend film of Si25/IEICO-4F exhibited an outstanding FF of over 70% and a high PCE of 13.2% with 320 nm thick active layer, which can be attributed to the balanced hole and electron transport, higher order of face-on orientation as well as the complementary absorption.
In addition to IDTT and IDT, some other fused-ring cores can also be used to construct thick-film OSCs. Zhang et al. synthesized a new NFA (F-2Cl) by chlorinating the end-group INCN of FDICTF.141 Compared with FDICTF, F-2Cl showed red-shifted absorptions, increased crystallinity and higher electron mobility. After blending with PM6, the F-2Cl-based devices still maintain over 10% PCEs when the film thickness is 600 nm. Compared to bridged dithiophene, amino groups display stronger electron-donating ability and good processability. Based on this, a new central building block, INP, was designed and synthesized. The corresponding NFA (m-INPOIC) with the substituent of meta-alkoxyl-phenyl presents high solubility and predominant face-on orientation, which is beneficial for promoting charge transport.37 The as-cast device exhibited a PCE of over 10% with the film thickness around 250 nm.
In order to improve the solubility of NFAs and avoid large phase separation usually caused by high crystallinity of NFAs and poor miscibility between donor and NFA, asymmetric side chains, integrating alkyl and alkylaryl groups, combined with central core can reduce the crystalline tendency of molecules, which will prevent acceptors to form large aggregations. In addition, the acceptors with asymmetric chains can form closer contact in a dislocated way to facilitate electron transportation. Feng et al. synthesized an asymmetric small molecular acceptor based on IDTT unit, named IDTT-OB.142 As expected, blended with PBDB-T, the active layer exhibited ideal nanoscale phase separation with appropriate domain size, beneficial for the exciton diffusion and charge separation. And the corresponding device delivered a PCE of 10.2% at the 250 nm thick film. Small molecule acceptors based on asymmetric central core can also be used to construct thick-film OSCs. TTPTTT-4F based on an eight-membered IDT unit were designed.143 In comparison with symmetric IIDT units, the new core possesses more rigidified coplanar structure, which is beneficial for π-electron delocalization, and stronger electron donating ability. Blended with PT2, which can self-assemble into fibril nanostructure, TTPTTT-based thick-film device still exhibited ∼10% PCEs even with the film thickness increased to 500 nm.


3.2.2 Electron-deficient-core-based NFAs and matched polymer donors. 
The emergence of Y6 arouses new breakthroughs in the design of NFAs.8,144 The structural design of Y6 mainly includes the following two directions: (1) BT unit as the central core; Due to the SP2-hybridized nitrogen atoms endow strong electron-withdrawing character, BT is often used to construct narrow bandgap materials with high mobility. (2) Ladder-type multi-fused ring containing pyrrole ring and BT unit; the fused TPBT central unit retains conjugation along the molecular length, which allows the change of electron affinity. The presence of alkyl chains onto nitrogen atoms not only improves the solubility, but also affects the intermolecular interactions. The combination of strong crystallized acceptor Y6, which possesses narrow bandgap of 1.33 eV and high electron mobility, and medium bandgap polymer PM6 with weak π–π stacking, exhibited a suitable nano-fibrillar structure and beneficial phase separation between PM6 and Y6 in the blend, which can be confirmed by AFM at μm to 10 nm length scale and solid-state-NMR on a nm to sub-nm scale, respectively.8,145,146 Then a high PCE of 14.3% was obtained at the thickness of 200 nm. When blended Y6 with PBDB-T-2Cl, which possesses lower HOMO energy level than that of PM6, the 300 nm-thick device showed slightly decreased PCE of 12.3%.147 Chlorination of the accepter terminal could induce large intramolecular dipole moment and strong electroluminescence efficiency. Therefore, the PBDB-TF:BTP-4Cl-based blend film has efficient charge mobilities and low trap-state density, and thus a promising PCE of 12.1% can be obtained at 1000 nm-thick film.38 Furthermore, the PCE can reach 10.1% with a 1000 nm thick device and active area of 4 cm2, which shows great potential in the future large-scale production. Combining the alkyl chain modification and chlorination on acceptor terminal, a high performance NFA, BTP4Cl-12, containing 2-butyloctyl alkyl chain on the pyrrole ring was obtained by Cui et al. As the active layer thickness increased from 80 to 300 nm, all the PBDB-TF:BTP4Cl-12-based devices maintain over 15% PCEs, which is beneficial to the fabrication of large-area modules.

3.3. All-small-molecule systems for thick-film OSCs
Compared with polymers, small molecules also have significant application potential in OSCs owing to their unique advantages, such as well-defined molecular structures, easy purification and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility. However, morphology regulation involving all small molecules is an extremely challenging task, largely because these small molecular semiconductors are often easily crystallized in the film-forming process, thereby limiting their scope for thick-film OSCs. Even so, there have been a series of material systems that exhibit excellent photovoltaic performances with thick active layer. The corresponding chemical structures are presented in Fig. 19, and the detailed photovoltaic performances with optimal film thickness are listed in Table 6.

The BDT unit plays an important role in the construction of high-efficiency small molecule donors. Chen's group reported a series of BDT-based molecules, among which DR3TSBDT was shown to be outstanding, with a high PCE of 9.95% coupled with PC71BM at an active layer thickness of 120 nm.148 Increasing the film thickness to 280 nm, a high PCE of 9.15% can be well maintained, which is mainly attributed to the nearly ideal morphology and unchanged hole mobility over the wide thickness range. In contrast to the dialkylthiol-substituted BDT used in DR3TSBDT, two-dimensional (2D) conjugated BDT with alkylthio-thienyl side chains was introduced to Cui's study on obtaining a special small molecule donor, which can present the optimal performance without extra treatments in the preparation of OSCs.149 The performance of the designed small molecule, BDTT-S-TR, went far beyond their expectation, not only because a maximum PCE of 9.20% was successfully achieved for the BDTT-S-TR:PC71BM-based device without extra treatments of the active layer, but also because the thick-film device can still afford a relatively high PCE (8.09% PCE for the 200 nm active layer). Sun et al. also reported a BDT-based small molecule donor, BTR, which consists of a 2D-BDT unit, two terthiophenes and two rhodanine groups.77 Compared with the analogous structures mentioned above, the side chains of BTR are shortened and positioned at the terthiophene building blocks in a regioregular manner. Moreover, there is an additional hexyl chain on the thienyl-BDT unit, allowing BTR to show excellent solubility and a nematic liquid crystal behaviour. The strong intermolecular interaction of BTR ensures a high hole mobility of 0.1 and 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as recorded by FET and SCLC methods respectively. Thus, BTR:PC71BM-based devices afforded a high PCE of 9.3% and an outstanding FF of 77% with an active layer thickness of 250 nm. Tang et al. delicately tuned the morphology of a BTR:PC71BM-based film using a simple concentration-induced morphology manipulation approach.150 Specifically, the morphology is delicately controlled by subtly changing the concentration of the solution. When the concentration of BTR/PC71BM blended solution increased from 40 to 44 mg mL−1, the optimal morphology for charge separation and transport was achieved, and a PCE of 10.2% was successfully obtained with a film thickness of 300 nm. As illustrated in the previous discussion on NDT-based thick-film OSC, NDT is a very promising candidate unit for constructing highly efficient donor materials, which can also deliver a superior performance even with thick films. Based on this feature of NDT, we successfully developed an NDT-based all-small-molecule type thick-film OSC.151 In contrast to our previous modulating strategy, two conjugated side chains (alkylphenyl and alkylthienyl) were introduced to the central NDT, to investigate the effectiveness of the molecule structure-optimizing on the modification of intermolecular interactions and active layer morphology. Consequently, the alkylphenyl-substituted NDT-based small molecule, NDTP-CNCOO, exhibited a highly ordered structure, excellent charge transport properties and proper scale phase separation after blending with PC71BM. The corresponding device presented an optimal PCE of 7.2% and an FF of 71.1% with an active layer thickness of 300 nm. In particular, as the thickness increased from 200 to 300 nm, the FFs all remained above 70%.
 Fig. 19  The chemical structures of donor materials for all-small-molecule thick-film OSCs. 
For acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecules, it is difficult to modulate the molecular orientation owing to the intrinsic anisotropy. In view of most nonfullerene acceptors adopting a face-on orientation, it is crucial to obtain proper donor materials with a face-on orientation, which can promote the hole mobility for a more balanced charge transport. Hou's group synthesized a group of small molecule donors, named DRTB-T-CX (where X represents the carbon atom number of alkyl groups).152 Excitingly, the transition of the molecular orientation from edge-on to face-on was finally realized by adjusting the length of the end alkyl chain. When blending these donors with IT-4F, the DRTB-T-C4/IT-4F-based device showed the highest performance among the four types of thin-film OSCs, mainly because of the high ratio of face-on and edge-on for C4 as well as the highest and most balanced hole and electron mobility. Remarkably, this system still offered a high PCE of 10.18% with an active layer thickness of up to 300 nm (Fig. 20). Recently, Li's group investigated the effects of side chain engineering and thermal annealing for fine-tuning the active layer morphology of all-small-molecule OSCs. Among the three 2D conjugated BDT-based small molecules, SM1-F (with fluorine and alkyl substituents on BDT) based NFA (Y6 as acceptor) type OSCs exhibited the best PCE value of 14.07% and a favourable PCE of 11.9% even when the thickness reached 250 nm.153 This study suggests that, in order to gain the ideal morphology for all-small-molecule systems, the influence of molecular structure on the crystallinity characteristics and of the extra treatment on the phase separation merit further attention.

3.4. All-polymer systems for thick-film OSCs
Compared with polymer donor/small molecule acceptor system and all-small-molecule system, all-polymer system has excellent processing features and good morphological/thermal stability, more aligned with the requirements of large-scale production and commercial applications.154 Therefore, as an important branch of OSCs, it has also been the focus of academic and industrial concern. While in recent years, thanks to the development of new polymer acceptors, the photovoltaic performances of all-polymer solar cells have also been significantly improved.155
For a long time, N2200 has been one of the most commendable N-type polymers in the field of organic electronics, largely due to its wide range of applications, such as organic field-effect transistor, organic photovoltage, organic photodetector, and so on. And most of all-polymer OSCs are based on this classical material. Considering that the absorption peaks of N2200 are mainly concentrated in the range of 340–420 nm and 600–800 nm, designing polymer donors with medium bandgaps to form complementary absorption with N2200 seems more attractive for the enhanced light-harvesting ability. Li's group has developed a series of such medium bandgap polymer donors, consisting of BDT and FBTA units, to match narrow bandgap acceptors, such as N2200 or NFAs. Among them, J51 displayed matching energy levels and complementary absorption when coupling with N2200.156 A record high PCE of 8.27% with a high FF of 70.24% has been achieved for J51:N2200-based all-polymer solar cell at the time. As the film thickness increased to 210 nm, a moderate PCE around 6% could still be obtained. Another typical polymer donor was reported by Huang's group, which is composed of BDT as the electron-rich unit and pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7-dione (TzBI) as the electron-deficient unit. When paired with N2200, the corresponding all-polymer solar cells exhibited an extremely high PCE of 9.16%.157 It is worth noting that such an optimized result was obtained by using 2-methyl-tetrafuran (MeTHF), an environmentally friendly solvent, as the processing solvent. Then, an alkyl side chain terminated with 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane was introduced into the TzBI unit to increase the solubility of the polymer donor in MeTHF. The siloxane-functionalized substituent played a significant role in the formation of the preferential face-on orientation for polymer donor (PTzBI-Si) and optimal morphology for the blend film. Benefitting from these favourable features, the PTzBI-Si:N2200-based device delivered an unprecedented photovoltaic performance of 10.1%.158 When changing the processing solvent from MeTHF to cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME, also a green solvent), a remarkably high PCE of 11.0% was successfully obtained, because of the fine-tuned microstructure morphology as well as the enhanced molecular co-facial packing.159 More importantly, the PCE could remain at 9.3% even with the film thickness increased to 350 nm. Recently, based on the PTzBI-Si:N2200 system, Huang's group has constructed a ternary all-polymer solar cell by selecting an analogue of PTzBI-Si (PBTA-Si) as the third component.160 With the processing of the green solvent (MeTHF) and a non-halogenic additive (dibenzylether, DBE), the micro-morphology has been delicately optimized, inherently suppressing charge recombination, especially for the thick blend film. As a result, the small area (0.05 cm2) device displayed an impressively high PCE of 10.4% with a 380 nm thick-film. More excitingly, the PCE of the large-area (1 cm2) device could be maintained 10.0% with the film thickness of 350 nm. These contributions fully demonstrate the advantages of green solvents in the preparation of high-efficiency all-polymer solar cells and the great potential of all-polymer solar cells for future large-scale application.
Although N2200 demonstrates its excellent performances in the all-polymer systems, there are still some defects such as weak absorption coefficient, strong crystallinity, low LUMO energy level and so on, which severely limit the performance improvements of this type of photovoltaic system. So, a series of new polymer acceptors, such as B ← N-bridged bipyridine-based polymer,161,162 bithiophene imide-based polymer,163 and cyano substituted BTz-based polymer164 have come into existence. Among them, a new kind of polymer acceptor reported by Li's group has presented remarkable advantages of strong absorption coefficient, high electron mobility, facilitating the performance enhancements of the all-polymer solar cells.165 The design concept of this type of material is very ingenious, which incorporates the segment of the high performance NFA (e.g. IDIC) as the building block to construct novel polymer acceptor. Recently, Huang's group introduced the main structure of Y6 into the construction of this kind of acceptor polymer, thus obtaining a narrow bandgap material, PJ1, with strong absorption coefficient, high-lying LUMO energy level.166 When selecting PBDB-T as the donor material, the corresponding all-polymer solar cell showed an outstanding PCE of 14.4%. More valuably, when the film thickness is increased to 305 nm, the device still delivered an extremely high PCE of 12.1%. These efforts have greatly made up the efficiency gap between all-polymer solar cells and other types of OSCs, and further promoted the rapid development of OSCs towards practical applications (Fig. 21 ) (Table 7).

3.5. Ternary systems for thick-film OSCs
In addition to design new materials to improve the performance of thick-film OSCs, ternary OSCs, consisting of two donors blended with one acceptor (2D/1A) or one donor blended with two acceptors (1D/2A), have exhibited great promise in achieving high performance (Fig. 23) (Table 8). However, most of the highly efficient ternary OSCs delivered the optimal performances with active layer thickness around 100 nm, resulting from increased charge recombination and depression of charge mobility caused by the unfavourable morphology. Therefore, an ideal morphology obtained by matching appropriate materials and treatments to maximize charge generation, transport and extraction and reduce the loss channels of different origins, is the key to improve the efficiency of ternary thick-film OSCs.

3.5.1 Two donors/one acceptor-type ternary thick-film OSCs. 
In the early studies, researches mainly focused on introducing the third component into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system to achieve highly efficient thick-film ternary OSC. The widely studied PTB7-Th and PC71BM were chosen as the host system due to the high efficiency and excellent reproducibility. In our early studies, it was found that small molecule p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 could form alloy with PTB7-Th without changing the phase separation size.167 Adding p-DTS(FBTTH2)2 into PTB7-Th:PC71BM system can enhance domain purity and increase crystalline domain size, resulting in efficient charge transport and reduced charge recombination (Fig. 22). Thus, the ternary OSC with 270 nm thickness exhibited a PCE of 10.78%, and the PCE based on PET/Silver substrate is 8.28% with an area of 1.25 cm2. By changing the miscibility between different components, the morphology of the active layer can also be controlled effectively. The good miscibility between small molecule DRCN5T and PTB7-Th can induce the crystallization of PTB7-Th and the formation of nano-fibrillar structure, while poor miscibility between DRCN5T and PC71BM enabled PC71BM to separate from PTB7-Th phase, forming a vertical phase distribution conducive to charge transport.168 Compared with binary systems, the ternary device displayed a high PCE of 11.1% whose blend film thickness is 270 nm. Introducing a liquid crystalline small molecule BTR into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM can broaden the absorption, induce the arrangement and crystallization of PTB7-Th and decrease the π–π stacking distance with enlarged the coherence length and charge transport.169 The excitons generated on BTR have two possible pathways to generate charges result from the efficient energy transfer occurring from BTR to PTB7-Th. With an inverted device structure, the optimized PCE was improved from 7.07% (binary system) to 11.4% (ternary system) under the same thickness of 250 nm. The high FF of 70% means that in the case of a high charge mobility system with enhanced domain purity, the bimolecular recombination is largely reduced. In polymer:small molecule:fullerene OSCs (such as PTB7-Th:DIBC:PC71BM-based ternary system), the “molecular lock” derived from the hydrogen bond interaction with PC71BM via N–H⋯OC can effectively modulate the domain sizes and suppress the excessive aggregation of fullerene.170 Further, the efficient energy transfer from DIBC to PTB7-Th can accelerate charge transport. As a result, a PCE of 10.78% was successfully obtained at the thickness of 280 nm. In addition, the Förster resonance energy transfer between the two donor polymers also allows for efficient device performance. Gasparini et al. found that, under a small energy difference between the HOMO levels of the two polymers, holes can be easily transferred between them.171 The combination of two polymers PBTZT-STAT-BDTT-8 and PTB7-Th not only broadens the absorption spectrum, but also allows the fabrication of high-performance OSCs with effective hole transfer from PTB7-th to PBTZT-STAT-BDTT-8. A PCE beyond 11% was achieved in thick ternary OSC with active layer thickness of 260 nm. Compared with PTB7-Th, FBT and NT based polymers exhibited high crystallinity with limited solubility in common organic solvent at room temperature. Considering the commercial requirements for mass production of solar cells in the future, moderate preparation conditions and device efficiency reproducibility are necessary. When the third component BTR was added into PNTT:PC71BM films, high performances of thick-film devices were obtained with room processing temperature.54 The incorporation of BTR into binary systems can decrease the polymer aggregation intensity and improve the phase separation of blend films, thus increasing mobility of ternary OSCs. Eventually, the PCEs of 11.44% were obtained with active layer thickness ∼300 nm, very suitable for the future roll-to-roll production.

3.5.2 One donor/two acceptors-type ternary thick-film OSCs. 
So far, there are few reports on efficient ternary thick OSCs with NFAs, mainly because the limited electron mobility, anisotropic charge transporting property and unclear aggregation behaviours of NFAs. By selecting polymer PDOT with high mobility and strong π–π stacking as donor and combining the multi-acceptors of PC71BM and ITIC, a thick-film ternary OSC with a high PCE of 11% was achieved.172 The addition of ITIC not only broadens the absorption spectrum, but also realizes the effective charge transport through different aggregation behaviours between the two acceptors. Weng et al. constructed a high-performance thick OSCs using a donor polymer PT2 that can self-assemble into fibril nanostructure and two small molecular acceptors (TTPTTT-4F:IDIC) with different crystallinity.143 It is well known that polymer fibril can provide a high-speed channel for hole transport, and small molecule acceptors interspersed in the fibril network can form electron transport channel. Therefore, the ternary OSCs displayed high PCEs of round 12% with wide toleration of active layer thickness (from 100 nm to 500 nm). For the highly efficient PBDB-T-2Cl:BTP-4F system, incorporating fullerene with high mobility could improve nanoscale phase separation with appropriate domain size and balance hole and electron mobilities, leading to efficient charge generation and transport.147 As a result, excellent PCE of 14.3% were realized in the 300 nm-thick ternary OSCs. By introducing the other NFA (MF1) into the similar binary system (PBDB-T-2Cl:BP-4F), the performance of ternary thick OSCs can be improved to 14.57%.173 It was found that the third component MF1 with preferred face-on orientation and high energy levels can form alloy acceptor with BP-4F, which is conductive to improve the exciton utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the slightly evolving phase separation degree is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in high FF of 71.62% with 300 nm active layer. Another newly designed NFA, BTP-M, can also form acceptor alloy with Y6, when introduced into the ternary system (PM6:Y6:BTP-M).53 The alloy state is conducive to optimize the film morphology and reduce energy loss, leading to a high PCE of 15.15% together with an enhanced JSC of 26.64 mA cm−2 for ternary thick OSCs with active layer thickness of 200 nm.


3.5.3 All-small-molecule-type ternary thick-film OSCs. 
As mentioned above, the difficulties of controlling the morphology of the active layer (such as crystallinity and domain size) limited the development of binary all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs, and this challenge also existed in the construction of ternary ASM OSCs. While Liang et al. introduced PC71BM into DR3:ICC6 system, the finely mixed morphology was finally achieved.174 The corresponding ternary OSC exhibited a PCE of 10.8% with active layer thickness >200 nm. The significantly improved mobilities and long carrier lifetimes also played a significant role. As mentioned above, BTR:PC71BM-based OSC is an outstanding all-small-molecule system. Introducing BTR-OH, with similar structure but less crystallinity relative to BTR, into the binary system can effectively weaken phase segregation and suppress charge recombination, leading to a high PCE of 10.14% and FF of 74.2% for ternary system with film thickness of ∼300 nm.175 Zhu's group established a highly efficient all-small-molecule ternary system by introducing NITI to the BTR:PC71BM blend film.55 NITI played an important role in the photoelectric conversion process. On the one hand, it suppressed the contact between BTR and PC71BM, so that the ternary device can obtain almost the same VOC as the binary device (BTR:NITI). On the other hand, PC71BM forms an electron-transport highway in the active layer which can effectively transport electrons separated from NITI to the electrode, thus ensuring high JSC and FF at the same time. This hierarchical morphology takes advantage of both fullerene and non-fullerene receptors. Eventually, a high efficiency of 13.63% was achieved even with thick active layer of 300 nm.

4. Summary and perspective
In this review, we investigated many organic semiconductor material systems that allow for highly efficient thick-film OSCs, and attempted to elucidate the relationship among the chemical structure, active layer morphology and performance of thick-film OSCs. It can be concluded that the molecular structures with a strong charge carrier mobility and nanoscale morphology with bicontinuous interpenetrating network features are vitally important for the construction of highly efficient thick-film OSCs. Although the performance of thick-film OSCs is improving steadily and a remarkable PCE of over 16% has been achieved at an active layer thickness of 200 nm, some challenges in the preparation of thick-film devices are worthy of special attention.
(a) Simplified process
In many highly efficient photovoltaic systems, extra treatments, such as solvent additive processing and thermal/solvent annealing, are often used to fine-tune the active layer morphology in order to obtain a nanoscale phase separation and high domain purity. These complex treatments will increase the fabrication costs and reduce the reproducibility of the devices. Thus far, only a few material systems can provide high efficiencies without additional treatments for thick-film OSCs. Because their optimized nanoscale morphologies only need to be realized using spin- or blade-coating, additional treatments may deteriorate the favourable morphology. However, owing to acute lack of success, particularly for thick-film OSCs, the relationship between the molecule structures and extra treatment-free features still need in-depth studies on this attractive research area.
(b) Low-cost materials
Introducing a polymer or small molecule as the third component into the binary system can also regulate the aggregation behaviour of the molecules, improving the molecular ordered stacking and domain purity of the blend film, which can play a similar role in optimizing the active layer morphology, such as the thermal processing or extra treatments mentioned above. However, considering the complexity of the materials synthesis and the sensitivity of the device performance to the incorporation ratio of the third component, the processing cost and instability of large-scale industrial manufacturing will be undoubtedly further increased. More importantly, the synthetic routes of highly efficient materials (PM6 and Y6, for instance) are generally more complicated, resulting in extremely high production costs. Although a type of polymer donor with a simple structure and decent thick-film performance, such as PTQ10, has been successfully developed, there is still a long way toward realizing the true potential of commercial application of OSCs.
(c) Green solvent fabrication
Moreover, the overwhelming majority of highly efficient thick-film OSCs reported thus far was fabricated using toxic organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, which are all harmful to the environment and human beings. Although researchers have recognized the urgency of the adoption of eco-friendly solvents, OSCs processed by non-halogenated solvents often display decreased PCEs even at a thin active layer thickness. There are two main reasons accounting for this. One is that most of the photoactive materials possess poor solubility in non-halogenated solvents, resulting in large-scale phase separation. Second, the molecular orientation and domain purity are difficult to control in non-halogenated solvents. Although, it is a big challenge to regulate the active layer morphology with a non-halogenated solvent, truly environmentally friendly OSCs are expected to be developed by adjusting the molecular structures.
These challenges point to the future research in this field. We believe that developing low-cost photoactive material systems that are able to demonstrate the optimal photovoltaic performance with a thick active layer without extra treatments or toxic-solvent-processing is the key to the commercialization of OSCs in the future. We hope that readers will gain useful insights into the progress of the material systems, morphology regulation, and future development of thick-film OSCs through this review. Although there is still a lot of work to be done in the future, we believe that the practical applications of thick-film OSCs will certainly be accelerated by virtue of the emergence of new material systems and the optimization of preparation technology.
