These affluent sources are appropriate for producing a large number of SnO2 nanoparticles, sufficient for stacking on a substrate surface by gravity, which then acts as a seed layer for subsequent nanorod growth. Single crystalline nanorods are grown along the [001] direction by the oriented attachment phenomenon in which the attached nanoparticles were rearranged to reduce the overall surface energy through sharing thermodynamically unstable crystal (001) planes. Furthermore, the grown SnO2 NRs are covered with a TiO2 particulate film and utilized as a photoanode in DSSCs. The power conversion efficiency is 8.61%, enhanced by 14.2% compared to the photoanode with only a TiO2 particulate film.1 IntroductionVarious metal oxides (i.e., TiO2, ZnO, In2O3, Ga2O3, CdO, PbO2) have drawn increasing attention due to their possession of specific functionalities and potential for morphological transformations, including one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures.1 Among them, tin oxide (SnO2) has excellent optical and electrical properties, chemical stability,2 a wide band gap (Eg = 3.62 eV) and versatile morphological transformations. With these merits, it has been extensively utilized in many areas, including optoelectronic devices,3 anode materials for lithium batteries,4 and sensors for detecting of pollution and combustible gases.5Several SnO2 nanostructures have been synthesized using methods such as the self-catalytic vapour–liquid–solid (VLS) method,3 calcination process,4 chemical vapour deposition (CVD),6 thermal evaporation,1 laser ablation technique,7 solvothermal,8 carbothermal reduction9 and hydrothermal method.10–19 However, other than the hydrothermal method, most methods require a high reaction temperature (≥900 °C), which makes real applications difficult. Gupta et al. grew SnO2 nanowires on various substrates via the VLS method with the aid of gold catalytic spots at a temperature of above 700 °C for 30 min.20 Single crystalline nanowires were grown on rutile TiO2 substrates with (100) and (110) orientation, which have a low lattice mismatch of around 3%. But poly-crystalline nanowires were generated on a silicon oxide substrate.The hydrothermal method can also synthesize numerous SnO2 nanostructures in an autoclave; nanoparticles,11,12 nanorods,13–15 hollow microshperes,16 nanodendrites,17 nanodisks18 and nanoribbons19 have been synthesized at a low temperature. Lupan et al. obtained SnO2 nanorods at 95 °C in a SnCl4 aqueous nutrient solution that was composed of tin salts and alkali hydroxides such as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH).21 However, sparse nanorods were located laterally on a silicon substrate after synthesis because the nutrient solution was not supersaturated with the tin sources; these Sn2+ ions were normally engaged with the chlorine ions or the hydroxyl ions during the hydrothermal reaction, resulting in a slow nucleation and growth.The most commonly used tin salts are tin dichloride (SnCl2) and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4), which are well known Lewis acids. As the reaction proceeds, hydrochloric acid (HCl) is formed as a by-product in the aqueous nutrient solution, rendering it more acidic as the reaction goes on. Therefore, it is difficult to collect the produced SnO2 nanostructures from the nutrient solution using a common freeze-drying method because the evaporation of HCl gas during drying can lead to contamination of other tubes and corrosion in the system.Considering the challenges mentioned above, a neutral tin- and chloride-free precursor solution that can provide supersaturated tin sources is required. Tin oxalate, Sn(C2O4), forms via an electrostatic attraction between the pure metal ion (Sn2+) and the organic chelating reagent (C2O42−), which has a weak attractive force compared with other covalent, ionic and hydrogen bonds. Therefore, Sn(C2O4) can be dissociated easily at a low temperature, providing plentiful tin sources that favour nucleation and growth. Another advantage of Sn(C2O4) is that there is no need for an additional hydroxyl provider (alkali hydroxide) because the free tin sources (Sn2+) are liable to attract the hydroxyl group from the aqueous solution. Comparatively, the tin chloride solution requires a strong hydroxyl provider that could break the Sn–Cl bonds and replace the chlorine ions.In this research, a new nutrient solution composed of Sn(C2O4) is first introduced to grow the dense SnO2 nanorods (NRs) on various substrates, taking the merits mentioned above into account. The growth mechanism of SnO2 NRs is investigated in the aspect of oriented attachment growth.22 Finally, the grown SnO2 NRs are embedded within a TiO2 particulate film and utilized as a photoanode in DSSCs, showing improved photovoltaic properties.2 Experimental2.1 Synthesis of SnO2 nanorodsTin oxalate powder (Sn(C2O4), M = 206.73 g mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, C6H12N4, M = 99.17 g mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and dissolved in 500 ml deionized (DI) water at a concentration of 0.025 M (molar ratio: 1:1, milky colour). Substrates (Si, SiO2, FTO glass) were sequentially cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and DI water in an ultrasonic bath before being dipped into the 500 ml nutrient solution in a beaker covered with an aluminium foil. The growth took place inside a common laboratory oven at 95 °C for 3 h. After completing the growth reaction, the laboratory oven was gradually cooled down to room temperature, and the sample was then sufficiently washed under flowing DI water. The nanorods did not come off the substrate during the cleaning process. A sintering step at 400 °C for 1 h (heating rate of 10 °C min−1) was then performed to align the imperfect lattice orientation.2.2 Characterization of propertiesThe SnO2 nanostructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FE-SEM (JEOL 2010 F) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα X-ray radiation (40 kV, 100 mA, Rigaku D/max-2400). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were observed with the JEM-2100 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of DSSCs were measured with a Keithley Model 2400 source meter. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to characterize the electrochemical reaction and electron transport of DSSCs at an open-circuit voltage under illumination of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight source (SANEI solar simulator, Class A) with a power density of 100 ± 2.5 mW cm−2. The electron transport time and charge recombination time were characterized by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) under short-circuit conditions and by intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) under open-circuit conditions, respectively (Zahner, Zennium). A red light-emitting diode (LED, 627 nm) was used as the modulated light source.2.3 Fabrication of dye sensitized solar cells150 nm height SnO2 NRs were grown on a fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, TEC8, Pilkington, sheet resistance 8 Ω sq−1) and a TiO2 particulate film was then coated to a thickness of 10 μm by using a doctor blade method. This photoanode was subsequently sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and then dipped into a 0.5 mM N719 dye solution for 24 h for dye adsorption. Both the dye-adsorbed photoanode and the counter electrode coated with a 20 nm thickness of platinum (Pt) were assembled at a 30 μm gap using a Surlyn (Dupont) as a spacer. The electrolyte of 0.6 M 1-hexyl-2,3-dimethyl imidazolium iodide (C6DMI), 0.2 M LiI, 0.04 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN)/acetonitrile (AN) (1:1 v/v) was injected into the active area (0.25 ± 0.05 cm2) through an entry port.3 Results and discussion3.1 Hydrothermal growth of SnO2 nanorods in a tin oxalate Sn(C2O4) solutionFig. 1 depicts the scheme of SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) generation and their morphological change into nanorods. The SnO2 NPs were generated according to the following mechanisms.23,24 Sn(C2O4) → Sn2+ + (C2O4)2−(1) Sn2+ + (C2O4)2− + 2H2O → Sn(OH)2 + H2C2O4(2) Sn(OH)2 → SnO2 + H2(3) Fig. 1  Scheme for the fabrication of SnO2 nanorods via the hydrothermal method: (a) precipitation of SnO2 nanoparticles and Sn(OH)2 nuclei, (b) a TEM image of SnO2 nanoparticles, (c) coalescence of the nanoparticles into nanorods, and (d) sintering process. Cross-sectional SEM images of SnO2 nanostructures grown on a silicon substrate after hydrothermal reaction (e) for 1 h and (f) 2 h. The nucleation process begins with the dissociation of Sn(C2O4) in water (eqn (1)). The Sn(C2O4) is dissociated easily enough that the nutrient solution becomes supersaturated with tin sources (Sn2+). The abundant free tin sources (Sn2+) undergo a hydration reaction and generate intermediate Sn(OH)2 nuclei (eqn (2)), which lead to the formation of SnO2 particles and a byproduct of hydrogen gas at a temperature of 95 °C (eqn (3)). During this reaction, the resultant large amounts of nanoparticles and intermediate nuclei precipitate and stack on top of the substrate under gravity as shown in Fig. 1(a). The cubes in the TEM image of Fig. 1(b), which were collected from the nutrient solution amid the hydrothermal reaction at 95 °C after 30 min, represent the SnO2 NPs with (110) and (001) planes at the side and top faces, respectively.13 The stacked nanoparticles on the substrate then act as a seed layer for subsequent nanorod growth.It has also been reported that the crystal morphology can be engineered by utilizing supermolecular interactions;25 here, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) ligands form a hydrogen bonded network with the metal ions in an aqueous medium and act as a surfactant. HMTA was utilized as a representative nonpolar solvent for the growth of ZnO nanorods because it easily attaches to the non-polar side faces rather than the polar top face. The Zn sources in the solution have more opportunities to contact the exposed polar top face, allowing growth of the nanorods along the c-axis direction.26 Likewise, the non-polar faces (110) of SnO2 are surrounded by HMTA. Thus, anisotropic nanostructures such as SnO2 nanorods can be grown at the (001) polar top planes during the hydrothermal growth.27Fig. 1(c) shows oriented attachment of nanoparticles as the mechanism of SnO2 nanorod growth.28,29 As the hydrothermal reaction proceeds, the generated SnO2 NPs and intermediate Sn(OH)2 nuclei drift in the nutrient solution and attach the seed layer by gravity or van der Waals interaction. The coalescence of the SnO2 NPs with the seed layer is made through spontaneous self-organization. The attached SnO2 NPs can rotate freely in the solution phase, leading to a preferable crystallographic alignment with the seed layer as they search for the face with maximum surface energy at the interface to reduce the total surface energy of SnO2 aggregation.30 After the succession of the oriented attachment of nanoparticles, SnO2 NRs can be elongated. At first, they have imperfect lattice orientations at the interfaces along the nanorod, which become perfectly aligned after the sintering process (Fig. 1(d)). Fig. 1(e) presents a cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the nanoparticles stacked on the silicon substrate after 1 h of hydrothermal reaction. Fig. 1(f) shows a 45°-tilted image of SnO2 NRs after 2 h of growth prior to sintering, at which stage the nanoparticles coalesced into a nanorod. Note that nanorods can be grown on any substrate regardless of the lattice-mismatch once a seed layer is formed on the substrate.The effects of temperature and Sn(C2O4) concentration on the morphological change were then investigated; e.g., an increased concentration of Sn(C2O4) (0.05 M) relative to HMTA (0.025 M) at an elevated temperature of 150 °C. Fig. 2(a) shows a SEM image of SnO2 nanorods grown in a nutrient solution with a molar ratio of 1:1 (oxalate (0.025 M):HMTA (0.025 M)) at 95 °C for 3 h, demonstrating that the grown nanorods have a length of 150 nm and a diameter of 25 nm. The length of nanorods was limited by the evaporation of nutrient solution during the hydrothermal reaction. After 3 h of reaction, one third of the nutrient solution evaporated in an oven and the nanorod was no longer grown. Fig. 2  SEM images of the hydrothermally SnO2 nanostructures grown on a silicon substrate under 3 different conditions: (a) an oxalate concentration of 0.025 M at 95 °C, (b) 0.025 M at 150 °C, and (c) 0.05 M at 150 °C. If the growth temperature increases to 150 °C at the same molar ratio, the nanorods become thicker, but the total number of nanorods is smaller, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Furthermore, SnO2 nanosheets are easily observable within the nanorods. At an elevated temperature, more Sn2+ ions can be generated in the Sn(C2O4) solution; thus, more SnO2 NPs are liable to stack on the substrate surface with a higher packing density. This stacking causes increased aggregation between the neighbouring nanoparticles and/or between the grown neighbouring nanorods to form the nanosheets.Fig. 2(c) shows the morphological changes of the SnO2 nanostructures at a higher Sn(C2O4) concentration (0.05 M) and 150 °C; leaf-like SnO2 nanosheets are prominent compared with the other two conditions. With the aid of the HMTA surfactant, most nanosheets are perpendicular to the substrate with a space between them. Higher Sn(C2O4) concentration at an elevated temperature enables the nutrient solution to become supersaturated with the tin sources. As a result, vigorous aggregations between the neighboring rods take place to form the resultant nanosheets.313.2 Characterization of SnO2 nanorodsThe crystalline phase of SnO2 NRs was then analysed by XRD before (Fig. 3(a)) and after the sintering process (Fig. 3(b)). The as-grown nanorods reveal broader peaks, but each peak becomes sharper with a higher intensity and a narrower full width at half-maximum (FWHM) after sintering at 400 °C for 1 h. A peak at 37.9°, assigned to the SnO2 (200) crystal plane, becomes apparent after sintering. Diffraction peaks of crystal planes of (110), (101), (200) and (211) are observed; these peaks match the standard XRD data file for an SnO2 tetragonal rutile structure with lattice constants of a, b = 0.4743 nm and c = 0.3186 nm (JCPDS-04101445, ICSD data).32 No impurity peaks are detected, indicating that the grown nanostructures were of high purity and good crystallinity. Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the SnO2 nanorods grown under 0.025 M, 95 °C: (a) before and (b) after sintering at 400 °C for 1 h. TEM was used for further observation of the growth phenomena. The nanorods grown at a concentration of 0.025 M at 95 °C were collected by scraping the substrate with a razor, after which they were attached to a copper grid. Fig. 4(a) presents a TEM image of a complex of SnO2 nanostructures comprised of nanoparticles, nanosheets and nanorods. The nanoparticles are from the seed layer on which the nanorods are grown. HRTEM images, Fig. 4(b) and (c), show the SnO2 NRs before and after sintering, respectively, with a growth direction of [001]. Before sintering, the nanorod is a coalescence of nanoparticles with grain boundaries as shown in Fig. 4(b); however, the lattice fringes have a wavy form due to the imperfect lattice orientation between the nanoparticles which take part in the nanorod growth. This lattice misalignment is confirmed in the inset HRTEM image of Fig. 4(b). Interestingly, the lattice fringes became perfectly aligned after the subsequent sintering process, as shown at the tip of a nanorod in Fig. 4(c). The inset HRTEM image in Fig. 4(c) indicates that single crystalline SnO2 NRs were grown along the [001] growth direction with clear lattice fringes having a spacing of ca. 0.334 nm between adjacent lattice planes of (110). This result is in agreement with previous reports, which demonstrated that the growth rates of SnO2 crystal faces were dependent on their surface energies, i.e., the (110) < (100) < (101) ≪ (001) face in sequence.33,34 Therefore, the SnO2 NPs tend to cover and stack up at the (001) face to reduce overall surface energy during the growth.

The inset shows an optical image of a GIST logo captured through the SnO2 NR-grown glass, showing a high transparency of these SnO2 NRs. In addition, the single crystallinity of SnO2 NRs that is beneficial for fast electron transport indicates its high potential use as a photoanode material in dye sensitized solar cells. Fig. 5  Transmittance spectrum of a borosilicate glass with the grown SnO2 nanorods. The inset shows a digital image of a GIST logo captured through the SnO2 nanorod-grown glass. A film of SnO2 NPs has been employed as the photoanode material in DSSCs, however, it exhibited less efficiencies compared to the conventional TiO2 nanoparticulate film.35,36 This reduction was attributed to the lower dye adsorption of the SnO2 NPs, which is directly related to its isoelectric point (IEP). The higher IEP of TiO2, pH 5–5.5, favours a greater dye adsorption than SnO2 (IEP at pH 4–5), enhancing its light harvest capacity. Therefore, SnO2/TiO2 core–shell structures have been designed and utilized as a photoanode in DSSCs, where the conduction band edge of SnO2, ∼0.3 eV lower than that of TiO2, generates gradual energy levels that are beneficial for efficient electron transfer towards the collecting FTO electrode. Moreover, the TiO2 shell blocks the recombination of electrons with the electrolytes or dye molecules, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency.37–39 In addition, improved photovoltaic properties have been reported by introducing an interfacial layer of SnO2 nanostructures between the FTO electrode and the TiO2 nanoparticulate film.40,41The 150 nm height SnO2 NR-embedded TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode was tested and compared with the DSSC having the only TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode. To the best of our knowledge, this SnO2 NR interfacial layer is the first trial in photoanodes. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of device performance between the two samples, and their photovoltaic properties are tabulated in Table 1. The modified photoanode reveals a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.61% compared to 7.54% from the reference cell, mainly owing to the enhanced short-circuit current (Jsc = 19.61 mA cm−2) in spite of less dye loading. This enhancement can be attributed to the difference in intrinsic electron mobility (SnO2: ∼100 to 200 cm2 V−1 S−1, TiO2: ∼0.1 to 1.0 cm2 V−1 S−1).42,43 Once the photoinduced electrons are transferred to the SnO2 through their favourable energy levels, they migrate to the collecting FTO electrode along the single-crystalline nanorods with less diffusive hindrance of electron transport.

Fig. 7(a) shows the Nyquist plots of the two samples measured from a high frequency (1 MHz) to a low frequency (0.01 Hz) at an open circuit voltage of each cell under one-sun illumination. The diameters of three semicircles represent the electrochemical impedances at the Pt counter electrode, the metal oxide/dye/electrolyte, and in the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− from the left to the right circle.44 The lower impedance at the modified photoanode interface demonstrates that the extent of photoinduced electron transfer is much improved by embedding the SnO2 NRs. Bode plots, as shown in Fig. 7(b), can be drawn from the corresponding Nyquist plots, in which the effective electron lifetime (τeff) at the photoanode can be calculated with the value of maximum frequency (ƒmax) of the mid-frequency regime (103 Hz–10 Hz) with the following equation (eqn (4)):45 (4) Fig. 7  EIS data of DSSCs with the only TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode (square line) and the SnO2 nanorod-embedded TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode (circle line). (a) Nyquist plots and (b) their corresponding Bode plots. The SnO2 NR-embedded photoanode has a lower maximum frequency peak (79 Hz) compared to 171 Hz of the TiO2 particulate photoanode, resulting in an electron lifetime of ∼2.02 ms and ∼0.93 ms, respectively. A longer electron lifetime indicates that the electrons can diffuse further without interruptions such as recombination and trapping within the photoanode film. The incorporation of SnO2 NRs within the TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode increases charge transfer and prolongs electron lifetime.Furthermore, the charge transport time and recombination time of the two samples were measured directly by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS).46,47Fig. 8(a) and (b) compare charge transport time constant (τc) and recombination time constant (τr) as a function of incident light intensity, respectively. The SnO2 NR-embedded photoanode has a faster charge transport time and a slower recombination time compared to the reference, inducing a higher charge collection efficiency (ηcc), defined as: (5) Fig. 8  Comparison of (a) electron transport time constant and (b) recombination time constant as a function of light intensity between the two DSSCs with the only TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode (solid, open square line) and the SnO2 nanorod-embedded TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode (solid, open circle line). The ηcc of the SnO2 NR-embedded photoanode is superior to the reference by 16.63% at the maximum light intensity (35.75 mW cm−2). Therefore, the improved power conversion efficiency from the SnO2 NR-embedded photoanode is mainly due to the enhanced short-circuit currents, resulting from the superior charge collection properties.4 ConclusionIn summary, we demonstrated a simple hydrothermal method for growing rutile-crystalline SnO2 NRs on various substrates, e.g. silicon, glass and FTO glass, by introducing a new nutrient solution composed of Sn(C2O4) regardless of the lattice mismatch. It was easily dissociated at 95 °C to generate abundant tin sources (Sn2+) in a nutrient solution due to its low electrostatic attraction to C2O42−. A large amount of SnO2 NPs were generated via hydration reaction of the supersaturated tin sources with water, which then stacked onto the substrate surface and acted as a seed layer for the subsequent nanorod growth. The HRTEM images demonstrate that single crystalline SnO2 NRs were grown as the nanoparticles coalesced owing to the oriented attachment phenomenon, in which clear lattice fringes were observed along the nanorod after sintering. Taking advantages of their high transparency and electron mobility, the SnO2 NRs were imbedded into the TiO2 nanoparticulate photoanode in DSSCs, demonstrating a power conversion efficiency of 8.61%, enhanced by 14.2% compared to the reference.AcknowledgementsThis work was partially supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF, no.
