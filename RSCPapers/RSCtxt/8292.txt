        nanorod arrays (NRAs) mimicking moth-eye structures were fabricated with colloidal lithography and reactive ion etching. Compared with that on polished surface, the reflectance on NRA structures is significantly reduced by more than 10 times. The reflectance is decreased with the height of the NRAs. The anti-reflection (AR) ability of the NRAs is accompanied with broad band, omnidirectional, and polarization-insensitive characteristics. The enhancement of surface hydrophobicity is also observed with increasing height of the NRAs. A detailed experimental analysis of the height-dependent AR and self-cleaning characteristics will benefit the design and optimization processes of Si nanowire-based optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Dielectric layers with the thickness of λ/4 are conventionally employed as anti-reflection (AR) coatings to suppress the undesired Fresnel reflections by satisfying the conditions for a theoretical reflectance minimum.1 However, AR coatings obtained with such a technique encounter two major problems: (i) light reflection only reaches the minimum at a single wavelength (λmin), and gradually increases as the wavelength deviates from λmin1, and (ii) the exact layer thickness of λ/4 is not easy to achieve due to the non-uniform surface flatness and the limited accuracy of the thickness-monitoring systems. Inspired by moth-eye cornea which comprises of periodic arrays of protuberance,2 the nanorod arrays (NRAs) with sub-wavelength dimensions are the promising alternatives to attain superior AR performance, i.e. lower reflectance over a wider range of wavelengths.3,4 With the periodicity less than the wavelength of the incident light, the NRA surface behaves like an effective homogeneous medium with a continuous gradient of refractive index, which greatly reduces the reflection through destructive interference.2
Periodic NRAs have been successfully patterned by various methods, including laser interference lithography,5electron-beam lithography,6nanoimprint lithography,7 and electrochemical etching technique.8 However, these techniques are restricted from practical applications due to expensive equipment, complex procedures, and disordered alignment. On the other hand, colloidal lithography using self-assembled nanoparticles serves as an alternative solution for patterning nanostructures due to its simplicity, scalability, and low cost.9–13 In addition, the AR structures fabricated by colloidal lithography were found to preserve close-packed honeycomb-like arrays, which proved significantly beneficial to the energy conversion efficiency of Si-based solar cells.9
It is also found that surface hydrophobicity, originally observed on water-repellent lotus leaves and butterfly wings, can be significantly enhanced by the NRA structures.14,15 The hydrophobicity of the surface is generally characterized by the contact angles (CAs), which are significantly influenced by the geometry of NRAs.14 Improving the hydrophobicity of nanostructured surfaces via optimizing the surface profiles is of great importance in realizing self-cleaning effect for practical applications.
Although anti-reflective Si NRAs fabricated by colloidal lithography have been reported previously, most of the published results were limited to the measurement of spectral reflectance.9–12 Since omnidirectionality and polarization-insensitivity are also needed to further improve the performances of many optoelectronics devices, the characterizations of these two properties are strongly desired. In this study, Si-based NRAs with tunable surface profiles using colloidal lithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) are investigated systematically. The NRAs with increased heights exhibit superior AR properties with broad band, omnidirectional, and polarization-insensitive characteristics. We also demonstrate that the hydrophobic behaviour of NRAs can be enhanced by simply prolonging the nanorods. Detailed analysis of the anti-reflective and hydrophobic properties of Si NRAs will be discussed. The comprehensive studies presented here should benefit the design and optimization processes of a wide variety of devices ranging from photodiodes and solar cells to thin-film transistors in large-scale flat panel displays.
Experimental
The NRAs structures were fabricated with the process combining self-assembled colloidal lithography and RIE. Close-packed polystyrene (PS) nanospheres with the diameter of 500 nm were drop-coated on Si substrate with the following procedure: in order to produce a monolayer of PS nanospheres, the Si substrate surface was made hydrophilic by immersion in a solution of H2SO4/H2O2 at 80 °C for 10 min. The PS-nanosphere solution, diluted in deionized water, was then coated on the substrate surface with the volume-controlled pipette. Finally, the substrate was held at 50 °C and 87.5% humidity for 2 h, and a close-packed hexagonal PS monolayer was formed upon drying of the solution. The PS monolayer was uniformly distributed within the area of ∼1.5 mm2, and the period (center-to-center distance) of the close-packed nanospheres is 500 nm. Subsequently, the nanorod structures were made by a RIE process using the PS nanospheres as masks. In the RIE process, a mixture of SF6/O2 (150/50 sccm) plasmas at the fixed chamber pressure (1.33 mTorr) and coil power (50 W) was employed. Si NRAs with the heights of 200 nm, 330 nm, 470 nm, and 580 nm were obtained by the etching durations of 30, 90, 120, and 150 s, respectively. The base diameters of the 4 different NRAs were all around 370 nm. Geometric features of the NRAs were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, field emission JEOL JSM-6500). Reflectance measurements were carried out with an JASCO V-670 UV-vis spectrometer with integral sphere.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a)–
1(e) show the SEM images of the PS monolayer and the nanostructures fabricated with different etching durations. The unit cell of every nanorod is indicated by the red hexagon shown in Fig. 1(a). This unit cell can be used to determine the area filling ratios of the NRAs, and will be discussed later. Fig. 1(f) presents the approximately linear relationship between the height of NRAs and etching duration. The formation mechanism of the NRAs can be understood by the chemical reactions during the RIE process. In the process, the active fluorine ions from the SF6/O2 plasma provide an etching effect to Si by forming the volatile SiF4.16 As the etching rate of polystyrene is much lower than that of Si under SF6/O2 plasma etching, polystyrene nanospheres protect Si immediately underneath them from being etched, resulting in the formation of NRAs directly on Si surfaces. Once the Si NRAs are etched with a desired height by adjusting the duration of RIE process, the templating polystyrene nanospheres can be removed.

The reduction in reflectance achieved by the Si NRAs is clearly presented in Fig. 2(a). At the angle of incidence (AOI) of 8°, the polished Si exhibits more than 35% reflectance for the wavelengths from 350 to 850 nm, whereas all the Si NRAs show reflectance as low as 15% in the same range of wavelengths. The maximum at 370 nm in the reflectance is caused by the interband transitions in Si.17 This principal spectral feature is observable both on the polished and nanostructured surfaces, indicating that the intrinsic material qualities were preserved after the RIE process.18

The significant decrease in the reflectance of periodic Si NRAs can be related to several effects. The patterning of subwavelength structures would eliminate the diffraction-order light, leading to the significant decrease in the reflectance.19 Moreover, as the wavelength becomes greater than the periodicity, the reflection is mainly suppressed by the destructive interference led by the graded effective refractive index (neff) of the NRA structures, which is the so-called moth-eye effect.2,4,20–22 The graded neff comes from the finding that the Si NRAs are not exactly cylindrical. Due to the imperfectly preferential etching by RIE process, the broadening of the nanorods beginning at top and extending to the bottom appears to be sufficient to result in a height-dependent neff. When the incident lights are reflected at different depths from the surface, the waves with different phases can partially or wholly cancel one another, leading to the significant reduction of the reflectance over a wide range of wavelengths.
It is also found that the magnitude of total reflectance for the NRA surfaces decreases with increasing height of NRAs. The height dependence of the reflectance is ascribed to the change in surface roughness (δrms), which is defined as23: (1) where h is the height of NRAs and F (0 ≤ F ≤ 1) is the area ratio filled by the NRAs. During the calculations, F was estimated by the equation: F = πr2/A, where A is the area of the hexagonal unit cell defined by the periodic arrangement of PS nanospheres, and r is the radius at around the half height of a nanorod, with the approximation that the shape of the nanorod is circular, instead of hexagonal. Both A and r are determined by the SEM images. Fig. 2(b) shows the calculated surface roughness of the Si NRAs. As depicted by eqn (1), the surface roughness is increased from 77 nm at h = 200 nm to 220 nm at h = 580 nm. A rougher surface traps the incident lights by increasing the frequency of reflected waves bouncing back from the back surface rather than out to the surrounding air, and therefore reduces the reflectance.24 Furthermore, the NRAs with greater height produce severer destructive interference owing to the smoother grading in neff, which also results in the decrease of reflectance.
One of the critical features of AR coatings is the insensitivity to AOI, which is so-called omnidirectionality. In order to examine the omnidirectional characteristics, the reflectance as a function of AOI was measured on the polished and nanostructured surfaces at 650 nm. Fig. 3(a)–3(c) show the reflectance from various surface structures measured with unpolarized, s-, and p-polarized lights, where s and p denote the planes of incidence perpendicular and parallel to the electric field of the incident light, respectively. One can see that the reflectance is generally reduced with increasing heights of NRAs over a wide range of AOI. The reflectance of 580 nm height NRAs measured with unpolarized, s-, and p-polarized lights for AOI up to 50° remains below 2.08%, 3.76%, and 0.73%, respectively. These values are lower than those of polished Si surface by more than one order, indicating that the ability of NRA structures to reduce interface reflectance is effective over a wide range of AOI. It is noticed that the reflectance of all the Si NRAs is increased significantly after AOI reaches 60°. This trend can be attributed to the increased scattering of the incident light since the gradient of refractive index between the structure material and the air was difficult to be generated at large AOIs. Similar results were also observed elsewhere.25 Intuitively, when the light reaches the NRA layer's surface at a large AOI, the portion of the light entering the NRA layers is decreased, suggesting that the probability of trapping light within the NRA layers is reduced, and therefore the reflectance is increased. The polarization-dependent omnidirectionality can be characterized by the ratio of the reflectance of the s-polarization to that of the p-polarization (Is/Ip), as shown in Fig. 3(d). The polished Si exhibits a maximum of Is/Ip = 133.35 while a maximum of Is/Ip is decreased to less than 45 for all NRAs, suggesting that the reflection become polarization-insensitive in Si NRA surfaces over a wide range of AOI. In Fig. 3(d), it is also noticed that Brewster's angle shifts from 76° on the polished surface to ∼56° at the nanostructured surfaces. The shift is due to the incoherent multiple scattering on a rough surface,21 at which the resultant AOI and neff (different from those on the polished surface) induce higher order terms of scattered lights and produce a shift in reflection minimum by the interference effect between the reflected and scattered fields.

In order to characterize the hydrophobicity of the height-controlled Si NRAs, CAs of water drops on the NRA surfaces were measured. The CA on the polished surface of Si substrate is 95°, and those measured on the NRA surfaces with different heights are shown in Fig. 4. As the height is increased from 200 nm to 580 nm, the CA is increased monotonically from 110° to 128°, indicating that surface hydrophobicity was improved by prolonging the length of NRAs. The corresponding photographs of water droplets on different NRA surfaces are shown in the insets of Fig. 4. The height-dependent hydrophobic behaviour of the NRA surfaces can be explained by Cassie's equation:26 cosθw = fcosθy−(1 − f)(2)where θw (90° < θw < 180° for hydrophobic surface) is the measured CA on a NRA surface, θy is the intrinsic CA on a polished surface, f is the fraction of the water/solid interface and (1 − f) is that of the water/air interface. As depicted in Fig. 2(b), increasing the heights of nanorods increases the surface roughness, which makes a larger fraction of the water/air interface, and thereby produces a greater value of (1 − f) in eqn (2). Consequently, surface hydrophobicity is improved by increasing heights of NRAs.

Conclusion
In summary, Si NRAs with the height varied from 200 nm to 580 nm were fabricated by a technique combining low-cost colloidal lithography and RIE. The Si NRAs exhibit improved broad band and omnidirectional AR properties; for example, the NRAs with the height of 580 nm remains below 10% for total reflectance over wavelength domains from 350 to 850 nm, and below 2.08% for spectral reflectance for AOI up to 50° with unpolarized 650 nm light. Is/Ip is decreased to less than 45 for all NRA layers, demonstrating polarization-insensitive AR properties. Moreover, hydrophobic properties were enhanced by increasing the height of NRAs. The understanding of the height-dependent AR and self-cleaning effects is expected to improve the performances of a variety of optoelectronic devices.
