    , Accepted 12th June 2014First published on 12th June 2014AbstractCore–shell-structured β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites have been successfully prepared and applied for the first time as a multifunctional layer on top of a transparent TiO2 layer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Structural characterizations indicate that NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) have an average size of 300 nm in length and 230 nm in width. By adding these large dimension NPs as effective light scattering centers and upconversion centers, the performance of DSSCs was enhanced and an energy conversion efficiency of 7.56% was achieved. Furthermore, attachment of ∼20 nm Au NPs on the surface of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs could further improve the performance of DSSCs, resulting in an efficiency of 8.23%, which is a noticeable enhancement of 14.78% compared to the cell without the multifunctional layer. Therefore, this work provides an insight into possible further optimization of the efficiency of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn considerable attention of both academic and industrial fields for decades owing to their high-efficiency and potential for manufacturing at a low cost.1,2 Over the past decades, extensive efforts have been focused on the improvement of their photoelectric conversion efficiency by optimizing the structure and properties of the photoanode.3–5 Generally, the conventional photoanode of DSSCs is composed of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with a size of 20–40 nm. However, due to their small size, the scattering effects are negligible for visible light; hence, a large proportion of incident light would not be utilized, resulting in a low light harvesting efficiency.6 To date, one effective way to enhance the light harvesting capability is to introduce a scattering layer on top of the transparent TiO2 layer.7–9
Currently, Ru complexes, such as N3 and N719, are known as the best sensitizers in DSSCs. However, the main absorption wavelength ranges for dyes N3 and N719 are only up to <700 nm, which are very low compared to the near-infrared (NIR) light.10 About 43% of the radiant energy from the sun in the infrared region is not absorbed, which limits the solar energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. An alternative way to improve light harvesting and thereby the efficiency of the solar cells can be the utilization of upconversion phosphors (UCPs).11,12 The UCPs, which can convert low-energy photons (near-infrared photons) into high-energy photons (visible to ultraviolet photons) via the multiphoton processes, have been considered one of the promising solutions and have been applied in DSSCs.13–17 Among all the upconversion materials, due to low phonon energy of lattices, hexagonal phase sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4) crystals have been reported to be one of the most efficient upconversion host materials and have been widely studied, especially for the systems doped with Yb/Er and Yb/Tm.18–22 It is known that smaller NaYF4 UCPs with increased surface defects and ligands with high-energy vibrational modes can lead to a serious quenching effect.23–25 Therefore, when small NaYF4 UCPs are used in the TiO2 film internally, defects and ligands on their surface will act as trapping centers and a large part of photoinduced electrons can be trapped, leading to a heavy loss of photocurrent, which becomes a major limitation for their application in DSSCs internally.17 To overcome this drawback indirectly, Zhao et al. proposed a novel core–double-shell β-NaYF4@SiO2@TiO2 structure for NIR light harvesting and light reflecting,26 which resulted in an efficiency of 8.65%. This work paved a facile way to enable large dimension β-NaYF4 UCPs to be used as scattering and upconversion centers in photoanodes.
More recently, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) from a metallic nanostructure has been introduced into DSSCs to enhance light absorption and photocurrent generation.27–31 The noble metal NPs act as light harvesting components via excitation of their LSPR in the visible range of spectrum. Moreover, the coupling of LSPR with the adsorbed dye will lead to an increase in the effective absorption cross-section of dye molecules.32 Noble metal NPs have been observed to improve light harvesting in thin film solar cells, in which metal NPs are dispersed as islands.33 Ogale et al. had in situ loaded Au NPs on TiO2 nanofibers as a light harvesting layer, leading to a remarkable enhancement in the efficiency. They demonstrated that coupled surface plasmon-polariton modes play a key role in the enhancement.34 Furthermore, the incorporation of noble metal NPs with UCPs could significantly enhance the upconversion fluorescence emission, which could make a better use of UCPs as upconversion centers in DSSCs.35,36
Herein, in this report, we present a facile method to integrate β-NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs with Au NPs for constructing core–shell-structured NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au hybrid nanocomposites. A uniform modified silica layer on NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs serves as an interface for Au decoration and an isolating layer to prevent bare UCNPs from acting as serious recombination centers causing loss of the photocurrent. Fig. 1 illustrates the experimental process for preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au hybrid nanocomposites and the configuration of DSSCs. For device application, the obtained nanocomposites were applied as a multifunctional layer on top of the transparent TiO2 layer for a proof-of-concept study of DSSCs. By utilizing these efficient NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs, NIR irradiation can be absorbed and harvested indirectly by dye molecules to broaden the absorption region and produce more electrons, and these large nanocomposites could also be used as effective scattering centers, which scatter light by multiple reflections, and thus increase their optical path-length.10 Furthermore, the LSPR effects from Au NPs could not only enhance the upconversion emission but also excite dye molecules more effectively than the incident far-field light, thus leading to enhanced light adsorption and photocurrent generation in DSSCs.37

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
RE(NO)3 (99.9%) (RE = Y, Yb, Er), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd. Chloroauric acid, dye sensitizer, cis-bis(isothicyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′′-discarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)-bis-tetrabutylammonium (coded as N719), terpineol, ethyl cellulose, LiI, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and chloroplatinic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co., and all other chemicals were purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. All chemicals were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of carboxyl-modified β-NaYF4 UCNPs
Carboxyl-modified β-NaYF4 UCNPs were prepared by adapting a method we reported before.38,39 Typically, 1.2 mmol of RE(NO3)3 (Y:Yb:Er = 80:18:2), 2.4 mmol of NaCl and 1.8 g of PAA were dissolved in 20 mL ethylene glycol (EG) and mixed thoroughly to form a transparent solution. Then, NH4F (5 mmol) dissolved in 15 mL EG was added to the above mixture under stirring. The resultant mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-linked autoclave, which was then sealed and heated to 200 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the products were collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and ultrapure water several times, and dried in an oven at 60 °C.
2.3 Synthesis of amino-modified NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs
In a typical modified Stöber sol–gel process synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 particles, 50 mg of the as-obtained NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs was dispersed in a solution containing 80 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of ultrapure water, and then sonicated at room temperature for 30 min. Then, a solution of 2 mL of 28% ammonia solution was added to the mixture, followed by dropwise addition of 20 μL of TEOS and the reaction proceeded for 8 h with continuous stirring. Then, 200 μL of APTMS was added and allowed to react for another 1 h, yielding amino-modified core–shell structured NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs. Finally, the products were centrifuged with ethanol and ultrapure water several times and dried at 60 °C for further use.
2.4 Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au hybrid composites
Citrate-stabilized Au NPs of 20 nm were prepared according to the reported methods.40 To prepare NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au hybrid nanocomposites, 1 mL suspension of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs (1 mM) was swiftly added into a 2 mL suspension of Au NPs (1 mM), and after being vigorously rotated for 5 min, the mixed solution was sealed in a 10 mL plastic tube and slowly rotated for another 2 h.
2.5 Device fabrication
TiO2 (20–40 nm) paste for the transparent layer was prepared by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide via a reported procedure.41 In order to obtain the paste for the scattering layer, all the previously obtained samples were added into the solution containing terpineol (1 mL), ethyl cellulose (25 mg) and Triton X-100 (0.4 mL) and stirred for 1 h. The doctor blade method was used to prepare photoelectrodes, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. For dye adsorption, films were immersed in anhydrous ethanol solution of the N719 dye (0.5 mM) for 24 h at room temperature. The liquid electrolyte was composed of LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.05 M) and TBP (0.5 M) in acetonitrile. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating H2PtCl6 (in isopropanol, 15 mM) onto the FTO glass followed by heating at 400 °C for 30 min.
2.6 Characterization
To demonstrate the overall uniformity and morphology of the particles, the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL SM-6360LV microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrophotometer (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL 2011 microscope (Japan) operated at 200 kV. The crystal structure was investigated by X-ray power diffraction (RIGAK, D/MAX 2550 VB/PC, Japan). Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Fluorolog-3-P UV-VIS-NIR fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon, France) with a CW NIR laser at λ = 980 nm as the excitation source. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer within the range of 500–4000 cm−1. Diffuse reflection spectra of pure and modified films were observed on Carry 5000. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source. IPCE photocurrents were recorded under short-circuit conditions using a Newport 2931-C power meter. Photocurrent voltage I–V measurements were performed using a Newport I–V tester (Oriel Class A 91160A) under 1 sun conditions (100 mW cm−2 at AM 1.5). The irradiated area of each cell was kept at 0.25 cm2 by covering with an aluminium mask. Dye loading measurements were conducted by immersing the films in 0.1 M NaOH solution and monitoring the concentration of the desorbed dye by UV/vis spectroscopy. Quantum yield measurement was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy (Edinburgh LFS920) modified by using Ocean Optics UV-VIS-NIR CCD (QE65000) as a detector for collecting the 980 nm light and the UC emissions. An integrating sphere was also used to measure the efficiency data. The response of the detection systems in photon flux was determined using a calibrated VIS-NIR lamp (Ocean Optics LS-1-CAL). For the lifetime characterization, direct excitation into the infrared (980 nm), green (Er3+, 4S3/2 at 543 nm) emitting states was performed using a phosphorescence lifetime spectrometer (FSP920-C, Edinburgh) equipped with a tunable mid-band OPO pulse laser as an excitation source (410–2400 nm, 10 Hz, pulse width ≤5 ns, Vibrant 355II, OPOTEK).
3. Results and discussion
In order to investigate the structure of the as-synthesized samples, XRD was employed to analyze the products. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs, NaYF4:Yb,Er @SiO2 NPs, NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au powder samples. The diffraction peaks in curve a can be indexed as a pure hexagonal NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs (JCPDS card 28-1192).39 After coating with the silica layer, the diffraction pattern of the resulting material (curve b) shows a reflection characteristic of amorphous SiO2, in addition to the NaYF4:Yb,Er diffraction peaks. The XRD pattern of the NaYF4@SiO2@Au nanocomposites (curve c) exhibits the superimposition of reflections of the NaYF4 phase and Au phase. The four peaks position at 2θ values of 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.7°, and 77.7°, which correspond to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) lattice planes of the cubic phase Au (JCPDS card 04-0784), respectively. This preliminarily proves the successful preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites.

Fig. 3a shows the SEM image of Yb, Er-codoped NaYF4 UCNPs. As can be seen from a low magnification SEM image, these UCNPs exhibit perfect uniformity and monodispersity, and their analysis reveals that they have an average size of ∼270 nm in length and ∼200 nm in width, and their surfaces are very rough. To isolate the upconversion core with the external environment, a uniform silica layer was coated on their surfaces by a typical modified Stöber sol-gel process.42 As shown in Fig. 3b, the core single-shell structure can be observed clearly with an amorphous SiO2 shell thickness of around 15 nm and smooth surfaces. After aminosilane is grafted onto the silica layer, the existence of amino groups provides a powerful claw for the NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs to grab Au NPs, due to the strong coordination between Au NPs and the –NH2 group. It is observed from Fig. 3c and d that Au NPs have good monodispersity and an average size of about 20 nm. Fig. 3e presents a typical TEM image of the core–shell-structured NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites. It can be seen that all Au NPs had been attached to the NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs and no free Au NPs had been found nearby. In the EDS spectrum (Fig. 3f), in addition to the peaks of host (Na, Y, F) and dopants (Yb, Er), Si, O and Au elements were also detected in the NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of Au NPs, NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs and NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 4a. It is known that for Au NPs in sizes ranging from 2 to 100 nm, the electrons are trapped in the small Au metal box and exhibit a characteristic of collective oscillation frequency of the plasmon resonance, giving rise to the LSPR band at around 520 nm.43 The broad absorption band peaked at 530 nm in the spectrum of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au indicates the presence of Au NPs, a slight red shift is observed compared to bare Au NPs; this observation is also consistent with a previous report that the LSPR peak would shift to higher wavelengths with the aggregation of Au NPs.44

The surfaces of UCNPs without modification are coated with a layer of PAA, which can be confirmed by the FTIR spectroscopy in Fig. 4b. It is observed in curve a that the PAA exhibits a transmission band at around 3442 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group. Two peaks at 1644 and 1469 cm−1 are associated with the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group (COO−), respectively.45 In addition, the two peaks at 2925 and 2855 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the methylene group, respectively, which exists in the long alkyl chain of the PAA molecule. Curve b shows the FTIR spectrum of the amino-modified NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs. The stretching and bending vibration bands of the amine group appear at 3415 and 1613 cm−1 in the spectrum, respectively. A strong transmission band attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of the Si–O bond can be seen clearly at 1090 cm−1 in the spectrum.46 In addition, the two peaks at 2925 and 2857 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the methylene group, respectively, which exists in the hydrolysate of APTMS. The peak at 1097 cm−1 suggests that the UCNPs were successfully coated with a layer of silica, whereas the peaks at 3415, 2925, and 2857 cm−1 verify that the silica-coated UCNPs have been functionalized with amino groups.
Upconversion fluorescence spectra of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 5. The inset image shows the upconversion fluorescence photograph of the obtained NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites in water under excitation using a 980 nm laser. Two green peaks (525 and 543 nm) and a red peak (655 nm) are ascribed to the energy transitions from 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions, respectively, when excited using a commercial continuous wave diode NIR laser. After the UCNPs were coated with the silica layer and modified with amino groups, their fluorescence decreased to some extent because of the light scattering effects on both emission and incident light by the silica layer. However, with Au NP attachment, remarkable enhancement for multicolour upconversion emission was observed, and an enhancement factor of more than 2 was achieved. The quantum yield obtained by the integrated sphere is 0.023 ± 0.01% for NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs and the decay curves of Er3+ emission at 543 nm in NaYF4:Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au samples were measured using 980 nm excitation. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the lifetimes of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ were measured to be 32.4 μs and 57.9 μs for NaYF4:Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au, respectively, suggesting that the emission yield is enhanced following attachment of Au NPs. This result is consistent with the upconversion fluorescence spectra shown in Fig. 5. The enhancement effects from Au NPs can be attributed to at least two possible factors: (1) increase of the excitation rate by local field enhancement, which is an enhancement of the effective excitation flux caused by local field enhancement.47 (2) Increase of the emission rate by surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE), which will increase both the nonradiative and radiative decay rate of fluorophores. SPCE could occur when the plasmon resonance frequency overlaps with the emission band of fluorophores. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the Au NPs (Fig. S2, ESI†) clearly shows that the plasmonic resonance frequency of the Au NPs overlaps well with the green and red emission of the upconversion emission. This allows the effective coupling of LSPR of Au NPs with upconversion emission; therefore, the radiative decay rate and emission intensity of the UCNPs will be increased.36

The inset is a digital photograph of upconversion fluorescence of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au under excitation of a 980 nm laser. All the samples at 0.5 mg mL−1 were used in the experiment. 
In order to investigate the DSSC performance of these samples, a bilayer film was constructed by printing a layer (∼5 μm) of samples on the top of a layer of (∼7.5 μm) of TiO2.48 For clarity, samples are denoted as T, T/N, T/N@S, T/N@S@A, where T and N represent pure TiO2 and NaYF4:Yb,Er crystal, and S and A indicate the inner SiO2 and outer Au shell, respectively. The photocurrent density–voltage curves (J–V) of DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 6a, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the pure T cell exhibites a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.63 mA cm−2 and an efficiency (η) of 7.17%. Nevertheless, due to the serious recombination effects of bare UCNPs, device T/N shows the lowest Jsc of 11.90 mA cm−2, and a η of 6.77%, despite the light harvesting capability. Then, after being coated with the thin SiO2 insulating layer (T/N@S), the negative recombination effects would be avoided and Jsc is greatly enhanced to 14.78 mA cm−2 owing to the minor upconversion effects and the predominant light scattering effects,49 since the upconversion contribution has been proven almost negligible due to low quantum yield of upconversion materials.26 With coating of Au NPs, the performance was optimized and the highest Jsc of 15.84 mA cm−2 and η of 8.23% were achieved, which is 14.78% enchancement in efficiency compared to bare TiO2 crystals and 8.86% increase compared to the device based on NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 crystals. The enhancement is believed to be associated with enhanced scattering effects, more photoinduced electrons and LSPR effects from incorporated Au NPs.

Detailed information on the light harvesting of the DSSCs can be obtained from the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 6b).50 For device T/N, as a large number of photoinduced electrons were trapped by surface defects and ligands on these bare T crystals, less electrons were recaptured by I3−, and device T/N exhibits the lowest IPCE performance. By adding the insulating SiO2 layer and attaching Au NPs, it can be seen that the IPCE values were considerably reinforced in the entire visible region, and the device T/N@S@A possesses the highest IPCE values. Compared to device T/N@S, the higher IPCE values of device T/N@S@A are considered as plasmon excitation could improve optical density near the metal surfaces in plasmon enhanced solar cells, dye molecules located in the vicinity of the nanoparticles can harvest more photons, thus increasing the IPCE.51,52 Hence, these results confirm the significant optoelectronic benefits from the NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposites layer in the cell design and is reflected in the remarkable efficiency enhancement.
Light scattering properties of unsensitized photoanodes were evaluated by measuring the diffuse reflectance. As given in Fig. 7a, upon comparison with the transparent TiO2 film, bilayer films are found to have remarkable improvement in light reflectance over the entire region, indicating that the large dimension nanocomposites can act as effective light scattering centers to extend the light path-length within the electrodes,26 and thus increase light harvesting. Thus, the outstanding efficiency value of device T/N@S@A is partially increased by an enhanced light harvesting due to outstanding light scattering and reflecting effects. Hence, superior light scattering ability (Fig. 7a), enhanced upconversion emission (Fig. 5, red line) and high IPCE values (Fig. 6b) produced an enhanced Jsc (15.84 mA cm−2) and an improved η (8.23%) for the device T/N@S@A as compared to other devices in this work.
 Fig. 7  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra with different photoanodes and (b) UV-vis absorption spectra of the N719 dye in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, desorbed from different photoanodes. 
To further identify the effects of LSPR, the absorbed dye concentration on the sample surface was quantified by desorbing the N719 dye from the sample electrodes in an alkaline aqueous medium. Absorption spectra of the N719 dye in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 7b. It can be seen that the device T/N@S has the highest dye loading amount (due to abundant surface silanols); however, the increased dye loading amount will not contribute to photocurrent by charge injection via the dye on the SiO2 surface, but the increase of Jsc mainly occurs due to increased scattering. The amount of dye adsorption decreased after Au NP modification compared to device T/N@S, indicating that the improvement of Jsc in the case of device T/N@S@A could be attributed to the combined effects of LSPR and enhanced upconversion effects rather than excess dye loading. For LSPR effects, oscillating conduction electrons of Au NPs resonate with the electric field of incident light, resulting in enhancement of the oscillating electric fields that are localized in the vicinity of Au NPs. The localized electric fields can excite dyes more effectively than the incident far-field light.53
The possible mechanism of enhanced light trapping can be described with reference to the schematic of Fig. 8. When the light reaches the NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2 NPs layer in an actual solar cell, it is randomized in terms of directions by scattering in the TiO2 layer. It will get back-scattered (dashed red arrows) due to better scattering ability of large dimension of the samples. Upconversion fluorescence emission will happen simultaneously due to the strong NIR light from solar radiation (dashed green arrows). In the case of NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au nanocomposite layer, when light interacts with the embedded Au NPs, it can generate LSPR, which can concentrate electromagnetic fields leading to trapping of the light effectively. Moreover, the LSPR helps in concentrating the light in the device interior as well. In addition, the intensity of upconversion emission and the upconversion effects could be enhanced at the same time.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, core–shell-structured β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@Au hybrid nanocomposites were successfully prepared and employed for proof-of-concept study in DSSCs internally as a multifunctional layer on top of the transparent TiO2 layer. Due to their large dimension, these nanocomposites can act as effective scattering centers to enhance the light harvesting. By coating with an amorphous SiO2 insulating layer around the β-NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs, the electron trapping and capture caused by surface defects and ligands of bare β-NaYF4:Yb,Er crystals can be thoroughly avoided. After attachment of Au NPs, the performance of DSSCs was significantly enhanced, resulting in an efficiency of 8.23%, which is a noticeable improvement of 14.78% compared to the device without the multifunctional layer (7.17%). This is most likely caused by the combined effects of light scattering, LSPR and enhanced upconversion. Therefore, we outline a facile strategy for incorporating LSPR with upconversion effects to further optimize the efficiency of DSSCs.
