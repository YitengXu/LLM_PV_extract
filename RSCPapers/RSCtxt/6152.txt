    , Accepted 27th April 2018First published on 27th April 2018AbstractThe synthesis of an azetidinium lead iodide perovskite (CH2)3NH2PbI3 (AzPbI3), and its extensive characterization are reported. The compound was synthesized through a simple approach based on the reaction between an azetidine aqueous solution and lead acetate dissolved in an excess of hot concentrated aqueous HI. The compound was recrystallized by the vapor diffusion method. Since the synthesized AzPbI3 crystals consistently turned out to be twinned and disordered, the structure determination was performed by using powder X-ray diffraction data analysis procedures. The material was found to possess a quite complex and large rhombohedral crystal structure with a zig-zag array of groups composed of three PbI6 octahedra sharing faces along the c-axis. Unfortunately, because of the extended cationic sublattice disorder and of the large X-ray scattering factor difference between the atoms composing the (CH2)3NH2PbI3 (AzPbI3) unit cell, the position of azetidinium cations could not be determined with confidence. The material was also characterized by CHN, ESI-MS analyses and FT-IR spectroscopy in order to verify its chemical composition. Furthermore, TG-DTA coupled to quadrupole mass spectrometry, temperature-controlled powder XRD and Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry were employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the material. Besides, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy and PL measurements were carried out to investigate the optical properties of the material. Optical properties turned out to be very sensitive to preparative conditions. In addition, a test of mutual solid solubility with methylammonium lead iodide, CH3NH3PbI3, was performed by co-precipitation of both perovskites. Powder XRD clearly showed mutual solubility. Hence, the higher basicity of azetidine compared to that of methylamine may enhance the stability of solid solutions made out of the two perovskites with respect to the hydrolysis of pure CH3NH3PbI3 thus increasing the lifetime of perovskite solar devices.
1. Introduction
Organoammonium lead halides are currently under intense scientific and technological investigation worldwide. Indeed, the discovery and optimization of the outstanding photovoltaic properties of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) during the last nine years, has brought about an impressive progress in the photovoltaic performances of devices based on this material.1,2 Most research has been devoted to the quest for higher performance and more stable materials for real devices. Despite the high energy conversion efficiency attained with lab-assembled devices, CH3NH3PbI3 suffers from severe chemical problems (i.e. reactivity towards moisture, oxygen, photodegradation under UV radiation, and toxicity of lead compounds3) and thermal/thermodynamic4–7 stability issues. These problems, especially the moisture sensitivity, have impeded the commercial implementation of photovoltaic devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 and related compounds so far.
Azetidinium cations (Az+) have been proposed multiple times as a possible candidate for new organoammonium lead halide perovskites. In fact, their calculated ionic radius (2.5 Å) is compatible with a perovskite structure.7,8 Moreover, the relatively moderate difference in size compared to methylammonium cations8 leads to a certain degree of solubility of Az+ in the CH3NH3PbI3 lattice.9 Such an addition has already been proven to be slightly beneficial in terms of solar cell performances and may be beneficial in terms of stability towards moisture, with azetidinium lead iodide (AzPbI3) films being unaffected by short time exposure to liquid water.9 This moisture resistance was also confirmed by our work and it is shown later in the present manuscript. Actually, AzPbI3 crystals did not completely decompose after 50-day long total immersion in water. Pering et al.9 have already introduced the preparation and characterization of AzPbI3 films. The same authors suggested a crystal structure for this compound, which possesses many intriguing and unusual physical properties. Therefore, the aim of the present manuscript is to present a detailed investigation regarding the synthesis, crystallization, structure solution and physico-chemical characterization of the material with respect to its optical properties and thermal stability. In addition, a mutual solubility test between CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH2)3NH2PbI3 (AzPbI3) was performed in order to estimate the maximum mutual solubility values.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials preparation
Lead(II) acetate trihydrate Pb(OAc)2·3H2O (99.0–103%), hydroiodic acid HI 57% in water (stabilized with 1.5% hypophosphorous acid), azetidine (CH2)3NH (98%; GC assay 99.8%), and methylamine CH3NH2 40% in water were purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and acetonitrile (MeCN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dried over 3 Å molecular sieves before use. The synthesis of AzPbI3 was performed as follows. 8 g of Pb(OAc)2·3H2O were dissolved in 30 ml of 57% HI in a 100 ml beaker under heating and magnetic stirring. Once all Pb(OAc)2·3H2O was dissolved and the solution temperature reached 100 °C, heating was stopped and 1.42 ml of (CH2)3NH dissolved in 3 ml of distilled water were added dropwise under stirring. Immediately a bright orange-yellow precipitate formed. The beaker was allowed to cool to room temperature and then its content was filtered with a Büchner funnel under suction. The precipitate was left under suction for 30 min without washing, and then it was kept under vacuum overnight at 100 °C to remove most of the solvent. A final drying of the product was performed in a crystallizing dish in open air at 120 °C for a few minutes until white fumes were no longer visible. A very bright yellow solid (product A) was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1A. Product recrystallization was accomplished by the vapor diffusion method, dissolving 400 mg of it in 4 ml of dry DMF, filtering the solution through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter, placing the solution in a new 20 ml glass vial and positioning the vial in a closed 100 ml Pyrex bottle containing dry acetonitrile at the bottom. After some days, ruby red acicular crystals with hexagonal sections appeared due to acetonitrile vapor dissolution in DMF (Fig. 1B). When the volume of the solution in the vial doubled, the crystals were filtered and washed with dry acetonitrile. The obtained crystals, once crushed in an agate mortar, produced a bright orange powder (product B), as shown in Fig. 2. Such a color was very different from the one of product A. The sample for the mutual solid solubility test was prepared with the same synthetic approach by simply replacing half of the (CH2)3NH with an equimolar amount of CH3NH2 and mixing the two amine solutions before the dropwise addition to the lead acetate solution in 57% HI. In this case a brownish solid was obtained. Filtration was performed when the solution was still hot in order to avoid the formation of (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O.10 The solid was dried in the same way as written above.

2.2 X-ray diffraction and non-ambient X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å) equipped with an ultra-fast X'Celerator RTMS detector (angular resolution in 2θ = 0.001°, 0.04 rad soller slit, 1° divergence slit, 20 mm mask on the incident beam path; 6.6 mm anti-scatter slit, Ni Kβ filter, and 0.04 rad collimator have been used on the diffracted beam path).
Non-ambient X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using an Anton Paar XRK 900 reactor chamber on the above diffractometer, with a factory calibrated automatic stage mover, and using a Macor glass-ceramic sample holder. The position of the sample holder was calibrated at room temperature using the 11.53° reflection of AzPbI3 powder. The experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure under He (20 cm3 min−1@STP, purity 99.999%) gas flow. The temperature scan rate was 20 K min−1 for both heating and cooling. The optics used for the non-ambient measurements were the same as the above with the exception of the incident beam path mask (15 mm instead of 20 mm).
2.3 Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA)-quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS)
Simultaneous TG-DTA measurements coupled to mass spectrometric analysis of the evolved gases on the AzPbI3 samples were performed using a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx thermal analyzer and a Balzers-Pfeiffer QMG 421 quadrupole mass spectrometer (m/z range 0–128, ionization energy 70 eV). The inlet of the mass spectrometer was connected to the outlet of the TG-DTA apparatus by means of a stainless steel capillary heated at 150 °C in order to prevent moisture condensation. The measurements were performed in sintered alumina crucibles under a flowing Ar atmosphere (85 cm3 min−1@STP, purity ≥99.9995%) with a scan rate of 10 K min−1 in the range of RT-500 °C.
2.4 Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS)
The Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS) apparatus has been thoroughly described in previous papers.11,12 The apparatus comprised of a single focusing 90° magnetic sector mass spectrometer (Patco, USA) coupled with a Knudsen molecular source. The molecular source consisted of an effusion cell (1 mm diameter effusion hole) made of high purity graphite, positioned inside a molybdenum crucible. Heating was provided to the molecular source by means of a spiral-shaped tungsten heating element shielded with multiple tantalum plates in order to ensure temperature homogeneity. The temperature of the cell was measured with an S-type thermocouple inserted in the bottom of the molybdenum crucible. Electron impact was used for the ionization of the effusing vapors (electron emission current ≈ 1.0 mA). The detector consisted of a secondary electron multiplier. Around 200 mg of product A were placed in the effusion cell and employed for the experiment. The temperature used for the experiment was 212 °C.
2.5 UV-vis spectroscopy
UV-vis spectra in reflectance mode were acquired from powdered samples using a Shimadzu (Japan) UV2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer equipped with an ISR-2600 Plus integrating sphere. BaSO4 powder was used as the reflectance reference. In order to determine the nature of the band gap (i.e. direct or indirect), its value was first extracted from the absorption edges obtained by converting the reflectance spectra in pseudoabsorbance and comparing the values to those obtained with Tauc's plots13 with different exponents.
2.6 PL measurements
Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were carried out by means of a continuous-wave frequency doubled Nd:YVO4 laser lasing at 532 nm. Samples were probed through a micro-PL configuration, in which the laser was focused by using a 100× microscope objective having a 0.9 numerical aperture (measured spot diameter 0.65 μm). The luminescence signal was collected by using the same microscope objective in a back-scattering configuration. The PL signal was then dispersed with a 0.75 m long monochromator equipped with a 300 grooves per mm grating blazed at 1 μm and collected using a liquid N2-cooled silicon CCD. The laser line in the PL signals was removed by means of razor edge optical filters with a 535 nm cut-off frequency. High quality InP (100) epilayer grown by MOVPE at 650 °C with excellent structural and optical quality was also measured for comparison purposes.
2.7 FT-IR spectroscopy
A Bruker Alpha spectrophotometer was used to acquire the FT-IR spectra in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1 with a resolution of 1 cm−1 in DRIFT mode, dispersing the powdered samples in dry KBr powder.
2.8 ESI-MS
ESI-MS analyses of products A and B dissolved in dry DMF (2.7 and 2.6 mg ml−1, respectively) were performed using a Finnigan-Mat LCQ mass spectrometer. The operating conditions were optimized for the analysis, i.e.:
(a) ESI (+) conditions: spray voltage 2.00 kV, capillary temperature 200 °C, capillary voltage 6 V, and tube lens offset −5.00 V;
(b) ESI (−) conditions: spray voltage 2.00 kV, capillary temperature 200 °C, capillary voltage −11 V, and tube lens offset 40.00 V.
The spray voltage value was chosen according to literature data.14
2.9 CHN analysis
An EA 1110 CHNS-O instrument was used to determine the C, H and N content of products A and B as well as of the black, nitric acid insoluble residue produced during TG-DTA-QMS experiments.
2.10 Resistivity and Hall effect measurements
Resistivity and Hall effect measurements were performed at room temperature using a Bio Rad Hall Profiler in the four probe configuration. The measurements were carried out on pellets (13 mm diameter, pressed with 3 tons of force) made out of product A powder. It was impossible to perform any measurements on product B crystals because their size was too small for the instrument experimental setup.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Reactivity towards water
In order to test qualitatively the stability of AzPbI3 towards water, one of the crystals attained by acetonitrile vapor diffusion was placed in a 2 ml vial filled with distilled water. The vial was closed and left undisturbed at room temperature (22 °C) for 50 days, and then it was removed and dried. As shown in Fig. 3, although most of the material had been converted into PbI2, some parts of the crystal were still bright red AzPbI3. This result demonstrates unambiguously that, at least kinetically, the material shows a remarkably higher stability compared to CH3NH3PbI3, which hydrolyzes instantaneously upon contact with liquid water.15 Considering the current lack of thermodynamic data regarding AzPbI3, a comparison with the stability of CH3NH3PbI3 towards water could not be performed. However, we plan to determine such data through an in-depth Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry study in the near future, as done previously for CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) compounds.5,6 Nonetheless, a reasonable explanation for the higher stability of AzPbI3 towards water may lie in the higher basicity of azetidine (pKb = 2.71 (ref. 16)) compared to that of methylamine (pKb = 3.36 (ref. 17)). Obviously, higher basicity leads to a lower degree of hydrolysis of the corresponding protonated form in water.

3.2 X-ray diffraction
Crystal structure solution of AzPbI3 by single crystal XRD was not possible because all the crystals tested were invariably twinned and disordered, thus supporting the hypothesis that this is an intrinsic property of the material.9 A similar behavior has been previously reported in the literature for trimethylammonium lead iodide (NH(CH3)3PbI3), whose structure solution from single crystal XRD could not be performed because of the high structural disorder.18 Therefore, as in the case of NH(CH3)3PbI3, structure solution was carried out by using powder diffraction data. A 15-hour scan over a 7.5–120° 2ϑ range (scan step 0.02° in 2ϑ) was performed on both products (A and B powders) placed in a non-orienting sample holder. The goniometer was calibrated with a factory standard made of polycrystalline silicon. The patterns are practically superimposable, except for some preferred orientation effects visible in the pattern of product B, as shown in the two panels of Fig. 4. EXPO 2014 and FOX software suites19,20 were used to solve the structure using the pattern of product A. While the determination of the cell parameters, space group and atomic positions of Pb and I atoms was straightforward using EXPO 2014, the determination of the positions of the azetidinium cations was especially challenging. This is due to two distinct effects: first, the extremely high difference in the values of atomic scattering factors between Pb and I on one side and N and C on the other. Second, the disorder of the cationic sublattice. Using the structure obtained considering only Pb and I atoms, all the peaks in the patterns were indexed with very good agreement, as shown in the Le Bail fit (Fig. S1,†Rp = 3.101, Rwp = 4.696, and RBragg = 2.127). The Pb–I skeleton is depicted in Fig. 5, panel A. AzPbI3 presents a quite particular crystal structure, with a large rhombohedral unit cell and is stretched along the c axis (space group R: H (148), a = b = 9.08519 Å, c = 35.06901 Å). Indeed, the unit cell contains 9 formula units in which the PbI6 blocks are arranged in groups of 3 face sharing octahedra positioned in a zig-zag fashion along the c axis. The groups are organized in blocks composed of four parallel units aligned relatively to the ab plane along the c axis direction. It is worth noting that, while the central octahedron in the groups of 3 octahedra is regular, the side ones are slightly distorted, the Pb–I distances being different for the iodine atoms in the planes positioned over and under the Pb atom in the c axis direction. This phenomenon indicates that the Pb atoms in the side octahedra experience the effect of 6s2 lone pairs. In order to locate the Az+ cations, a Fourier synthesis was performed by calculating Fobs − Fcalc. The result is shown in Fig. 5, panel B. The positions attained by the Fourier synthesis are exactly as many as needed to compensate the number of unit formulas per unit cell. Hence, by using the FOX software suite, starting from the model shown in Fig. 5B we tried to solve the whole structure, trying to locate the positions of azetidinium cations but without success. Therefore we positioned N atoms in the sites found by the Fourier synthesis (we choose N instead of C because the positions are nearer to negatively charged I atoms than to Pb atoms) and after refining the structure, we performed a Le Bail fit (both using EXPO 2014). The obtained result is better than that obtained with only Pb and I (Fig. S2,†Rp = 2.292, Rwp = 3.371, and RBragg = 0.055). The very different values of the thermal B-factors for the two N atoms in the asymmetric unit (2.28975 for N1 and 14.08590 for N2) are indicative of the fact that the N2 position is more probably the center of gravity of the azetidinium ion than the position of a N atom. Nevertheless, in order to achieve a complete solution of the structure of AzPbI3 which includes the positions of the azetidinium ions, a neutron powder diffraction experiment is mandatory, considering the impossibility of obtaining single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction.

3.3 TG-DTA-QMS

Fig. 6 and 7 report the TG-DTA profiles of products A and B, respectively. Their behavior is highly similar as shown by the comparison of their respective TG profiles in Fig. 8, which differ only by a slightly higher final weight loss in the case of product A. Both products started dropping weight around 225–230 °C and the loss continued throughout the experiment, though the rate decreased substantially above 400 °C. The occurrence of these thermal events is confirmed with the DTA patterns, in which an abrupt transition in the thermal signal is noticeable at about 220–230 °C, whereas a constant slope is observed above 400 °C. The high PbI2 vapor pressure (1.33 × 10−4 bar at 400 °C) is most likely responsible for the mass loss above 400 °C that can be reasonably attributed to the PbI2 vaporization. Under the same conditions, AzPbI3 starts decomposing at a slightly lower temperature than CH3NH3PbI3 (250 °C (ref. 21)) This fact is not surprising, considering that the methylamine formation reaction from the elements is slightly exothermic but slightly endergonic (,  (ref. 22 and 23)), whereas the corresponding reaction for the azetidine is both highly endothermic and endergonic (,  (ref. 23 and 24)). Such an explanation is also suggested by the two perovskites with different decomposition mechanisms. While CH3NH3PbI3 cleanly decomposes to give solid PbI2, gaseous CH3NH2, and HI or CH3I and NH3, depending on the experimental conditions,4,6 the decomposition path of AzPbI3 seems to be more complicated. Besides PbI2, a black solid insoluble in hot 65% HNO3 was collected from the remaining solid phase. This solid, as demonstrated by CHN analysis (see below) contains a high percentage of carbon (the TG-DTA head itself was found darkened after the measurement). In addition, the gaseous phase released during the decomposition appears to be quite complex. The moments corresponding to the reference mass spectra (i.e. at the beginning of the TG-DTA experiments) and the moments of maximum intensities of ionic currents due to the gaseous products are displayed in Fig. 6 and 7. The reference spectra are reported in panel A of Fig. 9 and 10, while the spectra corresponding to maximum gaseous emissions are shown in panel B of Fig. 9 and 10 for products A and B, respectively. A difference between these last spectra and the corresponding references are given in panel C of Fig. 9 and 10. The graphs in panel C of Fig. 9 and 10 are nearly superimposable. High temperature pyrolysis of azetidine is reported to produce methyleneimine and ethylene.24 Nevertheless, a cross check of Fig. 9 and 10 with the NIST Chemistry WebBook mass spectra database25 suggests that the probable composition of the evolved gases is comprised of a mixture of butene isomers (m/z = 56, and 55), propene (m/z = 41, 42, and 39), ethylene (m/z = 28, 27, 26, and 25), methyleneimine (m/z = 29), nitrogen (m/z = 28) and acetylene (m/z = 26). The other peaks with lower m/z values are ascribable to other fragments of the same gases (m/z = 15, the most intense one, probably stems from the CH3+ ion that is a fragment of butenes and propene). The m/z = 127 peak clearly belongs to the I+ ion. However, the origin of this signal cannot be attributed to any species (HI, I2 or halocarbons) because of the upper instrumental m/z limit being equal to 128. Mass spectra possessing reasonable intensities were collected only in the final stages of the mass loss. Thus, a Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry investigation regarding the decomposition of AzPbI3 was performed in order to gain an understanding of the composition of the gaseous mixture during the first few stages of the process.

3.4 Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS)
The Knudsen effusion mass spectrum, obtained by using an electron energy of 70 eV is displayed in Fig. 11. The striking difference between these data and those acquired by TG-DTA-QMS suggests that the decomposition path, and thus the composition of the gases evolved by the decomposition reaction is temperature dependent. The most relevant peaks detected are those with m/z values 14, 30, 43, 58, 128 and 142. The most probable attributions of these peaks are CH2+, CH2NH2+, C2H4NH2+, Az+, HI+ and CH3I+ ions, respectively. The CH2+ ion is a common and noninformative fragment. On the other hand, plenty of information can be extracted from the remaining fragments. Indeed, during the AzPbI3 decomposition, the azetidine molecule (or the azetidinium ion) leaves the solid in some intact form, which is verified by the presence of the Az+ ion, and, indirectly, by the CH2NH2+ ions; the latter being a common fragment in mass spectra of aliphatic amines. No information can be gained from the I+ ion (m/z = 127) because it stems from HI. The C2H4NH2+ and the CH3I+ ions could be ascribed to the fragmentation and/or decomposition of the AzI molecule (ionic couple) or of 3-iodopropan-1-amine, which can be produced by the nucleophilic attack of the I− ion on one of the alpha carbon atoms in the azetidinium cation. An indication of whether the AzI ionic couple or 3-iodopropan-1-amine was lost was achieved by acquiring a mass spectrum with a lower electron energy, i.e. 23 eV (not shown). At this energy, the m/z = 185 was clearly visible, favoring the loss of AzI over 3-aminoiodopropane, ionic couples being more prone to fragmentation at high ionization energies than covalent molecules. In addition, at 23 eV, the peaks due to m/z = 43 and 142 disappear, whereas the peak at m/z = 57 becomes more intense than the m/z = 58 one. The peaks due to m/z = 30 and 128 remain the most intense. This is a clear proof that C2H4NH2+ and the CH3I+ are simply fragments formed in the ion source rather than the first ionization forms of the decomposition products. Therefore, according to the available information at temperatures where the reaction starts becoming observable by TG-DTA (and temperature controlled XRD), the thermal decomposition of AzPbI3 proceeds through the loss of azetidine as an AzI ionic couple and possibly as azetidine and HI. Conversely, at higher temperatures the very different mass spectra obtained by TG-DTA-QMS, together with the formation of the carbonaceous residue, are indicative of extensive pyrolysis due to the high thermodynamic instability of azetidine, provided that a sufficiently high temperature to overcome the kinetic barrier is reached.

3.5 Temperature controlled XRD
In order to get a deeper insight into the solid phase transformations associated with the thermal decomposition process, XRD patterns were taken at different temperatures (220, 237 °C) and at room temperature after quenching the sample from high temperature (5 minutes treatment at 277, 321, 363, and 414 °C, respectively). The temperatures were all chosen to match those of the TG events (all onset points, with the exception of 363 °C, inflection point, and 414 °C, and end of mass loss). Since, at high temperature, the decomposition reaction is faster than the XRD data collection, a quenching procedure was required for temperatures ≥277 °C. A further experiment was performed by acquiring diffraction patterns at temperatures below the first thermal event detected in the TG-DTA measurements, at 150 and 200 °C. All the patterns are shown in the ESI, Fig. S3–S11.† The diffractograms of the untreated sample at room temperature and heated at 150 °C (Fig. S3 and S4,† respectively) are practically identical except for the expected peak shifts towards lower angles at higher temperature due to the thermal dilation of the unit cell. At 200 °C (Fig. S5†) the sample started showing evident signs of degradation (further deteriorating during the measurement) with the appearance of the peaks of rhombohedral PbI2. This difference compared to the TG behavior is to be ascribed to the different temperature exposure conditions; while during TG the sample was experiencing a temperature scan in a relatively short time, during the XRD measurements it was kept under isothermal conditions for more than 1 h. This hypothesis is also verified by the fact that in the patterns taken at 220 and 237 °C the peaks belonging to AzPbI3 are no longer visible and only the PbI2 peaks are present.
After treatments at higher temperatures and quenching, the peaks of hexagonal PbI2 appeared. Their intensity turned out to be higher than the peaks of the rhombohedral phase as the treatment temperature increased. After the treatment at 277 °C, the XRD patterns became increasingly ill-defined. The reason for such a behavior was discovered after removing the sample holder from the environmental chamber: the sample swelled (appearing as a shiny black mass), getting out of focus. Hence, it was crushed in an agate mortar revealing yellow crystals underneath the black coating. This result supports the hypothesis on the nature of the black, nitric acid-insoluble residue obtained from the TG-DTA experiments (see CHN analysis section). Consequently, a new XRD pattern was collected by using the diffractometer in normal (i.e. without the environmental chamber) operation mode (Fig. S12†). As expected, only the peaks of the hexagonal and rhombohedral PbI2 were detected, with a further intensity increase for the peaks of the hexagonal phase. No peaks attributable to crystalline carbon phases were detected, thus indicating the amorphous nature of the carbonaceous residue formed during the AzPbI3 decomposition process. It is worth noting that after the measurements were performed at 150 and 200 °C, though the sample was clearly decomposed (as demonstrated by its XRD pattern), no carbonaceous residue was present, the sample being bright yellow as expected for PbI2. This is a further confirmation of the fact that the decomposition path of AzPbI3 is temperature dependent.
3.6 UV-vis spectroscopy
Pseudoabsorbance (Kubelka–Munk function) spectra of the both A and B products are reported in Fig. 12, while their Tauc's plots are shown in Fig. 13. The differences in their behavior are quite surprising. First, the number of detectable transitions, 3 well defined (maxima at 504, 476, and 429 nm) and 2 poorly defined (maxima at 369 and 283 nm) for product A; 4 well defined (maxima at 554, 503, 462 and 431 nm) and 2 poorly defined (maxima at 368 and 289 nm). Second, their band gaps are different in both values and nature: 2.37 ± 0.01 eV, direct allowed for product A and 1.97 ± 0.01 eV, indirect allowed for product B. These dissimilarities, together with the different emission behaviors that will be shown in the PL section, are a clear indication of the differences existing in the band structure between the two solids. Excluding structural (by XRD) and chemical differences between the samples (by FT-IR, ESI-MS and CHN analyses), the only reasonable explanation lies in the different degrees of disorder in the cationic sublattice. Organoammonium lead halides are known to possess orientationally disordered ammonium cations.26 Besides the orientational disorder, the cations in AzPbI3 may also have a positional disorder originating from its rather open structure characterized by large cavities. Such a disorder is not detectable neither by XRD nor through FT-IR. In fact, the contribution of the Az+ cations to the diffraction pattern is negligible compared to that of Pb and I, these being the last heavy atoms. Needless to say, FT-IR and chemical analysis are sensitive only to compositional changes and, therefore, are not able to detect the positional disorder. The plausibility of this explanation lies in the fact that while product A crystallizes in a time range of seconds, product B takes days to form, thus allowing for a more ordered array of cations. On the other hand, the anionic sublattice is not much influenced by the crystallization time, as demonstrated by the practically identical XRD powder patterns of products A and B.

3.7 PL measurements

Fig. 14 shows μ-PL spectra collected at room temperature from product A (yellow line), product B (red line), and an InP epilayer (purple line) with a laser power excitation equal to 1 kW cm−2. The InP epilayer PL spectrum is divided by a factor of 100 for comparison purposes. The as-prepared sample (product A) emits at 718 nm and at a lower energy than the recrystallized product (B), which emits at 580 nm. Both materials show good PL emission intensities. The integrated areas are 1% and 4% of the InP emission area for products A and B, respectively. In order to investigate the origin of the emissions, a PL study was performed on both samples by varying the excitation power of the laser source while keeping the same experimental configuration. The power studies carried out on products A and B are reported in Fig. S13 and S14 of the ESI,† respectively. All the spectra were separately normalized for clarity purpose (intensity factors are reported). Neither A nor B PL spectra showed meaningful variations upon a 20-fold change of the laser excitation power. Therefore, it can be concluded that the broad emissions in the PL spectra of samples are not brought about by shallow defects. A similar effect is also observed in III–V semiconductors. In contrast, we suppose that broad bands in products A and B are due either to the different crystal disorder of the cationic sublattice or to some channels that allow for carrier relaxation into deep states in the middle of the band gap. Such phenomena, already reported in the literature,27 are likely responsible for the broad PL peaks of our samples and the first one gives further support to the hypothesis of different degrees of disorder of the cationic sublattice between products A and B.

3.8 FT-IR spectroscopy
The spectra of products A and B are compared in Fig. 15. They show a high degree of similarity. The only relevant difference is due to the water bands (ω < 840 and ω > 3230 cm−1 and the peak around ω = 1650 cm−1). This is not surprising, considering that product A was dried at 120 °C while product B was not. All the other bands in the spectra can be assigned unambiguously to the azetidinium cations28–30 and their broadness is a clear indication of their orientational disorder.31 The shift of the positions of the peaks compared to those of azetidine30 stems from the protonation of azetidine and from the interaction of the azetidinium cation with the anionic sublattice.32 Obviously, the vibrations of the Pb–I skeleton are not visible in the explored wavenumber range.
 Fig. 15  DRIFT spectra of products A and B. 
3.9 ESI-MS
The chemical identity of products A and B is validated using their positive and negative ion ESI mass spectra (Fig. S15 and S16 in the ESI†). Besides the Az+ peak, the positive ion spectra show only signals belonging to the Na+ and Az+ adducts with DMF. In the negative ion spectra just the peak of the PbI3− ion was detected.
3.10 CHN analysis
Both products A and B show CHN contents in good agreement with the theoretical composition of (CH2)3NH2PbI3 (product A: C = 5.45%, H = 1.30%, and N = 2.14%; product B: C = 5.65%; H = 1.36%; N = 2.23%; theoretical: C = 5.58%, H = 1.25%, and N = 2.17%). Thus relevant differences in the overall composition of the organic part of the compound can be ruled out. The black, nitric acid-insoluble residue produced during the TG-DTA-QMS experiments contains a high percentage of carbon and minor quantities of nitrogen and hydrogen (C = 46.35%, N = 5.17%, H = 2.05%). Therefore, it is probably made of PbI2 particles encapsulated in a carbonaceous matrix doped with nitrogen and hydrogen. The encapsulation of PbI2 particles keeps them from dissolving in HNO3. A more detailed investigation of this material was impeded by the very small quantity we had been able to accumulate (∼0.2 mg).
3.11 Solid solution behavior with CH3NH3PbI3

Fig. 16 displays the XRD pattern of the product obtained by co-precipitating CH3NH3PbI3 with AzPbI3. The dominant phase is AzPbI3, but peaks belonging to CH3NH3PbI3 are also visible. The peaks of both phases are relevantly shifted towards higher 2ϑ values for AzPbI3 and to lower values for CH3NH3PbI3. In fact, for the pure phases the cell parameters are a = 8.8743 Å, c = 12.6708 Å and a = 9.08519 Å, c = 35.06901 Å for CH3NH3PbI3 and AzPbI3, respectively. Conversely, in the co-precipitation product they are a = 8.961 Å, c = 12.680 Å and a = 9.0712 Å, c = 35.095 Å, as calculated through the Rietveld analysis of the diffraction pattern (performed using MAUD software33). These variations correspond to unit cell volume changes of +20.3 Å3 and −5.9 Å3, respectively. For both phases such variations can be attributed to saturated solid solutions of the Az+ cation in CH3NH3PbI3, and of the CH3NH3+ cation in AzPbI3. Otherwise a homogeneous phase would be found (instead of the two experimentally observed). Although a measurement of the maximum mutual solubilities cannot be performed with the available data, a rough estimation of their values can be done if some (reasonable) assumptions are made. First, the unit cell volume variation is assumed due only to the variation of the sum of the volumes of the cations due to substitution per unit cell (obviously the total number of cations per unit cell remains constant). Second is that cations are assumed to be spherical because of their orientational disorder. Hence, the unit cell volume variation ΔV can be approximated by using the formula: ΔV = Vf − Vi = (n − x)a + xb − na = x(b − a)(1)Where n is the total number of cations per unit cell, x the number of “solute” cations per unit cell, Vi and Vf the pure and solid solution total cationic volumes, respectively, a the “solvent” cation volume and b the “solute” cation volume. As it follows: (2)
 Fig. 16  Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the product obtained by coprecipitation of AzPbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3. 
By using the available literature values for methylammonium and azetidinium ionic radii (2.17 and 2.50 Å, respectively8), the maximum percentage of Az+ that can replace the CH3NH3+ in CH3NH3PbI3 is about 22%, while the value for CH3NH3+ cations in the AzPbI3 is about 3%. This significant difference in their respective mutual solubilities is expected. It is well known, indeed, that in ionic structures, cations may occupy sites smaller than their size by expanding their host structure, while they do not tend to occupy sites exceeding their dimensions.34 By considering the UV-vis spectrum of the product (Fig. S17 in the ESI†), the gaps of both the constituting phases are clearly observable (for AzPbI3 this is nearly identical to the value of product A, 2.36 ± 0.01 eV, while for CH3NH3PbI3 it is 1.57 ± 0.01 eV vs. 1.53 eV for the pure compound21). The lack of a relevant shift in the absorption edge of the saturated solid solution of Az+ in CH3NH3PbI3 compared to the pure phase is important with respect to photovoltaic applications. In fact, it demonstrates that the incorporation of the Az+ cation is not detrimental in terms of light absorption properties even at high concentration.
3.12 Resistivity and Hall effect measurements
As stated in Section 2.10, the measurements were performed on pressed pellets of product A, the crystals (product B) being too small to be used with the available instrument. Interestingly, during the pellet pressing procedure, product A tends to transform into product B (its color shows partial changes from the one shown in Fig. 1A to the one of Fig. 2). This is a further indication of the higher cationic sublattice disorder of product A that, under high pressure, rearranges to a less disordered and more compact structure. The material turned out to be highly resistive (resistivity 8 × 104 Ω cm), with negative sign carriers (electrons). The concentration of active carriers is in the order of 1012 cm−3 and their mobility is ∼46 cm2 V−1 s. Such values are in line with those found for similar compounds.35 Resistivity, carrier density, and mobility can be considered ‘average values’ stemming from the combination of both structures due to the pressure induced conversion of product A into B. Nevertheless we do not expect significant differences between the two products.
4. Conclusion
Azetidinium lead iodide (CH2)3NH2PbI3 was successfully synthesized and characterized by a wide range of techniques. Although the azetidinium cation has a calculated ionic radius suitable for producing a perovskite structure with Pb and I, the determined structure is rhombohedral with an unusually long c axis, containing 9 formula units. The optical properties of the material are highly sensitive to the synthesis conditions, resulting in different absorption and emission spectra for differently prepared samples. This effect is very probably related to a modulation of the cationic sublattice disorder, as inferred by the photoluminescence spectra. AzPbI3 is thermally stable up to 200 °C and displays a temperature dependent decomposition behavior. The material shows higher moisture stability compared to methylammonium lead iodide perovskites. This property, in conjunction with the high solubility of the azetidinium cation in the CH3NH3PbI3 structure and its very limited influence on the band gap value of the latter, may be beneficial for the fabrication of devices with enhanced stability.
