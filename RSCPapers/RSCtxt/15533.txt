    , Accepted 8th March 2011First published on 22nd March 2011AbstractNovel low band gap copolymers based on dithienosilole and thienopyrroledione units were synthesized. Copolymer P1 with branched side chains on the TPD units demonstrated a PCE of 4.4% with a high Voc of 0.89 V for OPV applications while OTFT devices fabricated from a copolymer containing linear side chains (P2) performed better in OTFT device configurations.
Each day the sun delivers sufficient energy to meet the annual human demand to the cluster of the Earth. Various research efforts have been focused on harvesting this energy into sustainable energy resources.1 Among these, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are one of the most versatile and promising technologies for providing cost-effective power generation by uniting low-cost solution-based manufacturing techniques to provide mechanically flexible and light weight solar cells for a variety of applications. Intensive research efforts have led to a significant increase in their power conversion efficiencies (PCE) over the past decade.1–4 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been extensively studied and its PCEs have reached 4–6% after process optimizations.5 One area where P3HT falls short is, however, its absorption spectral mismatch with the spectrum of photon flux of sunlight. The solar spectrum spans the range of 350 to 3000 nm with a maximum peak at about 680 nm while absorption of P3HT only covers a fraction of this range (300 to 700 nm). Thus, it is crucial to develop new low optical band gap polymers with appropriate electric energy levels capable of increased light harvesting. To this end, the donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy demonstrated itself to be an efficient approach, in which conjugated electron rich (donor) and electron deficient (acceptor) units are alternatively copolymerized to optimize the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) via internal charge transfer (ICT).4,6 For example, electron-deficient units such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), 3,6-diaryl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4,-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate have been successfully employed to produce efficient active polymer layers in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. When they are copolymerized with carbazole,7dithienosilole (DTS),8cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),8 or benzodithiophene (BDT),3,11 their PCEs are reaching up to 7% after process optimizations.9

        Thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) has recently shown promise as a building block for organic solar cells due to its symmetric and coplanar structure with strong electron-withdrawing properties.10 In recent simultaneous works, researchers demonstrated very promising PCEs from a donor–acceptor copolymer (PBDTTPD) based on BDT and TPD units. By elaborated side chain engineering and device optimizations, PCEs up to 6.8% have been reported.10e–g It is worth noting that these polymers possess low lying HOMO levels which contribute to the high open circuit voltages (Voc) and PCEs. Moreover the unusual “face-on” backbone orientations were observed in the thin film of PBDTTPD.10g In order to further improve light harvesting of TPD based polymers, alternating copolymers based on DTS as electron-donating units and TPD as electron-accepting units (P1 and P2) were designed and synthesized (Scheme 1). Dithienosilole (DTS) is another versatile p-type building block for the development of D–A copolymers for OSCs.8 When it was copolymerized with the electron withdrawing BT units, the resulting copolymers, Si-PCPDTBT, showed PCEs up to 5.9%.8 Moreover, the optical band gap of Si-PCPDTBT was further lowered by 0.25 V compared to that of a copolymer (BDT-BT) based on BDT and BT units.8,11 Although the DTS unit has stronger electron donating capabilities relative to the BDT unit,12 the copolymers did not show significant effects on HOMO levels. Both of the polymers showed very similar Voc, and improved light harvesting of Si-PCPDTBT by lowering its band gap has led to significant increase of Jsc.11b

The simple chemistry for the introduction of various side chains on the imide nitrogen of TPD units allows us to examine the effect of side chain engineering in this promising class of TPD monomers on the performance of BHJ solar cells and OTFT devices. To evaluate the effect of different side chains on the thin film morphologies and device performance, two types of alkyl chains were chosen; a branched 2-ethylhexyl- (P1) and a linear dodecyl group (P2). Both of the copolymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and o-dichlorobenzne (DCB). The molecular weights of P1 and P2 were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using THF as the eluent and are summarized in Table 1. Since both of the copolymers have relatively similar molecular weights, the effect of molecular weight on their device performance could be minimized. The thermal analysis of the polymers was carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (ESI†, Fig. S1 and S2). The result showed good thermal stability of both of the polymers over 400 °C and no obvious thermal transition was observed between 50 and 350 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 1(a) shows the absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in dilute chlorobenzene and in the solid state. The UV-vis absorption of P1 and P2 in solution showed no noticeable difference with that of the thin film spectra, suggesting some degree of aggregation in both states at room temperature.10a,f The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the optical absorption edges (Fig. S3, ESI†). The discrepancy between the optical and electrochemical band gaps was observed in our system as in other reports and presumably due to the exciton binding energies of polymers and/or the interface barrier for charge injection.13 The optical band gaps of P1 and P2 were identical, 1.7 eV. As expected, the band gap of P1 and P2 was ∼0.1 eV smaller than that of PBDTTPD (∼1.8 eV).10e–g The electrochemical measurement, however, showed slight rise of HOMO levels due to stronger electron donating properties of DTS units.12 Interestingly, the rise of HOMO level has minimum effect on Voc in the BHJ devices as shown in Table 2. Both of the polymers (P1 and P2) showed very high Voc (0.81–0.89 V) comparable to Voc of PBDTTPD (0.84–0.87 V).10e–g The hole mobilities of the polymers were measured from the transfer characteristics of bottom gate top contact field effect transistors (FETs) using gold as the source-drain electrodes and are summarized in Table 1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Both P1 and P2polymer thin film mobilities were within the range that requires efficient OSC performance.14 Thermal treatment of the film at 200 °C had minimal effect on the OTFT characteristics. The independence of the carrier mobility by thermal annealing is well matched with our DSC results in which no thermal transitions were detected within the range of the study (50 to 350 °C). The improved TFT characteristics of P2 over that of P1 may be a result of improved polymer order in the film due to the linear chains on TPD units. Film microstructures were further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and both P1 and P2 appeared amorphous and showed no noticeable Bragg diffraction peaks, which is in agreement with the absence of crystallization and melting transitions in the thermal analysis study. This may indicate that both of the polymer films have very poor long-range order in the solid state as supported by the lack of a significant red shift between the solution and solid state UV-vis spectra. The amorphous nature of the polymers can minimize dependency of the device fabrication process on BHJ device performance.10a,15

Photovoltaic properties of P1 and P2 were investigated with the following general device structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Ag. PC71BM was employed as the acceptor due to its broad absorption in the visible region (Fig. 1b). Details of device fabrication and characterization are summarized in the ESI.† The morphological evolution in BHJ solar cells is crucial for their performance and it has been reported that the addition of the process additives to the blend solution before spin-casting into the films significantly affects the efficiency of the resulting organic solar cell performance.3,7,10g,16 Indeed, the addition of additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, bp 327 °C) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN, bp 263 °C) into the blend solutions improved our photovoltaic efficiency by up to 10%. Further investigation of the effects of the additives on the surface morphologies was conducted by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM). AFM micrographs were collected from the optimized devices of P1 with and without the additives. As shown in Fig. S6, ESI†, the addition of the additives improves the nanophase separations and surface roughness, and the surface image of the best device with 3% CN additive shows the clear and more interconnected nanophase which results in a higher photocurrent and the highest PCE. Fig. 2 shows a typical current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the BHJ device of P1 and P2. The BHJ device fabricated from P1∶PC71BM blend solution with 3% CN shows a Voc of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.4 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 52% and a resulting PCE of 4.4%. The Voc of this BHJ device is comparable to those of polymers PBDTTPD (0.84–0.87 V) and much higher than that of other DTS-based polymers (∼0.6 V).8 The UV-vis spectrum of the device shows very broad absorption between 400 and 730 nm and the improved absorption in the visible region due to PC71BM could be observed. Comparison of P1 and P2 device performance indicates that the branched side chain on TPD units has positive effects on the BHJ solar cell device performance in contrast to OTFT characteristics. These results are also contrary to the report based on PBDTTPD, in which the polymer backbone has unusual ‘face on’ orientation resulting in excellent PCEs. However, the out of plane orientation of the alkyl chains on the DTS units might hinder such an orientation for P1 and P2 leading to preferential ‘edge-on’ orientation as in most of the semiconductor polymers. The better performance of the BHJ device with P1 over P2 indicates that the branched side chains on TPD units increase the solubility of P1, thus improve the compatibility of PCBM into the polymer blends. An AFM micrograph of P1 shows clear nanophase separation with a RMS roughness of 2.2 nm while the surface image of P2 shows aggregates with a larger surface roughness of 4.1 nm. Indeed, while P1 showed optimized photovoltaic performance using a ratio of 1∶1 (wt/wt) P1∶PC71BM mixture, twice more loading of PC71BM into P2 blend solutions was required to obtain optimized photovoltaic performance and efficient interpenetrating networks in the thin film. During the preparation of this manuscript, Jen et al. have recently reported a similar TPD based D–A copolymer using the DTS units with branched chains showing a PCE of 2.13%.17 We were able to obtain twice the PCE presumably due to improved morphology within the film demonstrating the importance of appropriate side chain engineering on the final performance of semiconductor polymers.

In summary, we have demonstrated that stronger electron donating ability of the DTS units widens the absorption spectrum of the resulting copolymers and improves the light harvesting properties of TPD based D–A copolymers without significant effect on Voc compared to PBDTTPD. While the linear chains on TPD units generally provide better performances in OTFT device configurations, the branched side chains on TPD units improve the compatibility of PC71BM into the blend film resulting in higher PCEs in BHJ solar cells. The best device after process optimization shows up to 4.4% PCE. Our result herein provides additional important insights into both the molecular and macromolecular design of new TPD based D–A polymers for the development of high performance organic solar cells.
