1 Introduction
With the continuous development of society, the demand for energy is increasing daily. However, the wide use of fossil fuels to meet the energy demands produces a significant amount of pollutants when they are burned, resulting in a huge negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, fossil fuel resources are quickly being depleted. Thus, it is an urgent issue to find novel non-polluting, efficient green energy sources.1–6 In this case, various renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy have become important energy sources. However, there are many challenges that limit their application. Specifically, it is difficult for the above-mentioned energy sources to meet the needs of human production and life lastingly and stably due to their characteristics of being insufficient and unbalanced during different seasons in different places.7–14 Thus, a widely used strategy to overcome this limitation is the conversion of the above-mentioned energies into easy-to-store electrical energy, where various power generation and energy storage components that realize this function have become the key to obtaining electrical energy with high efficiency and low loss.
Among the various energy storage systems, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are commercially used in various electronic devices due to their long cycle life, high energy density, and high output voltage. However, there is a low abundance of lithium resource in the Earth's crust and it is unevenly distributed, increasing its price rapidly, and thus it is difficult to meet the current rapidly growing demand.15–21 Alternatively, potassium is an alkali metal element with abundant reserves in the Earth.22 Also, it is in the same main group as lithium in the periodic table. Thus, they have similar chemical properties, where the redox potential of Li+/Li is −3.04 V, while the redox potential of K+/K is −2.94 V relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.23–28 Alternatively, the Stokes radius of the potassium ion in both aqueous and some non-aqueous solvents (such as carbonate esters) is smaller than that of the lithium ion, and its diffusion rate and molar conductivity in solvent are higher. Also, potassium metal does not react with aluminum to form an alloy based on thermodynamics, and thus the cheap aluminum foil can be used instead of copper foil as the current collector, reducing the cost of batteries. Therefore, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are expected to become an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries and have received extensive attention from researchers.29,30
Potassium is below lithium in the periodic table, and thus the radius of potassium ions is much larger than that of lithium ions, leading to their sluggish movement inside crystals. Consequently, during the charging and discharging process, the volume change of the electrode material caused by the insertion and extraction of potassium ions is much larger than that of LIBs. This results in a poor cycle performance and low specific capacity, limiting the commercial applications of PIBs. Thus, the development of high-performance electrode materials has become the focus of research.31,32
At present, the most studied cathode materials for PIBs include layered transition metal oxides,33–37 poly-anionic compounds,38–42 organic materials,43–47 and Prussian blue analogs (PBAs).48–50 Compared with the above-mentioned cathode materials, PBAs have become a research hotspot as electrode materials for PIBs. Also, PBAs have a higher working voltage, larger interstitial space and lower cost. Meanwhile, they have a high initial potassium ion content, relatively stable three-dimensional framework structure and reversible specific capacity (Fig. 1).

In this review, we present the structure and charge–discharge reaction mechanism of all the reported PBAs. The characteristics and research progress are classified and compared according to the different transition metals, i.e., iron-based, manganese-based, cobalt-based, nickel-based and other materials. Subsequently, the synthesis methods that influence different factors such as water content, vacancy, crystallinity, and particle size that affect the properties of PBAs are introduced. Next, their improvement methods and electrochemical performance are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are provided on the future development of Prussian blue analogs for PIBs.
2 Structure of PBAs
PBAs are a general term for a class of transition metal cyanides, and their chemical formula can be represented by AxM[M′(CN)6]y□1−y·mH2O, where A is an alkali metal element (0 ≤ x ≤ 2); M is a transition metal element such as iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc; M′ is usually iron, and □ stands for vacancy.51–54 It can be easily found that PBAs share a similar chemical formula with Prussian white analogs (PWAs), i.e., KxMFe(CN)6·mH2O (M = Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu). PWAs can be regarded as a subclass of PBAs, where the main difference between them is their content of potassium ions. In this case, PWAs usually have more potassium ions in their crystals than that in PBAs.
PBAs are mostly perovskite crystals with a face-centered cubic structure. In these crystals, each M′ ion coordinates with the C atoms in the 6 adjacent CN− ions, and each M ion coordinates with the N atoms in the 6 adjacent CN− ions (Fig. 2a), thereby forming a three-dimensional, open framework structure. Potassium ions can quickly enter or leave the interstitial space through three-dimensional ion channels. The crystal structure of monoclinic PBAs is presented in Fig. 2b. Fig. 2c illustrates the reversible structural transition from monoclinic system to cubic system during the insertion/extraction of potassium ions. PBAs have a high potassium ion diffusion speed and good rate capability. Also, the 3D framework structure formed by the M ion and M′ ion and CN− ion in the form of 6 coordination can alleviate the damage from potassium ion insertion and extraction in the crystal structure to a certain extent. Thus, the volume change in PBA cathode materials after multiple cycles is small, enabling them to exhibit a better cycle stability and longer cycle life. Compared with other cathode materials for PIBs, most PBAs have two redox active sites (M and M′) and a larger capacity of 155 mA h g−1.55

By changing the type and number of M ions in PBAs, their crystal structure can be changed, thereby endowing PBAs with different properties. In fact, the superior limit value and the number of charge–discharge plateaus depend on the metal centers. In the following sections, M in PBAs will be employed as the classification standard to discuss their characteristics and electrochemical properties under different components.
3 PBAs with different redox-active transition metals
3.1 Iron-based PBAs
Iron-based Prussian blue analog (Fe-PBA) cathode materials are the most widely studied PBA materials for potassium-ion batteries, which can date back to 2004. The electrochemical performance of an example of Fe-PBAs is shown in Fig. 2d. These materials usually have the characteristics of two charge–discharge plateaus, high capacity, large operating voltage window, good cycle stability and excellent electrochemical performance.
Taking the K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] material as an example, the electrode equation during the charging and discharging process is as follows:K2FeII[FeII(CN)6] → K+ + KFeIII[FeII(CN)6] + e−KFeIII[FeII(CN)6] → K+ + FeIII[FeIII(CN)6] + e−FeIII[FeIII(CN)6] + e− + K+ → KFeIII[FeII(CN)6]KFeIII[FeII(CN)6] + e− + K+ → K2FeII[FeII(CN)6]
Early in 2004, Eftekhari's group48 reported the electrochemical synthesis of the Fe-PBA material KFe[Fe(CN)6] using a platinum electrode as the substrate. Subsequently, they assembled a potassium ion battery with the Fe-PBAs material as the positive electrode, potassium as the negative electrode, and 1 M KBF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate (3:7) as the electrolyte. It exhibited an initial specific capacity of about 79 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention rate of about 88% after 500 cycles, revealing its great potential application. However, the electrochemical synthesis method is complex and expensive, which limit its application to a certain extent. Thus, improving the synthesis methods may realize cheaper and better Fe-PBAs.
The particle size of Fe-PBAs influences their electrochemical properties. For example, He's group56 synthesized three types of Fe-PBAs with different particle sizes via the precipitation method. Among the PBAs, that with a particle size of less than 20 nm (K1.69Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.90·0.4H2O) showed the best performance. Its initial discharge capacity was 140 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1 and its capacity remained around 60% after 300 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Fig. 2e–j clearly show that as the particle size increased, the capacity decreased rapidly, and the charge–discharge capacity of the micron-scale material was only about 10 mA h g−1 in the first cycle.
The influence of crystallinity on the electrochemical performance of Fe-PBAs is significant. Li et al.57 used different concentrations of hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mol L−1) to produce a gradient acidic environment. Based on the concentrations of hydrochloric acid, the six prepared samples were labelled as KFe(0), KFe(0.2), KFe(0.5), KFe(1.0), KFe(1.5), and KFe(2.0) and Fig. 2k–p show their SEM images, respectively. Their electrochemical performance was tested in a three-electrode system with 1 M potassium nitrate solution as the aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 2q and r). Among them, sample labelled KFe(1.0) whose chemical formula is K1.93Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.97·1.82H2O showed best electrochemical performance. Its reversible discharge specific capacity was 142 mA h g−1 at a current density of 75 mA g−1 and its capacity retention rate after 300 cycles at a current density of 1500 mA g−1 was 88%. Furthermore, it still maintained a capacity of 40 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 9 A g−1, revealing its good rate capability and cycle stability. They found that high crystallinity favors the structural stability of the electrode material. Therefore, the preparation of high-crystallinity materials can address the dissolution issue to improve the structural stability, and subsequently the cycle stability.
Ma's group58 reported the preparation of nano-K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] via an improved electrostatic spray-assisted precipitation method protected by an inert gas, and the chemical formula obtained by elemental analysis was K1.56Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.89□0.11·1.86H2O. Its specific surface area reached 104.31 m2 g−1 and its particle size was about 20 nm (Fig. 3a and b). A half-cell test is carried out with Fe-PBAs as the positive electrode, potassium as the negative electrode, and 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 as the electrolyte. The initial specific capacity of the electrode was about 118 mA h g−1 (Fig. 3c). After 500 cycles at the current density of 77.5 mA g−1, the specific capacity was maintained at 89 mA h g−1, and the coulombic efficiency was about 95% (Fig. 3d).

The synthesis process can be further simplified for commercial application. The nano-Fe-PBA material K0.22Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.805·4.01H2O was prepared by the precipitation method,49 which possessed a particle size of about 20–30 nm (Fig. 3e and f). The electrochemical performance was investigated using 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 as the electrolyte (Fig. 3g and h). Its capacity was only 76.7 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which remained at 95.4% after 50 cycles. The charge–discharge curves showed that this material has only one charge–discharge platform. The reason for this may be that only the redox reaction of Fe ions coordinated with N occurs, causing its electrochemical performance to not be fully utilized. The authors also found that the content of lattice water in the crystal seriously affects the coulombic efficiency of PBAs. As the number of cycles increases, the lattice water in the crystal decreases, and the specific charge capacity of the material gradually decreases, while the specific discharge capacity remains stable, causing the coulombic efficiency of the material to keep increasing.
Prasanna and partners59 also observed that particle size has a huge influence on the properties of Fe-PBA materials. They synthesized Prussian green (FeIIIFeIII(CN)6) and Prussian blue (KFeIIIFeII(CN)6) using the same wet chemical precipitation technique. Another Prussian green sample was synthesized via the hydrothermal technique (labelled as PG-HT). Consequently, the samples under different precipitation rates had different particle sizes. Their SEM images (Fig. 3i–k) suggest that the Prussian green (PG) sample possessed highly crystalline poly-dispersed nanoparticles with a size in the range of 50–75 nm. Conversely, PB and PG-HT possessed large particles in the order of 2–10 microns. Their electrochemical performances were tested in a three-electrode system, where graphite acted as the counter electrode, carbon paper coated with the active material was the working electrode, Ag/AgCl was the reference electrode and 1 M KNO3 as the electrolyte. At a current density of 111 mA g−1, the PG sample showed an initial specific capacity of 140 mA h g−1, while that of the PG-HT sample was about 50 mA h g−1 and PB sample was no more than 75 mA h g−1. They concluded that a smaller particle size translates to smaller diffusion lengths and greater accessibility of the cathode to potassium ions, resulting in a better electrochemical performance.
According to the above-mentioned research results, it can be found that the particle size, crystallinity, crystal water content, and microscopic morphology of PBA electrode materials, as well as the type and formula of the electrolyte selected have a great influence on the electrochemical performance. PBA materials with less crystal water, smaller particle size and higher crystallinity tend to have better electrochemical performance. With a decrease in the particle size, the specific surface area increases. Then, it is easier for the insertion/extraction of potassium ions to occur. In this case, PBAs with a smaller particle size have better electrochemical properties. Regarding crystallinity, higher crystallinity indicates the presence of less vacancies and defects in the unit cell, which leads to a lower K-ion diffusion energy barrier. Also, less defects can reduce the influence of lattice water on the electrochemical properties.70 Thus, improving the synthesis method is an important way to change the particle size and crystal water content simultaneously.
PBAs have poor electrical conductivity (generally less than 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1) as cathode materials and this problem can be significantly improved by modification, compounding with other conductive materials, etc. Edson Nossol's group60 studied the electrochemical performance of PB composited with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and PB composited with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and their SEM images are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The nanocomposite films were employed as cathodes for flexible, transparent and ITO-free potassium batteries, showing reversible charge/discharge behavior and specific capacity of 8.3 mA h cm−3 and 2.7 mA h cm−3 for SWCNT/PB and MWCNT/PB, respectively in a three-electrode cell system containing KCl 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous electrolyte, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a large-area AP counter-electrode, which operated as a reversible ion sink. The MWCNT/PB film presented higher stability and better long cycle performance. They also reported a transparent composite cathode material of reduced graphene oxide and Prussian blue, which had higher crystallinity, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical stability than the common Prussian blue materials.61Fig. 4f shows its SEM image, showing that the PB nanoparticles were wrapped in graphene layers, and its electrochemical properties. Its initial discharge capacity reached 120 mA h g−1 at a current density of 173.7 mA g−1 and it retained 95.5% of its initial capacity after 50 cycles. In addition, the material can be used as a self-charging electrode, where it can slowly react with the oxygen in the air, recovering 88% of its total specific capacity, providing potential support for the research of new self-charging electrodes.

An in situ polymerization method to obtain polypyrrole-modified Fe-PBAs, which have higher electronic conductivity than conventional PBAs was reported by Xue and co-workers.62 Their TEM and SEM images are shown in Fig. 4c and d, which illustrate the micro-morphology of Fe-PBAs@PPy. The electrochemical performance was tested in batteries assembled with Fe-PBAs as the positive electrode, potassium as the negative electrode, and 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 as the electrolyte. Its initial discharge capacity was about 90 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 4e) and its capacity remained at 86.8% after 500 cycles. Its discharge capacity was 72.1 mA h g−1 at a higher current density of 1000 mA h g−1, and its capacity remained at 85.7% after 500 cycles. The residual K+ in the crystal structure can preserve the structural stability, which may be beneficial for the excellent cycling stability of Fe-PBAs@PPy. It can be easily found that the cycle performance and rate performance were both improved to a certain extent by modification.
The co-precipitation method was optimized by Lin's group,63 where they added ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium during the precipitation process to obtain Fe-PBAs (KPB-2E) with a more stable structure and better microscopic morphology. Its microscopic morphology and some other samples synthesized by different feed ratios (KPB-1/2/3) are shown in Fig. 4g–j. In the voltage window of 1–4 V, the reversible capacity was 92.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 30 mA g−1 in a half-cell with potassium as the negative electrode, and only one pair of Fe2+/Fe3+ participates in the electrode reaction (Fig. 4k). The battery assembled with it as the positive electrode, graphite as the negative electrode, and potassium bisfluorosulfonimide (KFSI) as the electrolyte had a capacity of 102.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and 40.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1500 mA g−1. The capacity for 400 cycles was maintained at 88% at a current density of 10000 mA g−1 (Fig. 4l), and although its electrochemical performance was not fully developed, it still had an excellent rate performance and cycling stability. Only one redox peak was observed in the cyclic voltammetry curve, and the electrochemical performance was not fully developed because the active sites were not fully utilized.
Qin's group64 reported the synthesis of a new type of ultrathin nanosheet layered Fe-PBA material, K1.4Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3(PB-NSs), via recrystallization. The influence of aging time on the Fe-PBAs was investigated. Fig. 4t shows the corresponding SEM images of the synthesized Prussian blue materials aged for 3 h (d-1) (PB-NBs), 6 h (d-2) and 48 h (d-3). Their electrochemical performances were tested with the electrolyte of 0.5 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 and 5% mass fraction of fluoroethylene carbonate added. However, this improved method does give better results. The capacity under the current density of 50 mA g−1 was 71 mA h g−1, which was maintained at 75.2% after 100 cycles (Fig. 4u). There was only one plateau in its charge–discharge curve. Also, only one redox peak was observed in the cyclic voltammetry curve, and the electrochemical performance was not fully developed.
Liao et al.50 reported the synthesis of an Fe-PBA material, K1.92Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.9·0.5H2O, via an improved co-precipitation method and its micromorphology is shown in Fig. 4v. They studied the electrochemical performance of the batteries assembled with Fe-PBAs as cathode and potassium as the anode in different electrolytes. These batteries can be divided into three parts according to the electrolyte. The carbonate-based electrolytes included 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate in a volume ratio of 1:1 and 1 M KPF6 dissolved in propylene carbonate. The ether-based electrolyte contained 1 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and 1 M KPF6 dissolved in propylene carbonate/ethylene glycol dimethyl ether in a volume ratio of 1:1, and 0.05 M KClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate was called potassium perchlorate electrolyte. Among them, the battery using the carbonate-based electrolyte could achieve a specific capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at 65 mA g−1. After the initial cycles, the interfacial impedance increased significantly, while the interfacial impedance of the ether-based electrolyte did not change significantly, and thus the coulombic efficiency of the former was lower than 60%, while the latter was around 70%. The addition of 1% volume fraction of fluoroethylene carbonate could increase the coulombic efficiency of the carbonate-based electrolytes to 90% by suppressing the side reactions of the electrolyte on the potassium electrode. The battery assembled with potassium perchlorate electrolyte had an initial discharge capacity of 133 mA h g−1, which remained at about 92.8% after 200 cycles at 13 mA g−1, and the coulombic efficiency was stable at about 98.5%, showing a good cycle performance (Fig. 4w). Thus, different electrolytes have a huge impact on the coulombic efficiency and cycle performance of Fe-PBA cathode materials.
Samantha Husmann's group65 reported a method for the preparation of composite films of carbon nanotubes and Prussian blue. Subsequently, batteries were assembled employing these films as the positive electrode, activated carbon as the negative electrode, and 0.5 M potassium chloride solution as the electrolyte. The tests showed that the reversible capacity of the button battery reached 47.6 mA h g−1 and the energy density reached 33.75 W h kg−1 at a current density of 250 mA g−1. The obtained composite material could be easily deposited on the desired substrate material and be used as electrodes for flexible batteries.
Lopes et al.66 reported the synthesis of a graphene–Prussian blue composite nanofilm with a capacity of 142 mA h g−1 at a current density of 93 mA g−1 in a potassium chloride electrolyte system, which exhibited potential applications in electrochromic devices.
The properties of all the Fe-PBAs for PIBs are shown in Table 1. With the development of Fe-PBAs, it has been found that they have great application potential not only in PIBs, but also in electrochromic devices, flexible electrodes, and self-charging electrodes. However, it is necessary to continue to optimize their synthesis method to obtain new Fe-PBA materials with smaller particle sizes, higher crystallinity, lower crystal water content, and higher conductivity to exert the best electrochemical performance. Furthermore, it seems that the electrolyte, which is an important part in PIBs, is ignored in the relevant literature. Thus, it will be a good method to specialize in matching Fe-PBAs with the electrolyte.

3.2 Manganese-based PBAs
Manganese, as an inexpensive, readily available, and low molecular weight transition metal, has been widely used in electrode materials. The manganese-based Prussian blue analogs, Mn-PBAs, undergo a reversible orthorhombic–cubic phase transition during the insertion and extraction of K+ at the two redox active sites of Mn2+/Mn3+ and Fe2+/Fe3+. The electrochemical performance of an example of Mn-PBAs is shown in Fig. 5a and b. However, as the number of cycle increases, manganese will gradually dissolve in the electrolyte and deposit on the surface of the anode, destroying the solid electrolyte layer of the anode and reducing the capacity of the battery.67 Compared to Fe-PBAs, Mn-PBAs usually have a higher working voltage when they are used as cathode materials, but they also have poor reversible capacity and long-cycle performance. In the case of the key factors that influence (water content, particle size, crystallinity, etc.) Mn-based PBAs, they are the same as that for Fe-based PBAs.

The influence of particle size and anion vacancy was studied by Tomooki Hosaka's group.68 They reported the preparation of three samples with different particle sizes and anion vacancies. The K1.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]1.0 sample with small particle size and less anion vacancy showed a good comprehensive performance. It exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 137 mA h g−1 at 15 mA g−1 in a coin cell with KN(SO2F)2 dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte. After 50 cycles, it still maintained a reversible capacity of 135 mA h g−1 (98.5%). From the perspective of particle size, they reported similar conclusions that Mn-PBAs with a smaller particle size show better electrochemical properties. However, the Mn-PBA sample with a larger particle size and appropriate anion vacancy showed better electrochemical performances in some aspects.
Jiang's group69 reported the synthesis of a potassium-rich Mn-PBA cathode material, K1.6Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.96·0.27H2O, with a microscopic morphology of cubes and a particle size of less than 20 nm (Fig. 5c and d). The electrochemical performance of the electrode in different electrolyte systems was tested (Fig. 5e). Among them, the initial capacity of KFSI dissolved in diethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolytes was around 100 mA h g−1, while the initial capacity of propylene carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate reached 115 mA h g−1, and the coulombic efficiency increased to 92%. As the number of cycles increased, the battery using ethylene carbonate failed due to an internal short circuit within 15 cycles. During the cycle, the solid electrolyte membrane formed on the potassium surface could not allow potassium ions to pass through, which means it lacks the activity of potassium deposition. This results in the uneven deposition of potassium on the anode surface, and eventually the formation of dendrites, which penetrate the separator and cause a short circuit. The addition of fluoroethylene carbonate enables the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of potassium to allow the passage of potassium ions, providing more active sites, promoting the uniform deposition of potassium, and inhibiting the formation of dendrites. However, during the first 10 cycles, the capacity decay of the short-circuited battery was very small, while that of the battery with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was 78% of the initial capacity after 30 cycles. High-resolution XPS spectroscopy was used to test the materials after cycling. Accordingly, peaks representing manganese difluoride and ferrous difluoride were observed, proving that the cathode was decomposed by FEC in the electrolyte, triggering a rapid decrease in battery capacity. How to choose a suitable electrolyte formulation has become an important issue for the preparation of potassium-ion batteries with high voltage and excellent cycle performance.
An in situ electrocatalytic method for generating KFexMn1−xF on the surface of the newly synthesized Mn-PBA material K1.82Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.96·0.47H2O by surface modification was reported.67 The stability and long cycle performance of the material were significantly improved. The SEM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 5f and g. In the half-cell system with 21 M KCF3SO3 aqueous solution as the electrolyte, the discharge capacity reached 160 mA h g−1 at a current density of 300 mA h g−1, and the discharge capacity at a current density of 2500 mA h g−1 reached 120 mA h g−1. Furthermore, the capacity loss after 130000 cycles was negligible (Fig. 5h). The energy density of the full battery composed of it and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboximide as the negative electrode was 92 W h kg−1, and the capacity is maintained at 82.5% after 6500 cycles at a current density of 1500 mA g−1, which shows that the material has an excellent performance.
Deng and co-workers70 reported a new method for the synthesis for Mn-PNAs with less lattice water and defects. Using this method, they successfully prepared a new Mn-PBA K1.94Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.994□0.006·0.08H2O. Its SEM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 5i and j, showing the KMF-EDTA sample possesses a cubic shape with an edge length of 50–200 nm. When tested in combination with a K metal anode, an initial discharge capacity of 153.5 mA h g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 81.34% was shown. Fig. 5k shows the voltage profiles at a current density of 30 mA g−1. It also demonstrated outstanding cycling stability with a remarkably high capacity retention of 95.7% after 137 cycles at a current density of 15 mA g−1. Also, the Mn-PBA electrode enabled a cell specific energy of 609.7 W h kg−1 and 80% capacity retention after 7800 cycles (Fig. 5l). The battery assembled with Mn-PBAs as the cathode and graphite as the anode demonstrated a specific energy of 331.5 W h kg−1, remarkable rate capability, and negligible capacity decay for 300 cycles.
Tang's group71 reported the electrochemical performance of a new Mn-PBA material, K1.85Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.91□0.09·0.65H2O (Fig. 6a and b) with a water content of only 3.54%. The average voltage in the half-cell was 3.8 V and its capacity was 104.8 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g−1, which remained at 92.4% after 100 cycles (Fig. 6c). Also, the addition of a certain amount of FEC could improve its coulombic efficiency, but reduced the discharge voltage. The reversible capacity decreased to 34 mA h g−1 at a current density of 600 mA h g−1, which may be due to the larger radius of the potassium ions and the slower kinetics. Using it as the positive electrode and Co3[Co(CN)6]2 as the negative electrode, a full battery was constructed with carbonate-based electrolyte. Its initial capacity was 84.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and its capacity was maintained at 96% after 20 cycles. However, its higher working voltage may cause the easier decomposition of the electrolyte, resulting in a poor long-cycle performance, and thus the electrolyte formulation requires further optimization.

The electrochemical performances of Mn-PBA materials with different drying temperatures (Fig. 6d) were reported by Morozova's group.72 They dried the samples obtained by co-precipitation method at 75 °C and 100 °C for 12 h, respectively. The TGA-MS results showed that interstitial water promoted the hydrolysis of the cyano groups and reduced the initial decomposition temperature. However, the transfer kinetics of potassium ions at the interface, the oxidation state of iron element, and the electrochemical properties did not change significantly, and it was concluded that a drying temperature under 100 °C may not influence the electrochemical performance of Mn-PBA materials.
Xue et al.73 reported new Mn-PBA materials K1.89Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.92·0.75H2O (KMHCF) and K1.70Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.90·1.10H2O (Ni-KMHCF) by improving the synthesis process and adding different ions to induce precipitation. Fig. 6e–h show the SEM and STEM images of the Mn-PBAs using sodium/potassium ion to induce crystallization. A hall-cell test was carried out with the KMHCF sample as the cathode material and potassium perchlorate dissolved in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte. The discharge capacity of the KMHCF sample at 0.2C reached 142.4 mA h g−1, which is close to its theoretical specific capacity of 156 mA h g−1. Fig. 6i–k show the electrochemical performance of the samples at 1C. During the discharge process, there are two very close platforms at around 3.6 V. The reason may be that the energies of Mn2+/Mn3+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ are similar.
A low-defect Mn-PBA material, K1.39Mn[Fe(CN)6](K-MnHCF11), which has a regular cubic micromorphology with a size of about 100–150 nm (Fig. 6l–n) was synthesized and its water content was about 3.74% by adjusting the co-precipitation process.74 It was assembled in a battery with potassium as the anode and KPF6 as the electrolyte. Its initial discharge capacity was 96 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and its capacity remained at 76% after 40 cycles (Fig. 6o). Replacing the electrolyte with KFSI successfully reduced the side reactions at the interface and improved the cycling performance. The capacity retention rate for 70 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1 increased from 71.5% to 89.1% (Fig. 6p). However, there are still possibilities to improve its electrochemical performance.
Manganese-based Prussian blue still suffers from poor electrical conductivity. Sun's group75 reported a nanocomposite of an Mn-PBA material K1.85Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.98□0.02·0.7H2O and graphene. Its electrochemical performance was tested in a half-cell using 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in the ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 as the electrolyte. Its initial discharge capacity was 131.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 15 mA g−1, and it still remained at 100.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1500 mA g−1. Under this condition, the capacity was maintained at 82.4% after 300 cycles, showing that it has good rate performance and cycle performance.
The properties of Mn-PBAs are shown in Table 2. The key problem to improve the performance of Mn-PBAs is finding a suitable electrolyte, which can ensure high capacity and good cycling performance simultaneously and reduce the dissolution of Mn2+ during cycling. The use of modification, doping and other methods to enhance its cycle stability is one of the solutions.

3.3 Cobalt-based PBAs
Cobalt, as a transition metal whose chemical properties are close to that of irons, is often used as an electrode material for lithium batteries. The sodium-ion battery electrode material obtained by introducing cobalt in a Prussian blue material had two redox active sites, and its capacity reached 150 mA h g−1, and thus the cobalt-based Prussian blue analogs, Co-PBAs, are candidates as potassium-ion battery cathode materials. The electrochemical performance of an example of Co-PBAs is shown in Fig. 7a.

Zhu's group76 reported the synthesis of a low-defect Co-PBAs: K1.43Co[Fe(CN)6]0.94·1.87H2O. Fig. 7b–d present its SEM and TEM images, showing that the Co-PBA material is composed of uniform nanoparticles with a particle size of less than 50 nm. Its electrochemical properties were tested in a three-electrode system and an aqueous solution of potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate was used as the electrolyte. Two distinct reversible redox peaks were observed in the CV curve. The initial discharge capacity at 20 mA g−1 was 90.4 mA h g−1, and the capacity remained at 92.48% after 200 cycles (Fig. 7e). At a current density of 600 mA g−1, the capacity was still 69.96% after 1000 cycles, indicating that the aqueous electrolyte is more conducive to exerting the electrochemical performance of Co-PBAs.
Wei et al.77 reported the electrochemical performance of a new Co-PBA material, K2Co[Fe(CN)6], whose TEM images are shown in Fig. 7f and g, in a potassium sulfate electrolyte system. In the three-electrode system with mercury/mercury oxide as the reference electrode and platinum as the counter electrode, two distinct redox peaks were displayed in the cyclic voltammetry curve. A high initial discharge capacity of 112 mA h g−1 was exhibited at a current density of 400 mA g−1. Also, at a high current density of 4 A g−1, it still provided a capacity of 80 mA h g−1, showing an extremely excellent rate performance. After 1000 cycles, the capacity retention was 92% and 95%, showing its good cycle stability (Fig. 7h).
The electrochemical properties of the battery assembled with a hollow porous nanocube-type Co-PBA, whose TEM and SEM images are shown in Fig. 7i–l, as the cathode, an aqueous solution of potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate as the electrolyte, and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxydiimide as the anode.78 It exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 59 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and about 50 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1. After 3000 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1, the capacity remained at 79%. In addition, it had good energy storage and power characteristics. Under the power density of 120 W kg−1, the energy density reached 67 W h kg−1. Under the power density of 2000 kW g−1, the energy density remained at 44 W h kg−1. Also, it worked well in the temperature range of −20–40 °C. In the case of the Co-PBA cathode in the potassium half-cell, an initial discharge capacity of 109 mA h g−1 was observed and it remained at 105 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles. At a high discharge density of 4 A g−1, it showed an initial discharge capacity of about 100 mA h g−1 and remained at more than 90 mA h g−1 during 1000 cycles, presenting an excellent long-cycle performance (Fig. 7m).
Wu and partners79 first reported the preparation of the Co-PBA material K1.55Co0.88[Fe(CN)6]·3.2H2O. However, the half-cell with 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in propylene carbonate solution with the addition of 4% FEC as the electrolyte only had a capacity of about 60 mA h g−1, and the capacity was reduced to 64% of its original value after only 15 cycles at 20 mA g−1. The cyclic voltammetry curve showed that the cobalt ion does not undergo redox reaction during the charging and discharging process, which means that this material only has a single redox active site and the capacity failed to reach the expectation. Whether double electron transfer can be achieved has become a key issue limiting the capacity of Co-PBA materials.
Specially, it was found that Co-PBA materials can be used as anode materials. Deng's group80 reported that Co3[Co(CN)6]2·10.7H2O exhibits a good electrochemical performance as anode materials. Its SEM and TEM images are shown in Fig. 7n and o, respectively. It showed four peaks in its first cathodic scan (Fig. 7p). The Co-PBA anode material exhibited a highly reversible capacity of 324.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 7q), a superior rate capability (221 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), and favorable long-term cycling stability (200 cycles with 82% capacity retention) (Fig. 7r).
The properties of all the Co-PBAs for PIBs are shown in Table 3. Among the above-mentioned PBAs, the Co-PBAs are studied the least. According to the above-mentioned studies, it seems that they can exert a good performance in the aqueous electrolyte system. Also, it can be inferred that the above-mentioned key factors have a similar influence on the Co-PBAs. Nevertheless, more research is needed to confirm these inferences. Also, the cost of Co-PBAs is higher than that of Mn-PBAs without obvious performance advantages.

3.4 Nickel-based PBAs
Nickel-based Prussian blue analog Ni-PBA electrodes often show good structural stability and cycle stability in potassium-ion batteries, and their volume change rate is small during cycling, but nickel ions are not electrochemically active in electrodes. However, Ni-PBA materials only have one electrochemically active site, and thus their capacities are not satisfactory. The electrochemical performance of an example of Co-PBAs is shown in Fig. 8a.

A porous Ni-PBA based on a potassium-rich material, K2Ni[Fe(CN)6]·1.2H2O, was prepared and its TEM images are shown in Fig. 8b and c.81 It was found that the use of potassium chloride instead of potassium citrate during the synthesis resulted in a reduced particle size and even distribution. Its electrochemical performance was tested in a three-electrode system with potassium nitrate-solution as the electrolyte. It exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 77.4 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1, and still had a capacity of 42.1 mA h g−1 after the current density was increased by 100 times (Fig. 8d). It only took 4.1 s to charge or discharge. After 5000 cycles at a current density of 2.4 A g−1, it maintained 98.6% of its initial capacity, and no capacity decay was detected after 1000 cycles at a current density of 16 A g−1, which shows that this material has an excellent rate performance and cycle life. Its specific power reached 8214 W kg−1, reaching the level of some electrochemical capacitors.
Li's group82 reported a simple co-precipitation method to synthesize the Ni-PBA electrode material K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88·0.49H2O. This material was composed of homogeneous nanoparticles with a size in the range of 10–20 nm (Fig. 8e and f). Then, this group compared its electrochemical performance in different electrolytes including 1 M potassium hexafluorophosphate dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte, and 0.8 M potassium hexafluorophosphate dissolved in diethyl carbonate/ethylene carbonate and FEC electrolyte. The voltage polarization of the former was smaller, its redox peak was sharper and its reversible capacity was 62.8 mA h g−1, while its capacity was 45.8 mA h g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1, which means that its rate performance is excellent. Also, its capacity remained at 88.6% at a current density of 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 8g). The latter had a larger overpotential and a reversible capacity of about 64 mA h g−1. It was combined with diethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte and a graphite anode to assemble a full battery, which exhibited an initial discharge capacity at a current density of 100 mA g−1 of 62.1 mA h g−1, and its capacity was maintained at 87.1% after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Its capacity was still 51.4 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, which means the full battery has a good cycle stability and has potential applications.
Early in 2011, Wessells et al.83 reported a co-precipitation method to synthesize an Ni-PBA material K0.6Ni1.2[Fe(CN)6]·3.6H2O, whose SEM image showed that it is composed of a porous collection of 20–50 nm grains (Fig. 8h). Also, its electrochemical performance was tested in a three-electrode system using potassium nitrate as the electrolyte to get its electrochemical properties. It exhibited a specific capacity of 60 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1 and showed no capacity loss after 1000 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1. Its capacity loss was 1.75% after 2000 cycles, which shows that this material has excellent cycle stability (Fig. 8i).
Lee and partners84 studied the electrochemical performance of Ni-PBA electrodes prepared via a simple co-precipitation method in three-electrode systems with potassium nitrate aqueous solution and potassium hexafluorophosphate propylene carbonate solution as the electrolytes. At a current density of 60 mA g−1, the specific capacities were 57.7 mA h g−1 and 43.7 mA h g−1, respectively. Also, the results of cyclic voltammetry showed symmetrical anodic and cathodic peaks in the potassium nitrate aqueous solution system, showing the characteristics of reversibility and fast kinetics of ion insertion. However, the kinetics of ion insertion in the propylene carbonate system was slow, and the potential difference between the cathodic and anodic peaks was greater than 100 mV. It was revealed that Ni-PBAs have better electrochemical performances in aqueous electrolytes.
The synthesis of a high-crystallinity Ni-PBA material, K1.86Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.87□0.13·1.88H2O(PBNi@ES), through electrostatic-assisted co-precipitation technology was reported.85 The authors also compared the micromorphology and electrochemical performance of the samples synthesized without an electric field (PBNi), and the SEM and TEM images of all the samples are shown in Fig. 8j–m. The initial discharge specific capacity was 63 mA h g−1 for PBNi@ES and 57 mA h g−1 for PBNi, and the corresponding coulombic efficiencies were 85.5% and 77.9%, respectively. Clearly, PBNi@ES exhibited higher K-storage than PBNi, which could be mainly attributed to its excellent crystallinity and interfacial activity. The specific discharge capacity of PBNi dropped to 33 mA h g−1 and the corresponding capacity retention rate was 73.3%, while that of PBNi@ES remained at 50 mA h g−1, corresponding to 90.3% of the initial discharge capacity after 503 cycles (Fig. 8n), revealing that the improved method resulted in a better performance.
The properties of all the Ni-PBAs for PIBs are shown in Table 4. Although Ni-PBAs are less studied, studies showed that porous Ni-PBAs seem to have a better electrochemical performance. Although Ni-PBA cathode materials have an excellent cycling performance, their low capacity limits their potential for utilization. Thus, doping them with other electrode materials to optimize the cycling stability and crystal structure of the composites may be a future research direction. Optimizing the electrolyte is also a promising method.

3.5 Other-based PBAs
Iron-based PBAs, which have been studied the most, have good cycling stability but low redox potential. Manganese-based PBAs have high redox potential but poor cycling stability. Nickel-based Prussian blue has excellent cycling stability with only one pair of electrochemically active sites. Thus, combining different PBAs to achieve better performances has become a new strategy.
A series of nickel-doped iron-based Prussian blue analogs was reported by Chong's group.86 Among them, the cathode material with the chemical formula of K1.90Ni0.5Fe0.5[Fe(CN)6]0.89·0.42H2O showed the best electrochemical properties. Its micromorphology is shown in Fig. 4m. At 10 mA g−1, its initial discharge capacity was 81.6 mA h g−1. Also, the initial discharge capacity remained at 53.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1. Cycling 1000 times at a current density of 100 mA g−1, it maintained 82.3% of its initial capacity, showing that this cathode material has excellent structural stability and cycle performance (Fig. 4n). The full battery assembled with the graphite anode had an energy density of 282.7 W h kg−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1, which can be used as an electrode material for high-energy-density potassium-ion batteries.
Huang and partners87 also reported a series of nickel-doped Fe-PBAs (NiFePB-0/2/5/8) and their SEM images are shown in Fig. 4o–r, respectively. With potassium as the negative electrode and PBAs as the anode, 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of 1:1 and a solution with 1% mass fraction of fluoroethylene carbonate was added as the electrolyte for testing. The sample (NiFePB-5) with the chemical formula of K1.63Ni0.05Fe0.95[Fe(CN)6]0.92·0.42H2O exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity of 124.17 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and its capacity remained at 94.4% after 50 cycles. It also had a capacity of 80.95 mA h g−1 at a current density of 400 mA g−1, showing the best electrochemical performance (Fig. 4s). The test results showed that with an increase in nickel content, the capacity first increased, and then decreased. The doping of a small amount of nickel could effectively activate the redox couple Fe2+C6/Fe3+C6, reduce the charge transfer resistance and promote the diffusion of potassium ions.
A series of PBAs composed of Ni-PBAs and Zn-PBAs was reported88 and it was found that the sample labeled Ni2Zn1HCF whose TEM image is shown in Fig. 9a had the best comprehensive electrochemical performance among the synthesized samples. Their electrochemical properties were tested in a three-electrode system with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum plate as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The second discharge capacity of the Ni2Zn1HCF electrode was 58.7 mA h g−1. After cycling for 5000 times, 85.5% (50.2 mA h g−1) capacity retention was achieved for the electrode. In the long-term cycling test at a high rate of 500C, the second discharge capacity of the Ni2Zn1HCF electrode was 48.4 mA h g−1, which retained 89.6% after cycling for 30000 times, with a coulombic efficiency of around 100%, indicating its extremely high cycling stability and excellent long cycle performance (Fig. 9b).

Huang's group89 also synthesized a series of PBAs composed of Ni-PBAs and Co-PBAs labeled PBNxC1−x (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1). The SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. 9c–h, respectively. They found that the K2Ni0.36Co0.64Fe(CN)6 sample labelled as PBN0.4C0.6 had the best comprehensive electrochemical performance among the PBNxC1−x samples. It had an initial capacity of 86 mA h g−1 with a retention of 98% after 50 cycles, which is much higher than that of K2NiFe(CN)6 (KBN) and K2CoFe(CN)6 (KBC) (Fig. 9i), and its capacity retention remained up to 88% after 300 cycles, showing that the performance of composite improved a lot compared with the single material.
In 2022, Chen's group90 and Gao's group91 synthesized a series of PBAs with different Fe and Mn contents and tested their electrochemical performances. Gao found that in the KPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate system, the material with the chemical formula K1.69Fe0.51Mn0.49[Fe(CN)6]0.83□0.17·1.07H2O whose SEM is shown in Fig. 9j showed the best electrochemical performance. Its average discharge voltage was 3.82 V. Also, its initial discharge capacity was 129 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and its capacity remained at 90 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles. At a current density of 800 mA g−1, the reversible capacity was 94 mA h g−1 (Fig. 9k). This half-cell test showed that this cathode material had a good rate performance and cycle performance. The SEM of Chen's samples are shown in Fig. 9l–q. Chen found that in the system of KPF6 dissolved in propylene carbonate and FEC, the K1.87Fe0.1Mn0.90[Fe(CN)6]0.97□0.03·0.34H2O sample labelled as 10% Fe-KMF showed the best performance electrochemical performance. Its initial discharge capacity was 124.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1, and it maintained 70% of its capacity after 200 cycles. Also, it still had a capacity of 77.5 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Fig. 9r shows the cycle performance of the different samples. The introduction of iron enhanced the stability of the lattice and improved the cycle performance, but its joint action with manganese also increased the defects in the lattice and increased the amount of lattice water, which reduced the electrochemical performance, and thus it is necessary to find a suitable ratio of iron and manganese. Also, it is a key method to improve the performance of PBA materials.
Besides, introducing other transition metal elements such as Zn, Ti, and Cu in PBAs is also a good perspective. Wu's group79 studied the electrochemical properties of the copper-based Prussian blue analog (Cu-PBA) material K1.40Cu0.93Fe(CN)6·4.5H2O. In KPF6 dissolved in FEC and propylene carbonate electrolyte, it provided a reversible capacity of only 35.2 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and its capacity decayed to 64% after 15 cycles. This may be related to the high water content in its crystals. Besides, the introduction of copper increases the cost of the battery, limiting its further application.
Luo and partners92 introduced titanium in Prussian blue analogs and reported the electrochemical performance of the PBA cathode material K0.3Ti0.75Fe0.25[Fe(CN)6]0.95·2.8H2O. Fig. 9s and t show the FESEM and TEM images of this material and its CV curves are shown in Fig. 9u. The initial specific discharge capacity is 136.7 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 9v) and its capacity remained at 64.7% after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA h g−1 (Fig. 9w) in a half-cell test using KPF6 dissolved in the mixture of FEC, ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate as the electrolyte.
Zinc, as a non-toxic and low-cost metal element, was also introduced in Prussian blue analogs for research. Jongwook's group93 reported the synthesis of a Zn-PBA material K1.88Zn2.88[Fe(CN)6]2(H2O)5, whose TEM imagine is shown in Fig. 9x, for the first time, and studied its electrochemical performance in the mixed organic electrolyte of diethyl ester, ethylene carbonate and FEC. This material exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 55.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 7 mA g−1, and its capacity remained at 95% after 100 cycles (Fig. 9y). It was found that although its capacity is not satisfactory, its cycle performance is good.
PBAs obtained by introducing other transition metal elements such as zinc and copper often show a poor performance. However, the doping of iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, etc. in pairs can overcome the shortcomings of each material to a certain extent and improve the overall properties of composite materials. Their performance parameters are shown in Table 5. Doping a variety of PBAs with different bases and studying their suitable electrolyte systems may become a new research direction.

4 Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, we reviewed PBAs from the perspective of redox-active transition metals, electrochemical performance, synthesis methods and electrolytes of all the reported PBAs for PIB cathodes. In recent years, the related research on PBAs have become a hotspot in the field of PIBs, and many breakthrough results have been achieved. The progress and challenges of different metals-based PBAs can be summarized as follows: (1) Fe-PBAs have two redox-active sites with the best comprehensive performance, but their specific capacity and working voltage are not as high as the theoretical predictions. Also, their poor electrical conductivity limits their further application. (2) Mn-PBAs usually provide a high working voltage and specific capacity. However, they suffer from poor cycle stability and the Mn2+ ions will dissolve gradually during long cycles. (3) Co-PBAs exhibit an appropriate specific capacity, but their high cost limits their further application. (4) Ni-PBAs show only one redox-active site, which results in a low specific capacity. However, they have an excellent cycle performance. (5) The compounds of the former PBAs show a good comprehensive performance. However, their synthesis methods are complex, while it is difficult to accurately achieve the content of the target elements as expected. In the case of Zn-PBAs, Cu-PBAs, Ti-PBAs and other PBAs, the current research results show that their electrochemical properties cannot satisfy the application demands. Besides, some PBAs whose metal center (M′ in the chemical formular) is cobalt show potential application as anode materials. They have a high revisable capacity, good cycle stability and rate capability. However, the high cost of cobalt weaken its commercial application in the future.
Besides, PBAs suffer from the following universal problems: (1) it is difficult to completely remove the water in their crystals, making their crystal structure less stable, their coulombic efficiency is low, and they continuously decompose during long cycles, which affect the cycle performance of the electrode. (2) The conductivity of PBAs is poor, limiting the development of their electrochemical performance. (3) The organic electrolyte system is the current mainstream in potassium ion batteries, where its safety issue poses new challenges for the development of PBAs.
Future research on PBA cathode materials in PIBs should focus on the following research hotspots: (1) improving the synthesis method to prepare PBAs with uniform microscopic morphology, small particle size, and less crystallization water and defects in their crystals. (2) Developing different types of electrolytes and improving their compatibility with PBA materials, including aqueous and nonaqueous electrolyte systems. (3) The electronic conductivity and crystal stability of PBAs can be optimized by various surface modification, doping and other means, thereby improving their electrochemical performance. In the case of Fe-PBAs, it is a good strategy to introduce more potassium ions to synthesize potassium-rich Fe-PBAs, which can provide a higher specific capacity. Some chelating agents can be added when synthesizing Mn-PBAs to get less crystallization water and defects, causing better cycle stability to be achieved. More research on the compatibility of electrolytes is needed to give full play to the electrochemical performance of PBAs. Due to the high cost of Co, Co-PBA materials may be not a good alternative to PIB cathodes. To achieve a high capacity, Ni-PBAs with more redox-active sites are needed, which calls for new crystal structures and synthesis methods.
