    , Accepted 20th June 2020First published on 22nd June 2020AbstractBismuth incorporation has been shown to significantly decrease the performance of perovskite solar cells, which has led to the common belief that BiPb is a strong nonradiative recombination center in hybrid perovskites. Using rigorous first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that BiPb is not an efficient recombination center. However, Bi acts as a donor, and pushes the Fermi level closer to the conduction band; this shift promotes the formation of iodine interstitials, which are the actual nonradiative recombination centers. These insights explain why Bi incorporation is detrimental for the photovoltaic performance. More generally, it draws attention to the detrimental role unintentionally incorporated impurities can play, not by acting as nonradiative recombination centers themselves, but by shifting the Fermi level and thereby promoting the formation of efficiency-killing defects.
Rapidly rising over the past ten years, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has reached 25.2%.1 This efficiency is already close to that of single-crystal silicon cells (26.1%),1 though instability and toxicity remain as two challenges for perovskite solar cells toward large-scale utilization. In order to further enhance and control their performance, minimizing the nonradiative losses2 and materials degradation3 induced by defects or impurities is crucial. Extensive efforts4–12 have therefore been devoted to revealing the microscopic origins of deep-level defects that may act as nonradiative recombination centers.
In addition to intrinsic defects, extrinsic defects may play an important role. Impurities can be introduced by intentional doping or by unintentional incorporation, for instance, when they are present in precursors. Bismuth has been incorporated into hybrid perovskites in both ways.13–18 Experiments established that Bi incorporates on the Pb site18 and significantly reduces the carrier lifetime and power conversion efficiency.16,18 Hence, it has been proposed18 that Bi substituting on the Pb site (BiPb) acts as a detrimental nonradiative recombination center in hybrid perovskites.
Prior first-principles calculations18,19 have confirmed that BiPb has a charge-state transition level in the band gap, suggesting that BiPb may cause nonradiative recombination. However, as we have recently shown,11 the existence of transition levels in the band gap does not necessarily cause nonradiative recombination in halide perovskites. Explicit first-principles calculations of capture coefficients are essential to determine nonradiative recombination rates, and such calculations have not yet been performed for BiPb. Here we quantitatively show that BiPb itself is not a nonradiative recombination center in hybrid perovskites, despite the presence of a charge-state transition level in the band gap. Instead, we attribute the experimentally observed detrimental effect of BiPb to the fact that BiPb acts as an electrically active center with donor character. The incorporation of Bi therefore shifts the Fermi level closer to the conduction band, which promotes the formation of iodine interstitials (Ii). These intrinsic defects are strong nonradiative recombination centers12 and the actual cause of the loss in efficiency.
Using the Bi impurity in hybrid perovskites as an example, the present study calls attention to the potentially hidden role of unintentionally incorporated impurities in general. Even though the impurities themselves do not necessarily act as strong nonradiative recombination centers, their presence may shift the Fermi level of the material, which promotes the formation of efficiency-killing defects.
To assess the impact of BiPb on nonradiative recombination, we first calculate the formation energy of BiPb in the prototypical hybrid perovskite MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3). Fig. 1 shows the formation energy of BiPb in MAPbI3 as a function of the Fermi level in three relevant charge states (+, 0, and −). BiPb favors the + and 0 charge states with a (+/0) transition level at 0.28 eV below the conduction-band minimum (CBM). The formation energy of the − charge state is higher than the energy of the + and 0 states across the entire band gap. Based on the presence of a charge-state transition level in the band gap, BiPb was suggested to be a nonradiative recombination center.18 However, the occurrence of charge-state transition levels in the band gap does not guarantee efficient nonradiative recombination;11,12 an explicit computation of the capture coefficients is essential.
 Fig. 1  Formation energy of BiPb as a function of the Fermi level in three charge states (+, 0, and −). The (+/0) transition occurs at 0.28 eV below the conduction-band minimum (CBM) or 1.32 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM). The inset depicts the local atomic structure of Bi+Pb and the corresponding charge density distribution (yellow isosurface). 
In order to quantitatively determine the capture coefficients, we calculate the configuration coordinate digram for the  transition as shown in Fig. 2. This diagram maps the potential energy surfaces of Bi+Pb and Bi0Pb as a function of a generalized coordinate (Q). The Q of each configuration is defined by its difference from a reference configuration, i.e., , where mα is the mass of atom α and Rα the Cartesian coordinate of atom α.20 In Fig. 2, Q = 0 refers to the equilibrium configuration of Bi0Pb (the reference configuration) and Q = ΔQ corresponds to that of Bi+Pb. The configuration coordinate diagram allows us to inspect the charge-state transitions and the accompanying electron/hole capture processes.
 Fig. 2  Configuration coordinate diagram for the  transition accompanied by an electron (Cn) and a hole (Cp) capture processes. 
Starting from Bi+Pb with an electron (e−) at the CBM and a hole (h+) at the VBM (the green curve in Fig. 2), Bi+Pb can capture the electron and transition to Bi0Pb (the orange curve in Fig. 2). Subsequently, Bi0Pb captures the hole and transforms back to Bi+Pb (the blue curve in Fig. 2). Semiclassically, the capture rate is characterized by the energy barrier for the charge-state transition, i.e., the energy required to cross the intersection of the potential energy surfaces between the initial and final charge states in the configuration coordinate diagram. In the present case, the electron capture barrier is almost zero and the hole capture barrier is extremely large (>2.7 eV), since the orange and blue curves do not even intersect within the range of Q displayed in Fig. 2. This implies fast electron capture and slow hole capture; this is consistent with the position of the charge-state transition level in the band gap (Fig. 1), since the capture coefficient is expected to decrease with increasing transition energy.21
An important feature here is that the potential energy surfaces of BiPb are highly anharmonic. The pronounced anharmonicity significantly decreases the potential energy of Bi+Pb in the vicinity of the equilibrium configuration of Bi0Pb, which leads to a much larger energy barrier for the Bi0Pb → Bi+Pb transition than in a harmonic case. Hole capture is already expected to be slow since the (+/0) transition level is 1.32 eV away from the VBM (Fig. 1). The strong anharmonicity makes hole capture even slower.
In Fig. 3 we present the calculated nonradiative capture coefficients of BiPb. Consistent with our analysis of the capture barriers, the electron capture coefficient (Cn) is very high, on the order of 10−5 cm3 s−1, while the hole capture coefficient (Cp) is much lower, on the order of 10−18 cm3 s−1 at room temperature. The total capture coefficient is determined by Ctot = CnCp/(Cn + Cp), and is limited by hole capture in the present case. Therefore, the total capture coefficient is only ∼10−18 cm3 s−1 at room temperature.
 Fig. 3  Nonradiative electron (green), hole (orange), and total (black) capture coefficients of BiPb as a function of temperature. 
The nonradiative recombination coefficient (A) is related to the total capture coefficient through A = NdefCtot, where Ndef is the defect concentration. Even if we assume an unrealistically high concentration of BiPb, e.g., 1020 cm−3, the resulting A coefficient is only about 102 s−1, which is five orders of magnitude lower than reported experimental nonradiative recombination coefficients of intrinsic hybrid perovskites (∼107 s−1 (ref. 22–26)). This means that BiPb is not an efficient nonradiative recombination center.
Experimentally, it has been observed that the incorporation of Bi significantly decreases the carrier lifetime and power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.16,18 Based on our accurate calculations, this observation cannot be attributed to the nonradiative recombination caused by BiPb, raising the question: why does BiPb affect the nonradiative recombination in hybrid perovskites, even though it is not an efficient recombination center?
To answer this question, we plot the formation energy of BiPb together with those of the three dominant intrinsic defects in MAPbI3 (Ii, VPb, and VI) in Fig. 4. In this diagram, we can determine the position of the Fermi level in the material based on charge neutrality between the lowest-energy defects. Without Bi incorporation, the Fermi level is pinned by VI and VPb, as depicted by the black dashed line in Fig. 4. After introducing Bi into the material, the Fermi level is pinned by BiPb and VPb (the red dashed line in Fig. 4), which shifts the Fermi level toward the CBM by 0.23 eV.
 Fig. 4  Impact of BiPb on the Fermi-level position in MAPbI3. The black (red) dashed line shows the location at which the Fermi level is pinned without (with) the incorporation of Bi. ΔEf denotes the change in the formation energy of Ii due to the shift of the Fermi level. 
While VPb is the lowest-energy intrinsic defect, it does not cause significant nonradiative recombination in MAPbI3; Ii is a dominant recombination center that is likely responsible for the experimentally measured A coefficient in hybrid perovskites.12 As shown in Fig. 4, the formation energy of Ii is reduced by 0.2 eV due to the incorporation of Bi. The defect concentration is proportional to e−Ef/kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. T is the growth temperature, which is around 150 °C (ref. 9) for hybrid perovskites. Hence, a reduction of the formation energy (ΔEf) of Ii by 0.2 eV means an enhancement of its concentration by a factor of 242. This implies that the nonradiative recombination coefficient induced by Ii will be increased by more than two orders of magnitude, which will clearly impact the carrier lifetime and power conversion efficiency. We note that the Fermi-level shift also depends on the concentration of Bi. A higher concentration of Bi will shift the Fermi level toward the CBM even further, which results in an even stronger enhancement of the concentration of Ii.
In summary, we have explained the mechanism by which incorporation of Bi in hybrid perovskites causes a drop in efficiency. Our explicit first-principles calculations show that even though BiPb has a charge-state transition level in the band gap in MAPbI3, it does not act as a nonradiative recombination center. The true cause of the efficiency reduction is a Bi-induced enhancement in the concentration of iodine interstitials, which act as strong nonradiative recombination centers. The enhancement is due to a shift of the Fermi level, resulting from Bi acting as a donor. Our results focus attention on the detrimental role unintentionally incorporated impurities can play, not by acting as nonradiative recombination centers, but by shifting the Fermi level and thereby promoting the formation of efficiency-killing defects—in this case, iodine interstitials. Therefore, to control the incorporation of iodine interstitial defects I-poor synthesis conditions are, in principle, desired. However, we also note that I-poor conditions may promote the formation of iodine vacancies, which may degrade the performance of hybrid perovskites. A careful optimization of the synthesis condition is required to minimize the detrimental impacts of iodine interstitials and vacancies.
Methods
The first-principles calculations in this work are performed using density functional theory with the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional,27 including spin–orbit coupling (SOC), as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).28 Additional computational details can be found in ref. 11 and 12. The chemical potential of Bi (μBi) is chosen to reflect equilibrium with BiI3: μBi + 3μI = ΔHf(BiI3) = −1.86 eV, where μI is the chemical potential of iodine and ΔHf(BiI3) the calculated formation enthalpy of BiI3. For the host chemical potentials, we choose μI to correspond to I-medium conditions, which are representative of typical synthesis. The nonradiative capture coefficients are calculated using the multiphonon emission methodology20 with an extension to anharmonic potential energy surfaces.11,12
