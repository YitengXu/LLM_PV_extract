    , Accepted 17th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractAn acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), namely TTNC, was designed and synthesized using a π-conjugation extension strategy on the terminal unit based on one successful NFA material TTIC. Benefiting from the end-extended conjugation, the new molecule shows red-shifted absorption, more ordered packing, and maintained energy levels compared with TTIC. These advantages contribute to achieving favorable phase separation morphology and strong light-harvesting ability for the donor/acceptor blend film. By combining with a wide band-gap polymer donor PBDB-T, the optimized TTNC based devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.34%, mainly originating from an enhanced short-current density (Jsc) of 20.95 mA cm−2, especially an excellent fill factor (FF) of 71% which is obviously superior to that of TTIC (66%). The findings indicate that π-conjugation extension is an effective way to manipulate the absorption range, molecular packing and charge mobility of NFAs for an outstanding photovoltaic performance, which offers valuable insight for designing high-efficiency organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted considerable attention in organic solar cells (OSCs) with the great stride of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to over 19%.1–14 Recently, the rapid development of NFAs was mainly dominated by acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small-molecule acceptors (SMAs),15–27 The main reason for great success of the A–D–A type SMAs lies in their easily-tuned optoelectronic properties through simple chemical modification on the D and A units.28–37 Elegant works have been reported, such as modulating the central units (D) with varied side chains to adjust the crystalline properties and modifying the terminal units (A) by introducing different functional groups to tune the light absorption range and molecular energy level, thus leading to a significant impact on the short-current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).38–43 As is well known, the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups or electron-donating groups on terminal units is a popular and efficient way to improve the device performance; however, it is hard to balance the trade-off of Jsc and Voc. To address this issue, the strategy of π-conjugation extension of end groups has been adopted to obtain high FF and Jsc through favorable intermolecular packing and bathochromic absorption, promoting charge generation and transport.41,44–46 Besides, the extended π-conjugation end groups hardly cause a significant change in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of SMAs, which will facilitate maintenance of the original high Voc.41,44–46 For instance, Chen's group developed a naphthyl-fused indanone end group called NINCN with an extended conjugation structure compared with the widely used 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN).41 They exploited NINCN as the end group to design a NFA molecule FDNCTF, which exhibits superior photovoltaic performance (PCE = 11.2%) with higher Jsc (16.5 mA cm−2) and FF (0.73), in comparison with the INCN counterpart (FDICTF, PCE = 10.06%).41 Afterwards, Hou et al. developed a SMA (IDTN) based on the same end units, achieving a remarkable FF value of 0.78.44 The rationalization of efficient NINCN based SMAs was systematically investigated by Yi et al.,47 and their results indicated that the extended conjugation could not only promote the end group π–π stacking along face-on orientation during solvent evaporation, thus being beneficial to charge transport, but also endowing SMAs with red-shifted absorption, facilitating the enhancement of light-harvesting ability. Therefore, NINCN should be a good choice as an end group for the design of high-efficiency SMAs.
Recently, Gao et al. reported an A–D–A type SMA, namely TTIC, employing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the central unit and INCN as the terminal units.48 When combined with a wide bandgap polymer donor material PBDB-T, the device exhibited a high PCE of 10.87% but a low FF of 0.66. Keeping the unique advantages of π-conjugation extension in mind, herein, we designed and synthesized a new SMA named TTNC (Fig. 1) by replacing the end group (INCN) of TTIC with NINCN to improve the π-electron delocalization. The delicate structural modification enhances the intermolecular π–π stacking, which promotes the charge transfer in the PBDB-T:TTNC blend, and thus the FF of the corresponding device increases significantly from 66% to 71.2%. In combination with the raised Jsc of 20.95 mA cm−2, the optimized PBDB-T:TTNC devices exhibit a superior PCE of 11.34% than that of TTIC based devices. In addition, it was noted that two TTIC derivatives, TTIC-M and TTIC-F (with methyl and fluorine substituted INCN end groups, respectively) as reported in the literature,48 showed inferior PCEs (<10%) due to a low FF of 0.63, and unbalanced trade-off of Jsc and Voc caused by different push–pull electron properties of methyl and fluorine. Consequently, π-conjugation extension of the terminal units should be an alternative to developing efficient SMAs for enhanced photovoltaic performance, as demonstrated by our work.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal properties
The target molecule TTNC was prepared by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the dialdehyde intermediate TTCHO and NINCN. The synthetic route is depicted in Scheme 1, and detailed synthetic procedures including characterization data are shown in the ESI.† The chemical structure of TTNC was fully characterized by 1H/13C NMR and high resolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to evaluate the thermal stability under nitrogen atmosphere. Over 340 °C (5% weight loss) could be estimated from the curve in Fig. S1 (ESI†), demonstrating the good thermal stability of TTNC, which meets the requirement of device fabrication sufficiently.

2.2 DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were carried out to investigate the geometric and electronic properties of TTNC. To simplify the computational process, here, the hexyl groups were replaced by methyl. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the extended π-conjunction terminal units of TTNC could maintain considerable molecular planarity, which facilitates efficient π–π stacking, thus enhancing charge mobility. In addition, the electron cloud of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is mainly delocalized in the central donor unit, and that of the LUMO level is delocalized across the backbone, especially spreading to the end group, which provided the driving force for charge separation.

2.3 Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of TTNC in dilute chloroform solution and thin films were measured. The corresponding data of TTIC are also summarized in Table 1 for comparison. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), in dilute chloroform solution, TTNC exhibits an obviously red-shifted maximum absorption peak (λmax) with a higher extinction coefficient of 1.31 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 784 nm compared with that of TTIC (1.19 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 750 nm). Notably, the broadened absorption with λmax at 833 nm could be observed for solid films in Fig. 3a. In contrast to the TTIC film, the red-shifted absorption peak ∼13 nm might be ascribed to the hyperchromic effect of π-conjugation extension and better molecule packing. The result is consistent with the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of TTNC (1.34 eV) calculated from the film absorption onset at 925 nm, which is slightly narrower than 1.38 eV of TTIC, but close to 1.35 eV of TTIC-F owing to the red-shifted absorption caused by the introduction of fluorine atoms on end units.48

The electrochemical properties of TTNC were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) under the identical conditions used for TTIC. As depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the LUMO and HOMO levels for TTNC could be estimated to be −3.90 eV and −5.34 eV, respectively, which is well maintained like that of TTIC (Table 1 and Fig. 3b), contributing to keeping a reasonable Voc. Furthermore, the energy levels obtained from CV measurements are consistent with the calculated values of TTIC (−3.42/−5.37 eV) and TTNC (−3.46/−5.38 eV) by DFT calculations. In general, the results above indicate that π-conjugation extension of end groups could enable SMA with enhanced light-capturing ability and a well maintained LUMO level, and thus promote the improvement of comprehensive performance.
2.4 Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the new acceptor TTNC, OPV devices were fabricated adopting a conventional device architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al, where PDINO is an efficient cathode interlayer for efficient charge extraction and reducing recombination losses.49,50 In the active layer, PBDB-T was chosen as the donor to match TTNC for better comparison with PBDB-T:TTIC based devices.51 Varied processing conditions, such as donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio (w/w), different additives and ratios were systematically investigated. The detailed fabrication procedures and device parameters are provided in the ESI† (Tables S1–S3). After a series of optimizations, the optimal weight ratio of PBDB-T:TTNC was screened as 1:1. And the TTNC based devices cast from chloroform with 0.3% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) showed a higher PCE of 11.34% than that of the TTIC counterpart (10.52%) under the same experimental conditions. The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves are depicted in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The slightly deeper LUMO level of TTNC and low energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc) for the TTNC based device (0.58 eV) enable a moderate Voc of 0.76 V, which is maintained at almost the same level as that of the TTIC based device (0.79 V). PBDB-T:TTNC based devices achieved an enhanced Jsc of 20.95 mA cm−2, and more favorable FF of 71.2% compared with that of TTIC based devices (65.7%). Besides, it was noted that PBDB-T:TTIC-F based devices exhibit an inferior PCE (9.51%), resulting from the low Voc (0.71 V) and FF (63.0%) in spite of a slightly higher Jsc of 21.26 mA cm−2. However, TTIC-M based devices yield a higher Voc of 0.83 V, but an undesirable photovoltaic performance (9.97%) was obtained mainly due to the low Jsc (19.07 mA cm−2) and FF (63.0%).48 These results indicate that enhancing the terminal unit π-electron delocalization of small NFAs is a promising approach to achieve higher FF and Jsc by improving charge transfer and hyperchromic effect.

As shown in Fig. 4b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to study the photo-to-current response in TTIC and TTNC based devices. Note that the TTNC based device displays a broader and red-shifted photo-current responses compared with the TTIC counterpart, which could be attributed to the red-shifted absorption spectrum of TTNC. In addition, the EQE values in the range of 670–900 nm (mostly contributed by the acceptor) are dramatically high for the device based on PBDB-T:TTNC, which should originate from the stronger optical absorption of TTNC. The integrated current density is calculated to be 19.36 and 20.16 mA cm−2 for the TTIC and TTNC based devices, respectively, which agree well with the Jscs obtained from J–V measurements in Fig. 4a.
The relationship of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) was assessed to further investigate the high performance of the devices by the formula Jph = JL − JD (JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the dark) and Veff = Vo − Va (Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero). As shown in Fig. 4c, Jph becomes saturated (Jsat) when Veff exceeds 1.7 V, indicating that charge recombination is minimized at higher voltage due to the high internal electric field in the devices. The charge dissociation and charge collection probability in the devices could be estimated by the value of Jph/Jsat. Under the short-circuit conditions, compared with 91% for the TTIC based devices, the Jph/Jsat value of 94% was obtained for TTNC ones, suggesting higher exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, and thus leading to high FF. Moreover, the relationship between Jsc and light intensity (P) is illustrated in Fig. 4d to further understand the charge recombination properties in the devices according to the formula of Jph ∝ Pα, where the exponential factor α is the recombination parameter, which indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination. The closer the α value is to 1, the lower is the bimolecular recombination. As seen in Fig. 4d, the α value was estimated to be 0.97 for the TTNC based devices, which is higher than that of the TTIC counterpart (0.95), implying lower bimolecular recombination in the optimal TTNC based device, thus contributing to obtaining a high FF.
2.5 Morphology analysis and charge transport
Considering that the device performances relate strongly to the morphology of blend films, the systematic investigations on the morphological characteristics of the two blends were conducted by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. As observed from the AFM images (Fig. 5a), the TTIC based blend shows a large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.07 nm, which indicates excessive aggregation in the PBDB-T:TTIC film. By contrast, the TTNC based blend exhibits a smaller RMS roughness of 1.67 nm in Fig. 5b. The smooth morphology of the PBDB-T:TTNC film reveals favorable intermolecular aggregation, which could promote the exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus leading to a higher FF and Jsc. From TEM images in Fig. 5c and d, the uniform phase separation and nanofibric interpenetrating network could be observed for the PBDB-T:TTNC film, which is in good agreement with the morphology feature in AFM images.

To investigate the micro-structural differentiation between TTIC and TTNC films, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D GIWAXS) was performed on the neat films as shown in Fig. S4b and c (ESI†). And the corresponding line-cut profiles were depicted in Fig. S4e and f (ESI†). A quite low intensity diffraction packing (100) and π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak can be observed for the TTIC film, while TTNC shows a more obvious π–π stacking (010) peak along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, suggesting a more ordered packing with a strong face-on orientation in the TTNC film. From the 1D line-cuts, the π–π stacking distance of TTNC was calculated to be 3.48 Å, which is slightly smaller than that of TTIC (3.55 Å), indicating the stronger face-on oriented molecular packing in the TTNC neat film. 2D GIWAXS patterns of the blend films were also captured as presented in Fig. 5e and f. It can be seen that both PBDB-T:TTNC and PBDB-T:TTIC blend films adopt a preferred face-on orientation inferred from the respective (010) peak in the OOP direction, which contributes to more efficient charge transport and thus the high FF and Jsc. According to the OOP curves in Fig. 5g, the PBDB-T:TTNC film exhibits a stronger (010) diffraction peak at 1.78 Å−1 with a smaller d-spacing of 3.53 Å compared with that of PBDB-T:TTIC at 1.75 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.59 Å), suggesting a more favorable molecular packing in the PBDB-T:TTNC film, thus facilitating charge dissociation and transport.
To further understand the superiority of NINCN substitution, the charge mobilities of the optimized PBDB-T:TTIC/TTNC were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole and electron mobilities were measured with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the hole and electron mobilities of PBDB-T:TTNC are estimated to be 1.79 × 10−4 and 1.74 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively, showing a more enhanced and balanced charge transport than that of the TTIC based device (1.60 × 10−4 and 1.51 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively), which results in a lower charge recombination in the PBDB-T:TTNC blend, thus contributing to the high FF.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a new NFA molecule named TTNC was designed and synthesized by replacing INCN of TTIC with a large π-conjugation group NINCN. Such a small structural change enables TTNC to show a red-shifted and stronger absorption, more ordered intermolecular aggregation. When blended with PBDB-T, the TTNC based film exhibits more favorable phase separation morphology and stronger face-on oriented molecular packing than that of the TTIC counterpart, which contribute to charge dissociation and transport, agreeing well with the results of SCLC. Therefore, the optimized devices of PBDB-T:TTNC exhibit a superior PCE of 11.34% compared with PBDB-T:TTIC based devices, benefiting from the enhanced Jsc of 20.95 mA cm−2, especially the greatly improved FF from 66% to 71%. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of TTNC based devices is also higher than that of the methyl or fluorine substituted TTIC derivative. These results demonstrate that the π-conjugation extension is a promising strategy to develop efficient NFAs for high-performance OSCs.
