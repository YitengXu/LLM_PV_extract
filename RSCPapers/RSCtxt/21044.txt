After 5 min of formic acid treatment at elevated temperature (140 °C), the average PCE of the device was improved from 8.00% to 9.22%. After the formic acid treatment, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film increased from 683 S cm−1 to 1582 S cm−1 and the average built-in voltage also increased from 0.44 V to 0.50 V. The larger built-in voltage can suppress the recombination of photogenerated charges in the hybrid solar cells and in turn render the silicon nanowire/PEDOT:PSS junction barrier closer to an ideal Mott–Schottky barrier. Through C–V and trap-state density calculations, we confirmed that this improvement was attributable to the decrease in the density of interfacial states in the hybrid solar cells after the formic acid treatment. Our findings indicate the critical roles of the polymer conductivity and the quality of the organic/inorganic interface in the performance of hybrid silicon nanowire/PEDOT:PSS solar cells.
1. Introduction
As an important alternative energy source to fossil fuels, solar energy can be used to produce electricity directly through solar cells. To date, although silicon-based solar cells still dominate the market, a number of novel photovoltaic devices based on other material systems, such as organic1 and perovskite materials,2 have been developed. One kind of solar cell that has also attracted much attention from the research community is hybrid cells, which combine the advantages of both organic and inorganic devices.3,4 For example, in silicon/organic photovoltaics, the high-temperature diffusion process can be eliminated, reducing energy consumption during solar cell production by 35%.5 As a result, the manufacturing cost of hybrid solar cells is significantly lower than that of their silicon counterparts.6,7 Among the various organic semiconductors that have been utilised in hybrid silicon solar cells, such as graphene,8,9 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),10 carbon nanotubes11–13 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),14,15 the latter is a promising candidate, due to its high optical transparency,16 good thermal stability17 and solution processability.18 However, at the same time, pristine PEDOT:PSS also suffers from low electrical conductivity (less than 1 S cm−1).19
The low conductivity of PEDOT:PSS suppresses carrier collection, promotes Joule heating and lowers the device efficiency. To overcome this challenge, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can be added to PEDOT:PSS as a co-solvent to increase the conductivity of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film20,21 and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of planar silicon/PEDOT:PSS solar cells.22,23 By adding 2.5% DMSO by weight to the PEDOT:PSS solution, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film can be enhanced considerably from less than 1 to around 99 S cm−1, and the PCE can be increased from 2.8% to 8.5%.22 The improvement in PCE is attributed to greater interconnection among the conduction paths in the DMSO-containing PEDOT:PSS films, allowing better transport and separation of the charge carriers in the solar cell.22,23 The conductivity can be further enhanced by using nitric acid vapour post-treatment. Zhao et al. demonstrated that the conductivity of a DMSO-containing PEDOT:PSS film could be increased from 300 to 1000 S cm−1 and the PCE of the planar silicon/PEDOT:PSS solar cell could be improved from 4.52% to 8.81% by exposing the device to a nitric acid vapour environment for around 10 s.24 However, the enhancement in efficiency of the hybrid solar cells reduced significantly if the nitric acid treatment duration exceeded the optimal duration. Moreover, it is also important and essential to maintain the gas/air mixture in homogeneous especially at the region contacting the PEDOT:PSS surface. Therefore, formic acid dropping method is selected because this liquid treatment can be carried out simply by dropping acid on the PEDOT:PSS films, that is more easy to control. Similarly, formic acid-treated PEDOT:PSS films have also been used to replace the tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) layer in flexible poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) polymer solar cells.25 Besides post-treatment processing of the PEDOT:PSS, the performance of silicon/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells can also be improved by modifying the surface morphology of the organic/inorganic interface: one effective way to do this is to convert the planar silicon into the form of nanowires (NWs). The increased junction area of the nanowires can enhance photon absorption and charge separation in the device.26,27 In this work, besides the increase in the PEDOT:PSS conductivity, we investigate the other possible factors causing the increase of the PCE in formic acid-treated SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS solar cells, with a special focus on the quality of the interface. The treatment was carried out by dropping formic acid onto a PEDOT:PSS thin film that had been annealed with 5 wt% DMSO. The formic acid-treated device showed an improved open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), and thus an improved PCE, reaching up to 9.22%. The reverse saturation current and ideality factor of the hybrid solar cell were also analysed by C–V measurements and the fitting of J–V curves to Lambert's W-function. By X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observed a decrease in the ratio of PSS to PEDOT in the surface composition of the formic acid-treated devices, such that the PEDOT aggregated at the surface layer. We further compared the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS interface quality in the hybrid solar cells before and after the formic acid treatment by evaluating the density of interface states. The density of interface states was found to be five times smaller in the formic acid-treated device.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Fabrication of hybrid solar cells
The 4 inches n-type silicon (100) wafers with resistivity of 1–10 Ω cm and thickness of 525 μm was cleaved into small square pieces of size 1 cm × 1 cm. They were cleaned, and underwent an electroless etching process to produce an array of silicon nanowires with a length of around 400 nm. In the electroless etching, the silicon wafers were immersed and etched for 5 min in a 0.023 M silver nitrate and 5.6 M hydrofluoric acid solution at room temperature. Then, they were soaked in concentrated nitric acid (65%). After the formation of the nanowires, the silicon wafers were immersed in dilute hydrofluoric acid to remove the native oxide, followed by 20 min of ambient air exposure to improve the surface wetting property. Pristine PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios PH1000 mixed with 5 wt% DMSO) was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore-size membrane and spin-coated onto the nanowire-textured silicon wafers at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The wet PEDOT:PSS films were annealed at 140 °C for 5 min. The size of the PEDOT:PSS film is around 1 cm × 1 cm. In our formic acid treatment, 100 μL of 98 wt% formic acid was dropped onto the annealed PEDOT:PSS film and then dried at 140 °C for another 5 min. In order to control the repeatability of the dropping process in the formic acid treatment, the volume of formic acid solution is accurately measured with a pipette. Moreover, the temperature during the drying process of the formic acid is monitored by a laser thermometer. Finally, the devices were finished by depositing silver anode fingers by screen-printing silver paste on top of the PEDOT:PSS, as well as depositing gallium–indium (GaIn) eutectic as a cathode on the reverse side of the silicon wafers. A schematic diagram of the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cell is shown in Fig. 1(a).

2.2 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the hybrid SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS solar cells were measured without encapsulation in air by a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter at conditions of 1 sun AM1.5 1000 W m−2, simulated by a solar simulator (SUN2000, Abet Technologies, Inc.). The transmittance values of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 4000). The conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured by four-point probe measurement (Lucas Labs 302) and a surface profiler (Tencor P10). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD) was performed using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.7 eV). XPS was used to measure the sulphur signal of the PEDOT and PSS compositions in the surface layer of the PEDOT:PSS thin film. The surface morphologies and phase images of the PEDOT:PSS films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoscope V with Multimode 8 controller). The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed with a semiconducting Device Analyzer (Agilent B1500A).
3. Results and discussion
The average performances of a total of 50 devices with and without formic acid treatment are shown in Table 1. The optical transmittance and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the pristine and treated films are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively.

Although a mild decrease in transmittance can be observed for wavelengths larger than 600 nm, the devices subjected to the formic acid treatment in general showed a higher open circuit voltage than the pristine devices. From the statistical study plotted in Fig. 2, it can be observed that the device-to-device variation was smaller in the formic acid-treated solar cells, and the averaged PCE increased from 8.00% (pristine) to 9.22% (treated), corresponding to a 15.3% improvement in the PCE. The solar cells' characteristic parameters, including light-generated current density (JL), reverse saturation current density (J0), ideality factor (n), series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh), were obtained by fitting the experimental J–V data with Lambert's W-function28 (the results are summarised in Table 2):

The Rs of the device decreased from 1.78 to 1.40 Ω cm2 after formic acid treatment, which agrees with the four-point probe conductivity measurements of the PEDOT:PSS films (683 S cm−1 for the pristine and 1582 S cm−1 for the treated film).
In contrast, the ideality factor, reverse saturation current density and shunt resistance all showed a decrease in the formic acid-treated devices. To confirm the origin of the increases in conductivity, we used XPS to examine the chemical composition at the surface of the PEDOT:PSS films (Fig. 3(a)). In the sulphur (2p) spectra of the films, the binding-energy peaks at 169 and 167.8 eV arise from the sulphur atoms in PSS, and those at 164.6 and 163.4 eV arise from the sulphur atoms in PEDOT.29 By comparing the areas of the energy peaks in Fig. 3(a), it can be calculated that the compositional ratio of PSS to PEDOT decreased from 2.94 (pristine) to 1.22 (treated). The reduction in the proportion of PSS suggests that a greater amount of hole-transporting PEDOT was able to connect with the silver grid anode, which would be expected to reduce the Rs of the device. From the height observed by AFM in Fig. 3(b and c), it can be observed that an aggregation of PEDOT appeared in the treated PEDOT:PSS film. The brighter and darker areas of the phase image in Fig. 3(d and e) represent the aggregated PEDOT and the PSS matrix, respectively. The separation distance between the hole-conductive PEDOT phases decreased after formic acid treatment, and thus improved interconnection of the PEDOT clusters is expected. The chemical nature of the influence of treating with HCOOH was that the protonation of PSS– by formic acid led to a neutral PSSH chains which can suppress the coulombic attraction between the positively charged PEDOT chains and neutral PSSH chains resulted in the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS. The smaller value of Rs also contributed to the improvement in the FF of the formic acid-treated devices. The averaged FF of the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells improved from 55.8% to 60.1% after formic acid treatment.

The built-in voltage (Vbi) of a diode provides important information on the quality of the junction. One way to evaluate Vbi is by using the x-axis intercept of the plot of 1/C2 vs. V, as shown in Fig. 4(a and b), i.e. Vx-int = Vbi − kBT/q. From the figures, it can be observed that the values of Vbi were quite similar for the pristine and formic acid-treated devices, being in both cases 0.62 V. However, these Vbi values do not match those obtained by the J–V method, wherein the Vbi values were calculated via the following equation:30 
Vbi = (−kBT/q)ln(J0/(A*T2)) − Vn
(2)where A* is the effective Richardson constant (252 A cm−2 K−2 for n-type silicon),31 and Vn = (kBT/q)ln(Nc/Nd), where Nc is the effective density of states in the conduction band of silicon (=3 × 1019 cm−3) and Nd is the doping level of silicon (=6 × 1014 cm−3). Using this equation to perform the fitting, the averaged built-in voltages were 0.44 V and 0.50 V for the pristine and formic acid-treated devices, respectively. While fitting the J–V curves of the 25 devices into eqn (1) and (2), we noticed that the built-in voltage and the ideality factor for the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells were linearly correlated. It can be observed from Fig. 4(c) that when n = 1, the Vbi value was around 0.62 V, which agrees with the result calculated from the C–V measurements. The deviation of the Vbi values between the C–V and J–V methods is actually related to the non-ideal (n > 1) behaviour of the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells. The use of the 1/C2 vs. V plot to calculate the built-in voltage in the absence of interface states, based on the Schottky–Mott relationship, assumes n = 1. As mentioned before, the fitted n values were equal to 2.57 and 2.16 for the pristine and formic acid-treated PEDOT:PSS, respectively. The deviation of both the ideality factor and the built-in voltage suggests that the junction between the SiNWs and PEDOT:PSS was non-ideal, and interface states in the hybrid solar cells cannot be ignored in determining the actual Vbi.

(c) Relationship between the ideality factor and the built-in voltage of the SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells. 
The origin and the density of the interface states are worthy of further study, because they are directly related to the performance of the hybrid solar cell. After the preparation of the silicon surface by etching with diluted hydrofluoric acid, the routine procedure of rinsing with de-ionised water followed by drying leads unavoidably to the growth of a thin insulating oxide film on the silicon surface. The thickness of the interfacial oxide layer present on a freshly prepared Si/PEDOT:PSS interface can reach approximately 1.5 nm.32 The relationship between the interface states density (Ds) and the ideality factor is given by the following equation:33 
(3)where δ is the interface oxide thickness, and εi and εs are the permittivity of the interfacial layer (≈3.5ε0) and the semiconductor (≈11.7ε0), respectively. W is the space charge width which can be evaluated by . Using Vbi values of 0.44 V for the pristine device and 0.50 V for the formic acid-treated device, the calculated values of W are approximately 0.97 and 1.04 μm, respectively. The interface states were composed of two parts, being equilibrated partly with the PEDOT:PSS (Ds,P) and partly with the silicon (Ds,Si). The two curves (open circles and open triangles) in Fig. 5 show the relationship between Ds,P and Ds,Si for n = 2.57 and n = 2.16, respectively. When the device was under zero bias, the two components (Ds,P and Ds,Si) constituted the interface-state charge QGS:34 QGS = qDs(qVbi + qVn − Eg + ϕCNL), where Ds = Ds,P + Ds,Si. They are represented in the energy band diagram in Fig. 6. On the other hand, by charge neutrality, QGS was also equal and opposite to the total charge developed on the PEDOT:PSS surface (QP) and in the space charge layer (QSC) in silicon, which can be written as follows:30 , where ϕP is the work function of PEDOT:PSS and χ is the electron affinity of silicon. Using the values in Table 3, we obtain Ds for the device before treatment as 1.45 × 1014 eV−1 cm−2 and after treatment as 2.66 × 1013 eV−1 cm−2, as shown by the two curves (black stars and red crosses, respectively) in Fig. 5. By locating these Ds and n values in Fig. 5, Ds,P and Ds,Si were 4.9 × 1013 and 9.7 × 1013 eV−1 cm−2, respectively, for the pristine devices and 0.5 × 1013 and 2.1 × 1013 eV−1 cm−2, respectively, for the formic acid-treated devices. Both Ds,P and Ds,Si decreased after formic acid treatment. The decrease in the total interface states density after formic acid treatment would be expected to result in a larger built-in voltage and barrier height (ϕBH = Vbi + Vn). The larger barrier height, in turn, would tend to suppress recombination at the junction between the treated PEDOT:PSS and silicon, compared with that at the pristine PEDOT:PSS/silicon junction, thus increasing the overall power conversion efficiency of the former.

4. Conclusions
The improvement of the PCE of SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells by formic acid treatment was investigated. The average performance of the treated devices showed a considerable enhancement from 8% to 9.22%. Four-point probe measurement showed that the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film after formic acid treatment was increased two-fold. Moreover, the XPS results indicated that the formic acid treatment led to a larger PEDOT domain in the PEDOT:PSS film, which benefits charge separation and collection. We further confirmed the improvement of the PCE by evaluating the number of interface states in the non-treated and treated devices. We observed a five-fold decrease in the density of interface states in the device after formic acid treatment. These findings not only quantify the level of interface states in the hybrid solar cell, but also provide direct evidence that formic acid treatment is highly effective for improving the efficiency of SiNWs/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells.
