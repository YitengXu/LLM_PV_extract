    , Accepted 7th July 2015First published on 7th July 2015AbstractSince the first description by Fievet, Lagier and Figlarz in 1989, the synthesis of nanoparticles in high-boiling, multivalent alcohols – so-called polyols – has been developed into a widely applied strategy, and nowadays belongs to the standard repertoire for preparing high-quality nanomaterials. The polyols take advantage of several features such as: (i) water-comparable solubility of simple metal-salt precursors; (ii) high boiling points (up to 320 °C); (iii) reducing properties for the instantaneous synthesis of metals; (iv) coordinating properties for surface functionalization and colloidal stabilisation of nanoparticles; (v) wide adaptability of the polyols ranging from low-weight ethylene glycol (EG) to high-weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs). This review summarises the status and perspectives on nanoscaled elemental metals, metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, and non-metal elements that were prepared via the polyol synthesis. Moreover, we summarize our results and concepts to expand the limits of the polyol synthesis. This includes strategies for less-noble metal synthesis, phase transfer reactions, photochemical reduction, NMR-based characterisation of polyol-functionalised nanoparticles, realisation of phase-pure and readily crystalline metal tungstates, stabilisation of low-melting elements, and controlled thermal decomposition of polyols to obtain high-quality, lanthanide-modified carbon dots (C-dots).H.

1. Introduction
The polyol synthesis designates the liquid-phase synthesis in high-boiling, multivalent alcohols and is mainly directed to nanoparticles. Chemically, the polyol family starts with ethylene glycol (EG) as its simplest representative. Based on EG, the polyols comprise two main series of molecules (Table 1): (i) diethylene glycol (DEG), triethylene glycol (TrEG),† tetraethylene glycol (TEG),† and so on up to polyethylene glycol (PEG), with the latter containing more than 2000 ethylene groups and having a molecular weight up to 100000 g mol−1;1 (ii) propanediol (PDO), butanediol (BD), pentanediol (PD), and so on. Moreover, glycerol (GLY), pentaerythritol (PE), and carbohydrates chemically belong to the polyols. From this huge group of polyols, EG, DEG, GLY, and BD are generally most often applied to prepare nanoparticles.

The use of polyols for the synthesis of small particles was first reported in 1989 by Fievet, Lagier and Figlarz,2 who also introduced the term “polyol process” or “polyol synthesis” with their work. The polyol synthesis started with Co, Ni, Cu, and Pt particles2 and was extended to further metals, intermetallics and alloys such as Re, Ru, Rh, Au, Sn, Co20Ni80, FeNi, CoxCu1−x, CoxCu1−x, or FeCoNi, especially, driven by Fievet's group in Paris,3 but as well by Chow et al.4 Right at the beginning, the as-prepared metal particles were mainly micron-sized, with typical diameters of 0.5–5 μm.3 The high quality of the as-prepared metal particles – in terms of uniform size and shape as well as low degree of agglomeration – already gave a first glimpse of the impact of the polyol synthesis at an early stage. Nevertheless, it took a considerable period of time for the method to attract significant attention in the scientific community. Thus, the number of papers related to the polyol synthesis of nanoparticles remained below 100 per year till about 2000.5 Since then the annual publication output increased continuously to more than 1000 papers in 2014.
In general, the polyols provide a variety of advantages. First of all, the sheer multitude of available polyols allows for enormous adaptability and flexibility of the polyol synthesis. As a matter of principle, the boiling point of the polyols increases with the number of OH-functionalities and with increasing molecular weight (Table 1). Similarly, the polarity and viscosity of the polyols increase with increasing molecular weight. PEGs with comparably low molecular weight (<1000 g mol−1), for instance, are viscous and colourless liquids, while high-molecular-weight PEGs are waxy, white solids (>1000 g mol−1).6
The most important feature of the polyols is what can be considered as water-equivalent but high-boiling solvents. Hence, polyols show solubilities of compounds similar to water, which allows using simple, low-cost metal salts (e.g., halides, nitrates, sulfates) as starting materials. Moreover, the insolubility and precipitation of products in the polyol – as they are a prerequisite for obtaining nanoparticles – can be assessed from their insolubility in water, too. Whereas the solubility of polar compounds and salts in water is driven by the enormous polarity (i.e. relative permittivity εr(H2O): 80 at 20 °C),7 the polyols are much less polar (εr(GLY): 43; εr(EG): 37; εr(DEG): 32; all at 20 °C).7 However, the lower polarity is compensated by the chelating properties of the polyols, which – in sum – results in a water-comparable solubility. The chelating effect of the polyols, moreover, is highly beneficial for controlling particle nucleation, particle growth and agglomeration of nanoparticles as the polyols adhere on the particle surface (especially on oxides) and serve as colloidal stabilisers. In this regard, the comparably high viscosity of the polyols is also a benefit (especially in comparison with water).
In addition to the excellent colloidal stabilisation, the high boiling points of the polyols are advantageous as they allow for synthesis temperatures of 200–320 °C without the necessity of high pressure and autoclaves (Table 1).7 Often, the high temperature of synthesis allows obtaining crystalline nanomaterials right from the liquid phase. Thus, a powder post-sintering for crystallization can be avoided that may otherwise result in uncontrolled particle growth and agglomeration. High crystallinity of nanomaterials, on the other hand, is a major issue in view of optimal material properties. Hence, catalysts, fluorescent materials, colour pigments, transparent oxide conductors, semiconductors, superconductors, fast-ion conductors and many other types of functional materials essentially require high crystallinity to evolve their full potential of properties and functions.8 As all these aspects involve the absorption, emission and/or transport of electrons, defective solids would cause multiple competitive trap and loss processes.9 In this regard, nanomaterials are anyway handicapped in comparison to infinite, periodic bulk compounds as already the particle surface itself represents a major intrinsic defect.
The conflicting antipodes of high synthesis temperatures to support crystallization but low temperatures to avoid particle agglomeration certainly apply for all types of nanomaterial synthesis. Here, the coordinating properties of the polyols for surface functionalization and colloidal stabilisation are one of the assets of the polyol synthesis. The maximum temperature that is practically available for synthesis, however, is not only defined by the boiling point of the polyols but as well limited by their thermal decomposition. Effects such as dehydration, oxidation, decarboxylation, and polymerization lead to a decomposition that accelerates rapidly from about 50 °C below the boiling point. Naturally, the thermal decomposition is influenced by the starting materials as well. Further beneficial features of the polyols relate to: (i) the reductive properties allowing for direct preparation of elemental metals; (ii) a comparably straightforward removal of the polyols from the particle surface subsequent to synthesis; (iii) the scalability and implementation as continuous-flow synthesis.
Apart from nanoparticle synthesis, polyols have outstanding technical relevance, for instance, as standard solvents, dewatering agents, coolants and heat transfer agents, plasticisers, antifreeze agents, additives in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry, and precursors to polymers. Moreover, polyols are of low to moderate toxicity and highly biodegradable (especially in comparison to many other conventional solvents). Especially, glycerol is widespread in animate beings (e.g. anti-freeze agent in blood). Some natural oils (e.g., castor oil, soy oil, canola oil, sunflower oil), moreover, contain high amounts of polyols (mainly EG). GLY and some PEG derivatives even have FDA approval and are used as food additives. Taken together with the high boiling points and high flash points, polyols can be considered as green solvents. On the other hand, EG and DEG – although moderately toxic – can lead to similar effects as methanol if incorporated in higher concentrations (oral LD50(EG): 1.4 mL kg−1, oral LD50(DEG): 1.0 mL kg−1).10 Altogether, polyols can be considered as green, biocompatible, biodegradable and sustainable solvents, which is also highly relevant for the industrial synthesis of nanoparticles via polyol synthesis.
Based on the above general considerations, this review summarises the status of nanomaterials that have been prepared via polyol synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss our results and strategies to expand the limits of the method, including the synthesis of less-noble metal nanoparticles, NMR-based characterisation of polyol-functionalised nanoparticles, readily crystalline ternary metal tungstates, or the polyol synthesis of carbon dots (C-dots). In summary, this review comprises three main topics:
(1) The polyol synthesis of metal nanoparticles;
(2) The polyol synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles;
(3) The polyol synthesis of nanoscaled metal chalcogenides and non-metal main-group elements.
In view of hundreds of annual papers that are related to polyol synthesis, of course, it is necessary to select specific examples and to set certain limits on the topic. Thus, this review will not address PEG surface functionalization of nanoparticles (so-called PEGylation)11 since it does not essentially refer to the synthesis of nanoparticles. PEGylation, nevertheless, belongs to the most widely applied techniques to establish biocompatible surfaces for cell uptake of nanoparticles.11 This review will also not discuss related approaches such as sol–gel synthesis (mainly in primary alcohols),12 non-hydrolytic sol–gel processes (mainly in benzyl alcohol),13 carbohydrate-based methods,14etc., since no polyols in the sense of this review are used.
2. Polyol synthesis of metal nanoparticles
Metals were the very first compounds that have been realised by the polyol method.2,15 As discussed before (cf. Introduction), polyols offer two most relevant advantages. Simple metal salts can be used as starting materials due to water-comparable polarity and solubility of the polyols. This is much more straightforward in terms of costs and practical handling as compared with, for instance, volatile and reactive carbonyl metals or advanced organometallic compounds. As another important advantage, the polyols become reductive at elevated temperature. Accordingly, the polyol can instantaneously reduce dissolved metal cations to readily form metal nanoparticles with sufficient surface functionalization and stabilisation in the excess polyol solvent. In this regard, the polyol synthesis can be considered as a one-pot reaction combining several features at the same time.
The coordination of metal cations in the polyol solution and the following reduction to elemental metals have been addressed via theoretical approaches as well. Patrice et al., for instance, deduced the reducibility of metals in different polyols based on thermodynamic considerations.16 Recently, Carpenter et al.17 and Zahn et al.18 have modelled the interaction of the polyols with the surface of the metal particles resulting in detailed insights regarding the mechanism of reduction and the shape of the resulting metal nanoparticles. Although such in-depth theoretical studies are comparably rare by now, they are extremely valuable to understand the mechanism of the polyol synthesis in detail.
Besides its obvious advantages, the polyol synthesis of metal nanoparticles has limitations because of two major aspects: (i) the reducing power of the polyol is restricted; (ii) non-polar metal surfaces are often insufficiently stabilised by the polar polyol. Regarding the first issue, polyol synthesis is most suited to obtain nanoparticles of comparable noble metals such as the coinage or platinum metals (Table 2).15,19 Aiming at less-noble metals, the reducing power of the polyol – even at high temperatures (>230 °C) – reaches its limit. Even if the reduction still occurs, rapid thermal decomposition of the polyol impedes nucleation of high-quality nanoparticles and hampers their separation subsequent to synthesis. Moreover, less-noble metals can be re-oxidised by the polyol when lowering the temperature. For that matter, Co0 and Ni0 are well-known examples: while the reducing power of the polyols at high temperature (>150 °C) supports the reduction of Co2+/Ni2+ to Co0/Ni0, the chelating effect of the polyols and the presence of OH-groups force re-oxidation to Co2+/Ni2+ at lower temperature (<150 °C).2a,15,20

As an expansion of the limits towards less-noble metals, mild basic conditions – for instance by using acetates as starting materials – can be used to prepare Ni0 or Co0via the polyol synthesis (Table 2).15 Metals such as In0 or Sn0 can only be obtained at high temperatures (>200 °C) or in the presence of additional, stronger reducing agents (e.g. NaBH4).19d,21 However, oxygen impurities due to partial re-oxidation can hardly be avoided. Besides Fe–Co and Fe–Ni alloys, elemental iron can be considered as the most reactive metal that has been realised by polyol reduction. Here, Balachandrian et al. obtained Fe0 with diameters of 10–150 nm in boiling EG with Pt-seeds to support nucleation.22 However, the Fe0 particles need to be stabilised with an iron oxide shell for passivation. Very recently, different bismuth-based alloys and intermetallics (e.g., Bi3Ir, Bi2Ir, BiRh) emerged. For example, Ruck et al. prepared Bi3Ir via the polyol synthesis and observed a unique reversible oxygen intercalation.23
Apart from synthesis, size variation and material properties are subjects of intense research activities (Table 2). Thus, catalysis (e.g., hydrogenation, CO/CH4/CH3OH oxidation, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, fuel cells) and magnetism (e.g., magnetic recording, magnetic liquids, drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging) are major issues.49 Many of these aspects related to polyol-made metal nanoparticles have been comprehensively reviewed by Fievet et al.15 Apart from metals, moreover, metal carbides (e.g., Co3C, Co2C, Ni3C) have been recently prepared via the polyol synthesis and are highly interesting as high-coercivity magnetic nanomaterials.50 Recent activities related to application (e.g., catalysis, photocatalysis, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, thermoelectrics), moreover, show that polyol-made metal nanoparticles are ideal for direct deposition on certain substrates (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphite, graphene, titania, alumina).51 In view of ecological, large-scale processes, noteworthily, castor oil can be applied as a “bio-polyol” as an alternative to conventional polyols. Here, Ni0 nanoparticles were obtained in a similar quality as those obtained, for instance, from EG or DEG.52
The accessible size of polyol-made metal nanoparticles, at first, was mainly limited to the micron- and sub-micron range (i.e., 0.5–10 μm).15 This can be ascribed to the fact that the polar polyols – although highly advantageous for dissolving simple metal salts as precursors – are less suited for the stabilisation of non-polar metal surfaces. Often, the use of seed crystals (e.g., Ag, Pt) can support the formation of small-sized metal particles with diameters <20 nm (Table 2).2a,15,22 Today, the size and shape of metal nanoparticles can be controlled with tremendous preciseness (Table 2). In view of the polyol synthesis, major advances in shape control have been achieved in recent years by Xia et al.53 As an outstanding example they could precisely tailor the size of silver cubes in a range of 18–32 nm by using the different viscosities of EG and DEG.54 By appropriate selection of polyol and reaction temperature, moreover, Schaak et al. managed to obtain Rh0 nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes.55 By using different polyols, a similar size control was also found by Liu et al. for Ru0 nanoparticles56 as well as by Park et al. for Ag0 nanoparticles.57 Most often, however, additional stabilising agents (e.g., poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/PVP, oleylamine, acetate ions, halide ions) are required to precisely adjust a certain shape of metal nanoparticles (Table 2).58 As the polyols are not causal in these cases and since excellent reviews, e.g., by Fievet, Schaak, Wang, Xia, or Yang et al. are available,15b,53,59 shape control is not discussed in detail here.
2.1 Polyol synthesis of less-noble metals
With regard to less-noble metal nanoparticles, the synthesis generally becomes the more challenging, the lower the relevant electrochemical potential of the metal is. By using Pt seeds to support the nucleation of Fe0 nanoparticles, Balachandrian et al. impressively showed that the restrictions of the polyol synthesis can be expanded, nevertheless.22 As another option, we used the strategy to add a more powerful reducing agent than the polyol. Although no longer used for reduction, the polyol as the liquid phase still has the advantage to be a water-comparable, high-boiling solvent with coordinative features that allow controlling particle size and growth. Moreover, the reductive features of the polyols support the chemical stability of the less-noble metals. As an example, we have used this strategy for In0 nanoparticles that were prepared via NaBH4-driven reduction of indium chloride in DEG.60 A similar strategy was also applied, for instance, by Lee et al. to obtain Sn0 nanoparticles.46 Furthermore, we have applied a citrate functionalization to improve the chemical and colloidal stability in the polyol.
Specifically, In0 nanoparticles were obtained by injection of concentrated aqueous NaBH4 into a solution of InCl3·4H2O and sodium citrate in DEG at 100 °C.60 The formation of In0 is indicated by instantaneous formation of a brownish to greyish suspension immediately after the injection of NaBH4 (Fig. 1a). By the variation of the amount of NaBH4 (5–25 mmol), the particle size of the as-prepared In0 nanoparticles can be controlled within a size range of 8–100 nm (Fig. 1b and c).60 All suspensions show excellent colloidal and chemical stability – thus, even on a weeks’ timescale neither agglomeration nor re-oxidation was observed. Both can be reliably verified via dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (i.e., determination of particle size and size distribution), and optical spectroscopy (UV-Vis) (i.e., determination of surface plasmon resonance).60
 Fig. 1  NaBH4-supported polyol synthesis of citrate-functionalised In0 nanoparticles of different sizes (samples A, B, and C): (a) In0 suspensions in DEG; (b) DLS; (c) electron microscopy (modified from ref. 60). 
In fact, the excellent colloidal and chemical stabilities of the as-prepared In0 nanoparticles are quite surprising. With regard to the low electrochemical potential of elemental indium (E0(In): −0.34 V),61 fast re-oxidation would be expected for suspensions in protic solvents such as the polyols as well as for powder samples in contact with air. Actually, the In0 nanoparticles as both suspensions in DEG/ethanol and powder samples show fast agglomeration and re-oxidation if sodium citrate is not used for surface functionalization. Such a citrate functionalization of metal nanoparticles, in general, is well-known to control colloidal stability. Here, the formation of gold nanoparticles via citrate-driven KAuCl4 reduction and instantaneous stabilisation according to Turkevich can be considered as the most prominent example.62 Moreover, citrate functionalization has been successfully used for the liquid-phase synthesis and the colloidal stabilisation of Co, Cu, Ag, Pd, and Pt nanoparticles.63 Less-noble metals such as In0, however, and their excellent oxidation stability after citrate functionalization have been barely reported so far.60 The presence of citrate on the nanoparticle surface was verified, for instance, by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).
The oxidation stability of citrate-functionalised In0 nanoparticles can be qualitatively followed based on the colour of the suspensions (Fig. 1a). Here, re-oxidation to In(OH)3/In2O3 would lead to colourless suspensions remaining after a certain period (2–12 h). As the In0 nanoparticles show distinct surface-plasmon resonance absorption, the observed colour is sensitive to the composition of the particle surface and can be quantified via UV-Vis spectroscopy.60 Moreover, the X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD) indicate the presence of metallic indium and the absence of (crystalline) impurities (e.g., In(OH)3 and In2O3) (Fig. 2). Even the formation of eventual non-crystalline oxide shells on the particles can be excluded when considering the intensity and width of the Bragg peaks. As any oxidation of the In0 nanoparticles would start from their surface, the formation of non-crystalline oxide shells would result in two effects: (i) the Bragg peaks of the remaining metallic In0 core would broaden with increasing thickness of the oxide shell, and therefore decrease the diameter of the crystalline metallic core; (ii) the proceeding oxidation of crystalline metallic In0 would lead to a reduced intensity of the Bragg peaks.60 According to detailed examination of the (101) Bragg peak exhibiting the highest intensity, both effects do not occur (Fig. 2). This holds true even for In0 powder samples that were left in contact with air for 8 weeks.
 Fig. 2  XRD of citrate-functionalised In0 nanoparticles: as-prepared, powder sample stored in air for 8 weeks, bulk reference (modified from ref. 60). 
As an additional reducing agent (e.g. NaBH4) and the citrate functionalization together result in a valuable expansion of the polyol synthesis, we intended to apply this strategy to other metals. Hence, the polyol synthesis of Cu0 nanoparticles is shown as our second example.64 The potential application of Cu0 nanoparticles for printable thin film electronics, for instance, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, thin film transistors (TFT), ultra-high frequency (UHF) antennas, membrane keyboards, solar cells or battery testers, is obvious.65 Currently, these applications are dominated by silver. In view of the spot price and concerns regarding biocidity, however, replacement with copper is favoured.66 The use of copper nanoparticles and thin films, however, is often limited by fast re-oxidation when being in contact with air.65,66
Adopting the strategy discussed for In0, Cu0 nanoparticles, 20 nm in diameter, were similarly obtained by NaBH4-driven reduction of CuCl2·2H2O in DEG in the presence of sodium citrate (Fig. 3a).64 The course of the reaction is somewhat different from the In0 nanoparticles because copper citrate nanoparticles (Cu3(citrate)2) were formed as an intermediate in a first step (Fig. 3a).64 Upon injection of NaBH4, these intermediate nanoparticles were reduced to Cu0 nanoparticles (Fig. 3a).64 The as-prepared, citrate-functionalised Cu0 nanoparticles, again, show excellent colloidal and oxidation stability as validated by DLS, SEM, and UV-Vis (Fig. 3a and b).64 Even after 14 months of storage in air, citrate-functionalised Cu0 powders do not show any significant oxidation as indicated by the unaltered intensity and width of the respective Bragg peaks (Fig. 3c). Via simple solvent evaporation, porous Cu0 thin films could be realised that exhibit a resistivity as low as 3 × 10−4 Ω cm after sintering at 220 °C in forming gas. With this measure, the citrate functionalization is thermally removed establishing electronic contact between the copper nanoparticles.64

Based on the successful polyol synthesis of In0 and Cu0 nanoparticles, the synthesis of intermetallic Cu–In nanoparticles seemed obvious. Thus, using InCl3·4H2O and CuCl2·2H2O as the starting materials in DEG, NaBH4-driven reduction and citrate functionalization resulted in intermetallic Cu11In9 nanoparticles exhibiting a mean diameter of 15 nm (Fig. 4).21b Like In0 and Cu0, the citrate functionalization guarantees colloidal stability and prevents agglomeration and air oxidation. Even re-dispersion of citrate-functionalised, dried Cu11In9 powder samples is possible (e.g. in ethanol) resulting in an almost similar mean size and size distribution to that for the pristine polyol-made Cu11In9 (Fig. 4a). Such Cu11In9 nanoparticles are well-suited for printing of thin films that can be converted via subsequent selenization to CuInSe2 (CIS) thin film solar cells.67 Such polyol-made Cu11In9 nanoparticles have already led to CIS thin film solar cells with power-conversion efficiencies up to 9%.21b

While the citrate functionalization of less-noble metal nanoparticles can be an interesting expansion of the polyol synthesis, we would like to discuss another option as well: the stabilisation of less-noble metals via phase-transfer separation. As discussed for In0, Cu0 and Cu11In9, the stability of the as-prepared, less-noble metals against re-oxidation becomes the more challenging, the lower the electrochemical potential of the respective metal is. In this regard, oxygen and moisture from the surrounding atmosphere can be excluded by using inert conditions and proper drying of the polyol. Water resulting from the dehydration of the polyol solvent and the intrinsic presence of the OH-group, however, are restrictions that can hardly be avoided in a polyol solvent. Here, another option is to transfer the less-noble metal nanoparticles directly after reduction and nucleation via phase-transfer separation into an inert solvent (e.g. alkane). Such a phase transition from the polar polyol to a non-polar inert solvent naturally requires a suitable phase-transfer agent. As an example, such a synthesis strategy is shown here for In0 nanoparticles that were extracted into dodecane upon the addition of oleylamine as a phase-transfer agent.60a,68
The synthesis of In0 nanoparticles was performed similarly to the previous discussion. Thus, InCl3·4H2O was used as a conventional, low-cost indium precursor and heated to 100 °C in DEG (Fig. 5). Thereafter, a solution of NaBH4 as the reducing agent in DEG was injected. Almost instantaneously after injection, the colourless InCl3·4H2O solution turned into a blackish suspension (Fig. 5). Herein, the colloidal stability is limited. The nanoparticles show rapid agglomeration, a comparably large size (38 nm) and a broad size distribution. This finding can be ascribed to the fact that DEG as a polar solvent is a non-optimal stabiliser of the hydrophobic metal surface. Apart from the limited colloidal stability, the as-prepared In0 nanoparticles are slowly re-oxidised due to the presence of water (e.g. non-dried DEG, InCl3·4H2O). This re-oxidation can be followed by the naked eye as the blackish suspension changes to a colourless suspension within about 60 min. Although In0 can be obtained, in sum, the metal is not stable in the polyol medium, which comes not as a surprise in view of its electrochemical potential (E0(bulk In0): −0.34 V).61
 Fig. 5  Polyol synthesis of In0 nanoparticles with subsequent oleylamine-driven phase-transfer separation into dodecane, and final Laux-like oxidation to In2O3 nanoparticles (reproduction from ref. 68). 
To separate and stabilise the as-prepared In0 nanoparticles, a phase transfer was involved with the polar DEG phase being topped by a non-polar dodecane phase (Fig. 5). This two-phase system was heated to 100 °C and stirred vigorously to allow for intensive emulsification prior to injecting a solution of NaBH4 and oleylamine in DEG. Oleylamine as the phase-transfer agent is soluble in DEG as well as in dodecane. Right after reduction and nucleation of In0, the nanoparticles are instantaneously functionalised by oleylamine (Fig. 5).68,69 Due to alkyl termination, the oleylamine-capped In0 nanoparticles become hydrophobic and migrate to the dodecane phase (Fig. 5). When the vigorous stirring was stopped, the system showed phase separation into a light yellow DEG solution as the bottom phase and a blackish dodecane suspension as the top phase. The In0-containing dodecane phase can be easily separated and turned out to be highly stable. The nanoparticle suspensions show neither agglomeration nor any oxidation on a timescale of several weeks even when stored in contact with air. According to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the nanoparticles exhibit a mean size of 11(1) nm at a narrow size distribution (Fig. 6a). Lattice fringes with a distance of 2.73 Å are in good agreement with bulk indium (d(101) with 2.72 Å). Apart from colloidal and chemical stability, the phase transfer allows an easy separation of the In0 nanoparticles from non-reacted starting materials and salts (e.g., NaCl, NaBH4, InCl3·4H2O) that remain in the DEG phase. Moreover, larger particles and agglomerates do not show any phase transfer. Thus, the phase transfer is a well-suited method for the preparation, separation, purification and stabilisation of In0 nanoparticles that could be generalised to other less-noble metal nanoparticles (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 6  Laux-like oxidation of In0 nanoparticles to In2O3 nanoparticles: (a) In0 nanoparticles after polyol synthesis (in DEG); (b) In2O3 nanoparticles after oleylamine-driven phase-transfer separation and nitrobenzene-driven oxidation (in dodecane) (modified from ref. 68). 
Since less-noble nanoparticles such as In0 are highly reactive, they can also be used as starting materials in follow-up reactions. Such concepts have already been shown for different synthesis strategies, including polyol synthesis, microemulsion synthesis, and oleylamine-based synthesis.59,70 Typically, the synthesis of the initial metal nanoparticles and the subsequent follow-up reaction are performed in the same liquid phase. An additional option is to separate metal reduction and the follow-up reaction to different liquid phases. Following the above described oleylamine-driven phase transfer of In0 nanoparticles from polar DEG into non-polar dodecane, the follow-up reaction is here performed in the dodecane phase.68 The fact that oleylamine-capped In0 nanoparticles in dodecane exhibit excellent colloidal and chemical stability is of course highly beneficial in view of such follow-up reactions.
As an example, we address the controlled oxidation of In0 nanoparticles to In2O3 as the follow-up reaction. Nitrobenzene has been chosen as an oxidation agent that is soluble in the non-polar alkane phase (Fig. 5). Thus, the conditions follow the so-called Laux process – an industrial process that is used for the production of aniline via reduction of nitrobenzene with elemental iron. Although already invented by Julius Laux in 1925,71 nitrobenzene as a mild molecular oxidizing agent (E0(C6H5NO2): +1.22 V)72 has not been used for controlled oxidation of nanoparticles in hydrophobic media. Specifically, the In0 nanoparticles were oxidised to In2O3 after the addition of nitrobenzene simply by heating the dodecane phase (2 h, 170 °C).68 The completeness of the oxidation can be followed by the colour change from the blackish In0 suspension to a yellowish-white In2O3 suspension (Fig. 6b).
In fact, it is not surprising that In0 nanoparticles can be oxidised to In2O3. The added value of this Laux-type oxidation is related to the fact that metal nanoparticles can be oxidised in an alkane-phase to metal oxide nanoparticles retaining colloidal stability, particle size and size distribution.68 Moreover, the polarity of the particle surface has changed from a non-polar metal to a polar oxide without any modification of the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles (Fig. 5). The mean diameter of In2O3 (14 nm) fits very well with the pristine In0 nanoparticles (11 nm) (Fig. 6). The presence of crystalline In2O3 was confirmed by HRTEM images showing lattice distances of 2.88 Å (bulk In2O3: d(222) with 2.92 Å) (Fig. 6b). Altogether, the reaction sequence – including reduction of a metal, phase-transfer separation, follow-up reaction – can be useful for other indium compounds (e.g., InN, InP, InAs, In2S3, In2Se3 or intermetallics).
Well-controlled multi-sequential reactions at specific functional groups are generally well-known in organic chemistry taking advantage of a kinetic reaction control under mild conditions.73 As a consequence, a precise fine-tuning of reactivity and the formation of various metastable products are possible. In contrast, conventional inorganic solids typically require much higher activation energies for the interdiffusion of atoms. Therefore, kinetic reaction control and multistep-reaction sequences are much less feasible.73 Nanoparticles as intermediates between finite molecules and infinite solids, however, are predestined for kinetically controlled multi-step reactions. Well-known examples are here related to advanced nanoparticle heterostructures such as elaborate core–shell, Janushead-like or polyhedral systems.74 In this context, the sequence: (i) reduction of InCl3·4H2O; (ii) nucleation of In0 nanoparticles; (iii) phase-transfer separation of In0; and (iv) Laux-type oxidation of In0 to In2O3 retaining the size and shape, in principle, is comparable to the reduction of a halogen alkane to an alkane and subsequent oxidation to an alcohol under retention of the molecule's backbone in organic chemistry.
2.3 Photochemical reduction of metals
In addition to the combination of NaBH4-driven reduction with citrate functionalization or phase transfer, we will discuss a third option for metal nanoparticle formation in polyol media: photochemical reduction. While the thermal reduction of metals in polyols is long-known and widely applied,15 photochemical reduction of metals is much more specialised and succeeds only for specific metals. This is shown by way of examples for bismuth nanoparticles.75
In principle, photochromic effects of bismuth halides are well known76 and are based on a radical mechanism. Thus, light is absorbed via the halide-to-bismuth charge transfer resulting in the formation of intermediate Bi2+ radicals disproportionating subsequently to Bi3+ and Bi0.75b,77 A similar photochromic effect was observed for BiCl3 solutions in polyols (e.g. DEG) as well. Thus, colourless and transparent BiCl3 solutions under daylight illumination turn into deep black suspensions on a minute's timescale due to the photochemical formation of Bi0 nanoparticles with mean diameters of 10–20 nm (Fig. 7).75a The photochemical formation of Bi0 nanoparticles comes along with an oxidation of DEG. The formation of Bi0 and the blackening of the suspension are reversible upon contact with air, leading to a re-oxidation and dissolution of the Bi0 nanoparticles (Fig. 7).75a In sum, reversible light absorption/blackening and air-oxidation/decolourization are observed and can be as well quantified by UV-Vis spectroscopy.75a
 Fig. 7  Photochemical formation of Bi0 nanoparticles in DEG: reversible blackening upon daylight illumination (Bi3+ → Bi0) and subsequent decolourization in contact with air (Bi0 → Bi3+) (modified from ref. 75a). 
In addition to the above mentioned photochromic effect, the light-induced redox process also allows establishing a simple electrochemical cell (Fig. 8).75a Herein, a significant electrochemical voltage can be measured that indicates the intensity as well as the incidence of incoming light. Due to the simplicity of the setup, the effect might be of interest to low-cost self-dimming foils, facile optical marking of light-sensitive polymers or low-cost light-sensitive sensors.

3. Polyol synthesis of oxide nanoparticles
Due to the water-comparable and chelating features, polyols are ideal for the synthesis of oxide nanoparticles. Again, simple metal salts (e.g., halides, nitrates, acetates, alcoholates) can be used as the starting materials (cf. Introduction). Furthermore, the polyol solvent instantaneously coordinates to the as-formed particle nuclei which allows for excellent control of particle size, size distribution and agglomeration. Moreover, the removal of low-molecular-weight polyols (e.g., EG, DEG, PDO, BD, and GLY) from the particle surface subsequent to synthesis is comparably straightforward and can be conducted, e.g., by: (i) washing (i.e., repeated centrifugation and re-dispersion) with water;78 (ii) exchange by more strongly coordinating agents (e.g., amines and carboxylates);60a,68 (iii) thermal treatment at 200–320 °C.79
Other than the temperature, the duration of the reaction, the concentration, and the type of precursor addition, the reaction can be controlled by the concentration of available water. For the formation of oxides, the presence of water is of course essential and can be varied by using the intrinsic condensation of the polyols only (for low H2O concentrations), by using hydrates as the starting materials (for medium H2O concentrations), or by adding separate portions of water (for high H2O concentrations).79 In general, the particle size is larger the higher the concentrations of starting materials and water. Hot injection of starting materials and/or water, in alternative, often result in very small particles. The minimum particle size is typically limited by the solubility of the respective product compound in the polyol. For very small particles, the coordination complexes of the metal cation and the polyol become more stable than the insoluble oxide. Typically, the polyol synthesis yields colloidally stable suspensions of almost non-agglomerated nanoparticles (1–200 nm in size) with solid contents up to 20 wt% (Table 3).

A specific asset of the polyols regarding the synthesis of oxide nanoparticles is related to the high boiling point (Table 1). Therefore, highly crystalline oxide nanomaterials can be often readily obtained from the liquid phase without the need of any thermal post-sintering of powders. As highly crystalline nanoparticles, the materials can evolve their full potential regarding properties and function straight from the liquid phase. For specific materials, microwave118 or sonochemical119 heating – comprehensively reviewed by Chen et al., Niederberger et al., Kappe et al., and Gedanken et al. – can be superior in terms of particle size and crystallinity as compared to conventional resistance heating. This, however, is not an exclusive feature of the polyol synthesis.
While the polyol synthesis originates from metal particles,2 ZnO and CoO nanoparticles were already reported by Fievet et al. in 1994.15b,20,120 Starting in 2000, we were able to expand the polyol synthesis to a wide range of oxide nanoparticles,78,121 including various nanoscaled functional materials such as fluorescent nanoparticles (e.g., LaPO4:Ce,Tb, CaF2:Ce,Tb, In2(MoO4)3:Eu),122 colour pigments (e.g., CoAl2O4, Cr2O3, ZnO:Co, (Ti0.85Ni0.05Nb0.10)O2, α-Fe2O3, Cu(Fe,Cr)O4, TiO2),121b,122c,123 transparent oxide conductors (e.g., In2O3:Sn, SnO2:F, ZnO:Al, ZnO:In)124 and catalysts (e.g., CuMoO4, CeO2, Mn3O4, V2O5) (Fig. 9).122a,122c
 Fig. 9  Overview of nanoscaled functional oxides obtained from the polyol synthesis.78,121–124 
Nowadays, a huge variety of oxide nanoparticles is accessible via the polyol synthesis, including various compositions, shapes, types of doping, and particle sizes (Table 3). As broad as the chemical composition is the potential of polyol-made oxides regarding properties and application that include catalysis (e.g., with MnO2, Mn3O4, Fe2O3, Cu2O, NiCo2O4), photocatalysis (e.g., with Cu2O, ZnO, BiVO4), sensors (e.g., with Fe2O3, CuO), magnetic oxides (e.g., with Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Gd2O3, MgFe2O4, CoFe2O4, ZnFe2O4), dye-sensitised solar cells (e.g., with ZnO, TiO2), or high-power batteries (e.g., with V2O5, MnO, Mn2O3, Fe2O3, SnO2, CoMn2O4, CuFe2O4, LiFePO4, LiMnPO4) (Table 3).
Besides binary oxides, a huge number of ternary and multinary oxide phases (e.g., spinel and perovskite phases) have been obtained with precise stoichiometry. In this regard, the polyol synthesis of spinel phases and their highly relevant magnetic properties have been recently reviewed by Ammar and Fievet et al.125 Simon et al. could even demonstrate high-throughput screening for rapid identification of sensor materials.126 In comparison to polyol-made metal nanoparticles, interestingly, knowledge on precise shape control is lacking behind for polyol-made oxides. In this regard, the effect of the basic or acidic character of oxide surfaces on the coordination of the surface adhesion of the polyols and the resulting influence on the particle nucleation is highly relevant and will require many more efforts.127 Most often special active agents – in addition to the polyols – are required for precise shape control of oxide nanoparticles. Since the polyols are not causal for shape control in these cases, the interested reader is referred to recent reviews.128
The polyol synthesis of metal oxides can be restricted by the reducing properties of the polyols leading to the formation of elemental metals (cf. section 2). For selected systems, it is even possible to obtain elemental metals or metal oxides likewise, just by adjusting the reaction temperature. Generally, metal oxides can be obtained at lower temperatures (e.g., 100–180 °C) whereas elemental metals are obtained at higher temperatures (e.g., 180–250 °C). Prominent examples for such temperature-dependent product composition are, for instance, Cu+IIO/Cu+I2O/Cu0, Co+IIO/Co0 or Bi+III2O3/Bi0.78,129 The formation of either metals or metal oxides under comparable conditions to some extent also relates to the applied polyol. Often, EG and DEG – due to their chelating properties – turned out as most advantageous for preparing nanoscaled oxides, whereas EG and GLY are most suitable for preparing metal nanoparticles due to their strong reducing power.
3.1 Analytical characterization of polyol-functionalised particle surfaces
We have already mentioned the chelating properties of the polyols as a major asset in view of controlling particle size (cf. Introduction), particle growth and agglomeration. Although the chemical background may be intuitively plausible, a reliable analytical characterization of the surface conditioning of polyol-made nanoparticles would be desirable. Unfortunately, such analytical studies are rare by now, which might be related to the difficulty and complexity of such studies. Hence, analytical tools comprising high spatial resolution and high time resolution – most preferable both at the same time – would be needed to study the expected multi-shell surface systems (e.g., particle core, static and mobile solvent shells at the surface) of the as-prepared nanoparticles including possibly fast transport and diffusion between these shells.
Although the chelating effect of the polyols is most often discussed for colloidal stabilisation of nanoscaled metal oxides, for particular reasons, we first discuss polyol-made CaF2 nanoparticles as a well-suited system for detailed characterization.122b,130 Besides standard characterization including DLS, SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, and sorption analysis, namely, CaF2 is ideal for performing homo- and heteronuclear, multidimensional NMR experiments (i.e., 19F, 13C, 1H) under magic-angle spinning including 2D coupling spectra. In view of such powerful NMR characterisation, CaF2 nanoparticles with the 19F nuclei as an excellent probe are more convenient than oxide nanoparticles. NMR studies of polyol-made oxide nanoparticles, however, are also discussed in the following.
Standard characterization of CaF2 prepared in DEG shows non-agglomerated nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 20 nm as confirmed by DLS in the polyol suspension as well as by SEM and TEM for powder samples.122b,130 According to HRTEM and XRD, the CaF2 nanoparticles are single crystalline without any significant amorphous surface layer. Even after careful purification, FT-IR spectra indicate the presence of DEG – as it is expected for surface functionalization. Considering the thermal weight loss related to DEG (2.6%, obtained from thermogravimetry (TG)) and the specific surface area (78.6 m2 g−1, determined by nitrogen sorption analysis), the presence of a more-or-less monomolecular DEG layer on the surface of the CaF2 nanoparticles can be deduced.122b,130 Although surely a rough estimation, this nevertheless indicates that – in view of standard physicochemical characterization – the model of crystalline, 20 nm-sized CaF2 nanoparticles that are capped and colloidally stabilised by a monomolecular DEG layer is valid.
Advanced NMR techniques are ideal to elucidate the details since crystalline CaF2, amorphous CaF2, solvent layers including DEG as well as ethanol and water (stemming from washing procedure) can be reliably differentiated with high spatial resolution based on the peak positions, and especially, the coupling between 19F, 13C, and 1H.130 All resonances can be assigned to species such as CaF2, F−, DEG, EtOH, H2O, H3O+, or OH− with different populations as well as different neighbouring atoms and coordination spheres. Moreover, the crystalline particle core can be differentiated from static and mobile shells and the liquid solvent phase. And even the diameter of the crystalline CaF2 core and eventual amorphous shells at the particle surface can be obtained from advanced, heteronuclear 2D-pulse-sequence NMR experiments.130
To keep a long story and complex NMR studies short,130 we here only summarise the main results leading to a thorough model of a polyol-stabilised CaF2 nanoparticle as illustrated in Fig. 10. Thus, the polyol-made CaF2 nanoparticles are established by a crystalline CaF2 core that is covered, first, by a static interphase containing immobile DEG and water molecules as well as immobile F−, H3O+, OH−, and (to maintain charge neutrality) Ca2+ ions, and second, by a mobile surface layer composed of mobile ethanol and water molecules (Fig. 10). Moreover, the diameters were deduced to 15 nm for the crystalline CaF2 core, 1.6 nm for the interface layer, and <1.0 nm for the surface layer. Overall, NMR-based characterisation provides a detailed, in-depth view of the polyol-stabilised CaF2 nanoparticles that can be highly valuable for nanoparticles, in general.
 Fig. 10  Model of the DEG-functionalised CaF2 nanoparticles exhibiting a crystalline core (C), an interphase (I) and a surface layer (S) evolved by advanced NMR studies: the detected species (CaF2, F−, Ca2+, DEG, EtOH, H2O, H3O+, OH−) and their localization in the particle-layer structure are shown with their 1H and 19F-NMR assignments (modified from ref. 130). 
Similar detailed homo- and heteronuclear NMR studies were as well performed for polyol-made oxide nanoparticles such as Zn3(PO4)2131 or the transparent oxide conductors ZnO:Al and SnO2:F.124a,132 Again, profound knowledge regarding particle structure (including particle core and surface layer), local coordination and distances were gained. With regard to Zn3(PO4)2, NMR is even more powerful as the particle core turned out as fully amorphous. Based on NMR, the particle core could be nevertheless analyzed to consist of phase-pure zinc orthophosphate with an approximate chemical composition Zn3(PO4)2·0.3DEG·0.7H2O.131
In the case of doped metal oxide nanoparticles such as ZnO:Al or SnO2:F, NMR-based characterisation allows obtaining most relevant data regarding the local coordination of the Al3+ and F−-dopants including defect sites and concentration gradients between particle core and particle surface (Fig. 11).124a,132 For ZnO:Al prepared in DEG, for instance, Al3+ was found to have the expected sixfold coordination, but as well a fivefold and fourfold coordination near the particle surface. Moreover, Al-rich surface areas were identified with high doping levels.132 In the case of SnO2:F, NMR-based characterisation provide a detailed model regarding internal crystallite boundaries and the different concentration and diffusion of the F−-dopant inside the crystallites and along the crystallite boundaries (Fig. 11).124a Similar to CaF2, SnO2:F is ideal for detailed homo- and heteronuclear NMR studies since 19F, 119Sn, 13C, and 1H are available as probes. Here, 119Sn-Mößbauer spectroscopy as well as density functional theory (DFT) can provide further insights of the nanoparticle structure (Fig. 11).124a Such information can hardly be extracted from standard characterization but is obviously of enormous importance in terms of a fundamental understanding of the material composition (e.g., doping homogeneity, defect site models, and effect of heating under oxidative/reductive conditions) as well as in view of optimal properties (i.e., conductivity and transparency).

The F−-dopant ions can be localised on oxygen sites near the crystallite boundaries based on NMR-based characterisation and DFT calculations (modified from ref. 124a). 
3.2 Precise adjustment of crystallinity and phase composition
Adjusting the phase composition and crystallinity of nanomaterials – as already discussed (cf. Introduction) – is a major issue in view of optimal material properties.17,18 While the polyol synthesis of phase-pure and readily crystalline nanomaterials is often directly comparable for binary metal oxides, it becomes much more challenging for ternary and multinary systems. In this regard, the polyol synthesis of CuWO4 is here shown as a challenging example.133
The difficulty regarding the polyol synthesis of CuWO4 is to obtain a phase-pure and readily crystalline nanomaterial, and at the same time, to avoid side-phases such as Cu0, Cu2O, CuO or WO3. This is best illustrated by specific conditions. Thus, standard polyol synthesis in DEG with CuCl2·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O as the starting materials only yielded elemental copper, even at low temperatures (<100 °C) (Fig. 12a).133 In view of the high electrochemical potential of copper (E0(Cu2+/Cu0): +0.34 V)61 this finding comes not as a surprise. Therefore, CuCl2·2H2O was exchanged with Cu(NO3)2·5H2O based on the idea that the oxidative effect of nitrate may allow impeding the reduction and formation of Cu0. With this measure, however, Cu2O and CuO were obtained as side products at temperatures above 200 °C (Fig. 12b). In contrast, the hydrate CuWO4·2H2O was obtained below 200 °C (Fig. 12c).
 Fig. 12  Attempts at the polyol synthesis (in DEG) of phase pure and readily crystalline CuWO4 nanoparticles: (a) CuCl2·2H2O + Na2WO4·2H2O, T > 50 °C resulting in Cu0; (b) Cu(NO3)2·2H2O + Na2WO4·2H2O, T > 200 °C resulting in Cu2O/CuO; (c) Cu(NO3)2·2H2O + Na2WO4·2H2O, T < 200 °C resulting in CuWO4·2H2O; (d) Cu(NO3)2·2H2O + Na2WO4·2H2O, H3CCOOH/NaCH3COO buffer, T: 220 °C resulting in CuWO4 (references from the ICDD database; reproduction from ref. 133). 
As the formation of binary copper oxides is supported by alkaline conditions, a more acidic medium seemed promising. If the pH is too low, however, the formation of tungsten oxides WO3·H2O is favoured. In conclusion, a slightly acidic medium (pH 5.5) was adjusted by the addition of equal molar amounts of acetic acid and sodium acetate.133 With such an acetate-buffered system, the formation of all types of side products was successfully prevented, and the polyol synthesis indeed resulted in phase-pure and highly crystalline CuWO4 nanoparticles with a diameter of 12 nm (Fig. 12d).133 Basing on similar careful considerations and adjustment of the experimental conditions, far more transition-metal tungstates MWO4 (M: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) were realised as readily crystalline nanoparticles via the polyol synthesis (Fig. 13).133 All these nanomaterials exhibit particle sizes below 20 nm and high specific surface areas up to 200 m2 g−1.

3.3 Polyol synthesis and properties of MWO4 nanoparticles
The polyol synthesis is generally a versatile method for preparing ternary metal molybdates and metal tungstates that are readily crystalline after liquid-phase synthesis. Due to sufficient crystallinity the as-prepared metal tungstates can deploy their full potential regarding specific properties and eventual applications. Using alternative synthesis approaches, typically, two-step reactions are necessary including the precipitation of amorphous intermediates that were post-sintered afterwards for crystallization.133 This requires long sintering periods (2–10 h) at comparably mild temperatures (<200 °C) or short sintering periods (<2 h) at high temperatures (500–1000 °C). As metal tungstates represent a most versatile class of inorganic functional materials (including fluorescent materials, scintillators, catalysts, photocatalysts, magnetic materials, multiferroics and sensors),134 a one-pot, liquid-phase synthesis of crystalline tungstate nanomaterials may be highly interesting. For this reason, we add some illustrative examples.
CoWO4 and MnWO4, for instance, are well known as superparamagnetic compounds.135 Bulk MnWO4, moreover, shows unique multiferroic properties.136 Using the polyol synthesis, both materials can be prepared with diameters below 20 nm, and they show superparamagnetic behaviour right after liquid-phase synthesis (Fig. 14).133,137 Thus, the as-prepared CoWO4 and MnWO4 nanoparticles can be easily attracted and moved at ambient temperature by a permanent magnet, both in suspension or as dried powder (Fig. 14). Since the MnWO4 nanoparticles exhibit a complex magnetic behaviour at low temperature, the question regarding possible multiferroic properties cannot be answered by now.137 As no additional post-sintering of powder samples is necessary for crystallization, colloidally stable suspensions and non-agglomerated nanoparticles can be easily obtained.

Apart from magnetism, the polyol synthesis of compounds such as ZnWO4 or In2(MoO4)3:Eu can result in fluorescent nanoparticles (Fig. 9).122a,133 For example, ZnWO4 shows intrinsic fluorescence without additional co-doping.133,138 In2(MoO4)3, upon co-doping with Eu3+, exhibits characteristic line-type f → f transitions in the red spectral range (Fig. 9).139 For both compounds, the complex anions [WO4]2− or [MoO4]2− serve as fluorescence centres for efficient excitation.9 As discussed before (cf. Introduction), well-crystallised nanoparticles are essential for such an intense fluorescence since the emission of low-crystalline or even amorphous nanoparticles would be quenched due to non-radiative loss processes. Both ZnWO4 and In2(MoO4)3:Eu can be interesting for fluorescent thin film devices (i.e., illumination, displays, advertising, and signalling) as they can be excited with a low-cost near-UV LED (λmax: 360–380 nm).122a,133
Another highly interesting ternary metal tungstate that was obtained from polyols is the elusive phase β-SnWO4.140 Yellow β-SnWO4 is a direct semiconductor with a band gap of 2.7 eV that can be prepared with diameters of 10 nm and a specific surface of 70 m2 g−1. Due to its negative surface charge (i.e., zeta-potential of about −40 mV in a pH-range of 2–9), β-SnWO4 can be directly dispersed in water showing excellent colloidal stability. With these properties, β-SnWO4 turned out to be a very promising photocatalyst. Thus, β-SnWO4 nanoparticles can be used for the photochemical degradation of organic molecules, which has been exemplarily shown for dyes such as methylene blue, methylene orange, or disperse black.140b,141 In contrast to the most prominent photocatalyst anatase-TiO2,142 β-SnWO4 not only absorbs UV-light but – due to its smaller band gap – also absorbs blue light, so that it can be activated by daylight. In view of photocatalytic dye degradation, β-SnWO4 outperforms even the most intensely discussed daylight-activated photocatalysts BiVO4 and Ag3PO4.143
In addition to the degradation of organic molecules, β-SnWO4 nanoparticles turned out to be of interest in view of their phototoxic effect on tumour cells.144 Qualitative in vitro studies with nanoparticles transfected into human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) show a significant uptake of the nanoparticles at high viability as indicated by normal proliferation rates and mitochondria integrity (Fig. 15a). The cells do not show any phototoxic effect as long as they are kept in the dark. Upon excitation with daylight, however, the cancer cells undergo immediate apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 15b).144 Again the high zeta-potential and the high negative surface charge in water result in an excellent colloidal stability of β-SnWO4 even under physiological conditions. These findings were quantified by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays that confirm a high viability of SnWO4-transfected HepG2 cells in the dark (Fig. 15c). Upon artificial daylight illumination, a significant phototoxicity is validated. On long time-scales (>72 h), in turn, β-SnWO4 does not show a phototoxic effect due to slow dissolution under physiological conditions (Fig. 15c).144 Based on this portfolio of properties (i.e., colloidal stability, low systemic toxicity, high acute phototoxicity under daylight illumination, and absence of long-term phototoxicity), β-SnWO4 as a multifunctional nanomaterial may become highly interesting for water cleaning, disinfection, or photodynamic cancer therapy.145

3.4 Oxides with a specific shape and morphology
Apart from the synthesis of nanomaterials with a specific chemical composition, tailoring the shape and structure of nanoparticles receives significant attention nowadays.53,59,128 Here, fascinating morphologies have been realised that include almost all imaginable shapes. Efficient strategies have been developed to control and to manipulate nanostructures at an intriguing level of precision.53,59,128 This as well holds true for nanoscaled metals and metal oxides made via the polyol synthesis. In this regard, Tables 2 and 3 give an overview of the various shapes and structures that have been realised in recent years. Despite the versatile advantages of the polyol synthesis, however, it is to be noted that a precise control of shape and morphology often essentially requires specific agents – in addition to the polyol solvent – to block or to support the growth of certain particle surfaces and crystal facets. As the detailed strategies are beyond the scope of this review, the interested reader is referred to specific reviews for detailed information.128 In our group, two types of materials were addressed regarding specific shape generation via the polyol synthesis: (i) the photocatalyst β-SnWO4 with a spherical, cube-like, and spikecube-like shape;141,144,146 and (ii) porous ZnO platelets.147
β-SnWO4 nanoparticles have already been discussed as a highly active photocatalyst with regard to dye degradation and phototoxicity towards cancer cells (cf. section 3.3). Other than spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of 10 nm, additional shapes can be realised by controlled particle growth in DEG. The growth conditions are established by the variation of the temperature and the availability of water as a crystallizer (Fig. 16). In this regard, micron-sized cubes and dodecahedra with well-shaped {100} and {110} facets were obtained at 160 °C (Fig. 16).146 The formation of micron-sized cubes and dodecahedra can be directly understood based on the cubic crystal structure of β-SnWO4 and a slow and controlled crystal growth. In the case of the spikecubes, the cubes are still present but numerous individual spikes are grown on the {100} facets of the former cubes (Fig. 16). Thus, after a first process with nuclei growing to cubes, a second successive growth process starts from the cube-like surfaces serving as nucleation planes of the spikes. Such a two-step growth process resulting in a hierarchically multiarmed architecture is quite uncommon. In contrast to cube-like β-SnWO4, the formation of spikecubes is observed at 180 °C (Fig. 16).146 In view of this unique morphology, interesting photocatalytic properties might intuitively be expected, especially after a certain modification of the spikes with, e.g., Pd or Pt nanoparticles as co-catalysts. In a very first study of the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes, β-SnWO4 spikecubes outperform cube-like β-SnWO4 and commercial WO3 photocatalysts by 240 and 150%, respectively.
 Fig. 16  Polyol synthesis (in DEG) of β-SnWO4 with different sizes and shapes depending on the temperature of the reaction. 
Our second example relates to the well-known preparation of ZnO via polyol synthesis.120a,132 In contrast to many other polyols, the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles turned out to be not successful when conducted in GLY. In fact, neither nanoparticles nor ZnO was obtained. Instead, the synthesis resulted in micron-sized platelets of zinc glycerolate (Zn(gly)) (Fig. 17).147 This finding can be attributed to the high stability of the coordination complex of Zn2+ and deprotonated glycerol. Moreover, this coordination complex is insoluble in excess glycerol and precipitates therefore. On the other hand, the temperature of the liquid-phase synthesis is not high enough to thermally decompose Zn(gly) to ZnO. According to TG analysis, thermal decomposition of Zn(gly) occurred at a temperature as high as 500–600 °C.147 This seemingly disadvantageous result, however, can be used to obtain highly porous ZnO platelets if the thermal decomposition of the as-prepared Zn(gly) platelets is conducted slowly. With this measure, ZnO platelets with adjustable specific surface area (5–20 m2 g−1) and pore volume (25–250 mm3 g−1) were obtained (Fig. 17).147 Similar to the above β-SnWO4 spikecubes, such porous ZnO platelets can be very interesting for catalysis.

4. Polyol synthesis of nanoscaled metal chalcogenides and non-metal main-group-elements
In addition to oxide nanoparticles, the polyol synthesis has been widely used for preparing nanoscaled chalcogenides. Here, metal sulphides have been addressed most often. Typically, thiourea, H2S, or soluble metal sulphides (e.g. Na2S) are used as sulphide precursors. The polyol synthesis of metal chalcogenides has been triggered in recent years by specific properties and applications, including solar cells (e.g., CuInSe2, Cu2ZnSnS4), photodetectors (e.g., In2S3, SnS), photocatalysts (e.g. ZnIn2S4), thermoelectrics (e.g. Bi2Te3), or lithium-ion batteries (e.g. Sb2S3). An overview of recent papers on polyol-made metal chalcogenides is given in Table 4.

Although well-suited for nanoscaled metal chalcogenides, knowledge and number of these compounds are generally much more limited as compared to the polyol synthesis of nanoscaled metals or metal oxides. As many aspects regarding their particle size, agglomeration, particle shape and morphology, or material crystallinity are similar to metal oxides, we will not discuss chalcogenide nanoparticles in detail, but focus on less familiar strategies to obtain elemental selenium and tellurium with the polyol synthesis. Moreover, we discuss the option to prepare carbon dots (C-dots) via polyol synthesis.
4.1 Selenium and tellurium core@shell structures
Other than metal chalcogenides, elemental chalcogen nanoparticles can be of interest. As for a practical background, selenium is highly relevant as a precursor to CIS or CIGS thin film solar cells.67 Conventionally, light-absorbing CIS/CIGS layers are deposited via high-vacuum techniques and/or thermal co-evaporation of the relevant elements. In view of vacuum-free deposition and low-cost production, printing processes are intensely discussed.67 Vacuum techniques and gas-phase deposition could be avoided completely by using metals (Cu0, In0, Cu11In9) and Se0 nanoparticles as precursors for layer deposition. Slight activation (e.g. heating) of such reactive heterogeneous particle layers thereafter can lead to the formation of homogeneous, compact CIS thin films. However, colloidally stable Se nanoparticles are a kind of missing link – and a nice challenge for polyol synthesis.
The synthesis of colloidally stable Se0 nanoparticles is hampered by the room-temperature phase transition of red, amorphous selenium (a-Se) to grey, trigonal selenium (t-Se). This phase transition is observed at 31 °C for bulk Se,161 and – due to the huge surface area – occurs at an even lower temperature for Se0 nanoparticles.162 Due to this phase transition, Se0 nanoparticles show rapid agglomeration and merging under re-crystallization to micron-sized crystal needles (Fig. 18). Such large needles are naturally neither stable as colloidal suspensions nor suitable for printing processes.
 Fig. 18  Scheme showing the re-crystallization and stabilisation of a-Se: (a) merging of a-Se and re-crystallization as needle-type t-Se; (b) colloidal and phase stabilisation of a-Se via Se@CuSe core@shell structure (modified from ref. 164). 
To tackle the phase-transition problem and to obtain colloidally stable, spherical Se0 nanoparticles, first of all, the well-known hydrazine-driven reduction of selenious acid162e,163 was performed in DEG (Fig. 18). In accordance with Ostwald's step rule, spherical particles of red a-Se were obtained that – as discussed above – show phase transition to the thermodynamically more stable grey t-Se phase under rapid merging and formation of micron-sized crystal needles (Fig. 18a). To obtain colloidally stable suspensions of spherical a-Se, Se@CuSe core@shell nanoparticles were realised (Fig. 18b).164 Aiming at Se0 nanoparticles, the CuSe shell for stabilisation can be an undesirable impurity, which, however, is not a restriction in view of CIS/CIGS thin film solar cells.164 After the hydrazine-driven reduction, excess hydrazine essentially needs to be removed via vacuum distillation prior to the addition of Cu(CH3COO)2 for shell formation, since Cu2+ is otherwise reduced to Cu0. Then, the CuSe shell can be grown via one-pot polyol synthesis upon the addition of CuCl2·2H2O and reaction with selenium at the particle surface.
The resulting Se@CuSe nanoparticle suspensions are highly stable and do not show any phase transition. The particle size can be varied via the N2H4:H2SeO3 ratio and the reaction time, resulting in diameters of 80–400 nm.164 The Se@CuSe core@shell structure was validated via XRD, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) line-scans (Fig. 19a and b). The EDXS data fit with an inner core of Se0 having a diameter of about 340 nm, and a CuSe capping having a thickness of about 20 nm (Fig. 19b). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), finally, shows that the phase transition a-Se → t-Se is now indeed shifted to 107 °C (Fig. 19c), which is about 80 °C higher than the phase-transition temperature of bulk Se (31 °C).161 Furthermore, melting of Se0 is observed at 217 °C. The increased phase-transition temperature and the improved colloidal stability of the Se@CuSe core@shell nanoparticles, in sum, can be ascribed to the CuSe shell serving as a protecting layer.164 For Se0 nanoparticles, the increased phase and colloidal stability gives the opportunity to use the Se0 nanoparticles for all kinds of printing and thin film techniques.162e,165
 Fig. 19  Phase and colloidal stabilisation of a-Se via Se@CuSe core@shell structure: (a) concentration profile obtained from EDXS line-scan; (b) HAADF-STEM image (EDXS line-scan along the red line); (c) DSC and TG of Se@CuSe core@shell nanoparticles (onset of phase transition a-Se → t-Se at 107 °C; onset of melting point at 217 °C; modified from ref. 164). 
Similar to Se@CuSe core@shell nanoparticles, the strategy of stabilising the size and shape of chalcogen nanoparticles was also successfully applied to tellurium nanorods.166 Nanosized Te0 shows rapid merging and agglomeration, too.167 In contrast to Se0, the reason for the low-temperature agglomeration and merging of Te0 is not a phase transition, but the low melting temperature of the element (Tmelting bulk Te: 449.5 °C). Similar to the most prominent example of nanosized gold (i.e., whereas the melting point of bulk Au0 is 1064 °C, 4 nm-sized Au0 melts at about 500 °C),168 the melting point of nanosized Te0 can be dramatically reduced, too. Thus, it is a more general challenge to obtain colloidally stable nanoparticles and meanwhile to avoid agglomeration and merging, especially in the case of metals and main-group elements with relatively low melting points (i.e. <500 °C). Again, we used a core@shell structure to stabilise Te0, specifically via a Te@Bi2Te3 nanorod heterostructure. Just as for Se0, a hydrazine-driven reduction of telluric acid was performed in DEG to obtain Te0.166 Thereafter, a thin capping of Bi2Te3 was established by the addition of Bi(C6H5)3. Whereas the as-prepared Te0 without the capping layer shows rapid agglomeration and merging during storage and/or after gentle heating, the Te@Bi2Te3 core@shell nanorods are highly stable.
The composition of the Te@Bi2Te3 heterostructure was validated by electron microscopy (STEM, HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, SAED), and EDXS and XRD line-scans.166 Thus, the Te@Bi2Te3 core@shell nanorods have a length of 54 nm and a diameter of 19 nm (Fig. 20). The central region with a length of 29 nm and a diameter of 7 nm represents single crystalline Te0, as indicated by the observed lattice fringes of 3.9 and 3.2 Å (bulk Te: d(100) with 3.88 Å; d(101) with 3.23 Å).169 In addition, HAADF-STEM images combined with high-resolution EDXS line-scans confirm the Te and Bi concentration gradients, which could be modelled with an inner core of pure tellurium (about 13 nm in diameter) and a shell of Bi2Te3 (about 6 nm in thickness).166 Such Te@Bi2Te3 core@shell nanostructures with high colloidal and shape stability may be of potential interest in thin film solar cells, thermoelectrics or topological insulators. Similar to Se@CuSe, the Bi2Te3 capping is not necessarily an impurity, for instance, in view of application-related compounds such as Bi2Te3, (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3, PbBi2Te4, Pb(Bi1−xSbx)2Te4 or multi-segmented Bi2Te3–Te heterostructures.170

4.2 Carbon dots (C-dots)
Even with our long-standing experience regarding the polyol synthesis of nanoparticles,78,121–124 we nevertheless could not explain a certain observation for quite some time. Namely, this is a relatively intense emission of blue light that was frequently observed for polyol-made nanoparticles. As an example, this observation is here discussed in short for Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles.171 Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles were prepared by injecting a solution of (NH4)(H2PO4) in H2O into a solution of ZnCl2 in DEG at 50 °C, followed by subsequent heating (45 min, 230 °C). The as-prepared Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles have a diameter of 20 nm with a narrow size distribution (Fig. 21a–c).131 The nanoparticles are non-crystalline, but chemical composition and phase purity are reliably confirmed via independent analytical tools such as FT-IR, EDXS, elemental analysis, as well as homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (i.e., 1H, 13C, and 31P).131 Despite being non-crystalline, the as-prepared Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles show intense blue emission upon UV-excitation with quantum yields up to 25% (Fig. 21c and d).
 Fig. 21  “Unexpected” fluorescence of polyol-made Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles: (a) SEM image; (b) HRTEM image; (c) excitation and emission spectra; (d) photo showing intense blue emission upon UV-excitation (modified from ref. 171). 
The essential question is: what is the origin of fluorescence of these Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles? They are non-crystalline, and thus, contain numerous defects. There is no specific fluorescence center and doping. The band-gap (4.5–5.0 eV) and the particle size (20 nm) are too large for quantum-confinement effects in the visible spectral range. Defect-based fluorescence typically does not lead to intense emission and comparably high quantum yields (20–25%) at room temperature. Finally, OH-containing solvents – such as the polyols – normally cause complete quenching of the fluorescence at room temperature due to vibronic relaxation via O−H stretching vibrations.9
As such an “unexpected” fluorescence occurs not only for Zn3(PO4)2, but also for other polyol-made nanoparticles, we, first of all, checked the literature for similar observations and possible explanations. Indeed, we could identify a significant number of publications that describe nanoparticles with very similar excitation/emission characteristics to those observed for the above discussed Zn3(PO4)2 nanoparticles.172–174 The respective nanoparticles were either prepared in polyols or surface-functionalised with polyols (most often PEG) and heated to temperatures >150 °C (including microwave heating and sonication). Again, the fluorescence is unexpected as: (i) the particle diameter significantly exceeds the typical size regime of quantum-size effects (i.e. diameter >50 nm);172 (ii) the nanomaterials do not exhibit specific doping or plasmon-resonances;173 (iii) the compounds exhibit wide band gaps (>5.0 eV, such as for MgO, ZnO, B2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2) so that quantum-confinement effects are not expected in the visible.174 In many cases, the origin of the fluorescence was nevertheless attributed to quantum-size effects or defect processes.
Taking our experimental results and the literature reports together, heating of nanoparticles in the presence of polyols and the “unexpected” blue fluorescence seem to relate to a more general effect. This motivated us to critically examine the experimental conditions of the polyol synthesis. As a result, we could clearly show that the “unexpected” fluorescence is independent from certain nanoparticles or the presence of certain metal cations (Fig. 22a–c). It is also independent from certain types of polyols (Fig. 22d).171 Thus, heating of ZnCl2·4H2O, MgCl2·6H2O or KCl dissolved in DEG, GLY or PEG400 to temperatures higher than 150 °C always resulted in more-or-less similar fluorescence characteristics (Fig. 22). As a consequence, it has to be concluded that the observed fluorescence intrinsically relates to the heating of polyols.171
 Fig. 22  Emission spectra and photos of DEG, GLY, and PEG400 after heating (230 °C, 1 h): (a) with dissolved ZnCl2; (b) with dissolved MgCl2·6H2O; (c) with dissolved KCl; (d) pure polyols (all salts with 0.5 mmol; λexcitation: 366 nm) (reproduction from ref. 171). 
It is well-known that the polyols start to decompose at elevated temperatures (e.g., thermal dehydration and polymerization). The faster the decomposition, the higher the temperature and the longer the heating that is applied.171 Oxidizing agents and/or strong acids and bases can further boost the thermal decomposition. The polyol decomposition can be followed with the naked eye and is indicated by a colour change from the colourless pure polyol via yellow to brownish, and finally, deep black. This thermal decomposition needs to be avoided for the polyol synthesis of nanoparticles. As the thermal decomposition proceeds rapidly near the boiling point, the temperature should typically be limited to about 50 °C below the boiling point of the polyol. The thermal decomposition of the polyols, on the other hand, is essential to observe the blue fluorescence (Fig. 22). Thus, almost no fluorescence occurs after heating to temperatures <150 °C. Intense blue fluorescence, in contrast, is observed at temperatures up to 230 °C. At even higher temperatures, the polyol decomposition becomes very fast and less controllable leading to reduced emission intensities.171
As the observed fluorescence originates from the thermal decomposition of the polyols under the formation of dehydrogenised and polymeric species, a comparison with the recently emerging carbon dots (C-dots) is inescapable. Most often, C-dots have been prepared by high temperature treatment of almost all conventional carbon sources (including coal, graphite, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, soot, etc.).175 Thereafter, the C-dots need to be separated by solvent extraction. Moreover, a certain surface passivation is needed and often achieved by heating in the presence of PEG derivatives.176 Under these conditions, C-dots show intense blue to green fluorescence with quantum yields up to 80%. As an alternative, the synthesis of C-dots can be performed via thermal decomposition of molecular precursors such as carbohydrates, polymers or amino acids.175 Moreover, more curious precursors such as leaves, eggs or orange juice have been thermally treated and extracted to obtain C-dots.175,177
Since polyols and carbohydrates are chemically related, the formation of C-dots due to thermal decomposition of polyols seemed obvious. Indeed, we could prove the formation of C-dots via TEM, HRTEM, XRD, FT-IR, and fluorescence spectroscopy.171 The as-prepared C-dots exhibit diameters of 3–5 nm at a narrow size distribution (Fig. 23a). They are highly crystalline as indicated by lattice distances of 2.05 Å (bulk graphite: d(101) with 2.03 Å) (Fig. 23b and c). Due to instantaneous surface functionalization with the polyol, the C-dots exhibit excellent colloidal stability and can be directly dispersed in water (Fig. 23d). Apart from thermal treatment, nucleation and growth of the C-dots can be assisted by the addition of oxophilic and Lewis-acidic metal salts such as ZnCl2 or MgCl2.171
 Fig. 23  Polyol-made C-dots: (a) overview TEM image; (b) HRTEM image with lattice fringes; (c) Fourier-transformed HRTEM image of C-dot in the [212] zone-axis orientation; (d) size distribution after dispersion in H2O (modified from ref. 179). 
In view of their properties and future application, C-dots have already attracted much attention owing to their intense fluorescence that could be highly relevant to bioimaging and optoelectronics.175 Due to their high physicochemical stability and their low toxicity, C-dots may replace the widely used semiconductor-type quantum dots (Q-dots).175,178 Whereas C-dots with efficient blue and green emission have already been described, efficient red emission is a missing link. In fact, narrow-band red emission is most essential for full-colour emission and additive colour mixing to white light (e.g., for displays and all kinds of light sources).175 Moreover, red or infrared emission is highly important for biomedical applications in view of the autofluorescence of tissues and optimal deep-tissue penetration.175
Based on the observation that oxophilic, Lewis-acidic metal salts such as MgCl2·6H2O assist the nucleation and growth of C-dots during thermal decomposition of polyols, we intended to achieve a similar effect with TbCl3/EuCl3 (Fig. 24). Eventually, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the C-dot to Tb3+/Eu3+ could result in line-type f → f transitions of the lanthanides. Indeed, Tb3+/Eu3+-modified C-dots show the characteristic, intense f → f transitions with excellent quantum yields of 85% for Tb3+ and 75% for Eu3+ (Fig. 24).179 This is even more surprising as the parity-forbidden f → f-transitions are typically quenched in OH-containing solvents due to relaxation via O−H vibrations.9 Altogether, polyol synthesis turned out to be a versatile strategy for preparing full-colour emitting C-dots (Fig. 24). Such a polyol synthesis of C-dots currently receives increasing attention.180

5. Conclusions and perspectives
After about 25 years the polyol synthesis has definitely become a versatile synthesis strategy that belongs to the standard repertoire for preparing high-quality nanomaterials. EG, DEG, GLY, and BD are generally the most widely applied polyol solvents. Nowadays, a variety of nanomaterials, including elemental metals, metal oxides, and metal chalcogenides, are accessible via the polyol synthesis with diameters ranging from 1 nm up to several microns. Especially, the water-comparable and chelating properties of the polyols are highly advantageous, allowing the use of simple metal salts as precursors and an instantaneous surface functionalization and colloidal stabilisation of the nanoparticles directly after nucleation. As a result, nanoparticles with uniform size distribution and low degree of agglomeration even at high weight concentrations can be obtained. Aiming at metal nanoparticles, moreover, the reductive features of the polyols are an additional asset that allows a direct reduction upon heating of metal salts in the polyol medium.
Due to the high boiling point of polyols, often crystalline nanomaterials can be directly obtained from liquid-phase synthesis. This is another asset in view of optimal material properties and functions. Owing to all the different advantages, polyol synthesis is widely used to obtain nanomaterials with almost all imaginable properties and a variety of applications. These include catalysis, photocatalysis, sensing, magnetism, solar cells, high-power batteries, thin film electronics, fluorescence marking, transparent oxide conductors, colour pigments, optical imaging, drug delivery, and many more. Often, polyol synthesis is motivated by specific material properties and needs of the application. Since polyols are comparably cheap and green solvents, polyol synthesis has many advantages for up-scaling and industrial use.
The polyol synthesis allows preparing multinary compositions, including doping and complex heterostructures. Apart from precise control of materials’ composition and particle size, the polyol synthesis is widely applied for obtaining nanomaterials with specific shapes, again including almost all imaginable polyhedra and morphologies. Polyols, especially PEG derivatives, are also known for high biocompatibility allowing for optimal cell uptake of polyol-functionalised nanoparticles. For achieving both precise shape control of nanoparticles and cell uptake of nanoparticles, however, further surface-active agents are normally needed.
In the last 10 years, our group could also contribute to advancing the polyol synthesis with regard to the synthesis of less-noble metals (including citrate functionalization, phase transfer separation, and photochemical reduction), the NMR-based characterisation of polyol-functionalised nanoparticles, the realisation of phase-pure, readily crystalline metal tungstates, the colloidal stabilisation of low-melting elements, and the controlled thermal decomposition of polyols to lanthanide-modified C-dots. In spite of all these advances, however, there are also clear limitations of polyol synthesis. On the one hand, the formation of less-noble metals is restricted by re-oxidation due to the protic polyol. On the other hand, rapid thermal decomposition near the boiling point limits the accessible temperature range of reactions.
In this perspective, modern analytical tools with high spatial and time resolution as well as state-of-the-art theoretical approaches will generate highly valuable data for a fundamental understanding as well as for practical handling of the polyol synthesis. Moreover, a much better quantification, for instance, of the reduction potential and the chelating properties will become possible based on the already available data allowing for precise adjustment of composition, size and shape. Thus, even a prediction of the most suitable polyol for a certain reaction, chemical composition and/or material properties may become possible. The number of high-quality nanomaterials being accessible via the polyol synthesis will further increase anyway.

Notes and references
Remark: The term PEG is used for molecules H[OCH2CH2]nOH up to a molecular weight of <100000. Molecules with a higher molecular weight are designated polyethylene oxides (PEO). For PEO the content of OH-groups relative to the ether groups becomes very low, so that the alcohol-like properties vanish.
