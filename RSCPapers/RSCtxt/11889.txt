The so-called all-weather solar cell yields a maximum efficiency of 28.7% in the dark, making a promising photovoltaic revolutionary for state-of-the-art photovoltaics.
Photovoltaics are photoelectric devices that can convert solar energy into electricity upon sunlight illumination,1–6 arising from photon absorption by light absorbers for electron generation.7,8 However, the average total illumination time is around 3000 hours in China, occupying 34.2% of the total time every year. In other words, state-of-the art solar cells can realize high-efficiency photoelectric conversion for 34.2% of the time, while the power conversion efficiencies are relatively low or even zero for 65.8% of the total time.
To address this profound issue, we have previously developed all-weather solar cells that can harvest energy beyond sunny days.9–12 Recently, a new photovoltaic system that can harvest power from the sun and rain has been built by careful interfacial engineering design. A reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film is combined with a flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) by a hot-press technique,9 yielding a photo efficiency of 6.53% under air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) as well as a voltage of hundreds of microvolts and current over microamps by simulated raindrops. A potential mechanism behind electricity output in rainy days is the formation of the electron/cation pseudocapacitor at the rGO/rain interface and charging/discharging cycles during expansion/shrinkage processes of rain droplets at the rGO surface.9,13 Notably, the strategy is not applicable to high-efficiency all-weather DSSCs fabricated on fragile conductive glass. Subsequently, graphene10 and graphene tailored conducting films11 are electrophoretically deposited and coated to finish the photovoltaic assembly, respectively. A maximum solar cell efficiency of 9.8% in sunny days and markedly increased voltage and current signals under rainy conditions are obtained. According to the same theory, all-weather solar cells tailored by platinum alloy electrodes are also fabricated because of electron deviation from the transition metal to platinum,12 resulting in an electron-enriched surface. Although the as-developed solar cells have realized power generation in sunny and rainy weathers, they are not available in foggy, night etc. other dark-light conditions.
In the current work, we would like to develop an all-weather solar cell that can yield electricity in sunny and dark weathers by incorporating green-emitting long persistent phosphors (LPP) with a mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) photoanode. The unabsorbed visible light and infrared light can be stored into LPP phosphors and converted into monochromatic green light, which is further absorbed by organic dyes in the dark to generate electricity according to the photoelectric principle.14 Moreover, a three-dimensional (3D) polymer gel electrolyte (PGE) with an electron-conducting feature is utilized to reserve the I−/I3− redox electrolyte into a 3D PGE framework, to reduce the I3− species within the PGE system and to shorten the diffusion length of redox couples.15,16 The experimental details for building photoanodes, PGEs and solar cells have been demonstrated in the ESI.† The final all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSC can yield a dark-efficiency of 28.7%.
A great challenge for state-of-the-art solar cells is to realize persistent electricity generation in the daytime and in the dark. To address this profound problem, we have fabricated a luminescent m-TiO2/LPP photoanode by coating green-emitting LPP phosphors onto the m-TiO2 film, and combined with graphene tailored PGEs and a Pt counter electrode for building all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSCs, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Upon illumination by sunlight, all the incident light at λ < 550 nm is completely absorbed by the N719 dye because of zero transmission (Fig. 2). However, there is increased light loss at λ > 550 nm and the maximum optical transmission is 58% at 1000 nm, suggesting that partial visible light and all near-infrared light are not well-absorbed by the traditional DSSC device. This result can be supported by the optical absorption spectrum of LPP phosphors, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S2a. Surprisingly, green-emitting LPP phosphors can absorb all visible light and almost all near-infrared light and emit green fluorescence (ESI,† Fig. S2b).17 As shown in the inset image of Fig. 2, the inner dark region is the N719-TiO2/LPP photoanode, while the outer green region is the LPP film. This image suggests that all the green fluorescence has been reabsorbed by N719 for dye excitation, allowing for persistent electricity output in the dark.

Fig. 3a shows the J–V curve for an all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSC under AM 1.5 irradiation, yielding an η of 9.3% (Jsc = 17.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.745 V, and FF = 69.7%) according to the solar cell architecture in Fig. 1a in comparison with 9.1% for an optimal graphene tailored PGE based DSSC with no LPP phosphors. The slight improvement in cell performances is attributed to fluorescence irradiation. Notably, the green fluorescence can last for several hours upon ceasing solar irradiation;18 therefore, the resultant solar cell presents an ability to generate power in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3b, the J–V curve for the traditional DSSC passes through the origin of the coordinate, suggesting a zero power output. However, the Jsc is 272 μA cm−2 and the Voc is 0.335 V at a fluorescence intensity of 162 μW cm−2, yielding a dark η of 28.7% for an all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSC according to η = Pmax/Pin, where Pin is the fluorescence intensity of the m-TiO2/LPP anode. In fact, the photofluorescence for the employed LPP phosphors can last for six hours; therefore, the resultant all-weather solar cells can also persistently generate electricity in the dark for several hours. Due to the limited accuracy of our equipment, the readable J–V curves within the first two hours can be recorded under our conditions.

The IPCE curve shown in Fig. 3c can be used to interpret the potential mechanism behind such a high dark efficiency. The maximum IPCE value is 85.7% in the monochromatic green-light region because of high absorption of N719 dyes. Therefore, this result also offers a strategy to significantly enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency by converting full-spectral sunlight into monochromatic light.19
Apart from the persistent electricity output both in the daytime and in the dark, the all-weather solar cells also feature a fast start-up, repeated start capability, and operation stability. The on–off switches of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs with and without LPP phosphors are measured, as shown in Fig. 4a. The on–off switches of the resultant solar cells can be persistently measured for several hours, but here we only provide the characteristics within the first 200 s. The photocurrents are approximately 17.5 mA cm−2 and the dark currents are zero for the traditional quasi-solid-state DSSC device,20,21 while the photocurrent is increased to 17.8 mA cm−2 and the dark current is determined to be 280 μA cm−2 (Fig. 4b) for an all-weather solar cell. This result is in agreement with J–V curves recorded in the dark. Upon persistent illumination using simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) for 50 h, there are no reductions in these two solar cells (Fig. 4c). This result demonstrates that the incorporation of green-emitting LPP phosphors into the m-TiO2 film does not damage the stability of the final quasi-solid-state DSSC. Fig. 4d shows the current stability of an all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSC over 5 h in the dark. In the initial stage, the current reduces from around 280 to 260 μA cm−2 and subsequently remains at 250 μA cm−2 for several hours because the green-emitting LPPs can last for several hours (ESI,† Fig. S3). The relatively good long-term stability in the daytime and in the dark for the so-called all-weather quasi-solid-state solar cell makes it promising for future applications.

In summary, here we demonstrate the fabrication of an all-weather quasi-solid-state DSSC by sandwiching a conducting PGE with a m-TiO2/LPP photoanode and a platinum counter electrode. Due to light storage and the emission ability of LPP phosphors, the unabsorbed visible-light and infrared light are converted into green fluorescence for dye excitation in the dark. Due to the superior catalytic ability and shortened charge transfer of the conducting PGE, the final all-weather solar cell yields a photo efficiency of 9.10% and a dark efficiency of 28.7%. This work is significant in either increasing the DSSC efficiency and stability or realizing persistent electricity output in all weathers.
