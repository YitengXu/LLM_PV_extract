    , Accepted 29th January 2020First published on 30th January 2020AbstractAdvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have attracted special attention owing to the high removal efficiency of recalcitrant organic contaminants. Recently, the use of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or LDH composites as catalysts for AOPs (photocatalysis, Fenton reaction methods, and sulfate radical (SO4˙−)-mediated oxidations) has received increasing attention and has become a new research hotspot. This is due to their layered structure, flexible tunability, electronic properties, and high physicochemical stability. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on the development and progress in the synthesis of pristine LDH and modified LDH catalysts for AOPs. Special attention has been paid to the design strategies of high-performance LDHs, including (1) rational design of pristine LDHs, such as binary and ternary LDHs, (2) calcination of LDHs at an appropriate temperature, (3) modification of LDHs with a semiconductor or metal as a cocatalyst, (4) changing the compensating anions, and (5) controlling the LDH morphology. Finally, some valuable perspectives on the challenges and future research directions in LDH-based AOPs are discussed.Zhong-zhu YangZhongzhu Yang received his Bachelor's degree in environmental engineering from Hunan University of Science and Technology.

1. Introduction
With the rapid growth of industrialization and urbanization, water pollution caused by the uninterrupted release of toxic substances into water has become an overwhelming concern worldwide.1–3 A variety of organic contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, agrochemicals, and organic dyes, widely exist in water bodies, and are the major threats to the environment and humans. Various treatments have been developed for the remediation of polluted water, such as adsorption,4 flocculation,5 biological methods,6 precipitation,7 and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).8,9 Based on the principal mechanism behind the removal of organic pollutants, these processes can be divided into two broad categories: separative (physical and physicochemical) methods, and degradative (chemical and biological) methods.10 Physicochemical methods usually exhibit low pollutant removal rates, owing to the pollutant's sludge formation, while the biodegradation techniques are interesting approaches from a sustainable point of view, but impeded by the recalcitrant nature of wastewaters containing antibiotic residues. Oxidation with chlorine gas or hypochlorite is a conventional and effective procedure for disinfection and pollutant degradation, but it may produce some other kinds of potential toxic secondary pollutants.11 These drawbacks motivated the search for alternative treatments. Over the past few decades, an increasing number of investigations have been conducted to study the treatment of organic contaminants by AOPs in various aqueous matrices.12,13 AOPs consist of a wide group of technologies that have been used successfully for wastewater treatment over the past few years and involve ozonation, Fenton reaction methods, sulfate radical oxidations, photocatalysis, electrochemical oxidation, and ultrasound irradiation (Fig. 1).14–16 They can be broadly defined as oxidation methods based on the use of highly reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH˙), and sulfate radicals (SO4˙−), which provide pathways for the degradation of the target compounds into harmless mineralized salts, CO2 and H2O.16,17 Since AOPs have the advantages of fast reaction rates and non-selective oxidation, they can degrade multiple contaminants at the same time. Furthermore, they offer different possible pathways for the production of OH˙ and other radicals, resulting in better compliance with the specific treatment requirements. Taking the significance and challenges of AOPs into consideration, designing AOP catalysts is very crucial to stimulating and facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species. Among the various catalysts, metal–organic frameworks and graphene-based materials have exhibited, to some extent, excellent performances towards different contaminants present in wastewater. However, these materials may affect our environment and health negatively.10,18–20 We have made a detailed comparison of some important properties/performances between raw LDHs and other raw materials as AOP catalysts in Table 1. In this context, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been revealed very recently to be extremely powerful functional materials employed in technologies to clean contaminated waters.

Table 1 A comparison of some important properties/performances between raw LDHs and raw Fe-MOFs and perovskites as AOP catalysts




Catalysts
Observations from AOPs




LDHs
(1) The composition, particle size, morphology, and surface defect structure, as well as the electronic properties of LDHs can be modulated by various synthetic strategies and exfoliation approaches, affording coordinatively unsaturated active sites (e.g., low-coordinated steps, edges, and/or corner atoms) which facilitate heterogeneous catalysis21,22


(2) Strong electrostatic interactions between layers and interlayer anions to offer an ordered arrangement of interlayer species and a tailorable orientation of active sites as well as the increase of structural stability23


(3) It remains challenging to overcome the poor conductivity, low electron and charge transfer ability and insufficient active edge sites, especially for the bulk form of LDHs23,24


MOFs
(1) MOFs with large surface area, ultrahigh porosity, and diversity of material design have been extensively used in heterogeneous catalysts25


(2) MOFs have some relatively inferior features in terms of stability, aggregation, consequent loss of dispersibility and iron leaching in the catalytic reaction11,26


(3) Efficiency of most MOFs is low due to their ability to conduct the reactions under UV irradiation11,27


(4) The organic linkers may potentially block the coordination sphere around the reactive metal sites, which is not beneficial to chemisorption of pollutants and the subsequent catalytic decomposition11


Perovskites
(1) Perovskites are highly stable and exhibit a high mobility of network oxygen with the possibility of forming vacancies and stabilizing unusual oxidation states of metals28,29


(2) The conductivity and surface area of perovskites are low and as a consequence, the interaction between the contaminants and the active sites is limited29,30


(3) The high combination rate of electron/hole pairs and the agglomeration of particles are some of the limitations of perovskites29


(4) The removal of pollutants in perovskite/PMS systems is very efficient, while the mineralization is somewhat less efficient29,31,32




Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) or hydrotalcite-like compounds are a large family of two-dimensional (2D) anionic clay materials which can be represented by the general formula [M1−x2+ Mx3+ (OH)2(An−)x/n]x+·mH2O.33,34 As shown in Fig. 2(b), LDHs are composed of brucite-like layers in which a fraction of the divalent metal cations (e.g., Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cu2+) coordinated octahedrally by hydroxyl groups have been replaced isomorphously by the trivalent metal cations (e.g., Al3+, Fe3+, Ga3+) giving positively charged layers.35,36 The value of x, generally ranging from 0.20 to 0.33, denotes the molar fraction of M2+ in the metallic ions. An− is the interlayer gallery anion (e.g., CO32−, Cl−, NO3−, SO42−).37–39 LDHs have been proved to be promising platforms for a wide range of applications, especially in the fields of energy and environment.40–50 This has been obviously reflected in the tremendous advances made in aspects such as the adsorption and reduction of CO2,51–55 the reduction of NOx,56–58 the adsorption of pollutants in water,59–62 anion exchangers,63–65 the photodegradation of organic matter,66,67 electrochemical oxidation,68,69 sonocatalytic degradation,70,71 and the catalytic ozonation process.72,73 As shown in Fig. 2(c), regarding the application of AOPs for the removal of organic pollutants using LDH-based materials, heterogeneous photocatalysis, Fenton processes and sulfate radical oxidations are the top three most frequently used treatments. This is, to a certain extent, a direct consequence of four unique features: (i) the wide tunability of the types of metal cations, the M2+/M3+ molar ratios, (ii) the nature of interlayer compensating anions, (iii) the reconstruction of the LDH via the “memory effect” and (iv) the exfoliation of the bulky LDH solid into functional ultrathin nanosheets.74 These features have endowed LDH based materials with a huge variety of host–guest assemblies and nanoarchitectures with versatile physical and chemical properties.

Some excellent reviews have recently been published on the application of LDH-based materials for the remediation of wastewater by AOPs. Navalon et al.76 published “Heterogeneous Fenton catalysts based on clays, silicas and zeolites” in 2010. The main part of this review was focused on presenting the results reported up to late 2009 using layered and porous aluminosilicates as heterogeneous catalysts. In 2014, Shahidi et al.77 published “Advances in catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants – Prospects for thorough mineralization by natural clay catalysts”, which was focused on the topic of catalytic ozonation based AOPs. Mohapatra et al.78 published the extensive “A review on the recent progress, challenges and perspective of layered double hydroxides as promising photocatalysts” covering 164 references (before 2016), which fully reviewed the application of LDH-based materials for degradation of pollutants, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 photoreduction. Yang et al.79 published “Utilization of LDH-based materials as potential adsorbents and photocatalysts for the decontamination of dyes wastewater: a review” in 2016, which addressed the complexity of the many factors that influence the adsorption and photodegradation process of dyes. A review by Wu, in 2018, described the advances that have been made in fabricating heterostructures from LDHs for enhanced photocatalytic activities, in particular from the aspects of synthetic methods, energy and structural fabrication.80 Review studies on the synthesis and modification of LDH-based electrocatalysts have been frequently published. However, all of them are focused mainly on water splitting.23,81,82 The dramatic increase in the number of LDH-based catalysts in the range of AOP fields urgently requires a broader, thorough, and up-to-date assessment. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review article of the current design strategies of LDH-based catalysts applied in AOPs (photocatalysis, Fenton reaction methods, and sulfate radical (SO4˙−)-mediated oxidations). Therefore, the structure–performance and chemical composition–performance relationships are summarized, and they shed new light on ways to fabricate promising AOP catalysts based on LDH materials in the future (Fig. 3). In the final section, the unresolved issues and possible strategies are highlighted from the viewpoint of catalyst design and performance. It is expected that this review will draw more attention to LDH-based catalysts and bring about further improvements in this promising area.

2. Photocatalytic degradation
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is one typical example of AOPs for removing organic dyes and pesticides which exhibit particular advantages including high efficiency, low cost and non-toxicity.83,84 LDH-based photocatalysts have emerged as a very promising candidate to replace TiO2, owing to their high specific surface area, unique layered structure, the presence of defects, tunable band gaps, low cost, ease of scale-up, and good photocatalytic activity.78,79,85,86Fig. 4(a) highlights the typical process of photocatalytic degradation of organic molecules by LDH-based materials. Under ultraviolet-visible irradiation, the photoexcitation of LDH semiconductor surfaces generates photoactivated charge carriers (electron–hole pairs). The photogenerated electrons migrate from the valence band (VB) of LDHs to the corresponding conduction band (CB), leaving holes in the VB, resulting in the electrons and holes occupying the CB and VB of the LDH semiconductor, respectively. For target pollutant elimination, holes can directly oxidize pollutants or react with H2O/OH− to produce hydroxyl radicals. In contrast, electrons capture dissolved oxygen (O2) to yield the superoxide radical (O2˙−). The resulting superoxide radicals are subsequently protonated to produce H2O2. H2O2 further decomposes to form OH˙. Finally, those generated radicals take part in the oxidation of pollutants.78 According to Fig. 4(b), superoxide radicals could not be generated on the surface of Zn–Al LDH because the CB edge potential of the LDH (+0.55 eV) was more positive than the potential of O2/·O2− (−0.046 eV vs. NHE).87

Table 2 summarizes these representative findings of selected photodegradation studies conducted around the world between 2016 and 2019 on the application of LDH-based photodegradation to remove organic pollutants from synthetic aqueous solutions or natural waters.

2.1. Binary LDHs
Megala et al. systematically investigated the photocatalytic activity of layered Zn, Zn–Ni and Zn–Cu hydroxide photocatalysts for the degradation of methyl blue (MB). Among the prepared layered hydroxides, Zn–Ni LDH exhibited the highest degradation rate for MB under visible light illumination. This was attributed to the successful photogenerated electron–hole separation originating from the reaction between the photogenerated holes and the intercalated carbonate species and the isomorphous process where Cu and Ni ions replace the Zn.93 It was also found that the LDHs prepared at a Mn/Cr molar ratio of 2 exhibited the highest MB removal efficiency compared to commercial TiO2 and the LDHs prepared at different Mn/Cr ratios (3:1 and 4:1). If too much Mn was on the brucite-like sheets, the crystal structure of the Mn–Cr LDH was destroyed and amorphous and non-brucite composites might be formed. Specifically, a longer hydrothermal treatment led to the formation of the desired phase-pure Mn2–Cr LDH. In addition, the presence of an ordered layered structure in the composite is the prerequisite for the photocatalytic activity of Mn–Cr LDHs and calcination resulted in a drastic decrease in the photocatalytic activity.94
2.2. Strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic degradation reactivity

2.2.1. Ternary LDHs. 
The introduction of suitable cations into the crystalline lattice of binary LDHs can create lattice defects or the incorporated cations can act as electron acceptors because of their different oxidation states, thus leading to enhanced charge separation efficiency. Moreover, by incorporating particular photoactive metal cations into LDHs, visible light-responsive photocatalysts with band gaps from 2.0 to 3.4 eV can be synthesized.85 The photocatalytic properties of Zn–Cr LDH can be improved by incorporating Bi and La cations into LDHs.85,97 The reaction rate constant of the Bi–Zn–Cr LDH sample was approximately 1.4-times higher than the reaction rate constant of Zn–Cr LDH because of the increased surface area and light-harvesting ability.85 Co- and Cu-substituted Zn–Al ternary LDHs were synthesized for Orange II (OII) degradation. Co-substituted LDH materials showed higher photocatalytic activity compared to Cu-substituted ones. This variation was because, in this case, Co can be used as a doping agent for charge separation and charge transport into Zn atoms in LDH materials, thus restraining the recombination of electrons and holes. However, if the Co (or Cu)/Zn ratio exceeded the ratio of 1:3 in the composites, the photocatalytic activity of such composites was drastically reduced, because more Co would diminish the amount of Zn catalytic centers as Zn was the limiting species for the photocatalytic reaction.99 Therefore, finding the optimal content of doped metal on the semiconductor is crucial for enhancing the ternary LDH photocatalytic activity. Inspired by the crucial role of the nature of the ions with a 4f electronic configuration in highly efficient photocatalytic activity, different amounts of Ce (3.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mol%) were incorporated into Zn–Al LDH. After being activated by a calcination–rehydration procedure, the resulting LDH containing 5% cerium exhibited much higher activity for the photodegradation of phenol than that of Zn–Al LDH. It was proven that the higher content of Ce4+ led to the capture of photogenerated electrons by efficient channeling of photogenerated electrons (e−) toward adsorbed O2 to form the superoxide radical (O2˙−). Consequently, Ce decreased the electron–hole recombination process by trapping the photogenerated electrons, enhancing the generation of OH˙ radicals by the accumulation of the photogenerated holes.98 Moreover, Ni–Co–Ti LDHs were synthesized by using urea as a template and OH˙, h+ and O2˙− played a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Acid Red G dye. The end product analysis and the mineralization studies revealed that the complex dyes have been completely degraded to simple molecules. As compared with commercial NiO, CoO and TiO2, the as-prepared LDH displayed high activity because of its high specific surface area, narrow band gap, defects and oxygen vacancies within the layered framework.100 Although metal element doping can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs therefore improving the activity of the photocatalysts, the aggregation of LDH nanoplates remains a serious problem.138,174


2.2.2. Intercalated LDHs. 
In addition to the composition of LDH metal hydroxide sheets, the intercalated anion species can also play an important role in improving the photocatalytic performance. Several papers have claimed that a high photocatalytic activity was observed for carbonate-intercalated LDHs, which was probably due to a synergetic effect of carbonate that reduced the recombination of electrons and holes.99,175 Xia et al.101 investigated the influence of the nature of the interlayer anions (F−, Cl−, Br−, I− and NO3−) in Zn–Cr LDH on the photocatalytic degradation of hexachlorobenzene. By comparing different intercalated anions, they concluded that LDHs intercalated with halogen ions exhibited higher catalytic activity than nitrate-intercalated LDHs. They attributed the higher activity to a larger surface area and narrower band gap. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the structural stability (based on the electrostatic effect and hydrogen bonding) was in the order of LDH–NO3 > LDH–F > LDH–Cl > LDH–Br > LDH–I, which was the opposite to the order of photodegradation performances. That indicated that the photocatalytic results of these LDHs were closely related to their structural stability. Furthermore, the same research group fabricated nanocomposites of multi-copper-containing Cu–Cr LDH using different Cu species for photocatalytic activity for the decomposition of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP). The Cu species would be distributed in the layers (defined as Cu1), between the layers (Cu2) and also combined on the surface of the material (Cu3). The radical testing experiments indicated that Cu1 determined the production of superoxide radicals, Cu2 determined the generation of hydroxide radicals, and Cu3 was responsible for the generation of peroxide radicals (Fig. 5). During the photocatalytic process, the contributions of OH˙ radicals, O2˙− radicals and ˙OOH radicals were 46.2%, 22.5% and 10.9%, respectively. Accordingly, the photocatalytic performance increased with increasing Cu content in the metal layer, intercalating layer and also at the material's surface. The biggest factor in enhancing the catalytic properties was the amount of Cu between the layers, because the amount of hydroxyl radicals increased with increasing Cu content between the layers.106

By taking advantage of the exchangeability of anions in LDHs, other highly photoactive complex intercalated LDHs were also synthesized and they exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic activities compared to traditional LDHs. As an example, salen–metal complexes (metal = Co or Ni) with a photoactive metalloporphyrin structure were intercalated into Zn–Cr LDH based on a coprecipitation method. The resulting salen–Ni/Zn–Cr LDH organic–inorganic hybrid materials possessed a lower band gap of 1.97 eV than the control samples including Zn–Cr LDH (2.39 eV), Zn–Ni–Cr LDH (2.21 eV) and TiO2, and exhibited much higher photocatalytic performance for visible-light-degradation of RhB compared with the pristine Zn–Cr LDH and Zn–Ni–Cr LDH. This was because the visible-light-excited electrons from salen–Ni complexes transferred to LDH, thus effectively suppressing the recombination of electrons and holes. However, the ratio of intercalated salenM cannot be too large as the metal complexes easily form a dimer with low activity, thus hindering the photocatalytic reaction.102 In another publication, the combination of a similar shape and size copper phthalocyanine-3,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetrasulfonate (CuPcTS)/3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylate (PTCB) organic anion guest and a Zn–Al LDH host endowed the resulting inorganic–organic hybrid catalysts with a 99% discoloration rate for MO after 30 min without pH adjustment. The authors attributed the excellent catalytic performance to the 2D photo-induced electron transfer (PET) under solar irradiation between the co-intercalated CuPcTS and PTCB. In this nanocomposite structure, the photo-generated electrons and holes were generated by the PET process between CuPcTS and PTCB anions under visible light. Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons transferred to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the electron acceptor (PTCB) could be accepted by O2 molecules for reduction, and the photogenerated holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital of CuPcTS could be caught by the organic dyes adsorbed on LDH layers, leading to the oxidative degradation of organic dyes. Furthermore, anionic dyes were preferentially degraded than cationic ones by CuPcTS-PTCB/LDHs, mainly because of the hydrophilic positively charged LDH surfaces.105
Most polyoxometalates (POMs) also showed excellent photocatalytic activities and a series of POM-intercalated LDHs were reported to exhibit superior photocatalytic properties to pure LDHs. In particular, the intercalation of POM anions with high negative charge was not only capable of enhancing the adsorption capability to cationic dyes, but also endowed the POM–LDH materials with photodegradation.103 When MoO4− anions were intercalated into Mg–Fe LDHs, the resulting hybrid catalysts possessed a higher surface area due to the higher degree of expansion. The metal–metal charge-transfer transitions from the MgII–O–FeIII oxo-bridged linkages led to an absorption band in the visible region, which could also promote charge-carrier trapping as well as hinder the photogenerated electron–hole recombination. Consequently, the MoO4− intercalated LDH degraded MO completely within 45 min under simulated visible-light irradiation, much higher than that by the Mg–Fe LDH (90% degradation in 3 h).104
All these findings consistently indicated that the interlayer space of a lamellar semiconductor played a crucial role in improving the catalytic performance and can be the basis for future design of new intercalating materials with tunable photocatalytic activity for applications in the photocatalytic degradation of different organic pollutants.


2.2.3. Calcined LDHs. 
LDH materials can be converted into the corresponding mixed metal oxides (MMOs) with a uniform M2+ and M3+ distribution and a high surface area after calcination treatment.176 Significantly, MMOs with unique properties are perceived as very promising candidates in photocatalytic applications because of the three following aspects: (i) the unsaturated metals in the MMO can transfer electrons effectively;80,124 (ii) new formation of photocatalytic nanocrystals such as ZnO or Fe2O3 occurs in the MMO;79,143 (iii) the higher specific surface area is beneficial for the immobilization of catalytically active species and sorption of pollutants.
After being calcined between 400 and 800 °C, Zn–Al LDH was converted into a two-phase composite (ZnO and ZnAl2O4) and the crystal size of ZnO gradually increased with the increase of calcination temperature from 3.30 nm at 400 °C to 10.84 nm at 800 °C. Both ZnO and ZnAl2O4 had the ability to absorb photons and produce photogenerated electron–hole pairs under UV light irradiation. Since the CB of ZnAl2O4 was more negative than that of ZnO, the photogenerated electrons on the surface of ZnAl2O4 could readily transfer to the CB of ZnO while the holes at the VB of ZnO would migrate to that of ZnAl2O4via the interfacial heterojunction structure. The efficient separation of electron–hole pairs was a key factor for the high photocatalytic activity of the Zn–Al MMO nanocomposite towards Cr(VI) reduction177 and the degradation of various dyes.110,178 The degradation rate of the resulting Ce–Zn–Al MMO was 6-fold higher relative to pure Ce–Zn–Al LDH due to the formation of photocatalytically active multi-metal oxides (ZnO, ZnAl2O4 and CeO2) during the calcination. Owing to the increase in the separation efficiency of electrons and holes induced by doped Ce, Ce–Zn–Al MMO catalysts exhibited much higher photocatalytic performance than that of Zn–Al MMO.118
It was found that the best catalysts, with a Zn/Fe ratio of 4 and calcined at 300 °C, exhibited a high and stable photodegradation efficiency for ibuprofen (IBF) of 95.7% under simulated solar irradiation. Further increasing the temperature led to a smaller surface area, the collapse of the brucite-like layers and a decrement in light absorption. In spite of the relatively smaller surface area, the well-interconnected micropores, the particular laminar structure, and the high dispersity of metal oxides made the Zn–Fe LDH calcined at 300 °C (primarily ZnO) qualify as a better photocatalyst. This material also exhibited good adsorption capacity (176.3 mg g−1) and photooxidation ability for As(V). Under irradiation, holes (h+) in the VB of Zn–Fe MMO directly participated in the process of IBF decomposition and the oxidation of As(III) including surface-bound As(III)(ad) and bulk As(III)(aq) in aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the h+ oxidized the water molecule into OH˙, and the photogenerated e− reduced the dissolved oxygen (O2) to O2˙−. OH˙ and O2˙− degraded IBF and oxidized As(III) into As(V) actively. Finally, the generated As(V) species could be removed from solution by forming surface complexes (Fig. 6(a)). More importantly, this Zn–Fe MMO material was subsequently found to capture As(III) effectively in the presence of IBF although IBF brought about competition for reactive species. The authors claimed that the appearance of IBF and its degradation products on the surface of the Zn–Fe MMO would offer additional hydroxyl groups for capturing As(III).111 In a very recent study, calcined multifunctional Mg–Zn–Fe LDH has also been utilized for the treatment of combined As(III) and Cd(II) wastewater. As(III) was adsorbed onto the surface of Mg–Zn–Fe MMO and then oxidized into less toxic As(V) by the generated holes (h+) or reactive oxygen species (1O2, O2˙−) under irradiation. Positive Cd(II) was attracted by the negatively charged CO32− anions in the interlayer or on the surface of Mg–Zn–Fe MMO, and then rapidly precipitated on the CdCO3 crystal. Especially, in the presence of Cd(II), a higher removal percentage of As(III) was achieved, possibly due to formation of the ternary surface complex or coordination and enhanced hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, oxidatively formed negatively charged As(V) could reduce the electrostatic repulsion force between Cd(II) cations and play a role in anion bridging, consequently resulting in a stronger attraction between MMO and Cd(II) (Fig. 6(b)). The catalysts reduced the concentration of As(III) and Cd(II) to values lower than 10 μg L−1 and 3 μg L−1 in real river water under natural light, respectively.113

After doping Mn or Co into Ni–Fe MMO, the resulting ternary MMO showed a larger surface area than that of Ni–Fe MMO.116,117 Furthermore, compared with the commercial material, the new Co–Ni–Fe MMO exhibited a higher activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue (MB), which was attributed to the combined beneficial effects of the lower band gap energy and a regular cube morphology.179 The photocatalytic activity of Ni–Fe MMO can be greatly improved by the Mn(III) species, which effectively inhibited the recombination of electron–hole pairs.116 All the precursors discussed above were prepared by hydrothermal or co-precipitation methods. Recently, Zhang et al.115 found that Zn–Ni–Al MMO prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and 700 °C treatment was much more active in p-nitrophenol photodegradation than the catalysts prepared by a traditional hydrothermal method, owing to the thermal effect, non-thermal effect and specific microwave effect. Firstly, the reactant can be heated to a certain high temperature instantaneously. Secondly, the non-thermal effect means the direct electrostatic interaction between the specific molecule and electric field in the reaction medium. Thirdly, the microwave tends to heat the heterogeneous strong absorbing materials (Zn, Ni, and Al) due to its hot spots. In particular, higher calcination temperature (800 °C) led to a large decrease in the degradation efficiency due to the collapse of the porous structure of the prepared Zn–Ni–Al MMO photocatalysts.
The catalytic performance of MMOs can be tailored by distinct interlaminar anions. For example, Mg–Al MMO was synthesized from two Mg–Al LDHs with nitrate and acetate as interlaminar anions calcined at 450 °C. The thermal treatment of materials endowed the acetate-containing samples with a larger surface area and a smaller band gap compared to the nitrate-containing samples, thus leading to a better photodegradation performance for MB.109 It is worth mentioning that in order to improve the photocatalytic properties of MMOs, their modifications by changing the M2+/M3+ ratio109 and changing the calcination temperature126 are generally carried out. However, most of the MMOs were achieved from LDHs intercalated with inorganic anions (nitrate, chloride and carbonate) by calcination treatment. We tentatively suggest that more attempts to apply organic-anion intercalated LDH nanocomposites as photocatalysts in the presence of distinct interlaminar anions may lead to different morphologies, crystalline phase amounts, specific surface areas and band gap values. In addition, according to Yang's review, the memory effect can be easily ignored by researchers, which could be one of the important reasons for the significant differences in the reported CO2 capture capacity values.75 In the field of photocatalysis, in order to fully realize the photocatalytic performance of the MMO composites, the memory effect of MMO must be hindered.177 So photodegradation tests should be performed immediately after the calcination of LDHs to prevent the influence of the memory effect. Otherwise, the experiments cannot determine the real photocatalytic activity.


2.2.4. Noble metal modified LDHs. 
Since silver and gold nanoparticles have a strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect in the visible-light region, they are widely used in visible-light photocatalysis. Many studies showed that noble metal doping is an effective way to synthesize visible-light-driven photocatalysts. Introducing noble metals such as Ag nanoparticles with an SPR effect onto LDHs would yield good candidates for further improving the solar-driven photocatalytic performance. The rational design of metal nanoparticles is of considerable importance as the morphologies and sizes of metal nanoparticles supported on LDHs can substantially influence the photocatalytic activity.75,180,181
By now, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been successfully immobilized on LDHs using different strategies including in situ reduction,182 thermal decomposition,128 photoreduction,129 and calcination–reconstruction127 to develop efficient catalysts for photocatalytic removal of aqueous organic pollutants. Ag2O on the surface of an LDH was converted to Ag0 nanoparticles via heat treatment and then Ag2O–Ag/Zn–Al LDH was obtained. The aggregation of Ag/Ag2O nanoparticles can be suppressed by the net trap confinement effect of LDH. What's more, the SPR of Ag0 can not only extend the visible light range, but can also reduce the charge carrier recombination effectively. Consequently, the optimum photocatalytic efficiency of Ag2O–Ag/Zn–Al LDH was nearly 46-fold higher than that of virgin LDH in the decomposition of tetracycline (TC) under visible-light irradiation, together with excellent recycling ability. However, the excess Ag species may become new recombination centers and obstruct the photocatalytic reaction, leading to lowered catalytic activity.128 Mikami et al.131 presented a detailed investigation of the immobilization of tuned oxidation states of AuNPs (such as Au0, Au3+ and mixed Au0/Au3+) on an LDH surface using the reconstruction and impregnation methods of synthesis, along with its application in phenol decomposition under solar light. Typically, photocatalysts comprising Au embedded during the reconstruction of LDH layers were superior to Au impregnated on LDH using a chemical reductant. It was noted that the interface of the Au2O3 phase between metallic Au0 and LDH facilitated the electron transfer from semiconducting LDH to Au sites for O2 reduction during aerobic phenol photo-decomposition. For impregnated AuNP-LDH samples, the metallic Au0NPs were not effectively embedded on the LDH surface; therefore, the electron transfer at the interface was slower and the charge separation efficiency was lower. The AuNP-LDHs obtained via reconstruction photodegraded phenol by an indirect ring cleavage mechanism via p-benzoquinone and/or other hydroxylated phenolic intermediates. The nanocomposites, obtained by impregnation of Au on LDHs, photodegraded phenol via both indirect and direct oxidative ring opening processes (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Proposed reaction mechanism of photocatalytic phenol decomposition on gold species formed on LDHs via reconstruction (A) or impregnation (B). An indirect path via p-benzoquinone was also observed for (B), but the rates were lower than those for (A) (adapted with permission from ref. 131 @Copyright 2016 Elsevier). 
Another strategy used to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency is to prepare a Ag-loaded three-component heterojunction system.129,182 Due to the existence of a large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of carbon dots (CDs), CDs can bind onto the surface of Ag NPs via a coordination interaction and this combination makes Ag NPs stable and restrains aggregation. Hydroxyl groups on the surface of CDs are not only capable of reducing AgNO3 to Ag NPs, but also lead to the partial oxidation of CDs to yield surface carbonyl groups. Moreover, CDs can provide an effective interface that facilitates electron transfer and migration, and thus enhanced the catalytic activity of Ag NPs upon interaction with CDs. All these factors contributed to the enhanced activity of CDs/Ag@Mg–Al–Ce LDH over Ag@Mg–Al–Ce LDH and Au@Mg–Al–Ce LDH catalysts for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol and five different organic dyes (CR, RhB, R6G, MB, and MO).182 When 2D Ni–Al LDH sheets were introduced to 2D C3N4 nanosheets, strong face-to-face interactions between the LDH and C3N4 were formed. The interfaces inhibited the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, some of the excited electrons on the CB of C3N4 were also captured by the Ag NPs deposited on its surface, which further promoted the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Therefore, the resulting Ag/C3N4/LDH catalysts exhibited far superior photocatalytic activity for RhB and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) as compared to pure g-C3N4, Ni–Al LDH, and the binary Ag/g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/LDH composites, which was attributed to the strong coordination between the three components in the Ag/C3N4/LDH nanocomposites.129
Alternatively, one promising route to boost the photocatalytic activity of an LDH is to decorate its surface with bimetallic nanoparticles due to their unique optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties. We have achieved the application of Pd/Au bimetallic nanoparticle-loaded nanosheets for the photocatalytic degradation of p-nitrophenol.180 A standard sol-immobilization method was employed to synthesize Au–Pd bimetallic nanoparticles supported on Mg–Zn–Al LDH and this approach was capable of controlling the particle size and morphology, as particle sizes did not change during the immobilization. The impressive enhancement in catalytic performance for OII was because of the decoration of Au–Pd nanoparticles on the LDH surface. It has been found that the presence of metal nanoparticles might lead to the effective capture of photogenerated electrons, which potentially prolongs the lifetime of radicals and may effectively improve the catalytic efficiency.134 In a recent publication, Sahoo and co-workers reported that the surface electronic behavior of the Au/Pd alloy nanoparticles was different from those of single Au and Pd nanoparticles.132 When Au/Pd–Zn–Cr LDH was irradiated and excited by visible photons, the excited electrons in the CB of LDH rapidly transferred to Au/Pd alloy sites as the Au/Pd bimetallic alloy had a higher electron-capturing tendency owing to its low Fermi level. Moreover, upon visible-light irradiation, Au/Pd alloyed nanoparticles absorbed the photons through localized surface plasmon resonance excitation, resulting in hot electrons on the alloy surface. As the work function of Pd was a little larger than the work function of Au, the hot electrons of Au and photogenerated electrons of LDH together transferred to the Pd site. In order to achieve equilibrium in work function, the energetic electrons flowed from Au to Pd to create an equal chemical potential gradient. Due to this charge redistribution, the Pd atom became rich in electrons and the Au atom electronically deficient (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes could accumulate in the VB of LDH. The heterogeneity in charge distribution improved the interactions between Au/Pd alloy nanoparticles and reactant molecules. This close interaction resulted in a decrease in the activation energy, accounting for the observed enhanced photocatalytic activity for benzyl alcohol and nitrobenzene (NB).

In general, (i) exploiting a new in situ growth method for the generation of metal nanoparticles on LDHs, (ii) controlling the morphologies and sizes of metal nanoparticles supported on LDHs, (iii) incorporating only single or a few metal atoms as active sites, and (iv) elucidating the impact of the structure and photophysical properties of the supporting LDH or MMO materials are the recent key issues in designing efficient noble metal modified LDHs as solar responsive photocatalysts.


2.2.5. Carbon nanomaterial modified LDHs. 
The study of various carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) has become a new research hotspot. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and graphene have been the most widely used CNMs over the past few decades.183 The coupling of LDHs with CNMs was proven to effectively facilitate the migration of photogenerated electrons in nanocomposites, owing to the high electron mobility and high surface area. Our previous studies suggested that LDHs and MMO particles can also be loaded onto high surface area carbonaceous materials to further improve the dispersion of the LDHs and MMO particles, improving the performance and suppressing the aggregation of LDH nanoplates.184,185
Due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups (–OH) on the LDHs and the functional groups (–COOH) of the CNTs, CNTs could act as seeds or heterogeneous nucleation sites for the growth of layered structures of LDHs to build multilayers of nanoplatelets.142 The small Zn–Al–In LDH particles were supported over nitric acid-functionalized CNTs (A-CNTs) by a co-precipitation method with a small crystallite size of 16.5 nm. In comparison, Zn–Al–In LDH crystallites presented a much smaller crystallite size on the surface of 1-pyrenebutyric acid-modified CNTs (P-CNTs) since the carboxyl groups of 1-pyrenebutyric acid immobilized on P-CNTs can selectively coordinate and/or electrostatically interact with Zn2+ cations in alkaline solution. Subsequently, the anchoring of crystallites on the surface of P-CNTs through 1-pyrenebutyric acid as an interfacial bridging linker inhibited the growth of Zn–Al–In LDH crystallites, thus leading to good metal dispersion and smaller catalyst particle sizes. The high calcination temperature assisted the formation of highly dispersed ZnO and In2O3 oxides. The resulting P-CNTs/Zn–Al–In-MMO had a smaller band gap of about 2.08 eV compared with that of pristine Zn–Al–In MMO. Although the as-synthesized nanocomposite exhibited enhanced visible-light-induced photodegradation activity toward MB originating from the efficient separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers, the material still did not cause complete photocatalytic degradation of MB after irradiation for 4 h. The unattractive performances resulted from the use of small amounts of LDHs with CNTs and their combination did not promote the coating of CNTs.143
Compared to the 3D CNTs, the 2D geometry of GO is more obviously compatible with LDHs, as the surface chemistry is expected to be similarly favorable.75 Initially, GO is ultrasonicated in deionized water and then mixed with a solution of the precursor salts (M2+:M3+) and urea under vigorous stirring. The homogeneous dispersion mixture is sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for the urea hydrolysis method—which is simple and readily scaled up for industrial production.135,136,138–140 The introduction of graphene to LDHs can promote the separation of electrons and holes. After coupling Fe3O4 and RGO prepared via a simple coprecipitation method, the resulting Fe3O4–RGO/Ni–Al LDH showed a much larger specific surface area and narrower distribution of pores than Ni–Al LDH. In addition, Fe3O4 served well as an acceptor of the photogenerated electrons from the CB of Ni–Al LDH due to the high conductivity of Fe3O4. Combining these aspects, the resulting 2D Fe3O4–RGO/Ni–Al LDH composite photocatalyst exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic degradation of 91.3% for ciprofloxacin, about 3-times larger than that of pristine Ni–Al LDH.139
It is worth noting that the vertical growth of Ni–Al–Fe LDH nanoplates onto graphene sheets afforded a more effective three-dimensional (3D) graphene/LDH photocatalyst. This was attributed to the efficient separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers originating from the doped Fe3+ ions, as well as the large specific surface area and lower aggregation of LDH. Thus, the photocatalytic performance of the 3D RGO/LDH composites for ciprofloxacin was superior to that of the corresponding 2D ones (Fe3O4–RGO/Ni–Al LDH) under visible-light illumination.138 If the RGO content surpassed 25 wt%, the extra RGO wrapped around the LDH nanoplates and therefore hindered the exposure of active sites in the photocatalyst to ciprofloxacin, leading to a declined photocatalytic performance.138,139
The calcination of the GO/Zn–M (M = Al, Fe, and Ti) LDH at an appropriate temperature under vacuum conditions endowed the MMO with great superiority in three aspects. First, GO was reduced during the calcination process to a certain extent, which enhanced the carrier mobility and improved the photo-generated electron–hole separation efficiency. Second, a heterojunction structure could be fabricated by thermal treatment, which improved the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. Third, restacking could be effectively prevented and a larger surface area could be obtained by combining RGO and MMOs to give a hybrid material.136,140
RGO/Zn–Fe LDH was prepared by a hydrothermal method and then the as-prepared samples were further calcined to obtain RGO–ZnO–ZnFe2O4 (Fig. 9(a)). Both ZnO and ZnFe2O4 can be excited and generate electrons (e−) and holes (h+) under illumination. According to the Z-scheme mechanism, the excited electrons on the CB of ZnO can directly migrate to the VB of ZnFe2O4via RGO, thus promoting the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of ZnFe2O4 can react with O2 to generate O2˙− because of the more negative position than the redox potential of O2/O2˙−. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in the VB of ZnO oxidize H2O/OH− to yield OH˙. These active species are responsible for the degradation of paracetamol and oxidation of As(III) (Fig. 9(b)). In the mixed system of paracetamol/As(III), the substitution of surface OH groups by As(V) anions inhibited the reaction between h+ and surface OH groups (generation of ·OHs), but enhanced the reaction between h+ and water molecules (generation of OH˙), as the free ·OH (·OHf) was more reactive than surface bound ·OH (·OHs) towards pollutants, and thus the paracetamol degradation in the presence of As(III) was more efficient than that in the single system of paracetamol.135 Although the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis technique yields a well crystallized nanocomposite with a uniform morphology, this method is not suitable for preparing Cu2+ and Cr3+ cationic LDHs.186 It can be seen from Table 2 that there is no research on Cu or Cr based rGO/LDH photocatalysts, since all these studies use urea as the reducing agent.

2.2.6. Semiconductors/LDHs. 
Semiconductor/LDH composites have emerged as a promising choice with admirable catalytic performance or extended properties in photocatalytic degradation processes. In comparison with pristine LDH photocatalysts, combinations with other semiconductors can not only preserve the characteristics of each material but can also improve the photocatalytic activity via promoting the light-induced electron–hole separation and extend the light-response range. In recent years, the rational combination of various semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, g-C3N4, Ag3VO4) and LDHs has been an important approach for constructing highly efficient photocatalysts.
(a) g-C3N4 modified LDHs. 
As a fascinating conjugated polymer, the band gap of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is about 2.7 eV, which allows it to be a suitable material for visible light absorption. Specifically, coupling g-C3N4 with layered semiconductors is typically applied for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of layered materials.149,187 Due to the positive charges of LDH layers and negative charges of the surface of g-C3N4 sheets, the electrostatic attraction can help the assembly of exfoliated LDH layers and g-C3N4 sheets.188 The existence of g-C3N4 restricts undesirable electron–hole recombination, while the interlayer of LDH separates the considerable numbers of active sites from each other.149 The photocatalytic activities of C3N4/Zn–Al LDH composites toward decolorization of MB highly depended on the loading of g-C3N4. At a g-C3N4 weight loading of 18%, the rate constant of g-C3N4/Zn–Al LDH was more than 5 times and nearly 2 times that of pure Zn–Al LDH and g-C3N4, respectively.90 To simulate natural circumstances, g-C3N4@Ni–Al LDH photocatalysts were added to a solution of a 10 ppm mixture of MO and RhB at neutral pH, while the degradation process did not complete within 240 min under natural solar radiation. The reason may be closely related to the stronger adsorption of the anionic dye, i.e., MO, onto the surface of the photocatalyst that influences degradation of RhB negatively, as well as the neutral pH of the reaction solution.149
Our team fabricated a novel type of 2D–2D direct Z-scheme heterostructure consisting of oxygen-doped carbon nitride (OCN) and ultrathin Co–Al LDH via an in situ growth method.92 The radical trapping experiments proved that the MO degradation was most dependent on the oxidative species of holes (h+), followed by O2−, and lastly OH˙. Specifically, the accumulated electrons in the CB of OCN cannot reduce O2 to yield O2− due to the more negative position of O2/O2˙−. Then the holes in the VB of Co–Al LDH cannot oxidize OH to yield OH˙, because of the more positive position of the OH−/OH˙ potential. The charge carrier transfer process of the OCN/Co–Al LDH heterojunction does not conform to the traditional type-II model. Therefore, the Z-scheme heterostructure should be constructed between OCN and Co–Al LDH when they form composite materials (Fig. 10). Moreover, according to the DFT calculations, the direction of charge transfer is from Co–Al LDH to OCN, and the transfer amount is about 0.59 electrons at the interface, resulting in a decrease of charge concentration in Co–Al LDH and an increase in OCN. These results further prove the generation of interfacial internal electric fields (IIEFs) between Co–Al LDH and OCN, with the transfer being from Co–Al LDH to OCN. Notably, the photocatalytic MO-decomposition activity of the hybridized photocatalyst is 38- and 239-times higher than that of pure OCN and pure Co–Al LDH, respectively. This type of Z-scheme heterojunction is beneficial for photogenerated charges to accumulate on the higher potential energy band rather than transfer to the lower energy band, so that the high potential energy band can be protected, and the electrons and holes can maintain high reactivity.189 What's more, the fabrication cost of this direct Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is low and comparable to that of conventional type-II heterojunction systems.190 When a small amount of Ag3PO4 was introduced onto the g-C3N4/Ni–Fe LDH hybrid material surface, metallic Ag nanoparticles were formed through an in situ photoreduction method. After contact, p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions were formed in the resulting Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/Ni–Fe LDH because of the Fermi level alignment of the constituent semiconductor with the SPR effect of Ag NPs. In this nanocomposite structure, excited electrons from the Ag surface plasmon resonance induced by natural solar light irradiation can be directly transferred to the CB of Ag3PO4, and they flow toward the CB of g-C3N4 and get trapped by the oxygen vacancies of Ni–Fe LDH. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes in the VB of Ni–Fe LDH could easily move to the VB of g-C3N4 and then conduct to the VB of Ag3PO4. Moreover, the existence of the built-in electric field near the interface can also enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. As a result, a quasi-type II p–n/n–n dual heterojunction has been established and the remarkable photocatalytic performance of Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/Ni–Fe LDH for Cr(VI) reduction (97%) and phenol oxidation (90%) in 2 h was far superior to that of Ni–Fe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and g-C3N4/Ni–Fe LDH.151 The ternary CuO–C3N4/Zn–Al LDH was constructed by reconstruction of a freshly calcined C3N4/Zn–Al MMO in an aqueous solution of Cu(OAc)2. The high surface area of CuO–C3N4/Zn–Al LDH favored light harvesting, while the occurrence of g-C3N4 allowed efficient separation and transfer of the charge carriers during the course of photocatalysis. Consequently, the degradation percentage of phenol increased significantly from 20% over the pristine Zn–Al LDH to almost 100% over the hybrid CuO–C3N4/Zn–Al LDH after 240 min of UV illumination. Interestingly, the C3N4/Zn–Al MMO performed even better than the ternary CuO–C3N4/Zn–Al LDH nanocomposites for phenol photodegradation after 1 h irradiation with UV light. This was attributed to a better dispersion of a greater amount of g-C3N4 on the surface of MMO, as well as the formation of a new reconstructed phase of LDH.122
 Fig. 10  Photocatalytic mechanism of OCN/Co–Al LDH based on IIEF-induced direct Z-scheme charge transfer for pollutant degradation (adapted with permission from ref. 92 @Copyright 2018 Elsevier). 
Calcining urea and citric acid at 500 °C yielded N doped graphitic carbon (N-g-C3N4) with a narrower band gap (2.42 eV) than urea derived g-C3N4 (2.69 eV). By means of a typical coprecipitation method, the agglomerated Zn–Cr LDH nanosheets were highly dispersed and anchored on the surface of N-g-C3N4 by virtue of the strong interfacial electrostatic interactions between them. The modified Zn–Cr LDH nanocomposite exhibited a lower photogenerated electron–hole recombination rate and enhanced light harvesting compared to pristine Zn–Cr LDH and g-C3N4. Particularly noteworthy was that the calcined product (CN/Zn–Cr MMO) presented 12-times and nearly 3-times higher catalytic activity than the Zn–Cr LDH and g-C3N4/Zn–Cr LDH, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic capacity for Congo red (CR) was attributed to the fact that a synergistic effect between N-g-C3N4 and ZnO–ZnCr2O4 mixed metal oxide prolonged the lifetime of carriers, and the “memory effect” of Zn–Cr MMO also increased the concentration of CR molecules on the photocatalysts.148
Although various non-metal dopants including phosphorus,191,192 sulphur,193,194 carbon,195 boron,196 and halogens197,198 have been employed for doping on C3N4 for improving the photocatalytic activity, there is little information about the combination of doped-C3N4 and LDHs (as seen from Table 2).
(b) TiO2 modified LDHs. 
When the TiO2 seeds were well dispersed on the LDH support via coprecipitation, the band-gap energy was decreased in comparison with the unsupported TiO2. The lower band-gap energy enabled the photocatalytic response in the visible region of solar irradiation and also decreased the charge separation lifetimes. These distributed foreign cations within the brucite-like network of LDH could not only act as centers for charge separation but could also enable the formation of heterojunctions between the TiO2 active sites and the LDH sheets, and thus enhance the catalytic efficiencies. As a result, a higher removal efficiency (up to 90%) for phenol than the TiO2 P25 commercial photocatalyst was obtained with Cu2+ and Fe3+ containing nanocomposites (TiO2@Cu–Zn–Al LDH, TiO2@Zn–Fe LDH, TiO2@Cu–Zn–Fe–Ti LDH) under visible-light irradiation.156 However, in our study, an excess amount of TiO2 encroached the adsorption point of TiO2/Mg–Zn–Cr LDH catalysts, leading to the lowered photodegradation activity for CR.154 Besides the classical coprecipitation methods, wet impregnation methods can also be used to prepare TiO2/LDH. Wet impregnation with TiO2 suspension diluted in water and TiO2 suspension diluted in base solution were used for the deposition of TiO2 onto calcined Zn–Al LDH, denoted as W–Ti–Zn–Al LDH and B–Ti–Zn–Al LDH, respectively. The B–Ti–Zn–Al LDH has a lower band gap compared to W–Ti–Zn–Al LDH due to the presence of the Zn2TiO4 phase and the increase of the ZnO crystal size, while the W–Ti–Zn–Al LDH has a higher band gap compared to Zn–Al LDH due to the presence of Zn coordination with hydroxyl groups. After calcination of the samples at 500 °C, B–Ti–Zn–Al MMO exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with about 89% degradation of the MB dye after 150 min of irradiation, due to the contribution of the phases (ZnO and Zn2TiO4) which were present in higher quantities, resulting in the lowest band gap. Additionally, the surface defects induced by the loaded TiO2 not only changed the electronic properties of the obtained B–Ti–Zn–Al MMO sample, but also acted as trapping sites for improving the electron–hole separation.155 Cu-doping and a subsequent reduction treatment caused the resulting Cu-doped TiO2 to exhibit extended visible-light absorption. In particular, the encapsulation of a flower-like Ni–Al LDH with black Cu-doped TiO2 endowed the resulting catalysts with remarkable performance in the degradation of Methyl orange upon visible-light illumination, which was almost 9-, 4-, and 5-times higher than those observed for LDH, Cu-doped TiO2, and P25/LDH, respectively. This was mainly attributed to the efficient transfer and separation of the photoinduced charge carriers originating from the intimate contact at the interfaces between LDH microspheres and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles.157
W. Verbruggen proposed a classification of TiO2 photocatalysts into four categories, based on their dimensionality (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D).199 From the above studies,152,153,155,156 we notice that all TiO2 supported on the LDHs show a particle morphology. In order to prompt different interactions among various TiO2 and LDH catalysts that would initiate a synergic effect, the structural and electronic properties of LDHs modified by other-dimensional TiO2 should be explored in the future.
(c) Silver-containing compound modified LDHs. 
Recently, silver-containing compounds, such as Ag3VO4,200 AgSbO3,201 and AgIO4,202 have been demonstrated to be efficient photocatalytic materials under visible-light irradiation. Compared to TiO2 catalysts, Ag2CO3 has a narrow band gap. This advantage makes it a promising visible-light responsive photocatalyst. In general, Mg–Al LDH alone exhibits low absorption in the ultraviolet region and almost no absorption in the visible region. The photocatalytic activity of Ag2CO3/Mg–Al LDH158 and AgSiOx/Mg–Al LDH159 was much higher than that of Mg–Al LDH under visible-light illumination due to the moderate band gap of silver containing compounds. In addition, the particle size of AgSiOx and Ag2CO3 was reduced to reveal more active sites, and the contact area with the target pollutants was increased, which was beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency.158,159 After anchoring Ag3PO4 on the surface of Zn–Al MMO, the photoluminescence intensity of the composites was weakened dramatically, indicating that the formation of a heterojunction between MMO and Ag3PO4 can effectively enhance the electron–hole separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers (Fig. 11(a)). Due to the abundant adsorption sites on the surface of MMO, Ag3PO4/Zn–Al MMO catalysts possessed higher adsorption capacity than pure Ag3PO4. The formed heterojunctions, and the well-matched band structure between them, protected Ag3PO4 from photo-corrosion under simulated solar light irradiation leading to a high photocatalytic stability. Owing to the more negative CB position of MMO, the excited electrons on the CB of MMO migrated to the CB of Ag3PO4, thus leading to the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Meanwhile, the injected e− on the CB of Ag3PO4 reduced the adsorbed O2 to H2O2, as a result of the more negative position than the O2/H2O2 potential, and the resulting H2O2 can further react with e− to produce OH˙. Simultaneously, the holes, that have migrated from the VB of Ag3PO4 to the VB of MMO, can react with OH− to produce OH˙. These generated OH˙ and h+ participated in the degradation of TC (Fig. 11(b)). Ultimately, the cell density of C. vulgaris in the photocatalytically treated TC solution increased with the pre-photocatalytic time and also presented a higher value compared with untreated TC solution, indicating that the TC molecules were degraded into less toxic forms during the photocatalytic degradation process (Fig. 11(c)).124

(d) Metal sulfide modified LDHs. 
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an intrinsically p-type semiconductor containing a sandwich-like stacked structure of S–Mo–S atomic layers bonded by van der Waals force of attraction. The indirect and direct band gaps of MoS2 lie within 1.2–1.9 eV, which have been applied for photocatalysis.203–205 Recently, progress has been made on LDHs modified with MoS2 to achieve superior photocatalytic activities in various ways and these examples include MoS2/Co–Al-LDH/HCF,206 MoS2/Mg–Al LDH,161 and MoS2/Ni–Fe LDH.160 Compared with that of pristine MoS2 and Mg–Al LDH, the absorbance of MoS2/Mg–Al LDH in the visible region was enhanced, which could generate more photons to produce more photogenerated carriers. During the reaction, the Mg–Al LDH layer served as an inorganic conductive layer to transport photogenerated electrons efficiently. Thus, a lower recombination efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs was achieved in the resulting MoS2/Mg–Al LDH hybrids. The composites completely degraded the MO in 50 mg L−1 and 100 mg L−1 MO solutions in 45 min and 105 min, respectively.161 In a more recent study, the heterostructure MoS2/Ni–Fe LDH was designed by electrostatic self-assembly chemistry and an in situ hydrothermal strategy for photocatalytic RhB dye degradation. The creation of p–n heterojunctions of type-II and Z-scheme mode of charge transfer modified the optical and electronic properties of the obtained MoS2/Ni–Fe LDH, leading to the promotion of the generation, separation, and migration of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the optimum photocatalytic efficiency of MoS2/Ni–Fe LDH was 3- and 4.5-times higher than that of Ni–Fe LDH and MoS2, respectively.160
Cadmium sulfide (CdS), as an n-type semiconductor with a relatively narrow bandgap of 2.42 eV, can efficiently absorb visible light. Qiu et al.163 intercalated CdS nanoparticles into the interlayer region of Co–Al LDHs. The as-synthesized photocatalysts were 2 times more effective than their Co–Al LDH and CdS precursors for photocatalytic degradation of acid red under visible-light irradiation. Both the higher specific surface area and the host–guest heterostructure of the nanohybrid were key factors in enhancing the catalytic properties. However, the exfoliation of Co–Al LDH was achieved in formamide solution, which may also cause water pollution. To overcome this drawback, Li et al.162 reported that well-coated CdS/Mg–Al LDH composites were prepared via a simple and environmentally friendly mechanochemical method. It was reported that for MB, over 95% was oxidized after 90 min for CdS/Mg–Al LDH while 28% oxidation was obtained for Mg–Al LDH, owing to the special structure of the uniformly distributed CdS nanoparticles in the LDH-precursor matrix.
ZnS quantum dots (QDs) can be widely introduced as a nontoxic semiconductor as they do not contain extremely toxic (Cd, Hg or Pb) or highly toxic (As or Se) elements. However, their photocatalytic applications are hampered by their wide band gap energy (3.92 eV). LDH has been used as a matrix to incorporate ZnS QDs, owing to the electrostatic interaction between the metal hydroxide layer surface and ZnS QDs.164,166 Both ZnS and Zn–Al LDH can be excited under ultraviolet light irradiation and electrons are transferred from their VB to the CB. When a small amount of ZnS component was introduced onto the LDH surfaces, electrons transferred from the more reductive CB of ZnS into the CB of LDH where they are trapped by oxygen to generate the radical species. Meanwhile, the holes migrated from the more oxidative VB of LDH to the VB of ZnS where the dyes were oxidized to H2O and CO2 by the separated holes. Therefore, combining ZnS with LDHs can result in enhanced photocatalytic activity towards RhB compared to bare samples.165 Furthermore, ZnS QDs/MII–Zn–Al LDHs (MII = Co or Mn) were fabricated for visible light driven photocatalytic applications. Obviously, the CB potential level of ZnS QDs was higher than that of Co–Zn–Al LDHs and Mn–Zn–Al LDHs, while the VB potential level of ZnS QDs was more positive than that of LDHs, so the photoexcited electrons and photogenerated holes tended to migrate from ZnS QDs to LDHs, forming a type-I semiconducting (straddling gap) band alignment. However, based on the results of photoluminescence, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectral analysis, the LDH–QD heterostructure showed an improved electron–hole separation efficiency and the light harvesting ability of UV-vis wavelengths. Therefore, a staggered heterostructure (type II) was proposed as the confirmed intrinsic zinc vacancies (VZn) and interstitial sulfur states (IS) act as acceptor states for the holes (Fig. 12). Based on the suggested band structure, the photoexcited electrons were located in the CB of the LDH.166 A similar explanation has been reported in dye sensitized solar cells.207

(e) Other semiconductor modified LDHs. 
Tungsten bronzes MxWO3, prepared by doping alkali metal into WO3, have attracted great attention owing to their better optical and electrical properties. They can be used as new functional materials for the utilization of solar energy. Upon combining LDH/MMO composites, the formed Cs0.33WO3/Ni–Fe LDH168 and Rb0.27WO3/Ni–Fe MMO169 have shown higher photocatalytic efficiency compared to that of pristine LDHs/MMOs. This enhancement in photocatalytic activity was mainly attributed to the effective separation of electron–hole pairs and prolonged lifetimes of photogenerated charges.
Bismuth-based photocatalysts including BiVO4, BiOCl, and Bi2MoO6 were intercalated into layers of LDH171 or deposited on surfaces of LDH.173 Zhao et al.170 evaluated the Bi2WO6/Ni–Al LDH photocatalyst, prepared for the photocatalytic removal of RhB, TC, and Safranine T. The enhanced presentation of the Bi2WO6/Ni–Al LDH composite heterojunction was related to the increased specific surface area, the improved visible light absorption, and the effective separation of electron–hole pairs. After 5 cycles, the degradation efficiencies of RhB, ST, and TC on the Bi2WO6/Ni–Al LDH photocatalyst remained above 75%.

3. Fenton and photo-Fenton
Both Fenton and photo-Fenton processes have been proven to be effective for depolluting water. In heterogeneous Fenton catalysis, OH˙ can be generated based on the catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 by iron (or other transition metals) containing solid catalysts instead of soluble Fe2+ in classical Fenton processes.26Fig. 13 illustrates the redox reactions between H2O2 and various active metal species in LDHs for the generation of OH˙. Reactants can approach the edges of LDHs and make contact with catalytic sites in the brucite-like sheets. Thus, the well-ordered layered structure provides plenty of space for the reaction. Moreover, hydroxyl groups on the sheets endow LDHs with highly hydrophilic properties, favoring the presence of hydrophilic contaminants and H2O2 near the active sites which is essential for driving the reaction.208 As shown in Table 3, LDHs are able to degrade pollutants over a wide pH range; this overcomes the major disadvantage of the conventional Fenton process in degrading organics only under severe acidic conditions. Basically, the photo-Fenton process is a photo-assisted Fenton process involving light irradiation from natural solar irradiation or an artificial light source. Under light irradiation, the LDH could be excited to generate photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Subsequently, the photogenerated holes can react with H2O to produce OH˙ and the photogenerated electrons transfer to Fe3+, resulting in the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+. The produced Fe2+ rapidly catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 to produce OH˙ and regenerate Fe3+. In addition, direct photolysis of H2O2 also initiates additional OH˙.209,210 Thus, a higher degradation efficiency can be obtained in a shorter reaction time.

3.1. Binary LDHs

3.1.1. Fe-based LDHs. 
Due to the merits of the specific structure, non-toxic nature, low cost, and versatility in composition, Fe-based LDHs have been widely used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants. In the Fenton process, the amount of OH˙ is highly dependent on H2O2 concentration. When the H2O2 concentration is too high, the formation of HO2˙ from excess H2O2 being used as an OH˙ scavenger leads to a decrease in catalytic activity. A similar trend to this was also noticed in several studies of LDHs.219,231,232 In the typical Fe–Al LDH/H2O2 system, the dissolved Fe2+ from the LDHs reacted with H2O2, resulting in a homogeneous Fenton reaction. Meanwhile, the undissolved LDH took part in a heterogeneous Fenton system with H2O2. The OH− generated during the Fenton reaction can induce an ion-exchange process by a dissolution–reprecipitation and ion exchange further led to the release of additional iron ions into the system. In addition, the small amounts of LDHs newly formed by the dissolution–reprecipitation process also acted as the catalysts in the above process. Therefore, the mechanism of BPA degradation by Fe–Al LDHs was proved to be a synergy of the homo- and heterogeneous Fenton process (Fig. 14). The Fe2+ and Fe3+ generated during the reaction returned to the structure of the LDHs, so the material can be recycled, avoiding the precipitation of large amounts of difficult-to-separate iron sludges.217 Co(II)–Fe(III) LDHs with a Co/Fe molar ratio of 2 were prepared using the coprecipitation method and used with H2O2 for the removal of Direct Red 23 (DR23)216 and NB.219 The positive charge of the Co–Fe LDH surface, which was caused by lower pH, attracted the sulfonate group of DR23 easily. The adsorption capacity decreased with increasing pH values, but an alkaline environment was beneficial for Co2+ → Co3+ conversion, which subsequently catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 resulting in the desired OH˙. This compensated for the disadvantage in adsorption with increasing pH values. Even at an initial pH value of 10, the degradation percentage of DR23 still reached 80% within 30 min.216 Given the standard reduction potentials of Co2+/Co3+, the reduction of Co3+ by Fe2+ was thermodynamically favorable, and the efficient regeneration of Co2+ at the catalyst surface would also be responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the Co–Fe LDHs. Compared to 100% degradation efficiency after 30 min at pH 2.7, Co–Fe LDH showed a low degradation efficiency (10%) for NB when the initial pH was 5.0 after 3 h reaction. The researchers ascribed the efficient removal to the soluble iron of the reaction. If the pH was high, Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 precipitated in solution, and thus the concentration of iron in the solution dramatically decreased. However, the researchers did not detect the chemical state of Fe and Co species on the fresh and spent catalysts using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); thus the exact role of Co in this study was not revealed.219

3.1.2. Cu-based LDHs. 
Besides the decomposition of H2O2 by Fe2+, the Fenton reaction effects of copper have also been assessed in some cases. Actually, Cu+ can afford a much stronger thermodynamic driving force for the electron transfer to H2O2 for the generation of OH˙ radicals as compared with the classic Fe2+ Fenton catalysts. What's more, the circulation rate of Cu+/Cu2+ is much faster than that of Fe2+/Fe3+.211 The catalytic activity for MO was successfully improved from 27.9% to 96.5% under near-neutral initial pH conditions in 90 min after introducing copper ions into the Mg–Al LDHs. The higher the copper ion content in the layered double hydroxides, the faster the degradation of MO. As a result, the degradation rate of MO has already reached 99.1% in 10 min for spherical Cu–Al LDH.221 Compared to conventionally synthesized inorganic anion intercalated Cu–Al LDH, the intercalated cysteine in the interlayer of LDH can strongly accelerate the rate-determining conversion of Cu2+ to Cu+, resulting in the production of a greater number of OH˙ radicals for RhB and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) oxidation. More importantly, the cysteine-Cu–Al LDH exhibited high degradation efficiency over a relatively wide pH range, from 4.0 to 10.0.213 Growing the LDH on the surface of carbon fibers (CFs) can prevent the aggregation of the hierarchical and highly uniform LDH nanosheets. Moreover, the electrical conductivity and porous structure of the CF also allow the diffusion/transport of ammonia nitrogen. Therefore, this fabricated hierarchical CF/Cu–Al LDH catalyst material exhibited a three-phase synergistic effect with enhanced catalytic performance for the degradation of ammonia nitrogen, as well as improved stability and electron conductivity due to the well-defined structure of the hybrids.222 By adjusting the synthesis pH value, a high density of oxygen vacancies can be created in Co–Cu LDH. The formation of a Co–O–Cu oxo-bridged bond was assumed to be responsible for the electron transfer and the generation of defects. The oxygen vacancies can facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 to generate OH˙.220

3.2. Strategies for enhancing the Fenton and photo-Fenton catalytic reactivity

3.2.1. Morphology controlled LDHs. 
Many studies have paid attention to controlling the specific morphologies of LDH in the field of adsorption for pollutants,233 water splitting,234 chemical sensing and biomedicine.235 These studies have shed light on the design of highly efficient heterogeneous Fenton catalysts by properly controlling the morphology of Fe based LDHs. For example, Wang et al. (2018) found that Ni–Fe LDH with a ball-like structure exhibited better Fenton catalytic performance for MB than LDH with sheet structures. The higher catalytic performance of LDH nanospheres was attributed to their much smaller particle size, larger specific surface area, and lower stability. The total iron and ferrous iron leached from ball-like Ni–Fe LDH were reported to be higher than those from sheet Ni–Fe LDH.218 Fe3O4@LDH derivatives have received increasing attention by materials scientists not only because of the combination of the advantages of both a magnetic core and a reactive shell but also the possible synergetic effect between them. Morphology-controlled monodisperse core@shell structured Fe3O4@Cu–Mg–Al LDH nanocatalysts were used in phenol hydroxylation by H2O2. The hierarchical core@shell structured magnetic catalysts possessed obviously enhanced activity for phenol hydroxylation compared with pure Cu–Mg–Al LDH. It is worth emphasizing that the high activity of the composite catalysts seemed to arise not only from the highly dispersed copper species, but also from the synergetic effect between the Cu-LDH shell and the Fe3O4 core upon varying the morphology. The HO–Cu2+–O–Fe2+–O– linkage formed at the interface between the Cu–Mg–Al LDH shell and the Fe3O4 core, affording the high catalytic activity of the core@shell magnetic nanocatalysts.227 LDHs can also be immobilized onto a SiO2 shell due to the abundant negative charges for electrostatic stabilization. The Fe3O4@SiO2@Mg–Fe LDH showed ultrahigh adsorption capacity for MB (370 mg g−1) because of the porous structure of the LDHs. Under acidic conditions, the thin layer of small-sized Mg–Fe LDH nanoparticles on the Fe3O4@SiO2 surface readily released the captured MO molecules and the catalytic Fe3+ ions in the degradation process. Meanwhile, the SiO2 shell protected the Fe3O4 from dissolution in acidified solution, thus offering superior chemical and colloidal stability for multiple reuse cycles. By taking advantage of the above properties, the contaminant degradation constants in the Fe3O4@SiO2@Mg–Fe LDH Fenton systems were 10 times more efficient than heterogeneous chemistry based on the Fenton-like activity of pristine LDHs. Notably, no significant decrease (2–10%) was observed either in NP size, surface charge, or its dye removal efficiency even after 25 cycles of reuse.229


3.2.2. Co/Cu-based ternary LDHs. 
Although the LDH material can act as a source of Fe2+ ions, the Zn–Fe LDH material exhibited little catalytic activity for the degradation of acetaminophen (APAP). After the substitution of Cu, the resulting Cu–Zn–Fe LDHs degraded the APAP completely within 24 h by a Fenton-like reaction. In addition, the more toxic arsenite can be gradually oxidized into arsenate and adsorbed at the same time by Cu–Zn–Fe LDH in the presence of H2O2. For simulated water samples at pH 7.0 with coexisting acetaminophen (15 mg L−1) and arsenic (5 mg L−1), after treatment with Cu–Zn–Fe LDH and H2O2, the residual arsenic concentration in water was less than 10 μg L−1, and acetaminophen was not detected in the solution.224 Yan et al.225 also reported that solid Cu(II)–Mg(II)–Fe(III) LDHs could efficiently catalyze the activation of H2O2 for the degradation of ethylbenzene (EB), the redox of Cu(II)/Cu(III) on the LDHs accounted for the formation of OH˙ radicals, and the effect of Fe(III) in Cu(II)–Mg(II)–Fe(III) LDHs on the whole H2O2 catalysis reaction was negligible. In another study, it was found that the electron transfer between Ni and Cu in the brucite-like sheets was beneficial to the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. With the decrease in Cu/Ni ratio, more Ni2+ cations are present in sheets, which could provide more electrons to Cu2+ to produce Cu+. In addition, the highly dispersed MO6 octahedra in the brucite-like sheets could facilitate such electron transfer and hence increase the percentage of Cu+. Consequently, the special structure of Cu–Ni–Fe LDHs could offer highly active Cu+ species and an efficient regeneration of Cu+, resulting in a good mineralization of phenol at a much lower H2O2 dosage. In particular, the calcined Cu–Ni–Fe LDHs were inactive for phenol hydroxylation when compared to the fresh LDHs, whose total organic carbon (TOC) removal was significantly decreased from 100% to 61.5%.208 When ternary Cu, Ni, Al hydrotalcites were calcined in the range of 150–800 °C, a continuous increase in the activity of phenol hydroxylation with an increase in the calcination temperature was observed. The samples calcined at 800 °C showed that the maximum oxidation activity could be attributed to the inherent activity of the spinel phase, which crystallizes at around this temperature. However, the activities of calcined catalysts were still lower than those of fresh hydrotalcites.236
The Co2+ substituted Mg–Al LDH exhibited much higher catalytic oxidation of MB and OII than the corresponding Mg–Al LDH in the Fenton process, mainly because of the low redox potential of transition metals that could facilitate catalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals. Comparing Co substituted Mg–Al LDH materials with Cu substituted Mg–Al LDH materials, it was also observed that the degradation rate for Co substituted LDH materials was slightly higher, since for copper, the production of the OH radical could be suppressed under acidic or neutral conditions.226 As transition metal ions with variable valency, Mn ions could also accelerate the chain reaction of radicals and Co2+ was proven to be much more efficient than Mn2+ in a Fenton reaction system. As the presence of Mn2+ could facilitate the reduction of Co3+, Co–Mn–Fe LDHs exhibited higher catalytic activity than Co–Fe LDHs on the degradation of 4BS.212


3.2.3. Calcined Fe LDHs. 
The calcined Ni–Fe LDH, containing Ni3Fe and Fe3O4, can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst to degrade OII in a visible light assisted Fenton-like experiment. Fe3+ and Ni2+ in magnetic Ni3Fe/Fe3O4 catalysts could be reduced to low valence by OII. Interestingly, the materials obtained from spent Ni–Fe LDH derived from the adsorption of OII as a precursor presented much better catalytic activities than those from Ni–Fe LDH under the same conditions. In addition, the former materials exhibited great superiority including variety in metal valences, a higher number of –OH surface groups, stronger magnetism and higher Curie point. The findings of this work give us a new direction for reutilization of the LDH adsorbent sludge and a reasonable strategy for enhancing the heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalytic reactivity of LDH.237 In a more recent study, the symbiotic crystals of ZnO, CuO and ZnFe2O4 in calcined Zn–Fe–Cu LDH enabled the MMO to show absorption in the UV, visible and near-infrared (NIR) light regions and to produce a transient photocurrent in the presence of H2O2 under NIR irradiation. Because of the formation of p–n–p heterojunctions, the CB potentials for CuO and ZnFe2O4 become even lower than that for ZnO. The photogenerated electrons in the CuO and ZnFe2O4 components under visible and NIR light irradiation can, therefore, either be captured by H2O2 to form OH˙, which can oxidize MO, or transfer to the CB of the ZnO component, resulting in the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Consequently, the Zn–Cu–Fe MMO/H2O2/NIR light system showed 9-times higher activity than the Zn–Cu–Fe MMO/H2O2 system in the decomposition of MO.238
After a calcination treatment, the metal ions in LDHs become more disperse and produce a highly diffuse mixture of metal oxides, which is an ideal material for catalyst supports.239 The well-dispersed Mg–Al MMO supported iron nanoparticles can be obtained by calcination of Fe(CN)63−-intercalated Mg–Al LDH precursors. However, the resulting Fe/MMO exhibited a relatively low activity for dye degradation and only 37% of MB and 56% of MO were decolored after 2 h. Subsequently, Fe(CN)63−-intercalated Mg–Al LDH was utilized to catalyze the growth of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) from catalytic chemical vapor deposition. In comparison, Fe/DWCNT-MMO appeared to be much more effective in Fenton-like reactions and the degradation percentages for MB and MO dyes reach about 54% and 80% after 1 h, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the removal efficiency of TOC for Fe/DWCNT-MMO was approximately 99% after 6 h. Although, the active Fe NPs were not in direct contact with H2O2 because of the isolation and cover of the DMCNTs, the interactions between the formed metallic Fe NPs and DWCNTs or graphitic carbon shells changed their local work function,240 hence resulting in a more efficient Fenton-like reaction for the degradation of cationic dyes.215 The generation of hydroxyl radicals through the Fe0/H2O2 system functions is proposed in Fig. 13.


3.2.4. Fe-chelating agent intercalated LDHs. 
Although more than 80% of the color can be removed in a UV/H2O2/Zn–Al LDH system, the mineralization efficiency of Azocarmine B (ACB) was only 12.12%. It could be concluded that the ACB can only be oxidized into longer-lived colorless intermediates but cannot be mineralized into H2O and CO2 by hydroxyl radicals. Comparatively, for the UV/H2O2/EDTA-Fe LDH system, excellent ACB removal efficiency can be obtained, and the discoloration and TOC removal efficiency reach up to 96.26% and 56.74%, respectively. The process of circular transformation between EDTA-FeIII-LDH and EDTA-FeII-LDH was responsible for converting H2O2 into amounts of active species (such as OH˙). What's more, the iron leaching from EDTA-Fe LDH was relatively low (0.008 mg L−1), as the Fe ions returned to the surface or interlayer of the catalysts after the intermediates were mineralized into CO2 and H2O.241 When Fe-citrate was introduced into the interlayer of LDHs, these restrictive layers acted as the molecular container. Therefore, Fe complexes were more stable and difficult to deactivate. The discoloration efficiency of the Fe-citrate/LDH photo-Fenton reaction was further increased 18.1% compared with that of the homogeneous photo-Fenton catalyzed by the Fe(III)-citrate complex due to the deactivation of complexes because of the formation of polyhydroxy iron.242 These findings are in accordance with those in Zhu's recent review that the drawbacks related to the low efficiency of photo-Fenton at neutral pH could be enhanced by adding chelating agents due to the formation of strong complexes with iron.243 What's more, these reports provide a new strategy for the design of new photo-Fenton LDH catalysts for the degradation of contaminants at neutral pH.
The above heterogeneous photo-Fenton reaction was accelerated by UV activation, but UV light only accounts for 5% of solar light and consumes large amounts of energy in practical applications. Undoubtedly, it is important to improve the utilization rate of light energy and decrease the operation costs for using this technique on a large commercial scale. The iron tetrasulphophthalocyanine complex (FePcS), as a kind of metal phthalocyanine, was reported to have an attractive photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic substrates under visible-light irradiation in the presence of H2O2. Inspired by this, FePcS was intercalated into the galleries of Mg–Al LDH through anion exchange. The immobilized FePcS can be well preserved by LDHs and avoid inactive aggregation. Under visible-light irradiation, FePcS-LDH was excited to the singlet state (1FePcS*-LDH) which can further transform to the triplet state (3FePcS*-LDH) via intersystem crossing. 3FePcS*-LDH interacted with ground state oxygen to generate the very active singlet oxygen. In addition, when H2O2 was added to the iron center of [Fe(PcS)-LDH], [HOOFeIII(PcS)-LDH] was formed and can be excited by visible-light irradiation to form a transition state. Then the O–O peroxide bond of the transition state can be cleaved rapidly to generate OH˙ radicals. Hence, the host–guest materials exhibited excellent catalytic performance with about 99.80% and 76.50% decolorization and TOC removal, respectively.244
As a general comment to all the complexes examined above, no information about the influence of iron/ligand ratio, LDH/ligand ratio and the environmental impact of chelating agents/LDH was reported in these literature studies. In particular, no authors have mentioned the effect of the wavelength and power of the irradiation source in the photo-Fenton process catalyzed by Fe-containing LDH, while the light irradiation device is the core component in the photo-Fenton process.

4. Sulfate radical-based AOPs
Sulfate radicals (SO4˙−) and hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) are reported to be the strongest oxidizing species produced in AOPs.245 Compared to OH˙ (E0OH˙ = 1.8–2.7 eV), SO4˙− has yielded a high redox potential (2.5–3.1 eV), long half-life (30–40 μs), and high selectivity to organic matter with unsaturated bonds and an aromatic structure. Moreover, SO4˙− is more reactive than OH˙ at circumneutral pH (mostly prevailing in aquatic systems). Based on these properties, sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have been the subject of tremendous research interest during the past decade.246 Generally, SO4˙− is generated via peroxydisulfate (PDS) or peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. PMS is usually activated by transition metals more easily than PDS.247 PMS could be activated to produce SO4˙− by ultraviolet (UV) light, heat, ultrasound, base granular activated carbon or transition metals (Fe, Co, Cu, etc.).248 Among these activation methods, the activation of PMS by transition metals is the most common.249 Compared with the ionic form of transition metals, heterogeneous catalysts instead of homogeneous catalysts not only decrease the operation costs by the recycling of catalysts, but also avoid the second pollution induced by the higher metal ions leaching in the homogeneous reaction.245,250 LDHs/MMOs with transition metals have been used as highly active catalysts in the field of AOPs in recent years. These mixed metal catalysts have improved chemical and thermal stability, polyfunctionality (e.g. they are photoactive, magnetically separable, etc.), high redox activity and better catalytic activity compared to single metal catalysts.251,252 From Table 4, it can be seen that PMS is generally activated by Fe-based and Co-related LDH. The surface hydroxyl group (M–OH) and the surface lattice oxygen on the LDH/MMO catalyst surface play a functional role in facilitating the activation of PMS.246,253,254 Hydroxyl groups at the surface of catalysts provide coordination sites for complexation with oxidants which in turn accelerate the redox properties of heterogeneous catalysts during catalytic reactions.255 The relative ratio of the surface hydroxyl group increased, which is ascribed to the formation of M–OH groups or O2 adsorbed on the catalysts, while the relative ratio of Co–Fe LDH surface lattice oxygen decreased after degradation, which results from its oxidation to O2 coupled with the reduction of Co3+/Fe3+ to Co2+/Fe2+.246,253

The results of the LDH based system were quite consistent with the regular rule reported in previous work that the optimum degradation generally occurred under near-neutral or acidic conditions.256–259 However, the relatively high degradation efficiency (about 90%) can still be observed in the pH range of 9 to 10 (as seen from Table 4). Three factors, (i) the enhanced electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged LDH surface and positively charged pollutants,257 (ii) the dominant covalent bond interaction between PS and active sites of the LDH catalyst and (iii) the high stability of the catalyst, were reported to explain the broad pH range activity of the LDH/PDS system.255
4.1. Binary LDHs

4.1.1. Co-based LDHs. 
Many previous studies have demonstrated that Co2+ ions are the most effective homogeneous catalysts for PMS activation.257,270 For this reason, PMS activation using cobalt-containing LDHs as heterogeneous catalysts seems to be a promising strategy. Zeng's team have successfully synthesized Co–Mn LDH260 and Co–Fe LDH271 by using a conventional coprecipitation method, and they were applicable for SR-AOPs. Co2+ and Mn3+ on the surface of catalysts lost electrons to activate PMS to form SO4˙−, and OH˙ was produced by the reaction of SO4˙− with H2O/OH− in the system subsequently. According to the standard reduction potentials of metals, the regeneration of Mn3+ might mainly rely on the reduction of Mn4+ by Co2+. Based on the unique structure of LDHs, the octahedral site can easily accommodate Co(II), Co(III), Mn(III) and Mn(IV), allowing the Mn and Co species to be reversibly oxidized and reduced while retaining the same structure. Finally, the generated SO4˙− and OH˙ simultaneously attacked the dye molecules, causing rapid degradation of Acid orange G (AOG) (Fig. 15). Because the chromophore centers of azo functionality dyes were preferentially attacked by hydroxyl radicals, the degradation rates of different dye molecules followed the order RhB < MB < MO < AOG. Co–Mn LDH could achieve complete degradation of AOG within 80 s in the presence of PMS (0.025 g L−1 catalysts, 0.1 g L−1 PMS, 50 mg L−1 AOG and 25 °C). The large quantity of OH− under alkaline conditions would inhibit the static interactions between Co–Mn LDH and AOG or PMS and a high degradation percentage was achieved under acidic and neutral conditions. That means that PMS activation induced by Co-based LDH can go on under ordinary conditions and its potential for practical applications is more than that of H2O2.249,260 In a very recent study, the same research team prepared Co–Al LDH by in situ etching of a cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF). Ethanol was used as the solvent to slow down the etching process of Co-ZIF to avoid collapse and impurity. The removal efficiency of the PMS/Co–Al LDH system towards TC degradation can reach up to 92.3% within 5 min and the degradation rate constant of the PMS/Co–Al LDH system was about 16.6-times higher than that of the Co-ZIF/PMS system. The higher content of Al ions in Co–Al LDH helped the low content of Co ions to transfer electrons to PMS for activation. Notably, the PMS/Co–Al LDH system was effective and almost unaffected by pH variation (7–11), NaCl (0–10 mM), Na2CO3 (0–10 mM), Na2SO4 (0–10 mM), and humic acid (0–10 mg L−1) in water.261

4.1.2. Fe-based LDHs. 
To avoid potential Co leaching, researchers are shifting their focus to the environmentally friendly mixed metal catalysts of iron and manganese. By adjusting the stoichiometric Fe/Mn ratio, we subsequently synthesized a series of Mnx–Fe LDHs (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8) and utilized them as effective catalysts for PMS activation to degrade Acid Orange 7 (AO7). The results showed that the decomposition rate of AO7 increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of the Mn/Fe molar ratio. When the Mn/Fe molar ratio was higher than 2, the reversible redox process of Mn and Fe was negatively affected, leading to poor activation of PMS.259 As NO3− anions could scavenge sulfate and hydroxyl radicals and produce nitrate radicals with a lower redox potential of 2.3–2.7 V, the NO3− anions had slight inhibitory effects on AO7 degradation. This was in accordance with previous research that indicated no obvious change in the degradation after the addition of NO3−.260,262,272 Undoubtedly, the addition of CO32− and HCO3− severely prohibited the degradation efficiency of Mn2–Fe LDH. The reasons were probably because CO32− and HCO3− reacted with SO4˙− and OH˙ to produce a weak oxidant CO3˙− and HCO3˙, respectively.259,267 Specifically, the radical scavenging ability of CO32− is stronger than that of HCO3− due to its higher reaction rate constant with OH˙.273 Cl− reacted with HSO5− to generate Cl2 and HOCl and the produced Cl2 and HOCl had a good effect for the AO7 bleaching. On the other hand, Cl− also reacted with free radicals and produced chlorine radicals (Cl˙, Cl2˙−, and ClHO˙−), which had lower activity. Hence, in some cases, the presence of Cl− led to the decrease of removal efficiency.260,262 Typically, SO4˙− can be scavenged by the excess Fe2+ leading to incomplete degradation of pollutants.274 The degradation efficiency of dyes decreased with increasing Fe-based LDH concentration. Hoverer, the degradation performance in this system was not slowed down with further increasing the catalyst loading.249,250,259,260 This was because excessive catalyst loading made the supply of oxidant in the system insufficient.250,271 In a more recent research study, the Fe–Mn LDH (with a molar ratio of 1:1) was capable of removing 85% octadecylamine (10 mg L−1) within 25 min, which is obviously higher than that of pure PMS. SO4˙− and OH˙ were confirmed to be the primary radicals in this degradation system. Moreover, the addition of Cl− could promote the octadecylamine degradation, as a result of the generated HClO, as well as the generation of OH˙.264
Considering that the combination of photo-degradation by LDH-based catalysts could enhance the sulfate radical induced degradation of bio-recalcitrant organic contaminants, we used a common solid catalyst, Cu–Fe LDH, to heterogeneously activate persulfate (PS) under visible-light irradiation. Owing to the action of visible-light photons, the photo-induced electrons and holes were produced in the Cu–Fe LDH conduction band and valence band, respectively. The electrons were immediately captured by PS to generate SO4˙−, which effectively suppressed the recombination of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, both Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu2+/Cu3+ pairs effectively stimulated PS to produce SO4˙−. Notably, the regeneration of Fe2+ and Cu2+ could be accelerated by trivalent metals capturing photo-induced electrons. The generated SO4˙− in aqueous solution could further produce OH˙ via a radical interconversion reaction. These two radicals with strong oxidizing properties could attack Methyl Violet (MV) molecules simultaneously (Fig. 16). Consequently, Cu–Fe LDH/PS exhibited a much higher MV removal performance (100%) under visible-light irradiation than under dark conditions (42.6%).

4.2. Strategies for enhancing the catalytic reactivity for SR-AOPs

4.2.1. Co/Fe-based ternary LDHs. 
To make full use of the advantages of transition metals, a series of iron-group element based ternary LDH materials were also prepared by co-precipitation methods, and their excellent catalytic activities have also been investigated. Cu–Co–Fe LDH with varying divalent/trivalent metal cation ratios have also been successfully fabricated for NB degradation. The ternary catalysts exhibited high degradation efficiency (87.4%) in a Cu–Co–Fe-LDH/PMS system, much higher than that of the Cu–Co–Fe-LDH/H2O2 system (69%). From scavenger experiment results, HO radicals were the main reactive species for NB degradation in this system. Co2+ and Cu2+ ions transferred electrons to PMS and were oxidized to Co3+ and Cu3+, accompanied by the generation of hydroxyl radicals and sulfate ions. Subsequently, the hydroxyl radical attacked the benzene ring of NB, copper and cobalt obtained electrons, and they were reduced to positive divalent species, thereby completing a surface catalytic cycle. During this cycle, Fe(II) was generated by the oxidation–reduction reaction between Co(II) and Fe(III), and Fe(II) activated PMS to generate OH˙. The efficient regeneration of surface Co(II) and Cu(II) through this cycle allowed NB to be rapidly degraded.245 Similarly, the as-prepared Co–Fe–Ni LDH showed about 95% degradation efficiency for RhB in complex water matrices (tap water, sewage water, river water, lake water, and mountain spring water). Neither Fe nor Ni participated in the dye degradation and the Co(II)–Co(III)–Co(II) cycle was responsible for activating PMS to generate radicals for dye degradation.246 Because Cu and Fe were also effective at activating PMS, compared with both Mg–Fe LDH and Mg–Cu–Al LDH materials, Mg–Cu–Fe LDH exhibited significantly higher catalytic activity for activating PMS for the degradation of APAP.247 More importantly, APAP and RhB in the actual water samples (lake water) can be effectively degraded by Mg–Cu–Fe LDH within 25 min.247 These findings highlighted the practicability of ternary LDH in real water remediation. In particular, the combination of Fe3O4 and Cu–Ni–Cr LDH endowed the catalytic system of Fe3O4/Cu–Ni–Cr LDH and PMS with several potential advantages for the degradation of AO7, namely (i) mixing of various metals, which makes it possible to release them at the same time, (ii) the controllable atomic ratio of metals, (iii) large surface area to adsorb the anionic dyes, and (iv) facile separation and recycling.266,267 According to the XPS analysis of the used Fe3O4/Cu–Ni–Cr LDH, 20% Cu(II) was transformed into Cu(I). The proportion of Fe(II) rose from 30% to 46% and that of Fe(III) decreased from 70% to 54%. The valence of Ni remained unchanged, indicating that Ni just worked as an efficient charge-carrier transport channel for the conversion from Cu(II) to Cu(I). Therefore, PMS was activated by Cu(II) and Fe(III) as the unveiled activation sites on the surface of Fe3O4/Cu–Ni–Cr LDH to generate sulfate radicals.266


4.2.2. Calcined Co LDHs. 
During the catalytic oxidation of toxic organics, MMOs could not only increase the probability of interaction between PMS and pollutants but also catalyzed the decomposition of PMS to generate SO4˙−.252 After calcination of a Co–Al-based ternary LDH at 500 °C for 5 h, Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 can be formed in the MMO.252,262,263 The optimal loading of cobalt sites was thought to be critical for the high efficiency of catalytic decontamination because excessive cobalt sites formed on the mixed metal oxides could scavenge the active radicals and thus cause a decline in the removal rate.263 Different from previously reported studies which suggested that the optimum degradation performance usually occurred under near-neutral conditions, the CuOx@Co–Mg–Al MMO/PS system efficiency became nearly constant at ≥98% from pH = 5.0 to 12.0. This was because the dominant interaction between PS and active sites of CuOx@Co–Mg–Al MMO catalysts was through covalent bonds rather than through electrostatic attractions. Furthermore, the eventual pH of the solution remained stable at 9.5 ± 0.8 for all initial pHs (5.0–10.0), attributed to the buffer capacity of CuOx@Co–Mg–Al MMO catalysts. Most importantly, no leaching of Co2+ ions was detected throughout the studied pH range, and as leaching of metal ions is commonly responsible for the loss of activity in heterogeneous catalysts, this demonstrated the high stability of these catalysts.255 It is worth noting that Co–Cu–Al MMOs did not transform into a layered structure after the degradation reaction although former studies have reported that Co–Mg–Al MMOs can recover their layered structure upon treatment with aqueous solution containing anions.262,263 Co–Cu–Al MMOs obtained at different calcination temperatures (500–800 °C) were tested for activating PMS to degrade AO7. The AO7 degradation efficiency decreased with the calcination temperature increasing from 500 to 800 °C. The CuO phase was not detected at calcination temperatures of 500 and 600 °C. Noteworthily, when the calcination temperature was higher than 600 °C, the CuO phase was observed due to the breakage of the Cu–O bond, which resulted in a change in the Cu2+ coordination environment to form CuO. The interaction between Co and Cu became weak because of the separation of Cu from the spinel structure to form a separate CuO phase, leading to a reduction in degradation efficiency. The high performance of Co–Cu–Al MMOs was attributed to the Co–Cu synergistic effect which facilitated the redox cycle of Co2+/Co3+; thus the formation of a single phase containing both Co and Cu was crucial for exploiting the Co–Cu synergistic effect to improve catalytic performance.262
It should be noted that all the MMOs activating PMS were obtained through the calcination of precursors at 500 °C for 5 h.252,255,262,263 We noticed that Co3O4 can be obtained when the calcination conditions were 400 °C for 6 h275 or 500 °C for 4 h.276 However, the present reports only reported the influence of calcination temperature in a narrow range (500–800 °C).262 Studies on the effects of calcination time on the catalytic performance in SR-AOPs have been scarce. As the calcination parameters have a significant influence on the physicochemical properties of LDOs, resulting in different catalytic performances, metal ion leaching and so on, this area needs to be emphasized in future studies.


4.2.3. Intercalated LDHs. 
As is commonly known, LDHs have a large anion exchange capacity for various anions. Hence, the persulfate ion can be intercalated into Mg–Al LDH by an ion-exchange procedure. This is the first report about the elevated oxidation capacity of intercalated PDS at room temperature. The activation of PDS only happened when the accommodation of ‘guest’ PDS into the interlayers of LDH occurred. The reactivity of PDS can be enhanced by the basic sites on the LDH laminate, which provide OH to weaken the S–O bond of the PDS molecule and initiated the activation. Meanwhile, the limiting spaces of the LDH interlayer also provided protection for PDS from cleavage of the S–O bond, which avoids the subsequent generation of radicals. Based on the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses, the mechanism of catalytic oxidation was shown to be a non-radical pathway (Fig. 17(a)). The PDS inside LDH with ‘‘elevated reactivity” played a role in the Elbs oxidation, in a moderate non-radical manner. No sulfate leakage was observed in solution because sulfate from the decay of PDS was kept in the layers of Mg–Al LDH.268 Furthermore, the same authors demonstrated that a part of the PDS in LDH-PDS was activated to provide the sulfate radical and activation energy of LDH-PDS was decreased drastically compared to that of PDS alone at 50 °C (Fig. 17(b)). The thermal activation of the PDS on LDH-PDS led to a combination of nonradical (direct redox oxidation) and radical processes of the PDS. This synergic effect of thermal activation was responsible for the high oxidation of phenolic compounds.269 In a very recent report, the combination of a nanosheet-like Prussian blue analogue (PBA) guest and a Mg–Al LDH host endowed the resulting PBA-LDH catalysts with 95.7% degradation efficiency for carbamazepine within 15 minutes of reaction time during the 6th cycle. PMS was activated by PBA in the interlayer space and SO4˙− played an indispensable role in carbamazepine degradation compared to OH˙. By taking advantage of the confined structure of LDH, the incorporation of PBA improved the catalytic performance of the catalysts.253

5. Conclusions and perspectives
A number of LDH based catalysts have been successfully fabricated and widely used in the field of water purification. Through a systematic survey of the literature, we have summarized the advances in LDH based materials for photocatalysis, Fenton reaction methods, and sulfate radical (SO4˙−)-mediated oxidations, aiming at shedding light on the origin of catalytic activity and providing design principles for highly efficient LDH catalysts. By controlling the types of transition metal ions, changing the compensating anions, controlling the morphology, and designing hybrid LDH/catalytic materials, LDH catalysts with superior physicochemical properties and synergistic effects and exhibiting enhanced catalytic activities toward AOPs were designed and fabricated. Looking ahead, the design and synthesis of low-cost and high-performance LDH based materials are urgently required to meet the increasing demand for reducing the input energy and the amounts of oxidants during AOPs. To realize this, several remaining issues have to be addressed in the future:
(i) Although more and more efficient visible-light driven LDH photocatalysts have been developed (as seen from Table 2), it is highly desirable to improve the harvesting ability for visible light and even near infrared light that accounts for more than 50% of solar irradiation. For the extended light-harvesting ability, future development of LDH could focus on the intercalation of brucite layers with polymers or organic cations, fabrication of bio-inspired hybrid materials, band gap adjustment, surface sensitization, etc. The combination of metal codoping or tridoping and heterojunction fabrication should be a feasible strategy. In addition, recent research studies have been heavily focused on the photodegradation of traditional dye pollutants (as seen from Table 2), which are more easily photodegraded. There is a lack of systematic study of photodegradation of emerging contaminants using LDH based photocatalysts. The systematic and deep fundamental study of these new synthesized composites and more robust permanent organic pollutants may provide a potential scope for future research. In addition, recent studies have concluded that semiconductor/layered double hydroxide composites exhibit remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen production capability,277–279 and these studies open up opportunities for photocatalytic reactors to simultaneously purify wastewater and convert solar energy into clean hydrogen energy.
(ii) Generally, the obtained information on degradation efficiency reported in this review revealed better results for SR-AOPs compared to the Fenton process. However, H2O2 is more economical than persulfate, making PS processes much more expensive. Fortunately, persulfate (PS) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) can also be activated by using irradiation and heat. Considering the availability of waste heat, the combination of LDH and heat-activation of PS is considered the most sustainable, environmentally friendly, and economically viable option to decrease the operational cost. Carbonaceous materials have been reported to be excellent activators for the activation of PS/PMS due to their porous structure, large surface area, metal-free nature and abundant functional groups. Biochar supported transition metal oxides have been successfully applied for PMS or PS activation.280–282 In a recent study, coupling biochar with LDH has typically been applied for enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of gemifloxacin antibiotic UV irradiation.283 The efficiency of the PMS/H2O2 system can be further enhanced by irradiation. There are many methods to prepare biochar/LDHs such as the sol–gel method, co-precipitation,284 or hydrothermal methods at high temperature.70 Among these methods, the co-precipitation process has been proven to be one of the most effective and economical. In addition, the biochar endowed the resulting biochar/LDHs with low heavy metal leaching properties.285–287 Alternatively, the fabrication and application of photoactive biochar/LDH catalysts in photocatalytic degradation, photo-activated Fenton or sulfate radical-advanced oxidation processes will allow the lowering of the amounts of the oxidant and make this process more economically effective.
(iii) Theoretical approaches and modeling methods are urgently needed to reveal the synergistic effects among the active sites of LDHs, the structure–property correlations, and especially the interactive mechanisms of LDHs, oxidants and water pollutants. DFT calculations are fascinating strategies to optimize the structures for catalytic activity and identify the roles of catalytic sites at different levels, which could facilitate the fabrication of high-performance LDHs. Yan and Wei have successfully applied a density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) theoretical and experimental combined method for screening possible LDH catalysts for photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water288,289 and revealing the mechanism and selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation on the surface of Ni–Ga LDH at the atomic level.290 In addition, Ulissi et al. provided a theoretical, fully automated screening method that consists of a combination of machine learning and optimization to guide DFT, which were then applied to screen effective electrocatalysts across 54 alloys for CO2 reduction and across 102 alloys for H2 evolution.291 Obviously, these studies can be extended to design and screen LDH catalysts for advanced oxidation processes.
(iv) The literature survey indicates that the co-precipitation method is the most frequently used method to prepare AOP catalysts. This synthesis method is simple and easy to scale up for industrial production. However, this synthetic approach suffers from poor crystallinity and impurity. Looking ahead, novel synthesis strategies and suitable support materials are still needed to fabricate the desired LDH catalysts. These include strategies to precisely control their chemical composition, defect degree, contact interface, crystallization, hierarchical assembly, size, atomic scale structure, zero metal leaching behavior, and morphology and prevent aggregation of the delaminated LDH nanosheets in solvents.
(v) Because of the layered structures, LDHs typically show a “platelet-like” morphology. Various kinds of LDHs with 3D structures (urchin-like,292 flower-like,293 and hollow sphere294–296), 2D structures (ultrathin nanosheets24) or 1D structures (belt-like297) have shown excellent performance in water remediation, because of their unique structure. In addition, shape-controlled Mn2O3 has presented high activity for activation of PMS,298 catalytic ozonation,299 and photodegradation.300 Although shape selective reaction on crystallite particles is an important issue in catalytic reactions, previous studies in the field of photocatalysis and sulfate radical (SO4˙−)-mediated oxidations focused exclusively on the use of LDHs with a regular hexagonal morphology. More efforts to apply 3D pristine LDH, core@shell, and yolk@shell LDH nanocomposites as catalysts should be encouraged.
(vi) Overall, there are promising results in removing organic contaminants via AOPs under laboratory conditions using LDH solids. While current studies have focused on the effect of a single parameter on catalytic efficiency, the relative contribution of these effects to the enhancement and overall efficacy of the AOP is far from understood, which is critical for the practical system. Moreover, heterogeneous catalysts still face difficulty in separation and recovery in open environmental systems. Development of new catalysts and operation techniques, for instance, novel magnetically separable catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts combined with fixed-bed reactors, ceramic membrane reactors and photocatalytic membrane reactors is recommended to facilitate widespread applicability of heterogeneous LDH catalysts for AOPs. Finally, from an economic perspective, studies on estimating the costs of applying LDH catalysts for various AOPs have been scarce, and more information would be desirable. Such endeavor is an obvious prerequisite for the application of AOPs. The comparison with individual treatment techniques should be mainly based on treatment efficiency and specific cost.

Chang Zhang	Chang Zhang received his PhD degree from Hunan University. He worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University. He is a professor and doctoral supervisor in Hunan University now. His research interests are in remediation of the water environment and water pollution control techniques.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the methods used in pollutant removal from water.	 

LDHs	(1) The composition, particle size, morphology, and surface defect structure, as well as the electronic properties of LDHs can be modulated by various synthetic strategies and exfoliation approaches, affording coordinatively unsaturated active sites (e.g., low-coordinated steps, edges, and/or corner atoms) which facilitate heterogeneous catalysis21,22
(2) Strong electrostatic interactions between layers and interlayer anions to offer an ordered arrangement of interlayer species and a tailorable orientation of active sites as well as the increase of structural stability23
(3) It remains challenging to overcome the poor conductivity, low electron and charge transfer ability and insufficient active edge sites, especially for the bulk form of LDHs23,24
MOFs	(1) MOFs with large surface area, ultrahigh porosity, and diversity of material design have been extensively used in heterogeneous catalysts25
(2) MOFs have some relatively inferior features in terms of stability, aggregation, consequent loss of dispersibility and iron leaching in the catalytic reaction11,26
(3) Efficiency of most MOFs is low due to their ability to conduct the reactions under UV irradiation11,27
(4) The organic linkers may potentially block the coordination sphere around the reactive metal sites, which is not beneficial to chemisorption of pollutants and the subsequent catalytic decomposition11
Perovskites	(1) Perovskites are highly stable and exhibit a high mobility of network oxygen with the possibility of forming vacancies and stabilizing unusual oxidation states of metals28,29
(2) The conductivity and surface area of perovskites are low and as a consequence, the interaction between the contaminants and the active sites is limited29,30
(3) The high combination rate of electron/hole pairs and the agglomeration of particles are some of the limitations of perovskites29
(4) The removal of pollutants in perovskite/PMS systems is very efficient, while the mineralization is somewhat less efficient29,31,32
