    , Accepted 24th September 2020First published on 25th September 2020AbstractA series of acceptors, S1–S5, has been designed based on the acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A) architecture by incorporating a phenothiazine unit as the central donor unit. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods have been employed to study the effect of various end-capped groups on the geometric, electronic, optical and charge transport properties of the designed acceptor molecules. The results reveal that on increasing the electron-withdrawing nature of the end-capped groups, the performance of the acceptor molecules increases. It is also observed that on increasing the flexibility of the end-capped groups, the planarity of the molecules gets destroyed and, as a result, the performance of the acceptor molecules decreases. The investigated molecules exhibit high electron affinity (EA) and low reorganization energy for electrons (λ−), indicating the electron acceptor nature of the designed molecules. The absorption properties of the molecules manifest that compounds S2–S4 possess high values of the maximum wavelength (λmax) of absorption. We have also studied the properties of a D/A active layer by considering PffBT4T-2OD as the electron donor and arranging PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 molecules in a face to face manner. Properties of the D/A blend indicate that molecules S2–S4 have capacity to promote charge carrier separation at the D/A active layer. Our results provide guidelines for further designing of acceptors to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs).
1 Introduction
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention as an environment-friendly technology for transforming solar energy into electrical energy. Compared to the inorganic materials, organic materials used in BHJ type organic solar cells have advantages of mechanical flexibility, easy synthesizability, light weight and low cost of production.1–7 BHJ devices consist of electron rich donor and electron deficient acceptor molecules. Earlier, fullerene derivatives such as PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester), PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), ICBA (indene-C60 bisadduct) etc. were most commonly used due to their high electron affinity and great electron transporting capacity.8–10
Over the past few decades, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fullerene-based OSCs has undergone an increase of up to 11.7%.8,11 Besides their high PCE, fullerene derivatives still possess some disadvantages such as their wide band gap, which results in weak absorption in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions of the solar spectrum, thermal and photochemical instability, high synthesizing cost, difficulty in the purification process, limited utility in high voltage sub-cells of tandem devices etc.12,13 To overcome these issues, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have been rapidly developed in the last ten years. Non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have tunable structures, appropriate energy levels, a broad range of absorption spectra, and low cost and easy methods of synthesis and purification.2,14–17
To obtain efficient OSCs, it is important to design high performance small molecule acceptors and to explore them with suitable donor materials. It was already reported that the electrical, structural and optical properties of both the donor and acceptor materials play a crucial role in determining the photovoltaic performance of devices.11,18 The PCE of single-junction OSCs has increased above 12% to date.19 To improve the PCE of OSCs, the design and synthesis of small molecule acceptors is beneficial. Presently, an A–π–D–π–A type of small molecule acceptor in which an electron-rich donor unit (D) is linked to two electron-deficient acceptor (A) groups via two π-bridges is one of the most hopeful molecule design strategies.20–22
The conversion of light energy to electrical energy in OSCs involves a series of steps. In the first step, a bound electron–hole pair (exciton) is generated via absorption of a photon by the donor material. The second step is the exciton diffusion step where the exciton formed diffuses to the donor–acceptor interface. In the third step, the exciton gets dissociated and the bound electron is transferred to the acceptor at the interface. In the final step, the free charges (i.e., well-separated electron and hole) are transported and collected at the respective electrodes.10,23
The structural properties, electronic energy levels, absorption properties, carrier mobility, solubility parameters etc. can be easily tuned by modifying the three parts, D, π and the A of the acceptor materials.21,22 The popular donor units used include fluorene, carbazole, indacenodithiophene etc. have a rigid coplanar structure.20,24,25 At the same time, malononitrile, 3-ethylrhodanine, dicyano-n-hexylrhodanine etc. and their derivatives have been used as the end-capped groups in the A–π–D–π–A type small acceptors.26–28 Suitable modification of the end-capped groups can lead to successful and efficient tuning of the absorption and energy levels, which in turn helps in the achievement of high performance of the OSCs.29
Herein, we have designed five A–π–D–π–A type small acceptor molecules, S1–S5, by choosing phenothiazine as the central donor (D) unit. Benzo-triazole, thiophene and ethylene groups have been used to extend the π-conjugation.30,31 3-methylrhodanine, 3-methyl thiazolidine-2,4-dithione, 1,1-dicyano-methylene-3-indanone, 1,1-dicyano-methylene-5,6-difluoro-3-indanone and 1-cyano-4-methyl-thiophene have been used as the end group acceptors. The sketches of the designed molecules (S1–S5) are provided in Fig. 1. In this work, our goal is twofold. Firstly, we try to tune the structure of small molecule acceptors so that the solar energy absorption by the OSCs is increased. Secondly, we further investigate the role of small molecule acceptors in the charge transfer process at the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. To fulfill this purpose, the geometric structures, electrical properties, optical properties and charge transfer processes have been studied using quantum chemical methods. Moreover, taking PffBT4T-2OD as the donor and S1–S5 as acceptors, the electron transport processes have been investigated.28

2 Computational details
All the calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 09 program package.32 The ground-state geometries of all the compounds S1–S5 have been optimized by employing the density functional theory (DFT) method. The coordinates of the optimized structures are provided in Table S1 (in the ESI†). The optimized structures have been confirmed to be at minimum-energy points by vibrational analysis. To validate the functionals used in our calculations, we have performed test calculations with the compound BAF-4CN reported in the literature as it has structural similarity with our designed compounds.20 The ground state calculations have been performed using the DFT method with the functionals B3LYP, PBEPBE, HSEH1PBE, MPW1PW91 and CAM-B3LYP and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.20,33–35 The excited state calculations have been performed with the time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) method using the functionals CAM-B3LYP, ωB97XD and M06-2X-D3 and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.20,36 The respective results are reported in Table S2 (in the ESI†). From Table S2 (ESI†), it was observed that for the ground state calculations, the results obtained using the HSEH1PBE functional are in agreement with the experimentally reported values. On the other hand, for the excited state calculations, the results obtained using the CAM-B3LYP and M06-2X-D3 functionals are in better agreement with the experimentally reported values. However, to keep the computational cost under control, we have performed the excited state calculations at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Solvent phase calculations have also been carried out using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) using chloroform as the solvent.37 Cationic state optimization, and calculation of neutral and cationic energy, ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and reorganization energy (λ) values have been performed at the same level of theory. Electronic coupling matrix element (V) values have been calculated at the M06-2X-D3/6-31G(d,p) level as it includes the dispersion correction and can be used to study the charge transfer properties.20 However, the calculation of exciton binding energy (Eb) and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) has been performed at the HSEH1PBE/6-31G(d,p) level of theory.
3 Theoretical methodology
The performance of a photovoltaic device is dependent on the stability of holes and electrons and the energy barrier of the charge injection process. Many studies have reported the effect of the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), IP and EA of the molecules on the charge injection and transportation properties. Herein, we have calculated both the IP and EA in two different ways: (i) vertical (denoted as v) and (ii) adiabatic (denoted as a). The vertical and adiabatic IP and EA can be calculated using the following equations:33,34,38 IP(v) = E+(M0) − E0(M0),(1) IP(a) = E+(M+) − E0(M0),(2) EA(v) = E0(M0) − E−(M0),(3) EA(a) = E0(M0) − E−(M−),(4)where E+, E− and E0 are the energies of the molecules in the cationic, anionic and neutral states, respectively, and M+, M− and M0 represent the cationic, anionic and neutral geometries of the molecules, respectively.
The reorganization energy (λ) usually has two contributions, the inner sphere and the outer sphere. The outer sphere reorganization energy arises from the relaxation of nuclei/electrons or polarization of the surrounding medium. The inner sphere reorganization energy arises from the geometry relaxation process when a charge is released or accepted by the molecule.33,34 In this work, we have taken into account only the inner sphere contribution.
The reorganization energy values for holes (λ+) and electrons (λ−) are calculated using eqn (5) and (6):33,39–44 λ+ = [E+(M0) − E+(M+)] + [E0(M+) − E0(M0)],(5) λ− = [E0(M−) − E0(M0)] + [E−(M0) − E−(M−)].(6)
The charge transfer rate (kCT) between two adjacent molecules can be described by Marcus theory. The relevant expression for kCT when there is no barrier can be given by eqn (7):33,36,41,43–46 (7)where T is the temperature on the absolute scale, V is the electronic coupling matrix element between two species, kB is the Boltzmann constant and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.
The electronic coupling matrix element for holes (V+) and for electrons (V−) between two adjacent species (also called the charge transfer integral) is calculated using eqn (8):33,36,45,47 (8)where EH, EH−1, EL, and EL+1 are the energies of the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1, respectively, from the closed-shell configuration of the neutral state of the oligomers. V values need to be larger for efficient charge transfer and depend on the orbital overlap between two species.40–42,48,49 From the value of charge transfer rate, we can estimate the value of hopping mobility (μhop) with the help of the Einstein equation using eqn (9):34,39,43,50 (9)where e denotes the charge of electron and D is the diffusion coefficient. In a one dimensional system, D and kCT are related by D = kCTd2/2, where d represents the space distance between two interacting molecules.
4 Results and discussion
4.1 Ground state molecular structure

4.1.1 Dihedral angles. 
The optoelectronic properties of a molecule have a close relation with its ground state geometry. The representation of dihedral angles (ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3) in a compound is provided in Fig. 2. The obtained values of dihedral angles of the studied compounds are reported in Table 1. From this table, it was observed that the dihedral angle values of the compounds S1–S5 are in the range of 0°–30°. This indicates that these molecules will have non-planar geometry that can reduce self-aggregation and hence can lead to stabilization of the molecules.20,51

From Table 1, it was also observed that the values of dihedral angles ϕ1 and ϕ3 are maximum for compound S5 in the gas phase. This can be explained in terms of the distance between the acceptor unit and the π-bridging unit. In the other four molecules (i.e., S1–S4), the acceptor unit is attached to the π-bridging unit directly. However, in the case of compound S5, the acceptor unit is separated from the π-bridging unit by one –CH unit. This increase in distance between the acceptor unit and the π-bridging unit augments the flexibility of the molecule, which in turn increases the dihedral angles ϕ1 and ϕ3. ϕ2 values for all the molecules except S5 follow a similar trend as in the gas phase, i.e., with an increase in size of the acceptor unit, the dihedral angle ϕ2 also increases. In the case of S5, although the acceptor unit is comparatively smaller due to the flexibility of the molecule as stated above, ϕ2 becomes relatively larger. Compound S4 possesses the highest value of ϕ2 in the gas phase because of the large size of the acceptor unit. However, compound S5 exhibits the maximum ϕ3 values in both phases due to the increased flexibility offered by the –CH unit.


4.1.2 Inter unit bond lengths. 
The representation of inter unit bond lengths (L1, L2, and L3) in a compound is provided in Fig. 2 and the obtained values are reported in Table 2. From this table, it was observed that the bond lengths are in the range of 1.35–1.47 Å, being shorter than a C–C single bond distance (1.54 Å) and longer than a CC double bond distance (1.33 Å). This reveals that the selected bonds tend to lie between the C–C single bond and CC double bond. This clearly indicates the presence of conjugation in the studied compounds.

4.1.3 Distortion energy. 
We have calculated the distortion energy (ΔEdis) of the studied molecules. ΔEdis is defined as the energy required to planarize the molecules from their torsional state. To calculate ΔEdis, the dihedral angles of the ground state-optimized molecules have been adjusted to zero and single point energy calculations have been performed on the constrained geometry. The energy difference between the optimized structure and the planar geometry leads to the estimation of ΔEdis.6,35 The calculated ΔEdis values of the molecules are provided in Table 3.

From Table 3, it was observed that the ΔEdis values of all the molecules are close to 2 kcal mol−1. The lowest value of ΔEdis is found for compound S1. This can be attributed to the observed lowest value of dihedral angle ϕ2 and relatively low values of ϕ1 and ϕ3 of this compound. The highest value of ΔEdis is found for compound S5. This is due to the highest value of dihedral angles ϕ1, ϕ2 and ϕ3 of this compound. The ΔEdis values of the compounds follow the same trend both in the gas and solvent phases.


4.1.4 Bond length alteration (BLA) parameter (Δr). 
To establish a relationship between geometric structure and electronic properties, we have calculated the bond length alteration (BLA) parameter (Δr) values of the compounds. The Δr value is related to the transport properties, linear–nonlinear polarizabilities, and photon absorption characteristics of organic molecules. BLA can be defined as the difference between the average C–C double and C–C single bonds of conjugated systems.6,34 Lower values of Δr indicate the presence of a greater extent of conjugation in the compounds. The calculated values of Δr are provided in Fig. 3. From this figure, it was observed that compounds S3 and S1 possess the lowest and highest values of Δr, respectively. This indicates that the extent of conjugation present is maximum and minimum in compounds S3 and S1, respectively.

4.2 Electronic properties

4.2.1 Frontier molecular orbitals and density of states. 
The energies of the HOMO and LUMO and their difference (ΔH–L values) are important parameters that markedly affect the electronic properties, carrier transport properties and optical absorption. The energies of the HOMO and LUMO and ΔH–L of the studied compounds are reported in Table 4. From this table, it was observed that ΔH–L values of the studied compounds are found to be in the range from 1.50 eV to 2.10 eV, which lies within the reported values (1–4 eV) of ΔH–L required for OSCs.34 This indicates that our compounds are suitable for OSCs. The observed ΔH–L values follow the order S5 > S1 > S2 > S3 > S4. This trend can be explained with the observed trend in the LUMO energy levels of the compounds. The LUMO energy levels of the compounds follow the order S5 > S1 > S2 > S3 > S4. The LUMO energy of a molecule depends on the strength of the attached electron-withdrawing units in the molecule. Among the acceptor units, the electron-withdrawing capacity is maximum for compounds S3 and S4 due to the attached carbonyl and dicyano groups, respectively. Owing to this, these two molecules possess lower LUMO energy values. Furthermore, the acceptor unit of the S4 molecule has been substituted with fluorine, which further increases the electron-withdrawing capacity of the end-capped unit. Therefore, it is obvious that the ΔH–L value decreases with the decrease in the LUMO energy level. The ΔH–L values in the solvent phase follow the same trend as in the gas phase. The energy values of the HOMO and LUMO and ΔH–L are plotted in Fig. 4.

 Fig. 4  The calculated energies of frontier molecular orbitals and ΔH–L values of compounds S1–S5 (a) in the gas phase and (b) in the solvent phase. 
It has been reported that to improve the PCE of OSCs, it is necessary to have a low EL+1 − ELUMO value of the electron-accepting material.20 We have provided the energies of the LUMO+1 level and ELUMO+1 − ELUMO values of all the studied compounds in Table 4. It has been observed from Table 4 that compounds S3 and S4 exhibit comparatively low ELUMO+1 − ELUMO values among the compounds in both phases. Hence, both S3 and S4 have the potential to act as more promising acceptors.
The distribution pattern of frontier molecular orbitals provides a detailed understanding of the structure–energy level relationship of the molecules. We have provided a plot of the frontier molecular orbitals of the studied molecules in Fig. 5. As displayed in the figure, the HOMOs are delocalized over the entire π-conjugated backbone and the LUMOs are concentrated on the acceptor part.
 Fig. 5  Plot ofs frontier molecular orbitals of the studied molecules along with the contributions of the end groups. 
The density of states (DOS) can be defined as the number of different states at a particular energy level available for electrons. The partial density of states (PDOS) signifies the relative contribution of a particular orbital or atom to the total DOS.52–55 For a comparative study of electronic properties with the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), we have calculated the partial density of states (PDOS) of the studied compounds and the same is plotted in Fig. 6. The plots of frontier molecular orbitals of the studied compounds along with the contribution of the end-capped groups to the HOMO/LUMO are presented in Fig. 5. From this figure, it was observed that replacement of the oxygen atom of the end group of compound S1 with the less electron-withdrawing sulphur atom in S2 increases the contribution of the end group to both the HOMO and LUMO. Similarly, the presence of an electron-withdrawing F atom in the end group of compound S4 increases its contribution toward the LUMO (compared to S3) but decreases that toward the HOMO (compared to S3). On the other hand, attachment of 1-cyano-4-methyl-thiophene as the end group in compound S5 decreases its contribution towards both the HOMO and LUMO among the studied compounds. From the above discussion, it is clear that except compound S5, in all the studied compounds (S1, S2, S3 and S4), the end groups offer a significant contribution to their LUMO. Thus, we can conclude that except for compound S5, the studied compounds are suitable for use as acceptor molecules in OSCs.

4.2.2 Molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) of the compounds. 
Molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) plots are used as a tool to acquire information about the charge transfer process from the donor site to the acceptor site in the excited state.6,56,57 The MEPS plots of the studied compounds in their excited state are presented in Fig. 7. From this figure, it was observed that a positive charge is spread over the central donor unit and a negative charge is spread over the end-capped acceptor groups. Thus, it can be said that charge transportation occurs in our designed compounds upon electronic excitation.

4.2.3 Effect of solvent on the dipole moment (μ). 
The calculated dipole moment (μ) values of the compounds are reported in Table 5. From this table, it was observed that the excited state dipole moment (μe) values are lower than the corresponding ground state dipole moment (μg) values except that of compound S2. For compound S2, μe values are higher than the μg values in the solvent phase. It was also observed that μ values in the solvent phase are higher than in the gas phase except that of compound S2. These values indicate that except for compound S2, our designed compounds are more polar in the ground state and will be stabilized by the polar environment.

From this table, it was observed that the IP values of the compounds increase with an increase in the electron-withdrawing capacity of the attached electron-accepting units. This can be explained by the fact that electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the HOMO energy level, which in turn makes it difficult to remove an electron from the molecule. Similarly, EA values also increase with an increase in the electron-withdrawing capacity of the attached acceptor units. This is because of the stabilization of the LUMO energy levels by the electron-withdrawing groups of the molecules. Generally, the higher the EA value of the molecule, the easier the electron-abstraction from the donor by the acceptor molecule. Therefore, for a molecule to act as a good acceptor for OSCs, the EA value must be high. We have also observed here that compound S4 possesses the highest values of IP and EA in both phases. This is due to the observed values of the low lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels of this compound. On the other hand, compound S5 possesses the lowest values of both IP and EA in both phases. This is because of the observed highest values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of this compound.


4.2.5 Intermolecular electron transport properties of the acceptors. 
The reorganization energy (λ) is defined as the energy difference between the charged and neutral systems of two different geometries.25,39,40 We have calculated the values of λ for both the electron (λ−) and hole (λ+) for all the studied molecules and the values are presented in Table 7. From this table, it was observed that for all molecules, the λ− values are smaller than the λ+ values. This indicates that the energy requirement for the electron transfer process is lower than that for the hole transfer process for the molecules. This confirms the electron accepting nature of the studied molecules. Among the studied molecules, S3 possesses the lowest and S1 possesses the highest λ− value. This can be attributed to the observed lowest and highest values of Δr of the compounds, respectively (Fig. 3). The lower value of Δr in compound S3 indicates a higher extent of conjugation present in it and as a result S3 exhibits a lower λ− value. Conversely, the higher value of Δr in compound S1 indicates the presence of a lower extent of conjugation in it, which in turn results in its high value of λ−.

To gauge the values of the electronic coupling matrix element for electron (V−) in different orientations, we have considered both π-stacking and shifted π-stacking orientations. The optimized structures of the compounds in these two orientations are provided in Fig. S1 and S2 (in the ESI†). The calculated V− values in the π-stacked and shifted π-stacked orientations are provided in Table 7. From this table, it was observed that the V− values in the π-stacked orientation are higher than the values in the shifted π-stacked orientation. Therefore, we have considered the π-stacked orientation for the calculation of charge transfer rate.
We have also calculated the values of electron transfer rate (kCT−) of the compounds using eqn (7), and the corresponding values are presented in Table 7. From Table 7, it was observed that compound S3 possesses the highest value of kCT−. This is due to the observed lowest and highest values of λ− and V− of this compound, respectively. Conversely, compound S1 possesses the lowest value of kCT−. This can be attributed to the observed highest value of λ−. We have also calculated the values of hopping mobility for electron (μhop−) (eqn (9)) and the same are provided in Table 7. The space distance (d) between two molecules is represented in Fig. S3 (in the ESI†). It is already known that an increased hopping mobility signifies an increased charge carrier mobility.34 From Table 7, it was observed that compounds S3 and S1 possess the highest and lowest values of μhop−, respectively. This is because of the observed highest and lowest kCT− values of compounds S3 and S1, respectively. Thus, we can conclude that compound S3 will be a more promising candidate for OSCs.

It is well known that the absorption spectrum of a molecule strongly depends on the nature of the attached substituents.20 From Table 8, it was observed that a strong electron-withdrawing end-capped acceptor unit with extended conjugation results in a red shift of λmax values. Among the studied compounds, compounds S2 and S5 possess the maximum and minimum values of λmax, respectively. The λmax values of the molecules follow the trend S5 < S1 < S3 < S4 < S2. The above trend can be explained with the help of the observed ΔH–L values of the compounds. The ΔH–L values of the compounds follow the trend S5 > S1 > S2 > S3 > S4. The anomalous behavior of S2 can be explained in terms of BLA parameters of the compounds. Compound S2 possesses a lower value of Δr than that of S4, indicating that S2 possesses a greater extent of conjugation compared to that of S4, which leads to a higher value of λmax in compound S2. The UV-visible spectra of the studied compounds are provided in Fig. 8.

4.4 Effect of solvent on spectral absorption properties
To examine the effect of various solvents on the absorption properties of the designed molecules, we have used the polar protic solvent ethanol, polar aprotic solvent dichloro methane (DCM) and non-polar solvent chloroform. The calculated absorption parameters of the designed molecules using different solvents are reported in Table 9. If we compare Tables 8 and 9, it can be observed that the λmax values of the compounds increase in the solvent phase compared to those of gas phase. Moreover, it was observed that in chloroform and DCM solvents, our studied compounds exhibit similar λmax values. However, in ethanol solvent, the compounds exhibit lower λmax values than those in chloroform and DCM solvents. The UV-visible spectra of the studied compounds obtained in the solvent chloroform are provided in Fig. 8. The UV-visible spectra of the compounds obtained using the solvents ethanol and DCM are provided in Fig. S4 (in the ESI†).

4.5 Spectral absorption properties of the dimers
In OSCs, the acceptors form thin films. Therefore, we have studied the optical absorption properties of the dimers to investigate the effect of film formation on the absorption properties of the molecules. The calculated values of the absorption parameters are reported in Table 10. From this table, it was observed that the λmax values of the compounds increased upon dimerization. It was also observed that the λmax values for the dimers follow the same trend as the monomeric compounds. The UV-visible spectra of the dimers are provided in Fig. 9.

5 Properties of the D/A active layers
5.1 Exciton binding energy
The working mechanism of the OSCs is such that the acceptor molecule absorbs sunlight to produce the exciton, which splits only after reaching the D/A interface. However, the splitting of the exciton into free charged particles at the D/A interface must overcome the exciton binding energy (Eb).20,58Eb can be described as Eb = ΔH–L − E1, where E1 is the optical band gap, i.e. the energy required for the S0 → S1 transition. We have provided the respective values of ΔH–L, E1 and Eb in Table 11.

It is already reported that the Eb values for organic semiconductors vary from 0.2 eV to 1 eV.59 However, it is also reported that a lower value of Eb facilitates dissociation of excitons into free charges.60 From Table 11, it was observed that for all compounds, the Eb values are in the reported range. Moreover, it was observed that compared to compounds S1 and S5, S2–S4 have lower Eb values. This implies that exciton dissociation is more favourable in compounds S2–S4.
Upon illumination of light of a suitable wavelength, the ground state electron of the donor gets excited. Transfer of this excited electron to the acceptor takes place spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) becomes negative. The electron–hole pair gets dissociated into free charges at the D/A interface and they spread into the acceptor. Simultaneously, the electron and hole should be collected by the respective electrodes. The change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) can be calculated from the Rehm–Weller equation as follows:58 ΔG = IP(D) − EA(A) − E1 − Eb(10)where IP(D) represents the ionization potential of the donor and EA(A) represents the electron affinity of the acceptor, which are considered to be the negative of the HOMO and LUMO energies of the donor and acceptor, respectively. E1 is the first excitation energy of the donor.58 The calculated ΔG values of the studied compounds are reported in Table 11. From Table 11, it was observed that for all the designed acceptors, the obtained ΔG values are negative. This implies that the excited electron of the donor can spontaneously transfer to the acceptor molecule. However, compared to the acceptors S1 and S5, S2–S4 have lower ΔG values, which indicates that exciton dissociation is more favourable in compounds S2–S4.
5.2 Absorption properties of the D/A blends
Proper arrangement of the D/A blends plays a pivotal role in converting light to electricity in OSCs.20 Here, we have arranged the PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 molecules in a face to face orientation to provide large intermolecular electronic coupling.61 The initial distance between the centre of the donor and acceptor has been set as 3.5 Å. The optimized structures of the PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 complexes are provided in Fig. S5 (in the ESI†). The absorption properties of the PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 complexes have been studied in the gas phase using the functional CAM-B3LYP. The spectral data of the studied compounds are provided in Table 12. Comparing Tables 8 and 12, it was observed that except the complex PffBT4T-2OD/S5, all the D/A active blends exhibit a red shift compared to the isolated acceptor molecules. Moreover, it was observed that the λmax values of the D/A compounds follow the same trend a that of the values of the isolated acceptor molecules. This proves that absorption properties of the acceptor molecules directly affect the absorption properties of the D/A active blends. The absorption spectra of the PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 complexes are plotted in Fig. 10.

6 Conclusions
In this work, we have designed five new A–π–D–π–A type conjugated molecules, S1–S5, to explore more efficient acceptor materials for organic solar cells by incorporating phenothiazine as the central donor unit and changing the end-capped acceptor units. To illustrate the structural and electronic properties, we have calculated the dihedral angles, inter unit bond length, distortion energy, BLA parameters, the HOMO and LUMO energies, ΔH–L values, absorption properties etc. We have also estimated the properties of D/A blends after combining the designed acceptor molecules with the reference donor PffBT4T-2OD to monitor the electron injection process from the donor to the acceptor molecules.
To envisage the effect of the end-capped acceptor unit in an A–π–D–π–A type acceptor molecule, we have modified the acceptor unit of the molecule with various electron-withdrawing groups. We have also analyzed the effect of fluorination on the end-capped group. We have observed that with an increase in electron-withdrawing effect of the end-capped groups, dihedral angle, Δr and ΔH–L values get decreased. From the study of absorption properties, it was observed that compounds S2–S4 possess high λmax values. We have also studied the effect of polar and non-polar solvents on the absorption properties of the molecules and observed that λmax values get red shifted in the solvent phase. It was also observed that when increasing the flexibility of the end-capped groups, the performance of the molecules decreased. This was observed in the case of compound S5. Owing to the presence of higher flexibility of the end-capped group, this molecule exhibits the maximum ΔH–L and distortion energy and the lowest λmax value. This indicates that S5 is not a good option for using as an acceptor in OSCs.
From the properties of the PffBT4T-2OD/S1–S5 blends, it was observed that compounds S2–S4 have the ability to promote charge carrier separation at the D/A interface. Thus, it can be concluded that compounds S2–S4 can be used as promising acceptors to improve the efficiency of OSCs. Moreover, it can be concluded that by modifiying the end-capped groups with strong electron-withdrawing units, the optoelectronic properties of the acceptor molecules can be better tuned.
