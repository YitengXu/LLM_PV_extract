When sputter-deposited Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were annealed at 400 °C under a N2 gas atmosphere, they were transformed into single layers composed of Bi–Sb–Te films. At the same time, they were spontaneously stripped on a large scale from the substrates (1 cm × 1 cm) without chemical etching. The as-fabricated free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films were very flexible, with a thickness of about 400 nm. The findings confirmed that the formation of voids and the strong flow rate of ambient gas play important roles in fabricating free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films during the thermal annealing process. The temperature-dependent crystallization behaviors of each of the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 films were also investigated to understand the mechanism. Moreover, the thermoelectric properties of the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films were examined with different thicknesses of the films. We believe that this method can contribute to the development of low-dimensional nanostructures that can be useful in various applications such as energy conversion, energy storage and wearable electronics.
Introduction
Free-standing films, pure membranes or nanocomposites with a high surface area have been used for a variety of applications such as Li-ion batteries,1–4 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),5 solid-oxide fuel cells,6 solar cells,7 displays,8 supercapacitors9 and thermoelectric devices.10,11 While the miniaturization and integration of electric devices have been gradually developed, the global demand for wearable electronics is abruptly increased. For example, low-temperature thermoelectric materials, such as Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3, that are incorporated into a flexible fabric are able to show good thermoelectric performance as self-powered generators in wearable electronics using body heat as an energy source.12 Thermoelectric devices, which are a representative environmentally friendly technology, can directly convert thermal energy into electrical energy, thus allowing waste heat to be used more efficiently. The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric performance is expressed by a dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, where ZT = α2Tσ/κ (α, Seebeck coefficient; T, absolute temperature; σ, electrical conductivity; κ, thermal conductivity). Te-based chalcogenides such as Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3 and Bi–Sb–Te have been widely used as thermoelectric materials. Among them, Bi–Sb–Te is the best candidate for thermoelectric devices that operate near room temperature.13,14 The highest ZT reported for Bi–Sb–Te was about 1.4 at 100 °C.13 It has been also examined for use in topological insulators recently.15
In this study, we report a simplified method for the fabrication of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films via thermal annealing of Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films. To fabricate free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films, Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were used as starting materials. They were transformed into Bi–Sb–Te single layers upon annealing at a temperature of 400 °C. Moreover, they were spontaneously detached from the substrates. In general, sacrificial layers have been used to fabricate free-standing films, since they can be removed by chemical etching. Chemical solutions such as hydrogen fluoride (HF),16 DI water,3 potassium hydroxide (KOH),5etc. have mainly been used to separate films and substrates through complicated steps. In the method reported here, however, no chemical etching was used and two simple steps (deposition and thermal annealing) were needed to produce free-standing films. It is interesting to note that as-deposited Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were prepared by direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering. Because it is known that sputter-deposited films adhere well to their substrates.17 Based on the results of experimental analyses, we proposed a comprehensive mechanism that takes both the spontaneous peel-off of sputter-deposited films from substrates and the formation of Bi–Sb–Te single layers into consideration. In addition, the thermoelectric properties of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films were examined.
Experimental
Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 films were deposited on substrates using a dc magnetron sputtering system. The thickness of each layer was about 200 nm, as determined by a surface profiler (Alpha-Step). The deposition was carried out at room temperature. Glass and a Si (100) wafer were used as substrates. During deposition, the base and working pressures were adjusted to ~5 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−3 Torr, respectively. The dc power applied to the Sb2Te3 (99.999%) and Bi2Te3 (99.999%) targets was fixed at 20 W. The compositions of each as-deposited film were measured by quantitative analysis using an electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EMPA, EPMA 1600/Shimadzu). The results indicated that the atomic ratio of each film was approximately 2:3 (Sb41.3Te58.7 and Bi46.8Te53.2). After deposition, the films were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm pieces and annealed at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to ~400 °C for 10 min in a tube furnace (Blue M/Lindberg). During annealing, the flow rate of N2 gas (99.999%) was fixed at 200 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute). After the annealing process, the furnace was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. Samples were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/MAX Rint 2000/Rigaku), an atomic force microscope (AFM, JSPM-5200/JEOL), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM-7001F/JEOL), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2100F/JEOL) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). To measure the thermoelectric properties, the as-fabricated free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films were carefully detached using tweezers and transferred to a glass substrate. To fix the films, ethanol (99.9%) or diluted water was sprayed on film/glass and the samples were then dried for more than 1 day in air. The as-prepared samples were measured by temperature differential and four-probe methods using commercial equipment (RZ2000li, Ozawa Science Co.) under an Ar atmosphere in the temperature range from room temperature to 330 °C.18
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the photograph of Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films prepared at different annealing temperatures. Morphological changes cannot readily be seen by the naked eye at temperatures of up to 300 °C. However, some exfoliation was detected at the edge of the sample that was annealed at 350 °C (yellow arrows in Fig. 1(a)). When Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were annealed at temperatures above 400 °C, they were spontaneously separated from the substrates (Fig. 1(b)). The as-exfoliated films were very flexible and detached easily from the substrates when grasped with tweezers, maintaining their original form (a size of about 1 cm × 1 cm). The whole process was recorded using a digital video recorder (Fig. 1(b) and Supporting Movie M1, ESI†).

Fig. 2(a) shows the cross-sectional FESEM images of Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films prepared at different annealing temperatures. A straight interface between the Sb2Te3 (bottom) and Bi2Te3 (top) layers can be clearly observed in the Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films annealed at ~150 °C. Upon annealing at 300 °C, several porous sites were observed in the films, especially concentrated on the Sb2Te3 layer. Moreover, it was difficult to distinguish the interface between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 layers, indicating that atomic interdiffusion occurred between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 layers. It is known that Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 consist of solid-solution alloys in the range of 0–100 wt% and have the same crystal structures, i.e. quintuple layers (Te–Sb(Bi)–Te–Sb(Bi)–Te) perpendicular to the c-axis of the rhombohedral crystal (Fig. 2(b)).19–21 Furthermore, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 have anti-sites (SbTe or BiTe) where Sb or Bi atoms occupy the Te sites. The formation energies of anti-site defects in Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 were determined to be 0.40 eV and 0.35 eV, respectively.22 Hence, it is possible that Bi–Sb–Te alloys were formed due to these characteristics during thermal annealing.

Fig. 3 presents the TEM, FESEM and XRD analyses of the Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer film annealed at 400 °C. As shown in the cross-sectional FESEM image, its morphology was very rough (inset of Fig. 3(a)). The interface between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 layers was completely indistinguishable, compared with samples that had been annealed at ~300 °C. This indicates that the Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were transformed into Bi–Sb–Te single layers. The TEM image shows that the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te film was polycrystalline and some grain with a hexagonal structure was surrounded by amorphous layers (Fig. 3(a)). A composition analysis was carried out using an EDS attached to the TEM equipment. The average atomic percent values for the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te film were 43.6 at% Bi, 11.8 at% Sb and 39.9 at% Te with traces of oxygen. An XRD pattern of the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films is shown in Fig. 3(b). The inset is an expanded area for the (015) peaks of Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films annealed as a function of temperature (~400 °C). When the annealing temperature was increased, the position of the (015) peaks gradually shifted toward that of Bi2Te3 (27.663°, JCPDS no. 15-0863) and not that of Sb2Te3 (28.244°, JCPDS no. 15-0874). The unit cell volume of the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te film was calculated to identify the influence of the rearrangement among atoms. The lattice parameters were determined by the (015) and (1010) peaks of the XRD patterns using the following equation:23

As a result, the calculated lattice parameters were a = 3.7435 Å and c = 30.4793 Å and the unit cell volume was 369.8950 Å3. These findings indicate that the unit cell volume of the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te film was much smaller than that of pure Bi2Te3 (JCPDS no. 15-0863, 507.63 Å3). When Sb atoms occupy the empty site of Bi atoms through solid-state reactions between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 layers, the lattice parameters can be decreased because the atomic radius (1.45 Å) of Sb is smaller than that (1.60 Å) of Bi.24 We were able to confirm that the crystal phase of the free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films is a Bi2Te3-rich alloy, based on FESEM, TEM and XRD data.
In the above section, we discussed the transformation from Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films to Bi–Sb–Te single layers with elevating temperature. If so, what is the driving force responsible for detaching them from substrates without chemical etching? To understand the mechanism, the structural changes undergone by each of the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 films with different annealing temperatures were investigated (Fig. 4). The films were a single layer with a thickness of approximately 400 nm. When the annealing temperature was increased, the intensities of the (015) peaks gradually increased in the XRD patterns of the Bi2Te3 films (Fig. 4(a)). They were much more intense than the other peaks. This indicates that the (015) plane was preferentially grown during thermal annealing. In the case of the Sb2Te3 films, however, no preferred growth of the (015) crystal plane was detected, similar to Bi2Te3 films, and crystallization was more extensive compared with that of an as-deposited film. In addition, Te peaks (JCPDS no. 36-1452) were detected in the XRD patterns of Sb2Te3 films that had been annealed at 300 °C (Fig. 4(b)), which were not observed in the case of the Bi2Te3 film. Te segregation has been observed in sputter-deposited pure and doped Sb2Te3 thin films,25,26 which may be due to the high mobility of Te.27

This temperature-dependent structural change in the films can affect their electrical properties. The average sheet resistances of Sb2Te3 films at different temperatures were as follows: 4609.6 Ω □−1 (as-deposited), 2321.2 Ω □−1 (100), 265.6 Ω □−1 (150) and 85.5 Ω □−1 (300). They decreased abruptly at 150 °C and the gap was over one order of magnitude. Meanwhile, the average sheet resistances of the Bi2Te3 films were slightly increased:28 352.1 Ω □−1 (as-deposited), 395.8 Ω □−1 (100), 439.6 Ω □−1 (150) and 512.1 Ω □−1 (300). The difference in crystallization behaviors between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 films was also observed through their morphological changes (insets of Fig. 3(a and b)). The root mean square surface roughness (Rq) values of Bi2Te3 thin films prepared at different annealing temperatures were essentially unchanged: 5.49 (as-deposited), 5.66 (150 °C) and 5.44 nm (300 °C). Similar to Bi2Te3 films, little change in Rq was observed for the Sb2Te3 films annealed at ~150 °C: 5.03 (as-deposited) and 5.00 nm (150 °C). When a Sb2Te3 film was annealed at 300 °C, however, the roughness increased abruptly to 10.5 nm because of the abrupt growth of polycrystals. These structural, electrical and morphological results show that the Sb2Te3 films transformed from an amorphous to a crystalline state by thermal energy.29–31 We conclude that the crystallization behaviors of Sb2Te3 films, phase transition and Te segregation, reported herein, may play a key role in the spontaneous formation of free-standing films. Because Te segregation can weaken the adhesion between films and substrates during phase transition by the formation of voids.27,32 Moreover, the as-deposited Sb2Te3 films are close to the amorphous state. When the annealing temperature is increased, the unbonded atoms in the Sb2Te3 films, hence, may relatively easily move through defects such as vacancies compared with those in the Bi2Te3 films. Hence, in Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films, voids were mostly formed in the Sb2Te3 layer in Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films that had been annealed at ~300 °C (Fig. 2(a)).
However, the weakness of adhesion cannot fully explain the exfoliation of layers from substrates. In mono- or multi-layer films, thermal stress is dependent on the annealing temperature due to the mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) between the film and the substrate (or the film).33 However, it is hard to explain the formation of free-standing films based on thermal stress because atomic diffusion and transformation into Bi–Sb–Te alloys occurred with elevating temperatures. Hence, we conclude that there is another important factor responsible for the exfoliation of such films. When the flow rate of N2 gas was 50 sccm, we observed that exfoliation was incomplete (Fig. 5(a)). The flow rate of N2 gas needed to be greater than 100 sccm for free-standing films to be formed during thermal annealing. This indicates that the flow rate of the ambient gas is a critical factor for exfoliation of films. Similarly, Ali et al. reported that free-standing TiO2 nanotube membranes were fabricated when the materials were wet with methanol and exposed to a stream of N2.34 When the annealing temperature was increased, voids were formed, mainly in the Sb2Te3 layer due to solid-state reactions and the unique crystallization behavior of the material. The adhesion between the Sb2Te3 layer and the substrate is weakened due to the formation of voids and the strong flow of N2 gas can completely separate them. When Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 multilayer films were examined under the same annealing conditions as those for the Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films, no exfoliation was observed (Fig. S1†). This supports our hypothesis regarding the mechanism responsible for the formation of free-standing films. Based on our experimental results, the mechanism for the formation of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5(b).

We compared the thermoelectric properties of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films of different thicknesses (approximately 400 nm and 2 μm), as shown in Fig. 6. When the thickness of the free-standing films increased, the electrical conductivity of the films increased. The electrical properties of polycrystalline thin films are influenced by the scattering of charge carriers at the surface and grain boundary, which can induce a decrease in the mean free path of charge carriers.35,36 All of the Seebeck coefficients had negative values, indicating that the samples were n-type; namely, the majority of charge carriers were electrons. It is known that Bi2Te3-rich alloys in the Sb2Te3–Bi2Te3 solid solution system showed n-type conduction,37,38 which is consistent with XRD analyses (Fig. 3(b)). The power factor therefore was increased from 68.3 μW K−2 m−1 to 493.0 μW K−2 m−1 at room temperature. Although we need to optimize the fabrication process for the enhancement of thermoelectric properties, this facile method shows potential for the development of free-standing films in thermoelectric applications.

Conclusions
We report herein the spontaneous formation of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films from sputter-deposited Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films using a thermal annealing process. When Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films were annealed at a temperature of 400 °C, they became detached from the substrates. They were transformed into Bi–Sb–Te single layers at the annealing temperature of 400 °C. On the basis of the different crystallization behaviors of the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 thin films, we conclude that phase transition and the segregation of Te in the sputter-deposited Sb2Te3 layer can induce the formation of several voids in the films with the solid-state reaction between the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 layers in Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 multilayer films. This can weaken the adhesion between films and substrates during thermal annealing. The findings also verify that the strong flow rate (above 100 sccm) of the ambient N2 gas can completely detach the Bi–Sb–Te films from the substrates. The power factors of free-standing Bi–Sb–Te films with thicknesses of 400 nm and 2 μm were 68.3 μW K−2 m−1 and 493.0 μW K−2 m−1, respectively.
