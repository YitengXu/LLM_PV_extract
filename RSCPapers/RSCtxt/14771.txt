ChinaReceived 23rd August 2012, Accepted 21st November 2012First published on 22nd November 2012AbstractZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 p–n heterostructure nanorod arrays were fabricated through a novel solution-based method using ZnO nanorod arrays as the template. Typical ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterostructure nanorod arrays consist of ZnO/CdS core/sheath nanorods and Cu2ZnSnS4 nanocrystallines grown on the primary ZnO/CdS core/sheath nanorods. In the ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterostructure nanorods arrays, ZnO core and CdS sheath are single crystalline, while Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoparticles are polycrystalline. The possible formation mechanism of ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterostructure nanorod arrays is also discussed in detail. The ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterostructure nanorod arrays possess a broad and enhanced optical absorption from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region. A good rectification characteristic is observed in the I–V curve of ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 nanorod, which confirms that the ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 nanorod is a p–n heterostructure. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the vibrating properties of ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 heterostructure nanorod arrays. The results indicate that the ZnO/CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4 p–n heterostructure nanorod arrays may shed light on new opportunities for nanoscale optoelectronic devices.IntroductionSemiconducting nanorod (NR) heterostructures containing modulated composition and interfaces with built-in fields have provided materials with multiple functionalities and size-, shape-, and material-dependent properties, which have proven useful as building blocks in the assembly of electronic and photonic devices.1–3 Inspired by the potential applications, increased effort has been devoted to the fabrication of NR heterostructures with various components and structures. As compared with those notable achievements in the synthesis of homogeneous systems, the desire for the formation of one-dimensional (1D) heterostructures with well-defined interfaces has become increasingly urgent. To date, an increasing number of studies, regarding the fabrication of heterostructures within a given 1D nanostructure, have been reported.4–6 However, the rational design of heterostructures followed by successful fabrication, especially the controllable construction of function–junction in the form of NR arrays, still remains a great challenge, at the same time it is a prerequisite for exploring fundamental nanoscale semiconductor physics and offering technological devices with optimum characteristics.As an important copper-based quaternary chalcopyrite semiconductor, p-type semiconducting Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has attracted a great amount of attention in recent years due to a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and a direct band gap (∼1.5 eV) that matches the preferred range of solar irradiation.7,8 Furthermore, the crystal structures and optical properties of CZTS is similar to that of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS), one of the most successful thin-film photovoltaic materials with demonstrated power conversion efficiencies of nearly 20%.9,10 Unfortunately, CIGS contains rare metals In and Ga, which make it expensive. As a comparison, the composition of naturally abundant elements Sn and Zn makes CTZS hopeful, as such characteristics can enable the large-scale commercial application. In fact, it has been theoretically predicted that the power conversion efficiency can be as high as 32.2% for CZTS.11 Recently, CZTS-based solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of 10.1%.12 In the case of n-type semiconducting CdS, which with a direct bandgap (2.42 eV) is considered to be an excellent material for various photoelectrochemical applications in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, like nonlinear optical devices, LEDs, and solar cells.13–16 Additionally, it is well known that n-type semiconducting ZnO has aroused enormous attention because of its applications for photocatalysis, solar cells, piezo-nanogenerators, room-temperature UV laser, LEDs owing to its a direct wide band gap (3.37 eV), a large exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature, and low cost.17–22 As compared with traditional spherical particles, ZnO NR arrays (i) provided high interfacial area for exciton dissociation, (ii) facilitated electron transfer, and (iii) exhibited characteristic direct pathway electron transport which can effectively reduce recombination loss originating from particle-boundary electron hopping or scattering.23,24 Moreover, to date, ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure thin films have been prepared for attempting to elevate the efficiency connected with photogenerated electrons and holes or incorporate new properties, respectively.25–27 Therefore, controllable fabricating ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure nanostructure arrays not only has vital scientific significance but is also expected to apply ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure nanostructure arrays to construct novel micro-nanoscale optoelectronic, electronic devices and sensors, etc.In the present work, we report the design and fabrication of novel ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure NR arrays via solution-based methods using ZnO NR arrays as the template. Typical ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays include ZnO single crystalline core, CdS single crystalline sheath, and CZTS polycrystalline nanoparticles grown on the primary ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR. The possible formation mechanism of ZnO/CdS/CTZS heterostructure NR arrays was studied. Importantly, it is found that the novel ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays show broad and enhanced optical absorption from the ultraviolet to near-infrared region. The current–voltage (I–V) curve of individual ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR exhibits typical p–n rectifying behaviors.Experimental detailsBefore the hydrothermal synthesis, a uniform ZnO buffer layer was deposited on a substrate (Si or glass) by thermally decomposing zinc acetate at 420 °C.28 Then, analytically pure Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) with a mole ratio of 1:1 were added into an autoclave of 50 ml capacity. The autoclave was then filled with water up to 80% of the total volume. After stirring for 5 min, a substrate with a ZnO buffer layer was transferred into the autoclave which was then sealed and maintained at 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the autoclave was cooled to ambient temperature, and the obtained substrate was collected, washed with deionized water, and annealed in air at 420 °C for 20 min to remove any residual organics. Next, a CdS sheath was deposited on the ZnO NR arrays by the Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method.29 Briefly, in the SILAR approach, dissolved cationic and anionic precursors are in separate vessels. For one deposition cycle the bare nanostructured material is dipped into the precursor solution containing the metal cation. After rinsing, the nanostructured material is dipped into the second precursor solution containing the anion, and a second rinsing step completes the deposition cycle. In a typical SILAR process, the ZnO NR arrays were dipped in 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 2 min, rinsed with ethanol, and then dipped in 0.1 M Na2S methanol solution for 2 min, rinsed with methanol again. This two-step dipping process is considered as one cycle. In this work, the number of reaction cycles was twenty. After deposition, the ZnO/CdS core/sheath arrays were annealed in a N2 atmosphere at 420 °C (we found the optimized temperature of formation of higher quality CZTS thin film is 420 °C during other experimental methods (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Therefore we selected 420 °C (as the annealing temperature) for 20 min to remove any residual organics on the surface. Fabricating ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays was divided into two steps. In the first step, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving analytically pure Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, ZnCl2, SnCl2·2H2O, and thiourea into dimethyl sulfoxide while stirring at room temperature until a clear solution was formed.30 Then, the substrate with ZnO/CdS core/sheath arrays was dipped into the above precursor solution for a few minutes, and followed by annealing in N2 atmosphere at 420 °C for 20 min. Accordingly, ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure NR arrays were successfully fabricated.The as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku D/Max-2550), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4800), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; TEC-NAI G2F20) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured at room temperature using a TU-1901 spectrophotometer. The electrical measurements were carried out using a new Scanning tunnel microscope–Transmission electron microscope (STM-TEM) holder commercialized by Nanofactory Instruments AB. The Raman spectra were recorded on a LABRAM-1 Bconfocal laser micro-Raman spectrometer with 532 nm radiations at room temperature.Results and discussionFig. 1a is a typical FE-SEM image of as-prepared ZnO NR arrays. These NRs are nearly perpendicular to the substrate with lengths of about 1.8 μm and diameters from 40 to 60 nm (see inset of Fig. 1a). The aspect ratio of ZnO NR reaches 45, indicating that it could provide a large surface area to increase the adsorption amount of nanoparticles and facilitate electron transportation. Fig. 1b is a representative FE-SEM image of as-prepared ZnO/CdS NR arrays, which clearly shows the upright-standing structure of NR arrays are completely preserved. The diameters of ZnO/CdS NRs increase ranging from 50 to 80 nm with comparison with that of ZnO NRs (see inset of Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c presents a typical FE-SEM image of as-prepared ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. It can be observed that CZTS nanoparticles have grown on the surface of ZnO/CdS NR. Moreover, in some areas, the space between NRs have been filled up. The surface of NRs becomes rougher after the decoration of CZTS nanoparticles (see inset of Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d is the XRD patterns of the as-prepared ZnO NR arrays. All the peaks can be attributed to hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS No. 36-1451). Moreover, the strong intensity of the (002) diffraction peak located at about 2θ = 34.5° confirms that the product grown on the substrate has a preferential growth direction along the c-axis orientation. No impurities are detected, indicating that this ZnO sample is highly phase-pure. Fig. 1e is the XRD patterns of the as-prepared ZnO/CdS NR arrays. The diffraction peaks can be indexed to hexagonal CdS (JCPDS No. 80-0006) and hexagonal ZnO. Fig. 1f is the XRD patterns of the as-prepared ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. Compared to Fig. 1e, three new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.5, 47.3, and 56.1° are observed, which are indexed to diffraction of the (112), (220), and (312) planes of tetragonal CZTS (JCPDS No. 26-0575), respectively.

(b) FE-SEM image ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays; the inset shows a top view of initial ZnO NR arrays. (c) FE-SEM image of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. (d) XRD patterns of initial ZnO NR arrays. (e) XRD patterns of ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays. (f) XRD patterns of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. Fig. 2a is a TEM image of single ZnO NR. The diameter of ZnO NR is about 50 nm and has a smooth surface. Fig. 2d is the corresponding EDS spectrum of bare ZnO NR, which indicates the obtained NR is composed of only Zn and O elements. Fig. 2b is a TEM image of ZnO/CdS NR. It can be clearly seen that the product displays a core/sheath structure. The average thickness of the sheath is about 8 nm. The EDS (Fig. 2e) results confirmed the formation of ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR. Fig. 2c is a TEM image of the obtained ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR (also see Fig. S3, ESI†). In comparison with the ZnO/CdS and ZnO nanorod, the ZnO/CdS/CZTS nanorod has a more rough surface. We can observe that CZTS nanostructures have grown on the surface of the ZnO/CdS nanorod. At the same time, a clear interface between the ZnO core nanorod and CdS sheath is also observed. This can be further confirmed by EDX as shown in Fig. 2f, HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) and electric properties (Fig. 5b and c) of ZnO/CdS/CZTS nanorod. The Ni signals originate from a TEM grid.

(c) HRTEM image of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure interface; the inset shows the corresponding SAED patterns. (d) Schematic illustration of possible formation of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. HRTEM images and SAED patterns clearly show the crystal structure of the ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NRs. Fig. 3a is a typical HRTEM image of initial ZnO NR. The ZnO NRs are single crystalline with a [001] growth direction. The lattice fringes of the hexagonal ZnO (001) planes with a d spacing of 0.521 nm can be clearly seen. Fig. 3b is a HRTEM image taken at the ZnO–CdS interface corresponding to Fig. 2b, which shows a clean and abrupt interface between ZnO and CdS. The core ZnO and the sheath CdS are also single crystalline, which is confirmed by SAED patterns shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. Fig. 3c is the HRTEM image taken at the ZnO–CdS–CZTS interface corresponding to Fig. 2c, which shows a clean interface among ZnO, CdS and CZTS. It can be seen that polycrystalline CZTS nanoparticles attached to the outer surface of the CdS sheath with average diameters of about 6 nm. Moreover, according to the HRTEM image, individual particles which have continuous lattice fringes throughout can be observed. The inter-planar spacing of 0.313 nm corresponds to the (112) plane of CZTS. The SAED of the interface among ZnO core, CdS sheath and CZTS particles in the inset of Fig. 3c shows two sets of spots and a set of rings belonging to hexagonal ZnO, hexagonal CdS and the tetragonal CZTS, respectively.The schematic illustration of the possible formation of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays was proposed in Fig. 3d. In the first stage, vertically aligned ZnO NR arrays were grown on the ZnO buffer layer by a hydrothermal route.28 In the second stage, ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays were fabricated via a SILAR method, as described elsewhere.29 In the SILAR process, the bare ZnO NR arrays were dipped, in sequence, into Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution and Na2S methanol solution. Because nonaqueous solutions (ethanol and methanol) have lower surface tension than aqueous solutions and surface polarity and broken or dangling bonds of ZnO NR, the ionic state of reactants (Cd2+ and S2− ions) could thus better penetrate into and are easily absorbed to the space region of ZnO NR arrays and react with each other. The total thickness of the CdS sheath could be controlled by the number of deposition cycles. Furthermore, the CdS sheath plays two roles in this study: (i) acting as the buffer layer between ZnO (Eg = 3.37 eV, 300 K) and CZTS (Eg = 1.5 eV, 300 K) due to its median band gap (Eg = 2.42 eV, 300 K). Similar cases can be found in the CZTS-based thin film solar cells.12,30 (ii) preventing ZnO NR from erosion caused by NH3 (NH3 is produced by the hydrolyzation of thiourea ((NH2)2CS) (eqn (1)) at the next stage).31,32 Finally, ZnO/CdS core/sheath arrays were dipped into a soluble and non-toxic precursor solution composed of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, ZnCl2, SnCl2·2H2O, and (NH2)2SC for a few minutes. The dipping time of a few minutes should guarantee sufficient adsorption of precursor solution on the surface of ZnO/CdS NRs. Sn(II) salt was used as the tin source in order to get a stable precursor solution, at the same time Cu(II) salt was used to improve the chemical homogeneity. ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays were obtained after the annealing of ZnO/CdS core/sheath arrays dipped in the precursor solution in a N2 atmosphere. The overall reaction (eqn (2)) is given below: (NH2)2CS + 2H2O → H2S + CO2 + 2NH3(1) ZnO/CdS/[Cu(CH3COOH)2·H2O + ZnCl2 + SnCl2·2H2O + (NH2)2SC] → ZnO/CdS/CZTS + gaseous products(2)The absorption spectrum of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays is shown in Fig. 4, where characteristics of ZnO and ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays are also shown for comparison. The ZnO NR arrays exhibit a well-defined exciton band at 375 nm, corresponding to the band gap of bulk ZnO.33 The weak absorption of ZnO NR in the visible region could be attributed to the transition from the ground state to a few defects related deep state.34 Similar instances can be found in previous studies.33–35 The ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays shift the light absorption edge to a higher wavelength. The absorption spectrum of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays display a stronger and improved absorption during the whole visible-light region and the tails extended to longer wavelengths compared with those of ZnO, ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays, CZTS nanostructures and CZTS/PCBM heterolayer.36 Fig. 4  UV-Vis absorption spectra of ZnO NR arrays, ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays, and ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays. The electrical measurements were carried out using a new STM-TEM holder system commercialized by nanofactory instruments AB. An experimental setup is sketched in Fig. 5, as described elsewhere.37 A gold tip is attached to a fixed electrical sensor, and a Pt probe attached with an amount of as-prepared ZnO/CdS/CZTS NRs was placed on the piezo-movable side of the holder. Then positions of the Pt probe and individual ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR are adjusted through the nanoscale precision piezodriven manipulation of the holder system inside the TEM, so as to build a ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR bridge between the Au tip and Pt probe (the inset iii of Fig. 5a). On the basis of the classical model adopted from electricity, the electrical properties of the ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR are evaluated by the dedicated software. For comparison, the as-prepared ZnO NR bridge and ZnO–CdS NR bridge were also built and measured (the inset i and ii of Fig. 5a). The obtained typical I–V curves were shown in Fig. 5b. All of the voltages ranged from −1 to 1 V. As shown in Fig. 5b, the I–V curve of ZnO NR or ZnO–CdS NR shows an almost symmetric nonohmic contact behavior, which results from the back-to-back Schottky contact formed between the metal (Pt, Au) tip and the ZnO NR or ZnO–CdS NR. The current value of ZnO NR varies from −4 to 4 nA, while the ZnO–CdS NR varies from −20 to 20 nA, suggesting that the range of the current variation of ZnO–CdS NR is about 5 times as large as that of ZnO NR at the same voltage. Thus, it can be deduced that the ZnO–CdS NR possesses improved properties and significantly increase conductance, compared with ZnO NR. Unlike the I–V characteristic of single ZnO NR or ZnO–CdS NR, the I–V characteristic of single ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR exhibits a good nonlinear rectification behavior with a current of about 135 nA at a forward turn-on voltage of about 0.6 V. This suggests that the Schottky junction in the circuit is face-to-back. This only occurs when the conduction types of ZnO/CdS and CZTS are different, indicating that the ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure is a p–n junction. Fig. 5c shows the I–V curves of ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR which was measured four times, further demonstrating that the ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure had been successfully fabricated and exhibits a stable and well-defined rectification behavior. Fig. 5  Schematic of the experimental setup within a STM-TEM holder; the insets in the middle show TEM views of the framed area where an individual ZnO NR, ZnO/CdS core/sheath, and ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR were mounted between a platinum and a gold cantilever; The scale bar for TEM image represents 100 nm. (b) typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of an individual an individual ZnO NR, ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR, and ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR, respectively, recorded with STM-TEM by the Nanofactory Instruments AB. The inset shows the magnified I–V characteristics of ZnO NR and ZnO/CdS NR. (c) typical current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of an individual ZnO/CdS/CZTS NR which was measured four times. Fig. 6a is the Raman spectrum of as-prepared ZnO NR arrays. There are two peaks at 332 and 438 cm−1. The prominent peak at 438 cm−1 can be assigned to the E2 (high) mode of ZnO which is only associated with the vibration of the oxygen atoms.38 The peak at 332 cm−1 can be assigned to the E2 (high)–E2 (low) mode originating from a multi-phonon process.39 According to the Raman selection rules, the absence of the A1 (TO) mode around 380 cm−1 and the E1 (TO) mode near 413 cm−1 could be attributed to the incident light exactly perpendicular to the top surface of the ZnO NR arrays, namely, the incident light parallel to the c axis of the ZnO NRs.39,40 Therefore, the absence of TO modes in the measurements once again confirmed the ZnO NR arrays have highly c-axis orientation. In addition, it is well known that the Raman spectrum is very sensitive to the strain status of a substance, especially thin films.41 Therefore, with respect to the E2 (high) mode at 436.8 cm−1 of the ZnO bulk, a blue shift was indeed observed, which implies compressive strain in the as-prepared ZnO sample.42Fig. 6b is the Raman spectrum of as-prepared ZnO/CdS core/sheath NR arrays. The single peak at 304 cm−1 can be assigned to the A1 (LO) mode of CdS.43 Appearance of weak ZnO signals at about 438 cm−1 was due to the penetration limitation of 532 nm laser light. Fig. 6c is the Raman spectrum of as-prepared ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure NR arrays. The single peak at about 332 cm−1 can be assigned to the breathing mode of sulfur atoms around metal ions in the stannite structure CZTS.36a,44 Moreover, the Raman spectrum of CZTS has about 6 cm−1 redshifts in comparison with that of the CZTS thin films,45 which may be due to a strain effect in the heterostructure nanostructures or disorder from relatively poor crystallinity. In addition, the relative intensities of the vibrating peaks of CdS and ZnO are too weak to be observed in the ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NRs due to the penetration limit of 532 nm laser light. A similar situation is observed in the case of Ge nanosheets decorated hierarchical ZnSe/GeSe and CdSe–Ge/Ge nanowire heterostructures.46 Fig. 6  Raman spectra of (a) initial ZnO NR arrays.

ConclusionsIn summary, ZnO/CdS/CZTS p–n heterostructure NR arrays have been fabricated via a novel solution-based method using ZnO NR arrays as a template. ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays consist of ZnO/CdS core/sheath NRs and CZTS nanocrystallines, in which ZnO core and CdS sheath are single crystalline and CZTS nanoparticles are polycrystalline. A possible formation mechanism is proposed. Importantly, the ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays possess a broad and enhanced optical absorption from the ultraviolet to near-infrared region compared with those of ZnO and ZnO–CdS NR arrays and CZTS based nanostructures. The ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure is a p–n junction. The vibrating mode of ZnO/CdS/CZTS heterostructure NR arrays has a 6 cm−1 redshift compared with that of the CZTS thin film due to the strain effect in the heterostructure nanostructures or the disorder from relatively poor crystallinity.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 11174049, 11174048, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the NSFC-NRF Scientific Cooperation Program, and Key Fund of Shanghai Science and Technology Foundation (10DJ1400204).ReferencesJ.
