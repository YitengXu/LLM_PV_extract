Herein we demonstrate the dissolution of elemental tellurium (Te) in a series of alkylamides by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction at relatively low temperature to produce highly reactive precursors for hot-injection synthesis of telluride NCs. The capability to tune the reactivity of Te precursors by selecting injection temperature permits control of NC size over a broad range. The current preparation of Te precursors is simple, economical, and totally phosphine-free, which will promote the commercial synthesis and applications of telluride NCs.
Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted lots of attentions because of the wide potentials in display, bioassay, photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.1–8 These unique properties essentially originate from the size- and shape-dependent charge transfer, surface effects, and geometrical confinement of phonons.9–13 As a family of the most investigated NCs, the synthesis methodologies of metal chalcogenide NCs have been well established, for example the state-of-the-art synthesis of selenide and telluride NCs with controlled size and shape in high-boiling-point organic solvents.14–20 To synthesize high-quality selenide and telluride NCs conventionally involves the preparation of soluble selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) precursors using alkylphosphines, such as trioctylphosphine (TOP) and tributylphosphine (TBP), as solvents cum ligands.21–25 However, alkylphosphines are hazardous and environmentally unfriendly. Phosphine-free routes are the current trend for NC synthesis.26–31 Significant progress has been achieved for the phosphine-free synthesis of selenide NCs. For example, it has been reported that Se powder is dissolvable in hot octadecene, olive oil, paraffin and room-temperature oleylamine (OLA) with the reduction of NaBH4 or alkylthiol.26–31 However, due to the stronger metallicity of Te than Se, the aforementioned methods fail to extend to prepare soluble Te precursors. The totally phosphine-free synthesis of high-quality telluride NCs is still challenging. Nevertheless, telluride NCs are currently irreplaceable materials because of their excellent photovoltaic and thermoelectric performances.32–36 These inspire us to exploit low-toxicity, safe and cheap Te precursors for synthesizing high-quality telluride NCs. In 2012, Gupta's group reported a phosphine-free Te precursor by reducing Te powder using NaBH4 in trioctylamine, despite the high temperature over 350 °C.37
In this communication, we present an alternative phosphine-free route to synthesize metal telluride NCs, such as CdTe, HgTe, PbTe and Ag7Te4. NaBH4 is employed to reduce Te powder in a series of alkylamides, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and N,N-diethylpropionamide (DEP), at moderate temperature (below 80 °C) to produce highly reactive Te precursors (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1), which are subsequently applied for hot-injection synthesis of telluride NCs. In this method, Te powder is reduced into Te2−, which is soluble in alkylamides to form a stable dark purple solution (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1). Without NaBH4, Te powder cannot dissolve in alkylamides even when being heated to a much higher temperature. In the presence of NaBH4, the dissolution of Te powder can be carried out even at room temperature, despite the lowered reaction rate. NMR spectroscopy further indicates that no amine forms during the preparation of Te precursor in the presence of NaBH4 (Fig. S1†). In comparison to other phosphine-free solvents, such as OLA, alkylamides possess unique amide groups which lead to larger polarity and permittivity. The solvent molecules are capable of stabilizing Te2−, thus generating dissolvable Te precursors. Such dissolution is also validated in the synthesis of organic tellurides.38,39
 Scheme 1  The proposed sequence of the reaction in producing soluble tellurium precursors by NaBH4 reduction in alkylamides. 
 Fig. 1  The photographs show the dissolution of 1.5 mmol Te powder in 1.5 ml DMF, DMAC and DEP by heating the mixtures at 80 °C in the presence of 1.5 mmol NaBH4, and the mixture of 1.5 mmol Te powder and 1.5 ml DEP at 180 °C in the absence of NaBH4. No excess NaBH4 remains in the solution. No obvious difference in the reactivity of these tellurium solutions is found in synthesizing NCs. 
To validate that the tellurium solutions are available for hot-injection synthesis of NCs outside a glove box, the antioxidation of Te2− in the alkylamides is studied by exposure to the open air. It shows that the stability of Te precursors depends on the alkyl chain length of alkylamides. By aging the DMF, DMAC and DEP solutions of Te in the open air, the oxidation of Te follows the sequence Te–DMF, Te–DMAC and Te–DEP, showing that Te2−is easier to oxidize into Te in the alkylamides with short alkyl chains. It takes more than 1 h to completely oxidize the Te precursor in DEP, which is stable enough for the hot-injection synthesis of NCs. We ascribe this phenomenon to the electron donating effect of alkyl chains. Long alkyl chains strongly enhance the electron density of the alkylamides, thus forming more stable Te precursors.38,39 Moreover, no obvious difference in the reactivity of Te–DMF, Te–DMAC and Te–DEP is found for synthesizing NCs. With the consideration of temperature control, Te–DEP is demonstrated for hot-injection synthesis of telluride NCs owing to the highest boiling point of DEP among these alkylamides.
In a typical synthesis of CdTe NCs, 0.032 g Te powder (0.25 mmol) and 0.01 g NaBH4 (0.26 mmol) were placed in a three-neck flask containing 2 ml DEP. Following cycled vacuum and nitrogen three times, the mixture was heated at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere to produce a dark purple solution of Te precursors. Meanwhile, 0.228 g CdCl2·2H2O (1 mmol) was placed in a four-neck flask containing 8 ml OLA at room temperature, and cycled between vacuum and nitrogen three times. Afterward, the mixture was kept at 80 °C for 30 min and then heated to 190 °C to produce Cd precursors. The Te precursors were injected into the Cd precursors at 190 °C and maintained for 10 min. After that, the flask was rapidly cooled to room temperature, and the as-synthesized NCs were washed three times by precipitation with ethanol and redispersed in chloroform.
Fig. 2a shows the transmission election microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized CdTe NCs. The NCs are fairly monodisperse and appear to be spherical with an average diameter of 5.4 nm (Fig. 2a inset). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observations reveal that the NCs are well-formed single crystals without stacking faults. Two interplanar distances of 0.38 and 0.23 nm are exhibited by HRTEM, which are consistent with the (111) and (220) crystallographic facets of cubic CdTe (Fig. 2b and c).21,22 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern further proves that the NCs possess cubic structure (Fig. 2d).21,22 For X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 2e), the diffraction peaks appear at 23.8, 39.3, 46.4, 56.8, 62.4 and 71.2°, consistent with the (111), (220), (311), (400), (331) and (422) planes of cubic CdTe.21,22

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to reveal the valence state of the constituent Cd and Te in the as-synthesized NCs (Fig. S2†). The Cd 3d spectrum presents two peaks at 404.9 and 411.6 eV, consistent with Cd2+.40 For the Te 3d spectrum, two strong peaks, at 572.1 and 582.6 eV, are observed, which represent the binding energy of lattice Te2−.40 The shoulders at about 576.2 and 586.6 eV are assigned to the oxidation of a little Te on the surface of the NCs in the preparation of the XPS sample. The composition of the as-synthesized CdTe NCs is further revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. S3†), which shows a Cd-to-Te atomic ratio of 3.6/1.0, closer to the feed ratio in the precursors, which is 4/1. The disparity is ascribed to the high reactivity of Te precursors, leaving some Cd in the reaction system by forming Cd–OLA complexes. The high Cd-to-Te ratio also indicates that the NC surface is Cd-rich and passivated by the Cd ligand of OLA.30
Since the Te precursors are highly reactive, the current synthesis of telluride NCs can be performed at relatively low temperature with minimized nucleation and growth duration.24 In particular, a feasible and repeatable size control is fulfilled by adjusting the hot-injection temperature. To synthesize different sized CdTe NCs, a specific injection temperature is adopted for nucleation, and the subsequent growth is terminated within 10 s by cooling down the reaction mixture. Fig. 3a–d show the TEM images of the CdTe NCs that are synthesized with the injection temperature of 120, 140, 160 and 180 °C. With increasing the temperature, the diameters of the as-synthesized NCs increase from 3.1 to 4.7 nm. Fig. 3e and f indicate the UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of the NCs. The elevated injection temperature leads to the shift of the absorption peak from 520 to 644 nm, and the PL peak from 540 to 650 nm. The PL images show the change of emission color from green to red (Fig. 3f inset). The full width at half maximum of the PL spectra is rather narrow, which is between 25 and 30 nm. By comparing the absorption and PL spectra, a small Stokes shift is observed. This represents the fine atomic array in the as-synthesized NCs.22,23 These spectral data are comparable to those of the CdTe NCs synthesized using Te–TOP or Te–TBP as the Te precursors.21–25

As mentioned in the previous work, lower reaction temperature and shorter duration represent higher reactivity of precursors.24 When Te–phosphine precursors, such as Te–TOP and Te–TBP, are used for synthesizing NCs, the reaction temperature is above 200 °C.21 When amine/NaBH4/Te is used, the temperature is above 300 °C.37 Besides, the reaction duration is usually fixed around 30 min.21,37 In comparison, the reaction temperature of our amide/NaBH4/Te precursors is as low as 120 °C and the reaction duration can be minimized to less than 10 s. The much lower reaction temperature and shorter duration reveal the higher reactivity of our Te precursors than the amine/NaBH4/Te and Te-phosphines.
Due to the high reactivity of the Te precursors, it is facile to synthesize large CdTe NCs by simply prolonging the growth duration. For example, 200 °C injection and 15 min growth produce NCs with an average diameter of 10.8 nm (Fig. 4aand S4†). To our best knowledge, by the conventional method using Te–TOP or Te–TBP as the Te precursors, such large CdTe NCs have never been synthesized below 250 °C.23 These large NCs are very useful in photovoltaic, thermoelectric and analytical applications.6–8
 Fig. 4  TEM images of 10.8 nm CdTe (a), 9.6 nm HgTe (b), 5.0 nm PbTe (c) and 3.8 nm Ag7Te4 NCs (d). 
The Te precursors are also workable for synthesizing other telluride NCs, such as HgTe, PbTe, Ag7Te4, and so forth (Fig. 4b–d). As shown in Fig. 4b, the as-synthesized HgTe NCs are spherical and well monodispersed. The average diameter of the NCs is 9.6 nm. The XRD pattern firmly supports that the NCs possess cubic structure (Fig. S5†).41 The average diameter of PbTe and Ag7Te4 NCs is 5.0 and 3.8 nm, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). They are also well-formed single crystals (Fig. S6 and S7†). The compositions of these NCs are characterized by EDX, as shown in Fig. S8–S10.† In all, the size and size distribution of these NCs are comparable to those of the NCs synthesized using conventional Te–TOP or Te–TBP precursors.41–43
A simple NC/polymer hybrid solar cell device with an ITO/TiO2/CdTe/P3HT/MO3/Au structure was constructed to validate the photovoltaic properties of the as-synthesized telluride NCs.5 The CdTe NCs with the average diameter of 10.8 nm were employed (Fig. 4a). The inset of Fig. S11† is the structure of the device, which exhibits a primary power conversion efficiency of 0.1% without further device optimization.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate new Te precursors for totally phosphine-free synthesis of high-quality telluride NCs. This method employs NaBH4 to reduce Te powder and subsequently dissolve Te in a series of alkylamides by moderate heating. The Te-alkylamide solution is stable enough as the precursor for hot-injection synthesis of telluride NCs, such as CdTe, HgTe, PbTe and Ag7Te4. In addition, the Te precursors are highly reactive, which permit production of NCs at the lowered hot-injection temperature from 120 to 200 °C. Due to the high reactivity, it is facile to tailor the NC size by programming the injection temperature and the growth duration of NCs, for example controlling the diameter of CdTe NCs from 3 to 11 nm. Since the current phosphine-free synthesis is facile and feasible, it will be extended to design and produce composition- and morphology-controlled telluride NCs for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.
