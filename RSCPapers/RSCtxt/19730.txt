The QDSCs using NiCo2S4 as a counter electrode (CE) achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.22%, which exceeds the performance of QDSCs based on a Pt CE by 38.4%.
Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been used as light harvesters in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), which in principle adopt the design of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1 In comparison with dye light harvesters, QDs have several advantages including the tunable band gap, high molar extinction coefficient, hot electron injection, and large intrinsic dipole moment. However, the photovoltaic performance (∼5%) of QDSCs remains much lower than that (up to 12.3%) of DSCs.2 Such low photovoltaic performance is largely ascribed to the lack of ideal counter electrodes (CEs).3 Platinum (Pt) is regarded as a highly efficient CE for the I−/I3− redox couple. In QDSCs, to minimize the photocorrosion of CdS, CdSe, and CdS–CdSe-photoanodes, the I−/I3− redox couple is replaced by the polysulfide redox couple. However, the Pt CE has been problematic for catalysing the polysulfide redox couple, since the adsorption of S2− onto the Pt surface can decrease the surface activity of the catalyst. To resolve the problem, alternatives to Pt have been widely explored, including carbon,4 Cu2S/reduced graphene oxides (RGO),5 CoS,6 PbS,7 CoS/CuS,8 NiS,9 brass,10 conducting polymers,11 Cu2ZnSnSe4, etc.12 Among these CEs, metal chalcogenides exhibit high electrocatalytic activity. However, there are no reports on investigations of the catalytic activity of NiCo2S4 for the polysulfide redox couple yet, despite the fact that doping Ni atoms into spinel-type Co3O4 can enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reactions.13
The catalytically active area and electrical conductivity of the CEs also significantly influence the catalytic activity. Comparatively speaking, the vertical array nanostructures facilitate efficient mass transfer and provide large surface area, especially for hollow structures, which have been reported as highly efficient CEs for DSCs.14 The single crystalline structure facilitates faster electron transport than the polycrystalline structure. However, to date, there has been no report on preparation of hollow metal sulfide single crystalline arrays as CEs for QDSCs.
Herein, we report a self-standing hollow NiCo2S4 single crystalline nanorod array as a highly efficient CE for QDSCs. The formation process is shown schematically in Scheme 1. Co2+ and Ni2+ ions first reacted with the hydrolysis products of urea to form (Ni, Co)(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O via a sequential crystallization process, just like forming sea urchin-like (Ni, Co)(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O in bulk solution under similar growth conditions as those reported by us previously (Step I in Scheme 1 and Fig. S1A, ESI†).15 The as-formed (Ni, Co)(CO3)0.5OH nanorods with ∼5 μm in length are uniformly grown on the FTO glass substrate (Fig. 1A and B), which have single crystalline structure and grow along the [100] direction (Fig. 1C). Followed by reaction with H2S gas at room temperature (Step II in Scheme 1), the surface of the nanorods is transformed into metal sulfide, which is supposed to be the amorphous phase, since the diffraction peaks of metal sulfide can't be found in Fig. S1B (ESI†). After the subsequent thermal decomposition process (Step III in Scheme 1), the (Ni, Co)(CO3)0.5OH–amorphous metal sulfides are transformed into metal oxide–metal sulfide core–shell nanostructures (Fig. 1D), which are supposed to be composed of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4, in accordance with the standard pattern JCPDS 01-073-1704 and 00-020-0782, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Schematic graph of the formation process of hollow metal sulfide (MSx) nanorod arrays via the vulcanization and subsequent etching processes. Step I: the metal carbonate hydroxide (M(CO3)xOHy) nanorod arrays are in situ grown on a FTO glass substrate; step II: reacting with H2S gas at room temperature, M(CO3)xOHy is transformed into M(CO3)xOHy–amorphous MSx core–shell nanostructure; step III: through the thermal treatment process, the M(CO3)xOHy core is decomposed into metal oxides (MOx), and the crystallinity of the amorphous MSx shell increased to that of a single crystal, forming the MOx–MSx core–shell nanostructure; step IV: the acid etching process dissolves the M(CO3)xOHy and MOx cores to form amorphous and single crystalline MSx hollow nanostructure, respectively.

After immersing in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (Step IV in Scheme 1), the NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 core–shell nanorods were etched to form hollow NiCo2S4 nanorods (Fig. 1E and F). The hollow NiCo2S4 nanorods have the same XRD pattern as that of NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 core–shell nanorods (Fig. S1C and D, ESI†), and no oxygen element is detected in the EDX spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting that both NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 have the same spinel-type structure. The as-formed hollow NiCo2S4 nanorod has single crystalline structure, as seen in Fig. 1G, in which Co, Ni, and S elements are uniformly distributed (Fig. 1H). The thickness of the NiCo2S4 shell is dependent on the vulcanization time under a H2S atmosphere. When the vulcanization time increased to more than 4 days, (Ni, Co)(CO3)0.5OH was completely transformed into the metal sulfide nanorods, as seen in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
To gain further information on the structure and composition of the hollow NiCo2S4 nanorods, we resort to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The peak at 161.4 eV is characteristic of S 2p, which is consistent with that of cobalt sulfide reported previously.16 As regards the Co 2p XPS spectrum, it shows a doublet containing a low energy band (Co 2p3/2) and a high energy band (Co 2p1/2) at 778.5 and 793.6 eV.17 The de-convolution of the Ni 2p peaks shows the atoms in the 2p1/2 and the 2p3/2 electronic configuration at 873.2 and 855.5 eV, respectively. The main 2p3/2 peak is close to 854.9 eV for Ni2+ but much lower than 857.1 eV for Ni3+,18 suggesting that it was in the divalent state. The binding energies of these peaks ascribed to Co and Ni are consistent with cubic spinel NiCo2O4,19 signifying the formation of NiCo2S4 thiospinel.
To evaluate the catalytic activities, the QDSCs were fabricated, in which photoanodes were made of CdSe QD sensitized TiO2 film modified with ZnS.20 Fig. 2 shows the J–V curves of the QDSCs, and the resultant photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the standard device with the Pt CE, NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 and hollow NiCo2S4 nanorod based QDSCs exhibited higher overall power conversion efficiency (η), in the sequence hollow NiCo2S4 > NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 > Pt. This is mainly ascribed to much higher short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), closely related to the catalytic activity towards the polysulfide redox couple. This is in conformity with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization results described below. The corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) are in the sequence hollow NiCo2S4 > NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 > Pt (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is in good agreement with the Jsc of the devices, suggesting that their catalytic activity follows the same tendency.

Note that hollow NiCo2S4 single crystalline nanorod based QDSCs exhibited the highest Jsc among the QDSCs, which may be because the hollow structure provides a high catalytically active area, and the single crystalline structure enhances the electron transport, as seen from the EIS results described below. The Jsc of the hollow NiCo2S4 nanorod CE based QDSCs still remained at 14.90 mA cm−2 after being stored for 12 h (Fig. S6, ESI†). In comparison with CuS CEs, our NiCo2S4 CEs, like the reported CoS and NiS CEs,6 exhibited better stability, since the polysulfide electrolyte showed a strong corrosion on the CuS electrode.21 Table 1 also summarizes the photoelectrochemical performance of QDSCs with various CEs, in comparison with ours. It was found that our hollow NiCo2S4 CE based QDSCs exhibited higher power conversion efficiency than that of CoS and NiS based QDSCs reported previously.6,9
To evaluate the catalytic activities of Pt, NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 and hollow NiCo2S4 CEs toward sulfide redox shuttles, we resort to the EIS and Tafel polarization measurements of the symmetrical cells based on the identical films (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A shows the typical EIS Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells. The EIS data were fitted based on an equivalent circuit model in the inset of Fig. 3A. It consists of the series resistance associated with the catalyst layer covered FTO substrate (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, and Warburg diffusion resistance (W) of polysulfide ions in the electrolyte. Note that Rct, also called Faraday resistance, is closely related to the catalytic activity.22 The Rct of hollow NiCo2S4 CEs (11.9 ohm) is lower than those of NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 (12.8 ohm) and Pt CEs (369.7 ohm), suggesting that hollow NiCo2S4 CEs exhibit better catalytic activities than NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 and Pt CEs, in accordance with the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The large contact area at the CE-electrolyte interface can be reflected by the different Cdl.23 In comparison with those of NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 (1210.4 μF) and Pt CEs (10.7 μF), hollow NiCo2S4 nanorod CEs have evidently larger Cdl (3038.5 μF), indicating a larger catalytically active area.
 Fig. 3  (A) Nyquist plots and (B) Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with identical Pt, NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4, and hollow NiCo2S4 electrodes (inset of A: the magnification curve and the electrical equivalent circuit model used for data fitting). 
Fig. 3B shows the Tafel curves ((log J) versus voltage). Theoretically, the Tafel curve is divided into the polarization, Tafel, and diffusion zones, at the low, middle, and high potential areas, respectively. The catalytic activities of the CEs can be evaluated from the exchange current density (J0) and limiting diffusion current density (Jlimit) obtained from the Tafel and diffusion zones. According to the Tafel equation,24 the hollow NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 CEs exhibit higher J0 than Pt CEs in the Tafel zone, indicating better electrocatalytic activity for the polysulfide redox couple. Similarly, the change in the tendency of J0 obtained from EIS results is generally in accordance with those obtained from the Tafel zones, according to the equation J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, and n is the electron number involved in the polysulfide redox couple. Note that hollow NiCo2S4 CEs show higher Jlimit than NiCo2O4–NiCo2S4 and Pt CEs from the diffusion zone. According to the equation D = lJlimit/2nFC, where l is the spacer thickness and C is the electrolyte concentration, it can be seen that hollow NiCo2S4 CEs have a large diffusion coefficient (D) value, and thus allow fast diffusion velocity of the redox couple in the electrolyte.
In summary, we have reported a facile method to synthesize self-standing hollow NiCo2S4 single crystalline nanorod arrays for catalysing the polysulfide redox couple in QDSCs. The hollow nanostructure provided a large catalytically active area and facilitated the electrolyte transport, and the single crystalline 1-D nanostructure promoted fast electron transport. Given their low cost and easy fabrication in large areas, the hollow NiCo2S4 single crystalline nanorod arrays hold promise as high performance CEs for QDSCs, and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.22%.
