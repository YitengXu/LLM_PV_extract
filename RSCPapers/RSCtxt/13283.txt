On the other hand, new sustainable energy solutions require the development of advanced functional materials. Carbon composite nanofibers are attractive functional materials for a wide range of applications, including energy storage and conversion, sensing, catalysis, water filtration, drug delivery, gas separation, and tissue engineering, owing to their unique properties, such as a high surface area to volume ratio, excellent chemical resistance, superior electrical and thermal conductivity, and mechanical stability.

We discuss the main production parameters affecting the morphology and structure of prepared composites and summarize them by applications. The advantages and challenges of using PVP as a carbon source are highlighted by classifying the designed materials as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries and other energy storage systems, semiconductors, and beyond.
1. Introduction
Increasing energy consumption leads to the excessive use of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other volatile organic and inorganic compounds formed during fuel combustion lead to air pollution, acid rain, and other severe environmental problems such as global climate change.1,2 Furthermore, currently available energy resources are limited, and the future generation may face a massive energy crisis.3 To overcome these issues, fossil fuels must be replaced by green alternatives, which have minimal impact on the environment.
Renewable energy sources, including hydropower, modern biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind, are extensively studied and developed as clean, promising alternatives to fossil fuels.4 They can provide sufficient energy without CO2 emission. A decade ago, renewable energy sources were supplying 14% of the total world energy demand. Their current development state allows expecting that this value will reach about 50% by 2040.5 Nevertheless, low energy utilization efficiency, high installation cost, and intermittence still restrict the broad application of renewable energy sources. Energy storage devices are essential to compensate for the fluctuating nature and connect energy from renewable sources to the consumer.6,7 Another way to reduce fossil fuel consumption is by replacing vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine with electro-mobiles.8,9 However, their competitiveness again strongly depends on the cost, safety, and characteristics of the energy storage devices.10
There are different types of energy storage devices classified by their storage mechanisms.11 According to the Ragone plane,12 electrochemical energy storage devices, or batteries, have the highest energy density. However, it is still insufficient for coupling with renewable energy sources and long-range electric vehicles due to the limited characteristics of commercially available electrode materials. Alternative materials of theoretically high energy density, on the other hand, suffer from various problems, such as low electronic and ionic conductivity, structural instability, volume expansion, and side reactions with electrolytes, which affect their practical performance and delay their commercialization.13–17 Designing carbon composite nanostructures, particularly one-dimensional (1D) carbon-based materials, like nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanobelts, has been regarded as a promising approach to overcome most of the above-mentioned issues simultaneously.18–22
Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as 1D materials exhibit unique properties, such as a high surface area to volume ratio, excellent chemical resistance, superior electrical and thermal conductivity, and mechanical stability. Combining a 1D structure, large pores, and conductive carbon can increase the electrolyte-active material contact area, shorten the Li+/Na+ ion diffusion pathway, and speed up electron transfer.23 These merits make CNF-based materials attractive for a wide range of applications, including energy storage and conversion, sensing, catalysis, water filtration, drug delivery, gas separation, and tissue engineering.18,24
To date, different approaches have been reported for the synthesis of carbon composite nanofibers, including template synthesis, chemical vapor deposition on graphene, solvothermal synthesis, and electrospinning.25 Among them, electrospinning coupled with heat treatment is an inexpensive and straightforward technique that produces nanostructures with varying morphologies from polymer solutions or melts.26,27 Other advantages of the electrospinning technique are the homogeneous mixing of precursor salts at the molecular level, ease of fiber functionalization, material combination, and fiber deposition onto other substrates.28 Furthermore, CNFs prepared by the electrospinning technique can be easily processed into three-dimensional (3D) free-standing mats that can be directly used and easily manipulated in practical applications without any additional coating procedures.18 Considering the advancement of wearable electronics and portable microdevices, removing the bulky binders and heavy metal current collectors is critical to improving the performance and durability of materials in different applications.29
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is the most widely used carbon source for electrospinning as it perfectly keeps the fibrous structure during heat treatments and gives a large carbon yield.30 However, the low solubility of PAN in many solvents, except hazardous dimethylformamide (DMF), restricts the synthesis of high-content target inorganic materials due to the precipitation of precursors in the starting solution. In contrast, the thermoplastic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is more soluble in many solvents, including environmentally friendly water and ethyl alcohol (EthOH), and widely used as a compatibilizer in combination with PAN to develop a broader range of carbon-based composite nanofibers.31–33 For instance, introducing PVP into the PAN-nickel(II) acetate (PAN-Ni(OAc)2) solution increased the number of functional groups for Ni coordination to avoid the precipitation of Ni(OAc)2.34 Furthermore, PVP plays an essential role as a stabilizer for the uniform distribution of inorganic precursors.35–37
PVP alone is often used as the spinning template and mesopore-generating agent and eliminated from the medium during high-temperature heat treatment in air.38,39 However, recently, it has attracted more attention as a low-cost and environmentally friendly carbon source, as it can maintain structural integrity after carbonization.40–42 Using highly soluble PVP allows preparing composites with a high content of the inorganic component formed during the conversion of uniformly distributed precursors without any aggregations. Furthermore, firmly bound structures can be easily developed thanks to the possibility of the pyrrole group of PVP interacting with several organic and inorganic compounds.43 Thus, when appropriate heat treatment conditions are applied, advanced functional nanofibers can be easily synthesized for high-performance energy storage applications and beyond (Fig. 1). On the other hand, in comparison with conventional PAN-derived carbon composite nanofibers,30 the synthesis of different functional nanofiber mats, using PVP as a carbon source, needs to be further extensively studied.

This review focuses on PVP as a sole carbon source without any additional polymer-derived carbon source for composite nanofibers prepared by electrospinning with subsequent heat treatments. We discuss the main production parameters affecting the morphology and structure of prepared composites and summarize them by applications. Furthermore, the advantages and challenges of using PVP as a carbon source are highlighted.
2. Electrospinning principles and choice of the polymer template as a carbon source
Electrospinning is a technique that utilizes an electric field to produce polymer nanofibers from a solution. Fig. 2 illustrates the schematics of a simple electrospinning setup, which consists of two main parts: a liquid-precursor feed unit and an electrostatic spin unit.44 The liquid-precursor feed unit comprises a micro-feeder or pump (1) with a syringe (2). The electrostatic spin unit consists of a stainless-steel nozzle (3), a high-DC-voltage power supply (4), and a grounded collector (5). The synthesis of nanofibers with desired characteristics involves the careful selection of a precursor solution and polymer. Once the solution is appropriately mixed, it is fed into a syringe which is connected to a syringe pump in an electrospinning setup. Subsequently, a homogeneous viscous solution is delivered to the tip of a stainless-steel nozzle. The nozzle is connected to a D. C. high voltage supplier, which induces a positive charge on the polymer solution. As the voltage is increased, a conical Taylor cone shape forms at the tip of the nozzle, which eventually results in the ejection of a jet from the cone tip when the voltage surpasses a critical level (inset of Fig. 2). The charged jet undergoes bending instability, gradually elongates in air with the evaporation of the solvent, and subsequently leads to the formation of randomly oriented solid nanofibers, which are then collected on a grounded collector.45,46 More details on the electrospinning principles and effect of different parameters can be found in the literature devoted to electrospinning as a process.47–49
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the electrospinning set-up. 
The adjustment of the electrospinning parameters depends on the solution properties and mainly on the type of chosen polymer template. Since it also plays the role of a carbon source in the synthesis of CNFs, the choice of the polymer depends on the specific properties required for the particular application. A comparative analysis of various types of polymers that are most used for the synthesis of CNFs by the electrospinning method is presented in Table 1. The main difference between PVP and other polymers is in its molecular structure, which contains a strongly hydrophilic heterocycle pyrrolidone with polar CO and C–N functional groups, and a considerable hydrophobic chain with apolar CH2 functional groups. As a result, it is soluble in different solvents and easily interacts with cations and anions through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces, forming coordinated complex structures (Fig. 3). This property of PVP ensures its high compatibility with a vast range of compounds, along with the possibility to synthesize isolated nanoparticles.50,51 Furthermore, solution preparation itself is comparably easier and does not require heating or long-time stirring as in the case of other polymers.

Due to the difference in the molecular structure and decomposition behavior, polymers possess different carbon yields and porosity after carbonization. The highest yield of 70 wt% is observed for polyimide (PI, formed after thermal imidization of polyamic acid after the electrospinning), while the lowest yield of 5 wt% is observed for polyethylene oxide (PEO).
Although PVP has a moderate carbon yield of 15 wt%, it can maintain a wider range of carbon content in CNF composites comparable to PAN-derived CNFs. During the decomposition and carbonization of PVP, functional groups should be smoothly eliminated in the form of oxides to keep the fibrous morphology.59 On the other hand, the lack of oxygen in the structure of PVP itself gives it strong reducing properties, allowing the reduction of oxygen-containing inorganic precursors.44 The elimination of oxides during the decomposition and carbonization of polymers forms a porous structure. Porosity is believed to influence the transport of charge carriers (ions or electrons) and the accessibility of the active sites on the surface of the electrode. As seen from Table 1, CNFs derived from oxygen-containing water-soluble polymers, including PVP, have higher porosity. Despite PAN-derived CNFs possessing the highest Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller specific surface area (BETs.s.a), they typically have a narrower pore size distribution, whereas PVP can be used to create CNFs with a vast range of pore size, including micro-, meso-, and macro-pores.
3. Production of electrospun PVP-derived CNFs
There are three main ways of producing carbon composite nanofibers using the electrospinning technique: deposing desired compounds on an electrospun CNF template, ex situ carbon coating of ready nanoparticles, and in situ carbon coating with simultaneous formation of desired compounds during the carbonization of the polymer.44,60,61 The first one is not common for PVP-derived composites, as the low yield of pure PVP fibers after the heat treatment does not allow the production of free-standing templates. On the other hand, it possesses several advantages as an ex situ and in situ carbon coating source as mentioned in the Introduction part. These processes consist of three main steps: solution preparation, electrospinning itself, and heat treatments. The schematics of the production of the electrospun PVP-derived CNFs as well as their possible microstructures are presented in Fig. 4.

3.1. Solution preparation
A basic electrospinning solution contains PVP polymer and dispersed nanoparticles or dissolved precursors of the desired inorganic compounds in a solvent. Synthesis of compounds and alloys of transition metals is becoming of high interest due to their enhanced electrical conductivity, thermal and mechanical stability, catalytic activity, and outstanding redox capacity properties.62,63 Subsequently, precursors vary depending on the desired physical and electrochemical characteristics of nanofibrous compounds and include metal nitrates, alkoxides, acetates, chlorides, etc. Due to the strong reducing properties of PVP during annealing in an inert atmosphere, choosing appropriate precursors may be critical for the successful synthesis of the desired material.64 On the other hand, these reducing properties of PVP could be efficiently utilized in the reduction of SnO2 nanoparticles forming metallic Sn particles,65 SnOx within porous carbon nanofibers,66 or reduction of three-valent Fe species into two-valent Fe,67 preparation of graphene from graphene oxide,59 and reducing phosphates to phosphides.68
PVP is soluble in many solvents, but EthOH and distilled water are the most commonly used alone or in combination as they are comparably green. However, DMF and isopropanol (i-PrOH) are sometimes also used. The average molecular weight (MW) of PVP varies from 300000 to 1300000 g mol−1.41,42,44,71–73 The lower MW of PVP results in electrospraying of spherical particles and the higher the molecular weight, the higher the chances of getting smooth nanofibers without beads. However, the range should not exceed a critical point leading to the formation of micro-ribbons.73 The concentration of PVP in the solution varies from 3 to 18 wt%, and 5–10 wt% are the most common. Among different parameters, it has a significant effect on the fiber diameter, morphology, and porosity. The smaller the concentration, the smaller the fiber diameter.46 As too low concentration leads to low viscosity and electrospraying of spherical particles, sufficient concentration is important to get uniform fibers.74 However, clogging has to be considered as at solution concentrations beyond the critical range, the polymer solution may clot and block the flow in the syringe. If that happens, helix-shaped micro-ribbons and/or beaded structures may occur.75
The mesopore volume of fibers after carbonization increases with the decrease of the polymer concentration. However, at critical low concentrations, the pore size may also be decreased.44 Although the underlying mechanisms of pore formation features depending on the solution concentration are not clear yet, the possible reason may be the difference in stretching of the charged jet during the fiber formation, which is affected by solution viscosity.76 The elimination features of the decomposition products depending on the fiber diameter may be another reason. Nevertheless, more experimental studies are needed to establish the correlation between the solution concentration and porosity.
Another solution property to consider is conductivity. The increase in the conductivity of a solution enables free charges available to interact with the electric field after which a Taylor cone is formed. By contrast, non-conductive solutions do not have any free charges for Taylor cone's formation, and thus, a small amount of salt is added mostly.75 The increased conductivity leads to a decrease in the diameter of the nanofibers.77 However, too high conductivity originating from a high concentration of precursor salts may also compromise the smooth formation of fibers.
During the solution preparation process, the effect of stirring time can be decisive as well. The effect of stirring and electrospinning time is researched by Fakhri et al. in the case of polylactic acid (PLA) – a biodegradable polymer that has been dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) and dimethylformamide (DMF). By comparing 24 h of stirring with 48 h, they have concluded that a more uniform fiber diameter is obtained from 48 h due to the homogeneous dissolution of PLA pellets.78 Since PVP tends to interact with precursor ions, the effect of stirring time should be studied in the case of PVP precursor solutions as well.
3.2. Electrospinning process
The electrospinning machine consists of three main parts: a syringe pump, a high-voltage supplier, and a collector.79 First, a syringe pump is a place where the solution is kept initially, and it gradually turns into fibers by the voltage applied. Second, the applied voltage varies from 8 to 35 kV, keeping a potential/distance ratio between 0.7 and 2.1 kV cm−1 depending on the properties of the solution and the way of production of CNFs.41,42,44,71,73 Third, a collector is a place where formed nanofibers are deposited. The usage of collectors varies depending on the desired physical characteristics; flat plate, drum, liquid bath, rotating disc, parallel plates, guide wire, rotating wire, and conveyor types of collectors are currently available.80,81
During the electrospinning process itself, two main parameters impact the characteristics of nanofibers, namely, processing and ambient parameters. The processing parameters like voltage supply, needle diameter, the distance between the needle tip and collector, flow rate, and the collector type can be adjusted on most of the basic electrospinning set-ups. However, additional equipment and/or engineering solutions may be needed to control the ambient parameters such as temperature and relative humidity (RH).
The voltage is a driving force to transform the solution droplets into fibers. The application of higher voltages causes higher coulombic repulsion of charges, which leads to a larger amount of ejected polymer. This in turn forms nanofibers with a wider diameter and rougher structures.74 A factor that accounts for the amount of force required to pump the solution out is the needle diameter, which is chosen along with the viscosity of the precursor solution. For a jet to fully evaporate and to avoid increased electric field, the needle tip-to-collector distance should be maximized to form a smooth and uniform surface.82 The critically low flow rates optimum to form a Taylor cone are preferable to obtain fibers without beads as they give time for a solution to polarize. The collector types are also important: flat-type collectors are good for non-woven nanofibers while aligned nanofibers are produced using drum collectors.77
Temperature change during electrospinning affects the morphology and mass transfer rate of nanofibers. The environmentally friendly and cost-effective solvent for PVP is EthOH, the evaporation rate of which is exponentially dependent on the set temperature. At low temperatures, the drying time for a solution is higher, leading to the elongation of a charged jet, which results in a lower diameter of fibers. At higher temperatures, polymer chains freely move and it leads to a lower viscosity of a solution. Thus, lower temperatures cause the formation of a solid core and a smooth surface, while higher temperatures result in nanofibers with a porous core and a rough surface.72,80
The RH affects the drying of a precursor solution, and the properties of the fibers including its morphology, liquid retention, mechanical and wetting properties, phase composition, chain conformation, and surface potential.83 The study performed by De Vrieze et al. shows an effect of RH on the formation of fibers and their diameter. In higher RH ranges, PVP solute in ethanol is subject to water absorption due to a higher partial pressure of water in the atmosphere.72 On average, the diameter of fibers decreases as the humidity increases, and is explained by the continuous elongation of a charged jet after coming out of a Taylor cone.72,83–85

Table 2 summarizes the effect of production parameters on the properties of electrospun PVP-based fibers. Overall, the impact of all stages on the formation of nanofibers is crucial, and thus, a careful strategy is needed to obtain desired results.

3.3. Heat treatment
After the electrospinning, the prepared fiber mats may be dried or directly subjected to heat treatments. Although PVP and PAN have a similar melting point, PAN has been demonstrated as a superior carbon matrix for Si compared with PVP annealed using the same heat-treatment process.86,87 It could be attributed to the reducing nature of PVP during decomposition and carbonization. Depending on the heat treatment atmosphere (inert or air), PVP decomposes in two different ways (Fig. 5). Thus, when the amount of inorganic oxidizers is insufficient, direct annealing in an inert atmosphere leads to the elimination of the heterocycle (1a), while a pre-oxidation step in air leads to the partial oxidation and opening of the heterocycle (1b).44 Choosing appropriate heat treatment conditions is essential to obtain excellent functional composite nanofibers using PVP as a carbon source. When synthesizing pure CNFs without any additive, to stabilize the fibrous morphology and yield CNFs with an excellent morphology, a three-step heat treatment process is required, consisting of drying, pre-oxidation, and carbonization.41

A drying step is needed to remove the solvent left on the obtained precursor fibers. Sometimes sufficient drying is the key to getting a uniform fibrous morphology and obtaining freestanding mats after the carbonization process. Kim et al. researched the thermal properties of PVP-derived CNFs and found that moisture and solvent are removed at temperatures up to 140 °C, while at 140 °C hydroxyl is desorbed.73 Therefore, the drying is conducted in air or under vacuum, overnight or for 12–24 h, and at different temperatures, varying from 70 to 150 °C.41,42,71 Since PVP is a water-soluble polymer and easily adsorbs moisture from the environment, the samples should be kept in dry boxes or further processed immediately.
Depending on the chemical structure of the desired inorganic component, the dried fibers may be pre-oxidized in air first, stabilized in an inert atmosphere at lower temperatures between 220 and 450 °C, or directly subjected to carbonization at high temperatures. Metal-carbon nanofibers can be prepared in one-step heat treatment directly after electrospinning.67 When synthesizing oxide-based carbon composites, if the oxygen content in the precursor salts is high enough, oxygen-deficient composites can be easily prepared after direct annealing without any severe structural changes.88 However, when synthesizing more complex oxygen-rich compounds, utilizing oxygen-free precursors (with weak oxidizing properties), or aiming for lower carbon contents, a pre-oxidation step is required.44,61,68 According to Kim et al., atomic reorganization of PVP starts at 210 °C, combustion of PVP occurs in the O2 atmosphere at 290 °C and thermal decomposition of the polymer starts at 350 °C.73 Hieu et al. and Szilágyi et al. concluded that complete thermal decomposition of PVP approximately occurs at 450 °C.89,90 Therefore, this step is conducted at different temperatures of 280–425 °C mostly in air for 1–4 h to adjust the carbon content and structure.41,44,71
After that, the stabilized fibers are heat-treated at higher temperatures starting from 500 °C in an inert or reduced atmosphere, sometimes in a vacuum, to convert the oxidized precursors into the final product and carbonize the stabilized PVP. The temperature is chosen based on the decomposition behavior of precursors and the desired crystal structure of the final product. For example, PVP-derived CNFs along with the titanium tetraisopropoxide precursor were annealed at 550 °C and 900 °C to derive anatase and rutile structures respectively.91 The elimination of organic byproducts in the forms of different gases during the carbonization of PVP provides fibers with a wide-size-range of pores, which is favorable for many different applications. Depending on the heat treatment conditions, N-doped carbon can be obtained (Fig. 5). The types of nitrogen in the structure include graphitic, pyridinic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen. Graphitic nitrogen enhances the conductivity of fibers, while other types of nitrogen are responsible for their functionality.92
4. Application of electrospun PVP-derived CNFs
4.1. Lithium batteries
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the energy storage system of choice for various applications, including consumer electronics, owing to their high energy and power density, light weight, and compactness.93 Despite the relatively higher energy density, the current demand for energy lies far beyond the capacity of commercially available LIBs, which are limited by their electrode materials.94,95 Additionally, advanced LIBs must possess a long cycle life, environmental friendliness, and safety. Therefore, when such batteries are designed, a consecutive development of all battery components, especially the improvement of both positive and negative electrode materials, is required.
The main issue associated with developing new-generation energy storage systems is the low electronic and ionic conductivities of theoretically high-performance electrode materials. The application of the 1D structure, in combination with large pores and conductive carbon, can potentially solve these problems, as it enhances the electrolyte-active material contact area providing abundant sites for electrochemical reactions, shortens the Li+ ion diffusion pathway along their cross-section, and speeds up the electron transfer.96–99 Using highly soluble PVP allows the preparation of composites with a high content of the inorganic component formed during the conversion of uniformly distributed precursors without any aggregation. It leads to the higher cycle performance of the composites, as the electrode material keeps its structure for long cycling.98 Furthermore, PVP-derived carbon composite nanofibers, when properly treated, can be used as a free-standing electrode without additional conductive carbon and inactive, bulky binders. The elimination of the metal current collector also makes electrodes lighter and the overall gravimetric capacity higher.100 The thickness of the fiber mat can be easily controlled by electrospun volume.

4.1.1 Anodes. 
Li metal was considered an ideal anode material due to its high theoretical capacity of 3860 mA h g−1. However, safety problems caused by dendrite formation during continuous cycling restricted its wide application. Graphite is used as a safe anode material since the first commercialization of rechargeable LIBs in 1991.101 Its reversible capacity of 372 mA h g−1 used to be enough for coupling with cathode materials of that time. On the other hand, rapidly growing technologies and energy demands require new battery systems with higher capacity, higher energy density, and safety. Therefore, many efforts have been made to investigate and develop new anode materials to meet the above requirements. The reported electrospun PVP-derived anode materials so far include pure CNFs, metal or Si-dispersed CNFs, and carbon composites of Li4Ti5O12, different oxides, sulfides, and selenides (Table 3).

After setting appropriate heat treatment conditions, pure PVP-derived CNFs of extremely high specific surface area possess some electrochemical activity towards lithium ions with a low reversible capacity of about 215 mA h g−1.41 On the other hand, when heat treatment conditions are changed on account of getting desired inorganic components, the specific surface area drops and pure carbon becomes inactive.44 However it is challenging to compare the electrochemical properties of pure and composite CNFs due to drastic differences in physical properties. The performance of pure PVP-derived CNFs as an anode for LIBs could be improved by adding metal acetates into the electrospinning solution aiming for impregnation or complete removal of metals after the heat treatment.34,35,42,102
Despite some successful structural manipulations on CNFs, their capacity is still lower than that of the alloying Si anode (4200 mA h g−1). On the other hand, Si is restricted by high volume variation during lithiation/delithiation processes (∼300–400%) and construction of an unstable solid electrolyte interface film (SEI). Encapsulating it into CNFs may accommodate and buffer the volume expansion.36,87 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on high-performance Si/C utilizing electrospun PVP as a sole carbon source yet.
SiO2 and transition metal oxides, being conversion-alloying-, conversion- or intercalation-type anodes, have moderate theoretical capacities, possess lower volume expansion, and form a more stable SEI layer compared to alloying anodes. PVP-derived carbon coating of these materials by electrospinning is admitted to address electronic and ionic conductivity issues and simplify the synthesis procedure. Apart from simple carbon coating, using PVP allows the formation of functional oxygen defects and oxycarbides.44,66,100 Wang et al. prepared SnO2/PCNFs and Sn/PCNFs just by varying the annealing temperature.65 The reduction of SnO2 to Sn at higher annealing temperatures also led to the change in the morphology and microstructure. However, as seen in Fig. 6, both samples preserved their initial structure well even after long cycling. The SnO2/PCNF electrodes underwent a gradual capacity decrease, which stabilized at 685 and 424 mA h g−1 after 160 cycles at 200 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. In contrast, the Sn/PCNF electrodes showed higher capacity retention at higher current densities, delivering stable discharge capacities of 700 and 550 mA h g−1 at 200 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. It could be attributed to the structure of carbon annealed at 500 °C and the lower electrical conductivity of SnO2 compared to Sn.

Metal chalcogenides, such as SnS and SnSe, have higher electronic conductivity than oxides. While one could be prepared by mixing SnCl2·2H2O with Se in the DMF dispersion, the synthesis of SnS required an additional vulcanization step after the pre-oxidation of SnCl2/PVP precursor fibers.70,103 Nevertheless, PVP-derived synthesis and electrochemical properties of conversion-type anodes beyond transition metal oxides have not been widely studied yet.


4.1.2 Cathodes. 
From the first commercialization of LIBs in 1991 by Sony, many different structures and materials have been proposed and investigated to overcome the drawbacks of the battery caused by positive electrodes or cathodes. The cathode is the crucial element of the battery, and it is also the most expensive part.112 The main requirements for new generation cathode materials are as follows: low cost, environmental friendliness, an abundance of precursors in nature, electrochemical stability to the electrolyte solution, high capacity, and high energy density. Among different compounds as alternative cathode materials for implementation in next-generation lithium-ion batteries, polyanions (LixMy(XO4)z, where X: nonmetal element, such as P, S, B, and Si; M: transition metal) stand out as promising electrode materials due to their moderate theoretical capacities over 300 mA h g−1 (vs. practical capacity of 140 mA h g−1 for commercial LiCoO2) or high working potentials over 4.6 V (vs. 3.8 V for LiCoO2).113,114 Furthermore, stable and robust frameworks with strong covalent bonds of polyanions ensure their superiorities of high thermodynamic stability, small volume changes, and long cyclability.16 The main limiting factor of such materials, hindering the realization of their full potential, is low electronic conductivity.115 When designing CNF-based materials to overcome this problem, the content of carbon is crucial, as it should be uniform and thin enough to provide sufficient electronic conductivity without compromising the diffusion of lithium ions.61 In the reported literature on electrospun PVP-derived cathode materials, it varies from 4 to 27 wt% (Table 4).

The most widely studied electrospun PVP-derived cathode material is olivine LiFePO4/C composite nanofibers.40,116–121 To the best of our knowledge, Chen et al. made the first attempt at using PVP as a carbon source for the electrospinning synthesis of LiFePO4 with the addition of citric acid by direct annealing at high temperature in a reducing atmosphere without prior oxidation.116 The composite containing 5.3 wt% carbon exhibited 94% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Cao et al. attributed the improved electrochemical properties of the PVP-derived LiFePO4/C composite nanofibers to the alignment of the crystal structure along the 010 direction, which shortened the Li+ ionic pathway as much as possible.121 Furthermore, according to later studies, PVP allows more complex structural manipulations by simply changing the composition of the precursor solution. Thus, conductivity-improver and SEI-catalyzer Ag could be easily incorporated into LiFePO4/C nanofibers by adding AgNO3 to the electrospinning solution.40 On the other hand, FeS with comparably high conductivity can be composited with LiFePO4/C by simply changing the Fe source from Fe(NO3)3 to FeSO4.120
Another olivine cathode impregnated with PVP-derived CNFs is LiCoPO4. Thus, embedding LiCoPO4 nanoparticles in carbon nanofibers improved the electrochemical performance by enhancing the initial capacity up to 115 mA h g−1 from 77 mA h g−1 at 0.1C for bare LiCoPO4 microspheres prepared by spray pyrolysis. Furthermore, to protect against the electrolyte-induced degradation of LiCoPO4, the SiO2 layer could be applied by adding tetraethyl orthosilicate to the electrospinning dispersion.61
Other fibrous polyanion compounds can also be successfully synthesized using PVP as a carbon source.88,122 However, careful selection of the precursors is essential to obtain the desired material. Thus, different manganese sources resulted in different annealing products.44


4.1.3 Lithium–sulfur batteries. 
Lithium–sulfur batteries, where elemental sulfur is used as the cathode material, have attracted considerable attention due to their high energy density, originating from the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mA h g−1) with a satisfactory operating potential of 2.1 V (vs. Li/Li+).92,123 In addition, the low cost, environmental friendliness, and natural abundance of their components make these batteries a promising energy-storage solution for sustainable development.124–126
In the lithium–sulfur battery, the cycling always starts from the discharging process. The reduction and lithiation of sulfur lead to the multi-step formation of lithium sulfide, releasing current to the outer circuit. Despite the high theoretical capacity, the sulfur cathode suffers from joint problems of most electrode materials, including extremely low electronic and ionic conductivities and volume change during cycling. Furthermore, additional issues such as polysulfide dissolution in the liquid electrolyte and their shuttle to the anode side, and self-discharge hinder the practical application of sulfur-based materials.126–129 Different research groups applied PVP-derived carbon composite nanofibers as a sulfur host, synthesized Li2S directly or mixed with the as-prepared composite, or inserted as an interlayer between the cathode and separator to prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and enhance the electrochemical properties (Table 5). The main advantage of using PVP here is the formation of abundant pores of different diameters (micro-, meso-, and macro-pores) during its decomposition. These pores provide more active sites for sulfur adsorption, improve the sulfur loading and electrolyte penetration into the carbon structure, and allow smooth electrolyte transport enhancing active material utilization.130

Liao et al. constructed TiN/C nanofibers as free-standing sulfur hosts by an electrospinning method using PVP.38 The designed TiN/C exhibited high polysulfide adsorption ability, a catalytic effect on the conversion of polysulfides into the final electrochemical products, and Li2S nucleation. These properties mainly originate from the unique morphology and microstructure of the material (Fig. 4(c)). As a result, for the TiN/C@S cathode with 10.5 mg cm−2 sulfur loading, a high reversible capacity of 790 mA h g−1 was obtained at 0.2C. The corresponding areal capacity was as high as 8.3 mA h cm−2, which is double that of the current LIBs (4 mA h cm−2).
Yu et al. developed a Li2S paper electrode (Li2S@NCNF) with high mass and capacity loading for lithium–sulfur batteries from Li2SO4 by carbothermal reduction with PVP.131 The prepared paper with a uniform, smooth fibrous morphology, containing 55 wt% Li2S, demonstrated excellent flexibility and mechanical properties. High Li2S loading on the electrodes could be obtained by simply layer-by-layer stacking of the Li2S@NCNF papers. Cells with high mass loadings exhibited excellent electrochemical properties even when bent (Fig. 7).

Another approach to improving the electrochemical performance of lithium–sulfur batteries is a coating on the separator or inserting free-standing interlayers between the sulfur cathode and separator.132,133 The free-standing interlayers are easily subjected to ex situ characterization, allowing a complex study of their possible effect mechanisms, which are illustrated in Fig. 8. First of all, the PVP-derived interlayers serve as a physical barrier against the shuttle of dissolved polysulfides into the lithium anode. Next, the N-doped conductive carbon of the interlayer functions as a second current collector and provides an additional electronic path. In contrast, oxygen-containing polar inorganic compounds improve the interlayer wettability, create an additional ionic path for Li+ to the sulfur cathode, and provide active sites for polysulfide chemisorption. The designed interlayers catalyze the further electrochemical conversion of polysulfides and allow the efficient utilization of the active material.68,92

The insertion of the PVP-derived free-standing interlayer has been proven effective not only in lithium–sulfur batteries but also in lithium batteries with other sulfur-based cathode materials, such as S-rich CuS.134 The insertion of the carbon fiber paper as an interlayer stabilized the fluctuating charge capacity by preventing the shuttle of lithium polysulfides.

4.2. Other energy storage systems and beyond
LIBs are commonly used and are the most reliable source of energy storage, for now; however, the uneven distribution of Li resources limits their further development. As shown in Table 6, other energy storage systems, that utilized PVP-derived CNFs, include Na-, Mg- and K-based batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.

Na-ion batteries (SIBs) are being researched owing to their low cost and abundance of resources.137 However, the size of the Na+ ion is larger than that of the Li+ ion, making it harder to find an appropriate host material with reversible sodium storage.138,139 Furthermore, the volume expansion of anode materials after sodiation is also larger than after lithiation. N doping and defect-rich sites in the PVP-derived CNFs are believed to accelerate the Na+/e− transmission and buffer the volume expansion (Fig. 9).140 As a result, high capacities and excellent cyclic performance were observed both for the sodium-storage anode and cathode. Although some PVP-derived electrode materials were used both in LIBs and SIBs,69,70,103 SIB-specific electrodes were designed less. These materials mainly include graphene, metal oxides, and chalcogenides due to their high theoretical capacities.

Abundant pores of different sizes and hierarchical structures of PVP-derived CNFs could potentially serve as a good base for the development of new anode materials for SIBs. The formation of impurities was unavoidable during the attempt to synthesize the NaTi2(PO4)3/C cathode. Despite this fact, due to the uniform conductive carbon coating, high capacity retention was achieved. On the other hand, a sufficient content of oxygen is important for the structural stability and sodiation reversibility of most of the promising SIB cathodes,141 which is challenging considering the reducing nature of PVP.
Nevertheless, PVP has assisted the synthesis of a vast range of materials for different applications far beyond energy storage, including photocatalysts for H2 production, dye removal, drug release, and wastewater treatment, thermal protection materials, high-temperature electrodes, lightweight microwave absorbing material, etc. (Table 7).

Coupling several materials is beneficial for improving the photocatalytic properties of semiconducting materials and applying water-soluble PVP as a polymer template allows the facile synthesis of such composites.150 Furthermore, free-standing conductive PVP-derived CNFs facilitate the high performance of semiconductors in different kinds of sensors.33 The possibility of PVP to form carbides after high-temperature annealing was also efficiently utilized in a broad range of applications.
Overall, the role of PVP as a carbon source in the improved performance of the developed CNFs can be summarized as follows:
(1) serving as a carrier to promote the dispersity of the inorganic precursors;
(2) controlling the favorable growth orientation of crystals within the CNF matrix;
(3) compatibilizing different precursors and pore-generating agents;
(4) making possible the synthesis of new materials of high theoretical capacity in a simplified way;
(5) creating a unique morphology, porosity, and microstructure during decomposition and carbonization.
5. Challenges and limitations in the application of electrospun PVP-derived CNFs
Although PVP-derived CNFs have shown promising properties for energy storage applications and beyond, there are also some challenges preventing their commercialization. First of all, PVP is a synthetic polymer that is not readily available in large quantities and has a relatively higher cost compared to non-polymer carbon sources. PVP itself has a relatively low carbon yield compared to other precursors, which can limit the production of large quantities of CNFs. Despite the numerous advantages of the electrospinning method, its scalability is another challenge, which may require further optimization to produce CNFs in large quantities with consistent quality.75,159 Furthermore, since PVP is soluble in water, it is highly sensitive to ambient moisture, whereas the difficulty of controlling the ambient parameters of an electrospinning process is present.
PVP begins to degrade and melt at relatively low temperatures, which can limit the range of processing conditions. Since the pre-oxidation step is sometimes needed to stabilize the fibrous structure, PVP-derived CNFs can have a relatively high oxygen content, which can limit the reversibility of electrochemical reactions.
Nevertheless, nowadays most alternative energy storage materials of high theoretical capability face complex challenges preventing their commercial application. Currently, common scalable methods are not suitable for the enhancement of the electrochemical properties of these materials. That is why alternative approaches, such as electrospinning techniques, are extensively studied with an initial focus on performance. We believe that the knowledge obtained during such studies will make the commercial application of reviewed carbon composite materials one step closer.
Overall, while PVP-derived CNFs have shown potential for various applications, further research is needed to address the challenges associated with their commercialization.
6. Conclusions and outlook
PVP has attracted a lot of attention as a low-cost and environmentally friendly electrospinning template, as it is soluble in many solvents, including water. Furthermore, firmly bound structures can be easily developed thanks to the possibility of the pyrrole group of PVP interacting with organic and inorganic compounds. It possesses several advantages as an ex situ and in situ carbon coating source, including the possibility to prepare composites with a high content of the inorganic component formed during the conversion of uniformly distributed precursors without any aggregations. The production of electrospun PVP-derived CNFs consists of three main steps: solution preparation, electrospinning itself, and heat treatments. Each production step has a great impact on the properties of the final products. Thus, when appropriate conditions are applied, advanced functional nanofibers can be easily synthesized for high-performance energy storage applications and beyond. Due to the strong reducing properties of PVP during annealing in an inert atmosphere, choosing appropriate precursors may be critical for the successful synthesis of the desired material. Furthermore, obtaining pure-phase materials with a certain oxidation state using PVP may be challenging. On the other hand, this reducing property of PVP could be efficiently utilized in the reduction of oxides, sulfates, and phosphates to oxygen-deficient structures or oxycarbides and carbides, sulfides, and phosphides. Abundant pores of different sizes and hierarchical structures of the PVP-derived CNFs could potentially serve as a good base for the development of new materials since water-soluble PVP as a polymer template allows the facile synthesis of complex composites of materials of different properties. On the other hand, in comparison with conventional PAN-derived CNFs, the synthesis of different functional nanofibers, using PVP as a carbon source, needs to be further extensively studied. For example, PVP-assisted synthesis and electrochemical properties of conversion-type anodes beyond transition metal oxides have not been widely studied yet.
The application of electrospun PVP-derived CNFs, in combination with large pores and conductive carbon, can potentially solve the main problems of most of the energy storage devices and beyond, as it enhances the electrolyte-active material contact area providing abundant sites for electrochemical reactions, shortens the ionic diffusion pathway along their cross-section, and speeds up the electron transfer. Furthermore, PVP-derived CNFs, when properly treated, can be used as a free-standing electrode without additional conductive carbon and inactive, bulky binders. The elimination of the metal current collector also makes electrodes lighter and the overall gravimetric capacity higher. As a result, new sustainable energy solutions are expected to be advanced to replace fossil fuels with green alternatives, which have minimal impact on the environment.
