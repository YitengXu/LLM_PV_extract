    , Accepted 27th June 2023First published on 28th June 2023AbstractThis work reports a significant improvement in both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and current density (J) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using gold nanorod-modified TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2/AuNRs) together with a cobalt-imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) as an efficient photoanode. It was demonstrated that adding ZIF-67 (8 wt%) to TiO2 NPs increased the VOC by 160 mV and J by 2.5 times. This observation was described based on the significant increase in the amount of adsorbed dye in the presence of highly porous ZIF-67, which boosts the photoanode's light harvesting. Modifying TiO2 NPs with AuNRs also caused a remarkable enhancement in J (∼ 2.8 times), which can be explained via electron transfer between the TiO2 conduction band and AuNRs. It can result in a more efficient inhibiting effect on the interfacial charge recombination processes in TiO2/AuNRs/ZIF-67 because of the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between TiO2 and Au. These effects were confirmed by the reduction in the photoluminescence intensity of TiO2 in the presence of AuNRs. More reduction in the photoluminescence intensity was observed when ZIF-67 was added. The prepared photoanode showed an outstanding improvement in the overall efficiency of the DSSC (η) to 8.38% compared to the bare TiO2-based photoanode (1.83%). The notable improvement in the TiO2/AuNRs/ZIF-67 performance confirmed its practicality for high-efficiency DSSCs.
Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most available and renewable sources of energy, which is projected to play a crucial role in providing the energy required by human beings in the future. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been recognized as a highly efficient and economical technique for constructing eco-friendly photovoltaic devices.1,2 Since the first report of a high-efficiency DSSC in 1991, investigations into these devices have been extended worldwide. This is mainly due to the outstanding advantages of DSSCs, such as their simple and cost-effective fabrication, substantial efficiency under indoor light conditions, and environmental friendliness, which inspire researchers to explore commercializing DSSCs. The highest efficiencies have been reported for photoanodes constructed with a nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconductor and sensitized with Ru-based complexes like N719.3,4 TiO2 is used as a semiconductor substrate for dye adsorption and charge transport. However, the high density of surface defects and therefore the increased interfacial charge recombination processes between TiO2 and the electrolyte/dye lead to the lessening of the photoanode efficiency, especially the open-circuit voltage (VOC). Thus, strategies to effectively inhibit interfacial charge recombination processes can lead to efficiency enhancements.5,6 Various materials have been tried to further enhance the performance of such devices. Efforts are being made to improve both VOC and short-circuit current (JSC), and obtain the maximum efficiency of DSSCs (η). The VOC of n-type TiO2-based DSSCs is commonly reported in the range of 0.7–0.8 V, which can limit further enhancements of the η values. The amount of adsorbed dye on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 is an imperative parameter to improve the performance of DSSCs. Therefore, increasing the active surface area for adsorbing dyes can be considered an effective way to provide superior efficiencies.6,7
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) represent one of the promising materials that have been introduced recently in DSSCs to improve their performance. As a kind of coordination polymer, MOFs are formed using certain metal ions and organic linkers. They can provide a highly porous crystalline structure with a substantial surface area and tunable nanosized pores and channels.8,9 These advantageous properties of MOFs have led to their widespread application in different fields. Li et al.10 have applied MOFs as efficient tools to enhance the VOC value of DSSCs due to their inhibiting effect on interfacial charge recombination. They reported a significant increase in the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2/ZIF-8 surface. However, the suppressing effect of the core/shell structure of TiO2/ZIF-8 on electron injection from dye molecules into the TiO2 conduction band decreased the JSC and power conversion efficiency (η). To address this deficiency, they introduced a post-treatment method to design TiO2/dye/ZIF-8/dye multiple layers.11 ZIF-67 is also a well-known MOF that can be simply constructed via the self-assembly reaction of Co2+ cations and 2-methyl imidazole ligands.12 With a high specific surface area, thermal stability, and appropriate pore sizes for the diffusion of the electrolyte, ZIF-67 is a good choice for use in DSSC manufacturing.
Furthermore, loading plasmonic nanostructures into semiconductors and their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) photosensitization offer a great opportunity to improve the performance of both photon absorption and charge transfer.13–16 Liu and coworkers showed an improvement in the visible light-harvesting of TiO2 by loading gold nanorods (AuNRs). This improvement was described in terms of electron injection into TiO2 from photoexcited Au, facilitating energy transfer.17 Additionally, both transversal and longitudinal plasmons of AuNRs could advance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, making them superior to spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Consequently, broadband visible-light harvesting over TiO2 can be expected by introducing AuNRs as antennas.17,18
Herein, ZIF-67 and AuNRs were simultaneously applied to improve the JSC and VOC for the TiO2-based photoanode. First, TiO2 semiconductor nanoparticles were loaded with citrate-capped AuNRs using mercaptoacetic acid as an efficient linker. Then, the TiO2/AuNRs composite was modified by ZIF-67 to obtain the final photoanode material (TiO2/AuNRs/ZIF), which was then characterized by different methods, especially high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The results showed appropriate attachment of the components. Furthermore, the prepared photoanode showed remarkable improvements in both JSC and VOC. The presence of ZIF-67 with a high surface area and a porous structure can improve the number of dye molecules that adhere to the surface of the photoanode. Additionally, the absorption of visible light by ZIF-67 may help to further improve the light-harvesting process. Thus, a notable increase in the performance of the TiO2/ZIF-67 photoanode was observed. On the other hand, loading AuNRs onto TiO2 NPs resulted in a further increase in JSC. The overall efficiency of the TiO2/AuNRs/ZIF photoanode showed an improvement of 360% compared to that of the bare TiO2 photoanode. The mechanism of this improvement is mainly attributed to the LSPR of AuNRs, as well as the high porosity and surface area of ZIF-67 (Fig. 1).

Experimental
Materials and apparatus
All the chemicals were of suitable grades for solar cell applications and no pretreatment process was required. Titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2, P25), iodine, lithium iodide, and 4-tert-buthylpyridine were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were obtained from Alfa Aesar (Germany). Mercaptoacetic acid (MCA) was purchased from BDH (England). Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, the dye N719, gold(III) chloride hydrochloric acid (HAuCl4), ascorbic acid, methanol, ammonia, ethanol, acetic acid, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 2-methyl imidazole (mIM), and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma (USA). Meltonix and FTO-coated glass (resistivity <10 Ω sq−1) were bought from Solarnix (Switzerland) and Techinstro (India), respectively.
Absorption and fluorescence experiments were performed using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer and a Duetta spectrometer (Horiba Scientific), respectively. Diffuse reflection spectra were obtained with a Lambda-90 diffuse reflection spectrometer (DRS, PerkinElmer). An EIS300 electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS, Gamry, USA) was applied to investigate the electrochemical impedance of the electrodes. A solar simulator (Sciencetech SS1, 6 KW, Canada) consisting of a Xe lamp (1000 W) and an AM1.5 filter, as well as a Keithley 2400 Source meter (Keithley Co. Ltd), was applied to investigate the current–voltage characteristics of the assembled cells.
The morphology and chemical structure of the prepared composites were investigated by different methods and instruments including a transmission electron spectroscope (HR-TEM, Zeiss Leo 906, Germany), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Scienta Omicron, Germany), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD, PANalytical's X’Pert PRO, UK, the excitation source was Cu Kα). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K using a BELSORP-miniII analyzer (Particle Test Pty Ltd, Bel Japan Inc., Japan) to check the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and the porosity of the nanocomposites.
Synthesis of the TiO2/AuNRs composite
Gold nanorods were prepared using the known seed-mediated procedure.19 Since the process was carried out in the presence of CTAB, the prepared AuNRs were covered by this surfactant. Thus, the product was first centrifuged at 8000 rpm (15 min) and the precipitated NRs were redispersed in deionized water. This step was repeated three times. The remaining CTAB on the surface of AuNRs was removed by dispersing the AuNR precipitate in a 0.1 M citrate solution. The mixture was centrifuged three times to obtain citrate-capped AuNRs. The citrate-capped AuNRs were then applied to prepare the TiO2/AuNRs composite. Briefly, TiO2 nanopowder (0.15 g) was dispersed in 2 mL deionized water, mixed with 0.2 mL ammonia solution (25%) and 0.3 mL MCA and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h. Then, 2 mL AuNRs was added to the solution and the stirring process was continued for another 24 h. The product was collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min) and dried at 50 °C (8 h).
Synthesis of ZIF-67
ZIF-67 was simply prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of Co2+ (10 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O dissolved in 4 mL deionized water) and mIM (50 mmol dissolved in 40 mL deionized water). The mixture was stirred for 2 min and then incubated at room temperature overnight. Following that, the precipitated purple product was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min and washed twice with deionized water. Finally, the obtained ZIF-67 was dried for 8 h at 50 °C.
Preparation of photoanodes
TiO2/AuNRs (0.12 g) and ZIF-67 (0.01 g) were mixed in 1 mL ethanol and stirred for 4 h. The obtained paste was applied to deposit a thin film on the conducting side of the FTO glass surface (cleaned by sonication in acetone) using doctor blading with meltonix tape as a spacer layer. The FTO electrode was first dried at room temperature followed by the calcination process at 370 °C (N2 atmosphere). Then, the FTO electrode was immersed in the N719 dye solution (0.3 mM in ethanol) for 6 h.
The dye-sensitized electrode was assembled with a platinum/FTO electrode to prepare the solar cell, with an effective cell area of 0.25 cm2. The iodide (0.5 M)/iodine (0.05 M) solution containing 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M) in acetonitrile was used as the electrolyte.
Results and discussion
Characterization
In recent years, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) photosensitization has been used to overcome the limited photo-conversion efficiency of TiO2-based photoelectrodes.15–17 According to some reports, certain metals, such as Au, can induce visible-light activity in the photo-conversion process due to their LSPR-induced electromagnetic fields and charge transfer between the semiconductor and the photoexcited metal.17,18 On the other hand, it has been shown that MOFs can provide a large surface for the loading of sensitizing dye10 and improve the light-harvesting process. Herein, to prepare the TiO2/AuNRs nanocomposite, we modified the surface of TiO2 NPs with MCA to initiate the self-assembly reaction of the thiol groups on the surface of AuNRs. Then, ZIF-67 was added to the TiO2/AuNRs assembly.
Fig. S1A–D (ESI†) show the TEM images of AuNRs with different aspect ratios of 2.3, 3.1, 3.4, and 3.7 (the aspect ratios of the prepared AuNRs were calculated by accounting for about 50 rods of each one). Two characteristic plasmon resonance absorption modes of AuNRs were observed in their UV-visible spectra that correspond to the transversal and longitudinal oscillation of the free electrons on the AuNRs (Fig. S2, ESI†). The first mode causes a resonance absorption peak around 520 nm, while the wavelength of the longitudinal resonance depends on the aspect ratio of AuNRs. The aspect ratios of 2.3, 3.1, 3.4, and 3.7 showed a redshift of the longitudinal resonance plasmon band appearing at 686, 724, 808, and 827 nm, respectively.19 Thus, the prepared corresponding composites with different AuNRs were denoted as TiO2/AuNR686, TiO2/AuNR724, TiO2/AuNR808, and TiO2/AuNR827, respectively.
Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the typical XRD patterns of AuNRs (prepared in the presence of 200 μL of AgNO3 solution) and pristine ZIF-67. The main diffraction peaks of AuNRs were located at 38.08° (111), 44.32° (200), 64.59° (220), and 77.60° (311), which were indexed to the face-centered cubic structure of Au metal. Furthermore, a lattice constant of a = 4.083 Å was calculated from the peak (111). The XRD spectrum of the prepared ZIF-67 was also in agreement with previous reports.20 The main diffraction peaks were located at 2θ values of 7.37°, 10.40°, 12.81° and 19.36° corresponding to the (011), (002), (112), and (222) planes, respectively.
The TEM images of the as-prepared TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF are shown in Fig. 2A and B, which demonstrate the simultaneous presence of TiO2 NPs (average diameter of ∼31 nm), AuNRs (average aspect ratio of ∼3.4), and ZIF-67 (size of ∼20–32 nm) particles. The TEM image shows a good interface and continuity between TiO2 NPs, AuNRs and ZIF-67, maximizing the contact areas and signifying a close interaction between the components. The high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM, Fig. 2C) illustrates the face-centered cubic crystal structure of AuNRs and the presence of the (111), (110), and (220) planes.21 This result is consistent with the XRD results. Besides, the lattice fringe of 0.35 nm observed in the HRTEM of TiO2 was correlated to the (101) crystal planes of anatase TiO2 (Fig. 2D).

According to the XRD results (Fig. 2E), the crystal structure of the TiO2 support was not affected by introducing AuNRs and ZIF-67. Herein, diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ values of 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.1°, 54.0°, 55.1°, 62.8°, 68.9°, 70.1°, 75.3° and 83.2° are assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), (215), and (303) crystal planes of anatase (JCPDS no. 21-1272), respectively.6 The diffraction peaks that appeared at 38.2° (111), 44.4° (200), and 64.6° (220) were related to bulk Au (JCPDS #04-0784). Moreover, the diffraction peaks of ZIF-67 were also observed at 7.37°, 10.40°, 12.81° and 19.36°, similar to the diffraction pattern of bare ZIF-67 (Fig. S3, spectrum b, ESI†). No excess impurity diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD pattern, further showing the high purity of the prepared samples.
XPS patterns were applied to determine the surface chemical composition. Fig. 2F shows the full survey XPS spectra of TiO2 NPs, TiO2/AuNR808, ZIF-67, and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF materials. The main elements in the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF product involve Ti, O, Au, Co, C, and N. The Ti 2p spectra of TiO2 NPs (Fig. 3A) can be deconvoluted into two Ti 2p1/2 (464.7 eV) and Ti 2p3/2 (458.9 eV) peaks of Ti(IV). Compared to bare TiO2 NPs, a blue shift was observed in the location of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of TiO2/AuNR808, specifying the modification of the Ti(IV) coordination environment probably because of electron/energy exchanges between AuNRs and TiO2 NPs. This result confirms the electron transferring process between TiO2 NPs and plasmonic AuNRs,22 which can facilitate the charge-transferring abilities of TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2/AuNRs/ZIF products. Furthermore, XPS experiments confirmed the metallic state of Au° in the prepared TiO2/AuNR808 (Fig. 3B). The XPS peaks related to Au 4f7/2 (83.8 eV) and Au 4f5/2 (87.7 eV) also moved to lower energies (83.5, 87.2 eV, respectively), which is potentially associated with the lower binding energy of Au 4f in the hybrid TiO2/AuNR808 hetero-structure due to electron transfer from oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 NPs to AuNRs.22,23 Mixing TiO2/AuNRs with ZIF-67 did not change the location of Ti, Au, or Co XPS peaks, showing that their chemical states are similar in both materials. The Co 2p of ZIF-67 was deconvoluted into two main components, attributed to the fully coordinated cobalt centers (Co-N4, 781.6 eV) and the unsaturated Co-Nx geometry (x < 4, 779.5 eV), respectively.24 The other two peaks are satellite peaks (Fig. 3C). The unsaturated Co sites are mainly located on the external surface of ZIF-67 or internal defect spots formed during the synthesis process.24,25 Finally, the main O 1s peak of TiO2 NPs located at 527.9 eV (bulk oxide O2−) was again shifted to lower (527.6 eV) energies after modification with AuNRs. The weak peak at 532.1 eV (adsorbed hydroxyl, OH) was also intensified and shifted to 531.8 eV. In TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF, three peaks were observed at 527.6 (bulk oxide O2−), 531.2 (hydroxyl, OH), and 532.6 (adsorbed OH) eV. The observed differences in the intensities of the OH peaks imply the presence of more hydroxyl groups on the surface of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF compared to the TiO2 NPs surface (Fig. 3D).

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4A, ESI†) indicated the higher surface area of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF assembly compared to both TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2 samples. The pure TiO2 NPs (19.6 m2 g−1) and TiO2/AuNR808 composite (35.1 m2 g−1) provide a minor BET surface area, however, the presence of ZIF-67 in TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF remarkably increased its surface area (260.7 m2 g−1). The pore-size distribution of the samples (Fig. 4B and Fig. S4B, ESI†) indicated the presence of meso-sized pores (8–10 nm) in TiO2 and TiO2/AuNR808 samples, while ZIF-67 contains micropores with an average size of 2 nm. The TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF sample also indicated the presence of both mesopores (centered mainly at ∼25–60 nm) and the ZIF-67 intrinsic micropores (∼2 nm) that strongly favor the accessibility of sensitizing dye molecules to active interfacial sites.

Optical properties
The formation of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF was further demonstrated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at room temperature. The optical properties of the prepared materials are shown in Fig. 5. Pristine TiO2 NPs showed a single sharp edge with the band gap absorption beginning at about 371 nm, corresponding to the band gap energy (Eg) of 3.35 eV (obtained by Eg = 1240/kmax, where kmax refers to the maximum absorption wavelength in the DRS spectrum) (Fig. 5). In the DRS spectrum of TiO2/AuNR808, not only the characteristic localized surface plasma resonance (LSPR) absorption peaks of AuNRs at 528 and 755 nm extended the light absorption of TiO2/AuNRs to the visible range, but also the absorption of TiO2 NPs in UV was strengthened and shifted to higher wavelengths, due to its band gap transition (3.16 eV) (Fig. 5B). This supports the conjugation between TiO2 NPs and AuNRs. Furthermore, two broad absorption bands of ZIF-67 at about 500–650 nm and 900–1300 nm were also revealed in the DRS spectrum of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF, further extending the visible light harvesting range of the final product. The DRS spectrum of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF covers almost the entire visible region as well as part of the near-infrared region (NIR). These results confirm the ability of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF to harvest light in the UV, visible, and NIR regions.

Since the charge carriers’ recombination can affect the photoluminescence (PL) emission, we recorded the PL spectra in order to study the efficiency of electron/hole trapping and migration rate and to comprehend the destiny of the electron–hole pairs. The spectra of TiO2 NPs TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF are shown in Fig. 5C (λex = 310 nm). Five distinct peaks can be seen in each spectrum, among them only one peak in the UV region with an energy that is approximately equal to the bandgap energy of TiO2.26 The emission peaks in the visible region are due to oxygen vacancies and defects in TiO2 NPs, which introduce new energy levels that act as shallow traps for electrons.27,28 The recovery mechanism starts with non-radiative electron transfer from the conduction band to these defect states, followed by radiative decay from the defect states to the valence band. Fig. 5C shows a decrease in the PL intensity of TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF, compared to that of TiO2 NPs alone. This decrease is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the TiO2 and AuNR junction to which the conduction band electrons are transferred and trapped, thus decreasing the rate of electron–hole recombination. The intensity decreases more in the presence of ZIF-67, indicating that electron trapping and charge separation are more efficient. A blue shift of ca. 4 nm was observed in the UV peak in the presence of AuNRs (from 395 to 391 nm). This shift can be attributed to the presence of AuNRs that reduces the available space for the excited conduction-band electrons,29 thus restricting electron–phonon interaction. A similar effect was also observed when the TiO2 particle size was decreased30,31 and when TiO2 NPs were doped with Pt.31
Photovoltaic performance
The photoanodes modified by the prepared composites were applied to DSSCs and their photovoltaic performances were assessed under simulated solar irradiation. As shown in the obtained J–V curves (Fig. 6), a significant enhancement was observed in the short-circuit current density of the TiO2/AuNR808 photoanode (14.66 mA cm−2) compared to the photoanode prepared with pristine TiO2 NPs (5.31 mA cm−2), however, the short-circuit voltage did not show a remarkable improvement. On the other hand, modifying the TiO2 NPs with ZIF-67 considerably boosted the VOC of the photoanode (0.79 V), and the JSC also increased up to about 13.50 mA cm−2 (Table 1). More improvements were observed in the simultaneous presence of both AuNRs and ZIF-67; the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF-modified photoanode showed VOC and JSC values of 0.8 V and 18.80 mA cm−2, respectively. These improvements led to an energy conversion efficiency of 8.38%, which was 4.5, 1.8, and 1.5 times higher than the efficiencies of pristine TiO2 NPs (η = 1.83%), TiO2/ZIF-67 (η = 4.62%) and TiO2/AuNR808 (η = 5.58%), respectively. Therefore, the higher performance of the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF-modified photoanode can be explained based on the synergetic effects of porous ZIF-67 and plasmonic AuNRs.32 The surface plasmon resonance effect of AuNRs and the electrons accumulated on their surface shift the Fermi level near the TiO2 conduction band.14,16 Therefore, the excited electrons in the AuNRs due to the SPR effect can easily be moved to the conduction band of TiO2 and reach the current collector (FTO). This phenomenon effectively improves the photocurrent under visible irradiation and boosts the conversion efficiency, because the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole is lessened due to the effective interfacial charge transfer between the TiO2 NPs and AuNRs. The results also proved that the improving effect of AuNRs on the efficiency of DSSC is remarkably higher than that of spherical AuNPs (Fig. 6). This is because of the more intensive longitudinal PSR effect of AuNRs. Successfully incorporating ZIF-67 into the TiO2/AuNRs can effectively increase the porosity and surface area of the obtained composite, as demonstrated by BET analyses. This effect improved the adsorption of the sensitizing dye (N719) on the surface of the photoanode, which was evident by the darker color of the electrode (Fig. 7A). The higher the amount of adsorbed dye, the more light-harvesting and the higher energy conversion efficiency. It is reported that ZIF-67 has a positive zeta potential (2.9–14.4 mV) within a wide pH range (7–10) and displays a high tendency to adsorb anionic dyes.33 Protonation of imidazolate groups on the surface of ZIF-67 particles facilitates the interactions between anionic dyes and ZIF-67.25 Besides, the uncoordinated Co2+ sites in the structure of ZIF-67 can interact with functional groups of dye molecules. So, the probable adsorption mechanism includes electrostatic and coordination interactions. Not only mesopores and micropores (25–60 nm and 2 nm, respectively) are present in the structure of TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF that facilitate dye access to active sites, but it also contains abundant active adsorption sites on its external surface,34 which attract dye molecules based on their specific functional groups.

The inset shows the equivalent circuit model for the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF modified DSSC. Rs, Rct and CPE represent the ohmic series resistance, charge-transfer resistance and constant phase element of the electrodes, respectively. 
Besides, the improvement of VOC in the presence of ZIF-67 is associated with its role as an energy barrier, which can suppress charge recombination in TiO2 NPs.10 Regarding the p-type semiconductor of ZIF-67 and the n-type of TiO2, the formation of a p–n heterojunction can be deemed between them that can effectively strengthen the separation of electrons and holes.35
AuNRs with different aspect ratios were applied to synthesize the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF composite and their effects were studied on the efficiency of the corresponding photoanodes. It was found that increasing the aspect ratio of AuNRs improves the efficiency of the corresponding DSSC and the highest efficiency was obtained by AuNRs with an aspect ratio of 3.4 (η = 8.38%). The AuNRs with a larger aspect ratio (3.7) slightly decreased the conversion efficiency (Fig. 6 and Table 1), which can mainly be attributed to their lower SPR effect (confirmed by low absorption intensity). Furthermore, the optimum percentage of ZIF-67 to prepare the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF composite was 8%; additional amounts of ZIF-67 resulted in consistently lower conversion efficiencies (Table S1, ESI†). This may be due to the blocking effect of excess ZIF-67 on the charge transfer between TiO2 NPs.
The interfacial charge transfer process in the prepared DSSC was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 7B). The Nyquist plots revealed the presence of a large semicircle in the low-frequency range, attributed to the resistance of the electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interface, and a small semicircle in the high-frequency range, associated with the Pt/electrolyte interface. The fitted equivalent circuit is displayed in the inset of Fig. 7B. Two charge-transfer resistances (Rct1 and Rct2) correspond to the large and small semicircles and the equivalent series resistance of the device (Rs) is also considered for the intersection of the high-frequency semicircle at the real axis. The calculated Rs values for TiO2, TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF were 7.6 Ω, 7.0 Ω, and 8.2 Ω, respectively. The presence of AuNRs led to a decrease in Rs, while the addition of ZIF-67 resulted in an increase. The corresponding Rct1 values for TiO2, TiO2/AuNR808, and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF were 77.7 Ω, 53.2 Ω, and 42.6 Ω, respectively. These findings suggest that the presence of AuNRs and ZIF-67 contributed to a lower Rct1 value, indicating more efficient electron transfer at the electrode and electrolyte interface. The reduced Rs and Rct1 values in the presence of AuNRs can be attributed to their high conductivity, which may explain the increased JSC observed in the corresponding DSSC. As indicated in Fig. 7B, the Nyquist plot displayed a decrease in both the imaginary (Z′′) and real (Z′) impedances when AuNRs and ZIF-67 were introduced, indicating their crucial role in facilitating charge transport and minimizing interfacial charge recombination. These results were consistent with the data obtained from the I–V measurements.
To determine the increased absorption intensity in the visible region and its enhancing effect on the efficiency of DSSC, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) analysis was conducted in the range of 375–950 nm (Fig. 8A). The main photocurrent responses for the pristine TiO2 NPs electrode were in the wavelength region 375–650 nm, corresponding to the absorption spectra of TiO2 NPs and N719 dye (absorption maxima at 390 nm and 531 nm, respectively). A significant improvement in the photocurrent response was observed for TiO2/AuNR808 modified electrodes in the same region. Surprisingly, a weak response was also created at 810 nm, which was similar to the longitudinal SPR of the applied AuNRs. This confirms electron exchange between TiO2 NPs and AuNRs via the SPR effect. A remarkable increase in IPCE value can be seen below 650 nm when ZIF-67 is present, which is consistent with its increasing effect on light-harvesting when more dye is loaded onto the sample. Also, the maximum response occurs at 500 nm, which is the same as in the absorption spectrum of ZIF-67. Therefore, ZIF-67 particles can also act as a sensitizer and participate in the light-harvesting process, further increasing the energy conversion efficiency. Despite a high absorbance, the TiO2/AuNR/ZIF electrodes showed a very weak light harvesting in the NIR region. The main absorption bands of TiO2/AuNR/ZIF are located at 500–650 nm and 850–1300 nm, which can be attributed to the higher-lying [4A2(F)–4T1(P)] and lower-lying [4A2(F)–4T1(F)] d–d ligand field transitions, respectively.36 Electrons located at the 4T1(F) energy level (excited in the 500–650 nm region) have enough energy to be transferred to the conduction bond of TiO2, and can participate in the energy conversion process. However, electrons in the 4T1(P) energy level (excited in the NIR region) have less energy and a low probability of being transferred to the TiO2 conduction band (Fig. S5, ESI†).
 Fig. 8  (A) IPCE spectra and integrated photocurrents of the DSSCs based on the TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF modified photoanode and sensitized with N719 dye and (B) the corresponding transient photocurrent responses [obtained using a white LED radiation source]. 
The JSC values were also calculated from IPCE. The obtained values were 5.37, 14.53 and 18.59 mA cm−2, respectively. These results clearly validate the I–V measurements.
Finally, the photocurrent response of the photoanodes was evaluated during some successive on–off light cycles to study the stability of the energy conversion process (Fig. 8B). The intensities of the photocurrent responses of all TiO2, TiO2/AuNR808, and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF modified photoanodes were similar in five successive cycles, confirming the high repeatability and stability of the conversion process. In addition, the photocurrents of TiO2/AuNR808 and TiO2/AuNR808/ZIF were higher than that of pristine TiO2, which indicates the inhibiting effects of AuNRs and ZIF-67 on the recombination of electron–hole, thus improving the efficiency of the separation of charge carriers.
Conclusions
Plasmonic AuNRs and high surface ZIF-67 were simultaneously used to modify TiO2 semiconductor NPs to prepare the TiO2/AuNR/ZIF composite with improved features. Characterization experiments confirmed the successful preparation process. The composite was then applied to prepare a photoanode, which led to notable enhancements in both JSC and VOC. This observation was described based on the synergistic effects of AuNRs and ZIF-67. The porous structure and high surface area of ZIF-67 improved the adsorption of the dye N719 on the photoanode surface, improving the light-harvesting process. Also, ZIF-67 can accept holes from the valence band of TiO2 NPs, improving the inhibition of the recombination of charge carriers. Besides, electron exchange between TiO2 and AuNRs leading to the formation of a Schottky barrier at their interface could further boost the inhibiting effect on the interfacial charge recombination processes in TiO2/AuNR/ZIF. The described mechanism and the improvement in the efficiency of the designed photoanode were verified by different analyses such as DRS, PL, EIS, and IPCE. The overall efficiency of the TiO2/AuNR/ZIF photoanode (8.38%) showed a significant improvement of 360% compared to that of the bare TiO2 photoanode (1.83%) and proved its practicality for high-efficiency DSSCs.
