    First published on 11th May 2021AbstractThe synthesis of nanomaterials, with characteristic dimensions of 1 to 100 nm, is a key component of nanotechnology. Vapor-phase synthesis of nanomaterials has numerous advantages such as high product purity, high-throughput continuous operation, and scalability that have made it the dominant approach for the commercial synthesis of nanomaterials. At the same time, this class of methods has great potential for expanded use in research and development. Here, we present a broad review of progress in vapor-phase nanomaterial synthesis. We describe physically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods including inert gas condensation, spark discharge generation, and pulsed laser ablation; plasma processing methods including thermal- and non-thermal plasma processing; and chemically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods including chemical vapor condensation, flame-based aerosol synthesis, spray pyrolysis, and laser pyrolysis. In addition, we summarize the nanomaterials produced by each method, along with representative applications, and describe the synthesis of the most important materials produced by each method in greater detail.

1. Introduction
Nanomaterials, as the building blocks of nanotechnology, have unique properties that can be used in numerous applications.1 Superparamagnetism,2–6 size-dependent photoluminescence,7–9 high specific surface area and surface curvature,10–13 nanoscale texturing,14–17 and reduced scattering of light,18–20 are just a few of many unique and interesting properties of nanomaterials. These properties, and others, make specific nanomaterials promising candidates for existing and emerging applications in biomedical,2,3,19 mechanical,10,14–16 bioseparation,4,11 optoelectronic,6 thermoelectric,5 bioimaging,18,20 catalytic,11,12 microelectronic,17 environmental,9,13 photocatalytic,8,13 and optical7,9 applications, in which they can often outperform the corresponding bulk materials. Nano-organization control through the development and application of nanosynthesis techniques, which is one of the main foci of this review, plays a substantial role in these applications, due to the size and morphology dependence of key properties of nanomaterials.21
One can categorize methods of the nanomaterial synthesis in many ways, but the most general is based on the state of the precursors from which the NPs are formed: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down methods include ball milling, electrochemical etching, photolithographic patterning, and other approaches that break or pattern larger materials to produce nanomaterials.22 In contrast, bottom-up methods start from atomic or molecular precursors.23 Two general subcategories can be considered for the bottom-up methods based on the phase in which nanomaterial synthesis occurs, namely solution-phase and vapor-phase. Particle formation in solution-phase methods is initiated by heating, by addition of a second precursor compound, or by addition of a reducing agent or other reactive species. Generally, in these methods, the precursor or mixture of precursors, which can be liquid or solid, reacts in liquid solution leading to nucleation and growth of solid particles. These primary particles can grow via surface reaction, and may aggregate. Many kinds of nanomaterials, especially metal nanocrystals and quantum dots are synthesized by solution-phase methods. Surfactants or ligands, molecules that bind to the nanoparticle (NP) surface, are used to control the growth of particles and limit the particle size. The most important solution-phase methods are sol–gel, hydrothermal, solvothermal, thermal decomposition, and micelle/reverse-micelle methods.24 In vapor-phase methods, precursors must be delivered as a vapor or as small droplets or particles that can be vaporized within the process. An energy source is generally required to initiate and sustain physical evaporation and/or chemical reaction in the vapor phase.25 The vapor phase should be supersaturated to drive the formation of a solid phase. At a sufficient level of supersaturation, nucleation occurs homogeneously. Often, this supersaturation is in the form of vapor-phase atoms or molecules present at a partial pressure above their vapor pressure. However, it can also take the form of “chemical” supersaturation, in which vapor-phase molecules are thermodynamically unstable relative to a solid that can form from them by chemical reaction. In any case, once particles have nucleated, the system should be rapidly quenched to stop particle growth and sintering. A wide range of materials can be synthesized by these methods, but non-toxic semiconductors and metal oxides have been particularly important. Vapor-phase methods can operate at much higher temperature and shorter reaction times than solution-phase methods, which allows crystallization of high melting point materials.26,27 However, solution-phase synthesis can directly produce a stable colloidal dispersion of the NPs, in which aggregation of particles does not occur. Ligands and surfactants can be used to control the size and shape of nanomaterials to a degree that is not generally possible in vapor-phase processes. Aerosols, dispersions of the product particles in a vapor, are inherently unstable, and primary particles invariably aggregate into larger clusters of particles. When this happens after quenching, it produces “soft” aggregates that can subsequently be broken up. However, when the particles become partially sintered into “hard” aggregates, the clustering is irreversible.28 Such aggregates may be desirable or undesirable depending upon the ultimate application. Table 1 compares key features of solution-phase and vapor-phase NP synthesis methods to concisely summarize the relative advantages and disadvantages of these broad categories of nanosynthesis. For those who may be less familiar with the terminology of vapor-phase synthesis and aerosol science and technology in general, a list of definitions of key terms is provided at the end of this review.

The main focus of this review is on vapor-phase processes for the synthesis of free-standing nanomaterials. Several rather comprehensive reviews of this field were published 15 to 25 years ago.27,29,30 More recent reviews have focused on particular subsets of vapor-phase synthesis methods or particular applications.31–38 Thus, a new review that takes a broad and relatively comprehensive approach, as presented here, is needed. That being said, there are some areas outside the scope of this review. The deposition of nanomaterials into films and growth of nanostructured films from the vapor phase is a very broad topic which we do not include, as is the literature on soot formation in flames, which we only touch on briefly. These and other aspects that we chose not to include are noted in relevant sections below.
To provide structure to this review, we categorize vapor-phase synthesis techniques into three classes of physically-based, plasma-processing-based, and chemically-based methods based on the similarity of chemical structures of the precursors to the final products. While this classification is only one of several possibilities, and there is some inherent overlap between categories, we believe it provides a valuable framework for organizing, comparing, and contrasting methods. Within this framework, we survey the history and recent advances in each method with a focus on the nanosynthesis technique and the pros and cons of each process. After initial introduction of each method, we consider the most important nanomaterials synthesized by each method in greater detail, to illustrate how to the method can be employed to drive interesting applications.
2. Vapor-phase production methods
Interest in vapor-phase (aerosol) nanomaterial synthesis is driven by several key advantages relative to solution-phase methods. The unavoidable impurities and liquid (solvent) wastes generated by solution-phase methods as well as the use of relatively expensive surfactants or ligands can be avoided in most vapor-phase methods. Production of nanomaterials without organic ligands on their surface can be particularly important for electronic applications. Complex structures such as high-temperature superconductors can be produced in the vapor phase, leveraging their ability to produce nanomaterials with complex compositions and crystal structure at high temperature. Vapor-phase methods are continuous, while solution-phase methods are usually conducted batch-wise. Continuous operation may enable improved control and reproducibility as well as productivity and scalability.29,39 There are various ways to categorize aerosol synthesis methods based on the energy source or based on the state of the precursors, but here we first classify the methods based on the similarity of chemical structure between the precursors and the product nanomaterials, into three classes of physically-based vapor-phase synthesis, plasma processing, and chemically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods. For example, if we produce silicon NPs from silicon wafers, that is a physically-based process, but if we use silane as the precursor, the method will be classified as chemically-based. Plasma processing methods can employ both types of precursors. Overlap among these categories is inevitable, but such classification is nonetheless useful.
2.1. Physically-based vapor-phase production methods
Physically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods are aerosol synthesis methods in which the product materials are of essentially the same composition as the precursors, or perhaps a simple compound (e.g. oxide) based on the precursors. In general, the main advantage of these methods is the synthesis of nanomaterials with a high degree of purity and the major disadvantage is the synthesis of small quantities of material per batch or per unit time. The most important methods that can be considered in this category are inert gas condensation (using conventional thermal evaporation, e-beam evaporation, or sputtering as the evaporation technique), spark discharge generation, and pulsed laser ablation.

2.1.1. Inert gas condensation. 
To achieve supersaturation in this technique, an inorganic material is heated to a temperature at which it will sublime or evaporate into an inert gas atmosphere at reduced pressure, typically 1–50 mbar. Mixing of this vapor with cooler gas induces nucleation by condensation. This method is suitable for producing metal nanomaterials because of their evaporation at acceptable rates at practical temperatures. However, outgassing due to undesirable heating of other reactor parts is a major disadvantage of the method. To produce oxides or non-oxide compounds, a reactive gas like O2 can be added to the cold inert gas. The type of inert gas, the gas pressure, and the vapor pressure of the evaporating materials can influence the particle size distribution, which critically depends on the residence time of the particles in the growth region of the process.29,30Table 2 provides a summary and Fig. 1 presents representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of materials synthesized using this approach.

2.1.1.1. Conventional inert gas condensation. 
2.1.1.1.1. Metals. 
Granqvist and Buhrman first developed the inert gas condensation (IGC) technique, using a temperature-controlled source in a low-pressure chamber to synthesize ultrafine metal NPs. They prepared oxide-coated Al NPs with average diameters from 3 to 6 nm, as well as Mg, Zn, and Sn NPs. A schematic of their process is shown in Fig. 2. They employed a chamber that was initially under ultra-high vacuum (∼2 × 10−6 Torr). They placed an alumina crucible in a stand-off position and heated it radiatively with a graphite element and a temperature controller with a maximum power of 20 kW. They introduced UHP Ar as the inert gas at a pressure of 0.5 to 4 Torr. In addition, they used a rotary water-cooled plate to collect the product NPs. By introducing oxygen during evaporation of Al, they grew Al2O3 as an insulating coating around the Al NPs.40

Birringer and Gleiter were also pioneers of the IGC method. Their work, like much early work on IGC, focused on producing bulk samples of nanocrystalline metals with improved or novel mechanical properties, e.g., deformation behaviour, compared to conventional metals. In one important study, they employed IGC to synthesize Fe NPs. To do so, they used helium as the inert gas at a pressure as low as 2 kPa and a tungsten heater to produce what they called a “gas-like solid” of Fe NPs with average diameter of about 6 nm.41 Nieman et al. used the same strategy to synthesize Cu and Pd NPs with average diameters below 10 nm, which they pressed into dense nanocrystalline samples. They observed four and two times increase in microhardness of nanocrystalline Pd and Cu pellets, respectively, compared to coarse-grained samples.42,43 In addition, they studied the tensile strength and creep properties and found the yield strength of nanocrystalline-grained materials increased substantially compared to the coarse-grained counterparts. They found no evidence of room temperature diffusional creep for the nanocrystalline material.43,44
Weertman's group developed a new IGC system to improve the powder purity and increase the density of the final nanocrystalline metal samples.45 A schematic is presented in Fig. 3. They decreased the system base pressure and made other engineering improvements that allowed them to reload the boat without opening up the chamber. Their efforts enabled synthesis of Pd NPs with hydrogen level and Cu NPs with oxygen level of less than 5 at%. These were compacted into solids that reached 98% of the bulk density and exhibited improved elastic and tensile behaviour.45,46

Rösner et al. worked on the IGC synthesis of Pd NPs, particularly focusing on the mechanical properties of the compacted nanocrystalline metals produced from them, and the mechanisms underlying these improved mechanical properties. They found extensive deformation twinning on (1 1 1) planes of the nanocrystalline materials.47 In addition, they investigated deformation mechanisms at large strain in the nanocrystalline Pd samples produced by compaction and found that for grains of less than 40 nm in characteristic dimensions, the deformation was controlled by a grain boundary-meditated process through twinning, dislocation slip, and grain boundary diffusion while it was controlled by a dislocation slip mechanism for grains of larger size.48
IGC-synthesized metal NPs have also been studied for their antibacterial properties. Baker et al. investigated the antibacterial properties of silver NPs synthesized by IGC and demonstrated antibacterial effects at low concentrations that were related to the total surface area of the NPs. They concluded that NPs with higher surface to volume ratio are more effective for antibacterial applications.49 Raffi et al. studied the antibacterial behaviour of Cu NPs with an average size of 12 nm synthesized by IGC and reached a similar conclusion.50
2.1.1.1.2. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Löffler et al. investigated the magnetic properties of IGC-synthesized Fe and Ni NPs and found that the magnetic properties of the NPs were affected by the grain size.65 Signorini et al. also worked on the IGC synthesis of magnetic NPs. To produce Fe/FeyOx core–shell NPs, they evaporated 99.98% pure Fe as the target in a UHP He atmosphere in a chamber with a base pressure of 10−5 Pa. After synthesis, they gradually introduced O2 to passivate the particle surfaces, reaching a pressure of 133 Pa after about 1 hour. Finally, they exposed the NPs for 24 hours to an atmosphere of 1.2 kPa of He. The oxidation process created an iron oxide shell. They controlled the average size of the NPs by adjusting the evaporator heating current to change the evaporation rate. Accordingly, they produced core–shell NPs with core average sizes from 7 to 21 nm, with oxide shells of 2–3 nm thickness. The shell comprised two phases: magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (Fe2O3). Upon decreasing the dimensions of the core, maghemite became the dominant phase in the shell, as shown in Fig. 4.68 Baker et al. investigated the magnetic behaviour of Fe/Fe-oxide core/shell NPs synthesized by IGC and found an increase in coercivity with increased oxide thickness, both for NPs dispersed in a polymer and for NPs compressed into a dense pellet.67

Friedrichs et al. synthesized Mg NPs by IGC, with an average size of 40 nm and a 3–4 nm thick layer of MgO that helped to prevent further oxidation. For this purpose, they used resistive heating of Mg foil to 973 K in 3 Torr He in a chamber with a base pressure of 10−8 Torr.51 Calizzi et al. produced Mg–Ti NPs buy IGC with in situ hydrogenation at 150 °C and investigated their hydrogen storage activities. They evaporated 99.9% Mg ingots and 99.9% Ti powder in separate Joule-heated tungsten boats in a chamber with a base pressure of 10−7 mbar under a He flow rate of 7.0 sccm and pressure of 2.7 mbar. The He flow passed the hotter Ti source after the Mg source and finally reached the liquid N2-cooled rotating collection cylinder. Subsequently, the products were exposed to H2 in Ar for about 1 hour at a H2 partial pressure of 133 mbar and 150 °C to hydrogenate both Mg and Ti. They found that Mg–Ti NPs exhibited better hydrogen storage performance than MgH2 using Nb2O as a catalyst.57
Singh et al. produced Tb75Fe25 NPs by IGC in the apparatus presented in Fig. 5. First, they used arc melting of a mixture of Tb and Fe in an argon atmosphere to prepare an ingot of Tb75Fe25 alloy. Thereafter, they employed a resistively heated tungsten crucible in an IGC chamber under 5 mbar helium. They cold-pressed amorphous NPs to obtain nanoglass samples with improved magnetic, mechanical, and structural properties relative to the bulk alloy.103,104

Wang et al. employed a laser evaporation source to synthesize a CoCrFeNiMn nanocrystalline high-entropy alloy though what they termed an IGC technique, but could also be considered a laser ablation approach. The laser source was a 50 W Yb:YAG picosecond pulsed laser at 1064 nm and 500 kHz. They first cast a Co20Cr20Fe20Ni20Mn20 target by arc melting a mixture of the pure metals and drop casting into a water-cooled copper mold. The laser beam evaporated the target in 500 Pa helium to form nanocrystals of ∼25 nm mean diameter. They employed two units for compaction: a low-pressure unit applied a pressure of ∼500 MPa to make 10 mm diameter pellets, followed by a high-pressure unit that applied 5 GPa for 3 min at ambient temperature. The high vapor pressure of manganese led to it condensing after other materials, and produced a final composition of (CoCrFeNi)93.5Mn6.5. They found that the nanocrystalline material exhibited ultrahigh hardness with exceptional thermal stability; the hardness increased incredibly from 484 HV to 791 HV after 1 hour annealing at 600 °C and this high hardness was retained after heating to 1100 °C.73
2.1.1.1.3. Ceramic oxides. 
Production of ceramic oxide NPs and nanocrystalline bulk ceramics was also an important driver for development of the IGC method. In particular, nanocrystalline ceramics were expected to be less brittle than conventional ceramics, overcoming one of the major limitations of ceramic materials. Skandan used IGC to produce non-agglomerated ZrO2 NPs with average sizes from 4 to 14 nm. Skandan used UHP He as the inert gas at a pressure of 2 to 20 mbar and evaporated ZrO as the source, and then oxidized the NPs after deposition. Using monoxide as the source was preferable to using metal because oxidation of the monoxide to the oxide is much less exothermic than oxidation of the metal, allowing better control of the post-synthesis oxidation process.118 Guillou et al. synthesized nearly monodispersed CeO2 NPs of 3 to 3.5 nm diameter. They employed an ultra-high vacuum chamber and a background pressure of 1 kPa He. They analysed NPs from different parts of the chamber and found that the quality was uniform. They then annealed the NPs at temperatures from 400 to 800 °C. They found that at 600 °C, 25 to 30% of the NPs retained their initial size. A critical change occurred upon sintering at 800 °C, with development of two populations of crystallites.108
Skårman et al. investigated factors controlling growth, structure, and morphology of CuOx/CeO2 nanocomposites from IGC, as well as their activity as carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts. They employed resistive heating to evaporate pure cerium and copper granules with He as the inert gas in a UHV chamber with a base pressure below 10−9 Torr. They placed two or three tungsten crucibles simultaneously in the reactor. They found when the Cu crucible(s) were placed closer to the collection region than the Ce crucible(s), only very tiny clusters were produced before the onset of collision and aggregation with larger Ce clusters, which allowed them to achieve a high Cu dispersion on CeO2 and prevented the formation of bulk CuO during the subsequent oxygen treatment. They reported that the inert gas pressure and the composition of the composite had the most substantial effects on the morphology of the NPs. By tuning these parameters, they found that an inert gas pressure of 1.0 Torr provided the best conditions to control the particle growth and morphology of the NPs. Although the crystallite size changed substantially in the pressure range between 0.5 and 5 Torr, the particle size produced by the aggregation of the crystallites dramatically increased at pressures higher than 5 Torr. They considered CuOx/CeO2 nanocomposites in four groups of compositions. In the first group with Cu content below 6%, they reported two different particle shapes: amorphous rounded particle shapes and crystalline block particle shapes. For the second group with Cu content between 6 and 25%, the synthesized nanocomposites predominantly comprised monodispersed Cu particles on the surface of CeO2 aggregates, which is appropriate for CO adsorption. In the third group with Cu content between 25 and 70%, oxidation produced core–shell structures, explained in terms of sequential oxidation of Ce and Cu, with similar lattice expansion upon oxidation, which maintained high CuOx dispersion. Finally, for the fourth group with Cu content of more than 70%, they found amorphous aggregates with evenly distributed CeO2 crystallites that were insufficient for the appropriate dispersion and oxidation of Cu. In addition, they concluded that the CuOx/CeO2 catalyst system has improved low-temperature catalytic activity in carbon monoxide oxidization due to the interaction of CeO2 crystallites with a fast reversible redox process of superficial Cu(I)/(II) couples.96,97
2.1.1.2. Ion sputtering. 
2.1.1.2.1. Non-oxide metal-containing nanomaterials. 
Hahn and Averback created Al, Mo, Cu91Mn9, Al52Ti48, and AlN NPs using IGC with DC magnetron sputtering of the appropriate targets, rather than thermal or e-beam evaporation. Some of these (Mo, Cu91Mn9, and Al52Ti48) could not be synthesized by conventional thermal evaporation. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 6. The reactor had three main parts: the sputter source, a collection cold finger, and a scraping device. Because of its small sputtering yield, they were not able to use He as the inert gas for the synthesis. For the pure metals (Mo and Al) they used DC power of up to 1200 W and currents of 2 and 4.5 A which corresponded to voltages in the range of 200 to 400 V. NPs were synthesized at Ar pressures in the range of 0.3 to 2 mbar. Sputtering of Mo and Al targets under these conditions produced NPs with average sizes of 20 and 30 nm, respectively. They synthesized Cu NPs with an average size of ∼15 nm at Ar pressures from 0.1 to 1 mbar and sputter currents of 0.5 to 3 A. If we consider the vapor pressures at evaporation temperatures (1300 °C for Cu and Mn and 1800 °C for Ti and Al) of Cu (4.0 Pa), Mn (400 pa), Ti (40 Pa), and Al (5320 Pa), we can understand that conventional thermal evaporation methods are not appropriate for the synthesis of CuMn (with magnetic properties of interest) and TiAl (with useful high-temperature mechanical properties) alloys. With their sputtering IGC method, they synthesized nanocrystalline Cu91Mn9 and Ti48Al52 with average sizes from 7 to 14 nm and 20 nm, respectively. Furthermore, they produced AlN NPs in an Ar–N2 atmosphere.52

Chang et al. used the same strategy as Hahn and Averback to synthesize TiAl NPs. Instead of a conventional thermal evaporation system, they used magnetron sputtering to vaporize a Ti42Al58 target disc at 220 V and 4.0 A. The processing chamber was evacuated to 2 μPa then backfilled to 70 Pa with a 1:1 mixture of Ar and He. This allowed them to produce nanocrystalline TiAl NPs with average diameters between 10 and 15 nm at a production rate of 20 to 40 mg h−1.58
Weertman's group synthesized Al–Zr alloy NPs using an electron beam as the source of energy to achieve higher temperatures for evaporation. The compacted Al–Zr nanocrystalline alloy had impressively low creep rates.78
Yamamuro et al. synthesized Cr NPs with average size between 7.6 and 13 nm by a combination of IGC and glow-discharge sputtering and investigated the effects of pressure and gas flow rate on the NP size distribution. They used flows of 200 to 1000 sccm, and the pressure of the system increased with increasing gas flow (from 120 to 360 Pa). At low flow rates of 200 sccm (120 Pa) to 400 sccm (170 Pa) sccm, they produced monodispersed Cr NPs. Upon increasing the flow rate to 600 sccm (280 Pa) or more, the monodispersity of the NPs decreased, and two modes of the size distribution, centered at 5 and 20 nm, were observed, suggesting two different mechanisms of particle growth at those flow rates. At higher pressure, nucleation occurs near the sputtering source at a relatively high rate, while at lower pressure, nucleation occurs nearer the collection surface. Fig. 7 shows TEM images of the Cr NPs produced using various Ar flow rates.63

Pérez-Tijerina et al. investigated factors that affect the size of Au/Pd NPs prepared by IGC with magnetron sputtering. They were able to synthesize NPs with a very narrow size distribution by controlling both the magnetron power and chamber atmosphere. They used 99.99% pure Au50Pd50 alloy as the target and studied the effect of four factors on the size of the NPs: (a) type of inert gas (He or Ar), with Ar leading to faster erosion of the metal target, higher supersaturation of metal vapor, and larger NPs; (b) pressure (0.1 to 0.2 Torr), showing increasing NP size with increasing pressure, (c) magnetron power (32 to 130 W), with increasing power first increasing the size of NPs then saturating, and eventually slightly decreasing, and (d) length of condensation zone (50 to 130 mm), with particle size increasing as the distance, and therefore aggregation time, increased. They optimized these parameters to generate monodispersed NPs of 1.1, 3.0 and 5.0 nm diameter with a uniform (not core–shell) structure.98
Mattei et al. synthesized trimetallic Au–Pt–Pd NPs, as candidates for heterogeneous catalysis applications, by placing Au, Pd, and Pt targets side by side on an integrated magnetron-sputtering head in an equilateral triangle formation (Fig. 8). For the samples with significant amounts of all elements, they found Au/Pt-rich core@Pd-shell structures due to a fundamental difference between Pd and Au/Pt growth dynamics. Au/Pt electronic structures drive formation of dimer nuclei and this will reduce their growth rate, while larger Pd particles grow faster and surround small Au and Pt clusters.117

Soganci et al. made copper NPs with an average size below 5 nm by DC magnetron sputtering into an Ar/He atmosphere. They dispersed the NPs on a single-layer graphene film to create a non-enzymatic biosensor for glucose detection. The resulting device exhibited excellent performance based on their electrochemical investigations.80
Yang et al. produced metastable Au–Cu bimetallic NPs with a narrow size distribution and controlled shape and composition by IGC with magnetron plasma sputtering. They employed a sputtering current of 60 mA with an Ar flow of 60 sccm and controlled the NP composition by adjusting power applied to each target. They characterized NPs by a combination of TEM and atom probe tomography (APT). TEM analysis showed bimetallic NPs with various non-equilibrium shapes and structures. Fig. 9(a)–(f) presents the TEM analyses of Au–Cu NPs, Fig. 9(g) shows EDX composition maps for three individual Au–Cu NPs, and Fig. 9(h) shows a schematic of the composition distribution of the NPs. Although the composition mapping by TEM-EDX was mostly qualitative, the APT analysis yielded deeper information on the NP composition. For the NPs below 4 nm diameter, copper was an alloying element that stabilized the Ih structure and was randomly distributed, while it segregated to the surface to form a Cu-rich shell on larger particles. This dual-characterization technique is a powerful approach to reveal multiple characteristics of the NPs, including structure, size, composition, and the variation of these characteristics with IGC process parameters.99

2.1.1.2.2. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Stappert et al. employed IGC to synthesize FePt NPs. They used DC sputtering at a power of 250 W to vaporize Fe55Pt45 alloy and produce FePt NPs with an average size from 3 to 30 nm. They studied the effects of inert gas (Ar and He) pressure and sintering temperature on the morphology and crystal structure of the FePt NPs. The FePt NPs were monodispersed with no sign of agglomeration at 0.5 mbar, but showed a broad particle size distribution and evidence of agglomeration above 1.0 mbar. Icosahedral particles were produced at 0.5 mbar and retained their structure at temperatures up to 1273 K. However, single crystalline particles with L10-ordering formed at pressures higher than 0.5 mbar.106
Zhao et al. employed IGC with magnetron sputtering of a 99.9% Fe target to generate Fe nanocubes. They used magnetron powers of 50, 70, and 100 W which corresponded to sputtering currents of 200, 300, and 400 mA, respectively. They controlled the Fe NP growth by varying differential pressure between the source and aggregation regions, while keeping gas flow and aggregation distance constant at 55 sccm and 90 mm, respectively. With the main chamber at 5.6 × 10−4 mbar and the aggregation zone at 0.2 mbar, they synthesized monodispersed ∼13 nm diameter spherical particles at 50 W and monodispersed nanocubes with a cluster width of about 10.5 nm at 100 W, due to competition between the growth modes of low-index (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) facets, rather than surface formation energetics. Powers between 50 and 100 W produced a combination of both shapes. Based on experimental and theoretical studies, they constructed a deposition rate-temperature diagram of Fe NP shapes (Fig. 10) showing that the combination of atomic deposition rate and condensation temperature define the final shape of the NPs.69 In another study, this group investigated the gas sensor application of the Fe nanocubes, as well as the doping of other metals such as Au into to them. They attributed excellent sensing properties of Fe nanocubes to both their specific morphologies and the advantages of aerosol NP synthesis. To make FeAu nanocubes, they evaporated two Au pellets in addition to the Fe target.71 They also employed a single-step process of DC magnetron sputtering in an inert argon atmosphere to achieve selective wetting of specific surface sites of iron nanocubes by gold atoms. This allowed them to control size, shape, gold concentration, and elemental distribution within a single NP at sizes below 10 nm. For this purpose, they performed co-sputtering of two iron targets and one gold target, each one inch in diameter. Upon exposure to ambient air, the BCC iron NP cores were coated with an iron oxide shell. Fig. 11 shows the structure and chemical composition of the Fe–Au for two Au concentrations. The multicomponent nanocubes can potentially be used for catalysis, drug delivery, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).72

2.1.1.2.3. Ceramic oxides. 
Hahn and Averback considered three different strategies for the synthesis of metal oxides NPs like Al2O3, NiO and ZrO2: (a) post-oxidation of the synthesized metal NPs generated using DC sputtering in an Ar atmosphere, (b) using reactive RF sputtering in an Ar–O2 atmosphere, and (c) using metal oxide targets instead of metal target with RF sputtering. The first approach may lead to agglomeration, and the third one is problematic, while the second approach is quite interesting for the synthesis of non-agglomerated particles because there is no exposure to high temperatures in this approach. Using the second approach, they synthesized monoclinic ZrO2 NPs with an average size of 20 nm. In addition, they created Al2O3 and NiO by DC diode sputtering in Ar–O2 atmosphere.52
Because of the ability of IGC to synthesize nonstoichiometric ultra-highly-dispersed oxides, Tschöpe et al. employed it to produce nonstoichiometric cerium oxide-based nanocrystalline catalysts for SO2 reduction. They used magnetron sputtering to evaporate Ce targets in Ar at pressures as low as 50 Pa. At this pressure, nucleation occurs homogeneously in the gas phase. Accordingly, they generated nonstoichiometric NPs with an average size between 8 and 14 nm, which were more effective in SO2 reduction by CO, CO oxidation, and methane oxidation compared with the corresponding stoichiometric NPs.107
Brossmann et al. studied oxygen diffusion in ultrafine-grained undoped ZrO2 synthesized by IGC. They used DC sputtering to vaporize Zr in Ar at 30 Pa. They oxidized the Zr nanocrystals collected on a cooled steel cylinder by gradual exposure to 1 kPa O2 which generated mainly tetragonal ZrO2 nanocrystals with an average size from 5 to 10 nm. Subsequently, pressureless sintering at 950 or 1050 °C produced samples with average crystallite sizes from 80 to 300 nm and densities from 97 to 99% of the bulk density. The diffusivity of 18O in interfaces in this undoped ZrO2 was 103 to 104 times its value for the corresponding bulk material in the temperature range from 450 to 950 °C, and was independent of the crystallite size in the range between 70 and 300 nm. Furthermore, they compared the volume diffusivity of oxygen in undoped ZrO2 with other transition metal oxides and ZrO2 doped with Y, Ca, and Mg. They found that it was far higher than other transition metal oxides and less than the doped ZrO2 NPs.91 Verma et al. used reactive sputtering to produce ZrO2 NPs. They found an optimum working pressure of 25 mTorr using Ar:O2 at a ratio of 40:10. They tested four different sputtering powers of 40, 60, 80, and 100 W to investigate its effect on NP size and morphology and found that increasing the sputtering power increased the size of the NPs (from 3 to 8 nm) and induced aggregation. TGA analysis showed only mass loss due to physiosorbed water, indicating the high purity of the ZrO2. The ZrO2 NPs are promising candidates for water purification applications because of the high purity and small size achieved by this method.92
2.1.1.2.4. Nanomaterials for oxygen evolution. 
Paoli et al. synthesized Ru and RuO2 by magnetron sputtering IGC and investigated the oxygen evolution activity of the NPs. For Ru NPs, they evaporated a Ru target by sputtering and to make RuO2 NPs, they exposed the as-synthesized Ru NPs to 1 bar oxygen in a tube furnace at 400 °C for 1 minute. They found the NPs exhibited one order of magnitude improvement in oxygen evolution activities relative to the state-of-the-art.95
2.1.1.3. Instrumentation and modelling. 
In 1995, Flagan and Lunden investigated particle structure control in IGC and pointed out that operation at higher pressure and shorter growth times could dramatically increase the production rate of NPs. The growth time could be controlled by the effective cooling rate in the growth region of the reactor.119
The relative simplicity of conventional IGC of a single metal allows it to be simulated at an atomistic level. Kesälä et al. performed classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the pressure dependence of cluster growth in IGC. They varied pressure by changing the simulation volume while holding other parameters, including initial temperature and the number of atoms, constant. The background gas in their simulations was argon, and the metal atoms were initially given a higher temperature than the background gas, which was thermostatted at 300 K, allowing them to simulate energy transfer from the metal vapor to the inert gas. Simulating systems of various metal vapours modelled with appropriate interatomic interaction potentials enabled them to investigate the effect of pressure by simulating the initial stages of the inert gas growth process at five pressures in each case. They observed an inverse relation between the initial metal vapor partial pressure and the condensation time. In addition, their studies showed that the molecular mass and lattice constant of the metal are the key factors determining the condensation time. Notably, they derived an analytical model for the condensation time based on the kinetic theory of gases with the basic assumptions of classical nucleation theory for a homogeneous vapor. They were able to predict the time scale of cluster formation for various metals with different atomic mass and lattice constant, showing that materials with larger atomic mass formed clusters more slowly, while faster clustering was observed with increasing lattice constant.120
Quensel et al. modelled the synthesis of NPs by magnetron sputtering-based IGC. They synthesized relatively monodispersed copper NPs from 3 to 10 nm mean diameter by adjusting the length of the collision path which, in turn, varied residence time of the NPs in the carrier gas. Using these experimental results, they developed a detailed model for the nucleation and growth of NPs based on classical nucleation theory. The model helped them understand the influence of various operating parameters on the synthesis process and identify the reactor temperature profile as one of the main factors determining the NP size distribution.121 Their model predictions agreed well with experimentally measured size distributions at sufficiently low operating pressure, despite the inherent wide uncertainties associated with the use of classical nucleation theory, and different possible formulations of it.122,123 At sufficiently low pressures and metal vapor concentrations, the assumption of NP growth only by addition of individual atoms is valid, and growth by aggregation of particles is negligible, leading to particle size distributions that are more nearly Gaussian (normal) rather than log-normal, as also evident from experimental measurements. This both simplifies modelling and allows production of relatively monodispersed particles. A key value of this model was its utility for identifying effective operating conditions for new materials, provided their thermodynamic properties are well established, prior to beginning experiments.
Akbarzadeh et al. employed MD simulations to study the various structural and thermodynamic properties of pure palladium, platinum, and PtxPd1−x nanoclusters formed during IGC. The evolution of the number of clusters with time was almost independent of composition, because it is governed by aggregation. However, the overall cohesive energy of the clusters increased with increasing Pt content, simply because the cohesive energy of bulk Pt is higher than that of Pd. Moreover, they found that smaller nanoclusters, which were approximately spherical, had sharper peaks in the radial distribution function compared to the larger nanoclusters, which adopted a variety of shapes, depending on their history. Furthermore, they proposed that the smaller cohesive energy of palladium could explain the observation of palladium atoms in the outer shells of the nanoalloy, while the inner shells were primarily composed of platinum.124 They performed the same type of molecular dynamic simulations for the IGC of Ni–Pt nanoalloys. They observed that increasing the platinum concentration in the nanoalloy decreased the stability and the sphericity of the nanoclusters. In this case, the cores of the particles were rich in nickel atoms, while the platinum atoms dominated the outer layers of the nanoclusters.125 This group also employed MD simulation to study the relative stability, morphology, surface energy, and growth path of IGC-synthesized Au–Cu, Au-Rh, Au–Pd, and Au–Pt nanoalloys. Among these nanoalloys, Au–Pd exhibited the lowest stability, while Au–Pt was the most stable. In all these nanoalloys, the surface of the clusters was dominated by gold atoms, while the other element formed the core, which can be attributed to the low surface energy of gold. The Au-Ru and Au–Pt nanoalloys adopted fcc- and hcp-like crystal structures in the core part of the nanoclusters, while the gold surface atoms were amorphous. In addition, Au–Cu nanoalloys had more spherical morphology compared to the other nanoalloys because of the greater mobility of Cu relative to the heavier elements.126
Li et al. studied the IGC synthesis of ternary Fe–Ni–Cr NPs by MD simulation to achieve a deep atomic understanding of the behaviour and the mechanism of the process. They observed four stages in the process: nucleation, surface growth, coalescence, and agglomeration, along with severe surface segregation of chromium in the final clusters. They investigated the influence of the number of metal atoms on the nucleation, growth, and phase transition of the NPs and found that the nucleation rate was nearly unaffected by the finite size of the system, while it had effects on the surface growth of sub-nm clusters and the aggregation of the larger clusters, at the system sizes considered. Furthermore, they observed that the liquid-to-solid transition initiated in the core and propagated toward the outer layers, producing lamellar fcc/hcp layers or multiple-fold twins through internal structural relaxation. Moreover, they reported a linear relationship between the temperature of solidification and the inverse of the cluster size and, accordingly, the inverse of the cube root of number of metal atoms.127
Wen and Xia developed an energy analysis model to predict the size of magnesium NPs as a determining factor for the properties of NPs. This approach involves computing the total energy of a cluster and the rates of energy deposition (due to condensation of atoms onto the cluster) and energy dissipation as clusters grow. This method employs analytical expressions for the various energies and rate processes involved, in contrast to the MD approaches described previously. The energy analysis was successful in predicting the size of IGC-synthesized magnesium NPs, in the range of 20–50 nm, to within 10%. The model was then used to identify operating conditions that would produce smaller NPs. Both increasing temperature and decreasing pressure can lead to a decrease in the size of NPs, and the effect of temperature is more significant.128 They also predicted the morphology of aluminium NPs synthesized by IGC using an extension of this method. Gibbs energy and the energy variation of clusters during the process (due to energy deposition and dissipation) were considered to work together to determine the morphology of NPs, driving the transition from quasi-spherical to faceted nanocrystals. They observed, in their model of IGC synthesis of Al NPs, that the energy change during the synthesis process played a more significant role in determining the morphology when the cooling rate was below 2 × 1011 K s−1. Moreover, they reported that although a spherical morphology is the most stable one at short times, a cubic morphology became more dominant as the NPs grew. This transition is driven by the greater rate of energy dissipation from a cube, compared to a sphere. The pressure of the condensation chamber was the most important factor to determine the point at which the morphology changed from spherical to cubic. Based on this model, they concluded that the pressure in the condensation chamber and the cooling rate were the main parameters controlling morphology in this IGC synthesis process.53
Janssens et al. performed a classical molecular simulation using Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MMC) importance sampling to study the thermodynamic equilibrium configuration of bimetallic silver-cobalt clusters synthesized by IGC with laser vaporization. They considered a canonical ensemble with two types of trial moves: random displacement of each atom in the bimetallic cluster from its actual position, and random site exchange between silver and cobalt atoms (chemically different atoms). They found that compact 3D configurations were favourable and these followed an icosahedral growth pattern for all compositions. For the clusters with silver as the major element, the strongly bound cobalt dopants adopted highly-coordinated positions. However, when cobalt was the major element, loosely bound silver atoms were poorly coordinated at the cluster surface. In addition, they performed photofragmentation experiments showing that the primary mechanism of fragmentation was silver atom loss, consistent with the model prediction of relatively loosely-bound silver atoms.129


2.1.2. Spark discharge generation. 
In this technique, the precursors take the form of two electrodes that are rapidly charged to high voltage, such that the electric field between them exceeds the threshold for breakdown field of the gas between them. A plasma spark is generated between the electrodes, with a temperature that can exceed 20000 K, which vaporizes small quantities of the electrode materials in the vicinity of the spark. Rapid cooling following the spark leads to nucleation of NPs of the electrode material. Because the volume of the spark is small, this approach typically yields very small quantities of nanomaterials. As in other aerosol nanosynthesis methods, the nanomaterials are mixed with an unheated inert gas to stop their growth and limit the particle size. Compared to other evaporation-condensation techniques, the small vapor cloud allows more rapid cooling below the boiling point which generates a high concentration of very small particles. By varying the composition of the electrodes and employing reactive gases, a wide variety of nanomaterials including pure metals, composites, alloys, oxides, hybrids, and semiconductors can be produced with this process. Spark discharge generation is an environmentally friendly technique, because it produces NPs of the same materials that comprise the electrodes, without producing waste such as reaction byproducts or solvents. Also, this technique can generate nanomaterials with good reproducibility and high purity. In addition, simultaneous spark evaporation of multiple materials can produce unique new phases. However, the synthesis of nanomaterials at very low production rates and difficulties associated with variation in the breakdown voltage, which leads to variation in the energy per spark, are notable disadvantages of this method.27,166,167 Although size, number concentration, chemical composition, morphology, and surface area of the NPs can be controlled in this method, these factors cannot each be controlled independently.131Table 3 provides a summary and Fig. 12 presents representative TEM images of nanomaterials synthesized using this approach.

2.1.2.1. Monometallics. 
Schwyn, Garwin, and Schmidt–Ott pioneered the development of this process for the synthesis of nanomaterials. They first demonstrated it for production of monodispersed Au NPs with an average size of about 1.3 nm. A schematic of the synthesis process is presented in Fig. 13. They used cylindrical electrodes with a diameter of 3 mm separated by 1 mm. The electrodes were mounted in jaw chucks that enabled fast exchange of electrodes and precise alignment and control of the spacing between them. They used a power supply with a maximum voltage of 12 kV in constant current mode, which could be varied between 0 and 1 mA (corresponding to spark frequencies from 0 to 50 Hz), to charge a 2.2 nF capacitor. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. To avoid loss of charged particles by electrostatic precipitation to charged insulators, they used a conductive Al housing and outlet tube.165 Their group also worked to scale-up the process to an industrial level for synthesis of ultrapure non-agglomerated singlet NPs.168 They also studied the synthesis of silver atomic clusters using an atmospheric pressure generation technique and were successful in producing atomic clusters ranging from 1 to 25 atoms in size.151

Many metallic vapor-phase synthesized nanomaterials can be easily oxidized by impurities in the carrier gas. This is a problem when the nanomaterials are later pressed and sintered to produce bulk samples with nanoscale grains, because oxide layers are incorporated. This can be mitigated by adding hydrogen during sintering. Hallberg et al. proposed an alternative strategy to prevent oxidation during the synthesis process. They mixed 5% hydrogen into the nitrogen used as the carrier gas in spark discharge synthesis of Au, Co, Bi, and Sn NPs using electrodes that were separated by 2 mm and eroded by a spark generator with a 10-mA constant current power supply charging a 38 nF capacitor. They compared the resulting NPs with those synthesized using nitrogen as the carrier gas, sintering each in a hydrogen mixture to demonstrate the advantage of their strategy. They found that the crystal quality of Bi and Sn synthesized using their strategy was remarkably higher than that produced using the conventional strategy. Thus, they concluded that their strategy can improve sintering of NPs into compact nanocrystalline metals by preventing the generation of oxide layers on the as-synthesized NPs.134
Vons et al. synthesized palladium NPs with a size of about 4 nm that formed fractal-like agglomerates up to 100 nm in size and investigated their hydrogen storage properties. For the synthesis, they used 2 mm palladium electrodes with 3 lpm of argon and achieved a production rate of about 2 mg h−1 at a spark frequency of 300 Hz. They determined hydrogen storage properties by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) and Sievert's (PCT) measurements and concluded that spark discharge generation is advantageous for metal hydride NP synthesis.149
Němec et al. developed a spark discharge generator for the synthesis of platinum and platinum oxide NPs. A schematic of their system is shown in Fig. 14. It comprised a stainless-steel cylinder fitted with several ports, including two horizontal ports to accommodate 2 mm platinum rod electrodes. A modified TIG plasma torch held each electrode, allowing both electrical connection and liquid cooling. They employed a 2 mm tungsten rod as an auxiliary electrode to initiate the high-power sparks and stabilize their frequency. The cathode was powered and the anode was grounded. High-voltage probes and a current probe were used to monitor the process. Two vertical ports served as inlet and outlet for the carrier gas. The nozzle was engineered to produce parallel uniform streams directed toward the spark zone. In the unipolar set-up, the cathode is evaporated as the main source of NPs and is eroded. To synthesize platinum NPs, they used a 95:5 mixture of N2:H2 (forming gas) as the carrier gas. Spark discharge in air produced platinum oxide NPs. The crystallinity of the platinum NPs was higher and their size was smaller than the platinum oxide NPs. No matter which carrier gas was used, spherical platinum particles hundreds of nanometers in diameter were also produced, and their weight fraction was greater for synthesis in air.161

Li et al. synthesized lanthanum-based NPs by spark discharge generation at a voltage of 1.38 kV and current of 8.1 mA. They used two vertically-aligned 8 mm cylindrical electrodes separated by a 1 mm gap. Ten lpm of a 98:2 mixture of N2:O2 flowed past them. The NPs were oxidized, and subsequent mixing with water vapor in nitrogen converted them to La(OH)3 NPs. They deposited the La(OH)3 NPs onto PAN nanofibers by electrospinning and used them for phosphate removal, for which they showed impressive performance.154
2.1.2.2. Bimetallics. 
Tabrizi et al. produced Ag–Cu, Pt–Au, and Cu–W bimetallic NPs by a spark discharge technique with a constant spark energy from a 20 nF capacitor. They used Ag/Cu electrodes to produce Ag–Cu NPs that exhibited solid solubility of Ag in Cu and vice versa, even though Ag and Cu are essentially immiscible in the bulk. They synthesized Au–Pt particles with the same strategy and observed intermediate phases and compositions in the miscibility gap of the bulk phase diagram. They produced NPs including both Cu and W by applying sintered electrodes of Cu/W in the generator.145
Byeon et al. employed spark discharge to generate monometallic (using identical electrodes) and bimetallic (using different electrodes) NPs. The electrodes were 3 mm diameter metal rods. They used UHP nitrogen at 3 lpm as the carrier gas. In their spark generator, a 10 nF capacitor was charged at 2 mA by applying a voltage of 3 kV, producing sparks at 667 Hz. The short spark duration was advantageous for rapid cooling downstream of the spark. They produced Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au NPs with primary particle sizes from 2 to 4 nm in agglomerates of 14.9, 26.7, 37.7, and 48.8 nm dimensions, respectively. The corresponding production rates were 0.12, 1.68, 16.00, and 40.30 μg min−1, respectively. They suggested that the generation rate increased with increasing ionization potential for each metal (Ag < Pd < Pt < Au). They found that the synthesized bimetallic NPs were agglomerated binary mixtures of two individual monometallic particles and not alloys. They investigated the effect of changing the polarity of the electrodes on the mass fraction of bimetallic NPs and the production yield and they found when Pd is the positive electrode, Pd:Pt, Pd:Au, and Pd:Ag NPs had mass fractions of 0.84:0.16, 0.86:0.14, and 0.44:0.57 with production rates of 3.16, 4.37, and 1.51 μg min−1, respectively while the corresponding values were 0.95:0.05, 0.96:0.04, and 0.27:0.73 and 6.60, 7.18, and 1.03 μg min−1, respectively when Pd was the negative electrode. Moreover, they found that the size distribution of bimetallic NPs was strongly affected by the polarity of the electrodes.148
Ahmad et al. developed a novel rod-to-tube type spark generator to generate monometallic and bimetallic NPs for use in catalysis. A schematic of their apparatus is shown in Fig. 15. It comprised a spark chamber made from a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) tee. Rod and tube electrodes were placed in opposing inlets of the tee, which provided electrical isolation. To synthesize monometallic NPs, these two electrodes were composed of the same metal, while for bimetallic NPs electrodes of two different metals were used. The rod and tube electrodes both had a diameter of 6.35 mm, but to place one end of the rod inside the tube at its center, that end was sharpened. The tube also served as the aerosol outlet. The third inlet of the tee was used to introduce the carrier gas (Ar or N2) at 0.5 to 3.3 lpm. They used a high-voltage (up to 20 kV) source and current of 10 mA to charge a high-voltage external capacitor of 0.1–1 nF capacitance, which in turn was connected in parallel to the spark gap by a 1 MΩ ballast resistor. With this reactor configuration, they synthesized Fe, Ni, and Cu as monometallic catalysts with average sizes of 5.17, 5.46, and 4.54 nm, respectively, and Co–Ni and Co–Fe as bimetallic catalysts with average sizes of 4.72 and 4.90 nm, respectively. When a copper electrode was used, higher capacitance was required, which they attributed to the high thermal conductivity of copper. They also studied the effect of carrier gas flow rate on the size and number concentration of NPs and found that increasing the carrier gas flow rate decreased particle size and increased number concentration due to faster cooling and reduced residence time. Changing the carrier gas from nitrogen to argon decreased both the size and the number concentration of the NPs because of lower discharge voltage and effective discharge energy per spark in argon. Notably, their process could maintain a constant size distribution of NPs for 24 hours.135

2.1.2.3. Semiconductors. 
Helsper et al. generated carbon NPs which they called “soot-like” particles with an average primary particle size of 5 nm in aggregates of 50 to 200 nm overall size. They used two 6 mm diameter graphite electrodes mounted in brass collets and maintained at 2 mm separation by using a small electric motor to keep the discharge voltage constant. A 20 nF capacitor was charged by a high-voltage power supply with adjustable output current. They measured a breakdown voltage of 2 kV, which led to the release of 40 mJ of electrical energy. They studied the influence of spark frequency on yield and found that upon increasing the spark frequencies from 2 to 300 Hz (charging currents from 0.13 to 20 mA) the yield increased from 20 μg h−1 to 7 mg h−1.130
Vons et al. studied the synthesis of silicon NPs by spark discharge generation to test the feasibility of its use for production of semiconductors. To do so, they used a DC high-voltage power supply operating as a constant current source of maximum 60 mA, which charged a 20 nF capacitor. Argon was used as the carrier gas. They used two different types of electrodes: (a) intrinsic silicon rods with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 6 cm and (b) boron-doped silicon rods with a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 6 cm and they found the latter case led to a thousand-fold increase in mass production. Silicon can be easily oxidized upon exposure to oxygen. To avoid this, they made the system oxygen- and water-free by gas purification, outgassing, and the use of as-synthesized particles as getters. Accordingly, they were successful in producing pure and monodispersed silicon NPs with a primary particle size between 3 and 5 nm.136
2.1.2.4. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Vons et al. produced core/shell Mg/MgO NPs by spark discharge, yielding 10 nm Mg cores surrounded by 1–2 nm thick MgO shells. In addition, they performed thermal hydrogen desorption which started at surprisingly low temperatures of about 350 K due to the small sizes of the particles, but extended over a broad temperature range above 700 K because of the presence of oxide shell barriers. They found that in situ addition of palladium NPs led to a considerable acceleration of hydrogen sorption kinetics.133 This group also studied synthesis and hydrogen storage properties of Mg–Ti nanocomposites using the same set-up. They produced a metastable bcc Mg–Ti alloy that transformed into an fcc alloy of Mg1−yTiyHx upon hydrogenation and had more favorable hydrogen storage properties compared to bulk MgH2. The primary particle size of both MgTi and Mg1−yTiyHx was 10–20 nm and they both had a fractal-like porous morphology. TEM images of the as-produced NPs and the NPs after partial hydrogenation are presented in Fig. 16.137 Charvet et al. investigated the effective density and initial particle size of airborne NPs including Constantan® (CuNi alloy), copper, graphite, iron, silver, and titanium NPs synthesized by spark discharge generation. Because of its role in particle deposition in the human respiratory tract, effective density is one of the most important properties of airborne NPs, but its direct measurement is generally not possible. Accordingly, they employed tandem measurement of airborne NPs’ electrical mobility and mass and found effective densities of constantan®, copper, graphite, iron, silver, and titanium agglomerated NPs, showing that the effective density decreased with effective mobility diameter of aggregates, with a power-law exponent of d−0.67 to d−1.02, and was always much lower than the bulk density.169 Muntean et al. also employed a spark discharge generation process to synthesize Cu, Ni, and CuNi alloy using electrodes with various compositions (Cu/Ni: 100/0, 80/20, 60/40, 40/60, 20/80, and 0/100). The spark discharge occurred at atmospheric pressure using a generator with a 6 mA constant current power supply to charge a 15 nF capacitor. The electrodes were 3 mm diameter rods and separated by 3 mm. With less than 7% difference in the composition of the NPs and the electrodes, they concluded that there was no segregation. They found that increasing the Cu content in the electrodes lowered the melting point, which led to an increase in the primary particle size and decrease in evaporation rate, in a good agreement with the Llewellyn-Jones model (eqn (1), in Section 2.1.2.5. below). The synthesized NPs had a roughly spherical morphology with a diameter in the range of 2–10 nm.141

Feng et al. synthesized LaFeSi NPs as the first rare-earth-based magnetic materials produced by spark discharge generation. They employed LaFe11.5Si1.5 rods as electrodes with a perpendicular flow of Ar or 2% or 5% H2 in Ar. The molar ratio of La to Fe in the product NPs was 1:11.46, closely matching that of the electrodes. The TEM analyses, elemental line-scan EDX profiles of a NP, HAADF-STEM and EDX maps are presented in Fig. 17. They studied the magnetic properties of the NPs and found that they could control the Curie temperature over a broad range of 200–340 K by adjusting the hydrogen content in the carrier gas mixture. 5% H2 in the carrier gas led to higher magnetization at low temperatures and a moderately sharp magnetic to nonmagnetic phase transition, while reducing the hydrogen content to 2% led to a shallow phase transition and decreased magnetization. Without hydrogen, there was no phase transition and the magnetization was much weaker (Fig. 18). They suggested two main reasons for these observations: (1) formation of hydrides La(Fe, Si)13Hx which prevents oxidation, and (2) modification of magnetic exchange coupling between iron atoms by incorporation of hydrogen. Accordingly, the Curie temperature could approach room temperature by adjusting the hydrogen content in the carrier gas without a substantial decrease in the large magnetocaloric effect, which made these NPs promising candidates for the energy conversion and efficient magnetic refrigeration.155

2.1.2.5. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Tabrizi et al. modeled the synthesis of gold NPs by spark discharge generation. They found that particle heating has a strong effect on the particle growth under high-vapor-loading conditions because of the release of surface free energy upon coalescence. In addition, they reported that the gas flow rate does not affect the particle size for sufficiently high gas flow rates due to a very short primary particle synthesis process, after which the particle growth is completed and is not affected by dilution, while final product size is influenced by the gas flow rate at small flows because of slow coagulation at room temperature after primary particle production. They found that they can use the Llewellyn-Jones model (eqn (1)170) to estimate the mass production rate and the energy balance around hot spots: (1)where m (g) is the evaporated mass, ce (F) is effective gap capacitance, V (V) is the breakdown voltage, Tb (K) is the boiling point, b (J K−4) is equal to Aσt in which σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10−8 J s−1 m−2 K−4), A (m2) is the surface area of electrodes, and t (s) is the time for energy transfer, k (W m−1 K−1) is thermal conductivity, g (m s) is equal to 2(πA)0.5t if (r2/Kt)0.5 ≪ 1, in which K is thermal diffusivity (m2 s−1) and r (m) is the radius corresponding to A, T (K) is the steady state temperature, cps (J g−1 K−1) is the average heat capacity of the solid, Tm (K) is the melting point, ΔHm (J g−1) is the enthalpy of melting, cpl. (J g−1 K−1) is the average heat capacity of the liquid, and ΔHv (J g−1) is the enthalpy of evaporation. They synthesized monodispersed and non-agglomerated Au NPs of sizes from 3 to 12 nm, which was controlled by the energy per spark (which can be influenced by capacitance, distance between electrodes, frequency, and carrier gas type and flow rate) with a typical mass productivity of 5 g kW−1 h−1. Based on the flow rates of the gas, the particles could be agglomerated as well. They found that the sintering of gold NPs could occur at unusually low temperatures due the cleanliness of the synthesized particles.166
Roth et al. used the same spark generator and the same strategy for the synthesis of silver, cadmium oxide, iridium, iron oxide, and carbon NPs with surface areas of 20, 50, 123, 300, and 750 m2 g−1, respectively. They reported the flow rate of argon should be at least 6 lpm to remove all NPs from the reaction zone and exchange the gas volume in the zone when the spark frequency is 300 Hz. The average sizes for the silver, cadmium oxide, iridium, iron oxide, and carbon NPs were 20 nm (f = 300 Hz), 35 nm & 50 nm (f = 6 Hz & 300 Hz), 18 nm & 22 nm (f = 140 Hz & 500 Hz), 35 nm (f = 20 Hz), and 25 nm & 70 nm (f = 3 Hz & 300 Hz), respectively. They found if they did not mix Ar (6.3 lpm) with N2 (17 lpm) for the synthesis of carbon NPs at a frequency of 300 Hz, the size of the agglomerates increased from 70 to 150 nm. They concluded that the size and the number concentration of NPs were variable while the morphology and the surface area were constant, independent of particle size for an identical chemical composition. They reported a high surface-to-volume ratio of 2800 m2 cm−3 for the iridium NPs. In addition, they found that although they could not produce highly-pure carbon NPs due to contamination within the spark generator, they could decrease the contamination content from 25% to 6% by using pure inorganic components instead of organic components.131
Domaschke et al. conducted a comprehensive investigation on the spark discharge synthesis of a wide variety of metals and amorphous carbon to isolate the effects of various parameters. They reported that decreasing the power produced smaller NPs. Increasing carrier gas flow decreased particle concentration, and therefore the rate of coagulation and, accordingly, the size of aggregates. They found that increasing energy per spark, and energy efficiency of the process, was possible by employing a higher capacitance at fixed input power. This increased the mass production rate with accompanying increases in both the size and concentration of NPs. Furthermore, using electrodes of the same material, but different diameters and using electrodes with different thermal conductivities allowed them to conclude that energy loss via thermal conduction away from the electrode tips was a significant factor in decreasing the mass yield and the size of NPs. In addition, they defined a modified Fourier number to correlate the mass production rate of various nanomaterials in terms of discharge time, electrode diameter, and thermal properties of the material being produced.171
Feng et al. developed a model to predict the composition of nanoalloys produced by spark discharge generation between two different electrodes. Their analysis provides a means to control composition by tuning the electrical characteristics of the spark-discharge circuit to adjust the ablation ratio between two different electrodes, which determines the average composition of the synthesized NPs. Development of the model relied on separation of circuit-dependent and material-dependent contributions. Their work further advanced the ability to use spark discharge generation to synthesize nanoalloys of immiscible materials over a range of compositions, at macroscopic scale.172
Kabirinia et al. developed a mathematical model based upon the aerosol general dynamic equation to predict the size of tungsten carbide NPs synthesized by spark discharge generation. They calculated all the necessary parameters to develop the mathematical model without any external data. They evaluated their model against experimental data on synthesis of tungsten carbide NPs in N2 and Ar atmospheres. Results agreed well, with an average error of 15% for particle size, compared with crystallite size from XRD analysis and the Scherrer equation.173


2.1.3. Laser ablation. 
Laser ablation is a laser-driven technique to synthesize nanomaterials from a bulk solid precursor. It involves vaporizing a plume of material using a laser. Most often, this is a pulsed laser that produces a transient vapor plume, but some continuous laser ablation processes have also been reported. Key advantages of the method are that it can vaporize materials that cannot otherwise easily be evaporated, can produce high-purity nanomaterials, can use many different target materials alone or in combination, and can produce NPs with various compositions.27,174 A major disadvantage of this approach is that only small amounts of nanomaterials can be produced.27,175 The requirement of a complex non-isothermal system, very limited demonstration of scale-up, and expensive equipment are other limitations of the method.175 In addition to aerosol generation of NPs, this approach has been widely used for the synthesis of nanomaterials by vaporizing solid precursors in liquid or supercritical fluid media and for the production of thin films, both of which are beyond the scope of this review. Table 4 provides a summary and Fig. 19 presents representative TEM images of nanomaterials synthesized in a gaseous atmosphere using this approach.

2.1.3.1. Metals and metal oxides. 
Dietz, Duncan, Powers, and Smalley pioneered pulsed laser ablation with supersonic expansion for the synthesis of Al clusters. They employed a Nd:YAG pulsed laser producing 80 mJ per pulse to vaporize an Al plug within a pulsed supersonic nozzle. The vaporized metal atoms were entrained in the expanding helium which led to formation of a supersonic beam of Al clusters at 1.2 m downstream of the nozzle, which was operated at 10 pulses per second in a He atmosphere with a 28.5 atm backing pressure.176 Although their set-up was effectively generating the Al clusters, they found some problems regarding reproducibility and stability of the Al cluster signals. They found that the pulsed laser quickly drilled deep holes on the surface of the target which made vaporization at the same spot extremely difficult. Accordingly, they changed the set-up to move the target before each laser pulse. With this modification, they generated Cu clusters containing 1 to 13 Cu atoms with a high degree of reproducibility. During the pulsed vaporization in a He background using a Nd:YAG laser, they rotated and translated a Cu rod to achieve uniform vaporization at a frequency of 10 Hz with 5 to 50 mJ laser pulses. A simple schematic of the set-up is presented in Fig. 20.177 Svetlichnyi et al. produced iron oxide magnetic NPs using pulsed laser ablation of iron in air followed by annealing. They ablated an iron target using 7 ns pulses from a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in air at atmospheric pressure. The primary product was a mixture of spherical monoclinic magnetite (mainly 12 to 15 nm in size) and iron nitrides in the form of lamellae and rolls. Upon thermal treatment, the size of their NPs increased and three subsequent phase transformations were observed: first, to cubic magnetite; second to a mixture of α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, and Fe3O4; and third, to the pure hematite phase.178

Becker et al. synthesized Ag, Au, and Ni0.81:Fe0.19 NPs by pulsed laser ablation of microparticles. They employed a 248 nm pulsed KrF excimer laser with a 12 ns pulse width. As targets, they used silver and gold microparticles with a nominal diameter of 2 μm and Ni0.81:Fe0.19 with a maximum size of 45 μm, which was reduced to an average size of around 4 μm after a suspension in methanol and settling out of large particles. The average sizes of the synthesized NPs were from 10 to 100 nm. They found that increasing the laser power increased the average size of the synthesized NPs.179 Boutinguiza et al. employed pulsed laser ablation in open air conditions to generate silver NPs. They used highly-pure Ag plates as the target, with a nanosecond diode-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser with a wavelength of 532 nm, pulse duration of 50 ns, repetition rate of 20 kHz, average power of 6 W, and irradiance of around 100 MW cm−2. The targets were connected to a holder positioned 0.5 to 1.5 cm away from the glass substrate used for collection of the synthesized silver NPs. Ar was used in this experiment as the carrier gas to prevent oxidation. Accordingly, they produced spherical silver NPs with maximum diameters of 50 nm.180
Zhong et al. synthesized IrO2 NPs by pulsed laser ablation of ball-milled IrO2 powder spread on a substrate. A Nd:YAG pulsed laser with a pulse duration of 8 ns and frequency of 10 Hz ablated the powder for 10 s at a power of 1 W under ambient atmosphere and room temperature to produce core–shell NPs in which IrO2 cores were surrounded by ultra-small (∼2 nm) Ir spheres that aggregated into a shell. A schematic representing the in situ engineering of the Ir spheres as a shell around an IrO2 crystal as the core along with the TEM analysis of the nanomaterials is presented in Fig. 21. They used these NPs as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The ultra-small Ir spheres in the shell increased the electrochemically active surface area and improved the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalysts, which accelerated the oxygen evolution reaction compared to the unmodified IrO2 structure. In addition, they reported that this nanomaterial showed the best electrocatalytic performance among all noble-metal electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction.239

Song et al. applied pulsed laser ablation to produce core/shell structured Zn/ZnO NPs in high yield. They ablated a commercial pristine zinc oxide nanopowder in a chamber filled with Ar, using a 1070 nm ytterbium fiber laser (600 J cm−2, 1.1 MW cm−2). They proposed that in the aerosol produced by the laser ablation, metallic Zn would nucleate in the sealed Ar atmosphere, and further oxidization at the surface would produce core/shell Zn/ZnO NPs. Furthermore, they reported that the core/shell nanostructure exhibited enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency due to improved visible light absorption as well as inhibited recombination of carriers induced by the incorporation of metallic Zn.229
2.1.3.2. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Guo et al. first reported the synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) using pulsed laser ablation. They explained that carbon condensation in an inert atmosphere heated to 1200 °C will lead to self-assembly of MWCNT due to its inherent growth mechanism, which stabilizes the open conformation against closure. This contrasted with prior syntheses in which some extrinsic factor such as catalytic metal particles, high electric fields, hydrogen atoms, or a surface at low temperature helped to keep the MWCNT structure open at its growing end. To produce MWCNTs, they ablated a 1.25 cm diameter graphite rod in an Ar atmosphere using a Nd:YAG pulsed laser at 532 nm, emitting 250 mJ per pulse, with a pulse width of 10 ns, and repetition rate of 10 Hz. The ablation was conducted in a temperature-controlled quartz tube furnace at 1200 °C in high-purity Ar. They deposited the synthesized carbon species on a conical water-cooled copper rod. The MWCNT consisted of 4 to 24 layers with a maximum length of 300 nm.183 They used the same apparatus for the catalytic synthesis of SWCNT with yields much greater than the yields obtained by the metal-catalyzed arc-discharge method at the time of their research. For SWCNT synthesis, they evaporated metal-graphite composite rods as targets, with the following concentrations (in at%) of metals: Ni (0.6), Co (1.0), Pt (0.2), Cu (0.6), Nb (0.6), Co/Ni (0.6/0.6), Co/Pt (0.6/0.2), Ni/Pt (0.6/0.2), and Co/Cu (0.6/0.5). Among the single metal-graphite composite targets, Ni had the highest yield followed by Co while the yield for Pt was very small. Cu and Nb did not produce any SWCNT. Among the bimetal-graphite composite targets, Co/Pt and Co/Ni had the highest yields, which were 10–100 times the yields obtained using single metal-composite targets. The yield for Ni/Pt was slightly less, while the Co/Cu composite had a small yield. They found that the yields increased with increasing temperature of the tube furnace, up to a maximum temperature of 1200 °C. Notably, they did not observe any MWCNT.186 They also investigated the metallic resistivity of SWCNT with crystalline ropes as small as 10 nm in diameter and length exceeding 10 μm synthesized by the pulsed laser ablation of (Co,Ni)-doped graphite. They found that the synthesized SWCNT had lower resistivity and lower crossover temperature compared to unoriented bulk samples.242 In addition, they doped SWCNT with potassium and bromine, which enhanced their conductivity at 300 K by up to a factor of 30 while also enlarging the range of their positive temperature coefficient of resistance.191 Zhang et al. employed pulsed laser ablation to generate SWCNT in a nitrogen atmosphere and found that using a bimetallic mixture of Co–Ni as the catalyst produced SWCNT at the same yield as in a noble gas using the same catalyst.187 They used the same strategy to produce multiwalled B–C–N nanotubes by pulsed laser ablation of a powder mixture of carbon, boron nitride, cobalt, and nickel. They reported two types of nanotubes: thinner nanotubes of pure carbon and thicker nanotubes with B–C–N layers. Moreover, they observed no single-walled nanotubes in this case.190 Scott et al. studied the mechanisms of pulsed laser ablation synthesis of SWCNT. They proposed that the carbon as feedstock for nanotube synthesis comes from carbon clusters suspended in the reaction zone in addition to the direct ablation of the target. Fullerenes synthesized in the reaction zone could not only be fragmented into low molecular weight species like C2, but also play the role of feedstock for the synthesis of nanotubes. The laser beam confinement of the nanotubes in the reaction zone provides time for purification and annealing of the nanotubes.243
Iijima et al. employed laser ablation to produce aggregates of numerous horn-like sheaths of single-walled graphene sheets, which they called “carbon nano-horns”. Fig. 22 shows TEM images of the synthesized carbon nano-horns. They produced these using a two-part system with a separate energy source part and a reaction part. This configuration is similar to the laser pyrolysis synthesis set-up that is discussed in detail in a later section. The energy source was a high power 10.6-μm-CO2 laser with a maximum power of 5 kW, variable pulse duration from 10 ms to continuous-wave operation, and beam diameter of 10 mm. The reaction part included a plastic-resin reaction chamber with dimensions of 30 × 30 × 25 cm3 to which a ZnSe lens system was attached to adjust the beam intensity. The ablation target was a graphite rod with a diameter of 30 mm and length of 50 mm, which was placed at the center of the reaction chamber and rotated around its axis at a rate of 6 rpm to continuously expose a fresh surface. After pre-evacuation of the chamber, Ar at 760 Torr and a flow rate of 40 lpm entered the reaction chamber. The laser beam ablated the rod, and the synthesized particles were collected onto filters placed between the reaction chamber and the vacuum pump. The graphitic particles with a uniform size of about 80 nm were produced at a rate of around 10 g h−1.192 Note that the use of a high-power CO2 laser enabled much higher production rates than is typical for laser ablation. Iijima's group also synthesized nitrogen-doped, boron-doped, and boron- and nitrogen-codoped single-wall carbon nano-horns (SWCNHs) in addition to pristine SWCNHs. A schematic illustrating the structure of the synthesized SWCNHs is presented in Fig. 23. The CO2 laser with a power of 3.5 kW ablated the target, which was rotating at 2 rpm, for 30 s. To synthesize intrinsic SWCNHs, the target was a graphite rod, as used previously, and the process was conducted under argon. Use of nitrogen as the buffer gas produced nitrogen-doped SWCNHs from the same target. They followed the same strategy for boron-doped and boron- and nitrogen- co-doped SWCNHs using a target containing 2 at% boron. In this case, they obtained spherical SWCNH aggregates dominantly containing graphite-like thin sheets, at a rate of 300 mg min−1. The structures contained graphene lattices including BN bonds, demonstrating boron and nitrogen incorporation. These dopant atoms were present as three-fold coordinated (sp2 bonded) centers in the SWCNHs. The preferential formation of graphite-like thin sheets under argon atmosphere led them to conclude that boron facilitated the formation of these sheets. Based on these results, the authors proposed that large-scale production of these SWCNHs is possible and that practical synthesis of boron-doped and boron- and nitrogen- codoped SWCNTs at ambient temperature and pressure under argon and nitrogen could reduce production cost.196

2.1.3.3. Silicon nanomaterials. 
Okada and Iijima used pulsed laser ablation to produce silicon NPs with diameters from 20 to 500 nm. They did so in an argon atmosphere over a pressure range of 0.75 to 3 Pa using a pulsed YAG laser with an energy of 40 to 90 J per pulse, pulse width of 12 ms, and repetition rate of 1 Hz. Furthermore, they reported that the oxidation rate of the synthesized silicon particles was slower than that of a silicon wafer and decreased with decreasing particle size.206 Werwa et al. synthesized silicon NPs as small as 3 nm. They used a doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm, energy per pulse of 3 mJ, pulse width of 7 ns, and repetition rate of 20 Hz with a 0.63 cm diameter polycrystalline Si rod as a rotating target. The target was positioned adjacent to a pulsed valve that controlled a flow of unheated He that served as an inert gas to carry as-synthesized Si NPs through a 1 mm diameter by 8 mm long channel into a vacuum chamber. Cooling upon expansion into vacuum stopped the growth and limited the particle size.207 Yoshida et al. employed pulsed laser ablation at constant pressure to produce ultrafine crystalline silicon NPs with a minimum size of around 3 nm and found that the size of silicon NPs could be controlled by the pressure of the inert gas atmosphere based on an inertia fluid model (dm ∝ p3/2). They used an ArF excimer laser at 193 nm, with an energy density of 1 J cm−2 per pulse, pulse width of 12 ns, and repetition rate of 10 Hz to evaporate a 2-inch single crystalline silicon wafer in a He atmosphere.208
Momoki et al. employed pulsed laser ablation of preheated ground silicon sludge to generate mainly amorphous silicon nanofibers with crystalline NPs on their tips. A pulse generator drove a quasi-continuous wave fiber laser with a maximum power of 500 W and a wavelength of 1070 nm as the source of energy. The duration of the pulse was varied from 1 to 10 ms. The 500 μm diameter laser beam at a power density of 178 kW cm−2 ablated the sludge target under argon. They studied the effect of gas pressure, laser pulse duration, and preheating condition of the target on the synthesis process. They found that the gas pressure affected the intensity, size, and growth speed of the laser-induced plume, while the laser pulse duration affected the size and morphology of the nanofibers. In addition, they could control the crystallinity and oxygen content of the nanofibers by adjusting the preheating conditions of the sludge. Fig. 24 shows a schematic diagram illustrating the production mechanism of the silicon nanofibers and a representative SEM image. Because the target was silicon sludge disposed from wafer back-grinding processes, this technique can be considered a cost-effective approach to synthesize silicon nanofibers which could be used in lithium-ion batteries.209

Geohegan et al. performed time-resolved imaging to investigate the dynamics of NP synthesis, transport and deposition using pulsed KrF laser ablation of crystalline silicon into Ar and He as the background gases over a pressure range of 1 to 10 Torr. They reported that vaporization of silicon into Ar produced a uniform and stationary plume of NPs while ablation in much lighter He generated a turbulent ring of particles that spread and advanced forward at 10 m s−1.216
2.1.3.4. Nanorods, nanowires and nanocables. 
Morales and Lieber employed pulsed laser ablation followed by vapor-liquid–solid (VLS) growth to synthesize nanowires of semiconductors like Si and Ge. They used a pulsed frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser to vaporize the target, which was a mixture of the source of nanowires and the catalyst. The target was positioned in a quartz tube furnace with variable pressure, temperature, and residence time. To make Si nanowires, they ablated Si0.9Fe0.1 that was preheated to 1200 °C in the furnace. This yielded silicon nanowires with diameters as low as 10 nm and lengths ranging from 1 to 30 μm. TEM imaging also showed spheres with diameters of 1.5 to 2 times that of the attached nanowires, consistent with a VLS growth process. Considering TEM and EDX results together, they concluded that the nanowires comprised silicon cores with diameters of 6 to 20 nm coated by amorphous silica. TEM images of the silicon nanowires at two different magnifications are shown in Fig. 25. Note that synthesis of silicon nanowires using iron catalyst happened at temperatures above 1150 °C. While this is below the 1207 °C bulk solidus melting point for Si–Fe, nanostructures have lower melting points than their corresponding bulk solids. They synthesized Si nanowires by ablating Si0.9Ni0.1 and Si0.99Au0.01 as targets. These nanowires grew from β-NiSi2 and Au nanoclusters, respectively. Following the same strategy, they generated germanium nanowires by the pulsed laser ablation of Ge0.9Fe0.1 as the target.210 Zhang et al. synthesized pure Si nanowires with diameters of 3 to 43 nm and up to a few hundred μm length in high yield. They achieved a growth rate of 10 to 80 μm/h by high-temperature laser-ablation of a target prepared by pressing silicon powder mixed with 0.5% iron. The energy source was an excimer laser at 248 nm emitting 400 mJ per pulse with a pulse-width of 34 ns and a frequency of 10 Hz. They used argon as the carrier gas at 50 sccm and 500 Torr in a quartz tube furnace at 1200 °C. They found twins and stacking faults in the cores of the nanowires.211 Later, they used silica instead of iron as the catalyst for the formation of Si nanowires by pulsed laser ablation.212 Yu et al. employed pulsed laser ablation with a 246 nm pulsed excimer laser producing around 350 mJ per pulse for the large-scale production of silica nanowires with diameters around 15 nm and lengths up to hundreds of μm. The disk-like target was a mixture of Si powder and 20 wt% of silica powder in which 8 wt% Fe powder was added as the catalyst. The target was located in a quartz tube furnace that was pre-evacuated to 20 mTorr and preheated to 850 °C for 4 hours. Prior to the ablation in an Ar atmosphere at 100 Torr, the target was heated at 1200 °C for 24 h. The synthesized silica nanowires stably emitted blue light at energies of 2.65 and 3.0 eV with an intensity two orders of magnitude higher than that of porous Si.214

Zhang et al. used pulsed laser ablation of a mixture of SiO, C, BN, and Li3N compressed powders to synthesize coaxial nanocables that were a few tens of nm in diameter and up to 50 μm in length. These combined silicon-based nanowires (including β-phase SiC core and an amorphous silica intermediate layer) surrounded by a graphitic outer shell (including separate carbon and boron nitride layers in the radial direction). They suggested that this semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor structure would be advantageous for nanoscale electronic device applications because of the self-assembly mechanism for the evolution of multielement nanotube.219 Shi et al. employed the same strategy by ablation of a SiC target to synthesize coaxial three-layer nanocables in which the 30 to 50 nm diameter core was made of silicon, the 12 to 23 nm thick intermediate layer was made of silica, and 17 to 31 nm thick outer shell was made of carbon. A low magnification TEM image of the coaxial three-layer nanocables and corresponding HRTEM image are presented in Fig. 26. They used a gaseous mixture of 95% Ar and 5% H2 as the carrier gas. They proposed that minimization of the surface and interfacial energies of the three materials led to the formation of the coaxial nanostructure via separation of thee three phases, but solid-gas chemical reactions played a central role in the evolution of the three phases.218

Woodard and Duncan developed a novel pulsed laser ablation reactor that included in situ ligand coating. A schematic of the production process is presented in Fig. 27. They employed a 248 nm high power KrF excimer laser producing 100 to 140 mJ per pulse at a repetition rate of 300 to 400 Hz under helium, in which a stream of 2 to 10% oxygen flowed, to synthesize molybdenum oxide nanorods. Thereafter, the nanorods were ligand-coated by evaporated acetonitrile, delivered in argon at 50 °C. Finally, the ligand-coated nanorods were collected in a liquid-nitrogen cold trap such that they were dispersed in the excess acetonitrile upon melting. Subsequent evaporation of the solvent yielded molybdenum oxide nanorods with a length of 100 nm, diameter of 20 nm and a narrow size distribution, as a blue powder. The semiamorphous nanorods crystallized upon annealing, but the as-produced nanorods exhibited higher activity as photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene blue. The pulsed laser ablated nanorods were smaller and accordingly more reactive compared to nanorods produced by other techniques. Notably, the ligand-coating is advantageous for the stable dispersion of the nanorods in common solvents, which facilitates their use in many applications.234

2.1.3.5. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Bulgakova and Bulgakov synthesized graphite, Nb, and YBCO using a pulsed laser ablation technique. They ablated the target materials in a UHV chamber at a pressure of 1 mPa using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm, with pulse duration of 24 ns, and laser fluences in the range of 1 to 25 J cm−2. The targets were polycrystalline graphite, pure Nb, and YBCO superconductor. Based on evidence for the transition from normal evaporation to phase explosion, they found that the ablation rate substantially increased for graphite, Nb, and YCBO targets at 22, 15, and 17.5 J cm−2 as the threshold fluences, respectively, corresponding to the transition from normal vaporization to phase explosion.202
Stoian et al. considered a process called “Coulomb explosion” (CE) as the mechanism of ablation during low fluence ultrashort pulse laser ablation, providing important insight in to ablation mechanisms. CE is a process in which a particle or insulating surface becomes so highly charged that repulsive Coulomb forces are stronger than the cohesive forces holding the material together, and it spontaneously explodes. The energy source for this study was a Ti:Al2O3 oscillator-amplifier laser generating 800 nm light with a pulse duration as low as 0.1 ps. They ablated the target in a UHV chamber at a pressure of 1 mPa using pulse energy densities of 5 and 4 J cm−2 for durations of 0.1 and 0.2 ps, respectively, which were slightly higher than the single-shot ablation threshold. They considered two different regimes for ablation: “gentle” and “strong”. In the first one, the ablation rate is low and just a few monolayers are vaporized by each laser shot. In the “strong” regime, the ablation rate per pulse was an order of magnitude greater and “phase explosion” characteristics were observed that were qualitatively different from the ablation by nanosecond UV laser pulses. They found that ablation in the “gentle” regime led to equal ion momenta due to impulsive CE from the surface region lasting about 1 ps while ablation in the “strong” regime, which is associated with strong plasma optical emission and crater generation, led to equal kinetic energies of ions instead of equal ion momenta.204 While this study did not focus on the particle formation aspects, it was important in proving mechanistic insights into different ablation regimes for ultrafast laser ablation.
Material removal and particle formation in laser ablation is largely determined by an energy balance. The amount and location of energy deposition from the laser, and the rate and pathways of energy dissipation determine the material removal rate. Bulgakova et al. developed a refined thermal model of nanosecond pulsed laser ablation synthesis of niobium, graphite, YBa2C3O7 superconductor, and silicon NPs that could be evaluated for wide variety of laser fluences and included a comprehensive calculation of the solid-melt interface. The experimental data on the ablated mass was the key validation point for the model, in which plasma absorption was an important factor at high laser fluence. Notably, heat conduction in the target was considerable at low laser fluences. Moreover, they found that the laser fluence played a critical role in determining the maximum melt depth for conditions below the ablation threshold. Furthermore, they estimated the possible thermodynamic critical temperatures (related to the maximum temperature reached before the transition from normal ablation to phase explosion) using the refined thermal model.244
Lutey developed a precise laser ablation model based upon one-dimensional heat flow with consideration of temperature dependent material properties and thorough optical propagation. He employed established matrix methods for electromagnetic plane wave propagation in multi-layered media for the numerical optical calculation for the absorption of the laser beam in the target. To consider the effects of reflection from the dielectric-metal interface and the incident laser beam absorption by the products of ablation, he defined a simulated shielding coefficient which allowed him to obtain good agreement between the model predictions and experiments for the ablation of aluminum, in terms of both ablation threshold and melted depth. In addition, he studied the influences of pulse duration, laser wavelength, and target thickness on the aluminum ablation threshold. He found that increasing the pulse duration and the laser wavelength raised the phase explosion threshold, while increasing the sample thickness below 1.5 μm lowered the threshold. Thermal energy transport, optical absorption, and thermal saturation were responsible for the effects of pulse duration, laser wavelength, and sample thickness, respectively. Based on these observations, he concluded that both sample and laser characteristics affected the threshold, due to the significant role of thermal energy penetration into the target during the ablation process.245
The instantaneous material removal from the target surface during pulsed laser ablation continuously changes the position of the material boundary, which is a key challenge for modelling. Wang et al. developed a precise simulation model through finite element analysis of the pulsed laser ablation of aluminum over a wide range of laser fluences with explicit consideration of this boundary change. The finite element analysis was effective for modelling the strong coupling between shape evolution and thermal transport in this system. The simulation predicted both the steady change in the surface of the target at low laser fluences and the ablation depth resulting from phase explosion at high laser fluences. They predicted a threshold fluence of approximately 60 J cm−2 for the transition from target evaporation to phase explosion which was reasonably consistent with experimental data.246
Jiang et al. wrote a comprehensive review on electron dynamics control (EDC) for fabricating nanostructures using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation. In femtosecond ablation, electrons are absorbing the majority of the photon energy during this process, and then transfer this energy to ions on a picosecond timescale. Accordingly, localized transient electron dynamics should be controlled to truly control the ablation process. Their focus was on nanofabrication and micromachining using lasers, which differs from the laser ablation considered here, where particles formed from the ablated material are the desired product. Nonetheless, this study highlights the extent to which the nanofabrication research community has developed models and understanding of laser ablation processes that may be translatable for use by the particle synthesis community.247

2.2. Plasma processing methods
The energy required to drive evaporation or initiate chemical reaction to achieve a state of supersaturation that leads to particle nucleation can be delivered directly into the gas phase using a plasma. Solid, liquid, or vapor precursors can be injected into, or just downstream of, a plasma. In many cases, the droplets or particles injected must be very small to evaporate completely within a short residence time in the plasma or hot post-plasma gases. Plasma processing methods are conveniently divided into two general categories based on the local temperature equilibrium between electrons and ionized gas: thermal plasma processing, in which the electrons and ionized gas reach the same high temperature, and non-thermal plasma processing, in which the electrons have an effective temperature much higher than ions and neutral molecules in the plasma.

2.2.1. Thermal plasma processing. 
In thermal plasma, the electrons and ionized gas are at the same temperature. The rate of intermolecular collisions in the ionized gas is sufficient to maintain local temperature equilibrium. Thermal plasmas are produced by passing an electric current through an ionized gas at high enough pressure to maintain the needed collision rate for thermal equilibration. Two main types of thermal plasma discharges are DC arc jets and high frequency (microwave or radio frequency) induction plasmas. The range of operating temperature in these systems is broad: from 300 °C to the order of 104 °C. In DC arc jets, the source of current for plasma discharge is physical contact with a metallic electrode surface. Although the system is simple and inexpensive, the electrodes may contaminate the product. In high-frequency induction systems, there is no contact between the plasma and its power source. Accordingly, contamination from electrodes and reactor walls can be avoided. Plasma composition (most commonly with argon as the primary component) and frequency (between 200 kHz and 20 MHz) are controllable variables. Because the typical temperature can be on the order of 104 °C, materials with high melting points and solid powder feeds can vaporized.27,29,175,248,249 Use of inexpensive powder feed, rapid cooling rate, and demonstrated scale-up are advantages of thermal plasma processing. The major disadvantages in this method are difficulty of completely vaporizing solid reactants, a relatively complex process, agglomerated particles (often hard), and high energy requirements and costs.175 The temperature field in the plasma reactor, precursor concentration, type of plasma, plasma gas to precursor ratio, quenching rate, residence time, and extraction position are important factors governing production rate and final product properties and quality.250Table 5 provides a summary and Fig. 28 presents representative TEM images of materials synthesized using these techniques.

2.2.1.1. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Although use of thermal plasma to generate fine materials began in the late 1950s251 and continued in the 1960s,252 1970s,253 and 1980s,254 based on the comprehensive review by Young and Pfender,255 we can consider Girshick and coworkers as the pioneers of thermal plasma processing for synthesizing non-agglomerated ultrafine NPs.256 They selected Fe for their study, to understand the nucleation mechanism, which was condensation of a supersaturated vapor followed by coagulation and sintering. Iron required the high-temperature provided by the plasma for evaporation, but could still be considered to undergo an evaporation-condensation process rather than more complex processes involving decomposition of molecular precursors and conversion into a product of different composition. A schematic of their plasma production system is presented in Fig. 29. They used a nominally 20 kW power supply to generate a RF current of 63 A at 2.9 MHz that led to inductive heating of the atmospheric-pressure plasma at a typical power of 4.5 kW. They introduced argon as the plasma gas at 28 lpm through a 45° oriented injection tube with 36 evenly spaced holes at the top of the plasma tube, which was advantageous to stabilize the plasma. They introduced 5 to 9 μm iron powder at a rate of 0.26 to 3.6 mg s−1 and delivered it in 3 to 4 lpm of argon. They reported that the location of the injection tube outlet with respect to the induction coil was important, because the characteristic recirculation vortex of the RF plasma was disrupted when the position was too high, but full vaporization of the precursor was not achieved if the position was too low. Accordingly, the best position for the injection tube outlet was at the midplane of the induction coil. Following the plasma discharge, they used a 64 mm inner diameter by ∼1 m long double-walled stainless-steel tube with a porous inner wall through which argon gas entered to cool the gas and reduce wall deposition of particles. Thus, the micron-size precursor particles first evaporated in the thermal plasma and then iron NPs nucleated homogenously as the gas was cooled in the porous tube downstream. This approach allowed them to produce spherical non-agglomerated iron NPs with average sizes in the range of 20 to 70 nm (increasing with increasing precursor feed rate). In addition, they developed a two-dimensional numerical model to predict the heating and evaporation rate of the injected precursor, nucleation and growth of the NPs, temperature and velocity distributions, and particle transport by convection, diffusion, and thermophoresis. They successfully predicted the average particle sizes, although the size distribution and the particle concentration profiles were not perfectly reproduced. This combination of thermal plasma synthesis with detailed product particle characterization using aerosol instrumentation and with aerosol dynamics modelling was a major advance in thermal plasma synthesis.256

Mohai et al. synthesized zinc ferrite with an average size in the range of 10 to 30 nm using RF thermal plasma. They used two types of precursors: (a) ZnO and Fe2O3 powders mixed at a molar ratio of 1 to 2 and (b) ZnO and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O at a molar ratio of 1 to 6 that were first dissolved in water and then precipitated as hydroxides. They found that using co-precipitated precursors reduced the amount of unreacted compounds, which influenced the particle size. Furthermore, the partial pressure of oxygen was varied to facilitate the synthesis of zinc ferrous ferrites. They also observed a thin zinc oxide layer on the surface of the NPs.312
Son et al. synthesized Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 nanocrystals using RF thermal plasma processing at a power of 50 kW and frequency of 3 MHz. The plasma and carrier gas were argon, the oxidation source was oxygen, and the sheath gas was a mixture of argon and hydrogen, which helped to confine precursors to the reaction zone. Using iron powder as the precursor for Fe3O4, they synthesized polygonal ferrite nanocrystals with an average size in the range of 20 to 30 nm. To synthesize nickel ferrite, they used three types of the precursors: (a) mixed nickel and iron powders at a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:2, (b) a NiFe permalloy powder with Fe powder added to achieve the same Ni:Fe ratio, and (c) a NiFe permalloy powder with a Ni:Fe ratio of 1:1. Going from precursor type (a) to precursor type (c), the nickel content in the synthesized NPs increased. Using type (c) precursor produced NPs with 40 to 48% nickel, exceeding the concentration in stoichiometric nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4), while the other two samples had Ni content lower than NiFe2O4. In addition, they investigated the magnetic properties of the synthesized nickel ferrite and found lower saturation magnetization for higher nickel content.304
Dash et al. employed thermal plasma processing to produce highly-pure MgAl2O4 NPs with uniform elemental distribution of Mg and Al using magnesite (MgCO3) and alumina (Al2O3) as precursors. They used argon as the plasma gas with a plasma current and voltage of 300 A and 50 V, respectively. They investigated the effect of changing the alumina concentration in the precursor mixture on the size of synthesized NPs and found that increasing the alumina concentration led to an increase in grain size.301
Bystrzejewski et al. used a 20 to 25 kW inductively coupled RF thermal plasma torch to produce carbon-encapsulated iron and iron carbide NPs of 5 to 80 nm diameter. They simultaneously injected iron powder and various liquid carbon sources into the thermal plasma torch. They employed two types of plasma gases, argon and a mixture of argon and oxygen. When using Ar/O2 mixture as the plasma gas, the liquid carbon source comprised only hydrocarbons such as hexane (C6H14) and toluene (C7H8) while both the hydrocarbons and alcohols, including methanol (CH4O), ethanol (C2H6O), and hexanol (C6H14O), were used when the plasma gas was Ar. They found that either using a mixture of argon and oxygen or using alcohols as the liquid carbon source with argon as the plasma gas substantially decreased amorphous carbon formation. They attributed removal of this undesired impurity to etching by oxygen. Moreover, they reported that using methanol or ethanol led to the complete removal of the amorphous carbon, with the maximum yield obtained using ethanol. Furthermore, they investigated the magnetic properties of the synthesized NPs and they found that they were ferromagnetic with saturation magnetizations of 64 to 96 emu g−1.298
2.2.1.2. Ceramic oxides. 
Lin et al. employed a novel DC thermal plasma reactor with an operating power of 70 kW at atmospheric pressure for thermal plasma production of zinc oxide NPs. They used zinc powder with an average size of 10 μm as the precursor with a plasma gas flow rate of 200 lpm and carrier gas flow rate of 10 lpm, followed by quenching with a flow of 3000 lpm to stop particle growth and sintering. Injecting nitrogen into the plasma and carrier gas led to nitrogen doping of the zinc oxide NPs. Zinc oxide has a band gap energy of about 3.2 eV and thus only absorbs UV light at wavelengths below 385 nm. Extension of ZnO absorbance to visible wavelengths is needed for practical photocatalytic applications, and nitrogen doping can provide this visible light absorbance. In an uncommon result for aerosol synthesis, they produced zinc oxide NPs with three different morphologies (Fig. 30): spherical, rod-like, and tetrapod-like. They found that the type of plasma gas played a substantial role in controlling the morphology. They used nitrogen as the plasma gas to produce spherical NPs while a 1:1 mixture of argon and nitrogen led to rod- and tetrapod-like NPs. A mixture of air and nitrogen was used as the quenching gas for synthesis of both spherical and tetrapod-like NPs, while air was the quench gas for the synthesis of rod-like NPs. Furthermore, they studied the photocatalytic activity of the NPs and found that the spherical NPs had better anti-microbial ability, while rod- and tetrapod- like NPs performed better for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue.306

Mishra et al. used a unique thermal plasma reactor for the synthesis of carbon-doped ZnO nanocrystals with an average particle size of 32 nm. A schematic of their synthesis reactor is exhibited in Fig. 31. Two vertically arranged graphite electrodes produced an extended arc plasma with the 15 kW DC power. Argon entered through a narrow hole in the upper electrode. Their thermal plasma reactor was unique in combining two different modes of precursor vaporization. The smaller particles in the precursor mixture were vaporized in-flight as in a non-transferred arc mode of operation. Subsequent chemical reactions initiated particle nucleation and growth. Larger particles that were not fully vaporized during transport through the plasma accumulated in a crucible where they effectively became part of the electrode and were vaporized in a transferred arc mode that typically uses one or both electrodes as the particle precursor. The precursor powder was a mixture of zinc oxide and graphite with a molar ratio of 1 to 8, which was injected into the thermal plasma at a rate of 1 g min−1. Additionally, they investigated the magnetic properties of the NPs and they found that carbon-doping increased the saturation magnetization of the zinc oxide NPs by a factor of 3.8. They observed zinc–carbon complexes that were surrounded by a zinc oxide matrix in carbon doped zinc oxide NPs and argued that generation of defects or the development of oxy-carbon clusters was the source of ferromagnetic behaviour in the doped NPs, even though ZnO itself is not ferromagnetic.309

Murali et al. employed thermal plasma processing to produce pristine zinc oxide and indium-doped zinc oxide NPs, both in the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline phase, in a single-step process. They used zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) as the zinc precursor and indium nitrate pentahydrate (In(NO3)3·5H2O) as the indium precursor. Argon (3.5 lpm) carried the precursors (0.5 g min−1) to the reaction zone in which the plasma arc was generated by a DC power supply with a constant power of 15 kW and argon (39 lpm) as the primary plasma gas. They synthesized doped zinc oxide NPs with two different doping levels, 4 at% and 8 at%, and studied the effect of doping on the photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of methylene blue under UV irradiation. They found that increasing the indium doping level led to a redshift in the UV-vis absorbance spectrum and that NPs with 4 at% indium doping provided superior photocatalytic activity compared to undoped or 8 at%-doped NPs. They attributed the good performance to a low recombination rate for photogenerated charge carriers and enhanced separation efficiency of electrons and holes.307
2.2.1.3. Semiconductors. 
Rao et al. developed a plasma expansion process using a DC arc for the synthesis of monodispersed silicon, carbon, and silicon carbide NPs with potential applications in photonics, electronics, engines, turbines, and machine tools. Compared to conventional plasma methods that used a large flow of cold dilution gas to quench the process, expansion through a converging nozzle provided superior control over the quenching process. A schematic of this DC torch and nozzle configuration is shown in Fig. 32. Their plasma reactor was a water-cooled vacuum chamber including a reactant injection system (25 mm long by 15 mm diameter, placed immediately downstream of the nozzle), a plasma torch (Miller SG-1B plasma gun), and a converging nozzle (50 mm long with an inlet inner diameter of 10 mm, outlet inner diameter of 5 mm placed on the top flange of the chamber). They used silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) as the silicon precursor with methane (CH4) as the carbon source, delivered through separate inlets, and Ar and H2 as the plasma gases. After precursor injection, the gas immediately entered the converging nozzle, through which it expanded into a vacuum chamber maintained at 400 Torr. Notably, they measured the temperatures using thermocouples at the inlet and outlet of each component of the reactor to quantify heat losses from the plasma to each component. The arc current, arc voltage, nozzle inlet pressure, nozzle outlet pressure, silicon source flow rate, carbon source flow rate, argon flow rate, and hydrogen flow rate were kept at 200 A, 18–25 V for Ar and 38–65 V for H2, 500 Torr, 400 Torr, 50 sccm, 200 sccm, 30 lpm, and 7.5 lpm, respectively. With these conditions, they successfully synthesized silicon and silicon carbide NPs with average diameters of about 8.5 nm and 90% of the particles below 16 nm in diameter. Carbon particles were even smaller, with 90% below 15 nm in diameter. Based on measured size distributions along with modelling results, they suggested that nucleation of silicon clusters from supersaturated silicon vapor was the initial step in the production of silicon carbide, as well as silicon, NPs. In the case of silicon carbide, this initial nucleation was followed by surface reactions with carbon-containing species.265

Iijima and Ichihashi produced 1 nm-diameter SWCNT by spark discharge generation. Their anode was a simple 10 mm diameter graphitic carbon rod, while the cathode (bottom electrode in vertical arrangement) was a 20 mm diameter carbon rod with a shallow dimple to hold a small piece of iron. The background gas was 20% methane and 80% Ar. A DC current of 200 A at 20 V created the carbon arc discharge between the electrodes. The evaporation of the small piece of iron inside the cathode electrode led to the simultaneous formation of iron carbide above the cathode and nucleation of carbon soot particles by evaporation of the carbon cathode as well as from decomposition of methane. They found that it was impossible to synthesize SWCNT when any of the three components of Ar, iron, and methane was omitted. They suggested that the iron particles played an essential role in production of SWCNT even though there was no evidence of iron particles at the tubule tips.269 Iijima and Ichihashi's synthesis method produced SWCNT at a low yield. Journet et al. developed techniques for extending this method to large-scale production of SWCNT. They filled the cathode with a mixture of a metallic catalyst and graphite powder instead of filling it with iron. The catalysts were bimetallic mixtures including Ni–Co, Ni–Y, and Co–Y in different atomic percentages. They used a current of 100 A at 30 V to produce the spark between the electrodes in a He atmosphere. The highest yield was achieved with a catalyst mixture of 4.2% Ni and 1% Y. They produced SWCNT with diameters as low as around 1.4 nm at yields from 70 to 90%. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy) images of these materials are shown in Fig. 33.270 Bethune et al. used almost the same strategy to synthesize SWCNTs, but they used cobalt as the catalyst which led to the formation of non-graphitic single-atomic-layer walls with a diameter of around 1.2 nm.271

Li and Ishigaki employed thermal plasma processing to produce titania nanocrystals with an average size in the range of 10 to 50 nm. They used titanium carbide (TiC) powder microparticles as the titanium precursor. A schematic of their reactor is shown in Fig. 34. The plasma reactor consisted of a stainless-steel cylinder with an inner diameter of 250 mm with a conical exit section. It was held at a pressure of 53 to 80 kPa. A 2 MHz induction-plasma torch was employed at powers from 25 to 40 kW. The titanium precursor was injected at 1.6 to 1.8 g min−1 from the top of the plasma torch into the center of the plasma region, carried by Ar or an Ar/CO2 mixture at flow rates from 2.5 to 10 lpm. They used three different sheath gas mixtures: Ar–O2, Ar–He, and Ar–H2. In some cases, O2 was also added downstream of the plasma torch. When no O2 was added, CO2 in the carrier gas provided oxygen to the system. When the Ar–O2 mixture was used as sheath gas, O2 not only served as the oxidizing agent to produce titania NPs, but also increased the thermal conductivity of the gas mixture, enhancing heat transfer. The oxygen flow rate was variable from 2.5 to 20 lpm in the 90 lpm total gas flow to the system. This process produced a mixture of hexagonal rutile and spherical anatase crystals with an average size of 20 to 50 nm. They found that changing the oxygen flow rate at fixed total flow rate of the gaseous mixture led to a change in the anatase content from 20 to 75 wt%. In addition, they reported that rapid cooling had greater effect than introducing oxygen into the coagulated particles to synthesize oxygen-deficient rutile. Also, they adjusted the flow rate of the carrier gas to control the phase composition and they could synthesize NPs with above 90 wt% rutile content by increasing the flow rate of the carrier gas. For experiments with Ar–He sheath gas, O2 was injected at the tail part of the Ar–He plasma. Addition of He dramatically increased thermal conductivity of the plasma. This produced a dramatic decrease in the size of titania clusters and change in phase composition due to the very short oxidizing reaction time at the tail of the plasma. They concluded that cluster size could be controlled precisely by introducing the oxygen stream in various part of the plasma. For the Ar–H2–CO2 plasma, CO2 at a flow rate of 0.5 lpm mixed with 4.5 or 9.5 lpm Ar served as the carrier gas, while H2 was added to the sheath gas. Among the plasma gas mixtures tested, the mixture of Ar and H2 had the highest thermal conductivity. At temperatures above 5000 K, decomposition of carbon dioxide produced oxygen and carbon monoxide. This composition required a higher plasma operating power of 40 kW due to higher heat dissipation by this plasma. This plasma produced pure rutile titania NPs. Overall, this work showed that a thermal plasma oxidation process can effectively control both the size and the crystalline phase content of titania nanocrystals.290

Padmanabhan et al. investigated the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs, mostly below 20 nm diameter, synthesized using a reactive thermal plasma method. They used TiH2 powder as the precursor for titanium and injected it in the Ar thermal plasma jet along with air as a source of oxygen. The thermal plasma synthesized titania NPs were a mixture of anatase and rutile, but the anatase was converted to rutile by thermal treatment above 600 °C. The synthesized titania NPs exhibited promising results for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue.291
Lee et al. used a DC plasma jet to synthesize aluminium-doped titania NPs with high quality and an average size of 10 to 50 nm. A schematic of their reactor is presented in Fig. 35. It included a DC generator with an input power of 8 kW and current of 300 A as the source of energy, a reaction tube, two separate injection ports for the host and dopant precursors, a quench chamber, a filter, and a vacuum system to adjust the pressure to around 100 kPa. Ar at 10 lpm was used as the plasma gas. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) was introduced into the plasma region in Ar carrier gas while aluminum chloride (AlCl3) was dissolved in methanol and introduced by a metering pump. The concentration of AlCl3 in methanol was varied, using a constant flow rate of 0.3 sccm to produce Al-doped titania NPs with Al content of 1 to 8 wt%. In addition, they introduced oxygen at a flow rate of 1.5 lpm to ensure oxidation. They found that increasing the amount of dopant decreased the size of the NPs. Moreover, they investigated the optical properties of the synthesized NPs and found that increased doping shifted the absorption band edge from the UV region to the visible region.295

Wan et al. used atmospheric pressure thermal plasma processing to synthesize nano-silicon/graphene composites in a one-step process. They used silicon powders with an average size of 6.5 μm and graphite power with a particle size of 200 mesh as the raw materials, and mutually ground them for 10 minutes. After grinding, the powder was delivered at 1 g min−1 in argon carrier gas into the thermal plasma torch. Argon also served as the plasma-forming gas. They used a DC power supply with a maximum power of 70 kW to generate the plasma. They asserted that the large graphene sheets with fewer than 5 layers were produced first, and then silicon NPs with an average size of 28 nm nucleated and grew on their surfaces. They found that the bonding between silicon and carbon played a key role in the synthesis of these nanocomposites. Based on this finding, they proposed that silicon vapor played a role as an active gas that prevented graphene from forming closed (fullerenic) structures. These nanocomposites could be used in lithium-ion batteries due to their ability to accommodate the volume changes of silicon during battery cycling.283
2.2.1.4. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Fabry et al. synthesized carbon black by hydrocarbon cracking in a pilot scale (100 kW) plasma reactor. A 100 kW 3-phase AC generator drove the plasma torch with three 13 mm diameter electrodes to produce a plasma flow in a large cylindrical graphite reaction chamber with a height of 2 m and inner diameter of 28 cm inside a water-cooled stainless-steel vessel with an inner diameter of 40 cm. The nominal power of the AC generator was 175 kVA with a maximum current of 266 A, short circuit voltage of 760 V, and frequency of 50 Hz. They used ethylene (C2H4) as the carbon precursor and N2, Ar, or a 0.95:0.05 mixture of Ar:H2 as the plasma gas. They found that the plasma gas dramatically affected arc voltage, arc current, and plasma enthalpy so that the values for N2, Ar, and a mixture of Ar and H2 were 195, 55, and 71 V; 199, 2031, and 198 A; and 20.2, 2.8, and 5.2 kW h Nm−3, respectively. Although they observed three populations of particles, the particles mostly had a spherical morphology with an average size in the range of 150 to 200 nm. They suggested that the particle size and structure resulted from internal mixing phenomena within the reactor. Recirculation of particles through the hot plasma region led to graphitization of initially amorphous carbon, while extended residence time associated with recirculation allowed particle growth.266 This group used the same set-up for synthesis of two different morphologies of carbon nanomaterials: carbon nanotubes with a “stacked-cup” structure and carbon nano-necklace structures formed by the repetition of multi-walled carbon spheres in a bell-like structure with encapsulated metal particles. These two different morphologies are exhibited in Fig. 36. In this case, carbon black coated with 3% Ni and Co was injected into the thermal plasma. After total vaporization in the plasma, catalyst (Ni and Co) particles nucleated first, then carbon structures grew over them before the plasma gas and the precursor mixture were quenched and the final products were extracted. The key advantage of this process compared to the conventional arc and laser processes was that the flow rate of solid carbon was not limited by the rate of electrode erosion and could be independently controlled along with the flow rates of plasma gas and metal catalysts. They used helium and nitrogen as the plasma gases and they found that the nature of the plasma gas affected the morphology of the NPs. The temperature of the reactor (wall temperature) was in the range of 1000 to 1300 °C (the metal catalyst was in the solid state in this range) using helium as the plasma gas, which led to carbon nanotubes while it was in the range of 1700 to 2400 °C (the metal catalyst was liquid in this range) using nitrogen as the plasma gas, which led to carbon nano-necklaces. This showed that the temperature field in the plasma reactor played a substantial role in the growth of carbon nanotubes with different morphologies.250

Kim et al. synthesized high-quality SWCNT at a high production rate of around 100 g h−1 by thermal plasma processing, demonstrating potential for commercial applications. Their set-up (Fig. 37a) included three parts: (a) a reaction chamber with a powder feeder through which carbon black of three different grades (M120, M280, and M880) with binary and ternary catalysts such as Ni/Co (0.6/0.6 at%), Ni/Co/CeO2 (0.6/0.6/0.2 at%), and Ni/Co/Y2O3 (0.6/0.6/0.4 at%), were delivered in Ar to the center of a plasma torch driven by a 60 kW power supply at 3 MHz. Delivery to the center of the plasma torch exposes the precursors to much higher temperature than that of the plasma jet (about 9000 K instead of below 7000 K). The plasma gas was argon, although other inert gases like He or hydrocarbon species like C2H2 and CH4 could also be used. A laminar flow of sheath gas was used to confine the plasma. To investigate the effect of the thermodynamic properties of the plasma gas mixture on the synthesis process, they employed two types of sheath gas, He and Ar/He mixture. Upon leaving the plasma, gases entered a double-walled cylindrical tube containing interchangeable graphite inserts that facilitated flexible control of cooling rate and temperature gradient, which play a key role in the synthesis of SWCNT. This was followed by a quenching chamber including two double-walled cylindrical sections for rapid cooling by the injection of additional inert gas and to initiate oxidation reactions to remove impurities using various oxidizing agents. Finally, a particle collection system including a filtration unit with three porous ceramic elements was used to collect the solid products and a heat exchanger cooled the residual gases before they were exhausted through a vacuum pump. With this large-scale process, they produced carbon soot containing ∼40 wt% SWCNT like those shown in Fig. 37b–d. The plasma composition, grade of carbon black precursor, and type of catalyst each affected the quality and the purity of the SWCNT. Although the quality of the SWCNTs was not as high as that of products synthesized by laser ablation, the thermal plasma method allows much higher SWCNT production rates.272

2.2.1.5. High-strength nanomaterials. 
Ishigaki and coworkers also synthesized TaC NPs by thermal plasma processing. They atomized liquid tantalum ethoxide (Ta(OC2H5)5) and delivered it as small droplets directly into a thermal plasma. They employed a 40 kW, 2 MHz RF power supply with Ar as the plasma gas. Both the tantalum ethoxide precursor and TaC NPs are air sensitive and required special handling. They introduced a 0.95:0.05 Ar:O2 mixture to the product NPs for controlled oxidation and thereafter collected the particles in air from the filter and the reactor walls. They found that adding hydrogen to argon as the sheath gas enhanced the quality of the NPs by removing carbon from the reaction mixture through generation of hydrocarbons, but that excess hydrogen could suppress the synthesis of TaC. Accordingly, they reported that the optimum molar ratio of hydrogen to the tantalum precursor was about 25 which produced powder with 97.4 wt% TaC. Furthermore, they introduced Ar or He at a flow rate of 20 lpm at the tail of the plasma torch and found that mean NP size decreased from 12.3 to 7.8 nm upon injecting He.318
Ryu et al. synthesized tungsten NPs by injecting ammonium paratungstate (H40N10O41W12·xH2O) powder into a thermal plasma in a mixture of argon and hydrogen carrier gas. They investigated the effect of operating parameters inducing torch power (10 to 20 kW), argon plasma gas flow (29 to 57 lpm), and hydrogen concentration in the carrier gas (from no hydrogen to above the stoichiometric content required to reduce WO3 to W) on the particle size and properties. Torch power and plasma gas flow rate did not influence the grain size of W below 25 nm while increasing the hydrogen concentration in the carrier gas decreased the size of the NPs in that range. Increasing the hydrogen concentration above the stoichiometric amount led to nearly complete reduction of WO3. Without any H2, WO3 was the main product. Accordingly, they synthesized spherical tungsten NPs with diameters below 50 nm. They concluded that rapid evaporation of the precursor at the high plasma temperature and subsequent fast quenching to yield tungsten NPs in a single-step process, make this technique superior to conventional multi-step processes for this purpose.320
Oh et al. employed RF thermal plasma processing to produce W–Cu nanocomposites with varied copper content (5, 10, and 20 wt%). The precursors were tungsten oxide (WO3) and copper oxide (CuO), which were mixed to produce nanocomposites with the same Cu content as the precursor. They used oxide precursors because of their much lower boiling points compared to W and Cu, which facilitated vaporization at a power of 30 kW. Ar was used as plasma, sheath, and carrier gas while N2 served as the quench gas. To reduce the precursor mixture, hydrogen was added to the sheath gas at an Ar to H2 ratio of 6 to 1. The product composition matching that of the precursor mixture demonstrated the full evaporation and efficient reduction provided by the thermal plasma process.325
Tong et al. synthesized non-stoichiometric titanium carbide below 100 nm in diameter using thermal plasma processing. The precursor was titanium powder delivered to an Ar plasma in a mixture of argon and methane, which served as the carbon source. They studied the effects of the feed composition, flow rate, and plasma power and found that to avoid titanium and carbon impurities in the final products, the feed mixture should be equimolar, with a feed rate below 5 g min−1, at maximum power.288
Heo et al. used a two-step process involving synthesis of TiC–graphene nanocomposites by thermal plasma processing and subsequent conversion of titanium carbide to titania using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and heat treatment, to remove impurities and produce highly-pure TiO2–graphene nanocomposites with TiO2 particles below 50 nm in diameter and 5 to 10 graphene layers. The plasma reactor comprised a non-transferred DC plasma torch with 30 kW DC power supply, a reaction tube, and a quench chamber. Titanium tetraisopropoxide was delivered through a bubbler at an optimum temperature of 473 K for producing TiC–graphene nanocomposites. Fig. 38 illustrates the synthesis mechanism and the morphology of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites. This study demonstrated a cost- and time-efficient synthesis method that could potentially also produce other metal oxide–carbon nanocomposites.293

Fathalizadeh et al. synthesized boron nitride of varying morphologies using a plasma torch driven by a 60 kW RF power supply at 7 MHz. The plasma and carrier gas were nitrogen. They used hexagonal boron nitride powder or amorphous boron powder as the precursor and found that the latter gave higher conversion to BN NPs. At atmospheric pressure of nitrogen, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) formed and substantial boron remained unreacted. In that case, boron nitrides formed with a “nanococoon” morphology, comprising a shell of boron nitride around boron particles. With increasing nitrogen pressure, the morphology changed from nanococoon to nanotube so that between 2 and 3 atm the amount of the nanocoons diminished, and above 3 atm, nanococoons could barely be observed. The different morphologies are shown in Fig. 39. Based on these observations, they proposed that after injection of the boron precursor into the thermal plasma and subsequent melting, its surface reacts with nitrogen within and at the outlet of the plasma plume. The collision rate between the N2 atoms and B droplets increases with increasing density of the plasma plume and, as a result, the reaction rate is accelerated and BNNTs form. They produced BNNTs at 35 g h−1 which was 300 times greater than that achieved by laser ablation.259

Mishra et al. used thermal plasma processing and subsequent acid leaching to prepare high-purity boron carbide NPs. They mixed boric acid (B(OH)3) with activated carbon at mass ratios of 4 and 5 in 5% dextrin, then granulated and dried it and injected the powder into an Ar plasma. After the synthesis of the initial NPs, they used acid leaching to remove impurities such as amorphous carbon and B2O3. In addition, they investigated the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of the final products at temperatures up to 1000 °C.257
Oh et al. developed a novel triple DC thermal plasma reactor and produced tungsten carbide NPs at atmospheric pressure. Their set-up (Fig. 40) incorporated three plasma torches, three DC power supplies, seven water-cooled reactor segments, and a cyclone filter. Argon and nitrogen were mixed at a flow rate of 14 lpm each as the plasma gas. Tungsten powder with a typical size of 1 μm was used as the tungsten source, which they combined with three different carbon sources: MWCNT with a diameter of 10 nm, amorphous carbon with a size of 6 μm, and methane. The tungsten and carbon sources were mixed at a molar ratio of 1 to 1.5 and injected at a rate of about 500 mg min−1 through a tube placed between the torches, and into the high temperature region at the intersection of the three plasma torches, using argon as carrier gas. The input power for each torch was 9 to 10 kW. The raw materials evaporated in the high temperature zone, and subsequent condensation produced NPs below 100 nm in diameter. They studied the effect of carbon source on the morphology and crystal structure of NPs and found that W2C was the main product for all the carbon sources, although WC and WC1−x were also present. Using MWCNT as the carbon source produced tungsten carbide/MWCNT nanocomposites in addition to spherical tungsten carbide NPs. Synthesis using methane led to the formation of only spherical tungsten carbide NPs, while rod-shaped tungsten carbide NPs were produced along with the spherical ones when amorphous carbon was used. Moreover, they investigated the effect of W/CH4 composition ratio and found that increasing this ratio shifted the product from W2C to WC1−x.323 This group also used their triple DC thermal plasma configuration to generate boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). The precursor was hexagonal boron nitride powder with a size of 1 μm. The plasma gas comprised 4 lpm argon and 8 lpm nitrogen, and hydrogen was introduced as a reactant gas. Each torch was run at a power of 6.9 to 7.5 kW, at a 100 A constant current. The precursor was delivered from the top of the triple torch into the plasma, at a rate of 0.5 to 0.6 g min−1, in 5 lpm argon. This produced multi-walled (maximum 5 walls) BNNTs with an average diameter of around 7 nm and high crystallinity. Using the triple torch configuration, the plasma flame length reached 30 cm. Accordingly, the high temperature region was larger than that of conventional configurations. The triple torch configuration allowed direct injection of the precursors into the core of the plasma, increasing the BNNT productivity by avoiding precursor flow into the edges of the plasma flame as occurs in a single torch configuration, because of the high velocity and viscosity of the central plasma flame. In addition, they employed numerical analysis of flow in the system and thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to elucidate the role of hydrogen in the nanotubes’ growth. They found that adding hydrogen led to the formation of NH, NH2, and N2H2, which delayed the recombination of nitrogen into N2. B–H species were also generated, leading to B–N–H intermediates. The dehydrogenation of these intermediates with early boron nucleation in the quenching process led to the growth of BNNTs. In addition, the high thermal conductivity of hydrogen expanded the high temperature and high enthalpy zones that, along with the expansion of the vortex region, provided longer residence times of the B–N–H intermediates in the reaction zone. Ultimately, they produced 12.6 g h−1 of BNNTs at a power of 21.4 kW, which shows promise for economical production of BNNTs at industrial scale.260

2.2.1.6. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Girshick et al. developed one of the first realistic models for the nucleation and growth of NPs in thermal plasma processing. First, they derived a nondimensional form of the aerosol general dynamic equation, with appropriate simplifying assumptions, and solved it numerically. A key assumption was that in such a thermal plasma, the nucleated particles can be treated as electrically neutral, because most particle growth occurs after the gas has cooled to a temperature where ionization fractions, at thermal equilibrium, are small. They then used experimental data for the thermal plasma processing of Fe NPs to produce a dimensional form of the equation and its predictions. They also applied their model to SiC NPs. Their model predicted that reactant concentration and cooling rate (which determined the effective residence time for particle nucleation and growth) were the key factors controlling primary particle size, with increasing reactant concentration and decreasing cooling rate leading to larger primary particle size. They also noted that thermophoresis, electric charge effects, London-van der Waals forces, and diffusion across concentration gradients could all be additional factors affecting the collision rate in thermal plasma processing, but were not accounted for in their simplified model.327 More recent studies have gone on to relax many of these assumptions. Girshick and Chiu performed another modelling study for the thermal plasma processing of iron NPs that relaxed the assumption of irreversible coagulation of all clusters, down to single atoms, but instead included evaporation from small clusters. They explicitly incorporated evaporation and coagulation terms in a set of cluster-balance rate equations for these small clusters. They retained other simplifying assumptions such as one-dimensional flow field, completion of any relevant chemistry prior to homogeneous nucleation, and the condensation of a single species. This provided a more realistic description of the homogeneous nucleation event, which was found to be the main factor influencing the final size distribution of primary particles. The homogeneous nucleation occurs very quickly in thermal plasma processing, which leads to abrupt generation of stable clusters and particles, followed by Brownian coagulation. Furthermore, they found that the number concentration of the NPs, in addition to the size of NPs, is strongly dependent upon the cooling rate in the reaction zone and concentration of the reactants. Again, increasing precursor concentration and decreasing cooling rate led to production of fewer, but larger NPs.328 While these overall trends mirror intuitive, qualitative expectations, these modelling efforts represent a key step toward more quantitative understanding of the magnitude of each effect.
Ananthapadmanabhan et al. employed thermal plasma processing of aluminium metal in an oxygen atmosphere to synthesize γ-Al2O3 rather than more stable α-Al2O3 NPs, which was possible because of the highly-non-equilibrium nature of the process. Indeed, the high temperature of the reaction zone along with the highly-exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction led to the breakdown of the alumina NPs into aluminium and oxygen species which recombined in the cooler zones to generate γ-Al2O3 NPs with diameters of up to 30 nm. For sufficiently small Al precursor particles, complete oxidation and evaporation led to production of only nanosized γ-Al2O3 by gas-to-particle routes, but for larger precursor particles or lower plasma power, evaporation was incomplete. To understand this effect, they developed a numerical one-dimensional model of aluminum particle melting, oxidation, and evaporation that included the oxidation enthalpy of reaction in the energy balance, along with enthalpies of phase transitions and a phenomenological model of heat transfer to the particles. This model provided fair agreement with experimental observations of complete vs. incomplete conversion of aluminum precursor microparticles into γ-Al2O3 NPs.329 Note that this modelling effort focuses on an entirely different part of the process compared to that of Girshick and co-workers discussed previously. When solid feed particles are large or form a thermally-stable phase (like alumina), achieving complete precursor evaporation can be a significant barrier. In other cases, like those considered by Girshick, complete precursor dissociation into atoms can safely be assumed. Modelling of systems where these processes overlap, i.e. where new particles nucleate before all precursors have evaporated or dissociated, is an even greater challenge.
Shigeta and Watanabe developed a numerical growth model for thermal plasma processing of binary alloy NPs that considered the two-dimensional particle size and composition distribution of the product particles. The claimed advantages of their model included its simplicity and associated straightforward numerical solution algorithm. They discretized the particle size and composition distribution with 41 uniformly-spaced compositions and 54 logarithmically-spaced sizes. They took the smallest particle size to be a cluster of 10 atoms. Mass-conserving algorithms were adopted for treating growth by condensation and coagulation, which transfer particles between the discrete size-composition nodes. They employed a binary homogeneous nucleation model based on the work of Wyslouzil and Wilemski.330 Their heterogeneous condensation model considered cluster-size- and composition-dependent vapor pressures of small molten droplets, but required assumptions for unknown activity coefficients in the liquid and accommodation coefficients for atom-droplet collisions due to lack of data. Their treatment of Brownian coagulation spanned the full range of Knudsen numbers. Primary particle growth was considered to be complete when a particle size- and composition-dependent freezing point temperature was reached. They investigated metal-silicon systems as case studies. Employing the two-dimensional model, they were effectively able to simulate the simultaneous and collective combined processes of binary homogeneous nucleation, binary heterogeneous cocondensation, and coagulation of the clusters to understand the growth mechanisms of binary molybdenum-silicon and titanium-silicon systems based upon particle size-composition distributions. Furthermore, they understood that the growth behaviors and mature states in the binary nanoalloy systems were significantly influenced by the saturation pressures of the materials.331 This group used the same modelling framework in conjunction with an experimental study of the synthesis of TiB2 NPs with an RF induction thermal plasma. They introduced the precursor mixture of titanium and boron powders into the thermal plasma to produce TiB2 NPs with average sizes ranging from 10 to 30 nm after immediate evaporation and subsequent quenching. Decreasing the feed rate of precursor mixture and increasing the ratio of boron to titanium resulted in ideal conditions for the formation of TiB2 due to enhancement of the evaporated and nucleated boron molar ratio in the thermal plasma. Moreover, they found based upon the agreement between the experimental and modelling results that a decrease in the feed rate along with a decrease in the titanium concentration in the precursor mixture decreased the size of NPs because of the increase in the number concentration of boron nuclei. They concluded that thermal plasma processing is an effective technique to synthesize compound NPs in which a large difference in the saturation pressure of the elements would otherwise cause severe difficulties in controlling the cocondensation process.332
Shigeta applied a computational model appropriate for thermal plasma driven turbulent flows and sharp NP concentration distribution gradients to develop a three-dimensional time-dependent growth-transport model for the synthesis of nanomaterials by thermal plasma processing. His large-eddy-simulation (LES) of the turbulent flow included Joule heating and the Lorentz force. The subgrid-scale models considered both laminar and turbulent states because of their co-existence across the wide range of density and transport properties encountered in thermal plasma processing. His particle nucleation and growth model considered only concentration and average particle size at a given point (in space and time) within the reactor. Thus, its predictions are spatiotemporal profiles of mean particle size and particle concentration (of spherical particles) along with temperature and velocity. With this approach, three-dimensional distributions of the average size and the number density of the NPs were obtained at a manageable computational cost. Silicon was considered as a case study. He found that multiscale vortices were created by an argon thermal plasma jet even far from the plasma torch outlet. Low-temperature thin vortex rings in the upstream region surrounded the high-temperature thicker vortex rings with a double-layer structure. As they moved downstream, the thinner vortex rings transformed into smaller vortices, while the thicker vortex rings deformed. Moreover, he observed that the NPs were formed at the edge of the thermal plasma and that regions with lower number concentration of the NPs contained larger NPs, consistent with coagulation as the main growth mechanism of the NPs. Furthermore, he found that a longer and straighter thermal plasma jet was produced by applying a uniform magnetic field in the axial direction, due to the Lorentz force and Joule heating. This field also prevented turbulent diffusion of silicon vapor and NPs through vortices, which produced larger NPs around the thermal plasma. Based on cross-correlation analysis, he found the temperature fluctuation at the upstream plasma edge was a key factor controlling the NP size and concentration distribution far from the plasma jet.333 Shigata applied the same general approach to DC thermal plasma processing as well, without the Lorenz force and Joule heating, again showing complex spatiotemporal distributions of particle formation.334,335 Overall, these studies paint a much more complex picture of particle production from thermal plasmas than had generally been assumed in earlier 1- and 2-dimensional steady-state models, like those discussed above. Nonetheless, the earlier models proved valuable in rationalizing and, to a limited extent, predicting trends in particle formation.
Kim et al. performed numerical modelling along with in situ optical emission spectroscopy to investigate the role of hydrogen in the thermal plasma processing of hexagonal boron nitride powder to synthesize BNNTs. They found that hydrogen affected both chemical and physical pathways to enhance the rapid growth of BNNTs. The modelling studies revealed that the high thermal conductivity of hydrogen facilitated complete vaporization and rapid cooling of the precursor, leading to earlier formation of nanosized boron aerosol droplets to grow BNNTs. They predicted quenching rates of around 105 K s−1 for the initial cooling to the boron nucleation temperature of around 4200 K. Moreover, the release of the heat of reaction of hydrogen atom recombination, starting at about 3800 K helped to maintain the temperature of the plasma gas above the boron solidification temperature of around 2300 K. This longer residence time between boron droplet nucleation and solidification extended the active growth zone of BNNTs further downstream in the plasma reactor. Based on optical emission spectroscopy results, they observed that using hydrogen favored the formation of BH and NH radicals, by reactions involving H radicals, which slowed the formation of N2 or N2+ species and stabilized B or N radicals, which facilitated the formation of BN.262 Although this study did not explicitly model the BNNT growth process, the insights provided by the simulation of the flow and temperature fields proved extremely valuable in understanding the role of hydrogen in promoting BNNT growth. This illustrates how thermofluid modelling, even without explicit aerosol dynamics modelling, can contribute to the understanding of aerosol synthesis processes.
Kim et al. performed a simulation and experimental study on thermal plasma processing using a triple DC plasma torch to synthesize NPs. They analyzed the thermal plasma characteristics inside the reactor for plasma-forming gas compositions of Ar, Ar–H2, and Ar–N2 with different carrier gases (Ar, He, and N2) for introducing the precursor powder along the reactor centerline between the three torches. They found that adding nitrogen or hydrogen, with relatively high thermal conductivity, to argon enhanced heat transfer which expanded the region of high temperature to better vaporize the precursor. Among these two highly-thermally-conductive gases, adding nitrogen resulted longer residence time in the zones with a temperature higher than the vaporization temperatures of the tungsten powder and carbon nanotube precursors, which explained observed improvement in the vaporization degree using Ar–N2 mixtures. Compared to H2, adding N2 provided both a higher initial temperature and faster cooling rate. Both cooled to about 3000 K at the same point in the reactor, and beyond that point the temperature with H2 was higher. The effect of the carrier gas was relatively small, simply because its flow rate was much smaller than the gas flow rates through the plasma torches. Nonetheless, He, with high thermal conductivity, produced the smallest cold region near the point of injection of the precursor powder in carrier gas, because of its high thermal conductivity. This could result in somewhat improved vaporization. In general, they concluded that tuning the plasma gas concentration can enable processing of target materials with appropriate residence time in a specific temperature zone, and this control of the thermal environment can improve process performance for achieving desired materials.336


2.2.2. Non-thermal plasma processing. 
In a non-thermal plasma, the temperature of electrons (typically 20000 to 50000 K) is much higher than that of the ionized gas (near ambient temperature). A non-thermal plasma can be generated by application of an electric field to a low-pressure gas in short pulses or at high frequency, such that electrons respond to the time-dependent field, but do not efficiently transfer energy to atoms and ions. Accordingly, electrons and the ionized gas do not achieve local temperature equilibrium.36,175,249,337 This method enables synthesis of high melting point materials, even though the process gas remains relatively cool, because nanomaterials are heated by surface reactions. This method, unlike other aerosol methods, can limit agglomeration because the synthesized nanomaterials typically acquire a negative charge and thus repel one another. This can lead to narrow size distribution and the synthesis of very small nanomaterials with sizes between 2 and 10 nm. The negatively charged walls of plasma reactors also confine the nanomaterials, reducing losses to the reactor walls. This method is suitable for efficient doping during nanomaterial growth because of the irreversible, far-from-equilibrium nature of particle growth. In addition, non-oxide nanomaterials can be synthesized by this process.36,175,337 The requirement of relatively complex equipment, use of expensive gaseous or volatile reactants, and limited demonstrations of scale-up are the most important disadvantages of this method.175Table 6 provides a summary and Fig. 41 presents representative TEM images of materials synthesized using this technique.

2.2.2.1. Semiconductors. 
Although there were some reports on the synthesis of non-agglomerated freestanding nanocrystals though continuous-flow non-thermal plasma processing in the 1990's,338 we can consider Mangolini, Thimsen, and Kortshagen to be the pioneers of this field based upon their development of a process for synthesis of luminescent crystalline silicon NPs with average size below 10 nm in high yield.339 In their set-up (Fig. 42), they used a cylindrical quartz tube with an inner diameter of 1/4” and an outer diameter of 3/8”. A mixture of Ar as the plasma gas and silane (SiH4) as the source of silicon flowed through this tube at pressures of 0.186 to 1.86 kPa. A matching network provided an RF power of 200 W at a frequency of 27.12 MHz to two copper ring electrodes, with up to 30 W actually coupled to the plasma. They divided the plasma in their set-up to two regimes: (a) an intense plasma regime in the region between the electrodes and the vacuum chamber placed 1 inch downstream of the electrodes, and (b) a dimmer plasma regime between the electrodes and the gas inlet. By considering the length of 1 in as the effective plasma zone they derived residence times for flow rates from 12 to 60 sccm ranging from 1.4 to 7.0 ms. They flowed silane as the precursor at flow rates from 0.4 to 2.4 sccm. The electron impact dissociation of silane and subsequent fragment clustering produced crystalline silicon NPs. They collected the NPs on fine stainless-steel meshes placed 1 inch downstream from the plasma region, or on the walls of liquid-nitrogen-cooled quartz tubes. Their set-up provided a unique plasma environment that prevented agglomeration of ultrafine luminescent silicon NPs with average sizes in the range of 2 to 8 nm and a yield of 14 to 52 mg h−1. They pointed out that parallelizing the process could be the best route to scale-up of this approach.339

Xia et al. used the same strategy to synthesize silicon nanocrystals and, through functionalization of them with triplet-accepting ligands, made them useful as non-toxic upconverting NPs for potential biological imaging or environmental sensing applications. This would differentiate them from previously reported toxic nanomaterials with comparable upconversion properties. The surface hydride (SiHx) groups present on the silicon nanocrystals synthesized by non-thermal plasma processing made them more amenable to thermal hydrosilylation and post functionalization compared to those synthesized by many other techniques. They reported spin-triplet excitation transfer from silicon to anthracene ligands over 15 ns by a single Dexter energy transfer step with an approximately 15% yield upon photoexcitation of the NPs. Pairing with 9,10-diphenylanthracene emitters led to green and red upconversion with 7.0% ± 0.9% efficiency, which would make them appropriate for biological applications upon incorporation into aqueous micelles.340
The Kortshagen group used almost the same set-up to produce free-standing germanium NPs with a narrow size distribution and controllable size in the range of 4 to 50 nm by varying the plasma region residence time from about 30 to 440 ms. RF power of 50 to 90 W at 13.56 MHz drove the plasma at a pressure of about 266 Pa. Germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) was delivered from a bubbler kept at a pressure of 200 kPa in Ar carrier gas with a GeCl4:Ar ratio of 5:95. Ar was used as the plasma gas as well, allowing control of the total gas flow rate at fixed GeCl4 delivery rate. Hydrogen was added to the Ar stream to remove chlorine generated by decomposition of GeCl4 through formation of HCl. They investigated the effect of plasma power on the crystallinity of the NPs and found that fully amorphous to fully crystalline NPs could be produced by varying the plasma power, independent of other process parameters.372
Gresback et al. further investigated the crystallinity, size, oxidation, and photoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals synthesized by non-thermal plasma processing. A plasma generated at a higher RF frequency of 70 MHz was used to decompose the precursor. The gaseous precursor mixture included 2.4% silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) as the silicon precursor, 5 to 70% hydrogen as a chlorine scavenger and Ar as the plasma gas. The total flow rate of the gaseous mixture was varied from 20 to 368 sccm. The total pressure of the plasma reactor ranged from 1 to 12 torr. They found that the input power and the reactor conditions were the main factors affecting the crystallinity of the synthesized NPs. Higher total pressures in the reactor and higher hydrogen concentrations were necessary for higher power in the system, which led to the synthesis of crystalline NPs. Otherwise, the NPs were amorphous. The size of NPs depended on the residence time of the gaseous mixture in the plasma and ranged from 3 to 15 nm. Hydrogen and chlorine were both present on the surface of the silicon nanocrystals which made them more susceptible to oxidation than silicon NPs terminated only by hydrogen. Moreover, the synthesized silicon nanocrystals exhibited photoluminescence with a peak emission wavelength tunable from around 650 to 900 nm and a profile that was almost Gaussian.346
Yasar-Inceoglu et al. compared the synthesis of NPs using silicon tetrachloride vs. silane and found that using the former led to the presence of chlorine at the surface and within the core part of the NPs, which decreased the stability of the crystalline structure of the NPs. Accordingly, a higher power was necessary to synthesize high-quality silicon nanocrystals from SiCl4. In addition, as reported earlier, the synthesis of NPs using SiCl4 as the precursor required an additional flow of hydrogen to scavenge the chlorine from the precursor and led to mixed termination of the NPs with hydrogen and chlorine which increased susceptibility to oxidation. Nonetheless, they reported the successful synthesis of the silicon NPs with a maximum size of 10 nm at production rates of up to 140 mg h−1 using SiCl4 as the precursor.347 They modified their system by adding a bubbler to deliver a second precursor and produced silicon-germanium alloy with controllable alloy composition, intended for use in thermoelectric applications. For this purpose, they used silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) and germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) as the precursors instead of silane (which is pyrophoric) and germane (which is extremely toxic) for the sake of both safety and cost. They employed an RF power supply with a frequency of 13.56 MHz which provided 175 W power to the reaction chamber at a pressure of 3.5 Torr. They synthesized alloy NPs with average sizes in the range of 5 to 10 nm and alloy compositions of Si1−xGex (0 < x < 0.3).386
Rowe and Kortshagen synthesized undoped silicon-germanium alloy and boron- and phosphorus- doped silicon-germanium alloy using the same non-thermal plasma processing approach. For undoped SiGe alloy, they simultaneously decomposed silane (SiH4) and germane (GeH4) in an Ar plasma with a nominal power of 130 W. They added diborane (B2H6) and phosphine (PH3) to obtain B- and P- doped SiGe alloy, respectively. Both n-type and p-type doped materials are needed for a complete thermoelectric device. They reported that the crystalline silicon-germanium NPs were truly alloyed with compositions of Si1−xGex (0.16 < x < 0.24). In addition, they found that the concentrations of each dopant in the gaseous precursor mixture could be used to estimate the incorporation efficiency of each dopant for a range of alloy compositions.357
Ding et al. investigated the effects of specific energy input (SEI, defined as plasma power divided by total gas flow) and the H2 to SiCl4 ratio on the size distribution, crystallinity, and yield of silicon NPs synthesized using a frequency of 70 MHz and total reactor pressure of 400 Pa. They found that atomic hydrogen generation has a significant effect on the dechlorination of SiCl4 at low temperatures. Increasing SEI increased product yield due to greater decomposition of SiCl4 with more energy per unit volume deposited into the gaseous mixture. An optimum SEI of 10 J cm−3 and H2 to SiCl4 ratio of 10 produced a maximum yield of 50 wt%. Further increasing SEI beyond the optimum value dropped the yield to 10%. The crystallinity and size distribution are mostly affected by the input power and residence time. At the optimum values of SEI and H2 to SiCl4 ratio for yield, the crystal fraction was approximately 1% and the size distribution was broad. At SEI greater than the optimum value for the yield, the crystallinity and monodispersity improved.348
In a promising application of aerosol-synthesized semiconductor nanocrystals, Meinardi et al. produced silicon quantum dots using non-thermal plasma processing and applied them in luminescent solar concentrators, where the low cost, efficient photoluminescence, earth abundance, and large Stokes shift of silicon are advantageous. They flowed a mixture of argon and helium-diluted silane through a tube reactor and injected hydrogen downstream of the plasma. They applied a power of 45 W at 13.56 MHz. They generated high-optical-quality waveguides by incorporating the silicon quantum dots into a mass polymerized matrix. Large effective spectral separation between the luminescence and optical absorption of the silicon quantum dots eliminated optical losses due to reabsorption of the guided luminescence. These allowed fabrication of luminescent solar concentrators with almost ideal optical performance and an efficiency of 2.85%, comparable to that of state-of-the-art semi-transparent luminescent solar concentrators.349
Coleman et al. synthesized hollow β-SiC using a two-step non-thermal plasma processing approach. Their plasma reactor (Fig. 43a) consisted of two stages, each with a non-thermal plasma generated by a 13.56 MHz power supply. The first stage employed a quartz tube with an outer diameter of 2.54 cm at a pressure of about 800 Pa, through which 100 sccm of a mixture of 1.37% silane in argon flowed. A copper ring served as the powered electrode placed 7 cm from the downstream grounded metal flange to which the non-thermal plasma was coupled. The second stage comprised another quartz tube with an outer diameter of 2.54 cm at a pressure of about 130 Pa in which a coil electrode produced the second non-thermal plasma with a length of around 25 cm. The two stages were separated by a metal flange and an orifice with a diameter of 1 mm at its center. Immediately downstream of this orifice, methane as the carbon source at a flow rate of 5 sccm was introduced into the reactor. The second non-thermal plasma was optically found to be coupled to the metal separating the two stages. Accordingly, the nucleated silicon NPs in the first stage were accelerated through the separating orifice and the carbonization occurred immediately upon introduction into the second reactor. The collection filter was a metal mesh located downstream of the plasma volume. The power in the first stage was fixed at 100 W and in the second stage was varied from 8 to 40 W. At a power of 12 W, diamond crystalline silicon was produced. The particles (Fig. 43b) were spherical with a broad size distribution from 10 to 30 nm because of the long residence time of 250 ms in the first stage, as determined by the length of the plasma and the flow velocity. At a power of 20 W, the synthesized nanocrystalline particles were a mixture of silicon and β-SiC. The majority of the particles were hollow, although some spherical particles could be observed (Fig. 43c). At a power of 30 W, more silicon particles were converted to silicon carbide. Because of the of the reduction in specific surface area and subsequent breakdown in the hollow spherical structure, the hollow particles formed were less regular and there were no spherical particles (Fig. 43d). At a power of 40 W, there was a complete conversion of silicon particles to silicon carbide. The hollow spherical particles collapsed and smaller particles with a size near 15 nm (smaller than the original silicon NPs) with irregular shapes formed (Fig. 43e). Overall, control of morphology from hollow to solid was possible by adjusting the process parameters. The spherical geometry of the initial silicon particles along with the expansion of the silicon lattice during carbonization produced hollow structures. In addition, they conducted a theoretical analysis of the diffusion kinetics and found that the fast transport of the carbon into the silicon particle and the subsequent conversion to the β-SiC phase was enabled by significant NP heating via interaction with the ionized gas.354

Hunter et al. synthesized Ge/Si nanocomposites with a core/shell structure in a two-part vertical reactor (Fig. 44a). Ring electrodes, generating a non-thermal plasma at 13.56 MHz and 50 W, were connected to the first part. To produce Ge quantum dot cores, Ar (25 sccm), H2 (20 sccm), and GeCl4 (partial pressure of 50 mTorr at total pressure of 2 Torr) were injected through the top of a quartz reaction tube. Up to 5% silane in argon was injected through a stainless-steel vacuum fitting with 16 individual 1 mm diameter holes spaced evenly around the second part of the reactor to form the coating. Shell growth took place around non-agglomerated particles due to the in-flight negative charging of the nanocrystals. Fig. 44b shows HAADF-STEM images and elemental mapping of a single Ge/Si nanocomposite with a core/shell structure. They could control the thickness of the coating by adjusting the flow of the Ar/SiH4 mixture in the range of 0 to 10 sccm while another flow of Ar was added to maintain a total pressure of 2 Torr, varying SiH4 concentration from 0 to 5%. This epitaxial growth of a Si shell of tuneable thickness around the Ge quantum dots was advantageous to control the germanium band structure.374

Barragan et al. employed non-thermal plasma processing to produce crystalline TiN NPs with an average size below 10 nm. They used titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and ammonia (NH3) as precursors, with a 180 W RF power supply at 13.56 MHz. They controlled product composition by adjusting the precursor concentrations to tune the particle optical properties. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) optical absorbance peak was tuned from 800 to 1000 nm. They found that NPs with lower nitrogen content were more readily oxidized because of their higher vacancy concentrations, although even NPs with the stoichiometric composition were prone to oxidation upon annealing in air at temperatures as low as 150 °C. Oxidation led to a red-shift in LSPR peak position.360 Kortshagen's group also employed non-thermal plasma processing to synthesize TiN NPs as promising candidates for photothermal therapy. They used a mixture of tetrakis (dimethylamino) titanium ([(CH3)2N]4Ti) and ammonia as precursors to produce NPs 6 to 8 nm in diameter. They investigated the effects of plasma power and ammonia flow rate on the LSPR and identified an optimal plasma power of 100 W and ammonia flow rate of 1.2 sccm that yielded a narrower LSPR absorbance peak than had been obtained in previous research.361
Kortshagen's group modified the system they first developed for silicon339 to produce metal sulfide NPs as the first non-oxide compounds produced by this approach. A schematic of their set-up is presented in Fig. 45. First, they added bubblers to deliver a sulfur source and volatile precursors containing Zn, Sn, or Cu. Although gaseous H2S is an attractive sulfur source, its toxicity severely limits its use; nontoxic precursors are preferable in this case. Hence, they used elemental sulfur, a solid with a melting point of 115 °C and substantial vapor pressure that allowed it to be delivered as a vapor from a vessel held at 120–140 °C. In contrast to the conventional bubbling method in which a carrier gas bubbles through the liquid, they flowed Ar over the liquid sulfur surface to avoid clogging of the gas feed lines. The precursors for ZnS, SnS, and Cu2S were diethyl-zinc(II) ((C2H5)2Zn), tetrakis(dimethylamido)-tin(IV) ([(C2H5)2N]4Sn), and hexafluoro-acetylacetonate-copper(I) (CuC5H6F6O2), respectively, each delivered by bubbling argon through a separate bubbler. The second modification was addition of optical access to the plasma emission for in situ optical emission spectroscopy, which required moving collection and pumping systems off the axis of the plasma tube. They found that increasing the flow rate of Ar to the plasma, at a constant precursor feed rate reduced the size of NPs due to the shorter residence time and lower precursor partial pressure. In addition, the sulfur delivery to the plasma, beyond a small minimum amount, did not affect the elemental compositions of the crystalline NPs at a constant vapor feed rate, while this was affected by the feed rate of the metal precursor at constant sulfur feed rate. The overall metal atomic fraction increased with increasing metal precursor vapor feed rate with formation of metal-rich crystal phases. Accordingly, the crystal phase and the elemental composition of the metal-sulfides could be controlled by adjusting the precursor vapor feed rate. They reported production rates in the range of 100 to 300 mg h−1 with their set-up and suggested it could be scaled-up for bulk synthesis through parallelization or using reaction tubes with larger diameters.365

Uner and Thimsen developed a reactor and process based on a non-thermal plasma, which they termed“non-equilibrium plasma aerotaxy (NPA)”, to synthesize pure, crystalline, free-standing, and monodispersed gallium nitride NPs with a tunable size from 5 to 45 nm. Their experimental set-up is presented in Fig. 46. The growth of NPs by a surface-growth mechanism in NPA enabled the synthesis of NPs with high monodispersity, despite some aggregation. Their system comprised three units: the aerosol unit, the plasma unit, and the collection unit. In the aerosol unit, gallium was placed on a filament that was heated resistively by a DC power supply to generate gallium vapor that was carried by an argon flow to the plasma unit. Before introduction to the plasma unit, rapid quenching led to nucleation of gallium aerosol droplets. The gallium particles reacted with nitrogen in the plasma unit to produce gallium nitride. The plasma unit was a flow-through tubular reactor in which a 13.56 MHz, 80 W RF power supply with a matching network generated the plasma. Finally, product particles were collected on a removeable collection filter or deposited on a TEM grid. The residence time could be adjusted from 10 to 100 ms, which affected average particle size and geometric standard deviation. They produced both hollow and photoluminescent solid NPs with emission in the range of 300 to 400 nm. Although large NPs exhibited emission near the bulk band-gap transition wavelength, NPs below 7 nm diameter produced blue-shifted photoluminescence characteristic of quantum confinement.370

2.2.2.2. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Moreno-Couranjou et al. synthesized carbon nanomaterials with various typologies through non-thermal plasma processing based on low current-high voltage discharges at atmospheric pressure. This plasma configuration (Fig. 47a) is quite different from those discussed above. Their set-up included two electrodes, an annular electrode and a high-voltage electrode, between which an electric arc discharge was produced and carried downstream by a gas flow introduced tangentially. This gas was pure Ar or 8% CO2 in Ar. The small annular electrode diameter of 6 mm along with the swirling injection to produce a vortex flow supported an electric arc to the wall. The set-up included a post-discharge zone made of an insulated stainless-steel enclosure or a Pyrex tube for visualization of the plasma. They employed two alternative power sources to produce the low current-high voltage discharges: (a) a high-voltage transformer and an impedance connected in series that allowed working in AC or DC configurations with a maximum power of 4 kW, controlled by adjusting the impedance when the power source was stopped. (b) A source with electronic components to operate as a current source (0 to 1 A) which supplied a maximum breakdown voltage of 5 kV. Acetylene (C2H2) or ethylene (C2H4) was employed as the carbon source which was introduced radially from the side of the annular electrode. They produced two main families of carbon products with different typologies: (a) concentric texture carbon NPs similar to acetylene-type carbon black (Fig. 47b), furnace-type carbon black (Fig. 47c), and filled carbon shells with metal NPs (Fig. 47d). (b) Isotropic texture carbon NPs like crumpled paper sheets with a microporous texture (Fig. 47e and f). They investigated the effects of the power, the type of plasma gas, the position of hydrocarbon injection, and the type of precursor on the synthesis process and found that the growth mechanism and nanomaterial type were governed by temperature. High temperatures led to textures of the NPs such as acetylene-type carbon black or crumpled paper sheets with a lateral-type growth mechanism, while low temperatures favoured a contribution of liquid hydrocarbon droplets in the structure of the NPs to yield furnace-type carbon black through a radial-type growth mechanism.341

Woodard et al. worked on the graphitization of carbon particles by non-thermal plasma processing, employing an in situ in-flight Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy method to study the temperature variation of carbon NPs during the process. Their set-up (Fig. 48a) included intersecting horizontal and a vertical 1 inch outer diameter tubes. A mixture of Ar, H2, and C2H2 entered the reactor through the horizontal tube at 65, 1.5, and 2 sccm, respectively. An RF power supply provided 20–100 W at 13.56 MHz to dual copper ring electrodes. The vertical tube was used for in situ FTIR of the gaseous flow containing nucleated carbon clusters and precursor molecules. Based on the FTIR results, they found that increasing the plasma power led to production of carbon NPs with a low degree of hydrogenation and progressive particle incandescence. Carbon particle temperatures exceeded 2000 K at high plasma power. Moreover, they showed that low plasma power (20 W) produced fully amorphous spherical carbon NPs (Fig. 48b), while high plasma powers (100 W) generated highly-crystalline carbon NPs with well-defined collapsed graphene-like layers (Fig. 48c). Indeed, the amorphous carbon NPs transformed to highly-graphitic carbonaceous nanomaterials as the plasma power increased. In both cases, the carbon NPs exhibit a narrow particle size distribution. Surprisingly, they observed the size of carbon NPs decreased with increasing power so that the average size was around 12 nm for a power of 20 W, decreasing to around 6 nm at a power of 100 W. They suggested that faster nucleation rates at higher power resulted in smaller NPs.342

2.2.2.3. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Woodard et al. synthesized nickel NPs from nickelocene (Ni(C5H5)2) by non-thermal plasma processing. They investigated the effects of adding hydrogen to the argon plasma gas and the plasma power on the process. A 13.56 MHz RF power supply drove the plasma. The resulting nickel NPs contained carbon, at a concentration that depended on plasma power and hydrogen addition. Without hydrogen, the carbon contents were about 40 and 85% for plasma powers of 20 and 100 W, respectively, while using 30% hydrogen in the plasma gas reduced the carbon content to below 20 and 60% for the same plasma powers. In addition, they found that increasing the power and adding hydrogen to the plasma gas decreased the yield, total mass conversion efficiency, and nickel conversion efficiency. Moreover, they observed core–shell structures for the carbon-containing nickel NPs (Fig. 41c) which could be advantageous for use as non-precious metal catalysts.363
2.2.2.4. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Kortshagen and Bhandarkar developed a model to investigate NP growth by coagulation in low pressure plasmas. Their model self-consistently described the plasma properties and particle charging, and simulated the evolution of the NP size distribution by solution of the aerosol general dynamic equation. They found that the attraction of oppositely charged NPs enhanced coagulation in non-thermal plasma processing compared to coagulation in neutral aerosols, although the temporal coagulation behavior followed the same power law time dependence in both cases, provided the NP concentration exceeds that of the positive ions in the plasma. Accordingly, they suggested that the density of positive ions is the critical factor for the onset of coagulation. Moreover, they observed that the mechanism of particle charging plays an important role in determining plasma properties, while it is a negligible factor in describing the coagulation dynamics.387
Bhandarkar et al. investigated particle nucleation in a low-temperature silane plasma by developing a silicon hydride clustering model containing neutral species such as silanes, silenes, silylenes, and silyl radicals along with anions of silylene and silyl. They used the available data for the reactions of small molecules to estimate the reaction rates and define the reactions. They performed simulations for typical discharge parameters in a capacitive plasma. They found that the anion-neutral reactions played the main role in the clustering of silicon hydrides. Dehydrogenation and ring formation mainly occurred through electron-induced dissociation, while SiH2 radical insertion was a determining factor only in the initial clustering stages, in structures with at most three or four silicon atoms. In addition, they observed that increasing the ion density resulted in faster clustering and more dehydrogenated clusters because of an increase in reactive radical generation.388 They also simulated the nucleation and growth of NPs in argon–silane plasmas by developing a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the particle nucleation delay associated with increased gas temperature. They found that the temperature dependence of the Brownian diffusion coefficient played the main role in delaying nucleation, due to an increase in diffusion loss rate and a decrease in particle growth rate. In addition, they proposed that other factors that can affect the diffusion coefficient, like employing a lighter gas such as hydrogen or helium instead of argon, which increases the diffusion coefficient, or increasing the pressure to decrease the importance of diffusion, could affect the nucleation delay.389
In non-thermal plasma processing, the aerosol particles are distributed among both particle sizes and charge states. However, the majority of dusty (particle-containing) plasma modelling studies treat the particles as monodisperse and all characterized by the same average charge. Agarwal and Girshick developed a sectional model to investigate, in an effective way, the main qualitative features of the time-dependent evolution of both particle size and charge distributions in non-thermal plasma processing such as co-emergence of tiny neutral NPs and larger negatively charged NPs, size and charge distribution effects on coagulation, expansion and structure of the particle cloud, and the nanodusty plasma afterglow dynamics. This work produced multiple new insights into the spatial and temporal variation of NP size, concentration, and charge within a non-thermal plasma.390
Agarwal and Girshick also presented a simulation study of the RF-coupled parallel-plate non-thermal plasma generation of silicon NPs based upon a one-dimensional numerical model with self-consistently-coupled models of the plasma, the chemistry, and the aerosol dynamics. Inclusion of chemistry of nucleation and surface growth was a major addition relative to their earlier study. The plasma and precursor gases were a mixture of argon and silane at a ratio of 30 to 1, and two RF voltages of 100 and 250 V were considered. The higher voltage of 250 V produced a plasma discharge with two spatially separated lobes containing mainly negatively-charged large NPs. These were separated by a region of lower particle mass and surface area concentration, in which nucleation occurred. Based upon the simulation results, they found that the nucleation in the region between the lobes resulted from several coupled phenomena such as NP transport, the potential profile of plasma, and the trapping of silicon hydride anions as a driving force for nucleation in the system.391
Le Picard and Girshick developed a model to investigate the effects of single-particle charge limits (size- and material-dependent maximum charge that a particle can accommodate) on the stationary NP charge distributions in non-thermal plasma processing. Their analytical model of stationary charge distribution was in good agreement with Monte Carlo charging simulations. They studied the influence of charge limits on the various values of electron-to-ion density ratio and the effect of ion mass on the charge distribution transient behavior, considering charging limits. They reported that a decrease in the charge limit led to a severe decrease in the required time to achieve a steady-state charge distribution. Moreover, they found that high-frequency charge fluctuations were relatively more important factors when the charge limits were accounted for, relative to simulations without charge limits.392
Although there is an overall tendency for the NPs to be charged negatively in non-thermal plasma processing, a minor fraction of the NPs can be neutral and therefore not subject to any electrostatic confinement in the plasma, or can even be positively charged, and thus electrostatically attracted to surfaces bounding the plasma. Mamunuru et al. performed Monte Carlo simulations to study the effects of various parameters on the non-negatively charged NP fraction of the stationary particle charge distribution in non-thermal plasma processing. They considered two deviations from the orbital motion limited theory of particle charging: electron tunneling that results single-particle charge limits, and increasing ion current to NPs because of charge-exchange collisions inside the NP's capture radius. They found that decreasing the size of the NPs, the electron temperature, or the positive ion temperature, and increasing the pressure or the electronegativity of the particle material were all factors that could increase the non-negatively charged NP fractions. Moreover, they reported that silica, with a low electron affinity of 1.0 eV, exhibited much higher non-negatively charged particle fractions compared to silicon, with a higher electron affinity of 4.05 eV. Notably, they assumed collision attachment of electrons and ions as the main mechanism for the NP charging in non-thermal plasma, while recognizing that additional electron-emissive effects, e.g. photodetachment or secondary electron emission, could further increase the non-negatively charged NP fractions.393
In a very recent review and analysis, Girshick surveyed the effects of the interaction between the negatively-charged and neutral ions on the particle formation process in non-thermal plasma processing. He found that the reaction between the negatively-charged ions trapped electrostatically in the non-thermal plasma and neutral molecules or radicals governed nucleation, while the reactions of the neutral molecules on the surface of negatively-charged NPs were responsible for particle surface growth, and coagulation was dominated by collisions between tiny neutral NPs with negatively-charged NPs. Thus, all three processes are dominated by interaction of a neutral species with a negatively charged one. He noted that induction of an electric dipole or image potential in a neutral molecule or NP by an anion or a negatively-charged NP enhances collision rates that are important for nucleation, particle surface growth, and coagulation.394
Woodard et al. characterized their non-thermal plasmas using a Langmuir probe that could accurately extract plasma parameters and electron energy distribution function (EEDF) in the presence of NPs, i.e., in a dusty plasma. While the Langmuir probe method is well-developed, its application in dusty plasmas is notoriously difficult. To overcome this challenge, they employed a two-plasma system. They first produced graphitic carbon NPs in an Ar–H2 low-pressure plasma. After complete conversion of acetylene (C2H2) to NPs in the first reactor, they introduced the dust into a second reactor in which they performed Langmuir probe measurements. By doing so, they were able to investigate the effects of various operating parameters on the non-thermal dusty plasma properties in the absence of any nucleation or growth of the NPs, which were not occurring in the second plasma reactor where the measurement was performed. They showed that the presence of the NPs did not interfere with their measurements. Notably, they found that increasing input power did not monotonically increase the charge carried by the NPs. In fact, it unexpectedly decreased at sufficiently high input power levels.395 This group employed the same technique to investigate the effects of electron emission from the NPs on the electron energy distribution in non-thermal dusty plasmas. They observed an unexpected broad peak in the EEDF at energies ranging from 2 to 4 V. Based on results of a self-consistent model that was in a good qualitative agreement with the Langmuir probe measurements, they inferred that distributed electron emission from the NPs resulted in the unexpected peak corresponding to the NP floating potential. Based on a NP energy balance analysis employing the measured NP concentration and plasma density, they inferred that hot NPs, which could not cool due to slow heat transfer at low pressure and insufficient radiative losses from tiny NPs, emitted electrons into the non-thermal dusty plasma by field-assisted thermionic emission. This electron emission influenced both the electron energy distribution and charge balance of the NPs in the plasma. They concluded that the plasma ionization balance can be strongly affected by the existence of dust in the non-thermal plasma, to a greater extent than previously expected.396

2.3. Chemically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods
Chemically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods are aerosol synthesis methods in which the precursors are chemically different from the product nanomaterials. In general, compared to the physically-based vapor-phase synthesis methods, the main advantage of these methods is the synthesis of nanomaterials in larger quantities per batch or per unit time and the major disadvantage is greater complexity and associated challenges in the synthesis of high-purity nanomaterials because of the nature of the processes (the precursors and the final products are not chemically similar). The most important methods in this category are chemical vapor condensation, flame-based aerosol synthesis (including vapor-fed aerosol flame synthesis (VAFS) and liquid-fed aerosol flame synthesis (LAFS)), spray pyrolysis, and laser pyrolysis.

2.3.1. Chemical vapor condensation. 
In chemical vapor condensation (CVC, also called chemical vapor synthesis (CVS) or hot-wall synthesis), vapor-phase precursors are introduced into a hot-wall reactor27,29,30 and heat transfer from the reactor walls supplies the energy required to initiate precursor decomposition. Rapid heating, high temperature, and resulting high supersaturation are factors that favor production of NPs in the CVC method over growth of films on the reactor walls by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).397
Because of its great importance for production not only of dense thin films, but also diverse two-dimensional and tailored nanomaterials, numerous valuable studies of CVD processes and materials produced by them have been published. For example, Beckermann et al. studied the production of multi-component oxide nanosystems through CVD,21 Tobacchi et al. investigated the effect of various precursors on the CVD of transition metal oxide nanostructures,398 and also presented a modelling study of the CVD process,399 Devi investigated precursor chemistry effects on the CVD of nanomaterials for microelectronics and optoelectronics,400 Kurek et al. reviewed the use of guanidinate ligands for developing CVD precursors,401 Qin et al. reviewed the role of substrates in the production of two-dimensional materials via CVD,402 and Cai et al. reviewed the applications and the heterostructures of two-dimensional nanomaterials produced through CVD in addition to their growth.403 That being said, reviewing the use of CVD processes to produce nanomaterials through deposition on substrates is beyond the scope of this review, where we focus only on the related CVC of nanomaterials in the gas phase.
As noted above, CVC is essentially the same as hot-wall CVD, but operated under conditions of relatively high temperature and pressure for which particle formation is favored compared to film deposition on the reactor walls. Thus, the large knowledge base related to precursor chemistries developed for CVD is available and of great value in guiding the synthesis of materials such as nitrides, carbides, and complex oxides by CVC. Simplicity, demonstrated scale-up to approximately 100 ton per day for some nanomaterials like titania, and relatively well-understood mechanisms are other advantages of the method.175 Control of powder characteristics to meet the needs of a specific application is an important feature of the CVC process.404 This method is suitable to synthesize non-oxide nanomaterials, because the synthesis atmosphere can be controlled to exclude oxygen. Not only can single-phase nanomaterials be formed from a single precursor, but doped nanomaterials can also be synthesized using multiple precursors.27,30 Although a wide variety of precursors can be used in this method, metal chlorides are the most common in large-scale industrial application due to considerations of cost, purity, and vapor pressure.175 In laboratory research, precursors that do not produce corrosive chlorine-containing byproducts are often preferred, as shown by the survey of materials below. As another key advantage, the method benefits from straightforward control of temperature and residence time, which is helpful in synthesizing nanomaterials of controlled shapes and sizes.405 As a disadvantage, the heating and cooling rates are limited by heat transfer from the walls of the reactor, which limits production rates of very small NPs that are free of hard aggregates.248 The need for relatively expensive precursors with significant vapor pressure and stability below the reaction temperature, the formation of hard agglomerates due to relatively long residence times and slow heating and cooling rates, and high energy requirements are key limitations of the method.175Table 7 provides a summary and Fig. 49 presents representative TEM images of some materials synthesized using this technique.

2.3.1.1. Ceramics. 
Chang, Skandan, Danforth, Kear, and Hahn pioneered the CVC method for synthesis of nanostructured SiCxNy and ZrOxCy. They started from an inert gas condensation set-up and modified it to use metalorganic precursors. They substituted the energy source in the IGC method with a molybdenum-wound tube furnace with a high-purity alumina tube to decompose the precursors and generate a continuous flow of nanomaterials in a carrier gas. The set-up (Fig. 50) consisted of two main parts connected by a needle valve: a reaction chamber at a pressure of 1 to 50 mbar and a precursor delivery system at atmospheric pressure. The needle valve controlled the flow rate of the precursor at 8.55 mmol min−1 in He carrier gas. Upon entering the tube furnace, the precursor decomposed and particles nucleated. The rapid expansion of the aerosol quenched the particle growth and sintering process. Finally, the particles were deposited on a rotating liquid nitrogen-cooled substrate for collection. They found three important factors for successful synthesis of nanomaterials using the method: (a) a low precursor concentration in the carrier gas to minimize the collision frequency between freshly nucleated NPs, (b) rapid expansion of the NP aerosol into an inert gas, and (c) rapid cooling at the outlet of the reactor. For the synthesis of loosely-agglomerated SiCxNy nanomaterials with an average primary particle size of 2 to 10 nm, they used hexamethyl-disilazane((CH3)3SiNHSi(CH3)3) as the precursor and controlled the temperature of the tube furnace in the range of 1100 to 1400 °C. Thereafter, they conducted heat treatment on amorphous SiCxNy in Ar to produce cubic β-SiC nanocrystals with a spherical morphology. Crystallization began at 1200 to 1300 °C and completed at 1400 °C. They employed heating in H2 to produce cubic β-SiC nanocrystals with a whisker-like morphology (Fig. 49a) which formed at 1400 °C, and heating in NH3/H2 (1:1 mixture) to obtain hexagonal α-Si3N4 nanocrystals with a whisker-like morphology. To generate amorphous ZrOxCy nanomaterials with an average size below 10 nm, they used zirconium tert-butoxide (Zr[OC(CH3)3]4) as the precursor with the furnace at 500 to 700 °C. They found that the amount of polymeric species in the product decreased with increasing temperature of the tube furnace. They suggested that trapping of volatile species in the particles caused the product to be amorphous. They sintered the nanomaterials in air to yield tetragonal and monoclinic nanostructured ZrO2. Crystallization began at around 400 °C and completed at 1225 °C.406 Kear and Strutt follow the same strategy to produce SiO2, SiC, and Si3N4 nanomaterials using different carrier gases, but the same silicon precursor (hexamethyl-disilazane). They used H2O, H2, and NH3 to produce SiO2, SiC, and Si3N4, respectively.407

Klein et al. investigated the effect of different operating parameters such as precursor compound, decomposition temperature, total pressure, precursor partial pressure, and reactor length (residence time) on the synthesis of SiC NPs by CVD with a maximum production rate of 20 g h−1. They found that using tetramethylsilane (Si(CH3)4) as the precursor, a decomposition temperature above 1400 K, total pressure of 1 kPa, precursor partial pressure of less than 600 Pa, and hot zone length less than 0.2 m yielded highly-crystalline β-SiC nanomaterials with small grain and particle sizes and a low degree of agglomeration. Notably, they used mass flow controllers instead of needle valves to control the delivery of the precursor and a silicon infiltrated SiC tube instead of alumina tube in the tube furnace when using tetramethylsilane as the precursor.408
Srdic et al. synthesized monodispersed non-agglomerated highly-crystalline ZrO2 with a crystallite size of approximately 5 nm by CVC. They thermally decomposed zirconium tert-butoxide as the zirconium precursor in a tube furnace at 1000 °C, combining flows of 100 sccm He as the carrier gas and 1000 sccm O2 to complete the oxidation. In addition, they studied the sintering behavior of the product nanomaterials and found that the evolution of pore sizes differed for sintering in air vs. a vacuum atmosphere. Vacuum sintering required lower sintering and densification temperatures.449
Gebauer et al. employed CVC for production of various monodispersed highly-crystalline metal oxides such as ZnO, CuO, SnO2, TiO2, and In2O3 NPs by thermal decomposition of diethylzinc, copper(II) acetylacetonate (C10H14CuO4), tetramethyltin (Sn(CH3)4), titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide, and indium(III) acetylacetonate (C15H21InO6) at 800 °C in He. Oxygen was also introduced to the tube furnace to ensure complete oxidation. Finally, they collected the products in a thermophoretic collector which is advantageous for separation of particles from gases with minimal pressure drop. The morphologies of the synthesized NPs are presented in Fig. 51. They used inkjet printing to deposit these oxides after dispersion in ethylene glycol.397

Polarz et al. used a CVC process to synthesize zinc oxide nanocrystals with a high level of purity that improved their semiconducting properties. They decomposed the single-source precursor methylzinc iso-propoxide ([CH3ZnOCH(CH3)2]4) at 300 to 900 °C. The precursor was evaporated in another tube furnace at 40 to 100 °C and carried to the reaction zone by 1.5 lpm nitrogen. To achieve complete oxidation, a mixture of 1.2 lpm nitrogen and 0.3 lpm oxygen was added to the flow containing the precursor. Accordingly, they produced pure zinc oxide NPs with adjustable primary particle size from about 6 to 30 nm. Furthermore, they studied the gas-phase synthesis mechanism in detail, and contrasted it with the solid-state chemistry of this precursor. They found that if they did not introduce oxygen to the reaction chamber, then elemental zinc was produced by elimination of organic compounds from the precursor. This paper included a combined experimental and modelling study of the aerosol sintering process that governs the final product morphology. Also, they concluded that the synthesis of defect-free zinc oxide using CVC is possible based on photoluminescence spectroscopy.442
Kim and Kim synthesized loosely agglomerated tungsten carbide by CVC. They vaporized hexacarbonyl tungsten (W(CO6)) at 120 °C and delivered it to the reaction chamber using carbon monoxide carrier gas at 1200 sccm. They decomposed the precursor at 500 to 1000 °C to investigate the effect of the temperature on the particle size and found that the NP size decreased with increasing decomposition temperature. Moreover, they reported coexistence of pure W and WC1−x at a decomposition temperature of 1000 °C via initial formation of W followed by partial carbonization.457
2.3.1.2. Doped ceramic oxides. 
Konrad et al. employed CVC for synthesis of single-phase cubic Y2O3:Eu nanocrystals with a mean particle size as low as 10 nm. This was the first production of single-phase cubic nanocrystals of this material of such small size. To do so, they used tetramethyl-heptanedionato-yttrium (Y(C11H19O2)3) as yttrium precursor which played the role of host lattice and tetramethyl-heptanedionato-europium (Eu(C11H19O2)3) as the precursor for europium which was the optically-active dopant. The precursors were delivered from two separate bubblers in two separate oil baths held at 437 and 428 K for yttrium and europium precursors, respectively. They used Ar as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 200 sccm for each of the two precursor lines. The tubes between the bubblers and the reaction chamber were heated to prevent precursor condensation. Pure oxygen at 800 sccm entered the reaction chamber through a separate line. The temperature of the reaction zone was 1273 K. They used a water-cooled cylinder to collect the product NPs. They reported blue shifting of the absorption bands for the synthesized nanomaterials compared to coarse grained material.440
Srdic et al. followed the same strategy to produce ZrO2 doped with 3, 5, 15, and 30 mol% Al2O3 by decomposing zirconium-tert-butoxide as the host precursor and aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (C12H27AlO3) as the dopant precursor. Additionally, they performed a sintering study on the synthesized nanomaterials and found that the addition of alumina limited the grain growth of zirconia. For the first time, they reported the complete densification of ZrO2:Al2O3 nanomaterials with average grain sizes in the range of 40–45 nm and full transparency using pressureless vacuum sintering for 1 hour at temperatures as low as 1000 °C.451
Brehm et al. used CVC for synthesis of zinc oxide NPs doped with aluminum, gallium, and indium by thermal decomposition of tetramethyl-heptanedionate precursors at 1000 °C in He. They found that indium atoms reside substantially on zinc lattice sites while aluminum and gallium atoms reside on interstitial sites.444 Hartner et al. investigated the electrical properties of Al-doped-ZnO NPs synthesized by CVC from diethylzinc ((C2H5)2Zn) and trimethylaluminum (Al2(CH3)6) at 1000 °C in He. They reported that CVC enables incorporation of dopant atoms at concentrations much greater than the thermodynamic solubility limit. They investigated the electrical properties by impedance spectroscopy under hydrogen and synthetic air at 323–673 K and found that the conductivity under hydrogen is greater than under air, although both cases exhibit dependence of transport properties on temperature and doping level. Under hydrogen, they found that an increase in doping level produced a decrease in conductivity due to enhanced scattering associated with increasing disorder. They also found that increasing dopant concentration produced a change from positive temperature coefficient behavior to negative temperature coefficient. Under synthetic air, they concluded that an increase in the dopant level first increased conductivity by six orders of magnitude due to the production of free charge carriers with dopant incorporation, reaching a maximum conductivity at an Al concentration of 7.7% then decreased at higher concentrations.445
2.3.1.3. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Choi et al. decomposed iron carbonyl (Fe(CO)5) and cobalt carbonyl (Co2(CO)8) as iron and cobalt precursors, respectively, to generate Fe and Co NPs with average sizes from 5 to 13 nm and metal–metal oxide core–shell morphology. They used temperatures of 400 to 1100 °C and found that the NP size increased with increasing temperature.404 In another study, they investigated the effects of operating parameters of the CVC method on the metal–metal oxide core–shell nanomaterials. The average diameter of the NPs was from 6 to 25 nm. Increasing the decomposition temperature produced nanomaterials of larger size, broader size distribution, and less spherical morphology. Using Ar as the carrier gas instead of He also produced larger particles. In addition, they suggested that an observed increase in the lattice parameter of the core with decreasing particle size resulted from interaction between cores and shells.436 They also synthesized ferromagnetic carbon-coated iron and cobalt nanocapsules with a metallic core and amorphous shell via CVC using the same precursors, but with carbon monoxide (CO) as the carrier gas. Independent of the decomposition temperature and the carrier gas flow rate, the phases of carbon-coated Co nanocapsules included a combination of Co in both fcc and hcp crystalline structures and cobalt carbides. In contrast, those factors influenced the phases of carbon-coated Fe nanocapsules. Thermal decomposition at 500 to 1000 °C resulted in α-Fe and Fe3C as the majority phases, with the exception of 700 °C for which the only phase was Fe3C. Decomposition at 1100 °C led to α-Fe, γ-Fe, and Fe3C. They also investigated the magnetic properties of the synthesized nanomaterials and found that the saturation magnetization of the carbon-coated Co increased with increasing decomposition temperature and reached 90% of the value for bulk cobalt. For carbon-coated iron nanocapsules, the saturation magnetization was 75 and 33% of the value for bulk iron at decomposition temperatures of 400 and 1100 °C.413 Hong et al. produced Fe nanofluids by thermal decomposition of iron carbonyl in He, followed by sonication of the Fe NPs in glycerol. They reported that the thermal conductivity of Fe nanofluids increased after sonication.438
Guo et al. employed what they called viscous boundary layer chemical vapor synthesis, to generate MWCNTs filled with ferromagnetic nanomaterials such as iron carbide and iron cobalt nanocrystals. In this method, a laminar flow of pyrolyzed metallocene/argon vapor in a quartz tube led to the formation of a viscous boundary layer between the flow and the rough surface. Nucleation and subsequent growth of MWCNTs filled with ferromagnetic nanomaterials occurred within this growing boundary layer. For this, they evaporated 180 mg of ferrocene (C10H10Fe) or a mixture of 40 mg ferrocene and 40 mg cobaltocene (C10H10Co) at 450 °C to produce MWCNTs filled with Fe3C or FeCo, respectively. They used 11 sccm argon as the carrier gas and the synthesis temperature was kept at 990 °C in a quartz tube furnace with a length of 1.5 m and outer diameter of 22 mm. The process duration was 10 to 20 minutes. The product was radial nanotubes (multiple nanotubes growing outward from a central catalyst particle) that were filled with Fe3C or FeCo and exhibited saturation magnetizations of 30 and 80 emu g−1, respectively. The authors observed a surprisingly high coercivity of 1400 Oe at room temperature for both cases. They proposed that the small size of the ferromagnetic nanomaterials filling the nanotubes played the main role in achieving the high value of coercivity. At constant pyrolysis temperature and vapor flow rate, the high evaporation temperature of the precursors was the most important factor governing the synthesis of these small ferromagnetic nanomaterials with high coercivity.409
2.3.1.4. Semiconductors. 
Vasilyeva et al. synthesized WSe2 nanocrystals with a low degree of agglomeration by CVC. A schematic of their reactor is presented in Fig. 52a. They used hexacarbonyl tungsten and selenium as precursors. W(CO)6 was evaporated in a bubbler kept at 100 °C and carried by argon to a two-zone tube furnace. The first zone with lower temperature (maximum 600 °C) had a removable cartridge in which crystalline Se powder evaporated and mixed with the evaporated W(CO)6. Precursor decomposition and particle formation took place in the second zone at higher temperature (800–1000 °C). The particles had a S–W-S sandwich-like layered morphology with 5–10 layers and interlayer distance of 6.8–7 Å (Fig. 52b). Carbon and oxygen were the main impurities because of the chemical composition of the tungsten precursor, and could be reduced to 4 mol% by reducing the carbonyl concentration. Additionally, they used the WSe2 NPs as anodes in rechargeable Li-ion batteries and reached a high reversible capacity of 590–600 mA h g−1 with capacity retention for over 150 cycles.461

As an example of relatively large-scale synthesis of semiconductor NPs by CVC, Kessler et al. employed a pilot plant scale hot wall reactor (operated at 10–100 kPa to control NP size and morphology) to produce highly-boron-doped silicon. They used silane (SiH4) and diborane (B2H6) at a ratio of 1 to 0.005. The precursor mixture decomposed at 1000 °C and 25 kPa to produce NPs with a specific surface area of 39 m2 g−1 at a rate of 0.5 kg h−1. This high production rate of highly-doped silicon NPs is advantageous for thermoelectric applications which require large quantities of such materials compared to many other applications of nanomaterials, but which also do not require extremely small particles or extremely high surface area.418
Roy et al. decomposed a single-source precursor with a unique chemical design, a siloxy-substituted-ZnO tetranuclear heterocubane ((MeZnOSiMe3)4) that facilitates production of pure zinc silicates and benefits from reduced need for intermolecular processes. This approach enabled the synthesis of α-Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals with the smallest crystal size reported at the time. Their set-up (Fig. 53) included an evaporation tube furnace at 60 to 140 °C for delivery of the precursor, a tube furnace for the decomposition of the precursor at 900 °C, a particle charger, a particle precipitator, and an on-line system for particle-size measurement or size selection. They used nitrogen at 1 lpm as the carrier gas and introduced 0.5 lpm of oxygen to the second furnace to complete the oxidation.453

Le et al. studied the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-anatase nanocrystals synthesized by CVC using titanium(IV) alkoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) delivered from a bubbler at 95 °C by 700 sccm Ar. Oxygen was introduced into the reaction chamber at 7000 sccm to ensure complete oxidation. After mixing the titania NPs with coconut shell activated carbon for photocatalytic applications, they found that the titania performed better than commercial TiO2 for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue.428
Park et al. synthesized Mn/TiO2 NPs by impregnation of Mn-acetate and Mn-nitrite precursors following CVC synthesis of titania NPs by thermal decomposition of titanium(IV) alkoxide at 900 °C and investigated the effect of sulfur on this catalyst for low-temperature NO reduction. They obtained good low-temperature activity and better resistance to S poisoning in the presence of SO2 for catalysts made using the CVC-synthesized titania compared to commercial titania.429 In addition, they used MnOx/TiO2 as a catalyst for oxidation of gaseous formaldehyde with ozone, and it also showed promising performance.432 In another study, they investigated the photocatalytic performance and photoluminescence of V2O5/TiO2 nanocomposites in which titania NPs were produced by CVC and V2O5 was loaded by impregnation. They found that photocatalytic activity was twice that of commercial titania. In addition, they reported that catalysts produced using the CVC-synthesized titania exhibited a higher specific surface area, more Ti3+ ions, more hydroxyl groups, smaller and amorphous particles, and a lower photoluminescence intensity.430 Moreover, they studied NH3-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using the CVC synthesized samples and observed enhancement at low temperatures. They concluded that the greater number of Ti3+ ions and hydroxyl groups resulted in more OH moieties on the catalysts to generate V–OH sites, along with fewer acidic sites than the catalyst made from commercial titania with primarily Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the higher surface area and smaller particle size had a synergistic effect for improved SCR activity at low temperatures because of greater availability of active sites. In addition, they found that the catalysts produced using CVC-synthesized TiO2 exhibited greater reducibility and were active at lower temperatures than those made using commercial TiO2. They attributed this to greater participation of chemisorbed oxygen in the reduction on the surface of the titania samples synthesized by CVC.431
Siedl et al. synthesized titania and tin oxide NPs by CVC and then produced SnO2–TiO2 nanocomposites that could be applied in heterojunction solar cells. They decomposed titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) for titania synthesis and tetrabutyltin (C16H36Sn) for tin oxide synthesis at 800 °C in a CVC reactor. Subsequent thermal treatment at around 600 °C followed by oxidation at the same temperature and cooling in oxygen removed any unreacted precursor to purify the product with the stoichiometric composition. The average sizes of the final NPs were 10 and 13 nm for SnO2 and TiO2 NPs, respectively. Thereafter, a mixture of these NPs was dispersed in formic acid to achieve a high concentration of TiO2-SnO2 heterojunctions by adjustment of the particles’ surface charge to promote heteroaggregation. After vacuum annealing of these materials, they observed an enhanced cross section for interparticle charge separation in this system of heterojunctions via interfacial charge transfer, which produced high concentrations of separated electrons and hole centers and excellent photocatalytic activity.434
2.3.1.5. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Schild et al. interfaced a commercial fluid mechanics code with a simple monodispersed aerosol dynamics model that tracked a single aggregate size, primary particles per aggregate, and specific surface area in a nonuniform temperature and flow field to elucidate the effects of various operating parameters on characteristics of the NPs, such as size and morphology, especially at very early stages of aerosol synthesis. The simulation tracked the chemical reaction of precursor, particle nucleation, and subsequent growth, aggregation, and sintering of NPs in addition to the detailed treatment of mass, energy, and momentum transfer. They considered the synthesis of titania NPs from titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and oxygen in a hot-wall reactor as a case study. With this model, they were able to simulate the very early stages of the aerosol nanosynthesis process and compute the dynamic evolution of the size of aggregated nanoclusters, number of primary particles forming the aggregates, and the specific surface area as a function of position throughout the hot-wall reactor. This simulation was among the first to allow realistic modelling of the synthesis process of NPs in actual CVC reactors under realistically complex conditions.462
Sohn et al. developed a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to analyze phenomena occurring within a CVC process, including fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions along with the formation and growth of NPs. They considered the synthesis of aluminum NPs from aluminum chloride (AlCl3) by reaction with magnesium (Mg) vapor as a case study. Using the model, they reasonably calculated the temperature, velocity profile, and particle size distribution within the CVC reactor. They employed a population balance model and phenomenological chemical reaction rates to model the formation and growth of NPs under different operating conditions, including precursor concentrations and total gas flow rate. They used commercial CFD software (Fluent) for their simulations and employed the Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) to approximate the population balance (aerosol general dynamics equation). By adjusting the unknown rate constants for particle nucleation and growth, they were able to achieve good agreement with experimental data. In general, their spatial CFD model can be employed to predict the NP size distribution, to optimize the synthesis technique, and to visualize internal flow and reaction behaviors in a CVC process which could result deeper understanding of the process.463 In another study, this group performed two-dimensional multiphase CFD simulations to study the CVC process of generating tungsten carbide NPs from tungsten hexachloride (WCl6), methane, and hydrogen. Notably, they performed a parametric investigation to fit rate parameters for the nucleation and growth rates. Again, with these fitted parameters, the computed values for the average size of the NPs and the precursor concentration were in a good agreement with the experimental data.464 While the QMOM approach used to treat the aerosol dynamics in these equations is computationally efficient, well-suited for coupling with detailed CFD modelling, and provides values of particle concentration, mean particle size, and measures of the general shape of the size distribution, reconstruction of a size distribution corresponding to the computed moments can be difficult.465,466
Djenadic and Winterer developed a simple reaction-coagulation-sintering model to investigate the CVC process. They studied the effects of the time-temperature profile on the size, crystallinity, and agglomeration of titania NPs produced by thermal decomposition of titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) in a hot-wall reactor as a case study. Based upon the time-temperature profile, they synthesized pure anatase particles or mixtures of the three stable crystalline phases of anatase, rutile (≤11 vol%), and brookite (≤29 vol%) with primary particle sizes ranging from 1.7–10.5 nm and agglomerate sizes of 24.3–55.6 nm. They regulated the time-temperature profile in the hot-wall reactor with temperatures ranging from 600 °C to 1750 °C using an inductively heated furnace with variable inductor geometry. Using this novel system, they were able to control the size, crystallinity, and agglomeration of the NPs by tuning the time-temperature profile in a CVC process.467 In another study, Winterer employed Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimized time-temperature profiles to improve the extrinsic properties of the NPs synthesized by CVC. This was an important step in moving toward an “inverse design” approach in which desired particle properties are specified and conditions required to achieve those properties are identified.468 Ognjanović and Winterer employed a simple reaction-coagulation-sintering model to study the effects of operating parameters including the reaction temperature and the system pressure on the particle characteristics of aluminum nitride NPs produced in a hot-wall CVC reactor using triethylaluminum (C6H15Al) and ammonia (NH3). They synthesized AlN nanocrystals in pure wurtzite crystalline phase with crystallite sizes of 2.7–11.5 nm and NP sizes of 4.3–12.4 nm. They were able to reduce the degree of agglomeration to a value of one at temperatures above 1400 °C and a system pressure of 100 mbar. This quality of synthesis is crucial for transforming the product powders into nanocrystalline bulk materials. They synthesized nanocrystals temperatures with crystallite size below 3.5 nm without any internal defects, employing milder synthesis conditions. Except at the lowest temperatures, their model predicted the characteristics of the CVC-synthesized NPs well.469
Wergen et al. synthesized germanium NPs through the thermal decomposition of germane (GeH4) in a hot-wall reactor. They employed an external seeding unit with a hot wire generator using niobium, tantalum, tungsten, or molybdenum as the seeding metal to establish a stable aerosol particle concentration. The hot wire generator produced small particles that served as heterogeneous nuclei and inhibited homogeneous nucleation of Ge particles. This prevented the production of hard agglomerates from those small germanium NPs. Among the seeding metals, tungsten and molybdenum produced the most uniform spherical germanium NPs with narrow size distributions (geometrical standard deviations below 1.1). Moreover, they employed a population balance model coupled with the reactor centerline temperature profile from a CFD simulation. The modelling results were validated by the experimental data and showed that the homogenous nucleation rate decreased with increasing concentration of the seeds. This reduced the total concentration of the NPs in the hot-wall reactor. Thus, the modelling provided key insight into the conditions for which heterogeneous nucleation can be expected to dominate homogeneous nucleation and how that translates into production of relatively monodisperse particles by surface growth rather than polydisperse particles associated with coagulation and sintering.470
The shape of nickel NPs is a signification factor in determining their performance in various applications. For instance, a cubic shape, which results in exposure of specific crystal facets and enhanced magnetic properties, may be preferable in catalysis and bioseparations applications, while in multilayer ceramic capacitors spherical nickel NPs are preferred because of their high packing density. While aerosol processes most often produce spherical particles, when the particles grow as a solid, rather than a liquid droplet, production of other shapes is possible. Accordingly, Yang et al. performed theoretical and experimental studies to control the shape of nickel NPs synthesized in a CVC process. Their density functional theory (DFT) modelling study focused on calculating gas adsorption energies and stabilization of Ni (1 0 0) and Ni (1 1 1) surfaces. Either kinetic or thermodynamic stabilization of particular crystal facets can change the shape of the growing NPs. Their modelling results helped to explain the experimental observation that the synthesis of nickel NPs via reduction of nickel chloride (NiCl2) vapor by hydrogen in a tube furnace with two heating zones can lead to a spherical morphology when the second zone employs a hydrogen atmosphere, while a nickel chloride vapor atmosphere favored the synthesis of nickel NPs with a cubic morphology. A fast reduction rate favored production of spherical NPs, while a slower reduction rate led to the formation of cubic NPs.471
Vazquez-Pufleau et al. developed a novel system for the measurement of stable high molecular weight silicon hydride clusters with sizes below 2 nm, generated in a furnace aerosol reactor. A schematic of their experimental apparatus is presented in Fig. 54. The precursor was silane (SiH4) diluted in helium and mixed with a second stream of pure helium before introduction into the furnace aerosol reactor. A sample stream was separated from the main flow leaving the reactor and diluted by a factor of about 45 with nitrogen. A high-resolution differential mobility analyzer with an electrometer was employed to measure the size distribution and better understand the initial stages of silicon NP nucleation and growth during silane pyrolysis in the aerosol reactor. They reported that the diameter of the silicon clusters at the initial stages was around 0.7 nm, which was the first measurement of subnanometer stable silicon hydride clusters from silane pyrolysis. Based on their observations, they studied four roles that subnanometer clusters could play in particle formation, although these observations were not sufficient to conclusively establish their role among these possibilities.416

2.3.2. Spray pyrolysis. 
In spray pyrolysis, rather than delivering vaporized precursors into the reaction zone, as in chemical vapor synthesis, the precursor solutions are atomized and small aerosol droplets are directly delivered by a carrier gas to the reaction chamber, which is usually a tube furnace.37 In the reaction chamber, the solvent evaporates, the solvent vapor diffuses away from the droplet into the gas phase, the droplet shrinks, the temperature of the droplet increases, and solute diffuses toward the droplet center.27,472 Generally, the direct, effective, facile and continuous synthesis of dense NPs with high homogeneity and equiaxed shape along with precise control on the morphology make spray pyrolysis a valuable vapor-phase nanosynthesis technique.37,472,473 However, the generation of hollow particles or broken shells by droplet-to-particle conversion and poor productivity can be considered common limitations of the spray pyrolysis approach.472,473 Jung et al. categorized the benefits and limitations of the spray pyrolysis technique based on the possible aerosol generation techniques.473 The aerosol generation techniques for spray pyrolysis include pneumatic atomization (pressure, two-fluid, nebulizers), ultrasonic atomization, ultrasonic spray nozzle, electrospray, and filter expansion.472,473 Aqueous solutions are generally cheap, safe, and widely available. They are easily handled, and a broad range of water-soluble metal salts like metal chlorides and oxychlorides can be used as the precursors in this approach.472 This method has also been widely used for the synthesis of thin films or the deposition of nanomaterials on substrates, but those applications are beyond of the scope of this review. Instead, we focus on aerosol synthesis of free-standing NPs.
Spray drying is a process similar to spray pyrolysis which is used to synthesize microspheres. The key difference between spray pyrolysis and spray drying is that spray drying is done at relatively low (often ambient) temperatures and mainly involves solvent evaporation without chemical reaction. The atomizer used in spray drying processes is most often a two-fluid nozzle.474–476 The microspheres generated by spray drying have been widely employed for energy storage applications.476–483 Colloidal spray pyrolysis and colloidal spray drying are variations of these methods in which pre-designed colloidal particles are included in the precursor to template particular nanostructures within the product micro (or nano) spheres. In colloidal spray pyrolysis, the template NPs and chemical precursors are sprayed into a tube furnace to form various nanostructured materials.484,485

2.3.2.1. Ceramic oxides. 
Ruthner pioneered the spray pyrolysis approach and was the first to commercially synthesize nanomaterials using this method. In the “Ruthner process” (Fig. 56), the aerosol droplets of metal chloride solutions are injected into a vertical furnace from the top. The furnace temperature was 700 °C to 1000 °C. The synthesized particles were delivered to a cyclone to be separated from the gas. The hydrogen chloride byproduct was separated from the exhaust gas by a wet scrubber. The overall size of the synthesized particles was in the range of 25 to 400 μm which meant that they required post-processing steps, like ball milling, to reach nanoscale dimensions.486,487 He employed this process to synthesize alkali-free Al2O3;488 MgO, MgO–Cr2O3, and MgO–Al2O3;489 and multi-component metal oxides at industrial scale.490

Liu et al. used an ultrasonic atomizer with the spray pyrolysis technique to make spherical monodispersed zinc oxide NPs. The precursor was zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2) dissolved in methanol (CH3OH). A schematic of their experimental set-up is presented in Fig. 57. The ultrasonic atomizer produced aerosol droplets that were delivered by a mixture of air and nitrogen to a furnace at the low temperature of 200 °C because they wanted a temperature between dehydration temperature (water boiling point) of 100 °C and the decomposition temperature of the precursor solution which was 240 °C. Thus, the aerosol droplets were converted into zinc acetate particles that were delivered to a second furnace at a much higher temperature of approximately 500 °C where they were converted into zinc oxide NPs with a mean primary particle size in the range of 100–200 nm and a specific surface area of around 50 m2 g−1. Dissolving the precursor in alcohol instead of water allowed the synthesis of spherical solid particles rather than hollow shells. They found that the flow rate of carrier gas and the precursor solution concentration strongly influenced the characteristics of the final products. Increasing the flow rate of the carrier gas produced smaller NPs and increasing the precursor solution concentration generated larger quantities of ultrafine zinc oxide NPs. They considered the high vapor pressure of the precursor solution as the main reason for the synthesis of ultrafine NPs.491

Vanheusden et al. also synthesized zinc oxide NPs using spray pyrolysis. They thermally decomposed droplets of aqueous zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2) generated by an ultrasonic atomizer and delivered at a carrier gas flow rate of 10 lpm to a ceramic tube furnace with a diameter of 9 cm and length of 1.52 m, held at various temperatures in the range of 700 to 900 °C. The carrier gas was nitrogen, air, or a N2:H2 (93:7) mixture. Notably, they performed a reductive post-treatment at 800 °C for 20 min. They investigated the optical and magnetic properties of the NPs and found a strong correlation between green emission intensity at 510 nm and the concentration of paramagnetic isolated oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, both the intensity and the oxygen vacancy density were observed to peak at a free-carrier concentration of approximately 1.4 × 1018 cm−3, showing that the paramagnetic isolated oxygen vacancy is responsible for the green photoluminescence in their zinc oxide.492
Zhang et al. employed spray pyrolysis for synthesis of 4 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia nanomaterials. They investigated the effect of the relative solution saturation and the type of precursor on the synthesis process. They used five different zirconium precursors with different decomposition temperatures, including zirconyl hydroxychloride (ZrO(OH)Cl), zirconyl chloride octahydrate (ZrOCl2·8H2O), zirconyl nitrate hydrate (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O), zirconium acetate (Zr(CH3COO)4), and zirconyl hydroxyacetate (ZrO(OH)0.5(CH3COO)1.5). The yttrium precursor was yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O). A two-fluid atomizer was employed to produce aerosol droplets that were carried into a furnace with overall length of 1.2 m and four separately-heated zones with equal lengths and temperatures of 300, 500, 750, and 750 °C, with the lowest temperature at the furnace inlet side. They could synthesize solid spherical particles with a high degree of homogeneity when the initial relative solution saturation was limited to about 0.01, which allowed them to keep the concentration of salt homogeneous before precipitation, because the droplet volume decreased dramatically before precipitation. Indeed, high solubility of the precursor was not an intrinsically important factor for the synthesis of dense nanomaterials, provided the initial relative solution saturation was low. At higher initial relative saturation, the solubility of the precursor and the oxide content play important roles in the synthesis process. They reported that the best results for the synthesis of zirconia NPs were achieved by decomposition of zirconyl hydroxide and zirconyl chloride.493 Lenggoro et al. also synthesized zirconia NPs by spray pyrolysis. They employed an ultrasonic nebulizer with a frequency of 1.75 MHz to atomize the aqueous precursor solution of zirconyl hydroxyl chloride (ZrO(OH)Cl) to form aerosol droplets of 4.5 μm mean diameter. They used an alumina tube furnace with an inner diameter of 13 mm and length of 1 m, with 5 independent heating zones of equal length. The tube furnace was oriented vertically and from the top the zones had temperatures of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. They investigated the effect of various operating parameters on the morphology of the synthesized NPs and found that high reactor temperature, steep temperature gradient, high carrier gas flow rate, and low initial precursor concentration in the solution led to hollow particles; otherwise, solid dense particles could be synthesized. In addition, they developed a numerical simulation of the spray pyrolysis process which yielded predictions in good agreement with the experimental results.558
Rulison and Flagan synthesized yttria particles from concentrated precursor solutions of about 400 g L−1 using electrospray pyrolysis. In addition to getting higher production rate, using a concentrated precursor solution is advantageous for producing particles of higher purity due to the lower concentration of nonvolatile solvent impurities. They used yttrium nitrate pentahydrate (Y(NO3)3·5H2O) or yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) dissolved in in 1-propanol (C3H8O) as the precursor. It was injected into a stainless-steel capillary with a diameter of 1.57 mm as the electrode. The electrode was located 8 mm above a stainless-steel plate with a 10 mm diameter hole as the counter-electrode. They applied a potential to the electrode using a high-voltage power supply. A Taylor cone formed at a critical value of potential applied to the electrode. The potential was increased to 1.1–1.5 times the critical potential value to launch and maintain stable electrospraying. They used a SF6 gas flow to purge the top part of the atomizer to avoid corona discharge at the Taylor cone. The SF6 flow was saturated with 1-propanol to avoid evaporation of the solvent at the cone and the formation of a solute crust. They used a corona needle located beneath the counter-electrode with a high potential opposite to the potential of the electrode to deflect the charged droplets away from the counter-electrode and discharge them. When the corona needle was adjusted such that the net current to ground was negligible (below 10 nA), which produced charge-free aerosol droplets, a maximum throughput efficiency of 50% was achieved. The aerosol droplets were delivered by air as the carrier gas to an alumina tube with an inner diameter of 56 mm and length of 1.5 m in an electric furnace to be pyrolyzed. The temperature of the furnace was 550 °C and the residence time in the reaction zone was about 5.7 s. They used two concentrations of 41.1 and 441 g L−1 in the solvent for the yttrium nitrate pentahydrate and 93.4 g L−1 for yttrium nitrate hexahydrate. The average size of the synthesized particles was in the range of 170–290 nm. The type of precursor played a substantial role in controlling the particle morphology. Using yttrium nitrate pentahydrate as the precursor produced particles with a dense spheroidal morphology due to formation of a particle surface that was permeable to alcohol vapor, while a hollow inflated spherical morphology was produced when yttrium nitrate hexahydrate was the precursor, due to alcohol vapor trapped within the particle, whose surface was impermeable in this case.548
Lin et al. produced novel ternary Cu/Cu2O/CuO hollow sphere nanocomposites by spray pyrolysis. They dissolved copper nitrate hemipentahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·2.5H2O) and citric acid (C6H8O7) in DI water, and after adding ammonia (NH3), atomized the solution in a Collison nebulizer and delivered it in nitrogen to a quartz tube furnace at 850 °C, where the residence time was ∼1.2 s. Ammonia played the role of template for the formation of hollow structures. A schematic of the synthesis mechanism of these nanomaterials is shown in Fig. 58. They used these nanocomposites as non-enzymatic electrochemical biosensors for glucose detection, achieving an impressive sensitivity of 8726 μA (cm2 mM)−1 and a detection limit as low as 0.39 μM.535

Park et al. employed a two-step process, using spray pyrolysis to generate CoSex–C nanocomposites followed by thermal oxidation in air at 300 to 500 °C, to synthesize CoSeO3 microspheres. A schematic of the synthesis mechanism is presented in Fig. 59a. In the spray pyrolysis step, they atomized an aqueous precursor solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), selenous acid (SeO2), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ((C6H9NO)n) as a template for the microsphere structure. The aerosolized precursor, in argon and hydrogen carrier gas, flowed through a tube furnace at 800 °C. Fig. 59b shows elemental mapping images of the CoSex–C nanocomposites. After thermal oxidation, the microspheres were employed as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Metal selenides are effective in this application because of their efficient transformation into the metal selenide and oxide nanocrystals, with rapid surface reaction kinetics and charge transport provided by this heterostructure. Accordingly, they reported that the synthesized CoSeO3 microspheres retained a high reversible capacity of 709 mA h g−1 for the 1400th cycle, at a current density of 3.0 A g−1 and a reversible discharge capacity of 526 mA h g−1 at exceptionally high current density of 30 A g−1.534

Although tin oxide has high theoretical capacity as a lithium ion battery anode material, challenges including low electronic conductivity and a huge volume change during cycling limit its use. Synthesis of engineered nanostructures of such oxide materials can provide high specific surface area and improved structural stability to overcome these challenges. Accordingly, Leng et al. synthesized tin oxide–carbon nanocomposites in a novel dried plum-like yolk–shell structure using spray pyrolysis. They dissolved tin oxalate (SnC2O4) in water and added nitric acid (HNO3) to form a stable tin precursor solution. Moreover, they added polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ((C6H9NO)n) as a template to form a carbon matrix and plum-like yolk–shell structure. They atomized the solution using an ultrasonic nebulizer with a frequency of 1.7 MHz and delivered the aerosol droplets in argon to a 3-zone vertical furnace at 750 °C. In addition, they generated tin oxide microspheres with dense and porous structure when they did not add PVP to the precursor solution, or when they added oxygen to the argon. The synthesis mechanism and SEM images of the nanomaterials with various morphologies are presented in Fig. 60. Among the synthesized nanomaterials, the SnOx/C nanocomposites with yolk–shell morphology provided the best performance as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, with an impressive reversible discharge capacity of 1142 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability of 509 mA h g−1, even at a current density of 5 A g−1, along with nearly 100%, capacity retention after 600 cycles.565

2.3.2.2. Doped ceramic oxides. 
Kang et al. directly synthesized non-agglomerated spherical europium-doped yttria particles by spray pyrolysis of yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3) and europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3) using an ultrasonic atomizer with a 1.7 MHz resonator. They investigated the effect of the precursor solution concentration and pyrolysis temperature on the size, morphology, crystallinity, and photoluminescence of the NPs. The overall precursor concentration was varied from 0.03–1 M in water to control the size. They delivered the aerosol droplets in nitrogen at 2 lpm to the reaction zone at 500 to 1400 °C. The corresponding residence times varied from 1.1 to 2.4 s. Synthesis at temperatures higher than 600 °C produced highly-crystalline particles, and the crystallinity increased with increasing temperature of the reaction zone. As shown in Fig. 61, increasing the concentration of the precursor solution increased the size of the particles in the range of 0.34 to 1.2 μm. Without annealing, the as-synthesized particles exhibited strong red emission at 612 nm under UV illumination, which the authors attributed to small size, non-aggregation, pure phase, and uniform dispersion of the dopant in the host lattice. Increasing the temperature of the reaction zone led to higher brightness of as-synthesized particles.550 In another study, they employed colloidal seed-assisted spray pyrolysis to produce europium doped yttria particles. They used yttrium hydroxycarbonate (C3H6O12Y) and gadolinium hydroxycarbonate (CH2GdO4) as nucleation seeds for yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3) and europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3) in this approach. As illustrated in Fig. 62, using small amounts of yttrium hydroxycarbonate or gadolinium hydroxycarbonate solutions generated doped spherical particles with a dense morphology in contrast to the hollow and porous structures obtained without using the hydroxycarbonate solutions as the colloidal seeds.551

Kim et al. employed ultrasonic spray pyrolysis to synthesize pristine and Sn-doped NiO. The precursor was a mixture of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), tin oxalate (SnC2O4), and dextrin ((C6H10O5)x·nH2O) in water. Dextrin serves as a template to form a “multiroom” nanostructure from the Sn-doped NiO after it pyrolyzes to leave large pores with thin walls. To synthesize pristine nickel oxide, they used a precursor solution without tin oxalate, and to form a dense structure they employed a solution without dextrin. Five 1.7 MHz piezoelectric transducers were used to atomize the precursor solution, and the aerosol droplets in 15 lpm N2 that flowed through a tube furnace at 400 °C. Post-annealing in air at 500 °C for 3 hours produced the final structure by removing the dextrin template. The synthesis mechanism and the SEM images of the nanomaterials are presented in Fig. 63. They used the synthesized NPs in a resistive gas sensor to detect xylene and found that the tin-doped NPs with the multiroom structure exhibited an excellent resistance ratio of 65.4 at 300 °C which was 9.0 and 50.3 times those of the doped NPs with dense morphology and pristine NPs, respectively. They proposed that the high gas accessibility provided by the unique multiroom structure and change in the oxygen adsorption, in addition to the charge carrier concentration provided by tin doping, were the main factors underlying the strong response to xylene. Moreover, they found that the Sn-doped NiO with multiroom structure exhibited a high selectivity towards xylene, due to the high catalytic activity of the tin doped NPs for decomposition of xylene within the multiroom structure.524

2.3.2.3. Doped mixed metal oxides. 
Kang et al. studied the synthesis of cerium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) by the same approach. They used aqueous nitrate precursors for yttrium, aluminum, and cerium. The yttrium and aluminum precursors were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio, while the concentration of cerium nitrate varied from 0.5 to 3 at% to achieve optimal doping that maximized photoluminescence intensity, which was found to be 1 at% of cerium. Furthermore, they reported that increasing the overall precursor concentration increased the average particle size. The particles absorbed light from 403 to 510 nm with a maximum at 470 nm, and showed a broad emission from 480 to 650 nm with a maximum at 528 nm. Increasing the annealing temperature produced a monotonic increase in the photoluminescence intensity. Moreover, they observed spherical non-agglomerated particles after annealing at 1300 °C. Indeed, annealing at lower temperatures compared to the conventional synthesis processes produced higher purity and more crystalline Y3Al5O12:Eu particles, due to the microscale confined reaction within the micron-sized aerosol droplets. Notably, they observed significant formation of hard aggregates after annealing at 1600 °C.555 They also employed the spray pyrolysis method to produce spherical fine Tb-doped Y2SiO5 particles with a narrow size distribution. The precursors were tetraethyl-orthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4), yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3), and terbium nitrate (Tb(NO3)3). They performed the synthesis at temperatures in the range of 600–1200 °C and found that temperatures below 1100 °C produced particles with low crystallinity due to the short residence time of the particles in the reaction zone. However, the as-synthesized particles had high crystallinity at 1200 °C. In addition, they calcined their product at temperatures above 800 °C and observed a change in the crystalline phase for temperatures above 1400 °C. No formation of hard aggregates was observed, even for the particles calcined at 1200 °C. The as-synthesized doped particles absorbed light from 220 to 325 nm with a peak near 240 nm. The main emission peak was at 538 nm. Doping with 4 at% Tb maximized brightness. The dopant was directly activated in the hot wall reactor even at short residence times, demonstrating that calcination at high temperatures was not necessary for its activation. The photoluminescence of particles synthesized at 1200 °C was 96% of the maximum intensity achieved after calcination.553
Kang and Park synthesized spherical non-agglomerated Mn-doped Zn2SiO4 particles by spray pyrolysis using a filter expansion aerosol generator (FEAG) to atomize the precursor solution. The FEAG included a pneumatic nozzle, a vacuum pump, and a porous glass filter. The precursor solution was sprayed through the pneumatic nozzle on the porous glass filter by carrier gas. A thin film of precursor solution was generated on the surface of the porous glass filter. Subsequently, the thin film of precursor solution passed through the filter, driven by the carrier gas, and expanded into the hot-wall reactor at a low-pressure of 60 Torr and temperatures of 700–1000 °C. They performed post-calcination at temperatures of 1000, 1100, 1200, and 1300 °C to optimize crystallization and activation of the dopant. The precursors were zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2), tetraethyl-orthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4), and manganese acetate (Mn(CH3COO)2). Synthesis at 600 °C produced amorphous particles, but crystalline particles were synthesized above 700 °C. Orthorhombic β-Zn2SiO4 was produced at 1000 °C. Calcination for 5 hours at 1200 °C with manganese doping of 1.3 at% produced the maximum cathodoluminescence intensity of 198 cd m−2. Using 80 to 90% of the stoichiometric amount of zinc nitrate in the precursor solution produced phase-pure material with the willemite structure.538 Lenggoro et al. employed the same strategy for direct synthesis of photoluminescent cerium- and terbium-doped lanthanum phosphate particles with green emission at 543 nm. Aqueous nitrate precursors were used, with added nitric acid (HNO3) to form a uniform solution. That solution was added to an aqueous phosphoric acid (H3PO4) solution. This final precursor solution was sprayed into the reaction zone, held at 600 to 1550 °C. They found that increasing the temperature of the reaction zone increased the crystallinity and photoluminescence intensity of the particles. They produced pure crystalline doped lanthanum phosphate at temperatures above 1000 °C, and the maximum photoluminescence intensity was observed for particles synthesized at 1500 °C. Morphologies of the commercial and as-synthesized cerium- and terbium-doped lanthanum phosphate particles are compared in Fig. 64.571

Santiago et al. used ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for fast and simultaneous doping of Sr0.9−x−y−zCa0.1In2O4:(xEu3+,yTm3+,zTb3+) as a single-phase white phosphor containing various cations. The precursors were nitrates for the host matrix elements, including strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O), and indium nitrate (In(NO3)3), and oxide precursors for dopant elements including europium oxide (Eu2O3), terbium oxide (Tb4O7), and thulium oxide (Tm2O3). The solvent for the host precursors was water, and for water-insoluble dopant precursors was nitric acid (HNO3). A 2.4 MHz ultrasonic nebulizer generated droplets, the carrier gas was oxygen, and the thermal decomposition occurred in a tube furnace with two independent heating zones of 700 and 1050 °C. They investigated the photoluminescence characteristics for the co-doped NPs and reported that undoped Sr0.9Ca0.1In2O4 exhibited a near blue color emission, while all the co-doped materials exhibited white emission with similar chromaticity coordinates to standard white. Moreover, they hypothesized that energy transfer between various dopant ions played a significant role in producing a particular emission color.547
Park et al. synthesized NiMoO4 NPs with a yolk–shell morphology and unique hollow-yolk internal structure through ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), with sucrose (C12H22O11) as a templating agent, were dissolved in water and atomized by an ultrasonic nebulizer. Upon pyrolysis in air within a tube furnace at 800 °C, the droplets were converted into yolk–shell NiMoO4 NPs. For use as high performance anode materials in lithium-ion batteries, these NPs were coated with nitrogen-doped carbon and the internal “yolk” particles were converted into hollow particles. For this, the NPs were first selenized under H2Se for 6 hours at 350 °C to produce NiSe2–MoSe2 nanocomposite yolk–shell structures. The re-oxidation of these microspheres produced overall yolk–shell microspheres. Dispersing these hierarchically-structured microspheres in tris-buffer at pH 8.7, adding dopamine hydrochloride, stirring for 12 hours, washing with DI water and ethanol, drying in a vacuum oven and finally, post-annealing under argon yielded the final N-doped C-coated NiMoO4 hollow-yolk–shell microspheres. These anode materials exhibited a high discharge capacity of 862 mA h g−1 for the 500th cycle at a current density of 3.0 A g−1 and an excellent final discharge capacity of 757 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. They proposed that the high lithium-ion uptake and rate capability exhibited by these anode materials resulted from synergy between the hollow nanospheres forming the yolk–shell microspheres and the N-doped C-coating layer. While multiple processing steps were required to achieve the final structure in this case, controlled formation of the overall yolk–shell structure was enabled by the spray pyrolysis process.530
2.3.2.4. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Taniguchi et al. employed ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for the synthesis of LiMn2O4 and its substituted forms LiM1/6Mn11/6O4 where M was Co, Ni, or Al. They used nitrate precursors at 800 °C, which generated spherical particles with a densely-packed interior structure, a crystallite size of around 30 nm, and specific surface areas in the range of 5.7–12.7 m2 g−1, at a production rate of 500 mg h−1. They investigated the charge/discharge properties of the NPs as cathode materials for Li-ion batteries and found that the LiMn2O4 had a first discharge capacity of 129 mA h g−1 at 0.2 mA cm−2 with more stable cycling performance compared to the same material synthesized by solid-state reaction. Among the compositions tested, LiCo1/6Mn11/6O4 had the minimum capacity loss of 2% after 30 cycles.494 In addition, they investigated the effect of temperature profile and flow rate of carrier gas on the process. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O) were dissolved in water to make the precursor solution. A schematic of the apparatus is presented in Fig. 65a. They used a tube furnace with 6 independently adjustable heating zones, wither with constant temperature at 800 °C in the tube furnace or with an axial increase in the temperature of the zones so that the temperatures were 200, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 800 °C. The flow rate of gas was also varied from 500 to 4000 sccm. As evident in Fig. 65b and c, both the flow rate of carrier gas and the axial temperature profile influenced the morphology of the particles. Decreasing the flow rate of carrier gas and the use of an increasing temperature profile resulted in dense particles with shrinkage, whereas high gas flow rates and a uniform high temperature produced hollow particles. Upon using the synthesized particles as cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries, they found that morphology, crystallite size, and specific surface area of the synthesized particles affected the discharge capacity.495 Matsuda and Taniguchi employed additional precursors for the synthesis of LiMn2O4 with various morphologies and interior structures by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. They thermally decomposed aqueous lithium nitrate (LiNO3), lithium acetate dihydrate (Li(CH3COO)·2H2O), or lithium formate monohydrate (Li(HCOO)·H2O) with manganese nitrate hexahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·6H2O), manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O), or manganese formate dihydrate (Mn(HCOO)2·2H2O) in a tube furnace at 800 °C. The as-synthesized LiMn2O4 particles had varied morphologies, including dense particles with porous surface structures, hollow particles with shrinkage-induced surface structure, hollow particles with porous surface structure, and hollow particles with smooth surface structure. In addition, they again used the particles as cathodes in lithium-ion batteries and found that the particles with larger crystallite size and smaller specific surface area exhibited better cycle performance. The dense particles were most appropriate for use as the cathode active material in lithium-ion batteries.496

Park et al. synthesized (Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 powder by spray pyrolysis. They dissolved a mixture of metal nitrate hydrate precursors in water and thermally decomposed the aqueous solution in a vertical tube furnace at 500 °C. Notably, they added citric acid (C6H8O7) to the precursor solution to facilitate polymerization. Thereafter, they mixed the pyrolyzed powders with lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H2O) and heated it to 900 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1 to synthesize Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 for lithium-ion battery applications. They observed that the synthesized electrode delivered a promising discharge capacity of 188 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.8–4.6 V at a high current density of 20 mA g−1 with impressive cyclability.528
Lenggoro et al. synthesized nickel oxide NPs using a low-pressure spray pyrolysis approach. In their set-up (Fig. 66a), they used a two-fluid nozzle to spray the precursor solution. A carrier gas delivered the liquid to a porous glass filter surface to form a thin layer of liquid film. After passing through the pores of the glass filter, the liquid film was expanded to a liquid jet and aerosol droplets formed. These were carried into a low-pressure quartz tube furnace with an inner diameter of 38 nm and length of 800 mm, with 5 independent heating zones of equal lengths. The pressure was 10 or 40 Torr. They used nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel chloride (NiCl2), or nickel formate dihydrate (Ni(HCO2)2·2H2O) as the nickel precursor. The effect of precursor choice is presented in Fig. 66b. Only nickel nitrate produced a nanoparticulate product. In addition, they operated at temperatures of 400 to 1200 °C. As shown in Fig. 66c, increasing the temperature reduced the particle size, and at 900 °C the submicron particles were mainly converted to aggregates of ∼20 nm NPs. Furthermore, they varied the residence time in the reaction zone by changing the flow rate of carrier gas and adjusting the pressure difference between the upper and lower surface of the glass filter. Decreasing the residence time, which increased the heating rate of precursor droplets, led to breakage into smaller particles in the low-pressure spray pyrolysis reactor (Fig. 66d). Overall, they concluded that the rate of solvent evaporation, precipitate diffusion, and solubility of the precursor are the main factors that must be controlled for synthesis of non-agglomerated NPs in the low-pressure spray pyrolysis system.521 They also investigated effects of carrier gas flow rate, precursor solution concentration, pressure, and type of reducing agent on the synthesis of nickel NPs using the same low-pressure spray pyrolysis reactor. The nickel precursor was nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and the reducing agents were ethanol (C2H5OH), formic acid (HCOOH), and hydrogen. They found the flow rate of the carrier gas and the pressure of the reaction zone were key factors governing the reduction of nickel to its metallic state and the size of nickel NPs. Decreasing the carrier gas flow rate and increasing the pressure increased the possibility of producing submicron particles rather than NPs. In addition, they observed that increasing the precursor solution concentration facilitated the synthesis of NPs, while precursor solutions with a very low concentration, like 0.15 M, yielded submicron particles. Moreover, they successfully reduced the nickel oxide to nickel using ethanol and formic acid as safer alternatives to hydrogen as a reducing agent. Furthermore, they reported that the nickel NPs synthesized by low-pressure spray pyrolysis are more prone to oxidation compared to the submicron particles synthesized by conventional spray pyrolysis, which could be explained by either their higher surface area or incomplete reduction due to decreased exposure to hydrogen (lower hydrogen partial pressure).519

Oh et al. produced crystalline transition metal oxides including nickel oxide, cobalt oxide, and copper oxide in nanoparticulate form by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. The precursor for each was the corresponding metal nitrate hydrate dissolved in water. Citric acid (C6H8O) was added to promote polymerization, while ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) was added to adjust the pH. After atomization by an ultrasonic nebulizer at 1.7 MHz, the precursor droplets thermally decomposed in a vertical furnace at 500 °C. The product particles were calcined at 300 to 900 °C, and increasing the calcination temperature increased the crystallite size and significantly affected the morphology of the final NPs (Fig. 67), which in turn affected their electrochemical performance as the active component of lithium-ion battery anodes. In addition, they found optimum calcination temperatures, based upon the electrochemical performance, which were 500, 700, and 500 °C for NiO, Co3O4, and CuO, respectively.522

Kundu et al. synthesized hollow spherical NiCo2O4 nanospheres, with sizes in the range of 300 to 500 nm, by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. The aerosol droplets of aqueous precursor solutions of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O) were thermally decomposed in a furnace at 1200 °C. They used the hollow spherical particles as electrodes in lithium-ion batteries where they exhibited high capacity after 1000 cycles and in supercapacitors where they provided superior specific capacitance even after 3000 charge–discharge cycles.529
Basak et al. employed a novel electrospray pyrolysis system to synthesize iron oxide NPs. Their experimental set-up (Fig. 68) included four main units, which were electrospray, reaction, size distribution measurement, and collection. To achieve suitable aerosol flow rates to synthesize NPs of varied size, they employed two different electrospray units. The first comprised a stainless-steel capillary tube with an inner diameter of 0.16 mm which was 5 mm from the ground electrode. The second was a commercial electrospray with an inner diameter of 0.04 mm and a nebulizer inside it. To avoid generation of a corona, they applied a positive polarity to the capillary needle. The aerosol droplets of the precursor solution were delivered in air to a high-temperature tube furnace for reaction. Notably, they added carbon dioxide to the carrier gas as another way to retard the formation of a corona. A scanning mobility particle sizer was used to characterize the aerosol at the inlet and outlet of the tube furnace. The collection unit used an electrostatic sampler for deposition of particles onto TEM grids for analysis. The precursor solution was iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) dissolved in water or ethanol (C2H5OH) and the furnace temperature ranged from 20 to 900 °C. Pure iron oxide NPs with a minimum size of 6.8 nm and average size of 11 nm were synthesized at temperatures above 700 °C. In addition, they developed a general scaling law relating the NP size to the operating parameters. Based on data from the literature compared to the size of iron nitrate NPs synthesize by the electrospray unit, the developed scaling law appeared reliable, which facilitated selection of operating parameters to synthesize NPs of desired average size.515

Suh and Suslick produced silica-encapsulated cobalt from colloidal silica (SiO2) and dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co2(CO)8) as precursors, styrene (C8H8), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (C10H14O4), 1,4-dioxane (C4H8O2), azobisisobutyronitrile (C8H12N4), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaC12H25SO4) as organic monomers, initiator, and surfactant, and water as solvent. A schematic of their experimental set-up is provided in Fig. 69a. The precursor mixture was atomized by a low-cost 1.7 MHz ultrasonic nebulizer from a household humidifier. The aerosol droplets were carried into a tube furnace at 200 °C to initiate polymerization. Then, the composite of silica-encapsulated cobalt and the organic polymer flowed to a second furnace at 700 °C to pyrolyze and remove the polymer. Finally, the particles were collected in water-filled bubblers. The final particles had a porous morphology that was controlled by adjusting the ratio of silica to organic monomers. A schematic of the synthesis mechanism is presented in Fig. 69b. Based upon magnetization measurements, they found the nanocomposites were resistant to oxidation in air.531

Du et al. employed a gas-templated ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique and subsequent calcination in air for synthesis of porous hollow cobalt oxide microspheres. The precursor was an aqueous solution of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) at a fixed concentration and various concentrations of urea (CH4N2O). After atomization with a 1.7 MHz ultrasonic nebulizer, the aerosol droplets of the precursor solution entered a tube furnace at a temperature of 480 °C. The product particles were then calcined at 600 °C. The synthesized porous hollow cobalt oxide microspheres were composed of many smaller NPs. Urea decomposition into gaseous components led to gas generation within the droplets, which the authors considered formation of a gas template. The amount of gas escaping from the aerosol droplets played a key role in the formation of morphologies with varied porosity, while the urea to cobalt source ratio was important to control the size of the NPs. They used the hollow porous microspheres as anode materials in lithium ion batteries. The porosity of the microspheres and the size of NPs affected their performance in the application, and the control of porosity was advantageous to test the relationships between structure and function for the development of cycling stability of electrodes. The microspheres with the optimal porosity possessed superior first charge capacity, charge cycle performance, and high rate performance in lithium-ion batteries.533
Im et al. produced cobalt-doped zinc oxide hollow spheres by spray pyrolysis using cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) in a mixture of methanol and water, atomized by a 1.7 mHz ultrasonic nebulizer with nitrogen carrier gas at 500 °C. They then employed pseudomorphic replication to produce cobalt-nitrogen–carbon catalysts by first growing a zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-8) on the hollow microspheres (using ZnO in the microspheres as the Zn precursor) then pyrolyzing these in Ar at 800 °C to produce highly-porous cobalt-doped metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–NC) microspheres. A schematic of the mechanism of hollow Co–NC microsphere formation is presented in Fig. 70. They used the final products as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, achieving a high half-wave potential of 0.904 V and an impressive power density of 271 mW cm−2. Notably, this did not require activation by leaching, which is typically required to remove excess metal and activate such M–NC catalysts.537

2.3.2.5. Semiconductors. 
Skrabalak and Suslick produced porous MoS2 particles using colloidal silica as a sacrificial agent in ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. The precursor mixture included ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) and colloidal silica which were atomized by an ultrasonic nebulizer and delivered to a furnace at 700 °C. They then removed the silica using hydrofluoric acid (HF). For comparison, they prepared MoS2 materials by spray pyrolysis without a template and by conventional thermal decomposition. The silica template significantly increased the surface area, which varied with template size and concentration, while non-templated MoS2 particles had a surface area as low as conventionally-prepared material. SEM images of the MoS2 particles are presented in Fig. 71. In addition, they investigated the catalytic activity of the materials for thiophene (C4H4S) hydrodesulfurization, and found that the highly-porous MoS2 materials had higher catalytic activity, although the catalytic activity of the non-templated MoS2 materials from ultrasonic spray pyrolysis was also greater than that of conventional MoS2. Moreover, they reported that incorporation of cobalt into the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis-synthesized catalysts enhanced their catalytic activity to a value even greater than that of RuS2.559

Suslick's group also synthesized Ni2+-doped ZnS using the same strategy. They used zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2), thiourea (CH4N2S), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2), and colloidal silica (SiO2) in water and delivered it in argon to a tube furnace at 700 °C, which produced ZnS:Ni2+ mesoporous hollow microspheres after leaching with HF to remove the silica template. Increasing the temperature of the reaction zone from 700 to 1000 °C resulted in agglomerated ZnS:Ni2+ NPs, although without using the silica template, the synthesis at 1000 °C resulted only in micron-sized solid microspheres. The synthesis mechanisms and morphologies of mesoporous hollow ZnS:Ni2+ microspheres and ZnS:Ni2+ NPs are presented in Fig. 72. They investigated the optical properties of the particles under UV-vis illumination and found that all three morphologies exhibited broader absorbance compared to pristine zinc sulfide, due to a new energy level in the band gap arising from doping with Ni2+. Increasing the synthesis temperature led to an increase in the absorbance from doping with Ni2+ and the crystallite size of the NPs, which enhanced their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance compared to both hollow and solid microspheres. Furthermore, they found that the ultrasonic spray pyrolized NPs were more stable and active compared to particles made by the conventional co-precipitation method, illustrating the benefits of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis for producing photocatalysts.543

Sharma et al. used spray pyrolysis to synthesize porous and hollow zinc sulfide nanospheres and microspheres using zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O), thiourea (CH4N2S), and water as zinc precursor, sulfur precursor and solvent, respectively, at 500 to 700 °C. They added templates such as polyethylene glycol methyl ether (PEG) (CH3(OCH2CH2)nOH), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ((C6H9NO)n), ethylene oxide (C2H4O)/propylene oxide (C3H6O) block copolymer (Pluronic F-38), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (C19H42BrN) to form zinc sulfide nanospheres and microspheres with varied internal morphology. The zinc and sulfur precursors reacted to form a bis-thiourea zinc acetate (BTZA) complex. The complex precipitated upon solvent evaporation, then decomposed to zinc sulfide upon further heating. Among the templates, PEG and Pluronic F-38, which precipitated after the complex formed, produced structures with a zinc sulfide shell and a hollow core, while the other two templates significantly interacted with the complex and zinc sulfide, such that the template and zinc sulfide remained intermixed. The templates could be pyrolyzed to form hollow or porous zinc sulfide microspheres made of many smaller nanocrystals. These relatively large and well-defined pore structures can provide high surface area and access to catalytic sites, which could make them advantageous for photocatalysis applications.540
Li et al. used spray pyrolysis to produce fluorine-doped titania particles from hexafluorotitanic acid (H2TiF6), which was nebulized and delivered to a tube furnace at 900 °C. This generated spherical F-doped TiO2 powders with doping levels of 2.76–9.40 at%, strong surface acidity, and a rough surface morphology (Fig. 73). They tested the photocatalytic activity of the particles for the both visible and UV light-driven degradation of acetaldehyde and found they had greater photocatalytic activity compared to that of commercial titania due to greater surface acidity, greater number of active sites, and oxygen vacancy creation, which were enabled by fluorine doping. Enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light was attributable to creation of surface oxygen vacancies, rather than oxygen vacancies in the bulk, which could be a unique feature of particles produced by this method.508 In another study, they dissolved titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in water and thermally decomposed them at 800 °C in a spray pyrolysis process to produce titania particles co-doped with nitrogen and fluorine at 0.10–0.26 and 0.11–0.40 at%, respectively. Doping level was controlled by adjusting the decomposition temperature. The synthesis mechanisms and morphologies of the co-doped titania particles and pristine titania particles are compared in Fig. 74. The co-doped particles were highly-porous and spherical with high acidity, which improved their photocatalytic activity. They suggested that gas evolution from ammonium fluoride decomposition and incorporation of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as a template generated the highly-porous nitrogen- and fluorine-co-doped titania particles.509

Zhao et al. produced silver/titania nanocomposites by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of aqueous silver nitrate (AgNO3) and commercially-available titania NPs. Precursor droplets with a mean diameter of 1.8 μm were produced by a 2.4 MHz ultrasonic nebulizer and delivered in nitrogen into a diffusion dryer to evaporate water and concentrate silver nitrate on the surface of titania NPs, then introduced into a horizontal quartz tube furnace at 550 °C for thermal decomposition. They used the nanocomposites for simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction and compared the results with those of nanocomposites synthesized by a conventional wet-impregnation method and with those of bare titania NPs. They found that 2 wt% silver in the nanocomposite yielded the best photocatalytic activity, which was 6 times that of nanocomposites synthesized by wet-impregnation and 60 times that of the bare titania NPs. They suggested that this superior photocatalytic activity could be related to the better dispersion of silver on the surface of titania, the synthesis of smaller silver NPs, and greater production of metallic silver species.511
Chen et al. produced anatase titania microspheres with a yolk@shell morphology by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis followed by annealing in air. An air flow delivered droplets of the aqueous precursor solution, containing titanium(IV) bis (ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (C6H22N2O8Ti) and sucrose (C12H22O11), into a quartz tube furnace at 900 °C. The resulting particles were microspheres with titania as shell and a composite of titania/carbon as yolk. Subsequent annealing in air at 600 °C converted the products to yolk@shell anatase titania microspheres. They reported that annealing in a mixture of air and hydrogen rather than pure air yielded TiO2−x microspheres with a yolk@shell morphology (Fig. 55i). These final products were applied for sodium storage in sodium-ion batteries with a high reversible capacity and significant long-term stability. In addition, the introduction of oxygen vacancies into anatase titania reduced the sodium ion insertion barrier, facilitated the diffusion kinetics of sodium cations, and enhanced electrical conductivity, which made the synthesized materials advantageous for sodium-ion battery applications.507
Kuai et al. employed spray pyrolysis to synthesize pristine titania and titania-supported palladium, with the Pd in the form of single atoms (Pd1), NPs (PdNPs), and a mixture of single atoms and NPs (Pd1+NPs) and tested their catalytic activity for room temperature ketone and aldehyde hydrogenation. In general, they used an aqueous precursor solution of tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(C4H9O)4), palladium nitrate (Pd(NO3)2), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and pluronic F-127 ((C3H6O·C2H4O)x) and sprayed it into a tube furnace at 600 °C. They calcined the products in air at 400 °C then washed them to obtain the final catalysts. To synthesize Pd1+NPs, they used more palladium nitrate than was used to make Pd1. To produce the PdNPs catalyst, they reduced the palladium nitrates to palladium NPs by flowing ultrahigh purity hydrogen through the precursor for 5 minutes at room temperature before using it in spray pyrolysis. They also synthesized mesoporous titania by the same process without adding palladium nitrate, as a basis for comparison of catalytic activity. They reported enhanced catalytic activity of Pd1+NPs\TiO2 compared to the TiO2, Pd1\TiO2, and PdNPs\TiO2 catalysts, which they attributed to the activation of CO groups by Pd1 sites and H2 dissociation on PdNPs.510
Konarava and Taniguchi combined ultrasonic spray pyrolysis with subsequent ball milling and heat treatment to create carbon-coated LiFePO4 particles. They thermally decomposed aqueous aerosol droplets containing lithium formate monohydrate (Li(HCOO)·H2O), iron chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in a tube furnace at 500 °C, then sintered the product particles at 600 °C, and performed ball milling followed by a secondary sintering at 500 °C, which produced the final carbon-coated products of relatively small size. They investigated the performance of the particles in lithium-ion battery applications and found that the carbon coated particles had superior rate capability and improved discharge capacity.497
Dunkle et al. synthesized nanostructured BiVO4 particles with unique morphologies from thin hollow and porous shells to ball-in-ball morphologies by a scalable ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique. The precursor solution, prepared by dissolving bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) in dilute nitric acid (HNO3), was atomized by a piezoceramic transducer at 1.65 MHz and carried by air into a tube furnace at 700 °C. They suggested that the primary formation of an oxide shell on the surface of small droplets followed by gas formation within the shell (from both solvent evaporation and precursor mixture decomposition) produced these unique morphologies. The synthesis mechanism and various morphologies of the BiVO4 particles are presented in Fig. 75. They investigated the oxygen evolution reaction photocatalysis activity of the nanostructured particles and compared it to the commercial BiVO4 and WO3, demonstrating enhanced photocatalytic activity for the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis synthesized BiVO4 probably because of the shorter diffusion length of electron–hole pairs to reach the shell surface.573

Huang et al. employed ultrasonic spray pyrolysis to generate porous spherical Bi2WO6 particles. To make the precursor solution, they first dissolved bismuth citrate (BiC6H5O7) and tungstic acid (H2WO4) separately in concentrated ammonia (NH3OH), then mixed them and, finally, diluted the solution with deionized water. The presence of citrate anions as capping agents along with in situ formation of carbon residues as temporary templates resulted in a porous morphology. They employed temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 °C and found a strong influence of temperature on the morphology. The porous particles were highly crystalline which produced fewer traps and resulted in superior photocatalytic activity for NO removal under both visible and simulated solar irradiation compared to bulk Bi2WO6.574
To address the drawbacks of using silicon NPs as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, such as large volume change during their alloying/dealloying reaction, Park et al. produced three-dimensional Si-CNT composite microspheres by spray pyrolysis and carbon-coated them using pitch as the carbon source, through a pitch infiltration process (Fig. 76). For spray pyrolysis, they dispersed silicon NPs along with polystyrene ((C8H8)n) nanobeads and acid-treated MWCNT in a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at 70 °C in distilled water and atomized the precursor with device using six 1.7 MHz transducers. Nitrogen carried the aerosol through a quartz tube furnace at 700 °C. After impregnation of pitch powder dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) ((CH2)4O) into the spray pyrolysis products, they performed a thermal treatment under argon for 3 hours at 900 °C to produce the final anode nanomaterials with excellent electrochemical properties arising from the stable adhesion of silicon NPs and carbon nanotube backbones, the stable SEI layer formed during cycling, and fast electron transport pathways. The resulting anode provided a high reversible discharge capacity of 1209 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles, which was much higher than the discharge capacity of 51 mA h g−1 obtained using Si-CNT nanocomposites synthesized by the same strategy, but without carbon-coating via pitch impregnation.504

Yang et al. synthesized CoTe2–C composite microspheres using spray pyrolysis. To make the precursor solution, they first dissolved tellurium oxide (TeO2) in nitric acid (HNO3) and then added water to yield a clear solution after 30 min stirring. Then, they added cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2), sucrose (C12H22O11), and a small amount of water. Aerosol droplets of the precursor were delivered in argon and hydrogen at a flow rate of 5 lpm and thermally decomposed in a tube furnace at 550 °C. Post-annealing at 300 °C under an argon/hydrogen atmosphere yielded CoTe2–C composite microspheres with uniform composition and CoTe2 as the only crystalline phase present. They applied these composite microspheres as an anode material for potassium-ion batteries, achieving a discharge capacity of 189.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Notably, they performed in situ and ex situ measurements to investigate the conversion reaction mechanism of the composite microspheres for potassium-ion storage and demonstrated a reversible reaction mechanism from the second cycle of the reaction of cobalt telluride with potassium ions.575
2.3.2.6. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Skrabalak and Suslick synthesized mesoporous carbon particles with pore sizes from 2 to 20 nm and macroporous carbon particles with pore sizes above 20 nm using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of various alkali metal chloroacetate salts, including lithium chloroacetate (C2H2ClLiO2), sodium chloroacetate (C2H2ClNaO2), potassium chloroacetate (C2H2ClKO2), lithium dichloroacetate (C2HCl2LiO2), sodium dichloroacetate (C2HCl2NaO2), and potassium dichloroacetate (C2HCl2KO2). These precursors can readily be decomposed to generate a highly-cross-linked carbon network by the in situ formation of inorganic salts that serve as temporary pore templates that were subsequently dissolved in water. Interestingly, these structurally similar precursors produced a variety of morphologies (Fig. 77). They considered four possible relevant processes upon heating aerosol droplets of this type of precursors including: (a) melting of the precursor, (b) electrochemical decomposition of the precursor to release alkali metal chloride, (c) endothermic decarboxylation of the precursor, and (d) melting of the alkali metal chloride part of the precursor. Based on this relative order and kinetics of these processes, the final morphologies were different for these precursors with similar structures. The generation of discrete atomized droplets limited the crystal growth and consolidation of alkali metal chloride in a manner governed by the precursor solution concentration and the residence time in the reaction zone. This facilitated better dispersion of alkali metal chloride throughout the network of growing carbon. The varied pore structures and surface area ranges of these mesoporous and macroporous carbon particles could make them appropriate for application as adsorbents and gas-storage materials.499

Jung et al. synthesized hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) with mesopores and macropores surrounded by outer micropores using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis of an aqueous precursor containing sucrose (C12H22O11) as the carbon source and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as a base catalyst for thermal decomposition of the carbon source. They used an ultrasonic atomizer with 6 droplet outlets and a frequency of 1.7 MHz and a tube furnace with a temperature of 800 °C for the thermal decomposition. Though the residence time of their system was only around 5 s, two distinct pore formation mechanisms were observed. The inner mesopore and macropore formation was meditated by water-soluble salt biproducts, while the generation of gases such as H2O, CO, and CO2 during the thermal decomposition of the carbon source or the removal of the sodium salt made from the chelated compound between the carbon source and the base catalyst or their complex led to the formation of the outer micropores. Adjusting the ratio of carbon source to base catalyst in the precursor solution played an important role in controlling the sizes of mesopores and macropores. They tested these particles for lithium–sulfur battery applications by incorporating sulfur in their structure, which enabled current delivery of 1412 mA h gsulfur−1 by the sulfur electrode along with outstanding capacity retention of 77% after 500 cycles.500
Kim et al. also employed spray pyrolysis to synthesize HPC without using heavy metal salts. They employed sodium chloride (NaCl) as the template to make the hierarchical porous nanomaterials, sucrose (C12H22O11) as the carbon source, and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as the catalyst for dehydrogenation of sucrose. They atomized the aqueous precursor solution and delivered it in nitrogen to a quartz tube furnace at 900 °C. They annealed the product particles for 3 hours under argon at 800 °C. To remove NaCl from the products, they washed them with distilled water, collected the product by filtration, and dried it under vacuum. A schematic of the synthesis mechanism of NaCl-activated carbon microspheres is presented in Fig. 78. They also generated carbon microspheres by the same strategy without adding NaCl. They applied the synthesized nanomaterials in electrical double-layer capacitors and found that HPC nanomaterials exhibited enhanced energy and power densities, while microporous carbon without the hierarchical structure did not perform well at high rate. A high specific surface area of 1704 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 1.81 cm3 g−1 resulted from interconnected micro/mesoporous network that provided ion transport channels with low ionic resistance and a short diffusion length. The HPC supercapacitor electrodes provided specific capacitance of 102 F g−1 at a high current density of 30 A g−1. Moreover, they provided capacity retention of 92% after 10000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1.501

Oh et al. produced hierarchical CNT-(NiCo)O/C with a yolk@shell morphology by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis as illustrated in Fig. 79. The aqueous precursor solution contained nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) as nickel precursor, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) as cobalt precursor, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) ((C6H9NO)n) as a polymeric agent, polystyrene ((C8H8)n) nanobeads as a template, and carbon nanotubes (CNT) as the core source. The tube furnace temperature was 700 °C. During thermal decomposition, the frame of the yolk with a link to CNTs was generated by mutual binding of the CNTs and polystyrene nanobeads followed by selective decomposition of the nanobeads. Phase separation of the nanobeads led to the generation of hollow shells. They investigated the electrochemical properties of the materials by testing them as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and found that the microspheres exhibited superior reversible discharge capacity due to their high electrical conductivity provided by their unique structure.503

2.3.2.7. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Wang et al. used laser diffraction measurements to study the effect of operating parameters including spray volume rate, carrier gas flow rate, precursor temperature, and physicochemical properties of precursors in detail on the aerosol size distribution and the average size of aerosol droplets made by an ultrasonic generator with a frequency of 1.7 MHz. They used nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and zirconyl nitrate dihydrate (ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O) dissolved in water or ethanol, or the solvents alone, as prototype precursor solutions in a recirculating, temperature-controlled precursor delivery system. They found that increasing the precursor temperature and concentration along with addition of ethanol decreased the average size of aerosol droplets, while increasing the flow rate of carrier gas and the volume rate of spray not only increased the average size of aerosol droplets, but also produced a bimodal aerosol size distribution that they attributed to the onset of coagulation. In addition, they found critical values of viscosity for atomization and of aerosol droplet number concentration for coagulation, which were 2 (mN s) m−2 and 3 × 1012 droplets per m3, respectively. They then used a T-type impactor and a cyclone to remove the larger droplets and control the size distribution and average size of aerosol droplets. They introduced the precursors into a vertical tube furnace with five separately heated zones at 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C to expand their investigation on the size distribution of the NPs from ultrasonic spray pyrolysis and found significant influence of the aerosol droplet size characteristics that correlated well with expectations based on droplet-to-particle conversion.523
Zhao et al. employed spray pyrolysis to synthesize zinc oxide NPs with average sizes ranging from 20 to 30 nm from an aqueous solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O). They studied the thermal decomposition of the zinc precursor using differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and found that water was removed from the zinc precursor at temperatures below 200 °C, the anhydrous precursor melted in the range of 210 °C to 250 °C, and fully decomposed into zinc oxide at approximately 400 °C. They investigated the decomposition mechanism of the anhydrous precursor and inferred that a random nucleation mechanism best matched their observations. In addition, they developed a random nucleation model for the synthesis which was able to predict the morphology of the NPs and describe the influence of the reaction temperature on the properties of the NPs.576
Lenggoro et al. employed a temperature-graded laminar flow spray pyrolysis reactor to synthesize zirconia NPs by thermal decomposition of zirconyl hydroxide chloride (ZrO(OH)Cl). They developed a model of droplet evaporation and precursor precipitation, then employed both experimental and numerical methods to investigate the effects of the operating parameters on the morphology of the synthesized NPs. They found that solid dense NPs were generated at low reactor temperature or with a gradual increase in reaction temperature along the reactor, high concentration of precursor solution, and low carrier gas flow rate. Based upon the simulation results, they found that the low number concentration of aerosol droplets and large aerosol droplets favored the synthesis of hollow NPs. Beyond rationalizing these expected trends, they were able show how solute concentration profiles within droplets that cross the equilibrium solubility limit (above it at the surface, below it in the center) lead to formation of hollow particles.558
Eslamian et al. also developed a mathematical model to predict the morphology of NPs synthesized in a spray pyrolysis reactor. Their model considered non-continuum effects on the evaporation of the aerosol droplets by combining the continuum based governing equations with an interpolation formula developed from a numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for the transition regime. These non-continuum effects were found to be significant for evaporation of submicron aerosol droplets at ambient pressure. They considered the thermal decomposition of zirconyl hydroxide chloride (ZrO(OH)Cl) to produce zirconia NPs as a case study and found that for high reactor temperatures, near 400 °C, the NPs had a hollow morphology due to the evaporation rate exceeding the rate of diffusion of precursor within the aerosol droplets, which produced steep intradroplet concentration gradients. Moreover, they found that decreasing the pressure below 250 Torr, or decreasing the size of aerosol droplets from several microns to sub-microns favored the synthesis of NPs with a solid dense morphology due to a decrease in evaporation rate as non-continuum effects became more important. In addition, they reported that increasing the temperature of the reactor increased the size of product NPs, while reactor temperatures below 200 °C facilitated the synthesis of smaller dense NPs. They also investigated the effects of reactor temperature and pressure, and the initial concentration of the precursor solution and found that the normalized size of NPs and the wall thickness are not substantially affected by the reactor pressure, but absolute wall thickness did change with pressure. Notably, the initial concentration of the precursor solution had a weak effect on the wall thickness of NPs.577
Emil et al. performed an experimental and theoretical study to regulate the morphology of zinc oxide NPs synthesized by spray pyrolysis of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O). They investigated the effects of operating parameters such as the precursor concentration, carrier gas flow rate, and reaction temperature on the morphologies of the synthesized NPs. Based on the experimental and modelling results, they found that various morphologies from spherical NPs to sphere-like structures assembled from nanoplates and interwoven nanoplates were attainable by operating the spray pyrolysis system under appropriate conditions. Notably, they performed a precise crystallographic study on the zinc oxide NPs with unique planar morphology through XRD and Williamson–Hall analysis.578
Among three main steps in the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique, including the generation of aerosol droplets by the nebulizer, delivery of the aerosol droplets into the reaction zone, and the coupled physicochemical processes in the reaction zone, Muñoz et al. focused on the first step. They performed experimental and theoretical studies to relate the precursor properties to the distribution of aerosol droplet sizes. They were interested in hexamethyldisilazane ([(CH3)3Si]2NH) as a precursor for Si/C/N nanocomposites, and therefore studied droplet formation from water, ethanol, and water/methanol mixtures with properties similar to hexamethyldisilazane. The aerosol droplet distribution was determined by a shadowgraphy analysis, which revealed a bimodal size distribution of aerosol droplets. Moreover, they concluded that partial evaporation of the smallest aerosol droplets and the possible coalescence of some aerosol droplets during their delivery to the furnace, because of the flow deflection, resulted in evolution of the aerosol droplet size distribution downstream of the ultrasonic nebulizer. Finally, they tested and improved correlations for prediction of droplet size in from ultrasonic nebulization.579
Kastrinaki et al. investigated the effects of various operating parameters including reaction temperature, flow rate, carrier gas, post-calcination temperature, and characteristics of the precursor solution including concentration, chemistry, type of precursor, and type of solvent on the morphology, crystallinity, average size, and iron oxidation state of iron- and iron oxide-based NPs synthesized by spray pyrolysis. Iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), and a water-dispersible gel derived from a steel industry byproduct were employed as precursors. Aqueous solutions of iron chloride and iron nitrate were sprayed at four concentrations. Using iron nitrate as the precursor led to spherical NPs, while the chloride precursor produced irregularly shaped NPs. They suggested that the effect of the vapor pressure of precursors on the surface evaporation at the single-droplet level led to the observed difference in morphology. Moreover, they found that higher flow rates of the carrier gas yielded hollow NPs, while a solid dense morphology was achieved at lower flow rates that allowed slower solvent evaporation. They employed models from the literature to calculate the size of NPs and online measurement at the outlet of the reactor to find the average size of NPs experimentally. They reported that the solubility of the precursor plays a significant role in the average size of NPs; precursors with low solubility favored the synthesis of larger NPs with a hollow morphology. Furthermore, they found that addition of ethanol to the precursor generated a shell of carbon and/or iron carbide on the iron oxide core NPs. In addition, the oxidation state of the NPs could be tuned by adjusting the composition of spraying and post-calcination gas. Post-calcination under hydrogen at 400 °C followed by cooling to ambient conditions under hydrogen produced metallic iron particles. Notably, employing the dispersible gel derived from a steel company byproduct as the precursor, in a solvent mixture of ethanol and water, favored the formation of iron NPs with amorphous iron oxide and carbon passivation layers.580
Chellali et al. used APT to investigate the distribution of constituent elements in high entropy oxides (HEOs) at the atomic scale. They synthesized three classes of HEOs by spray pyrolysis, including (Co0.2Cu0.2Mg0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)O as a transition metal based HEO, (Ce0.2La0.2Pr0.2Sm0.2Y0.2)O2−δ as a rare earth based HEO, and (Gd0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Y0.2)(Co0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Ni0.2)O3 as a perovskite HEO with rocksalt, fluorite, and orthorhombic type crystalline structures, respectively. They compacted the as-synthesized NPs under high pressure (6 GPa) to make pellets and found that all three classes of HEOs retained their phase-purity even after compaction. In conventional APT, the samples are prepared by high temperature sintering which is problematic because of temperature mediated phase transitions. The high-pressure compaction route was advantageous to solve this problem. Using this technique, they were able to demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of the cations at the atomic level in all the three classes of HEO systems.575 This paper is most notable for its application of APT to aerosol synthesized materials, which demonstrated the potential of aerosol methods to produce such complex materials with uniform elemental distribution.


2.3.3. Flame-based aerosol synthesis. 
In flame-based synthesis methods, chemical energy is converted to thermal energy in the flame. Like laser and plasma methods, this initially heats only the gas phase, and does not require heat conduction from the surroundings, which enables much faster heating and cooling rates than in CVC or spray pyrolysis. Generally, easy synthesis of simple oxides at short residence times, demonstrated scale up for oxide nanomaterials, simple and relatively inexpensive equipment, and high purity are advantages of flame synthesis, while hard agglomeration, broad particle size distribution, non-uniform temperature and velocity profiles, and difficulty in producing non-oxide materials are disadvantages of the flame-based synthesis methods.175 In general, flame-based aerosol synthesis methods are classified as Vapor-fed Aerosol Flame Synthesis (VAFS) methods and Liquid-fed Aerosol Flame Synthesis (LAFS) methods, as discussed in the following paragraphs.581
VAFS typically involves the combustion of a low-cost volatile metal precursor, such as a metal chloride or metal alkoxide, which is supplied as a vapor. VAFS can use a hydrocarbon, hydrogen, or halide flame. Decomposition of precursors into reactive fragments or atoms induces homogeneous nucleation from the gas phase and the formation of particles. Thereafter, the particles grow by surface reaction, coagulation, and coalescence into larger particles.175,581,582 Simple oxides like Al2O3,583,584 SiO2,583–585 TiO2,583–586 GeO2,584 Fe2O3,584 ZrO2,584 and V2O5,584 carbon-coated oxides like SiO2/C,587 and TiO2/C,588 and noble metal/metal oxide composites including Pt/TiO2,589 and Cu/ZnO/Al2O3590 are examples of nanomaterials that can be synthesized by VAFS methods. Advantages of VAFS methods are that no solvent is needed for the precursor, and they are relatively easy to operate and scale up. The main drawback of VAFS methods is the limited availability of volatile precursors at reasonable cost.581
The use of non-volatile precursors in LAFS methods endows them with more versatility than VAFS methods to produce NPs of a wide variety of materials. In these approaches, a liquid precursor solution, emulsion, or slurry is sprayed into a flame. If the precursor evaporates completely, the formation mechanism of nanomaterials is similar to that in VAFS methods. Otherwise, hollow, shell-like, and micron-sized particles will be produced by droplet-to-particle conversion in the flame.
Based on the combustion conditions, LAFS methods are divided into two subgroups: Flame Assisted Spray Pyrolysis (FASP) and Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP).581 When the solution of inorganic precursor has a low combustion enthalpy content (less than 50% of total combustion energy), or is endothermic in nature (typically an aqueous solution) an external flame, which is usually an oxy-hydrogen or oxy-hydrocarbon flame, is required because the precursor itself cannot produce a self-sustaining flame. Such a process is called Flame Assisted Spray Pyrolysis (FASP).581,582 TiO2,591 ZnO,592 BaTiO3,593 SrMnO3,594 NiMn2O3,594 La1−xCexCoO3,595 La(Co, Mn, Fe)O3,596,597 Eu3+ doped Y2O3,598–602 and Eu2+ doped BaMgAl10O17603,604 have been synthesized by this approach. Advantages of FASP include the ability to use aqueous solutions of low-cost metal nitrates and sulfates as precursors and the ability to produce NPs of complex composition (containing 3 or more metals). The tendency to produce submicron particles with inhomogeneous size and morphology, at relatively low yield, because of insufficient energy available to form metal vapor, can be considered the major disadvantage of FASP.582
When the solution of organic precursor, also in liquid form, has a high combustion enthalpy content (higher than 50% of total combustion energy) only a small pilot flame is required to initiate and sustain the spray combustion. This process is called flame spray pyrolysis (FSP).581,582 FSP is the newest flame-based synthesis method and it has a great number of advantages. Employing a self-sustaining flame, using fewer volatile precursors, achieving high flame temperature with large temperature gradients (heating and cooling rates), and the ability to scale up its production rate are some advantages of the method. Its products have applications in areas such as catalysis, optics and photonics, medicine, and fuel cells.582 MgAl2O4,605 Al2O3,606 Mn2O3,606 ZrO2,606–609 Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2,606 Ta2O5,610 Y3Al5O12,611 BaCO3,612 Fe2O3,613,614 SiO2,615 Pt/SnO2,616 Au/TiO2,617 Pt/Ba/Al2O3,618 and Pt/Ba/CexZr1−xO2619 are some of the nanomaterials that have been synthesized by this method. The limited NP compositions, mainly metal oxides, that can be produced under open flames in ambient conditions is the major disadvantage of FSP.620

2.3.3.1. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Flame-based aerosol technology has a long history and was employed even in prehistoric times.621 Flame-based production of carbon black, first by the lampblack process, then by the channel black process, and later by the furnace black process has been a commercial enterprise for centuries.622 Unwanted soot formation has long been a topic of interest as well. Nevertheless, Bonne, Homann, Grewer and Wagner can be considered pioneers of the scientific understanding of this field for using a novel approach to studying formation of carbon NPs in premixed flat flames.623,624 A schematic of their flame reactor is shown in Fig. 81. They employed flat flames burning on cooled porous plate burners at pressures of 10 to 60 Torr. The flames used oxygen as the oxidant with fuels such as methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), propane (C3H8), benzene (C6H6), ethanol (C2H5OH), and a mixture of carbon disulfide and hydrogen (CS2:H2). Liquid fuels were vaporized by a flow of nitrogen, while the gases directly came from cylinders. They used a sensitive mass spectrometer to monitor stable products, free radicals, and other short-lived species to find the concentration profiles of carbon-containing species before and during the production of carbon NPs (soot). A quartz probe was directly connected to the ion source of a mass spectrometer to take samples. A stream of gas from the flame was extracted into the mass spectrometer through a 100 μm hole in the probe under critical flow conditions. High-speed pumping behind the probe expanded the entering beam rapidly. They minimized the wall influence on the NPs arriving at the mass spectrometer using a slit at the middle of the beam to allow only the center portion of the stream of NPs to enter the mass spectrometer. Using this approach, they found that the formation of polyacetylenes was the key factor in the formation of carbon NPs. The polyacetylenes reached a maximum concentration early in the reaction zone and approached a constant final value in the burned gas, which increased with increasing fuel content. A short distance behind the oxidation zone, particles with a diameter near 4 nm could be collected and imaged by electron microscopy. The agglomeration of the ultrafine particles along with the addition of high polyacetylenes and polyacetylene radicals, in the region where the concentration of the polyacetylenes decreased, led to an increase in the size and decrease in the number density of carbon NPs. Finally, radicals were converted to the final products and the amount of carbon NPs, the average size of NPs and the particle number remained constant, while acetylene and polyacetylenes remained at relatively high concentration in the final products.623,624 The study of soot formation has since grown into an entire scientific field of its own, which has many aspects in common with vapor-phase synthesis of other nanomaterials, but also many unique features. Thus, we do not review soot formation in detail here, but refer the reader to several classic and more recent reviews. We do include some discussions of soot modelling in later subsections, because of the direct relevance to modelling of aerosol dynamics of particle synthesis.625,626

Chung and Katz developed a rectangular counterflow diffusion flame burner for the synthesis of silica NPs from silane (SiH4). A schematic of their synthesis set-up is presented in Fig. 82. The burner consisted of two opposing vertical conduits of rectangular cross-section, from which fuel and oxidant flowed, meeting in a stagnation plane. The fuel and the oxidant were hydrogen and oxygen, both diluted in argon. The fuel flowed upward, while the oxidant flowed downward and combustion products flowed outward. Stainless-steel plates with a thickness of 40 μm divided each tube into three channels: two side channels with dimensions of 12.70 mm × 6.35 mm and a central main channel with dimensions of 12.70 mm × 63.50 mm. To force the combustion gases to exit only via the long sides, they fitted fused silica plates to the outside of the two side channels. A bed of glass beads, several fiberglass layers, a perforated plate, and three stainless-steel 40 mesh wire screens were employed to create a uniform gas flow across the burner outlets. To seal the system and maintain the flow of outward gas parallel to the surfaces of the burner, they fitted flanges on each side of the burner openings. As a result, the produced flame was stable, flat, and rectangular in shape. The concentrations and the temperatures were uniform across the horizontal plane. The flame color was light blue before the addition of silane into the fuel and it changed to a whitish light yellow after the addition of silane. The flame brightness increased with increasing silane flow rate. Upon addition of 9.3 sccm of silane, a second thin orange flame appeared on the fuel side of the H2–O2 flame zone. There was a dark space between the two flames which corresponded to an intense peak in light scattering. In addition, they found that homogeneous nucleation occurred to produce a high particle concentration upon injection of silane at a flow rate beyond a critical value of 2.3 sccm.641 Hung and Katz employed this system to produce crystalline rutile titania NPs coated with an amorphous layer of silica, which were promising for catalysis applications. For this, titanium tetrachloride and silicon tetrachloride were decomposed in hydrogen–oxygen flames. Moreover, they studied the effect of the flame temperature and silicon to titanium precursor ratio on the morphology of the nanocomposites, finding that flame temperature had the greatest effect on the morphology. Titania NPs were encapsulated by silica at low temperatures and high silicon to titanium ratios, while discrete silica particles covered the titania NPs at high temperatures and low silicon to titanium ratios (Fig. 83).651

Hurd and Flower studied the structure of flame-made silica NPs by in situ static and dynamic light scattering and ex situ TEM imaging. Liquid hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2), methane, and oxygen were the silicon precursor, fuel, and oxidant, respectively. Growth and aggregation of the particles evolved with position in the flame. Based on scattering measurements, the fractal dimension of the aggregates was about 1.49, although it could not be determined precisely. Based on the dynamic light scattering results for polydispersity, they found that the growth trend did not match expectations for an aggregation-condensation process in the free-molecular regime. TEM results surprisingly showed evidence of silica clusters shrinking with increasing residence time in the flame (height above the burner).642 Zachariah et al. further studied the synthesis of silica NPs using a counterflow diffusion flame reactor with silane as the silicon precursor and an argon-diluted hydrogen–oxygen flame. They studied the effect of temperature, silane loading, equivalence, and momentum ratios on the process and found that flame temperature was the most important factor. At temperatures of around 2000 K, they observed surface growth of initial nuclei, while increasing the flame temperature led to smaller particles in higher number concentration. In addition, they observed that faster reaction at higher temperatures of around 2500 K led to the nucleation of other particle compositions rather than SiO2, which could grow by subsequent silica deposition. Moreover, spherical particles were produced at sufficiently high temperatures due to sintering. Furthermore, they observed that silane loading affected the average particle size along with the growth regime. Higher silane loadings accelerated the nucleation of particles, producing larger particles via surface growth processes. They concluded that they could control the final product morphology and the process yield by adjusting the processing parameters.643 In another study, they synthesized SiO2/TiO2 nanocomposites by decomposing three different sets of precursors in CH4:O2 flames. Combinations of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), silicon tetrabromide (SiBr4), or hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2) were used as precursors. The average size of SiO2/TiO2 nanocomposites was 15 nm. In addition, they produced silica NPs with an average size of 10 nm using the three different precursors and titania NPs with an average size of 13 nm. They found the size of single component silica NPs and the species distribution in the nanocomposites were independent of the silicon precursor.652 They synthesized binary SiO2/Fe2O3 NPs in addition to binary SiO2/TiO2 NPs with diameters below 100 nm and various molar ratios of titanium or iron to silicon using the same system. They observed segregation in the particles comparable to that expected based on equilibrium phase behavior of the systems at the flame temperature. The species distribution in the binary NPs was in qualitative agreement with the expected distribution from the phase diagrams at the flame temperature, demonstrating the utility of phase diagrams for predicting behaviour in this system. The phase diagrams predicted the segregation in the SiO2/TiO2 system better than the SiO2/Fe2O3 system. They suggested that the thermodynamics and differences in the ability of Ti4+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ to replace Si4+ in the silica network were the causes of the differences in the SiO2/TiO2 and SiO2/Fe2O3 systems.653
Almquist and Biswas investigated the effect of particle size on the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs. They produced anatase titania NPs with average sizes of 5 to 48 nm by thermal decomposition of titanium tetraisopropoxide in methane flames with oxygen and air. They also calcined commercially available titania NPs at temperatures in the range of 170 to 700 °C to increase their effective particle size, and tested conventional TiO2 powders (DeGussa P25, and TiO2 from Aldrich) to span an effective size range from 5 to 165 nm. They tested activity for photodegradation of phenol in water and found that particle size played a substantial role in the apparent photocatalytic activity of the titania NPs, particularly for effective particle sizes below 30 nm. In that range, an increase in the particle size led to a significant increase in apparent photocatalytic activity, probably because of the substantial particle size dependence of the efficiency of light absorption and charge-carrier dynamics in NPs with sizes in this range. Based on this dependence, they concluded that the optimum effective particle size was in the range of 25 to 40 nm. The available surface area for redox reactions played a more important role in the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs for effective particle sizes above 30 nm. Accordingly, increasing the particle size beyond 30 nm led to a decrease in the apparent photocatalytic activity.656
Sahu and Biswas employed a single-step flame aerosol technique to synthesize copper-doped titania NPs. Titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) was the host precursor and copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) was the dopant precursor in a methane-oxygen flame. Increasing the doping level led to conversion of anatase TiO2 to the rutile crystalline phase (Fig. 84a) due to substitution of Ti4+ by Cu2+ in the crystal structure of titania, as well as a decrease in the size of primary NPs and their crystallinity (Fig. 84b), and the improved dispersibility due to charging. Increasing the copper doping content to 15 wt% shifted the maximum absorption wavelength to the visible region. Furthermore, they annealed titania NPs doped with 1 and 15 wt% copper at temperatures of 400 and 600 °C in air, which increased the crystallinity of the NPs and transformed their spherical morphology to a hexagonal structure.672

Fotou et al. investigated the photocatalytic activity of titania NPs synthesized by a flame-based approach. They used titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as the source of titanium and decomposed it in CH4-air flames. To generate pure crystalline anatase titania NPs with a high specific surface area of 110 m2 g−1, they used 277 sccm of methane as the fuel and 2314 sccm of air as the oxidant which produced a flame temperature of 1440 K. They provided 1.4 mol min−1 of TiCl4 as the precursor which led to a residence time in the flame of about 75 ms. They measured photodegradation of phenol in water under UV-irradiation using the flame-synthesized titania NPs and found that they produced even better results than commercial titania. To enhance the photocatalytic activity of the titania NPs, they performed in situ doping with silica via simultaneous decomposition of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4).657 They later expanded their investigations of the doping of titanium NPs using the same system. In this study, titania NPs were doped with alumina and tin oxide, in addition to silica, using metal chloride precursors. They found that doping with silica decreased the sintering rate of titania as well as the primary particle size, while doping with tin oxide did not have any effect on the primary particle size (Fig. 85). However, it led to conversion of the anatase crystalline phase to rutile because of the similarity of the crystal structure of tin oxide and rutile titania. Using alumina as the dopant also promoted conversion from anatase to rutile via generation of excess oxygen vacancies in the titania-alumina solid solution668 Pratsinis's group also produced V2O5–TiO2 NPs from titanium(IV) alkoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) and vanadium(V) alkoxide (VO[OCH(CH3)2]3) precursors in a CH4:O2 flame. They tested the catalytic activity of the NPs for selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3. They could control the specific surface area of the NPs in the range of 23 to 120 m2 g−1 by adjusting the oxygen flow to the flame. In addition, they observed a homogeneous dispersion of vanadia on the surface of spherical titania. Moreover, they concluded that the submonolayer amount of vanadia loaded on the titania NPs played a substantial role in the catalytic activity, so that increasing it from 2.5 to 7 μmol m−2 improved the catalytic activity by a factor of 30 per vanadium site. They reported that 10 μmol m−2 loading of vanadia on the surface of titania led to less than 1% N2O production up to 350 °C, illustrating the high activity of the NPs. Also, there was no substantial amount of vanadia within the titania lattice. Despite containing minimal porosity at high specific surface area compared to the conventionally-synthesized catalysts, the flame-synthesized titania-vanadia NPs exhibited selective catalytic activity matching the best results obtained from catalysts produced by conventional methods. They investigated the effect of silica addition to the NPs by adding hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2) to the precursor and found that it led to a decrease in the overall activity by covering part of the titania surface.671

Inturi et al. synthesized transition metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, V, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ce, Y, and Zr) doped titania NPs by a single-step liquid flame aerosol synthesis method with a premixed methane-oxygen flame. The titanium precursor was titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) and the solvent was a mixture of o-xylene (C8H10) and acetonitrile (C2H3N). They used chromium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate (C24H45CrO6), vanadium(V) oxytriisopropoxide (C9H24O4V), iron(III) naphthenate (C22H14O4Fe), manganese(III) naphthenate (C22H14MnO4), nickel(III) naphthenate (C22H14NiO4), copper(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (C8H15CuO2), cobalt 2-ethylhexanoate (C8H15CoO2), molybdenum 2-ethylhexanoate (C32H60MnO8), zirconyl 2-ethylhexanoate (C32H60O8Zr), and yttrium(III) naphthenate (C33H21O6Y) as the metal precursors. They tested the photocatalytic activity of the doped NPs for degradation of acetonitrile in the gas phase under visible light irradiation at ambient pressure and temperature. They observed generation of metal–O–Ti bonds for all synthesized nanomaterials which demonstrated the strong interaction of the dopants with the host in all cases. They reported that the Ti3+ content in the Cr-doped TiO2 was much higher than in the other doped titania nanomaterials which enhanced visible light-induced photocatalytic activity due to band gap narrowing induced by Ti3+ species. Accordingly, the Cr-doped TiO2 had the best photocatalytic activity, which was around 8 to 19 times that of the other nanomaterials. Among all the doped titania NPs, only doping with Cr, Fe, and V (in this order) improved the photocatalytic activity of the titania NPs via reduction of its bandgap energy.667
Boningari et al. used a single-step flame-based approach to prepare sulfur-doped titania NPs. The key point in this synthesis was the preproduction of an unconventional precursor, titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO4). To make the precursor, titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) was added to water, and the resulting precipitate was dissolved with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to generate a clear solution, to which they then added ethanol (C2H5OH) as a fuel. Sulfur doping of titania NPs not only caused conversion of anatase to the rutile phase, but also enhanced the absorption of the visible light and reduced the band gap energy to 2.78 eV. They found that S4+ and S6+ were the main oxidation states of the sulfur atoms doped into the titania. High S6+ content improved the photocatalytic activity under visible light so that the doped NPs synthesized with 2 M H2SO4 with a S6+/S4+ ratio of 5.61 exhibited the best visible light photocatalytic activity. Because of their excellent activity for photocatalytic destruction of acetaldehyde under visible light, sulfur-doped titania NPs can be considered promising candidates for water purification applications.670 The same group investigated the photocatalytic activity (through visible light degradation of phenol) of flame-synthesized nitrogen-doped titania NPs produced by the same strategy. They added titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) to dilute nitric acid (HNO3), with ethanol (C2H5OH) and urea (CH4N2O) to create a clear miscible precursor solution. They thermally decomposed the precursor solution in a CH4–O2 flame. The nitrogen doped into the crystal lattice of titania was mainly interstitial nitrogen (Ti–O–N) rather than substitutional nitrogen (Ti–N) which was beneficial for narrowing the TiO2 band gap from 3.15 to about 2.51 eV. This modification of the bandgap structure and suppression of photogenerated electron–hole recombination due to interstitial nitrogen enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.664 Furthermore, they reported that the band gap energy could be monotonically reduced by increasing the amount of urea (CH4N2O) as a secondary nitrogen source, while it was not affected by increasing the primary nitrogen source (HNO3).665
Huo et al. synthesized Ti3+ self-doped titania NPs with sizes of 20 to 40 nm via in situ surface hydrogenation in a novel single-step flame-based aerosol synthesis technique. In their system (Fig. 86), the chemical reaction section was composed of a hydrogen–oxygen diffusion nozzle to generate the flame and a stainless-steel pipe ring with a diameter of 10 mm and 16 uniformly distributed holes of 1 mm diameter placed immediately above the nozzle. This pipe ring was used for hydrogenation of titania. The precursor was titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). Ti3+ ions were formed near the surface of titania NPs with a relative content of about 8%. The morphology of the NPs was controlled by adjusting the precursor feed rate, while modifying the concentration of Ti3+ ions in the titania NPs was possible by adjusting the hydrogen flow. The hydrogenation and subsequent formation of Ti3+ ions created a disordered surface layer by altering the lattice spacing from that of the bulk material. The Ti3+ self-doping of titania NPs improved photocatalytic properties like photocurrent density and visible-light degradation of methylene blue due to enhanced visible light absorption and suppression of charge recombination.666

Akurati et al. synthesized WO3/TiO2 nanocomposites from titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) dissolved in ethanol (C2H5OH) and ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6H2W12O40·xH2O) dissolved in dimethyl formamide (C3H7NO) in an acetylene-oxygen flame. They found that increasing the concentration of WO3 changed the WOx species coordination from tetrahedral to octahedral. For samples with up to 3.6 mol% WO3, unsaturated wolframyl species were dispersed on the surface of titania NPs, increasing the surface acidity. For samples with higher WO3 content, crystalline WO3 domains appeared. The residence time of the particles in the flame at high temperature, which influenced the surface species type and the surface acidity, could be controlled by adjusting the oxygen-to-fuel ratio of the reactants. Activity of the flame-synthesized nanocomposites with up to 3.6 wt% WO3 for photodegradation of methylene blue was enhanced relative to commercially available TiO2 due to higher surface acidity and better charge separation. In these materials, WO3 formed an amorphous surface layer. Crystalline WO3 in nanocomposites with higher WO3 content produced poor photocatalytic performance even though adsorption of methylene blue increased.678
Fujiwara et al. investigated the photocatalytic activity of flame-made palladium cluster-decorated titania NPs for NO destruction under solar light. They dissolved the precursor mixture of titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) and palladium acetylacetonate (C10H14O4Pd) in mixtures of acetonitrile (C2H3N) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (C8H16O2) and decomposed this precursor in a methane-oxygen flame. They observed palladium clusters below 1 nm in size with intermediate palladium oxidation state between metallic Pd and PdO and high air-stability up to at least 600 °C for 2 hours, although annealing for 2 hours in nitrogen at 400 °C led to partial reduction to metallic palladium with sizes exceeding 1 nm. They found that the flame-made titania NPs with or without 1% doping with palladium clusters performed 3 to 7 times better than commercially available titania NPs for the removal of NOx under solar illumination. Moreover, they observed that the palladium nanoclusters on the surface of titania interacted with oxygen defects which suppressed the adsorption of CO on palladium.675
Lin et al. employed flame spray pyrolysis to synthesize Pt/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2–Vo (Vo: oxygen vacancy) using in situ hydrogenation and tested their photocatalytic activity in gas-phase CO2 reduction. Their synthesis set-up is presented in Fig. 87. They used a bubbler to vaporize titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) at 90 °C with nitrogen as the bubbling gas. The evaporated precursor was mixed with O2 and delivered through the central port of a burner into a flame of premixed oxygen and methane introduced through the outer ports of the burner. To load platinum, a precursor solution of platinum acetylacetonate (C10H14O4Pt) in a mixture of xylene (C8H10) and acetonitrile (C2H3N) was atomized and carried by nitrogen into the reaction zone. For in situ hydrogenation, a hydrogen flow was added through a ring with 16 orifices introduced at a point above the flame where the temperature was ∼700 °C. Upon comparing photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and TiO2–Vo, they found that the activity of Pt/TiO2–Vo (141 μmol (gcatalyst h)−1) was 1.9 times that of Pt/TiO2, 2.4 times that of TiO2–Vo, and 13.8 times that of commercial titania. Addition of platinum led to formation of methane on both the Pt/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2–Vo with methane selectivities of 70 and 81%, respectively and a quantum yield of 1.49% for Pt/TiO2–Vo. In addition, they investigated the effect of strong electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) in Pt/TiO2–Vo for CO2 photoreduction and reported that EMSI allowed electron transfer from TiO2–Vo to platinum NPs which increased the electron density on the surface of platinum NPs, which enhanced their photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction and increased their methane selectivity. Moreover, the EMSI slowed catalyst deactivation, reducing the gradual loss of Pt0 and oxygen vacancies during 8 hours of photoreduction. In contrast, rapid deactivation was observed for both Pt/TiO2 and TiO2–Vo.679

In a paper focused on TGA analysis, Mueller et al. compared the purity (carbon content) and –OH surface density of titania and silica NPs synthesized by a flame-based approach with those of NPs synthesized by a sol–gel method. While sol–gel prepared particles had varying levels of carbon contamination depending on preparation conditions, only water desorbed from the flame-made samples. This allowed quantification of the –OH surface coverage of flame-made samples by TGA alone.646
2.3.3.3. Ceramic oxides. 
Mädler and Pratsinis employed a flame-based pyrolysis technique to produce pure, homogeneous, and tetragonal crystalline β-Bi2O3 NPs with controlled size and crystallinity with specific surface areas of 20 to 80 m2 g−1 at production rates of 6 to 46 g h−1. Bismuth(II) nitrate heptahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was the solid precursor, which was dissolved in two different solvents. Using a mixture of nitric acid and ethanol as solvent produced a combination of sintered dense spherical NPs with average diameters between 50 to 100 nm and aggregates of primary particles with mean diameters of 10 nm, along with hollow particles of approximately 1 μm diameter, produced by a droplet-to-particle conversion mechanism (Fig. 88a). In contrast use of acetic acid led as solvent produced solid NPs by a gas-to-particle conversion mechanism due to the generation of an acetobismuth complex that evaporated before decomposing (Fig. 88b). They investigated the effect of acetic acid to ethanol ratio to elucidate the solvent influence on the process and found that increasing this ratio led to an increase in the crystallinity and the homogeneity of the NPs. Only nanograined particles were formed for acetic acid fractions above 0.6. In addition, they reported that using bismuth acetate instead of bismuth nitrate produced the same NPs, illustrating that the ion composition in the precursor solution is more important than the precursor itself. They increased the specific surface area of the NPs from 20 to 80 m2 g−1 by increasing the flow rate of oxygen dispersion gas and decreasing the feed rate of the precursor.725 Pratsinis's group employed the same process to generate monocrystalline zinc oxide NPs. The zinc oxide primary particles were smaller and more homogeneous than the zinc oxide primary particles synthesized by other techniques. Zinc acrylate (C6H6O4Zn) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and acetic acid for use as a precursor. By adjusting the feed rate of the precursor solution, they controlled the mean primary particle diameter in the range of 10 to 20 nm. Increasing the feed rate of precursor solution increased the flame height and consequently enhanced coalescence and/or surface growth which increased the mean primary particle diameter. Fig. 89 shows the morphologies of the flame-synthesized ZnO nanomaterials produced at different precursor feed rates.692 Moreover, they synthesized zinc oxide nanorods doped with tin and indium by this scalable flame-based aerosol technique. In this case, the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc naphthenate (C22H14O4Zn) in toluene (C7H8) and stannous 2-ethylhexanoate (C16H30O4Sn) in tetrahydrofuran ((CH2)4O) for tin-doping, or indium acetylacetonate (C15H21O6In) for indium-doping. The doping level was up to 10 at%. These two dopants selectively passivate specific zinc oxide crystal planes and were incorporated into its lattice. Increasing the doping concentration led to an increase in the specific surface area of the NPs and this increase was sharper for doping with tin than with indium. In addition, doping with tin affected the synthesis of nanorods more than doping with indium at low dopant levels. They attributed growth of nanorods to the higher valency and coordination of tin and indium as dopants compared to zinc, which disrupted growth in particular lattice directions. Moreover, they doped zinc oxide with lithium using lithium acetylacetonate (C5H7O2Li) or lithium tert-butoxide (C4H9OLi) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. They observed that doping with lithium, which has an equivalent ionic radius to tin and indium, but a valency lower than zinc, did not affect the zinc oxide texture, supporting their hypothesis about the effect of higher valency of the dopants on the formation of nanorods. Fig. 90 presents the morphologies of the zinc oxide nanomaterials containing 4 at% of each dopant.696

Pawinrat et al. synthesized Au–ZnO and Pt–ZnO nanocomposites by a single-step flame-based aerosol pyrolysis technique. For Au–ZnO nanocomposites, they used zinc naphthenate (C22H14O4Zn) and gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) dissolved in ethanol (C2H5OH). They used platinum acetylacetonate (C10H16O4Pt) in a mixture of xylene (C8H10) and acetonitrile (C2H3N) with zinc napthenate for the synthesis of Pt–ZnO. They found that zinc oxide is produced first, followed by metallic gold or platinum. The mean size of the metal particles was 3 to 7 nm, which was affected by metal loading (1 or 3%), while the ZnO particles were roughly an order of magnitude larger. Among these two types of nanocomposites, Au–ZnO enhanced the photocatalytic activity of zinc oxide for degradation of methylene blue, although both of them were similar in physical properties. Indeed, the presence of discrete gold clusters shifted the Fermi level and led to accumulation of photoexcited electrons, slowing recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Gold-loaded particles had more intense visible light absorption and weaker photoluminescence emission intensity than bare zinc oxide NPs. However, the authors concluded that the Fermi-level shift upon Pt-decoration of ZnO allowed electrons to be discharged into the electrolyte, such that the photocatalytic activity did not improve. Gold loading of 3% gave the best photocatalytic performance.700
In an early study of the general applicability of VAFS, Formenti et al. synthesized various metal oxides including Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, V2O5, Fe2O3, GeO2, and ZrO2 NPs by the thermal decomposition of the corresponding metal chlorides in a H2–O2 flame and tested their effectiveness for oxidation of hydrocarbons under UV illumination. Their experimental set-up is presented in Fig. 91. The precursors were delivered to the reaction zone from a bubbler through a central tube in pure oxygen or oxygen diluted with air or nitrogen. Three other gaseous flows were injected to the reaction zone through three concentric tubes surrounding the central tube. The middle concentric flow was hydrogen, the fuel. Nitrogen flowed through the inner concentric region, between the central oxidizer flow and concentric fuel flow, to delay mixing and prevent plugging of the burner by particles generated too close to it. The outer region delivered additional oxygen to adjust the temperature of the flame. This played a substantial role in the process especially when the amount of oxygen in the carrier gas was decreased to decrease the flow rate of precursors and increase the residence time, which was important to adjust the size and morphology of the NPs. An electrostatic precipitator was used to collect the NPs. Three conditions were important for the synthesis of NPs in their system: (a) the stability of the oxide at the flame temperature, which was in the range of 1700 to 3000 K and could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen, (b) sufficiently fast oxidation and/or hydrolysis reaction of the precursors at the flame temperature, and (c) high volatility of the precursors. Spherical nonporous and monodispersed NPs of various oxides with sizes in the range of 10 to 200 nm were produced. They reported that the size and morphology of the NPs depended upon the precursor concentration, the residence time and the flame temperature. In studies of hydrocarbon oxidation, they found that O2 adsorbed on some oxides at room temperature, especially titania, as O2−, a labile species that reacted with carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, paraffins, and olefins to partially or completely oxidize them under UV illumination.584

Yoo et al. prepared aluminum-doped zinc oxide NPs by flame spray pyrolysis to improve their sensing performance for acetone detection. They added aluminum acetylacetonate (Al(C5H7O2)3) to a solution of zinc 2-ethylhexanoate (C16H30O4Zn) in xylene to achieve Al doping of 1 at% in zinc oxide. The precursor was dispersed by oxygen and delivered at 5 sccm through the nozzle into a ring-shaped premixed methane-oxygen flame. The final sensor material was obtained by forming a paste of the flame-synthesized NPs, drying, and annealing at 600 °C for 1 hour to improve their thermal and mechanical stability. The flame-made doped NPs outperformed both undoped flame-made NPs and doped NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Upon incorporation into a chemoresistive sensor, the flame-synthesized 1 at% Al-doped ZnO NPs showed a large sensing response of 245 (relative change in resistance) with a response time of around 3 s and a sensitivity of 23 ppm−1 upon exposure to ∼10 ppm acetone at 450 °C, while these values were 54, around 12 s, and 4 ppm−1 for the NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Moreover, these Al-doped ZnO NPs performed better compared other chemoresistive acetone sensors for the detection of ∼0.1 to 10 ppm acetone at a relative humidity of 90%. Notably, the acetone selectivity of these doped NPs can also be extended to other compounds of practical interest, such as ammonia, isoprene, and carbon monoxide. They suggested that the improvement in the sensing activity of the flame-synthesized Al-doped ZnO NPs compared to the pristine NPs and the NPs synthesized by a hydrothermal method can be attributed to the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies which resulted in greater adsorption of oxygen ions, which react with acetone molecules, on the surface of the flame-synthesized Al-doped ZnO NPs.695
Camenzind et al. employed a flame-based pyrolysis technique to produce yttria (Y2O3) doped with 5% europium in a single-step process. Yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) was dissolved in ammonia (NH3) and europium(III) 2-ethylhexanoate (C24H45O6Eu) was added as the dopant precursor. They controlled the size of NPs in the range of 10 to 25 nm. Short and cold flames produced pure monoclinic NPs, while long and hot flames generated mostly cubic phase NPs due to the longer residence time in the flame which facilitated the growth and transformation into this phase. This conversion from a compact to a less dense phase was accompanied by a particle size increase. In addition, they investigated the photoluminescence intensity and the radiative decay of the NPs and found that those prepared using the flame aerosol pyrolysis had lower photoluminescence intensity than commercial larger NPs, and also exhibited a faster radiative decay.705 Dosev et al. also synthesized europium doped yttria NPs using liquid-fed aerosol flame pyrolysis. The precursor was yttrium nitrate (Y(NO3)3) and europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3) dissolved in ethanol at concentrations of 50 and 2.5 mM, respectively. They found that the size of the doped NPs significantly affected their crystallinity and photoluminescence properties. They observed two types of non-agglomerated NPs in the product: (a) smaller faceted NPs with an average size in the range of 5 to 60 nm and a fully dense morphology (Fig. 92a), which probably were a mixture of higher-density metastable mixed phases including mostly monoclinic phases and minor face-centered cubic phases. (b) Larger spherical NPs with smaller inclusions in their center in some cases with an average size in the range of 50 to 200 nm (Fig. 92b) in the stable cubic phase of bulk Y2O3. They suggested that the dependence of particle morphology on the size of NPs could be explained by an elevated internal pressure when the size of NPs was reduced.598

Inyawilert et al. employed a single-step flame-based aerosol pyrolysis process to synthesize 0 to 1.0 wt% PdOx-doped In2O3. The precursor solution was a mixture of indium(III) nitrate hydrate (In(NO3)3·xH2O) and palladium(II) acetylacetonate ((C5H8O2)2Pd) dissolved in ethanol (C2H5OH). It was thermally decomposed in a methane-oxygen flame. The synthesized NPs included cubic and spherical indium oxide NPs with mean sizes of 2–20 nm without any detectable Pd or PdOx secondary phases. Based upon further analyses, they suggested that the palladium-containing species might be embedded in and on grain boundaries of indium oxide NPs. XPS indicated that the Pd was in an oxidized state. In addition, they investigated the gas sensing applications of the synthesized nanomaterials and found that doping with PdOx enhanced the hydrogen-sensing characteristics of indium oxide nanomaterials especially at the optimum 0.5 wt% palladium content.718
2.3.3.4. Mixed metal oxides. 
Marchal et al. synthesized yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12) NPs by a flame-based pyrolysis technique. They used various precursor solutions composed of: (a) yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) in ethanol (C2H5OH), (b) yttrium nitrate hexahydrate and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate in butanol (C4H9OH), (c) yttrium 2-ethylhexanoate (C24H45O6Y) and alumatrane (N(C2H4O)3Al) in ethanol, (d) yttrium 2-ethylhexanoate and alumatrane in tetrahydrofuran ((CH2)4O), (e) yttrium methoxyacetate (C9H15O9Y) and alumatrane in ethanol, (f) yttrium acetylacetonate (C15H21O6Y) and alumatrane in ethanol, (g) yttrium propionate (C9H15O6Y) and aluminum acetylacetonate (C15H21O6Al) in ethanol, or (h) yttrium propionate and aluminum acetylacetonate in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Oxygen was used as the atomizing gas. They produced NPs with a primary size below 100 nm at a rate of 50 g h−1. They reported that the choice of precursor was a key factor controlling the morphology, phase composition, and phase change upon annealing. Although the as-synthesized NPs had the Y3Al5O12 composition of the precursor feed, XRD analysis showed a mixture of phases that included Y4Al2O9 and hexagonal YAlO3 I. Most likely, the remaining alumina was amorphous or in defect structures. The most homogenous NPs had the modified crystalline structure of YAlO3 I and a composition of Y3Al5O12. Moreover, they annealed their NPs at 900 to 1000 °C for 7 to 10 days to produce free-flowing Y3Al5O12 NPs with no grain growth or necking.707
Saadatkhah et al. synthesized LiMn2O4 NPs in a natural gas-oxygen flame with two types of precursor solutions: a mixture of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and manganese acetate tetrahydrate (Mn(CH3CO2)2·4H2O) and a mixture of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and manganese nitrate hydrate (Mn(NO3)2·xH2O). They investigated the effects of various operating parameters and found that residence time and reaction temperature had the greatest effects on the manganese oxide content, while the carbon content was affected by the precursor and fuel type, increasing to 2% using a mixture of lithium carbonate and manganese acetate tetrahydrate from 0.1% when a mixture of lithium nitrate and manganese nitrate hydrate was employed. In addition, the morphology of the NPs depended upon both the temperature profile and the precursor mixture. A relatively mild temperature gradient generated NPs with a wrinkled surface, while higher temperature and steeper temperature gradient created NPs with “blowholes” in their structure. Moreover, the precursor feed rate affected the size of agglomerated NPs; using 0.5 M nitrate precursors generated polycrystalline NPs with primary particle sizes of 5 to 8 nm in agglomerates of about 1 μm diameter, while the size of agglomerates increased to around 10 μm using 5 M precursor concentration. Fig. 93 presents SEM images of representative particles from this study, illustrating these effects. Furthermore, they used the NPs in Li-ion battery cathodes and found that carbon coating from the flame and increased manganese oxide content of the NPs reduced their lithium uptake (energy storage) capacity.629

Chiarello et al. employed flame-based aerosol pyrolysis with a methane-oxygen flame to produce LaCoO3 perovskite NPs. The precursor was lanthanum(III) acetate dihydrate (La(CH3COO)3·2H2O) and cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O) dissolved in propionic acid (C3H6O2). They investigated the effects of operating parameters on the specific surface area, crystallinity, particle size, catalytic activity, and thermal stability. Increasing the precursor concentration and the precursor feed rate at constant oxygen to precursor ratio, and decreasing the oxygen linear discharge velocity and oxygen flow rate under subsonic conditions, led to decreases in specific surface area and catalytic activity, and increases in the crystallinity, particle size, and thermal stability. Changing the oxygen flow rate under supersonic conditions did not affect those properties.721 In another study, they tested the photocatalytic activity of flame-made titania NPs for hydrogen generation by water splitting and for methanol reforming. The titanium precursor was titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) dissolved in propionic acid (C3H6O2), 2-ethylhexanoic acid (C8H16O2), xylene (C8H10), a mixture of propionic acid and methanol (CH3OH), or a mixture of xylene and pyridine (C5H5N). The organic solvents also served as fuel. They found that the hydrogen evolution rate increased with increasing content of anatase phase, surface area, and crystallinity of the photocatalyst. These factors were favored by high flame temperature. Among the fuels, flame formation with xylene led to production of NPs that were more active than commercially available titania. To enhance photocatalytic activity, they doped titania with gold by combining the titanium precursor and dimethyl gold(III) acetylacetonate (C7H13AuO2) in xylene. Doping 1% gold into TiO2 enhanced the rate of hydrogen generation by an order of magnitude in a water splitting process and by a factor of 30 in methanol reforming, compared to pristine titania.659
Sukee et al. synthesized pristine and Ag-loaded LaFeO3 NPs by flame spray pyrolysis and tested their sensing performance for acetylene detection. Lanthanum(III) nitrate hydrate (La(NO3)3·H2O) and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) were dissolved in methanol (CH3OH). Silver nitrate (AgNO3) in acetonitrile (C2H3N) was added to produce Ag-loaded LaFeO3. The precursor was sprayed using an oxygen flow of 5 lpm through a nozzle into oxygen-methane subsidiary flamelets. The pristine LaFeO3 NPs exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for acetylene concentrations below 500 ppm, outperforming LaFeO3 NPs synthesized by a sol–gel technique. Moreover, an optimal loading of 0.1 wt% of Ag on the LaFeO3 NPs provided the highest response (relative resistance change) of 60 for the detection of 100 ppm acetylene at 200 °C in a chemoresistive sensor. This value was approximately 12 times that of pristine LaFeO3 NPs. A higher loading of 1 wt% Ag on the LaFeO3 NPs gave low sensitivity and no selectivity towards acetylene. The optimal loading of 0.1 wt% Ag on the LaFeO3 NPs exhibited selectivity toward acetylene against interferents including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and ethylene, and a sensor response that changed relatively little with changes in humidity. They proposed, based on a detailed analysis, that the improvement in sensing performance of the Ag-loaded LaFeO3 NPs synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis could be attributed to a Fermi-level control mechanism. The results showed superior performance of the LaFeO3-based NPs for acetylene detection at low concentrations compared to other gas sensors, making them promising candidates for practical applications like dissolved gas analysis (DGA) for power transformer oil.720
Tada et al. employed flame spray pyrolysis to synthesize copper-loaded zirconia NPs with a high loading level ranging from 20 to 80 wt% and investigated their catalytic activity for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and its conversion to methanol. Because flame spray pyrolysis is a simple and fast technique to synthesize catalysts, they highlighted its ability to produce catalysts for an industrial application. They atomized a solution of copper acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3CO2)2·H2O) and zirconyl 2-ethylhexanoate (C32H60O8Zr) in methanol (CH3OH) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (C8H16O2) using oxygen as the dispersant and delivered it to a CH4–O2 flame. They found that varying the copper loading changed the nanomaterial structure, with 20 wt% loading leading to formation of CuO with a mean size of 5 nm on tetragonal ZrO2 NPs with sizes of 5 to 10 nm, while 60 wt% loading produced a core–shell structure of ZrO2 aggregates coated with numerous CuO NPs below 5 nm and an even higher loading level of 80 wt% produced both Cu NPs with an average size of 10 nm and CuO NPs smaller than 5 nm on the ZrO2 aggregates. Hydrogenation at 300 °C reduced the copper oxide to copper NPs with dimensions below 20 nm in diameter and zirconia NPs in the range of 10 to 20 nm. They found that lower loading levels led to strong interaction between copper and zirconia which resulted high methanol selectivity. Increasing loading from 20 to 80 wt% increased the number of active sites for CO2 conversion. The catalyst with a loading level of 60 wt% combined strong interaction between copper and zirconia with a high number of active sites and performed better than a commercial CuO/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst for conversion of CO2 to methanol.710
Gültekin et al. used flame aerosol pyrolysis to produce SrAl2O4:Eu2+/Dy3+ NPs. They employed strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2) in distilled water and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), europium nitrate pentahydrate (Eu(NO3)3·5H2O), and dysprosium nitrate hydrate (Dy(NO3)3·xH2O) in methanol as the precursor solution, which was decomposed in a methane-oxygen flame. They calcined the as-synthesized material to obtain luminescent NPs. Notably, they mixed the precursor solution with glacial acetic acid (CH3CO2H) as a capping agent and boric acid (H3BO3) to decrease the sintering temperature. In addition, they investigated the optical properties of the flame-synthesized NPs and found that the emission spectra exhibited a green band centered at 525 nm at ambient conditions upon excitation at 350 nm, due to anomalous luminescence from Eu2+ and Dy3+ in the host lattice. Hence, they successfully synthesized novel luminescent doped NPs with long afterglow and high intensity.704
2.3.3.5. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Li et al. synthesized ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs with primary particle diameters of 6 to 53 nm using a flame-based technique. The precursor was iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3) dissolved in xylene (C8H10) and acetonitrile (C2H3N) and decomposed in a methane-oxygen flame. Increasing the ratio of precursor to oxygen, the atomizing gas, increased the temperature, residence time, and iron concentration in the flame, which resulted in larger crystallite size and higher cation vacancy concentration. Accordingly, they could gradually convert the morphology of the NPs from quasi-spherical to two-dimensional hexagonal/octagonal platelet shapes, and adjust the crystallinity from disordered cubic phase to fully ordered tetragonal γ-Fe2O3 as the particle size increased (Fig. 94). In addition, they reported that in some cases the particle size distribution broadened with increasing average particle size to an even greater extent than predicted for the self-preserving size distribution. Moreover, they studied the magnetic properties of the NPs and found that with increasing particle size, vacancy ordering led to an increase in saturation magnetization for NPs below 13 nm in diameter. Above this size, the value matched that of bulk γ-Fe2O3. Thereafter, there was a minimal effect of crystallite size on saturation magnetism. Overall, this work showed that flame-based pyrolysis can be effectively employed to produce magnetic NPs with control of magnetic and physicochemical properties, but that the relationships between process parameters and final properties are only partially understood.614

Rajput et al. also employed flame spray pyrolysis to synthesize superparamagnetic γ-Fe2O3 NPs with tunable morphology. They used iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3) in xylene (C8H10) and acetonitrile (C2H3N) with a combustion enthalpy of −26.7 kJ per mole. The precursor solution was atomized using oxygen as the dispersant and delivered to a core flame with a methane-oxygen ratio of 1.5–3.2. Oxygen also served as the sheath gas. The synthesized NPs adopted a hexagonal platelet morphology with a relatively narrow size distribution ranging from 3.6 to 15.7 nm and a high specific surface area of 79 m2 g−1. The authors investigated the magnetic properties of the NPs and reported a blocking temperature (Tb) of approximately 170 K and saturation magnetizations of 45.5 and 50.2 emu g−1 at 300 and 2 K, respectively. Such magnetic properties allowed the authors to use the γ-Fe2O3 NPs as adsorbents to remove heavy metal ions such as copper (Cu2+) and lead (Pb2+) from water, using magnetic separation instead of conventional filtration to recover the particles.683
Strobel and Pratsinis used a scalable flame spray pyrolysis technique with a controlled atmosphere to synthesize iron oxide NPs with three different oxidation states and crystal phases, including wurtzite (FeO), maghemite (Fe2O3), and magnetite (Fe3O4) with average primary particle sizes near 50 nm. In addition to the flame spray nozzle, their set-up (Fig. 95) included a metal tube with an inner diameter of 4 cm that confined the flame and separated it from the surrounding atmosphere. A second spray nozzle, mounted at an angle of 45° to the flame and located 20 cm above the flame spray nozzle delivered a spray of de-ionized water dispersed by nitrogen to rapidly cool the flame products and prevent reignition of the hot unreacted gases upon exposure to air after exiting the reaction tube. They used two types of iron precursor: (a) iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) dissolved in ethanol (C2H5OH), tetrahydrofuran ((CH2)4O), and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (C8H16O2); and (b) iron(II) naphthenate (C22H14O4Fe) diluted with tetrahydrofuran ((CH2)4O). They could control the iron oxidation state by adjusting the ratio of the precursor solution to air and by the choice of iron precursor, because iron was in a different oxidation state in each precursor. They studied the magnetic properties of the NPs and found that while all of them exhibited superparamagnetism, a mixture of maghemite and magnetite exhibited the highest saturation magnetization.681

Hilty et al. explored the potential of flame-made iron-containing nanomaterials for biological applications, specifically considering iron fortification of foods. Accordingly, they used a scalable flame-based approach to produce poorly water-soluble iron and iron/zinc compounds in nanoparticulate form. These small particles, with a specific surface area of around 190 m2 g−1 produced less change in the color of food compared to conventional iron fortificants. Moreover, the addition of zinc to FePO4 and magnesium to Fe/Zn oxide could promote the absorption of iron from the compounds, and in the latter case improved their color as well.727
Dosev et al. synthesized Co:Nd:Fe2O3/Eu:Gd2O3 NPs with core/shell structure, in which Co:Nd:Fe2O3 served as a magnetic core and Eu:Gd2O3 was a luminescent shell. They employed a two-step flame-based approach for this purpose. In the first step, a solution of cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2), neodymium nitrate (Nd(NO3)3), and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) dissolved in ethanol (C2H5OH) was atomized and injected into a H2-air flame with a temperate of 2000 °C. The flame-synthesized loosely-agglomerated NPs were mixed with a solution of europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)3) and gadolinium nitrate (Gd(NO3)3) in ethanol and sonicated to break up loose agglomerates. The aerosol droplets of this precursor solution were introduced into the flame to create the final magnetic core/luminescent shell particles that were used for immunoassay applications.688
Bickmore et al. employed a novel flame-based aerosol reactor to generate NPs of magnesium aluminum double alkoxide. A schematic of their apparatus is presented in Fig. 96. Their reactor consisted of: (a) a cylindrical 7.5 cm diameter by 15 cm long quartz reaction chamber, (b) twin aerosol generators at the entrance of the reaction chamber, (c) a 5 cm diameter quartz tee at the reactor exit, (d) four concentric wire-in-cylinder electrostatic precipitators (5 cm diameter by 1 meter length) arranged with two in sequence on each branch of the tee, with a 5–10 kV DC bias applied between the wire and the wall, and (e) exhaust piping and valves to control the flows. The twin aerosol generators consisted of: (a) a precursor tube with an inner diameter of 0.4 mm, and (b) a tube perpendicular to the precursor tube with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm to deliver oxygen at high velocity as the atomizing gas. The atomized droplets introduced to the reaction zone decomposed in natural gas/oxygen flames from a separate burner. The precursors were prepared from aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) or magnesium oxide (MgO) by heating in ethylene glycol with triethanolamine to reactively dissolve them, then evaporating most of the ethylene glycol, and finally diluting with ethanol. They synthesized dense, spherical, ultrafine monocrystalline NPs with average sizes, specific surface areas, and production rates in the ranges of 10 to 100 nm, 40 to 60 m2 g−1, and 50 to 100 g h−1, respectively. They suggested that rapid oxidation of the organic ligands and subsequent nucleation and growth from oxide species as the particle formation mechanism.605

2.3.3.6. Nanocomposites. 
Sotiriou et al. synthesized biocompatible silica-coated Ag/Fe2O3 as hybrid plasmonic-magnetic NPs with a morphology they described as “Janus-like” (Fig. 97), using a single-step scalable flame-based aerosol process. To do so, they used iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3) and silver acetate (AgC2H3O2) in a mixture of acetonitrile (C2H3N) and 2-ethylhexanoic acid (C8H16O2) as a high-enthalpy precursor solution. The core NPs formed by thermal decomposition of the precursor solution in a premixed methane-oxygen flame. Subsequent swirl injection of hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2) as a silicon precursor led to in-flight silica coating of the core nanocomposites. The nanothin layer of silica around the core nanocomposites did not alter the magnetic and plasmonic properties or the morphology of the nanocomposite particles. However, it made them more suitable for biological applications, by minimizing release of toxic Ag+ ions and direct contact of Ag with live cells. It simultaneously prevented their flocculation, facilitating dispersion of the NPs in biological and aqueous buffer solutions without any surface treatment. Furthermore, they investigated the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites and found that the nearly superparamagnetic maghemite component facilitated their magnetic manipulation in aqueous suspensions. At the same time, the distinct LSPR absorbance of silver became clear with increasing particle size and silver content.687 In another investigation, they produced biocompatible silica-coated silver NPs with sizes of 5.7–20.4 nm and an inert nanothin layer of silica by the same approach. They evaluated the cytotoxicity of the coated NPs for murine macrophage cells, which are one of the first types of cells that would encounter silver NPs upon intake by mammals. They observed that the smaller nanocomposites released higher fractions of their mass after dispersion in aqueous solution, which played a substantial role in the cytotoxicity of the nanocomposites upon incubation with murine macrophages. They concluded that the toxicity of the silver nanomaterials with sizes below 10 nm was mostly mediated by the release of Ag+ ions, while these ions had less effect when the size of silver NPs was above 10 nm. Indeed, the direct interactions between the silver nanomaterials and macrophages dominated the toxicity of silver nanomaterials with sizes above 10 nm.717

Strobel et al. designed a novel flame-based reactor (Fig. 98) based upon two nozzles with methane-oxygen flames, used it to produce Pt/Ba/Al2O3 NPs, and investigated the catalytic activity of these materials for NOx storage. One nozzle sprayed the aluminum precursor solution and the other sprayed a precursor solution containing barium and platinum. The first precursor was aluminum(III) tri-sec-butoxide (C12H27AlO3) in diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (C8H18O3) and acetic anhydride (C4H6O3) and the second was barium(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (C16H30BaO4) and platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(O2C5H7)2) in ethanol (C2H5OH). Using two separate nozzles allowed synthesis of individual alumina and monoclinic barium carbonate with good NOx storage activity, while using one nozzle resulted in alumina NPs with amorphous barium species and very limited NOx storage capacity. In addition, they reported that late mixing of the two flame products achieved by increasing the distance between the nozzles increased the crystalline barium carbonate content. The initially-produced monoclinic barium carbonate was converted to the orthorhombic phase at ambient conditions. All of the nanocrystalline barium carbonate samples showed much lower thermal stability than the corresponding bulk material.724

Gänzler et al. employed two-nozzle flame spray pyrolysis to synthesize Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalysts in which the concentration of reduced platinum and ceria were 1 and 5 wt%, respectively. For this, they sprayed a solution of aluminum acetylacetonate (C15H21AlO6) in xylene (C8H10) from one nozzle and a solution of platinum (II) acetylacetonate (C10H14O4Pt) and cerium(III) ethylhexanoate (C24H45CeO6) in xylene from another nozzle, with oxygen as the dispersant for both nozzles, into a methane-oxygen flame. They also synthesized CeO2–Al2O3, as a reference catalyst, without adding platinum. To remove organic residues, they calcined the catalysts in air for 5 hours at 500 °C. They tested the nanocomposites as diesel oxidation catalysts, investigating the effect of platinum NPs on the diesel oxidation as well as fast oxygen storage and release by ceria. They found that the size of platinum NPs determined the available sites to activate the reductant (H2, C3H6, or CO) at low temperatures for reduction of ceria. The size of platinum NPs also played a substantial role in determining the platinum-ceria interfacial area; increasing the size of platinum NPs decreased the concentration of interfacial sites and consequently, decreased the reduction rate of ceria.638
2.3.3.7. Scale-up. 
Wegner and Pratsinis investigated scale-up of vapor-fed flame aerosol synthesis, focusing on the well-studied titania and silica systems. Their reactor system (Fig. 99a) consisted of a precursor delivery system, a particle collection unit, and a co-flow diffusion flame reactor with three concentric tubes to pass argon as the carrier gas containing the precursor, oxygen as the oxidant, and methane as the fuel. They employed three different co-flow burners with outer diameters of 5.6, 10, and 27 mm (Fig. 99b). The flow rates of argon and methane, and the feed rate of the precursor were held constant at 0.3 lpm, 0.5 lpm, and 6.5 g h−1 for all three burners, respectively, while the flow rate of oxygen could be adjusted in the range of 1 to 50 lpm to control the size of NPs produced. Increasing the flow rate of oxygen led to a transition from laminar to turbulent flames. The velocity difference between the fuel and oxygen jets at the burner outlet played a substantial role in governing reactant mixing and quenching of these flames. They analysed the primary NP size based on this velocity difference and found that results for all three reactors with different co-flow burners collapsed onto a single curve for each material. NPs with the same primary particle diameter could be synthesized at the same velocity difference between the fuel and oxygen jets with over-ventilated single diffusion flames which was advantageous to control the reactor process. In addition, they scaled by a factor of 0.25, 0.5, 3, and 5 the standard conditions for the synthesis of silica NPs. They observed different operating lines in the plots of the primary particle diameter based on the velocity difference after the scale-up, but in each case the operating line followed an exponential function with two constants for the smallest and largest mean primary particle diameters (Fig. 99c). These constants were different for different operating lines. They reported a correlation between these two constants with the production rate based on a mass balance, which could be advantageous in developing scale-up procedures for diffusion flame-based synthesis reactors.644

(c) Burner operating lines for the standard equipment without scale-up (5 g h−1 silica production rate), with scale-up by a factor of three (15 g h−1 silica production rate), and with scale-up by factor of 5 (25 g h−1 silica production rate).

In another study, Pratsinis’ group scaled-up a process for the synthesis of silica to production rates as high as 1.1 kg h−1. The primary particle size in this case was in the range of 10 to 75 nm. They used a commercially available stainless-steel gas assisted atomizer to spray the precursor. A baghouse filter unit was employed to collect the NPs and was cleaned periodically by air-pressure shocks. The precursor was hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2) used pure or diluted in ethanol to investigate the effect of precursor concentration on the average primary particle size in their scaled-up system. They found that the precursor concentration did not affect the size, but that the size could be controlled by adjusting the precursor feed rates and the oxidant flow rates, as in the well-established flame reactor at smaller (laboratory) scale. Furthermore, they could influence the particle size to a limited extent by the choice of the dispersion gas (air or oxygen) or by applying oxygen as a sheath gas (Fig. 100).645

2.3.3.8. Reduced metal-containing nanomaterials. 
Scharmach et al. developed a high-temperature reducing jet (HTRJ) reactor to synthesize metal NPs by a flame-based approach. A 3D schematic of the HTRJ reactor is presented in Fig. 101. They combined hydrogen reduction with thermal decomposition to synthesize metal NPs, rather than the more common metal oxides. In their set-up, about 2 lpm of oxygen was introduced into the combustion zone through a central tube, while about 10 lpm of a H2:N2 mixture was introduced through a surrounding concentric annular region to form an inverted diffusion flame. They used a converging-diverging nozzle to accelerate the hot combustion products and injected a precursor solution into the throat or the diverging portion of the nozzle. By adjusting the length and diameter of the region between the nozzle and the quench zone as the particle nucleation and growth section, they could control the residence time in the region in the range from milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds. They designed the process for a residence time of ∼50 ms with a total gas flow rate in the range of 10 to 20 lpm. An excess flow of about 100 lpm nitrogen at the outlet of the reactor was used to quench the process, enabling the synthesis of loosely-agglomerated NPs. To test their system, they first produced carbon-coated copper NPs as a prototype for non-oxide materials that could not be easily synthesized in conventional flame-based aerosol processes. Copper formate (C2H2CuO4) was selected as the precursor because of its ability to directly produce carbon-coated NPs as well as its high water solubility, low cost, and decomposition to the favored product and environmentally safe byproducts. They synthesized non-agglomerated carbon-coated copper NPs with an average size below 50 nm, demonstrating the potential of the HTRJ reactor to generate non-oxide NPs of metals that can be reduced by hydrogen in the presence of water vapor.689 Later, Konda et al. added an inlet to the quench section of this HTRJ reactor to spray octylamine to cap palladium-copper alloy NPs in-flight. With this in situ functionalization, they successfully combined synthesis and functionalization of Pd–Cu NPs in a single-step process to produce NPs that form stable dispersions in common solvents.713 Recently, Mohammadi et al. used this system to synthesize functionalized bimetallic nickel-silver nanomaterials with an average primary particle size of 4 to 5 nm702 and crumpled reduced graphene oxide (RGO) decorated with non-oxide transition metal NPs in the form of binary and ternary alloys such as Co–Ni, Co–Pd, Co–Ni–Pd, and Co–Ni–Fe with controlled average metal particle sizes below 4 nm.631

2.3.3.9. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Ulrich performed a valuable study on the mechanism of NP growth in flame-based synthesis of silica NPs using a Brownian collision-coalescence model. He used silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) and a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen to produce a flame that generated silica clusters with average particle diameters of 13.6 and 6.8 nm and specific surface areas of 200 and 400 m2 g−1, respectively. The translational velocities and collision frequencies of the silicon NPs were modeled as those of large gas molecules due to their very small size (behavior described as the free-molecular regime in aerosol dynamics). Because of a relatively short chemical reaction and nucleation period compared to the total synthesis period, the product size distribution was only affected by Brownian collisions and was independent of the early history of the system. Accordingly, the mean logarithm of particle size was directly proportional to the mean logarithm of the growth time. To cool the NPs to temperatures where they do not sinter, a secondary air flow was injected into the commercial flame jets which made the growth time and the average particle size dependent on the initial flame temperature. He concluded that the mechanism could be expanded to treat the synthesis of carbon and other oxides synthesized by flame-based approaches if the size of primary particles was relatively small compared to the mean-free path of gas molecules, the reaction times were relatively short compared to the quench times, and the supersaturation ratios were sufficiently high.639 In another study, Ulrich and Riehl employed CH4–O2 flames for the thermal decomposition of SiCl4 to synthesize silica NPs. They measured the growth of aerosol clusters by a laser light scattering approach and found the synthesized particles were composed of flocs or aggregates containing numerous smaller primary particles.640
Landgrebe and Pratsinis derived a self-preserving map in the process parameter space of dimensionless chemical reaction time and dimensionless process residence time for aerosol synthesis of NPs with a finite rate of precursor reaction or decomposition. Though we discuss this landmark paper here, in the context of flame-based synthesis, because of its generality, it is equally applicable to CVC or other processes with finite rates of monomer generation followed by aggregation and sintering. In general, if allowed to aggregate and sinter for sufficient time, any aerosol will approach a self-preserving size distribution that is approximately log-normal and that changes in mean size and number concentration, but not in shape, with further coagulation and sintering.728,729 Landgrebe and Pratsinis developed a dimensionless discrete-sectional model for free-molecular aerosol coagulation and validated it by examining the section spacing and numerically conserved aerosol characteristics such as number concentration, volume concentration, and volume squared concentration. The self-preserving map described conditions, particularly the minimum dimensionless time, required to synthesize NPs with the asymptotic self-preserving size distribution. The required time to reach a self-preserving size distribution was four times the characteristic time for the coagulation of monomers when reaction (monomer generation) was instantaneous (dimensionless time for reaction <0.25), while it reached around 15 times the characteristic dimensionless time for chemical reaction for slower reactions. Moreover, they compared the results from their discrete-sectional model to moment models for coagulation that assumed a monodispersed, self-preserving, or lognormal aerosol size distribution function. They found that the results from the discrete-section model were in good agreement with the all three moment models in terms of integral aerosol characteristics for the case of instantaneous reaction, while the moment models could not predict the geometric mean diameter, the total number concentration, and geometric standard deviation reliably in the non-self-preserving region of the self-preserving map for conditions with slower precursor reaction and monomer generation.730
Akhtar et al. developed a Monte Carlo simulation to model the morphology changes due to gas-phase coagulation and sintering during high-temperature aerosol synthesis of NPs based upon a modified cluster–cluster aggregation model and taking a finite interparticle binding energy into account. This allowed particles to migrate along the surface of the growing aggregates to simulate sintering. They observed that more compact aggregates formed due to the enhanced surface mobility of monomers at sufficiently high temperatures. The fractal dimension and the sintering rate decreased at longer times (more Monte Carlo steps) as the particles became larger. Moreover, they found that the surface area of aggregates was a more useful and reliable descriptor of aggregate structure than the fractal dimension, due to its greater sensitivity to changes in the simulation conditions such as the reaction temperature and the sintering rate. The main challenge in Monte Carlo simulations is the consideration of two different time scales for the simulation (those of aggregation and sintering) and linking these time scales to real time, e.g. residence time in a flame. To solve this challenge, they defined an effective sintering rate through the time evolution of the surface area of aggregates to relate the two time scales in the model. This paper was a notable advance in understanding of the detailed evolution of aggregate morphology during aerosol synthesis.731
Tsantilis et al. developed an effective and efficient moving sectional model, i.e. a model in which the size bins describing the aerosol size distribution evolve over time, that considered simultaneous gas phase and surface reactions, coagulation, and sintering. They validated it by comparison with standard sectional solutions and detailed literature models. They considered the synthesis of titania NPs in a premixed CH4–O2 flame, using titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) as the precursor, as a case study. They compared their predictions with experimental results for Sauter (surface area) mean diameter, geometric standard deviation, and the full primary particle size distribution at various locations in the flame to investigate and distinguish between three different reaction pathways for production of titania NPs, including pure gas phase thermal decomposition, gas phase hydrolysis, and gas phase and surface decomposition of the precursor to describe the measured primary particle size distributions. Agreement between the modelling and experimental results was excellent in the monodispersed regime for the primary particle size distribution. Under those conditions, surface reaction was the dominant pathway for the growth of NPs.732
Rosner and Pyykönen developed and applied a bivariate quadrature method of moments simulation using 9 moments to model synthesis of alumina particles in a trimethyl aluminum-seeded CH4–O2 laminar counterflow diffusion flame reactor for which they had previously collected an extensive data set. They predicted the evolution of alumina NP aggregates using known transport laws for coagulation, sintering, and thermophoresis, capturing most of the observed behavior in their extensive data set. Although they were able to fit an effective activation energy for particle coalescence, they did not necessarily view it as physically meaningful, and discussed several potential improvements in the various rate laws that will be needed. They nonetheless suggested that the incorporation of this simulation technique into full probability density function (PDF)-methods for turbulent reacting flows could enable the description of realistic turbulent synthesis reactors using improved rate laws, while recognizing both the advantages and limitations associated with quadrature-based moment methods that do not assume or provide explicit distribution functions for size or other properties.733
Mädler et al. combined measurements and modelling of droplet evaporation and flame temperature as well as particle properties in a systematic study of the flame-spray-pyrolysis synthesis of silica using an external-mixing gas-assisted atomizer with six premixed methane-oxygen flamelets as supporting flames. They investigated the effect of oxidant and precursor solvent/fuel composition with different enthalpy contents on the specific surface area of the flame-made NPs. For this, they considered the production of silica NPs from precursor solutions of hexamethyldisiloxane (O[Si(CH3)3]2) in methanol, ethanol, or iso-octane. Oxygen and air were each used as both dispersion gas and as oxidant. They employed a spray combustion model to compute the droplet lifetime and describe the effect of oxidant/dispersion gas type on the structure of the flame and the characteristics of the synthesized NPs. They observed that increasing the flow rate of oxidant at low oxidant flow rates increased the specific surface area of NPs because it resulted in shorter residence times in the shortened spray flame, and thus, less time for growth of NPs. The specific surface area reached a maximum and then decreased at higher flow rates of the oxidant as the flame height further decreased. At the highest oxidant flows, both solvent (fuel) and precursor oxidized faster in a smaller volume, reaching higher temperatures that induced a higher sintering rate. They observed this maximum for both methanol and ethanol. For iso-octane, with higher enthalpy content driving faster evaporation and combustion, increasing the flow rate of oxidant produced a monotonic decrease in specific surface area. Further increase in the flow rate of oxidant did not allow sufficient heat transfer and time for ignition from the assisting flamelets, and the main flame was extinguished. Iso-octane with the lowest volatility exhibited the longest ignition delay among the three fuels. Methanol with the lowest enthalpy content and accordingly, the slowest evaporation rate, gave a maximum specific surface area at higher flow rates, confirming the lesser importance of the decrease in the residence time compared to the increase in combustion intensity at high flow rates. In situ flame spray temperature measurements revealed a longer residence time for growth at higher temperature, achieved using oxygen as the oxidant compared to air, which accordingly resulted in lower specific surface area. The results of their study provided valuable insights into the flame spray synthesis of NPs, particularly for liquid precursors that are not easily evaporated.734
Some of the most sophisticated experimental and simulation studies of aerosol particle formation have been developed for soot formation. These are most often driven by a desire to prevent unwanted soot formation, but are also applicable to intentional synthesis of nanomaterials, particularly carbon black. In an exemplary study, Zhao et al. measured the soot particle size distribution function (PSDF) in a laminar premixed ethylene flame using a scanning mobility particle sizer, which detected particles down to a mobility diameter of 3 nm, in combination with a carefully-designed sampling and dilution system that quenched chemical reactions and minimized coagulation and losses in the sampling system. They studied the evolution of the PSDF from the very early stages of soot nucleation to particle mass growth. They observed that the PSDF followed a power-law dependence on particle diameter at the very early stages of soot formation, then became bimodal at higher positions above the burner surface, and maintained a bimodal distribution in the post-flame region. The small-particle part of the PSDF followed a power-law function, while the large-particle part of the PSDF was approximately log-normal. They employed a detailed numerical simulation to analyze the experimental results, in which the flame structure was described with detailed reaction kinetics and species transport. Nucleation and growth of the soot particles were also described through a kinetic model that included both surface growth and oxidation. In addition, they used a stochastic method to simulate the evolution of the PSDF. The numerical simulation was in a good agreement with experimental data, also predicting the bimodal distribution of the PSDF. Further analysis of the aerosol dynamics equations revealed that the bimodal behavior is intrinsic to an aerosol process involving cluster–cluster coagulation with nucleation of particles dominated by monomer dimerization.735
Zucca et al. integrated the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM) approach for solution of the population balance equations describing evolution of soot size distribution with a commercial finite-volume-based CFD code to simulate soot formation in a turbulent non-premixed ethylene-air flame. They used simplified kinetic expressions for nucleation, molecular growth, and oxidation of the soot particles, and a Brownian aggregation kernel. Furthermore, they simulated the fractal dimension evolution with a monovariate population balance as the simplest means to track the evolution of the morphology of the aggregated NPs. While the volume fraction of soot is well predicted, independent of assumptions about fractal dimension, because it does not depend on aggregation, the overall aggregate size was quite sensitive to fractal dimension. Thus, they showed that a suitable treatment of the particle fractal dimension was necessary to reasonably predict the morphology and overall size of the soot aggregates.736
Neto et al. employed a similar strategy to simulate the flame-spray-pyrolysis synthesis of NPs with polydispersed size distributions and solved the bivariate population balance model through DQMOM, which was selected based on its relatively straightforward adaptation from monovariate to bivariate cases. Their CFD simulations applied an Eulerean–Langrangian–Eulerian framework to simulate the reacting turbulent multiphase flow of the burning spray. The evaporating droplets, which are initially relatively large, were treated in a Lagrangian framework, while all other variables, including those associated with the NPs formed, were treated in an Eulerean framework. They considered the synthesis of zirconia NPs from a precursor solution of zirconium n-propoxide (C12H32O4Zr) in ethanol and propanol as a case study. They reported an accuracy of approximately 90% for the first two moments of the size distribution and good agreement between modelling and experimental results for the prediction of primary particle number per agglomerate.737
Singh et al. performed numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis to predict soot particle size distributions (PSDs) in laminar premixed ethylene flames and compared their predictions with experimental results for six flame configurations. They investigated the sensitivity of the soot PSDs to the defining soot model parameters such as soot inception, particle and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) collision efficiency and enhancement, and soot surface activity. They observed that increasing size of incepting soot particles played a significant role in the lower end of the PSDs, especially the position of the trough between modes in bimodal soot PSDs. Accordingly, understanding the chemistry of higher PAHs and a more detailed inception model in the case of interaction of PAHs to give different sizes of incepting soot particles are necessary for the precise prediction of soot PSDs. They also developed a new model to predict surface activity decay, in which only the soot particle history and the local flame temperature affected the soot particle activity. This was the first attempt to employ local flame variables to determine the surface aging, which was useful to predict the higher end of the soot PSDs.738 This group also performed a similar investigation on a laminar premixed ethylene burner-stabilised stagnation flame and studied the soot morphology in the post-flame region. Based on their sensitivity analysis, they found that the minimum particle inception size, the inception species concentration, and the coagulation rate have the greatest effect on the PSDs. Changes in the particle inception size and the coagulation rate produced an overall shift in the coagulation peak position. Moreover, they observed that a systematic shift in the both position of the trough between the bimodal PSD modes and the coagulation peak at larger diameters were both driven by particle inception size changes. Furthermore, they reported that a good agreement between the modelling and experimental data could be obtained only through changes in the concentration of inception species with each burner-stagnation plate separation.739
In another report, Kraft's group investigated the evolution of particle size distribution function (PSDF) in premixed stretch-stabilized flat ethylene-oxygen-argon flames to study the formation of soot in a pseudo-one-dimensional flow configuration that extended the experimental flame condition space by stretch-stabilization. They considered three sets of atmospheric-pressure ethylene-oxygen-argon flames with maximum temperatures of approximately 1980, 2000, and 2160 K to measure PSDFs and found strong dependence of PSDFs on the flame temperature. In agreement with prior studies, soot nucleation and growth stopped or reversed at sufficiently high temperatures. They observed a bimodal size distribution for PSDFs for the lower-temperature flames with peak temperatures of approximately 1980 K, while they were unimodal for the higher flame temperatures. Although the population balance soot modelling results were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for the flames with maximum temperatures around 1980 and 2000 K, it predicted the size and number density of soot to be much higher than the experimental results in the flame with a maximum temperature of around 2160 K. Based on sensitivity analyses, they proposed that the high temperature reversibility in soot nucleation, coagulation, and surface growth is the main reason for this overprediction. Accordingly, taking the thermodynamic reversibility of these processes into account is of great importance for the precise prediction of soot formation at temperatures above 2000 K.740
Botero et al. presented a theoretical and experimental investigation of the evolution of primary soot particles along the centerline of a co-flow laminar diffusion flame. They analyzed the size and nano-structure of soot particles from the ethylene flame, which were taken at various heights above the burner. They observed that the initial soot NPs, after nucleation, coagulate and coalescence to generate primary particles with a size of 5 to 15 nm. Coagulation and surface growth led to an increase in the size of the primary soot NPs along the centerline of the flame. Then, an amorphous layer of hydrocarbons condensed on the surface of these NPs which facilitated aggregation of primary particles into fractal-like structures. Higher temperatures in the flame led to fast carbonization of the amorphous layer to form a graphitic shell around the primary NPs. This graphitization reduced the size of NPs by compacting the primary particles. Thereafter, rapid oxidization near the flame tip reduced the size of NPs. Notably, based upon the experimental results, the primary particle size distribution was unimodal and relatively sharp at all the heights above the burner. It broadened and shifted toward larger size during particle growth, then shrunk and narrowed in the oxidation region of the flame. Moreover, they employed a detailed population balance model to study the mechanisms affecting the primary particle size distribution. They showed that although the average size of primary particles was relatively insensitive to model parameters such as sintering pre-factor, smoothing factor, and critical diameter for “liquid-like” behavior, the primary particle size distributions were sensitive to these factors. Accordingly, good agreement between the modelling and experimental results for the average size of primary particles is not a guarantee that the simulation results predict the primary particle size distributions precisely.741 This group also investigated the evolution of the soot particle size distribution in an n-heptane/toluene co-flow diffusion flame along its centerline. For this purpose, they reported the flame temperature and soot particle size distribution along the centerline of the diffusion flame. They added 0–15 mol% toluene to n-heptane and found that with increasing concentration of toluene, soot inception occurred at lower height above the burner (lower in the flame) which caused a larger soot growth zone and thus, an increase in the size of soot primary and agglomerated NPs. However, it had a negligible effect on the maximum number density of soot NPs. This study provides a new dataset for vapor-fed flames in a configuration (the Yale burner) that is well established for gas-fed, e.g. ethylene, flames.742
Mehta et al. developed a multiscale tool for modelling TiO2 synthesis from TiCl4 in a realistic turbulent flame aerosol reactor. They studied the effect of various chemical mechanisms, including one-step, detailed, and flamelet models, on the nucleation of NPs. They first employed a plug-flow reactor (PFR) and a partially stirred tank reactor (PaSR) to simulate the flow field under relatively ideal conditions. The simultaneous development of detailed chemical mechanisms to define gas-phase combustion and the evolution of particles, along with advanced tools to simulate the turbulent flow field and its interactions with the chemical processes, are necessary to develop such a predictive simulation. Toward this goal, they proposed a combination one-step/detailed model and a flamelet model to describe detailed chemistry for the nucleation of particles and combustion. The PFR simulation results showed that most nuclei were generated upstream of the flame surface for the one-step nucleation mechanism and then passed through the high-temperature zone in the flame, while the bulk of the nuclei were generated downstream of the flame surface for the, presumably more realistic, detailed nucleation mechanism. Thus, the one-step nucleation mechanism should predict very different high-temperature sintering behavior, in comparison with the detailed nucleation mechanism. The PaSR modelling revealed that, although there was a clear difference between the one-step and detailed nucleation mechanisms, the vigorous back mixing inside the turbulent flow led to formation of quite uniform particles. For the one-step nucleation mechanism, increasing the flame temperature increased the nucleation rate and the nucleation took place on the lean side of the flame, while it was predicted on both the lean and rich sides using the detailed mechanism, which predicted nucleation at temperatures ranging from 1500 K to 1800 K. In addition, they developed a large-eddy simulation tool to investigate the dependence of the synthesis of NPs in turbulent flames on the precursor injection configuration and saw that the formation of NPs happened very close to the surface of the flame in the case of the one-step nucleation mechanism, which was in agreement with results from PFR and PaSR simulations.743
Shekar et al. developed a chemical kinetic model for simulating the flame-based aerosol synthesis of silica NPs from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (SiC8H20O4). The first considered reactions involving species with high concentrations at equilibrium and identified silicic acid (Si(OH)4) as the main decomposition product. Then, they performed flux and sensitivity analyses to determine the key reaction pathways and observed that the generation of silicates from the TEOS decomposition under their process conditions was not important. Based upon level of importance (LOI) analysis for each species, they reduced the kinetic model to only the important species and coupled the reduced kinetic model to a detailed population balance model for particle formation by an operator splitting technique. They incorporated new particle inception and surface growth steps into a stochastic particle model in which the interaction of silicic acid monomers led to the formation and growth of particles. They considered the coagulation and sintering of particles in the model. They employed low discrepancy sequences to fit the model to the experimental data for collision and primary particle diameters and extract material-dependent sintering parameters consistent with experimental results. With this approach, they were able to predict the particle size distributions and create computer-generated TEM-style images in a good agreement with experimental data. Notably, they presented the temporal particle size evolution and the gas-phase reactor composition at various temperatures as well.744
Manuputty et al. modeled the nucleation, surface growth, and coagulation of spherical TiO2 particles in a stagnation-flame-synthesis system, assuming a simple one-step decomposition reaction of titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) and one-dimensional stagnation flow. They fully coupled the model to the flow and gas phase chemistry and solved the PBE for particle size using the method of moments with interpolative closure (MoMIC), assuming spherical particles due to the high flame temperature. They accounted for a free-jet region in the flow by matching the simulated OH* peak location with the experimentally observed position. Although they obtained good agreement between the modelling and experimental data on the mobility particle size with changes in the loading level of the precursor, they underpredicted the geometric standard deviation at high precursor loadings. Moreover, they reported high sensitivity of the particle size to the sampling location close to the stationary stagnation surface based upon the modelling results, which increased with increasing stagnation temperature and loading level of the precursor. Coagulation was the dominant process near the stagnation surface. Furthermore, they evaluated the effect of surface growth by comparison to results using an alternative reaction model and revealed the significant role of surface growth in the very early stage of particle formation. Omiting it produced extreme discrepancies in particle size and geometric standard deviation. Reducing the length of the combustion zone led to greater significance of surface growth than coagulation overall and produced a narrower size distribution.745 In a more recent study, they developed a general two-step simulation methodology to describe the complex morphology of aggregated NPs in a stagnation flame. They applied the methodology to the same case study as the previous work. First, a fully-coupled detailed gas-phase chemistry model, a one-dimensional flow model, and a spherical particle model treated by the MoMIC were employed to produce profiles of gas-phase conditions. Then, a detailed stochastic population balance model was applied to these gas-phase conditions to simulate the evolution of aggregating, sintering particles. To consider the thermophoretic transport effects due to sharp temperature gradients close to the stagnation flame, they applied a thermophoretic correction in the second step through a simulation volume scaling term which improved consistency between the second particle-evolution simulation and the first fully-coupled simulation.746 They employed the same strategy to simulate the formation of soot in a laminar premixed burner-stabilised benchmark ethylene stagnation flame which produced excellent agreement between the modelling and experimental results for burner-stagnation plate separations of at least 7 mm and for particles with mobility diameter above 6 nm.747 In addition, they performed a comprehensive parametric sensitivity analysis to find the effects of various processes on the computed primary soot particle size distributions in a laminar premixed burner-stabilized ethylene stagnation flame and observed that the production rate of pyrene, coagulation efficiency, and surface growth rate had the greatest effects on the computed primary soot particle size distributions.748 Moreover, they performed a parametric sensitivity study on the synthesis of titania NPs in a stagnation flame using this two-step simulation methodology, but this time they introduced new sintering parameters to consider the sintering behavior of NPs below 10 nm instead of the thermophoretic correction. Based upon this parametric sensitivity analysis, they found that the sintering parameters have the most significant effect on the morphology of the flame-synthesized titania NPs.749
In another related study, this group investigated, both experimentally and theoretically, the synthesis of a metastable “high-pressure” phase known as TiO2-II or α-PbO2-type TiO2 in a single-step flame-based aerosol synthesis process using a laminar premixed stagnation flame. They could adjust the fuel/oxygen equivalence ratio to produce other nanocrystalline phases of titania, such as anatase, rutile, and TiO2-B, and found that fuel-rich conditions led to generation of a rutile/TiO2-II mixture, while anatase/rutile and anatase/TiO2-B mixtures were synthesized under stoichiometric and fuel-lean conditions, respectively. The phase-controlled synthesis of heterojunctions of titania phases may be of great significance for photocatalytic activity, due to enhanced electron–hole separation. They proposed that the synthesis of TiO2-II in an atmospheric pressure flame is kinetically possible by the oxidation and solid-state transformation of a sub-oxide intermediate (TiO2−x), though it is not the thermodynamically stable phase. Based on this hypothesis, the metastable TiO2-II phase was considered responsible for the nucleation of rutile and was not directly generated from a molten/amorphous state.750
Rai et al. investigated the growth stages of ramified aggregates, representative of those formed in sooting flames and flame-based aerosol synthesis of metal oxides, through analysis of previously-reported in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) as a function of height above the burner. They considered the synthesis of silica aggregates in a premixed hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) (O[Si(CH3)3]2)/methane/oxygen/nitrogen flame by Kammler et al. as a case study.751 They analyzed ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) using a recent Unified Fit approach to identify intrinsic details of aggregate size and structure. With this approach, they were able to quantify the minimum paths, branch length, branch fractions, average number of branches, total mass of aggregates, coordination number of primary particles, Sauter mean diameter, and polydispersity of primary particles, providing new insights into the aggregate growth path. They summarized the growth process of aggregated NPs in three steps: (i) initial nucleation and growth, (ii) coalescence as the flame cools, and (iii) agglomeration of aggregates at higher heights above the burner to form the larger aggregated NPs, which can be considered universal steps applicable to production of most NP aggregates in flames.752
Li et al. studied droplet micro-explosions during single droplet combustion of precursor solutions in flame spray pyrolysis with optical techniques, including interferometric particle imaging (IPI) to find the droplet size changes and standard rainbow refractometry (SRR) to observe the rainbow pattern that changes with refractive index and refractive index gradient within droplets. They considered a solution of tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate (C16H30O4Sn) in xylene (C8H10) as a case study. To analyze the composition and temperature changes due to heat and mass transfer within the burning droplets, based on the experimentally-observed droplet size changes and rainbow patterns, they developed a multicomponent diffusion-limited transport model. Accordingly, they suggested the following mechanism for the droplet evolution and micro-explosions: (i) Droplet ignition resulted an initial increase in the rainbow scattering maximum angle, due to a sharp increase in the surface temperature and then, a decrease associated with the subsequent temperature equilibration between core and surface. (ii) Accumulation of the metal–organic precursor with a low vapor pressure at the surface of the droplets upon evaporation of the more volatile solvent limited solvent transport to the flame. This led to flame contraction and droplet surface reheating which then drove thermal decomposition of the precursor. This caused the formation of a viscous shell as a diffusive barrier for the solvent inside the droplet. Hence, a second increase in the rainbow maxima angle was observed as a result of the temperature gradient between the core and surface of the droplets. (iii) The subsequent temperature balance between the core and surface again decreased the rainbow angle maximum. The increasing temperature inside the droplet initiated the nucleation of vapor bubbles of the high volatility component, which caused the droplet micro-explosion. They observed a substantial difference in rainbow pattern evolution between precursor-laden droplets that undergo micro-explosions and single component droplets. Moreover, they found that the metal–organic precursor concentration significantly affected the required time for the droplet micro-explosions and the rainbow pattern evolution of the burning droplets. Indeed, increasing the concentration of metal–organic precursor reduced the time required for the droplet micro explosions by increasing the rate of accumulation of the precursor at the surface of the droplets and its subsequent decomposition and shell formation.753
In a study that focused on the dynamics of aerosol aggregation, Matsoukas and Friedlander synthesized spherical magnesium oxide and zinc oxide NPs with average primary particle sizes of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The precursors were magnesium acetate trihydrate (Mg(CH3CO2)2·3H2O) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) which were decomposed in a methane-air flame. They investigated the dynamics of the agglomerate size distribution and found good agreement between the distributions of the mobility equivalent diameter of the synthesized agglomerates and the coagulation theory for fractal-like agglomerates in the free molecule regime, which leads to a self-preserving size distribution for the agglomerates. Consistent with this theory, the average agglomerate size was inversely correlated with the size of the primary particles, given sufficient time for agglomeration.633
Biswas' group also studied the collisional growth rate of titania NPs synthesized in a flame-based aerosol reactor with an average size of 5 to 8 nm. Their system comprised: (a) a flame-based aerosol reactor to synthesize initial titania NPs by thermal decomposition of titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) in an O2:CH4 flame, (b) a nitrogen dilution probe placed horizontally, (c) a charged particle remover, (d) a first tube furnace at a fixed temperature of 823 °C to produce charge-free titania NPs with spherical morphology, (e) a second tube furnace for the collisional growth at temperatures of 400, 600, and 800 °C in laminar flow, (f) a nano-differential mobility analyzer (Nano-DMA) for particle classification after each furnace, (g) a condensation particle counter after each Nano-DMA to measure the particle number concentration and size distribution, and (h) a gas analyzer to measure the CO2 concentration in the combustion products. They numerically solved the aerosol general dynamic equation to model evolution of the particle size distribution. They compared the changes in particle size distribution at the outlet of the second tube furnace with predictions of the model and found that the collisional growth rate of the flame-synthesized titania NPs was greater than the rate predicted by the kinetic theory of gases. Accordingly, they calculated a collisional growth correction factor. They recognized that lower temperature led to an increase in the collisional growth factor because of increased importance of inter-particle attractive forces between the NPs. The collisional growth factor decreased with increasing temperature from 400 °C up to 800 °C, although it remained above 1, showing that even at high temperatures the attractive forces are non-negligible.660
Gan et al. applied a deep learning method to model the chaotic movement of the trapped NPs in the recirculation zone of a buoyancy-opposed flame aerosol reactor. Such buoyancy-opposed flames, or inverted flames, can produce macroscopic aggregates via the long residence time of these recirculating particles in and near the flame zone, leading to “gelation” of aggregates. They employed a high-speed camera to capture the Lagrangian trajectories of particles in the flame. Subsequently, they reconstructed the trajectories in a 3-dimensional cylindrical space and used them to train the two most widely adopted deep generative models: the generative adversarial net (GAN) and the variational autoencoder (VAE). Then, they investigated the performance of these two models and determined that the GAN model performed much better than the VAE. Results from the GAN model met both generalization and accuracy criteria, while a distinct trade-off between these criteria was unavoidable for VAE. Obtaining non-repeating multimodal outputs with statistical accuracy was possible in the GAN model. However, the VAE model could only select a single answer equivalent to the average of a wide variety of outputs because it is trained based on minimization of the mean squared error between input and output. Moreover, the GAN model was able to produce non-repeating trajectories of unlimited length, using only finite trajectories for training. Accordingly, the GAN model can be used to generate an unlimited number of trajectories with a fixed length, which is advantageous. Notably, these trajectory simulation methods are based upon statistics and therefore their performances is limited by the quality of the training datasets. Such statistically-based methods thus cannot fully replace deterministic modelling in which the physics responsible for the system's dynamic evolution are captured, particularly for extrapolating outside the parameter space of the training set.754


2.3.4. Laser pyrolysis. 
In most laser pyrolysis methods, a 10.6 μm CO2 laser beam is used as the source of energy to decompose a precursor. Mixing with an unheated gas that does not absorb at the laser wavelength leads to rapid quenching to form clusters. After the initial precursor decomposition, fast particle growth can relieve remaining supersaturation. Surface reaction as well as coagulation and coalescence are then responsible for further growth. The synthesis of hard agglomerates can be avoided by the rapid transition between high-temperature (rapid coalescence) and low-temperature (negligible coalescence) conditions.755–757 Energy of the laser at the wavelength of 10.6 μm should be absorbed in the reaction zone. Three classes of materials have this property: (a) precursors, such as silane (SiH4), that directly lead to the synthesis of the nanomaterials; (b) photosensitizers, like sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which only absorb and transfer energy to reactants by collisions, without participating in the synthesis reaction; and (c) species that absorb, decompose and react to drive decomposition of other precursors, like ethylene (C2H4) employed to synthesize vanadium oxide.757 The most important advantages of this method include producing nanomaterials with a narrow size distribution and high specific surface area that cannot be made by conventional thermal gas phase methods. Other advantages are no reactor corrosion, no product contamination, and no need for a high temperature furnace, since the hot zone is confined to the region in which gaseous reactants and the laser beam interact; the lack of contact with reactor walls is helpful in generating high purity products. Furthermore, rates of heating and cooling in the method are very high because only the gas, which has a small heat capacity, is heated.755–758 There are also important challenges for widespread use of laser pyrolysis like agglomeration, difficulty in scale up, laser safety issues, and use of relatively expensive laser energy, but the greatest challenge in this method is difficulty in the identification and adoption of efficient and safe precursors, because the precursors for some common materials that are synthesized by laser pyrolysis are dangerous, and alternative precursors are less effective.759Table 10 summarizes and Fig. 102 provides representative TEM images of some nanomaterials that have been synthesized using laser pyrolysis.

2.3.4.1. Silicon-based nanomaterials. 
Cannon, Danforth, Flint, Haggerty, and Mara were the pioneers of the laser pyrolysis synthesis technique.760,761 They first used it to synthesize, silicon, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride. They used silane as the silicon precursor. Because silane can absorb the energy of the laser at 10.6 μm, there was no need to use any additional photosensitizer. In addition, they added ethylene (C2H4) and methane (CH4) to produce silicon carbide or ammonia (NH3) to produce silicon nitride. Both ethylene and ammonia could absorb the energy of the laser, while this was not possible for methane. In their set-up (Fig. 103), the gaseous precursors were introduced through a stainless-steel nozzle with an inner diameter of 1.5 mm. They used an argon stream at 400 sccm as a sheath gas surrounding the precursor inlet, which served not only to confine the gaseous precursors in a small zone, but also to quench the hot products to stop particle growth and limit the particle size. Moreover, a stream of argon at 600 sccm was directed at the KCl windows through which the laser entered the reactor, to cool them and keep them clean. A mechanical pump and throttling valve were used to control the pressure in the system in the range of 1.17 to 14.50 psia. The energy source was a 150 W laser with unfocused intensities from 270 to 1020 W cm−2, from which focused intensities could reach 105 W cm−2. They synthesized highly-pure, monodispersed, spherical, and loosely agglomerated NPs with sizes in the range of 10 to 100 nm and an average crystallite size of about 15 nm (Fig. 102a). Their production rates were about 1 g h−1, and a maximum of about 10 g of NPs was synthesized during a run of the reactor. Increasing the laser power led to production of crystalline silicon NPs rather than amorphous ones. Notably, the fully dense silicon NPs did not possess any surface or internal porosity and were extremely pure with oxygen content below 0.1 wt%. The silicon carbide and silicon nitride NPs were in the ranges of 18–26 and 10–25 nm, respectively.760,761

Decomposition of metal carbonyls such as iron carbonyl (Fe(CO)5), chromium carbonyl (Cr(CO)6), molybdenum carbonyl (Mo(CO)6), and tungsten carbonyl (W(CO)6) using this technique following the pioneering research of Cannon and coworkers demonstrated the versatility of the laser pyrolysis approach for synthesis of various nanomaterials.830
Ehbrecht and Huisken employed time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis for in-flight characterization of silicon nanomaterials synthesized by pulsed laser pyrolysis of silane (SiH4) with a pulse energy of 50 mJ. They observed that the silicon nanomaterials consisted of Sin+ clusters in which n ranged from a few tens to several thousand. When n was between 22 and 100, the intermediate-size Sin clusters fragmented to yield Si6+-Si11+, while single Si+ and Si2+ ions were evaporated from the nanometric silicon clusters when the ionizing laser fluence was sufficiently high. They also observed multiply charged nanoclusters. Moreover, they found that the size of silicon clusters ejected from the pulsed source played a key role in their velocity which enabled use of a mechanical chopper in the path of the cluster beam to select different portions of the products of each pulse, which allowed them to use quasi-size-selected clusters for subsequent experiments.768 Hofmeister et al. employed the same synthesis system and studied the lattice contraction in silicon NPs. They observed that spherical monocrystalline silicon NPs possessed almost no planar lattice defects. The synthesized silicon NPs were covered by thin amorphous oxide shells that resulted in lattice contraction. Lattice contraction decreased with decreasing particle size and oxide thickness. Accordingly, the lattice contractions could be transformed to lattice dilatation of NPs with very small size. HRTEM images and the SAED pattern of these silicon NPs are presented in Fig. 104.769 Ledoux et al. used the same synthesis process and studied the size-dependent photoluminescence characteristics of silicon nanocrystals. They observed that the photoluminescence of the nanocrystalline silicon was in close agreement with a quantum confinement model. They concluded that the intrinsic photoluminescence quantum yield of the nanocrystalline silicon could reach almost 100%. A simple model described the silicon nanocrystal photoluminescence shift with air aging of the samples due to the decreasing size of the nanocrystalline core via self-limiting surface oxidation. The oxide layer covering the core silicon nanocrystals affected the lattice parameter which in turn effected the width of the photoluminescence emission spectrum, along with its peak position. This study was also helpful in explaining an astrophysical phenomenon of extended red emission, which was one of the authors’ goals.770,772,773

Li et al. synthesized silicon NPs below 5 nm in diameter in macroscopic quantities (20–200 mg h−1) with intense visible photoluminescence after etching. They used silane as the main precursor with SF6 as a photosensitizer for more effective decomposition of silane. Hydrogen was used as the sheath gas to confine the reaction zone and was also added to the precursor stream to decrease the silane concentration, while a larger flow of He was used to purge the outer regions of the reactor and keep its windows free of particles. The laser power was 60 W and the pressure of the reaction chamber was typically 8 psia. Reducing the operating pressure below atmospheric pressure decreased the average particle size. They reported control of particle size, crystallinity, and production rate by changing the flow rates of hydrogen and helium to the reactor and by addition of SF6. They studied the effects of hydrogen flow rate in the central precursor flow and helium flow rate on the synthesis process and found that increasing either or both of these parameters decreased the average size of particles. Furthermore, they dispersed the silicon NPs in methanol then etched them with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to reduce the size of particles and passivate the silicon surface. Etching with HF produced particles with intense visible photoluminescence, while the as-synthesized NPs exhibited almost no photoluminescence.774
Cauchetier et al. synthesized Si/C/N nanocomposites by laser pyrolysis using ultrasonic spray delivery of aerosol droplets of hexamethyldisilazane ([(CH3)3Si]2NH) as a low-cost and effective precursor that could absorb the laser at 10.6 μm. They employed a commercially-available ultrasonic spray generator (Pyrosol model from RBI, France) as illustrated in Fig. 105. They used a mixture of argon and ammonia or pure argon as the carrier gas. For the thermal decomposition, they used a 600 W industrial CO2 laser which produced a beam with a diameter of 13 mm. They collected the NPs on a cylindrical stainless-steel filter that was preheated and placed in a glass chamber. The nanocomposites were amorphous with average NP diameters of 30 to 60 nm. In addition, they investigated the effect of various operating parameters on the synthesis process and found that the total gas flow rate played the main role in increasing the NP production rate.780

Herlin-Boime's group also advanced the synthesis of silicon carbide NPs by laser pyrolysis. They used a mixture of silane (SiH4) and ethylene (C2H4) as the precursors. Laser power was 600 W and the pressure was 14.31 psia. The production rate was 3.8 g h−1 and the average size of the synthesized particles was 16.6 nm. Notably, they increased the silane to ethylene ratio in the precursor solution above the stoichiometric ratio to incorporate a slight excess of silicon in the final product to facilitate dispersion of the NPs in water by the generation of surface Si–OH groups. In addition, they broke up agglomerates through magnetic stirring and wet ball-milling of the aqueous NP dispersion followed by slip-casting of slurries to obtain green bodies. They performed densification by spark plasma sintering at a pressure of 70 MPa which produced final densities of up to 96% of the theoretical full density.784 This group also synthesized uniformly carbon-coated silicon nanomaterials from the same precursors using a novel two-stage laser pyrolysis approach. Fig. 106 presents a schematic of their reactor. Silane (SiH4) was introduced to the first reaction zone to synthesize crystalline silicon NPs. They could control the size of silicon nanocrystals by adjusting the flow rate of helium as the diluting gas and focusing the laser. The silicon nanocrystals were delivered to the second reaction zone where the decomposition of ethylene (C2H4), injected after the first reaction zone, produced a carbon shell around the silicon nanocrystals. Notably, they adjusted the laser power between the two reaction zones in a way that ensured crystallinity of the silicon produced in the first zone while the remaining laser power was adequate to drive decomposition of the ethylene in the second zone. They saw no evidence of formation of silicon carbide at the interface of the core and shell. In addition, the synthesis in a single-step continuous process instead of a multi-step batch synthesis reduced the presence of silicon oxide in the final products, which in turn made the nanomaterials promising for lithium-ion battery anode applications. The carbon-coated silicon nanocomposites provided a high and stable capacity because of the protective effect of the carbon shell, which prevented direct contact of the silicon core with the electrolyte.782 In another study, they controlled the experimental conditions to synthesize the amorphous Si@C nanocomposites using the same strategy. Because the silicon nanocrystals used as an anode material were amorphized during the first charge/discharge cycle, which negatively impacted stability, the initially amorphous carbon-coated silicon nanocomposites provided more stable capacity. Notably, they created the carbon shell with a thickness of 1 nm, which was sufficient to prevent oxidation of the amorphous silicon core which is more easily oxidized than crystalline silicon. In doing so, they improved the properties of the nanocomposites for lithium-ion battery applications.783

Hyperdoping, which means doping to concentrations above the nominal equilibrium solubility of the dopant, extends the range of electronic properties that can be obtained from a semiconductor. Rohani et al. employed the laser pyrolysis technique, which is capable of producing strongly non-equilibrium conditions where doping is governed by kinetics instead of thermodynamics, to synthesize spherical boron-hyperdoped silicon NPs with an average size around 25 nm. The precursor mixture was composed of silane (SiH4) and diborane (B2H6). The hyperdoping with boron did not alter the diamond cubic structure of silicon nanocrystals. The hyperdoped NPs exhibited tunable LSPR and were stable in air for long periods (minimum one year). Moreover, the synthesized NPs retained their structure without B segregation upon annealing at up to 600 °C.778
2.3.4.2. Boron-based nanomaterials. 
Boulanger et al. synthesized graphitic boron nitride NPs using laser pyrolysis. The precursor mixture included boron trichloride (BCl3) and ammonia (NH3) which was thermally decomposed by an industrial high-power CO2 laser. They investigated the morphology of the NPs with and without heat treatment at temperatures from 1000 to 1650 °C. The as-synthesized NPs were roughly spherical with concentric graphitic shells and sizes from 20 to above 100 nm. The smaller as-synthesized particles with average sizes of 20 to 50 nm were mainly nested polyhedra that consisted of about 40 concentric shells near the center, and were considered as filled-to-the-center. The larger particles with average sizes above 100 nm consisted of about 10 graphitic layers with large empty spaces in the structures and were considered hollow particles. After thermal treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere at 1100 °C, the same morphology for all particles, with a larger diameter above 200 nm, was observed. Further treatment under the same atmosphere at temperatures of 1400–1650 °C produced nanoplatelets with 10 to 50 graphitic layers and typical lateral dimensions of 50 nm, which were highly stable and remained unchanged for several months.763
Rohani et al. used laser pyrolysis to create boron NPs for use in hydrogen generation by water-splitting (ideally, 2 B + 3 H2O → B2O3 + 3 H2). Among water-reactive metals, boron has the highest theoretical specific capacity for hydrogen generation by reaction with water. To achieve complete reaction of boron, they needed highly-active boron NPs with high purity, small size, and high specific surface area, which can be produced by laser pyrolysis. They used diborane (B2H6) as the precursor and SF6 as the photosensitizer to generate boron NPs. The NPs were oxide free, amorphous, highly pure, air stable, and formed stable dispersion in water and alcohols. Because boron hydrolysis is not a spontaneous reaction, they needed an activator to launch the reaction. Among various possibilities tested, NaH was found to produce the greatest amount of hydrogen. The hydrogen generated by boron hydrolysis was used in a fuel cell, where its performance was very close to that of pure hydrogen from a compressed gas cylinder. Although in this case the total H2 generation did not reach the theoretical stoichiometric limit, it exceeded the theoretical limit for competing materials including silicon and aluminum, and thus shows great promise. These demonstrations also show that no reaction byproducts were generated that would affect the performance of fuel cells.762
2.3.4.3. Carbon-based nanomaterials. 
Herlin et al. employed laser pyrolysis to generate carbon-based nanomaterials from hydrocarbon precursors such as ethylene (C2H4) or butyne (C4H6). They found that by changing the reaction temperature they could synthesize nanomaterials with various characteristics. Amorphous carbon-based materials were produced at temperatures below ∼1200 K. The IR spectra of these materials had a broad continuum absorbance with stronger peaks associated with CC and CH aromatic groups. However, synthesis at higher temperatures resulted concentric microtexture nanomaterials which exhibited only a continuum with negligible features in the IR spectra. They suggested that the hydrogen content played a central role in appearance of these peaks in the more amorphous nanomaterials. They went on to conclude that IR laser pyrolysis synthesis of carbon-based nanomaterials followed a similar mechanism as the generation of carbon dusts in the envelopes of evolved carbon-rich stars.765 This group also investigated the synthesis of highly-aromatic carbon NPs by laser pyrolysis of hydrocarbons as a function of laser power and found that increasing the temperature of the reaction zone by increasing the laser power led to evolution of more turbostratic concentric carbon NPs from poorly organized ones.766
2.3.4.4. Magnetic nanomaterials. 
Bi et al. employed laser pyrolysis to generate iron-containing NPs including α-Fe, Fe3C, and Fe7C3. A schematic of their reactor system is shown in Fig. 107. The iron precursor was iron carbonyl (Fe(CO)5) delivered from a bubbler by a flow of ethylene. Because the ethylene can absorb the laser at 10.6 μm, it served as both photosensitizer and carrier gas and, in the case of carbide particles, as the carbon source as well. They controlled the operating parameters to synthesize NPs with different chemical compositions. Increasing the laser power from 30 to 50 W and the chamber pressure from 1.93 to 5.80 psia while decreasing the nozzle diameter from 1.7 to 0.8 mm resulted in Fe3C rather than α-Fe. Further increasing the laser power from 50 to 54 W, the chamber pressure from 5.80 psi to 9.67 psi, and the flow rate of ethylene from 9 to 25 sccm while decreasing the width of the beam from 1 mm to 0.2 mm produced Fe7C3 instead of Fe3C. The NPs were collected in a Pyrex trap with a stack of ferrite magnets that drew the ferromagnetic particles away from a Teflon membrane filter. Notably, they performed in situ passivation by flowing 4 to 10% oxygen in helium through the collection trap, which avoided spontaneous combustion of the NPs (α-Fe in particular) upon exposure to air. In addition, they placed a thermocouple inside the collection trap to monitor the process and prevent runaway oxidation. The average size of the NPs was in the range of 5 to 30 nm. The production rate for Fe3C7 NPs was about 3 g h−1, illustrating the versatility of the technique for relatively high-rate synthesis of NPs. Flowing excess ethylene led to carbon coating of the Fe3C and Fe7C3 NPs. Moreover, they investigated the magnetic properties of the NPs and found that they were ferromagnetic, rather than superparamagnetic, despite their small size.798

Veintemillas-Verdaguer et al. synthesized crystalline γ-Fe2O3 NPs with a high degree of purity and a low degree of aggregation with an average particle size of ∼5 nm. The precursor was 30% iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) in isopropanol (C3H8O). They nebulized the precursor solution and delivered aerosol droplets to the reaction zone where a 100 W continuous wave CO2 laser beam with a diameter of 4 mm induced decomposition and particle formation. The production rate was in the range of 33 to 96 mg h−1. The product yield, defined as the amount of the NPs synthesized relative to the iron pentacarbonyl delivered, ranged from 12 to 84%. Moreover, they investigated the magnetic properties of the NPs and observed superparamagnetism at ambient temperature with a saturation magnetization of 30.5 emu g−1. The size of the NPs played a substantial role in their magnetic characteristics, especially for particles below 10 nm in diameter. For such NPs, enhanced coercivity could arise from extra anisotropy in addition to magentocrystalline anisotropy due to the high surface to volume ratio.810 This group used the colloidal suspensions of iron oxide NPs as contrast agents in MRI after coating them with dextran (C8H32O16) in an aqueous sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7) solution. The magnetic properties and 1H NMR relaxation times of the suspensions demonstrated their potential as contrast agents for MRI. They found that the greatest saturation magnetization was observed for the largest particles with the largest crystallite size, although all cases exhibited superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature.811 In another study, this group used metallic iron NPs synthesized by laser pyrolysis in addition to the iron oxide NPs as contrast agents for MRI applications after formulating them as biocompatible ferrofluids. For laser pyrolysis synthesis of iron oxide NPs, they flowed air together with argon to clean the ZnSe windows, while they performed slight oxidation by flowing nitrogen with 1 ppm of oxygen in the case of metallic iron NPs, which led to the synthesis of stable metal core particles with high crystallinity, covered by a thin oxide layer. Accordingly, they produced a stable ferrofluid of the sub-10 nm metal particles in aggregates of about 50 nm. The metallic iron NPs provided greater saturation magnetization and susceptibility than the iron oxide-based suspensions. In addition to increasing crystal size, using metallic iron NPs instead of iron oxide was a key factor in increasing the relaxivity value, the key parameter for MRI contrast.799 In addition, they compared the iron NPs covered by a thin layer of iron oxide with commercially available iron oxide in MRI applications in small animals and found that the laser pyrolysis synthesized samples produced a “negative” contrast enhancement of 60% in the liver compared to the commercially available iron oxide contrast agent, demonstrating their advantages as a contrast agent for liver and spleen MRI.800 They also investigated the mechanism of dextran adsorption on the surface of Fe2O3 NPs synthesized by laser pyrolysis and compared the strength of bonding in the case of laser pyrolysis synthesis with coprecipitation synthesis. They found that the favored mechanism is the collective hydrogen bonding between the iron oxide surface and dextran hydroxyl groups. They observed a strong bond between the iron oxide NPs and dextran in the case of heating dry samples of the suspensions of laser-pyrolysis-synthesized samples, while such a bond was not observed in the samples produced by a solution-phase coprecipitation approach. This difference led to better dispersion of the laser pyrolysis derived samples. Accordingly, they suggested that the coating of dextran on the surface of iron NPs is more effective for samples synthesized at higher temperatures and shorter times, which resulted in permanent dextran linkage to the particles.812 Furthermore, this group performed acid treatment with nitric acid (HNO3) on iron oxide NPs with sizes below 5 nm synthesized by laser pyrolysis to increase the saturation magnetization by 40% and enhance the initial susceptibility. Additionally, the optimized acid treatment led to a decrease in the aggregate size, increase in surface charge density, and improved colloidal stability.815
A laser pyrolysis synthesis of nickel NPs was presented by Swihart and coworkers. They used nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) as the main precursor. Although nickel carbonyl has a high vapor pressure and its decomposition will lead to the synthesis of pure nickel NPs, it is very toxic which limits its safe use as a gaseous precursor. To circumvent this issue, they used in situ generation of nickel carbonyl by flowing CO through hydrogen-regenerated nickel powder in a tube furnace. Fig. 108 presents a schematic of their experimental set-up. A helium gas stream was used as a sheath gas to confine the reaction zone. Because the nickel carbonyl cannot absorb the laser at 10.6 μm, a photosensitizer is necessary. Very high specific surface area NPs with a mean diameter of less than 10 nm are prone to oxidization upon exposure to air. Hence, larger particles were targeted to study the effects of parameters on the size and morphology. However, because smaller NPs with the size less than 10 nm have the most interesting magnetic behavior, they also synthesized smaller particles. The NPs were loosely agglomerated and dispersible in nonpolar solvents, but did not form long-term stable colloidal dispersions. They studied the effect of CO flow rate, inert gas, photosensitizer, and precursor concentration on the synthesis process. Additionally, they studied the magnetic properties of nickel NPs. They reported the flow rate of carbon monoxide changes the nickel carbonyl concentration, delivery rate, and flow patterns in the reactor. The choice of inert gas affects the reaction time and appearance of a visible flame in the reaction zone. They used both SF6 and C2H4 as photosensitizers and found that although a high flow rate of SF6 led to high reaction temperature, it caused fluoride and sulfur contamination in the product. Use of C2H4 as the photosensitizer led to a change of morphology and crystal structure and eliminated sulfur and fluorine contamination. Finally, they found that laser pyrolysis synthesized nickel NPs with a size below 8 nm exhibit superparamagnetism.816

2.3.4.5. Titanium-based nanomaterials. 
Simon et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped titanium monoxide in a single-step laser pyrolysis process. They used liquid titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) as the precursor, which was atomized by a Pyrosol system and delivered to the reaction zone by nitrogen carrier gas, which had a much lower thermal diffusivity and led to better confinement of the reactants compared to helium. They supplied a low flow of ammonia (NH3) just before the outlet of the injecting nozzle to serve as both photosensitizer and nitrogen source. They increased the residence time in the reaction zone by reducing the total flow rates of gaseous streams, to increase decomposition of the reactants and generate reducing species from ammonia decomposition to incorporate nitrogen atoms as a dopant in the NPs. The laser power was 1 kW and a production rate of 1.44 g h−1 was obtained from 6.35 g h−1 of the titanium precursor. The product particles had the rock-salt crystal structure and an average size of 7 to 9 nm. Doping with nitrogen led to enhanced photocatalytic activity by reducing the optical band gap into the visible range of the solar spectrum. Notably, the as-synthesized nanopowder contained carbon, which was obvious from its black color, but it could be removed by mild heat treatment in air. Such heat treatment also partially or fully converted the rock-salt structure to the anatase phase by oxidation to a stoichiometry closer to TiO2.789
Herlin-Boime's group synthesized TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposites by in situ and ex situ processes based on laser pyrolysis. For the in situ synthesis, they mixed titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4) with MWCNT dispersed in toluene (C7H8) to make a precursor solution for a single-step laser pyrolysis synthesis by “on-flight” growth of titania NPs on the surface of MWCNT. In separate experiments they used titanium tetraisopropoxide as the precursor to synthesize titania NPs by laser pyrolysis and mixed the product powder with MWCNT to prepare ex situ formed TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposites. As evident in Fig. 109, in the case of in situ synthesis, the coating of titania on the MWCNT was highly dense so that there was almost no bare MWCNT surface, while ex situ mixing produced only partial coating of titania on the surface of MWCNT. The in situ synthesis by laser pyrolysis improved the electronic interactions between the two components of the nanocomposites. Moreover, the MWCNT dispersion in the titania NPs was significantly enhanced in the in situ synthesis. The titania, in situ TiO2/MWCNT, and ex situ TiO2/MWCNT had average diameters of 12, 13, and 12 nm and surface areas of 122, 166, and 120 m2 g−1, respectively. They employed the laser pyrolysis synthesized nanomaterials for solar cell applications and found that using in situ synthesized TiO2/MWCNT nanocomposites as the active layer in porous photoelectrodes led to a 20% improvement in the efficiency of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells because of a higher short-circuit current density compared to the result using ex situ synthesized ones. Reduced charge recombination and the intimate electronic interaction between the NPs and nanotubes enhanced the charge extraction to the photoelectrode.792

Herlin-Boime's group synthesized pure titania, nitrogen-doped titania, gold-doped titania, and gold-modified nitrogen-doped titania NPs following the laser pyrolysis synthesis procedures they developed for the other titania-containing NPs and investigated their photocatalytic activity. They used titanium tetraisopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), and ammonia (NH3) as the precursors. They monitored the destruction of formic acid (HCOOH) under UV and visible light irradiation to test the photocatalytic activity of the various laser pyrolysis synthesized NPs and compared them with one another and with commercially available titania. They reported that all the laser pyrolysis synthesized samples showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to commercially available titania under UV irradiation. In addition, the laser pyrolysis synthesized samples with even very low content of gold performed better than pure titania in the degradation of formic acid under UV light. Finally, they observed that the gold-modified nitrogen-doped titania samples exhibited superior photocatalytic activity under visible light compared to the nitrogen-doped titania samples.790
Scarisoreanu et al. employed a single-step laser pyrolysis technique to produce TiO2/SnO2 nanocomposites. They used two bubblers to separately deliver titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and tin tetrachloride (SnCl4) as precursors and carried them into the reaction zone in a mixture of argon and air to facilitate their oxidization. Because none of these streams could absorb the energy of the CO2 laser at 10.6 μm, they introduced ethylene (C2H4) as a photosensitizer. They produced nanocomposites with various tin concentrations from 1.1 to 4.8 at%. The nanocomposites contained both anatase and rutile titania, but anatase was the major component. The average crystallite sizes were in the range of 8 to 22 nm. They investigated the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites for degradation of methyl orange under UV irradiation and found that the nanocomposites with tin atomic concentrations in the range of 1.8 to 4.8% exhibited greater photoactivity compared to commercially available titania powder, and all the nanocomposites possessed a lower band gap energy.797
2.3.4.6. Zinc-based nanomaterials. 
In recent work, we have developed a low-cost ultrasonic atomizer that enabled us to spray any stable precursor solution into the reaction zone for the synthesis of nanomaterials with various compositions. A schematic of the ultrasonic atomizer is presented in Fig. 110a. We synthesized an array of zinc containing NPs including zinc oxide, pristine zinc sulfide, nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide, and zinc fluoride. To synthesize zinc oxide, zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) was dissolved in deionized water as the precursor solution. Because this precursor cannot absorb the energy of the laser, we introduced SF6 as a photosensitizer. The uniform zinc oxide NPs had the wurtzite crystalline structure and sizes below 10 nm. Increasing the flow rate of SF6 and the laser power led to production of zinc fluoride NPs using the same precursor solution. Further tuning of the operating parameters led to formation of zinc fluoride NPs with two different morphologies: spherical and rod-like. To synthesize NPs with rod-like shape, we increased the laser power and the SF6 flow rate compared to the conditions used to produce spherical NPs. In addition, the sheath gas used for the former case was hydrogen instead of nitrogen, which led to more rapid quenching because of its higher thermal conductivity. To synthesize pristine zinc sulfide, we added thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) to the aqueous solution of zinc acetate dihydrate and sprayed it into the reaction zone, which led to production of zinc sulfide NPs with sphalerite crystalline structure and sizes below 10 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution compared to the other vapor-phase synthesized nanomaterials. Adding thiourea (NH2CSNH2) instead of thioacetamide to the zinc acetate dihydrate aqueous solution resulted the formation of nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide NPs which had a narrower band gap compared to the pristine zinc sulfide, potentially extending their photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. By adjusting the operating parameters, we were able to synthesize nitrogen-doped zinc sulfide with different combinations of crystalline structures: sphalerite- and wurtzite-rich. Because the synthesis of the wurtzite crystalline structure requires higher temperature in the reaction zone compared to the synthesis of sphalerite, we increased the flow rate of SF6 and the laser power for this purpose. The relatively low vapor pressure of thiourea led to the formation of microspheres by a droplet-to-particle conversion mechanism rather than by gas-to-particle conversion as observed for the other materials. The morphologies of the various synthesized zinc-containing NPs are presented in Fig. 110b–g. All in all, the newly-developed low-cost ultrasonic atomizer should extend the utility of the laser pyrolysis by expanding the array of precursors that can be used with low-power, widely available CO2 laser sources.818

2.3.4.7. Instrumentation and modelling. 
Kruis et al. developed a simple model to describe the evolution of particle size, morphology, and number concentration during simultaneous sintering and coagulation in an aerosol flow reactor that neglected the polydispersity of primary and aggregated NPs. They considered the effect of irregular/fractal structure on the collision kernel from the free molecular to the continuum regime. This simple model was in good agreement with a computationally-demanding two-dimensional sectional model for the aggregates with respect to both the specific surface area and the primary particle volume. They applied the model to the synthesis of silicon from silane (SiH4) in a laser pyrolysis reactor. They found that grain boundary diffusion was the main coalescence mechanism for the silicon NPs, based upon their theoretical evaluation of different sintering mechanisms. Moreover, the model showed that growth of primary particles through sintering was possible at temperatures well below the melting point. The results from the model were in reasonable agreement with experimental data for the primary particle sizes, suggesting that the sintering process was accurately represented. Notably, they accounted for the production of smaller and more aggregated silicon NPs produced by the laser pyrolysis based on the assumption that the outer boundaries of the laser-heated region were cooled and diluted by the surrounding unheated sheath gas.831
Bomatí-Miguel et al. employed a simple coagulation model to simulate the synthesis of NPs by laser pyrolysis. The model had only the coagulation time as a tunable parameter. They considered the laser pyrolysis synthesis of iron NPs as a case study, for which they collected substantial experimental data. They applied the model to find operating conditions that maximized productivity as function of particle size. They found that the pressure and the carrier gas flow were the main factors determining productivity for larger NPs with mean diameter above 20 nm, while the vapor pressure of the precursor (temperature of delivery system) played the main role in determining productivity for smaller NPs with diameters below 20 nm.832
Mwakikunga derived two equations to describe their experimental observations for the flame temperature trends based upon laser power and laser wavelength in laser pyrolysis synthesis using spray-based precursor delivery. They considered the thermal decomposition of tungsten ethoxide (C12H30O6W) and vanadium ethoxide (C6H15O4V) aerosols through CO2 laser pyrolysis as case studies. The first equation, to find the flame temperature trend as a function of laser power, was extended from the original Haggerty–Cannon energy balance equation.833 The Haggerty–Cannon equation equates the energy absorbed from the laser beam to the total energies used to raise the aerosol temperature and initiate the chemical reactions plus energy losses through radiation, convection, and conduction. Based upon this equation, they concluded that the conversion of the precursors into product nanostructures was driven by a small fraction of the overall laser power, which was in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, they attempted to precisely identify the formation enthalpies and heat capacities through both modelling and experiment results, obtaining surprisingly low values of the heat capacities of the droplets, with ethanol as the solvent. This paper raises interesting questions about assumptions of thermal equilibrium during the laser pyrolysis process that merit further consideration.834
Dang and Swihart developed a fully-coupled two-dimensional model to investigate the laser pyrolysis synthesis of silicon NPs from silane. The model included laser heating, fluid dynamics, gas phase and surface phase chemical reactions, and aerosol dynamics (NP transport and evolution through convection, diffusion, nucleation, surface growth, thermophoresis, and coagulation processes). They simulated the aerosol dynamics using a moment method, assuming a lognormal particle size distribution, and using a sectional model and compared the results from these two methods. They found that although only the sectional model was able to predict the local bimodal size distribution occurring at some points within the reactor, the moment method was able to predict the final product characteristics as well as the sectional method at much lower computational cost. They also performed a parametric study to find the influence of various operating parameters such as laser intensity, gas phase composition, inlet gas velocity, and the concentration of precursor on the final product characteristics. They observed that increasing the temperature of the reaction zone resulted in an increase in the size of the NPs as well as silane conversion. Also, increasing the inlet gas velocity led to a decrease in the size of NPs and silane conversion due to the shorter residence time in the hot zone of the reactor. Moreover, increasing the concentration of hydrogen reduced both gas phase and surface reaction rates. Accordingly, it reduced the rate of particles formation and thus had a similar effect to an increase in the gas inlet velocity. Furthermore, they investigated the effects of the interconnected mechanisms on the synthesis of NPs. They reported that variation in the reaction conditions for different pathways through the three-dimensional reactor domain played the main role in determining size polydispersity and creating non-lognormal overall size distributions.835 In another study, they considered three sub-models to develop the simulation method: (i) They modeled the chemically reacting flow inside the reactor spatially with full geometric detail, without the consideration of aerosol dynamics, and with highly-simplified chemistry. (ii) Then, they employed an axisymmetric two-dimensional CFD model to describe the reaction zone, in which the results from the first step were used to find the boundary conditions. (iii) Finally, the synthesis of silicon NPs was investigated through a two-dimensional aerosol dynamics model by the consideration of more complete silane decomposition chemistry, along with the velocities and temperatures obtained from the second step. They employed a bivariate model to simulate the particle size evolution and morphology, and a moment model, based upon a lognormal particle volume distribution. Moreover, CFD simulation to incorporate the fluid dynamics data into the aerosol model made it appropriate for applications with complex reactor geometries. The model predicted that spherical NPs were generated at high temperature at the center of the reaction zone, followed by aggregation downstream of the reaction zone to generate non-spherical larger aggregates. In addition, they reported that thermophoresis plays a crucial role in the laser pyrolysis synthesis process because the small volume heated at the intersection of the laser beam and photosensitizer inlet stream resulted in steep temperature gradients.836 While most of these dynamics are similar to those observed in flame synthesis, the laser pyrolysis process combines some aspects of both a premixed flame, with energy deposition across the radius of the hot zone with aspects of a diffusion flame, with steep radial temperature gradients, and thus has some unique features.

3. Conclusions
In this review, we classified vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods into three categories based on the chemical similarity between the initial precursors and final products: (a) physically-based vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods in which the chemical structure of the initial precursors and final products are similar, including inert gas condensation, spark discharge generation, and pulsed laser ablation. These methods use direct heating, electrical discharges, intense laser light, or other methods to vaporize the precursor and then nucleate NPs of the same material or a simple compound of it. Generally, synthesis of highly-pure nanomaterials is the main benefit of these approaches and the limitations on the batch size or production rate per unit time are the major shortcomings of these approaches; (b) plasma processing nanosynthesis methods which can use precursors that are chemically similar to the final product, or molecular precursors that are quite different from the final product. Within this class, we distinguish between cases in which the precursors are injected into or downstream of a high-temperature plasma with thermal equilibrium between the electrons and ionized gas, and those using non-thermal plasmas in which the electrons have much higher temperatures than the ionized gas. In general, rapid heating and cooling rate in plasma is the main advantage of these approaches, while the need for complex equipment is the major barrier to broader use of these methods; (c) chemically-based vapor-phase nanosynthesis methods in which the initial precursors possess a different chemical structure compared to the final products include chemical vapor condensation, spray pyrolysis, flame-based aerosol synthesis, and laser pyrolysis. In each of these methods, a vapor or liquid droplets containing molecular (usually metalorganic or metal salt) precursors are decomposed following energy input, from furnace walls, a flame, or a laser. High production rate is a key advantage of many of these methods, while complex mechanisms and difficulty in achieving a high degree of purity can be limitations in these processes. In addition to the brief introduction of each method and the summarization of interesting nanomaterials produced using them, we described in detail some of the highest-impact studies that have been published about these methods, highlighting the corresponding applications of the nanomaterials produced.
Overall, although solution-phase methods of nanomaterial synthesis, including hydrothermal, solvothermal, sol–gel, and related processes play a dominant role in the scientific literature on nanomaterial synthesis, vapor-phase routes can provide a very fruitful alternative that can dramatically reduce the use of solvents and generation of waste, and that can be conducted in a steady-state continuous operation mode that is typical of industrial chemical processing. The present review aims to demonstrate the wide range of possibilities and of materials that can be prepared by these vapor-phase routes. While it is extensive, it is by no means comprehensive, and many more worthwhile studies have been published. For each synthesis route, and particularly for the more complex ones including plasma processes, flame processes, and laser-driven processes, there is much room remaining for both advances in fundamental understanding that will enable predictive modelling and scale-up, and for creative application to new materials and, especially, material combinations produced in a single-step continuous process.
Despite the decades of development described in this review, many opportunities for further advances in vapor-phase synthesis remain. Rapid advances in computer science and simulation methods, along with increasing computational power are improving our ability predict the formation of NPs in vapor-phase techniques using advanced modelling techniques. These advances move the field ever closer to the elusive ability to fully model industrial-scale processes that couple turbulent reactive flow and steep temperature and concentration gradients with NP nucleation, growth, aggregation, and coalescence, linking processes over many orders of magnitude in length and time scales. At the same time, new experimental developments are expanding the ability of researchers and practitioners to adopt these vapor-phase synthesis approaches. For example, we recently combined the ultrasonic atomization technique with laser pyrolysis to demonstrate a low-cost, green, and single-step route to synthesize fluorine-containing compounds with interesting properties.818 This is only a representative example of how the combination of techniques, in this case spray pyrolysis (using aerosol delivery of one precursor), CVC (using vapor-phase delivery of another precursor), and laser pyrolysis (using laser heating) can provide routes to synthesize new materials with interesting properties for existing and emerging applications. Similarly, advances in preparation of multi-component nanomaterials, particularly in the realm of catalysis, provide abundant opportunities for developing both materials and processes.31,837 Multi-stage aerosol processes, like the two-stage laser pyrolysis method of Herlin-Boime and co-workers (Fig. 106)782 and the two-stage non-thermal plasma reactor of Mangolini and co-workers354 provide new opportunities to further tailor multicomponent materials in vapor-phase synthesis. Hard- and soft-templating strategies and ligand-capping strategies developed for solution-phase synthesis methods can be brought into the gas phase, particularly in spray pyrolysis and related methods that involve droplet-to-particle conversion. Numerous other combinations of synthesis techniques can similarly open up opportunities to produce new and interesting nanomaterials, and to economically scale up the production of these materials to achieve economical and societal impact.
List of definitions
Agglomeration: agglomeration is the process in which NPs collide and adhere to one another relatively weakly, forming “soft” aggregates that can be simply broken through mechanical forces.838,839
Aggregation: aggregation is the process in which NPs collide and adhere to one another strongly, via interfacial reaction or partial coalescence, to form larger and relatively dense aggregates.838 It depends on both particle transport mechanisms and interfacial chemical reactions.840
Annealing: annealing is a heat treatment process usually applied to reduce crystal defects and/or increase ductility and malleability.841 Annealing is usually done an inert atmosphere.
Calcination: calcination is a heat treatment often intended to increase the crystallinity of NPs and remove impurities on their surface.842 It is generally done in an oxidizing atmosphere.
Coalescence: coalescence is a process in which merging and mixing of particles leads to homogeneous NPs.843 Liquid droplets always coalesce upon collision, but solid NPs may also coalesce at temperatures below their melting point. Partial coalescence leads to the formation of hard aggregates.27
Coagulation: coagulation can be taken as synonymous with agglomeration as defined above.844 Coagulation leads to the formation of loose agglomerates.27
Droplet-to-particle conversion: droplet-to-particle conversion is the dominant mechanism for the synthesis of NPs when aerosol droplets of precursor solutions react to form product particles without evaporating.818 It leads to relatively large, spherical particles, which may be hollow or porous.
Fragmentation: fragmentation is the process of breaking of aggregates into smaller clusters.845
Gas-to-particle conversion: gas-to-particle conversion is the dominant mechanism for forming NPs from gaseous precursors or when aerosol droplets of precursor solutions first evaporate and then react in the gas phase.818
Nucleation: nucleation is a self-limiting process that relieves supersaturation (thermodynamic driving force for phase change) by spontaneous formation of new particles.846,847
Primary particles: the small quasi-spherical particles that initially form by gas-to-particle conversion or that make up aggregates.
Sintering: sintering, in the context of material processing, is the compacting of the particles to form a solid mass through heat and/or pressure without melting.848 However, in the context of NP synthesis, it is often used as a synonym for coalescence.
Surface growth: surface growth is an irreversible process in which particles grow by condensation or reaction of vapor-phase species on their surface.849 It tends to yield equal growth rates for particles of all sizes, and thus narrows the relative width of the particle size distribution.
Self-assembly: self-assembly is the process of spontaneous organization of nanoscale building blocks into ordered structures.850
Thermophoresis: thermophoresis is a phenomenon in which a macroscopic temperature gradient drives transport of aerosol particles from a higher to lower temperature region.851
