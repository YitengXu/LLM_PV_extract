    , Accepted 9th January 2017First published on 9th January 2017AbstractPower conversion efficiency (PCE) has surpassed 10% for single junction organic solar cells (OSCs) mainly through the design and synthesis of novel donor materials, the optimization of film morphology and the evolution of the devices. However, the development of novel acceptor materials is relatively sluggish compared with the donor compounds. Nowadays, fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM and PC71BM, are still the dominant acceptors due to their superior charge transporting properties. Unfortunately, these two acceptors suffer from some intrinsic shortcomings such as limited absorption, difficult functionalization, and high production cost. Therefore, developing novel non-fullerene acceptors that can overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages is highly desirable. As a matter of fact, research on non-fullerene acceptors has made considerable progress in the last two years and a highest PCE of around 12% has been achieved. In this review, we will summarize recent research progress in non-fullerene small molecule acceptors and compare these molecules' performances in OSCs employing the same donor materials. Moreover, the acceptors with excellent photovoltaic performance are highlighted and the reasons are elaborated. Finally, the implications and the challenges are proposed.

Introduction
During the past two decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their several advantages such as light weight, low cost, easy processing, and charming flexibility.1–4 Generally, an OSC device is a sandwiched structure containing two electrode layers and an active layer in the middle. Normally, an active layer consists of one donor (p-type semiconductor) material and one acceptor (n-type semiconductor) compound.5 Recently, ternary solar cells containing three components within the active layer and tandem solar cells have also been employed and demonstrated to be efficient strategies to improve the performance.6–11 In order to further enhance the performance of OSCs, an appropriate electron-transporting layer and a hole-transporting layer are usually involved. In the past few decades, through designing and exploiting novel donor/acceptor materials for the active layer and finding more efficient electron and hole transporting materials12,13 as well as the optimization of film morphology,14–16 the efficiency of OSCs has increased gradually. In particular, in the last few years, the efficiency of single junction OSCs has passed 10% thanks to the great contribution from the unimaginable development of novel p-type semiconductor materials with broad light absorption, low band gaps, high hole mobilities and finely-tuned electronic energy levels.17–20 These achievements strongly encourage scientists to push the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to a higher value. Although donor materials have been well developed, the research progress for novel acceptors is relatively slower.
Nowadays, almost all the efficient OSCs still employ fullerene derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) as the electron acceptors due to their superior charge transporting properties. In addition, various efficient acceptors (e.g. ICBA) based on fullerene derivatives are also synthesized.21–23 Nevertheless, these acceptors suffer from some intrinsic shortcomings including their limited absorption of the solar spectrum, difficult functionalization to modify their energy level and absorption, comparatively high production cost, air degradation issues24 and bad mechanical properties due to film brittleness.25–27 Therefore, developing novel alternative acceptors, which can not only overcome the above-mentioned issues, but also mimic the superior electron transporting behaviour of fullerene, is highly desirable. As a matter of fact, during the past several years, the research on non-fullerene acceptors has progressed rapidly and PCEs of over 9% have been achieved.28–30 Recently, PCE performances of even up to 12% have been obtained.31 However, there are still no clear guidelines to design and synthesize novel efficient non-fullerene acceptors. Thus, in this review, we aim to compare the performance of the as-reported non-fullerene acceptors based on the different types of conjugated polymer donors and try to provide some useful clues for further development in this area.
There are several points that have been mentioned in this review.
(1) This review mainly focuses on the research progress of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors in the past two years and will not cover polymer-based non-fullerene acceptors. For more detailed information about non-fullerene acceptors, the readers can refer to the previously-reported reviews.32–36 Note that all data summarized in the tables of this review are the average values.
(2) All the non-fullerene acceptors are categorized and discussed based on the same donor materials. The hypothesis for this classification is that the acceptors with different structures may share some common features by employing the same donor, although different non-fullerene acceptors might exhibit superior or inferior photovoltaic performance. Such a comparison should be much easier for readers to find more guidelines to develop their own acceptors or enhance the performance of the existing non-fullerene acceptors through modification.

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with P3HT as the donor
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been extensively used as a donor polymer in OPV research due to its relative stability, easy scalability and straightforward synthesis.37–39 In addition, P3HT possesses good charge transport properties, well-studied morphology, potential application in a large area, and roll to roll printed solar cells.40–42 Therefore, in this section, we discuss non-fullerene acceptors (Fig. 1) by using P3HT as the donor material.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the non-fullerene acceptors using P3HT as the donor. 
Pei and co-workers designed and synthesized a novel electron acceptor FFI-1 based on a fluoranthene-fused imide scaffold with a CN functional group43 (entry 1, Table 1). The study of the physicochemical properties of this acceptor indicates that it has a suitable LUMO energy of −3.5 eV, matching well with the donor material P3HT. After thermal annealing, the OSC device exhibits a PCE value of 1.86%, with a Voc value of 0.76 V, which is much higher than the value (0.58 V) obtained by the referenced P3HT:PC61BM device. The low PCE might result mainly from the extremely limited absorption (300–450 nm) of the acceptor. Further modification of the molecule structure and the optimization of the device structure can improve the PCE to 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively.44,45 Wudl and co-workers synthesized another interesting non-fullerene acceptor D99′BF based on a 9,9′-bifluorenylidene aromatic polycyclic structure.46,47 It is found out that the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene building block is especially good in stabilizing a negative charge resulting from both the steric and electronic effects because after accepting one electron, the tension force for the planar structure can be relieved and hence it possesses aromatic properties. Meanwhile, through changing the functional groups on the aromatic periphery, the LUMO energy level for this acceptor can be readily modified. This acceptor exhibits a surprisingly high Voc of 1.10 V and finally a moderate PCE value of 1.7% with P3HT. Wudl and his co-workers also reported a symmetric electron-deficient decacyclene-based triimide acceptor DTI.48,49 DTI works well with various donor materials and shows PCEs ranging from 0.75% to 1.47% and the low PCE results are partially ascribed to the low fill factors.

In 2013, Zhao, Pei and their co-workers reported one PDI dimer acceptor PDI-6 with spirobifluorene linkers in the bay position. As a matter of fact, they also introduced other linkers such as thienyl and phenyl and investigated their PCE performance with the donor P3HT. It turned out that the device based on PDI-6 showed the best PCE of 2.3% with an inverted cell configuration, which might be ascribed to the suppression of self-aggregation of PDI when it formed a non-planar, 3D twisted structure.50 These results show just some pioneering non-fullerene acceptors based on the exotic structures.
Recently, a non-fullerene acceptor PMI-F-PMI based on a fluorene-centered perylene monoimide dimer has been developed (Fig. 1). Its optimal OSC performance with P3HT as the donor is up to 2.14% with a high Voc value of 0.98 eV thanks to its higher LUMO energy level of about −3.5 eV51 (entry 5, Table 1). Zhan and co-workers reported one new non-fullerene acceptor NMI-3 based on the indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene unit as a core and two naphthalimide building blocks as terminal ends.52 A physicochemical study indicates that this molecule shows the main absorption between 400 nm and 550 nm and has an appropriate LUMO energy level of −3.68 eV, which matches well with the P3HT donor. Their blend film exhibits the best PCE result of 2.29% after thermal annealing. In 2016, the Aso group developed a series of non-fullerene acceptors based on benzothiadiazole and arenedicarboximides with the LUMO energy of about −3.3 eV. The best OSC result for Ph-MH is up to 1.91%.53 In this work, the authors systematically study the surface free energy of the film by measuring the London dispersion (γd) value. As shown in Fig. 2, there is a linear relationship between Jsc and γd. With the increased γd value, the film morphology gradually changes from the edge-on ordered state to a more face-on state, which will be beneficial for charge transportation. This behaviour corresponds well to the PCE result obtained by Ph-ME with a maximum value of 1.91%. In the same year, the same group reported another two acceptors, NTz-Np and BTz-Np.54 The highest PCE result (2.71%) is obtained for NTz-Np compared with 1.51% for BTz-Np, indicating that the NTz unit can be categorized as a potential electron-deficient unit for constructing non-fullerene molecules. In 2016, Cabanetos's group synthesized one acceptor DPP-Pht2 based on two electron-withdrawing groups phthalimides and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).55 This acceptor shows strong absorption between 500 and 650 nm and the LUMO energy level is −4.13 eV. Its blending film with P3HT displays the highest PCE value (about 3.00%) with the ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag device structure, which is the best result among DPP-based small molecular acceptor materials.

Although several non-fullerene acceptors that adopt imide electron-withdrawing groups as the terminal groups and various different cores as building blocks have been reported, their photovoltaic efficiencies are generally around 2% or 3%. The low PCE performance is mainly due to the low Jsc (<6 mA cm−2) resulting from limited absorption for these acceptors or overlapping absorption with P3HT and FF (<0.5) values. In addition, the electron mobilities for all these molecules are all below 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which may also account for the low PCE result.
Recently, Sauvé and co-workers reported one interesting acceptor bis[2,6-diphenylethynyl-1,3,7,9-tetraphenyl-azadipyrromethene] zinc(II) Zn(WS3)2, in which there were two highly twisted azadipyrromethene planes pointing in four directions56 (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4, this compound shows an intense absorption band ranging from 580 to 800 nm, which is complementary to P3HT, and the suitable low-lying LUMO and HOMO levels (about −3.85 and −5.60 eV) make it a potential candidate to be used as an OSC acceptor material. Actually, the optimized Zn(WS3)2:P3HT blend film yields a PCE value of around 4.0% with inverted structure glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT:Zn(WS3)2/MoO3/Ag while the PCE is only 3.7% for the controlled device of PC61BM:P3HT. This work shows that organic-metal coordinated complexes may have great potential for use as alternative non-fullerene acceptors (entry 10, Table 1).

Chen and his co-workers firstly reported the study of a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecule acceptor SF-DPPEH, in which four DPP moieties are covalently and orthogonally linked through a spirobifluorene (SF) core.57 It has suitable LUMO and HOMO energies of −3.60 eV and −5.26 eV, respectively. Its absorption spectrum is similar to those of most DPP-based small molecules with a localized band between 500 and 650 nm. The SF-DPPEH:P3HT blending film has a PCE value of 3.63% with a high Voc of 1.10 V. After further study of the film morphology, the author concludes that the moderate crystallization of acceptors, the appropriate phase separation on the nanoscale (20–30 nm), and the less geminate recombination account for the improved PCE result of SF-DPPEH. Interestingly, the same group synthesizes another acceptor SF(DPPB)4 with a similar structure by only adding one more phenyl group to the terminal unit and this molecule shows a surprising PCE value of 5.1% after thermal annealing treatment, which is much higher than that (3.14%) obtained from the referenced group by using PC61BM as the acceptor.58 By comparing the absorption of two acceptors, SF-DPPEH and SF(DPPB)4, SF(DPPB)4 has a more red-shifted absorption spectrum in the range of 500–700 nm for the films that complements with the main absorption of P3HT (400 nm to 650 nm) as displayed in Fig. 5a, which will contribute to an improved short current from 6.96 mA cm−2 to 8.29 mA cm−2. As a matter of fact, from the EQE curve in Fig. 5b, the SF(DPPB)4 indeed has much stronger EQE values compared with SF-DPPEH between 650 nm and 700 nm. In addition, SF(DPPB)4 has a more balanced μe/μh value of about 1.2, which may be responsible for the improvement of the FF value from 0.48 to 0.55. Moreover, SF(DPPB)4 shows high stability compared with PC61BM and almost has a steady PCE result after 3 h thermal treatment.

Following the same idea, the Chen group designed and synthesized another two acceptors SF-OR and SF-ORCN using rhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine as the terminal electron-deficient units.59 The physicochemical study indicates that both acceptors exhibit the main absorption band between 400 and 550 nm and a suitable energy level of around −3.3 eV. Despite the overlapped absorption spectrum with P3HT, the blending films for both acceptors show best PCE results higher than 4.4%, a Voc of up to 0.90 V and a FF of 0.63 with device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO NPs/Al while the controlled acceptor PC61BM only has a PCE value of 3.55%.
By changing the core structure of fluorene to tetraphenylethylene, the acceptor 4D was obtained and showed the best PCE result of 3.86%.60 It is worth noting that the as-obtained Voc (∼1.20 V) is among the highest value for DPP-based non-fullerene acceptors. However, compared with SF(DPPB)4, TPE-DPP4 only exhibits a best PCE value of about 2.5%.61 The Jsc decreases sharply from 8.29 mA cm−2 to 4.45 mA cm−2 and the FF also shows slight reduction from 0.55 to 0.47. Cao and co-workers firstly developed one star-shaped non-fullerene acceptor P1 based on a triphenylamine core and an isoindigo unit. Unfortunately, this molecule only shows a poor PCE value (about 0.8%).62 Therefore, based on these results, the DPP unit appears to be a promising building block to construct novel small molecule acceptors, partially due to the facile synthesis, long wavelength absorption, and low-lying LUMO levels. In addition, using a 3D structure is a potential strategy to inhibit aggregation and further improve the photovoltaic performance.
Except the 3D structure acceptor, some non-fullerene acceptors with A–D–A are also reported. As showed in Fig. 6, the acceptor DBS-2DDP with a sila-fluorene core and two DPP units as wings are developed and its BHJ devices blended with P3HT result in a PCE of 2.05%63 (entry 17, Table 1). AFM images show that the film has interpenetrating networks with long fibrils (20 nm in diameter), suggesting the desirable phase separation. By replacing the sila-fluorene core with a carbazole unit, acceptor N7 has been developed by Bhosale's group.64 It exhibits a PCE value of 2.30% with a high Voc of 1.17 eV. Similar to DBS-2DDP and N7, F8-DPPTCN was designed and synthesized recently.65 Although it shows an extended absorption band from 550 nm to 750 nm, the PCE is only 2.37% with a FF value of 0.39. The unbalanced μe/μh may be responsible for the low FF value and photovoltaic performance. In 2014, Lim and co-workers reported an acceptor Flu-RH based on fluorene and rhodanine dyes.66 It exhibits a best PCE value of up to 3.08% with P3HT due to the high-lying LUMO energy level of about −3.53 eV. By changing the linker thiophene to benzothiadiazole, acceptor FBR with an A–A–D–A–A structure is synthesized.67 As shown in Fig. 7a, between the 400 nm and 600 nm region, FBR exhibits much stronger absorption than PC61BM, which may contribute to a higher photocurrent. Considering its suitable LUMO energy (−3.57 eV) matching well with donor P3HT, the best PCE result of 4.11% is obtained. To further understand the process of charge generation, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the efficiency of polaron generation as well as the recombination dynamics of their blending films.

As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the response rises rapidly at the initial stage but also decays very fast at the time higher than 200 ps for P3HT and FBR blending films. Even in the longer time scale, it also displays faster decay dynamics. Therefore, it can be concluded that acceptor FBR forms an intermixed film with donor P3HT, leading to not only the increased charge generation but also faster recombination compared with the controlled devices of P3HT:PC61BM. In other words, in contrast to the P3HT:PC61BM device, FBR does not aggregate enough to create appropriate percolation pathways as well as pure enough domains that prevent fast non-geminate recombination. Considering the large degree of overlapping absorption of FBR with P3HT and the weak ability of FBR to aggregate to form optimized film morphology, the same group developed another non-fullerene acceptor IDTBR with different alkyl chains.68

Compared with FBR, these two acceptors exhibit much red-shift absorption. In particular, O-IDTBR, as displayed in Fig. 7b, shows apparent red-shift absorption (near to NIR around 830 nm) after thermal annealing treatment. Meanwhile, through an ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy study, O-IDTBR displays more delayed polaron generation similar to the polymer:PC61BM film (Fig. 8c). Due to the improvement of these two aspects as well as the suitable energy level and efficient photoluminescence quenching, the best PCE result of 6.30% is obtained for O-IDTBR, which is mainly ascribed to a much higher Jsc (13.9 mA cm−2) in comparison to FBR (7.95 mA cm−2). Air stability is an essential issue for the practical implementation of OSC materials. It is worth mentioning that compared with fullerene-based acceptors, P3HT:FBR films display no visible particles even after 12 h annealing, and the acceptor O-IDTBR remains relatively stable for 1200 h and possesses 73% of the initial PCE value. By changing the octyl group to a 4-hexylbenzyl group, another acceptor IDT-2BR that shares the same backbone as O-IDTBR was synthesized.69 After optimization, the best PCE result of 5.04% with a Voc of 0.84 V can be obtained. The slightly higher LUMO energy level (−3.69 eV) for IDT-2BR than that of O-IDTBR (−3.88 eV) may contribute to its higher Voc value. Given the same FF value for these two acceptors, it seems that limited absorption for IDT-2BR is responsible for the low Jsc value. From the EQE figure for IDT-2BR displayed in Fig. 9, the curve covers the range between 400 nm and 700 nm and the strength is around 40%. But for O-IDTBR, in the same region, not only is the strength larger than 50%, but there is also an apparent response between 700 nm and 800 nm, which corresponds well with the high Jsc observed for O-IDTBR. Except rhodanine dyes, BODIPY dyes were also used as terminal units to design and synthesize a non-fullerene acceptor BDP-CPDT. The PCE was up to 1.51%.70

In this section, we discuss non-fullerene acceptors by using P3HT as donor materials. Generally, for most of these acceptors, they exhibit moderate PCE performance (lower than 3%). However, the acceptors Zn(WS3)2, SF-(DPPB)4 and O-IDTBR all exhibit promising results around or higher than 4.0% (entry 10, 12 and 22 in Table 1). From the basic physicochemical study, all of these compounds have extended absorption reaching the NIR region, and hence, generating a lower bandgap of about 1.75, 1.75 and 1.63 eV, respectively. In addition, they all have a suitable LUMO energy level matching well with P3HT, and with a higher LUMO (−3.51 eV) for acceptor SF-(DPPB)4, it exhibits an expected higher Voc value (about 1.14 eV). Except these features, these acceptors hardly share any common points. Firstly, their molecule structures are totally different from each other. Zn(WS3)2 is a 3D twisted metal inorganic molecule and SF(DPPVB)4 is a 3D molecule by adopting DPP as the electron-withdrawing unit. On the contrary, O-IDTBR seems to be a linear bar molecule. Secondly, it is known that a balanced electron/hole mobility ratio will be beneficial for a high FF value. This works well with Zn(WS3)2 and SF-(DPPB)4, which exhibit a similar FF value of about 0.57 and 0.55. However, for O-IDTBR, it only has electron mobility on the magnitude of ∼10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much lower than the hole mobility (about 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), but displays a FF value of about 0.60. Thus, it is really difficult to summarize some universal guidelines for all these three acceptors. Fortunately, McCulloch's group uses TAS to study the charge generation process and proves that a more delayed polaron generation may be beneficial for elevating the PCE value and indeed, O-IDTBR has much higher Jsc compared with Zn(WS3)2, considering their similar Voc and FF values. Thus, from the data in entries 10, 12 and 22 in Table 1, if we can discover a more effective acceptor that exhibits basic physicochemical properties with a bandgap of around 1.70 eV and a LUMO energy level of around −3.60 eV that are similar to SF-(DPPB)4 in order to obtain a Voc of about 1.0 V as well as a FF of about 0.60, but also achieve higher charge generation efficiency and obtain a Jsc of 14.0 mA cm−2, then a PCE of about 8.4% (14.0 × 1.0 × 0.60 = 8.4) can be obtained by using P3HT as the donor. This is a challenging target to be achieved and researchers need to develop more novel effective non-fullerene acceptors to work well with P3HT.
The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PBDTTT-C-T as the donor
In 2011, Hou and coworkers reported one novel 2D conjugated copolymer PBDTTT-C-T with a typical push–pull structure based on 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-thiophene-2-yl) BDT and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene TT units (Fig. 10). PBDTTT-C-T exhibits good thermal stability and red-shifted absorption with a λmax of around 700 nm as displayed in Fig. 11, lower HOMO (−5.11 eV) and LUMO energy levels (−3.25 eV) as well as a significantly higher hole mobility on the magnitude of 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. More importantly, it has the highest PCE value of 7.59% under the optimized conditions. Thus, in this section, we discuss non-fullerene acceptors (Fig. 10) by using PBDTTT-C-T as the donor material.71

Dimeric PDI with twisted conformation can not only reduce the aggregation tendency but also guarantees solution-processing fabrication of the device. Generally speaking, there are two methods to construct a twisted PDI dimer: one is to connect two PDI monomers through the nitrogen atom on the imide group and the other is to form a PDI dimmer through the bay position as shown in Fig. 10. In 2012, Narayan and co-workers reported the pioneering work about the acceptor PDI-dimer, in which two PDI units were connected through the N, N atoms on the imide group.72 They illustrated that the usage of the donor material PBDTTT-C-T could afford a PCE value of around 2.8%, which was about 20 times higher than the PCE (0.13%) of a controlled group based on a planar mono-PDI (entry 1, Table 2). In this work, they demonstrated that disrupting the crystallinity without adversely impacting the charge-transfer properties of PDIs was proposed to be an important design strategy. Yao and his coworkers reported one similar structure acceptor Bis-PDI-T-EG with thiophene as the linker and two 2-methoxyethoxyl groups as the soluble groups.73 As shown in Fig. 11, this molecule shows main absorption from 400 nm to 600 nm, which is complementary with the absorption of the PBDTTT-C-T donor. The blending film showed a PCE of 4.03% with 5.0% DIO under the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDI:PBDTTT-C-T/Ca/Al, which was the best OSC system based on a non-fullerene system at that time. Later, the PCE reached 6.1% for the same system by using the solvent vapor annealing (SVA) method. The authors ascribed the enhancement to the improved molecular organization and the reduced exciton recombination due to slow evaporation of the host solvent.74

By replacing the thienyl group with the selenophenyl group, the acceptor Bis-PDI-Se-EG was synthesized and exhibited the best PCE result of about 3.93%.75 Given the success of acceptor Bis-PDI-T-EG, Zhan and his co-workers synthesized a similar acceptor Bis-NDI-T-EG based on NDI, in which two NDI units were connected with a thienyl group linker.76 The acceptor exhibits good absorption from 300 nm to 600 nm and a suitable LUMO energy of around −3.80 eV. However, a lower Jsc is observed due to weak absorption in the visible region and a relatively large phase size. When blending with donor PBDTTT-C-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG yields a PCE value of 1.31% with a high Voc of 0.95–0.96 V. Zhan and co-workers also synthesized a series of PDI dimers with oligothiophene and studied their effect on the photovoltaic performance.77 It turns out that P1TP exhibits the best PCE result (up to 3.63%) with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:P1TP/Ca/Al. Through the AFM study, P0TP forms a large aggregation domain of around 100 nm, which will reduce the exciton diffusion and separation efficiency. Both P2TP and P3TP, on the contrary, form a very smooth and miscible morphology with a domain size of around 10 nm. Although this feature may be beneficial for exciton diffusion and separation, it would also bring adverse effects on charge transport and result in reduced mobility and PCE. P1TP shows appropriate phase separation as well as nanoscale aggregated domain size. Compared with oligothiophene as the linkers, the Wang group developed a series of acceptors using different bay-linked methods.78 It is observed that the fused linked d-DiPBI and t-DiPBI gave higher mobilities by two orders of magnitude than that of the singly-linked one and t-DiPBI shows red-shifted absorption as well as a significantly decreased LUMO energy level (about −4.10 eV). All three acceptors show PCE values of up to 3.11%, 1.54% and 1.36%, respectively. As expected, t-DiPBI shows the lowest Voc due to its lowest LUMO energy level. After optimizing the device of s-DiPBI with the adjustment of the additive and solvent, the best result of 3.63% was obtained.
It is well-known that the reason why fullerene-acceptor-based OSCs exhibit excellent results is their isotropic charge transport ability as well as their ball-like structure.79–81 Thus, the design and synthesis of novel non-fullerene acceptors with a 3D architecture to mimic the behavior of a fullerene-based acceptor may be beneficial for enhancing the OSC performance. As a matter of fact, several molecules based on this idea have been obtained by different research groups. For example, Zhan and co-workers reported a novel quasi-3D non-fullerene acceptor S(TPA-PDI)3 by using triphenylamine (TPA) as the core and PDI as outer wings, which yields a PCE performance as high as 3.32%82,83 (entry 7, Table 2). A novel non-fullerene 3D acceptor Me-PDI4 with a tetrahedral architecture based on PDI was explored and synthesized by Zhang's group.84
The physicochemical study indicates that this acceptor possesses a suitable LUMO energy level and a complementary absorption spectrum with donor materials. An optimized OSC device based on PBDTTT-C-T and Me-PDI4 with 3.0% DIO as the additive and thermal annealing post-treatment yield a PCE value as high as 2.5%, which demonstrates that employing a 3D architecture could be an effective strategy for the design of novel acceptors.
Aside from the PDI-based non-fullerene acceptor, Zhan designed the A–D–A structure acceptor SBF2 that had a spirobifluorene-based core and an electron-withdrawing 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DC) as end groups. However, the PCE is only about 0.97%.85 Another acceptor DC-IDT2T based on the indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene (IDT) unit as well as the same DC building block is also designed and synthesized.86 It shows the best PCE value of 3.93% without any post treatment. The high and balanced electron mobility of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole mobility of 2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 may be beneficial for the higher Jsc and FF values. By fusing the thienyl unit with the IDT unit, a new indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) unit is used as the core to form one new acceptor IDTT-2BM. By removing the thienyl unit, another acceptor IDT-2BM is also synthesized for comparison.87 The physicochemical study displays that both of them have the same LUMO energy level of −3.80 eV but a slightly different HOMO energy level (−5.5 eV for IDT-2BM and −5.6 eV for IDTT-2BM), which suggests that IDTT exhibits a stronger electron-donating ability than IDT and the LUMO energy level for these two acceptors are all determined by the same end electron-withdrawing group DC. Due to the similar energy level for the HOMO and the LUMO, these two acceptors also have similar absorption spectra from 500 nm to 750 nm. After optimization, IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM show the best PCE of 4.19% and 4.80%, respectively. The AFM study demonstrates that adding the additive facilitates the formation of a clear phase separation and a more uniform film.
In this part, we have discussed several studies based on non-fullerene acceptors (mainly PDI) with twisted or 3D structures and some small molecules with A–D–A architectures by using the PBDTTT-C-T polymer as the donor material. Generally speaking, both the absorption and suitable LUMO energy for the donor match well with the PDI derivative acceptors and the best PCE result for Bis-PDI-T-EG reaches 6.0% and as far as we know, none of the results exhibit PCEs as high as 7%. However, the donor PBDTTT-C-T is mainly employed in early studies and more likely plays a transitive role. In the following section, non-fullerene acceptors are evaluated based on a more efficient donor PTB7-Th as well as other recently developed donors.
The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PTB7-Th as the donor
Through subtle modification of the PBDTTT-C-T polymer by introducing one fluorine atom onto the TT unit, another novel polymer PTB7-Th is developed as shown in Fig. 12. With the downshift of the HOMO energy level to −5.22 eV, PTB7-Th is demonstrated to be a promising donor with a high PCE of up to 10% reported in the literature. Herein, non-fullerene acceptors are discussed based on this electron donor in this section.18
 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of PDI-based non-fullerene acceptors using PTB7-Th as the donor. 
Due to the strong tendency for π–π stacking between PDI molecules resulting from their large planar conjugation structures, these molecules easily form large aggregates in the film, causing the recombination of the excitons and deteriorating the PCE performance. To address this problem, Sun and co-workers recently reported an acceptor TP-PDI with 1,6,7,12-tetraphenyl groups88 (Fig. 12). Interestingly, the absorption spectra of this acceptor, no matter whether in solution or in a neat film, are very similar to each other, which indicates that the aggregation behavior is significantly suppressed by introducing the phenyl groups and the cyclohexyl group into the nitrogen atom. After blending with the donor polymer PTB7-Th as well as using 1% chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additive, TP-PDI can exhibit a PCE value of 4.0% (entry 1, Table 3). In 2014, Jen and coworkers reported the acceptor di-PDI by directly linking two PDI monomers through the bay position.89 After various optimizations, such as using a fullerene self-assembled monolayer (PC61BM-SAM)-modified zinc oxide (ZnO) interlayer to enhance charge extraction, an inverted device architecture of (ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:di-PDI/MoO3/Ag) and the efficient donor material PTB7-Th, the device shows the best PCE result of up to 5.90%. Similar to di-PDI, another two acceptors F2B-T2PDI and T2PDI with different linkers are developed later and interestingly, F2B-T2PDI exhibits a better PCE result (4.79%) than 3.57% of T2PDI.90 The authors attribute the reason to the special structure of F2B-T2PDI, whose highly twisted architecture can inhibit strong aggregation with the film and the rigid F2B core linker can enhance intermolecular packing to improve crystallinity and electron mobility. A U-shaped acceptor rac-DAPH-PPDI is developed based on a bis-PDI unit with DACH as a bridge and this material exhibits the best PCE result of up to 4.68%.91

Aside from the design and synthesis of twisted non-fullerene acceptors, a 3D structure strategy is also investigated extensively. Tetra-PDI is designed and synthesized by taking advantage of the tetraphenyl silicane core, which shows an improved PCE result of 3.37%.92 Yan and co-workers designed and synthesized another novel non-fullerene acceptor TPE-PDI4 by adopting tetraphenylethylene as the core. The best PCE performance of 5.53% for this acceptor was achieved.93 Another 3D non-fullerene acceptor SBF-PDI4 based on an orthogonally twisted building block is synthesized with a suitable LUMO energy level of −4.1 eV.94 Its photovoltaic performance reaches the highest PCE result (5.34%) compared with 7.0% for the standard PC61BM acceptor. Marder's group also designed and synthesized two new non-fullerene acceptors BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 based on the bifluorenylidene core.95 Unlike SBF-PDI4, the angle between two fluorene units is about 30–40 degrees. The acceptor BF-PDI4 shows the best PCE result of up to 3.50%. Although this acceptor shows strong and complementary absorption (between 400 nm and 600 nm) for donor PTB7-Th, little of this absorption can be transferred to photocurrent, which accounts for the lower Jsc compared with the acceptors SBF-PDI4 and TPE-PDI4. Chen's group reported a non-fullerene acceptor B(PDI)3 simply by connecting three PDI units on a phenyl ring.96 This acceptor provides the highest PCE result of 5.65%. After adding the CN additive, the donor π–π stacking properties can be recovered and are beneficial for a higher PCE value.
From the above discussion, it can be briefly concluded that compared with the mono-planar PDI acceptor, PDI derivative acceptors with a 3D architecture, including the examples mentioned in the PBDTTT-C-T section, are able to possess a significantly improved morphology to achieve higher PCE results (around 5%). However, they are still inferior to the PC61BM acceptor with a much lower FF value of around 0.50 because the strongly twisted π-conjugation is likely to undermine the charge transport and diminish their potential as effective electron acceptors. Thus, proving the effectiveness of the 3D strategy is still a tough task.
Recently, Yu's group designed and synthesized two novel acceptors by linking different bay positions of PDI units through BDT bridges97 (Fig. 12). Interestingly, the aPBDT based device exhibited a much higher PCE result of 4.92% than that of the bPBDT based device (3.61%, entry 10, Table 3). Charge separation studies show more efficient exciton dissociation at interfaces between PDI-based compounds and PTB7-Th due to the better planarity of αPBDT. Following this idea, Yu's group synthesizes another 3D acceptor TPB with a special structure that four PDIs form a cross-like molecular conformation while still partially conjugated with the BDT-Th core.98 As shown in Fig. 13a, it shows main absorption ranging from 400 nm to 550 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of the donor PTB7-Th. The additive plays a key role in ameliorating the film morphology, and by adding 8% of DPE, the highest PCE (8.0%) is achieved due to the extraordinary high Jsc values (>18 mA cm−2) resulting from the high charge dissociation efficiency. From the EQE spectra, the PTB7-Th and TPB blend film exhibits a high EQE of about 60% from 400 nm to 750 nm (Fig. 13b). The success of TPB implies that non-fullerene acceptors with a 3D architecture can be an effective strategy to elevate the PCE value.

Very recently, acceptors with fused rings between the bay positions of the subunit of PDI have been designed and synthesized (Fig. 14). These molecules have the following two features: (a) the fused rings, to some extent, increase the effective conjugation between the PDI subunit and decrease the rotational disorder as well as the reorganization energy, which may be beneficial for better charge mobility and morphology in the solid film; (b) although the conjugation increases through the whole molecules, these acceptors still possess a non-planar geometry, which will guarantee the inhibition of strong aggregation of the films and the formation of a bi-continuous network with the donor materials.

For hPDI2,99 hPDI3 and hPDI4,100 the PDI units are covalently linked by one or more ethylene bridges. As shown in Fig. 15a, all these acceptors show a similar absorption profile and a similar broad absorption range from 300 nm to 600 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of PTB7-Th. With increasing number of fused PDI units, the LUMO energy decreases gradually from −3.77 eV to −3.86 eV to −3.91 eV. Interestingly, although these three acceptors have different LUMO energy levels, they exhibit the same Voc value of 0.80 V. In addition, due to their twisted structures, they show weak aggregation but better electron mobility and electron accepting ability. With 1.0% solvent additive DIO, the hPDI2 and hPDI4 acceptors show very high PCE performance (5.94% and 8.3%, respectively, entries 12 and 13, Table 3). The significantly improved FF value from 0.55 to 0.68 contributes to the superior photovoltaic performance for hPDI4. Meanwhile, the PTB7-Th:hPDI4 blending film exhibits a broad and strong EQE spectrum between 350 nm and 740 nm, which is responsible for the high Jsc of 15.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15b). Jen and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of fused-PDI non-fullerene acceptors FPDI-F, FPDI-T, FPDI-Se by introducing furan, thiophene and selenophene as the bridges.101 The physicochemical study indicates that these three acceptors possess similar absorption ranging from 300 nm to 550 nm with two maximum peaks, the LUMO energy level of about −3.80 eV and bandgaps of 2.20 eV. The twisted angle increases from 16° to 24° to 27° when the size of the heteroatom changes from oxygen to sulfur to selenium. The optimized PCE of up to 6.48% is achieved for FPDI-T due to the strong π–π stacking within the blend film when taking the inverted device architecture ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:FPDI-T/MoO3/Ag and using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the solvent additives, which plays an important role in elevating the FF value by improving the charge transportation and collection. As a matter of fact, the FPDI-T/PTB7-Th blending film exhibits the highest μe and μh (1.63 × 10−4 and 5.92 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) among these three acceptors. Jen's work demonstrates the importance of choosing the appropriate fusing unit to obtain an ideal non-fullerene acceptor. Mark's group also synthesized a series of fused-ring PDI dimers as a non-fullerene acceptor by using the aromatic ring or the thienyl ring as the linker. Due to the increased conjugation between these bridges and the PDI unit, the electron mobility for these molecules increases simultaneously and the best PCE result of 3.89% is obtained for Ph2a.102

Small molecules with an A–D–A structure or polymers with D–A structures have been studied intensively as OSC donor materials and great progress has been achieved. As a matter of fact, by choosing the suitable D unit and A unit to attain the suitable electron affinity of the designed molecules, they can also be used as OSC acceptors to obtain very excellent results (Fig. 16). By taking advantage of (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile as the terminal end, Beaujuge's group synthesized three small molecule acceptors FBM, CBM and CDTBM by changing the donor units from fluorene to carbazole and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene.103 Interestingly, all these three acceptors exhibit a very promising PCE result (around 5%) (entry 16, Table 3). Chen's group designed and synthesized a small molecule DICTF as the acceptor that exhibited a higher PCE result (around 7.6%).104 In addition to the high PCE performance, this molecule can be synthesized in three steps with high yields from a cheap commercially available product, which provides the possibility of the large-scale production of OSCs in the future. Zhan and co-workers reported a series of efficient large π-conjugation A–D–A acceptors IEIC and ITIC,105,106 where A represents the electron-withdrawing group: 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) malononitrile while D represents two typical electron-donating ladder-type groups: indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT). Four phenyl groups are introduced into the backbone of the D unit to adjust the solubility of these two acceptors. These two acceptors showed high PCE results of 6.31% and 6.80%, respectively, when employing PTB7-Th as the donor material. In addition, the stability properties for IEIC were investigated and the device decreased by about 17% and then remained almost stable after 17 h of continuous AM1.5G illumination. By changing the phenyl group into the thienyl group, a much higher PCE of 8.50% is obtained.28 Liao's group designed and synthesized a new non-fullerene acceptor IDTIDT-IC using a fused 10-heteroring unit (indacenodithiophenoindacenodithiophene) with a low bandgap of 1.5 eV.107 A photovoltaic study reveals that this molecule shows the best PCE result of 6.25% compared with that of 7.12% obtained from PC71BM. Surprisingly, this molecule exhibits a high Voc value of 0.94 V. Given the low bandgap value of 1.5 eV, the Eloss is only around 0.6 eV.
 Fig. 16  Chemical structures of A–D–A non-fullerene acceptors using PTB7-Th as the donor. 
In this section, we can conclude that PDI-derivative-based non-fullerene acceptors generally work very well with PTB7-Th due to its appropriate film morphology, strong tendency to form face-on stacking as well as red-shifted and complementary absorption (550 nm to 800 nm) and generally exhibits better PCE performance compared with the donor PDBTTT-C-T. Actually, the PCE values for blending films of PTB7-Th:TPB and PTB7-Th:hPDI4 are all higher than 8%. In addition, the low-bandgap acceptors with absorption in the visible or NIR region, such as ITIC or ITIC-Th, are also compatible with PTB7-Th and these systems also display the highest PCE (about 8.5%). Therefore, PTB7-Th is a powerful and efficient donor material to evaluate more non-fullerene acceptors.
The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PDBT-T1 as the donor
In 2015, Sun and coworkers developed a novel wide bandgap polymer PDBT-T1 with efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection (Fig. 17). It exhibits an impressively high PCE performance of 9.7% under the optimized conditions. Thus, in this section, we will discuss the OSC performance of non-fullerene acceptors (Fig. 10) by using PBDT-T1 as the donor material.108
 Fig. 17  Chemical structures of non-fullerene acceptors using PDBT-T1 as the donor material. 
Very recently, Wang and his co-workers reported a series of acceptors SdiPBI-S109,110 and SdiPBI-Se110 as drawn in Fig. 17. As a matter of fact, these two molecules share similar basic physicochemical properties. By taking SdiPBI-Se as an example in Fig. 18a, the UV-vis spectrum indicates that SdiPBI-Se shows intensive absorption between 400 nm and 550 nm, which is complementary to the absorption of the donor polymer PDBT-T1. In addition, SdiPBI-Se has a suitable LUMO energy level (−3.87 eV) that matches well with the LUMO of PDBT-T1. By introducing sulfur and selenium atoms into the PDI plane, there are several major advancements: (1) the fused thiophene or selenophene ring will increase the rigidity of the whole PDI molecule, thus SdiPBI-S and PSdiPBI-Se have very twisted structures. The dihedral angles between the two PDI subunits are 80 °C and 77 °C, respectively, for SdiPBI-S and PSdiPBI-Se. This change would account for weak aggregation for these two acceptors in the solid film. (2) Due to the electron-donating properties of the sulfur atom and the selenium atom, it is envisioned that the LUMO energy for these two acceptors would be increased and the Voc of the device would also improve at the same time. As a matter of fact, the Voc values for the two acceptors SdiPBI-S and PSdiPBI-Se are 0.90 V and 0.96 V, respectively. (3) Taking into account that selenium has a bigger and more polarizable electron cloud than sulfur, which may enhance the orbital overlap and charge carrier mobility of PSdiPBI-Se. Actually, the hole and electron mobility for SdiPBI-Se are 3.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are higher than those of SdiPBI-S: 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The high and balanced hole and electron mobility accounts for the FF value higher than 0.70. With DIO as the additive, both acceptors SdiPBI-S and SdiPBI-Se show very high PCE results of 6.9% and 8.2%, respectively, by using the conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-S/Ca/Al compared with the PCE of 8.5% by using PC71BM as the acceptor (entries 1 and 2, Table 4).

Through the AFM and GIWAXS study, DIO plays an important role in reinforcing the face-on π–π stacking and facilitating the formation of large crystallinity domains for these two acceptors, which will be beneficial for the improvement of the PCE results. As shown in Fig. 19, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurement implies that both PDBT-T1 and SdiPBI-Se contribute to overall photocurrent generation in the blending film, whereas the donor PDBT-T1 dominates photocurrent generation in the PDBT-T1:PC71BM blend, agreeing well with the fact that SdiPBI-Se has superior absorption behavior over PC71BM in the visible wavelength region. The pump-intensity-dependent charge population dynamics indicates that although the acceptor has an ultrafast charge generation process to produce photocurrent, this process is compromised by the relatively stronger charge recombination in the PDBT-T1:SdiPBI-Se film.

Recently, the same group designed and synthesized two large conjugated C3 non-fullerene acceptors TPH and TPH-Se.111 Compared with SdiPBI-S or SdiPBI-Se, both TPH and TPH-Se show broad and strong absorption in the 300–600 nm region as shown in Fig. 18b, but slightly higher LUMO levels of about −3.80 eV and an electron mobility of 0.028 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TPH (4a) and 0.032 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TPH-Se (6a). A single crystal study shows that both TPH and TPH-Se have distorted propeller configurations and TPH-Se has a more compact 3D network assembly due to the Se⋯O interactions. The best PCE results of 8.15% for TPH and 8.98% for TPH-Se are obtained by the addition of 0.25% DIO. Considering the high electron mobility as well as the proper aggregation and good film morphology, the PCE increment from 8.2% for SDiPBI-Se to 8.98% for TPH-Se may result from the slightly increased Voc due to the increased LUMO energy level.
Recently, following the 3D idea, two non-fullerene acceptors tetra-PBI and tetra-PBI-Se have been synthesized.112 Their photovoltaic properties are investigated with an inverted device architecture of ITO/ZnO/PBDT-TS1:acceptor/MoO3/Al. The best PCE performances for tetra-PBI and tetra-PBI-S are 3.2% and 6.2%, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities for PDBT-T1:tetra-PBI-Se are measured to be only 9.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. By replacing the tetraphenyl methane core with the triphenyl amine (TPA) core, a series of acceptors TPA-PDI, TPA-PDI-S and TPA-PDI-Se were designed and synthesized.113 Similar to the tetra-PBI acceptors system, the PCE performances of these three acceptors gradually increase from 4.30% to 5.56% to 5.96%. Interestingly, the PCE value (5.96%) for TPA-PDI-Se is almost the same as that of the acceptor tetra-PBI-Se (6.17%). However, it is worth noting that, for TPA-based acceptors, they exhibit two-magnitude higher electron mobility (10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than tetra-PBI-based acceptors (10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Recently, Yang's group designed and synthesized two novel non-fullerene acceptors SdiPBI-BT and diPBI-BT with a fused thienobenzene unit on the bay position of PDI.114 A physicochemical study indicates that diPBI-BT exhibits a higher LUMO energy level (−3.67 eV) than SdiPBI-BT (−3.79 eV) and theoretical calculation displays that SdiPBI-BT possesses a much larger twisted angle of about 70° while diPBI-BT shows a twisted angle of only 18°. SdiPBI-BT eventually shows the best PCE value of 6.61%, higher than that of the acceptor diPBI-BT (5.73%). A study on AFM and electron transportation ability reveals that the favorable phase separation for the PDBT-T1/SdiPBI-BT blend film and its relatively higher electron mobility may account for the better photovoltaic performance.
Recently, Zhan's group designed and synthesized a planar ring-fused non-fullerene acceptor IC-C6IDC-IC with strong absorption between 500 and 800 nm, a suitable energy level (−3.91 eV) and a high electron mobility of about 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1115 (Fig. 18c). A device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:IC-C6IDC-IC/MoOx/Ag is fabricated to study the potential application of IC-C6IDC-IC in OSCs and by using PDBT-T1 as the donor, it displays the best result of about 8.52% due to strong face-on packing and the appropriate phase separation scale. The low and unbalanced electron (2.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility (5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) may be responsible for the relatively lower FF value (0.65) than TPH-Se (0.72). In addition, compared with the EQE spectrum for the acceptor TPH-Se in Fig. 20a, IC-C6IDC-IC possesses additionally strong absorption >700 nm (Fig. 20b), which may account for the significant increase in Jsc from 12.5 mA cm−2 for TPH-Se to 15.1 mA cm−2 for IC-C6IDC-IC, although this molecule has decreased EQE values ranging from 350 nm to 500 nm (<60%). The low-lying LUMO energy level (about −3.91 eV) results in the slightly lower Voc value of 0.89 V in comparison with the 1.00 V of TPH-Se. This work provides an alternative efficient ‘planar non-fullerene acceptor’ idea compared with the formerly numerous reported ‘twisted or 3D non-fullerene acceptor’ ideas.

Subsequently, the same group obtained another non-fullerene acceptor with an even larger conjugated building block indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene and thienyl side groups that aim to increase the intermolecular interaction due to stronger sulfur–sulfur interaction.28 It has a similar absorption range, LUMO energy level and electron mobility (6.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared with IC-C6IDC-IC. However, with the same device fabrication conditions, the ITIC-Th acceptor exhibits a higher PCE result of 9.30% compared with 8.52% for IC-C6IDC-IC mainly due to the slightly increased Jsc, which may result from the more balanced μe/μh ratio. After a deeper study on the film morphology through AFM, a two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS and soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) technique indicates that adding 1% CN is the key. The face-on π–π stacking is improved and the appropriate domain size with higher purity is also formed. In addition, ITIC-Th can work well with the donor PTB7-Th and displays the best result of up to 8.5%.28 The slightly lower PCE result of 8.5% (compared with 9.30%) is due to the deeper HOMO energy level of PTBT-T1 compared with PTB7-Th. Furthermore, the authors studied the effect of the number of donor units within the acceptors on the photovoltaic performance.116 It was found that with the increasing number of donor units, the PCE result decreases significantly from 7.02% to 2.42% to no photovoltaic response when extending the length of the DT donor unit. The difference in photovoltaic performance for the acceptors may be due to different phase separation. Aside from the excellent photovoltaic performance, it is worth mentioning that with donor PDBT-T1, and both the IC-C6IDC-IC and ITIC-Th acceptors exhibit good thermal stability after a relatively long-term heat treatment.
From the above discussion, we can see that by using PTBT-T1 as the donor, several novel non-fullerene acceptors achieve a very promising PCE result (higher than 8%). Although they possess very different molecular structures such as a twisted structure or a linear planar structure and completely different absorption spectra (e.g. 400 to 600 nm for SdiPDI-Se and 600 to 800 nm for ITIC-Th), they still share some common features that make them efficient non-fullerene acceptors, such as complementary absorption and a suitable energy level between the donor and the acceptor, the intrinsic electron mobility higher than 0.001 cm2 V−1 s−1 as well as appropriate and balanced hole and electron mobilities for the blend film. In addition, the optimized film morphology with appropriate crystallinity and phase separation as well as domain size with high purity is also important for achieving higher PCE performance.
The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PSEHTT as the donor
The donor polymer PSEHTT (Fig. 22b) based on thiazolothiazole–dithienosilole was synthesized by Jenekhe's group in 2011 and displayed a PCE value of 5% with the acceptor PC71BM. The authors found that this polymer possessed face-on π-stacking orientation within the films and observed enhanced charge photogeneration through transient absorption spectroscopy measurement. Aside from developing novel and efficient donor materials for OSCs, Jenekhe's group also synthesized a lot of interesting non-fullerene acceptor materials recently. In this section, we will discuss these materials by using PSEHTT as the donor.117
In 2013, Jenekhe and co-workers designed and synthesized a large π-conjugated electron-deficient building block tetraazabenzodifluoranthene diimide (BFI) by fusing one tetraazaanthracene core and two naphthalene imide units118 (Fig. 21). From the single crystal XRD analysis, BFI possesses strong intermolecular interaction due to the joint effect of the strong π–π interactions and the C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds. In addition, its optical and electronic properties as well as carrier mobilities can be tuned readily by introducing various functional groups such as –CN or thienyl groups. Actually, BFI-T2 has an electron mobility of 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a preliminary PCE of 1.8%, which demonstrates that BFI is a promising n-type material for organic functional materials and non-fullerene acceptors (entry 1, Table 5). To prove this idea, Jenekhe's group developed a novel twisted non-fullerene acceptor DBFI-T through linking two BFI units by employing one thiophene molecule as the bridge.119 Theoretical calculation indicates that DBFI-T has a twisted angle of 33 °C due to steric hindrance. As displayed in Fig. 22a, both BFI-based molecules display main absorption between 300 and 460 nm and weak absorption in the visible region when attaching different functional groups. Taking DBFI-T as an example, there is an apparent affiliated weak peak ranging from 500 to 700 nm. For donor PSEHTT, it has an almost complementary absorption with DBFI-T except for a valley between 400 and 500 nm. From Fig. 22c, both BFI-P2 and DBF-T exhibit suitable LUMO energy levels for efficient charge dissociation and charge transportation. Their OSC performances are evaluated by taking the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PSEHTT:DBFI-T/MoO3/Ag and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 5. For the acceptor DBFI-T, it exhibits much better PCE results (4.91%) than the acceptor BFI-P2 (around 1.0%) or even higher than the values obtained from the controlled PC60BM groups. Through studying the charge transport of the films, both PSEHTT:DBFI-T and PSEHTT:PC60BM blends have sufficiently high and balanced electron mobilities on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the contrary, the PSEHTT:BFI-P2 blend has a much lower electron mobility of about 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, which may account for the low PCE performance. In addition, the AFM study reveals that the PSEHTT:DBFI-T blend film forms a much smoother surface with uniform nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous networks while the PSEHTT:BFI-P2 blend film contains a larger domain over 100 nm.

The Xe flash time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) technique is adopted to further study the photoconductive properties of the blend films (Fig. 23). The Δσmax of laser- and Xe-flash TRMC are always higher for PSEHTT:DBFI-T than for PSEHTT:BFI-P2, indicating the better photovoltaic device performance of DBFI-T than BFI-P2. Under the optimized ratio of donor:acceptor = 1:3 or 1:2, the PSEHTT:DBFI-T blend exhibits a significantly higher Δσmax than PSEHTT:PC60BM, whereas PSEHTT:BFI-P2 had the lowest Δσmax, which corresponds to the photovoltaic efficiency obtained in OSC devices.

To further study the twisted angle's effect on the PCE performance for BFI-based non-fullerene acceptors, various aromatic linkers are introduced and a series of novel molecules DBFI-S, DBFI-MTT, DBFI-DMT and DBFI-EDOT are obtained.120,121 Interestingly, as the twisted angle gradually increases from 40 °C to 53 °C to 62 °C to 72 °C, the device performance based on ITO/ZnO/PEI/DBFI-Ar:PSEHTT/MoO3/Ag for these acceptors increases from 2.4% to 3.8% to 6.2% to 7.9%, simultaneously, mainly contributing from the elevated Jsc value and FF values. From the SEM and XRD study, it indicates that with the increase of the twisted angle, there is an improved film morphology with higher phase separation as well as purer crystallinity of PSEHTT domains, which is beneficial for bimolecular charge dissociation and corresponds to the obtained data about Jsc and FF. In addition, for DBFI-DMOT, it exhibits the best μe/μh value of around 9.3, much better than the other three acceptors. The authors also investigated the PCE performance by using PTB7-Th as the donor and BFDI-DMOT as the acceptor and the best result is up to 6.4%. As shown in Fig. 24, the authors draw a diagram showing the change of Jsc and the PCE value with the change of the twisted angle. There is an approximately linear relationship between the PCE value and the twisted angle. It is anticipated that the PCE can be around 10% by introducing some linkers that can produce an even larger twisted degree. Through further modification of the BFI backbone, the authors developed another interesting non-fullerene acceptor bis(naphthalene imide)-3,6-diphenyl-trans-anthrazolines (BNIDPA). It has similar physicochemical properties to BFI building blocks and shows the best PCE result of up to 2.87% by using PSEHTT as the donor.122

From the above discussion, due to the intrinsic superior advantages of the BFI building block, such as the large π-conjugated plane, improved electron mobility, tunable optical and energy levels as well as the convenient modification method by introducing different aromatic linkers to adjust the twist angle and film morphology, Jenekhe's group developed a very efficient non-fullerene acceptor DBFI-DMOT, which exhibits the best PCE result of around 8%. Moreover, this acceptor is compatible with another donor PTB7-Th and exhibits a very promising result, indicating its potential for acceptor matching with more other donor materials. Finally, due to the unbalanced μe/μh value, it is anticipated that there is still some improved space for PSEHTT based OSCs.
The above discussion covers the non-fullerene acceptors evaluated by the frequently used donors, such as P3HT, PTB7-Th etc. In the following section, we will discuss the non-fullerene acceptors by taking some other donor materials that are not so frequently adopted and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 6.

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with J51 as the donor
Liao's group presents a novel non-fullerene acceptor IDSe-T-IC as shown in Fig. 25,123 bearing a fused five-heterocyclic ring containing selenium atoms with strong absorption in the 600–850 nm region and a suitable LUMO energy level of −3.79 eV as shown in Fig. 26a. The bandgap can be calculated to be Eg = 1.52 eV. By taking J51124 as the donor materials, IDSe-T-IC exhibits a higher PCE result (>8.0%), much higher than the value of 6.00% from the controlled PC71BM (entry 1, Table 6). The EQE spectrum indicates that there is broad absorption between 350 nm and 800 nm for the IDSe-T-IC:PC71BM blend film. In addition, the high Voc value of 0.91 V indicates that Eloss is only about 0.6 eV by the equation Eloss = Eg − Voc, which is among the lowest energy losses for polymer/non-fullerene systems as displayed in Fig. 26b. This work demonstrates that finely tuning the absorption and electronic energy levels of non-fullerene materials, and properly pairing them with a large bandgap polymer to achieve complementary absorption are alternative methods to obtain a highly efficient OSC system. By extending the heterocyclic ring number from 5 to 10, a novel acceptor IDTIDSe-IC is synthesized.125 This molecule possesses almost the same bandgap, absorption and LUMO energy level to IDSe-T-IC and also exhibits a PCE of up to 7.8%, still much higher than that of PC71BM. It is worth noting that the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the acceptor is only 0.12 eV. J51 also works well with the acceptor ITIC and shows the best PCE value of about 9.07%. The authors conclude that the appropriate nanoscale phase separated morphology and the high as well as balanced hole and electron mobility may account for the high PCE value.126

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PPDT2FBT as the donor
In 2016, Park's group designed and synthesized a novel non-fullerene acceptor NIDCS-HO based on naphthalimide as the terminal unit as illustrated in Fig. 27.127 A UV-vis and CV study shows that this molecule exhibits strong absorption between 400 nm and 600 nm as well as a suitable energy level of about −3.75 eV as shown in Fig. 28. Interestingly, the offset of the LUMO between this acceptor and the donor is only 0.08 eV, much lower than the widely accepted 0.3 eV for efficient charge photoinduced charge transfer. Surprisingly, the photovoltaic study reveals that when combining with the donor PPDT2FBT,128 which exhibits a PCE higher than 9.0% with PC71BM, NIDCS-HO has the best PCE result of 7.50% with a high Voc of 1.03 V after 90 °C treatment (entry 4, Table 6). It turns out that thermal annealing favors a well-organized crystalline structure of the NIDCS-HO acceptor without disrupting the “face-on” packing behavior of PPDT2FBT. Choi's group developed another two acceptors CP-M and CP-V with different molecular structures by linking 1,1-diphenylcyclohexane at the bay and head positions, respectively.129 With donor PPDT2FBT, CP-V shows a better PCE result of around 5.0% than CP-M (2.0%) due to the better morphology. Compared with the acceptor NIDCS-HO, the much lower LUMO energy level (−3.98 eV) for the acceptor CP-V may contribute to its low Voc value of 0.87 V.

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PffBT4T-2DT as the donor
As shown in Fig. 29, Yan and co-workers synthesized a series of 3D PDI non-fullerene acceptors based on tetraphenylmethane (TPC), tetraphenylsilane (TPSi) and tetraphenylgermane (TPGe).130 For both acceptors TCP-PDI4 and TCSi-PDI4, their photovoltaic performance is higher than 4.0% by using the donor PffBT4T-2DT,131 much higher than that of TPGe-PDI4 (1.6%). Further, an AFM and XRD study as well as the experiments for light intensity dependence of the Jsc and Voc reveals that TPGe-PDI4 has stronger bimolecular recombination resulting in its low PCE value (entry 6, Table 6). The same groups also developed two non-fullerene acceptors i-Me2T2-PDI2 and o-Me2T2-PDI2 by introducing two thiophene linkers with two methyl groups in different positions.132 It turns out that the subtle structure adjustment affects the PCE significantly and i-Me2T2-PDI2 displays a higher PCE value of 4.1% than that of o-Me2T2-PDI2 (3.1%), which may be ascribed to the higher hole mobility resulting from the stronger polymer aggregation in the i-Me2T2-PDI2/polymer blend. Yan and co-workers evaluated the photovoltaic performance by using PffBT4T-2DT as the donor and SF-PDI2 and di-PDI as the acceptors.133 SF-PDI2 displays a higher PCE value of 6.0% than 5.1% of di-PDI, which is partially due to the higher Voc value resulting from the high-lying LUMO of SF-PDI2. Recently, a 3D structure acceptor SF-PDI4 is synthesized and it exhibits a lower PCE value (about 5.11%) than SF-PDI2.134 Recently, Singh's group designed and synthesized a novel non-fullerene acceptor BAF-2HDT by employing hexadiathiafulvalene (HDT) wings as terminal groups. These molecules exhibit broad and enhanced absorption in the range of 300–600 nm compared with PC71BM and possess a suitable LUMO energy level of −3.58 eV, which is compatible with the donor material PffBT4T-2OD (containing a C8C10 alkyl chain compared with PffBT4T-2DT). A photovoltaic performance study indicates that the vacuum-drying technique provides improved morphology as compared to the conventional thermal annealing method and the best PCE performance (7.13%) can be obtained with a high Voc of 0.77 V, Jsc of 14.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.64. In addition, BAF-2HDT has an extremely balanced μe/μh ratio of 1.30.135

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with PCDTBT-C12 as the donor
As shown in Fig. 30, the Bo group developed a novel non-fullerene acceptor NI-T-NI based on 1,8-naphthalimide terminal groups.123 The physicochemical study reveals that this molecule has main absorption from 350 nm to 500 nm and a high-lying LUMO of −3.53 eV. The donor material is PCDTBT-C12136 which possesses absorption ranging from 350 nm to 650 nm and a LUMO energy level of −3.26 eV. This molecule exhibits the best PCE performance of 1.91% with a Voc value of 1.30 V, which is among the highest reported Voc values (entry 11, Table 6). Later, the same group developed a new acceptor SM1 with a central benzene core and two thiophene linkers.137 The PCE result improves to 2.65% with a high Voc of 1.04 V after optimization. The author also evaluated the molecules NI-AA-NI as the acceptor; however, the device performance is only 1.73% with a high Voc of 1.06 V.138 Interestingly, after removing one ethynyl group, the same group obtained another acceptor NI-A-C6 that exhibits a much higher PCE value of about 3.87%, which is comparative to 3.92% of the performance of acceptor PC71BM.139 After further study on the as-fabricated film, the authors ascribe the appropriate aggregation as well as the pure domain of the acceptor to the improved PCE value. From the above discussion, all these four molecules exhibit a moderate PCE value and a low Jsc, which may result from limited absorption for the blend film (almost no contribution from the range >600 nm). However, they all exhibit high Voc values, indicating the importance of adjusting the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor materials.

The OSC performance of different non-fullerene acceptors with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 as the donor
In 2013, Bazan and co-workers developed the acceptor mono-PDI by simply introducing 1-ethylpropyl onto the nitrogen atom of the imide group as displayed in Fig. 31. By combination with the donor p-DTE(FBTTH2)2, also discovered by the same group, the PCE of the as-fabricated device could reach up to 3%, which was among the best results for the mono-PDI acceptor at that time140 (entry 15, Table 6). The Welch group developed an acceptor S4 based on the isoindigo unit and it displays a PCE value of around 1.0%.141 Similar to the reported NIDCS-HO, NIDCS-MO is also synthesized and it works well with the small molecule donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and shows the best PCE value of about 5.3%. It is found that thermal annealing greatly affects the PCE performance.142

In this section, we discussed the non-fullerene acceptor research based on the donor materials that are not frequently utilized. Among these donor materials, there are low bandgap polymers PPDT2FBT and PffBT4T-2DT as well as medium bandgap polymers such as J51 and PCDTBT-C12. Interestingly, non-fullerene acceptors can work well with both kinds of polymers and exhibit superior photovoltaic performances. For instance, the NIDCS-HO:PPDT2FBT blend film displays the highest PCE value of about 7.5% while IDSe-T-IC:J51 and ITIC:J51 active layers exhibit a PCE value of up to 8.0%, even higher than that of PC71BM (6.0%). All these examples indicate the importance of selecting matched donors and acceptors. In addition, the non-fullerene small molecule acceptors can also work with a small molecule donor and have a PCE value of up to 5.3%, such as NIDCS-MO: p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which demonstrates that there is still much room to develop a non-fullerene acceptor to match with small molecule donors.
With the rapid development of donor materials, lots of them are utilized to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene acceptors. In the last section, we will discuss the acceptors as drawn in Fig. 32 with some special donor materials and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 7.

Miscellaneous
Subphthalocyanines, particularly boron SubPc chlorides, are another class of materials used as non-fullerene acceptors in OSCs. In 2014, Kjellcnops and coworkers developed the acceptors SubPc and SubNc143 (Fig. 32). They found that these acceptors afforded a high PCE of 4.69% and 6.02%, respectively, by employing simple bilayer devices (entry 1, Table 7). Interestingly, a remarkable efficiency of up to 8.40% was achieved with a simple three-layer device architecture comprising both SubPc and SubNc. The three photoactive materials have complementary optical absorption profiles and both internal (IQE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra show efficient photocurrent generation within all three absorbing materials. Interestingly, SubNc was also used as a donor material in conjunction with a chlorinated electron acceptor Cl6SubPc.144–146 A planar hetero-junction was utilized again, and with interlayer optimization, a PCE of 6.4% was achieved owing to the high Jsc, Voc, and FF values of 9.0 mA cm−2, 1.03 V and 0.71. Compared with the corresponding device with C60 as the electron acceptor, an increased current with Cl6SubPc is attributed to strong and complementary absorption profiles, while the greatly improved fill factor is explained by decreased recombination of either charge-transfer states or trapped charges.
Hou and coworkers developed a non-fullerene acceptor H-tri-PDI by connecting three mono-PDI units through the head N–N position. PBDT-TS1 is a novel polymer developed in 2014 by the same group and shows the best PCE value of higher than 9.0% by using PC71BM as the acceptor.147 The photovoltaic study indicates that H-tri-PDI exhibits a high PCE result (7.25%) with DPE as the additive and 5.81% without any additive. A further study shows that the improved crystallinity and π–π stacking as well as the purer domain may account for the better PCE result with the additive.148 Yan's group developed a 3D architecture molecule TPPz-PDI4 with reduced intramolecular twisting by employing tetraphenylpyrazine as the core. PffBT-T3(1,2)-2 is an efficient donor polymer with a PCE result higher than 10% with PC71BM.149 By taking an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PffBT-T3(1,2)-2:TPPz-PDI4/MoO3/Al, the blend active layer shows the best result of round 7.0%. Sharma and co-workers designed and synthesized two small molecule acceptors DPP5 and DPP6 composing 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene and the DPP building blocks.150 A physicochemical study shows that these two acceptors display absorption reaching the NIR region and thus have low bandgaps of 1.58 eV and 1.46 eV, respectively. They also possess a low LUMO energy level below −4.2 eV. Their photovoltaic performance is 3.90% for DPP5 and 4.95% for DPP6 by using the polymer donor151 after solvent annealing treatment. Recently, Gregory's group developed an acceptor di-PDI-N and it exhibits the best PCE value of higher than 7.0% with donor P3TEA.152 Li and co-workers obtained an acceptor SdiCNPBI with a low LUMO energy level by introducing two CN functional groups at the bay position of PDI. However, it shows a low PCE value of around 1.4%.153 By combining benzothiadiazole (BT) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) building blocks, Jo's group obtained an acceptor DTDfBT(TDPP)2 with a very small bandgap of about 1.5 eV.154 This molecule has main absorption ranging from 500 nm to 800 nm and a LUMO of −4.33 eV. By using PTB7 as the donor, a PCE of about 5.0% is obtained. Chen's group designed and synthesized an acceptor DTBTF with a fluorene central building block and thiobarbituric acid as the terminal end.155 By using the small molecule DR3TSBDT developed by the same group as the donor, the blend film shows a PCE of 3.84%, and a Voc value as high as 1.15 V is obtained. Hence, DTBTF shows one of the smallest energy losses of only about 0.59 eV.
Hou's group designed and synthesized a new modified non-fullerene acceptor IEICO from IEIC by replacing the alkyl chain into the alkoxy chain.156 UV and CV studies in Fig. 33 show that IEICO shows an apparent elevation of the HOMO energy level of about 0.15 eV and a slightly decreased LUMO energy level of about 0.05 eV compared with IEIC. Due to the reduction of the bandgap of IEICO, it has large red-shifted absorption in comparison with IEIC for both the solution and the film. By using PBDTTT-E-T71 as the donor material and the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO/PFN-Br/Al, the PCE value for IEICO is up to 8.3% while the PCE is only 4.7% for IEIC. As displayed in Fig. 34, given the similar Voc values, IEICO exhibits a much higher Jsc, and the EQE curve (800 to 900 nm) indicates that absorption from the acceptor in the blend film contributes significantly to the formation of the photocurrent. The AFM study reveals better phase separation for IEICO than for IEIC, which may be beneficial for a better FF value. It is worth mentioning that the energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc) is as low as 0.52 eV, which is among the lowest values reported.157

ITIC is a very efficient non-fullerene acceptor and its blending film with PTB7-Th can show the best PCE value of around 7%. Recently, Li's group developed a median bandgap polymer J61 that also works well with ITIC and exhibits the best PCE value of higher than 9.2%.29 The author ascribed the improved PCE value to the stronger interchain interaction and the shorter π–π stacking distance for the donor in the blend film. By using a novel developed donor PBDB-T, its blend film with ITIC exhibits a certified high PCE value of 10.8% with the device structure ITO/ZnO/BHJ-layer/MoO3/Al.30 Further subtle modification of ITIC by introducing a methyl group produces the ITIC derivative ITIC-M that displays a slightly higher LUMO energy level than ITIC, which may favor a higher Voc value. Hence, an even higher certified PCE value of 11.6% is obtained.31 By shifting the alkyl chain C6H13 from the para position to the meta position, the isomer acceptor m-ITIC was developed. Physicochemical studies indicate that, compared with ITIC, this acceptor shows an enhanced film absorption coefficient, a larger crystalline coherence, and higher as well as balanced hole and electron mobility, which contribute to a much higher PCE value of 11.5%.158
From the above discussion, there are some implications and challenges for non-fullerene acceptor development.
Implications
(1) A suitable energy level as well as complementary absorption is prerequisite for obtaining a high PCE value.
It is well known that broad absorption will enable the active layer to receive photons as much as possible and a suitable offset between the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor as well as their HOMOs will provide sufficient driving force for the dissociation and transportation of the charge. To achieve complementary absorption, appropriately choosing matched donor and acceptor materials is important. For example, for median bandgap polymer donors, such as P3HT and J51 that have main absorption from 400 to 600 nm, acceptors with absorption reaching the IR region are necessary for achieving a higher short current, e.g. IDT-2BR69 and its analogous acceptors.68 For low bandgap polymer donors, such as PTB7-Th, PDBT-T1 and PSEHTT, non-fullerene acceptors based on PDI derivatives98,110,111 or FBIs121 will work well with them. Compared with the design and synthesis of novel polymers or acceptors to realize our target to modify the energy level and absorption range, the doping method or the ternary component method may be an easier and possible method to further improve the PCE performance, considering the success of this strategy in the study of donor materials in recent years.159 As a matter of fact, by making use of both the advantages of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors and adopting a wide-bandgap polymer donor (PPBDTBT), Bo and coworkers recently developed a very effcient ternary D:A1:A2 OSCs system (PPBDTBT:PC71BM and ITIC), which exhibits the highest PCE of 10.4% with a Jsc of 16.7 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 mV and a FF of 0.68.160
(2) A large π-conjugated system with high electron mobility or a well-balanced electron/hole mobility ratio as well as a suitable film morphology will be beneficial for a higher PCE performance.
The fullerene acceptor PC71BM generally has electron mobility on the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the blend film.121 In this review, most non-fullerene acceptors with a PCE value higher than 8% possess higher electron mobility on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and balanced electron and hole mobility. It is worth mentioning that, for Yu's work, although the PCE value is higher than 8% for the acceptor TPB, it has a comparatively low electron mobility of 6.10 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a hole mobility of about 1.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.98 In addition, recent studies revealed that a film morphology with appropriate phase separation, face-on packing, and an appropriate domain size with high purity is important for achieving higher PCE performance.28,115 Thus, it is highly desirable to further understand the relationship between film morphology, electron/hole mobilities (ratio) and final PCE performance.
(3) Some subtle modifications will affect the PCE value significantly.
In this review, we evaluate and compare the photovoltaic performances for different non-fullerene acceptors by using the same donor material. Generally speaking, with a totally different molecule architecture, the acceptors may have totally different PCE values. For the molecules with similar structures, they will exhibit similar physicochemical properties and PCE performances. However, some subtle modifications will also bring significantly different results. For example, compared with the acceptor SF-DPPEH,57 the acceptor SF(DPPB)458 just has one more phenyl group in the terminal part. However, SF(DPPB)4 exhibits a much higher PCE value of about 5.1% than that (3.6%) of SF-DPPEH. So does the acceptor IEICO, which possesses an alkoxy chain compared with the acceptor IEIC with an alkyl chain. Photovoltaic studies indicate that these two acceptors exhibit significantly different PCE values of 8.3% and 4.7%, respectively. Therefore, for a successful non-fullerene acceptor system, the subtle adjustment of the structure to further improve the PCE is also necessary.
Challenges
From the above discussion, there are still some challenges that need to be overcome.
(1) More and more novel and efficient electron-deficient building blocks with high electron mobility need to be developed and utilized for OSC non-fullerene acceptors.
In this review, it can be concluded explicitly that the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors is accompanied by the design, synthesis and application of novel building blocks. Some examples include the IEIC or ITIC acceptors taking advantage of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene) malononitrile as the electron-withdrawing terminal units developed by Zhan's group,105,106 the sulfur or selenium hetero-fused PDI systems discovered by Wang's group109,110 and the BFI unit innovated by Jenekhe's group.119 As a matter of fact, Takimiya's group also developed some interesting NDTI or NTI building blocks and obtained both promising PCE results and high electron mobility.161–163
(2) Reducing Eloss is another challenging issue.
At present, there are many successful non-fullerene acceptors that exhibit PCE results higher than 8.0%. But for most of them, the Eloss is still higher than 0.7 eV, which will affect the Voc values of the device. Several groups have reported efficient PCE systems with an Eloss of around 0.6 eV (IDSe-T-IC)123 or even lower than 0.6 eV (IEICO).156 However, there are still no clear guidelines to solve this issue. Therefore, more and more non-fullerene acceptors with high PCE and Voc values as well as low Eloss should be developed.
(3) More efficient donor polymers or small molecules still need to be prepared.
The rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors in the last few years is partially ascribed to the accumulation of the intensive study on donor materials during the past decade, which provides various efficient donor materials and valuable experience to test the photovoltaic properties of newly developed acceptors. For example, the photovoltaic performance of ITIC has been increased step by step from 6.8% to 9.2% to 10.7% by adopting different donors, PTB7-Th,106 J6129 and PBDB-T.30 Therefore, to further increase the PCE of OSCs and realize their commercial/practical application, consistent progress in OSC donor materials is necessary. As a matter of fact, one novel wide-bandgap polymer PBT1-EH has been synthesized by Sun's group and it works well with both the fullerene acceptor PCBM and the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC-Th and their PCE performances are all over 10%.164
Conclusions
In conclusion, we firstly discussed the recently published non-fullerene acceptors according to different donor polymers in OSCs and highlighted some interesting studies. Secondly, we also tried to summarize some guidelines for further design and synthesis of novel non-fullerene acceptors. Meanwhile, the challenges in this field are also proposed. It is anticipated that more efficient novel non-fullerene acceptors will be developed and a much higher PCE value will be obtained in the near future. Moreover, non-fullerene materials have been used in photodetectors or perovskite solar cells, which indicates that non-fullerene materials may have great potential applications in organic optoelectronic devices.165–167
