    , Accepted 19th January 2021First published on 20th January 2021AbstractUltrathin two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (2D MOFs) have recently attracted extensive interest in various catalytic fields (e.g., electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, thermocatalysis) due to their ultrathin thickness, large surface area, abundant accessible unsaturated active sites and tunable surface properties. Besides tuning the intrinsic properties of pristine 2D MOFs by changing the metal nodes and organic ligands, one of the hot research trends is to develop 2D MOF hybrids and 2D MOF-derived materials with higher stability and conductivity in order to further increase their activity and durability. Here, the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets is briefly summarized and discussed. More attention is focused on summaries and discussions about the applications of these 2D MOFs, their hybrids and their derived materials as electrocatalysts, photocatalysts and thermocatalysts. The superior properties and catalytic performance of these 2D MOF-based catalysts compared to their 3D MOF counterparts in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and thermocatalysis are highlighted. The enhanced activities of 2D MOFs, their hybrids and derivatives come from abundant accessible active sites, a high density of unsaturated metal nodes, ultrathin thickness, and tunable microenvironments around the MOFs. Views regarding current and future challenges in the field, and new advances in science and technology to meet these challenges, are also presented. Finally, conclusions and outlooks in this field are provided.
1. Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of metal nodes coordinated to organic ligands (e.g., carboxylate ligands and other negatively charged ligands) have attracted remarkable interest due to their tailorable composition and structures, high surface area and porosity, and modifiable surface properties.1,2 MOFs with so many unique features have been investigated for various applications, such as gas storage and separation, energy storage and conversion, catalysis, and biomedicine.3,4 So far, various MOFs (e.g., bulk MOF crystals, two-dimensional (2D) MOF nanosheets, 1D MOF nanowires, 0D MOF nanoparticles, hierarchically mesoporous MOFs) with specific sizes, shapes and compositions have been prepared and investigated for special applications.5 Compared with their 3D forms, 2D MOF nanosheets have attracted tremendous research interest due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties, namely, ultrathin layer thickness, high specific surface area, high aspect ratio, abundant exposed unsaturated metal sites, adjustable chemical composition and identifiable surface atomic structures. The ultrathin layers of 2D MOF nanosheets with abundant accessible unsaturated metal sites are favorable for the contact of reactants with the active sites, the rapid diffusion of reactants and products, the efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers, or the transfer of electrolytes and electrons, which are supposed to possess better catalytic activity than their 3D counterparts in electrocatalytic, photocatalytic or thermocatalytic applications. Up to now, 2D MOF-based catalysts have attracted widespread research interest in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and thermocatalysis.6–8
In recent years, remarkable efforts have been attributed to the synthesis of 2D MOF-based materials and the investigation of their structure–performance correlation in catalytic fields. Based on their catalytic application fields (e.g., electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and thermocatalysis), the catalytic performance of 2D MOF-based materials can be precisely tuned via controlling the unsaturated metal nodes, choosing diverse organic ligands with conjugated structures or functional groups, and functionalizing them via post-synthetic modification. In addition, 2D MOFs can also act as supports for the incorporation of single atom catalysts, encapsulation of nanoparticles and anchoring of molecular catalysts due to their ultrathin nanosheet morphology and large lateral size.
However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize 2D MOF nanosheets with controllable thickness, high yield and uniformity. It also requires further exploration to investigate efficient 2D MOF-based catalysts with high performance and durability. In this minireview, recent progress in the synthesis of 2D MOF-based materials will be briefly summarized and discussed, and more attention is focused on their applications in electrocatalysis, especially in photocatalysis and thermocatalysis, which have rarely been summarized and discussed. Also, current and future challenges in the field, and new advances in science and technology to meet these challenges, are also presented. The last part of this review not only provides original and meaningful opinions on several key factors that play vital roles in boosting the catalytic performance of 2D MOF-based materials in different catalytic fields, but also proposes some reasonable procedures for the future development of 2D MOF-based catalysts to overcome the present imminent challenges. We hope readers can extract meaningful information from this review to have a deeper understanding of the design of 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts, photocatalysts and electrocatalysts with high performance, and even to develop other high-performance catalytic materials.
2. Synthesis of 2D MOF-based materials
Although many 2D MOFs have been synthesized and reported in the last decade for various applications, it is still a great challenge to synthesize 2D MOFs with controllable thickness and high yield. The key point in the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets is to hinder the vertical growth or exfoliation of MOFs without affecting that in the other two lateral directions. The synthetic strategies for 2D MOFs are discussed in several existing reviews.6–14 Traditionally, there are two main kinds of methods to synthesize 2D MOF nanosheets, that is, a “top-down” stratification strategy, a “bottom-up” method and the combination of the two methods, as summarized in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  General procedures for the synthesis of 2D MOFs by bottom-up, top-down, and combined methods. 
2.1 Top-down synthetic strategy
The first strategy is a simple and straightforward top-down approach, in which thin 2D MOFs are obtained directly from layered MOFs by ultrasonic stripping or mechanical lamination. However, it is usually difficult to control the exfoliation process, especially by sonication and grinding, leading to the formation of 2D MOFs with nonuniform size and thickness.15 The key to improved exfoliation efficiency is to reduce the surface energy of the monolayer by adding different solvents and intercalating agents.16–18 However, the yield of the as-prepared 2D MOF nanosheets obtained by the top-down strategy was always very low, and the obtained MOF nanosheets could be restacked to form 3D MOF crystals again after exfoliation. In the top-down strategy, several exfoliation methods have been reported, such as sonication or microwave assisted exfoliation, shaking treatment, ball-milling/sonication exfoliation, mechanical delamination, and intercalation/chemical exfoliation, to break the van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding or p–p stacking between MOF layers.16–21
Because the adjacent layers in MOFs are bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, it is easy to insert something between the layers and separate the middle layer and the layer in contact with the solution, thus the MOFs are stripped into ultrathin 2D nanosheets in the liquid phase.22 Thus, the exfoliation efficiency can be increased via several methods, such as increasing the sonication power density, improving the hydrophobicity of the building blocks, and weakening the interlayer interaction by intercalation of additives or agents. For example, single-layer 2D MOF nanosheets were prepared from 3D pillared-layer MOFs ([M2(bdc)(dabco)]–guest (M = Zn, Co, Ni, H2bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane)) by the synergistic action of guest interactions and sonication (Fig. 2a), in which interlayer bonding was selectively broken through exchanging the pillared ligands (i.e., dabco) by capping-end guest molecules (i.e., H2O) and simultaneous sonication exfoliation in H2O.18 In another work, 4,4′-dipyridyl disulfide was firstly intercalated into the intrinsically layered porphyrinic MOF crystals through coordination bonding with the metal nodes, and then individual ultrathin (∼1 nm) 2D MOF nanosheets were formed via chemical exfoliation using trimethylphosphine to selectively cleave the disulfide bond (Fig. 2b).16 Besides chemical exfoliation, ultrasonic exfoliation in mixed solvents with different polarity is another effective strategy to obtain 2D MOFs with thicknesses of several nanometers.8,17,21,23 During mechanical lamination, the shear force generated by the volume change between the solid and liquid phases of hexane will act on the suspended mesh adjustable molecular sieve crystal (Fig. 2c), resulting in the formation of discrete 2D MOF nanosheets during repeated freeze–thaw cycles.24 Compared with ultrasonic stripping, this method causes less damage to the MOF morphology, resulting in a large transverse size of the film. Very recently, the exfoliation of MOF nanocrystals into 2D MOF nanosheets with a thickness as thin as a single layer can be achieved by introducing chemicals (e.g., n-butyllithium) to break interlayer bonds.25 In future research, it is desirable to develop highly efficient approaches for the synthesis of ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets with high yields from their bulk counterparts.26

2.2 Bottom-up synthetic strategy
Another widely adopted strategy is direct bottom-up synthesis, which is preferrable for the fabrication of 2D MOF nanosheets with high yield, controllable thickness, large lateral sizes, and good dispersion from metal ions and organic ligands directly.27,28 The key point in the bottom-up synthetic strategy is to impede the growth of MOFs in the direction perpendicular to the layers. Several strategies (e.g., surfactant-assisted synthesis (Fig. 3a),27 molecule modulated synthesis (Fig. 3b),29,30 three-layer synthesis (Fig. 3c),31 interfacial reaction synthesis,32 sonication/microwave synthesis33–35) have been reported for the large-scale preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets with a monolayer or a few layers. In the bottom-up strategy, surfactants or modulators (e.g., triethylamine (TEA), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sorbitol-alkylamine) and/or external forces (e.g., sonication) are usually used in the direct solution synthesis process by limiting the stacking of MOF layers or controlling the thermodynamic/kinetic effects.27,33,36–38 Especially, modulators could react with organic ligands or solvents and act as modified organic ligands to competitively coordinate with the metal nodes and regulate the 2D anisotropic growth of MOFs.39 For example, 2D NiCo bimetallic MOF nanosheets can be prepared by mixing metal salts, benzenedicarboxylic acid and TEA together under sonication at room temperature.36 The surfactant molecules (e.g., TEA, PVP) firstly bind with organic ligands or metal ions to control the growth direction of MOFs to form ultrathin MOF nanosheets.40

2D metal–porphyrin MOF nanosheets are an important group of 2D MOFs.34,41 In their synthesis, surfactants (e.g., PVP or CTAB) or other organic molecules are usually used to induce anisotropic growth.23,27,29,42–47 During the bottom-up synthetic strategy, ultrasonication, which can realize rapid local heating and cooling, is adopted to synthesize 2D MOF nanosheets with abundant active sites and eliminate the limitations of mass permeability and electrical conductivity. With the development of new techniques, surfactant-free bottom-up strategies have been recently reported for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets.36 Interfacial fabrication, including gas–liquid interfacial synthesis and diffusion-mediated growth at the liquid–liquid interface, is also effective to synthesize several kinds of 2D MOF nanosheets. The synthesis medium involves a topmost solution of metal ions and a bottom solution of organic ligands, separated by an intermediate solvent layer (e.g., metal acetate solution).31,48 The metal ion solution was atomized by ultrasonic treatment, and then sprayed onto the surface of the organic ligand solution in the culture dish to reduce the interference of contact between the two reaction solutions.49 A new type of bis(dipyrrinato) zinc(II) complex nanosheet was synthesized by liquid–liquid interface synthesis of the dipyrrole porphyrin ligands and zinc acetate.50 The gas–liquid interface synthetic method mostly forms monolayer nanosheets, and the liquid–liquid interface synthetic method can produce multilayer nanosheets.
In the bottom-up synthetic strategy, solid substrates (e.g., nickel foam, graphene nanosheets, reduced graphene oxide, 2D g-C3N4) have been reported to prepare ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets on them via chemical interaction, electrostatic attraction, Coulomb interaction, and π–π stacking.51–58 In the presence of the substrate, the organic ligand molecules and metal ions are coordinated or adsorbed on the solid substrate to form 2D MOF layers with a thickness of several nanometers (Fig. 3d).52–54,58 2D MOFs can also be synthesized from 2D LDHs with controllable morphology and composition.59 In the bottom-up synthetic strategy, atomically precise structures of 2D MOFs are of great importance to design and synthesize target MOFs with desirable properties and applications.60
2.3 Combined synthetic strategy
There are advantages and disadvantages to the top-down and bottom-up synthetic strategies. The main disadvantages of top-down synthetic strategies are the too low exfoliation yield and efficiency for 2D MOF nanosheets, and the easy aggregation/restacking of the exfoliated nanosheets. Whereas for the bottom-up synthetic strategies, the main disadvantage is the difficulty in selectively controlling the growth of 2D MOF nanosheets, even with the assistance of surfactants and sonification. Therefore, more facile methods are desirable for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with high yield, stability, and large lateral size with good crystallinity. Recently, several combined synthetic strategies, integrating the advantages of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, were exploited to prepare 2D MOFs with underlying structures. Up to now, crystal transformation,61–63 electrochemical/chemical exfoliation,64 pseudoassembly–disassembly strategy65,66 and sonication of surfactant-assisted MOFs67 have been exploited for the synthesis of 2D MOFs. In the crystal transformation process, a ligand-deficient layered hafnium-containing MOF, hcp UiO-67(Hf), was delaminated to form 2D MOF nanosheets through the cleavage of strong hafnium–carboxylate bonds with the assistance of sonication in methanol (Fig. 4a).61 Recently, a combined electrochemical/chemical exfoliation strategy was reported for the synthesis of 2D MOFs from 3D pillared-layer MOFs, in which the pillar ligands coordinated with metal nodes were selectively oxidized with lower coordination ability and then removed (Fig. 4b).64 During the synthesis of 3D MOFs, surfactants with hydrophilic or hydrophobic tails can be added as competitive coordinating agents to chemically coordinate the metal nodes and control the anisotropic growth of MOFs, and 2D MOFs can be formed via a pseudo-assembly process or external sonication, such as the fabrication of 2D UiO-66 nanosheets via sorbitol-alkylamine-mediated synthesis (Fig. 4c),65 the synthesis of ultrathin 2D conjugated MOF single-crystalline nanosheets (i.e., HHB-Cu (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene)) with a thickness of 4–5 nm assisted by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Fig. 4d).67 In these combined synthetic strategies, the layered 3D MOF crystals inserted with surfactants via the formation of weaker coordination bonds can be further exfoliated to 2D nanosheets via electrochemical exfoliation, mechanical exfoliation and sonication exfoliation, while the 2D MOF nanosheets coordinated with stronger bonds can maintain their 2D nanosheet morphology during these treatments.

The high stability of 2D MOF nanosheets under harsh reaction conditions is also attractive for catalysts or catalyst supports with potential good performance. Generally, the key point in the preparation of 2D MOFs with controllable thickness, high yield, and larger lateral size in the top-down approach is to weaken the interactions between the interlayers, while it is to control the MOF's growth in the direction perpendicular to the layers in the bottom-up approach. In the combined synthetic strategies, the layers are usually coordinated with weak interactions, which can be further broken via sonication or mechanical force.
3. Electrocatalytic applications of 2D MOF-based materials
Up to now, 2D MOFs and their derived catalysts have been demonstrated to be effective in various electrocatalytic processes, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and organic molecule oxidation.7,8,10,68–73 Because research progress for 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-derived electrocatalysts has been summarized and discussed in several reviews, especially for the OER and ORR, in this section, the recent applications of 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-derived electrocatalysts will be briefly summarized and discussed. More focus will be made on their applications in the HER, the CO2RR, the NRR, the UOR and organic molecule oxidation.
3.1 2D MOF-based materials for the OER
Electrochemical water splitting through the cathodic HER and the anodic OER is considered to be an important route for the production of H2 and O2. Due to the sluggish kinetics and the high activation energy barrier for multi-step electron transfer processes of the OER, efficient and durable electrocatalysts with significant stability are strongly desirable. IrO2 and RuO2 are well-recognized electrocatalysts for the OER, although their high cost and low abundance hinder their large-scale applications. MOFs and MOF-derived materials have been widely studied as OER electrocatalysts.74 Among them, 2D MOFs with unique properties, such as larger specific surface area and faster electron transfer processes, have been demonstrated to possess excellent performance in the OER.
A series of efforts have been attributed to the development of 2D transition metal-based MOF catalysts, such as Ni, Co, and Fe-based catalysts, which appear adjacent to the noble metals in volcano plots. First, several single transition metal-based 2D MOFs (e.g., 2D Co-MOF ultrathin nanosheets75,76) have been reported to exhibit certain good electrocatalytic OER performances. The electrocatalytic OER performance of single transition metal-based 2D MOFs (e.g., Ni-based MOFs) can be enhanced via tuning the oxidation state of metal ions (Ni2+/Ni3+), promoting the charge transfer process and improving the hydrophilicity of 2D MOFs by introducing electron-rich bis(5-azabenzimidazole) and dicarboxylate organic struts.77 The generation of Ni cations with higher oxidation states can also be realized by constructing 2D Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)2 hybrid nanosheets, leading to high activity, favorable kinetics and strong durability toward the OER.78
In 2016, Tang et al., for the first time, reported that ultrathin 2D NiCo-MOF nanosheets loaded on nickel foam could exhibit an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a remarkable stability for at least 200 h and a Faraday efficiency as high as 99.3% in the electrocatalytic OER, which was attributed to the unsaturated metal atoms and the coupling effect between Ni and Co.36 Since this enlightening work, numerous ultrathin bimetallic (e.g., NiFe, NiCo, CoFe, NiV) MOFs,33,64,79–87 and even trimetallic (e.g., Fe/Ni/Co, Fe/Ni/Mn) MOFs,88–91 have been synthesized and applied as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the OER via tuning the metal node species, bimetallic ratios and the ligand species. Experimental and calculated results show that the bimetallic 2D MOF nanosheets lead to an increase in the electrochemically active area and reaction sites, accompanied by the functions of accelerating electron transport and adjusting the electronic structure. Besides traditional research work, plasmonic Au nanoparticles supported on semiconductor-like NiCo-MOF nanosheets can reach several-fold higher currents than those of pure CoNi-MOFs in the electrocatalytic OER process, and an ultra-low overpotential is obtained when Au NPs with a size of ∼20 nm were added due to the hot holes generated by Au nanoparticles.92,93 Pt nanoparticles embedded ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets were also reported to exhibit remarkable enhancement in activity and durability of both the OER and ORR due to the synergistic effect between Pt nanoparticles and 2D MOF nanosheets through a “win–win” electron structural modification.94
For pristine 2D MOF electrocatalysts, the activity of the electrocatalysts not only depends on their composition and electrical conductivity, but is also affected by the electrode geometry, structural porosity, accessible active centers, and interfacial coupling of the employed catalysts. Even though their OER performance can be improved by tuning the metal node and ligand species and their ratios, as well as introducing noble metal nanoparticles, their poor conductivity, relatively high overpotentials at high current density and a strong tendency to aggregate limit their practical applications. To further improve the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic performance of 2D MOFs for the electrocatalytic OER, conductive substrates, such as metal foams,36,58,59,90,91,95,96 graphitic carbon,97 graphene,54 MXene Ti3C2Tx nanosheets98 and CoNiAl-layered double hydroxide/nickel foam (CoNiAl-LDH/NF),99 have been reported as supports for 2D MOFs with enhanced OER performance. In some cases, nickel foam not only acts as the conductive support for 2D MOFs to improve electron and electrolyte transfer, but also provides nickel species for the in situ formation of Ni-containing 2D MOFs during the solvothermal reaction.58,95,96 The ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets grown on nickel foams enable rapid charge transfer between the current collector and the active sites of the 2D MOF nanosheets. Recently, a novel 3D hierarchical ZIF-67/CoNiAl-LDH/NF electrocatalyst on 3D nickel foam with the combination of the unique properties of LDHs and 2D MOF materials was reported as an excellent candidate for OER electrocatalysis with desirable activity, which was attributed to the combination of merits such as fully exposed and accessible active sites, increased surface areas, strongly coupled interfaces, and an interconnected 3D electrically conductive porous skeleton.99
There are tens of thousands of MOFs with various metal nodes and organic ligands. Theoretical predictions of potential OER electrocatalysts from many MOF candidates are of great importance and cost-effective. Recently, we reported a high-throughput periodic density functional theory (DFT) workflow to identify a potential organic primer from thousands of primers based on the consideration of an energetically favorable anchoring process, thermodynamically prohibited self-polymerization side reaction and high delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 5a–d).54 Based on the computational results, the phenylenebisboronic acid (PBA) primer was chosen from 1584 candidates and covalently bonded to graphene, which then induced the growth of ultrathin Ni-MOF nanosheets (denoted as Ni-HMOF@GE-PBA) (Fig. 5e). The electrocatalytic results (Fig. 5f–i) show that the as-prepared Ni-HMOF@GE-PBA delivered a much lower onset potential than that of the simple blending of graphene and Ni-MOF nanosheets at 150 mV.

Introducing conductive supports into 2D MOF hybrid electrocatalysts could increase the electric conductivity and OER performance, whereas supported MOFs are still highly unstable in acidic and alkaline electrolytes for the OER. To resolve the durability issues, the thermal annealing of MOFs to derive carbon materials, metal oxides, phosphides, sulfides, etc. is the most widely used strategy.69,100–105Via tuning the organic ligands and annealing conditions, various kinds of 2D MOF-derived electrocatalysts (e.g., 2D independent nitrogen-doped Ni-Ni3S2@carbon nanoplates,106 Co/CoOx nanoparticles confined within graphitic carbon coating,107 trimetallic layered double hydroxide nanosheets derived from 2D MOFs,108 Co–Fe–Ni trimetallic carbon nanoflowers109) have been investigated for the OER. The organic ligands and surfactants containing N and C elements can act as N and C sources during the annealing process under inert gas atmospheres (e.g., N2, Ar), and the N-doping of graphitized carbon provides electron transfer pathways to promote the OER performance.
For an overview of research into 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts for the OER, the overpotentials and Tafel slopes for the OER performance of reported 2D MOFs, 2D MOF hybrids or 2D MOF-derived electrocatalysts are summarized in Table 1, demonstrating their great potential as efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline OER. Reports on 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts for the acidic OER are still scare, maybe due to their poor stability or poor performance under acidic conditions. It also clearly shows that the introduction of conductive supports (e.g., nickel foam, copper foil, copper foam) could lead to smaller overpotentials due to rapid electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion in the hierarchically conductive supports. In addition, up to now, most attention has been focused on the synthesis and investigation of 2D bimetallic or trimetallic MOF nanosheets with enhanced OER performance, arising from the synergetic effects between the metal nodes.

3.2 2D MOF-based materials for the HER
As a renewable and clean energy, hydrogen can meet increasing energy demands and ease the energy crisis. At present, a more attractive way to produce H2 is to split renewable water into hydrogen and oxygen, and electrochemical methods are considered to be an effective and feasible way to achieve this transformation. In recent years, MOFs and MOF-derived materials have been well demonstrated to be promising electrocatalysts for the HER, potentially replacing the most famous current platinum-based materials. Pure MOFs usually have poor stability in acidic and alkaline media for HER tests. Only a few 2D MOF nanosheets have been reported for the electrocatalytic HER in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, such as metal dithiolene-diamine (MS2N2, M = Co and Ni) incorporated into carbon-rich 2D MOFs,110 2D conductive MOFs with extra metallic sites and conjugated structures111 and Ni0.3Co0.7-based MOF nanosheets on a nickel foam.112
Interfacial engineering related work was carried out by constructing NiFe-MOF/nickel foam,58 MoS2/Co-MOF nanocomposite113,114 and 2D Ni-MOF/Pt hybrid.115,116 For 2D Co-BDC/MoS2 (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, C8H4O4) hybrid nanosheets, Co-BDC acts as an electron donor for water dissociation in the alkaline HER, and coupling Co-BDC with MoS2 induces partial phase transfer from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 (hexagonal phase (2H) and trigonal phase (1T) of MoS2) and enhances the conductivity.114 In addition, 1T-MoS2 activates the inert basal plane to expose more active sites compared with pristine 2H-MoS2, which is highly desirable for H2 generation in the HER.
In another work, with respect to the interfacial effect, Ni-MOF@Pt with well-defined interfaces was achieved via the formation of Pt–oxygen bonding with abundant available oxygen sites on the defect-rich surface of ultrathin MOF nanosheets, and Ni-MOF@Pt was demonstrated to deliver exceptional electrochemical HER performance with a low overpotential of 43 mV in an acidic medium and an overpotential of 102 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH due to the modulated electronic structure of noble metal nanoparticles.115 In another work, both experimental results and theoretical calculations verified that the newly formed Ni–O–Pt interfacial bonds in Pt nanocrystals/2D Ni-MOF hybrid increased the electron density for Pt and the high-energy Ni 3d state for the MOF, increasing the OH* adsorption energy and reducing the H* adsorption energy (Fig. 6).116 This hybridized material delivered a HER activity of 7.92 mA mg μg−1 Pt and a highly improved OER activity.

Undoubtedly, platinum is one of the most active catalysts for HER, which can reach a high current density at low overpotentials.117 However, their high cost and low abundance on Earth limit their large-scale industrial use in the HER. It is highly desirable to develop more efficient noble metal-free HER electrocatalysts. In order to increase the durability and HER performance, 2D MOF-derived transition metal phosphide, sulfide, oxide and carbon materials have been reported as HER electrocatalysts under both acidic and alkaline conditions.103,107,118 In a separate study, non-noble metal layered CuS@C synthesized via the sulfidation of 2D Cu-BDC nanosheets acted as an efficient HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 128 mV and a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under acidic conditions due to the high specific surface area, the percentage of exposed active sites and improved charge transfer of the derived electrocatalysts.118 Furthermore, in cooperation with the protection of the carbon matrix, CuS@C showed a high electrocatalytic stability over a wide pH value range.
For an overview of research progress for 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts for the HER, the overpotentials and Tafel slopes for the HER performance of reported 2D MOFs, 2D MOF hybrids or 2D MOF-derived electrocatalysts are summarized in Table 2, demonstrating their great potential as efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline or acidic HERs. It also clearly shows that the introduction of conductive supports (e.g., nickel foam, reduced graphene oxide, carbon) and noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Pt) could greatly lead to reduced overpotentials and small Tafel slopes.

3.3 2D MOF-based materials for the ORR
Among many energy conversion technologies, the ORR is one of the most important cathode reactions for fuel cells and metal–air cells.119 At present, Pt/C is the most effective commercial electrocatalyst for the ORR, whereas the scarcity and high cost of Pt hinder the large-scale implementation of these technologies. Over the past decade, a number of alternative materials have been reported as possible replacements for Pt catalysts. In particular, a variety of hierarchical nanocarbons and heteroatom (nitrogen, sulfur, boron)-doped nanocarbons are proven to have good electrocatalytic ORR activity and stability due to the electron and geometric structure modification.120–122
Thanks to their various composition (e.g., metal nodes, organic ligands) and framework structure choices, MOF-based catalysts provide a great number of opportunities to accelerate the sluggish ORR in fuel cells and metal–air batteries.122–124 Among the various kinds of MOF-based ORR electrocatalysts, ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets and their derived materials with high O2 accessibility and rapid mass transport, high proportion of unsaturated metal sites, and rapid transfer of electrons also attracted remarkable attention and interest.125–131 For example, a nitrogen-doped graphene nanomesh was obtained by thermal exfoliation of MOF nano-leaves by using metal chlorides as the exfoliators and etching agents, exhibiting high catalytic activity for the ORR in acid electrolytes due to the unique ultrathin 2D morphology with a thickness of 1.3 nm, abundant nanopores, highly accessible nitrogen-doped active sites, and defective graphene edges.129 For another example, 2D ceria@Co,N-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Ce-HPCNs) derived from a 2D MOF demonstrated superior electrocatalytic ORR performance to that of commercial Pt/C due to the synergetic effect of the oxygen buffer and CeO2 with Co–Nx.125 The positive effect of ceria with abundant oxygen vacancies and strong O2 adsorption capacity on the electrocatalytic performance can be reached in our previous review.132
Generally, most MOFs cannot be directly applied in the field of the electrocatalytic ORR due to their low electric conductivity and metal centers being blocked by organic ligands. Due to the advantages of open active sites and effective contact between more conductive Mn species and the electrolyte, a 2D Mn-MOF was found to give an energy density of 9464 mA h g−1 on the cathode in aprotic Li–O2 batteries, and maintain a specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 after stable operation at 100 mA g−1 for 200 cycles.128 Besides the strategy of choosing a suitable metal node,130 constructing metallic or bimetallic conductive 2D MOFs coordinated with conjugated organic ligands are also helpful to improve the ORR performance, which results from the high electronic conductivity and/or the synergetic effects between the diverse metal nodes.126,127,131 For instance, a phthalocyanine-based 2D conjugated MOF (PCCu-O8-Co) with a highly ordered porous framework and 2D conjugated structure, mixed with carbon nanotubes, was demonstrated to exhibit good electrocatalytic ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.83 V vs. RHE, n = 3.93, and jL = 5.3 mA cm−2) in alkaline media.126 In another work, a bimetallic conductive CoxNiy-CAT compound with optimal composition not only has the characteristic of the high initial potential of Ni-CAT, but also retains the advantage of the high diffusion limit current density of Co-CAT.127
The core features of 2D MOFs, such as high gas accessibility, high density of active sites and fast electrolyte diffusion, make them potential candidates as ORR electrocatalysts, whereas the low conductivity of 2D MOFs usually results in poor ORR performance. It is possible to improve the ORR performance of 2D MOFs via adding conductive additives (such as carbon black, carbon nanotube) into the system or by introducing conjugated organic ligands with fast electron transfer ability into the framework. The use of 2D MOF-derived materials with high conductivity or active metal species is another potential strategy.
3.4 2D MOF-based materials for the CO2RR
The application of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the preparation of fuels and value-added chemicals is a current hot research topic and much attention has been given to this reaction. A key challenge in the field of the electrochemical CO2RR is the design of catalysts based on Earth-abundant elements featuring high product selectivity and stability. MOF-based electrocatalysts have also been extensively exploited for the CO2RR,133,134 whereas there are only several reports on the electrochemical CO2RR over 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts.135–138 For example, a 2D porous Bi-MOF was demonstrated to be a highly active electrocatalyst for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH with a Faraday efficiency of 92.2% for HCOOH formation at an overpotential of 0.65 V with exceptional stability over 30 h.135 The operando and ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that abundant accessible Bi3+ ions and one-dimensional channels in Bi-MOF promote CO2 adsorption and HCOOH formation, while suppressing the side-reaction of the HER. In another work, bimetallic 2D conjugated MOF layers (PcCu-O8-Zn) with copper-phthalocyanine (CuN4) as a ligand and zinc-bis(dihydroxy) (ZnO4) complex as a linkage were reported for the CO2RR by Feng et al., exhibiting a CO selectivity of 88%, a turnover frequency of 0.39 s−1 and excellent durability for at least 10 h.136 The synergistic catalysis mechanism for the CO2RR was revealed by contrast experiments combined with operando spectroelectrochemistry and theoretical calculations, revealing that the ZnO4 complex acted as the catalytic sites, while CuN4 centers promoted the protonation of adsorbed CO2.
Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted remarkable attention in various catalytic fields due to the high atom-usage efficiency and abundant unsaturated sites. Zhang et al. prepared 2D porphyrin-based MOF nanosheets anchored by a sequence of single metal atoms (MOF-NS-M, M = Co, Cu and Fe) with a highly-ordered mesoporous structure and applied as electrocatalysts for the CO2RR with the assistance of visible-light.138 MOF-NS-Co showed a CO faradaic efficiency of 98.7% at −0.6 V with remarkable durability under visible light, which was attributed to the fast initial electron transfer to CO2 to form the *COO− intermediate, resulting from sufficient exposed active sites, better conductivity, and an adjusted electron transfer pathway from porphyrin optical switches. Theoretical calculations and predictions of efficient 2D MOFs for the electrochemical CO2RR are also of great importance to quickly screen out potential candidates. Cui et al. comprehensively studied CO2 activation and conversion reactions of a series of novel 2D MOFs by using DFT calculations based on the consideration of 2D MOFs with the characteristics of SACs, and a Mo-based MOF was screened out to be a potential electrocatalyst with excellent activity and selectivity to methane for the CO2RR with a low free energy of 0.27 V with Mo terminated with O atoms.137 Even though this work did not provide any experimental evidence to support the calculation results, theoretical study is also an important tool for prediction.
Reports on the applications of 2D MOF-based materials for the CO2R are still rare. There is still a long way to go to be able to rationally design and prepare efficient 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-supported electrocatalysts for the CO2RR. The synergetic effects between metal nodes and organic ligands, as well as external assistance (e.g., visible light), should be further investigated for better performance and durability.
3.5 2D MOF-based materials for the NRR
In recent years, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia under mild conditions has attracted extensive attention for its relatively low energy consumption as compared with the traditional Haber–Bosch process, which needs high pressure and high temperature.139,140 Among the reported catalytic techniques for the NRR, the electrocatalytic NRR to ammonia (NH3) using renewable electricity over rationally designed electrocatalysts is of great benefit. MOF-based materials have great potentials as efficient NRR catalysts, even though only a few MOFs have been investigated.141,142 The key factors for MOFs affecting the performance of the electrochemical NRR are the unsaturated metal sites to bind with N2 with a high and selective affinity and the specific framework structure.
As compared with 3D MOF crystals, 2D MOF nanosheets with even more abundant unsaturated sites, shorter diffusion length, and faster electron transfer ability may exhibit even better NRR performance under mild conditions. Several efforts have been attributed to the application of 2D MOFs as electrocatalysts for the NRR. Cui et al. investigated the N2 and H2O adsorption on a sequence of 2D MOFs containing transient metal atoms with hexaaminobenzene through DFT calculations, indicating that conductive Mo-based 2D MOFs could act as effective electrocatalysts for the NRR to NH3 with a low overpotential of 0.18 V under mild conditions.143 In another theoretical study, the 2D Mo–porphyrin sheets were also calculated to exhibit the best catalytic performance for N2 capture and reduction to NH3 among several 2D transition metal (e.g., Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Nb, Mo, Ru) porphyrin sheets.144 Up to now, there are still no experimental results to demonstrate the potential catalytic performance of Mo-based MOFs for the electrocatalytic NRR to NH3. In experimental investigations, 2D bimetal-MOF nanosheets were demonstrated to be efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the OER and NRR, in which Co3Fe-MOFs achieve a NH3 yield of 8.79 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and a faradaic efficiency of 25.64% at −0.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.145
Generally, research into 2D MOF-based materials for the electrocatalytic NRR to NH3 is still in an early stage. Theoretical and experimental studies have been reported, whereas it is still not clear enough whether 2D Mo-based MOFs could exhibit superior performance or not, and how to choose the metal node species and ratio with optimized NRR performance. With the remarkable activity of single-atom catalysts in many other catalytic applications, single-atom catalysts templated by MOFs, even 2D MOF nanosheets for the electrocatalytic NRR, and their reaction mechanisms need to be further investigated.146
3.6 2D MOF-based materials for the electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules
During the past few years, electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules to value-added chemicals over homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts has become a commonly used environmentally-benign strategy due to their mild reaction conditions and high selectivity.147,148 In the applications for MOFs, especially 2D MOFs, electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules to functionalized molecules is still rare.149–155 In this section, we will briefly summarize the rare research progress in 2D MOFs for the electrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules to value-added chemicals, hoping to provide some guidance in this field.
In the electrocatalytic oxidation process, high oxidation states of metal species with high oxidative ability are crucial to achieve high yield and selectivity. Therefore, 2D MOFs (mainly Ni-based MOFs) with high active site density and high valence species have been reported for the electrochemical oxidation of molecules, such as urea oxidation by 2D Ni-MOF,151 oxidation of benzylamine to benzonitrile over multimetallic 2D conductive NiCoFe-MOFs,154 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid over 2D Ni-MOF and NiCoBDC.155 The doping of other metal species (e.g., Co and Fe) could optimize the electronic structure with the formation of high valence nickel species, which was regarded as the active sites for electrochemical oxidation. For example, a high yield (0058 mmol mg−1 h−1) and 78% faradaic efficiency of benzonitrile at 1.45 V were achieved over 2D conductive NiCoFe-MOFs due to their intrinsic electrically conductive structure and the optimized multimetallic coupling effect in the various redox mediators of metal species.155
To improve the conductivity of 2D MOFs, 2D Ni-MOF nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth with high surface area and conductivity and large porosity were reported for the electrooxidation of glucose in an alkaline solution.153 2,3,6,7,10,11-Hexaaminotriphenylene hexahydrochloride was selected from several different ligands as the best ligand for the synthesis of 2D conductive Ni-MOFs. Even though a 2D Hf-MOF supported on conductive multiwalled carbon nanotubes with interfacial interactions was reported for the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones,152 work on the electrochemical oxidation of molecules based on 2D MOFs is still rare. By introducing appropriate metal nodes, organic ligands and supports, the local electronic environment of metal cations and electronic conductivity can be well modified and improved, thus making it possible to design efficient 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts with high oxidation states for a wide range of oxidation reactions with high activity and selectivity.
3.7 Brief summary
Generally, 2D MOFs and their derivatives have been attracting increasing attention in electrochemical fields due to their superior properties. The ultrathin thickness, more accessible active sites and low diffusion limitation in the 2D MOF nanosheets have been demonstrated to possess the ability to significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity. Despite many exceptional features, research into 2D MOFs in electrochemical catalysis is still at an early stage, and most of the reported studies mainly focus on the OER and HER. 2D MOFs also showed great potential in the CO2RR, the NRR and electrochemical oxidation of organic molecules into value-added chemicals. There is plenty of room for further improvement in understanding the reaction mechanism to design much more efficient 2D MOF-based electrocatalysts. The improvement in conductivities and electrochemical performance can be achieved via designing pristine 2D MOFs, introducing conductive substrates for 2D MOFs, hybridizing 2D MOFs with other active materials, or post-annealing at high temperature.156
4. Photocatalytic applications of 2D MOF-based materials
The eco-environmental issues and energy crises have attracted tremendous attention in the last several decades. Photocatalysts using inexhaustible, sustainable and clean solar energy have become one promising strategy to decrease the usage of fossil fuels and exhaust emission. Since the first report using TiO2 as a semiconductor for photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen in 1972 by Fujishima, many photocatalysts have been reported for converting solar energy into electrical energy, heat energy, and chemical energy.157,158 In these explorations, MOFs have been widely investigated in photocatalytic applications in the last decades, including hydrogenation production,159,160 CO2 reduction,161,162 organic synthesis163,164 and degradation of organic pollutants.165 The catalytic performance of MOF photocatalysts is determined by their visible-light response ability, the positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, as well as the charge carrier mobilities. The six types of low-lying excited states in MOFs as a result of the different characters of the VB and CB edges are presented in Fig. 7.166 The main strategies to increase the lifetime and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers include metal-substitution, the introduction of reducible ligands, modification of the ligands with conjugated bonds, etc.
 Fig. 7  Representation of the six types of low-lying excited states that can be found in MOFs as a result of different characters of the valence band and conduction band edges. Photoinduced charge separation can be obtained from (A) ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and (B) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). Local emission can be obtained from (C) ligand-centered (LC) and (D) metal-centered (MC) excited states. In bi-ligand and bi-metallic MOFs, (E) ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and (F) metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) are also possible. In (A–D), black and red colors represent ligand or metal states, respectively. In (E and F), black is Ligand1 (Metal1) and red Ligand2 (Metal2).166 Reproduced with permission.166 Copyright 2020, Wiley Publishing Group. 
Recently, with the development of MOFs, the outstanding advantages (e.g., abundant exposed active sites, unique characteristics of metal node–organic ligand interactions, ultrathin thickness, tunable compositions, and adjustable functionalities) of 2D MOFs endow them with high application prospects for photocatalysis.66 Specifically, the tunable chemical compositions and functionalities render 2D MOF photocatalysts with modified electronic structures for better visible-light adsorption and electron emission. In addition, the abundant exposed active sites and high surface area can promote quick surface redox reactions in photocatalysis. Additionally, the construction of a heterojunction between nanosized photocatalysts and 2D MOFs could accelerate the separation of photoinduced charge carriers (electrons and holes) and improve the stability of supported nanosized photocatalysts without significant aggregation. Even though the applications of 2D MOFs in photocatalysis are still in their infancy, summaries of research progress for 2D MOF photocatalysts will provide some guidance for researchers in the design and synthesis of 2D MOF photocatalysts.
4.1 2D MOF-based materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production
Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water has aroused intense interest to solve environmental and energy problems due to the abundant and clean water resources on Earth, and the environmental friendliness and high energy density of hydrogen, with H2O as the only combustion product, to establish the sustainable development of civilization. Therefore, it is very important to develop and research new, efficient, high-performance, and inexpensive photocatalytic catalysts for hydrogen production.
2D MOFs and 2D MOF-supported photocatalysts have been investigated for hydrogen production in the last several years.46,51,62,167–170 For photocatalytic hydrogenation production, co-catalysts are usually introduced to inhibit electron/hole recombination and provide sufficient active sites to catalyze surface reactions by reducing the activation energy. The noble metal Pt is the most common co-catalyst loaded onto the photocatalysts to achieve high performance. Previously, Jiang et al. demonstrated that PCN-777 MOF supporting 2.3 wt% Pt nanoparticles was effective for photocatalytic hydrogenation production coupled with benzylamine oxidation with high selectivity.171 In order to reduce the usage of Pt, but increase the photocatalytic activity, single Pt atoms were confined into a highly stable aluminum-based porphyrinic MOF with a total Pt loading of 0.07 wt%, and the obtained Al-TCPP-0.1Pt exhibited a superb photocatalytic H2 production activity of about 30 times that of Pt nanoparticles stabilized by the same MOF.172 Later, ultrathin 2D Cu-MOF nanosheets coordinated with preformed single Pt atom-incorporated porphyrin-based carboxylate ligands with a 12.0 wt% Pt loading (denoted as PtSA-MNSs; Fig. 8a–c) exhibited a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 11320 mmol g−1 h−1 and high stability under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), as shown in Fig. 8d and e.46 As shown in Fig. 8h, the Gibbs free energy (DGH*) of MNSs calculated based on structural models of H* (atom) adsorption on the surfaces of MNSs and PtSA-MNSs (Fig. 8f and g) is −0.47 eV, indicating an unfavorable strong adsorption of H* (atom) on these surfaces to limit H2 release. In contrast, the DGH* of PtSA-MNSs dramatically decreases to +0.02 eV, which would favor proton/electron transfer and molecular hydrogen release. Coordinated single Pt atoms in PtSA-MNSs could facilitate H binding and electron transfer, showing outstanding photocatalytic activity towards H2 production. In another work, single-atom Pt sites were anchored at the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ligand of MOF-808, showing a photocatalytic H2 production activity of 68.33 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light (>420 nm).173 Besides reducing the Pt size, the composition and structure of 2D MOFs also have a great influence on photocatalytic H2 production. Zhang et al. reported a 2D Cd-TBAPy single crystal with a visible-light absorption edge of ≈600 nm by using 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) as the organic ligand.167 The π-conjugated 2D layered structure, band edge positions and cocatalysts integrally contributed to the extraordinary photocatalytic H2 production performance.

Besides noble metals as co-catalysts, polypyridinium or a ruthenium complex are typical photosensitizers that have been widely used in photocatalysis due to their convenient HOMO/LUMO levels and long-lived excited states.174 Huo et al. synthesized ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF nanosheets containing bis(4′-carboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) ruthenium complex, [RuII(tpyCOOH)2]2+, as a linker, and the obtained 2D Ni-MOF nanosheets exhibited a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 923 ± 40 μmol g−1 h−1 at pH = 4.0 under visible light without any cocatalyst or co-sensitizer.170 The authors attributed the excellent activity to the reductive quenching pathway involving electron transfer from the reduced Ru photosensitizer linkers to the catalytic Ni nodes. The high cost and extreme scarcity of precious metals (e.g., Pt) and pyridinium or the ruthenium complex significantly impede their industrial-scale applications in photocatalytic H2 production. Therefore, great efforts have been made in the development of noble-metal-free photocatalysts with satisfactory performance and stability.
Another efficient strategy to improve the photocatalytic activity is the construction of heterojunctions with accelerated separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. It has been reported that the coupling of ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF (UNiMOF) with 2D g-C3N4 to form a 2D/2D heterostructured photocatalyst showed higher photocatalytic H2 production than that of pure g-C3N4 and bulk NiMOF/g-C3N4.51 CdS or Zn0.8Cd0.2S nanoparticles supported on 2D MOF nanosheets were also reported to achieve tremendously improved visible-light-induced hydrogen-producing activity due to the strong electron interaction between Zn0.8Cd0.2S and 2D MOFs, the high interfacial charge transfer and abundant reaction sites on 2D MOFs.168,169
Even though the photocatalytic hydrogen production is of great importance for a sustainable future, sacrificial agents (e.g., triethanolamine, methanol) and noble metal co-catalysts are usually needed to achieve a high hydrogen production rate, which seriously restricts industrial-scale applications. Photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 in the absence of sacrificial agents has great potential, but its efficiency is too low for application in industrial production. There is still a long way to go in the research and development of efficient photocatalysts, in which 2D MOF-based photocatalysts are still underdeveloped.
4.2 2D MOF-based materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction
The problems of global warming and the energy crisis have seriously affected the sustainable development of the planet. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into fuels or value-added chemicals using renewable solar energy provides an ideal method to address the crisis of energy from fossil fuels and reduce excessive CO2 emission. Because CO2 photoreduction is extremely difficult, it is very important to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Recently, MOF-based catalysts have been extensively exploited for the photoreduction of CO2 owing to their excellent CO2 capture capacities, unique electronic band structures, and tailorable light-absorption abilities.161,162
It is found that metal complexes (e.g., [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O (bpy = 2′,2-bipyridine)) are usually used as photosensitizers in photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems to increase the visible-light absorption and activity over MOF-based photocatalysts.55,175–177 Peng et al. used conductive 2D MOF Ni3(HITP)2 nanosheets as the co-catalyst, [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) as the photosensitizer, and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the electron donor for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light, reaching a CO yield rate of 3.45 × 104 μmol g−1 h−1 with 97% selectivity.176 As shown in Fig. 9a, excitation and electron exchange of the photosensitizer first occurred under visible light illumination, and then the photogenerated electrons were transferred from the photosensitizer to Ni3(HITP)2 and dispersed within the conjugated MOF nanosheets, and finally CO2 was reduced to CO at the Ni–N4 sites by electrons. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the 2D MOF Ni3(HITP)2 nanosheets can be further improved via introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets in an optimal MOF/rGO ratio, exhibiting a high CO evolution rate of 3.8 × 104 μmol h−1 gfilm−1 (0.46 min−1 in TOF) and a good selectivity of 91.74%.55 The introduction of rGO could improve photoelectron harvesting, favor charge transportation/transfer within the conductive and closely connected 2D heterostructure, and enrich the electron density at isolated Ni-N4 sites for better activity (Fig. 9b and c). The [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2′,2-bipyridine) derived decarboxylate ligands can also be incorporated into the structure of a MOF to prepare photosensitizing metal–organic layers of Hf12–Ru, which can be further modified with M(bpy)(CO)3X (M = Re and X = Cl or M = Mn and X = Br).178 The resultant Hf12–Ru–Re and Hf12–Ru–Mn MOLs are active with a turnover number of 8613 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under artificial visible light due to facilitated electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]+ to MI(bpy)(CO)3X (M = Re, Mn) catalytic centers.178

To reduce the usage of noble metal species, such as [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O, the ideal solution is to establish a photocatalytic system containing efficient non-precious metals catalysts and photosensitizers with high light absorption capacity and light stability. Porphyrin-based MOFs are used for CO2 photocatalytic reduction due to their high light absorption capacity, however many porphyrin-based MOFs have low catalytic efficiency due to rapid photoelectron–hole charge recombination. 2D MOF nanosheets have a higher photocatalytic efficiency due to the increase in surface area, enhancement in the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, and the synergizing effect of CO2 adsorption. However, without a noble metal co-catalyst, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency of porphyrin MOFs would be very low. Ye et al. prepared an ultrathin 2D Zn porphyrin-based MOF using the surfactant assisted method as a photosensitizer for CO2 photocatalytic reduction, and the hybrid catalyst system using ZIF-67 as a cocatalyst exhibited high efficiency, CO selectivity, and stability under visible light (>420 nm).179 A DFT computational study can also provide some deeper insights into the photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism. In the computational study reported by Wang et al., a 2D cobalt–porphyrin-based MOF linked to CoO-clusters can act as an efficient photocatalyst for direct CO2 reduction to CH4 without introducing any cocatalysts due to the highly accessible active sites and the collaborative contribution from CoO-clusters and cobalt–porphyrin.180 Up to now, there have been no experimental data to support the calculated prediction, even though single Co(II) sites derived from 2D Co-MOFs supported on g-C3N4 semiconductors have been reported to be active for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO.181
4.3 2D MOF-based materials for photocatalytic organic synthesis
MOF materials with a large surface area and tunable surface properties are good platforms for photocatalytic organic syntheses under mild conditions, and much attention and research have been focused on this field.182–185 In the last several years, 2D MOF nanosheets have also been attracting increasing attention for photocatalytic organic synthesis due to the abundant exposed active sites, the reduced diffusion pathway of photogenerated charge-carriers to reactants, and the increased chance for contact between substrates and active surfaces.34,41,66,186–188
Lin et al. modified the secondary building units of 2D metal–organic layers (MOLs) with gluconic acid to create hydrophobic/hydrophilic microenvironments around the active sites, and the modified 2D Fe-MOLs exhibited 100% selectivity of butyrolactone in the photocatalytic oxidation of tetrahydrofuran (Fig. 10a).186 It is proposed that the reaction intermediates can stay in the hydrophilic microenvironment of catalytic centers with a prolonged residence time. In another work, Lin et al. used the 2D Zr-RuBPY MOLs based on Zr-oxo clusters and [Ru(bpy)3]2+-containing linkers with a unique ultrathin monolayer structure of 1–2 nm thickness, which could overcome pore size and diffusion limitations in 3D MOF photocatalysis.187 When used in the photocatalytic [2 + 2] cyclization of enones and Meerwein addition reactions between aryl diazonium salts, styrene, and nitrile, the Zr-RuBPY MOLs showed efficient activity, whereas almost no activity was observed in the corresponding 3D MOF catalysts due to the pore size limitation or restricted diffusion of reactive intermediates. Recently, Lin's group further used a multifunctional MOL, Hf12-Ir-OTf, comprising triflate (OTf)-capped Hf12 secondary building units and Ir(DBB)[dF(CF3)ppy]2+ [DBB-Ir–F, DBB = 4,4′-di(4-benzoato)-2,2′-bipyridine; dF(CF3)ppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine] bridging ligands, for synergistic Lewis acid and photoredox catalysis.188 The close proximity (1.2 nm) between the Lewis acid and photoredox catalyst not only favors the reaction between the carbon radical and the activated heteroarene, but also accelerates electron transfer from the nitrogen radical intermediate to the Ir(IV) species, resulting in excellent catalytic performance.188

As summarized in the synthesis section, organic ligands containing the porphyrin structure are usually used for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets. Recently, 2D metal–porphyrin MOF nanosheets have also been reported in photocatalytic organic syntheses due to the high light harvesting efficiency and 1O2 generation. For example, Wang et al. reported the synthesis of ultrathin 2D Zr–porphyrinic MOF nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm through a pseudoassembly–disassembly strategy, and the obtained 2D Zr–porphyrinic MOF nanosheets exhibited superior activity to that of bulk MOFs in the photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, owing to rapid mass transport and highly exposed catalytic active sites on the ultrathin nanosheets.66 Wang et al. produced photosensitizer-anchored 2D MOF nanosheets (namely PCN-134(Ni)-2D) via surface modification of Zr-BTB (BTB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene) through the attachment of Ni-incorporated porphyrin-based carboxylate ligands on the coordinatively unsaturated Zr metal sites (Fig. 10b and c).41 PCN-134(Ni)-2D acted as a highly stable and accessible photocatalyst for 1O2 generation and artemisinin production with 64% yield, surpassing all reported photocatalysts for artemisinin production due to the more accessible catalytic sites and facile substrate diffusion. Besides Zr-based 2D MOFs, a series of porphyrin-based 2D lanthanide MOFs (Ln-TCPP, Ln = Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) with different thicknesses were recently synthesized via a surfactant-free bottom-up synthetic strategy, which exhibited thickness- and metal-node dependent performances towards photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,5-DHN) to juglone (Fig. 10d).34 Particularly, Yb-TCPP exhibited a better photodynamic activity to generate O2− and 1O2 than other 2D lanthanide MOFs because of the facilitated intersystem crossing from 1TCPP to 3TCPP through spin–orbit coupling resulting from effective energy (Dexter energy) transfer between TCPP and Yb3+ (Fig. 10e and f). In addition, thermally activated back energy transfer (BEnT) from 2F5/2 of Yb3+ to 3TCPP with a prolonged 3TCPP lifetime may occur because of the small energy gap. The efficient intersystem crossing and prolonged lifetime of 3TCPP facilitate the generation of 1O2 through a type II mechanism (Fig. 10e and f). Photogenerated electrons at the 1TCPP level can be effectively captured by Yb3+, and the formation of O2− through a type I mechanism will be promoted in Yb-TCPP due to the lower 2F5/2 energy level of Yb3+ than those of Ce3+ (5d), Sm3+ (4G5/2), Eu3+ (5D0), and Tb3+ (5D4).
4.4 2D MOF-based materials for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants
In the last decade, MOFs or MOF-based hybrid photocatalysts have been actively applied as photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants into harmless ingredients under mild conditions using solar light due to the high surface area and tunable band structure of MOF semiconductors.165 2D MOF nanosheets with higher surface areas, more exposed active sites and more chance to come into contact with organic pollutant molecules have attracted increasing attention in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.40,189–191
For pure 2D MOF photocatalysts, 2D Cd/Co-based MOFs, [Cd(bpy)(H2O)L]n (BUC-66) and {[Co(bpy)(H2O)L]·H2O}2n (BUC-67) (H2L = cis-1,3-dibenzyl-2-imidazolidone-4,5-dicarboxylic acid, bpy = 4,40-bipyridine), have been applied for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under UV light irradiation.189 In another work, a 2D Zn-MOF, [Zn(L)(H2O)]·H2O (H2L = 4-(pyridine-4-yl) phthalic acid), exhibited a degradation efficiency of 98.5% for rhodamine B and 83.8% for methyl orange within 120 min in the absence of H2O2 and any photosensitizer or cocatalyst using a 300 W Xe lamp (including UV light and visible light) as the light source.190 The main active component is determined to be ˙O2− generated under visible light, which is an effective oxidant for the degradation of dyes. Constructing hybrid photocatalysts is an effective strategy to improve the light absorption and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Bhuvaneswari et al. reported a MOF-5 supported ZnMgAl layered hydroxide 2D/2D hybrid photocatalyst for the degradation of methylene blue with 98.1% efficiency under UV-visible light irradiation; this is twice that of pristine MOF-5.191
Besides organic dyes in water, gas-phase volatile organic compounds can also be degraded via photocatalysis, even though it is still challenging. Ni-MOF nanosheet arrays in situ grown on porous nickel foam have been successfully applied and exhibited a mineralization efficiency of 86.6% at 98.1% of ethyl acetate removal under visible light irradiation due to highly exposed active sites, fast diffusion of VOCs and reaction intermediates, and rapid e− transport in the conducting nickel foam.56
4.5 Brief summary
In this section, research progress of 2D MOF-based materials in photocatalysis in recent years was reviewed. 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-based photocatalysts are attracting increasing attention due to their unique structures and properties. Up to now, a small number of studies have looked at 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-based photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogenation production, CO2 reduction, organic synthesis, degradation of organic dyes, and N2 photoreduction.192 These results show that, compared with 3D MOF crystals, 2D MOF-based material photocatalysts show some superior activity and selectivity. However, 2D MOF-based materials are still in their infancy in the field of photocatalysis, and limited types of 2D MOF photocatalysts have been reported. In the future, there will be more space for the rational design of 2D MOF-based photocatalyst to obtain better photocatalytic performance.
5. 2D MOF-based materials for thermocatalytic applications
Generally, pure MOFs and MOF-based materials with tunable metal nodes and organic ligands are promising catalysts for various kinds of organic reactions, such as selective oxidation of hydrocarbons,193 cycloaddition of CO2, hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, epoxidation of olefins, and one-pot cascade reactions.194–196 In addition, organic ligands containing pyridyl, amide, amino or sulfoxy groups can be used in the synthesis of functionalized MOFs. The groups can be further modified by post-synthetic strategies to tune the acid–base properties, which can be used as acid or base catalysts for transesterification reactions, Knoevenagel condensation, and the esterification of carboxylic acids and alcohols.197–199 However, the pores in the 3D MOF crystals significantly limit the diffusion of substrate molecules and hinder their contact with the inner active sites, resulting in poor catalytic activity. Compared with some traditional 3D MOF crystals, 2D MOF nanosheets with a larger surface area, greater accessibility to exposed active sites, and open metal surfaces are promising heterogeneous catalyst candidates to improve the performance. This section summarizes and discusses the catalytic applications of 2D MOFs or 2D MOF-based heterogenous catalysts for organic syntheses that have been reported in recent years.
5.1 2D MOF-based materials for selective oxidation
Since the first reports on MOFs, MOFs as catalysts or catalyst supports have been widely investigated for selective organic synthesis, such as Fe2O3@P4VP@ZIF-8,200 sulfonated-polystyrene-Cu(II)@Cu3(BTC)2,201 and Au@UiO-66(NH2)202 for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol. With the help of radicals formed from N-hydroxyphthalimide, benzylic C–H bonds can be oxidized over Cu-CuFe2O4@HKUST-1 using O2 as the oxidant.203
Recently, researchers tried to exploit the catalytic performance of 2D MOFs in selective oxidation reactions.186,204 In an early report, Huang et al. synthesized 2D metalloporphyrinic MOF nanosheets with peroxidase-like activity for the growth of ultrasmall Au nanoparticles (NPs) with glucose oxidase-like activity, which were further investigated as biomimetic catalysts for cascade reactions, including the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and glucose.205 2D MOFs themselves, with active catalytic sites, have also been reported for selective oxidation. For example, Xiao et al. reported that 2D Cu-TCPP nanosheets could exhibit a higher (94%) conversion of styrene compared to their corresponding bulk crystals and HKUST-1; this can be attributed to their high density of exposed active sites and low diffusion barriers, with more chance for contact between the substrate molecules and those active sites.47 Later, Zhang et al. reported a CO2-directed route to control the oriented growth of a MOF at a mild temperature (35 °C), and the obtained 2D Cu(BDC) nanosheets with ultrathin thickness (∼10 nm) and abundant unsaturated coordination metal sites on the surfaces were demonstrated to exhibit almost 100% conversion of the selective aerobic oxidation of several aromatic alcohols (e.g., benzyl alcohol, 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol) within 3 h; this activity was much better than those over bulk Cu(BDC).206 However, the usage of 2,2,6,6-teramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) as a co-catalyst and Na2CO3 as a base in the catalytic reaction system is not environmentally friendly enough. In another work, Bagheri et al. sonochemically synthesized 2D AM-Co1 MOFs and 3D AM-Co2 MOFs from N,N‘(1,4-phenylene) diisonicotinamide (bpfb) and N,N′-bis(4-pyridiny)-terephthalamide (bpta) ligands.35 It is found that the 2D AM-Co1 exhibited a higher catalytic activity than 3D AM-Co2 in oxidative amidation reactions with excellent yields (75–90%) for a wide variety of aldehydes and amines using H2O as a solvent and air as an oxidant; this is related to the fully exfoliated single layers of 2D MOFs with a high surface area and abundant open metal sides. The activity was reduced with the cycling times, such as from 85% for the first test to 40% for the fourth test with AM-Co1 in the oxidative amidation of benzaldehydes, which may be related to the poor stability of 2D AM-Co1 MOFs in H2O at 80 °C under ultrasonic bath conditions.
Up to now, even though various kinds of 3D MOF catalysts have been reported for selective oxidation reactions, reports on 2D MOF nanosheets in this field are still rare, maybe due to the poor stability of 2D MOFs under the harsh reaction conditions, such as high temperature, strong oxidants, and high pressure. In order to obtain a high performance of 2D MOFs in thermocatalytic selective oxidation under relatively harsh conditions, the stability of 2D MOFs should be improved.
5.2 2D MOF-based materials for hydrogenation reactions
Selective reduction or hydrogenation are other important kinds of reaction in organic synthesis, which have been investigated for many years. With the developments of MOFs, 3D MOFs prepared using a salicylaldimine (sal)-derived dicarboxylate bridging ligand can be further functionalized with Co and Fe ions via post-synthetic metalation, which were demonstrated to be highly active solid catalysts for alkene hydrogenation with high turnover numbers.207 Another traditional strategy is to incorporate metal nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which usually exhibit excellent hydrogenation activity, but facile aggregation, into the pores or covered by porous supports with superior catalytic selectivity and stability. 3D MOFs with tunable pore size and high surface areas have been extensively reported as supports for metal nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which exhibited a synergetic enhancement in the hydrogenation activity,194,195,208 whereas the micrometer or sub-micrometer size of 3D MOF crystals with a long molecular diffusion distance of chemical species limited the diffusion of substrate molecules in the pores.
It is expected that 2D MOF nanosheets with extended lateral dimensions, abundant accessible active sites, minimal diffusion constraints, and nanoscale thickness, as emerging supports for dispersing and stabilizing metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au nanoparticles209), will achieve rapid kinetics and effectively reduce mass transfer barriers. Recently, 2D MOF nanosheets supporting noble metal nanoparticles have been synthesized, with the aim of coupling the unique properties of metal nanoparticles and 2D MOF nanosheets for efficient catalysis. Zhan and Zeng developed a facile and shape-controlled method for the preparation of nanosheets of Cu(HBTC)-1 using Cu2O nanoparticles as a copper source and PVP as a directing agent under mild conditions.210 Importantly, the as-prepared 2D Cu(HBTC)-1 nanosheets supported ultrafine noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Au0.4Pt0.6, Au0.4Pd0.6, and Au0.3Pt0.3Pd0.4), especially Au–Pt–Pd alloy nanoparticles, showed excellent activity toward 4-nitrophenol reduction in the liquid phase due to strong synergistic effects between the different metals.210 In another work, Yan et al. successfully fabricated 2D Ni-MOF nanosheets with the advantages of well-defined micropores and functional oxygen decoration of mixed ligands on the inner wall, which were applied as supports for the incorporation of relatively monodisperse ultra-small Au nanoparticles of about 1 nm.37 By using the properties of homogeneously distributed ultrafine Au nanoparticles and microporous 2D nanosheets, the nanocomposite exhibited a prominent catalytic performance, good size selectivity and excellent recyclability toward the reduction reaction of p-nitrophenol.37 However, in this work, it is not clear whether the Ni2+ ion nodes in the Ni-MOF were also reduced to form AuNi alloy or not, and a deeper investigation (e.g., XPS) should be carried out.
Owing to the high cost and scarce resources of noble metals, tremendous efforts have been made to reduce or avoid the usage of noble metals for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol. For example, a 2D ultrathin Ni-MOF combined with layered g-C3N4 or graphene oxide was firstly applied as a composite catalyst for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol, which exhibited higher activity and recyclability than commercial Pd/C or Pt/C catalysts, and the authors declared that the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the 2D ultrathin Ni-MOF acted as the dominating active sites,57 whereas there are obvious changes in the XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after catalytic tests, and further characterization should be provided to demonstrate the structural and chemical stability of the Ni-MOF in the composite after the catalytic reaction. Strikingly, in the work reported by Guo and co-authors, the Ni2+ ion nodes in the structure of Ni-MOF nanosheets (NMOF-Ni) can be partially in situ reduced to ultrasmall and homogeneous Ni nanoparticles by NaBH4 under ambient conditions (Fig. 11a–f), and as-synthesized Ni/NMOF-Ni-0.4 exhibited high efficiency and selectivity, as well as good recyclability for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (Fig. 11g–j).38 This work provides a facile and effective in situ reduction strategy to fabricate metal nanoparticle/MOF composites without impregnation of additional metal precursors. Besides the in situ reduction method with NaBH4, heterogenous nickel catalysts can also be synthesized by pyrolysis of the 2D Ni-MOFs in N2 flow at high temperatures. For example, Ni-MFC-500 obtained after pyrolysis at 500 °C was demonstrated to be an effective catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of furfural, with 92.5% conversion of furfural and 59.5% selectivity of furfuryl alcohol, even though the reaction was carried out under 2 MPa H2 at 160 °C for 4 h.211

Besides the relatively easy reduction of 4-nitrophenol, 2D MOFs or 2D MOF-supported catalysts have also been applied for other types of hydrogenation reactions, such as ultrathin Ni-MOF nanosheets for ethylene dimerization in the presence of an alkylaluminum cocatalyst,212 hydrogeneration of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone over Ru/2D Zr-MOF nanosheet hybrid nanomaterials,65 and hydrogenation of styrene over Pd/Zr-Fc MOF nanosheets.213 In a study of the hydrogeneration of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone, Ru nanoparticles with a size of sub-2 nm uniformly distributed on the 2D Zr-MOF nanosheets were much more active than Ru nanoparticles loaded on 3D bulk MOFs and commercial Ru/C catalysts due to the well-dispersed Ru active sites and abundant surfaces without geometric constraints.65 In the work reported by Deng and co-authors, ferrocene-based Zr-MOF nanosheets were used to load Pd nanoparticles via the in situ reduction of Pd2+ by the1,1′-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid ligand in the Zr-based MOF nanosheets.213
There are still only a few reports in the literature about the applications of 2D MOF-based materials for the hydrogenation reaction, which are mainly focused on Ni-based MOF nanosheets or MOF nanosheets supporting noble metal nanoparticles. The main issues exist in the usage of noble metals and the relatively poor stability of MOFs under harsh reductive conditions, which need to be taken care of in future research.
5.3 2D MOF-based materials for CO2-cycloaddition of epoxides
It is well known that the combustion of fossil fuels with excessive CO2 emission results in serious energy and environmental issues (global warming, energy shortage), and CO2 capture and conversion have attracted extensive attention from all over the world. Besides the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the aforementioned section, the addition of CO2 as a C1 building block to value-added chemicals is another widely adopted strategy, among them the CO2 cycloaddition reaction with epoxides to give organic cyclic carbonates is one of the most efficient methods. Porous 3D MOF crystals have attracted remarkable attention for applications in the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates.214,215 In recent years, 2D MOF nanosheets with superior properties have been investigated as catalysts for the CO2 cycloaddition reaction.
Li et al. reported, for the first time, that 2D In(III)-MOFs containing unsaturated hepta-coordinate indium centers were active catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO2 with a series of terminal epoxides to produce the corresponding cyclic organic carbonates with high conversion and selectivity under mild conditions on the addition of tetra-n-tert-butylammonium bromide (n-Bu4NBr).216 The addition of n-Bu4NBr would promote the opening of the epoxide ring by the Br− ion from n-Bu4NBr and react with CO2 molecules to form alkyl carbonate anions.217 In another work, Liu and co-authors prepared PCN-222(Co) MOF nanorods coated with 2D MOLs (i.e., PCN-222(Co)@MTTB) using TTB (4,4′,4′′-s-triazine-2,4,6-triyl-tribenzoate) as an organic linker, and the formed PCN-222(Co)@MTTB exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the fixation of CO2 to cyclic carbonates due to exposed acidic sites (Co2+, Zr4+) and basic sites (–N– groups) within the matrix.218 The epoxides can also be converted into other chemicals via methanolysis. For example, Afshariazar and Morsali applied a 2D-MOF, [Zn(L1)(oba)], as an effective H-bond donor catalyst for the methanolysis of epoxides, in which the H-bond donor based carbohydrazide moiety with strong Lewis acidic sites in the 2D MOFs performed better for the activation of epoxides when compared to 3D H-bonded organocatalyst MOFs.219 The acidic strength of the H-bond donors within the 2D-MOFs can be further improved by introducing electron withdrawing groups, resulting in high conversion.219
Even though numerous MOF-based catalysts have been implemented in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to give cyclic carbonates in the past years, there are still enormous challenges in the construction of MOF-based catalysts with effective catalytic performance under ambient pressure with low CO2 concentration and at low temperature. 2D MOFs with more exposed active sites and shorter diffusion lengths have been demonstrated to be promising catalysts for the CO2-cycloaddition of epoxides, whereas there is still much in-depth research required to understand the reaction mechanism and produce 2D MOF nanosheets with high catalytic performance.
5.4 2D MOF-based materials for Knoevenagel condensation reactions
By taking advantage of their permanent porosity, tunable metal ion nodes, and flexible organic ligands with functional or functionalized groups, MOFs provide a powerful platform to act as acid or base catalysts for condensation reactions.197 The Knoevenagel condensation reaction, as one of the most versatile organic C–C bond transformations in synthetic chemistry, typically proceeds with soluble base catalysts. The amino groups on the organic ligand of amino-tagged MOFs can be modified by a post-synthetic strategy to increase the alkalinity for the Knoevenagel condensation reactions. In the last three years, 2D MOF nanosheets with nanoscale thickness, a large number of accessible active sites and minimal diffusion constraints have attracted attention in the field of Knoevenagel condensation reactions.39,204,217,220–224
With the assistance of 2-methylimidazole (2-MI), typical bulk MOF-5 crystals can form a 2D nanosheet morphology with a thickness of 4 nm, which exhibits a better catalytic performance than bulk MOF-5 in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of an aldehyde and malononitrile due to more exposed catalytically active sites, Lewis acidic sites (Zn2+) and basic sites (–NH in 2-MI) in MOF-5 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 12.220 In another work, a 2D cationic MOF, [Zn2(TCA)(BIB)2.5]·(NO3) (H3TCA = tricarboxytriphenyl amine, BIB = 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene), was reported to exhibit high activity and substrate selectivity in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde derivatives with malononitrile under solvent-free environments, due to the existence of both Lewis acid Zn(II) and Lewis base triphenylamine within TCA3−.217

2D Cu-MOFs have also been reported as effective heterogenous catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.204,223 For example, a 2D Cu(II) MOF, [(Cu(L)2·(H2O)2·(NO3)2]n, synthesized by the self-assembly of 4-(5-methyl-3-pyridine)-1,2,4-triazole (namely L) with many Lewis basic N atoms and Lewis acid Cu(II) ions exhibited high yields (74–99%) in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde derivatives with malononitrile.222 Bifunctional 2D Cd(II)-based MOFs (e.g., [Cd(PBA)(DMF)]·DMF (Cd-PBA) synthesized by the reaction of 5-(4-pyridin-3-ylbenzoylamino)isophthalic acid ligand (H2PBA) and Cd(II) ions,224 [Cd(DDIH)2H2O]n (CP–Cd) synthesized by the reaction of 1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-dione bisisonicotinylhydrazone (H2DDIH) and Cd(II) ions225) containing both Cd(II) metal sites and Lewis basic sites from –NH groups of amides were also demonstrated to be active for the Knoevenagel condensation reactions of various benzaldehydes containing different substituents with malononitrile. As reported in the aforementioned reports, the Lewis basic sites in 2D MOFs for the Knoevenagel condensation reactions can be introduced by choosing organic ligands containing –NH groups. In addition, Lewis basic sites can also be introduced by the formation of CN bonds between the –NH2 group in the 2-aminoterephthalic acid (H2BDC-NH2) ligands and PVP molecules, and carboxylic acid groups in modified H2BDC-NH2 coordinate with Ni2+ ions and form ultrathin Ni-MOF nanosheets, which display much improved activity and good stability in the Knoevenagel condensation reactions.39
5.5 Brief summary
Besides the applications of 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-supported catalysts in several typical thermocatalytic applications (e.g., selective oxidation, hydrogenation, CO2-cycloaddition of epoxides, Knoevenagel condensation), 2D MOF-based or derived catalysts have also been reported in the efficient catalysis of Suzuki coupling and Heck arylation reactions under a variety of conditions,226 and O-silylation of alcohols with silanes.227 Compared with bulk 3D MOF crystals, 2D MOF nanosheets have several obvious advantages, such as nanoscale thickness, abundant exposed active sites, and minimal diffusion constraints, which mean that 2D MOF nanosheets have great potential in thermocatalytic applications with more efficient catalytic performance. The stability of 2D MOF nanosheets under relatively harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature, or the presence of oxidative or reductive gases) should be considered carefully for practical applications. For the CO2-cycloaddition of epoxides and Knoevenagel condensation reactions, Lewis acidic sites and basic sites can both be introduced into the crystal structure of 2D MOFs as bifunctional catalysts.
6. Current and future challenges
Despite various methods being reported for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets, the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with high yields and low costs is still a great challenge. For top-down methods, one main challenge is that the exfoliation yield and efficiency of 2D MOF nanosheets are usually too low for practical applications. Therefore, it is desirable that the yield of exfoliated nanosheets can be increased by other developed approaches. In addition, due to the high tendency of aggregation/restacking of the exfoliated nanosheets, the stabilization of 2D MOF nanosheets is another challenge, especially in highly polar solvents. Furthermore, the role of the solvent in the exfoliation process is still not clear enough. In current and future work, research on suitable solvents for exfoliating bulk MOFs and stabilizing the obtained 2D MOF nanosheets, and the interactions between solvents and MOF nanosheets, is also challenging. For bottom-up methods, it is a great challenge to selectively control the growth of MOF crystals along only two directions to form nanosheets. Even though several nano-layered 2D MOF nanosheets were successfully prepared by bottom-up methods under special conditions (e.g., surfactant, solvent, sonification), the types of 2D MOF nanosheets are still limited to several types and the formation mechanism is still not clear enough. Therefore, it is desirable to exploit facile methods for the rational design and synthesis of MOF nanosheets with purposeful structures, good crystallinity, large lateral sizes and high yields. The combined top-down and bottom-up approaches integrate the advantages of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, and several 2D MOFs with underlying structures were successfully prepared. No matter which strategies were adopted, the interactions between the interlayers of 3D MOF crystals or as-prepared 2D MOF nanosheets should be weakened by the addition of surfactants, solvents, or external forces.
In the last decade, MOF-derived materials with large porosity and high surface areas have been extensively investigated for various kinds of applications. 2D MOFs can also be used as precursors for the synthesis of derived 2D nanomaterials for catalytic applications. However, time-consuming processes, low yields and high costs for obtaining 2D MOF nanosheets strictly limit the wide applications of 2D MOF nanosheets as precursors for synthesizing 2D carbon or other metal-containing nanosheets. To maintain the 2D nanosheet morphology derived from 2D MOF nanosheets during the high temperature annealing process is also challenging.
For the applications of 2D MOF-based materials in electrocatalytic, photocatalytic and thermocatalytic fields, 2D MOFs or 2D MOF-based catalysts are still in their infancy, so more efforts are needed to elucidate details of the working mechanisms and further develop more efficient 2D MOF-based catalysts with low overpotentials, high conductivity or high conversion and selectivity. In addition, the long-term stability of 2D MOF nanosheets under harsh reaction conditions (e.g., strongly acidic or basic conditions for electrocatalysts, highly polar solvents) is still challenging. For the future, the prediction of 2D MOF nanosheets with special metal nodes and organic ligands for catalytic applications using theoretical calculations is still challenging, which needs close collaboration and advancements from materials science, computational chemistry, electrochemistry and engineering.
7. Advances in science and technology to meet these challenges
Even though there are still many challenges in the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets and their applications in catalytic fields, some advances in science and technology can be used to meet the challenges. For the exfoliation of bulk MOFs to nanosheets using top-down methods, some combined exfoliation approaches (e.g., freeze–thaw exfoliation and chemical exfoliation, intercalation and chemical exfoliation) were also developed to increase the exfoliation yields. In addition, using solvents with suitable surface energies or adding some stabilizers may further increase the stability of the exfoliated 2D MOF nanosheets. By using bottom-up methods, 2D MOF nanosheets with single or a few layers can be prepared via liquid/air interfacial synthesis. With the strong protecting ability of suitable surfactants, the surfactant-assisted synthesis methods are effective to synthesize MOF nanosheets, even for those non-layer structured MOF nanosheets under ambient conditions or at high temperatures. The combination of both bottom-up and top-down methods also provides some opportunities in the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets. The crucial factor for improving the stability of 2D MOFs is to increase the interactions between metal nodes and organic ligands, such as strong electrostatic interactions between highly acidic metal ions and highly alkaline ligands, and strong metal–nitrogen bonds via functionalizing the organic ligands with exogenous nitrogen-containing molecules.
Recently, the development of theoretical calculation technology (e.g., high-throughput calculation) and a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism for 2D MOF nanosheets have provided some guidance for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets.54 The possibility of 2D MOF nanosheets with special metal nodes and organic ligands and their stability in solvents can be firstly evaluated by theory, which may reduce the failure of the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets. To better understand the formation and working mechanisms, many state-of-art and in situ characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) experiments, spectroscopic characterization studies, and advanced theoretical calculations, can also be used in the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets and their applications as electrocatalysts, photocatalysts and heterogenous catalysts.
For the catalytic applications of 2D MOF-based materials, remarkable developments in electrocatalysts, photocatalysts and heterogenous catalysts can be applied. For example, the development of in situ characterization techniques and the introduction of operando studies, such as X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) experiments and transmission electron microscope spectroscopic characterization studies, have provided direct evidence for the observation of catalytic processes and intermediates, which is of great importance in understanding the reaction mechanisms and evolution of catalysts during the catalytic process.
8. Conclusions and outlooks
In summary, although some interesting results in the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets and their applications as electrocatalysts, photocatalysts and thermocatalysts have been reported, there is still a long way to go for the further development and practical applications of 2D MOF nanosheets. For synthesis, even though several strategies have been used for the synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets, there are still many challenges to address in the scalable and controllable syntheses of 2D MOF nanosheets with high yields, high rates of production, high quality and good stability. The irregular shapes and difficulties in the determination of structural information make it difficult to accurately reveal the structure–performance relationships. With the development of synthetic strategies, 2D MOF nanosheets with large areas, fewer defects, uniform shapes and controllable structure orientations can be synthesized, which may exhibit unique or much better performance in catalytic fields.
For applications as electrocatalysts, several kinds of 2D MOF nanosheets have been reported to exhibit certain performances. However, most of the MOF nanosheets are semiconductive with insufficient conductivity due to the large amount of grain boundaries and defects in them, which would limit their applications in energy storage and conversion fields. Besides obtaining high-quality semiconductive and conductive 2D MOF nanosheets, the hybridization of 2D MOFs with other 2D conductive nanomaterials is a promising strategy for improving their activity and generating some new properties and functionalities in the energy storage and conversion fields. Since bulk MOFs have been reported as precursors for MOF-derived nanomaterials, even with supported single-atom catalysts, 2D MOF nanosheets can also be used as templates or precursors to synthesize novel 2D-MOF-based nanomaterials or confined metal single-atom catalysts with maximum atom utilization efficiency, which may exhibit some unique properties and performance in electrocatalytic processes.
In photocatalytic applications (e.g., hydrogenation production, CO2 reduction/addition, organic synthesis, and degradation of organic dyes) and the thermocatalytic fields (e.g., selective oxidation, hydrogenation, CO2-cycloaddition of epoxides, Knoevenagel condensation), the performance of 2D MOFs and 2D MOF-based photocatalysts with nanoscale thickness, abundant exposed active sites, and minimal diffusion constraints indeed show superior activity and selectivity as compared with their 3D MOF counterparts. However, 2D MOF-based materials in the field of photocatalysis and thermocatalysis are still in their infancy, and only limited types of 2D MOF-based materials have been reported.
Generally, the stability of 2D MOFs under relatively harsh reaction conditions (e.g., strong acidic and alkaline electrolytes, strongly polar solvents, high temperature, oxidative or reductive gases, strong oxidative species generated under visible light irradiation) should be considered carefully for practical applications in future research work. With developments in the catalytic fields, such as the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental synthesis along with advanced in situ or ex situ spectroscopic characterization studies, X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) experiments, high-resolution microscopy, etc., there will be more space for the rational design of 2D MOF-based catalysts to obtain better catalytic performances.
