    , Accepted 8th June 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractIodine binding to thiophene rings in dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been hypothesized to be performance degrading in a number of literature cases. Binding of iodine to dyes near the semiconductor surface can promote undesirable electron transfers and lower the overall efficiency of devices. Six thiophene or furan containing dye analogs were synthesized to analyze iodine binding to the dyes via Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis studies, device performance metrics and density functional theory (DFT) based computations. Evidence suggests I2 binds thiophene-based dyes stronger than furan-based dyes. This leads to higher DSC device currents and voltages from furan analogues, and longer electron lifetimes in DSC devices using furan based dyes. Raman spectrum of the TiO2 surface-bound dyes reveals additional and more instense peaks for thiophene dyes in the presence of I2 relative to no I2. Additionally, broader and shifted UV-Vis peaks are observed for thiophene dyes in the presence of I2 on TiO2 films suggesting significant interaction between the dye molecules and I2. These observations are also supported by DFT and TD-DFT calculations which indicate the absence of a key geometric energy minimum in the dye–I2 ground state for furan dyes which are readily observed for the thiophene based analogues.
Introduction
The need for an energy source that is both sustainable and renewable is apparent. One viable option that is cost-effective and potentially aesthetically appealing are dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).1,2 DSC devices operate by: (1) photoexcitation of a dye molecule, (2) injection of excited electrons into a semiconductor conduction band (e.g. TiO2 CB), (3) an electron traversing an external circuit to the counter electrode, (4) collection of the electron at the counter electrode by a redox shuttle, and finally (5) transfer of the electron from the redox shuttle to the oxidized dye molecule.3 Organic dye based DSCs have been able to reach power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for this process in excess of 14%, but there is still room for improvement by minimizing non-productive electron transfers such as from TiO2 to the dye (back electron transfer) or from TiO2 to the redox shuttle (recombination).4–6 Undesirable charge recombinations are thought to increase when the iodine (I2) redox shuttle binds with a dye near the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1).7–10 Minimizing recombination events which prevent electrons from completing an external circuit is critical to developing higher efficiency DSC devices.

Isothiocyanates (NCS) bound to transition metals, amine, cyano, halide and thioether groups have been demonstrated to bind iodine and iodide through prior spectroscopic, computational and device studies.9–21 Despite good evidence of sulfur-based NCS groups and aromatic 5-member heterocycle selenophenes8 interacting with iodine, experimental evidence of thiophenes binding I2 is lacking. However, thiophene is commonly implicated in promoting recombination by binding I2 near the semiconductor surface.22,23 Several computational reports suggest thiophene-based dyes binding I2 may be favorable and likely has device performance implications.18,24–27 The possibility of thiophene binding I2 is concerning since thiophenes have become ubiquitous in DSC organic-dye design. To probe the ongoing hypothesis that I2 in DCSs is binding to the sulfur atom present in thiophene stronger than the oxygen atom present in furan rings, we have systematically studied a series of six thiophene or furan based-dye analogs experimentally via Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption, and DSC device performance properties, as well as computationally via geometry analysis, binding strength comparisons, and analysis of vertical transition events. The results put forward in this manuscript offer strong evidence of thiophenes binding I2 which leads to lower DSC device performances.
We hypothesized sulfur would bind I2 stronger than oxygen due to the higher polarizability of sulfur which is more similar to iodine.28 Additionally, the widened C–S–C angle of thiophene relative to the C–O–C angle of furan could play an important role in accessibility of the S atom to I2. To test this, we employed dyes in our studies which replace a thiophene ring with a furan ring to give a single atom change within the larger dye structure. Donor and π-bridge functionality was examined for three sets of dyes which all employ the ubiquitous cyanoacrylic acid acceptor within the donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) framework. Specifically, LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan) have a simple alkyl ether donor group as part of the D–π–A conjugated system (Fig. 2). This limits the heteroatom (non-carbon or hydrogen) binding positions relative to more complex dye systems. Hagfeldt's triarylamine donor was used to compare dyes varying π-bridges from one thiophene (D35), one furan (AB3), two thiophenes (AB1), and one thiophene with one furan (AB2) (Fig. 2). This donor was selected as D35 has been extensively studied and allows for a comparison to an established dye. The target dyes were known (AB1, LD03 and LD04),29,30 commercially available (D35via Dyenamo), or prepared through analogous routes to the thiophene analogues29,31 for the unknown furan dyes (AB2 and AB3, see Scheme S1, ESI† for synthetic route).

Results and discussion
Raman spectroscopy
First, we examined the vibrational spectrum of the dyes with and without I2 present on TiO2 films in acetonitrile (MeCN) via Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy provides a sensitive spectroscopic method for evaluation of dye vibrational modes under conditions similar to those in devices for the neutral ground-state dye at a surface in the presence of MeCN with and without I2. If iodine binding were to occur to the sulfur atom stronger than oxygen, we reasoned a change in the vibrational spectra of the dye molecules would be expected due to new vibrational peaks resulting from new vibrational modes associated with a S–I2 binding or a change in the relative intensity of already existing peaks by perturbation of ring breathing/stretching modes of thiophene through introduction of an S–I2 bond.32,33 To compare thiophene versus furan dyes binding I2, TiO2–dye films were prepared with D35 (thiophene), AB3 (furan), LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan). AB1 (thiophene) and AB2 (furan) were not studied via Raman spectroscopy since they suffer from decomposition on films in the presence of I2 alone. Notably, AB1 and AB2 were stable in operational DSC devices presumably due to the full electrolyte stabilizing the dyes. For the other 4 dyes, Raman spectra were collected on the TiO2–dye films with and without I2 in the common DSC device electrolyte solvent MeCN. D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) both show an increase in the relative intensity of the peaks seen between 1000–1600 cm−1 when compared with the 300–1000 cm−1 region; however, the increase is substantially greater for D35 (thiophene) (Fig. 3a and b). Initial pure dye peaks and new peaks associated with I2 addition can be seen around 950 cm−1, 1025 cm−1, 1060 cm−1, and 1400–1600 cm−1 for AB3 (furan) (Fig. 3b), but D35 (thiophene) shows few original dye peaks after I2 addition with numerous intense signals being added from 1000–1600 cm−1 (Fig. 3a). This points to the presence of iodine binding in both dyes, however the presence of the sulfur atom in D35 (thiophene) has resulted in a larger change in the Raman spectrum relative to AB3 (furan). This larger change in the D35 (thiophene) Raman spectrum is the result of a single atom change from oxygen in AB3 (furan) to a sulfur. Given that the experimental conditions were held constant, this single atom is responsible for the large change in the Raman spectrum when I2 is present. The changes are consistent with a sulfur–halogen bonding event to I2 as discussed in the computational section below.

To reduce the possible influence of the nitrogen atom of the amine donor during these studies, the simple alkoxy donor-based dyes, LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan), were examined in an identical study. Changes in the Raman spectra were subtler for these two derivatives which could be due to the absence of nitrogen–I2 interactions or due to a less electron rich thiophene binding weaker to I2 when only a relatively weak ether donor is used. A larger difference in the relative intensity of the peaks between 1000–1600 cm−1 with and without I2 present is observed for LD03 (thiophene, Fig. 3c) when compared with the 300–1000 cm−1 region, while the change for LD04 (furan, Fig. 3d) is less dramatic when these regions are compared. These results indicate a difference in the influence of I2 on the Raman spectrum of LD03 (thiophene) when compared to LD04 (furan) which may be attributed to the stronger binding of I2 by thiophene. This observation is consistent with Raman spectroscopy studies performance on films of D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan).
Computational analysis
To gain insight into the changes observed experimentally in the Raman spectra, the interactions of AB1 (thiophene), AB2 (furan), D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) with I2 were probed computationally to examine the hypothesis of thiophene interacting non-covalently with I2 more strongly than furan. AB1 (thiophene) and AB2 (furan) were also of interest since spectroscopic film studies in the presence of I2 could not be conducted. Since LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan) displayed similar Raman spectra trends to D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan), the more common benchmark dye D35 (thiophene) was chosen for computational studies to compare with analogue AB3 (furan). First, geometries of the dyes were optimized in two different conformations (referred to as cis and trans based on the orientation of the CN group of the cyanoacrylic acid relative to the thiophene sulfur or furan oxygen atoms, Fig. 4) in isolation without I2 present at the wB97XD/6-31+G* level of theory. On TiO2 film surfaces the exact dye geometry is challenging to predict, thus two geometries were analyzed for the four dyes examined. Calculations were conducted in the absence of solvent and the TiO2 surface to reduce the complexity in trying to evaluate vibrational changes induced by non-covalent bonding with a large number of atoms present.

To examine the dye interactions of I2 at the thiophene or furan rings, I2 was positioned near the heterocycles of the geometry optimized dyes in space with a linear orientation of I2 and the S/O atom all in the same plane as the heterocycle. The geometries were then optimized to the lowest energy conformation. It is noteworthy that a number of binding sites are evident on each dye with stronger binding at the nitrogen atoms of the triarylamine and cyanoacrylic acid; however, these binding events are present in all dyes. We have focused on the heterocycles as these binding events differentiate the thiophene and furan dyes. A close interaction for sulfur and iodine of ∼3.45 Å is observed for cis- or trans-AB1 (thiophene) with an end-on binding to I2 at the presumed sigma-hole location (Fig. 5 and Table 1). When comparing these results to AB2 (furan) it is interesting that only one conformer (trans) binds I2 to give a linear O–I2 geometry orientation. The cis-AB2 (furan) conformer does not show an energy minimum with a linear geometry, but instead the I2 shifts to above the π-face of the system as the nearest energy minimum (Table 1 and Fig. 5). This result supports our experimental finding that sulfur of thiophene binds I2 stronger than the oxygen of furan, since one of the potential binding sites for furan is non-active in the cis conformation. For the cases where I2 adopts a linear orientation relative to the sulfur and oxygen atoms, the I2 molecule adopts a 65° to 81° dihedral angle with the π-system of the heterocycle (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Similar results are observed when the trans and cis isomers of D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) are compared. For the comparable trans isomers, the location of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offer some insight into the nature of this binding event. The HOMO of trans-D35 (thiophene) and trans-AB3 (furan) is delocalized onto the heterocycles (Fig. 6, see ESI† for AB1 and AB2 orbitals). In both cases the LUMO is heavily localized on the I2 molecule suggesting an intermolecular charge transfer event may be possible. This interaction is indicative of a halogen bonding event in a conformation that would be predicted by a first principle approximation.

Binding energies were analyzed for these dyes to I2 by summing the energies of the dye and I2 separately optimized in isolation, then comparing with the system energy having both the dye and I2 present. Again, only the trans isomers could be compared as no cis-AB2 (furan)–I2 optimized geometry could be located which was comparable to thiophene analogue (Table 1). The trans-AB1 (thiophene)–I2 binding energy was found to be stronger than that of the trans-AB2 (furan)–I2 binding energy by a 0.11 kcal difference. A very similar analysis can be made comparing D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan), with AB3 (furan) again showing no binding in a linear orientation to I2 for the cis conformer and the trans conformer showing weaker binding relative to the trans-D35 (thiophene) analogue (Fig. 6 and Table 1). When the cis and trans isomers are compared for the thiophene based dyes AB1 and D35, a 0.42–0.44 kcal mol−1 greater binding energy is present for the cis isomers. Thus, not only do thiophene-based dyes have a stronger analogue binding mode than the furans in the trans conformation, but they also bind even stronger in the cis conformation which is exclusive to thiophene. These results suggest that an I2 binding event may not be completely absent from furan heterocycles, but thiophene analogues exhibit much stronger halogen bonding interactions in multiple conformations.
Having found optimized geometries for D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) with and without I2, we simulated Raman spectra from DFT calculations at the wB97XD/6-31+G* level of theory to better understand the vibrational modes in the 1400–1800 cm−1 range of the experimental Raman spectrum which were changing much more dramatically for D35 (thiophene) in the presence of I2 relative to AB3 (furan, Fig. 3 and Fig. S1, ESI†). Two different geometries for each dye were analyzed with and without I2 present. While the simulated spectra can be used to help understand the experimental spectra, a direct comparison cannot be made since the simulated Raman spectra is obtained in the gas phase with only one I2 molecule present and under harmonic approximations while the experimental data was collected on the surface with acetonitrile solvent present with a large excess of I2 molecules. Thus, the comparison of the data is restricted to broad wavenumber ranges rather than to wavenumber peaks. It could be seen that in both the cis and trans conformations for AB3 (furan) no shift or emergence of new peaks can be seen when I2 is present and only a slight change in intensities for 2–3 peaks between 1500–1700 cm−1 is observed (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, in terms of D35 (thiophene), the cis conformation shows a slight change in intensity along with a shifting of peaks between 1500–1600 cm−1 by 3–5 cm−1 toward higher energy, while the trans conformation shows intensity changes and some shifting of peaks near 1100 and 1600 cm−1 with a new peak at ∼1250 cm−1 evident (Fig. S1, ESI†). For the DFT Raman spectra, the 1500–1600 cm−1 region where the most significant changes occur corresponds to ring breathing and stretching modes for both thiophene and furan. Experimentally, the largest changes in the Raman spectrum are occurring near this region as well. Given that the experimental changes when I2 is present were significantly more pronounced for the thiophene based dyes, this suggests that I2 is interacting stronger with thiophene resulting in significant changes in ring breathing/stretching modes for this heterocycle but to a lesser extent for furan. It is reasonable that the presence of this interaction for thiophene is due to halogen bonding from the sulfur atom to I2.
UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy
To further evaluate our hypothesis that the sulfur of thiophene binds I2 more strongly than the oxygen of furan, we measured film UV-Vis absorption spectra for D35 (thiophene), AB3 (furan), LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan). We reasoned that if I2 binding were occurring with thiophene effects should also be visible in the UV-Vis spectrum. A S–I2 halogen bond would be predicted to red-shift the dye absorption spectrum since the I2 serves as an electron acceptor which would lower the LUMO energy based on first approximations. Therefore, we predict significant observable changes in dye absorption transition energies for the thiophene-based dyes D35 and LD03 due to S–I2 binding and relatively minor changes for the furan-based dyes AB3 and LD04 due to a weaker O–I2 interaction. To probe this prediction, we prepared TiO2 films of each of the dyes and submerged them in solutions of acetonitrile with and without I2 present. The UV-Vis spectra were analyzed by comparing the shift in the λmax and shape of the normalized absorption curves. On TiO2 films submerged in acetonitrile with and without I2, the λmax of D35 (thiophene) shifts about 10 nm, while the λmax of AB3 (furan) shows no shift (Fig. 7). For the simple alkoxy donor dyes, LD03 (thiophene) shows a 7 nm shift in the λmax value, while LD04 (furan) shows a smaller 3 nm shift (Fig. 7). The larger shift in λmax for the thiophene based dyes can be attributed to a halogen bonding event due to the presence of I2 binding stronger with the sulfur atom in thiophene than the oxygen of furan. Additionally, the shift toward lower energy photon absorption (red-shift) in the presence of I2 occurs as predicted. This is consistent with the hypothesis that halogen bonding with thiophene and I2 is occurring by donation of electron density from the sulfur to I2.

To computationally probe the experimentally observed changes in the UV-Vis spectrum in the presence of I2, time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were undertaken to evaluate which orbitals were contributing to the observed red-shift and to identify the position of these orbitals. If I2 binding is causing the red-shift, a low energy transition of electron density from the dye to I2 is predicted. To evaluate this prediction, the first 10 states were examined using the previously optimized geometries (both cis and trans for each dye) for AB1 (thiophene), AB2 (furan), D35 (thiophene), and AB3 (furan) with TD-DFT calculations at the wB97XD/6-31+G* level of theory. For all of the dyes, in the presence of I2 the first two states have very low oscillator strengths (f of ∼0.0005) ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 eV lower in energy than the first major transition (Tables S2–S9, ESI†). The transitions for the first two states also involve a large number of orbitals (up to five occupied to unoccupied transitions). The first strong transition (state 3, f of 0.99) for cisAB1 (thiophene) is made up of several transitions from occupied orbitals centered on the dye with no significant concentration on I2 to unoccupied orbitals localized on I2. Among the transitions involved in this state, the HOMO–LUMO transition is the strongest contributor at 27% followed by the HOMO−1 to LUMO at 15% with 9 total transitions (Table S2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Compared to the first state (f = 1.7, primarily HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO) of cisAB1 (thiophene) in the absence of I2, state 3 of cisAB1 (thiophene) with I2 is 0.14 eV lower in energy. Analysis of transAB1 (thiophene) with and without I2 reveals a very similar set of observations (Fig. 8 and Fig. S3, Table S3, ESI†). As noted previously, the geometry minima for cisAB2 (furan) is significantly different. However, for both cis and trans isomers of AB2 (furan), the first two states show very weak oscillator strengths, and the first major oscillator strength observed is for state 3 when I2 is present. State 3 for cisAB2 (furan) is still comprised of the same dominant orbital transitions as cisAB1 (thiophene) (HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO, Table S4 and Fig. S4, ESI†) and a similar magnitude red-shift, but with fewer transition (5 versus 9). Interestingly, the oscillator strength for the third state is significantly lower in strength for cisAB2 (furan) than for cisAB1 (thiophene) (0.15 versus 0.99). This again suggests a significantly stronger interaction of I2 with thiophene than furan and supports a S–I2 halogen bonding hypothesis. transAB2 (furan) follows the same analysis as cisAB2 (furan) only with a dramatically lower oscillator strength for state 3 (f = 0.02, Fig. 8 and Fig. S5, Table S5, ESI†). This data suggests a very weak interaction between the furan heterocycle and I2 presumably due to the lack of a significant halogen bonding event between O and I2. These weak red-shifted transition oscillator strengths for AB2 (furan) in the presence of I2 are consistent with the relatively minor changes observed by experimental UV-Vis spectroscopy for the furan-based dyes (AB3 and LD04). Computationally, AB1 (thiophene) shows a much stronger red-shifted transition oscillator strength in the presence of I2 which is consistent with the experimental data for the thiophene dyes (D35 and LD03) showing a significant red-shift of the UV-Vis spectrum in the presence of I2. Computationally, both cis and trans isomers of D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) follow a similar trend to that described above for AB1 (thiophene) and AB2 (furan) (Tables S6–S9, ESI†). The experimental and computational data is again consistent with a stronger S–I2 halogen bonding event than O–I2.

Device data
Given the spectroscopic observations from the surface Raman studies and film UV-Vis studies, several predictions about the performance of the furan-based and thiophene-based dyes in DSC devices can be made based on the cascade of electron transfer events after photoexcitation of the dye. After the injection of an electron from the photoexcited dye into the TiO2 CB (eqn (1)), the ground-state dye can be regenerated with iodide (eqn (2)). Although a number of possible electron transfer pathways exist concerning the iodide redox shuttle,34 a commonly cited pathway suggests the I2− product from eqn (2) can then undergo disproportionation to give I3− and I−viaeqn (3). I3− represents the fully oxidized redox shuttle species in DSC devices and is involved with an equilibrium reaction to give I2 and I−viaeqn (4). Thus, I2 is both continuously being generated within the DSC cell under operational conditions and is explicitly added to the electrolyte to generate a concentration of the triiodide species in solution needed for rapid electron collection at the counter electrode. The electrons injected into the TiO2 CB can either traverse an external circuit to the counter electrode as desired before following the reverse reactions eqn (3) and the reduction of I2−viaeqn (5) to give the original iodide reductant, or these electrons can be transferred to an oxidizing species directly from the TiO2 CB undesirably (eqn (6)). Specifically, the recombination rate of electrons in the TiO2 semiconductor conduction band (CB) with the redox shuttle should be slower for the furan-based dyes compared with the thiophene-based analogues if the sulfur of thiophene is halogen bonding to I2 near the TiO2 surface. The rate of this recombination is a function of distance for the through-space electron transfer, and sulfur halogen bonding with I2 will increase the local concentration of I2 near the TiO2 surface to promote the undesirable electron transfer shown in eqn (6): dye* + TiO2 → dye+ + TiO2(e−)(1) dye+ + 2I− → dye + I2−(2) 2I2− → I3− + I−(3) I3− ⇌ I2 + I−(4) I2− + e− → 2I−(5) I2 + TiO2(e−) → I2− + TiO2(6)
Since eqn (6) represents a non-productive DSC device electron transfer pathway, it will lower photocurrent because fewer electrons are traveling the external circuit. Additionally, the electron transfer event represented by eqn (6) will also lower photovoltage since electrons are being transferred out of TiO2 more rapidly leading to a depletion of the number of electrons in the TiO2 CB and lowering the TiO2 Fermi level. These predictions can all be tested through a series of DSC device measurements including current–voltage (J–V) curve, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and small modulation photovoltage transient measurements.
First device performances were analyzed for all of the dyes via J–V curve measurements (Fig. 9 and Table 2). In all cases, the furan-based dyes (AB2, AB3, LD04) gave both higher current and voltage than the thiophene analogues (AB1, D35, LD03) as is predicted if a S–I2 halogen bonding event were occurring. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) values averaged 28 mV higher and the short-circuit current density (Jsc) values averaged 0.5 mA cm−2 higher for the furan derivatives. Via the equation PCE = (Voc × Jsc × FF)/I0, where FF is fill-factor and I0 is the sun intensity (set to 1 for this study), the furan-based dyes were found to average 0.6% higher in PCE. This equates to a >10% overall gain in performance for the furan-based dyes when compared with the thiophene-based dyes. Upon analysis of the IPCE spectrum, thiophene based dyes AB1 and D35 are significantly red-shifted relative to the furan analogues (AB2 and AB3, respectively); however, the peak IPCE value for the furan analogues is significantly higher which explains the observed photocurrents via the J–V curve measurements (Fig. 10). The red-shift of the IPCE spectrum is similar to that observed in the UV-Vis measurements for D35 (thiophene) when I2 was added. It is noteworthy, that there is little change in the dye–film absorption spectrum under pure acetonitrile when D35 (thiophene) and AB3 (furan) absorption spectrum are compared (Fig. 7). As hypothesized for the UV-Vis data explanation, the IPCE red-shift from the furan dyes can be rationalized as I2 binding to the thiophene containing dyes to remove electron density from the π-system and lowering the LUMO energy of the system. Having I2 coordinate to the sulfur in thiophene results in electron density being pulled out of the system, effectively lowering the LUMO of the dye and shrinking the HOMO–LUMO gap as was shown via TD-DFT above. This causes the thiophene-based dyes IPCE's to be selectively red-shifted relative to the film absorption spectrum. For the LD03 (thiophene)/LD04 (furan) comparison, the IPCE onset values are similar, but the furan derivative again shows a higher peak performance. The relative increased peak IPCE performance is consistent with the S of thiophene halogen bonding to I2 to promote unwanted recombination, while a significantly weaker interaction (if any) is present for the O of furan with I2 which does not promote recombination.

To better understand the rate of recombination of electrons in the TiO2 CB with I2 (eqn (6)), electron lifetime measurements were made via small modulated photovoltage transient studies (Fig. 11). Given the larger Voc and Jsc values for the furan-based dyes, longer electron lifetimes are expected for AB2 (furan), AB3 (furan), and LD04 (furan) than the thiophene analogues. This is indeed the case, with AB2 (furan) and LD04 (furan) showing dramatically longer electron lifetimes than AB1 (thiophene) and LD03 (thiophene) (Fig. 11). Even for the case of the exceptionally long electron lifetime benchmark dye D35 (thiophene), the furan analogue AB3 shows a longer electron lifetime. These results add further evidence that the sulfur of thiophene is halogen bonding with I2 near the TiO2 surface to promote a faster electron recombination event.

Since Voc and Jsc device performance metrics are often correlated to dye loadings, dye desorption studies were conducted to probe if dye loading could have had a significant influence in the device data results in addition to the stronger halogen bonding of thiophene relative to furan (Table 2). While the dye analogues only differ by a single atom, the atom used in the heterocycle has a significant influence on the geometry of the substituents at the 2 and 5 positions of furan or thiophene. The O–C bond lengths are shorter for furan which leads to more of a “U” shape, while the S–C bonds are longer in the case of thiophene which leads to more of a linear geometry. The variation in geometry could result in a difference in dye loading despite the seemingly subtle change of a single atom. However, the dye loadings were all found to be similar between the analogues. Specifically, the dye loadings for AB1 (thiophene) and AB2 (furan) were found to be near identical at 2.5 × 10−7 mol cm−2, and D35 (thiophene) was found to have a dye loading within 25% of the value of AB3 (furan). Interestingly, the dye loading varied the most between LD03 (thiophene) and LD04 (furan) with about 55% more LD03 (thiophene) in the devices, yet despite the higher dye loadings for the thiophene based dye, the furan-based dye still has a higher photocurrent, photovoltage, and electron lifetime within DSC devices. This highlights that the factors controlling the recombination rate for these systems is certainly more than just a simple surface blocking model dominated by dye loadings. These observations further suggest that the halogen bonding of S to I2 is a primary factor in the uniformly lower Voc and Jsc values of thiophene dyes relative to furan.
Conclusion
Overall, evidence for stronger binding of I2 to thiophene containing dyes versus furan containing dyes is observed. Raman spectroscopy on TiO2 surface bound dyes shows a much more dramatic change in the intensity and shifting of vibrational peaks in the presence of iodine for thiophene-based dyes LD03 and D35 relative to the furan-based analogues LD04 and AB3, respectively. UV-Vis analysis again lends evidence of I2 binding LD03 (thiophene) and D35 (thiophene) on TiO2 by showing a red shift in the λmax. Indirect evidence of I2 binding could be seen for AB1 (thiophene) and AB2 (furan) where device Voc and Jsc measurements show a higher value for the furan-based dye despite identical dye loadings. This suggests a lower recombination rate which was confirmed via electron lifetime studies through small modulated photovoltage transient measurements for AB1 and AB2. IPCE measurements also showed a red-shift and decrease in IPCE for thiophene based dyes AB1 and D35 similar to the addition of an electron withdrawing group, hinting toward the coordination of I2 to sulfur lowering the LUMO energy. Computational studies lend further support to these experimental observations as the thiophene based dyes AB1 and D35 were both found to have a stronger influence from an I2 binding mode at the sulfur atom of thiophene than at the oxygen atom of furan for AB2 and AB3, respectively. TD-DFT results reveal that the thiophene based dyes more readily transfer electron density (have a higher oscillator strength) from the dye to I2via the HOMO centered on the dye and LUMO centered on I2. The oscillator strengths were significantly lower for the analogous charge transfer event with furan-based dyes. This study shows substantial evidence for I2 binding to the sulfur atoms of thiophene which means dyes should be carefully designed to reduce S and I2 interactions near the TiO2 surface for higher device performances.

Raman experimental details
A Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR Evolution Raman Spectroscopy system was used for the acquisition of Raman spectra. The 633 nm line from a HeNe laser was focused onto solid samples using a 100× objective with a 0.9 NA and a 1800 grooves per mm grating and CCD camera were used for detection.
Computational details
All geometry optimization and binding energy calculations were completed with Gaussian 16 package.35 wB97XD functional36 was used to include long-range corrections with D2 dispersion model.37 Tight optimization criteria were used for both force and density matrix convergence along with ultrafine grid for numerical integration. We used a 6-31+G* basis set for all atoms except for I, where we used LANL2DZdp38,39 basis set and associated effective core potential. Each dye molecules consists of two different configurations; cis- and trans-, which are defined as whether the S (for thiophene ring) and O (for furan ring) were on the same or on the different side of N (for nitrile functional group). For the binding energy calculations, 5 (five) different sites were considered for AB1 and AB2; however, in case of AB3 and D35, 4 (four) different sites were considered. In each of these sites, the I2 molecule was placed at 4 different locations around the considered sites to account for the variations in binding energy. Frequency calculations indicate all geometries are in their corresponding local minima's.

Photovoltaic device characterization
Photovoltaic characteristics were measured using a 150 W xenon lamp (Model SF150B, SCIENCETECH Inc. Class ABA) solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter for a less than 2% spectral mismatch. Prior to each measurement, the solar simulator output was calibrated with a KG5 filtered mono-crystalline silicon NREL calibrated reference cell from ABET Technologies (Model 15150-KG5). The current density–voltage characteristic of each cell was obtained with a Keithley digital source-meter (Model 2400). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency was measured with an IPCE instrument manufactured by Dyenamo comprised of a 175 W xenon lamp (CERMAX, Model LX175F), monochromator (Spectral Products, Model CM110, Czerny–Turner, dual-grating), filter wheel (Spectral Products, Model AB301T, fitted with filter AB3044 [440 nm high pass] and filter AB3051 [510 nm high pass]), a calibrated UV-enhanced silicon photodiode reference and Dyenamo issued software.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
For the photoanode, TEC 10 glass was purchased from Hartford Glass. Once cut into 2 × 2 cm squares, the substrate was submerged in a 0.2% Deconex 21 aqueous solution and sonicated for 15 minutes at room temperature. The electrodes were rinsed with water and sonicated in acetone 10 minutes followed by sonication in ethanol for 10 minutes. Finally, the electrodes were placed under UV/ozone for 15 minutes (UV-Ozone Cleaning System, Model ProCleaner by UVFAB Systems). A compact TiO2 underlayer is then applied by treatment of the substrate submerged in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution in water (prepared from 99.9% TiCl4 between 0–5 °C). The submerged substrates (conductive side up) were heated for 30 minutes at 70 °C. After heating, the substrates were rinsed first with water then with ethanol. The photoanode consists of thin TiO2 electrodes comprised of a 10 μm mesoporous TiO2 layer (particle size: 20 nm, Dyesol, DSL 18NR-T) for iodine cells with a 5 μm TiO2 scattering layer (particle size: >100 nm, Solaronix R/SP). Both layers were screen printed from a Sefar screen (54/137-64 W) resulting in 5 μm thickness for each print. Between each print, the substrate was heated for 7 minutes at 125 °C and the thickness was measured with a profilometer (Alpha-Step D-500 KLA Tencor). The substrate was then sintered with progressive heating from 125 °C (5 minute ramp from r.t., 5 minute hold) to 325 °C (15 minute ramp from 125 °C, 5 minute hold) to 375 °C (5 minute ramp from 325 °C, 5 minute hold) to 450 °C (5 minute ramp from 375 °C, 15 minute hold) to 500 °C (5 minute ramp from 450 °C, 15 minute hold) using a programmable furnace (Vulcan® 3-Series Model 3-550). The cooled, sintered photoanode was soaked 30 minutes at 70 °C in a 40 mM TiCl4 water solution and heated again at 500 °C for 30 minutes prior to sensitization. The complete working electrode was prepared by immersing the TiO2 film into the dye solution for 16 hours. The solution for all the dyes consists of 0.3 mM dye, with 40× of CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) (i.e. 40:1, CDCA:dye ratio) in (4:1) EtOH:THF. For preparing the counter electrode, 2 × 2 cm squares of TEC 7 FTO glass were drilled using Dremel-4000 with a Dremel 7134 Diamond Taper Point Bit from the back side to a taped FTO side. After the tape was removed, the electrodes were washed with water followed by a 0.1 M HCl in EtOH wash and sonication in acetone bath for 10 minutes. The washed electrodes were then dried at 400 °C for 15 minutes. A thin layer of Pt-paste (Solaronix, Platisol T/SP) on TCO was slot printed though a punched tape and the printed electrodes were then cured at 450 °C for 10 minutes. After allowing them to cool to room temperature, the working electrodes were then sealed with a 25 μm thick hot melt film (Meltonix 1170-25, Solaronix) by heating the system at 130 °C under 0.2 psi pressure for 1 minute. Devices were completed by filling the electrolyte through the pre-drilled holes in the counter electrodes and finally the holes were sealed with a Meltonix 1170-25 circle and a thin glass cover slip by heating at 130 °C under pressure 0.1 psi for 25 seconds. Finally, soldered contacts were added with a MBR Ultrasonic soldering machine (model USS-9210) with solder alloy (Cerasolzer wire dia 1.6 mm item # CS186-150). A circular black mask (active area 0.15 cm2) punched from black tape was used in the subsequent photovoltaic studies.
Electron lifetime measurements
Electron lifetime measurements via small modulated photovoltage transient measurements, were carried out with a Dyenamo Toolbox (DN-AE01) instrument and software. The intensity of the LED light source (Seoul Semiconductors, Natural White, S42182H, 450 to 750 nm emission) is varied to modulate the device open-circuit voltage. The biased light intensity was modulated by applied voltages of 2.80, 2.85, 2.90, 2.95, and 3.00 V applied to the LED with the 3.0 V bias approaching 1 sun intensity (97%). The direction of illumination was from the photoanode to the counter electrode, and the device was positioned 5 cm from the LED light source. The voltage rise and decay times are fitted with a Levenberg–Marquardt fitting algorithm via LabView, and the electron lifetime was obtained from the averaging of rise and decay time.
