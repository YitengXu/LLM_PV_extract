    , Accepted 20th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractExploring cost-effective counter electrodes (CEs) with high electrocatalytic activity and excellent electrochemical stability is one of concerned issues for practicable applications of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Graphene (G), featuring unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates. Nevertheless, the relationships between the electrochemical activity and the intrinsic structure of G need to be further understood. Herein, we report a facile yet effective strategy for engineering sulfur-doped porous graphene (SPG) using sulfur powder as the sulfur source and pore-forming agent. The as-made SPG as the CE for DSSCs achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 8.67%, which is superior to Pt (7.88%), and robust electrochemical stability. The influence of annealing temperature on SPG is analyzed, and SPG prepared at 900 °C shows the best photovoltaic and electrochemical performance. Both experimental and theoretical efforts first elucidate that highly exposed rich edge sites and interconnected porous channels, as well as low ionization energy derived from sulfur species within the G matrix play vital roles in enhanced reaction kinetics and triiodide reduction activity. The present work will inspire the construction of porous graphene with surface-enriched active sites and interconnected networks for advanced energy applications.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as potentially cost-effective alternatives to silicon-based and thin-film solar cells, have triggered wide concerns.1,2 The counter electrode (CE), a crucial component of DSSCs, plays a vital role in collecting electrons deriving from external circuits and catalyzing the reduction of triiodide (I3−) to iodide (I−). Most widely used CEs are noble metal platinum (Pt) with poor electrochemical stability,3,4 which inhibits large-scale and practical application of DSSCs to a great degree. Therefore, extensive efforts have been devoted to reducing or superseding Pt CEs by using Pt-metal alloys,5,6 transition metal sulfides,7,8 and carbonaceous materials, such as conducting polymers,9,10 carbon black,11–13 carbon nanotubes,14 and carbon nanofibers.15,16 These carbonaceous materials feature intrinsic economic feasibility, large surface areas, and high stability in electrochemical environments,17 which can largely meet the practical requirements of DSSCs.
Graphene (G), a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of graphite, has been tremendously popular in both scientific and manufacturing fields due to its unique physicochemical properties.18,19 Nevertheless, the easy aggregation and irreversible restacking of G have sparked inevitable issues due to the strong π–π interaction between G sheets, such as loss of catalytically active sites, deterioration of the accessible specific surface area, and deficiency of connected channels for ion transport. Porous G with an interconnected texture could well maintain the intrinsic properties of individual G sheets to a great degree, and possesses a large surface area, indicating fascinating aspects in some fields, especially energy storage/conversion devices.20–24 The macropores in porous G could act as ion-buffering reservoirs, which facilitate a high mass transport rate in liquid electrolytes by minimizing ion transport pathways and contribute to enhanced kinetics and improved electrochemical performance.25 Such a porous G material would be applicable to I3− reduction reactions, achieving fast kinetics for DSSCs. And it will be meaningful to uncover the influence of interconnected frameworks of porous G on I3− ion diffusion.
It is also noted that the electrochemically inert nature of G basal planes restricts the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of bulk G.26–29 Tailoring porous G with electrochemically active basal planes remains a major challenge. More recently, both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that sulfur (S) species can tune the electronic structure of G, and produce highly active sites with minimum change of the carbon conjugation length.30–33 On the other hand, the particular roles of S species within the G backbone in I3− reduction in DSSCs are obscure and need to be uncovered in detail.
With these points in mind, we report a novel strategy to engineer sulfur-doped porous G (SPG) by ball milling followed by an in situ S doping process. A ball milling technique has a capability of transforming G with a large size into smaller ones and endowing G with rich active edge sites. In the post-annealing stage, sulfur powder functions as the S source and pore-forming agent, which benefits the activation of G basal planes and formation of interconnected porous structures. Thanks to these unique characteristics of SPG, an impressive electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− with a PCE of 8.67% is delivered when first applied as the CE for DSSCs, outperforming the Pt reference (7.88%). Superb electrochemical stability of SPG is subsequently demonstrated. The theoretical calculations further reveal that the S species within the SPG framework could moderate the electronic properties of adjacent carbon atoms, and remarkably reduce the ionization energy, thus accelerating charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The present work provides a facile yet efficient strategy to configure G materials with interconnected porous structures and surface-enriched active sites for advanced energy devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Materials preparation

Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO). 
GO was synthesized through a modified Hummers' method reported elsewhere. For a typical run, 5 g of graphite powder and 2.5 g sodium nitrate (NaNO3) were added into a beaker (1 L) containing 130 ml of concentrated sulfur acid (H2SO4, 98%) in an ice bath. After stirring for 2 h, 15 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) was carefully added, and stirred for another 2 h. Then, the beaker was transferred to a constant temperature water bath and maintained under stirring at 35 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, 230 ml deionized water was added into the mixture dropwise and stirred at 98 °C for 30 min. Additional 400 ml deionized water and 10 ml hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were poured into the solution. The reaction mixture was centrifuged with deionized water until the pH was neutral, and then the GO dispersion was produced.


Preparation of G. 
200 mg of GO dried via lyophilization was ground into powder, and it was placed into a zirconia capsule (100 ml) containing 53 g of zirconia balls (diameter, 3 mm), the processes of which were conducted in a glovebox filled with argon. The capsule was then sealed and fixed in a planetary ball-milling machine (PM 100, Retsch, Germany) and rotated at 300 rpm for 12 h. The partly reduced GO powder was transferred from the container to a quartz boat. Then, the G with abundant edge sites was achieved after annealing at 900 °C for 2 h under nitrogen.
To prepare SPG species, dried GO (0.2 g) and sulfur powder (0.5 g) were added into the zirconia container, and the following procedures are similar to those of G synthesis. The ball-milled mixture (0.2 g) and sulfur powder (0.5 g) were loaded into two individual ceramic boats, and placed in the middle and the upstream side of the quartz tube, respectively. When the temperature of the furnace increased to 800 °C, 900 °C, or 1000 °C under nitrogen, the quartz tube was quickly pushed into the hot zone, and maintained for 2 h. After that, a black powder was collected.
For comparison, G without ball milling treatment (ut-G) was also prepared via annealing GO powder directly under 900 °C.

2.2. Assembly of DSSCs

Fabrication of various CEs. 
The G, ut-G, and SPG samples were mixed with carboxyethyl cellulose solution through grinding, forming three kinds of slurries. Briefly, 30 mg of CE sample was ground with 0.5 mL of binder containing ethyl cellulose, ethanol, and terpineol in a mass ratio of 1:9:8 for 15 minutes, leading to a CE slurry. These slurries were transferred onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses through the doctor-blade method, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min in N2, yielding different CEs. Reference Pt CEs were purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech. New Energy Co., Ltd., China. The thickness of G, ut-G, and SPG CEs was measured by using a film thickness gauge (SURFCOM 130A, Japan). The thickness of all CEs is similar because of the same concentration of CE slurries, which is determined to be ca. 10 μm on average.
TiO2 photoanodes (Yingkou OPV Tech. New Energy Co., Ltd., China) were heated to 500 °C for 30 min, and when cooling to 100 °C, the TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M anhydrous ethanol solution of N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) for 20 h. The dye-loaded TiO2 anodes and the CEs were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (Surlyn, Yingkou OPV Tech. New Energy Co., Ltd., China) of 45 μm thickness and sealed through hot pressing. Then, the electrolyte (OPV-AN-I, Yingkou OPV Tech. New Energy Co., Ltd., China) was injected into the cell through the pre-drilled holes on the CEs. The sealed cells were used for the photocurrent–voltage test with an active area of 0.16 cm2.

2.3. Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2400, RIGAKU, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra of all samples were achieved by using a DXR Raman Microscope (Thermo Scientific) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The morphologies of all samples were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 450, FEI, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai G220). The chemical composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with Al Kα X-ray radiation (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted at different scan rates in a three-electrode system, in which the as-prepared CE was taken as the working electrode, an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the CE in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements, dummy cells were assembled using two identical CEs filled with the same electrolyte used in the DSSCs. The EIS spectra and Tafel curves were characterized by using Multichannel Potentiostats (VSP, Bio-Logic, France). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were determined by using a Keithley 2400 source meter equipped with an AAA solar simulator (94032A, Newport, USA) under AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2.
2.4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
DFT calculations were used to investigate the ionization energy (Ei) of SPG slabs and the pure G slab. To simulate the real solution conditions and ensure the reality of the DFT calculations, the acetonitrile solution was taken into consideration. The geometry optimization of S-doped G slabs and the pure G slab was performed at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of the theory with a PCM model of the acetonitrile solvent.34 The Ei is calculated as follows: Ei = En − Eion, where En and Eion are the energies of neutral molecules and positive ions in the ground state, respectively. All of the calculations are completed on the Gaussian 09 suite package.35
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Materials preparation and structural characterizations
The schematic diagram of the fabrication process of SPG is shown in Fig. 1a. For a typical run, graphene oxide (GO) and sulfur were placed into a zirconia capsule and treated by ball milling under an Ar atmosphere. The obtained mixture that was transferred to a ceramic boat, coupled with another boat with sulfur, and were annealed, finally yielding SPG with surface-enriched active sites and interpenetrated porous structures.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of preparation of SPG. (b) XRD patterns and (c) Raman spectra of GO, G, and SPG. 
The typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1b) of GO shows a characteristic diffraction peak at 10.6°, which is indexed to the (001) plane and corresponds to an increased interlayer distance of 0.83 nm compared with that (0.34 nm) of graphite. After ball milling and annealing treatment, the peaks at 10.6° for G and SPG completely disappear, indicative of the removal of most oxygen-containing groups on the carbon surface and improved graphitization degree. Compared with G, the peak at 25.7° for SPG, indexed to the (002) plane, is somewhat weak and wide. The reason for this would be the additionally increased defects caused by in situ S doping. The structural information of the as-made products was also analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1c, all samples display two peaks at ca. 1350 cm−1 and 1592 cm−1, which are assigned to D- and G-bands, respectively. It is commonly believed that the D-band is related to structural defects within the G backbone.36 The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) could reflect the amount of defects in G basal planes or edge planes.37,38 It is found that the ID/IG value of GO is 0.94, whereas the ratio of G slightly increased to 1.23, which can be attributed to the as-made rich edge sites derived from ball milling treatment and the defects stemmed from the loss of atoms by decomposition of oxygen-containing groups in the annealing stage.39 It is also noted that the ID/IG of SPG further increases to 1.52 due to the incorporation of S species into the G matrix.
The morphological structures of the as-made products were investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2a and j, G without ball milling treatment (ut-G) manifests agglomerate structures because of the strong π–π interaction between 2D G sheets. This is not the case after ball milling: G with a much small size and rich exposed edge sites was exhibited (Fig. 2b and k), which could be favorable for improvement of the electrochemical performance of bulk G. When treated by ball milling and an in situ S doping process, porous structures were produced and observed for SPG, and the pore diameter changes in a range of 40–150 nm. Owing to the nature of easy melting and sublimation, the sulfur particles embedded within the G matrix would act as the pore-forming agents at high annealing temperature, thus leading to porous structures of the as-made samples (Fig. S1†). The interpenetrated porous structures of SPG will afford a large accessible surface area for the electrolyte, which was confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption results (Fig. S2†). It is noted that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of SPG is 416 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that of G (149 m2 g−1). Such a relatively high surface area and porous structures of SPG could profit the accessibility to the liquid electrolyte and ion diffusion.

The surface components of the as-made SPG were further revealed by the SEM mappings and X-ray energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), the detailed results of which are shown in Fig. 2e–i. It can be noted that C, O, and S species coexist within the SPG. The S species homogeneously distribute inside the SPG backbone, indicative of successful doping of S species. Chemical components (elemental analysis, Table S1†) show that the amounts of C, O, and S in SPG are 77.54 wt%, 10.13 wt%, and 11.48 wt%, respectively. In contrast to pristine GO, the content of O in SPG reduces sharply, implying few oxygen-containing functional groups within the SPG matrix. The basal planes of SPG activated by the incorporation of S species would contribute to its excellent electrochemical performance.
To further discern the chemical composition and valence state details of the as-made samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. As can be observed in Fig. 3a, S signals appear in the XPS survey spectrum of SPG. For comparison, the XPS spectra of GO and G were also recorded, and the related results are shown in Fig. 3a and S3.† The high resolution C 1s XPS spectrum of SPG (Fig. 3b) exhibits C–S (284.0 eV), CC (284.6 eV), C–C (285.7 eV), C–O (286.5 eV), and CO (288.8 eV) configurations.40,41 Compared with those of pristine GO and G, the CC peak of SPG is predominant and the peaks corresponding to oxygen-containing functional groups drop significantly, which are in good accordance with the elemental analysis above. As for the high resolution S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3c), four different peaks are clearly identified by the bonding states of S species. The first one at 161.8 eV is indexed to thiol (–S–H) located at the edge of SPG.42,43 The second and the third peak at 163.6 eV and 164.9 eV could be assigned to the characteristic S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 positions of the C–S covalent bond of thiophene-S owing to their spin–orbit coupling.44–46 The last component at 167.4 eV originates from the oxidized sulfur groups (sulfone, –C–SO2–C–).30,47 The atomic ratios of these three types of S species are tabulated in Table S2.† Apparently, the thiophene-S species are the predominant ones (87.40 at%) within the SPG backbone, which is attributed to their thermal stability at high temperature.46 These S species (Fig. 3d) could function as additional active sites and modulate the electronic structure of G basal planes, thus being helpful for I3− reduction, which will be discussed and verified by the following electrochemical investigations and DFT calculations.

(d) Schematic diagram of SPG with different S configurations, in which grey, yellow, red, purple, blue, and green balls represent carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, thiol-S, thiophene-S, and sulfone-S atoms, respectively. 
3.2. Electrochemical and photovoltaic characterizations
The electroactive surface area (Se) is one of the critical parameters for evaluating the performance of electrocatalysts. Here, the Se of the as-made products was measured, the results of which are shown in Fig. S4 and Table S3.† It can be noted that the Se of G (1.597 cm2) is much larger than that of ut-G, indicating that rich edge sites for G are produced through the ball milling process. In the case of the SPG sample, the Se value increases to 2.189 cm2, which is far higher than that of Pt (0.337 cm2). Such a large Se and interconnected porous structures of SPG will be favorable for offering abundant active sites and contact between the electrode and electrolyte, thus effectively avoiding charge loss at the electrode/electrolyte interface for DSSCs.
To examine the potential of the as-made samples as inexpensive CEs for DSSCs, the corresponding cells with sandwiched structures were assembled and tested. Fig. 4a presents the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves. The short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE values of these devices are listed in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that all the adopted CEs have delivered similar Voc, which is determined by the separation of the Fermi level of the photoanode and the electrochemical potential of the redox couple.48 The device based on the ut-G CE produces a Jsc of 15.50 mA cm−2, a FF of 57.5%, and a PCE of 6.68%. The cell with G as the CE yields a much larger PCE of 7.62% (Jsc = 15.60 mA cm−2, FF = 65.4%). It is noted that there is no noticeable difference in Jsc between G and ut-G CEs; nevertheless, the FF of the G CE shows an obvious enhancement compared to that of ut-G, indicative of better electrocatalytic activity of G towards I3− reduction due to its rich edge sites. And the photovoltaic performance of G is close to that of Pt (Jsc = 16.23 mA cm−2, FF = 64.9%, and PCE = 7.88%), revealing Pt-like catalytic properties. The as-made SPG CE shows a superior performance with a PCE of 8.67%. Specifically, both the Jsc and FF of DSSCs with the SPG CE are higher than those of G and the Pt reference, indicative of its excellent electrocatalytic activity and potential to replace noble Pt. The interconnected structures of SPG lead to a high electroactive surface area, which is instrumental in accessibility for ion diffusion in the electrolyte. On the other hand, the S species within the G backbone could activate the basal planes. As shown in Fig. 4a (inset), the SPG matrix could rapidly transfer electrons from an external circuit to I3− and easily catalyze the reduction of I3−, thus delivering high photovoltaic performance for DSSCs.

To get an insight into the reaction kinetics of G and SPG CEs in DSSCs, the corresponding diffusion coefficients (D) of I3− were estimated using the Randles–Sevcik equation: Ip = Kn3/2ACD1/2V1/2, where Ip represents the peak current, K is the constant of 2.69 × 105, n is the charge transfer number, A is the electrode area, C is the I3− concentration, V is the scan rate, and D is the diffusion coefficient. On the basis of the CV curves of G and SPG (Fig. S5†) at 5 mV s−1, the calculated D value of SPG is 2.46 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1, much larger than that of G (4.27 × 10−7 cm−2 s−1), indicating that the interconnected porous structures of SPG could be favourable for I3− diffusion.
In order to uncover the reason why the electrocatalytic activity of SPG is superior to that of Pt, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in acetonitrile solution consisting of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the detailed results of which are shown in Fig. 4b. It can be clearly observed that all of the CEs exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Aox/Ared and Box/Bred), which are associated with two reactions: I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I− and 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−, respectively. Generally, the intensity of the Ared peak and the separation between Aox and Ared peaks (Epp) are two key parameters to evaluate the catalytic activity of CEs in DSSCs. A high Ared peak current density and low Epp correspond to the excellent electrocatalytic performance of CEs.49 The intensity of the Ared peak for ut-G is relatively weak, suggesting its poor response to the reduction of I3−. Compared with the ut-G sample, the as-made G after ball milling has a small Epp and high Ared peak intensity, implying the positive effects of ball milling on its electrochemical performance. It is also noted that the intensity of the Ared peak for SPG is remarkably higher than that of G and Pt, and the SPG CE possesses a lower Epp value (0.12 V) than G (0.39 V) and Pt (0.32 V), indicative of its high catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−. These combined properties further demonstrate that the S species doped within the G matrix and interconnected pore structures could contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity towards I3− reduction.
To further examine the electrochemical performance of SPG and Pt CEs, the CV curves of corresponding dummy cells assembled via two pieces of identical CEs were recorded and analyzed. As shown in Fig. S6,† the cell with SPG CEs presents a steeper slope at around 0 V and a higher plateau of limiting current than that with Pt, suggesting its excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−,50 which is in good agreement with the discussion above. The CV curves of SPG and Pt CEs at different scan rates were also measured and compared, and the relationship between the square roots of scan rates and the peak intensities of Aox/Ared is displayed in Fig. S7.† A linear relationship is shown, and the peak intensities increase with the increase of scan rate. Such a linear characteristic reveals that the cathodic and anodic reactions are dominated by diffusion-controlled transportation of the I3−/I− redox couple, and there is no specific interaction between the electrolyte and SPG or Pt CEs.51 The reason for this is that as the scan rate increases, the diffusion layer becomes thin and electrochemical polarization becomes strong, thus resulting in poor reversibility and high overpotential.52
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective and commonly used tool to investigate the charge transfer process of electrocatalysts, and to further elucidate the electrocatalytic properties of CEs for DSSCs. Fig. 4c shows the Nyquist plots of EIS spectra of symmetrical dummy cells with two identical SPG or Pt CEs, and the corresponding fitted equivalent circuits. The impedance parameters can be found in Table S4.† Apparently, the SPG dummy cell exhibits three semicircles, which is fitted with a new model (top inset, Fig. 4c) proposed by Aksay and coworkers.53 The high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents serial resistance (Rs), including electrolytic resistance and contact resistance. The high-frequency semicircle means the Nernst diffusion impedance in the pores (Zpore) of electrode materials. The second semicircle is the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrolyte/electrode interface, related to the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode, and constant phase element (CPE). The low-frequency one is attributed to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of ions in the electrolyte. This is not the case for the Pt CE, where I3− reduction occurs on the nonporous surface and the parameter Zpore is accordingly negligible, the relevant equivalent circuit (bottom inset, Fig. 4c) of which is different from that of the SPG sample. It can be noted that the Rs of the SPG CE (1.78 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of Pt (3.97 Ω cm2), indicative of the close contact between the SPG CE and FTO substrate. The SPG also demonstrates a low Rct (0.10 Ω cm2) in comparison to Pt (1.14 Ω cm2), revealing that the SPG CE has a fast response towards the regeneration of I−, which is in agreement with the above CV analysis. Relatively low Rs and Rct could improve the charge collection efficiency and reduce the interfacial charge loss, thus being advantageous to deliver high photovoltaic performance for DSSCs. The Tafel polarization curves of dummy cells used in EIS testing were also recorded, and the results are shown in Fig. 4d. Conspicuously, the SPG achieves a relatively large exchange current density (J0) compared with Pt, evidenced by the slope of the anodic branch in the polarization zone.54 Such a large J0 is responsible for small Rct,55 which is in line with the EIS results above.
3.3. DFT calculations
In order to decouple the roles of S species within the SPG matrix in the I3− reduction, DFT calculations were performed, which could be favorable for rational design and construction of high performance CE materials for DSSCs. As we know, the overall I3− reduction reaction occurring on CEs could be described in a general equation: I3−(sol) + 2e− ↔ 3I−(sol), including three elementary reactions:56 I3−(sol) ↔ I2(sol) + I−(sol)(1) I2(sol) + 2* → 2I*(2) I* + e− → I−(sol)(3)where sol represents the acetonitrile solution, and * means the active site on the electrode. Reaction (1) easily reaches equilibrium due to a relatively large rate constant. Consequently, reactions (2) and (3), occurring at the electrolyte/electrode interface, are considered to be rate-determining steps to the overall reaction.57,58 With this in mind, reaction (2) and (3) need to be mainly considered and investigated in detail. To simplify the calculations, the G slabs made of seven hexagonal carbon rings and different sulfur configurations as building blocks are used, which are schemed in Fig. 5 (inset). The ionization energy (Ei) of the electrocatalyst could reflect its electron-donating capability, and the low Ei would be responsible for the fast rate of reaction (3).59 The detailed Ei values of various G slabs were calculated and are shown in Fig. 5 and Table S5.† It can be clearly observed that the Ei values vary with S species on G. The Ei follows an order of G slab with sulfone-S < G slab with thiophene-S < G slab with thiol-S < G slab. The dissociation energy (Ed) of iodide in acetonitrile solution was also achieved via DFT study, and the Ed value is 26.78 kcal mol−1, which is larger than that of reaction (2) in the presence of the catalyst. Therefore reaction (3) is the rate-determining step in this system. The S species could decrease the Ei value and enhance the catalytic activity for the corresponding G slabs. This is also to say that when employed as a CE, the SPG would reduce charge transfer resistance and rapidly transfer electrons from an external circuit to the bulk electrolyte, thus increasing the Jsc and FF, and finally improving the PCE of DSSCs.
 Fig. 5  Relationship between the calculated Ei for different kinds of G slabs, and the corresponding atomic ratio of various S species in the SPG (inset: four kinds of slab models, in which grey, yellow, red, purple, blue, and green balls represent carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, thiol-S, thiophene-S, and sulfone-S atoms, respectively). 
To determine the influence of annealing temperature of SPG on the corresponding photovoltaic performance, devices with SPG prepared at 800 °C (SPG-800) and 1000 °C (SPG-1000) as the CE were assembled and evaluated, the J–V curves of which are shown in Fig. S8a.† Clearly, DSSCs with SPG-800 and SPG-1000 deliver a PEC of 8.16% and 8.00%, respectively. Though their performance is inferior to that of cells with SPG annealed at 900 °C (PCE = 8.57%), SPG-800 and SPG-1000 exhibit potential to supersede noble Pt (PCE = 7.88%). CV curves of SPG-800 and SPG-1000 CEs were also recorded to compare their electrocatalytic activity (Fig. S8b†). The Epp of SPG-800 is 0.15 V, which is lower than that of SPG-1000 (0.16 V). Additionally, the Ared peak intensity of SPG-800 is large compared with that of SPG-1000. Thus the SPG-800 CE possesses high catalytic activity and endows the device with high photovoltaic performance. SPG annealed at 900 °C manifests the smallest Epp of 0.12 V, indicating its superb catalytic activity towards I3− reduction. The difference in Voc for devices with SPG-800, SPG-900, and SPG-1000 CEs can be attributed to their respective electrocatalytic activity towards triiodide reduction. The SPG-900 CE has a small Epp value compared with SPG-800 and SPG-1000 CEs in this work, suggesting a high catalytic activity and a fast reduction of triiodide. The high catalytic activity of SPG-900 can be ascribed to its relatively high S content (Fig. S9†).
3.4. Electrochemical stability of SPG CEs
The electrochemical stability of CEs in the I3−/I− electrolyte is another crucial factor for large scale applications of DSSCs. The electrochemical stability of SPG and Pt CEs was measured and compared. For a typical run, fresh symmetrical dummy cells with SPG or Pt CEs were assembled. Then, these cells were subjected to a repeated treatment via fast CV measurements at ambient temperature followed by EIS, the detailed results of which are exhibited in Fig. 6. It can be noted that no obvious changes are observed for the Rs and ZN of SPG and Pt dummy cells, revealing that the cycle number does not influence the Rs and mass transport of the I3−/I− couple. The Rct of the Pt reference increases significantly with the increase of cycle number, revealing the poor stability in electrochemical environments. As for the SPG dummy cell, the relatively slight changes of the Rct are manifested as the cycle number increases, indicative of robust electrochemical stability.
 Fig. 6  Electrochemical stability of symmetrical dummy cells with (a) SPG and (b) Pt CEs in acetonitrile solution of I3−/I−, and the corresponding magnified Nyquist plots and equivalent circuits are shown in the inset. The sequence of measurements was as follows: 2 × CV scans (from 0 V → 1 V → 0 V → −1 V → 0 V, scan rate: 50 mV s−1), 30 s relaxation at 0 V, and EIS measurement was conducted at 0 V from 0.8 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The electrochemical tests were repeated 10 times. (c) Rct changes of SPG and Pt CEs versus the scan numbers. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, sulfur-doped porous graphene (SPG) was engineered via ball milling followed by an in situ S-doped process. The as-prepared SPG features rich edge sites, highly exposed active sites within G basal planes, and interconnected porous structures. The rich edge sites could modulate and improve the electrochemical properties of G. The exposed basal planes of G are activated via incorporating S species, thus enhancing the catalytic activity of bulk G. Compared with G, the macropores of SPG could act as ion-buffering reservoirs, which facilitate fast transfer of redox couples in the electrolyte. Benefiting from these unique characteristics, when first applied as a CE for DSSCs, excellent I3− reduction activity with a high power conversion efficiency of 8.67% is achieved, outperforming the Pt reference (7.88%) and G (7.62%). The influence of annealing temperature on SPG is analyzed, and SPG prepared at 900 °C shows the best photovoltaic and electrochemical performance. DFT calculations reveal that the S species within the SPG matrix could decrease the ionization energy of G, which will be favorable for transferring electrons rapidly from external circuits to the I3− in the electrolyte and decreasing charge-transfer resistance, thus contributing to a remarkable improvement in photovoltaic performance. More importantly, robust electrochemical stability of the SPG CE is also demonstrated, indicative of its great potential toward Pt replacement. The present work first decouples the roles of S species on G in I3− reduction and provides an efficient strategy to design high-performance carbon-based electrodes with interconnected porous structures and surface-enriched active sites for advanced energy devices.
