    , Accepted 4th November 2013First published on 7th November 2013AbstractThe state of interfaces between organic semiconductors and/or metals in organic devices severely impacts their performance and stability. The commonly used organic semiconductor PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) is hygroscopic in nature and can therefore be easily damaged if exposed to air and/or light illumination. In this study, we doped PEDOT:PSS with WOx nanocrystallites and found that organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with the WOx doped PEDOT:PSS degrade only by 5%, while OPVs with undoped PEDOT:PSS retain only 23% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after storing for 5000 h in air. Also, doping PEDOT:PSS with WOx enhances the initial PCE by ∼13%, owing to reduced leakage current density and better Ohmic contact between the PEDOT:PSS and the anode.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) convey several advantages such as flexibility, lightweight, low cost, and fast mode of production.1–10 OPVs can be processed either by regular geometry or inverted geometry simply by manipulating the energy bands. In the regular geometry, holes are collected at the top electrode (ITO), while electrons are collected at the bottom electrode (Ag/Al). The schematic stack and energy band diagram of an inverted OPV are depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. Here, the collection of holes and electrons is opposite to that of regular OPVs. Recently, the inverted geometry has attracted more attention because all layers, except the indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode, can be solution processed. Furthermore, the inverted geometry has been proven to be more stable than the regular geometry.11–19 Lloyd et al.20 demonstrated device stability in several ways, including through storage in various environments. Their conclusion was that when ZnO is used as the negative electrode and Ag as the positive electrode (inverted geometry), there is little to no degradation in comparison with the use of Ag as the negative electrode and ITO as the positive electrode (regular geometry). However, in OPVs (both inverted and regular), organic light emitting diodes and organic transistors, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a frequently used hole transport layer (HTL).

PEDOT:PSS improves the anode contact and increases the hole collection ability in organic devices, although PEDOT:PSS has occasionally proved to be an unstable material due to its highly acidic nature and/or high chemical reactivity. Because of its high chemical reactivity, PEDOT:PSS can easily etch the ITO electrode, leading to bad device stability.21 Seemann et al.22 studied the degradation behavior of an inverted device. They reported that due to the gas permeability of the PEDOT:PSS, oxygen can diffuse through, which, combined with illumination, results in the decrease of the short circuit current. Further, these authors assigned the conductivity decrement under illumination of the PEDOT:PSS layer with time. To overcome these challenges, the inorganic materials with wide band gaps, namely MoO3, V2O5, and WO3, by vacuum deposition were used as substitutes for PEDOT:PSS.23,24 Nevertheless, vacuum processes are considered costly, which makes these materials incompatible with the popular concept of solution-processable, cost effective, and roll-to-roll fabricated OPVs. Thus, solution-processed WOx,25–29 V2Ox30,31 and MoOx have been the topic of recent reports.32 More recently, a comparative study on the stability of solution processed and thermally evaporated MoOx with PEDOT:PSS has been reported.33 The authors show equal degradation of OPVs with the two differently processed MoOx. In their results, the OPVs degrade by 30% after 1000 h, while neat PEDOT:PSS retains only 20% of its PCE after 200 h.
Thus, it is understandable that interface states are major causes of device instability. However, there is still a lot to be done in order to understand how metal-oxide/metal interfaces in organic devices affect their properties. In particular, chemical states, chemical interactions and the resultant electronic band structures are the most relevant areas of study. For example, in inorganic-semiconductor applications, such as metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), chemical reactions and defects at the metal/oxide interface can cause an oxide gate-dielectric to have a high leakage current.34
This work, focuses on an inverted OPV, where the effect of doping PEDOT:PSS with WOx on device performance and the stability is studied. The effect of WOx doping was examined by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By performing XPS and time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) we find that changes in the metal electrode and/or metal–inorganic interface are one of the most important causes of the observed degradation in OPVs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) represents the inverted geometry OPV with the following device structure: glass/ITO/LZO/P3HT:IC60BA/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:WOx/Al. Fig. 1(b) indicates the energy band diagram of the OPVs. In the present study, lithium doped zinc oxide (LZO) with 2 wt% lithium is used as an electron transport layer, and two different anode buffer layers, PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx are employed. The buffer layers employed with PEDOT:PSS:WOx were optimized with different blends.
A sol–gel processed nanocrystalline WOx powder was blended with PEDOT:PSS. The morphological change and the roughness of the films with and without WOx incorporated were studied by TEM and AFM. The TEM and AFM images are shown in Fig. 2 and S1†, respectively. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the WOx distribution in the PEDOT:PSS matrix at low and high magnifications, respectively. Note that initially, WOx powder with 10 nm crystallites was used for blending. However, the images here show WOx nanocrystallites varying in size in the range of 10–30 nm, possibly due to clustering of WOx particles depending on the anionic or cationic response. The cross sectional view taken by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) shown in Fig. 2(c) indicates that WOx is embedded well in the PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 2(d) shows the top surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS at high magnification, indicating good film uniformity. The presence of WOx was confirmed (see ESI Fig. S2 (a–d)†) by means of elemental mapping and determination of the detailed chemical composition by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Negligible increments in the conductivity, 5.925 to 5.932 S m−1, and roughness, from 1.4 to 1.5 nm, are observed after WOx doping.

The performances of the devices are presented in Fig. 3(a). We observed a 12.9% improvement in the PCE with WOx, from 4.10 to 4.63%, which is mainly due to an improved current density from 7.61 to 8.51 mA cm−2. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) with a 10% improvement is observed, suggesting that the charge separation and collection processes are rather efficient by means of WOx doping. The EQEs are shown in Fig. 3(b) and the performance parameters are reported in Table S1.† One order of magnitude lower leakage currents are observed in WOx devices compared to control devices, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Lower leakage currents indicate that the interlayer is efficient in blocking electrons and collecting holes, resulting in the decrease in series resistance from 2.99 to 1.88 Ω cm2 and the shunt resistance increases from 2452 to 3349 Ω cm2. The dark J–V curves shown in Fig. 4(a) are collected for comparison. In control devices, the leakage current is significantly increased, while the leakage current is unchanged in WOx devices with aging. A drastic change in the diode characteristics of the control devices is also observed with aging.

We prepared hole only devices (HODs), ITO/PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx/Al. The HODs were encapsulated so that the same conditions could be employed for the HODs and OPV devices. The transport properties of the devices with and without WOx layers were measured initially and after 700 h of aging, as shown in Fig. 4(b). With WOx doping, the hole collection ability improved and it further improved after 700 h of aging time. Meanwhile, in neat PEDOT:PSS, the hole transport ability decreased drastically, indicating film oxidation. The inset of Fig. 4(b) is a magnified image showing the current density after 700 h of aging. It is worth noting that the conductivity of the WOx doped PEDOT:PSS film increased with aging. This phenomenon can be explained with the variation of the tungsten oxide chemical state, which will be explained later.
The stability of encapsulated devices with and without WOx was monitored in air over a period of 5000 h. The OPV with the PEDOT:PSS:WOx interlayer exhibited remarkable stability, with only 5% degradation, whereas neat PEDOT:PSS devices degraded by more than 75% after 5000 h in air (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Long-term stability of the OPVs based on either a PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:WOx interfacial layer. The devices were stored in ambient air. The OPVs with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx degrade by 78% and 5%, respectively, in air after 5000 h storage. 
The small degradation in PCE for WOx-doped devices is mainly due to a decrease in shunt resistance (Rsh), and a decreased fill factor (FF) of the devices. Performance parameters, series resistance (Rs) and Rsh, before and after staying in air for 5000 h are provided in Table S1, ESI.† In the control device (without WOx), the Voc and FF decreased at a faster rate compared with the Jsc. This is related to the remarkable reduction in Rsh (from 2452 to 4.5 Ω cm2) and the slight decrease in Rs.
The chemical properties of the PEDOT:PSS:WOx films were analysed using Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S4, ESI†). For neat PEDOT:PSS, the existence of bands at 560 and 1086 cm−1 is observed. However, an additional peak at 1449 cm−1 arises due to WOx doping. The peaks at 1086 and 560 cm−1 can be assigned to C–C in-plane bending and a stretching vibration arising from neutral parts existing between localized elementary excitations such as positive polarons or bipolarons, generated upon doping.35,36
XPS depth profiles were carried out on six different OPV full devices. The devices are named D1 to D6. Devices D1 and D2 represent the initial state of OPVs (Al/HTLi/BHJ/LZO/ITO) with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx as the HTL, respectively. D3 and D4 are the respective devices after aging for 5000 h in air. D5 and D6 represent D1 and D2, respectively, but without Al deposition (HTLi/BHJ/LZO/ITO). The binding energies (BE) obtained in the XPS analysis were calibrated by referencing the C1s peak at 284.5 eV. The focus here was the changes at the interface of the Al–HTL electrode and the bulk HTL.
First, we discuss the reaction of Al with oxygen and carbon. The Al concentration at the interface decreased with time for both devices (ESI, Fig. S5(1)†). This might be due to the fact that carbon and oxygen concentrations increased with aging (ESI, Fig. S5(2) and S5(3)†). The substantial reduction in the Al peak (Al2p) and the increase of its BE are observed in D3 (control device). The peak intensity of Al at 71.6 eV in D1, D2 and D4 at the interface indicates the formation of an Al–O–C type of bonding.37
Second, we observed the severe damage of S2p at the Al–HTL interface (ESI Fig. S5†). The irregularity of the S2p peaks infer the modification of the Al–HTL interface. The cationic response of sulphur (S) in PSS to the anionic nature of the PEDOT ring depends on the distance between the two counter ions. The S2p peaks with a binding energy of 166–171 eV originate from the S atoms in the PSS units and the S2p peak with a lower BE of 162–166 eV corresponds to the S atoms in the PEDOT units.38 The S2p peaks of devices D1 to D6 are shown in Fig. 6(a). The S2p peaks arising at 162.8 and 164 eV indicate the S in PEDOT. It is important to note that the S2p peak in PSS for neat PEDOT:PSS (D5) is not observed, probably because of the oxidation of sulphur in air. The S2p peak in PSS with WOx doping is not in the doublet form but can be seen at a higher binding energy. This is an indication that WOx doping prevents S oxidation. In neat PEDOT:PSS (D1), the S2p peak is observed in a doublet for PSS. However, the S is modified with aging, as seen in device D3 (Fig. 6(1 & 3)). Modification of the S2p in D3 is due to oxidation with aging.
 Fig. 6  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of the various devices. OPV devices with only PEDOT:PSS as the buffer layer initially and after 5000 h are represented as D1 and D3, respectively. The OPV devices with PEDOT:PSS:WOx as the buffer layer initially and after 5000 h are represented as D2 and D4, respectively. Devices D5 and D6 are without Al deposition with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx buffer layers, respectively. (a) represents the deconvolution of the sulfur intensities in the bulk of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx for all the devices (D1 to D6) and (b) shows the deconvoluted peaks of W4f at the HTL–Al interface and in the bulk of PEDOT:PSS:WOx (HTL) for devices D2, D4 and D6. 
The case for WOx devices is different. Initially, a modified S2p can be seen in the WOx-doped device (D2 in Fig. 6(a)(2)), which disappears after aging (D4 in Fig. 6(a)(4)). The different behaviors of the undoped and WOx-doped devices can be interpreted with the chemical states of WOx and S in XPS (Fig. 6) and the ionic response by TOF-SIMS (Fig. 7).

Finally, we monitored the chemical states of WOx at the Al–HTL interface and in the bulk HTL with aging. The W4f (7/2, 5/2) peak is observed at 35.5 eV/37.1 eV (WO3), 35.1/36.7 eV (WO2) with a ratio of 65:35 in the PEDOT:PSS:WOx of D6 (Fig. 6(b)(5)). After thermal deposition of Al, the W4f peak shifts to the lower binding energy. The W4f peak is the doublet peak with 4f7/2, 4f5/2 spin–orbit splitting. The spectra for device D2 (initial with WOx) at the interface and the bulk are fitted with three doublet peaks: the W4f7/2 peak at (31.2 eV, 32.1 eV and 35.0 eV) and (30.30 eV, 31.2 eV, 34.7 eV), respectively for the interface and bulk. Similarly, the spectra for device D4 (with WOx and after 5000 h) at the interface and in the bulk are, respectively, characterised with three doublet peaks of W4f7/2 at (30.9 eV, 32.2 eV and 36.7 eV) and (30.9 eV, 33.2 eV and 34.6 eV). This confirms the three chemical states of tungsten; W0, W4+, W6+. Note that the initial tungsten oxide (D6) was in the form WO3:WO2 (65:35). Therefore the fully oxidized WOx (x = 3) changed to the lower oxidation state (x < 3) with aging. Reduced WOx can be in found in various forms such as W/WO2/W2O5. The conductivity of tungsten oxide increases with decreasing oxidation states of WOx.39 This is consistent with the improvement of the Ohmic response with aging time of the PEDOT:PSS:WOx film in the HODs presented herein. This may be as a result of oxygen ions moving out of the WO3 layer and forming an oxygen vacancy conductive path. On the other hand, in neat PEDOT:PSS devices, the XPS and HOD results indicate that the film has a greater tendency to oxidize, which highly decreases the electrical conductivity.
We carried out TOF-SIMS to specifically measure the mass quantity and ionic forms of various chemical species such as O, C, S, AlOx, WOx, etc. WOx ion concentrations before and after storing for 5000 h are shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. It is observed that initially, WOx is present mostly in the WO3− and WO2− states. With aging, WO4−, WO3− and WO2− were major components with a few traces of WO− and W−. In PEDOT:PSS, PSS is anionic in nature and is bound with the cationic PEDOT chain. However, sulphur bonding in PSS shows alternation either due to bond breaking or changing with WOx incorporation. Similar changes include (I) the oxidation behaviour detected by TOF-SIMS, which impacted the transport properties of the HODs, and affected their resistance and leakage current in dark J–V, and (II) the variations in the chemical states of sulphur in PSS (observed by XPS), which strongly infer the formation of proper bonds between PEDOT and WOx. Thus, here we hypothesize that PEDOT+ is bonded with WOx− and/or forms PEDOT+:WOx−, which is why there is a significant impact of WOx doping on stability. However, further study is warranted to verify this hypothesis. Further, we checked the positive ion concentration in WOx devices before and after aging, but WOx was found only in anionic states. In consistency with Al–O–C formation, we highlighted O, AlOx, C and S ion concentrations, as shown in Fig. 7c and d, and Fig. S6(a) and S6(b),† respectively. The oxygen and AlOx anion uptakes for D1, D2, D3 and D4 devices are very much similar; this proves that oxygen at the interface forms AlOx. Thus, it can be said from the TOF-SIMS results that WOx doping highly decreased oxidation. However, further study is required to interpret the change of work function at the interface.
Conclusions
WOx doped PEDOT:PSS proved to be an effective hole transport layer for OPV stability and performance. The improved performances of the OPVs were about 13%, owing to reduced leakage current density and better Ohmic response of PEDOT:PSS:WOx in comparison with neat PEODT:PSS. Storing the OPVs in air for 5000 h resulted in only 5% degradation of the devices with WOx-doping, while devices with neat PEDOT:PSS retained only 23% of their initial PCE. By means of XPS and TOF-SIMS studies, we found that WOx doping in PEDOT:PSS highly reduces the oxidation at the organic semiconductor–metal interface. The TEM results show the proper distribution of WOx crystallites in the PEDOT:PSS blend. The approach reported here provides a simple and versatile method to improve the performance and stability of OPVs.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
The PEDOT:PSS:WOx solution was spin-coated on a photoactive layer, and then baked in a glove-box at 130 °C for 20 min to complete the transformation into PEDOT:PSS:WOx. Aqueous WOx solution was prepared by the hydration method described by Dong et al.40,41 An ammonium metatungstate hydrate (AMH) containing 85% WOx was dissolved in water to form a 1 mM solution, followed by drop wise addition of 2 M hydrochloric acid until the pH of the mixed solution reached between 1 and 1.5. Aqueous WOx solution was obtained by filtering with a 0.45 μm filter.
Zinc acetate dihydrate (99.9%, Merck) was used as a starting material for the LZO and was twice recrystallized from double distilled water. The complexes with monoethanolamine were prepared in ethanol solution. Resultant complexes of 1:1 stoichiometric composition were obtained. Lithium chloride was used as a doping agent in zinc acetate based precursors for the LZO film. The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 15 min. The lithium zinc oxide (LZO) cathode buffer layer was spin-coated at 700 rpm for 25 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the LZO film was annealed in air at 300 °C for 10 min. The substrate was transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove-box and the photoactive blend layer was prepared by spin coating (700 rpm) a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and a fullerene derivative (IC60BA) (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration 20 mg mL−1) on the LZO coated ITO electrode for 25 s, then baking at 130 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the active layer was around 90 nm. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 mm filter and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s on the photoactive layer. Later, the PEDOT:PSS:WOx film was baked at 130 °C for 20 min in a controlled atmosphere. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS:WOx was around 30 nm. Finally, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and 100 nm of Al was thermally deposited on the photoactive layer under a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 Torr. The active area of the device was 0.04 cm2.
Characterization and measurement
AFM imaging was performed in air using a Digital Instrument Multimode equipped with a nanoscope IIIa controller. FE-SEM imaging was performed in air by means of a Hitachi S-4700. TEM images were collected by a Model no JEM-2100F (JEOL) with a 200 kV electron gun of 2.3 nm focal length with 1.4 nm minimum steps, having 0.23 nm point and 0.1 nm lattice resolution. EDS was measured by an Oxford INCA with a Mn Kα source of 136 eV energy at 30 mm2 resolution. TOF-SIM was measured with an IONTOF made TOFSIMS5 version machine. A Bi+ ion gun with 25 keV energy, 1 pA current was used to analyse a 0.25 mm2 area. A Cs+ ion gun with 3 keV energy, 40 nA current was used as a sputter parameter to analyse a 4 mm2 area.
XPS measurements were carried out in a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (Ulvac-PHI) with a background pressure of 6.7 × 10−8 Pa using a monochromatized Al Kα (hν – 1486.6 eV) anode (25 W, 15 kV). The spot size for XPS measurements was 100 μm × 100 μm. Raman scattering experiments were performed at room temperature using a Raman spectrometer (LabRAMHR) with the 514.5 nm line of an Ar laser. The power conversion efficiencies of the inverted OPVs were measured under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light (Oriel Model 91192) at 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The EQE measurements were carried out using an EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and a HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiode was used as a reference diode.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of an inverted OPV structure with PEDOT:PSS:WOx as an anode buffer layer and (b) schematic energy band diagram of inverted geometry OPVs.	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM images of PEDOT:PSS:WOx at (a) low magnification and (b) high magnification, where the red circle represents the WOx crystallite, (c) FE-SEM cross sectional image of the PEDOT:PSS:WOx layer and (d) TEM image of PEDOT:PSS.	 

 	Fig. 3  Initial (I), and after 5000 h (5k) devices, with and without WOx doping; (a) J–V curves of the OPVs under AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and (b) external quantum efficiency spectra of the OPVs.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Dark J–V curves of the OPVs with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx anode buffer layers. (b) Current–voltage characteristics of hole only devices with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx, initially and after 700 h storage in ambient air, with the following device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:WOx (∼40 nm)/Al).	 

 	Fig. 5  Long-term stability of the OPVs based on either a PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS:WOx interfacial layer. The devices were stored in ambient air. The OPVs with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx degrade by 78% and 5%, respectively, in air after 5000 h storage.	 

 	Fig. 6  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of the various devices. OPV devices with only PEDOT:PSS as the buffer layer initially and after 5000 h are represented as D1 and D3, respectively. The OPV devices with PEDOT:PSS:WOx as the buffer layer initially and after 5000 h are represented as D2 and D4, respectively. Devices D5 and D6 are without Al deposition with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx buffer layers, respectively. (a) represents the deconvolution of the sulfur intensities in the bulk of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:WOx for all the devices (D1 to D6) and (b) shows the deconvoluted peaks of W4f at the HTL–Al interface and in the bulk of PEDOT:PSS:WOx (HTL) for devices D2, D4 and D6.	 

 	Fig. 7  TOF-SIMS images: WOx presents in various anionic oxidation states in (a) initial and (b) after 5000 h devices. (c) Oxygen (O−) and (d) AlOx− uptake initially and after 5000 h in PEDOT:PSS (PP) and PEDOT:PSS:WOx (PP:WOx) devices, respectively.
